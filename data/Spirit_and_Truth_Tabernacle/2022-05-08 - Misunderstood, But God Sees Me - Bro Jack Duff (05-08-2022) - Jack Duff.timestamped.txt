[50:48] let you be seated
[50:52] here in genesis 16
[50:54] verse
[50:55] 6
[50:57] says but abram
[50:59] said it said unto sarai
[51:01] behold
[51:03] thy maid is in thy hand
[51:06] due to her as it pleases thee
[51:10] uh and when
[51:12] sarai dealt hardly with her she fled
[51:14] from her face
[51:16] the angel of the lord found her by
[51:20] a fountain of waters
[51:23] in the wilderness for uh by the fountain
[51:26] in the way way too sure
[51:28] said hagar sir eyes made whence cometh
[51:32] down when cain is down and whether we'll
[51:35] go
[51:36] she said i flee from the face of my
[51:39] mistress
[51:40] to rye
[51:42] praise the lord now there was two
[51:43] questions asked
[51:45] uh whence came as thou
[51:48] and willow will now go now she only
[51:50] answered one question
[51:52] and she said i flee from
[51:54] uh the face of my mistress
[51:57] sarai
[51:59] right so she probably was in a little
[52:00] fix here didn't even know where she was
[52:02] going amen
[52:05] sometimes mamas find themselves
[52:08] themselves in places like that little
[52:10] pictures where they don't know
[52:12] which way
[52:14] to go
[52:15] praise the lord
[52:17] verse 9 says in the angel of the lord
[52:19] said unto her return to thy mistress
[52:23] and submit thyself under her hands
[52:27] the angel of the lord said unto her i
[52:29] will multiply
[52:31] thy seed exceedingly that it shall not
[52:33] be numbered for multitude
[52:36] the angel lord said unto her behold thou
[52:39] art with child and shalt bear a son
[52:42] and shall call his name
[52:44] ishmael uh because the lord hath heard
[52:48] thy affliction
[52:50] and he will be a wild man his hand will
[52:54] be against every man and every man's
[52:56] hand against him
[52:57] and he shall dwell in the presence of
[53:00] all his brethren
[53:01] and she called the name
[53:04] of the lord and she called the name of
[53:06] the lord that spoken to her

[54:23] be seated
[54:31] praise the lord
[54:33] um
[54:35] i want to just use for a title today
[54:40] misunderstood
[54:42] but god sees me
[54:44] amen misunderstood but god
[54:48] sees me
[54:49] amen
[54:50] praise the lord and um i know that the
[54:53] prophet tells us that mother's day
[54:55] should not just be one day a year but
[54:58] mother's day is
[54:59] is uh every day it should be every day
[55:02] and uh we we do understand that
[55:05] but for myself
[55:08] being that
[55:10] we have this day set aside i try to do
[55:12] everything i can to
[55:13] get a word from the lord that might
[55:15] encourage the moms
[55:17] amen i always try to do that and even on
[55:20] father's day i try to do that just try
[55:21] to have something that we can encourage
[55:23] the moms with and and uh and i'm just
[55:25] just praying over this and just
[55:27] meditating on this and just kind of came
[55:29] with this little thought misunderstood
[55:30] but god
[55:32] sees me hey man just let me uh uh start
[55:35] here by just reading a couple things
[55:37] here
[55:38] and uh we'll get into our text uh the
[55:40] first little quote that i'd like to read
[55:42] is from
[55:43] summer mother's day um anybody knows me
[55:46] you know me well when it comes to
[55:48] mother's day there's a few quotes that i
[55:51] like to read because i don't you usually
[55:53] get a chance to read them other times
[55:55] during the year but mother's day you're
[55:56] gonna hear them from me
[55:58] uh because i think this is my favorite
[56:01] favorite you know statements that i've
[56:03] heard and i just thank god for the
[56:05] prophet just kind of sharing it but but
[56:06] let's listen to this uh this is coming
[56:08] out of mother's day paragraph 31 says
[56:10] mother is so great
[56:13] you know the first one that receives you
[56:17] this life is your mother
[56:20] no one can touch you
[56:22] because you're conceived and she bears
[56:25] you under her heart
[56:27] and she is the first to know you and
[56:30] first in this life to hold you
[56:33] uh then when you're when you're born see
[56:36] uh one of the first hands that touch you
[56:38] and
[56:39] wipes back the tears out of your eye
[56:42] praise god some of y'all just start
[56:44] going down journeys and
[56:45] um
[56:47] just
[56:50] going back in time and thinking about
[56:51] how maybe you had a little what they
[56:53] call a little boo boo or something like
[56:54] that
[56:55] and you go running to mama mama had a
[56:58] way of just touching you
[57:00] amanda and and sometimes you know
[57:03] uh mama mama actually
[57:06] she didn't have no healing powers
[57:09] she didn't have um uh anything that
[57:12] could stop the bleeding like that you
[57:14] know she could probably maybe get a
[57:16] band-aid or something like that but but
[57:18] one of the things that stopped the tears
[57:20] from flowing in your eyes is when mama
[57:22] would just say let me blow on it that's
[57:26] all mama had to do it just blow on it
[57:28] and in some kind of way amen just
[57:31] because it was coming from mama
[57:33] come on somebody amen you felt comfort
[57:36] you felt hey man you felt relief some
[57:38] kind of way because mama was paying
[57:40] attention to it
[57:42] mama has a way of just doing things it's
[57:45] different to what daddy would do daddy
[57:47] might pick you up brush yours and not
[57:49] get back out there and keep playing amen
[57:52] but mama would just i mean she cried
[57:54] with you
[57:56] glory to god she wiped the the whatever
[57:59] what she wipe it up she clean it up mama
[58:01] had a way of just it meant hail in the
[58:03] situation that made you feel real good
[58:06] you didn't mind taking things
[58:09] to mama
[58:10] glory to god it says he says
[58:13] uh one of the first hands that touch you
[58:15] and wipes back the tears out of your eye
[58:18] uh she's the first one to pat you and to
[58:20] love you and to cool over you in this
[58:23] life is your mother now think
[58:26] that there is not enough honor that we
[58:29] could give to a mother praise god mother
[58:33] is first with a child and she's a great
[58:36] responsibility
[58:37] of what that child will be so mamas you
[58:40] help shape a man the direction of your
[58:43] children mother is first with a child
[58:46] she's great she's a great responsibility
[58:48] of what that child will be will be based
[58:50] upon the way that mother starts that
[58:53] child on the path that it must travel i
[58:57] like that statement amen because
[59:00] sometimes mama you started them on a
[59:02] certain path but somewhere along the
[59:05] line they get off the roads
[59:07] blessed be the name of the lord but you
[59:09] have a promise that you can hold god too
[59:11] he said train up a child
[59:14] in the way that they should go and then
[59:17] he said they said and when they get old
[59:20] come on sometimes they go through some
[59:21] from saying some things when they're
[59:23] young but when they get old
[59:26] they won't depart from that path that
[59:28] you established at the beginning
[59:30] so mama don't get discouraged know that
[59:32] you've done exactly what god told you to
[59:35] do
[59:37] hallelujah hallelujah says mother has
[59:39] the responsibility from god to place
[59:41] that child on the right road
[59:43] and i think that's why mother has a
[59:45] special
[59:46] little touch
[59:48] amen so i just want to uh stop with that
[59:50] one there
[59:51] praise god let me just go on to another
[59:53] one here really quick at an invasion of
[59:55] the united states mama has a great
[59:58] responsibility and i appreciate
[1:00:00] all the godly mothers amen that have
[1:00:03] raised their children in the ways of the
[1:00:04] lord
[1:00:05] we certainly appreciate mothers like
[1:00:07] that here in the invasion of the united
[1:00:09] states the prophet says this to your
[1:00:11] little mothers here this morning that's
[1:00:13] been real mothers and i know there's
[1:00:15] many of you
[1:00:16] i think every one of you let me tell you
[1:00:18] something god bless you
[1:00:20] you're the fifth gospel glory i think
[1:00:23] let me tell you uh
[1:00:25] let me tell you what's in in there for
[1:00:27] your children
[1:00:28] just a little thing
[1:00:30] because brother neville will probably
[1:00:31] preach about a mother tonight or whoever
[1:00:34] one of the one of us that preaches i
[1:00:36] write about mothers but listen let me
[1:00:38] ask you something remember when moses
[1:00:40] was a little boy it was a mother who
[1:00:42] gave who give him his instruction it was
[1:00:45] a godly mother who took his took little
[1:00:47] moses on her knees
[1:00:49] and and moses taught him all he was her
[1:00:52] teacher uh she was his teacher rather
[1:00:55] under pharaoh and now these things said
[1:00:57] moses someday you're going to deliver
[1:00:59] the children of israel you're the boy
[1:01:01] that's called keep yourself pure and
[1:01:04] unspotted from the world for you the one
[1:01:07] you're the one now i can just imagine as
[1:01:11] moses mothers kind of carrying him
[1:01:13] through
[1:01:14] a man uh uh maybe just some of the
[1:01:16] history how he even came into existence
[1:01:19] and just about his birth and all that
[1:01:21] maybe some of her instruction amen to
[1:01:24] moses might have caused moses to
[1:01:25] misunderstand why she was the way she
[1:01:28] was with him but it was later on in life
[1:01:30] that moses could understand more of what
[1:01:32] his mother's instructions was all about
[1:01:34] what his true purpose in life was
[1:01:36] hallelujah mama all you got to do is
[1:01:38] just plant the seed it's up to god to
[1:01:41] water it
[1:01:42] amen and sometimes i want to tell you
[1:01:44] when you're planting seeds it's very
[1:01:46] uncomfortable uh conversations
[1:01:49] it's not very uncomfortable words that
[1:01:51] you have to speak sometimes but but
[1:01:53] don't no don't don't worry about it just
[1:01:55] say what god tell you to say god will
[1:01:57] bring it forth at some later time
[1:02:00] i remember being a young man and having
[1:02:02] to hear my mama talk to me sometime i
[1:02:04] some of those conversations i wanted to
[1:02:06] avoid
[1:02:07] amen but i remember mama just sharing
[1:02:10] and amen and uh there's a few things
[1:02:13] that that i go back let me tell you what
[1:02:14] let me just finish this quote and then
[1:02:16] i'll come back to that little thought
[1:02:18] there uh here he says um
[1:02:21] uh moses on these taught him all uh uh
[1:02:24] mother someday you're gonna be the
[1:02:25] delivered to the children of israel
[1:02:27] you're the boy that's called keep
[1:02:29] yourself pure and not spotted from the
[1:02:31] world for you the one you're the one no
[1:02:34] other place do we know where he even
[1:02:36] went to any seminary any teaching at all
[1:02:39] he ever got he stayed right in pharaoh's
[1:02:41] palace which was a heathen but his
[1:02:43] mother taught him that's a real
[1:02:47] mother she taught him the precepts of
[1:02:49] the lord she told him how he must be
[1:02:51] holy she told him how and what he must
[1:02:54] live and how what god must do would do
[1:02:56] for him and it stuck with moses all the
[1:02:59] days of his life and any good true loyal
[1:03:02] mother that'll take her little babies
[1:03:04] instead of send them to picture shows
[1:03:06] and dances and so forth like that she'll
[1:03:08] put them on a lap and teach them about
[1:03:10] the lord jesus christ you know i was
[1:03:13] just uh reflecting here because you know
[1:03:15] as moses mother had the opportunity to
[1:03:17] teach him in egypt egypt represents the
[1:03:20] world and uh and mothers today have to
[1:03:23] raise their kids in some really really
[1:03:25] difficult conditions there's a pool of
[1:03:27] the world everywhere they turn there's a
[1:03:29] pull of the world when they turn on the
[1:03:31] tv there's a pull of a world when they
[1:03:33] go to school there's a pull of the world
[1:03:35] everywhere they turn there's a pool when
[1:03:38] they go to walmart there's a pool of the
[1:03:40] world everywhere our children go there's
[1:03:42] something pulling them
[1:03:44] pulling them into wrong but mothers you
[1:03:46] have a responsibility to try to teach
[1:03:48] them and lead them in the right
[1:03:49] direction i just remember as a young man
[1:03:52] i certainly had the pulling world in my
[1:03:54] life and young people i want to tell you
[1:03:56] something you're not alone when you feel
[1:03:58] the pull of the world that that's
[1:03:59] something that's normal amen that's
[1:04:01] something that's very normal everybody
[1:04:04] in here has the pull of the world on
[1:04:06] them
[1:04:07] everybody but it's up to you to make a
[1:04:09] decision amen that i'm not gonna go the
[1:04:12] way of the world but i'm gonna go the
[1:04:14] way of god
[1:04:15] each one of us have to come to that
[1:04:17] decision amen but it's up to mamas to
[1:04:19] try to sow some seeds and and i remember
[1:04:22] as a young man just kind of going
[1:04:23] through different things but you know
[1:04:25] mama would just kind of plant certain
[1:04:27] things amen into my spirit and one of
[1:04:29] the things that that mama taught me as a
[1:04:31] as a young man that i i teach uh still
[1:04:33] today to other young men mama just told
[1:04:36] me to say uh you know because when i was
[1:04:38] younger i looked at this bible
[1:04:40] and it's a lot of pages here
[1:04:42] this is what i call a really big book
[1:04:45] and and i didn't like reading hey man i
[1:04:47] really didn't enjoy reading so uh you
[1:04:50] know things have changed now i got old i
[1:04:52] can't i can't i
[1:04:53] help myself i got to pick up the bible
[1:04:55] and read now but but when i was younger
[1:04:57] i didn't want i didn't really want much
[1:04:58] to do with that i'm just being honest
[1:05:00] hey man that's a big book and i always
[1:05:02] ran from the big books give me a real
[1:05:05] small book if you want me to read
[1:05:06] something give me something real small
[1:05:08] just a few pages i can get through in
[1:05:11] five minutes but i didn't want to read
[1:05:13] this big book so mama just broke the big
[1:05:15] book down to a smaller book she said
[1:05:17] just read proverbs
[1:05:20] praise god 31 chapters 31 days in a
[1:05:24] month just read one chapter they read
[1:05:26] proverbs and uh you know and mama just
[1:05:29] broke it down and i said well you know
[1:05:30] what i i probably not gonna read the
[1:05:32] whole bible but i'll tell you what i
[1:05:34] will read proverbs i'll try that i'll
[1:05:36] try that and as i start reading proverbs
[1:05:38] i didn't realize it
[1:05:40] good god almighty but as i'm reading the
[1:05:43] word the word is actually being sowed
[1:05:45] into my heart amen and as i'm facing
[1:05:48] certain
[1:05:49] circumstances
[1:05:50] in life i could go back to what i read
[1:05:52] in proverbs and the word has a way of
[1:05:55] keeping you
[1:05:57] glory to god when mama ain't there and
[1:06:00] daddy ain't there and passing there the
[1:06:03] word has a way of keeping you
[1:06:06] if you get the word on the inside of you
[1:06:09] hey i believe that the bible said i will
[1:06:12] keep you in perfect peace
[1:06:14] if you keep your heart and your mind
[1:06:16] stayed on me
[1:06:18] but i found that the word kept me out of
[1:06:20] certain situations
[1:06:22] the word kept me in certain
[1:06:23] circumstances because i i heeded the
[1:06:26] advice of my mom who said just read
[1:06:29] proverbs
[1:06:31] glory to god sometimes that's all you
[1:06:32] got to just give them just a little
[1:06:34] something there's enough
[1:06:36] there's enough power
[1:06:38] in just one little scripture
[1:06:40] that'll keep your child from a world
[1:06:43] just a world of trouble
[1:06:45] praise god one little scripture can hold
[1:06:48] can keep them let me just give you a few
[1:06:50] things here amen just to encourage you
[1:06:53] uh these are some quotes on being a
[1:06:56] mother
[1:06:57] a brother posted some time ago
[1:06:59] and i just kind of grabbed it and it's
[1:07:01] coming from a number of different people
[1:07:03] but listen here says this is from
[1:07:05] billy's son he says i don't believe
[1:07:07] there are enough devils
[1:07:08] uh there are devils enough in hell to
[1:07:10] pull a boy out of the arms of a godly
[1:07:12] mother there's not enough devils to pull
[1:07:15] my son into hell
[1:07:17] a godly mother gonna keep fighting for a
[1:07:19] son
[1:07:20] praise god i don't care what i heard
[1:07:22] about him but god the mother when daddy
[1:07:24] give up
[1:07:26] because that is saying now you did the
[1:07:27] crowd you did the crime
[1:07:29] you do the time but mama will be right
[1:07:31] there holding on for that child
[1:07:33] hey man i don't believe there are devils
[1:07:35] enough in hell to pull a boy out of the
[1:07:37] arms of a godly mother now you need to
[1:07:39] understand something uh the love of a
[1:07:42] mother amen is very close to the love of
[1:07:44] god
[1:07:47] hallelujah hey man sometimes daddy's
[1:07:50] don't don't don't make mama give up like
[1:07:52] like you giving up because
[1:07:54] her love kind of goes beyond some things
[1:07:57] hey man she has a different connection
[1:07:59] than the way daddy has so hey man i
[1:08:01] don't believe that the devil's enough to
[1:08:03] inhale to pull a boy out of the arms of
[1:08:05] a godly mother another statement here
[1:08:07] says too many women have too much legion
[1:08:10] time for their own good
[1:08:12] they have time for criticism and gossip
[1:08:15] fault-finding and complaining they have
[1:08:17] time for idol games and lay too much
[1:08:19] attention to things of the flesh there
[1:08:22] are other women who have too little time
[1:08:24] for the enduring things of life they're
[1:08:26] too busy uh fleeting
[1:08:28] about doing this and that they have
[1:08:31] great activity and much doing but they
[1:08:33] lack time for building christian
[1:08:35] characters
[1:08:36] both kind of women the two idol and the
[1:08:38] too busy need to take time for
[1:08:41] meditation and quiet repose and prayer
[1:08:44] to god they need time to cultivate their
[1:08:47] souls that in turn they may cultivate
[1:08:49] their children's lives that's from billy
[1:08:52] graham
[1:08:53] the impression that a praying mother
[1:08:55] leaves upon her children is lifelong
[1:08:58] perhaps when you are dead and gone your
[1:09:00] prayer will be answered
[1:09:03] that's from d.l moody and and i just
[1:09:05] want to inject that the pre
[1:09:08] the impression that a prayer and mother
[1:09:10] leave i remember you know there was a
[1:09:12] time in our life
[1:09:13] glory to god we were you know kids
[1:09:16] growing up there in the house and
[1:09:18] and um
[1:09:19] i remember there was a day where we were
[1:09:21] we were i guess we got a little hungry
[1:09:24] and we just depended on mama to just do
[1:09:26] everything like we couldn't get in there
[1:09:28] fixing a hot dog for ourselves
[1:09:30] but mama had to do it all right and i
[1:09:33] remember there was this one day where we
[1:09:35] were um uh we were all in the house and
[1:09:38] and and as we looked out the window we
[1:09:40] could see all the cars are are here at
[1:09:42] the a
[1:09:43] at the house that means mama's home and
[1:09:45] dad is home and and everybody's here
[1:09:48] somewhere somebody's everybody's here at
[1:09:50] the house now we can see daddy kind of
[1:09:52] walking back and forth in the house but
[1:09:54] we couldn't find mama and we were going
[1:09:56] to ask dad and daddy where's my man
[1:09:58] daddy say uh-huh i'm not sure i don't
[1:10:00] know
[1:10:01] you know we don't know we uh she's
[1:10:03] around here somewhere he just wouldn't
[1:10:04] tell us well daddy we hungry well you
[1:10:06] gotta wait for your mama well daddy
[1:10:08] where's baba well you just gotta wait
[1:10:10] for your mama so we start looking out
[1:10:12] the window i see her car here she got to

[1:25:07] he's saying woman how can you praise at
[1:25:09] a time like this mamas how can you
[1:25:12] praise when your children act enough
[1:25:15] cutting up acting a fool praise god how
[1:25:19] can you keep on praising
[1:25:22] well the teacher she said captain i
[1:25:24] heard you're loud and clear she said
[1:25:26] well why are you still acting the way
[1:25:28] you acted say because i realized
[1:25:30] something
[1:25:31] she said i got a daughter that i'm going
[1:25:33] to see in new york
[1:25:34] glory to god if we make it to new york

[1:25:58] revelation of who you are
[1:26:04] [Music]
[1:26:05] hey hallelujah
[1:26:12] sometimes your praise can be
[1:26:13] misunderstood
[1:26:17] see that that mother was living a life
[1:26:20] where she didn't need to change the
[1:26:21] music
[1:26:24] she was ready whatever whatever life was
[1:26:27] thrown in her direction
[1:26:29] she was ready for it

[1:26:33] like that before god
[1:26:35] that we're ready for whatever life
[1:26:36] throws in our direction
[1:26:39] misunderstood but god sees
[1:26:43] god seeks
[1:26:44] here i want to read a scripture
[1:26:48] this uh word misunderstand means fail to
[1:26:50] interpret or understand the words or
[1:26:52] actions of someone correctly
[1:26:55] sometimes we fail to understand
[1:26:57] the words or the actions of our mother
[1:27:00] we fail to understand it we just don't
[1:27:02] get it sometimes the glory to god when
[1:27:05] to keep you out of jail
[1:27:06] you realize later on
[1:27:08] why mama had to do what she had to do
[1:27:12] i i remember a young young friend of
[1:27:15] mine and

[1:27:53] yellow celica
[1:27:56] like your parents love you let them show
[1:27:58] the love
[1:28:02] the same guy that told me that
[1:28:05] had that nice celica
[1:28:09] spent a number of years in prison over
[1:28:11] drugs and i had no idea he was into
[1:28:13] drugs
[1:28:14] and now he's a preacher outside you know
[1:28:16] i thank god for it but i remember his
[1:28:18] lesson to me that day your parents love
[1:28:20] you just because they don't get you
[1:28:22] everything
[1:28:24] that you're asking for
[1:28:26] it does not mean that they don't love
[1:28:28] you
[1:28:30] hallelujah
[1:28:31] actually what they all teach you
[1:28:32] sometimes that you have to work to get
[1:28:34] what you want
[1:28:36] praise the lord you got the work
[1:28:39] to get what you want
[1:28:41] it don't mean you need it
[1:28:43] but you have the word to get what you
[1:28:45] want
[1:28:47] and sometimes mamas have to teach those
[1:28:49] hard lessons
[1:28:51] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:28:53] let's look at a scripture of a lady here
[1:28:56] who was absolutely misunderstood
[1:28:59] turn with me to
[1:29:01] first samuel
[1:29:03] chapter one
[1:29:12] glory holland
[1:29:29] first samuel chapter one says this
[1:29:32] now there was a certain man of
[1:29:35] remethane sophia of mount ephraim and
[1:29:38] his name was
[1:29:39] elkanah
[1:29:41] the son of jeroham the son of elihu the
[1:29:44] son of tohu the son of zeus
[1:29:47] an air force
[1:29:51] and he had two wives the name of one was
[1:29:53] hannah
[1:29:54] the name of the other pinanaya
[1:29:57] uh uh uh
[1:29:58] yeah
[1:30:00] uh
[1:30:01] penny nah something like that
[1:30:03] uh and pinata had children but hannah
[1:30:06] had no children now i want to just kind
[1:30:07] of catch this and you know notice the
[1:30:09] scripture tells us that he had two wives
[1:30:11] and back then amen this was polygamy and
[1:30:14] it was acceptable to scripture
[1:30:16] um
[1:30:17] you know so we're gonna we're gonna see
[1:30:19] that also in another scripture that
[1:30:20] we'll read a little bit later on but
[1:30:22] here it says if this man went up out of
[1:30:24] his city yearly to worship and the
[1:30:26] sacrifice unto the lord
[1:30:28] of hosts and shiloh and the two sons of
[1:30:31] eli hofney and phineas the priests of
[1:30:33] the lord were there
[1:30:35] and when the time was that elk and the
[1:30:37] offer he gave uh to pinanaya a
[1:30:40] peninnah a man his wife and to all her
[1:30:44] sons and her daughters portions listen
[1:30:46] but unto hannah he gave a worthy portion
[1:30:50] for he loved hannah but the lord had
[1:30:53] shut up her womb
[1:30:55] my god now we know it's the lord that
[1:30:57] actually shut up her womb because the
[1:30:59] husband is able to have children through
[1:31:02] another wife if the problem is not with
[1:31:05] the husband the problem is now with the
[1:31:07] wife
[1:31:08] glory to god amen look at this now
[1:31:11] hallelujah
[1:31:13] amen and her adversary
[1:31:16] now notice what the what what what the
[1:31:18] bible calls it this is the the other
[1:31:21] wife
[1:31:22] it's considered hannah's
[1:31:24] adversary
[1:31:25] amen and her adversary also
[1:31:28] provoked her store for to make her fret
[1:31:31] because the lord had shut up her womb
[1:31:35] and as he did so year by year when she
[1:31:38] went up to the house of the lord
[1:31:41] so she provoked her therefore she wept
[1:31:44] and did not eat now what i want you to
[1:31:46] get that every time she went to church
[1:31:49] amen her adversary was provoking her you
[1:31:53] know how many people stay home the day
[1:31:54] from church because every time they get
[1:31:56] ready to go the devil does something
[1:31:59] look at what happened here today amen
[1:32:01] the devil got to moving but that's not
[1:32:03] gonna stop us from worshiping god
[1:32:09] look at this look at this look at this
[1:32:11] amen says uh
[1:32:13] verse eight says then said elkanah
[1:32:16] amen her husband to her hannah why
[1:32:19] weepest now
[1:32:20] and why eat us down not
[1:32:22] and why is thy heart grief
[1:32:25] am not i better
[1:32:26] uh to thee than ten sons
[1:32:29] so hannah rose up after they had eaten
[1:32:31] in shiloh and after they had drunk now
[1:32:34] eli priest sat up on a seat by a post of
[1:32:36] the temple of the lord
[1:32:38] ma and she was in bitterness of soul
[1:32:42] and prayed unto the lord and wept so
[1:32:47] i told you this is something that means
[1:32:48] a lot to me when i when i find a person
[1:32:51] that might be going through something
[1:32:52] about it where they're not able to have
[1:32:53] children
[1:32:54] amen uh one of the things that i watch
[1:32:57] not just how they come and ask for
[1:32:59] prayer
[1:33:00] i watch what they do after they get
[1:33:02] prayer
[1:33:04] amen amen we gotta watch hannah's
[1:33:07] response after hey man she was confident
[1:33:09] by her husband she went and began to
[1:33:12] pray herself
[1:33:14] glory to god when nobody else was
[1:33:16] looking she was praying
[1:33:18] amen i i believe if they had prayer
[1:33:21] meetings in her day
[1:33:23] hannah would have found herself amen at
[1:33:25] a prayer meeting
[1:33:27] if they said every tuesday night
[1:33:30] hannah would have been there every
[1:33:32] tuesday night if it was every other
[1:33:34] tuesday hannah would have been there
[1:33:38] because she's serious about what she
[1:33:40] wants
[1:33:41] she wants the reproach taken away and
[1:33:43] it's through prayer that these things
[1:33:45] change
[1:33:48] look at it
[1:33:49] she was in bitterness of soul and prayed
[1:33:50] unto the lord and wept soar
[1:33:53] and look at look at this and she vowed a
[1:33:55] foul
[1:33:57] i like this what because i don't it's
[1:33:59] not just you want a child what do you
[1:34:01] want a child for
[1:34:03] what's your purpose what you gonna do
[1:34:05] with the child
[1:34:06] amen
[1:34:08] some people want their children just so
[1:34:09] they can compete with other people
[1:34:12] it's the truth anyhow but that's not why
[1:34:15] god blesses your womb to have a child so
[1:34:17] you can compete with somebody else
[1:34:20] god wants you to raise that child in
[1:34:22] such a way that amen that they would
[1:34:24] they would they would have an impact on
[1:34:25] the kingdom of god
[1:34:27] oh hallelujah raise a singer that'll
[1:34:30] bring down the anointing raise a
[1:34:33] musician that'll bring down the
[1:34:35] anointing raise a preacher that'll
[1:34:37] preach the gospel
[1:34:40] raise a pastor's wife
[1:34:47] what you gonna do with this child
[1:34:49] what is your purpose for having a child
[1:34:53] she vowed a vow and said oh hallelujah
[1:34:56] i'm gonna tell you one thing if you can
[1:34:57] get rid of your selfish motive
[1:35:00] god can open up your womb
[1:35:04] oh hallelujah
[1:35:06] and she vowed to vow and said o lord of
[1:35:08] hosts
[1:35:09] if thou would indeed look on the
[1:35:11] affliction of thy
[1:35:12] handmaid and remember me
[1:35:15] and not forget thy handmaid
[1:35:18] but will give unto thy handmaid a man
[1:35:20] child not now she asked for a son
[1:35:23] then i will give him unto the lord all
[1:35:26] the days of his life
[1:35:28] and there shall no razor come upon his
[1:35:31] head he was going to be a nazarite
[1:35:34] amen
[1:35:35] she wanted him to be a christian let's
[1:35:36] put it that way
[1:35:38] amen no razors come upon his head and it
[1:35:41] came to pass
[1:35:43] as she continued praying before the lord
[1:35:46] that eli
[1:35:48] the priest now marked her mouth
[1:35:51] watch verse 13. now hannah she spake in
[1:35:54] her heart
[1:35:55] only her lips moved
[1:35:57] but her voice was not hurt now she's
[1:35:59] completely misunderstood
[1:36:02] look at her now i mean can you imagine a
[1:36:05] woman
[1:36:06] in church just a mouth
[1:36:08] moving ain't nothing coming out
[1:36:11] now you gonna think something wrong with
[1:36:13] her
[1:36:15] her mouth just move her
[1:36:18] what in the world is wrong with this
[1:36:20] lady
[1:36:21] but they don't understand in her heart i
[1:36:23] might be misunderstood
[1:36:27] but god sees
[1:36:31] god sees what is and not only god sees
[1:36:34] but god hears the thing that you can't
[1:36:36] hear priests god can hear it
[1:36:40] nobody else heard it but god heard it
[1:36:43] and it caused the priest to say
[1:36:45] something to her
[1:36:47] she might have looked crazy mama
[1:36:49] sometimes i know you look crazy to your
[1:36:51] children
[1:36:52] but god sees
[1:36:54] god understands god hears
[1:36:57] yeah you might be misunderstood but god
[1:36:59] sees it
[1:37:02] oh glory to god
[1:37:04] look at this look at this
[1:37:06] hannah she spoke
[1:37:08] she spake in her heart not only only her
[1:37:10] lips move but a voice was not her
[1:37:12] therefore eli thought she had been
[1:37:14] drunken
[1:37:16] misunderstood
[1:37:17] and eli said unto her how long without
[1:37:20] be drunken
[1:37:21] put away thine wine from thee
[1:37:25] and hannah answered and said
[1:37:27] no my lord
[1:37:29] i am a woman of a sorrowful spirit
[1:37:32] i have drunk neither wine nor strong
[1:37:35] drink
[1:37:36] but have poured out my soul before the
[1:37:38] lord
[1:37:39] count
[1:37:40] not thine handmade for a daughter of
[1:37:43] below that mean a worthless woman
[1:37:46] i'm not a worthless woman i might not
[1:37:48] have any children but i'm not a
[1:37:50] worthless woman
[1:37:54] oh hallelujah count not amen uh down
[1:37:57] handmade for a daughter below for out of
[1:38:00] the abundance of my complaint and grief
[1:38:02] i have spoken here the two
[1:38:05] then eli answered and said go in peace
[1:38:08] and the god of israel grant me thy
[1:38:10] petition that thou has asked of him and
[1:38:13] she said let thine handmaid find grace
[1:38:15] in that site so the woman went her way
[1:38:18] and did eat and her countenance was no
[1:38:21] more sad
[1:38:24] she was misunderstood
[1:38:26] but god saw her and in seeing her he
[1:38:29] calls the priest to say something to him
[1:38:31] now i need to understand the priest
[1:38:32] never prayed for
[1:38:34] all he did was speak a word over her and
[1:38:36] by speaking that word over her god
[1:38:38] blessed her womb and she had a son
[1:38:41] that son was a prophet who later came
[1:38:44] back and corrected that priest
[1:38:51] god sees you may be misunderstood
[1:38:54] but i'm here to tell you god sees when
[1:38:56] nobody else understands why you talking
[1:38:59] to yourself
[1:39:00] because mamas have to do that quite
[1:39:02] often hey man maybe maybe the child has
[1:39:04] walked into the bedroom maybe just some
[1:39:07] mom just
[1:39:08] just maybe on their knees praying
[1:39:10] couldn't understand why mama was doing
[1:39:11] that she might have been misunderstood
[1:39:13] but but god saw
[1:39:15] god saw and god god has a way of
[1:39:17] answering your prayer just in the time
[1:39:20] that you need them
[1:39:21] to answer your prayer
[1:39:24] i love god
[1:39:26] god sees
[1:39:28] here there's a little quote here i want
[1:39:29] to read on this amen before we go to our
[1:39:31] next character this is not jehovah jiren
[1:39:34] brother branham says this
[1:39:36] could you imagine
[1:39:38] what would happen in phoenix today if an
[1:39:39] old man the age of abraham and sarah
[1:39:41] would go down the doctor and say now
[1:39:42] doctor we want to make room at the
[1:39:43] hospital because we're going to have a
[1:39:45] child where the doctor would say uh
[1:39:47] excuse me
[1:39:48] says uh uh
[1:39:50] and would call the the
[1:39:52] psychopathic ward to come pick him up
[1:39:55] because he says something's wrong every
[1:39:57] man that's truly steps out and trusts
[1:39:59] god is misunderstood every man that
[1:40:02] truly steps out and trusts god is
[1:40:05] misunderstood i want to say every mama
[1:40:07] that truly steps out and trusts god is
[1:40:09] misunderstood i i i know i got some
[1:40:12] mamas in here that don't walk by faith
[1:40:13] many of these
[1:40:15] didn't know how they was going to do
[1:40:17] this and how does it go through that all
[1:40:18] i can tell you right now just look
[1:40:20] around
[1:40:22] did he do it
[1:40:24] and if he did it before he'll do it
[1:40:26] again
[1:40:29] you have to walk by faith in some
[1:40:31] situations
[1:40:32] oh glory to god
[1:40:34] hey hallelujah they say you wouldn't get
[1:40:36] the house but you got it they say you
[1:40:39] wouldn't get the car but you got it you
[1:40:41] had to do some things by faith but god
[1:40:43] provided
[1:40:46] hallelujah
[1:40:48] it's every every man that truly steps
[1:40:51] out and trusts god is misunderstood
[1:40:54] so that's right hannah at the temple she
[1:40:56] was praying and you know what even the
[1:40:58] priest thought she was drunk she didn't
[1:41:00] go up to shiloh up there to see what
[1:41:02] kind of hats the women wore or who had
[1:41:04] who had moved and all about the
[1:41:06] neighborhood talk she went up there for
[1:41:08] one purpose that was for god to take
[1:41:10] away her reproach
[1:41:12] and she prayed she didn't care what the
[1:41:14] people thought and they misunderstood
[1:41:16] her
[1:41:17] she said will you will you always be
[1:41:18] drunk she said i'm not drunk my lord but
[1:41:21] i'm praying god take away my reproach
[1:41:24] watch the prophet said the lord give to
[1:41:26] thee
[1:41:27] uh and she raised up and blessed the
[1:41:28] lord and went home and had the child
[1:41:30] that was all that's how simple it is
[1:41:33] taking god at his word oh isn't he
[1:41:36] wonderful i like that all we got to do
[1:41:38] is take god at his word if god is giving
[1:41:40] you a promise
[1:41:41] hold on to it
[1:41:44] if god is given you a promise
[1:41:47] hold on to it
[1:41:49] here it is um
[1:41:50] i read the script a little early and we
[1:41:52] want to pick her up
[1:41:54] oh my
[1:41:57] hagar was misunderstood
[1:42:02] and
[1:42:02] um
[1:42:04] as we were just reading there amen in
[1:42:06] the scripture a little earlier
[1:42:08] we have to kind of understand what it
[1:42:10] what happened you know with hagar
[1:42:14] she was
[1:42:15] she was just a slave
[1:42:18] and she was there working doing her job
[1:42:23] she was not
[1:42:26] um if i can use these terms she was not
[1:42:30] getting fresh
[1:42:32] with abram
[1:42:34] she wasn't doing that oh praise the lord
[1:42:38] she she wasn't dressing up in a certain
[1:42:41] garments to try to get abram's attention
[1:42:44] y'all understand what i'm saying
[1:42:46] she she she one you know
[1:42:48] uh
[1:42:49] you know she wasn't she wasn't
[1:42:50] presenting herself in such a way
[1:42:53] to try to get the man of god's
[1:42:54] attention that this was not her this was
[1:42:57] not what hagar was doing she was simply
[1:42:59] doing her job
[1:43:04] and while she's working there's a
[1:43:06] suggestion made in abraham's tenth
[1:43:10] sarah makes the suggestion
[1:43:12] she says now i know you want a son i
[1:43:14] know you want a child abraham but abram
[1:43:16] but i'm not able to produce a child why
[1:43:19] don't you take hagar my my handmaid and
[1:43:22] have a child through her now this is a
[1:43:24] suggestion that is being made
[1:43:27] amen so abraham agrees with it sarai
[1:43:30] agrees with it and remember i told you
[1:43:31] back in those days amen polygamy was
[1:43:33] accepted it's not accepted anymore so
[1:43:35] don't be talking about trying to have
[1:43:36] two wives
[1:43:38] glory to god
[1:43:40] and then actually if you was honest with
[1:43:41] yourself you can barely handle the one
[1:43:43] wife that you got
[1:43:47] ain't nobody gonna say amen but it's a
[1:43:49] truth in it high
[1:43:51] glory to god if you can barely handle
[1:43:53] the one you got so what you talk about
[1:43:55] two and three for
[1:43:58] glory to god
[1:44:00] but here you know uh everybody agrees
[1:44:03] and even even even hagar has to submit
[1:44:06] herself to this
[1:44:07] and she becomes a legal wife to abraham
[1:44:11] she goes amen with abraham and she
[1:44:13] conceives the child and after she
[1:44:16] conceives a child then we have
[1:44:18] a survive she gets a little jealous
[1:44:21] about this
[1:44:22] she said no i shouldn't know that she
[1:44:23] said no no i should never came up with
[1:44:25] this idea you know i'm sorry i did this
[1:44:27] abraham now you can't take it back now
[1:44:29] we don't we got a child on the way you
[1:44:31] can't you can't apologize nassera
[1:44:36] say well abraham's saying that and i
[1:44:37] just you know i i'm just i'm kind of
[1:44:39] putting in today's terms of god on my
[1:44:42] abraham after you heard sarai
[1:44:45] say uh sir i do to her what you think
[1:44:47] should be done now abraham said i'ma
[1:44:48] just step out of this
[1:44:53] now you're the one suggesting it
[1:44:55] you're the one came up with this plan
[1:44:57] and now you want me to go and do
[1:44:59] something with with
[1:45:01] you do whatever you think you need to do
[1:45:03] with it
[1:45:04] i'ma just step out of this
[1:45:08] but the bible says she dealt very
[1:45:09] harshly with
[1:45:11] and here comes uh hey god taking off
[1:45:14] running you can imagine what the
[1:45:15] conversation must have been like in this
[1:45:16] household she took off running just and
[1:45:19] and when she took out running she know
[1:45:21] where she was going
[1:45:23] pregnant
[1:45:24] expected don't know where she going and
[1:45:27] when she's out here in a desert place oh
[1:45:29] my think about where she's at and here
[1:45:32] the angel lord went looking for her oh
[1:45:34] glory to god
[1:45:36] the age of god went looking for this
[1:45:38] woman
[1:45:40] hey i'm here to tell you the age of god
[1:45:41] is looking for you
[1:45:43] and i don't care where you go the angel
[1:45:45] will find you
[1:45:48] and the angel will make the prayer come
[1:45:50] to pass
[1:45:54] hear the angel we're looking for saying
[1:45:56] hey god where you at what you doing and
[1:45:59] you know where you're going and where
[1:46:00] where where you come from and where
[1:46:01] you're going so i'm fleeing from a man
[1:46:04] from sarai my master's wife i'm fleeing
[1:46:07] from her
[1:46:08] even the angel knew what had happened in
[1:46:09] the house now i need you to understand
[1:46:11] what happened to hagar was nothing that
[1:46:14] she produced on her own it's nothing
[1:46:16] that she caused on her it was her
[1:46:18] actions that produced this
[1:46:22] she was absolutely
[1:46:24] misunderstood
[1:46:27] she was absolutely misunderstood but
[1:46:30] when the angels showed up in the desert
[1:46:32] place
[1:46:33] it showed that god understood
[1:46:35] even though sarai might not have
[1:46:38] understood
[1:46:39] god himself
[1:46:40] understood
[1:46:42] and god told hey god now go back and
[1:46:44] submit yourself
[1:46:46] some of you some of you young people
[1:46:48] need to go back and submit yourself to
[1:46:53] hey man mama maybe maybe maybe you maybe
[1:46:55] you different with some of the advice
[1:46:57] that she gave but now it's time to go
[1:46:58] back and submit yourself to some of that
[1:47:00] advice
[1:47:05] just go back go back and submit yourself
[1:47:08] because then you you know you can have a
[1:47:10] son you're gonna name him ishmael and
[1:47:11] he's gonna be a wild man and and we can
[1:47:14] take it from that angle we realized you
[1:47:15] know uh that he was a wild man and even
[1:47:17] today some of the stuff that the
[1:47:19] children is oh my goodness it's
[1:47:22] unbelievable unbelievable uh you know we
[1:47:25] and we we bear with some of those things
[1:47:27] even today from the children of israel
[1:47:29] but none nonetheless even in the midst
[1:47:31] of that can we see the supernatural god
[1:47:33] watching over
[1:47:36] hey god amen as she's carrying a seed of
[1:47:39] abraham
[1:47:42] i want to pick this up in genesis
[1:47:46] um
[1:47:47] i want to pick up another part of this
[1:47:49] in genesis 21.
[1:47:53] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:47:57] let's pick up this genesis 21 verse 9.
[1:48:00] now
[1:48:01] hagar has gone back home
[1:48:04] hagar has submitted herself
[1:48:08] to sarah
[1:48:11] but there comes years later
[1:48:13] she's also hagar's giving birth to
[1:48:15] ishmael but years later sarah finally
[1:48:18] gets a visit from the from from the lord
[1:48:20] herself and she conceives and she has a
[1:48:23] child she has isaac the true promised
[1:48:25] son we realize this
[1:48:27] hallelujah but i want to just kind of go
[1:48:29] a little further and look at this this
[1:48:30] statement was misunderstood hagar didn't
[1:48:32] do anything wrong nothing wrong nothing
[1:48:35] she was just working
[1:48:37] but here um we pick up in verse 9.
[1:48:43] sarah saw the son of hagar the egyptian
[1:48:46] but she had born unto abraham mocking
[1:48:51] wherefore she said unto abraham
[1:48:54] cast out this bonds woman
[1:48:56] and her son for the son of this bonds
[1:48:59] woman should not be heir with my son
[1:49:02] even with us
[1:49:05] sarah has another idea
[1:49:08] oh hallelujah y'all ain't gonna talk to
[1:49:10] me today but notice that sarai or sarah
[1:49:13] keep coming up with all these ideas
[1:49:18] okay i'm gonna tell y'all sarah
[1:49:20] something
[1:49:22] sarah sometimes you need to let your
[1:49:24] husband leave in certain situations
[1:49:28] i say amen to myself
[1:49:30] sarah you need to let your husband lead
[1:49:33] in some situations
[1:49:41] praise the lord
[1:49:42] but sarah keeps coming up with all these
[1:49:44] ideas
[1:49:46] amen watch it now watch watch what
[1:49:47] happens
[1:49:49] oh look at this look at this
[1:49:51] uh and the thing no verse 10 again
[1:49:54] wherefore senator abraham cast out this
[1:49:56] bonds woman and her son for the son of
[1:49:59] this bondwoman should not be heir with
[1:50:01] my son even with isaac watch it now
[1:50:04] and the thing was very grievous in
[1:50:07] abraham's sight because
[1:50:09] abraham did not want now look you don't
[1:50:11] put her out once before
[1:50:13] put out there and she come back home
[1:50:15] surrendered and submitted herself to you
[1:50:16] you you mishandled her you mistreated
[1:50:19] her you missed justin you did all these
[1:50:21] things and now you still come up want to
[1:50:22] put out again and i got a son
[1:50:25] abraham didn't want to do it now look at
[1:50:27] what happens look at what happens oh my
[1:50:30] god
[1:50:31] he says uh
[1:50:34] verse 11 god said unto abraham
[1:50:37] let it not be grievous in thy sight
[1:50:40] because of that let me tell you if god
[1:50:41] would not have spoken abraham he
[1:50:42] probably would not have done it
[1:50:44] he said let it not be grievous in thy
[1:50:46] sight because the lad and because of thy
[1:50:48] bondwoman and all that sarah have said
[1:50:50] unto thee hearken unto her voice for an
[1:50:53] isaac shall thy seed be called
[1:50:56] let's go on
[1:50:58] and also the son of the bondwoman will i
[1:51:00] make a nation because he is thy
[1:51:04] seed god makes a promise to him amen and
[1:51:07] abraham rose up early in the morning and
[1:51:09] took bread
[1:51:10] and a bottle of water and gave it up to
[1:51:13] hagar putting it on her shoulder oh my
[1:51:17] and the child sent her away and she
[1:51:19] departed and wandered in the wilderness
[1:51:21] of beersheba let me just just park let
[1:51:23] me just park there just for a sec can
[1:51:25] you imagine
[1:51:27] leaving home
[1:51:29] with a bottle of water
[1:51:31] and a piece of bread
[1:51:34] now i'm i'll just inject something else
[1:51:36] here
[1:51:37] at this moment
[1:51:40] oh hallelujah
[1:51:41] at this moment hagar
[1:51:44] just became a single mother
[1:51:52] she just lost all her resources
[1:51:56] she they lost everything that she had
[1:51:59] the the i mean the the the child's
[1:52:02] father's taking care of everything and
[1:52:04] because i have the child i mean he's
[1:52:06] taking care of me as well
[1:52:09] hallelujah i mean but at this moment she
[1:52:12] just became a single
[1:52:14] mama i'm gonna tell you something about
[1:52:16] single mamas i was just looking you know
[1:52:18] looking at some of the statistics on it
[1:52:20] amen and we have some single mothers
[1:52:22] amen by choice let me just give you all
[1:52:24] some of the stats on let me
[1:52:26] 11 million single-parent families in the
[1:52:29] u.s 11 million amen 80 percent of those
[1:52:33] 11 million families is headed by a
[1:52:35] single mother
[1:52:37] um 52 of the single mom family is
[1:52:40] never married
[1:52:44] 29 were divorced
[1:52:46] amen and and i wrote this down we know
[1:52:49] god doesn't like divorce but i want to
[1:52:50] encourage everyone amen to honor god's
[1:52:53] word oftentimes a person finds himself
[1:52:56] in a pretty bad position and they have
[1:52:58] to make tough decisions
[1:53:01] eighteen percent amen of women that that
[1:53:04] are any single single parent a single
[1:53:06] mother or homes 18 are widowed or
[1:53:08] separated
[1:53:09] they lose their resources and when this
[1:53:12] happens 23 percent of those families
[1:53:14] live in poverty
[1:53:16] here's another thing the median income
[1:53:19] for families by a single mother amen in
[1:53:21] 2020 and the median income was 49 000 a
[1:53:25] year amen well below when a married
[1:53:28] couple was together the median income
[1:53:30] was a hundred thousand dollars a year
[1:53:31] that means a single mother gonna make
[1:53:33] half as much
[1:53:36] as america
[1:53:37] you know what happens in a house like
[1:53:39] that the decisions get a lot tougher
[1:53:42] the children are impacted in ways that
[1:53:45] you never thought they'd be impacted
[1:53:47] mama can't do what amen what the the
[1:53:50] next door neighbor can do
[1:53:52] because they impacted and sometimes hey
[1:53:54] man sometimes it's by choice that single
[1:53:56] mothers are in conditions like that but
[1:53:58] other times they didn't they didn't make
[1:54:00] the choice they misunderstood
[1:54:04] i ain't choose to be like this hey
[1:54:06] doctor i ain't mad this was not i i had
[1:54:08] nothing to do with any of this
[1:54:10] and i can just imagine hagar in her
[1:54:13] prayer lord you told me
[1:54:16] you met me
[1:54:18] at a well and you told me to go back to
[1:54:22] sarah
[1:54:23] i went back
[1:54:25] god i raised my child i did everything
[1:54:28] you told me to do and here i'm kicked
[1:54:31] out again
[1:54:36] sometimes things get real difficult they
[1:54:38] get real tough
[1:54:40] mamas they get real tough for you i know
[1:54:42] i get tougher but i'm here to tell you
[1:54:43] that even when everybody else
[1:54:45] misunderstands
[1:54:47] god
[1:54:49] sees
[1:54:52] now i just love the way this this this
[1:54:55] i have a quote i'm not gonna i'm not i'm
[1:54:57] probably not gonna take time to read it
[1:54:58] but i'm gonna keep reading the scripture
[1:55:00] uh brother branham when he's bringing
[1:55:01] out this quote and it's in the message
[1:55:03] remember the lord i won't read it but it
[1:55:05] says that god met her at the well uh
[1:55:10] the lahara
[1:55:12] i can't even pronounce it right but uh
[1:55:14] but when you when we read it in genesis
[1:55:16] 16 that was the whale that she was met
[1:55:18] at but here brother brown was picking up
[1:55:21] the story amen in genesis uh genesis uh
[1:55:25] uh 21 and we're gonna see that you know
[1:55:27] after she goes through this another
[1:55:29] whale shows up watch this oh my
[1:55:33] oh my
[1:55:35] verse uh
[1:55:38] 15.
[1:55:40] here they are
[1:55:41] can you see the child out there with
[1:55:43] this bottle of water
[1:55:45] and bridge
[1:55:48] all the resources been cut off
[1:55:50] and this is what god told we know and we
[1:55:52] know we know the types that are in here
[1:55:54] we know that because the the seed of the
[1:55:56] bomb woman cannot be heir with a free
[1:55:57] woman oh my i we get we got that i can i
[1:56:00] can preach it from that angle but i
[1:56:01] didn't want to go there today i do want
[1:56:03] to say this
[1:56:05] that if god watched over
[1:56:08] the seat
[1:56:09] of the bond one
[1:56:15] if god provided
[1:56:17] for the seed
[1:56:19] of the bondwoman
[1:56:21] if god supernaturally visited the seed
[1:56:24] of the bondwoman
[1:56:26] what will god do for the free woman
[1:56:29] and we are represented as the free woman
[1:56:35] look at this
[1:56:36] verse
[1:56:38] 15
[1:56:40] and the water was spent in the bottle
[1:56:41] she cast the child under one of the
[1:56:43] shrubs
[1:56:46] she went and sat
[1:56:48] set her down over against him a good way
[1:56:51] off as it were a bull shot this is the
[1:56:53] mother going through
[1:56:56] for she said let me not see the death of
[1:56:59] the child
[1:57:00] she said over against him and lift up
[1:57:02] her voice
[1:57:04] and wept
[1:57:07] she's over there crying
[1:57:08] but watch this and god heard the voice
[1:57:11] of the lad now now in this situation
[1:57:13] brother random tells us it wasn't even
[1:57:15] god hearing hagar's voice
[1:57:18] but god heard ishmael's voice
[1:57:21] and the reason god heard ishmael's voice
[1:57:23] because ishmael was a seed of abraham
[1:57:27] oh god
[1:57:29] hey mama
[1:57:30] let me tell you something god's gonna
[1:57:32] hear your child's voice when they get to
[1:57:33] that spot where they need to break they
[1:57:35] get desperate don't worry god down hear
[1:57:37] they force because they belong to you
[1:57:43] sometimes you gotta wait for life just
[1:57:44] to present certain circumstances and and
[1:57:47] cause them to have to cry out to god the
[1:57:49] reason that you serving god the way you
[1:57:51] from because you met some of those
[1:57:52] circumstances in life where you can turn
[1:57:54] to nobody but jesus
[1:57:57] and that's what made you the woman you
[1:57:59] are today
[1:58:01] that's what made you a praying
[1:58:04] woman you weren't born that way life
[1:58:07] circumstances made you that way
[1:58:10] and the same god that met you at your
[1:58:13] well is able to meet them at their will
[1:58:20] heard the voice of the lad and the angel
[1:58:21] of god called to hagar out of heaven
[1:58:25] said to her what elith
[1:58:27] hagar fear not
[1:58:29] but god have heard the voice of the lad
[1:58:31] where he is
[1:58:32] arise lift up the lad and hold him in
[1:58:34] thy hand
[1:58:36] for i will make him a great nation god
[1:58:38] given her promise
[1:58:40] oh my look at this and god opened her
[1:58:42] eyes and she saw a well of water
[1:58:46] and she went and filled the bottle with
[1:58:48] water
[1:58:50] and gave the lad drink
[1:58:52] and god was with the lad and he grew and
[1:58:55] dwelt in the wilderness and became an
[1:58:57] archer
[1:58:58] and he dwelt in the wilderness of haram
[1:59:00] and his mother took him uh a wife out of
[1:59:02] land of people i just wanted to just
[1:59:03] kind of drop she was misunderstood
[1:59:06] she was misunderstood but every time
[1:59:08] that well would show up it was showing
[1:59:10] that god saw exactly what she was going
[1:59:11] through a well is your source of
[1:59:13] strength
[1:59:15] a well is your source of life
[1:59:18] god would always provide a well for
[1:59:20] hagar
[1:59:22] even though she was misunderstood i'm
[1:59:25] here to take and she is a bond woman
[1:59:28] if god provided for this bond woman
[1:59:30] mamas
[1:59:32] i mean the the you free women in here
[1:59:34] you you you you promised seed in here
[1:59:37] what what do you think god will do for
[1:59:38] you and for your loved ones
[1:59:41] or you don't have to doubt you might be
[1:59:43] misunderstood
[1:59:45] but god sees
[1:59:48] here i want to just kind of share just
[1:59:50] two other things here with you uh
[1:59:53] this is coming out of the message
[1:59:54] redemption and completeness
[1:59:56] enjoy redemption and completeness and
[1:59:58] joy
[2:00:00] i love this particular quote
[2:00:02] it says one time there was a woman in
[2:00:04] the bible by the name of hagar
[2:00:06] i'm thinking of her and i'm fixing the
[2:00:08] clothes
[2:00:10] time uh it closed the time there was a
[2:00:12] woman by the name of god she had a
[2:00:13] little baby she was turned down in the
[2:00:15] wilderness with one little cruise of
[2:00:17] water she fed the little thing all day
[2:00:20] long but the water gave out
[2:00:22] alone about the middle of the day and
[2:00:24] the little baby was screaming and crying
[2:00:25] his little lips was parched and his
[2:00:27] tongue was swelling a poor
[2:00:29] fearing mother what could she done
[2:00:32] she had seen every little place she
[2:00:34] could to find some water but no water
[2:00:36] could be found she couldn't stand to see
[2:00:38] the baby die so she laid it under a bush
[2:00:41] and went off about a boat shot and she
[2:00:44] knelt down and spanked to the rock
[2:00:48] and when she speak to the rock
[2:00:50] and angels speak back and said hey god
[2:00:54] what's that gushing out over there
[2:00:59] hey if you in a desert place just turn
[2:01:01] and go to the rock
[2:01:05] hallelujah
[2:01:07] thank god for that rock church
[2:01:10] amen hey god what's that gushing out
[2:01:12] over there there was a whole well full
[2:01:15] of water that's still running today
[2:01:18] after almost 4 000 years it's still
[2:01:21] running today the fountain which hagar
[2:01:23] there is still running today she spake
[2:01:25] to the rock and the rock brought the
[2:01:28] waters
[2:01:31] thank god she could go to iraq and now
[2:01:33] i'm telling you this is hagar
[2:01:35] who is a bondwoman
[2:01:38] just think about what god's gonna do for
[2:01:39] the free woman
[2:01:41] you might be misunderstood
[2:01:44] but god sees
[2:01:46] here i want to end
[2:01:47] my thought today with my favorite quotes
[2:01:50] out of mother's day
[2:01:53] we have many children today i i i want
[2:01:55] to say this before before i bring this
[2:01:57] up i'm going to paragraph 87 i believe
[2:01:59] in that
[2:02:00] uh
[2:02:01] we have we have many i want to say this
[2:02:03] about misunderstood but god sees
[2:02:05] one of the things that i wrote down is
[2:02:07] that this message
[2:02:09] that we believe
[2:02:11] has been misunderstood
[2:02:15] sometimes it's the way the message has
[2:02:17] been presented to people
[2:02:20] because it hasn't been presented
[2:02:21] properly
[2:02:23] and therefore the message becomes
[2:02:25] misunderstood
[2:02:27] sometimes the way we live the message
[2:02:30] causes people to misunderstand this
[2:02:33] message that we believe
[2:02:35] hallelujah amen but uh i want to just
[2:02:38] kind of show something here because
[2:02:40] many of us have loved ones that are
[2:02:43] in a situation today where maybe
[2:02:47] they're not in the in the way that
[2:02:49] you're raised one of the sisters just
[2:02:51] telling me and i just i just love this
[2:02:53] uh
[2:02:54] uh how god does things
[2:02:56] sister brown was telling me how her
[2:02:57] daughter got a job working got a really
[2:03:00] really good job and working
[2:03:01] and and her boss
[2:03:03] of boss that she's working with
[2:03:05] uh they got into a conversation they
[2:03:07] began to talk
[2:03:09] about church and
[2:03:10] and so sister be saying yeah i uh raise
[2:03:13] that brother west coast church in the in
[2:03:15] the boss city brother west coast
[2:03:18] you don't know no brother west coast
[2:03:20] yes i do know brother what's called
[2:03:22] raising this church you don't know
[2:03:24] brother wesko
[2:03:25] brother let's go over
[2:03:26] no you don't know brother what how would
[2:03:28] you know about brother west coast well
[2:03:30] we live right around the corner my dad
[2:03:31] just go to the church all the time here
[2:03:33] both of them both of them connected on
[2:03:35] the job that used to go to brother west
[2:03:37] coast church
[2:03:39] you think that's by coincidence
[2:03:41] i call it predestination
[2:03:45] sometimes you know our children are in
[2:03:47] situations and maybe they've made
[2:03:49] decisions
[2:03:50] and they made this decisions based on
[2:03:52] misunderstandings
[2:03:57] their minds are all tangled up
[2:04:00] you get to talking to them you can't get
[2:04:02] them to make no sense and you you can
[2:04:04] see it playing as day but for them it
[2:04:05] seemed to be just
[2:04:07] oh my goodness i i can't see it
[2:04:10] they they they they need their minds
[2:04:13] untangled now let me tell you something
[2:04:14] you can't do it
[2:04:17] but you can pray
[2:04:20] i believe uh jesus told peter to say
[2:04:22] flesh and blood have not revealed these
[2:04:25] things unto you but my father in heaven
[2:04:28] has all you got to do just stay with it
[2:04:31] god will bring them to it you might be
[2:04:33] misunderstood but god sees
[2:04:37] god sees and i don't care what they get
[2:04:40] themselves entangled with
[2:04:42] i don't care what religion they go
[2:04:44] trying to follow if you sold the seeds
[2:04:46] of this word and their life somehow some
[2:04:50] way they got to come right back to what
[2:04:52] was sown
[2:04:54] hey i feel good today church
[2:04:57] they got to come back to it i don't care
[2:04:59] how deep in the world they go
[2:05:02] you can't separate yourself from what
[2:05:03] was sown inside of you
[2:05:08] and mamas i just love on mother's day
[2:05:10] giving y'all this promise
[2:05:13] here out of this quote
[2:05:15] mother's day then as we see him
[2:05:19] we will not be as we are now
[2:05:23] we'll know how to love him more
[2:05:26] will not stand back with a little fear
[2:05:28] because we'll be like him well
[2:05:31] we'll uh he will be more of a relative
[2:05:33] to us than he is now we'll understand
[2:05:36] him better because we're so far away in
[2:05:38] the mortal bodies
[2:05:40] then we'll have a body like his glorious
[2:05:42] body we'll know how to worship him
[2:05:46] and when we see what the presence of his
[2:05:48] being has done to us
[2:05:49] changed us
[2:05:52] the old back young
[2:05:54] all the deformed straight now oh we'll
[2:05:57] understand then why his power healed us
[2:06:01] the questions
[2:06:04] that's been in our mind
[2:06:06] how can he do it
[2:06:08] what with this somehow mysteriously
[2:06:12] they'll fade away
[2:06:14] the knots that's been tied in the back
[2:06:16] of our minds
[2:06:18] will it be this how could it be somehow
[2:06:20] another majestic fingers
[2:06:24] would just untangle unravel those knots
[2:06:27] and it'll all fade into one big crown of
[2:06:30] love
[2:06:31] i like to give that to the mothers on
[2:06:33] mother's day i'm gonna keep going in
[2:06:34] this pope but i like you to understand
[2:06:36] somehow you don't have to try to explain
[2:06:37] it all you gotta try to break it down
[2:06:39] gotta break it down let majestic fingers
[2:06:42] god you told me
[2:06:44] you told me somehow majestic fingers was
[2:06:46] gonna unravel or not so god you do what
[2:06:48] only you can do
[2:06:52] then we shall see him
[2:06:54] then we shall be like him
[2:06:57] hallelujah
[2:06:59] then we shall worship him then we shall
[2:07:01] see mother as god wants her
[2:07:04] mother
[2:07:06] would not be complete there
[2:07:09] without her
[2:07:10] family oh come on somebody
[2:07:14] you know you know we've had some of our
[2:07:16] mothers have gone on to be with the lord
[2:07:18] and and we can stand there amen at the
[2:07:21] at the homegoing service and we can say
[2:07:23] oh i know my mama was a christian and i
[2:07:26] know my mama did this and i know my mama
[2:07:28] did that and i remember my uncle my
[2:07:30] cousin i should say call him uncle but
[2:07:32] he was at my grandmother's funeral and
[2:07:34] he heard he heard everybody just talk
[2:07:35] about how my grandmother was a stink my
[2:07:37] grandmother my grandfather and you know
[2:07:39] he was just he was just you know just
[2:07:41] just sitting there listening and uh he
[2:07:43] had to be honest with himself
[2:07:45] and uh you know everybody said no we're
[2:07:46] gonna see her again we're gonna see
[2:07:48] again she was digitally went to the
[2:07:50] other side we're gonna say now i know
[2:07:52] the way i'm living right now i will not
[2:07:55] see her again
[2:08:01] and it's time for us to be honest with
[2:08:02] ourselves the way you're living right
[2:08:04] now mama was to go on you ain't gonna
[2:08:06] see you again the way you live it
[2:08:11] but i love that somehow god got to until
[2:08:13] these these knots
[2:08:16] because look at this look at this look
[2:08:17] at this
[2:08:19] mother would not be complete
[2:08:22] there without her family
[2:08:25] it was it just happened wouldn't be
[2:08:27] happening
[2:08:29] if all mama's children weren't there
[2:08:32] you know how mama feel when all the
[2:08:33] children come together here at home now
[2:08:35] what you think she'll feel like when she
[2:08:36] gets to the other side
[2:08:40] mother
[2:08:42] oh come on somebody we we going beyond
[2:08:45] just going to church on mother's day
[2:08:48] oh that's just part of it but but but we
[2:08:50] talk about making it to the other side
[2:08:54] that that's what this whole thing is all
[2:08:55] about mama want to see her children make
[2:08:58] it to the other side
[2:09:02] mama want to see your children die with
[2:09:04] an assurance
[2:09:06] that is going to be all right
[2:09:13] mother would not be complete there
[2:09:17] without her family
[2:09:20] because the greatest time of all her
[2:09:22] life
[2:09:24] is to see the children around the table
[2:09:28] oh
[2:09:29] now can i can i can i'm gonna just i'ma
[2:09:31] just inject i'm almost done
[2:09:33] not just around the natural table
[2:09:37] mama like to see her children sitting
[2:09:40] around the spiritual table
[2:09:44] and then when we get to the natural
[2:09:46] table we can talk about the spiritual
[2:09:48] things that we heard
[2:09:57] no mama just don't want to talk about
[2:09:59] what happened in the news
[2:10:01] and this person died can you believe
[2:10:03] that mama no no no mama wanna talk about
[2:10:05] your soul mama when i was in church
[2:10:07] today god spoke this to me and mama i
[2:10:10] was praying and this happened man that
[2:10:13] changes the whole dynamics of the
[2:10:15] conversation when you're sitting
[2:10:17] together
[2:10:20] hey my mama don't have to what mama
[2:10:22] don't have to avoid talking about god
[2:10:24] around you
[2:10:26] oh y'all ain't gonna preach with me
[2:10:29] mama you talk too much about god no you
[2:10:31] misunderstand mama's trying to create an
[2:10:33] atmosphere for god to be able to come
[2:10:36] down
[2:10:40] oh god i don't have to just meet you at
[2:10:42] the church god can meet you in your
[2:10:43] house
[2:10:44] if you just begin to talk about
[2:10:53] mother
[2:10:54] will not be complete there without her
[2:10:56] family because the greatest time of all
[2:10:57] her life is to see her children around
[2:10:59] the teeth
[2:11:01] and all of them healthy
[2:11:04] and happy
[2:11:08] and see her pour the coffee
[2:11:10] or whatever she does
[2:11:13] and fix it sup but let me tell you
[2:11:15] if you
[2:11:16] you you you let everybody just doing
[2:11:18] what they need to do
[2:11:19] boy mom ain't got no problem getting
[2:11:20] that kitchen and whipping up something
[2:11:24] she'll put it together
[2:11:27] when you making mama happy she'll make
[2:11:28] you happy
[2:11:33] but
[2:11:33] my mom my mom kind of retired a little
[2:11:35] bit
[2:11:37] every once in a while
[2:11:39] especially come thanksgiving time we
[2:11:40] know what to expect
[2:11:42] mama going into the kitchen
[2:11:45] she gonna bring out
[2:11:47] some of the sweet potato pies
[2:11:50] gonna bring out a carrot cake
[2:11:53] german chocolate cake
[2:11:55] come on
[2:11:57] they don't know nothing about rutabagas
[2:12:00] people don't know people don't eat
[2:12:01] rutabagas no more but mama would go and
[2:12:04] find herself some rutabagas
[2:12:09] call it greeks
[2:12:11] right and my mama just had to wait
[2:12:13] sometime she don't even know if
[2:12:15] everybody's coming
[2:12:17] but mama was still thrown down in the
[2:12:18] kitchen and there's something about kids
[2:12:21] when they know mama done cooked
[2:12:25] you find you you make time to get by
[2:12:28] mama's house
[2:12:29] to eat a little something
[2:12:31] save some room to get a little something
[2:12:33] what mama could because she don't cook
[2:12:35] all the time like that if mama loves it
[2:12:37] when the family comes together
[2:12:42] but not just natural reunions
[2:12:46] mama want them to be ready for a
[2:12:47] spiritual
[2:12:50] reunion i'll tell you i've taken some
[2:12:52] mamas you might have been misunderstood
[2:12:54] along the journey
[2:12:55] but god saw it
[2:12:57] and god is creating a well springing up
[2:12:59] a well in the midst of this wilderness
[2:13:03] they'll be sustained
[2:13:05] sometimes mama want to see it before she
[2:13:07] died but if she don't see it before she
[2:13:10] die
[2:13:12] mama don't be there
[2:13:14] god sees
[2:13:24] i like to see the children around the
[2:13:25] table all of them help him happy and to
[2:13:27] see her pour the coffee whatever she
[2:13:29] does and fix his supper
[2:13:31] and her her and dad just sat down
[2:13:36] that's the
[2:13:38] happiest time in mama's life
[2:13:42] see y'all see her kid is all at home
[2:13:44] i've watched my mama just kind of and
[2:13:46] it's just something all all the all the
[2:13:48] cooking i even watched my wife do it now
[2:13:50] uh you know when your kids are there and
[2:13:52] everybody's at home you kind of take a
[2:13:54] lot of things for granted
[2:13:56] but man when they get up and start

[2:14:12] this house for these kids
[2:14:15] glory to god but it's something about
[2:14:17] when the kids come home
[2:14:21] it's something like
[2:14:24] when the kids
[2:14:27] come home
[2:14:29] spiritually
[2:14:31] it's something bite
[2:14:33] when the kids

[2:15:44] some things in life but the prophet said
[2:15:46] then

[2:15:57] then we'll understand
[2:16:00] let's pray
[2:16:06] lord jesus
[2:16:12] god as we can just look at scripture and
[2:16:13] see
[2:16:15] these different women that have been
[2:16:17] misunderstood
[2:16:20] and are praying for a son
[2:16:22] the priest could not understand why she
[2:16:24] was there talking to herself
[2:16:27] she was in
[2:16:28] sinship prayer believing god that you
[2:16:30] would give her a child and she received
[2:16:32] the promise from the priests and walked
[2:16:34] away and not only did you bless her with
[2:16:36] samuel the prophet
[2:16:38] but oh god you're blessed with so many
[2:16:40] other children
[2:16:42] lord uh you're that type of god
[2:16:47] father as we look here at hagar a woman
[2:16:50] she did nothing wrong she was just
[2:16:51] working
[2:16:54] and god she became part of all this but
[2:16:55] lord in the midst of all of that all of
[2:16:57] it god you had a purpose and a plan for
[2:17:00] it
[2:17:01] and you provided for a bond woman how
[2:17:04] our faith should increase today
[2:17:07] to know that they're even
[2:17:09] when we look over the new testament
[2:17:11] there is no promise there for the bond
[2:17:12] woman he had to be cast out
[2:17:14] because the seed of the bondwoman is not
[2:17:17] heir with the free woman we are
[2:17:19] represented as that free woman
[2:17:22] oh god if you would make a way for a
[2:17:24] bond woman what will you do for us
[2:17:27] so i pray every mother would leave
[2:17:28] strengthened and encouraged
[2:17:31] god to know that uh

[2:17:36] no matter what they're going through
[2:17:38] lord
[2:17:39] no matter what their families are going
[2:17:41] through god that they can hold you to
[2:17:42] every word that you spoke

[2:17:48] fail
[2:17:51] thank you that we serve a god
[2:17:55] that sees
[2:17:56] a god that knows

[2:18:09] i pray your blessed lord upon each and
[2:18:11] every one

[2:18:17] happen father even after the service
