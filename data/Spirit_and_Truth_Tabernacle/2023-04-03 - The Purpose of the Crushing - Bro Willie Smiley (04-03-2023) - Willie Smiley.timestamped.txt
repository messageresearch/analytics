[51:48] [Music]
[51:54] let's just get our Bibles out this
[51:57] morning it's good to be in the service
[51:59] of the Living God this morning it's just
[52:01] good to be back um home we're going to
[52:04] read from a couple of places in the
[52:06] scripture uh
[52:08] uh Genesis chapter 8 and then also
[52:11] Philippians chapter four we want to
[52:14] remember brother Jack and the saints
[52:16] that went up to Virginia to uh be a part
[52:20] of the
[52:21] ceremony there with Jack's uncle
[52:25] being the president of Hampton
[52:27] University so remember them in prayer I
[52:31] remember Uh Kevin in prayer he'll be
[52:34] traveling his first little trip uh by
[52:38] itself he went to Las Vegas and uh just
[52:41] remember him in prayer I just I've been
[52:44] having a real tough time so y'all just
[52:47] continue to keep me in prayer and you
[52:51] know you you know your children gonna
[52:54] grow up
[52:56] and uh
[52:58] you I guess you want them to stay young
[53:01] where you kind of you know keep them and
[53:05] like he told me we got to talking and he
[53:08] said well Dad you just you just want to
[53:11] just keep everybody in a little box
[53:14] you know it's like I don't really want
[53:18] to keep you in a box but I just like to
[53:20] see folks doing things a certain way and
[53:24] uh but you know as they get older you
[53:28] kind of lose that grip that control and
[53:31] you just kind of have to let them spread
[53:34] their wings even and it makes you do a
[53:37] lot of praying I tell you that you might
[53:40] miss a meal you might miss some sleep
[53:43] you know in the process because you know
[53:46] uh uh they don't they don't
[53:49] they don't perceive things on the same
[53:51] level that you perceive from being a
[53:53] parent
[53:54] I am a parent I'm not I'm not a child so
[53:59] you know and being a minister and being
[54:01] in the streets I just I just don't look
[54:03] at things the same way a lot of times
[54:05] that everybody else looks at things
[54:08] y'all bear with me a minute uh but uh I
[54:11] told him I said you know what I just
[54:13] pray that I'm I'm around when all of
[54:16] y'all have children
[54:18] you know so I could sit back on the wall
[54:22] and just watch how y'all raise y'all
[54:24] children you know I hope uh that they do
[54:27] a better job than I did
[54:31] I'm put up my quotes
[54:33] right uh because it's a lot that goes
[54:36] along
[54:38] um uh with raising children and and for
[54:41] one thing I have to say you know I'm a
[54:43] Christian parent
[54:46] I'm a Christian parent and so I'ma
[54:49] definitely do things uh from a Biblical
[54:52] standpoint and if people may not like it
[54:55] I don't care
[54:57] as as long as I know where I'm standing
[54:59] at in the world you know what people's
[55:02] thoughts and what how people perceive
[55:04] things it don't even bother me at this
[55:06] stage let me move on from that I didn't
[55:09] come to say that I do have a message
[55:11] this morning but y'all just pray for for
[55:14] my little brood and trust that uh God
[55:17] will get everybody on track
[55:20] amen Genesis chapter 4 but let's
[55:23] remember brother Jack he's he's been
[55:26] real busy and we bring greetings from uh
[55:29] South Carolina on last week uh we
[55:32] preached for brother Simmons and brother
[55:34] blue
[55:36] had a had a just a real wonderful outing
[55:39] and uh just remembers and prayer at the
[55:42] end of the month we supposed to be going
[55:43] to Georgia so uh just keep us in prayer
[55:47] if you don't see me I ain't backsliding
[55:50] I ain't quit
[55:53] if I do I y'all gonna be the first
[55:55] people I let know but as of now I'm
[55:58] still in the fight
[56:00] amen uh we still still pressing our
[56:03] battles uh Genesis chapter 8 we want to
[56:07] read the 20th verse there
[56:12] uh from the 20th verse if you have it
[56:14] say amen and Noah building an altar unto
[56:18] the Lord and took every
[56:20] every clean beast and every clean foul
[56:24] and offered burnt offerings
[56:26] uh uh on the altar
[56:30] and the Lord smelled a sweet
[56:32] a sweet Savior and the Lord said in his
[56:36] heart I will not again curse the ground
[56:38] anymore for man's sake for the
[56:42] imagination of man's Hearts is evil
[56:45] uh from his youth neither will I again
[56:48] Smite any more everything living as I
[56:52] have done while the Earth remained in
[56:55] seed time and harvest and cold and and
[56:58] heat and summer and winter and the day
[57:01] and night should not cease now let us
[57:04] look at another place in the book of
[57:06] Philippians
[57:09] just like to say we've we've appreciated
[57:11] the sermons that we've been hearing from
[57:15] our ministering Brothers
[57:17] uh
[57:19] uh we we missed the young Brothers
[57:23] and I had to go online to to get the
[57:28] sermons but I appreciate amen hearing
[57:31] the the younger group of ministers
[57:34] ministers uh Philippians chapter 4 verse
[57:39] 19 it says but my God shall have to
[57:42] apply all your needs according to his
[57:44] riches and in Glory by Jesus Christ
[57:49] amen let us buy our heads
[57:51] gracious father we just thank you this
[57:54] morning for your Amazing Grace and and
[57:56] how you brought us the thus far this
[57:58] morning and we just trust and depend on
[58:01] you this morning to see us through help
[58:04] us to just yield ourselves to the holy
[58:08] spirit that he could use the vessel I'm
[58:10] a man I'm full of uh uh weakness but
[58:14] Lord I'm strong in you
[58:16] we pray that you just have your way
[58:18] bless the Saints as they uh travel
[58:22] wherever they might be Virginia and my
[58:25] son on his way home from Vegas and uh
[58:28] just continue to have your way in Jesus
[58:31] name we pray amen amen you may be seated
[58:35] um I would like to just use that as a
[58:36] little subject this morning as we just
[58:39] get settled uh the purpose of the
[58:43] crushing
[58:44] the purpose of the crushing
[58:48] um I just maybe want to start with a
[58:51] little side note this morning uh as as
[58:55] we we think about purpose for just a
[58:59] second as we just kind of build this
[59:01] morning uh
[59:03] I'd just like for us to understand some
[59:05] of the purpose of humanity and the
[59:07] purpose of God is totally totally
[59:10] different
[59:11] right and a lot of times you know you
[59:14] hear from people that's supposed to be
[59:16] uh worshiping and serving God you know
[59:19] to people a lot of times things in God
[59:23] don't matter
[59:25] right but but one of the things that
[59:28] that
[59:29] um I realize if if God has it in his
[59:33] word it's for a reason
[59:35] and it's it's it's I think it's
[59:37] essential things aren't something that
[59:40] we could push to one side and and just
[59:43] kind of and and I think that's what got
[59:46] the the world in in the condition that
[59:49] is in the religious world or the church
[59:51] world is we we we cultivate we we bring
[59:56] our own or we inject the word with our
[1:00:01] own personal theologies and meanings and
[1:00:04] things of that nature especially in the
[1:00:07] day that we're living in right you you
[1:00:09] could you could just see a deviation
[1:00:12] from from almost scripture all together
[1:00:16] uh we we I'm reminded that when Jesus
[1:00:20] Christ came on the scene uh the son of
[1:00:24] man Ministry uh one of the big rebukes
[1:00:27] he had was that it was just so much
[1:00:31] traditions and things that weren't even
[1:00:33] biblical
[1:00:35] that weren't that weren't even biblical
[1:00:38] that showed how the people had drifted
[1:00:41] we could we could see it we could see it
[1:00:43] down through the history of the church
[1:00:46] how the church drifted away from you
[1:00:50] know Christ which Christ is the word is
[1:00:53] that right and so I appreciate this
[1:00:56] morning God sending us a messenger to uh
[1:01:01] get us back to what's what's reality
[1:01:05] was was normal
[1:01:07] back to the precepts of God is that
[1:01:10] right
[1:01:11] Oh Glory to his wonderful name so you
[1:01:14] know
[1:01:14] um
[1:01:15] when when when when God implements
[1:01:18] something or God put something in play
[1:01:20] it's necessary
[1:01:22] it's necessary that you got a carburetor
[1:01:25] uh fuel injection in your car right
[1:01:30] amen those those things are necessary so
[1:01:35] this morning you know you you place
[1:01:37] little things in the into just the the
[1:01:40] heart and minds of people as as we cut
[1:01:43] continue to grow and mature in the
[1:01:46] things of God and and we hear the
[1:01:48] ministry we're here you know I I
[1:01:50] Shepherd uh make reference to things
[1:01:53] don't discount these things it's nothing
[1:01:56] because it's it's all necessary
[1:02:01] y'all keep that word it's it's all
[1:02:03] necessary and and it and it's all for a
[1:02:07] purpose
[1:02:08] to to fulfill God's purpose see I'm here
[1:02:13] this morning and you're here this
[1:02:15] morning to fulfill the purpose of God
[1:02:19] something that that's greater than all
[1:02:22] of our our Ambitions and different
[1:02:24] things that that you know we imagine and
[1:02:27] all of you know we go to school and we
[1:02:29] do all the types of things that we do
[1:02:31] but fulfilling to per the purpose of God
[1:02:34] man that that's on a greater scale
[1:02:39] right to think that you know what I was
[1:02:42] called out of the world
[1:02:44] and into Christ
[1:02:46] redemption in two places you just don't
[1:02:49] come out you got to go in somewhere
[1:02:52] right are you gonna be left out of where
[1:02:54] you're supposed to be going
[1:02:57] right you got it you gotta get in Christ
[1:02:59] not not just religion we don't just
[1:03:02] preach We Don't Preach the message as a
[1:03:05] religion
[1:03:06] or or some denominational something
[1:03:09] right we we preach the word of God to
[1:03:13] try to make sure that you're you're in
[1:03:15] in Jesus Christ and that and that's got
[1:03:17] to be the thing is that right
[1:03:20] amen you gotta get in Christ
[1:03:23] I believe that that's the thing that you
[1:03:25] know our Prophet uh was trying to do
[1:03:28] because if our approach is is just you
[1:03:32] know I'm identified with a certain
[1:03:34] church and I go here and I go there and
[1:03:37] I'm not in Christ
[1:03:39] you're not gonna make no Rapture like
[1:03:41] that
[1:03:42] is that right so when when we think
[1:03:45] about y'all just pray for me but when we
[1:03:49] think about the message of the hour
[1:03:51] right we we've got to keep in mind what
[1:03:55] what it what what's its purpose
[1:03:58] what is purpose has been I'm gonna move
[1:04:01] on for this in a minute but I'm just
[1:04:03] trying to get out out the way what is
[1:04:05] purpose has has meant to us as as uh
[1:04:09] believers
[1:04:10] right not to just be identified with
[1:04:13] just a random group of people but it's
[1:04:17] been a call out amen of the world and to
[1:04:20] get us into Christ now this is I guess
[1:04:22] kind of a Prelude because we know Easter
[1:04:24] is coming up and uh uh so I thought this
[1:04:28] a pre-easter Easter uh message to just
[1:04:32] kind of uh
[1:04:34] get out thinking uh going to a certain
[1:04:39] uh spot right now the the word the word
[1:04:44] crushing
[1:04:45] right is is rejection
[1:04:50] spiritual uh Devastation to squeeze or
[1:04:55] to force by pressure so as to alter or
[1:05:01] criticize him and and I want to I want
[1:05:04] to say something here too as I get
[1:05:07] started
[1:05:08] crushing is necessary
[1:05:12] right Crossing crushing crushing has
[1:05:16] value
[1:05:17] sometimes sometimes I think we we
[1:05:20] misunderstand we misunderstand God we we
[1:05:24] we don't fully understand the the
[1:05:28] process of growth
[1:05:31] right
[1:05:33] we think gross is just growth is just
[1:05:36] about you know just a happy good luck I
[1:05:41] wish it was that way Church
[1:05:44] but but sometimes we encounter
[1:05:48] devastating situations
[1:05:51] right uh uh spiritual altering situation
[1:05:57] naturally altered being being squeezed
[1:06:01] sometimes being rejected right but it's
[1:06:05] necessary
[1:06:07] because one of the things I'm reminded
[1:06:09] of brother Branham say character is a
[1:06:12] victory
[1:06:14] is that right
[1:06:16] amen glory to God so so you know
[1:06:19] sometimes a man it God watch this God
[1:06:24] sees a certain thing is necessary
[1:06:29] if I look at my life sometimes and I
[1:06:32] have been right I just sit back and I'm
[1:06:35] like
[1:06:37] what's this all about
[1:06:40] why why why you know but Bob say don't
[1:06:43] think it's strange but but sometimes
[1:06:46] when when you look at your life and you
[1:06:48] look at where you're at and you you look
[1:06:50] at your trials and the things that you
[1:06:52] you you go through you you gotta keep in
[1:06:56] mind right the purpose of God and God's
[1:07:00] seeing what you're going through as
[1:07:04] necessary
[1:07:06] because I'm quite sure you know Joe we
[1:07:09] know scripturally job was doing good
[1:07:13] job was wealthy job had a big name right
[1:07:17] Joe could walk through the community you
[1:07:21] know with his and then all of a sudden
[1:07:23] right his world was turned upside down
[1:07:27] and I'm quite sure from an intellectual
[1:07:31] standpoint even looking at his life
[1:07:33] right he probably figured like what you
[1:07:36] know when
[1:07:37] this one coming in with this report and
[1:07:40] this one coming in with this reporting
[1:07:41] desperately I'm quite sure he felt
[1:07:44] overwhelmed
[1:07:47] right and I'm quite I know for a certain
[1:07:50] of certainty he wasn't there in the
[1:07:53] conversation when when when God turned
[1:07:56] the devil loose on him because he would
[1:07:58] have been waited wait a way to wait a
[1:08:00] way to wait a waiter wait a wait a
[1:08:02] minute
[1:08:03] is there anybody else
[1:08:07] come on y'all know what I'm talking
[1:08:08] about we all haven't been there you know
[1:08:11] we didn't all had that why me moments
[1:08:14] y'all are preached with me I'm gonna
[1:08:16] have to put off my jacket I see now
[1:08:18] Y'all Gonna Make Me work cause y'all
[1:08:21] look like y'all gonna stare but I ain't
[1:08:22] gonna let you stare at me this morning
[1:08:24] for for an hour
[1:08:26] Y'all Gonna even preach so y'all gonna
[1:08:28] take it on the chin
[1:08:31] right not just a sense of humor
[1:08:34] okay I'm getting a little warm with that
[1:08:36] Jay you know
[1:08:38] you know you get to preaching you start
[1:08:40] getting nervous
[1:08:42] right but I'm just quite I'm quite sure
[1:08:45] you know with with the things that he
[1:08:47] was facing
[1:08:49] in his mind you know and I say this
[1:08:52] church don't think just because
[1:08:53] somebody's going through you know this
[1:08:56] this is our thing around church he must
[1:08:58] have did something she must have did
[1:09:00] some job didn't do anything but God saw
[1:09:03] it necessary to crush him
[1:09:07] right God that's powerful statement God
[1:09:10] saw that it was necessary to crush him
[1:09:14] right to to bring out
[1:09:18] something that was was was in him so it
[1:09:22] the crushing
[1:09:25] is necessary
[1:09:28] right
[1:09:30] see that that that's a benefit
[1:09:34] right come on Church
[1:09:36] when when we look at our life right
[1:09:39] and and and you know we see where where
[1:09:42] we're going right and and we we're going
[1:09:45] through things and we feel like you know
[1:09:47] you're being rejected right you you your
[1:09:51] place you're placed in these positions
[1:09:53] and places where you're being criticized
[1:09:56] and and and the pressure that we feel
[1:09:59] know that it's it's it's beneficial to
[1:10:03] you
[1:10:05] right amen and sometimes it just takes
[1:10:08] God to reveal to you why he's allowing
[1:10:13] you to go through this but it is
[1:10:16] necessary
[1:10:17] the flesh might say it's not necessary
[1:10:20] you know y'all know you you know how
[1:10:22] folk folk when they think about
[1:10:24] Christianity and how bad things happen
[1:10:27] to good people it is it ain't nobody
[1:10:30] good
[1:10:31] right that's none of us that good
[1:10:35] come on church I know y'all looking good
[1:10:37] this morning you probably fix yourself
[1:10:40] up but but at the core apart from God
[1:10:43] ain't none of us all that good
[1:10:46] right what what makes us what we are is
[1:10:50] that Christ lives in US
[1:10:52] because you know what if you take if you
[1:10:55] take the God out of us we'll do things
[1:10:58] that we wouldn't even want nobody to
[1:11:00] even know
[1:11:02] we'll do things in the shadows that we
[1:11:05] wouldn't even want nobody to know is
[1:11:07] that right
[1:11:08] glory to God come on church and probably
[1:11:11] we'd undone things that man we don't
[1:11:13] want nobody to know
[1:11:16] right so so you know it ain't it ain't
[1:11:19] our goodness it's not our righteousness
[1:11:21] it's Christ
[1:11:24] right it's Christ it's Christ alone it's
[1:11:28] Christ that makes us who we are
[1:11:31] right
[1:11:33] uh
[1:11:35] let's let's kind of uh continue to move
[1:11:38] move along right one of one of the
[1:11:41] things we we got to keep in mind
[1:11:44] um
[1:11:46] we we know that God brought the world
[1:11:49] forth in in a perfection
[1:11:53] right everything was in a Harmony
[1:11:56] everything was in a Oneness everything
[1:11:58] was in divine order boy I tell you
[1:12:02] whoa we don't hardly know nothing about
[1:12:05] that because our eyes a lot of time is
[1:12:08] chaotic and
[1:12:10] and no order and it just takes the Holy
[1:12:13] Spirit to
[1:12:15] uh balance this out that's I don't care
[1:12:17] who you are and how long you've been
[1:12:19] serving whether you're a preacher things
[1:12:21] of that nature it still takes the Holy
[1:12:25] Spirit to bring balance
[1:12:30] is that right listen to church this is
[1:12:33] just a gift y'all don't I mean you paid
[1:12:36] me some mind but you don't pay me no
[1:12:38] mind right because I'm a human being
[1:12:40] right and and my gift is just to express
[1:12:44] something that that'll help us on the
[1:12:46] journey that we on right but but you
[1:12:50] know what I understand the crushing this
[1:12:53] morning
[1:12:54] I'm not just preaching y'all an
[1:12:56] intellectual level we're gonna go
[1:12:57] somewhere this morning right I ain't got
[1:13:00] there I don't want to get ahead of
[1:13:01] myself but but
[1:13:03] we know it went from this masterpiece
[1:13:07] this perf uh perfect State this the
[1:13:11] state of innocent to to uh a state of of
[1:13:16] Chaos
[1:13:19] right uh uh uh I mean let's look at the
[1:13:23] Scripture it had got so bad now this is
[1:13:26] bad to where God just wanted to wipe the
[1:13:29] whole thing out
[1:13:31] for which God repents that he ever made
[1:13:34] man that's pretty rough
[1:13:37] we talked we talking about a sovereign
[1:13:39] God uh an infinite God that that that uh
[1:13:44] knew all things right that's the thing
[1:13:47] that makes an innocent that he knew the
[1:13:49] condition that it would get in but when
[1:13:52] it got in that condition he looked at it
[1:13:54] like man
[1:13:57] I made that
[1:14:00] Glory I can't I created
[1:14:03] no he didn't I mean what he created in
[1:14:07] the beginning it was Perfection but
[1:14:09] after the fall and the second Covenant
[1:14:12] uh uh through through you know uh man
[1:14:16] and woman coming together
[1:14:18] and that was Connor
[1:14:22] but you know it all had a purpose to
[1:14:25] fulfill the word of God is that right
[1:14:29] amen
[1:14:31] but you know God God started out this
[1:14:34] way but then
[1:14:36] because of the the cruelty of sin sin is
[1:14:41] cruel
[1:14:42] all right when when we look at let's you
[1:14:46] know sometimes I think we we got to take
[1:14:48] the blinders off
[1:14:50] we we get we become Christians and we
[1:14:54] walk around with blinders on
[1:14:58] right because because we're a Christian
[1:15:00] just as some of us may not have been as
[1:15:03] bad as others but but just sometimes uh
[1:15:07] just look at the sin
[1:15:11] that
[1:15:12] still in our life
[1:15:15] God just God just don't there's a blood
[1:15:18] bumper there
[1:15:19] right come on Church y'all don't quit on
[1:15:22] me
[1:15:23] I know y'all like shout messages but uh
[1:15:27] I'm gonna let you shot in a minute
[1:15:28] somewhere I guess
[1:15:32] right uh I just like the I like realist
[1:15:36] realistic type preaching now I like the
[1:15:39] faith and I like all of that but I
[1:15:42] I'm just a senior now
[1:15:45] I'm a senior so I do things a little bit
[1:15:48] different
[1:15:49] okay so y'all just have to like Paul
[1:15:52] said bear with me and all of my Folly
[1:15:55] and all of that kind of stuff but I'm
[1:15:57] not here to hurt us let's keep that in
[1:15:59] mind but I I I got a message this
[1:16:02] morning I'm trying to get to okay
[1:16:05] uh uh
[1:16:08] but the crushing it's the crushing it
[1:16:13] is so necessary
[1:16:15] right it's it's
[1:16:17] we we all I believe need we all need a
[1:16:21] little bit of crushing
[1:16:23] because some of us egotistical
[1:16:27] uh some of us we we got so much going on
[1:16:31] me brother smiley
[1:16:35] Go kids yourself
[1:16:37] right one of the things that I'm
[1:16:39] learning in life is to to uh
[1:16:43] look at yourself and face yourself in
[1:16:47] the mirror and and just say this is who
[1:16:49] I am right now
[1:16:51] I'm I'm not defined by this
[1:16:54] but but this this is maybe who I I was
[1:16:58] this is maybe where I am but you also
[1:17:01] you got to see yourself on on a journey
[1:17:05] right uh going to a place of perfection
[1:17:09] never be defined by your present state
[1:17:14] right never be defined by and this this
[1:17:18] is a good
[1:17:19] statement for
[1:17:21] our younger generation right never allow
[1:17:25] your mistakes to Define you
[1:17:29] never allow your mistakes let me break
[1:17:31] it down a little bit further for them uh
[1:17:34] to say this is who you are
[1:17:37] your mistake is just what it is
[1:17:41] it's a mistake
[1:17:43] it's not something that uh you willfully
[1:17:46] do sometimes it's just something that
[1:17:49] you know uh by being a little bit
[1:17:53] immature and not so much developed
[1:17:57] even us 50 year olds and 60 year olds
[1:18:00] too but I'll leave that alone
[1:18:03] um but never allow yourself to be
[1:18:05] defined
[1:18:07] by by the things that you you may do
[1:18:11] that you know sometimes maybe your
[1:18:13] parents don't agree with or the pastor
[1:18:15] may not agree with or something of that
[1:18:17] nature but but understand something that
[1:18:20] you're you're you're on your way to a
[1:18:22] place of maturity
[1:18:25] you're you're developing
[1:18:28] is that right so so you know uh
[1:18:33] the cruelty of sin
[1:18:36] because of this the fall the fall amen
[1:18:40] brought forth Sin Sin crew
[1:18:45] right
[1:18:46] sin is crew and but there has to be a a
[1:18:52] price paid to rinse it
[1:18:56] right that they had to watch I like I I
[1:19:00] really enjoyed looking at the
[1:19:03] sovereignty of God and the Mystery of
[1:19:06] God constantly unfolding itself through
[1:19:10] scripture
[1:19:12] it was it was necessary
[1:19:15] right it was necessary that God's came
[1:19:20] down and veiled himself in in human skin
[1:19:24] is that right because you know after the
[1:19:28] fall you know God dressed the church a
[1:19:31] certain way and all of that but it was a
[1:19:34] temporarily
[1:19:35] something that he did
[1:19:37] the the under the laws and things of
[1:19:40] that nature you know bulls and goats it
[1:19:43] just kind of covered over it never would
[1:19:46] have brought back a perfection
[1:19:49] right
[1:19:50] and and you know I I like him staying uh
[1:19:55] Redemption when we think about
[1:19:56] Redemption Redemption is taking us back
[1:20:00] to the beginning back to an original
[1:20:02] state
[1:20:04] is that right back to a perfection
[1:20:08] right back to uh uh original place that
[1:20:12] we stood in
[1:20:14] right like Adam having having dominion
[1:20:18] and things of that nature the abstract
[1:20:20] he could speak he could say I don't
[1:20:23] sometimes I don't even know if we fully
[1:20:25] understand what has has already taken
[1:20:28] place in US
[1:20:30] life Endeavors in the power of a
[1:20:34] is that right and sometimes we we speak
[1:20:38] a lot of things and we we give life to
[1:20:41] it
[1:20:42] by our voice by what we say
[1:20:47] right glory to God uh but let's all be
[1:20:51] realistic we gotta keep in mind that
[1:20:54] that we in this house
[1:20:57] and that's where our war is because we
[1:21:00] flash we you know we try our own beings
[1:21:02] and things that are in the flesh there's
[1:21:05] a war that we had a contest this morning
[1:21:09] is that right come on Church we're in a
[1:21:12] contest and as much as we want to speak
[1:21:14] the word of God that that's a that's a
[1:21:17] real battle and there's a real war
[1:21:19] that's going on in this inside of us
[1:21:22] that that causes us sometimes to speak
[1:21:27] you know the devil's language
[1:21:31] instead of speaking faith
[1:21:34] that I gate
[1:21:36] right what what we see those things
[1:21:40] don't even matter as it relates to
[1:21:43] faith in the word faith in the promise
[1:21:46] what's been given to us
[1:21:49] I'm starting to feel good now
[1:21:52] but see amen you know God God knew that
[1:21:57] it was necessary
[1:21:59] right glory to God God knew that it was
[1:22:03] necessary that he come down
[1:22:06] to perform the work
[1:22:09] of redemption right because let's I'm
[1:22:13] gonna tell you something we needed blood
[1:22:17] we we need it we need it something to to
[1:22:22] to wash the individual that would wash
[1:22:26] because the second work of Grace right
[1:22:29] happened at Calvary
[1:22:33] Oh Glory to God right go back to Future
[1:22:36] home where brother Brandon talked you
[1:22:39] know those three stages of Grace right
[1:22:44] amen it showed him spilling his blood
[1:22:48] right as the second stage of grace to
[1:22:51] the Natural Earth it's got another stage
[1:22:54] that's coming it won't be warned uh but
[1:22:57] fire next time
[1:22:59] right just to read the whole thing is
[1:23:02] that right
[1:23:03] right but listen
[1:23:06] um
[1:23:07] in the sovereignty of God it took
[1:23:10] something to read set
[1:23:14] right
[1:23:15] because up on the bulls and goats they
[1:23:18] will make those offerings every year and
[1:23:20] then they would go back and they would
[1:23:22] have to come back
[1:23:24] right and they would listen
[1:23:27] under the blood of of sheeps and Bulls
[1:23:30] and all that
[1:23:31] that was no real change
[1:23:35] right there was no real change in the
[1:23:39] individual
[1:23:40] anything to really speak about
[1:23:43] the thing was just covered so that they
[1:23:45] didn't get wiped out as long as they
[1:23:47] didn't do the same thing before the next
[1:23:50] you know uh time of offering is that
[1:23:54] right glory to God Amen but but God's
[1:23:59] amen uh wanted to come forth to to make
[1:24:04] an offering once and for all
[1:24:07] right one time
[1:24:11] to make a difference
[1:24:14] right to to bring about uh a change
[1:24:19] is that right
[1:24:21] Oh Glory to his wonderful name I got
[1:24:23] some quotes here I'm gonna read them in
[1:24:24] a minute but I'm feeling good I feel I'm
[1:24:28] feeling good this morning
[1:24:30] right
[1:24:32] because of the cruelty
[1:24:35] right
[1:24:36] and sin has been cruel
[1:24:38] and and I don't know about you this
[1:24:41] morning but I thank God for being under
[1:24:42] the blood of Jesus Christ I thank God
[1:24:45] for being a Christian
[1:24:47] this ain't this is not uh a mistake or
[1:24:51] anything I'm here this morning by the
[1:24:55] grace of God I was telling brother Troy
[1:24:56] this morning it's just something about
[1:24:58] Sunday morning man I just can't hardly
[1:25:01] wait for the church doors to open
[1:25:03] brother Capers they be laughing at me
[1:25:06] because I'd be zooming past them on my
[1:25:08] way to church
[1:25:09] try just trying to get here I can't say
[1:25:12] I all the time be feeling good but
[1:25:15] there's something way deep down on the
[1:25:18] inside of the inside of the inside that
[1:25:21] it just it just propels me it put it
[1:25:25] pushes me I can't rest I can't sleep
[1:25:29] some of y'all y'all like to rest and
[1:25:31] sleep you know I just yeah I just I just
[1:25:34] can't hardly do it when it's time to go
[1:25:36] to church it's time to go to church
[1:25:37] because I'm a needy person I just need
[1:25:40] whatever God's got for me
[1:25:43] whatever kind of word that God has for
[1:25:46] me like I say if it's one of these young
[1:25:48] fellas or whatever it might be I just
[1:25:51] need to eat
[1:25:53] is that right
[1:25:55] I I need I need to eat I don't know
[1:25:57] about y'all but I need to eat it ain't
[1:26:00] there well Jesus no I need to eat
[1:26:06] I need to eat something bloody
[1:26:09] right like one of the brothers said in
[1:26:12] Canada one time we went over there kill
[1:26:14] any eight
[1:26:15] some bloody
[1:26:18] is that right
[1:26:20] something that's gonna give me that
[1:26:22] something to help me to uh uh press
[1:26:25] forward
[1:26:27] right
[1:26:28] but
[1:26:30] in in the mind of God
[1:26:33] in the purpose of God
[1:26:36] Calvary was so necessary
[1:26:39] right it it was so necessary watch this
[1:26:44] because of the scripture and I read a
[1:26:48] subscription I know they seem like they
[1:26:49] randomly they're not random right
[1:26:52] because God promised and and we we look
[1:26:57] at this scripture
[1:27:00] and and we think it just relates to
[1:27:03] tangible things
[1:27:05] well some of y'all millionaires

[1:29:36] right now I'm annoying it so ain't no
[1:29:38] telling what I might do
[1:29:40] right right
[1:29:41] amen but let's look at let's look at the
[1:29:45] crud it was it was so necessary that he
[1:29:49] crushed him I I got a maybe a quote I'm
[1:29:52] gonna read this like a preach this
[1:29:54] message without reading but
[1:29:56] uh I'ma do it this way
[1:29:59] right uh
[1:30:02] brother Brown said he said he was he was
[1:30:04] just talking about the incident that he
[1:30:07] had where
[1:30:08] uh the sickness came
[1:30:11] you know through town and it took out it
[1:30:13] took out
[1:30:15] um
[1:30:15] his wife his first wife and his baby
[1:30:18] girl right
[1:30:21] and and
[1:30:22] God allows his service to go through
[1:30:25] some stuff now
[1:30:27] believe me God God allowed her and
[1:30:29] especially you know especially when when
[1:30:34] you you're disobedient to the word of
[1:30:37] God don't think that because you're a
[1:30:39] preacher and we exempt now ain't no
[1:30:41] exemption
[1:30:43] right no God will allow you to go
[1:30:47] through different things but but also
[1:30:49] God God knowing what kind of ministry
[1:30:53] that he was going to have just like Paul
[1:30:56] Paul said you know a messenger
[1:31:00] uh was given to him to Buffet him
[1:31:03] because of the abundance of Revelation
[1:31:06] I'm gonna make us real strong statement
[1:31:09] because we like to be excited about the
[1:31:12] revelation
[1:31:13] but what what we don't realize what goes
[1:31:17] along with the revelation
[1:31:20] right so sometimes we think God is like
[1:31:23] I got to keep you down here because if I
[1:31:27] don't you get lifted up and you'll get
[1:31:29] out of place and you'll do more damage
[1:31:31] with the revelation
[1:31:33] is that right because you know you'll be
[1:31:36] fussing and arguing and thinking you all
[1:31:38] smart
[1:31:39] right but God God allows things to
[1:31:42] happen to keep you in a spot where he
[1:31:47] could deal with you where he can use you
[1:31:51] right
[1:31:52] God knew what he was going he was going
[1:31:55] to give this this Prophet um this
[1:31:58] ministry right but he had to be in the
[1:32:01] right state
[1:32:03] come on Church the condition at the
[1:32:07] right the right kind of character had to
[1:32:10] be on display
[1:32:11] in order for God to be able right
[1:32:14] because God don't change
[1:32:17] and the thing that you know brother
[1:32:19] Branham makes this reference to is that
[1:32:21] he he was looking back at Paul and what
[1:32:24] Paul taught he taught
[1:32:26] right and then under this Eagle
[1:32:28] anointing he had to realize
[1:32:32] God having to do certain things because
[1:32:34] it was a whole lot of Revelation that he
[1:32:38] was going to receive not for himself but
[1:32:41] for the amen this portion of the head
[1:32:44] part of the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:32:48] is that right and so you know uh the
[1:32:52] prophet was told of the kind of ministry
[1:32:55] that he was going to have and how he was
[1:32:57] going to you know pray for Pope takes
[1:33:00] him monarchs and just great people
[1:33:04] right
[1:33:05] but then his daddy-in-law talk came in
[1:33:08] and told look well you ain't gonna take
[1:33:09] my if you take my daughter and you ain't
[1:33:12] gonna do that that's why I'm gonna tell
[1:33:13] you something his parents you just need
[1:33:14] to be careful
[1:33:16] right when it comes to spiritual things
[1:33:19] just just be especially when your kids
[1:33:22] is growing up spiritual you'd be
[1:33:24] supportive because it's just like you
[1:33:27] know Joseph in the scripture when he
[1:33:30] brought the dream to his parents they
[1:33:31] were looking at him in front of that oh
[1:33:33] and his brother and them oh he think
[1:33:34] he's something
[1:33:35] y'all know how we do we still do the
[1:33:37] same thing
[1:33:38] right we still do it's like oh he think
[1:33:40] he's so
[1:33:41] no it was just he couldn't help that God
[1:33:44] had a matter of purpose for his life is
[1:33:46] that right
[1:33:48] amen and that he would be in a position
[1:33:51] to be a blessing for his parents but
[1:33:53] they thought that he was just trying to
[1:33:55] be a man a spot at it right but but you
[1:33:58] know here brother Brown he he's talking
[1:34:01] about the situation that happened he
[1:34:03] said he said I had done everything that
[1:34:05] I know he he said he said I took a gun
[1:34:09] and tried to commit suicide what that
[1:34:12] was the human part
[1:34:14] right that was the crushing
[1:34:17] God had the crush his servant
[1:34:21] right oh glory to God he felt like
[1:34:25] committing suicide he says I was in such
[1:34:29] a time and it was at that hour in that
[1:34:32] little room up there on my knees the
[1:34:35] heavens because at one point he said it
[1:34:38] seemed like God had pulled the shade
[1:34:40] down God wasn't hearing it
[1:34:42] but now at this point he said it felt
[1:34:46] like having that opened up but that
[1:34:48] makes a difference if you ever been that
[1:34:51] way you feel like God don't hear you
[1:34:54] it makes a difference knowing that God
[1:34:56] hears your prayer
[1:34:58] Oh Glory to God maybe I'm the only one
[1:35:00] that been there oh Hallelujah but he
[1:35:04] said the whole the heavens opened back
[1:35:06] and he said I saw her standing there in
[1:35:08] the Splendor immortality it was in that
[1:35:11] hour that I felt her arms come around my
[1:35:15] shoulders said bill you don't have you
[1:35:17] you don't understand we're in a much
[1:35:19] better off than you
[1:35:21] he said it takes watch this it takes a
[1:35:26] crucifixion
[1:35:28] right it takes a crushing of the flower
[1:35:33] to bring the perfume
[1:35:37] see
[1:35:38] the question brings out something
[1:35:42] so the Crescent is necessary
[1:35:45] it's not just that God is doing
[1:35:47] something randomly no the crushing is
[1:35:49] necessary
[1:35:50] right
[1:35:52] is it you know uh some of us probably
[1:35:54] got on cologne or perfume this morning
[1:35:57] right
[1:35:59] nobody
[1:36:01] okay don't be scared praise the Lord
[1:36:06] what's well in order to get that
[1:36:09] something had to be
[1:36:11] crushed
[1:36:13] right
[1:36:14] something had to be crushed
[1:36:17] to make the thing that we spray or we
[1:36:20] rub in or the the essential oils these
[1:36:23] things come from something
[1:36:26] right it comes from materials that could
[1:36:30] be crushed
[1:36:31] and made into something that we could
[1:36:35] walk around and somebody say girl you
[1:36:38] smelling good
[1:36:39] s
[1:36:40] with me
[1:36:43] come on I'm gonna go somewhere with that
[1:36:45] statement now right
[1:36:47] it see let me keep on of this and then I
[1:36:51] get on to that right
[1:36:53] um
[1:36:54] he said uh it takes the crushing of the
[1:36:57] flower to bring perfume
[1:36:59] from it it takes
[1:37:02] a crushing of a life
[1:37:05] to get the best out of out of that right
[1:37:08] there is see God has to sometimes crush
[1:37:13] us
[1:37:14] because God knows what's in there
[1:37:18] right
[1:37:19] and God knew that it was it was
[1:37:21] necessary is that right for you to be
[1:37:24] crushed
[1:37:26] in order to get what's in there out that
[1:37:30] was there's no other way
[1:37:32] is that right there's no other way
[1:37:36] glory to God see the crushing of a life
[1:37:39] the crushing of a life right hell
[1:37:44] digs everything that we needed was in
[1:37:47] Christ
[1:37:49] right come on church but Christ had to
[1:37:52] be crushed
[1:37:54] say that again
[1:37:56] Christ had to be crushed
[1:38:00] so the thief that was in Christ could be
[1:38:03] released we still preaching this morning
[1:38:07] see it was no good
[1:38:10] just being in Christ like that
[1:38:13] he had to be crushed for a purpose
[1:38:17] we still working I ain't gonna let y'all
[1:38:19] in on it all at one time yet
[1:38:21] but I'm still feeling good right so so
[1:38:25] it's it's
[1:38:26] you know we we could we could
[1:38:29] be be cuddled
[1:38:32] or we could be spiritual
[1:38:34] we could look at our situations present
[1:38:37] tense
[1:38:39] and and assess these these states
[1:38:43] commonly
[1:38:45] Are Spiritual
[1:38:47] right we we could see because we always
[1:38:50] say that devil
[1:38:55] the devil but we give the devil too much
[1:38:58] credit
[1:39:01] right amen a lot of times we don't see
[1:39:06] God in things
[1:39:09] see the screws say it pleased God to to
[1:39:13] bruise
[1:39:15] to crush his son I was pleased see y'all
[1:39:18] thank God be somewhere in the cut crying
[1:39:21] cause you being crushed
[1:39:27] no God be looking at that situation you
[1:39:31] know what when it's all said and done
[1:39:34] he's gonna be on a whole nother level
[1:39:37] she's gonna be on a whole nother level
[1:39:40] right glory to God glory to God I mean I
[1:39:45] know as human beings we have a tendency
[1:39:47] of feeling sorry for one another that's
[1:39:49] a good thing
[1:39:50] right that's a good thing and we
[1:39:53] supposed to be compassionate you know
[1:39:56] but but you know I sometimes you you
[1:39:59] look at yourself and you realize it was
[1:40:01] necessary
[1:40:05] not unless you're not in your right mind
[1:40:09] come on
[1:40:11] because because a lot of times right we
[1:40:15] think more highly of ourselves than we
[1:40:18] ought to
[1:40:20] come on church can I get one witness
[1:40:22] lights preach with me
[1:40:25] huh
[1:40:26] this is the truth
[1:40:28] right sometimes we feel like we're we're
[1:40:32] better individuals and we're better
[1:40:34] Christians than we really are
[1:40:37] we easily lie to ourselves
[1:40:41] come on Church well I'm gonna give this
[1:40:44] mic to somebody because y'all y'all
[1:40:46] ain't ready for this
[1:40:48] y'all ain't ready for this
[1:40:50] it's the truth sometimes you just got to
[1:40:53] bring us right down to reality
[1:40:55] right it's the truth Church
[1:40:58] amen why wha watch watch our lives a lot
[1:41:02] of times
[1:41:03] come on like preach with me
[1:41:05] watch our lives watch our conversations
[1:41:08] watch what we do watch how we handle one
[1:41:11] another
[1:41:13] come on church and then then we we come
[1:41:16] in and we act we act holier than loud
[1:41:19] praise God
[1:41:23] ah
[1:41:24] it's the truth amen
[1:41:27] we we act we act a certain we act a
[1:41:30] certain way
[1:41:31] is that right
[1:41:33] glory to God and then we come and we
[1:41:35] shout the building down we we shout over
[1:41:38] things and God say you know what I gotta
[1:41:41] crush them just a little bit more to get
[1:41:43] them to this place amen of perfection
[1:41:47] this place of maturity
[1:41:52] glory to God
[1:41:54] it's not for evil
[1:41:58] but God God I'm gonna make a statement
[1:42:00] it's gonna be a strong God wants us to
[1:42:02] be realistic in this season that we in
[1:42:05] realistic with ourself
[1:42:10] come on realistic with ourself
[1:42:15] right
[1:42:17] because it's easy to shout over
[1:42:20] a whole lot of stuff
[1:42:23] right but these messages like this ain't
[1:42:25] hard it is hard to shout over this
[1:42:28] you got to be you got to be a real
[1:42:30] Christian to say Amen
[1:42:32] is that right come on but I'm not saying
[1:42:35] it to be be ill I'm just on a thought it
[1:42:37] don't even you know right
[1:42:40] but but I know where I am right as as a
[1:42:43] person and I realize how the crushing
[1:42:47] is necessary
[1:42:51] right the question is the crushing is so
[1:42:55] necessary for your state
[1:42:59] for your elevation
[1:43:01] for the way that we think as Christians
[1:43:04] I'm not dealing with the world I'm
[1:43:06] talking about Christianity
[1:43:08] right
[1:43:09] because listen
[1:43:12] you know
[1:43:13] we're God's mouthpiece we're God's voice
[1:43:17] we're salt we're we're the light we're
[1:43:20] supposed to be all of this right
[1:43:25] that's a part of the plan of God
[1:43:27] but we got to be that in the right state
[1:43:33] right come on Church
[1:43:35] your co-workers can't see you acting one
[1:43:38] way
[1:43:40] come on you going off for everybody on
[1:43:43] the job
[1:43:47] huh
[1:43:48] you misusing words and everything yeah
[1:43:56] well I've gone on
[1:43:58] I thought they said they probably be
[1:44:00] Christian that the first thing you know
[1:44:02] what drunks don't even go to church and
[1:44:04] everything else but they can tell you
[1:44:06] what what they know what a Christian's
[1:44:08] supposed to be
[1:44:10] when they see us acting up and acting
[1:44:12] out
[1:44:14] your children too come on preach with me
[1:44:17] parents your children have something
[1:44:20] she jumping around he jumping around
[1:44:24] not even when the pastor preached
[1:44:31] glory to God
[1:44:33] I'm trying to go somewhere I need more
[1:44:36] time
[1:44:38] Oh Glory to God
[1:44:40] amen
[1:44:41] so he says it takes a question of your
[1:44:44] life to get the bad think about that to
[1:44:47] get the best out of it
[1:44:51] that there is God wants to get the very
[1:44:54] best that there is out of us
[1:45:00] see God ain't into halfway anything
[1:45:04] right God wants to get the very best out
[1:45:08] of us
[1:45:09] right so sometimes God has to crush us
[1:45:13] right
[1:45:15] amen bring us to that place and keep
[1:45:18] that in mind that's the there's a reason
[1:45:20] God saw that it was necessary
[1:45:24] right all I can say is just keep praying
[1:45:27] for me
[1:45:28] I'll keep praying for you
[1:45:31] right because if you're going through
[1:45:32] something God saw that it was necessary
[1:45:35] for you to go through that
[1:45:39] is that right glory to God
[1:45:41] amen that's just God's provided way
[1:45:44] amen so he says the reason Jesus had to
[1:45:49] be
[1:45:51] Jesus had to be and if Jesus had to be
[1:45:57] we have got to be also crushed
[1:46:01] right
[1:46:03] Amen to bring forth what he was he could
[1:46:07] not
[1:46:09] uh he could not
[1:46:12] stand before the cruises fixing to say
[1:46:16] all power is in heaven and earth is
[1:46:18] given unto my hand but after the
[1:46:21] crucifixion
[1:46:23] power with our
[1:46:26] wish we know he was he was the epitome
[1:46:28] of all character
[1:46:30] but but God thought that it was the
[1:46:34] appropriate thing
[1:46:36] right
[1:46:37] to allow him to go
[1:46:40] see even when when Peter Peter was like
[1:46:43] boy ain't letting you go through that
[1:46:45] you can't stop it this is necessary
[1:46:49] it's it's it's
[1:46:51] necessary for for the people
[1:46:55] that that will come on the scene this
[1:46:58] Gentile church it was Nest it was
[1:47:01] necessary for the Old Testament Church
[1:47:02] but it was also knowing that we were
[1:47:04] coming right and and what what we would
[1:47:09] need
[1:47:12] and what we would need it was necessary
[1:47:16] right I ain't I ain't gonna ain't gonna
[1:47:18] hold y'all long
[1:47:19] I know y'all got me up here a little
[1:47:21] late but I ain't gonna hold y'all
[1:47:24] okay
[1:47:26] I know you can't stop it brother but
[1:47:28] Jack said don't stop the singing so you
[1:47:30] know so can I preach about two more
[1:47:32] hours
[1:47:33] don't stop the preaching either
[1:47:36] no just give it give me about 10-15
[1:47:38] minutes that'll be okay
[1:47:40] I was like I was sitting there like
[1:47:43] Chuck give me that mic right now you
[1:47:45] y'all would change the songs and then
[1:47:46] bring me up bring me up on a song that's
[1:47:49] jumping
[1:47:51] that's what future future reference
[1:47:52] don't change it when it's jumping bring
[1:47:54] me out on the Jump part don't let me
[1:47:56] happen to start over like hey you bring
[1:47:59] me in with it no it didn't do it drop it
[1:48:01] into a bit now that in his fault I
[1:48:04] understand brother be having a good time
[1:48:08] okay so he says but what what it did it
[1:48:12] taken
[1:48:13] a crucifixion fiction first is taking
[1:48:17] the crushing and the a disappointing
[1:48:20] pointing of the Apostles they had seen
[1:48:25] their savior
[1:48:26] the the one they had loved they seen him
[1:48:31] even raise up from the dead from the
[1:48:34] grave they had seen him do that and then
[1:48:37] to think think it was necessary it was
[1:48:41] so necessary that that they they were
[1:48:43] part of that
[1:48:45] see that was a part of their
[1:48:47] transformation
[1:48:49] right
[1:48:51] glory to God Amen it was what God had a
[1:48:56] lot
[1:48:58] see
[1:48:59] the shepherd was smitten the Sheep took
[1:49:02] off
[1:49:05] right that's why you got to pray for a
[1:49:07] shepherd
[1:49:09] right because because
[1:49:11] unfortunately we won't be who we are
[1:49:14] apart from a shepherd
[1:49:19] it's so necessary I don't need no Pastor
[1:49:22] oh yes you do don't tell that lie
[1:49:25] and you you need you need a pastor and a
[1:49:28] building that you could go to
[1:49:32] not unless you physically unable
[1:49:35] you know I know I know I thank God for
[1:49:38] technology don't don't misunderstand me
[1:49:40] but I think technology has made people
[1:49:43] lazy
[1:49:45] and and it just really shows
[1:49:47] maybe maybe what we thought was a birth
[1:49:51] maybe it wasn't a bird because brother
[1:49:52] bear said when a person get the
[1:49:53] baptismal they can't hardly wait to go
[1:49:56] sit up in the living room on the couch
[1:50:00] um
[1:50:02] come on Church
[1:50:04] now it's good for you know we got
[1:50:07] elderly people we got such addiction and
[1:50:09] some of the ones that's the you know you
[1:50:11] have to you has go all Sister Sister
[1:50:13] Capers she's been going through but
[1:50:15] she's never missed a beat
[1:50:18] right
[1:50:20] man I I remember a couple of months ago
[1:50:22] when we went to Carolina to brother Fred
[1:50:24] and I heard I ain't tell them this I'll
[1:50:27] say another when they said they were
[1:50:28] going out like oh God
[1:50:31] they going to South Carolina
[1:50:33] right but I got to realize who I'm
[1:50:35] talking about I'm telling my brother and
[1:50:36] sister capers
[1:50:38] right but I mean you know just on the
[1:50:41] heels of you know her going through but
[1:50:44] I'm like well if she got a favor to go
[1:50:46] to him but Perry praise the Lord and
[1:50:48] they beat me there and they were
[1:50:50] shouting having a good time
[1:50:53] you know come on see
[1:50:56] that that's a if if anybody got a right
[1:50:59] to sit home on the couch
[1:51:02] it would be somebody like sister Capers
[1:51:05] with all of the physical ailments but
[1:51:07] she take them physical ailments and walk
[1:51:09] them right into church
[1:51:12] [Applause]
[1:51:14] bring them right here into the presence
[1:51:17] of God realize that one day all of them
[1:51:20] Elmer's got to go
[1:51:24] I'm Gonna Keep I'm gonna keep taking all
[1:51:26] of this right into the presence of God
[1:51:29] right
[1:51:30] glory to God he says watch this
[1:51:33] um in the cruelty of sin and the penalty
[1:51:36] is is the quote 1953 I think it's called
[1:51:40] eight he said God made every individual
[1:51:43] here go home tonight with this on their
[1:51:46] mind thinking of what a sacrifice
[1:51:51] what did it cost to redeem
[1:51:54] I'll tell you what that that'll do
[1:51:56] something to your spirit what did what
[1:51:59] did it cost God
[1:52:01] it never cost us nothing
[1:52:03] because we didn't have what it we didn't
[1:52:05] have what it took the redeem us only he
[1:52:08] could redeem us
[1:52:09] come on somebody
[1:52:12] but it cost God his son it cost God the
[1:52:16] greatest Price it cost Christ his life
[1:52:20] what
[1:52:21] he was the Rose of Sharon
[1:52:24] but to get the perfume out the rose you
[1:52:28] had to crush it
[1:52:31] his beautiful life was crushed
[1:52:35] out of young man of 33 years old right
[1:52:39] but but because
[1:52:42] of of a need being met
[1:52:47] and and the precepts and the ordinance
[1:52:50] of God
[1:52:51] God knew and and listen brother Brandon
[1:52:55] makes a statement in Christ the mystery
[1:52:57] he says if you cannot see Christ in
[1:53:00] every line
[1:53:02] everywhere in the scripture she said go
[1:53:05] back and read it again
[1:53:07] because you don't miss something
[1:53:11] is that right
[1:53:13] and see listen God God knew right I got
[1:53:18] a quote in here that we were we were
[1:53:22] smelly
[1:53:25] we were stinky that's what the quotes
[1:53:28] read
[1:53:30] right
[1:53:32] and we needed amen a perfume
[1:53:36] right if if we think about you know uh
[1:53:40] the Old Testament and and how things
[1:53:43] were done you know
[1:53:45] uh uh
[1:53:47] uh you walking through you know Dusty
[1:53:50] dirt with your little sandals on and you
[1:53:52] get to somebody's house
[1:53:56] you knew that that you were you were
[1:54:00] welcome
[1:54:01] because they would have a foot wash
[1:54:04] flunking
[1:54:06] standing at the door
[1:54:08] to take what was crushed
[1:54:14] huh yeah to take what to take what was
[1:54:18] crushed and utilize that
[1:54:22] to make you welcome
[1:54:26] a fellowship
[1:54:30] amen
[1:54:31] glory to God
[1:54:33] to make you work this this says you
[1:54:36] welcome
[1:54:37] see there was Christ at one time was was
[1:54:42] given an invitation
[1:54:44] to come to a man of Fellowship
[1:54:47] but he got there and he wasn't made
[1:54:50] welcome
[1:54:52] now y'all gonna preach with me
[1:54:55] he wasn't made welcome
[1:55:00] but but in the sovereignty of God
[1:55:04] didn't ordain a potent tank
[1:55:07] he didn't oppressed with it uh just a
[1:55:11] prostitute
[1:55:13] huh amen a prostitute somebody who
[1:55:18] understood what it was like to be
[1:55:20] crushed
[1:55:23] did her status probably was talking
[1:55:27] about
[1:55:28] the women wouldn't wash with her
[1:55:34] foreign
[1:55:35] she understood the crushing being
[1:55:39] rejected
[1:55:42] huh
[1:55:43] the glory to God feeling feeling the
[1:55:46] squeeze of society and and knows is
[1:55:50] being turned up when you know your press
[1:55:52] is coming people crossing over yeah you
[1:55:57] know
[1:55:59] glory to God
[1:56:02] but she saw
[1:56:03] amen the king of kings
[1:56:06] and the Lord of Lord
[1:56:08] she saw the savior
[1:56:11] unwelcome and everybody people Point
[1:56:15] takes and everything was made welcome
[1:56:17] but he was in a position a place where
[1:56:20] he wasn't welcome he was bought there
[1:56:22] for for a joke
[1:56:25] right
[1:56:26] amen and and she took her earnings
[1:56:30] that that she had earned you know for a
[1:56:33] living the way that she earned it
[1:56:36] y'all know the story
[1:56:39] went and got an alabaster box
[1:56:42] look she ain't gonna get no sheep she
[1:56:46] went and got some real expensive amen uh
[1:56:51] uh cologne something that had went
[1:56:54] through a
[1:56:56] well praise the Lord somebody
[1:56:58] something that why
[1:57:01] [Applause]
[1:57:04] Why Y'all Gonna Make Me preach up in
[1:57:05] here
[1:57:08] she was crushed
[1:57:12] he was crushed
[1:57:15] it was Crush
[1:57:19] huh
[1:57:24] for the work of redemption
[1:57:27] that's a whole lot of crushing ain't it
[1:57:29] that's a whole lot of question
[1:57:31] he had to be crushed because of what he
[1:57:34] was see he represented himself amen as
[1:57:39] the Rose of Sharon
[1:57:42] and and to get the perfume out
[1:57:46] right it had to be crushed
[1:57:49] to get to get those these oils they
[1:57:52] something has to be crushed
[1:57:56] and mix
[1:57:58] right look in the Old Testament with
[1:58:02] with when God set up the priesthood
[1:58:05] order
[1:58:06] which is a type of Christ
[1:58:09] right God had it standard and ordinances
[1:58:13] right
[1:58:14] for you know they had to be a
[1:58:18] appropriate way is that right
[1:58:21] that that had been made for Aaron to be
[1:58:25] able to go into the presence of God
[1:58:30] come on
[1:58:32] well I tell you what God's provided
[1:58:34] where it's up man
[1:58:37] amen
[1:58:38] he went in with Christ all over him
[1:58:42] and representation right the Rose of
[1:58:45] Sharon right now or it was poured
[1:58:51] see you gotta see you can't go into the
[1:58:55] presence of God any old kind of way
[1:58:58] you got to go in anointed
[1:59:02] all right that high priest went in
[1:59:06] anointed
[1:59:08] right
[1:59:09] oh I'll just
[1:59:12] huh oh glory to God kings were anointed
[1:59:18] something had to be crushed though to
[1:59:21] produce what was necessary
[1:59:25] right I like you know you even think
[1:59:27] about the story of David
[1:59:30] if something happened to been crushed
[1:59:33] right
[1:59:36] amen
[1:59:38] he he wouldn't have been anointed that
[1:59:41] was just God's provided way
[1:59:43] right so the crushing was necessary
[1:59:48] because
[1:59:49] in Christ was everything that's
[1:59:52] necessary
[1:59:54] is that right
[1:59:55] amen because you know y'all y'all know
[1:59:58] y'all don't like folk around y'all
[2:00:00] smelling
[2:00:01] let's be real Let It Be Real
[2:00:05] let it be real
[2:00:07] because if a bump come out here and he
[2:00:10] you know I've been way way back in the
[2:00:13] day
[2:00:14] and and Okeechobee this this fell on or
[2:00:16] whatever happened to him brother came
[2:00:18] from no I'm talking about he used to
[2:00:19] come he was a hobo
[2:00:22] he will come through and Lord
[2:00:26] Jesus
[2:00:28] Hallelujah
[2:00:30] glory to God
[2:00:32] that man used to be like
[2:00:36] and he come in and you see full scooting
[2:00:39] over
[2:00:40] you couldn't hardly blame him because
[2:00:41] you couldn't hardly take the smell
[2:00:43] that man smelled like Outdoors a
[2:00:46] thousand days with no baths
[2:00:49] right but he was a good good-hearted
[2:00:51] good nature got over
[2:00:52] right but man
[2:00:54] I tell you
[2:00:56] who you just want to bathe just bathe
[2:00:58] get in the water and let me just pour
[2:01:01] all this on you huh
[2:01:04] but that's but but we don't realize
[2:01:06] that's what God has done for us
[2:01:09] is that right
[2:01:11] because sometimes sometimes we don't
[2:01:13] smell ourselves
[2:01:17] but God does
[2:01:19] God does God smell us so we thank God
[2:01:22] for the anointing one more comment I'm
[2:01:24] gonna get out of here right
[2:01:27] especially especially
[2:01:31] in the age and hour that we're living in
[2:01:33] right we're living in and we kind of
[2:01:36] I've been making little references here
[2:01:38] and there
[2:01:39] this is the age of anxiety
[2:01:43] right and and like we said a while back
[2:01:47] a lot of this anxiety is is
[2:01:50] self-inflicted because uh some of it is
[2:01:53] because folks be smoking that stuff with
[2:01:55] all this Tac in it
[2:01:57] come on
[2:01:59] eating all these Edibles and all of this
[2:02:02] stuff that's altering their their mental
[2:02:04] state
[2:02:06] glory to God this stuff is dangerous
[2:02:10] this this stuff is you know y'all know
[2:02:13] what I'm talking about some of y'all
[2:02:14] used to smoke weed back in the day yeah
[2:02:16] I know I wasn't the only one praise the
[2:02:19] Lord I ain't gonna look up Jesus
[2:02:24] all right
[2:02:25] all we did was want to go laugh and eat
[2:02:30] huh let me eat oh we got the munches we
[2:02:34] want we everything was funny and we
[2:02:37] wanted to go some get some chips and
[2:02:39] soda knee-high sodas and Candy just

[2:02:43] now this stuff be having these folk like
[2:02:47] zombies

[2:02:58] that
[2:02:59] but it's a I mean it's some good in this
[2:03:02] stuff now and Tac and some of this stuff
[2:03:05] is good I ain't gonna say it's all bad I
[2:03:07] guess if it's regulated by a doctor
[2:03:10] I'll say that
[2:03:12] I I don't want none of that but
[2:03:15] you know you you don't want to take it
[2:03:17] off the shelf if it's if it's necessary
[2:03:20] because people have cancers people have
[2:03:22] got extreme pains that sometimes they
[2:03:25] they you know I'll leave that alone I
[2:03:27] ain't gonna tell y'all what to do just

[2:03:40] right if if you get severe enough pains
[2:03:43] they they might prescribe some of that
[2:03:45] now that's up to you
[2:03:47] I ain't gonna tell nobody I ain't giving
[2:03:49] nobody no open door to smoke nothing I
[2:03:53] just stop right there and leave that
[2:03:55] alone

[2:03:59] if he choose not to but I'm going
[2:04:02] somewhere with this right
[2:04:04] because he's the Liliana Valley

[2:09:10] every hour that that motorcycles would
[2:09:12] be up in the building
[2:09:14] huh glorious God knew that
[2:09:17] knew that even before I even knew it
[2:09:21] God God knew it it wasn't by chance
[2:09:25] but to fulfill a purpose
[2:09:28] God saw that it was necessary
[2:09:31] God started just maybe brother Smiley
[2:09:34] needed a little question
[2:09:37] is that right to get him in a place
[2:09:39] where he becomes more anointed
[2:09:44] more powerful
[2:09:46] demons tremble when they see him come in
[2:09:49] the building
[2:09:50] right is that right
[2:09:52] glory to God
[2:09:54] glory to God
[2:09:56] amen
[2:09:57] see
[2:09:59] I might look I might have looked at it
[2:10:01] one way
[2:10:03] but then but then you know
[2:10:07] having opportunity and time to just
[2:10:10] meditate
[2:10:11] and and think on my ways
[2:10:14] it it opens up to me a real reality
[2:10:19] is that right
[2:10:21] a real reality church and I'll say this
[2:10:25] and I'm gonna get ready to go
[2:10:27] you know I you start you start looking
[2:10:30] at yourself even from
[2:10:32] your roles
[2:10:34] I started realizing some some things
[2:10:37] over over the last few months and stuff
[2:10:40] like
[2:10:41] but it's a whole lot that goes along
[2:10:43] with with uh manhood
[2:10:49] marriage
[2:10:52] parenting
[2:10:54] and I'm gonna tell you something you got
[2:10:56] to be on your A-game
[2:10:59] you can't be on your C game
[2:11:01] come on yo d game no it ain't gonna work
[2:11:06] uh
[2:11:09] you you folk folk I look back on my life
[2:11:12] and and
[2:11:14] I look back and I was like well I was a
[2:11:16] real naive fella
[2:11:19] I I didn't really have a clue
[2:11:22] I'm telling you can I be real about five
[2:11:24] minutes
[2:11:25] and I'm saying this for the young fellas
[2:11:28] that ain't married yet and the younger
[2:11:30] ones that he is married yet you gotta
[2:11:33] constantly educate yourself
[2:11:36] right
[2:11:37] and and and and a whole lot more than
[2:11:40] just scripture
[2:11:45] I'm telling you charge
[2:11:47] because you can go in that same thing if
[2:11:49] I Holy Ghost feel fine about ties
[2:11:52] right
[2:11:53] it's the same way brother Branham makes
[2:11:56] a statement by y'all a nice group but he
[2:11:58] ain't gonna let you stay stay that way
[2:12:00] you can start out good but he trying not
[2:12:02] to let you stay that way
[2:12:04] is that right you I I learned so I just
[2:12:09] sitting back you know looking at things
[2:12:12] and and having time to meditate and look
[2:12:14] at the Holy Spirit I started realizing
[2:12:16] you know what
[2:12:18] my approach to to marriage
[2:12:23] I didn't know what I was doing
[2:12:26] really
[2:12:27] I I didn't know I didn't even have a
[2:12:30] clue of the road that I was traveling
[2:12:33] right I couldn't see the journey I
[2:12:36] couldn't see where I was going at in the
[2:12:38] thing
[2:12:40] right
[2:12:43] I'm crushed for the purpose of somebody
[2:12:45] else purpose
[2:12:47] right
[2:12:49] because let's face it we're starting to
[2:12:51] see more divorces around the message
[2:12:54] than we ever have
[2:12:57] come on everywhere you turn somebody's
[2:13:01] going through something somebody this is
[2:13:03] somebody's death
[2:13:06] right
[2:13:08] and just maybe God allow you know me to
[2:13:11] go through different things just to be
[2:13:14] able to help somebody else down the road
[2:13:19] because when all they told us is that
[2:13:21] but get the Holy Ghost get the Holy
[2:13:24] Ghost get the Holy Ghost
[2:13:27] well there was a whole lot more that we
[2:13:30] needed once we did get the Holy Ghost
[2:13:33] as a man as women
[2:13:36] right
[2:13:38] glory to God glory to God we needed
[2:13:41] something that when the devil started
[2:13:43] attacking
[2:13:45] that we were on a level mentally
[2:13:49] spiritually
[2:13:51] to overcome to lead
[2:13:55] to lead
[2:13:57] to lead to be a leader
[2:14:02] something deeper than just being able to
[2:14:04] put five quotes together and come stand
[2:14:06] in the Pulpit you need a whole lot more
[2:14:09] than that when the devil start walking
[2:14:12] in your house
[2:14:19] when the devil say it's your fault
[2:14:22] yeah I would say it's your fault
[2:14:25] and that's as a man I'm gonna tell you
[2:14:28] something
[2:14:29] it's going to be your fault
[2:14:31] because God hold you responsible
[2:14:36] no matter what no matter she could be
[2:14:38] wrong it's two left shoes
[2:14:42] she gonna be just as guilty she could be
[2:14:44] just as wrong as two left shoe God is
[2:14:46] going to look at you and say boy you
[2:14:49] should have known what you were doing
[2:14:51] now I'm just I'm just on the surface
[2:14:53] right now this boy I got a whole lot
[2:14:57] huh
[2:14:59] I got a whole lot I ain't the difference
[2:15:02] I ain't the same person I was amen two
[2:15:04] years ago I ain't the same person I was
[2:15:07] six months ago
[2:15:09] is that right glory to God
[2:15:11] you you you you you gotta get on a level
[2:15:14] mentally you gotta understand some stuff
[2:15:20] being be in a place that you could stand
[2:15:23] at the door and say I'm the God here and
[2:15:26] and you know what nothing has access
[2:15:29] into this house
[2:15:32] that ain't God
[2:15:36] sometimes you got to take the you got to
[2:15:38] take the wrong amen for the right
[2:15:42] being a man
[2:15:44] you could be right as right and left
[2:15:47] shoes
[2:15:49] but you might sometimes have to take the
[2:15:51] wrong
[2:15:52] like two left shoes
[2:15:54] y'all know two left shoes is wrong is
[2:15:56] wrong wrong
[2:15:58] put on y'all know you see little kids
[2:16:01] around there the shoes on the wrong feet
[2:16:03] and all that you'd be like
[2:16:06] really
[2:16:12] okay
[2:16:14] and that's something
[2:16:16] so tell us what it's got to be
[2:16:19] well I tell you what church you know we
[2:16:22] we we're at a place uh sister Brothers
[2:16:24] can make your way uh we had a place I
[2:16:27] got a whole lot I kind of bunched this
[2:16:29] up a little bit I just I got a lot
[2:16:33] ball up inside of me you know a lot that
[2:16:37] I want a lot that a lot that I I I want
[2:16:39] to relate
[2:16:41] right uh but because it's the truth it's
[2:16:45] it's a lot a lot going on and it's it's
[2:16:48] more people going through struggles and
[2:16:52] things of that nature and I'm gonna tell
[2:16:54] you something
[2:16:55] folk need somebody with some skills
[2:17:01] right
[2:17:02] something more than a message of uh you
[2:17:06] need the Holy Ghost
[2:17:08] I remember my kids were home and they
[2:17:10] would go to youth meetings and they used
[2:17:13] to come home and they should be Dad we
[2:17:14] Tyler just we're just tired of hearing
[2:17:16] they probably they probably didn't have
[2:17:18] what they thought they had but that's
[2:17:20] another another something but we we need
[2:17:23] we need something more than just you
[2:17:26] know the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost we
[2:17:29] need information
[2:17:30] [Music]
[2:17:32] we need real real information that's
[2:17:36] going to help us to grow up to be real
[2:17:40] adults
[2:17:42] in Christ
[2:17:44] so when we come in contact with people
[2:17:47] we got something to talk about
[2:17:50] [Music]
[2:17:52] right amen you know it's a real tough
[2:17:56] job I'm telling you church and and
[2:17:59] sometimes you know being a pastor you
[2:18:02] you you you you could preach a sermon
[2:18:05] and preach sermons and you could get so
[2:18:08] caught up in in church and church folk
[2:18:12] and you realize man my family just went
[2:18:15] so lacking because you put everything
[2:18:17] into trying to keep the church going
[2:18:19] trying to keep everybody else in life
[2:18:21] and your family is falling completely
[2:18:24] apart
[2:18:25] completely apart one thing I could say I
[2:18:29] was faithful I was there I did the very
[2:18:32] best I can but sometimes I look I put
[2:18:34] too much energy in the in the church and
[2:18:37] church folk and everything else is that
[2:18:40] right
[2:18:42] I don't think I ever passed again and
[2:18:44] but if I do
[2:18:46] it'll be a lot of changing because I
[2:18:48] believe that that I've grown up my
[2:18:50] children are grown but you know I got a
[2:18:52] grandbaby coming
[2:18:55] amen and and I still got children I got
[2:18:59] three boys at home and and uh
[2:19:03] you know
[2:19:05] just taking the opportunities to because
[2:19:09] your children they can always be your
[2:19:10] children they're gonna always be needy
[2:19:13] and I just want to be able to have what
[2:19:16] they need
[2:19:18] the information to be able to sit down
[2:19:21] and have real conversation
[2:19:24] real adult conversation
[2:19:27] not well you know you out there smoking
[2:19:30] that weed they know they smoking weed
[2:19:31] they'll need you to tell them that every
[2:19:33] time you see them
[2:19:35] but you still getting hot yeah they're
[2:19:37] getting high you know that and they know
[2:19:39] that but they don't they need something
[2:19:41] more from you than a criticism
[2:19:46] right
[2:19:48] and sometimes that's why they don't come
[2:19:50] because they know that's all they're
[2:19:51] gonna get is the criticism why are you
[2:19:53] doing it you still doing that what is
[2:19:55] this
[2:19:57] instead of instead of us being uh open
[2:20:02] and in spiritual and on a level to learn
[2:20:05] how to communicate I'm learning how to
[2:20:09] communicate with my with my with my
[2:20:13] adult children
[2:20:15] it's hard
[2:20:19] but I tell you what one thing and I'm
[2:20:21] gonna go one thing that makes it easy
[2:20:23] for me easier it ain't easy easy but
[2:20:26] it's easier I have to look back and
[2:20:29] realize boy
