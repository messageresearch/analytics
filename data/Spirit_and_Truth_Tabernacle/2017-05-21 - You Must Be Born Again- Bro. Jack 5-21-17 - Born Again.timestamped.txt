[52:42] youth but even so I'm going to use that
[52:44] used to attend this church I still got
[52:46] them on the list right what I'm going in

[54:08] know some of the young people that I
[54:09] might not see them here every Sunday but
[54:11] I still call them active members in this
[54:13] church I'd say that by Fetty I call you
[54:16] an active member you can't go nowhere
[54:18] you don't ride you know where home is
[54:22] right so so we call them active members
[54:25] and what we're what we're looking to do
[54:26] sometimes you can't get people to come
[54:28] to church but you can get into
[54:29] fellowship
[54:31] and if we create a right environment in
[54:33] a fellowship the next thing you know
[54:35] you'd be whipping them right back to
[54:36] church you got to get them in for me and
[54:38] surround us and you can have good Holy
[54:41] Ghost clean fun you can do that and you
[54:48] know a member when we're doing this
[54:50] we're parents want you to know we're
[54:52] including you know even the little ones
[54:54] we want them growing up in these
[54:56] environments right we want them we'll
[54:57] have things for them to do and but uh
[55:00] but we got something you know that we
[55:01] want to do we got two more times this
[55:03] year that I know that a plan we also
[55:06] mentioned to the young people there
[55:08] would be opportunities we're looking at
[55:10] doing a man a possibly make look for the
[55:15] young people and and then also we have
[55:19] you know a little something that we we
[55:21] heard about when we were in Africa a
[55:23] couple years ago we were in Ghana and it
[55:25] had some young people do like a debate
[55:27] and they took a little subject and they
[55:29] debated you know that the subject that
[55:32] they had to use scriptures and quotes
[55:34] and they got points based on based on
[55:36] what they use to support their position
[55:38] though but I something that we want to
[55:41] just kind of bring up nothing and we
[55:43] don't want to get too out of control
[55:44] praise the Lord but but something then
[55:47] just kind of just just make it a little
[55:49] fun for the young people here and there
[55:50] and I will be bringing that you know

[1:05:05] chapter 3 a man praise the Lord
[1:05:22] John chapter 3 and starting here verse 1
[1:05:34] John 3 starting at verse 1 says there
[1:05:41] was a man of the Pharisees named
[1:05:45] Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same
[1:05:50] came to Jesus by night and said unto him
[1:05:55] rabbi we know that thou art a teacher
[1:05:57] come from God for no man can do these
[1:06:02] miracles that thou doest except God be
[1:06:05] with him jesus answered and said unto
[1:06:08] Him verily verily I say unto thee except
[1:06:12] a man be born again he cannot see the
[1:06:17] kingdom of God and Nicodemus said to him
[1:06:21] how can a man be born when he is old can
[1:06:25] he enter the second time into his
[1:06:27] mother's womb and be born jesus answered
[1:06:31] verily verily I say unto thee except a
[1:06:33] man be born of water and of the spirit
[1:06:38] he cannot enter into the kingdom of God
[1:06:41] that which is born of the flesh is flesh
[1:06:45] and that which is born of the Spirit is
[1:06:48] spirit Marvel not that I said unto thee
[1:06:54] ye must be born again a man the Lord had
[1:06:59] a blessing to the reading of his word
[1:07:01] you may be seated and man here today
[1:07:05] and we want to take our subject amen our
[1:07:10] title from the words of Jesus ye must be
[1:07:14] born again amen you must be born again I
[1:07:21] this topic had come upon my heart some
[1:07:26] time ago and I had a little I preached
[1:07:29] this respect it was my mind I want to
[1:07:32] say my first sermon that I preached when
[1:07:36] I was invited out side to go preach I
[1:07:39] went to church Stan Riviera Beach and
[1:07:43] my cousin was pastoring he invited me to
[1:07:45] come preach and you know and I went in
[1:07:48] and I said I took this topic and he must
[1:07:51] be born again and we had a wonderful
[1:07:53] time but you know after I preached the
[1:07:55] sermon I went home and as I was home I
[1:07:59] just felt all this weight you know on my
[1:08:02] shoulders and I just could not
[1:08:05] understand what was really transpiring
[1:08:08] eyes man I just I don't know if I said
[1:08:10] something wrong if I did something wrong
[1:08:13] I had no idea what it was so I called my
[1:08:16] cousin back I said you know I want to
[1:08:18] apologize if I said something in the
[1:08:20] pulpit that was wrong this morning then
[1:08:22] please forget me because I'm just not
[1:08:24] feeling you know something just don't
[1:08:27] feel right I don't know what it is and
[1:08:29] they say oh you're just the young
[1:08:31] preacher you got apologized to nothing
[1:08:33] at the Bible say you know if the Bible
[1:08:35] said then we all say Amen till you
[1:08:38] apologize and letting in the scripture
[1:08:40] and I tell you what when he told me that
[1:08:41] iron follows and nobody but nothing in
[1:08:44] the Bible cuz I ain't put it there
[1:08:48] Amen I'm just repeating what Jesus said
[1:08:51] and he said you must a man be born again
[1:08:55] and then that that applies to everybody
[1:08:57] in here right from the pulpit to the
[1:09:00] back though we all got this requirement
[1:09:02] that we must be born again and and I
[1:09:06] just want to just try to deal with that
[1:09:07] but you know I found out later on what
[1:09:09] that weight was it was a weight of the
[1:09:11] people a man that uh that the Lord had
[1:09:14] allowed us to kind of feel that we'd be
[1:09:16] carrying the weight and the burdens of
[1:09:18] the people you know so we thank God for
[1:09:21] that he just kind of kind of brought us
[1:09:22] through that for a little bit but I want
[1:09:24] to talk about this on today the other
[1:09:27] other of the prophet preached on this
[1:09:29] sermon you must be born again but at the
[1:09:32] beginning of the sermon he did something
[1:09:35] and he told the people say go home and
[1:09:37] read Ephesians go home and read
[1:09:40] Ephesians chapter 4 and a few verses
[1:09:43] there so you know we're gonna read that
[1:09:45] this morning as we get started just turn
[1:09:47] with me to Ephesians chapter 4 praise
[1:09:51] the Lord and remember our topic is you
[1:09:54] must be born again
[1:09:56] and must be must be there is no way
[1:09:59] around it a man this is this is a
[1:10:02] requirement from God of that each one
[1:10:05] has to a man meet and the other thing
[1:10:08] about this requirement
[1:10:09] many churches you go to and you hear
[1:10:11] them preach this sermon and everybody
[1:10:13] got their own definitions that's the hot
[1:10:16] a field this applies or what they think
[1:10:19] it means you know what does it really
[1:10:22] mean to be born again right and now and
[1:10:24] we want to try that we want to try to
[1:10:25] give it from a scriptural standpoint
[1:10:27] what this really means a man to be born
[1:10:30] again because this something that
[1:10:31] everybody got to come to oh hallelujah
[1:10:34] glory to God I mean the other thing I
[1:10:37] want you to understand about this this
[1:10:38] dis dis this statement this is Jesus
[1:10:41] first doctrine right this is his first
[1:10:44] doctrine when you read the book of John
[1:10:46] and you know in John just kind of laying
[1:10:48] out what happened in the beginning there
[1:10:49] in John 1 and then John to Jesus turning
[1:10:53] the water into wine and beat some people
[1:10:55] out the temple and things like that
[1:10:56] but when he opened up his mouth and
[1:10:58] began to preach the first thing come out
[1:11:00] as ye must be born again
[1:11:02] his first doctrine right and so Jesus is
[1:11:05] gonna say something like that we better
[1:11:06] take heed to what Jesus trying to tell
[1:11:08] us he must no no no no no if ands buts
[1:11:13] no shortcuts it is it's absolutely
[1:11:16] impossible for you to go to heaven if
[1:11:18] you not born again
[1:11:19] oh my god Amen we got we got to get this
[1:11:23] thing right yes I you know I was I was
[1:11:26] I'm coming here he feeders for but the
[1:11:28] Lord was all sharing me is people going
[1:11:30] to church every day and they dive and
[1:11:33] going the hell going to church right in
[1:11:37] the church the Advanta going to hell the
[1:11:38] reason is because they have not come to
[1:11:41] this place where they've been born again
[1:11:42] the reason you see all kind of pumps and
[1:11:44] things like that in life because that
[1:11:46] person has not come to a complete death
[1:11:48] oh yeah they religious we got that
[1:11:52] people people know how to do the part
[1:11:54] but we've not talked about being
[1:11:55] religious we talked about being born
[1:11:57] again come on it's gonna take a new
[1:12:00] verse hallelujah God ain't happy just
[1:12:03] with people just going to charge God
[1:12:06] want to birth a man there's got to be a
[1:12:08] new nature
[1:12:09] comes alive inside of people we talk
[1:12:11] about being born again let's let's read
[1:12:13] this Ephesians 4 he picked this up and
[1:12:15] they start reading at verse 11 it says
[1:12:18] that he gave some apostles and some
[1:12:22] prophets and some evangelists and some
[1:12:26] pastors and teachers and man this is
[1:12:29] what God did he gave apostles he gave
[1:12:32] prophets he gave evangelists
[1:12:34] he gave pastors who gave teachers now
[1:12:36] now when God you know let me just put it
[1:12:38] this way there's a lot of people that a
[1:12:40] man went but not everybody was sent so
[1:12:48] it's a lot of folks you hear on the
[1:12:49] radio preached by God and call their
[1:12:51] people to preach amen hallelujah we
[1:12:54] might as well just be on it's a lot of
[1:12:56] tests got up and went but God did not
[1:12:58] send them people but when he gave you an
[1:13:01] apostle when he get oh my god they may
[1:13:05] not somebody making themselves an
[1:13:07] apostle right not somebody making
[1:13:10] themselves a pastor a teacher or
[1:13:12] anything though you can't make yourself
[1:13:13] this God got to send you got got some
[1:13:17] night you to be this and when he ignored
[1:13:20] you to be that he has a purpose for
[1:13:22] doing it and that purpose is found in
[1:13:24] verse 12 for the perfecting of the
[1:13:28] Saints for the work of the ministry for
[1:13:31] the edifying of the body of Christ verse
[1:13:34] 13 goes on also say to we all come into
[1:13:37] the unity of the faith and the knowledge
[1:13:40] of the Son of God unto a perfect man
[1:13:42] unto the measure of the stature of the
[1:13:45] fullness of Christ who are going to
[1:13:47] church it's not going to be good enough
[1:13:48] God is trying to bring us to a place of
[1:13:49] perfection in him and the ministry is
[1:13:52] supposed to help you get there I'm going
[1:13:55] on verse 14 this also is further when it
[1:13:58] when it gives you a pastor gives you a
[1:13:59] property gives you an evangelist he
[1:14:01] gives you you know a teacher he gives
[1:14:03] you that said that we henceforth be no
[1:14:05] more children tossed to and fro and
[1:14:09] carried about with every wind of
[1:14:11] doctrine by the sleight of men
[1:14:14] hallelujah and cunning craftiness
[1:14:16] whereby they lie in wait to
[1:14:19] deceive hallelujah but speaking the
[1:14:23] truth in love may grow up and I'm
[1:14:25] turning into him and all things which is
[1:14:28] the head even Christ now you know the
[1:14:30] Prophet just used this this description
[1:14:33] saying I go home and look at it but he
[1:14:35] kept making a few points there when I
[1:14:37] went back and listened to the sermon you
[1:14:38] must be born again he said now notice
[1:14:41] the Paul says that we have to grow up
[1:14:43] into him because what happened that
[1:14:46] people come to the Lord and they think
[1:14:48] they grow soon as they come
[1:14:50] oh my god amen but but you got to grow
[1:14:54] up hallelujah you I mean when Pete Wentz
[1:14:58] when children are born they're born
[1:14:59] babies not born man
[1:15:02] let me say it again when children are
[1:15:05] naturally born they are born babies and
[1:15:07] not man so when they're pennette
[1:15:11] pennette we're born and baby those
[1:15:12] feelings reading and staying here
[1:15:13] recently and it was a you know man

[1:20:09] building out of God hello somebody
[1:20:14] Amen that you got to be born again you
[1:20:19] got to be here we see this with with
[1:20:23] Nicodemus here he comes to the Lord
[1:20:27] Jesus you know at night you don't want
[1:20:30] nobody to know that he coming so he
[1:20:32] sneaks in there but the good thing about
[1:20:34] it he got there right where he had to
[1:20:38] sneak to get there or whatever it took
[1:20:40] but Nicodemus got into the presence of
[1:20:42] the Lord Jesus because Jesus was the
[1:20:44] only person that could give him light in
[1:20:46] the midst of its darkness a man and
[1:20:48] you know here here here here Jesus tell
[1:20:50] us thing now you know you got to be born
[1:20:52] again he said and I just love the way
[1:20:54] these words to put here in the scripture
[1:20:57] in verse 3 he said there and you know
[1:21:01] let me just work with it just a little
[1:21:02] bit here from the scripture verse 2 it
[1:21:05] says John 3 it says that the same came
[1:21:07] to Jesus by night and said to him rabbi
[1:21:09] we know that thou art a teacher from God
[1:21:12] for no man can do these miracles that
[1:21:15] thou doest except God be with him now
[1:21:18] III think Jesus appreciates these words
[1:21:22] that Nicodemus is saying a man and and
[1:21:25] oftentimes even me as a minister you
[1:21:27] know people would come say pastor I
[1:21:29] really enjoyed that and pastor I really
[1:21:31] thank God for you and pastor a pastor
[1:21:33] you know and and all that's great but
[1:21:35] you know what amen I can't be moved by
[1:21:39] flattery Jesus could not be moved by
[1:21:44] flattery right I mean it's nothing wrong
[1:21:47] with saying a good compliment up to
[1:21:49] somebody people enjoy hearing good
[1:21:51] compliment but if you use that
[1:21:52] compliment try to to try to butter up if
[1:21:58] you're using that compliment to try to
[1:22:00] you know uh I mean just maybe maybe I'm
[1:22:04] a sadist because if I said this way to
[1:22:06] him then maybe they let me get by with
[1:22:08] this not another gospel still the gospel
[1:22:12] the gospel the gospel my house your
[1:22:15] house everybody has the guys were super
[1:22:17] gospel I mean the guys for my wife be
[1:22:21] the guys for my children either gospel
[1:22:23] my momma my brother my sisters all of us
[1:22:26] be the gospel
[1:22:28] ain't no buttering up when they come in
[1:22:31] I mean can you Jesus here is this great
[1:22:33] leader Nicodemus been a greatly speaker
[1:22:35] we know you a teacher I tell them what
[1:22:37] they're talking about
[1:22:38] we know that your teachers that come
[1:22:40] from God nobody could do miracles like
[1:22:42] you Jesus oh no no no that don't mean
[1:22:44] nothing to me what you just said at
[1:22:46] night look at what he tell them verse 3
[1:22:49] Jesus answer sent the barely better
[1:22:51] which means absolutely absolutely right
[1:22:54] he says I send to thee except a man be
[1:22:56] born again he cannot see the kingdom of
[1:22:59] God now this man was religious but
[1:23:02] what I want to understand God is not
[1:23:04] calling for religion
[1:23:06] he was relationship my religion
[1:23:10] relationship right and and we got it we
[1:23:14] got a week we gotta be willing to give
[1:23:16] him that and like I just said earlier
[1:23:17] you know Church I'll be careful you know
[1:23:20] you gotta give people you see them Jeff
[1:23:22] coming to church give them chance to
[1:23:24] grow you gotta let people grow they
[1:23:27] supposed to grow up and you're supposed
[1:23:29] to be able to watch that just just spot
[1:23:30] forward amen
[1:23:32] it ain't gonna happen overnight I had a
[1:23:36] you know I was telling a couple people
[1:23:38] this and I would tell saying that when
[1:23:40] you grow it's a way to grow amen
[1:23:44] when you grow grow like a oak tree but
[1:23:49] not like a mushroom because both of them
[1:23:54] grow all three girls and a mushroom
[1:23:57] girls both of them will grow the same
[1:24:00] ring will make both of them grow but the
[1:24:02] problem is the mushroom it come up
[1:24:03] overnight in his kick down just like
[1:24:05] that
[1:24:06] it ain't got no real roots I mean a lot
[1:24:11] more go over the top of that that
[1:24:12] mushroom is done but you try to take
[1:24:15] your lump against a big old oak tree
[1:24:17] your lawnmower be done we want
[1:24:22] Christians to be like Oh trees rooted
[1:24:26] and grounded in piloting gods but you
[1:24:30] got to get people time to grow not not
[1:24:34] no 1 week 2 week no no give them time to
[1:24:37] grow praise the Lord hallelujah glory to
[1:24:41] God and when they're really in the
[1:24:42] presence of God they can grow you know I
[1:24:44] mean their growth don't take 40 years it
[1:24:48] can be a little faster I know some of
[1:24:50] y'all already think my brother Jack what
[1:24:51] about in in Moses day when they put the
[1:24:54] branch inside the from the warden
[1:24:56] overnight it blossom that was a miracle
[1:25:00] just to prove who God was with but that
[1:25:03] ain't no way he want Christians growing
[1:25:05] overnight hallelujah
[1:25:09] all right you got to be born again
[1:25:11] barely realized anything except a man be
[1:25:13] born again he cannot see the kingdom of
[1:25:15] God
[1:25:16] so it's impossible for you to see the
[1:25:18] kingdom god amen if you haven't been
[1:25:20] born again now let me go a little
[1:25:23] further with that so Nicodemus said to
[1:25:25] him how can a man be born now he's
[1:25:28] trying to figure this out you know what
[1:25:29] you mean Jesus by being born again how
[1:25:33] is this right I mean you know your stand
[1:25:36] being born again that a man can't even
[1:25:38] go to heaven without being born again
[1:25:40] this is that's that's a very hard
[1:25:42] statement as avera I mean but it's the
[1:25:45] truth it's what Jesus saying you have to
[1:25:47] be born again
[1:25:49] y'all just work with me here work with
[1:25:51] me see so Nicodemus said to him how can
[1:25:54] a man be born when he is old because and
[1:25:57] what brother Brahim saying Nicodemus
[1:25:58] come maybe about 80 years old to Jesus
[1:26:01] can you imagine man 80 years old
[1:26:04] and Jesus Hope says you got to be born
[1:26:05] again now wait a minute wait a minute
[1:26:07] wait a minute I have never heard of
[1:26:10] anybody talking anything like this born
[1:26:13] again born again how does this work
[1:26:15] here Jesus come so you got you got to be
[1:26:17] born again so nobody can even enter
[1:26:19] can't even see the kingdom of God can't
[1:26:21] even see it unless you're born again
[1:26:23] Nicodemus said to him how can a man be
[1:26:25] born when he is old can he enter the
[1:26:26] second time into the mother's womb and
[1:26:29] be born so he's trying to figure it out
[1:26:31] Jesus goes on to explain a little bit
[1:26:33] more verse 5 said Jesus was barely
[1:26:34] barely out sanity except a man be born
[1:26:37] of water and of spirit he cannot enter
[1:26:41] to the kingdom of God see that which is
[1:26:43] born of the flesh is flesh and that
[1:26:45] which is born of the Spirit is spirit so
[1:26:47] to be born of the water and of the
[1:26:50] Spirit now what so when when we talk
[1:26:53] about being born the water is talking
[1:26:54] back to natural birth right and this is
[1:26:57] the way I'm you coming out of the womb
[1:26:58] and you're born one way now now the
[1:27:00] other thing you need understand by - the
[1:27:02] natural birth there's certain
[1:27:03] characteristics that go with your
[1:27:04] natural birth there's certain genes that
[1:27:07] come hallelujah amen you can't help but
[1:27:11] I mean you might you might try your best
[1:27:13] not to look like a certain parent you
[1:27:16] might get upset when people tell you
[1:27:17] that you look like a certain parent but
[1:27:19] because that gene is there it's going to
[1:27:21] dominate your life and you cannot
[1:27:24] separate yourself from that parent
[1:27:26] and then there's blood that that that
[1:27:29] attaches you two together
[1:27:31] holla I don't care how much you want to
[1:27:34] disassociate yourself there's something
[1:27:36] there that gonna keep you connected
[1:27:38] Nautilus now I just want to kind of work
[1:27:41] with that just a little bit if I can oh
[1:27:44] god help me help me here
[1:27:45] you know um because I'm you know the
[1:27:48] thing about being born again is that you
[1:27:50] know here you can you can you can the
[1:27:52] reasons you say now you hear you you can
[1:27:55] be born of the flesh that's your natural
[1:27:56] birth I mean here he say you say born of
[1:27:59] the water that's your natural birth but
[1:28:00] when you born of the spirit now that's a
[1:28:02] spiritual birth that's the Holy Ghost
[1:28:05] birth that's the changing up your entire
[1:28:08] nature and then when the spirit comes in
[1:28:11] you stop making excuses that my people
[1:28:13] always been this way see but just by you
[1:28:19] being born from a certain uh lineage or
[1:28:23] into a certain family certain time
[1:28:26] there's certain things that certain
[1:28:28] characteristics that just well with
[1:28:29] their family my god some families
[1:28:33] everybody drinkers everybody smokers
[1:28:38] everybody got these wrong I mean
[1:28:40] everybody got that and you want to say
[1:28:42] well whether I get this this desire for
[1:28:44] it is something that came in you at your
[1:28:47] birth hallelujah not only just because
[1:28:51] of the family opponent because she was
[1:28:53] born in seeing you had that desire to
[1:28:56] sin but that's why Jesus would say you
[1:29:00] got to be born again
[1:29:01] it takes the desire away and that's what
[1:29:08] you're waiting to see people grow up
[1:29:09] into are you grown up to a place where
[1:29:11] that desire is dead you see if people
[1:29:17] nature don't change what happened that
[1:29:20] they come to church they make a
[1:29:21] confession and then they go right back
[1:29:23] out and keep doing the same thing was
[1:29:24] doing Oh hallelujah brother branham talk
[1:29:28] about the pig and how you put a you know
[1:29:31] a let's answer a female Pig and here you
[1:29:34] know you say I'm going to take this pig
[1:29:36] out this pin and I'm going to dress this
[1:29:39] pig up and I'm going
[1:29:40] make this pig act like a lamb and hear
[1:29:43] the pig come out and you put a nice
[1:29:44] dress on it some nice perfume on it and
[1:29:47] say now you go out there and be like the
[1:29:49] Lambs
[1:29:49] as soon as you let the pig go hallelujah
[1:29:53] Lucy let the pickle the pig will not go
[1:29:56] fellowship with the lambs the pig will
[1:29:58] go right on back over that to the hog
[1:30:00] slop with that dress on with that
[1:30:05] perfume on the pig will go right back
[1:30:08] into that fat pimp in and just have some
[1:30:12] fellowship but if you want to pick the
[1:30:14] act like a lamp did some nature on the
[1:30:18] inside of the pig has to change the lamb
[1:30:21] nature save it or act like a live look
[1:30:26] like a pig but acting like a lamb
[1:30:30] because the nature has changed and when
[1:30:34] God comes in and gives you a new spirit
[1:30:36] a man not just a new spirit but gives
[1:30:39] you a new heart and then puts his spirit
[1:30:41] in there then you then we work with
[1:30:43] something then we work with let me say I
[1:30:46] give you a new heart I'll give you a new
[1:30:48] spirit that imma put my spirit in there
[1:30:50] when that process takes place being
[1:30:52] that's when we talk about being born
[1:30:54] again if you if you just if you just
[1:30:58] make a confession and I mean that I'm
[1:31:01] just oh my god just been baptized in
[1:31:04] water but still doing the same old thing
[1:31:07] that they was doing before they got that
[1:31:09] time it shows that there was no real
[1:31:12] birth the Holy Spirit never really came
[1:31:15] in yeah you look look it's not nobody
[1:31:18] judging you you judge yourself your
[1:31:21] actions I mean you know you tell you I'm
[1:31:23] an orange tree emotions but we see
[1:31:25] apples you can keep saying you're sure
[1:31:28] all you want to we know what we see your
[1:31:30] apple tree and ain't nobody gonna argue
[1:31:33] with you
[1:31:36] Alleluia I want you to understand you
[1:31:40] know there's there are certain things
[1:31:42] that that kind of come along with this
[1:31:45] because of your birth just I mean you'll
[1:31:46] steal sinner because he was born one all
[1:31:51] of us was born sinners we read the
[1:31:52] scriptures morning
[1:31:53] all have sinned and come short of the
[1:31:54] glory of God everybody in here everybody
[1:31:57] at Kent King one person point they
[1:31:59] forgot another ones where you were
[1:32:00] sitting I am no I don't care how bad
[1:32:02] your sin is your sin will take you to
[1:32:04] hell
[1:32:06] lying will take you to hell
[1:32:09] just like murder right so I mean you
[1:32:15] ain't no ain't no degrees to sin we do
[1:32:18] that we do that here in our in our
[1:32:21] society you know because we want to put
[1:32:23] these people in this part of the prison
[1:32:25] and these people own hell and got
[1:32:29] sections in it it don't I'm just being
[1:32:33] honest with you if you plan on going
[1:32:38] brother Brando made a statement and I
[1:32:41] love the way you put a say there's not a
[1:32:43] person in here that wants to go to
[1:32:45] torment and I just thought about that
[1:32:48] how many how many in here actually wanna
[1:32:51] go to hell so come on lift your hand
[1:32:54] high you really want to go ain't nobody
[1:32:57] put their hand up stop stop living that
[1:32:59] weight in stop living that way and stop
[1:33:03] acting that way if you really don't want
[1:33:05] to go I think the reason we come to
[1:33:08] church because we want to get right and
[1:33:11] we try to playing games that fake
[1:33:13] churches that ain't tell us how to get
[1:33:15] right huh it is we might as well tell
[1:33:20] the true church glory to God it's only
[1:33:22] the truth I'll make people free Jesus
[1:33:24] said you must be born again so see your
[1:33:30] your your your your first birth right
[1:33:34] your natural birth that you came to this
[1:33:36] earth with you know that I mean that
[1:33:38] brought certain things it brought the
[1:33:41] line it brought the cheating they
[1:33:42] brought the stealing you know you can
[1:33:44] you know you can grow up so innocent in
[1:33:47] an environment but if around you as all
[1:33:50] this seeing you know what any many
[1:33:52] auctions attest to this you if you grew
[1:33:55] up an environment everybody drinking
[1:33:56] when you get old enough you're going to
[1:33:58] be doing the same thing they doing even
[1:34:01] even if you go to church and you back
[1:34:03] try the first thing you do is go back to
[1:34:06] that old nature that you
[1:34:07] were born in oh my hallelujah you go
[1:34:12] back to that all nature because that's
[1:34:14] what your people did the only thing that
[1:34:17] separates you from them the reason that
[1:34:19] you can go amongst in there and not feel
[1:34:21] the same way that they feel because a
[1:34:23] bird has taken plate but she has people
[1:34:29] growing up you want to see how to
[1:34:31] respond when they get back amongst a
[1:34:32] family Oh glory to God because family
[1:34:37] members oh my most of God has got got
[1:34:40] involved with something because a family
[1:34:42] member
[1:34:43] introduced it to us a family member did
[1:34:48] it family members will bring drugs to
[1:34:50] you family members will bring alcohol to
[1:34:53] you family members in their in you trust
[1:34:57] them I know nowadays the world is crazy
[1:35:01] I'ma be honest the world is crazy people
[1:35:03] do all kind of crazy stuff with people
[1:35:05] they need to never met one time in a
[1:35:07] life they still doing so that's that's
[1:35:10] crazy to me but for the average person
[1:35:12] you ain't just gonna meet somebody off
[1:35:14] the street Lee offer you any man you
[1:35:16] want to hit from this I don't know you
[1:35:18] like that
[1:35:20] well you ain't gonna take it from them
[1:35:22] but let a family member I close friend
[1:35:24] do it you'll be right there all over it
[1:35:29] and that was the devil annoyed to them
[1:35:32] to get to you let's see when you grow up
[1:35:34] you can look that thing in eyes and said
[1:35:36] no no no no no no no no I don't do that
[1:35:38] number and the reason you can say I
[1:35:40] don't do it no more because I had a new
[1:35:42] purse see the new birth is an experience
[1:35:47] I mean it's a real experience that God
[1:35:51] does something on the inside of you and
[1:35:53] what happens when the birth happens on
[1:35:56] when it truly happens on the inside
[1:35:58] what what what happened is that you
[1:36:00] become like a dove you begin to take on
[1:36:03] the nature see when John saw the Spirit
[1:36:06] come down like a dove on Christ that
[1:36:09] same nature wants to come in you and
[1:36:11] when when you got true dumb nature on
[1:36:14] the inside of you
[1:36:15] I love don't have to take the bath a
[1:36:17] bath don't have to go wash itself
[1:36:21] the dog has something inside that washes
[1:36:23] it outside
[1:36:25] hallelujah somebody and when you really
[1:36:28] got holy spirit of nature it will it
[1:36:30] will it will be an experience on the
[1:36:32] inside that will reflect itself on the
[1:36:34] outside I'm going I'm going on
[1:36:39] absolutely absolutely you got to be born
[1:36:43] again not just reciting a prayer not a
[1:36:46] Crete but it's a it's an experience that
[1:36:49] you got to have with God and see the new
[1:36:52] birth goes beyond your good intentions
[1:36:55] you know some people have got good
[1:36:57] intentions they just want to be church
[1:36:58] members can I go a little further than
[1:37:01] that some people even go further and
[1:37:03] just be in church minutes they were
[1:37:04] painting tithes and offerings to the
[1:37:06] church they will support the church but
[1:37:10] they won't get right with the Word of
[1:37:11] God God don't want you to do that why
[1:37:16] why come that father come that close the
[1:37:19] truth and don't go all the way with
[1:37:21] y'all gonna let me preach alright I got
[1:37:26] a couple of things I wanted to share
[1:37:27] here let me let me read something out of
[1:37:29] a hidden life with Christ's hidden life
[1:37:32] with Christ praise the Lord since this
[1:37:40] the Bible said that he would give us a
[1:37:43] new heart and he would give us a new
[1:37:45] spirit and many people even Pentecostal
[1:37:48] people in full gospel people has been
[1:37:49] deceived in that many times God said
[1:37:52] I'll give you a new spirit that wasn't
[1:37:55] his spirit right the new spirit wasn't
[1:37:58] his spirit that's your spirit right so
[1:38:01] when you say I'll give you a new heart
[1:38:02] and I'll give you a new spirit that's
[1:38:04] that's your spirit right it says I then
[1:38:07] I'll put my spirit in you I'll give you
[1:38:11] a new spirit then I will put my spirit
[1:38:13] in you and many times you get the new
[1:38:16] spirit and think you got the holy spirit
[1:38:19] and trusting upon emotions and signs and
[1:38:23] things when your life doesn't give you
[1:38:26] up to that now that's just a little role
[1:38:28] but remember is the truth many people
[1:38:31] the spirit the new spirit God God had to
[1:38:34] give you a new spirit to get along with
[1:38:36] his spirit well some people so mean in
[1:38:41] church some people saw me they can't
[1:38:45] even get along with themselves that's
[1:38:48] bad when you don't want to hang with
[1:38:50] your own style
[1:38:53] that's bad they're so mean they can't
[1:38:59] even get along with themselves all right
[1:39:02] let me go he says let alone with God if
[1:39:06] he come in so you won't even be able to
[1:39:08] agree with God that's right so doubtful
[1:39:11] and up and down God has to give you a
[1:39:13] new spirit gives you a new nature so you
[1:39:16] can get along with his spirit when it
[1:39:18] comes a man I hope you see it God gives
[1:39:21] you a new spirit for yourself and then
[1:39:23] puts his Holy Spirit in there amen to
[1:39:25] dwell with you and to abide with you now
[1:39:29] um there's a you know I was as I was
[1:39:32] just listening to the sermon here on you
[1:39:34] must be born again
[1:39:35] you know the Prophet just kind of went
[1:39:37] on to share some things it started say
[1:39:38] how it's the pastor's duty to make sure
[1:39:41] that the flock is staying right right
[1:39:45] you know sometimes as a pastor you'll
[1:39:47] see little things you see this you see
[1:39:49] that and you just kind of okay up say
[1:39:51] nothing
[1:39:52] start just praying for the people but I
[1:39:54] found out as being pastors that people
[1:39:56] will not make change unless you say
[1:39:58] thanks from the pulpit and that's a
[1:40:00] shame that you just can't reads out of
[1:40:03] the word for yourself and say Lord I'm
[1:40:05] aligned up with that but the pastor
[1:40:07] gotta actually say things from the
[1:40:09] pulpit to help people get in line amen
[1:40:13] right so you know up and your life makes
[1:40:17] me do that I want you to get that your
[1:40:22] life what you do with your life makes me
[1:40:24] come up here and say certain things I
[1:40:26] just want to come up here and preach for
[1:40:28] some time I got to stop and preach
[1:40:30] message like this because our life is
[1:40:32] backsliding it's back fine I mean going
[1:40:36] to church every day yeah I know but
[1:40:38] still backsliding hallelujah you might
[1:40:41] not look like everybody else in the
[1:40:43] world but you so act like them
[1:40:46] a man church and I should say we act
[1:40:48] like them

[1:46:46] some of y'all got most fax box forces
[1:46:48] you know about your Bible
[1:46:56] that's that nature they got to die right
[1:46:59] and that's imma get there i'ma read a
[1:47:01] scripture for you on that one okay let
[1:47:03] me go on it's my duty as a pastor to
[1:47:05] make you make sure you're fit right
[1:47:07] brother branham say when a horse get to
[1:47:09] eat local we then you can't do nothing
[1:47:13] with them local we will kill a horse
[1:47:16] so as the pastor and I'm watching on the
[1:47:19] flock I got to keep the local weed out
[1:47:24] it might start with sports huh
[1:47:28] it might be a lot of other things in
[1:47:30] your life that local weed and I got to
[1:47:32] keep it at you know when you get born
[1:47:36] again it changes your outward appearance
[1:47:41] because when we when we of the world we
[1:47:43] dressed like the world we look like the
[1:47:45] world but we come to Christ we don't
[1:47:47] look like the world no more
[1:47:48] y'all know holiness is still right and
[1:47:53] come on now y'all y'all grew up on
[1:47:55] holiness yeah we knew Pentecostal people
[1:47:58] when we saw them we knew them some of us
[1:48:02] grew up Pentecost and when they started
[1:48:04] letting the world coming to the pinnacle
[1:48:05] search they start looking just like the
[1:48:07] Baptist's and everybody else and now the
[1:48:11] Pentecost searching what it used to be
[1:48:13] the power ain't there no more there used
[1:48:16] to fear God walking into the Pentecostal
[1:48:18] church if you have sin in your life you
[1:48:21] didn't go in there like that you got you
[1:48:23] you repented before you hit the dull not
[1:48:26] people just bring seeing right on into
[1:48:28] the church don't even care nothing about
[1:48:30] it can I just y'all gonna let me talk
[1:48:33] this much folk drink in front of a
[1:48:35] preacher used to be time your hide you
[1:48:43] hide no no no no no I'm you see people
[1:48:45] walking and you know they have those
[1:48:47] something if they put in the bag they
[1:48:48] hide it they got it they got it and you
[1:48:51] already know what they doing but they
[1:48:52] trying to hide it and they certainly
[1:48:53] went drinking in front of you but now
[1:48:57] what's up preach
[1:49:02] Church we need a new birth and anybody
[1:49:07] sailing so I might as well be the first
[1:49:08] one to see it
[1:49:09] right cuz ain't nobody gonna say nothing
[1:49:10] about it right I mean how we expect to
[1:49:13] go to heaven living like that good ain't
[1:49:17] gonna happen
[1:49:18] and in st. second just fellowship a
[1:49:22] little stuff like that all the time
[1:49:24] something wrong with your spirit that
[1:49:26] oughta bother you I know my spirit just
[1:49:30] get upset no no I can't do this I cannot
[1:49:34] do this I don't do so much of it and I'm
[1:49:37] out because my spirit just can't handle
[1:49:40] it hey man some of us just look forward
[1:49:43] to it something wrong we need to be born
[1:49:46] again
[1:49:49] local weed let me tell you a little bit
[1:49:51] about local weed because if you start
[1:49:53] eating locally it'll kill you
[1:49:55] a horse get ahold of some local wheat
[1:49:57] here to do some damage it's a local
[1:50:00] wheat is toxic for two reasons the first
[1:50:02] is that it has a toxic compound called
[1:50:06] swain so 9 that is an alkaloid and this
[1:50:10] alkaloid causes swelling of components
[1:50:12] of the nervous system after it
[1:50:15] accumulates in the body for time it must
[1:50:18] be consumed for a period of at least two
[1:50:20] weeks before it causes a reaction
[1:50:22] the second reason they are the reason
[1:50:25] that local we can be forces is because
[1:50:27] some species are selenium accumulators
[1:50:31] horses can tolerate very little selenium
[1:50:35] above the recommended intakes and
[1:50:37] accumulator plants often have levels
[1:50:40] drastically beyond the safe level now I
[1:50:43] might not know too much about that but
[1:50:45] brother Josue know everything that I
[1:50:46] just say it because he's work with
[1:50:49] horses right now listen some of the
[1:50:51] symptoms of our horse Enslin that he's
[1:50:54] on ate local weed you might not even
[1:50:56] know he ate it you might not have no
[1:50:58] idea but he'll start showing symptoms of
[1:51:00] it notice now it took two weeks before
[1:51:03] the bank start manifesting stuff
[1:51:04] halle-loo
[1:51:06] yeah one of the things that happens with
[1:51:09] the horses we see excessive validation
[1:51:12] he don't got a whole
[1:51:13] local week this one was kind of strange
[1:51:18] to me if you see the horse aimlessly
[1:51:20] wandering just Darren what you looking
[1:51:28] at that's what happened when y'all look
[1:51:34] at TV you can't even get people
[1:51:38] attention oh you don't got a host of
[1:51:50] local wheat do you need deliverance do
[1:51:55] you need to be born again you see that
[1:51:58] kind of a and I'm so so you get to
[1:52:01] delegate you don't give her on
[1:52:03] everything on TV ain't bad everything
[1:52:05] but some of it most of it most of it 98%
[1:52:09] of it 90% of it is bad even the news is
[1:52:15] bad but here we just sit on feet on that
[1:52:18] all day long
[1:52:20] you ain't read no Bible you ain't done
[1:52:22] nothing just you got to change your diet
[1:52:26] and all the way you can change your diet
[1:52:30] that you got to be born again aimlessly
[1:52:36] wandering on coordination and altered
[1:52:40] gates chronic weight loss another
[1:52:44] another thing symptom is if it's a horse
[1:52:47] got vision problems vision problems
[1:52:53] Lord some of us don't have some local
[1:52:55] weed
[1:52:59] I guess it's lethargy followed by
[1:53:01] extreme outbursts in response to mild
[1:53:03] stimuli you know that these are things
[1:53:07] that happen so we try to keep the local
[1:53:09] weed out you know of the body of Christ
[1:53:11] as well because we don't want to see all
[1:53:13] this I mean your outburst you get that
[1:53:15] from I mean if fffff I want a Christian
[1:53:20] well what were you going to
[1:53:23] I mean really what were you gonna do if
[1:53:25] you weren't a Christian see churches
[1:53:30] it's not hi Christians even supposed to
[1:53:32] talk it showed that we lost something
[1:53:36] along the way
[1:53:37] we need a new bird this is not nature
[1:53:43] sinful to begin with we were born and
[1:53:45] stand shake through the neck we came
[1:53:47] into the world speaking live if you got
[1:53:49] your father's nature you'll do the
[1:53:50] things your father didn't but when
[1:53:53] you're born again your nature changes
[1:53:55] let me just read something here about
[1:53:56] this family they had a trait in this
[1:54:01] family and what made them different was
[1:54:04] that they were born again you know there
[1:54:06] are certain things I mean if you're you
[1:54:09] know certain things happen in a family
[1:54:10] like I said people start tending to
[1:54:12] start going down those paths if you had
[1:54:14] a loose lady in the family
[1:54:17] praise the Lord she was always in some
[1:54:20] man's face always had a bunch of men in
[1:54:22] and out of the house that girl that grew
[1:54:25] up in that household
[1:54:26] if she's not born again she gonna end up
[1:54:28] just like that loose lady if you had it
[1:54:31] you had a boy watching the daddy play on
[1:54:33] every lady that he could that boy gonna
[1:54:35] grow up with the same spirit on him
[1:54:37] y'all know it's the truth the only thing
[1:54:40] stops that it's because we might have
[1:54:43] this a generational curse know if you
[1:54:45] born again that curse will be broken a
[1:54:49] man you can break the curse just get
[1:54:51] born again and let me tell you something
[1:54:53] when you truly born again like I say
[1:54:55] that does have something inside that
[1:54:57] manifest on the outside when you truly
[1:54:59] born again
[1:55:00] all that stuff that you fighting with
[1:55:01] it'll go away by itself because your
[1:55:04] nature changes your desires change Oh
[1:55:08] God amen amen
[1:55:14] Holly Lou yeah let me let me read about
[1:55:17] this little boy here stay with me on
[1:55:20] this one let me just find it glory to
[1:55:26] God you've got to be born again amen
[1:55:31] Lord Jesus
[1:55:37] when brother Brandon was talking about
[1:55:39] this birth he said now when when he was
[1:55:44] a born-again there were certain things
[1:55:47] that his conversion never took out of
[1:55:49] him and one of the one of the things was
[1:55:52] he still liked to hunt right so when I
[1:55:54] when I thought about I'm going to the
[1:55:55] message of paradox but I thought about
[1:55:57] that see hunting is sport right he
[1:56:01] enjoyed hunting the conversion doesn't
[1:56:03] take that out of you
[1:56:04] however the conversion does help you to
[1:56:07] manage it I like sports but my
[1:56:12] conversion helps me manage that right
[1:56:16] because if I'm not then I just end up
[1:56:18] just my who you know you talk about
[1:56:22] father's becoming couch potatoes and
[1:56:24] stuff like that I mean you did it's
[1:56:25] Saturday comes you can't get that man to
[1:56:27] do nothing he just stuck there to TV and
[1:56:32] can't wait for that season but when
[1:56:37] you're born again search become more
[1:56:39] important we got church I'm going to
[1:56:42] church ain't no church first God always
[1:56:46] first people know when you're born again
[1:56:48] praise the Lord search a man a man all
[1:56:53] right but see your conversion what the
[1:56:55] conversion is it's the Holy Spirit that
[1:56:57] moves the old nature out of you and
[1:56:59] gives push to new nature in you right
[1:57:02] the Holy Spirit takes that old nature
[1:57:04] the things of the world you know if you
[1:57:06] love the things of the world that a love
[1:57:08] of God is not in you yeah I know that
[1:57:10] that's the Bible if you are in love with
[1:57:13] the things of the world the love of God
[1:57:15] is not in you praise the Lord hallelujah
[1:57:22] all right I'm going on a little further
[1:57:24] yeah the Holy Ghost gonna make you live
[1:57:26] holy yes it will we might as well be
[1:57:29] true phenoms about the Holy Ghost would
[1:57:31] make you live holy

[1:57:40] many of you young ladies in here y'all

[1:58:45] when the Holy Ghost y'all know that's
[1:58:48] the truth and I'm wrong what you lookin
[1:58:51] right but look at the Bible straight
[1:58:53] viola exercise profiteth little in the
[1:58:56] wrong should be you know I'm not telling

[2:01:47] glory to God get washed all over again
[2:01:51] you know when Jesus said that uh that he
[2:01:54] that's born of the water and of the
[2:01:56] spirit when a child is born of the water
[2:01:58] you know the first thing to do it that's
[2:02:00] how before they give it to the mama why
[2:02:05] should and the baby is born they go wash
[2:02:10] it and they bring it back to the mama
[2:02:13] same thing in the spirit
[2:02:15] when you watch it when you get born of
[2:02:17] the Spirit you're going to be washed by
[2:02:19] the Spirit then you'll be presented I
[2:02:25] want to talk about this just give me a
[2:02:28] few more minutes I'm gonna talk about
[2:02:29] this this thing that this boy was born
[2:02:31] with but the Holy Ghost is what changes
[2:02:33] then I'm in the message paradox so now
[2:02:35] this young fellas parents his mother's
[2:02:40] German no reflection on the German but
[2:02:43] there is a strain in that family and
[2:02:45] that is they'll just sit and you can
[2:02:48] talk to them and they'll just stare you
[2:02:50] right in the face that's the strain in
[2:02:52] the fam now I'm reading about this
[2:02:53] family but every family got strength and
[2:02:57] you can leave in five stars to start
[2:02:59] just really looking back in from you
[2:03:00] know all of us do this almost did that
[2:03:02] all strange that's in that family
[2:03:05] all right listen it says uh but there's
[2:03:07] a strain of em and that is they'll just
[2:03:09] sit and you can talk to them and they'll
[2:03:11] just stare stare you right in the face
[2:03:13] the the goodness girl system mother
[2:03:15] dasboard her sister I've come down the
[2:03:17] street many more in this young lady be
[2:03:18] setting out in the yard and I say good
[2:03:19] morning to you she just looked at me and
[2:03:22] I stop and I say surefire morning
[2:03:25] she was just standing looking right at
[2:03:27] you an intelligent woman and I say come
[2:03:29] up to see it sometime she's just
[2:03:32] standing look when her brothers are that
[2:03:34] way father and mothers that way now the
[2:03:36] father of the boys is strictly an
[2:03:38] Irishman Moody and high template you
[2:03:41] know sometimes your conversion do take
[2:03:43] some of those things away from me
[2:03:44] sometimes you're still left with some of
[2:03:45] that there's some people we're gonna win
[2:03:49] an argument there was that way before
[2:03:52] they came to Christ and they still that
[2:03:53] way not and i'ma take some time that's
[2:03:56] needed God can use that characteristic
[2:04:00] some time but you gotta know when God
[2:04:03] using it all right I'm going on it says
[2:04:09] up the father that boy is strictly an
[2:04:13] Irishman and and moody and high template
[2:04:16] high strung that's his whole family like
[2:04:19] that except one other elders family
[2:04:21] converted now and this this boy this
[2:04:23] father and mother both are Christians
[2:04:24] feel the Holy Ghost and they have
[2:04:26] brought this young man up in the way of
[2:04:27] the Lord and now the
[2:04:28] about 17 or 18 years old something along
[2:04:31] there very fine kid he's got a real
[2:04:33] model boy at home nice kid he's got a
[2:04:36] brother that's just vice versa but the
[2:04:39] girls the mother family lives close to a
[2:04:41] fine church but do you think they'd ever
[2:04:43] come over there no and they know it's
[2:04:47] right but it's just not in them ask
[2:04:49] forgiveness or ask partner I want y'all
[2:04:52] to catch that because there's some
[2:04:54] people they'll say the reason I don't go
[2:04:56] to that church because y'all talk about
[2:04:57] a prophet I can show you in the Bible
[2:04:58] where God say you'll spin the prophet
[2:05:00] I'll show you that writing your own
[2:05:02] Bible the reason that you don't come is
[2:05:04] because what it's going to require you
[2:05:05] to live that's why let's be honest I
[2:05:11] know what it's going to require me to
[2:05:13] live and I don't want to live that way
[2:05:14] okay fine I respect that but you know
[2:05:19] praise the Lord if you don't heard the
[2:05:22] truth and you die in that condition
[2:05:23] don't expect nobody to put you in heaven
[2:05:28] you rejected the word and you know what
[2:05:31] comes from rejecting the word praise the
[2:05:34] Lord Amen Church I'm I'm just I got to
[2:05:37] be honest with people
[2:05:39] well what good would it be for me to be
[2:05:41] up here just trying to take money I mean
[2:05:43] I thank God that people pay their tithes
[2:05:45] and offering that supports this church
[2:05:47] that that helps my family eat I
[2:05:48] appreciate that
[2:05:50] but about do all that and let y'all go
[2:05:51] to hell what kind of preacher would I be
[2:05:53] I got to stop and tell the truth you got
[2:06:01] to be born again and this message goes
[2:06:05] to your family to let your family know
[2:06:07] you got to be born again that's what a
[2:06:10] stopped us in a bird very good you can't
[2:06:16] beat this out of nobody
[2:06:17] Amen you can't fake it out of a child
[2:06:20] they need a new birth you're gonna have
[2:06:23] to preform that gotta give them the Holy
[2:06:25] Ghost birth all right I'm going on it
[2:06:28] says you think that come over there no
[2:06:31] and they know it's right but it's just
[2:06:33] not in the ask forgiveness or acts
[2:06:35] Parliament they just won't do it it's
[2:06:36] just not in them now the genes in the
[2:06:38] father and the mother that's born no
[2:06:40] matter how much they are converted
[2:06:42] still remains the flesh that's been
[2:06:44] interbred out to this boy
[2:06:47] therefore the boy has has got a complex
[2:06:50] in him just like from his mother's
[2:06:52] family and they are not forgiven so this
[2:06:54] boy's carrying something even though he
[2:06:56] go to church he's still carrying the
[2:06:57] same thing right into you know the
[2:07:00] church now look say they're not forgiven
[2:07:04] they will not apologize and that's where
[2:07:07] that boy stands now I can identify with
[2:07:08] that because I grew up with that same
[2:07:10] type of spirit I couldn't apologize for
[2:07:12] nothing I could be wrong as I as wrong
[2:07:15] could be proven wrong but I still would
[2:07:17] apologize my mom would have to twist my
[2:07:20] ear to get me to go to apologize but
[2:07:24] when the Holy Ghost came in that's what
[2:07:26] man are you wrong about that one go back
[2:07:28] and apologize on that now I can do it
[2:07:31] but it's the new birth that causes me to
[2:07:34] be able to do that before that I
[2:07:35] couldn't do it all right
[2:07:39] listen he says this now I sent to the
[2:07:45] Father no matter how much you raised him
[2:07:47] up
[2:07:48] I said now look at you out of your
[2:07:50] family out of your family all of them
[2:07:55] drunks and fighting and shooting and
[2:07:56] cutting and so forth now look at your
[2:07:58] family to the mother they're a bunch of
[2:08:00] people they just just sat there won't
[2:08:02] speak now you got to be honest with
[2:08:04] these people tell them this what your
[2:08:05] family is can you imagine that or what
[2:08:08] about you know how I'm sitting down with
[2:08:10] your family like this and everybody got
[2:08:12] family like that come on y'all yeah stop
[2:08:15] it you know if some families that easily
[2:08:18] get offended easily
[2:08:22] that's a strain in the family so
[2:08:24] anything less that's just who they are
[2:08:27] and others another family they speak
[2:08:30] rough to one another
[2:08:31] oh come on y'all y'all they speak rough
[2:08:38] and when they come a charge they speak
[2:08:40] rough to people I'm just trying I'm
[2:08:46] trying to get you to see if you can
[2:08:48] understand these things then you don't
[2:08:49] get so offended so easily right people
[2:08:52] got strains in them that the Holy Ghost
[2:08:54] don't take out them
[2:08:56] you need people like that oh my god
[2:08:59] and I just bear with me just for a few
[2:09:02] more minutes I've seen their certain
[2:09:04] people come to church and they got a
[2:09:05] certain spirit and then I see another
[2:09:07] person I got an opposite spirit not see
[2:09:09] them to connect they help each other and
[2:09:13] that sometimes as a pastor I don't even
[2:09:15] have to get in the middle of it because
[2:09:17] I know these two right here they're
[2:09:19] gonna sharpen each other you know God do
[2:09:22] that
[2:09:22] she let opposites attract that's the
[2:09:27] bring our better parts in you all right
[2:09:29] oh my god
[2:09:31] so sometimes it's good that a person got
[2:09:33] that as long as they doing it in the
[2:09:34] right way but everybody you know some
[2:09:39] easily fit it others man they don't care
[2:09:41] about who they offend and you need
[2:09:44] people like that because you know I
[2:09:46] think you need mothers in the church
[2:09:47] that are come to you saying I'm sister
[2:09:49] the way you dressing that's just not you
[2:09:52] know that's not of God and you know just
[2:09:54] please you know you need to you know you
[2:09:57] need to change that you need a mother in
[2:09:59] the church like that you also need one
[2:10:00] stay now what do and they were dressing
[2:10:02] like that you need that one too
[2:10:07] because you think the one that talked to
[2:10:09] your suite and saw you what you overlook
[2:10:11] that now you need one to get in your
[2:10:13] face pull your face Nath prays a lot
[2:10:20] somebody God give you both of them then
[2:10:24] put them in your life for a reason get
[2:10:26] that off your feet get down off your
[2:10:28] fingers you need one like that too I can
[2:10:33] I could when I say something some of
[2:10:34] y'all got on your mind which this is in
[2:10:36] the church there to tell you something
[2:10:37] like that they come from that family
[2:10:39] with that strain thank God that we got
[2:10:46] them here
[2:10:46] the conversion don't take everything out
[2:10:48] of you God uses some of that for his
[2:10:51] glory
[2:10:53] you know I can sum up there's people
[2:10:55] that would just run over you but then
[2:10:59] you got some esterases no no no no you
[2:11:01] can't do that here and maybe the first
[2:11:03] one to let you know thank God for that
[2:11:07] thank God for it let's go
[2:11:09] let's go on I'm going on I'm going on
[2:11:11] hallelujah
[2:11:13] now that don't give you a right to just
[2:11:16] do people in the kind of way you want to
[2:11:17] do them
[2:11:18] ain't no license for that you need to be
[2:11:21] born again but I'm trying to get you to
[2:11:24] understand I'm bringing a balance with
[2:11:26] this amen
[2:11:28] I want to read this I want to read a
[2:11:29] scripture and i'ma let y'all go y'all
[2:11:31] probably say Lord this preachers
[2:11:33] long-winded I told y'all this ain't no
[2:11:36] fast food Church here boy the same fast
[2:11:39] food we sit down and we enjoy our meal
[2:11:42] aid man that's why terse the way it is
[2:11:46] because they nobody takin no time to
[2:11:47] really deal with things a man listen
[2:11:51] says I now says now look at your family
[2:11:55] to the mother they're a bunch of people
[2:11:57] just set there one speak very
[2:11:58] independent so forth irreverent to
[2:12:00] religion but I said it's not you you're
[2:12:03] the only one of all your sisters and
[2:12:05] brothers and you were sweet kind and
[2:12:06] forgiving what does that your your your
[2:12:09] tree part of the family tree yet you
[2:12:11] received the Holy Ghost that's the thing
[2:12:13] that made you tender and sweet it's not
[2:12:15] your people anymore it's your Christ
[2:12:17] that lives in you see she was born again
[2:12:20] I said to the boy look at your family
[2:12:22] practically all of them are drunks and
[2:12:23] so forth I said and how Moody and
[2:12:26] hot-tempered and how strong but you're
[2:12:28] not you're kind forgiving what is it
[2:12:30] the Holy Spirit you're no more what you
[2:12:33] are is Christ in you I said now that's
[2:12:35] the same thing has to happen to your son
[2:12:39] yes son got to be born again that goes
[2:12:44] on he says and the father raised up and
[2:12:46] said my son went to the altar like that
[2:12:50] didn't he was baptized correctly in the
[2:12:54] name of Jesus Christ and water baptism
[2:12:56] in the pool so I know my son has come to
[2:12:58] Christ the prophecy I said that may be
[2:13:03] all right all the outward motions he
[2:13:06] might be identified as a believer with
[2:13:07] the believers but until he is
[2:13:09] regenerated born again I'll advise that
[2:13:12] young man never to marry a woman look at
[2:13:16] what he said he'll make hell on earth
[2:13:20] for ha
[2:13:21] you better lost what'd you get yourself
[2:13:23] involved with you better make sure that
[2:13:25] they've been born again because they'll
[2:13:28] make hell on earth for you he'll make
[2:13:34] hell on earth for her and to that gentle
[2:13:38] sweet forgiving Spirit of Christ comes
[2:13:40] in then that would be a paradox in
[2:13:42] itself to take the very nature of a boy
[2:13:44] that's bred between father and mother
[2:13:46] and yet in his intellectual his trauma
[2:13:48] is best to overcome overcome it he can't
[2:13:51] do it
[2:13:51] he'll never overcome it Christ will have
[2:13:54] to overcome it when he lets Christ in
[2:13:56] then he's already overcome then it'll be
[2:13:59] a perfect paradox when a man is born of
[2:14:01] the Spirit of God I just want to read
[2:14:04] this last script and I'm let you go turn
[2:14:08] with me to Galatians chapter 5
[2:14:22] see again if you love you love the world
[2:14:26] the things the world and love God's
[2:14:27] lighting you we're always constantly
[2:14:29] battling with old nature and you all
[2:14:31] heard the story the black dog and the
[2:14:33] white dog the Indian chief of Santa I'm
[2:14:37] always battling with this black dog and
[2:14:38] white dogs is how you getting along say
[2:14:40] I'm getting along all right but this
[2:14:41] back dog and white dogs always balance
[2:14:43] saying I got one on one shoulder
[2:14:44] speaking one thing another another
[2:14:46] children speaking something else and
[2:14:47] says I will which one when he says the
[2:14:49] one I feed the most so we want the light
[2:14:54] dog to win you have to feed them feed on
[2:14:57] the word of God amen your conversion
[2:15:00] doesn't take certain desires from you
[2:15:02] the Prophet still like the hunt you may
[2:15:04] still enjoy sports but your conversion
[2:15:06] helps you can keep those things under
[2:15:08] control right so brother Brandon would
[2:15:11] not just hunt to kill right he didn't do
[2:15:14] that now if the lion got among some
[2:15:15] sheep or something like that then he
[2:15:16] might be hired to do that but he would
[2:15:18] just go hunting just to kill animals
[2:15:20] that's not what it was and and and and I
[2:15:24] want to just share this when I when I
[2:15:26] when I talk about you know his
[2:15:29] conversion changed things I want to just
[2:15:31] I want to bring something about lying
[2:15:33] hunting into the scripture and then I'll
[2:15:35] close it off Glacius five verse 16 when
[2:15:40] we're born again it changes our nature
[2:15:42] it changes our nature the Bible say this
[2:15:45] this I say then walk in the spirit and
[2:15:47] ye shall not fulfill the lust of the
[2:15:49] flesh said for the flesh lusteth against
[2:15:52] the spirit see that's that white dog and
[2:15:54] that black dog constantly fighting the
[2:15:56] let the lust the flesh lusteth against
[2:15:57] the spirit and the spirit against the
[2:15:59] flesh and these are contrary the one to
[2:16:03] the other so that you cannot do the
[2:16:06] things that you would listen but if you
[2:16:09] be led of the Spirit ye are not under
[2:16:11] the law now the works of the flesh are
[2:16:14] manifest we want to know when we want
[2:16:17] operating in the flesh these things are
[2:16:19] going to manifest which are these
[2:16:20] adultery right now that that'll be when
[2:16:24] you walk in after the flesh adultery
[2:16:26] comes with it right fornication young
[2:16:30] people having sex and not being married
[2:16:32] praise the Lord
[2:16:34] uncleanness praise the Lord and I want
[2:16:38] to break some of these words down as we
[2:16:39] get to them just bear with me just for a
[2:16:42] few minutes
[2:16:43] uncleanness is immoral living right
[2:16:48] uncleanness it says lascivious Sevilla
[2:16:53] sness that's that's just unbridled lust
[2:16:56] you got to get control over the lusts
[2:17:00] amen but these are works of the flesh
[2:17:03] praise the Lord
[2:17:05] idolatry and we got all kind of things
[2:17:08] that we put the folk art we put our jobs
[2:17:11] before God you praise for the job now
[2:17:13] you get you the job but you let your job
[2:17:15] become your God idolatry witchcraft now
[2:17:20] you know what had to stop on that one
[2:17:23] cuz I got a definition on that one that
[2:17:25] I don't think most of us even know you
[2:17:28] know what I just clicked on that word
[2:17:31] witchcraft and you know it talked about
[2:17:33] sorcery magical arts often found in
[2:17:36] connection with idolatry and fostered by
[2:17:38] deceptions and the seductions of
[2:17:40] idolatry but also had a second
[2:17:42] definition it says the use or the
[2:17:44] administering of drunks witchcraft the
[2:17:48] use of drugs you got you got that you
[2:17:53] got the old when you born again you
[2:17:54] don't have that desire anymore you don't
[2:17:57] have a desire to practice witchcraft to
[2:18:01] do drugs hatred variance well what is
[2:18:13] variance variance is strife debate
[2:18:16] that's why I said earlier that we got to
[2:18:18] watch the spirit of debate variance
[2:18:22] right emulations there's the big one
[2:18:25] right there big words but that's
[2:18:27] competitiveness and when you get
[2:18:32] involved with sports it create brings
[2:18:34] that spirit right back out of you it
[2:18:37] does you hate the loose not only had it
[2:18:40] I remember you know that events that I
[2:18:46] used to see man
[2:18:47] the I want to call it karate or whatever
[2:18:51] that Taekwondo they go out there they
[2:18:54] have Taekwondo everybody win now look
[2:18:59] out there you know and and my nephew
[2:19:02] Caleb look good
[2:19:03] Caleb was good he was beating people
[2:19:05] like it up and he don't put somebody on
[2:19:07] the mat and they freeze them up you're
[2:19:08] the winner no they got beat they not the
[2:19:13] winner and when you go around telling
[2:19:15] everybody they win all the time in life
[2:19:17] and that they never lose then they can't
[2:19:20] handle life but the other thing happened
[2:19:23] when you get into that Dunham emulations
[2:19:25] emulations but that's why you got to see
[2:19:28] the conversions what keep that thing on
[2:19:29] the track next thing you know you're
[2:19:32] just doing all kind of stuff your cheat
[2:19:33] to win I want to give an example here
[2:19:39] you know before I go further I promise
[2:19:41] you I'm leaving I'm leaving in a second
[2:19:43] I'm leaving a second but one time for
[2:19:45] the Brandon was out hunting and while he
[2:19:47] was something they had a they were going
[2:19:49] to give out this award to the person
[2:19:51] that got the the largest lion and this
[2:19:55] man went out and shot a lie about nine
[2:19:57] foot four inches and he was so happy he
[2:20:00] shot this lion and brother Brandon had
[2:20:02] shot a lion his line was nine foot eight
[2:20:04] inches and he just you know just he just
[2:20:06] he knew had a nice trophy but he didn't

[2:23:32] thing I heard people say Jesus turn the
[2:23:34] water in the wine but he didn't drink it
[2:23:41] show me what he drunk it and then one
[2:23:44] one fella told us there but they did

[2:23:47] okay you telling me the devil called
[2:23:51] Jesus a wine their blood and you're
[2:23:53] going to take that and use it to be a
[2:23:55] drink so you can drink they also call
[2:23:57] Jesus Beelzebub what did you believe
[2:24:00] about them drunkenness revellings let me
[2:24:12] just tell you know what revellings mean
[2:24:13] and we just read this but I want to give
[2:24:15] you meanings the Revel is a Caracara so
[2:24:19] nocturnal and riotous procession of
[2:24:22] half-drunken frolicsome fellows
[2:24:25] half-drunken now I don't know is it okay
[2:24:28] to be half drunk in a full drunken and
[2:24:30] drinking is a sin half drunken and
[2:24:36] frolicsome fellows who after supper
[2:24:39] because everybody want to get a little
[2:24:41] sip of wine after supper but when you
[2:24:44] get the Holy Ghost you don't have
[2:24:45] his eyes anymore praise the Lord
[2:24:47] somebody the wine bottles leave a man
[2:24:51] somebody you got to be born again right
[2:24:55] they say after after supper will parade
[2:24:58] through the streets with torches and
[2:25:00] music and honor of Bacchus that's what
[2:25:02] that's the false god idol God and I'm a
[2:25:05] Bacchus or some of the deity and sink
[2:25:08] and played before houses of male and
[2:25:10] female friends hence used generally of
[2:25:14] feasts and drinking parties that are
[2:25:16] protracted to late at night and indulge
[2:25:18] in reverie sure they doing suddenly not
[2:25:23] supposed to be doing something that got
[2:25:24] me pleased with so God wants to avoid
[2:25:26] rebel miss ret revellings right and
[2:25:29] suchlike of which i tell you before as i
[2:25:32] have also told you in time past that
[2:25:34] they which do look at this the bible
[2:25:36] state is they which do such things shall
[2:25:38] not exact can I go to head it's not me
[2:25:44] putting you there not the Bible say
[2:25:47] whether you go there and the Bible says
[2:25:48] you shall not you are not going like
[2:25:50] that hello somebody now I'm just
[2:25:54] preaching the wrong gospel I'm a
[2:25:56] preacher at all just this just this I
[2:25:59] mean you know people people want it
[2:26:00] wrong nowadays but I got to give you the
[2:26:03] raw gospel I gotta tell you just like it
[2:26:05] is I might only get one check one chance
[2:26:09] to preach to you and I'm gonna tell you
[2:26:10] I'm gonna take advantage of this chance
[2:26:11] because when you get to heaven your God
[2:26:13] said you heard the truth I had my
[2:26:15] servant day he preached it to you he's
[2:26:17] gonna replay this whole service alright
[2:26:23] it says they that which do such things
[2:26:28] shall not inherit the kingdom of God but
[2:26:30] the fruit of the Spirit so when you're
[2:26:32] born to spit when you've wanted to flesh
[2:26:33] you do those things but when you're born
[2:26:35] in the spirit it changes the fruit of
[2:26:37] Spirit is love what you can talk about
[2:26:42] people and love them at the same time
[2:26:46] they're fruit and I'm time I believe us
[2:26:48] this what believers opposed to be
[2:26:50] producing and if you ain't producing
[2:26:52] this it's time to be born again
[2:26:58] the fruit of the Spirit is love joy
[2:27:01] peace
[2:27:03] you ain't stirring up strife you
[2:27:05] actually try to find a way to get peace
[2:27:07] to it a lot
[2:27:11] yeah no damn number the true some of us
[2:27:13] got wheat some of things you look I'm
[2:27:17] gonna close this up but you know the
[2:27:19] Bible actually say that a where there is
[2:27:22] no wood the fire season which means the
[2:27:28] fire stops if there is no rule what that
[2:27:33] mean the things that you say either add
[2:27:35] to or take wood from the fire a soft
[2:27:39] answer turns away wrath not not a hard
[2:27:45] Oh can't talk to me that way
[2:27:47] who you they talk to Jesus in a kind of
[2:27:54] way and they even spit on him I wonder
[2:27:57] Jaime that's can handle that you know
[2:28:01] you can't handle it you need to be born
[2:28:06] again this this need to be born again
[2:28:16] am I wrong been honest but that's why
[2:28:19] God so you got to be born again because
[2:28:22] if you if you can't take the heat get
[2:28:23] out the kitchen right but but God
[2:28:26] requires a life I bet my remember had my
[2:28:32] best pants on I'm walking down the
[2:28:33] street hanging out with the young people
[2:28:35] I better come down the street and just
[2:28:38] throwing out rotten eggs and just hit me
[2:28:40] with one messed up my pants I'm ready to
[2:28:44] let's go find them find them for wets
[2:28:46] the fruit of spirit is love joy peace
[2:28:54] long-suffering gentleness goodness faith
[2:28:57] meekness temperance I
[2:29:07] such there is no law nobody got no
[2:29:09] complaints about people operating like
[2:29:10] this and they that are Christ's have
[2:29:15] crucified the flesh with the affections
[2:29:16] and lusts if we live in the spirit let
[2:29:22] us walk let us also walk in the spirit
[2:29:24] let us not be desirous of vain glory
[2:29:30] provoking one another envying one
[2:29:38] another Church so don't don't let that
[2:29:42] be a testimony when when Christ say we
[2:29:46] got to be born again these the things
[2:29:48] that he's expected to come forth from
[2:29:50] our lives and you can't produce that
[2:29:52] without the Spirit of God on the inside
[2:29:54] of you if you know that Lord ain't ain't
[2:29:58] where I need to be that's where you need
[2:30:00] to start praying God get me where I'm
[2:30:02] supposed to be because this word ain't
[2:30:04] changing for nobody everybody from the
[2:30:07] pulpit to the back dogemoney absolutely
[2:30:11] if you want to inherit you want to get
[2:30:13] to heaven you must be born again
[2:30:21] that's just our heads and musicians you
[2:30:24] all make your way I want to have word of
[2:30:25] Prayer
[2:30:35] born-again is going beyond just a
[2:30:37] confession that you're making Church and
[2:30:41] we've done that time and time again but
[2:30:49] now it's time to get down to business
[2:30:51] with God if you just know your life is
[2:30:53] just not where it needs to be and like
[2:30:54] Lord I know you're speaking directly to
[2:30:55] me then I pray the day will be a day
[2:30:58] where you begin to make a difference
[2:31:01] Bible tells you to lay aside every sin
[2:31:03] and every weight that so he's the
[2:31:05] deception that means there's things that
[2:31:08] you're gonna have to give up God and
[2:31:10] gonna take it from you have to give it
[2:31:11] up
[2:31:13] every system here that gave up a pants
[2:31:16] she did them alone every system here
[2:31:18] that gave up her makeup she did that on
[2:31:20] her own gave up her earring she did that
[2:31:22] on her own
[2:31:23] he gave up her toenail polish and
[2:31:26] picking up all she did that on her own
[2:31:27] every sister that's done that that's
[2:31:30] done own every brother that decided I'm
[2:31:33] coming out of these a clothing that's
[2:31:36] not right dressing in appropriate ways
[2:31:39] even shorts I'm coming out of then I'm
[2:31:42] gonna put on my long pants I'm gonna
[2:31:44] look holy walking around in muscle
[2:31:47] shirts I'm not gonna do that tight jeans
[2:31:49] and things no I'm not doing that to
[2:31:50] bring attention to my body but I want to
[2:31:53] bring glory and honor to my god every
[2:31:57] person that did that has done that on
[2:31:58] their own everybody here has to make
[2:32:02] their own personal decision as to how
[2:32:04] they're going to serve God but I tell
[2:32:06] you what I can show you in Scripture
[2:32:08] what it requires them here
[2:32:10] if your heart is right with God to just
[2:32:12] submit yourself to his word the
[2:32:17] commandments of God are not creamy
[2:32:19] they're not creamy is not hard they're
[2:32:21] not difficult and we don't do it because
[2:32:24] God told us we had to do it we do it
[2:32:26] because we love Him pray that you just
[2:32:31] got a pricked your heart today I pray
[2:32:34] that you just get down to business with
[2:32:35] him
[2:32:36] don't don't play games with God you
[2:32:39] don't serve Him go all the way with them
[2:32:41] but don't go halfway because he didn't
[2:32:44] go half way to the cross he went all the
[2:32:45] way but I pray that as the word of God
[2:32:52] has been preached to our hearts here
[2:32:53] today that we Lord Jesus would come to a
[2:32:59] place of complete surrender god life is
[2:33:03] too short things happen so fast and we
[2:33:07] don't have time to to play games with it
[2:33:10] we got to be real the Bible says what
[2:33:12] the Bible says we can't change it it was
[2:33:15] here before any of us were here you
[2:33:18] wrote these things told us that we want
[2:33:22] to inherit the kingdom of God if you're
[2:33:23] operating in certain areas we cannot
[2:33:26] inherit the kingdom of God is it's plain
[2:33:28] and simple the only way our lives can be
[2:33:31] changes that if we are truly born again
[2:33:34] the nature on the inside has to change
[2:33:39] God we're praying that you would do
[2:33:41] exactly what you said you said to give
[2:33:42] us a new heart according to the Book of
[2:33:44] Ezekiel
[2:33:44] instead I'll give you a new heart I give
[2:33:46] you the spirit and then I'll put my
[2:33:48] spirit in the mystery that so God let
[2:33:50] that process take place there's not a
[2:33:54] person in here that raise their hands
[2:33:55] and say that they want it to go to hell
[2:33:59] not one nobody is looking forward to
[2:34:01] that God we come here because we want to
[2:34:03] be right
[2:34:04] so thank you for a word that you would
[2:34:06] give us today that would speak truth
[2:34:08] into our lives the first doctor that
[2:34:13] Jesus spoke you must be born again every
[2:34:17] area of my life where we're back five
[2:34:19] men we're going back to things God that
[2:34:21] we that you delivered us from we're
[2:34:23] going back into it God deal with this
[2:34:25] and don't let us don't let us Father be
[2:34:29] at rest until we begin to bring those
[2:34:30] things back under control of the Holy
[2:34:33] Ghost
[2:34:34] [Music]
[2:34:36] please Lord we don't want to come this
[2:34:39] far and listen it's not about us just
[2:34:42] coming to church and giving our money as
[2:34:43] important with our presence it's about
[2:34:46] getting right with God and that's what
[2:34:51] we want we want to be right
[2:34:55] so I pray God that there's one that has
[2:34:59] heard the word did they made the word do
[2:35:01] only with the word to do so as many as
[2:35:05] believe them me of them I gave power to
[2:35:08] become sons daughters of God so I pray
[2:35:14] that people would believe on you the
[2:35:15] word to a smoke may they accept it or
[2:35:18] may they walk in it I ask it
[2:35:25] from the mighty name of the Lord Jesus
