bear with me one second amen I did want to thank the Lord for brother Mark on Wednesday night um did a wonderful job on the sermon get up and uh just just appreciate how the Lord used him and um uh in that uh I got a um a call yesterday from Sister Irma and I believe she is online uh watching us today she told me that her son Raphael and we've been praying for him for uh some time and um he he has been added to the list to be able to receive a kidney transplant praise the Lord and um also uh he needs a new pancre as well so let's continue to keep him in prayer we thank God for him being on the list uh we know how you know sometimes that's very difficult uh and so many other people are in line but he's on the list and just believe in God that he'll get this but we also know a God that can touch him before the doctor's hand touches him and give him two new kidneys and a new pancreas so let's continue to keep brother Raphael in prayer uh and um um don't forget that the skit that sister shonda's doing for you know for Easter I think that's going to be wonderful so everybody just try to um uh honor just uh meeting with her right after service and actually before they do that meeting I just want to have a brief meeting with the church right after uh right after service I'll just um just need to mention something to you and um and then we will move on from there so the Lord bless you amen the Lord bless you let's read amen from Joel our scripture uh for this season we are um preaching part four to get back in Step as I mentioned on last week we had a few more things that we wanted to share and uh we'll see as far as we go today uh but we trust the Lord Joel 1 and verse 4 says that which the Palmer worm had left hath the Locust eaten and that which the Locust had left ha the korm eaten and that which the K the korm had left ha the caterpillar eaten uh but then we go over to chapter 2 and we just pick up this one verse here actually a couple verses I will say uh starting at verse 23 it says be glad then ye children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God we have given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the for marine and the ladine in the first month and the floors shall be full of Wheat and the fats uh shall overflow with wine and oil and I'll restore to you the years that the Locust ha eaten the canor and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you um and ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and I just love the way brother Troy barked that out to us eat in plenty and be satisfied and and now you got to do something if you eating and plenty and you're satisfied then there's something else you got to do and hello somebody amen praise the name of the Lord amen he been too good for you not to praise him been too good and praise the name of the Lord your God that have dealt wondrous with you and my people should never be ashamed and ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and that I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed amen let's have a word of prayer as we um prepare to go into uh our thought for the day let's pray father we are grateful for the opportunity that we have to come into the house of the Lord and uh we thank you for the anointing that is been here thus far in this service as we would go deeper into uh this thought today God on get back in step and the inspiration that you've given us is I will restore we know in this season Satan going to do everything he can to take away but God you promised to restore so we are looking for your word to be manifested in our health in our Spirits amen and our businesses praise God and uh in our families Lord in every area of our of our life we looking for restoration and uh we ask God that you would just uh take control over this portion of the of the of the service every thought that is presented and every thought that is received may you get the glory and the honor uh out of it it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you you can be seated uh again we are um touching this get back in Step praise the Lord um and um just kind of as we go forward the the thought of this get back and step is actually being driven from um the this quote here uh number three um this quote is just kind of where we're getting our our um inspiration from so the prophet tells us and uh let me also just mention I I just kind of felt in my heart to bring this fourth part out of this sermon and put it in PowerPoint uh because there's some things that I think from a visual perspective if you saw it visually then it may begin to click and sink in a little bit uh for you and we um uh we we beaten this until we get every uh uh nugget out of it because this is so important it's not just um um uh something that we're playing games with we we're living this right now this scripture where theologians are saying they don't really know what it mean we're the manifestation of it all right so it's very important that we we understand this and brother Quinton told us restoration all throughout the Bible all throughout the Bible from when Adam and Eve fell in the Garden of Eden like thank God how brother Jerry picked that up you know and brought that to us and just real quickly God had three things in his mind brother brandom told us three things God has been trying to accomplish all these thousand years that the Earth has been in existence three things one uh God wanted to reveal himself to his people he wanted us to know who he was right two God wanted to have the preeminence in his body God wants to lead you God wants to guide you God wants to direct you God wants to sit on the control tower of your heart amen and express himself through you God wants to do that but you got to yield yourself to God to allow him to do that the devil don't want God to use you and that's why he try to block you up and clog you up with all kind of nonsense amen but God wants to use you not God wants to use you God want to use your eyes God want to use your mouth God want to use your hands God want to use your thinking God want to use your feet come on somebody God God I mean God wants you to lay hands on the sick and have them recover uh God wants you to speak the right word at the right time to the right person to bring Deliverance into their life God wants to use you I don't believe that that God died when brother brandom left the scene the same God that would tell the prophet go and go to this street at such and such a time and when he get there then somebody else on say the Lord told me to come to this street at such and such a time and they happen to just be walking by and then realize the prophet was there they couldn't get through the prayer line but hear a prophet to pray for them on the street yes sir that same God lives today and he wants to lead you and guide you and direct you sir put you in situations where he can get glory for himself God wants to use you three is that he wanted to take back or restore us back to edting conditions again so here let's follow this um and this sermon proving his word brother random say he proves his word in every age by the most unusual way but he always does it in the same way catch these things now he he proves this word in every age by the most unusual way but he always does it in the same way way now when he say it doesn't the same way that means he always sends a prophet to the people right says what did he do in the days of Noah he sent a prophet right uh when he's fixing to deliver the remnant he sent them Noah the prophet Glory he sent Noah a sign and now notice when he come to deliver the children of Israel what does he do he his same way he sends a prophet Moses was the prophet that went to the children of Israel his prophet got His prophets got the word amen the signs and wonders of the word promise backs it up now let me let me let me let me um I'm going come to that in a second that's is that's that's uh that's it's exactly the truth Israel made a p March to the promised land because they believed it but stay right there the signs and wonders of the word promise backs it up right uh and I I I just mentioned this recently I was um uh talking about the uh Church age book there are some people that have pulled away from the message because it said brother brandom's Church age book looks just like um uh Charles lens's book and uh Charles Lin is a man that wrote a number of things of what he saw in the church ages and and and uh you know and he outlined it a certain way but his Revelation was not the same as brother Brandon I can tell you that right now even if he got part of it right ain't nothing wrong with having you know that uh we we brother brandom said many he says I just came to tith of the Lucin they had truth they wasn't false they had the truth but they was missing just certain components so one thing I know Charles Lin did not have who was the seven Church age messenger he didn't have that one right so so so so uh so when we look at things like that we don't we and and here's the other thing I I I asked the question did when Charles Lin wrote his book that might and I I've never read the book but others say they read it look just like the church A's book evidently you ain't read the whole church A's book if you can say that right but but here here the other thing I want to say is that at the end of Charles Lin writing his book whatever the name of the book is I don't even know the name but whatever the name of the book is did the angel of the Lord come into the church go to the back wall and draw on the wall what was being taught in the front of the church see the signs and wonders of the word promise backs it up yes sir when we see it super natural God moving like that we know we're standing on a solid foundation yes sir amen it's not no this not no joke this not no this not we're not we're not playing games this is this is the real thing God has giving it to us and we got to know what has been what's been restored back to us let's go on forward in this the the rest of this quote it says and in the wilderness Journey it came to pass now where did they disbelieve not when the signs and wonders were going forth you know ain't nobody had no problem man look at the people were flooding the meetings yes sir but in the wilderness Journey the prophet is now off the scene hello somebody in the wilderness Journey come on Church it says it came to pass that they disbelieve this Prophet Lord amen after seeing the word being so confirmed the bright got out of Step you know what I'm speaking about in the vision see got out of Step but look at this he says there was one stayed up by the name of Joshua and Caleb amen and believe the Word of Promise true regardless of what the circumstances was and I I I want to just I want us to make sure that uh we understand this is us sir we we're that group that's that that stand true to the word we believe the word regardless of the circumstances brother you just can't bring up a website and talk about a bridge and think that's going to get me not to look at the message you need to understand something if you want to try to get me to disbelieve this message you going to have to disprove it by the word not by a bridge not by bear you ain't going to get me like that you going to have to disprove this by the word and I'm going have some questions for you that's right I'mma take you to Matthew 177 you better have an answer if you tell me that John the Baptist was the one that restored then I'm might have a question all right what did he restore let's go on all right so here uh since he say we we we we G to be like uh he said Joshua and Caleb was the one that was still standing there with the word regardless of the circumstance here in the in the church a book The Angel of the Lord had told the prophet to pick up his pen and write and and that's why you see it kind of italicized there because this is the Angel speaking directly to you Hallelujah now the angel says let us stand like Joshua and Caleb our promised land is coming in sight even as theirs did now Joshua means Jehovah Savior and he represents the end time leader that will come to the church even as Paul came as the original leader now you know on a bookshelf we have book ends and the bookends are there to keep the books in place that's right any of y'all got bookends anybody anybody got bookends in their house so I I got it I got I got all see when we was coming up y'all young people y'all y'all missed a lot the church that we grew up in and maybe I'm the maybe I'm at fault here but but the church we grew up in sister Westco with with with with order order books for the whole church and then write your name on the top of the book and say this is yours so if anybody you called anybody with your book with your name on you done stole my book but we would have that book and we would go home all the time and our shelves are full of books of the of the prophet and I got bookends on it yes we used to read them books all the time that's how we got that's how we got solid in this message we we didn't have we couldn't I'm just be we couldn't afford the tapes but a $2 book we get okay we got that we couldn't afford T but not I mean it's free you can download everything for free we used to we used to study them books like crazy yes sir amen make sure we read our books amen and and see it helped us in our in our in our in getting established in this message Hallelujah we didn't we didn't understand everything we was reading but yet we was reading yes sir amen hallelujah but but but but we have bookings amen now I got all them books in my house and I barely use them cuz I got everything in the app now but I ain't throwing my books away I ain't throwing them away I'mma keep them there unless I find somebody really needed somebody in third world country that can't get an app can't get the internet or something you can I give you my books but I'm keeping my books glory to God but we I got them on bookends and and and when you got bookends you got one on this end and one on that end one at the beginning one at the end Paul was a book in messenger that's right yes sir he was on the front end but in order to keep this thing together we need a book in on the back end and the book in message on the back end was William Mary and brandham and his message was to restore everything that Paul taught he had to come back and preach everything Paul taught so when he went across to the other side and the angel allowed him to come in and see all these people he say he say these are your people that say they are Broms no not brandom they your converts right he says I want to see Jesus and you can't see him right now he said you going you have to wait he going to come to you because you was a leader on the earth in your day you was a leader says he going to come to you and going to judge you by Everything You Preach that's right it says Paul here yeah Will Paul be judged by everything he preach yeah he said well I preach this message is not a new message this message is a restoration message preaching the same thing Paul preach he says I preach the same thing that Paul preached Millions Hallelujah Millions screamed out when they heard brother Brandon say that in heaven Millions screamed out sir we are resting on that yes sir sir and I'm here to tell you I was right there I was one of the millions that said I'm resting on that and I'm here to tell you one of the millions too you why because in every age God predestines his word for that age and he predestines the people to believe the word for that age yes so I'm not here by mistake I came here from God I had to believe this message yes sir amen let me finish reading this quote let's stand like Joshua and Caleb our promised land is coming in sight even as theirs did now Joshua means Jehovah's Savior and he represents the end time leader that would come to the church even as Paul came as the original leader Caleb represents those that stayed true with Joshua can I uh drop this off we're gonna stay true to Joshua not Joshua's children sir all right let me go on cuz this what the angel said yes sir the angel said we got to stay true to Joshua yes sir that Joshua's children might lead us into other things but we stand true to Joshua Hallelujah all right remember God had started Israel as a virgin with his word but they wanted something different that mean they were getting out of step right so did the last day Church notice how God did not move Israel or let her go into the promised land until it was his own appointed time amen now the people might have put pressure on Joshua the leader and said the land is ours let's go and take it Joshua you are all through you must have lost your commission you don't have the power you used to have now you know I know people that have left the message because they Fel they felt that it didn't have the power no Supernatural happening like it used to be and they get CAU they don't realize there's a spirit coming in causing them to think that way Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he ain't lost his power sir amen look he says um you don't have the power youed to have you used to uh uh the land let's go and take it Joshua all through you must have lost your commission you don't have the power you used to have you used to hear from God and know that know the will of God and act quickly something is wrong with you oh my they point the problem is on Joshua now people pointing the problem to brother brandom and don't even know him a't never met him one day in their life right but but something's wrong with you but Joshua was a god-sent prophet and he knew the promises of God so he waited for them them he waited for a clear-cut decision from God and when the time came to move God placed a full leadership in Joshua's hand because he had stay with the word God God could trust Joshua but not the others so it will repeat in this day the same problem the same pressures so we see that spirit and now the angel told the prophet to pick up his pen and write and the angel spoke these things brother brandham just recorded it on paper yes sir so the angel told us that these Spirits would come and what we need is a message that will cause us to get back in Step all right let's go on scripture we read that which the Palmer worm hath left hath the Locust eaten that which the Locust hath the cankerworm eaten that which the canker worm left hath the caterpillar eaten now I mentioned to you all I've been talking to you about this commentary amen that I pull from called illuminous software and uh um um this was their definition this is what something I've been driving at you all the theme of the first chapter they're trying to explain joel4 and it says the theme of the first chapter of the prophecy the destruction caused by the Locust plague is introduced in in this verse palmerworm Locust cankerworm caterpillar and they said the meaning of the four Hebrew words translated here is uncertain they say they probably refer to four stages in the development of the the Locust rather than to four distinct types of locust now part of what they're saying is right because this is the same in insect in four different stages it is but when they say the meaning of these four Hebrew words translated is uncertain that because they looking at it from an intellectual point of view but as we're going a prophetic view gives us so much more insight on this one scripture the average church when they look at Joy going for they wouldn't have much to say about it what is being restored right but here brother brandom gives us a few things and and and the other other uh uh book that I that I I gave you was I just um in the next slide this um uh the definition I gave you from this book I got key to the Bible and this word restore means to deliver back again and they they use the scripture Genesis 27 that's that's uh ailec having to give Sarah back to Abraham we went through that on last week so that's what delivered back again the next one it says to make a return as a thief and I went back and and verified that and and uh Exodus 22 if you got caught stealing my God if you got caught you had to you had to give it back double I'm going tell you we done caught the devil stealing we done caught the devil stealing so I'm not just expecting just what I got back I I'm getting back that plus I caught you steing Satan you tried to take my peace you tried to take my joy I caught you stealing Satan I want it back double Hall and you know what there was a law God put a law there to make them give it back double amen that's right if they took one one one Ox they had to come back with two praise the Lord church that's how you settled it when you doubled it yes sir amen make that devil double it up all right all right all right so to make return as for a theft the next one says to reestablish as an office they used the butler uh found in Genesis 4013 this is the scripture that they were using amen the other thing is to reclaim an heiring Christian which we uh brought that out last week to restore such a one in the spirit of meekness but you had to be spiritual if you found somebody overtaken in the fault you had to be spiritual Amen to restore such a one in the spirit we meekness Now understand this when we find somebody overtaken a fault we don't want to drive them down we want to lift them up am amen right your your your your your your objective is to lift them up considering yourself lest you also be tempted all right now the other thing that they brought here was to recover the purity of divine worship by Reformation that's their uh definition but I put restoration and the reason that I could put I can add to their definition because of the scripture that they're re they're using yes sir they use to recover the pure to Divine worship by reformation and they use Matthew 17:10 through1 3 we went through this on last week but I'm just recapping some things so this next slide is what we what we what we we talked about in Matthew uh 17 10-13 says and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scrib that Elias must first come and Jesus answered and said unto them Elias truly shall first come and restore all things but I say unto you that Elias is come already see now and and then he not playing games with the words all this is is actually two different comings of Elias or Elijah two different coming and We Know by re the spirit of Elijah was used four five times it was in Elijah it was an Elisha who got a double portion of Eliah Spirit it was in John the Baptist the third time the fourth time it was in the ministry of William Mari and branom and then the fifth time is as one of the two witnesses coming back to deal with the Jews according to the Book of Revelation Revelations amen five times the spirit of elij just used according to the scripture right all right all right all right so Jesus said Elias truly shall first come and restore all things but I say unto you that Elias is come already and they knew him not but have done unto unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them now here is where they finally it finally struck them this is after Mount Transfiguration the disciples that the Bible says then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist now there when it said he spake to them of John the Baptist they understood that this Elias that came already was John the Baptist but they did not know who this Elias truly shall first come and restore all things was remember my question last week if somebody say that John the Baptist was the Fulfillment of both of these scriptures you have one question according to this Elias's got to come and restore all things so the question is what did he restore right well I said it was brother brandham that restored all things so what did he restore all right He restored serpent seed water baptism godhead no eternal hell the truth of marriage and divorce Grace straighten out even predestination in election there some churches that will not even preach predestination because they think that God got favorites no it's not a thing of favorites God can predestinate by for knowledge because he knows what choices you are going to make when the word is presented to you God already know what choice you're going to make so he predestines based on his for knowledge yes sir brother Brandon brought that adoption and placing yes sir right brother Brandon brought that to us who is this MDC yes sir right um and and and and and one of the real really important on was the revelation of the Seven Seals and the Seven Thunders praise the Lord amen these Revelations nobody else brought that it was sealed until this time but once once the prophet came and see it was released to us and there was a supernatural element that happened even to bring the revelation of the Seven Seals to us seven angels from Glory caught the prophet up in a cloud sent them back to the east to preach these things to us that's right he wasn't just preaching and every every day glory to God that he preached a seal the angel came into the room to tell him what to preach yes sir amen that's right brother I'm going be honest I've been preaching for 20 something years I ain't never had a physical Angel come into my room and tell me exactly what to preach any of the preachers had that experience yet I mean this is exactly what you what you not and when he preach the Seven Seals every night for a whole week Angel he went looking at his old notes I'mma preach it this way Angel start here go here go here go the angel walking him through the Bible and then you don't want to you don't want to hold on to this and then even even in that now I'll be honest as as a man he still got some things confused and I think God did that intentionally just to throw off to make believer yes sir but see once we got the trail we can follow it ourselves God my God but all these things was restored John the Baptist never touched any of that no sir but we I mean and that's just I I probably I ran out of room I couldn't even add more things that he talked about the Holy Ghost the real the real baptism of the Holy Ghost what it would produce in your life yes sir amen because they told us you had to speak in tongues the prophet straightened us out on that one that's right Hallelujah all right let me keep moving y'all I'm going on I'm going we talk about things that was restored sir see see they they talk about you know it's it's unknown but we can look at these things have already been restored we're fellowshipping around this right now all right let me go on so here in this message presuming the prophet say then Alone Come the church begin to grow then here come these four termites in one the same insect just different stages it says Along come the pal worm what did what did it do first thing it took the fruit Brotherly Love off of it next in come around was the cankerworm it come another worm around and eat off the joy the leaves the fellowship the next come along what did he do he eat off the bark now I stuck covering in there cuz that that that's important he he eat off the bark the C wor what next come the caterpillar and suck the life right out of it the caterpillar sucked the life right out of it look at that but there was a stump cuz Joel said I'll restore that predestinated root brother brother uh brother Jerry brought that one out I I restore that predestined group Hallelujah and all them names that was before the foundation were predestinated all that the father has given me will come to me yes sir all that he forew he called all that he calls he justifies and those that he justified he has glorified let me just Camp there for just a second do you realize in the in the season of restoration when you know you've been truly restored and then when it's really revealed to you that you've been restored Satan can't hold nothing over you am trth amen CU all he called he justified and all he justified he glorified who can lay a charge to God's elect oh my feel like reading the scripture but who can lay a charge to God's elect I'm I'mma have to read it cuz I'm I'm I the the devil won't won't let me uh W it won't bring it all back to my memory that's okay I I got I got a place I can go get it and I ain't got to memorize it amen one of my most favorite verses Romans 8 and sis don't worry about you don't have to change it if you they can pull their Bibles on this they need to read their Bibles amen amen Romans 8 glory to God glory to God I I'm I'm going just start reading at verse 22 Romans 8 I'mma read this and I'm going on um it says this for we know that the whole creation granth and travelleth in pain together until now amen and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the Redemption of our body for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope for what man seeth why doth he yet hope for uh it says but if we hope for that we see not then do we with patience wait for it glory to God likewise Hallelujah the Spirit uh also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth that knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God God and this is the one that's really good and we know yes that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for no praise God he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called amen and whom he called them he also Justified Hallelujah that's why I said the devil can't hold nothing against you when you realize you a part of this restoration amen then amen more whom he did predestinate then he also called and whom he called them he also justify and whom he justify them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things my my my my if God before us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall we how shall he not with him uh also freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God not the devil it is God that justifieth who is he that condemneth my God can't even bring me into the courtroom I've been washed in the blood of Jesus amen my attorney is also my judge amen amen he says uh who shall lay anything to the charge of God it is God that justify who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died ye rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation come on or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep of the slaughter [Music] nay in all these things all what things persecution famine distress nakedness Peril sword tribulation all these things Paul said me in all these things we are more than conquerors through him them that loved us Paul got excited for I am persuaded amen I'm not discouraged I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels my God nor principalities nor powers nor things present whatever I'm going through it can't discourage me no things present my nor things to come hallelujah hallelujah amen nor height nor depth nor any other creature you can't take my praise nor any other creature shall be able to separate us and I like the way Paul put that he didn't make it personally he could have said separate me but separate us you going to overcome this thing brother you going to overcome this thing sister nothing going to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord when you know you've been restored ain't nothing the devil can do to stop you from getting all that God has for you let's keep going on here God already glorified Justified us and glorified so now there's four stages of the same insect brother brandom tells us first the Palmer worm comes the next he um destroyed the fruit of the spirit right he DW this destroy the fruit and uh and brother Ram says it's the fruit of the spirit that he actually came came after fruit of the spirit we find that in Galatians 5 ver 22-2 you can find that but he destroyed the fruit of the spirit next thing he uh he also destroyed Brotherly Love in the church amen and the way he destroyed it is through gossip that's how that that's why brother brand said we need a spiritual Electrical Fence to stop all the gossip it's got to come to a halt cuz this is the devil take the brotherly love right out the church you know I'm going tell you something this is when people start feeling led to leave and go to another church amen and something something done happened here some some little talk somebody spread something they shouldn't have said well they going to think this way about me they going to think that no no no no we don't want that around here amen don't talk about nobody pray for pray for one another sir he also say eat your faith in the word right and he eats the joy of your salvation that's what the Palmer worm does the next one is the Locust and he ate the leaves of divine Fellowship that's what the Locust comes to do eats the the leaves of divine Fellowship my hallelujah it's so important church that we stay in Fellowship one with the other we we we try to put on events here at the church we want the young people to be able to have somewhere that can come and just kind of just just enjoy one another's presence I rather for the young people to be together fellowshipping than not there with the world and cousins that'll lead them to stuff that they shouldn't be led to right put them in the in the in in the presence of the the other youth it's going to be important to their development praise the Lord they get out there next thing you know they want to marry somebody out there and now we got a real problem cuz a a a Believer can't be yoked up with an unbeliever Hallelujah and see what happened then you know we get a Believer go get yolked up with unbeliever then and like like my uncle say they get a lemon yeah they get a lemon it's a sour sour marriage you know what I'm saying and when they get a lemon you know what they want to do they want to bring the lemon to church and try to get the pastor to make some lemon I was trying to make lemonade in you before you went out there and got that lemon but keep them surrounded by Saints amen and it's going to be a sacrifice take your kids to meetings yes sir amen praise the Lord take them somewhere where the presence of God is moving where they can get closer to God take them make a sacrifice go in your pocket get some money out and get take them to a meeting this cankerworm he comes amen he attacks the bark of the tree destroys the covering or the religion he also attacks the doctrines like baptism and also substitutes a genuine Holy Ghost experience with a handshake he attacks these things another thing the the caterpillar comes and he sucks the very life out through denominating this is how the life is taken out of the church is through denom name so these are the four stages of the same insect now let's go further let's go further in the message the restoration of the Bride tree brother brandom tells us he says listen real close now look there was four death Messengers kill that tree is that right what was it Palmer worm Locust cankerworm caterpillar is that right four messengers of Roman Devils dogmas kill that tree one took its fruit one took its bark or its leaves one took its bark one took the life is that right four messengers of dogmas kill that tree all but the roots and if four messengers of Death kill the tree four messengers of Life restores the tree hallelu come on a little further here four messengers of Death kill the tree four messengers of life will restore the tree hit next again brother brother random goes on to say this it says did you do you get it amen for God said I will restore it now remember I told you the the theologians and that that Illumina uh software that I'm using is written by the Catholic church now these are people that's supposed to really study this Bible but they say we don't really know what this means it's uncertain but here a prophet picks this up and says four death Messengers killed it but four life Messengers will restore it sir Hallelujah glory to God Amen he says uh he says I'll restore it he is going to restore it how by four death Messengers killed it then four life Messengers will restore it yes sir what was the first how does a prophet pick this up and give it to us the the the Catholics have no idea but a prophet is a man with a seventh grade education tells us what this is all about yes sir when he picks up Joel 14 and Joel 2 he picks it up and he tells us exact ex L what it means it says what was the first Martin Luther justification what was the second John Wesley by sanctification what was the third Pentecost with the restoration of the gifts now listen this is why I said last week we done have people preach the gifts out of the church but the gifts were part of the restoration amen the gifts were part of the restorant it was part of the process just like justification sanctification the gifts had to come back yes right they had to that's why that's why a Susan Street took place that was a that was a the Fulfillment of this scripture happening in this in a souu street a part of the Fulfillment of the scripture look he says uh he says what was the first Martin Luther justification what was the second John westation what was the third Pentecost with the restoration of the gifts the Holy Ghost baptism of the Holy Ghost what was the fourth the word what the word word oh my my my my my we going further we're going further there were four great prophets one of them Martin Luther he began to shine a light there was a little light just a very small strength of justification Along come Wesley stronger signification after Wesley comeing stronger than him Pentecost of the baptism of the Holy Ghost another great prophet see but in the last days of Malachi 4 Elijah is to come with the very word this is what Jesus said that Elijah El would come and restore all things He restored the word and there was a supernatural element that came to prove and vindicate that what he was saying was the truth Elijah to come with the very word hallelujah the word of the Lord came to the prophet in the evening light is to come forth to restore and bring back what turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the father's fourth light the fourth light and not don't have time to deal with that fourth light y'all know I want to Fourth light let me just drop this off it was uh the fourth light actually brings the restoration see he said justification sanctification then he said the baptism of the Holy Ghost but then the fourth light was the word coming back that that that's that that's that's the that's the full restoration and the fourth light amen is what brings the complete restoration here's another thing I want to tell you is that it was only on the fourth day that we actually got sunlight the first day when he said let there be light that was s o n light but it was on the fourth day that we got s n light and we got Moonlight two great lights to rule the day and to rule the night that happened on the fourth day right my God my God can I tell you another thing about this fourth light it was it was in the fourth generation brother brandom said in Israel's history Reviving one generation they saw the Revival start in the first generation Hallelujah and then in the Next Generation the fires begin to fade in the third generation generation says the Embers may be glowing slightly but then it says when we get to the fourth generation Hallelujah fourth light when we get to the fourth generation it says there's no vestage of the original flame that's why you saw people rise up in this generation and begin to go against the message they did not do it 30 years ago or or or 50 years ago they was too close to it then but when it got to the fourth generation that's when this I mean this this group rose up with their intellect and said that the message was wrong all because of a bridge and all because of a a bear a bear a bear took him from the word a bear that's all the devil had to show show you that he didn't get his bear well he's disobedient and he said he was disobedient that's why he get his bear but they ain't got nothing to do with the word but when we see that we enter the fourth generation there's no vestage of the original flame also the fourth there's something happens in the fourth generation that didn't happen in the other Generations it's in that generation where God promised to light the fire again amen fourth light and it just so happened this is part four of get back and step fourth light so brother random tells us that this next slide it says uh four death Messengers took it but four like four life Messengers were bring it back so we going to list these four death Messengers and four life Messengers The Four death Messengers was the Palmer worm took the brotherly love and the fruit the the the the uh also the Locust he took the leaves of divine Fellowship the caner worm attacks the doctrine or the religion the caterpillar sucks all the life out but there is life in the root couldn't get that you know even in our Natural Life boy the devil will cause us to leave the church and get involved in some crazy stuff things that we're ashamed of but you know even in the midst of your involvement there was always something in your roots it was always something in your roots I mean I I remember my brother sharing how he got invited you know to they they saw he wasn't going to church like come on over to this church here Baptist Church come on over this church and he say nah I know I'm doing some stuff out here things that I shouldn't be doing I know I shouldn't be doing but one thing I am not going to do I am not going to that church to sit in there act like I'm eaten I ain't going there it was something inside of his roots Hallelujah something that'll hold you that'll anchor you no matter how far the devil take to you it's something in your roots that caus you to come back to this four death messages took it here's four life messages the first first one was Luther the second was Wesley the third was Pentecost and then Malachi 4 four and again I put Matthew 17:11 right because Jesus said that Elias truly shall first come and restore all things so Malachi 4 is connected to Matthew 17711 Malachi 4 is also connected to Revelation 10 and 7 it seem there's no one scripture we following it's the word this this this all over the word but what was restored if for Life Messengers brought it back what did they restore Luther brought us justification the just shall live by faith he got so tired of the Catholic church if you just reading your Bible Revelation 2 talks about the first four Church ages and in the fourth Church age they went to the depths of Satan but then in Revelation three Luther starts coming and then wesle starts coming and this this whole chapter of Revelation 3 is a Reformation turning into a restoration sir amen just in your Bible is broke up like that my God Luther start out but you know he started with justification just your live by faith then what does Wesley uh restore Wesley comes along with sanctification brother brandom call a second work of Grace what does uh Pentecost come restoration of the gifts through the true baptism of the Holy Ghost this why I say we not getting rid of gifts around here no I encourage gifts as long as they are in order with the scripture I encourage that because that is part of the restoration we can't push that to the side we just got to get it lined up correctly amen amen you you take it out of the Bible when you when you when you when you take it out of the church like that it's got to stay in the church if that's what they had at Pentecost we supposed to have the exact same thing that's right amen the only thing we got now is the word to go on top of that and that was the fourth thing that was restored it was the word the word was restored the the revelation of the word you say well we always had a Bible you're right you're right but they didn't know what it meant how many churches you go to today and you tell them turn to Revelation 10:7 they like what oh what you get ready and I come in come on Brother come on come on I mean what is it it's these are people that's been restored they know exactly what where we are I just had a supporting quote that I wanted to go along with that and I'm I'm I'm going somewhere I just I want to just put this on the slide so y'all can see it all brother Brandon says this in the message the Masterpiece do you know the Masterpiece itself was uh a message with brother Brandon preached about restoration and and the Masterpiece he tells us that uh uh Michelangelo had this great sculpture of Moses he never seen a picture of Moses never never um he he just in his mind he just kind of he he said this is what Moses must have look like and he spent years carving out this Moses carving him out carving him out and um you know and and when he when he carved them out uh and he unveiled it where he looked at that he looked at what he had created he was so inspired he took his little instrument that he was chiseling and carving with he took the instrument and struck Moses say speak Moses oh God if Michael Michelangelo would try to get Moses to speak what you think the Holy Ghost is trying to get you to do I'm going tell y'all something your restoration will be released by what you say right your restoration will be released by what you say and I'm going to prove it to you in scripture in just a little bit your restoration did y'all get your pen out did y'all write that down my restoration is released by what I say amen and and during this whole period God say don't say nothing negative God want you to have this church now here in this message the Masterpiece brother Brandon makes a statement says notice here the life that was in the husk and the stalk and in the tassel and the hus all gathers in the seed and the life that was in the stalk went one went went uh went to make the other justification made a way for sanctification sanctification made a way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come write down imperfection back to the word again to manifest itself so what was restored justification sanctification praise God and uh and then the the gifts but it also brings us back to the word when he says uh the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself this is the very person of Christ so we're not when we talk about a a life somebody with a life we we want to see Christ on display we don't want you speaking in tongues and also cursing at the same time or you you in church um you know rising up speaking in tongues and then another Brothers is giving interpretation everybody uh enjoying the presence of the Lord but then you going out living with somebody Ain your wife that's that's filthy dirty living we don't want that going forth in the church if you got to have that one and and and let me tell you another thing if you can't follow the [Music] word I'm talking about really follow the word bible tell you not to do certain things and you still out there doing it don't come in here with a gift sir cuz that's just the devil anointing you we gifts and C are without repentance we want gifts that have repented yes sir amen and have turned from the Wicked Ways that's what we talking aboutall amen so when we got somebody with a life clean like that we want to encourage them let your gift go forth God gave you that gift and this message didn't come to take the gift from you the message came to actually just place you properly exactly all right Church all right but justification made a way for sanctification sanctification made a way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost itself back to the word again all right this next statement from restoration of Bri tree brother random says this four Killers took it four Messengers destroyed it four messages of death took it uh took it away in the dogmas four messages of righteous is restored back again prophesy son of man look at look at what what the prophet say prophesy son of man can these bones live I wish we had time we got it wrote down here but I I have to miss that prophesy can these bones Li see your your your restoration is released by what you say prophesy can these bones live got the four stages of that coming forth of that church here's another fourth light watch this what's the four stages of ezekiel's dry bones coming forth but the life only come not when the senu skin was on them but when the wind blowed upon them that's when it come back that four message of that fourth message of life I will restore sayith the Lord hallelujah Glory praise be to God he said I wish we had time to go look at Ezekiel it just so happened this morning we got time because there's four stages of ezekiel's Drive bones coming forth let's read Ezekiel we're going we're going to read Ezekiel 3 7: 1-10 but I'm going start with verse 1-5 says the hand of the Lord was upon me and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of Bones now here's what I need you to see when ezekiel's looking at this Valley full of Bones this is a hopeless situation I mean they done lost everything Hallelujah I mean sometimes you if you've ever had the experience you know looking at someone that that just passed away and their body is laying there sometimes you as a Believer you you you you you feel like if I pray a prayer maybe God will raise him right back up I mean even Lazarus on this fourth day he came forth fourth light on the fourth day L came forth he I mean they say now he by this time he stinking said no no no no just believe now just and roll away the stones some of y'all going to have to roll away some stones in order to see a restoration you got to roll away some Stones take back some things you done said apologize for it right but but but but but he said look you you just just believe now don't don't don't worry about it now but but somebody in a situation like that it look like it's there's some hope here I can still see their flesh I can still see this I can still see that but when they get down to just bones I can't even identify the body it's just bones it look hopeless help I'm just dealing with bones some of us got situations in I it just feel like bones God I'm I'm surrounded by a valley of Bones my my child is and my this that and my body is just bones God look at them bones and ask a question the hand of the Lord was upon me and carried me out and Spirit of the Lord and set me down in the midst of the valley which is full of Bones and caused me I think this is too too hot uh and caused me to pass by them round about and behold there was very many in the open Valley and lo they were very dry not just dry and it said unto me son of man can these bones live and I I'm speaking to your circumstance I'm speaking to your situation can these bones [Music] live and I answered oh Lord God thou knowest like like like you going to put it off on God no no no no God didn't ask the question if he ain't already know the answer again he said unto me prophesy upon these bones now now I want you to get this I want you to get this he did not tell Ezekiel what he was amen he didn't give him no inspiration to to say something actually he just expected Ezekiel to open his own mouth and speak to the situation some of us waiting on God to give us something before we say something God waiting on you to say something before he do something it is what you say out your mouth that's going to release your restoration whatever restoration mean to you amen because this is personal right tired of the devil taking this and taking that I'm tired of it Satan give it back you got to prophesy out of your own mouth look at it now let's watch the scripture and again he said unto me prophesy upon these bones and say unto them oh ye Dry Bones hear the word of the Lord where was the word of the Lord it was in Ezekiel yes sir thus said the Lord God unto these bones behold I will cause breath to enter into you and ye shall live I'm going on and I will lay sin you upon you remember brother random says four stages of ezekiel's dry bones look at it it's right there in the scripture I will lay sin you upon you I underlined it for you made it easy I'mma lay sin you upon you you dry bones and will bring up flesh upon you I'm GNA give you some flesh we're gonna be able to identify you again and cover you with skin and after that I'mma put breath in you and when I get finished with these four stages ye shall live and ye shall know glory to God that I am the Lord h amen this ain't Joel's prophecy this ain't ezekiel's prophecy this is God using these prophets to bring this to pass so look at look at look at look at look at look at Ezekiel verse 7 so I prophesied and and how did they slip that one right in verse 7 you know what seven means right seven is a number of completion you a part of the completion you have to prophesy so I prophesied as I was commanded that you was commanded not to say nothing negative now you commanded to prophesy amen amen speak to your own family speak to your own body speak to your own finances speak to it praise God speak to it don't cry no more after the day speak and then after you speak move forward Hallelujah so I prophesied as I was commanded and as I prophesied as I was speaking there was a noise and behold a shaking and the bones came together bone to his bone and when I beheld below the senu and the flesh Came Upon them and the skin covered them above but there was no breath in them fourth light then he said un me prophesy unto the wind prophesy son of man and say to the wind thus sayith the Lord God now now now now let me just also drop this when can represent troublesome situations but it's okay because you know when Peter walked on the water he walked during trouble the wind actually didn't stop until he got back in the boat what caused him to sink is because he start looking around at the wind and the waves he was already walking on it sir exactly right a't no sister look at you already done walked out here on that that's why I say Jesus ain't pick no Peter up and say I'mma carry you back no get up and walk again because you walk before Oh I just tell your neighbor just touch them keep on walking tell them keep on walking Hallelujah Glory verse 9 then it said and me prophesy unto the wind prophesy son of man say to the wind thus say the Lord God come from the Four Winds oh breath and breathe upon these slain that they may live so I prophesied as as he commanded me and the breath came into them and they lived and stood up upon their feet an exceeding great Army the four stages of ezekiel's dry bones four of death death Messengers took it from us there's four death Messengers again are the palmerworm took the brotherly love the fruit which a fruit of the spirit the Locust took the leaves of divine Fellowship the cankerworm attacked the bark of the tree which was the doctrine or the religion of the tree and the caterpillar suck the life right out but in the four four stages of ezekiel's dry bones brother B say I wish we could just get to it in the first stage senu which was tendons hit next I believe yeah it's the tendons and these are the natural cords that hold the body together and let me tell you the way we treat one another we can either divide the body body because we connected now or we can we can we can hold a body together by how we handle one another don't let the Brotherly Love leave now the tendons the the the send you the tendons are what hold the body together the next thing was he said I'm G to bring flesh upon you and what what I what I what I what I what I put here and I'll read the scripture about it in a little bit it says um we need a heart of Flesh we is to be tenderhearted towards God and let me tell you if you are tenderhearted towards God you will also be tenderhearted towards your brother and your sister it brings back Divine Fellowship when I bring flesh upon you it brings Divine Fellowship here in the next stage he said I'm going to cover you with skin now this is amazing because skin is a natural covering of our flesh that's underneath and you know on a tree the bark is its covering so see in the stat where the ker worm am man that took the bark attack attacking the doctrine and religion God said in ezekiel's a stage four stage of his dry bones when I cover you with skin I am bringing back to covering yes sir amen the caterpillar suck the life out but the last thing that he told Ezekiel I'mma put breath in you and what is breath I'm going to put life right back in you when I breathe into you the breath of life if you want to see this process started you going have to open up your mouth and speak some things everybody in here know what the devil done stole from him it's time for him to give it [Applause] back I'm just going I'm I'm G read these scriptures here because Ezekiel 37 before you get to chapter 37 you got to read chapter 36 and in chapter 36 it says something for I will take you from among the Heathen and gather you out of all countries and will bring you into your own land then will I sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be clean from all your filthiness from all your Idols will I cleanse you and this is the most important a new heart also will I give you your heart done got all messed up but a new heart will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you now when you get a new spirit don't mean you got the Holy Ghost but but God had to give you a new spirit so that Spirit can get along with the Holy Spirit a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you an heart of Flesh and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and ye shall keep my judgments and do them you can't say you got the Holy Ghost and won't follow the word because the Holy Ghost will make you follow the word it gives you strength to follow the word amen and ye shall dwell see what happens is you got a new spirit not the Holy Spirit Holy Spirit follow word a new spirit will do things like I'mma do what the world do and I'm going do what the word do you it's a crow eat everything anything Buzzard eat anything everything but a but a dove can't eat like that an eagle can't eat like that amen I will put my spirit within you cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them and ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers and ye shall be my people and I will be your God I'm laying senu upon you I'm bringing I'm bringing flesh upon you I'm covering you with skin then I'm going to breathe in you look at this brother brandom says restoration B tree the fourth light is to come that will bring forth the same signs watch justification brought back the pulp sanctification brought back the bark doctrine of Holiness what brought back the leaf Pentecostals what is it Pentecostals leaves clap their hands Joy rejoicing Pentecostal what the fourth was the word itself the word made flesh fruits of the proof of the Resurrection sign that Christ has finally after justification being planted sanctification being planted baptism of the Holy Ghost organizations died out and Christ has again sented himself like the cap of the pyramid amen he is the capping Stone it says the first line justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost then coming of the cap what is it the Holy Ghost Bunch being honed out brother brother brother tro tells us how we have have to have that sandpaper we're being honed out glory to God Amen so that it can fit with the same kind of ministry he had when he went away that when he comes back it'll catch the whole thing in the Rapture where the Justified Sanctified baptism of the Holy Ghost the pyramid will stand again the house of God will live again the tree of life is growing again that ain't something that's going to happen is happening right now here's my last slide this was a prayer brother Brandon prayed in the message proven his word where we gathered our thought from get back in step and I'm praying this same thing says when we think of this Solomon in that great Millennium of the Jews that when no Nations Dar to touch them and the great gift of God was in the prophet till he made known to the queen all of her secrets of her heart now he praying this prayer about Solomon but we know that this happened in brother Brandon's Ministry he he you know secrets of the heart was revealed like crazy right uh and it was spot on every time every time um actually I I'll tell you I only know one time if you want to call it a Miss I I'll give it to you it's only one time he missed it somebody say well if he missed one time then he's he's out we not looking looking at the one million times that he got it there's only one time he missed and maybe I'm I might not even tell you he actually mispronounced somebody's name he told a person that their name was strong because in the vision what he saw was somebody doing something like this he didn't see the name he just saw a representation of the name and he say is your your name strong no stout and they mean the same thing they mean the same thing now and I'mma tell now I just gave that away I I should have made them go look for that in the message to find it that that's the only one you got I'm giving you one but for me that ain't enough to get me did you see a vision of somebody strong and call out day name try it you just try it sometime before you put him down you try to put yourself in his shoes amen just try it all over the world going all over the world and God just used him everywhere he went that was just to get our attention so that we would believe the word that he was preaching EXA right the great gift of God was in the prophet till he made known to the queen all of her Secrets all of her secrets of her heart nothing was withheld the great age showing and typing that there was a great age coming now father that was you not Solomon that was you in Jesus for he said God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself he was the beginning of the creation can I just add to this before I go further into prayer that wasn't brother brandom that was God in brother brandom his body was redeemed creation and now Through the Ages the church lost its first love and now in the last days you promised to call a little minority the little flock at the last days father our hearts are jumping and my heart's pounding when I think of that and know that your words are true none of them can fail let these people today understand that let the sinner seek you at this hour before the gates Clos and there will be no more time he says this let the Bride As she starts getting out of Step from this and that when the bride is getting out of Step from this and that may she come back in the step as the vision showed a few weeks ago notice this I sh when I shared the vision with you all brother Brown seeing the Bri get out of Step he said he was about to scream out get back and step but somehow the bride got back and step on her own and one of the reasons why I believe the bride going to get back and step is because she already been prayed for by a prophet let the Bride As she starts getting out of Step of this and and that may she come back into the step as the vision showed a few weeks ago and if the vision showed that somebody got back in Step the vision is thus saith the Lord I ask for the musicians to come we close amen our service today Father we are grateful for the truth of the word the fellowship we can have around this not just Fellowship just for head knowledge but it raises our expectations our faith to believe you for the impossible some of us are just like Ezekiel we're looking at a hopeless situation it looks dead it's like no no life can come to it but Lord when you ask Ezekiel the question son of man can these bones live he began to put it back on you and say Lord you know but father you wouldn't ask the question if you didn't already have the answer you told Ezekiel yeah but I need you to prophesy to it I need you to speak to it I'm going to bring sin you upon it I'm going to I'm going to uh uh give it flesh skin a covering I'm also going to uh put breath in it but you're going to have to called for these things Ezekiel and as he called for it it stood to his feet like a mighty marching Army God we're looking for these things to be manifested in our day and the prophet said that he in his prayer that Lord let the bride get back in Step as the vision showed she was and that's what our prayer is today God let the bride get back in Step as the vision is showed Lord uh uh it was to do we're expecting it father many have just made mistakes uh uh the enemies come in and Lord just uh confuse some of them but we believe God that you could come and straighten out the confusion you can fix it all there's anybody can fix it you can fix it so father we just commit all these things to you Lord and we open our open our mouth and we tell Satan give it back everything that you have stolen we want it back and we want it back double we want our children want our wives our husbands we we we want we want it back Satan you cannot take it we want our health back we want our finances back lord I even think of Even in our business Lord how the enem is trying to steal a little bit from us God we want it back Satan you got to release it somehow some way we we don't know
