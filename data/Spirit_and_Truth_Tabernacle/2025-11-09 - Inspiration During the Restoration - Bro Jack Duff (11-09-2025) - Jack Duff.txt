So he and all of you are very welcome &gt;&gt; if the Lord consider to visit us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By the one I want to share some details of those two visits of the prophet and messenger Brhan to our Iceland. The first one happened in February 1959 and the second one the following year February 1960. The first visit was extraordinary. More than 40,000 people accepted the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As the savior. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there were hundreds of healings to the point that a truck had to be sent to the park with the campaign was held San Jose Park in San Juan Puerto Rico. erh to collect uh many wheelchairs, stretchers, crutches, orthopedic artifacts that the people that got healed before the pray of the prophet. That was the park, San Jose Park. &gt;&gt; All right. [snorts] &gt;&gt; In our congregation, there is still a sisterhood as a child. Her parents took her to the campaign and she testifies that when the prophet came walking from the hotel in front of the area with the campaign was celebrity hotel Normandy. He said that the palms &gt;&gt; the the palm tree &gt;&gt; the palm tree. Yeah. &gt;&gt; The palm tree &gt;&gt; tilted as as he passes making a reverend act. The palm tilt &gt;&gt; the palm trees bowed down as Babra was coming from the hotel uh normally hotel &gt;&gt; making a reverence act to the prophet. The sister uh has a chronic asthma condition and she uh without making a prayer asking she did not make prayer asking &gt;&gt; she didn't make any prayer request. &gt;&gt; Yes. At a certain moment when the prophet was praying for someone, he turned to s to her and said, "You are healed of your condition." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The sister was healed. He's never suffered from asthma until today. &gt;&gt; To the glory of God. [applause] &gt;&gt; We also knew the testimony of brother Joseio who who translate the prophet in the preliminary of the service. And he told us that a young man who came from here from the United States to ask for a niece who had an a car accident that week and was very badly injured in the hospital. As soon as the prophet saw him, he discerned his heart and said to him, "Your name is Miguel. Michael in English. All right. when when he hear the prophet said his name his name. When he heard the prophet said this name &gt;&gt; without ever knowing him before, &gt;&gt; he almost fainted there. &gt;&gt; And the prophet say, "Your name is Miguel and you are not from here. You come from outside because of a relative of yours who had an an accident this week and is very serious in the hospital." That was his niece. &gt;&gt; And there, brother and sister, the prophet began to describe how the accident happened. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Wow. &gt;&gt; She said such a car of s of a a brand and such a color collide with this other car of such a brand of such color. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; He described the accident. &gt;&gt; Wow. And then this he said, "The same Holy Spirit who has revealed all of this to me reveals to me that your niece is not going to die." &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God has healed her. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. At the end of the service, brother Candelario went to that young man to ask him how he felt after the prophet told him about the accident. And you know what he say? He said, "Hey brother, he told me about the accident better than my family told to me." &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Beloved brothers, the prophet was invited two times to Puerto Rico by the F full fellowship business Christian &gt;&gt; for gospel businessmen. &gt;&gt; Yes. And originally it wasn't him who was supposed to come to Puerto Rico. It was Morice Cerulo to come to Puerto Rico. And the prophet was assigned to be in Haiti. But God gives gave the prophet the vision that at the last minute they were they were going to change the program &gt;&gt; and Cerulo was sent to Haiti and the prophet to Puerto Rico. Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; When the person in charge calls the prophet on the phone to give him the news, before he begins to speak, the prophets tell him, "I am not going to Haiti. I'm going to Puerto Rico." &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Brother Cerulo is going to Haiti. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The person say, "How you do do you know that?" &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; How do you know? &gt;&gt; That's right. When the prophet arrived on the Iceland, there was a lady named Sally Olsen who has a shelter of orphan children or abandoned children whose parent were in jail or did not take care of them. That's that's the the woman Sally Olsen. &gt;&gt; Yes. And he went with all of these children to receive the prophet at the airport. And when he got off the of the plane, those children ran to him and began to hug him, to kiss him, and said to him, "Papa, papa." [laughter] &gt;&gt; The prophet was so moved &gt;&gt; by that welcome that he didn't receive in any other place in the world. I have uh the quotation of the message blind Bartos when he explained that he wants to to to preach he want to express the love for the people of Puerto Rico. &gt;&gt; I want to share with us the the quotation blind Bartos was preached in San Juan Puerto Rico on February 8, 1959. He said, "Sally Olen, I have found a place in my heart for her that I didn't know her so well before, but now I see her burden. Yet she is Scandinavian." But she say, "Brother Bran, these people are my people. They love her." No wonder such a lovely person. He little orphanage. Her her little orphanage. I sent those lovely little Puerto Rican children when I come into the airport the other night. No papa, no mama, and they come to me, put their arms around me, kiss me, then that taking a place. I have children too. &gt;&gt; I know what it mean to be loved and to love others. God bless sister Olen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. All of you dear people, I have preached to greater crowds, but I never preached to nicer people. &gt;&gt; If it is be the will of God and your desire, I would like to return sometime. &gt;&gt; Thank you. I will do that. When I feel that welcome, I feel the Holy Spirit will send me. Thank you. That does something to my heart. Now we will go right straight to the scripture. I just hate to start. I have a little weight on my heart tonight for you. I love you in my heart. That sweet humble spirit. I wish that I will speak your language. &gt;&gt; I like just to express to you when I'm singing, but I pray the Holy Spirit will spread in it for me. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I mean that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother and sister, as well as the prophet was welcome and well received in Puerto Rico, we will receive all of you &gt;&gt; who can visit us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I will take you to the mountain El Jun. &gt;&gt; Amen. That aim that my daughter sent was composed by brother Quu and arranged by by a brother in Ghana, brother Emanuel Cran and based on a mountain called Eljun in English. The translation is the anvil. &gt;&gt; Anvil anvil like an anvil. &gt;&gt; Yes. And there were a place that that the prophet was was visit and he said it was the closest thing to the holy city the new Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if God will and you visit us, we will take to this place. &gt;&gt; It's a great blessing to be here. &gt;&gt; We are identified with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen.

Um I was I had the opportunity just to fellowship with him and his family there on Thursday night and we got a chance to connect. his um wife is the granddaughter of uh brother Kendallio and um you know I I was just sharing with him um just a number of things but I asked him um with brother Candelario how did he get connected uh to the message and it was through brother Coleman's ministry and um he was actually running some meetings in New York he was a evangel evangelist and had some really really powerful meetings of people getting saved and delivered and um and he had preached a sermon or so uh there in New York on um it was talking about the I believe it was the four horse riders. He was talking about the four horse riders and and he was preaching people responding to the word but uh one of the brothers that was there he says you know I'm glad to see all the people responding to the word and you know this is great he says but what you preach was incorrect and uh he says I believe it the way that brother Brandham believed it preached it and he say okay well what did brother Brandham say he says well you know I have to get you connected with a minister here that can kind of go a little deeper with you and that he got them connected with brother Coleman and uh and and back though back in those days uh like we we have the message on our iPad and on our telephone and and before this we had tapes uh cassette tapes but before the cassette tapes they had what they call real tore. So, Brother Coleman had got some realtore real uh tapes of the seven seals and he had just got them. And the man told brother Candle, he says, "Look, um I know he ain't going to let you hold his real tapes." Uh he said he just got them. I I know you want to hear these things, but he ain't going to let you hold them. Well, they went they explained to Brother Coleman what was going on and you know about the meeting and all of that and his desire to want to know the truth. And um and Brother Coleman said, "I'll let you borrow it." and he say the man got a hold of them reals and would not go to sleep that night till he heard all of them &gt;&gt; and uh and it just began to transform things. So, brother Candelario um eventually became the gentleman uh that God used to spread the message throughout Puerto Rico and then also uh into Latin America, right? Uh but all of that started from his connection uh with with brother Coleman, you know. So we had some really good fellowship, you know, I was able to just kind of uh uh share with him and and what what I was telling um you know, uh brother Jose is that um you know, you it's sometimes it's it's so hard to find people that are balanced and that's that's what you look for in this message because we done ran into a lot of things and now we're looking for balance. Amen. So, it's so good to have him with us in fellowship. And praise the Lord. [applause] On on his phone, he has pictures of uh of sister Ma after brother Prum passed. She went to Puerto Rico uh because brother Brandham talks so much about Elun personally to her. This mountain that look he says this is what uh the the new Jerusalem will look like. Elun, right? So, uh, Sister Ma went there to go take a look at that mountain and brother Billy Paul went to go look at that mountain and and many of them because brother Brandon had talked so much about it. So, you know, it's pretty close to us, only a couple hours flight, so we might have to go visit Elun. Amen. Amen. God bless you, brother Jose. We appreciate you. [applause] Amen. Amen. All right. Uh I I saw um uh brother Robert Fulfurfort. Amen. Uh this is uh brother uh Maris's grandfather's brother, right? So to make him grand uncle. Yeah. Something like that. Um it kept we we were at the funeral yesterday and I want to thank Spirit and Truth Tabernacle for all you did to support uh the Anderson Fulfoot family in their time of loss. continue to keep them in your prayers. Uh but I as I looked around the the sanctuary yesterday and looked all the Spirit and Truth tabernacle faces, I was like, "Amen. Amen. Amen." Uh just appreciate you all so so much. Sister Tina get in where she fit in all the time. And Amen. We appreci we just really really thank God uh uh for that. But uh but uh brother Robert was telling us that he you know I didn't know he was going to stop in today but he lives in in in South Carolina but you know they got the address and they came today and you brought with you &gt;&gt; Reverend Cena Washington. So good to have you with us. God God bless you. God bless you. Amen. So we thank God for them. And uh with our constraint for time this morning I got to go right into the word. I have a a thought that I want to present and I've been um uh telling y'all about this for a little bit and I I have a feeling I will not get through the whole thing today, but uh but we'll get started. Amen. With this and I know that um there are there are some things coming up on our schedule that will kind of delay me from getting back to it, but nonetheless uh we'll we'll go with what we got. So, if you don't mind standing to your feet, we'll read the scripture. uh briefly here uh we will turn to a familiar passage out of Jeremiah chapter 29. Amen. Jeremiah chapter 29. Amen. And um I am one that you have to follow me. Amen. Because uh I I'm not going to be saying what everybody else is typically saying. I'm going be saying something a little different because I think it's needful and necessary. But this scripture is a very familiar passage to most Christians. Amen. Let's start at verse 11 uh in Jeremiah 29. Amen. The Bible says, "For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, sayeth the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you an expected end. Then shall you call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you, and ye shall seek me and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart. And verse 14 says, "And I will be found of you, sayeth the Lord, and I will turn away your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, uh, and from all the places where I have driven you, sayeth the Lord, and I will bring you again into the place whence I caused you to be carried away captive." Let's bow in a brief word of prayer. Father, we thank you for the ability to read the scripture. Um we ask oh God that the Holy Ghost would come now and reveal to us uh what is necessary for us at this time. We trust God that you would just minister to each and every heart that is here. Those that will be those that are listening online. We ask that you minister to them that you God would just give them strength. We want to remember um the saints in the Philippines and our prayers that God you would just cover them and and watch over them during this time they're suffering from this typhoon uh saints in Jamaica God that have endured a hurricane and Lord many have lost a lot in in this. So we pray that you would restore uh all that the people have lost. We have some saints that are not feeling well in their bodies. We ask that you would touch remember my mother-in-law God, Sister Cobb this morning. touch her in her body. Remember brother and sister Capers as he uh called me and said sister Capers wasn't feeling her best. So pray that you would touch her, Father, and that you would just bring healing to her body, watch over Sister uh Virginia as she had to travel there to um uh coming from Australia and then going straight to Alabama. God, give her traveling mercy as she goes to and fro. And Lord, just uh pray God that you would just uh meet the needs of your people. Uh we just uh each and everyone that's that's not able to make it this morning, remember them, Father, right where they are. Bring healing to every heart and to everybody. God is our prayer. It's in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you. You can be seated. Uh I want to uh start amen journey uh with this title uh inspiration during the restoration. Amen. inspiration during the restoration. Amen. And um you know, we we want to just read a a few quotes here uh from God's prophet and um just kind of get us moving in a particular direction. Um this first one is coming out of the sermon possessing the enemy's gates. a sermon that was preached possessing the enemy ga enemy's gates and it says um was only a few years later when the trials come and the church got all shook up as is so easy for a congregation of people to do when something just don't seem to happen the way it's supposed to be. Praise the Lord. Now, now, and and when things don't go the way people think it's supposed to be, then what happens to people is they get all shook up. &gt;&gt; And and there's no need to be shook up. &gt;&gt; If you could just go back in your mind and see what God has already done. If he's already done it, then there's it's it's more than possible that he will do it again because he is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Sometimes we just need to take a trip down memory lane. Remember where God already brought you from. Remember the healings that he already brought to your body. Amen. Those healings were for you to use that testimony for this time when you got this new trial. Because when you get through this trial, there'll be another trial. But every trial you ought to use as a stepping stone. The victory that God gives you in one trial is a stepping stone to give you victory in the next trial. &gt;&gt; So as believers, we should not all be shook up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like we don't know what's happening. &gt;&gt; I think the Bible says, "THINK IT NOT STRANGE the fiery trials that come to try you." &gt;&gt; But but it's it's precious gold. My God, your trial is like precious gold that God has given you. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we got to learn to be grateful &gt;&gt; for the trial. &gt;&gt; Learn to be thankful &gt;&gt; for the trial. &gt;&gt; All right. All right. Let me let me keep reading here. He says, "Just don't seem to happen the way that it's supposed to be." And look at look at this statement. God makes it that way. Look at this other God brings tensions into the church. &gt;&gt; Boy, I tell you this, this is this is rich to me. &gt;&gt; You mean you mean the devil didn't do that? &gt;&gt; NO. GOD brings tensions into the church. You know, IT WAS GOD THAT SUGGESTED. &gt;&gt; HE HE SUGGESTED THAT. HAVE YOU CONSIDERED &gt;&gt; MY SERVANT JOB? [screaming] &gt;&gt; AIN'T NONE LIKE HIM IN THE EARTH? &gt;&gt; AND AND GOD ALLOWED TENSION TO COME INTO JOB'S [screaming] LIFE. BUT THAT TENSION ALLOWED JOB, AMEN, TO SAY THINGS THAT PROBABLY WOULD NEVER NEVER EVER BEEN SAID. HE MY GOD, HE BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT A RESURRECTION. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. MY THOUGH HE [screaming] SLAY ME &gt;&gt; THAT THAT WOULD NOT HAVE COME OUT OF JOB HAD HE NOT BEEN GOING THROUGH TENSIONS. THOUGH HE SLAY ME [screaming and cheering] &gt;&gt; YET WILL I TRUST HIM. &gt;&gt; TENSION BEGINS TO BRING CERTAIN [screaming] THINGS OUT OF US. TENSION BRINGS SONGS. TENSION BRINGS SERMONS. TENSION BRINGS REVIVAL. [screaming] TENSION BRINGS STUFF. WE WOULD HAVE NEVER KNOWN GOD AS A HEALER HAD WE NOT HAD TENSION. &gt;&gt; COME ON. WHEN YOUR FINANCES GET TIGHT, [screaming] YOU WOULD HAVE NEVER KNOWN HIM AS A WAY MAKER HAD YOU NOT HAD TENSION. &gt;&gt; WE THANK [screaming] GOD &gt;&gt; FOR TENSION. God makes it that way. &gt;&gt; God &gt;&gt; brings tensions into the church. &gt;&gt; For every son that COMETH TO GOD MUST be tried &gt;&gt; and proven &gt;&gt; and tested. He lets &gt;&gt; sickness strike you. &gt;&gt; Now, now, now, and when I I love it when it when when you know it's it's just stated he let sickness because when again when you think about Job's situation, you know, nothing could have happened to Job until God actually gave &gt;&gt; God had to give permission. And and the reason God gave permission because he needed to prove to the devil &gt;&gt; this guy ain't like the rest of them. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Say say I guarantee I guarantee I guarantee you let me do this, you let me do that, this man will stop serving you. I guarantee God say uhuh. Watch it. You can take you can take his money. &gt;&gt; You can take his children. &gt;&gt; You can take his business. &gt;&gt; I mean you can take all kind of stuff. But this man right here will not stop serving me. &gt;&gt; Oh my. We got some modern day jobs in our midst. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; People that NO MATTER WHAT THE DEVIL HAS DONE, [screaming] YOU STILL FIND THEM IN CHURCH. &gt;&gt; THEY STILL GOT A HALLELUJAH [screaming] ON THE INSIDE. &gt;&gt; MODERN DAY JOBS. I I'm I'm I'm I I know I ain't going to get through this. I know it. &gt;&gt; But but my mind goes to another man that that that he was a modern day job from back in the early uh 1800s. I'm going to say in the 1800s. I want to I want to say it that way. But this man had gone through Amen. um a great uh fire. and the fire it burned down his business &gt;&gt; and uh you know and he suffered from this with this fire and then you he said mean I just need to kind of get away and get a a little vacation so I'm going to take my my family you know on vacation he says but I got some things going on I'm have to I'm going have to put my my wife and my kids on the first boat and uh and then I'mma catch the second boat and I think even before that some kind of way he had a son and lost a son you know and and as he as he has his girls on the boat and his wife on the boat. Uh the boat goes down that they're on and the only one that's that's living amen from this this incident is his wife. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And his wife sends a telegram back to Chicago and says, "I saved alone. I'm the only one saved out of all this. We done lost the business. We done lost our son. We done lost our kids. And I'm the last one living." &gt;&gt; And she was there in Europe waiting on him to come. So he's on the next ship coming across. And as it's coming across the sea, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, they get to the spot where that that previous ship that went down. They say it was around this area &gt;&gt; that the ship went down. This man had all kind of tension inside of his life. &gt;&gt; And uh and then he said he said he said he says uh he said uh he said this was the area that it went down. He said, "Give me a pen. &gt;&gt; Give me a give me a sheet of paper." And rather than the man cry, hallelujah, at a moment like that. And it was perfectly normal had he begin to shed some tears BECAUSE HE HAD LOST so much. &gt;&gt; But rather THAN A MAN CRY, AMEN, SOMETHING WAS BIRTHED OUT OF THAT TENSION. &gt;&gt; AND IT'S A SONG THAT WE SING, AMEN, IN CHURCHES, AMEN, STILL TODAY FROM WHAT WAS BORN IN THAT MAN'S TENSION. THEN HE SAID, "WHEN peace &gt;&gt; like a RIVER &gt;&gt; ATTENDETH MY WAY, [screaming] &gt;&gt; WHEN SORROWS LIKE SEA BILLOWS ROLL, HE SAYS, "WHATEVER MY [screaming] LOT, WHATEVER GOD GOT FROM ME, WHATEVER MY LOT, THOU HAS TAUGHT ME TO SAY," HE ALREADY [screaming] LEARNED WHAT TO SAY IN THE MIDST OF HIS TENSION. HE SAID, "IT IS WELL. PRAISE GOD. IT IS WELL WITH [screaming] MY SOUL. &gt;&gt; ALL OF THAT IS BIRTH ATTENTION. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oatio Spafford is his name. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Don't don't don't run from tension. &gt;&gt; God get ready to do something. He's getting ready to make a way out of nowhere. &gt;&gt; He's getting ready to open up doors you can't see. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Tension when you lose your job &gt;&gt; because he got a better job waiting for you. [applause] &gt;&gt; Look, &gt;&gt; and see I I I I I know cuz you know I I I had all kind of tension when I was working &gt;&gt; and God knew that I wasn't going to quit. them them folk send me through write me up for this and write me up for THAT. I STILL BE BACK TO WORK. God had to make THE PEOPLE JUST FIRE HIM. DON'T GIVE HIM NO [laughter] REASON. JUST FIRE [screaming] HIM BECAUSE GOD HAS SOMETHING GREATER. HAD I BEEN WORKING THERE, I wouldn't have been able to go to Australia. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; HEY, GOD KNOWS HOW TO TURN YOUR attention &gt;&gt; into a testimony. [cheering and applause] That's right. &gt;&gt; Truth, mother. &gt;&gt; He lets diseases come on you to test you and to prove you, to show the world that you're truly the seed of Abraham. &gt;&gt; He permits it &gt;&gt; by his own will. Look at this. He permits disasters. &gt;&gt; He permits the friends to turn AGAINST YOU. &gt;&gt; HE PERMITS ALL THESE things and turns the devil loose to tempt you. and he'll do all but take your life. &gt;&gt; He could throw YOU ON A BED OF AFFLICTION. &gt;&gt; HE COULD TURN YOUR NEIGHBORS AGAINST YOU. HE COULD TURN THE CHURCH AGAINST YOU. HE CAN DO ALL DO ANYTHING. AND IT'S GOD'S WILL FOR HIM TO DO IT. WE ARE TAUGHT THAT is more precious &gt;&gt; than gold &gt;&gt; to us. Your trial is more precious &gt;&gt; than gold. &gt;&gt; Let me read another one out of the United Time and sign. This sermon also deals with this this thought on tension and says just think just think of feelings. What if you didn't have any feeling? &gt;&gt; It says no pains or nothing. says, "What what what if there'd be no pain at all? You'd have no feelings at all." See, and if you had no feelings, then one of your s then one of your senses would be gone. &gt;&gt; So, see everything just right anyhow. God so God just give us grace to stand up to it. &gt;&gt; That's the thing. If I just stand up with that grace and stand there and say, "We know that when it when this life is over, the great one's on the other side where we're looking to go to." And remember that all these things that's attention, right? you know, and you know, I'm reminded of the the sister that was on the on the ship and they had told her, they says, you know, uh, y'all better y'all better start praying because um, this ship about to go down. And, uh, they say they said, "We don't, you know, we don't know what's going to happen here. Uh, either we going to make it to port in in a in a in a couple hours or we going to go down right here." So, y'all better start praying right now. So, the lady, she didn't start praying. The lady said, "Hallelujah." &gt;&gt; They said, they say, "Sister, you better start praying. You You praising." No, it's time to pray. &gt;&gt; The lady said, "Hallelujah." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And uh they said this, "Ma'am, what is the matter with you?" She said, "Well, here's what I was thinking." &gt;&gt; She says, "Uh, if the ship makes it, &gt;&gt; I got a daughter in New York waiting on me and I get a chance to see her. But if the ship don't make it, &gt;&gt; I got a daughter in glory &gt;&gt; waiting on me. &gt;&gt; So no matter what the situation, I'm in a win. [cheering] &gt;&gt; I got one waiting ON ME IN BOTH PLACES. SO HALLELUJAH. ANYHOW, [cheering] &gt;&gt; you got sometime you got to just make the devil mad. You you you got you got to show him whose side you on. &gt;&gt; And that ain't nothing he can bring in your life that won't give God glory. [cheering] [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't want me to testify about it, you better not bring it my way. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. It says uh sometimes people tries to introduce Christianity that you're free from worry. You're not. You're free from tension. Oh, no. You add tension when you become a Christian. [laughter] No, you add tension, right? And and and you know, and and and I I I I I like to say it like this. Whether you're a Christian or not a Christian, you still got something you're going through, right? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; People that don't don't follow Jesus, they got stuff they go through. They get sick, too. &gt;&gt; Right. They get sick, but they ain't got no promise to get well, &gt;&gt; they have financial problems, too. &gt;&gt; But they ain't got no promise of nobody rebukeing, no devour for their sake. &gt;&gt; They ain't GOT NONE OF THAT. BUT AS A CHRISTIAN, WE might have those, BUT WE GOT PROMISES THAT WE CAN HOLD GOD to &gt;&gt; and watch him prove himself in the midst of our tension. &gt;&gt; You add tension when you become a Christian because you kind of are you kind of a a slop goappy golucky whatever it was out there not caring what you did. &gt;&gt; Tension bring you to church. Tension make you get on the prayer line with the sisters. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Tension make you get on the prayer line with the brothers. Tension do those things cuz without it you just happy golucky. &gt;&gt; You at the um thrift store. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You out shopping somewhere while the saints are praying. But let God put a little tension in life. Saints, I just wanted to get on and tell y'all would y'all please pray with me and pray for me. Now, I'm going to tell y'all something. When you going through something, just don't have folk praying for you. You need to be praying with people. &gt;&gt; Don't jump on the line say, "I ain't praying, but y'all pray for me." NO. YOU THE ONE BROUGHT THE REQUEST. YOU OUGHT TO BE PRAYING, TOO. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Now, I ain't strong enough to pray. Yes, you are. &gt;&gt; You can You can You can Lord, I thank you for the trial. I know you're going to bring me through. You can say something &gt;&gt; all right. Now &gt;&gt; tension to do these things to you cuz you're too happy golucky. &gt;&gt; He says but when you become a real Christian every moment you're wondering am I pleasing my Lord? &gt;&gt; If I could hear from him it puts it puts you on tension puts you on guard. That's what makes you what you are. So, so after all, tension is a blessing. &gt;&gt; It's just the way you're looking at it. &gt;&gt; It's just the way you're looking at it. See, if you just look the other side, no matter how thin you slice anything, you still got two sides to it. &gt;&gt; So, see, you want to see both sides. So any anytime you're going through a trial, make sure you're looking at both sides &gt;&gt; cuz sometime the devil only show you one side of the trial. Look at both sides. &gt;&gt; Amen. So tension I think, oh my, what's tension? He says, if I could have been born without this tension, well, if I wouldn't have had this tension, see that's the way we think. I wouldn't have been what I am. I wouldn't have been a Christian. Perhaps &gt;&gt; it was this tension that drove me to Jesus Christ. See, it's been a blessing thing to me. &gt;&gt; Tension brought you to Jesus. &gt;&gt; And t tension to keep you at his feet. &gt;&gt; Thank God for tension. &gt;&gt; Jeremiah 29:11 told us, "For I know the thoughts that I think toward you that's in the midst of your tension. I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the Lord. Thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end. God got a God got something that he want to do through the midst of all of this. And uh and and he has an expected end that he wants to bring you to. Now, now now I'm going to uh I told you I'm I'm I'm going to kind of start in one direction. And this just to try to encourage you, right? &gt;&gt; Praise God. I I just want to encourage you uh because this scripture in Jeremiah 29:11, amen, is a uh a scripture that so many people turn to when they have tension in their life. This is a a scripture that gives them strength and encouragement to know that God got a greater plan. I believe I believe Paul even said, "And we know that all things work together for the good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose." Right? So, so we go to scriptures like this as believers when we're going through tensions. &gt;&gt; And and I want to before I go too too far in, Amen. this Jeremiah, the script in Jeremiah. Let me just, you know, just kind of give you some encouragement because, you know, it can be used in this matter. But there is a greater meaning to that scripture &gt;&gt; and we going to we're going to get to the greater meaning. But let me just kind of pause for a second and at least give you something that'll uplift your inner man. Now, now when I when I when I I looked at this scripture, I conducted a Google search on a devotion on Jeremiah 29:11 and it returned with an AI summary of the following. So, this AI summary is taking just uh uh thoughts from different devotions all over the all over the web and it's just kind of compiling them and giving it back to you. Right? So, the AI summary, Amen. When you look at Jeran 29:11, you can just leave it on the screen there for a second. uh when you look at this for I know the thoughts that I think towards you sayith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end. Uh one of the one of the the the the say the key themes for the for this devotion is you got to be able to trust God's timing. &gt;&gt; This is what AI said about it. &gt;&gt; AI said you got to be able to trust God's time. Now, hey, I gotta tell you to do that. [laughter] &gt;&gt; TRUST GOD'S TIMING. AND IT SAY GOD'S plans are not always immediate or what you expect. &gt;&gt; The verse reminds you TO TRUST HIS TIMING AS he is working in the background when you are in a difficult or exile season of life. &gt;&gt; THAT MEAN GOD IS ALWAYS WORKING in the background. Even when I can't see it, you're working. Even when I can't feel it, you're working. YOU NEVER STOP. YOU NEVER STOP WORKING. &gt;&gt; WE SING IT, BUT WE GOT TO BELIEVE IT. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; SO JEREMIAH 29:11 TELLS YOU TO BE ABLE TO TRUST GOD'S TIMING. &gt;&gt; ANOTHER thing that IT SAYS IS THAT YOU HAVE TO ENDURE THROUGH SUFFERING. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. YEAH. &gt;&gt; You know, we we as Christians, we think we're not going to have no trials, &gt;&gt; no suffering. Jesus had to go to a cross &gt;&gt; and we got to take up take up our cross AND FOLLOW HIM. RIGHT. SO SO, SO WE GOT TO BE WILLING TO ENDURE THROUGH SUFFERING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Not not not just to the trial, but through the trial. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They said the original context of the verse was to people in exile. A devotional can help you see that God's promise is to provide the strength to endure hardship, not to immediately remove it. He is present with you through your suffering and his ultimate purpose is to bring you peace and a future of hope. &gt;&gt; Here's another thing that they say. when you're in a trial, you're going through tension and and AI summary says you got to be able to surrender control. &gt;&gt; Now, that's that's that's what we need. You see, cuz see what happens now. You done run out of control. &gt;&gt; It's out of your hands now. &gt;&gt; And you know what? God been trying to get it there for a long time, &gt;&gt; but you done did this and you done did that and I done did this and I done did that. Now, when it's out of your hands, whose hands you going to put it in? They say you got to be able to surrender control. Trusting God's plan involves releasing your own anxieties &gt;&gt; and the need to understand. &gt;&gt; Let me let me say that again. When you're surrendering control, &gt;&gt; trusting God's plan involves releasing your own anxieties and the need to understand the why behind your struggles. Anybody know what that why is? Why me? &gt;&gt; Why this? &gt;&gt; And then there's another question that comes. Why not you? &gt;&gt; Why not this? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Who are you that you can't have a trial? &gt;&gt; It's just an opportunity. The other side of this trial, if you're LOOKING AT BOTH SIDES, IT'S an opportunity for God to show himself strong on your behalf. Amen. &gt;&gt; He going to need a trial to do that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. You know, it's one thing when we live off testimonies from years gone by, but God wants some fresh testimonies today. &gt;&gt; And the only way to have a fresh testimony, we got to have a fresh trial. &gt;&gt; Trusting God's plan involves releasing your own anxieties and the need to understand the why behind your struggles. It's about surrendering your desires to his perfect will and trusting that his plans are greater than your own. &gt;&gt; I'm grateful for the encouragement that we find in the devotional on Jeremiah 29 and 11. We can find inspiration in this when we're going through the trials of life. But Jeremiah 29 was actually related to a prophecy &gt;&gt; and the prophecy was giving regarding the restoration of the temple after the exile to Babylon. So, a lot of people go to Jeremiah 29:11, but really we need to start at verse 10. And we're going to read to verse 15 because there are some elements here that speak of something much greater than just your personal trial. &gt;&gt; Let's read from Amen. verse 10. For thus sayeth the Lord, that after 70 years be accomplished at Babylon, I will visit you and perform my good word toward you and causing you to return to this place. That alone right THERE TELLS YOU GOD was speaking of a restoration for Israel after they went into Babylonian captivity. &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name OF THE LORD. GOD ALREADY KNEW AND GOD ALREADY PROPHESIED THROUGH JEREMIAH THAT I'M GOING TO BRING YOU BACK TO THIS SPOT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO BRING YOU BACK. I'M GOING TO BRING YOU BACK FROM BABYLON. I SOMEBODY AMEN. THIS MORNING MIGHT BE IN BABYLON, [screaming] BUT GOD HAS MADE A PROMISE TO BRING YOU BACK OUT OF BABYLON. WHAT IS BABYLON? IT'S A PLACE OF CONFUSION. &gt;&gt; GOD GONNA SETTLE [screaming] YOUR MIND, &gt;&gt; GIVE YOU BACK YOUR RIGHT MIND. WHEN THE DEVIL TRIED TO TAKE YOUR MIND, CONFUSE IT, GOD COME SETTLE THAT. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Then he says the next verse, for I know the thoughts. &gt;&gt; I know what you're thinking, but I know the thoughts. &gt;&gt; I know the thoughts that I think toward you. It ain't even about what your thoughts are. It's what God thinking towards you. And he's thinking these thoughts while you ARE IN BABYLON, WHILE YOU ARE IN BONDAGE, WHILE YOU ARE IN EXILE, GOD IS ALREADY THINKING THOUGHTS ABOUT YOUR FREEDOM. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And whatever he got to do &gt;&gt; in order to bring freedom to you, he will do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, we going we going we going we going to get into some things here. So, what what what was some of God's thoughts? &gt;&gt; Let's just keep reading. Let's keep reading. Let's let let me let me let me let let me let me for I know the thoughts that I think toward you sayeth the Lord. Thoughts of peace, &gt;&gt; not of evil &gt;&gt; to give you an expected end. That means God already know the end even before the beginning. Sometimes sometimes, you know, we worry about what's going on, but God see point A and point B. &gt;&gt; But there's a lot of stuff that happen in between before you get before you get to point B. Don't worry about all that. God saw point B. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And you going you're going to get to point B &gt;&gt; regardless of what you go through. You're going to get to point B. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To give you an expected end. Then shall you call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you. So the tension caused you to want to go and pray a little bit. &gt;&gt; You're going to need to pray now. &gt;&gt; Cuz it's out of your control. &gt;&gt; All right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't just send in a prayer request. Come pray. &gt;&gt; Come. We need you. I got things I need you to pray for me about. You want me to pray for you, but I need you to pray for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Oh Lord, help us, Jesus. No. No. You know, y'all know y'all know how Christians be. You know, I I'll pray for you. And then you forget. &gt;&gt; And you never pray. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You told her you was going. You told us she was going to pray, but you never prayed. You got too busy. &gt;&gt; And you forgot. Oh, I forgot. And then you just whisper some little prayer when you come through the door when you see see me. Oh, I forgot to pray for him. Lord, bless him. Help them, God. No. No. Come on. Come on. Let's be Christians. &gt;&gt; Let's really be Christians. Let's get down to business with God. &gt;&gt; Every other Tuesday night, come to the prayer line. It's only twice a month. &gt;&gt; Come to the prayer line and release a prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All right. Let me let me um verse 12. All right. Uh then shall you call upon me and ye shall go go and pray unto me and I will hearken unto you and ye shall seek me and find me when you shall search for me with all your heart. &gt;&gt; And I will be found of you, sayaeth the Lord, and I will turn away your captivity. So they were in bondage, but now God's getting ready to bring them out of bondage. I will turn away your captivity and I will gather you from all nations and from all the places whether I have I have driven you sayeth the Lord and I will bring you again into this into the place which I called you to be carried away captive. So this is a a prophecy. Now look at this next verse. Because ye have said the Lord hath raised us up prophets in Babylon. Prophets in Babylon. Yeah, Daniel &gt;&gt; was a prophet sir &gt;&gt; in Babylon. I got some more to tell you that were prophets in Babylon that God raised up. Zachchariah &gt;&gt; was a prophet in Ba Babylon. Um uh let me give you another one here. Lord have mercy. We know Jeremiah was a prophet in Babylon. Zachchariah Haggi was a prophet in Babylon. Ezra &gt;&gt; was a prophet in Babylon. You want to know another one? Malachi. &gt;&gt; So there's some inspiration that comes &gt;&gt; during the restoration. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Bear with me. When we look at this Jeremiah 29, we can see restoration is promised. We can see God has thoughts of peace and not of evil. We can see God has an expected end that is promised. And and as I was just, you know, meditating on these scriptures, I remember brother Quinton Jr. making a statement. We have been on this journey for the last two years uh through the thought of I will restore, sayeth the Lord. Amen. And God has just uh just done so much. We see restoration all around us. This was not a uh a uh uh void or a blank or a unfruitful inspiration. Let's put it that way cuz we see fruit come back from the from the inspiration that God gave Spirit and Truth Tabernacle out of Joel chapter 2. I will restore sayith the Lord. And then and then that that started two years ago. The inspiration started two years ago. And since it carried over into this year, it became the year of overflow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we had saints in this church experience different overflows in their life. All the way up to LA Wednesday night. Y'all heard a testimony, Brother Quinton Senior, talking about an overflow, &gt;&gt; a check that had been held up and they did nine years of back pay. &gt;&gt; I'm starting to look at my account, too. Like, hey, when the angel troubling the water, you better jump in. Yeah, &gt;&gt; who owe me some money. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. BUT WE SEE GOD has brought fruit from the off the inspiration that he's given us. &gt;&gt; And I and I do believe that God's going to change us as we go into next year. But uh but here I'm I'm kind of bringing amen almost like a final thought on this whole uh uh uh restoration, the inspiration during the restoration. And and here, you know, brother Quinton Jr. mentioned uh in one of the sermons that he preached during this se this series, he says uh we can see the theme of restoration throughout the scriptures. &gt;&gt; And as I'm looking here in the book of Jeremiah, restoration pops up again. &gt;&gt; Now, let me just bring a a quote from the restoration of the bride tree. As God prophet uh mentioned it, he says to restore means to bring back. So now Israel is getting ready to be brought back to their homeland. Amen. Here in the book of Jeremiah, I mean Jeremiah's prophesied that they would go away for 70 years, but now they're about to be brought back. Amen. And and and and in bringing them back, God uses the the words of prophets, amen, to encourage the people in their return back to Jerusalem or back to Judah. God uses, Amen, the the the words from a prophet to kind of bring the people back. God has done the exact same thing today because it's not a physical place that we're trying to go to, but it is a spiritual place that God is trying to bring the back bring the people back to. &gt;&gt; Amen. The church has lost its way spiritually. &gt;&gt; Oh, God help us. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, the church has lost ITS WAY SPIRIT AND THEY TRYING TO FIND DEEP things in the word of God. Some of the studying that they they doing, they don't really don't don't even realize what they tapping into. Trying to find something deep. &gt;&gt; IT'S SO DEEP THAT IT'S OFF. &gt;&gt; IT'S SO DEEP THAT IT'S WRONG. &gt;&gt; HELLO, SOMEBODY. &gt;&gt; I ain't never heard these things in my life. &gt;&gt; Let me just leave that alone. Let me go on. To restore means to bring back &gt;&gt; or to restore. A claim can be enforced not to bring anything back to its rightful owner where where it belongs. Therefore, some way it went away from its rightful owner and can wander around anywhere, but to restore is TO BRING IT BACK to who really owns it. SEE, ISRAEL OWN JERUSALEM and Judah AND ALL THAT. GOD WAS GETTING READY TO BRING THEM BACK TO WHAT THEY OWN. EVEN THOUGH THEY'VE BEEN IN EXILE FOR OVER 70 YEARS, NOW IT'S TIME TO COME BACK. OH MY. &gt;&gt; I know some. So, there's a time limit on your bondage. &gt;&gt; There's a time limit. There's a time limit on your bondage. Can I go a little further? There's a time limit on your family's bondage. &gt;&gt; There's a time limit. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; They they they got to come out at some point in time. &gt;&gt; I I I saw a young sister yesterday. I I say, "I I I miss you, sis. I miss seeing you at church. I miss just even if you want to go into my church, just seeing you in church somewhere. I miss you. &gt;&gt; You got to sew seeds. &gt;&gt; I don't care what is going on in your life. that don't that don't don't keep in a state of exile. There's a time limit, an expiration date for your exile. &gt;&gt; I I believe I I believe was written there in the Old Testament that God God pro God provides a means that his banished be not expelled. &gt;&gt; People end up in banishment sometime, but they can't be expelled. Y'all going to make me go back and preach that sermon. Let me keep reading. &gt;&gt; He says, um, therefore, some way it went away from its rightful owner, can wander around anywhere, but to restore is to bring back to to it who really owns it or to bring it back to its natural estate where it was at the first time. BRING IT BACK into its natural condition. In order to do this, we have a right to enforce. If there's a law to enforce this rightful condition of restoration to restore, like if somebody stole some property &gt;&gt; and they're holding the property captive, &gt;&gt; then you can take the law &gt;&gt; and go to this person and the law forces, my God, I like that enforces this PERSON TO RESTORE THIS property back to its natural owner. &gt;&gt; Somebody steal your telephone. You got the brand new iPhone &gt;&gt; and they done stole it. &gt;&gt; But you catch them &gt;&gt; now. You ain't got to fight with them. &gt;&gt; Just just just make a telephone call. Keep your eye on them. &gt;&gt; Make a telephone call. Get the law involved. Say, "Look, I need I'm I'm reporting some stolen property. I know it's my phone. My name is all in the thing &gt;&gt; and it's and it's locked. They can't get in to erase anything. All you do is just when you get it to me, let me put my code in and you'll see my name and you'll know that this belong to me. &gt;&gt; If it's their phone, tell them to put the code in. &gt;&gt; Ask them to unlock it. Put their thumb print on it &gt;&gt; and unlock it. They say it's theirs. I say it's mine. &gt;&gt; Let's see who thumbrint IT MATCHES. &gt;&gt; YOU AIN'T GOT TO FIGHT WITH THEM. You just you just get the law involved. And the law is THERE TO MAKE SURE YOU GET BACK WHAT BELONGS TO YOU. THE HOLY GHOST IS HERE TO MAKE SURE YOU GET BACK [screaming] EVERYTHING THAT BELONGS TO YOU, &gt;&gt; BROTHER. LIKE IT WAS IN THE DAYS OF DAVID. [screaming] I SHALL RECOVER ALL. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I ain't just taking part of it back. I want it all back. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here, let's go on. He says like if somebody stole some property and they're holding the property captive, then you can take the law to go to this person. The law forces and force this person to restore this property back to its natural owner, the first estate enforcement says, "Oh, what a text. I like to have two days on that enforce." Now, brother Neville never preach for us. Amen. I'm just talking to you. teach a Sunday school lesson and and it'll get into continue on I hope uh I hope with what he what he what he had he says enforce then we are we have the privilege to enforce upon Satan the claims that God give us for God has a law and his word is a law and God and his word made certain claims to his church therefore we have a right to force these claims upon Satan and say give it back. &gt;&gt; And he has to do it &gt;&gt; because we can take God's agent, &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit, go right down on our knees &gt;&gt; and say is thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; Do you realize what we have in this season of restoration, we can tell the devil, give back health, &gt;&gt; right? Give back OUR CHILDREN. GIVE BACK MY MONEY THAT YOU TOOK FROM ME. GIVE IT BACK. [screaming] AND IT'S NOT US TO FORCE. IT'S NOT UP TO US TO FORCE THE DEVIL. IT'S THE HOLY GHOST THAT WILL FORCE the devil do it. &gt;&gt; This whole this whole little thought here that Brother Brandham's sharing, it comes from a a situation where a man lost his car. &gt;&gt; He was at the meeting &gt;&gt; at the service and in service somebody come up on the church property, stole the man car off the property. &gt;&gt; He he traveled from I don't know how far to get there. And I mean all this traveling I get there and somebody steal my car. You know that's tension. &gt;&gt; So you know why they why they they they they what we going to do? What we going to do? They finally got the the prophet and say he said you know just pray please. And then then he says uh uh the scripture was quickened to him. If you abide in me and my words abide [snorts] in you, then ye shall ask &gt;&gt; what you will &gt;&gt; and it'll be done. When that when that scripture quickened to him, he prayed differently. &gt;&gt; And as he was praying for the man's car, a vision came. He say, "I see your car coming back." He said it's going to be half full when you get it because he going to take it somewhere and he got to bring it all the way back here and it's going to be found in such AND SUCH SPOT EXACTLY THE WAY THE VISION SHOWED IT. That's the way they found it. And it SAID WHAT HE DID WAS JUST PRAY. And when he prayed, he released THE AGENT, THE HOLY GHOST, TO GO AFTER THAT CAR AND BRING IT BACK. WE GOT TO RELEASE THE HOLY GHOST TO GO AFTER SOME THINGS AND BRING IT BACK. AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD WANTS YOU TO RELEASE HIM TO GO GET IT. &gt;&gt; HE WANTS TO GET IT BACK TO YOU. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Let me Amen. Look, look, let me let me let me finish this little piece here. Uh all right. It says uh give it back. It has to do it because we can take God's agent, the Holy Spirit, go right down on our knees and say it is thus says the Lord. He's got to give it up. That's all. because the Holy Spirit is there to make him do it. &gt;&gt; The law of the land is to enforce. It's by the land and it's for the land. But the law of the spirit of God is to for Satan to give up &gt;&gt; that which he has unrightfully, &gt;&gt; deceitfully &gt;&gt; taken from God. &gt;&gt; SOULS of men, &gt;&gt; he took from God. souls of women, children, sickness of the body, he placed upon people where God made them in his image TO BE LIKE HIM. And the church is given the rightful legal the rightful LEGAL RIGHTS BY THE BIBLE to take the Holy Spirit and enforce this &gt;&gt; upon them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Man, I we started out with that quote two years ago and and I'm bringing it almost at the end again because uh you know two years ago I'm I'm reading it by faith. &gt;&gt; But today &gt;&gt; I can tell you that the devil done gave it BACK [applause] &gt;&gt; and he ain't just because now remember if you catch him stealing According to Exodus 20, &gt;&gt; if you catch your a thief's stealing, &gt;&gt; boy, that's &gt;&gt; boy, you that's rough. &gt;&gt; You you I know you stole because you needed this. &gt;&gt; Now I don't know what you you're going have to give me mine back. &gt;&gt; And I don't know what you got to do to go get the other part because according to the law, &gt;&gt; the law says you got to give me double. &gt;&gt; So I'm going to take this plus this. Yes. &gt;&gt; And and I hope you don't have to steal the second thing from somebody else. Because if you do, guess what you got to do to them? You're going to have to pay them double. &gt;&gt; And we caught the devil stealing &gt;&gt; souls of men, souls of women. &gt;&gt; Got our children wrapped up and tied up in all kind of stuff. &gt;&gt; But we had to claim our children. And God gave me double &gt;&gt; cuz the Lord allowed in this season of restoration, God allowed me to baptize my own son-in-law. [cheering] &gt;&gt; I know I got double for my trouble. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; And I and God ain't finished yet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God ain't in no hurry. &gt;&gt; He knows just when to move. All right. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; All right, give me uh let me give give me give me one other thing and I want to I want to just shift gears. Like I told you, I know I won't get through all of this, but I think we'll we'll we'll get far enough. Um this is out of United Time and Sign. Just one more that I want to read and then I want to just give you some other uh information. says, "Speaking of tension, I was praying about it this morning. What would you do if you didn't have tension? Just think of it. Tension is part of living." [snorts] He says, "That kind of encouraged me when I thought of that. If you had no tension, you'd be like a ragd doll. &gt;&gt; You wouldn't have no feelings. There'd be nothing you could work on. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; like a husband and wife maybe if she wants to do something as they're trying to work together especially Christian Christians and the and the other one wants and and then when you come together to and and find out she's done she she finds out see the tension really brings you closer together [snorts] you know one of the things a husband's wife some sometimes go through is how money gonna be handled &gt;&gt; amen wife looking at that extra money for This husband thinking car parts and and I I need tires, need this, I need that. Wife saying the kids need clothes. They growing out of this and growing out of that. And she say I need my hair done. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. the husband thinking, you know, I one time went to the the the store with my wife. She say she was, you know, going to get some hair cuz she wanted to get her hair done. And I I walked that there like I was, "Boss, baby, I'll take care of it for you." And I uh I got to the register and uh the man said something. &gt;&gt; I think it said 80 or something dollars. I say for hair. Boy, I slip my wallet back in my pocket and I ease my way out the store. She got it. I know she got She wouldn't be in here if she ain't have it. But you know you you know sometimes in in in in in households the the the lady thinking about something else and the man thinking about something else and it bring tension in the household. &gt;&gt; Finances can bring tension. &gt;&gt; Praise God. But you know that tension actually bring you closer together. &gt;&gt; Lord let me let me let me let me let me let me say this. In every relationship &gt;&gt; there will be tensions. Now sister, be careful. When tension come in a relationship, you can't be telling all your family &gt;&gt; about the tension that's in your relationship and y'all. And then your husband, you know, you want him to come to the cookout, &gt;&gt; but when he get to the cookout, everybody looking at him funny. &gt;&gt; And the reason they looking at him funny because it's something that you said. And then y'all go back home and y'all get that tension all worked out. &gt;&gt; And now you in love with them all over again. &gt;&gt; But you forgot to go back and tell people that you was in love with them all over again. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's why you got to keep that tension to yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Same thing with the with the with the with the brothers. Be careful. You don't share all your business with everybody. &gt;&gt; They don't know how to handle it. &gt;&gt; Your kids don't know how to handle that type of information. &gt;&gt; You can't be sharing that with your children. &gt;&gt; They ain't even been in no committed relationship. &gt;&gt; They don't even know what that what it look like to be married and have to deal with pressures like brother Smiley was talking about last week. It's it's a different thing &gt;&gt; when you underneath the load. when you just kind of caring for yourself &gt;&gt; and your bills and you know you just struggle with just you. &gt;&gt; You know what I'm saying? You just be struggling with just you. Now when you get a wife and kids, &gt;&gt; brother, we going to see what a man is made of &gt;&gt; and and and and you got to go through some things. Oh Lord, help me Jesus. But but you got you got you got to be able to get underneath that load &gt;&gt; and and feel that tension. You know what it does sometime? It make you go back to school &gt;&gt; because you realize you ain't getting enough money in this job. &gt;&gt; And and when you look at how old them kids are, like brother Small saying say, you go to the store and and I need all six of them need shoes &gt;&gt; and you can forget about it. Jordans is out the question. &gt;&gt; Nobody going to get no Jordans around here. Bobo, [laughter] he said, "BUT ONLY THREE GOING TO GET IT, RIGHT? I GOT GOT SIX THAT NEED, BUT ONLY THREE GOING TO GET IT. AND I'M GOING HAVE TO WAIT TILL I CAN GET THE NEXT THREE. AND HOPEFULLY THEY THE OTHER ONES [screaming] WON'T GROW OUT OF THEIRS. CUZ WHEN YOU SEE ALL THIS AND HOW FAST THEY GROWING, &gt;&gt; TENSION, TENSION, TENSION, TENSION, &gt;&gt; eating up all the groceries. You you don't know what tension's like until you have to get underneath that load &gt;&gt; and it cause you to go to your knees in prayer. &gt;&gt; God, I need I I need cash. &gt;&gt; I need cash. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And then to watch God make a way. &gt;&gt; And then you can look back years later and see how God brought you through. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He was talking about how, you know, and and I showed, boy, I had I had credit cards. I had a credit card for Sears. I had one for JC Penney. I had one for Firestone. Anybody that can give me credit, I was using them because I was under pressure. But when I got it paid off, woo Lord, I thank God for that. &gt;&gt; I cut them up. &gt;&gt; After they was paid off, they was cut up. So, I could not go back to that anymore. &gt;&gt; I learned some lessons along the way. &gt;&gt; Oh my &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. All right. I'm coming. I'm coming. Uh you be like a ragd doll. You wouldn't have no feelings. There'd be nothing you could work on. Like a husband and wife maybe if she she wants to do something and they're trying to work together, especially Christians. And the other one want other one wants. And then when you come together, find out what she's done. She finds out. See the tension really brings you close together, closer together. And somebody tells you that well said just think of the little wife that went went under a lot of tension when you wasn't so good or the husband went under some tension when you wasn't so good. Then when it's all forgiven, look how you feel about them. My you just you got to you got to have tension. That's all. &gt;&gt; Just got to have the tension. is is it's necessary. All right, give me just a few more minutes in my Bible. I got a Bible um a Thomas Nelson Bible at home. And when we look at the book of Ezra, um the setting, the historical setting of the book of Ezra, it says the setting of Ezra is the post exileic era when the faithful Israelites return were returning from Babylon to Judah. so they could reestablish their temple worship. So this was all about restoration. The temple and the temple worship are vital subjects in all the books written during the post exilelic period. And some of the books that were written during the post exile period which means after exile after 70 years of exile in Babylon now they're coming back into Jerusalem or back into Judah. That's the post exilelic period. And uh some of the books that were written in the post exile period were 1 and 2 Coronicles, the book of Nehemiah was written during that time, the book of Haggi, the book of Zachchariah and Malachi. And so it says the people who returned to the land of promise were publicly acknowledging that they believe God would reestablish the nation and usher in a time of kingdom blessings. And uh and and another note here in the in the Bible says there were three returns from Babylon to the land of Israel. One happened in 538 BC. Another happened in 458 p BC and the third one happened in 444 BC. Just as there had been three deportations to Babylon. First one happened in 605 BC, 597 BC and 586 BC. So there was three deportations and then three returns. God know how to do things. The first return was led by Zerubbabel. &gt;&gt; All right. [snorts] And in Ezra chapters 1-6 we we we read about that. All right. And then u uh the first return was was led was was was led by Zer Zerubbabel. So Esther I'm sorry Ezra chapters 1-6. Also you find this in the book of Haggi and also in the book of Zechariah where they speak about Zerubbabel. All right. So he would have come in 538 BC. Uh the rebuilding of the temple was vital for this group. So we talk about uh inspiration during the restoration is the restoration of the temple. Okay. So there's there's uh the rebuilding of the temple was vital to this group. The second return was under Ezra and that's in Ezra chapter 7 through10. You read all about that. Uh and that happened in 458 BC. Uh the people needed reforming. They needed to return to their covenant obligations. But the third return was led by Nehemiah in 444 BC. And Nehemiah when he came, we know that there was a rebuilding of the walls uh during that time. Uh and you know, just just some really really you know, you go back and you just read some of the things there out of Nehemiah. You know, we we found a a scripture there a few years ago. We preached about how he sent unto them saviors. He sent saviors. That's written in the book of Nehemiah. And like, wait a minute, he sent saviors. I thought Jesus was the savior. He is the ultimate savior. But sometimes he uses you &gt;&gt; to act as a savior for others. Amen. &gt;&gt; He expresses his attribute through you. &gt;&gt; And I always give the example of when I was was drowning in in in in that pool and and that young lady happened to be coming by at the time that I I fell into the pool trying to scoop out a rock. Young lady come skating by. She was the the lifeguard, but uh she wasn't on duty that day. My cousins couldn't swim. Uh but here I am drowning. They in the shallow end and I'm in the in the deep end. I done fell in trying to get a rock out the pool. And uh so this girl comes skating by and she she saw me go down and she she took one skate off, could not get the second off in time, jumped in the water with a skate on in the deep end and she got me out. All I remember is when I woke up, I remember falling in, but when I woke up, it was people surrounded all around. There's fire trucks and I was in the lap of a fireman and all I looked up and I saw this man and I'm like what in the world done happened? I was just here with my cousins trying to get a rock out of the pool. What done? And and I mean in a matter of I don't even know how long it took for all them people to get there. They got me out and I'm in this man's lap just looking up at the rest of the world like what? And I was a lad. God had spared me from death &gt;&gt; cuz God knew he had a a a greater work. I I know the plans I have for you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. [applause] &gt;&gt; God had a greater plan for me. And the devil couldn't take me out then and he can't take me out now. [applause] &gt;&gt; But, you know, I I I looked at that young lady. I I don't know her name. I probably would never meet her on Facebook, but I believe one day I'll see her on the other side &gt;&gt; because she became a savior to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Ezra 5. Let's just read this really quick. Ezra 5 here in Ezra 5 verse one says then the prophets see he raised up prophets then the prophets Hagi the prophet and Zachchariah the son of Idu prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the Lord in the name of the God of Israel even unto them. And look at this. Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shilotil and Jesua the son of Joedc and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem. and with them were the prophets of God helping them. Now, this is the other thing that I like about this. I'm going to read a little bit more, but um not only are they prophesying, but they're involved in the work. See, it's one thing to, you know, to preach and and and and to do all these things, but if if if I'm really if I, you know, even if I if I if I if I encourage people to give towards something, I got to be willing to give, too. not just put the burden on everybody else. I got to be willing to put something in too. &gt;&gt; You know how you know, brother Mike used to tell me how the churches used to do that that you know they come up and have an offering and uh brother we trying to raise this much money and I'm going to start it out with $100. I'm going to start out with $100. I'm put my $100 in here and uh and they get everybody to come up there and give their $100. But the guys that's collecting the money, &gt;&gt; they go right back to the back. They count the money. They take their $100 and put it right back in their pocket. It happened in church, y'all. Y'all think I'm playing. It happens in church. They done took all your money, but they done put their money back in their pocket. And they coming back the next service with that same $100 like they got hundreds. No, they're using the same $100 bill &gt;&gt; and they robbing the people of God. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you another thing. If you got to go to a church and they got to have three or four offerings, something is wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't need to raise that kind of money. If God is watching over work, &gt;&gt; he will provide for it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, so what we see here is that these different prophets that Ezra is speaking of, we got we got Haggi, we got Zachchariah, Zerubbabel, you know, uh is being used during this time. And um uh um I want to skip down to verse seven just for sake of time. Let me just see something here. Hold on one second. Actually, actually before I go, let me um before since we since we see Zachcharias used there, I want to give you some inspiration during the restoration. Let's look at one of the scriptures that was spoken out of Zechariah 4 verse 6 and 7. Amen. Zechariah chapter 4 verse 6 and 7. [snorts] This is inspiration that comes during the restoration. Then he answered and spake to me, saying, This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel, saying, "Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts." &gt;&gt; This comes during this time of post uh their post exilelic uh uh uh era, right? So when they're coming back into the land, these different prophets rise up and they begin to speak these things over the people of God. I like this. It says, "Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit." Look, we when when when they got ready to rebuild that temple, Lord, I'm I'm I'm I'm going to get ahead of myself. I'm going to get ahead of myself. When they got ready to rebuild that temple, you know, sometimes when you look at might, it's like brute strength. we got a great army or something like that to do. They didn't have all of that to be able to rebuild the temple. They were going through a lot of challenges, a lot of tension when it was time to rebuild the temple as well as REBUILD THE WALLS. LOT OF TENSION WHEN THEY WAS REBUILDING THE WALLS. THEY HAD to have one people, they had to have a group of guys stand in guard with a sword while the others were laying bricks. &gt;&gt; Man, it was fight. I mean they had they had to fear for their life but not by might nor by power but by my spirit in the rebuilding of the temple. It's not going to be by might nor by power but by my spirit. Let me also say it this way. In the building of the temple in the building of the temple it's not by might &gt;&gt; nor by power but by his spirit. Now when I say in the building of the temple, I'm speaking present tense. &gt;&gt; I'm speaking for our church. It's not going to be by might, NOR WILL IT BE BY POWER, BUT IT'LL BE BY THE spirit of God. [applause] &gt;&gt; Let me give you another prophecy that went forth. Haggi chapter 2 verse 9. Haggi 2 and verse nine, the glory of this latter house &gt;&gt; shall be greater &gt;&gt; than of the former, &gt;&gt; sayeth the Lord of hosts. And in this place will I give peace, sayeth the Lord of hosts. Now here, Hagi is prophesying while he's working. Now, while they're working, they're prophesying. Look, look, look, look, look, look, fellas. Y'all don't see what I see. But the glory of this ladder house, not when Solomon built it, but now that it's being restored, it's going to be better than it ever was before. &gt;&gt; Woo! Restoration brings it back better. &gt;&gt; Restoration does not bring replacement. It brings up the same THING THAT WAS THERE. AMEN. [snorts] &gt;&gt; I I I'mma I'mma I'mma just uh I got to slip this in cuz I'm I'm I'm out of time. I'm out of time. You know, one of the glorious things about the latter house. Father, help me Jesus. One of the glorious things that happened and I and I I'm out of time. I'm I'mma read this to you maybe next week or next time I come. But one of the glorious things that happened in the in the latter house when it was when it was being put back up, just the foundation alone, when they just laid the foundation, I mean, the whole building wasn't even up. But when the when the when the saints saw the foundation laid, it caused them to go into a worship like never before. It was so much weeping and crying just to see the foundation. This was after 70 70 years of being away and now we come back and the foundation because when you see the foundation is is we going to we getting ready to bring up a whole building here. &gt;&gt; If the foundation here, we know if God laid the foundation, we know the rest of the building going to get be completed. God ain't just going to give us just a foundation. &gt;&gt; Oh my. It brought tears to my tears to the eyes when they just saw the foundation. Look, I'm telling you, God has given us. Amen. He's blessed our finances with so a foundation can be laid. &gt;&gt; We ought to be rejoicing with just a foundation. We know God going to complete the rest of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Boy, I tell you the truth. I want to show you something here in the scripture. when they Haggi says the the glory of the latter house. One of the other glorious things that happened about this latter house, &gt;&gt; the children of Israel did not have to pay for it to be built. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; I I'm I'm way ahead of myself, but I I just need to get this off my chest. That's a &gt;&gt; in Ezra chapter 6 cuz what happened in Ezra chapter 5 is that there were some people coming against the children of Israel like why y'all building this house? We going to send a letter to the king to find out what's going on. Y'all building so fast. What what is going on? And they they're trying to come tension was coming in and they're trying to figure out what's going on. They say they say they say look look look God has given us the uh ability to do this and and we got we got instructions from Cyrus in order to build this. He said if you don't believe us y'all write back and y'all ask Darius what happened and and look at the recordings of what Cyrus said. Let's go to uh uh uh chapter 6. Ezra chapter 6 and and verse one. I'mma read it real quick and I'mma I'mma I'm I'mma have to leave. Then Darius the king made a decree and search was made in the house of the rose where the treasures were laid up in Babylon. And there was found at Ametha in the palace that is in the province of the me a role and therein was a record thus written. Now in order to it's a role. So in order to to see what's in it, you got to unseal it. And there was found ECH in the palace that is in the province of the me a roll and and therein was a record that's written. Look at this. In the first year of Cyrus the king, the same Cyrus the king made a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem. Let the house be built, the place where they offered sacrifices. This was restoration. &gt;&gt; And let the foundations thereof be strongly laid, the height thereof three score cubits, and the breath thereof three score cubits. with three rows of great stones and a row of new timber. And let the expenses, &gt;&gt; let the expenses &gt;&gt; be given &gt;&gt; out of the king's house. &gt;&gt; Cyrus paid for the restoration of the temple. Now, I'm getting ready to leave you cuz every once in a while in your life, you're going to need a Cirrus. [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; And let me put IT THIS WAY, GOD GOING TO GIVE YOU A CYRUS &gt;&gt; IN order to pay for some of the things you can't pay for. &gt;&gt; SOME OF THE EXPENSES YOU CAN'T COVER, GOD WILL PLACE A CYRUS IN YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I'M RECEIVING CYRUS. &gt;&gt; MAN, THIS WAS SOME INSPIRATION DURING THE RESTORATION. LORD, SEND [screaming] CYRUS. &gt;&gt; RAISE UP CYRUS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I had to think about that scripture. &gt;&gt; We look for Cyruses a lot. But then I thought about this. I said, "Lord, make me a Cyrus." [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. &gt;&gt; See, there's testimonies I can share right there, but I I'm out of time. &gt;&gt; Don't just don't Don't have the mindset to always looking for Cyrus. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But why not? Why not? &gt;&gt; Why not be Cyrus? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The expenses can be paid out of the king's treasure. I I I'm I'm I'm I'm thinking of a scripture that says Oh my I got it right here. The wages of sin is death. But the gift of God is eternal life through the Lord Jesus Christ. What we find in the book of Ezra is that the expenses were paid by the king. &gt;&gt; Now that's naturally, but spiritually we also had expenses paid by the King of Kings. &gt;&gt; There is an expense to sin. You get paid for sin. The wages of sin is death. &gt;&gt; But the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. So there's an expense to sin. There is also an expense to set us free from sin. &gt;&gt; There's an expense also for restoration. &gt;&gt; You know AMC paid an expense to Abraham during restoration. The thief that was caught stealing in Exodus 20 also had to pay the expense of restoration. &gt;&gt; I want to let you know the King of Kings has paid your expense. &gt;&gt; When he went to the cross and died for your sins, your expenses are all covered. And it's a good feeling. I don't know. I've gone to restaurants sometime with other people and and the check comes and I'm ready to pay the expense, but I find out. &gt;&gt; Hey, somebody &gt;&gt; that has already been paid. &gt;&gt; And you know what? Especially when the when it's a big check, &gt;&gt; a big bill, &gt;&gt; I feel pretty good about that. You mean it didn't have to hit my bank account? &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; God bless. Whoever did that, God bless you. &gt;&gt; It's something about having your expenses paid. I'm telling you, the King of Kings has paid your expense. &gt;&gt; And and here's the other thing I'm looking for. I'm looking for the expense to come out of the King's chest again &gt;&gt; for our church and school. Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; Lord, send Cyrus or make me Cyrus. &gt;&gt; God bless you, church. God bless you. [applause] Praise the Lord. Let's have a word of prayer. Brother Solomon, I'll turn it back over to you. Musicians can make your way back forward. Father, we thank you, Lord Jesus, for your word on today. We thank you, Father, uh that we can just rejoice in the things that we see in scripture. You uh you have purpose for everything. Nothing is written just to be written, but God, you have divine purpose and and and and when we look at these things, it's not just for the day gone by. It's something we can apply even present tense. So help us Lord Jesus to see you in all the scripture. Father that we might not live beneath our privileges but we would live Lord in that place that you desire for us to live. Thank you for the inspiration that is all throughout this theme of restoration. And God, I pray that every ear that has heard the word today, that it would be a word that transforms our life, transforms our thinking, gives us purpose, gives us renewal, gives us hope. God, you know the plans you have for us to give us hope and a future.
