[44:44] [Applause]
[44:46] [Music]
[44:48] it's kind of hard to believe that we sit
[44:51] and and dissembler this the years really
[44:56] gone by pretty fast and so much is
[45:01] happening right before our eyes and I'm
[45:08] just but just I was just on Friday night
[45:18] talking a little to the church about
[45:20] some events that took place this week it
[45:24] was very to me the story with what
[45:28] President Trump did regarding making is
[45:33] making Jerusalem the capital city of
[45:35] Israel and you know I'm not one that
[45:40] that really deals too much in politics
[45:42] but I do follow Scripture and you know
[45:47] brother Branham told us that if we want
[45:50] to know what time it is then we should
[45:52] look at our watches or look at a clock
[45:55] if you want to know what day it is then
[45:57] look at a calendar and if you want to
[46:00] kind of get what time it is according to
[46:03] you know God's calculations he said
[46:07] watch Israel they've told us to watch
[46:09] Israel and
[46:12] you know the the thing of what happened
[46:16] there there was a statement made I was
[46:19] reading on CNN and they were saying that
[46:22] it's been seven decades since you know
[46:28] something like this has happened I spent
[46:30] seven decades which would amounts to 17
[46:33] years and you know you'll start looking
[46:37] at the 70 years then you have to go back
[46:39] and look at the 70 weeks
[46:42] Daniel right so these are some things
[46:44] that we need to go back and listen to
[46:46] from the profit but as you start looking
[46:49] at you know some of those things there
[46:51] it just begins to kind of show you or
[46:54] just help you kind of line yourself
[46:56] appropriately with with the events so
[46:59] not only is it 70 70 years since
[47:03] something like this has occurred next
[47:06] year 2018 Israel will be celebrating 70
[47:10] years of being a nation okay and they
[47:15] just receive you know that that status
[47:19] they have been dispersed into so many
[47:22] different nations and lands some of that
[47:25] because of you know some of the things
[47:27] they did that they as they just did not
[47:28] uphold the Word of God they would get
[47:31] dispersed but God would always bring
[47:33] them back while I was there I told y'all
[47:37] about this guard and I went into and
[47:39] this man had a he just got every tree in
[47:43] the in the Bible you know that you could
[47:45] find in fact these trees he put them
[47:47] inside this garden he tells the story
[47:49] about every tree so he had one of the
[47:51] young man say not get up in this tree
[47:53] right here and just just lay there just
[47:55] lay in the tree and he called a group
[47:57] together and said anybody know what tree
[48:00] this is and I looked at I said that's
[48:02] the sycamore tree
[48:04] I ain't ain't seen no sign only sign I
[48:07] saw was the boy laying in a tree and I
[48:09] say this is the sycamore tree and they
[48:12] said okay that's good that's good I say
[48:14] well he said do you know that the
[48:16] sycamore tree is not native to Israel
[48:20] the sycamore tree actually came in from
[48:22] Africa it was transported here he said
[48:25] but why would Jesus you know use allow
[48:31] that to be there and then Zacchaeus to
[48:33] go in the sycamore tree and and then
[48:35] that that story happened according to
[48:37] Scripture why why would it happen like
[48:38] that I don't know he said well the
[48:41] sycamore tree there's something you need
[48:43] to know about it the sycamore tree is a
[48:46] tree that even when you cut it within a
[48:49] certain amount of time it's going to
[48:51] sprout back up and saying and the
[48:55] sycamore tree everything on the tree
[48:56] always goes up or it never goes down
[48:59] when it's everything
[49:00] it just it sprouts up and it should just
[49:02] might take a few years but it's gonna
[49:04] come up again I don't care how low you
[49:06] cut it and he's saying that types Israel
[49:09] because no matter how many times we get
[49:11] displaced from our land we coming back
[49:13] again say where that type de bride - no
[49:18] matter how many times we fall we gonna
[49:20] get back up again so you know we were
[49:24] just you know he was just going over
[49:25] some of those things and you know in 70
[49:28] years 70 years has been for Israel that
[49:34] says they have been accepted as a nation
[49:36] but it was only 50 years ago that they
[49:42] were in a position they they had the
[49:46] Land of Israel but they didn't have
[49:47] Jerusalem so in 1967 there was a war
[49:51] that was fought it was a six-day war and
[49:53] they went and they reclaimed Jerusalem
[49:55] you know but when Israel got Jerusalem
[49:59] it still was not recognized by everybody
[50:01] as their capital not Israel's fighting
[50:04] for this and they got it in six days but
[50:06] but people don't recognize it as a
[50:08] capital you know somebody sent me a
[50:11] quote yesterday where brother branham
[50:12] college ruse in the capital of Israel
[50:14] multiple quotes that their brother
[50:16] ramsley Jerusalem is the capital
[50:17] Jerusalem as their capital right so you
[50:21] know when you start looking at these
[50:22] things and and nobody would with sign
[50:25] this agreement to acknowledge you know
[50:28] Israel
[50:28] I mean Jerusalem as Israel's capital
[50:30] President Trump goes out very bold
[50:32] statement in the face of everything that
[50:35] he's going through but he goes out and
[50:38] he actually says that this is the
[50:40] capital and we want to move our embassy
[50:42] here and I said that was a very very
[50:45] important move you know and very very
[50:48] important move certainly it could
[50:51] trigger some things you know as far as
[50:52] uh prizes and things that nature because
[50:55] there are many actually let me let me do
[50:57] y'all a favor young and I won't have
[51:00] y'all play yeah let's go be seated yeah
[51:02] we'll just give me that picture that I
[51:04] was talking about on Friday night now
[51:06] I'll preach you since we didn't have
[51:08] that many specials I can talk a little
[51:11] bit longer
[51:15] praise the Lord
[51:16] if y'all gave me a little bit more time
[51:18] so I'm I'm grateful I just want you to
[51:20] count understand I've did this on on
[51:22] Friday night now just I won't go through
[51:24] the whole thing but I'll just give you a
[51:25] little bit but just understand what was
[51:30] triggering the up risers or what could
[51:31] trigger the up risers is the vicinity
[51:34] you know Jerusalem is a very very
[51:37] important City to three groups of people
[51:40] it's important to the Israelis of the
[51:44] Jews it's important to the Arabs or
[51:47] Muslims it's also important to
[51:49] Christians all right a very very
[51:52] important city so much has happened
[51:55] there in Jerusalem Jerusalem is where
[51:58] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ that is
[52:02] where he rose again right next to
[52:05] Jerusalem City right next to this
[52:07] Bethlehem that's where he was born right
[52:09] and I mean when I was there going
[52:12] through his life Bethlehem was like
[52:13] going from Riviera Beach to West Palm
[52:15] Beach you know something like that it's
[52:17] very very close but what triggers you
[52:20] know the issues here with with this
[52:23] signing a man of this or this
[52:25] declaration if you can just look on this
[52:28] picture here this is the Western Wall
[52:31] where people go in they pray you know
[52:33] and I showed the pictures some of the
[52:37] brothers that once this thing was
[52:38] announced by the president this whole
[52:40] area was just full
[52:41] people I mean people everywhere just
[52:45] just singing and praising and thanking
[52:47] God before the declaration that was made
[52:49] by President Trump now so this is this
[52:53] is the you know the western wall here
[52:55] this is uh you know just you know pretty
[52:58] much the city of Jerusalem but this
[53:01] particular area is extremely important
[53:05] if just to help you understand this is
[53:09] Mount Moriah if your Bible reader you
[53:13] understand what I just said this is
[53:16] where Abraham brought Isaac right this
[53:19] this is the area this is the area where
[53:22] Christ died just outside the city gates
[53:25] he was outside the city gates this is
[53:27] where Christ died this is where
[53:31] something else we'll talk about today
[53:33] happen and then but the problem is this
[53:38] this Dome of the rock or mosque of Omar
[53:41] is a holy site for Muslim people of
[53:47] Muslim faith and so they don't want to
[53:49] lose this they have Mecca now they do
[53:51] have Mecca right they got that but but
[53:54] Jerusalem mean a lot more to them so
[53:56] that the Muslims would want Jerusalem to
[53:58] be considered that capital but by
[54:01] President Trump said no we gonna call it
[54:03] Israel's capital that was big because
[54:07] now you know there could be an uprise
[54:09] with the Muslims you know against this
[54:11] but I tell you that the Jewish leaders
[54:13] are already kind of saying look now if I
[54:18] can just use modern terms if y'all don't
[54:21] start nothing it won't be nothing right
[54:25] that's that's what he's saying hey
[54:27] saying look we're not Israel I mean
[54:29] we're not we not kicking nobody out of
[54:31] Israel
[54:31] we just wanted to be known that
[54:33] Jerusalem is ours right it's always been
[54:37] ours our prophets we're here our kings
[54:39] were here it's always been ours and now
[54:42] we're so happy that the u.s. is
[54:44] acknowledging that they're the first
[54:45] ones that come out of acknowledge it so
[54:47] he said that's always says that we're
[54:49] not trying to get rid of you know
[54:50] everybody we accept everybody's faith
[54:51] and all that y'all can continue to do
[54:53] what y'all was doing but but we
[54:55] just wants to know the Jerusalem among
[54:56] us right so you know when it comes on it
[54:59] says that they say they'll defend
[55:01] themselves if they need to but what
[55:04] we're praying and this is where the
[55:05] scripture tells us to pray for the Peace
[55:07] of Jerusalem that's in Psalms 122 we
[55:10] want to continue to pray for this area
[55:11] you know but but understand you know the
[55:15] significance of what happened here with
[55:18] President Trump sign that agreement and
[55:20] the other thing that is there's coming a
[55:23] time church where scripture talks tells
[55:25] us that there will be two witnesses that
[55:27] will go back to the Jews and I read the
[55:29] quote on the other night they're gonna
[55:30] get the same message that we got oh my I
[55:34] read on Friday night the Jews are gonna
[55:36] get the same message Oh Lord don't I
[55:38] don't want to go all in there yeah I've
[55:41] just shared a quick testimony that we
[55:43] had a our our our tour guide being
[55:46] Jewish a couple things he did we had a
[55:49] service inside of Garden of Gethsemane
[55:53] first time this man in 37 or 38 trips
[55:57] that brother George is taken the same
[55:59] tour guide first time this man has ever
[56:01] actually sat in on one of the services
[56:03] because him being a Jew he has the
[56:06] service that he attends right so they
[56:08] don't really go to the Christian Church
[56:10] they just they go they do what they do
[56:11] but it's oh brother George don't want to
[56:13] sit in on y'all on y'all discussion and
[56:15] like yeah come on so brother George sit
[56:17] there in the garden because seemingly
[56:18] just kind of going through some things
[56:19] and and he began to share testimony
[56:22] about this this tour guide and the tour
[56:25] guide one thing that happened he said
[56:27] there was a sister that had a dream she
[56:29] saw on the dream a man with white hair
[56:31] and and and as she was looking at this
[56:34] man with white hair you know she
[56:36] couldn't understand what was going on
[56:37] but uh in the dream some kind of way I
[56:39] think either brother branham came to her
[56:41] some kind of way she was told a dream
[56:43] don't worry he's one of us that man
[56:46] don't don't be afraid that man he's one
[56:48] of us so she you know she took that to
[56:50] heart a few months later she ended up in
[56:53] Jerusalem on the tour and she sees the
[56:55] man with white hair that was in her
[56:57] dream it was our tour guy right and when
[56:59] and when she saw him but he's one of us
[57:01] well he's he's Jewish how could it be
[57:04] one of us right but but the but in the
[57:07] dream said don't worry he's
[57:08] one of us well this man that's the tour
[57:12] guide he had been watching the brother
[57:15] George bring these people for years they
[57:17] all coming over there and the way that
[57:19] they dress they look a little different
[57:20] they dress what they call it like the
[57:22] Orthodox Jews you know and baptized in
[57:25] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[57:26] you know like man wasn't what is it
[57:28] about job he just you know kept going
[57:30] kept talking and you know brother George
[57:32] took him back to something because the
[57:33] Jews have a belief that Elijah is gonna
[57:36] come that's day belief they have a meal
[57:39] at their table they do this routinely
[57:42] every household they do this routinely
[57:45] they leave an empty chair and they're at
[57:48] the table and then they'll send the
[57:49] youngest boy to open the front door the
[57:51] house and say now we're under
[57:53] expectation that Elijah don't come sit
[57:55] in that chair and join us for this meal
[57:57] so you go open the door and we'll wait
[57:58] for Elijah and they'll sit the baby
[58:00] doing it for years and still doing it
[58:02] waiting on the Elijah to return the Jews
[58:04] are waiting for Elijah they're waiting
[58:08] for so brother George begin the tongue
[58:10] say now you know how y'all leave that
[58:12] chair and y'all waiting on a larger to
[58:15] come he said yes and what's the
[58:17] difference about us say well you know we
[58:18] have received our Elijah brother brother
[58:21] branham happened to be the Elijah
[58:23] promised according to revelation 10 7
[58:27] Malachi 4 you know various scriptures in
[58:30] Matthew 17 and say he was the Elijah
[58:33] that was promised I say so we have
[58:34] received our Elijah and he came forth
[58:37] with a message and you know and turning
[58:38] our heart back to the faith of the
[58:40] fathers and he said it said another
[58:42] thing is that Elijah happened to be my
[58:43] father-in-law when I ran say oh wow
[58:46] so he said brother Joseph to hear the
[58:48] tape you can listen to it you know from
[58:50] him just you can check it out yourself
[58:51] so the man listening to brother
[58:53] branham's tape and brother Branham just
[58:54] begin to explain some things about
[58:56] Israel just just talking about it on the
[58:58] tape the man heard it and came back to
[59:00] brother Georgia State has this man ever
[59:02] come to Israel they say no not one time
[59:05] he said well he's explaining Israel
[59:08] exactly the way it is he caught it by
[59:11] vision and he begin explaining right and
[59:14] it's in stand and just just just you
[59:16] know sometime the prophets speaking you
[59:18] got to watch it right because sometime
[59:20] he just preached you just thank you
[59:21] preach and that's why you know thank God
[59:23] he know preach that grab his ear to get
[59:26] our attention it's gonna take a little
[59:28] bit more than that right I mean yeah
[59:30] y'all anybody know about grabbing the
[59:32] ear I think I don't lost somebody you
[59:38] know when we come up the preacher when
[59:40] he and he say I feel my health care I'm
[59:42] glad hmm he got a grab well he starts
[59:49] singing that sermon late and they're all
[59:51] everybody get up and see when you start
[59:53] listening to the problem if you grew up
[59:54] in that type of environment and you
[59:57] start listening to the Prophet like oh
[59:58] man that just don't at that that's see
[1:00:01] you is going to church for entertainment
[1:00:03] you want to go on for the word but when
[1:00:08] you start going for the word you stop
[1:00:09] you stop worrying about something Jesus
[1:00:11] didn't have to grab his ear to get his
[1:00:13] point across Jesus just said what he
[1:00:17] needed to say you say a man don't say
[1:00:19] man don't matter right but but you know
[1:00:22] I mean when we went when this man heard
[1:00:24] it he's like he's like yeah this man he
[1:00:26] got to be a prophet the way that he's
[1:00:27] sharing these things so this tour God
[1:00:30] eventually had a situation come up and
[1:00:33] he went here the West Western Wall it
[1:00:36] actually goes underneath you can go
[1:00:39] underneath it like this and walk alone
[1:00:41] and you get down to like this area and
[1:00:44] and on the other side of that would have
[1:00:46] been the holders of Holies so many of
[1:00:48] the Jews would go to that area because
[1:00:50] they can be caught up here cap I mean
[1:00:53] Jews or Christians cannot be caught up
[1:00:55] here only Muslim Muslims can go here you
[1:00:58] go up there you might not come back now
[1:01:00] so they know to stay away from there the
[1:01:04] Jews know that so they go underneath and
[1:01:06] they go right where the homes of holders
[1:01:07] would have been and they would they pray
[1:01:10] right there in that spot so this man you
[1:01:12] know would go here they would offer
[1:01:13] prayers and he had a one of his
[1:01:15] daughters was going through little
[1:01:16] something and then while she was while
[1:01:20] she was while they were at home cream
[1:01:23] the man had a dream and in the dream
[1:01:25] brother branham came to him in the dream
[1:01:27] and and told him certain things you say
[1:01:30] you know how you do this it's gonna be
[1:01:31] all right
[1:01:32] and and he saw brother branham's house
[1:01:34] so he when brother George came a few
[1:01:36] weeks after man had a dream he acts
[1:01:38] brother George what was brother branham
[1:01:40] house slit lang what does this house
[1:01:42] look like he said it looked like this to
[1:01:43] look like that he said I saw the house
[1:01:44] in the dream I saw brother branham he
[1:01:46] told me it's gonna be alright and the
[1:01:49] situation that he was going through with
[1:01:50] this daughter it was alright that man
[1:01:54] said he believed that brother branham
[1:01:57] was a prophet I was I was there on the
[1:01:59] Sea of Galilee and heard the man say it
[1:02:01] I tried to record it but I was too late
[1:02:04] with my camera but I heard him said I
[1:02:06] believe brother Brandon was a prophet
[1:02:07] and we got folk over here
[1:02:15] it just it just blows me away yeah you
[1:02:18] know you you over here try and let the
[1:02:19] Lord help me God
[1:02:21] III mean it just don't make sense and
[1:02:24] some of the things that we use to try to
[1:02:26] prove that he's not a prophet uh you the
[1:02:32] devil can sell you anything I mean come
[1:02:36] on right so it ain't got nothing to do
[1:02:39] it no fair I'm sorry yeah well ii-i've
[1:02:43] gotta take a lot I mean take a stronger
[1:02:45] win than this no they keep me from my
[1:02:48] promises y'all y'all got y'all gonna
[1:02:50] have to y'all got to come up with a lot
[1:02:51] more than that and my question always
[1:02:53] now okay you gonna take the profit from
[1:02:55] it man we know that God say he was
[1:02:57] sitting somebody who is the person you
[1:03:00] even have nobody to give me what you
[1:03:04] gonna take this from me tell you what
[1:03:06] i'ma keep this until that comes so you
[1:03:13] know it's just you know you hear these
[1:03:15] things and and you know just just so
[1:03:17] much it's been prophesied but what
[1:03:19] happened with it being 70 years the key
[1:03:22] thing I want you to get there that 70
[1:03:23] years it's very very critical it was 70
[1:03:26] years of captivity for Israel when they
[1:03:28] were in Babylon and they came out but
[1:03:31] now Dan you and Daniel chapter 9 he
[1:03:34] began to study the time there's a
[1:03:36] countdown that was on and Dan begin the
[1:03:39] study like and what Danny was Dan was
[1:03:40] doing the Bible so he went back to the
[1:03:42] books what books the books of Jeremiah
[1:03:44] he went back to study the Prophet he
[1:03:48] want to know what the Prophet sent oh my
[1:03:51] and we're doing the exact same thing we
[1:03:53] want to know what the prophecy I don't
[1:03:56] want to know what you saying I don't
[1:03:59] want to know if it's just your fault
[1:04:02] keep it but we want to know what the
[1:04:05] prophecy we eat we eat food from heaven
[1:04:11] that's what our diet is right so tell me
[1:04:15] what the prophecy because he has
[1:04:16] understanding of these things glory to
[1:04:19] God Church but you know we were you know
[1:04:21] as Deng was going back to study Jeremiah
[1:04:25] go
[1:04:25] in your line you'll see it all in there
[1:04:27] but he was going to study Jeremiah to
[1:04:29] see you know what she'll be looking for
[1:04:31] you know what the thing is gonna be like
[1:04:33] and as I'm saying this church this this
[1:04:37] this this this decree that was signed
[1:04:40] you know and and this being recognized
[1:04:42] as the capital of Israel is going to
[1:04:45] trigger some things but but the ultimate
[1:04:47] thing is that before God sends the two
[1:04:50] witnesses of Moses Elijah back to the
[1:04:53] Jews the Gentiles must be caught away in
[1:04:57] a rapture so if this is the beginning of
[1:05:02] it if this is the beginning my question
[1:05:06] is where are we and if we're that close
[1:05:09] how should we be acting what should be
[1:05:14] our response and and the thing that
[1:05:16] moves me the most when you really go
[1:05:18] back and look at Daniel as he begin to
[1:05:20] see things happen brother man of singing
[1:05:22] with that year 68 year 69 year 70 Daniel
[1:05:26] began to enter get into a place of
[1:05:29] Prayer oh my god now you see why the
[1:05:32] prayer beans are so important and and
[1:05:34] the thing that he began to in turn to
[1:05:35] prayer not only did Daniel do that but
[1:05:37] but uh Abraham when he recognized
[1:05:40] destruction was coming to southern
[1:05:42] Gomorrah Abraham began to intercede so
[1:05:47] so so so what should be happening now
[1:05:49] the prevenir should be the most cool
[1:05:51] service there is when I'm talking about
[1:05:57] when you really got an understanding of
[1:05:59] what's going on right now it's the demos
[1:06:03] job to get your eyes off of what God is
[1:06:06] doing and he'll use anything here use
[1:06:12] anything family issues sharp issues you
[1:06:16] name it the devil will use it that keep
[1:06:19] your attention off of what God is doing
[1:06:23] you have to fight you have to fight
[1:06:30] but I tell you what I'm doing everything
[1:06:32] I can
[1:06:33] my brother branham said in the quote he
[1:06:35] say you know Daniel began to pray and he
[1:06:39] begin to confess his faults in the
[1:06:41] people's faults and just get themself
[1:06:42] prepared for the return of the Jews
[1:06:44] we're trying to get the people prepared
[1:06:46] for the return of our Lord and and we
[1:06:50] got to be ready Church if there's ever a
[1:06:53] time this is a time that you do not get
[1:06:56] your lines tangled up the Prophet said
[1:07:00] that please don't get your lives tangled
[1:07:02] up in times like these don't do it it's
[1:07:08] difficult it's too close to the coming
[1:07:10] of the Lord so I just want you to
[1:07:12] understand it was very significant I
[1:07:15] can't go through all of that paid man
[1:07:17] today we'll put the tape out there so
[1:07:20] you can go and listen to it and and and
[1:07:22] and if I could just say this don't be a
[1:07:27] lazy Christian lazy Christian wait for
[1:07:31] the tape to go up and they try to catch
[1:07:33] up don't do that if you can make it to
[1:07:37] church you need to be in church it
[1:07:39] should be a it should be abnormal when

[1:12:02] and read it to you and hopefully that
[1:12:06] would just be enough to give us a a
[1:12:08] background here on second Samuel 24
[1:12:17] we'll start at verse 1 says this and
[1:12:24] again the anger of the Lord was kindled
[1:12:26] against Israel and he moved David
[1:12:29] against them to say go number Israel and
[1:12:32] Judah for the king said to Joab the
[1:12:36] captain of the hosts which was with him
[1:12:38] to go now through all the tribes of
[1:12:41] Israel from Dan even to bear Sheba and
[1:12:43] number ye the people that I may know the
[1:12:46] number of the
[1:12:49] and Joab said unto the king now the LORD
[1:12:52] thy God Adam to the people how many so
[1:12:57] ever they'd be a hundredfold and that
[1:13:00] the eyes of the Lord the King may see it
[1:13:02] but why does my lord the King delight
[1:13:05] and this thing and those that's a key
[1:13:08] word that he David is delighting and a
[1:13:11] number of the people that's that's very
[1:13:13] critical here it says verse 4
[1:13:17] notwithstanding the Kings were prevailed
[1:13:19] against Joab and against the captains of
[1:13:21] the hosts and Joab and the captains of
[1:13:24] the hosts went out from the presence of
[1:13:25] the king to number the people of Israel
[1:13:28] I'm skipping over to verse 9 a man says
[1:13:34] and Joab gave up the sum of the number
[1:13:38] of the people unto the king and there
[1:13:40] were in Israel 800,000 diet man that
[1:13:42] drew the sword and the men of Judah were
[1:13:44] five hundred thousand men and Davis
[1:13:47] heart smote him after that he had
[1:13:49] numbered the people and David said unto
[1:13:51] the Lord I have sinned greatly and that
[1:13:54] I have done and and now I beseech thee O
[1:13:58] Lord take away the iniquity of that
[1:13:59] servant for I have done very foolishly
[1:14:01] for when David was up in the morning the
[1:14:04] word of the Lord came unto the Prophet
[1:14:06] guy David see you're saying going saying
[1:14:08] the David thus saith the Lord I offer
[1:14:09] the three things choose the one of them
[1:14:12] that I may do it unto thee so God came
[1:14:14] to David and told him and said unto him
[1:14:16] shall seven years of famine come into
[1:14:18] unto thee and thy land are worth
[1:14:21] doubtfully three months before thine
[1:14:22] enemies will Wow while they pursue they
[1:14:25] pursued thee or that there be three days
[1:14:28] a pestilence in thy land now advised and
[1:14:32] see what answer I shall return to him
[1:14:34] that sent me and David said unto God I
[1:14:37] am in a great straight let us fall now
[1:14:40] into the hand of the Lord for His
[1:14:42] mercies are great and let me not fall
[1:14:44] into the hand of man so low so the Lord
[1:14:48] sent a pestilence upon Israel from the
[1:14:51] morning even to the time appointed and
[1:14:53] their died of the people for
[1:14:55] then even to bear Sheva 70,000 men and
[1:14:59] when the Angels stretched out his hand
[1:15:00] upon Jerusalem to destroy it the Lord
[1:15:04] repented him of the evil and said to the
[1:15:06] angel that destroyed the people it is
[1:15:09] enough staying out on hand and the angel
[1:15:12] the Lord was buy the threshing place of
[1:15:14] Aruna the Jebusite and David's bacon to
[1:15:18] the Lord when he saw the angel that
[1:15:20] smote the people and said lo I have
[1:15:23] sinned and I have done wickedly but
[1:15:25] these sheep what have they done let down
[1:15:28] hand I pray thee be against me and
[1:15:30] against my father's house and GAD came
[1:15:32] that day to David and said to him go up
[1:15:35] rear and altar unto the Lord in the
[1:15:37] threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite
[1:15:40] and I'm skipping over to verse 22 says
[1:15:45] and aruna said in a David let my lord
[1:15:49] the king take and offer up what seemeth
[1:15:51] good unto him the whole here the oxen
[1:15:55] for burnt sacrifice and threshing
[1:15:56] instruments and other instruments of the
[1:15:58] Oxford for wood all these things did
[1:16:01] Aruna as a king give unto the king and a
[1:16:05] ruler said unto the king and the Lord
[1:16:06] that God accept thee and and the King
[1:16:08] said unto Aruna nay but I will surely
[1:16:11] buy it of the at a price and neither
[1:16:14] will I offer burnt offerings unto the
[1:16:16] Lord my god of that which doth cost me
[1:16:19] nothing so David bought the threshing
[1:16:21] floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of
[1:16:24] silver and David built there an altar
[1:16:26] unto the Lord and offered burnt
[1:16:27] offerings and peace offerings so the
[1:16:29] what was entreated for them for the land
[1:16:31] and the plague was state from Israel the
[1:16:34] Lord had a blessing to the reading of
[1:16:35] his word let's just bow in a brief word
[1:16:37] of Prayer thank you God for the ability
[1:16:41] to read the scripture thank you God that
[1:16:45] the Holy Spirit comes to also give us
[1:16:47] enlightenment on the things that we've
[1:16:50] read so we pray God that as you have
[1:16:52] been a part of our worship now God
[1:16:54] you'll be a part of this going forth of
[1:16:56] your word continue to quicken
[1:16:58] understanding the revelation to our
[1:17:00] hearts the Bible tells us that the gates
[1:17:03] of hell won't prevail against the
[1:17:05] revelation that's in our hearts O God
[1:17:06] help us to have
[1:17:07] we if revelations beyond the ship
[1:17:09] prophet told us to look up and to ask
[1:17:11] you for so god I prayed it should help
[1:17:13] us to see things that we need to see
[1:17:15] today forgive us of every sin every
[1:17:17] shortcoming look beyond every fall to
[1:17:18] see every need may we got pushed to the
[1:17:21] side the issues that we're dealing with
[1:17:22] all that matters now is going into the
[1:17:25] presence of God and receiving from him
[1:17:27] so it's the devil's job to try to
[1:17:29] sidetrack us and do all these other
[1:17:31] things but help us to keep our attention
[1:17:33] on thee
[1:17:34] if Peter would have kept his attention
[1:17:36] on him on you he would have kept walking
[1:17:38] but Lord so help us father not to sink
[1:17:41] but going to keep our eyes on the in
[1:17:43] Jesus name we pray amen amen
[1:17:46] god bless you can be seated in the
[1:17:48] presence of the Lord we will continue
[1:17:51] our journey a man
[1:17:53] it happened at Calvary a man this is
[1:17:56] part three of our journey here and I'm
[1:17:59] kind of going back into some statements
[1:18:03] that I made last week and then we'll go
[1:18:05] forward I want to read just two quotes
[1:18:08] that go along with some of the
[1:18:10] statements that I made last week here
[1:18:12] from the message why it had to be
[1:18:14] Shepherd why it had to be Shepherd the
[1:18:18] Prophet makes a man of this this
[1:18:20] statement says when those seven
[1:18:22] mysteries back through those seven
[1:18:25] churches there were seven hidden
[1:18:28] mysteries said I'm right in the book of
[1:18:30] it and a great theologian said to me not
[1:18:33] long ago said brother Branham see how
[1:18:35] Satan will try to jerk you off the road
[1:18:38] you said brother Branham you know what I
[1:18:40] believe the Lord will reveal to you what
[1:18:43] we're to do next is it he says it'll be
[1:18:47] some great secret that's hid in under
[1:18:49] the under these seven seals I said no
[1:18:51] that isn't it brother he said it'll be
[1:18:53] something that's not even written in the
[1:18:56] word it sounds so spiritual it'll be
[1:18:59] something that's that that's that's not
[1:19:01] even written in the word I said no no
[1:19:03] you forgive whosoever shall add one word
[1:19:06] or take one word away see it's already
[1:19:09] in there but the Reformers has failed to
[1:19:12] see it they didn't live long enough to
[1:19:14] see it and the ages is over now we're
[1:19:18] right here at Laodicea and remember
[1:19:21] the latest year age he was on the
[1:19:23] outside of the church
[1:19:25] knocking trying to get back in Eve had
[1:19:29] put her Adam out like that Eve had put
[1:19:32] her Adam out god help us
[1:19:35] let us go beyond the camp to find him
[1:19:38] let us suffer without the gates with him
[1:19:40] let us go to him in his death in his
[1:19:44] burial and in his resurrection for he's
[1:19:46] the same yesterday today and forever and
[1:19:49] we were using Amen description last week
[1:19:52] Hebrews 13 verse 11 through 13 where it
[1:19:56] says for the bodies of those beasts
[1:19:58] whose blood is brought into the
[1:20:00] sanctuary by the high priest for sin are
[1:20:03] burned without the camp wherefore jesus
[1:20:07] also that he might sanctify the people
[1:20:10] with his own blood suffered without the
[1:20:13] gate so you know the scripture tells us
[1:20:16] very plainly when they were offering
[1:20:17] that burnt offering the burnt offering
[1:20:19] had to be given outside of the camp
[1:20:22] outside of the gate so when I when I was
[1:20:24] telling you all along that it was
[1:20:27] certainly the same heel but not the
[1:20:29] exact same spot where Isaac was offered
[1:20:31] and where Jesus was offered Jesus had to
[1:20:33] be offered outside the camp Amen in
[1:20:36] order to fulfill other scriptures right
[1:20:38] so he was outside the camp as a whole
[1:20:41] burnt offering for our sins and verse 13
[1:20:44] and Hebrews 13 says let us go therefore
[1:20:48] unto him without the camp bearing his
[1:20:52] reproach a man we got to go unto him
[1:20:55] outside the camp bearing his reproach
[1:20:58] and imma just tell you something to be a
[1:21:00] message believe in this hour
[1:21:02] it's almost a reproach Amen amongst them
[1:21:05] it's a reproach but for God amen it's
[1:21:08] the glorious thing that he got some
[1:21:10] people that will follow his word amen
[1:21:13] glory to God so let me read something
[1:21:15] here this message going beyond the camp
[1:21:17] he says we are invited to go beyond that
[1:21:21] camp Jesus also that he might sanctify
[1:21:23] the people with his own blood suffered
[1:21:26] without the gate let us go beyond let us
[1:21:30] go to him beyond the gate watch bearing
[1:21:34] his reproach
[1:21:36] what was he reproachful not because he
[1:21:38] was a Methodists or Baptists I'll assure
[1:21:41] you that not because he was there a
[1:21:44] theist a Jassi because he was the
[1:21:46] vindicated words a man that's the
[1:21:49] reproach because he was the vindicated
[1:21:51] word bearing his reproach for what the
[1:21:54] vindicated word that's right that's what
[1:21:56] he did he said if I do not the works of
[1:22:00] my father don't believe me if I'm not
[1:22:03] the answer to all the scripture
[1:22:04] questions says Jesus and I love this
[1:22:07] brother Solomon just said it here this
[1:22:09] morning Jesus of the New Testament was
[1:22:12] Jehovah of the Old Glory got exactly
[1:22:16] right I believe as I was telling you
[1:22:18] here now some time ago uh somewhere in a
[1:22:21] meeting it might not have been here
[1:22:23] Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of
[1:22:26] the new said when I was us going
[1:22:29] squirrel hunting that morning and there
[1:22:31] it was them three big stems running to
[1:22:33] run into one out there right on the
[1:22:36] mountain me standing there looking at it
[1:22:38] and I drew up close and took off my hat
[1:22:40] lay down my right but got up there and a
[1:22:43] voice shook the woods that Jesus of the
[1:22:45] New Testament it's Joe who love the old
[1:22:48] remain faithful and if I could just tell
[1:22:51] you to do the same this morning remain
[1:22:53] faithful I don't care what you're going
[1:22:56] through Church just remain faithful

[1:23:18] it that's right it's the truth
[1:23:19] it's right down to Kentucky and there's
[1:23:22] people sitting right here tonight was
[1:23:24] present when it happened again the same
[1:23:26] thing yes we know it's the truth Jesus
[1:23:29] of the Old Testament
[1:23:30] now he's explaining the situation there
[1:23:32] where you know brother Branham was out

[1:23:37] hunting the squirrels and he could not
[1:23:38] find him he couldn't couldn't couldn't

[1:24:34] shot it dropped it picked it up and said
[1:24:36] man this he say this came to a vision
[1:24:38] because visions don't bleed they say he

[1:24:52] one to do it like this like that like
[1:24:53] that and i'ma shoot it over there that
[1:24:55] squirrel come up shot it Wham
[1:24:57] so he he say Lord we said man this is
[1:25:00] just really something I said I ain't
[1:25:01] never had no experience like this before
[1:25:03] and he saw the two squirrels and you
[1:25:06] know didn't say ok where you want to
[1:25:07] throw it with that he said how you want
[1:25:08] the third one well it didn't come in the
[1:25:10] time that he thought it should come so
[1:25:12] he got the two and say lord I thank you
[1:25:14] but my to squirty begin the walk away
[1:25:15] say no no no no no no no no no no you
[1:25:17] said three and if you said three you got
[1:25:20] to sit down wait on the third one so
[1:25:22] here you know why he's sitting there
[1:25:23] waiting that third one finally shows up
[1:25:25] and he shoots it and and when it and
[1:25:27] when he when he shot it I believe he
[1:25:29] went to go find it and confined it right
[1:25:31] and and then he had some you know some
[1:25:33] some situations there where he went back
[1:25:35] to the camp and begin to share it with
[1:25:36] the brethren share the testimony and one
[1:25:38] of the brothers you know he prayed that
[1:25:41] night before they went to bed and the
[1:25:42] brother prayed a prayer and his pray
[1:25:43] saying Lord ain't brother branham
[1:25:46] telling the truth then let him find the
[1:25:48] third squirt let him find the squirt
[1:25:50] amount and brother branham went to bed
[1:25:51] with a mind battle he said I just shared
[1:25:54] poured out my heart and and this man
[1:25:56] know that I've never told him anything
[1:25:58] wrong why would he say if I'm telling
[1:26:01] him
[1:26:02] why would he say something like that so
[1:26:04] he said he said he said just he couldn't
[1:26:06] understand why the brother said that but
[1:26:08] it wasn't fun for everyone for the man
[1:26:09] him some brother branham let's see if he
[1:26:11] was gonna doubt in his heart so the next
[1:26:13] morning he went out there and he's like
[1:26:14] lord I don't know why I said that and it
[1:26:16] came back to him again stay now you
[1:26:17] speak where it's gonna be and when he
[1:26:20] spoke there that squirrel was sitting
[1:26:22] right there you know where it where it
[1:26:23] was supposed to be you know and he found
[1:26:25] the squirrel but also in that same spot
[1:26:27] brother Branham said that's where it was
[1:26:29] revealed to him in that same area that's
[1:26:31] where we revealed to him that Jesus of
[1:26:34] the New Testament was Jehovah of the old
[1:26:37] what that did was just start
[1:26:39] discrediting truth Trinitarian teaches
[1:26:41] amen it made us understand that Jesus
[1:26:44] was not just the Son of God Jesus was
[1:26:48] God that oh my lord I just love saying
[1:26:52] it you know that's why I when people
[1:26:55] just you know that the church has been
[1:26:56] so hooked on telling the story how God
[1:26:58] so loved the world that He gave His only
[1:27:00] begotten Son I said no no one this God
[1:27:03] gave his son don't stop right there let
[1:27:05] him know that God became the time and I
[1:27:09] was there twelve Chancellor's that right
[1:27:10] so you know but we had to get that type
[1:27:13] of that type of teacher that Jesus of
[1:27:15] the New Testament was Jehovah the old
[1:27:18] and you know what to accept that type of
[1:27:20] teaching today you're gonna have to go
[1:27:21] beyond the campus you got to go outside
[1:27:24] the camp and you got the better approach
[1:27:26] of this word hallelujah I'm willing to
[1:27:29] bear the reproach of this word you're
[1:27:31] gonna be criticized you're gonna be
[1:27:33] looked down upon a man you gonna have to
[1:27:36] go through some serious things in order
[1:27:37] to hold true to this word but let me
[1:27:40] tell you something your Lord and Savior
[1:27:41] went through a lot more than you'll ever
[1:27:43] have to go through a man and he did it
[1:27:45] outside of the camp all right all right
[1:27:48] all right let's not let's keep going
[1:27:49] here a man today praise the Lord praise
[1:27:54] the Lord praise the Lord all right I
[1:27:56] want to go here to this message the
[1:27:58] revelation of Jesus Christ I want to
[1:28:00] kind of shift gears here a little bit a
[1:28:02] man and bring us into some something
[1:28:06] else it all happened at Calvary a man it
[1:28:09] all happened at Calvary glory to God we
[1:28:12] we have brought to your attention over
[1:28:14] the last
[1:28:15] weeks how Abraham offered Isaac Amen on
[1:28:19] Mount Moriah and Mount Moriah happened
[1:28:21] to be the same he'll wear or same
[1:28:24] vicinity the same he'll brother branham
[1:28:27] say ah the same Hill that Isaac walked
[1:28:29] up was the same Hill that Jesus walked
[1:28:31] up right
[1:28:32] and Barrett carrying that would the same
[1:28:34] Hill so you know Jesus was offered in
[1:28:37] the same spot that Isaac was about to be
[1:28:39] offered a man we also told you how when
[1:28:42] when Jesus was offered outside the camp
[1:28:44] it was a place called Golgotha which
[1:28:47] meant a heap of skulls right Calvary
[1:28:50] meant the place of skull right and and
[1:28:53] here he's dying in this place and there
[1:28:55] were some skulls buried there Alleluia
[1:28:58] and not hurt brothers talk about how
[1:29:00] Goliath skull was buried there not thank
[1:29:02] God for that but Goliath was not
[1:29:04] redeemable so I appreciate that but he
[1:29:10] wasn't redeemable butBut when I found
[1:29:12] out and brother branham told us you know
[1:29:14] he was there reading a book and you know
[1:29:17] when I found out that not only was he
[1:29:19] said there were many discussive but the
[1:29:21] main skull that happened to be there was
[1:29:23] a skull of Adam that was there at the
[1:29:26] place of skulls Shem brings it through
[1:29:29] the art and places it there at Moriah at
[1:29:32] Calvary at Golgotha
[1:29:35] so here the second Adam dies in the same
[1:29:38] spot that the first Adam is buried sure
[1:29:41] that Redemption had been completed what
[1:29:45] Adam failed to do in the beginner it was
[1:29:48] it's ok Adam we not hold against you
[1:29:50] Jesus Christ had completed it he did it
[1:29:53] all at Calvary see I mean that
[1:29:56] everything everything means something
[1:30:00] everything every word means something
[1:30:04] you know even in the Bible their names

[1:31:03] together you got to know what them names
[1:31:05] mean come on somebody I mean they're
[1:31:09] spirits that go along with the name all
[1:31:12] right all right all right so you know
[1:31:14] here you know we're just trying to bring
[1:31:16] out how you know these various things
[1:31:17] that happen at Calvary and now we want
[1:31:20] to just go a little further here today
[1:31:22] if we can this message here the
[1:31:25] revelation of Jesus Christ the Prophet
[1:31:27] makes the statement it says oh if you
[1:31:32] can only any man can see the spiritual
[1:31:34] application of the scriptures and could
[1:31:36] say that they wasn't inspired your your
[1:31:40] very action the very mode of the very
[1:31:42] objectives of the people why it proves
[1:31:45] that the scripture is inspired to see
[1:31:48] how God applies those things just just
[1:31:52] what you do here's a type of something
[1:31:54] since like Abraham offering up Isaac his
[1:31:57] only son a type of God giving his son
[1:32:00] hundreds of years later how that Joseph
[1:32:04] was sold and in prison hated of his
[1:32:07] brothers and loved it loved of his
[1:32:09] father Jesus in type how the Spirit
[1:32:12] worked through Joseph a man and simply
[1:32:14] typed the life of Christ perfectly how
[1:32:17] David the son of David sent on the same
[1:32:19] mountain when Dave was rejected as king
[1:32:23] and went up over the hill Mount of
[1:32:25] Olives looking back we can as a rejected
[1:32:28] King a few hundred years after that the
[1:32:32] son of David climb the stain he
[1:32:35] as a rejected king and wept over
[1:32:39] Jerusalem the spirit in tight inform and
[1:32:43] when you have the opportunity you know
[1:32:45] to go and I'm speaking of some of my
[1:32:46] whole congregation when you have the
[1:32:48] opportunity to go to Israel you'll see
[1:32:51] how close the Mount of Olives was to
[1:32:53] Mount Calvary you'll see how close a man
[1:32:57] these things were so when you when you
[1:32:59] read or you hear that a brother and I'm
[1:33:01] talking about that it just begins to it
[1:33:02] begins to make a little bit more sense
[1:33:04] to you
[1:33:05] David was a perfect type of Christ there
[1:33:08] were some other things that brother
[1:33:09] branham said you know he said did you
[1:33:11] notice one time there was a bear run in
[1:33:14] and got one of his sheep and he killed
[1:33:16] that bear and a lion running and got one
[1:33:19] and he caught the lion by the beard and
[1:33:21] took a knife and kill that lion see it
[1:33:23] was sacrifice sacrificing for his sheep
[1:33:27] David being a shepherd was sacrificing
[1:33:30] his life for his sheep a man he was
[1:33:33] willing to go against a bear he was
[1:33:36] willing a men that go against the lion
[1:33:38] what I'm trying to say is David was
[1:33:40] willing to put his life on the line
[1:33:41] oh my god David David David knew he had
[1:33:45] been taught by his father that it's a
[1:33:48] shame for a shepherd to lose a sheep so
[1:33:52] as a young boy he that was instilled in
[1:33:55] in his day I'm not gonna let her land
[1:33:57] get one of these sheep I'm not gonna let
[1:33:59] a bear get one of these sheep and I
[1:34:01] can't remember exactly where this but
[1:34:03] I've know in Scripture what I want one
[1:34:05] of the Old Testament scripture say even
[1:34:07] if the lion got ahold of one achievement
[1:34:10] of all that Shepherd to do is bring back
[1:34:12] their ear he was gonna fight just to get
[1:34:16] the ear of the sheep back put his life
[1:34:19] in danger for the Sheep if that's not a
[1:34:23] perfect type of Christ because he went
[1:34:25] to a cross so put his life on the line
[1:34:29] the sheik and he is the chief shepherd
[1:34:33] of our souls thank you Jesus he says he
[1:34:37] was a sacrificing for a sheep and if he
[1:34:40] was willing to lay his life down for the
[1:34:42] Sheep he was a type of the good shepherd
[1:34:45] brother branham also says look at David
[1:34:48] the son of David Christ was the son of
[1:34:51] David Christ in David hated despised
[1:34:54] rejected of his own people the throne
[1:34:56] went up over the mountain looking back
[1:34:59] weeping because his own even beloved
[1:35:02] children that turned on him down and he
[1:35:04] thrown him says and he wept over
[1:35:06] Jerusalem as he went up now it was the
[1:35:09] Jews that Yael crucify him crucify him
[1:35:13] you know let his blood be on us and on
[1:35:15] our children they yelled that but now
[1:35:17] and for them to do that God had to
[1:35:19] intentionally blind them so that they
[1:35:23] were not recognized - Messiah was God
[1:35:25] had to intentionally blind them and by
[1:35:27] intentionally blinding them that gave
[1:35:28] the Gentiles we are the Gentiles that
[1:35:30] gave us an opportunity to understand who
[1:35:32] Christ was praise a look but there's
[1:35:34] coming a time where the Jews are going
[1:35:37] to hear the same lessons that you hear
[1:35:39] right now and they're gonna very hearts
[1:35:41] are gonna be open to receive who Christ
[1:35:43] was and you know the Bible say that
[1:35:45] they'll actually questions of where you
[1:35:46] get their wolves in they say in the
[1:35:48] house of my friends and they're gonna
[1:35:50] realize the very Messiah that they've
[1:35:52] been praying for looking for all these
[1:35:54] years that already come and they
[1:35:55] crucified there on the side say they'll
[1:35:57] go what the Bible said I'll go into
[1:35:58] mourning before that happens the bride
[1:36:01] has it get ready for a rapture look at
[1:36:06] it it says the son of David setting on
[1:36:08] mountain Olives rejected by his own
[1:36:09] beloved and set up their weeping over
[1:36:11] Jerusalem said how off would I have
[1:36:13] hovered over you as the hen does her
[1:36:15] brood but you have not now i'ma read
[1:36:19] something here out of a wild little
[1:36:20] Bethlehem just showing how David was a
[1:36:22] perfect tight amen on the Lord Jesus
[1:36:25] wild little Bethlehem's that David here
[1:36:27] is a type of Christ Bethlehem because
[1:36:29] christ is david's son here he's standing
[1:36:32] there crying for a drink of that water
[1:36:34] and his desire was a command his desire
[1:36:37] davis desire you understand davis desire
[1:36:41] was a command
[1:36:42] if Davis desire was a command what about
[1:36:45] God's desire it should be a command to
[1:36:47] us right his desire was a command I sent
[1:36:51] to those who loved him three of those
[1:36:53] men pulled their swarms in 15 miles all
[1:36:56] David when it was just was just water
[1:36:58] from a particular whale and because he
[1:37:00] actually spoke his desire men fought
[1:37:03] through the Philistines that go get
[1:37:06] David just a cup of water from that from
[1:37:09] that from that we'll just test a little
[1:37:11] water from that way we're gonna bring
[1:37:13] this today I mean it looked and seemed
[1:37:14] like any water would have satisfied but
[1:37:17] David said he wanted from a particular
[1:37:18] place in those men they threw in lies
[1:37:22] down in order to bring that water to
[1:37:24] leave it look at it he says it was
[1:37:27] desire his desire was in command I said
[1:37:29] to those who loved him three of those
[1:37:30] men pull their swords and fought 15
[1:37:32] miles of men down to that city while
[1:37:35] others fought keeping their men were
[1:37:37] gallant fighting men those Philistines
[1:37:40] twice their size some of them but they
[1:37:43] were men gallant who could fight one of
[1:37:45] them slew still stood alone handed and
[1:37:48] killed eight hundred men right around
[1:37:49] him in one day
[1:37:50] they were great men they trusted God
[1:37:53] they had faith in their leader and they
[1:37:56] cut his way down through down through
[1:38:00] until while some of them some of them
[1:38:02] cut and the other one got a bucket of
[1:38:04] water and they cut their way back
[1:38:06] through another 15 miles of men and
[1:38:08] brought that up to David so he could
[1:38:10] drink it now David didn't know that they
[1:38:13] were doing that now the other thing
[1:38:16] about David wants to gots the water and
[1:38:17] realize that these men at play took
[1:38:19] their took their lives in our hands
[1:38:20] David just pour the water out as a drink
[1:38:22] offering to God so that I can't drink
[1:38:25] this
[1:38:25] I mean these men have laid their lives
[1:38:27] down just to me so I came I gotta I just
[1:38:29] gotta just pour this out to God as a
[1:38:31] drink offer right and look at this
[1:38:33] says here Christ is represented here in
[1:38:35] this both King and warrior because he
[1:38:38] cut his way through he broke the enemy's
[1:38:40] lines of death he broke the enemy's
[1:38:43] lines that will we might have eternal
[1:38:46] life the waters of eternal life he come
[1:38:49] through even to death and took death
[1:38:51] upon himself and died the death and come
[1:38:54] back
[1:38:55] we might have eternal life he's both
[1:38:57] King and warrior
[1:38:58] we didn't conquer it's already conquered
[1:39:01] we never conquer death he conquered
[1:39:04] death forest he is our David of this day
[1:39:07] he conquered death Bethlehem's bread and
[1:39:10] water we thank God for that what our
[1:39:13] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ did for us
[1:39:16] he had to conquer death for us see the
[1:39:19] last enemy that had to be destroyed was
[1:39:22] death but that was the last enemy that
[1:39:25] had to be destroyed and and now it's
[1:39:27] believers you know we don't even fear
[1:39:29] death because of what Christ did at
[1:39:31] Calvary a man that lasts intimate is
[1:39:34] gonna be on our feet was death now we
[1:39:36] look at death of different ways
[1:39:37] believers we call death the Buckey and
[1:39:41] and it's the budget that actually pulls
[1:39:43] us into the presence of Almighty God
[1:39:45] hallelujah Church time I'm excited about
[1:39:48] that I thank God for it let's look at
[1:39:50] this you know Jesus a man was the one
[1:39:53] he's out David for today he conquered
[1:39:55] death a man he's the one that did that
[1:39:57] he's both King and warrior now there was
[1:40:00] a time where Jesus was debating on
[1:40:06] whether to take the route of death that
[1:40:09] was in the Garden of Gethsemane now I
[1:40:10] want to pick up something I want to go
[1:40:12] back they man to our scripture and but
[1:40:15] we're at 2nd of Samuel 24 but we're
[1:40:19] going to pick this up in first
[1:40:20] chronicles 21 so stay with me here now I
[1:40:24] want to say this ahead of time for my
[1:40:29] Bible readers I got if I got any Bible
[1:40:33] readers in the house all right but my
[1:40:35] Bible readers that in the house if you
[1:40:39] were to read 2nd Samuel 24 and you were
[1:40:42] to read 1st chronicles 21 you would find
[1:40:46] multiple multiple discrepancies
[1:40:56] I wanna I want to just make it very
[1:41:00] clear because that way you know if you
[1:41:02] if you to read it you come back brother
[1:41:04] Jack why I say this is why I say that
[1:41:05] I'm letting you know ahead of time
[1:41:07] before you read it you will find
[1:41:09] multiple discrepancies now here is my
[1:41:12] faith regardless of the discrepancies
[1:41:15] Amen I still believe the word and if I
[1:41:21] can do that with the Bible no matter
[1:41:25] what you find in this message I still
[1:41:29] believe it oh my God my God my God my
[1:41:33] God all right just stay with me here
[1:41:35] we're gonna pick this up and and the
[1:41:38] first chronicles 21 and I just want to
[1:41:42] bring out a couple things to you we can
[1:41:45] today
[1:41:51] thank you Jesus
[1:41:55] just pick this up the first round says
[1:41:58] I'm gonna go to verse 18 I'll leave it
[1:42:01] for you to read the rest of it but verse
[1:42:04] 18 is where where I want to read from it
[1:42:12] says that then then the angel of the
[1:42:15] lord commanded
[1:42:16] gat to say to David that David should go
[1:42:19] up and set up an altar unto the Lord and
[1:42:21] the threshing floor Ford and the
[1:42:24] jebusite and and David went up at the
[1:42:30] saying of gat which he's fake in the
[1:42:31] name of the Lord and Orrin and turned
[1:42:34] back and saw the angel and his four sons
[1:42:36] with him hit him hit themselves now
[1:42:40] Orrin an was threshing wheat now let me
[1:42:47] just kind of break in here a little bit
[1:42:49] there here and there as we're just kind
[1:42:53] of picking up this I want I want to give
[1:42:55] you just a couple things if I can before
[1:42:59] I go further I'm stopping at verse 20
[1:43:01] just remind me that I'll come back to it
[1:43:03] if I could why you're why you are there
[1:43:08] at a man first Chronicles twin just go
[1:43:12] to the first verse and I want you to
[1:43:14] just notice something here Wow while
[1:43:17] we're there while we are there because
[1:43:22] when I read for you second Samuel 24 and
[1:43:25] one it said and again the anger of the
[1:43:28] Lord was kindled against Israel and he
[1:43:31] moved David against them to say go to
[1:43:34] number Israel and Judah now let's look
[1:43:37] at first guarana khals chapter 21 verse
[1:43:40] 1 it says and Satan stood up against
[1:43:43] Israel and provoked David to number
[1:43:47] Israel now wait a minute wait a minute
[1:43:48] wait a minute I Steve discrepancy here
[1:43:51] all right because first kilometers
[1:43:54] telling me that Satan did this amen but
[1:43:56] but but in second Samet 24/7 God did
[1:44:00] this we gotta try to make these things
[1:44:02] make sense now you know I'm just looking
[1:44:05] at a little note here amen
[1:44:07] Bob and I love the way they put this set
[1:44:09] in every vent and every vent garden
[1:44:13] Satan are often involved in everything
[1:44:15] oh my god and every in the same event
[1:44:19] you got both God and the devil involved
[1:44:22] in it me Jesus amen I don't care what it
[1:44:27] is that you're going through you go find
[1:44:29] both opposing forces in the same events
[1:44:35] do you understand whether women wear
[1:44:38] this up let us get the job you go find
[1:44:40] the God and the devil right there miss
[1:44:42] to the top
[1:44:43] hello somebody God could be making a way
[1:44:46] by the devil will try to get in there
[1:44:48] somehow unless that thing up
[1:44:50] relationships God and the devil you name
[1:44:56] it whatever it is you gonna find them Bo
[1:44:59] let me just give you like what the
[1:45:01] Indian chief says Whitman is warning us
[1:45:07] since they see see see see see you know
[1:45:10] brother and I will talk about the Indian
[1:45:12] chief and the Indian chief was you know
[1:45:13] was there had just become a Christian
[1:45:15] now God is involved in saving the man
[1:45:18] you can see God saving the man but the
[1:45:21] devil is never try that man salvation
[1:45:25] say you know say uh say say chief how
[1:45:28] you getting along and they say uh pretty
[1:45:31] bad pretty good say pretty bad pretty
[1:45:36] good what kind of answers that seems I
[1:45:38] can't say yet pretty bad pretty good he
[1:45:39] said well could you break it down a
[1:45:40] little bit move on me I believe it was a
[1:45:42] missionary talking to the Indian chief
[1:45:45] and he was sharing his story over
[1:45:46] brother branham he's the same say you
[1:45:48] say pretty bad pretty good he said he
[1:45:49] said well help me understand a little
[1:45:51] bit more he says like Oh one shoulder I
[1:45:54] got a white dog and then on the other
[1:45:56] shoulder I got a black dog then he said
[1:45:59] both dogs are just talking to me all the
[1:46:00] time so sorry they say they say well I
[1:46:03] thought they say cheaper which which one
[1:46:05] of the dogs win cheap which which one
[1:46:07] other which which which dog is winning
[1:46:10] in your life is it is it the white dog
[1:46:13] that a black dog if they say said well
[1:46:16] the one that's winning is that it
[1:46:17] depends on the one that I feel
[1:46:19] the most that's the one that wins see no
[1:46:24] matter what an answer in every bit of
[1:46:26] life you gonna have evil and do it you
[1:46:31] know have the devil trying to pull you
[1:46:33] into one direction with God leading you
[1:46:34] to go somewhere else everything you do
[1:46:38] is gonna be that way look at it they say
[1:46:41] God and Satan are often involved in the
[1:46:43] same event but for different causes they
[1:46:50] said God is involved so that the
[1:46:52] believer might be instructed to grow but
[1:46:56] Satan is involved so he can try to
[1:46:58] discredit the believer and also
[1:47:01] discredit God himself so so so when we
[1:47:06] look at this situation we can see a man
[1:47:10] there's something that happened here we
[1:47:12] and we want to understand David's trying
[1:47:14] to number the people and he delighted in
[1:47:18] this oh god y'all work with me here just
[1:47:21] for a little bit he delighted in this
[1:47:23] what he was doing trying to count his
[1:47:25] warriors he wanted to see how big his
[1:47:28] army was there you go he wanted he was
[1:47:33] his heart was being lifted up and he
[1:47:35] wanted to see how great his army was how
[1:47:38] much he had accomplished
[1:47:41] you all remember you know brother Felix
[1:47:43] I was talking to brother Felix one time
[1:47:46] and I was just blessed by his answer I
[1:47:48] said brother he had a business that he
[1:47:49] runs and I said brother Felix I say how
[1:47:51] many customers you got he said brother
[1:47:54] Jack I don't count my customers I say
[1:47:57] huh every business owner knows how many
[1:48:00] customers they got like how come you
[1:48:01] only say he said you remember how David
[1:48:03] was counting that army I don't say I
[1:48:06] didn't want to count my customers
[1:48:07] because whoever God sent me and blesses
[1:48:09] me to you know bless me to do work with
[1:48:10] thank God for that but I don't ever want
[1:48:12] to count them and try to get my heart
[1:48:14] lifted up I said brother I appreciate
[1:48:15] that
[1:48:21] see there anything we do we got to stay
[1:48:23] humble see because cuz this is where
[1:48:27] this we're gone a Satanist where that
[1:48:28] battle because you know here you might
[1:48:30] be doing something God but the devil
[1:48:31] gonna be right there to try to elevate
[1:48:32] you and when Satan kind of gets your
[1:48:35] heart lift it up just a little bit God
[1:48:38] got to do something to bring you right
[1:48:39] back that you got to watch your heart
[1:48:44] and everything and sometimes be so
[1:48:47] humble you just be missing it oh my god
[1:48:53] I be you know oh lord help us you know
[1:48:56] sometimes people have that that fake
[1:48:58] humility yeah I know what that is
[1:49:00] they taught real self I mean so some
[1:49:05] mouse can't even hear they talk so soft
[1:49:08] that faith humble humbleness
[1:49:11] that's not it based on what's coming up
[1:49:15] children laugh we know what's in your
[1:49:16] heart it's not half soft you talk just
[1:49:20] get that stuff up at your heart glory to
[1:49:23] God to some things you don't even need
[1:49:24] to say no matter how soft his b instead
[1:49:27] still don't need to be seen it come on
[1:49:30] church glory to God so Davis heart was
[1:49:34] being checked in this situation his
[1:49:36] heart was being checked now now now now
[1:49:39] I want you to understand I'm the notes
[1:49:41] that you know I got from my Bible here
[1:49:44] they said this that's taking a census
[1:49:47] was not wrong he want the number two
[1:49:49] people taking the census was not wrong
[1:49:51] because God had already done that if you
[1:49:53] go back in the Book of Numbers just
[1:49:55] think about the title numbers God is
[1:49:58] actually telling them the number the
[1:50:00] people right so it wasn't it wasn't
[1:50:02] taking census God had done that God
[1:50:04] himself had previously ordered Moses to
[1:50:06] make to censuses that's the numbers one
[1:50:08] chapter 1 and also numbers chapter 26
[1:50:11] however in this case Satan seized upon
[1:50:15] the growing pride of David's heart and
[1:50:17] to incite him into taking a census right
[1:50:21] so the King might have ground of
[1:50:24] boasting God is the control of all
[1:50:28] things he allowed the deed to be done as
[1:50:31] to bring David to a place of humility
[1:50:34] he and reality so that's why when you
[1:50:37] look there in the scripture and once one
[1:50:39] script of Sam Satan did another Satan
[1:50:41] script of saying God didn't know God
[1:50:42] allowed Satan to do it that does that
[1:50:46] clear up one of the discrepancies God
[1:50:49] allowed Satan to do it and sometimes God
[1:50:53] allows Satan to do things a see how we
[1:50:56] gonna respond how are you gonna react
[1:51:01] alright that's just one of the
[1:51:04] discrepancies
[1:51:05] now let's Colt let's go on back to the
[1:51:07] scripture here and read a actually I'm
[1:51:09] gonna give you a few few more before I
[1:51:11] break into something else and another
[1:51:14] discrepancy in this is they record in
[1:51:18] one chapter one book only eight hundred
[1:51:20] thousand valiant men that Druce wart
[1:51:23] along with five hundred thousand from
[1:51:26] Judah the the scripture says 1,100,000
[1:51:30] from Israel and four hundred and seventy
[1:51:32] thousand from Judith our numbers are off
[1:51:34] here alright you'll find these I'm just
[1:51:36] pointing them out for you
[1:51:37] one of them say seven years of famine
[1:51:40] and the other one says three years of
[1:51:43] famine which one is it
[1:51:45] now i'ma tell you that give use of this
[1:51:47] references I'm not putting my Bible down
[1:51:49] I'm still gonna be reading it there's
[1:51:52] reasons for it and if you want to study
[1:51:55] it you can it's all not there on the
[1:51:56] internet you can find why the
[1:51:58] discrepancies I mean people have given a
[1:52:00] life to try to prove why the discrepancy
[1:52:02] there I'm not focusing on it I was just
[1:52:06] some church on Friday night I said you
[1:52:08] know there's people I could show you
[1:52:10] quotes on where brother Branham might
[1:52:12] have brought in seven years of
[1:52:14] tribulation verses three and a half
[1:52:15] years of tribulation I can show you
[1:52:17] quotes on both sides
[1:52:19] Alleluia right but the quit but my thing
[1:52:22] is I don't have time to show you quotes
[1:52:24] from that they try to prove which one is
[1:52:25] it
[1:52:26] the reason because I'm not gonna be here
[1:52:29] I'm not gonna be in the tribulation so I
[1:52:32] study the tribulation
[1:52:40] here's the lovely well I said David paid
[1:52:44] 50 shekels in second semi 2424 but first
[1:52:49] first chronicles 21 25 says that David
[1:52:51] paid 600 shekels for the same property
[1:52:54] right so we see some differences here
[1:52:56] now one of the one of the reasons why
[1:52:59] they said it said what David paid for in
[1:53:01] chronicles was the entire area not just
[1:53:04] the threshing floor right so the the the
[1:53:07] the the 50 shekels might have been just
[1:53:09] for the threshing floor where he built
[1:53:10] the altar but he also had he paid for
[1:53:12] the entire area the entire area David
[1:53:15] bought the entire area now just stay
[1:53:17] with me here just a little bit now
[1:53:19] there's reasons for all of that and
[1:53:22] let's just look at this let's go back to
[1:53:24] description first chronicles chapter 21
[1:53:26] verse 20 now for me I believe the devil
[1:53:33] desires that we focus on discrepancies
[1:53:36] I'm not doing that I just brought it to
[1:53:39] your attention I did that intentionally
[1:53:41] because in this message people are
[1:53:43] focused on discrepancies right some of
[1:53:45] the people focus on discrepancies but
[1:53:47] here in this story amen I'm bringing you
[1:53:49] some of the discrepancies and I think
[1:53:51] Satan's desires that we focused on the
[1:53:54] discrepancies rather than the element of
[1:53:56] truth and what I see in this story is a
[1:54:00] scarlet thread I don't want us to catch
[1:54:04] that there's a scarlet thread a thread
[1:54:07] of redemption here don't look at the
[1:54:10] description see the discrepancies look
[1:54:12] at what God is trying to bring to your
[1:54:13] attention through this Oh Lord Jesus
[1:54:17] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:54:23] I'm at verse 20 so so now we understand
[1:54:29] you know David actually chose the
[1:54:34] Prophet gasps told him that you got to
[1:54:35] choose what what it's going to be and
[1:54:37] David shows that it would be you know a
[1:54:39] plague that God was sending plague
[1:54:41] amongst the people and he wanted he
[1:54:43] didn't want to pretty much be running be
[1:54:46] running from an enemies he to know that
[1:54:47] he just put his put his faith in God on
[1:54:49] whatever God decided that's what he was
[1:54:51] gonna allow to happen now let's let's
[1:54:52] pick this up it says an aura and turned
[1:54:55] back and saw the angel and his four sons
[1:55:02] with him hid themselves that awning was
[1:55:07] threshing wheat and as David came to
[1:55:10] Orin am born and looked and saw David
[1:55:13] and went out of the threshing floor and
[1:55:16] bowed himself to David with his face to
[1:55:18] the ground then David said to Orrin and
[1:55:22] grant me the place of this dressing
[1:55:24] floor that I may build an altar there in
[1:55:27] unto the Lord thou shalt granted me for
[1:55:32] the full price that the plague may be
[1:55:34] stayed from the people and oil and said
[1:55:38] to David take it to thee and let my lord
[1:55:42] the King do that which is good in his
[1:55:44] eyes lo I give thee the oxen also for
[1:55:47] Brunt offerings wait a minute that word
[1:55:50] out of me something to y'all now run off
[1:55:53] remember that it's gonna be the whole
[1:55:54] sacrifice and where you have to put the
[1:55:56] burnt offering outside the camp oh my
[1:56:01] hello can I give you out something can I
[1:56:07] have that picture here
[1:56:19] this is what or nan-oh
[1:56:24] this is what orden and home
[1:56:28] this is what David wanted right here in
[1:56:32] Jerusalem right here in this whole
[1:56:35] despot this is what big was this is what
[1:56:38] this whole story is all about right here
[1:56:39] and if Orden an onus and notice now the
[1:56:46] angel Lord told David to go to Ornan and
[1:56:51] purchase this not no no don't go
[1:56:55] anywhere else in the State of Israel I
[1:56:59] want you to go to or Nan's house see
[1:57:04] just like I say it looked at you told
[1:57:06] Abraham go to Mount Moriah specific
[1:57:11] places to go and do things they that had
[1:57:13] to go right here and get this from Orlan
[1:57:16] and I notice he had to purchase it
[1:57:20] because Orlan wanted to give it to him
[1:57:23] but he had to purchase it can y'all
[1:57:28] y'all just y'all bear with me just a
[1:57:29] little bit just a little bit longer I'm
[1:57:31] just dropping these things up he had to
[1:57:33] purchase this spot not have it give it
[1:57:35] to him all right I'm just stay with
[1:57:41] that's keep that thought now let me go
[1:57:42] back to the scripture let me go back to
[1:57:44] the scripture I'm going back where that
[1:57:46] stop that I'm verse 23 I believe or dad
[1:57:50] said on a day that take it to thee and
[1:57:52] let my lord the King do that which is
[1:57:54] good in his eyes though I give thee the
[1:57:56] option also for burnt offers and the
[1:57:58] threshing instruments for wood and the
[1:58:00] week for the wheat offerings I give it
[1:58:02] all and King David said to or nay but I
[1:58:06] will verily buy it for the full price
[1:58:09] for I will not take that which is that
[1:58:12] that which is dine for the Lord nor
[1:58:15] offer burnt offerings without cause
[1:58:20] David say I came off of this without a
[1:58:22] cause
[1:58:23] can I just break into that keep me at
[1:58:26] verse 24 I want to break in that because
[1:58:29] I was reminded of something that
[1:58:31] happened in scripture over a matthew
[1:58:34] chapter 4 and also in Luke chapter 4
[1:58:37] Jesus would
[1:58:39] faced with three great temptations
[1:58:42] hallelujah brother branham calls it the
[1:58:45] three major assaults Matthew chapter
[1:58:49] four verse through three through through
[1:58:50] four he was told to turn the stones into
[1:58:53] bread Satan come and won him to use his
[1:58:56] own power on his self to feed him want
[1:59:00] to feed himself he was hungry and man
[1:59:02] gets hungry he can do almost anything
[1:59:03] he'll steal he'll rob he'll beg he'll
[1:59:06] borrow anything see he had that appetite
[1:59:09] and Satan used his first great major
[1:59:12] assault upon him to take his power that
[1:59:15] he had been given to overcome outcome
[1:59:17] with and used it on himself he didn't
[1:59:19] use it on himself
[1:59:20] no he used it on others that's right he
[1:59:22] used it on others not himself it wasn't
[1:59:25] for him though amen he could have done
[1:59:27] it he certainly could have done it I'm
[1:59:29] reading here a man out of other message
[1:59:32] how can I overcome I'm just reading bits
[1:59:34] and pieces so don't try to pull this up
[1:59:36] brother branham also says in Matthew
[1:59:38] four or five through seven Jesus was
[1:59:41] tempted to be a show-off right says now
[1:59:43] if you want to be something before the
[1:59:45] people stand up here on the temple jump
[1:59:47] off sheet I'll give you a skip before
[1:59:49] because it's written he give his angels
[1:59:51] charge over thee lest at any time you
[1:59:53] dash your foot against a stone he barely
[1:59:54] up to make him a show up to show his
[1:59:57] authority and no true servant of God
[2:00:00] ever does that they don't want to be
[2:00:02] show off now this was the last thing
[2:00:04] that happened in this way and this great
[2:00:06] temptation is made your salt
[2:00:08] the third assault was found in matthew 4
[2:00:10] verse 8 through 10 and what was
[2:00:13] happening here is that he was trying to
[2:00:17] get Jesus he was going to give him the
[2:00:21] kingdoms if he would just bow down and
[2:00:24] and and and and worship Him see just
[2:00:29] like David couldn't take this land from
[2:00:32] or land and now I love you if you if you
[2:00:36] caught it there's two different names
[2:00:39] that was mentioned in Scripture one was
[2:00:40] Aruna and one was Ord and there's a
[2:00:44] reason for that I'll get to it in a
[2:00:46] second but but he was he was trying to
[2:00:49] get him to - by I mean he say I'm going
[2:00:53] to
[2:00:53] give us you said no no I need the bike
[2:00:54] because I can't offer anything I can't
[2:00:56] offer burnt awful without a cost so here
[2:00:58] here Matthew 4 8 through 10 we said I'm
[2:01:00] gonna give you the kingdoms of this
[2:01:02] world if you just bow down and worship
[2:01:04] me brother Branham tells us that what
[2:01:08] Satan was doing was trying to get Jesus
[2:01:10] to take a kingdom without a Calvary you
[2:01:20] can have the kingdom without a Calvary
[2:01:21] say Satan want a Christ to take the
[2:01:24] kingdom without the cross Satan wanted
[2:01:26] to give Christ a kingdom a man without
[2:01:29] having a cavalry right because see
[2:01:31] because of Calvary hallelujah the price
[2:01:35] of sin had been paid and if he had not
[2:01:39] taken Calvary we wouldn't be able to sit
[2:01:41] where we're sitting at right now so so
[2:01:44] the same way David had to pay stop there
[2:01:48] for the same place that Jesus would died
[2:01:52] on Jesus had to pay something in order
[2:01:59] to redeem us Oh church is so beautiful
[2:02:03] it's so beautiful when you just look at
[2:02:06] these things I want to I just I just I'm
[2:02:09] I'm just blessed by I'm absolutely
[2:02:13] blessed by seeing Christ how he just his
[2:02:16] store is just all throughout the
[2:02:18] scripture and say the devil wants you to
[2:02:21] focus on the discrepancies but to miss
[2:02:24] in the scarlet thread
[2:02:29] brother Ram said he had a he won a
[2:02:31] kingdom without Calvary says remember he
[2:02:34] was trying to get him to forfeit it
[2:02:35] without the cross if he did we'd be lost
[2:02:38] it says he could have took the kingdom
[2:02:41] but he must he must come back he was
[2:02:43] tempted to do it now
[2:02:45] death is a hard thing he was tempted to
[2:02:49] take his Liberty and be the king of the
[2:02:51] earth without the cross but if he did
[2:02:54] his subjects would have died Satan would
[2:02:57] have gladly made that proposition with
[2:02:58] him but he said get behind me Satan he
[2:03:02] didn't do it
[2:03:03] Church I'm so glad that our Lord and
[2:03:05] Savior did not take the kingdom without
[2:03:08] the cross hallelujah hallelujah
[2:03:11] hallelujah I I just I just I think God
[2:03:18] for him let me uh let me let me just
[2:03:20] finish up this aid man the scripture
[2:03:25] glory glory and I'm gonna bring you in
[2:03:28] you know just just bring your attention
[2:03:30] to a couple of other things if I can
[2:03:36] look at this says in verse 24 first
[2:03:41] group first chronicles 21 says and King
[2:03:44] David said to or Dan made but I would
[2:03:46] barely buy it for the full price but I
[2:03:48] will not take that which is dying for
[2:03:51] the Lord nor offer burnt offerings
[2:03:52] without costs so David gave - or Dan for
[2:03:56] the place six hundred shekels of gold by
[2:03:59] weight and David built there an altar
[2:04:01] unto the Lord and offered and offered
[2:04:05] burnt offerings and peace offerings and
[2:04:07] called upon the Lord and he answered him
[2:04:09] from heaven by fire upon the altar of
[2:04:12] burnt-offering
[2:04:13] God answered from heaven by fire now I
[2:04:17] want you to understand let's go on
[2:04:19] saying the lord commanded the angel and
[2:04:21] he put up his sport again into the
[2:04:23] sheath thereof so what was happening is
[2:04:25] that this dis death angel because Davis
[2:04:28] heart got lifted up the death angel
[2:04:30] begin to go all throughout Israel going
[2:04:34] all throughout his room and dying
[2:04:36] everywhere
[2:04:36] pestilence it dropped I mean and pretty
[2:04:39] much God wiping out his army see the
[2:04:41] Lord gives the Lord
[2:04:42] that's what David should have been
[2:04:44] thinking about but but here God's wiping
[2:04:46] out everybody and as the angel orders
[2:04:48] approaching Jerusalem he comes to
[2:04:52] Jerusalem and when it gets there they
[2:04:54] see the angel lord give me they just
[2:04:56] strike right there and that's where they
[2:04:57] begin to crime and begin to repent but
[2:04:59] why was it stopped in Jerusalem Oh My
[2:05:02] Jesus I want you to think about it why
[2:05:05] did it stop right there in Jerusalem
[2:05:07] why why why why did they find the angel
[2:05:10] or at and right above a right of a horn
[2:05:14] and stretching floor because God knew
[2:05:16] that that's where amen the penalty for
[2:05:20] sin would be pain is intrusive l'm at
[2:05:24] the spot where horn an old that's where
[2:05:28] Calvary was gonna be it happened at
[2:05:33] Calvary stay with me stay with me
[2:05:40] this are diverting up here in this verse
[2:05:43] verse 26 David built there an altar to
[2:05:48] the Lord and offered burnt offerings and
[2:05:49] peace offerings and called upon the Lord
[2:05:51] and he answered him from heaven by fire
[2:05:52] from the altar of burnt-offering and the
[2:05:54] lord commanded the angel and he put up
[2:05:56] his floored again into the sheath
[2:05:58] thereof at that time when David saw that
[2:06:01] the Lord had answered him in the
[2:06:02] threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite
[2:06:03] then he sacrificed there for the
[2:06:05] tabernacle of the Lord which Moses made
[2:06:08] in the wilderness and the altar of the
[2:06:09] burnt offering were at that season in
[2:06:12] the high place at Gibeon but David could
[2:06:16] not go before it to inquire God for he
[2:06:19] was afraid because of the sword of the
[2:06:21] Lord of the sport of the Ange of the
[2:06:23] Lord
[2:06:23] now the tabernacle was in Gideon but the
[2:06:26] tabernacle was moved to Jerusalem we'll
[2:06:32] get him to that a little bit later can I
[2:06:35] tell you a little bit about a ruler or
[2:06:36] an an this man had two names in one
[2:06:43] chapter in 2nd 2nd samuel NT for his his
[2:06:47] name is recorded as a ruler
[2:06:49] but in 1st 1st chronicles 21 his record
[2:06:53] is borning now here's the thing Orlan
[2:06:57] meant light of the sun
[2:07:04] light of the side
[2:07:07] he owned the property where we were
[2:07:11] gonna see a dual sunrise the SU in WA
[2:07:17] tries one day but because of Calvary and
[2:07:21] Jesus rising from the grave the s o n
[2:07:25] also rose and gave light to mankind
[2:07:29] that's why the man's name was Orlan
[2:07:32] I just the other thing about his name
[2:07:44] Aruna man arc
[2:07:48] song or curse
[2:07:56] I thought about curse it came to my
[2:07:59] heart Galatians 3:13 Christ hath
[2:08:02] redeemed us from the curse of the law
[2:08:05] being made a curse for us for it is
[2:08:11] written cursed is every one that hangeth
[2:08:14] on a tree where did that happen that at
[2:08:20] a ruler's threshing floor
[2:08:28] so I'm not I'm not getting caught up on
[2:08:31] the discrepancies cuz there's a scarlet
[2:08:34] thread going right through all the
[2:08:35] discrepancies and that's what I'm
[2:08:37] keeping my eye on these are the things
[2:08:39] that happen at County go to rule us by
[2:08:48] his threshing floor and not just
[2:08:50] expression for but by the whole
[2:08:52] territory about a whole territory and
[2:08:55] where that mosque of Omar is that was
[2:08:59] the territory of Aruna
[2:09:06] let me fit a shot
[2:09:14] that day on Calvary
[2:09:18] that day on Calvary listen to this
[2:09:22] the one great important thing that
[2:09:25] Kaveri means to us and the world is it
[2:09:30] it's settled the same question once for
[2:09:33] all
[2:09:33] see that's why that's why I would you
[2:09:36] know Jesus in Matthew 4 and Luke 4 he
[2:09:39] couldn't take them propositions of the
[2:09:40] devil he had to go to Calvary he could I
[2:09:44] mean if he had not going to Calvary we
[2:09:46] would all be finished
[2:09:49] he says Calvary it's settled the sin
[2:09:52] question once it's wrong I love that
[2:09:55] that's why when he went to Calvary you
[2:09:57] understand Calvary being the place of
[2:10:00] skull Calvary been Mount Moriah caliber
[2:10:04] being a rule of stretching floor Calvary
[2:10:07] all this happened at Calvary and here
[2:10:10] you know he goes to Calvary and by going
[2:10:11] there to this place of skull and atom
[2:10:14] skull being there blood drop him down
[2:10:17] there right through the cracks
[2:10:19] hit atom skull pretty much saying the
[2:10:22] sin has been settled Adam it's no law
[2:10:25] against you know more the price has been
[2:10:28] paid it all happened at Calvary that's
[2:10:31] why the devil could not divert him all
[2:10:33] this had to happen here listen
[2:10:39] the same question settled the same
[2:10:41] question once a for all man was found
[2:10:43] guilty of saying that sin was a penalty
[2:10:45] that him that no man could pay the
[2:10:47] penalty was so great until there wasn't
[2:10:49] anyone that could pay the penalty says I
[2:10:52] truly believe that God ordained it that
[2:10:54] way that the penalty would be so great
[2:10:56] that no man could pay it so he could do
[2:10:59] it himself see there was a penalty paid
[2:11:02] for david numbering those people but
[2:11:07] here God himself knew that where when it
[2:11:09] went when it was settled when it when he
[2:11:11] ceased he taste I'm actually there's
[2:11:13] another scripture I mean I didn't go all
[2:11:15] the way through it but if they got
[2:11:17] repented himself
[2:11:18] he would he say I've seen all the the
[2:11:21] the the the shedding of blood I'm
[2:11:22] repenting myself since you can stay your
[2:11:25] hand told her that thing just kind of
[2:11:27] stopped right there don't slay any more
[2:11:29] and where the death angel stopped
[2:11:36] that gallery
[2:11:42] you know what I tell you I told the Lord
[2:11:46] that I wanna I wanna fall more in love
[2:11:48] with him and I want to preach to help
[2:11:51] people fall more in love with Jesus you
[2:11:54] can just see him all through the
[2:11:55] scripture nothing nothing is in the
[2:11:58] Bible by chance of my accident
[2:12:00] everything was very specific everything
[2:12:05] was very specific he did all the time in
[2:12:10] Calvin I mean a room have probably
[2:12:11] didn't know he didn't know his main met
[2:12:14] curse people got a rune up they don't
[2:12:17] know it and maybe tell them don't call
[2:12:20] me that call me horn an both names that
[2:12:24] mean oh my lord not Lord now the penalty
[2:12:28] stand was death and we were all born in
[2:12:32] Staunton shaped and they could come to
[2:12:34] the world speaking last therefore there
[2:12:36] wasn't none of us that was worthy or
[2:12:38] they could find no one on earth that was
[2:12:41] worthy
[2:12:45] let me
[2:12:48] let me go on to justice one other quote
[2:12:51] here out of God hide himself in
[2:12:53] simplicity than revealing himself at the
[2:12:55] same this is just this is just beautiful
[2:12:59] the one thing I did I want to tell you
[2:13:02] we all know that David himself said too
[2:13:06] much blood and it could not build God a
[2:13:09] temple but God did allow David to build
[2:13:15] an altar on the very same spot that he
[2:13:20] would be offered an altar to offer burnt
[2:13:25] offerings
[2:13:31] you know David did this David it but
[2:13:34] David did build an altar here let me I'm
[2:13:41] God hot in himself Lisa didn't reveal
[2:13:44] himself the same these little places
[2:13:47] data could not build a true tavern a
[2:13:49] tavern I forgot because he wasn't
[2:13:51] prepared for doing there was nothing he
[2:13:53] could do he was immortal and shed life
[2:13:56] so is it today to us we're not prepared
[2:13:59] to build the truths have an act of God
[2:14:01] there's only one can do that and it's
[2:14:04] big it's being in its construction now
[2:14:07] but this little Tabernacle along with
[2:14:10] the temple that Solomon built him and
[2:14:11] along with the others are only temporary
[2:14:14] places of worship until the time comes
[2:14:16] when the real tabernac will be set up
[2:14:18] upon the earth and the righteousness
[2:14:19] shall reign from Sky to sky and there
[2:14:22] will be no more sorrow there will be
[2:14:23] there will be no funerals preached than
[2:14:27] that Tabernacle thank God for that
[2:14:30] there'll be no more weddings so the
[2:14:33] wedding will be one great wedding for
[2:14:35] eternity what a time that will be
[2:14:39] searched I just just go back to that
[2:14:42] picture and just finish this off I just
[2:14:44] want to show you a man just what all
[2:14:49] this meant this is why people fighting
[2:14:51] over this land and everything like that
[2:14:53] but this means so much to the Jews that
[2:14:56] means so much to the Muslims and this is
[2:15:01] why the Muslims this is what I I think
[2:15:03] if I'm not mistaken this represents
[2:15:05] about 37 acres of land this is on top of
[2:15:07] the mountain
[2:15:08] this is on top of the mountain one of
[2:15:10] the things I found out there you know we
[2:15:12] we we we look at a mountain in like man
[2:15:16] that just big you know but we went to
[2:15:19] Masada and when you look at it just in
[2:15:21] this big rock mountain just a huge rock
[2:15:24] mountain and you wonder how in the world
[2:15:26] we got a call the cable car we went up
[2:15:28] to the top when we got up to the top you
[2:15:30] get up on top of that all the flat land
[2:15:32] just acres of land they built multiple
[2:15:35] they took to put two palaces
[2:15:37] there and you wonder how did they lose
[2:15:39] the place right but uh you know but here
[2:15:42] you know when you get up to some of
[2:15:43] these mountains here it's just all this
[2:15:45] land on top of the mountain and this
[2:15:47] spot it means so much to the Muslims it
[2:15:51] means so much to the Jews
[2:15:53] it also means so much to we Christians
[2:15:55] because this is where our Lord and
[2:15:57] Savior this is where he went this is
[2:15:59] where Abraham went this is where aruna
[2:16:02] own land the all of this is at the same
[2:16:04] spot thank God thank God for what
[2:16:09] happened at Calvary I just I just
[2:16:13] appreciate more
[2:16:15] I appreciate the Lord I'm just I'm blown
[2:16:17] away so I'm already I've already led you
[2:16:19] into something else if David could not
[2:16:24] build an altar here but he made
[2:16:26] preparation for his son to build a
[2:16:30] temple here this is the same spot where
[2:16:35] as Solomon's Temple Stewart
[2:16:43] so Solomon stood with Calvary is his
[2:16:49] temple stood where Calvary is so that's
[2:16:52] the next sermon I'll talk about that but
[2:16:55] Turk I'm grateful for my Lord and Savior
[2:16:58] did at Calvary let's give the Lord a
[2:17:02] hand the priests mine let's pray father
[2:17:13] I'm I'm just blown away when I look at
[2:17:18] the Scarlet thread of redemption all
[2:17:21] throughout scripture stories that we've
[2:17:25] read for years but God now you quicken
[2:17:32] these things to us you help us to
[2:17:33] understand what this is truly all about
[2:17:37] why it was even recorded in Scripture
[2:17:40] what would be the purpose then we see
[2:17:45] the recordings in both 2nd Samuel 24 1st
[2:17:49] chronicles 21 with CDs Berry's
[2:17:52] recordings and some of the things are a
[2:17:53] little different the numbers that are
[2:17:56] listed are a little different and it's
[2:17:58] Satan's job in order to try to give us
[2:18:02] the focus on the differences but it's
[2:18:05] the holy spirit that helps us to follow
[2:18:08] the scarlet thread not the differences
[2:18:10] does it really matter how many men what
[2:18:14] really matters is how many men were
[2:18:18] counted or lured or whatever whatever
[2:18:20] else might have happened there what what
[2:18:22] really mattered is that that place the
[2:18:27] ordinance on place where a ruler on
[2:18:31] there the same man Aruna Ornan father
[2:18:34] had the names have different meanings
[2:18:36] that same place where
[2:18:43] the plague of death will stay
[2:18:50] and there are significance there
[2:18:53] because mankind Adams race we've been
[2:18:59] plagued by death one thing that they all
[2:19:01] would go all the way back to the
[2:19:04] beginning thy seed shall possess the
[2:19:05] gate of this of his enemy Lord the one
[2:19:08] thing that they all had a problem that
[2:19:10] was death because of what you did there
[2:19:17] at Calvary we no longer have to fear
[2:19:20] death
[2:19:21] Paul said death where is your sting
[2:19:23] grave where is your victory thank you
[2:19:30] Lord for gallery
[2:19:37] a pray Lord that this means so much more
[2:19:40] to us we need to fall more in love with
[2:19:43] you Satan tried to divert you you try to
[2:19:51] get you to take another path no no you
[2:19:56] see even though it was tempting for you
[2:20:00] to receive the kingdoms and everything
[2:20:01] he tried to do that without Calvary
[2:20:05] Calvary you knew was said of the same
[2:20:07] question
[2:20:09] Calvary you knew Adams skull was sitting
[2:20:12] right there
[2:20:15] Calvary you knew these things just as in
[2:20:19] Davis day the plague of death was
[2:20:21] stained because of the altar that was
[2:20:24] built and the sacrifice that was
[2:20:26] accepted by God answer my fire also Lord
[2:20:31] we know today that the plague of death
[2:20:34] is stained and we can come bowl into
[2:20:37] your presence because we have accepted
[2:20:41] what happened at Calvary Lord we praise
[2:20:45] you we thank you and we glorify you we
[2:20:48] exalt you for who you are sin Jesus name
[2:20:53] we pray amen

[2:21:13] on him to them he gave power to become
[2:21:16] sons of God I encourage you believe on
[2:21:19] him serving with everything you got if
[2:21:22] you've never repented of your sins you
[2:21:24] find yourself a place where you can just
[2:21:26] repent be be real with God ask them to
[2:21:30] forgive you of your sins servant of
[2:21:33] everything you got it's worth it it's

[2:22:03] Jerusalem and I can't remember exactly
[2:22:05] where it was but I was asked to just
[2:22:11] leave in a word of Prayer I think I
[2:22:14] might have been right there at the
[2:22:16] garden tomb and when I opened my mouth
[2:22:21] and a word of prayer acidic is either
[2:22:24] garden tomb the Garden of Gethsemane I
[2:22:25] can't remember exactly where but my

[2:22:34] that I come from I'm selfish selfish

[2:22:59] appreciated him I appreciated that Lord
[2:23:03] that he what he would leave his front he
[2:23:05] would leave his throne and come down and
