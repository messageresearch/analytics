Amen. &gt;&gt; W [screaming] Amen. Somebody give him praise. Somebody give him glory in this place. Thank you Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Thinking earlier this morning as [music] we were in prayer, I said, you know, the um being able to to bless people is one of the best things that we could do. Uh brother Random say the greatest [music] three words [snorts] that you could ever say to anybody is God bless you. And I just want you to turn around, find somebody that you can just say, "God bless you." God [music] bless you. Hallelujah. Softly. [music] Softly. Keep going softly. Everybody. Everybody. Hallelujah. Come on. Tell them God bless you. [singing] Amen. Amen. [music and singing] God bless you my brother. God bless you my sister. Praise God. This morning we are [music] blessed to have my dear friend and brother uh brother Nathan Bryant with us. Amen. All the way from Jeffersonville, Indiana, New Albany, Indiana is where the church. [music] But um we thank God he's the pastor of Church of the Open Door there in uh in [music] Indiana and he brought his oldest son Philillip with him. Amen. On this journey. So it's so good to have them with us. And on Friday night, we had a a wonderful service. the Lord just [music] blessed and um and afterwards like brother Simba said earlier we had a prayer line and and I believe [music] that through that prayer line there's going to be many manifestations. Amen. Praise God. So this this morning, Amen. I want him to come in his own way and just you just [music] pray for him. The enemy has been attacking his his his voice uh but he's pressed his way through to come and bring a word to the people. So we call the devil [music] a liar. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we claim the victory. So let's receive. Amen. My friend and my brother, brother Nathan Bryan. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's [music] good to be back in church. &gt;&gt; Amen. You appreciate the presence of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. I was thinking back there as [music] you were singing that song uh may his blessings be upon you and uh I was reminded of a testimony I heard brother Billy Paul give years ago and [music] he came out the church had been just worshiping praising the Lord and and the very first thing he said was I like the way [music] you worship. &gt;&gt; So I echo that this morning. I like the way you worship. Amen. [music] It's good to be with believers of like precious faith and a lot of familiar faces, a lot of good friends [music] and certainly appreciate each and everyone. I've enjoyed brother Solomon's singing and all the fellowship and the the hospitality and uh I was a little disappointed this trip. I didn't get to spend [music] as much time with brother Jack as I wanted to because I kept trying to rest my voice as much as I could for these services. But, uh, that just means we'll have to get together again sometime. And he he has he [music] has a tendency to come our way a little more often these days. So, next time he's up, maybe we can spend some more time together. But, Amen. Thank you, musicians. I wish I had the voice to sing, but I don't. So, we're just going to go straight to the to the scriptures. Amen. You love the word. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. Believers love the word because the Holy Spirit feeds on the word. And I want to look at this thought this morning. And as [clears throat] soon as brother Jack and I had talked about uh me coming this this way, uh I thought of this this sermon and I've had it on my heart um the entire time and and was going back over some things um yesterday and just seemed like the Lord was just confirming that. And so we want to look at this thought this morning of the power of committ. The power of committ. &gt;&gt; Psalm chapter 37 and verse three. Very familiar scripture. And again I I preached this back home as a three-part series, but I won't try to preach three sermons to you. We just hit the highlights of it. Psalm 37:3, "Trust in the Lord and do good." So shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed. Delight thyself also in the Lord, and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart. Does your Bible say that? &gt;&gt; Delight thyself also in the Lord, and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart. Now, I'm not trying to add to the word this morning, but I found in my life by God's grace, it's not anything I've done, but it's what he's done that many times he will actually give us more than our hearts desire. &gt;&gt; Because many times God has something better for us &gt;&gt; than what we could have planned. &gt;&gt; And we see that in many aspects of life. Maybe it's a uh maybe it's a brother trying to find a wife or a sister trying to find a husband and they meet somebody they think, "Oh, this is the one." And they begin to beg and pray, "Oh, God, let this be the one." And and Lord, just I want your perfect will. And and and they just they think for sure this is going to be the best thing and that's what they want. And then years later, they look back and I'm preaching on myself this morning and they say, "Oh my, God had something so much better in store for me than what I had planned &gt;&gt; and what I had asked for that his plans were so much better than anything I could have ever planned." Sometimes we go on a career path or sometimes we we we're trying to apply for a college or whatever it be and we have in our heart, Lord, this is what I want. And God blesses us beyond what we could want. And we're not here I don't believe in preaching prosperity, but I do believe in preaching provision. &gt;&gt; Amen. That God said he was a provider. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I'm not going to promise you, hey, if you believe this message, God's going to give you a Lamborghini. No, the word doesn't say that. &gt;&gt; But it did say he would provide for all your needs. &gt;&gt; Amen. Delight thyself also in the Lord, and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart. Commit thy way unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; Commit thy way unto the Lord. Trust also in him, and he shall bring it to pass. &gt;&gt; Before we pray, I want to read you a quote here. Life story 1951. Brother Ram said, "If someone talks about you and you talk back about them, God can't fight your battle." &gt;&gt; If someone talks about you and you talk back about them, God can't fight your battle. You're fighting it yourself. See, &gt;&gt; just let loose and let him do it &gt;&gt; and just commit it to him. &gt;&gt; Listen to this. The greatest weapon that I know of of a Christian today is a committal to God. &gt;&gt; When you can't do nothing about it, just commit it to him &gt;&gt; and God will take care of it. &gt;&gt; Well, I believe we could just dismiss and go home and say, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; If we can just get that much and really apply it, we'll be doing all right. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads together. Lord Jesus, we thank you for this atmosphere of worship. Lord, we thank you for the songs that we've heard. We thank you for the gifts that you've placed in the body of Christ. Lord, we thank you for this church. Lord, we thank you for the pastor and the musicians, the deacons, the trustees, and everyone that puts their shoulder to the wheel to help, whether it's in tithes or offerings or Lord, helping in in acts of service or whatever it would be. Father, we thank you for each and everyone. Lord, for sister Erica and sister Sarah standing faithfully behind brother Jack, Lord, and the different ones, Lord, family members and friends. And Lord, we we have such a history, Lord, with this group of believers here. And we're so thankful for their friendship. We're thankful for their stand for the word. And Lord, I just pray that you would help me to get myself out of the way. Lord, I've tried to do everything I know how to do to study and to prepare. Lord, I've tried to preserve my voice and not talk more than I had to in fellowship and tried to Lord soothe it with every kind of oil and drink and and cough drop and lozener that I could think of, Lord, to try to be prepared this morning and have as as much voice as I could. But Lord, if you'll just come on the scene and touch my voice, Lord, then we know it'll all be all right. And Father, we just give this service to you. I pray that the efforts of each one, myself included, would not be in vain, but that you would do something this morning to strengthen your children, to give us a closer walk with you, Lord, and a closer fellowship with you. We'll give you the glory f for it, Lord. May we walk from this building closer to you than when we came in in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. And you can be seated this morning. Um, I'm going to try my best to to work through this as quickly as we can. Uh, because I I have quite a bit of material that I want to try to get to, but I also want to be sensitive to the Holy Spirit. But there's some things in here that I believe especially there's two principles uh that I I want to express to you that are scriptural and messagebased principles that we'll read quotes and scriptures about. Um, and if we can just apply these principles in our life to whatever it is that you have need of this morning. Maybe it's a backsliden loved one that you're praying for. Maybe it's a teenager that's struggling. Maybe it's a a financial situation. Maybe it's a a a decision about your dwelling place. Maybe you're praying about moving or or I know some travel distance and you're praying about moving closer or whatever it would be. Maybe it's a job change or maybe it's a school decision, where to send your kids to school or what college to choose for yourself. And and I want to place two principles before you this morning that I believe if we can apply these, not only will it take away a lot of our stress and anxiety over these things, but it'll equip us to just let God take care of things and and not beat our head against the wall. So, brother Bam said this this this uh power of committ was the the greatest weapon that he knew of to the Christian today was a committal to God. So, I want to look at this word and then it's going to break down into several other words that we're going to look at. The word committ Webster's dictionary, the word committ means commitment or consignment. The word commitment means an agreement or pledge to do something in the future or an act of committing to a charge or a trust. So in other words, for instance, if you uh maybe you own a little bit of property or you have some savings or investments and and you your wife and children are there and and you want it set up to where if anything happens to you that that is going to get dispersed in the way that you want it to be. And so you set up a trust for your family that even after you're gone, there are going to be people in charge of making sure that is taken care of. Then you don't worry about it anymore. You don't keep going back and looking. Now is that is that still there? It is a trust that has been established that you know if anything happens to you, it's taken care of. &gt;&gt; And so that's what a commitment is. An act of committing to a charge or a trust. Now it this word committ also means to consign which means to give over to another's care to give to transfer or deliver into the hands or control of another. Now, I just want to say as a pastor, uh, when you have deacon brothers and trustee brothers and you're praying about, Lord, who should I put in here or there or whatever it be, as a pastor, you're looking for somebody that you can commit something to that, well, uh, you know, I need the doors open at a certain time and, you know, you're not going to lay awake all night wondering, is brother so and so going to be there? You've committed it to him and you've got confidence in him. either he's going to be there or if he gets in a wreck on the way to church or whatever, he's going to contact somebody else to take care of it. I've got confidence in him. If something needs done, I can tell this brother, "Go do this." And I've got confidence in him. I can commit that to him that then I don't have to micromanage the situation because they're going to have the ability to take care of that. Now, if we can do that in the natural, then how much more to the Lord Jesus &gt;&gt; if we say we're going to commit something to him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm going to commit it to the Lord, Brother Nathan, and then you're trying to get involved in it and fix it the next day. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to lay it at the altar, Brother Nathan. And then the next day, you're back at it trying to get in the middle of it and fix it all yourself. &gt;&gt; That's not committal. &gt;&gt; That's right. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, these I I normally, you know, we would wait till the end of the sermon to kind of establish what what the whole of what we're trying to look at here. But I want to just give you early on just a sneak peek at at the two things that we're trying to establish. And then we're going to go over some quotes and scriptures to establish that. But the first principle that I want to establish this morning is don't plant a seed and then dig it back up and check on it. Don't plant a seed and then go out the next morning and say, "Well, I don't have a stalk of corn yet. I better dig it up and check it. Make sure make sure no animal got in there and ate on it or something." So, you dig it up. Yeah, it looks okay. Looks like a seed. And then you plant it again the next day. And then, well, I better check on it tomorrow. I don't see any sprouts or anything. Go back and dig it up the next day. That's not how seed planting works. That's right. &gt;&gt; The second principle that I want to establish with you with you which goes right along with it is this phrase commit it and forget it. &gt;&gt; Commit it &gt;&gt; and forget it. Now, we're going to look at some family things first because I feel like uh that is our greatest desire just like Hattie writes was uh prophet of God offered her speak anything that you want &gt;&gt; and you can have it. &gt;&gt; And she didn't say, "Oh, I'm going to be driving in a Rolls-Royce tomorrow." &gt;&gt; She didn't say, "Oh, I'm going to have a million dollars in the bank." &gt;&gt; She had a little crippled sister there. She had a elderly father there. She had things in the natural of physical healing that she could have asked. And brother Bam actually thought that it was going to be Edith that what she was going to ask. He said, "Oh, I thought in just a moment Edith is going to be standing out of that wheelchair who's been paralyzed with infantile paralysis her entire life." and Hadtie says, "The salvation of my children, &gt;&gt; the greatest desire that a a mother or father could have." &gt;&gt; And so many times in our family decisions, if we're not careful, we we try to be the one to well, we're going to fix this and we're going to help this and we're going to put our hand to this situation. But I want to look at some principles this morning that brother Benham sets forth for us. And he answers some wonderful questions and questions and answers along these lines. This one is just very much a natural thing that maybe you think if I could have asked the prophet something, this isn't what I would have asked for. But if you're in this situation this morning, maybe it is what you would have asked for. And they ask him, "Why can't we sell our house?" &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; They can ask him about the millennium. They can ask him uh h about you know what whatever they want to ask any great doctrinal question they they can ask him uh what about my future what about my children what about my health but this is what's pressing to them in this moment &gt;&gt; in this stage of their life why can't we sell our house we have prayed and fasted to sell it yet no results well I'm glad they asked him this question. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "Now, well, well, now brother or sister, they don't sign their name, whatever who it is." Now, you're trying to sell your property and you've done what you you want to sell it and probably for to buy some more or whatever you want to do. I don't know if if you want to if your objective is right, you're trying to buy a home. If you got children or something like that, you want to get them a better home or something. I don't know what it's all about, but I'd say this. If you're trying to sell it and fasting and trying to sell it, then commit it to the Lord and forget about it. &gt;&gt; Commit it and forget it. &gt;&gt; Now, notice he doesn't rebuke them and say, "Now, don't you know the scripture says you should just be content in what whatsoever state you're in? &gt;&gt; Why would you want a better house? &gt;&gt; Why would you want a better car? Why would you you know uh sometimes we can go out on extremes &gt;&gt; and then sometimes we can go out on the other extreme where we become just everything is material and monetary and that's our focus instead of things of God. But you know I never find it in the scripture where where we can't ask for something better. But it's that we're content in the state that we're in until God gives us something better. Not, Lord, I'm not satisfied with where I'm at, but Lord, you know, I appreciate what you've done for me, but I believe you've got something even better for me. That's all right to have that kind of attitude. &gt;&gt; Amen. Commit it to the Lord and forget about it. See, because it might be that God, you might move somewhere else and it might not be right. See, if you're a Christian and trust in the Lord, because you surely are, or you wouldn't be fasting and praying. See, &gt;&gt; so I just commit it to the Lord. Say, "Now, Lord, when you're time for us to sell it, you'll send a buyer. Then it's committed to the Lord. Take your hands off it and go ahead. I believe it'll work. &gt;&gt; I believe it'll work." &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, he's he's talking about that with something that's just a material thing, a home, but it's something that's important to them. We've tried to sell this house. We've prayed about it. We've fasted about it, and yet we don't see any results. And he tells them, just commit it and forget it. Now, he says in God's provided way in 1953, he's talking about about sister Rebecca, his his daughter, and he says she's already been committed to the Lord or we call it dedication. Already been committed to the Lord or we call it dedication. Now, I read this quote a while back and I was studying some things about the family. And I was reading along the lines that we're about to look at of things he says about Sister Rebecca when she's a teenager that I'm thankful that he was transparent enough to share those things with us about his family because then when your family or my family or somebody else's family goes through similar things, then we don't have to feel like, "Oh my goodness, we we just must be unbelievers. We just must be failures as parents or our children must be failures because they're not perfect. Well, you know, I haven't met a perfect child yet. &gt;&gt; And I haven't met a perfect parent yet. &gt;&gt; And you know what? I haven't met a perfect deacon or a perfect trustee or a perfect pastor. And I told somebody a while back, I said, if God gave you a perfect pastor, you wouldn't be able to handle it because you're not perfect and you wouldn't be able to relate to them. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, brother Brandham says she's already been committed to the Lord or we call it dedication. Now, I I find, you know, having teenagers myself now and you [clears throat] pray for me, I've got three teenagers right now in the house. And so, I've got a few more, you can see maybe since I was here last, I've got a few more white hair than I used to have. Some of you know what that's like. And God's blessed us with good children. But I [clears throat] haven't met a perfect teenager yet. &gt;&gt; I haven't met a perfect parent yet. And so in thinking of some of these things with our own children and in thinking of some of the things going on with some of the youth at our church and things like that, I I began to think about this and I ran across this quote and the parallel was was was just astonishing to me because you know when a when a child is brought into the world and and we're a believing family, a Christian family, a message believing family and that child gets up to be a few weeks old or a couple months old and you know we're we're feel like it's healthy enough to where we're not afraid to bring it around people. And and what do we do? We come in on a Sunday morning and that baby is dressed up in white frills to, you know, to the nines and and we've got it all dressed up and we bring it up here and we say, "Brother Jack, we want to have a baby dedication this morning." &gt;&gt; And brother Jack will get up and he'll take that baby and he'll begin to pray a prayer, something along these lines. Lord, we bring this child to give it back &gt;&gt; to the one who gave it. &gt;&gt; And I pray that you'll be with this family. I pray that you'll be in their home. That you'll place a hedge of protection around this child. That you'll be the unseen guest in the home. And that you'll be with this child. That you'll give the parents wisdom on how to train him. And that you will you will go before this child. and that you will not only be a blessing to this child, but use this child to be a blessing to others. &gt;&gt; And then we say, "Amen." We hand the baby back to the parents and they say, "Thank God because this child has been dedicated back to the one who gave it." And we just have this peace about it that my well, you know, we we as parents, God has given us this child and and we're going to try to raise it to the best of our ability. the child has been dedicated to the Lord and it just takes a little bit of pressure off off of us as parents but you know then that child becomes to be a teenager and when it you know when that child was an infant and couldn't feed itself and couldn't dress itself and we were the one that was kind of in control we didn't worry that child's been dedicated to the Lord everything's okay and then when it be to be a toddler and we had to kind of help it along and teach it how to walk and teach it how to put its arm arm in the sleeve of its coat and put its little shoes on and tie its shoes and feed itself and walk without tripping all over itself. And we begin to do that and we still had some involvement. And then the child got to be, you know, a pre-teenager and we were still involved. They'd come and ask us questions about their math or their English. And and sometimes you'd have to ask Sister Google to help you help them with their math or their English. and and you know and so they were still a little dependent on you and then all of a sudden they get a driver's license &gt;&gt; and a job &gt;&gt; and sudden somehow mysteriously overnight they know more than you do &gt;&gt; and brother Brandham got to this spot with sister Rebecca questions and answers 1964 and we're going to kind of just skip down through it and read a few different portions of it. He says, "I took took Ma about an hour and I said, "Ma, take your hands off." &gt;&gt; Now, here he is, a prophet of God. His wife knows he's a prophet of God. She even prayed when she wanted to marry him, and he was just kind of unsure about about it. He said, "Lord, you know, I'm gone so much and what would her life be like?" And he wasn't sure if he was going to marry or not. And and so she went and she began to open her Bible. She said, "Lord, I've never used the Bible as a Ouija board, but could you just give me some reassurance if he's going to be my husband? Can you show me something in the scripture that would encourage me?" And she opened up her Bible, and it fell to, "Behold, I send you Elijah the prophet." &gt;&gt; Well, that's pretty specific &gt;&gt; for a sister wanting to marry Brother Brandon. &gt;&gt; It don't get much more specific than that. And so they go and they're married and you know they're raising these children together and now sister Rebecca gets into her teenage years and she's taking piano lessons and they go down one day and she's playing piano with one of her friends down the street and they walk in and they are just shocked by what she's playing. Now by today's standards it would probably have been extremely mild but they were shocked by what she was playing on the piano. And so it just it breaks their heart and they they go and they they try to talk to her about it and she said, "Well, you just want me to be a wallflower and all these things and and and so sister me is upset." And and brother Brandham takes an hour. He doesn't just say, "Woman, just just shut up and stop acting emotional." He takes an hour talking to her, working through this with her. Honey, she's in this teenage life, this teenage stage. Don't you remember when you were a teenager? Don't you remember how you were with your mother? Uh oh. And and so so [clears throat] it took me to about an hour. I said, "Mita, take your hands off." &gt;&gt; Me, that's my kid. &gt;&gt; Oh my. When it gets quiet like this, I know I'm right where I need to be. &gt;&gt; When people are shouting and running the aisles, that means they're I'm getting somebody else and they're happy about it. &gt;&gt; But when everybody gets quiet, that means I'm getting them. me. That's my kid. I said, "Isn't it mine, too?" All right. I said, "If she was dying this morning, you'd have to commit her to God for her eternal destination. Why can't we commit her to God now for her earthly journey?" &gt;&gt; Now, again, as an infant child, no big deal. We come up when you don't you don't see parents coming up and I [laughter] gotta dedicate this baby. It's so hard, Brother Nathan. No, they got a smile on their face. &gt;&gt; Look at the dress we got her. &gt;&gt; Look at the little bow. She hardly has enough hair to keep it in. But isn't she cute? &gt;&gt; They're smiling. They're happy. You see somebody, their child laying there in the hospital and they don't know what direction they're going to go. my they're they're seeking God and they're saying, "God, Lord, whatever the outcome, we we want to see this child spend eternity with us. Lord, we want to make sure everything's right with them, whether they're physically healed or not. We just want to make sure that their soul is right and they commit that child to God. It's so easy to commit somebody to God when they're on their deathbed. &gt;&gt; But what about when they're just driving down the highway with their friends?" &gt;&gt; Job had to do it. He said, "Well, pre-adventure, they do something. I'm going to go down here and make a sacrifice." &gt;&gt; If she was dying this morning, you'd have to commit her to God for her eternal destination. Why can't we commit her to God now for her earthly journey? Now, he goes down a little further. He said, I said, "Wait a minute. We've raised her all we can. Now, put her in the hands of God. Commit her. And I said, "When she does anything, say, Becky, darling, mother don't want you to do that, but I'm your pal. I'll stick by you." See, let her know that you love her. &gt;&gt; Now, he didn't say, "Now, Becky, honey, you just do whatever you want. Jesus loves you and you can do, you know, you're the daughter of a prophet and everything's going to be okay. You just do whatever you want." No, that's not what he's telling her to say. He said, "You tell her, you know, we don't agree, honey, but I'm still your pal. You know, I don't want you to do that. You know, that's unpleasing to the Lord, but I'm still your buddy. I'm going to stick with you because I love you." &gt;&gt; He says a little further. So, we got we there got down on our knees and committed it to God. &gt;&gt; Committed to God. Now he says in this in this line of quotes here he tells sister me he said now honey he said you've got to think teenage thoughts. &gt;&gt; You've got to think like a teenager thinks. My goodness. And you know a lot of us I look back at me when I was a teenager. I was telling somebody the other day I said my goodness uh my kids haven't done a lot of the things I did when I was a teenager. &gt;&gt; So I'm blessed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so I I I look at this and he says, "Think teenage thoughts." He said, "You be," he said, "he needs somebody to show her love." And he said, "You be that one to show her love or she'll find somebody else &gt;&gt; to show her love." &gt;&gt; I see it's, you know, I I don't know if you see it here in Florida or not, but seems like there's a pattern back home where some of the so-called message believers, my their teenager starts to do anything and they just kick them out the door. And that's just, you know, well, you're not going to do that in my home. Bless God. Well, there's things that I I couldn't allow as a pastor in my home either, but I I believe I would be as long-suffering as I could. &gt;&gt; You know, even to husband and wife, the Bible said that the believing wife sanctifies the unbelieving husband. Didn't say just kick him out the door the first time he makes a mistake, but the believing wife sanctifies the unbelieving husband and vice versa. And and so there's something about it. I I see the attitude of some people towards their children or towards their friends or towards just random people in the message. Their attitude when anybody makes a mistake is so negative and so critical and so in the seat of the scornful and taking on the robe of the judge &gt;&gt; that I think how are you ever going to win that person back? The only way we'll win them back is by the love of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; being expressed through us. &gt;&gt; Not to condone their sins, not say, "Oh, honey, that's okay." No, it's okay to say, you know, we don't, you know, we don't believe that. You know, we don't live like that in this home, but I still love you, &gt;&gt; and no matter what you do, I'll love you, &gt;&gt; and I'll be standing here like the prodical son's father with my arms open welcoming you back. There was a person my a while back that they they thought they were going to do some great things for their family and wound up leading him into the world instead of leading him closer to the Lord like they thought they were going to do. &gt;&gt; And I told them I said they said, "Oh, our our family is is is better off now than they've ever been." I said, "Well, I don't agree with you on that." &gt;&gt; But I said, "What I will say is you'll never hear me say I told you so." &gt;&gt; Amen. Your children don't need to hear you say, "I told you so." &gt;&gt; See how wrong you were. &gt;&gt; How would you have received that as a teenager? &gt;&gt; I want to say too, church members don't need to hear us pastors say, "I told you so. &gt;&gt; I told you when you went down that path." No, they need to say, "Well, you know, well, we we did counsel you, but you know what? You're welcome back. &gt;&gt; We love you. &gt;&gt; We don't agree with sin, but the door is open." Amen. &gt;&gt; Questions and answers. 1964. Brother Brandham, I believe the message you teach with all my heart. It thrills my soul. However, my wife and son do not rejoice in the word. They do not desire to separate themselves from some of their worldly habits. You said that we should claim our families. I find that difficult to do. Don't you appreciate their honesty? I find that difficult to do. Anybody ever find that difficult to do? &gt;&gt; Oh, we're just going to claim our family. Oh, you know, our our loved ones is backsliden or turned away or whatever it be. I'm going to claim them. &gt;&gt; He said, I find that difficult to do. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Seeming that they do not live for the word or in the word. What is my course, sir? Do I claim them and believe or do I pray, "Father, thy will be done," and be content in the state I find myself in. I would appreciate your guidance, brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; God bless you, my brother or sister, whoever you may be. I would just commit them to the Lord. &gt;&gt; See, because what all the father has given me will come to me &gt;&gt; again. Questions and answers, part two, 1964. Dear brother Brandham, my wife and I were separated. She's suing me for a divorce. She's not a Christian and I believe the message and want her to be saved. Brother Ram stops reading the question. He says, 'Isn't that nice? That's a real Christian spirit. See, she's wanting to divorce him and he wants to see her saved. He says, "And believe. What must I do?" We also have two boys. Now, Brother Bam goes down a paragraph or two and he says, "If you worry, it'll break your health down." And that's what Satan wants to do. And the church said, &gt;&gt; "If you worry, it'll break your health." Oh, but brother Nathan, you just don't understand. You don't know how far my spouse has gone, or you don't know how far my child has gone, or you don't know how far my parents or my siblings or my aunt or my uncle has gone. Well, if you worry, it'll break your health down. And that's what Satan wants to do. He's working. I know at you. So you just commit the whole thing to God and go right on serving God. Just as happy as you can be, God will take care of the rest of it. &gt;&gt; All that the father has given me will come to me. &gt;&gt; Get down on your knees. I'll pray with you or anything. I'll pray over the matter. Just say, "Lord God, I love her. She's the mother of my children." If she is, and say, "I just commit the whole thing to you. Lord, I want them to be saved. You know I do, but I can't go no further. She's going to divorce me anyhow. I haven't done nothing. If I have, reveal it to me. I'll go make it right. I will do anything. Then commit it to the Lord and just let it alone. &gt;&gt; Then just let it alone. Go right on living just the same as nothing ever happened and God &gt;&gt; will take care of the rest of it. God will take care of the rest of it. &gt;&gt; Now, this is a formula that he keeps repeating to people with family problems. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, my child. Brother Brandham, my wife. Brother Brandham, my wife and son. And he keeps telling them, just commit it to the Lord. He talks about sister Rebecca when we went through this with our teenage daughter. We committed her to the Lord. If she was dying, you'd have to commit her to the Lord. As an infant, we committed her to the Lord. Why can't we commit them to the Lord for their earthly journey &gt;&gt; at thy word 1954? That's the most powerful weapon that God put in the hands of a man is a committal and a confession. It'll do it every time if you believe it and accept it on those basis and believe it and stay with it. Keep confessing it. The most powerful weapon is committ. Committ confession. Now, I find one of the hardest things for message believers to do, it seems, is to keep a positive confession. &gt;&gt; To keep a positive testimony. And we get prayed for and somebody asks us the next day, "How are you feeling?" "Oh, I don't feel any better." Well, uh, you're not going to if you keep that negative testimony. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said he was going down the road there and he had prayed and asked God to help him with the stomach ulcers and things. And he said he tried to eat that food and it kept trying to come up. He said we had a bouncing party there for a little while. Had his hand over his mouth and it kept trying to come up and he kept trying to swallow it back down. It's kind of graphic, but that's what the prophet said. &gt;&gt; And he said he was walking down the road and he was sweaty and clammy and his stomach bothering him. Somebody said, "How you feeling, Brother Brandham?" He said, "I feel wonderful. &gt;&gt; I'm healed." &gt;&gt; He said, "SOMEBODY SAID, "YOU LIED, Brother Brandham." He said, "No, you're looking at the symptoms. I was looking at the promise." &gt;&gt; So, it depends on what you're looking at this morning. &gt;&gt; Now, you can have a negative testimony. I don't feel saved. I I don't know if I got the Holy Ghost. I don't know if I got healed Friday night. I don't know. I don't know. And all the negativity. Well, I just I don't feel like I'm a very strong Christian, and I I I just can't seem like I can overcome, and I just seem like I struggle all the time, and it seems like I can't ever get ahead at work, and I can't ever do this, and I can't ever do anything, right? You realize that our our subconscious on the inside of us, there's brother Bam talks about those three gates. Uh there's there there's a gate in or the five gates to the flesh and the five gates to the spirit. But there's only one gate into the soul and that's self-will. And we choose that by either faith or doubt. &gt;&gt; And he he talks about in the greatest battle ever fought how there's a gate that opens and shuts that in your soul which is down in on the inside of your subconscious there there's a there's a gate that opens and shuts whether to believe something or whether to not believe it. And when you're just walking around self-deprecating all the time, I'm just a failure. I'm not a good mother. I'm not a good father. I'm not a good this. And and you're telling your subconscious that, your subconscious believes it. &gt;&gt; And that actually begins to shape your nature. &gt;&gt; But if you walk around, you begin to testify all the good things the scripture said about you. I'm victorious. &gt;&gt; I'm more than a conqueror through Christ Jesus. I'm an overcomer. I'm saved. I'm filled with the Holy Ghost. I'm healed by his stripes. My children are my inheritance. He promised to provide. He said, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and all these things will be added." He said, "All things are working together for my good." &gt;&gt; Then you believe that, too. &gt;&gt; And and the difference in the other things is the Bible actually says those things, but it's the devil telling you those other things. So who are you going to believe? &gt;&gt; The devil, the lie of the devil or the truth of God. &gt;&gt; And so we want to keep a positive testimony over us. Now there there was a man who who wrote a book called the power of positive thinking and he had a big mega church in New York and brother Bham actually went there, Norman Vincent Peele, and visited his church and and brother Bannam was very impressed with the way they had church order and things like that. But Norman Vincent Peele, I don't know if you've ever read the book, but I wouldn't really waste my time if if you h haven't. But, uh, the power of positive thinking, what he does is he actually takes some of the principles that Brother Brandham teaches us and he puts a little psychological twist to it. And what he's teaching is psychology that if you just say anything, then then you will eventually walk into that because you kind of name it and claim it is what we would call it. And and we you as message believers, you know, we don't believe name it and claim it. But we do believe if it's a scriptural promise, then we can name it and claim it. &gt;&gt; But we're not out here saying, "Oh, I'm going to name and claim a Ferrari or a 500,000 square foot house or whatever it be." No, we're not naming and claiming things that the scripture didn't promise. But if we have a need and there's a scriptural promise, then we can name that and claim that. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so there's a difference. So, brother Brandham is teaching us the power of positive confession. And he's telling us if we'll just he said the word will defeat the devil any place, any time, any conditions. And so, he's telling us the power of positive confess confession by confessing the scriptures over our life. Norman Vincent Peele is saying, "Oh, whatever you say, just the power of a positive thought. If you think it, you can manifest it." Well, that's not really the what the scripture is saying. But if God thought it, then you can manifest it &gt;&gt; because the devil might make you think anything and it might not be the will of God. &gt;&gt; So it's not the power of positive thinking. It's the power of positive confession of the wordise. &gt;&gt; Committ Proverbs 16:3 says, "Commit thy works unto the Lord, and thy thoughts shall be established." Second Timothy 1:7 says, "For God hath not given us the spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind." &gt;&gt; There's a brother from our church came up a while back just a he's just a lay member. He's not a deacon or a Sunday school teacher or anything, a minister. He's just a just a brother. And he got up to pray and he said, "God, I want to thank you for giving me a sound mind in an insane world." And I'll be honest, I didn't have my head bowed and my eyes closed. I was taking notes because I thought that's going to preach, Brother Jack. &gt;&gt; And I preached it at a youth camp in Vancouver. A sound mind in an insane world. &gt;&gt; God didn't give us the spirit of fear. I see people come through prayer lines and and and they're dealing with fear and with anxiety and with depression and with suicidal thoughts and all those things. And that those things are real. Those people are really going through that and the devil is bombarding them. But that is not God's will for your life. &gt;&gt; God does not want you. I see some people, they go to the doctor or they go to the psychiatrist or the psychologist or the counselor at school and and they get labeled with something and they begin to identify with that label. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm schizophrenic or I'm diabetic or I I I've got cancer. Or they begin to say, "Well, my cancer." No, it ain't your cancer. It's the devil's cancer. Don't call it your cancer. &gt;&gt; No, I No, I'm not a diabetic. I'm healed. &gt;&gt; The doctor diagnosed me with this, but but that's not my identity. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's okay. If I've got symptoms, I'm going to use wisdom and I'm going to try to to help the symptoms until I walk into my promise. I'm going to use wisdom, but I'm not going to be identified with that. I'm not going to take on that name. Well, you know, they said I'm bipolar or they said I'm, you know, this or that or I they said I've I've got, you know, extreme depression or extreme anxiety and so I guess that's just I guess I'll just take this little pill the rest of my life. You do not have to be identified &gt;&gt; whether it's mental sickness or physical sickness or spiritual sickness. Oh, I'm just an old drunk. No, you're not. The devil's tried to make you one, &gt;&gt; but don't be identified with that. &gt;&gt; Some people almost wear that like a badge of honor. Oh, I'm this, you know, they they diagnosed me as as this, and that's just No, don't don't. You don't want to be identified with that. &gt;&gt; God hath not given us the spirit of fear, &gt;&gt; but of power and of love and of a sound mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what God wants for his children. &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes even as as believers, I've noticed sometimes people and we're we're a little off track, but we're not completely. I &gt;&gt; I find sometimes people's identifications begin to be wound up in a title &gt;&gt; or in a person. &gt;&gt; And when you see that, they're bound for failure because God will not share his glory with anybody. &gt;&gt; And sometimes their identification is entitled. I'm well I'm a message believer. Well, hey, there were two million message believers in the days of Moses and most of them didn't turn out very good. So, it's not just enough, brother Bam said, it's not just enough to believe it. It's not just enough to be associated around it, but you have to actually become the word. You have to let it live through you. Amen. Oh, oh, I believe. He said, that's great. The devils believe and tremble. &gt;&gt; Some people they're identifying, oh, I'm a deacon. I'm a pastor. I'm an evangelist. I I'm a Sunday school teacher. I'm this. I'm that. Well, what if the what if time carries? And you know, if the Lord carries long enough, there's going to be a spot. I don't know if that's 73. I don't know if it's 84. I don't know if it's 62. I don't know what that age number is, but there's going to come a time where brother Jack and I are just going to realize, hey, we're just not able to really do the duties of a pastor justice like we should. And it's time to step into retirement. And maybe we'll still take some preaching engagements here and there as the Lord leads. But to take on the duties of a pastor is going to be hard. Well, if our identification is just wrapped up in I am a pastor, &gt;&gt; you're headed for depression. &gt;&gt; You're headed for walking around. I have no purpose in life cuz I'm not a pastor anymore. If your identification is wrapped up in being a deacon and then for some reason you're not eligible anymore or because of health issues you have to step away for a couple years and that was your whole identity then you're going to be walking around I just have no purpose cuz I'm not a deacon anymore. I'm not a Sunday school teacher anymore. or even as parents sometimes you see a mother who in that empty nest those children leave and her whole purpose for 18 or 24 or 30 years has been raising these children and being a mother and now she looks around what have I what have I got to do &gt;&gt; you're helping somebody brother Nathan &gt;&gt; because her whole identification was a mother &gt;&gt; and none of these things are bad things hey being a pastor is a wonderful thing. Being a deacon is a wonderful thing. Being a mother. Brother Brandham called you the fifth gospel. &gt;&gt; But if your whole identification is tied up in that or sometimes it's our spouse. Oh, if my husband died, I don't know how I can go on. Well, I wouldn't say that because God might smite him dead. &gt;&gt; Just to prove that, you know, it's not just him. He's not your savior. &gt;&gt; That Jesus is the one that our identification should be wrapped up in. that whether I'm a pastor or an evangelist or whether I'm sitting on the sidelines cheering somebody else on, whether I'm a deacon, whether I'm a janitor, whether I'm a lay member, whether I'm a Sunday school teacher, whether I'm a husband or whether I'm a father or whatever it be, whether the sisters, whether it's you're a mother or a wife or whatever, if your whole identification is wrapped up in that, OH, I'M A WIFE and I've tried to be the best wife that I can, and then your husband of of 40 years goes the way of the grave. If your whole identification was just I'm a wife, &gt;&gt; you're going to have a hard time. &gt;&gt; So, our identification should be wrapped up in the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He is my all. &gt;&gt; He is my everything. &gt;&gt; And when I'm in this season of motherhood, I want to be the best Christian mother that I can. When I'm in this season of being a wife to my husband, I want to be the best wife that I can. When I'm in this season of pastor, I don't want to take that lightly. I want to be the best pastor that I know how to be, the best deacon, the best evangelist that I know how to be. But when all that is said and done, and I can't do that anymore because my mind begins to slip or my body begins to fail or or the church falls apart or whatever it be, then my identification cannot just be in a title or a person except the person Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Questions and answers, part one, 1964. Remember the Philippian jailer. Believe for both of you. If you've got enough faith for your own salvation, can't you have the same faith that'll work for your people? One of the meanest men in town, 1961, say, when a man gets saved, does that save his house? No. But if he's got enough faith to get saved himself, he's got enough faith that his house house will be saved also. &gt;&gt; The same faith that saved him, that's what that mother thought in the grave long ago. But her prayers just was answered. &gt;&gt; Questions and answers, part three, 1964. What must I do for my family? Use the same faith that you're using for yourself, for your family. Commit them to the Lord and believe with all your heart that you're going to be saved. Oh my. Let me read you this one. Resurrection of Jeras's daughter, 1954. I found out this in my 21 years of experience of preaching the gospel. Any job that's too big for me, excuse me, any job that's too big for my Lord to attack, what's the use of me trying it? &gt;&gt; I just let him have it. So, see, just commit it to him. He promised to take care of me. &gt;&gt; When opposition comes, I just commit it to him. You see, many times if we're not careful, and this is the parents, this is the preachers, this is to lay members. Every one of us have been guilty of things like this. We we we're up against something and we're trying to find the will of God and we've prayed and we've sought and we've begged and we pleaded with him and we do like brother Brandham taught about trying to find his perfect will. We try to stay neutral and we we try to do our best and and and we finally just say, "Lord, I I've done all that I know how to do. Now, I'm just going to lay this before you. I'm going to commit it to you. I Lord, I've interviewed the best that I know how. I've put in job applications the best that I know how. Now, I' I've got these multiple job offers out here and I don't want to just run after the the biggest dollar amount, but Lord, is that going to take me away from church or is that going to take me away from my family more than I need to be? Or Lord, what is your will for the perfect thing for my life? Lord, I'm going to commit this to you and see how you lead. or I'm going to commit this backsliden child or or or this backsliden spouse or or this family financial situation or this medical need. Lord, I commit it to you and then the next day you're out there with your hands in it meddling again. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; As pastors, it's very easy for us if we're not careful. Sometimes a situation will come up in the church and somebody say, "Brother Jack, you need to take care of that. You need to deal with that." And if we're not careful, we put our hands to something. Brother Nathan, oh, you better you know about this situation. You better you better deal with that. Don't you think you should preach something about that? Yes, when the Lord leads me to. &gt;&gt; Not when Sister Suzy or &gt;&gt; whoever leads me to. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I'll preach on it when the Lord lays it on my heart. We'll deal with it. But I found pastoring I guess 14 years now. Not as long as brother Jack, but 14 years is a long time in any job, let alone being a pastor. And I found pastoring 14 years. There's many times I I would say 90% of the time, if we'll just give God a little bit of time, then God's just going to work that out. &gt;&gt; And sometimes if we put our hand to it too quickly, we'll make a mess of it. And then there's another 10% of the time where we wait on the Lord and he says, "Oh no, I'm waiting on you on that one. &gt;&gt; You're going to have to do that one. You're going to have to sit in that tough meeting and you're going to have to go to that tough coffee and you're going to have to tell that person what I laid on your heart." We think, "Oh Lord, couldn't it be somebody else?" &gt;&gt; Having the We talked about that simplicity of being able to follow the Holy Spirit, the leading of the Holy Spirit. My &gt;&gt; Let me skip a couple of these and we'll we'll try to wind this up. Believest thou this. 1950. Now, what does the farmer do? He sews the wheat. Well, look for the harvest. The next morning, what if he goes out there and uncovers it? Says, "Why, it ain't sprouted. There's nothing to it. So, I I ain't got going to have no wheat." Well, if he isn't going to have any wheat, if he keeps he if he isn't going to have any wheat, if he keeps digging it up, looking at it, he will never have wheat. &gt;&gt; You just sew it and let it alone. &gt;&gt; Show us the father and suffice of this. 1950. Every time you dig it up, you delay it that much more. &gt;&gt; It'll never grow if you keep digging it up. Time of decision. 1959. Every time you dig it up, it delays it another day. And every time you look at your symptoms, it delays you too in your healing. &gt;&gt; But I don't feel any better. But I don't see any change. But what did the word say? By his stripes, I'm healed. &gt;&gt; Hear ye him. 1957. You hinder it every time you dig it up. You place it in the ground, commit it to the ground, forget about it. It's up to God to do the rest. Now, I know I know there are circumstances that we go through where it's it's hard sometimes for us. We read scriptures and oh, it's a good scripture and we can put it on our refrigerator or our mirror, but then sometimes putting that into action, we have a hard time. And you know, one of those scriptures, it's hard when you're going through a trial sometime to really understand. Romans 8:28 was my mom's favorite scripture. All things work together for good. &gt;&gt; Didn't say all things were going to be good all the time. &gt;&gt; But said all things work together for our good. &gt;&gt; You know, we we all say, "Well, I want to be more like Jesus. I want to be a better Christian." You know how we do that? By building character. You know how character is built? By trials and by suffering. &gt;&gt; And so, we all want to be more like Jesus. But nobody says, "Oh Lord, give me more trials. Give me more suffering." But brother Bam said in the church age book, that's how that character is developed through suffering the same way that the Lord Jesus developed it. And and so we go through those things and Peter would say, "Our trials are more precious to us than gold." And we read that and it's a good scripture, but my you know, I don't know about you, when when we were going to, you know, uh when they were just giving money away, you know, we go out to the mailbox and there'd be another stimulus check. I I'm I'm not much of a dancer really, you know. I I didn't dance in the world and I don't dance a whole lot in church, but my I might have did a few little steps on the way back to the house from the mailbox when we got those checks. &gt;&gt; All right, &gt;&gt; another stimulus check. Should have had more children, brother Jack. Some of these people at our church with six kids and things, my they were just raking in the money. And I thought, do I get that happy in the middle of a trial? &gt;&gt; Do I get that happy when I'm being persecuted &gt;&gt; or when I'm suffering for the gospel's sake? &gt;&gt; Because Peter said, "Our trials are more precious to us than gold." &gt;&gt; And we look at this scripture, all things work together for good. Well, there's things we go through and if we'll be honest, we're asking, Lord, how can this be for my good? You remember brother Brandham when Sharon Rose passed away he he didn't understand how that could be for his good until years later he looked back and he understood that took him years and years to understand how can this be working for my good. There's many things we go like through like that. My best friend growing up he he used to have a statement he didn't realize at the time it was just confirming scripture but he he used to make this statement. He said if anything goes wrong it goes wrong in Nathan's favor. I said, "Well, all things work together for good &gt;&gt; to them that love the Lord." &gt;&gt; If we could have that kind of attitude, &gt;&gt; if it goes wrong, it's going wrong in my favor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I told that to our church. I told that to our church and a brother at our church said, "I've seen it." He said, "Even CO worked in Brother Nathan's favor." &gt;&gt; Amen. Some of the Lord just blessed us during during CO, not I'm not talking about the physical sickness and stuff, but but during CO there was just some so many things. We we had time to do different things that we didn't have time to do before and and got to looking at different things and and we hadn't ever refinanced our house in years and was able to refinance our house and pay off some things and double up on our house payment from what we'd been paying on those other things and get our house paid off early and and and the Lord blessed us financially during co the way that some things fell with the stimulus checks and things being able to use that to pay off debt. Hey, sometimes even things that look dark and look terrible, God can use it to be a blessing. You remember when Abraham went down there with with Pharaoh and and he told that lie and said that's my sister and then he turned around did the the same thing with another king there and and and you know it looked like he was going to get in trouble and here he was brother Bam called him a lying prophet and but you know if you go back and read the message brother Brham said you know why God allowed all that he allowed that famine to come that pushed him into Egypt and different things he said God knew that Abraham needed a financial blessing &gt;&gt; and when he leaves leaves Aimilec. Aimilec said, "Hey, take these cattle and take these sheep. Let me let me bless you. [laughter] Just leave." &gt;&gt; God knew Abraham needed a financial blessing, so he let him go down through there and go through all that. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you're going through something. You think, "Why on earth am I going through this?" &gt;&gt; God's got a blessing &gt;&gt; with your name on it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We We heard you all sing that song. I do that to brother Jack all the time. God's got a Cadillac with your name on it. &gt;&gt; God's got a new suit with your name on it. &gt;&gt; God's got a church building with your name on it. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Spirit and truth tabernacle. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. My May it be in the spirit of prophecy. &gt;&gt; I will restore 1954. Commit it to God and leave it there. Time of decision 1959. Just commit it to your heart and forget about it. God and his people 1950. But you can't he can't do it until as long as you're holding it. Say, "Now I will see if I'm any better and see if this will work." You commit it to him. Forget about the rest of it. Go testifying of things you don't even see. &gt;&gt; That's what blind John Ryan did. You remember? &gt;&gt; He said, "I thought you said I was healed." Brother said, "I thought you said you believed." &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, what can I do?" He said, "Go testifying everywhere. Thank God for healing me." &gt;&gt; He went around everywhere, even in the meeting. Thank God for healing me. Went down on the street selling newspapers. Extra, extra, READ ALL ABOUT IT. THANK GOD FOR HEALING ME. &gt;&gt; And his barber was going to make fun of him. He said, "I heard you got healed down there at that Holy Roller Revival." He said, "YES, THANK GOD for healing me." And his eyes came open. &gt;&gt; And one day, you're going to testify &gt;&gt; God's did it for me. God's victorious. God's brought me through. And brother Bam said, God will make your body obey your confession. &gt;&gt; And one of these days, you're going to speak it and it's going to manifest. &gt;&gt; Let me say this. Musicians, go ahead and come to the instruments. We're trying to close. Your circumstances are temporary, &gt;&gt; but his presence is permanent. &gt;&gt; He said, "I'll never leave you. &gt;&gt; I'll never forsake you." Amen. &gt;&gt; I I see sometimes in young people in prayer lines. Um you you you see so much anxiety and depression and suicidal thoughts and people struggling with that. We actually dealt with a situation here a few years ago at a youth camp. There was a a sister with an actual demonic manifestation speaking out of her and fighting us and things like that. And we were trying to narrow down what it was. And we finally narrowed it down. when when we started talking to her about suicide, that demon really went went berserk and we knew that's that's what she was dealing with. And then we found out her sister who the enemy had tried to hide it a little better in her was facing the same thing, suicidal thoughts because of things that they'd gone through in their past. And I tell people, you know, that's a permanent solution to a temporary problem. And it is it's a very it's a very selfish thing. We've seen people do that and it's very selfish because then their family is left. You just pass that pain on to them that then they're they're they're devastated with what could we have done different? What could we have said different? How could we have handled this different? Could we have spotted things earlier? I was in a prayer line here uh this summer and and a young girl came up and was dealing with that. was talking with her family afterwards and they they said we we could tell she had been down for a while kind of discouraged but we didn't know that that she was battling those type of things but you know what many times it's because the devil tries to isolate us and maybe not even physically isolate us but in our mind isolate us away from everybody else. Nobody cares. Nobody understands. Nobody loves me. Those are lies of the devil. Nobody's ever gone through what I've gone through. That's not what the scripture said. Said nothing has fallen you what's just as common to man. And the Lord Jesus went through those things too. He faced those same battles. You know, a pastor brother was telling me a while back about something that is astounding to me. Uh I never thought of it this way, but he was talking on the phone with a man who was battling a homosexual spirit. And he he was trying to encourage the brother. The brother was wanting to be delivered and he said, "Brother," he said, "you know, I I've never battled that that spirit, so it's hard for me to relate, but I can pray for you and sympathize with you." And and he said, "Just as I said that, the Holy Spirit spoke to my heart and tell him, say, I have. I've battled that." And he thought, "The Lord Jesus battle that type of a thought or that type of a spirit." And his mind went back to the scripture, he was tempted in all manners. &gt;&gt; So everything that you go through, he's faced that temptation &gt;&gt; so that he could be the right type of intercessor for you. And he loves you and his children love you. And don't believe the lie of the devil. Your symptoms are temporary, &gt;&gt; but his presence is permanent. Let's bow our heads together. Lord Jesus, we thank you, Lord, for how you've moved in the service today. Lord, I pray that it strengthens this group of believers here in Florida. Father, I pray that it's a help to them. I pray that it's an encouragement. Lord, I pray we all go from here strengthened, Lord, and a little closer to you than when we came in. Lord, we give this service to you, Lord. We thank you for all that you do. We thank you for your mercy and your grace. Lord, I pray if there's any here today that were battling any of the things that we we looked at this morning, how that maybe they're having a hard time fully committing something to God, maybe they keep digging up things that maybe even old hurts and things like that that instead of just burying those things under the sea of forgetfulness and keeping them under the blood, they keep digging them back up and it causes bitterness and it causes hurts. Father, I pray that you'd be with them. Help them to be able to commit those things to you, Father. Grant it, Jesus. Lord, we give this service to you, Lord. I pray you would do the part that only you can do, Lord. The supernatural, Lord, if there's healing that's needed, if there's victory that's needed, I pray that you'd come and quicken that to your children by the power of the Holy Ghost in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Let's try this together as brother Jack comes. Oh, it's amazing [singing] grace. Oh, how sweet the sound. I know it saved [singing] a rich like me. Was lost but now I'm found. was blind, but now I see. Come on, praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Oh, praise God. [music] Praise [singing] God. Well, praise [music] God. Praise God. Praise [screaming] God. Oh, praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. [music] Oh, praise [singing] God. Praise God. Praise God. Amen. Just keep playing [music] softly. Let's give the Lord a hand of praise for the word of the Lord. Amen. Onto today. Thank God for this um word from heaven, the power of [music] committ. And and I know um that was if it wasn't for nobody, it was for [music] me because I I I I need to be reminded once you take your hands off, don't go back. Just I mean just really just give it to God and forget about it. Lord, I needed that. Thank you. Thank you, Lord, for speaking to me. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I wanted to we just just got a few minutes before we have to leave, but um I wanted to mention some of the saints were not able to make it here on Friday night. And um I uh I didn't announce it last Sunday because it didn't come to me. [music] But as I was studying uh on Tuesday night, getting ready for Wednesday night, uh I was going through my notes and and I noticed in my notes I had [music] a testimony that had happened years ago uh with me and brother Nathan and uh we were in um in Indiana. My wife had lost her telephone and uh she misplaced it. We [music] couldn't we didn't we just didn't know what had happened or where it was. So she said, "When y'all take the rental car back, please look in the rental car to see if y'all can find it." So we both looked, eyes everywhere. And &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; uh and we couldn't find it. So brother Nathan said, "Let's pray. Let's pray before uh uh we do anything else." [music] And he prayed and in his prayer, he uh prayed that Lord, you allowed uh Saul to find his his mules that were lost. and uh [music] we believe you to be the same God today as you were back then. And we were just preparing to read that scripture, that story in the scripture on [music] Wednesday night. So when he prayed that prayer, he says, "Lord, we know that you know where the telephone is and you if you could let Saul find the muse, [music] you'll let us find the telephone." Soon as he said, "Amen, open our eyes and looked there in the car." It was a little pocket there in the car. And we looked in that pocket before and didn't see it, but after prayer, [music] it showed up in that pocket. Amen. [applause] And um so it reminded me, [music] you know, of um you know, just how the Lord has used our brother. Many times God has honored his prayers. [music] I mean, he's prayed for many sick people here. Uh Sister Tanya was dealing with [music] uh uh cancer and uh he prayed a prayer and God healed her of cancer. [music] Uh, I mean there's there's many others that have testimonies where God has touched them. [music] And uh, I wanted to just offer uh, while we got just a little time, those that were not here on Friday night, [music] if you would like to come and just receive prayer for something while the ministry is here, and I know God honors his prayers. We've had people come in uh uh in our prayer lines here at Spirit [music] of Truth, people that couldn't have babies and God blessed their unions uh and gave [music] them start giving them children. Brother Joe Underwood and his wife, Sister Rebecca, they had seven years without children and uh and they come through a prayer line and God God blessed them. [music] So, we know God hears uh our brother's prayer. And uh if you would just mix your faith with uh with what God has done in his life, [music] I believe God can do something for you. So, if there's anybody that would like to have prayer, uh I just want you to line up right here on the right side, right over here. Just line up real quickly because I won't have much [music] time. But if you want prayer, just line up right there. Just stay there. The deacon will bring you one second, sis. One second. Anybody else that want prayer, just line up behind our sister. [music] The deacons will anoint you with all. If you if you want prayer, come to this line over here. If you want prayer, come to this line. Amen. The deacon will anoint you with oil and we'll have you [music] uh come for prayer. Amen. Praise the Lord. All right. Glory to God. Amen. Amen. [music] Those that are in seats, uh you can just be seated if you just keep your heads bowed. Amen. While we pray for these, Amen. that are coming through. Uh Amen. We'd appreciate that. Glory to God. Amen. Amen. [music] Brother Solomon, you can just come and lead. Amen. In the songs. Amen. All right. But now I see through day and I [singing] have Jesus and grace [music] will lead Amazing. Grace, how sweet I need. on Rose. All things are possible. Holy believe. Believe all things are possible.

Agreeing with what God's word has said concerning us, it says it might not happen immediately, [music] &gt;&gt; but it's over right after the prayer of faith is prayer of faith has been prayed. Amen. We declare whatever you have need of. Amen. It's over. &gt;&gt; It's over. We thank God. We thank God for brother Nathan. Amen. And him coming and pressing his way. And what a blessing he has been. Amen. To us. Y'all keep them in prayer. They'll be heading [music] back uh north. Amen. A little bit later today and trying to make it home by tomorrow to Indiana. So keep them in your prayers. [music] Amen. Uh, I also want to make mention, I know Sister Zelma had put in a prayer request. She sent in a request and I wanted her to know [music] because she was watching online. We did pray for her request. Brother Nathan and I prayed [music] for it uh before we came out and I just kind of told him a little bit about her need. Uh, but in his prayer, he prayed. He said, "Uh, father, even if you have to uh uh use the [music] mechanic to to do her job for free and and and and I didn't tell him that she was actually waiting on the mechanic's boss to come back home so the mechanic could talk to the boss, amen, about her car." But he prayed in his prayer that God if [music] they have to just do it for free just to be a blessing to her then I say Lord we'll receive it. We'll receive it. Amen. So the prayer of faith has [music] gone forth and even she had a desire for a job. Amen. On this side and so brother Nathan come right out here at the beginning of the sermon start talking about you know people might need a job you know because they they they want to relocate. He said that right at the beginning I said that was for sister Zelma. wasn't even here personally, but she was online and that was just for her. So, we just thank God. We thank God for the job that our sister needs. Thank God for her car getting fixed. We thank God. Amen. In advance, he's mindful of every need. So, God is God is God is moving, church. God is moving. Amen. We'll be back on on Wednesday night. Amen. At &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; um 7:30 uh for our time of uh service there. So, uh we look forward to seeing you there. Let us have a word of prayer. [music] The brothers will come at this time uh to dismiss you. Amen. We'll have a word of prayer before we're [music] dismissed. Father, we thank you, oh God, for um all that you have done. Lord, I believe that as we [music] come according to your word, that Lord, we commit it to you knowing that you will bring your [music] word to pass. Every promise that you've made, not one will fall to the ground and return void, but it will accomplish the very purpose [music] and intent that you have sent it forth into the earth to accomplish. We pray your blessings upon our precious brother Nathan. Thank you for this great sacrifice to [music] press through what he was feeling in his body to bring us the words of life. And Lord, we we have been strengthened and encouraged by both sermons, oh God. And Lord, we we leave here, Amen, better [music] Christians because of what we've heard. We ask, oh God, that as as he prepares to get on the road with his precious son that you would go before them, [music] that you would give them traveling mercies. That you would continue to touch his body and Lord, watch over his wife and his other children and the church back home, Lord, and that [music] when he gets back that everything will be running smooth, oh God, there'll be no issues. Bless us as we leave this place, [music] but not your presence. God, may you bring us back again at the appointed time on Wednesday night.
