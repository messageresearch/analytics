feel kind of nervous too I feel I feel like I'm up in Arkansas all over again Amen Let us uh let us uh we appreciate the Lord this morning get our Bibles out we appreciate all of the prayers of of the Saints I tell you what I I felt every prayer last weekend in in um Arkansas my uh my my plane flights went well and I don't fly too good but I flew I said man I'm G have to start just making sure I get a whole lot of prayer when I'm traveling I about need prayer when I'm preaching period I almost put put it on the on the request for the brothers this morning you know brother Jack them gone and um but I'll tell you what we had a wonderful wonderful time God really God really uh spoke to the people and it's it's good um I got some gang when you can get feedback from the Saints and uh one sister came up we had a little prayer line and uh some of the things that we prayed for you just knew it was God and uh uh one of the preachers said now if y'all if y'all need for me to tell y'all what the brother preached and y'all come to me cuz y'all know what he preached was on the word and it it was timely once sister said uh uh what you preach is verbatim words that I spoke to my oldest son last night only God can do that you know that that that didn't surprise me because I you know God has used me in that way so many times over the years people that say brother SM I know you wasn't in the house with us last night no sure it wasn't I was in my bed sleeve man you Wen in the car NOP was in the car with you while y'all was riding talking but only God knows how to uh how to do do things let's let's read St John chapter 4 and uh y'all pray for me this morning uh I'm just trying to get the nervousness out of the way and uh then we'll see what the Lord has to do for us this a scripture that we we uh use used on um our last time preaching here St John chapter 4 uh let's start at the sixth verse it says now Jacob's Well was was there and Jesus therefore being weary with his journey sat thus on the well and and it was about the sixth hour and there cometh the woman of Samaria to draw water and Jesus said unto he'll give me the drink for his disciples was gone away into the city to buy meat then said the woman of Samaria unto him how is it that thou being a Jew askes drink of me which am a woman of Samaria for the Jews have no dealings with the samarians and Jesus answered and said unto her if thou knoweth the gift of God and who it is that saith to thee give me the drink thou would have asked of him and he would have given thee living water and let's just maybe skip over to the 23rd verse same chapter but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers worship the father in spirit and in the truth for the father seeks such to worship him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him and spirit and Truth the woman said unto him I know that Messiah cometh which is called the Christ when he is come he would tell us all all things and Jesus said unto her I that speaketh unto thee am he and upon this came the disciples and Marvel that he talketh with the woman yet no man see uh what seeketh thou or why talk thou with her and let us get another scripture while we we have you standing this morning uh oh my St John chapter 3 in verse uh 15 that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten uh Son of God and this is the condemnation that light is comeing to the world and Men love Darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil let us uh bow our heads gracious father we just thank you once again for allowing us this opportunity to be in the service of the Living God this morning and uh we just want to remember the saints that um in Indiana this weekend trust that they're having a wonderful time there um celebrating with uh Becca and uh her husband oh God this weekend and uh we just pray that you anoint us a fresh Lord give us fresh anointing fresh inspiration oh God for this morning service bless your people that are here that have gathered not to hear from a man but to hear from God and uh we be so careful to give you praise Glory and Honor in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord it uh I I want to use as uh my topic this morning understanding what it means to be redeemable part two and um as a context um to our our text this morning y'all bear with me um God comes because he cares Hallelujah and uh I wanna I want to just kind of start out saying a few things this morning before we just kind of um uh get into our our subject this morning um it's it's just a few things that we said when we was in Aransas and I've probably said it here uh and uh I I was just kind of thinking about some things that oh as as I'm also getting started I appreciate the brothers in there their Tex is uh this this last week um but uh it's a few things that you know um I guess for me I I think a certain way and and just looking at scripture and and just understanding Ministry and uh y'all probably wonder why sometimes I say the same thing all the time because I I I do it for a purpose because I want things to register right sometimes I remember uh brother rblo said this years and years ago he say sometimes you you something is need to be said a thousand times maybe in order for it to actually register uh cuz sometimes you know we'll hear certain things and we forget if y'all like me before we get out the door you know by the time I get out the door sometimes I forgot everything I done say it that's just how our memory works but I think sometimes um when when we hear things on a consistent basis it it it gives it an opportunity to really be implanted in our heart um and and and that's important because we're we're we're living in in a age of where we got to overcome right brother is that right every every dispensation has been a dispensation of of overcoming that's right brother right right and and and you know y'all know I enjoy emotions but I realize that that you know sometimes you don't even feel emotional right we sometimes we come to church and we don't even feel like giving God praise right but you know what I realize you know in our emotions it has nothing to do with our our understanding TR right cuz it takes our standing to elevate us that's right is that right when when when when we going through trauma and things of that nature our our emotions aren't a giddy not there something going wrong in your head y'all ought to talk to me this morning you know when when when you sad you know you you you're you're going through mental battles we know the greatest battle is fought is in the mind is that right and and and there's I forgot the statistics on it where there's so many thoughts that go through the human mind amen uh in the Run of a day yes sir how how many negative thoughts that that goes through our mind through the through the Run of a day Lord right how many positive right so so you know uh it it takes the revelation of the word of God right right right to be preached yes sir yes sir right it's it's it's important I know sometimes uh people might feel like you know well you guys need to tone it down a little bit and maybe you guys aren't you shouldn't say certain things is that right that's not the case that's not a realistic thought sir because I believe that God allows God allows the ministry to say uh what's necessary and what's needed for our benefit sir to to benefit us if if not now maybe somewhere down the road sir is that right so so you know uh sometimes it it it appears like man brother Jack is being being uh difficult or he's being he's being a little harsh no he's not no sir no he's not because because every every word that's preached right not false Doctrine but every word that's preached is necessary sir for it we we benefit amen that's the truth brother right I was telling somebody you know um I was saying that you know it's it's like uh the the pharmacist they take and and they put uh what's necessary in medication to benefit us is that right yeah and see we can't be smarter than the people who study and go to school for for years and years and years say well you know that pill don't take uh uh um you know all of all of that just maybe we'll take take some of this out what you trying to do kill yourself right because they put so much of you know and we we've heard this we've heard this from a prophet right what's in it is necessary right right that's that's like trying to take your radiator out your car see how far you going to get well this radiated ain't really necessary well you'll see in about a good five or 10 minutes how necessary and and the thought the thought that went into that yes sir right the actual thought that that these these uh uh Engineers uhuh right put into uh calculating and all of this kind of stuff right and placing all of it especially in the days cause with all of these computers right every every uh computer is necessary to the functioning of the car sir when one of them go out your car is affected it get to doing one of these numbers and you get to Lord what's oh God right y'all know what I'm talking about I'm still moving I'm trying to get out the way this morning right but but I I you know for me I I felt to say this this morning so because you know you you want to uh understand ministry right Ministry is not like some Doty uh grandfather right we we it's important for y'all to understand that we must be consistent right yes sir for for our benefit things things are said and and it it's so it's so many spirits and so many things that we we come in contact with so so it's necessary when when we were on our trip uh a young fell he was struggling with you know uh stuff on the in there I'll just leave it right there so y'all catch it if you can catch it right it it was a young sister got into the prayer line and and and she wanted prayer uh nice looking sister young sister but she was struggling in her mind with with her DNA Lord right right y'all know what I'm talking about it it was it was a real it was a real struggle of and it's more so now for this generation than it what it was for Our Generation right right it's like whether not not I'm a girl or whether not I'm a boy Lord right just to kind of make it plain of whether or not I supposed to like a girl whether or not I supposed to like a boy right right and I and I kind of like what brother Quint was talking about patterns yes sir right so I maybe I'll drop in there in a second but so that we'll we'll we'll see why why it's it's necessary not it's not something where we're trying to be critical right right or demeaning it it's words that's being preach so that so that we could stabilize and be stable and be settled and that that we're given something uh to combat come on that's it right brother brand talked about the combat Beast right well we we've been given an eagle anointing sir in the Eagle age and Eagle mentality right yes sir to show us what's necessary and and the attack upon the Eagles in this evil age yeah I thank God for an eagle anointing sir I thank God for the combat Beast right right brother the unveiling of the Mighty God yes sir glory to his wonderful name I'm starting to feel something now right glory to God and you ought to too yes sir see it it should be a complete support right a complete support uh of the ministry that's trying to bring you complete Insight yes sir cuz it it's needed when when when you going through your greatest battles when you struggling whether I to go to church and and and whether I not ought to go to church right right right glory to God it's it's a it's a real it's a real battle some of us may not have the same battles but we we have our we have our our battles amen is that right you know when when when we we look at when we look at this this woman of the whale all right it's just something that I picked up um last week as as I was approaching the subject uh uh of up there you know uh God cares Church yes he does God God comes because he cares amen and and like brother Quinton was saying you know you you got to go back and pick up the patterns in scripture right amen if if we look back to the Book of Genesis right what what we find is we find out that you know what God God cares right in creation we we find the care of God we we find the the the love of God Amen you know cuz in this hour the devil wants to tell us God don't care about you God don't love you well if he didn't he wouldn't have come down that's right true glory to God he he wouldn't have he wouldn't have gone through uh all of what he went through we we look back in the Book of Genesis and and we see the love and care of God right from creation is that right when when when when God was creating the Earth he had us in his mind amen right amen I don't know how I'm going to go this morning but y'all pray for me he he had me in his mind in creation you know knowing that you know I Would One Day come from his mind I would get in a body glory to God is that right you know God God in creation realized his his his thoughts would become word and word will become manifestation right in the form of a church in the form of a family come on Amen when we look back to Genesis glory to God you know and watch watch the love of God the love of God sets boundaries Hallelujah G and and folk don't like boundaries folks folks don't like order right right but if the God's Heavenly Host gets out of out of order yes sir right when when there's no order what do we have chaos right yes sir that's all we got we got we got chaos see so so God right now watch patterns brother Quinn just preached that the other night watch watch the patterns as they unfold down through scripture yes right we you know even now we we've been preaching on Redemption right and bringing back and things of that nature yes sir then you got to follow a pattern glory to God of of when the first church got out of Step come on the first church got out of Step they they broke they broke the the the standard they they broke the word right right that day you eat there okay right that they and it shows you I want you to understand something and this good for the Young Generation right because sometimes and pick it up and tie it into this this woman over here right um it's important as a Young Generation and as a old to understand the importance of boundaries it's important for couples to understand the importance of boundaries right right the importance of order the importance of structure right cuz God is not the god of confusion not at all see I I'm like God I don't like confusion I don't like mess I don't like messy stuff right amen I I like things to be in order right things to be be proper right brother amen right because because right be before the order was broken look how they existed M I come to preach this morning I don't know what y'all come to do look look how they existed before the Fall Right In Harmony and Oneness boy Lord have mercy don't you just like that kind of atmosphere Church to to be able to exist where there's no drama right right amen glory to God where there's no drama no funny feelings no you know glory to God see those things exist watch the pattern now thank you brother Quinton uh be because order is broken right amen standards are broken when when we start appealing to our own ideas we we start to reasoning and getting in our feelings and things of that nature this when we start to have our problems then then we we go from an from a Eden to chaos right glory to God Amen then this is where this is where our world gets turned upside down come on somebody right when when when the word is you know sat down and we step over it Lord you looking for problems right you looking for problems and see this is the thing you know I I've been had this in my spirit for a little minute you know and and and this is the thing that you you you try to share with with all of us right I know that most of us adults we've got gone through our challenges we done faced a lot we done faced a lot of things that you know our youngsters are facing or going to face right but see what you say what what what's what's going on brother Smiley we're trying to give us something to elevate us right right yes sir to elevate us so that we could overcome and we're not uh stereotyped by the things that we see transpiring in this this dispensation that we're living in glory to God we're not a a statistic we don't become a statistic of of unwed motherhood y'all ought to talk to me now don't quit on me y'all come on we we we you don't see you young sisters don't want to become uh that kind of Statistics amen right it it's not even necessary right right and and the same goes for the young fellas you know um it it's not it's not a it's not a real uh thing you know when you feel like you out there you're just doing your thing and and see that just shows that just shows you the where people are in their thinking and why brother brandham talked about you know and preaching uh uh the different things of demonology and and and how people are insane see is most of the world is insane yes sir most of the world supposed to be should be locked up right it's the truth brother right it's the truth anyhow yes it's the truth because if if if we're basing it upon the word of God most of the world is insane and don't realize it if you listen if you listen to the the thinking of the majority of of the world and I'm talking about psychiatrists and psychologists smart so-called smart people they insane too that's and the information that they giving folk is insane information yes it is right TR amen because because outside of the Bible they're not lining people up no amen glory to God it's it's just intellectual thinking contrary to the word of God the reason why we in this condition brother Solomon is because people are are offer the word of God that's right amen amen that's the truth brother glory to God people people are are offer the word of God and and secular thinking cannot produce what folks are looking forth right amen if secular thinking could produce it we never needed Jesus that's right if secular thinking could produce it we never needed an ego that's the truth brother you preaching glory to God I feel the help now I feel powerful right now Hallelujah is that right amen secular secular thinking and in in our own human reasoning cannot am Man line you up right secular thinking and and and our emotions and feelings right cannot produce a victory in our lives brother amen y'all hear me youngsters yeah it will not it it will not produce a satisfaction right from secular thinking all you will get amen is a continual broken heart and hurt feelings exctly right amen gor our Victory comes by being behind the word of God that's that's it see we we in Genesis Adam them was fortified right right yes sir they was fortified behind the word of God right but see the enemy got uh uh Eve to come from behind her fortification he knew he had her that's right every time right yes sir it's it's kind of like the prophet talked in choosing of a bride you know him and the fellow was looking at cow and he was wondering why you know uh he was he was looking you know he said bill you got a lot of lar fell he say cuz if you look in her eyes and you see that wild St he say the reason why she looking good is because she she's pinned up she's CED up he say the moment you let her out bro you got problem she she she'll never be a mother to her Cal that's right and see we we we we trying to keep you pinned in the word fortified behind the word so so that when when you get to these Junctions you'll be what the word say that you supposed to be Oh Glory see you you you you'll know how to be a wife to your husband you'll know how to be a mother to your children right see if if not if not you all you want to do is is run out and be in the in the streets am huh and I'm here to tell you I'm a witness ain't nothing in the streets how many folk that been in the streets that know what I'm talking about ain't nothing in the streets but death cuz the wtes of sin is death yes sir glory to God glory to God and see and and no matter no matter what these young guys and these aggressive girls tell you come on Church a it's not nothing it's important that that you follow the the the the pattern uh-huh that that would set the order marriage is Honorable and and marriage is still right between a male and a female boy I can go somewhere with that cuz when you start breaking that and and getting into all of this and all of the the the theory and thought of of today then what do you what are we making God God Don't Make No mistakes right God never God never made a mistake when he made man and W man glory to God come on that's right when he made man right cuz cuz we're talking about perfect thoughts now right knowing that once he made man and once he made woman right the anatomies would be uh Co what that word they'll go together cohes right uh to for mten purposes glory to God so so how could we say God made a mess I'm going leave that alone I'm going leave that alone right but it's it's the truth yes sir and these things got to register right be because of of the influence and what's been loosed in this age from the river eph frates all those demons sir and see it's probably 50 times worse on this generation than it was on on my generation right because of the access that they have that we didn't have this ain't nothing I'm saying brother jackon said some of this just in a way right the the access and and you know things are more open yeah right and and and tolerated glory to God and so these things has to be said because of the the the influence in the struggle maybe not now for the young people right glory to God cuz they they 14 15 16 right but but when here here's the thing when they turn 18 that magic number that magic number I can't wait to get 18 you better slow it down I can't wait till I'm 18 so I can leave all right all right all right yeah you know the reason you looking good and cute now cuz you home with your mama you looking all handsome now cuz you home and your daddy buying you suits and all that but when you turn 18 and you walk out from under the blood oh loud y'all make me feel like sing my sermon right now it's the truth anyhow huh you know I can't wait to be at du I wish I could go backo and start all over again just with the knowledge that I have now y'all know what I'm talking about we we couldn't wait to to smoke and club and drink and all of that kind of stuff and then you realize for at least for me by the time I was 25 bro I ain't want to drink no more i a want no more I ain't want a club no more I I just needed something that'll bring a peace in my life yes sir right thank thank God that I was I was I was redeemable thank God that I was in God's mind yes sir glory to God Amen but but I'm trying to show us something God says I'mma back up just a little bit God sets a boundary this is naturally and spirit for our benefit you benefit from that you benefit from the standard that's been restored holy decency and you benefit from that this morning good preach brother glory to God well they don't let me do this they won't let me dress do you realize when you do that it shows that you you you're insane something is not right with the you when you walk around with your bosoms all that ain't cute yes sir yeah yeah yeah huh amen and and the prophet makes a statement he say the reason why they dress like that is for attention glory to God glory to God but what kind of attention will you get but see we we ought to appreciate uh a a Seer an eagle that came on the scene to relate these things cuz all y'all sisters probably be having your bus out this morning I ain't get no witness on that it was just something to just think about and you said well why would you make a statement because of the influence and and and the need to be the need to be uh I don't know if I would say competitive but maybe come on cuz you know we kind of all a little bit just a little bit egotistical and and and and competitive just a little bit and right right and cuz if if the sister with her bosom's out getting more attention now this worldly this right let's let's work withed a minute then you kind of like I I I like the attention she getting y'all ought to talk to me I know y'all y'all all right huh s a no go back probably and look at some of them pictures you know some of them outfits we wor and y'all wo tight pants and it's the truth well why why why I'll say this well why were we doing that cuz we wasn't in in in our appropriate uh way of thinking right we we didn't know realistically right we didn't know what right thinking was that's exactly right before Christ before come on Church come on Church look at look at look at society and and the things that they do and all of that you say yall always hopping on high people but I'm just trying to show you show us something it it just shows where you are and your thinking and what kind of inspiration that you up under right I I'm not here to belit or make people feel bad and when and when folk come to church what they need to know they need to know what's appropriate and what's not appropriate right right amen see cuz watch watch watch the theme right watch the theme we we got to realize because of sin and how we came we were already cross the chasm yes sir MH huh yes sir Adam and Eve they stepped across the chasm the boundaries that was set the word that was said ad Eve was deceived Adam wasn't right it's always the church being deceived right by the world yes sir look at look at the church deceived by the world uhhuh come on church so you you got to see how important it was to God to send an ego yes sir to reestablish right yes sir God has always been in the reestablishing business yes sir right when when God came when God came down in in the Book of Genesis it was to reestablish the fellowship that was broken sir right right because boundaries boundaries will step the cross so God and only God could reestablish what's broken that's the truth amen amen amen right I'll say that again only God only he can redeem us right when when when anything is broken right God's Masterpiece was broken only God could restore the Masterpiece only God could reestablish Fellowship yes sir right right I don't care how how deep in sin and how people backslide and all that God can steal right if you're a redeemable attribute of God to reestablish a connection yes sir right so that so that we can have Fellowship right God can restore a Oneness right broken order that's why he sent a prophet yes sir be because amen the the the word was broken when he sent the son of man right Christ look at the condition the church was in right Jesus said boy y'all with all of these Traditions you make the word of God have not effect right when when y'all when y'all Pious and y'all thinking y'all this look y'all so far away from scripture uhhuh glory to God they and and they they were so far away from scripture that they couldn't even recognize right their day in this message they couldn't even recognize that Jesus Jesus Christ was on the scene right trying trying to get them to to to understand cuz he mean to understand how far right they were away from the word with just all of these Traditions washing pots and this and that right come onen did he say that he said y'all with all of these Traditions right and see here's here's the thing he did that because he cared yes sir amen right and sometimes sometimes we don't we don't get it well what what is love love is correction we we see I think people are under the spirit of the day right where seven women to come you know uh you know kind of we want to do our own thing we're our own apparel and all of that but we just kind of want to take the name of church but we want to dress how we want to dress right I couldn't sit under a man with a big ponytail on the top of his head come on Church like bro you look crazy you think you fly and all that you look crazy with a big just a big thing up here on the top of your head pushed back in a bun it shows what kind of spirit that man up under exactly right like BR that that it's not a masculine thing no it's not but see you know when when everybody want to do what's good in their own own eyes but we thank God that that we had a prophet to come right we ain't ashamed of that we you let me tell you something y'all make you stand on these chairs when a man say that why we benefit by by what's been given to us yes sir we understand the the mind of God the nature of God the makeup of God what God cares about and what God does not care about we understand the principles and the orders and the standards and the setup of God yes sir amen see we understand you know what if if I could get lined up with this I'll be happy I'll be peaceful right if if if we could find the order right come on church just look at Genesis for a moment before the fall look look look at the joy that right look at the happiness look at the Oneness Lord right look look at the picture that that God created and set up before the fall man I was in the oness message go back and read it brother B said I man what a picture to look at right Amen in the sovereignty of God he knew what we being laid out of seal yes sir but amen also in the sovereignty of God he knew that there would be Provisions Hallelujah well y'all going to make me this morning glory to God when when when when the standards is broken and the order is broken and and we got religion and traditions and and and folk got very little word God knew that there would be Provisions God knew that there would be food Hallelujah come on amen God knew that there would there would there would be a people on the Earth that he could line up yes sir and the reason that God came because he cared yes sir Hallelujah yes sir brother God comes because he cares you know I was thinking about some of the youngsters and they their testimony in the beginning of the year that watch night and you know there there are struggles and and God cares about your struggles he God came to settle them because he cared right he he cared about where they were and and and their thought and their thought process right right and and how they was thinking and the way that they were leaning because of their thinking y'all to preach with me come on God say you know what I care see they God God says you know what because they are redeemable God comes to the redeemed right glory to God God came to Adam yes sir cuz Adam was out of position right truth he wasn't at church godam K Adam where you at Lord y'all thinking it's cool to

member that's all amen come on that's all Brother come on yes sir we we talking about standing on the word of God yes sir glory to God see God cared enough to to have all of these things pinned yeah right s books of Bible I ain't just a smart saying we we God sent a prophet and eager age and all this cute stuff that that's just not for just cuteness no sir that's to give me something when I'm struggling and I do be struggling yes sir amen amen good y'all think for cuz a brother roll up he don't be struggling yeah come on somebody I ain't only one be struggling y'all be struggling too sometime you be struggling with a wife and a husband by your side ain't just a single person thing or a young person thing no sir come on church right the only thing that gives me the victory is is is is is the word of God some sometimes this thing seems overwhelming right true yeah y'all know what I'm talking about sometimes it seem overwhelming especially you know y'all just had Valentine Day right y'all know what I'm talking about no and things be overwhelming I y'all know I don't I ain't get I ain't into that I just you know you know in those Seasons you know the single folk be feeling funny you got to go get your own you got to go get your own roll in your own candy your own I don't mind doing me now don't don't misunderstand me y' don't mind do me well the Lord I do me well huh but that's not where I want to be yeah I have to try to tell myself that but you you all right okay I'm all right see the greater part yes sir the greater part see so that's why we sometimes we we got to be we got to be lenient when folks start getting older you got to be really more prayerful for them CU you got to be able to feel what they going through and and and help believe God right you know cuz some some folk can't wait till 20 27 to get married some folk might need to get married at 1819 I know y'all don't like to hear that I'mma leave that alone cuz I ain't the pastor because everybody

secular stuff in our head I'm trying to get my career and I'm trying to do this and yeah by the time you 40 don't nobody even want you chasing a career sometimes you just got to be harsh harshly realistic and then and then you you get you get married I I shouldn't have said that I shouldn't but but then okay we we chase our career we chase our career and somewhere in the back of our mind we we might want to have a children or two right but now you 40 right and it it might be difficult just even conce it right you get you not that you know there are struggles there there's young sisters that struggle too to conceive but you lessen your chance glory to God glory to God see this what I find this what I find we don't believe that God is able to take care of us come on we think it's all on us not yeah you want you want folks to have careers and all that I know things has changed I'm just a back to the Bible preacher sir on MH we we are where we are and we can't go back but you have to say things to give us a realistic view of things help me out brother Joe right a realistic view see God cares yes he does let me let me let me touch on this and then I'm going to go right but God cares yes he does God God comes because he cares yes sir when we think about that woman at the well you know when when when people around her probably didn't fully understand the depths of what she was going through it showed that that something something something was definitely wrong yes sir right we there was a thirst right here here's something that I was thinking about on my my way here this morning it it just shows you where where people don't realize how they have succumb to Spirits right that's right cuz cuz to just to just deal with all of these people right come on church to just deal with all of these personalities and all these faces and all these you know breaths and all of these all it's not s folk don't think about that it just shows you it just shows you the spirit that folk be up under yes sir right cuz it if we look back to standards it it was you know one buck and One D right that's right go back to Mar at divorce right I know what I'm talking about right polygamy didn't come in until after the fall right right right but in the beginning it wasn't so see you even look back in the day that that was a standard set mama had a standard boy if you want to
