[45:05] services that we've had with brother

[47:04] Amen. We sing the song
[47:09] only believe because it tells us that
[47:13] we're to believe only.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's
[47:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; No room for doubt in the heart of a
[47:19] believer.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, friends. Good to be
[47:24] in the house of the Lord this morning.
[47:26] Good to be with you all. Uh, a lot of
[47:30] water under the bridge. Amen. Since we
[47:33] we're this way, but uh, you know, we we
[47:38] uh
[47:40] we have to just follow the mind of the
[47:42] Lord and and go where he leads us.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; And uh do uh what he willth.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus. Amen. We won't
[47:53] sing anymore this morning. I I'll leave
[47:56] that up to the singers.
[47:59] Amen. But if you have your Bibles this
[48:02] morning, before we let you be seated, we
[48:04] want you to turn into the book of
[48:06] Genesis, chapter 4.
[48:09] And um
[48:12] we want to bring you greetings from the
[48:14] saints in uh in Flagstaff, Arizona,
[48:18] where we reside there with a little
[48:20] church. Uh we we call it North Country
[48:24] Christian Fellowship.
[48:26] It's just a little group of saints
[48:30] waiting on the coming of the Lord.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so they uh
[48:39] they don't let me get away too often,
[48:42] but uh when we do, we we try to
[48:46] uh stay busy for the Lord. We don't, you
[48:50] know, I I've I don't think I've ever
[48:51] taken a vacation where I didn't preach
[48:54] somewhere.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; And uh it's just been
[48:58] that way. I I don't think that we have
[49:01] many more opportunities
[49:03] uh for that those kind of things myself
[49:06] and if we want to be busy about the
[49:09] things of God.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; All right.
[49:12] in Genesis chapter 4. And there we want
[49:15] to read uh the ninth and the 10th verses
[49:19] if we may. Uh and uh here in verse 9,
[49:26] the Bible says, "And the Lord came uh
[49:29] unto Cain. Uh the Lord said unto Cain,
[49:33] uh where is Abel thy brother?"
[49:37] And he said, "I know not." What a liar.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; He knew right where he was.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; He says, "Am I brother's keeper?" And he
[49:50] said, "What has thou done?
[49:53] The voice of thy brother's blood
[49:58] crith unto me
[50:00] from the ground." Right.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; And in the book of Hebrews chapter 12
[50:06] and verse 24,
[50:08] it says, "And to Jesus, the mediator of
[50:12] the new covenant
[50:14] and to the blood of sprinkling
[50:17] that speaketh better things
[50:20] than that of Abel."
[50:23] &gt;&gt; We'd like to title them message this
[50:26] morning, The Blood Still Speaks. Right.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; And we want to go to the Lord in prayer.
[50:34] Heavenly Father, we thank you Lord for
[50:36] the the grand privilege Lord of standing
[50:40] before your people. Lord, the highest
[50:43] honor that any man could know is to Lord
[50:47] to stand before the purchase of your
[50:49] blood.
[50:51] I pray father this morning that we'll be
[50:53] able to convey from our hearts lord
[50:56] those things which are needful for the
[50:59] body of Christ and to encourage this
[51:03] little group Lord this morning I I don't
[51:06] come with any agenda or any preconceived
[51:10] notions Lord just that we may
[51:14] Lord preach Christ and him crucified
[51:18] &gt;&gt; and we pray Lord that you'll bless the
[51:20] people today that you'll heal the sick,
[51:22] Lord, that you'll encourage, Lord, your
[51:25] children. Save the lost,
[51:28] &gt;&gt; Father. May there come such a sweeping,
[51:30] Lord, a power of God that would that
[51:33] would change our hearts, Lord. Make us
[51:35] fit, Lord, for your kingdom. We pray in
[51:39] the allsufficient name of the Lord
[51:41] Jesus. The church said,
[51:43] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[51:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. As you have your seats this
[51:45] morning,
[51:52] might have to move this pull pit so I'm
[51:53] a little closer to you.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; But uh we'll get used to the the changes
[52:03] are are you know you get kind of in a in
[52:07] a place where you get uh things become
[52:09] common. You become comfortable in your
[52:12] in your own skin that way. But uh you
[52:16] know uh we
[52:18] trust that the Lord will uh have
[52:21] something for us this morning.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; Uh
[52:26] it was snowing at our place uh
[52:29] yesterday, so my wife was even wondering
[52:31] if they would have service today and if
[52:34] she could get out the drive.
[52:37] And uh so I told her, "Don't worry about
[52:39] it. You if it if the car goes, go to
[52:42] church."
[52:44] And so I'm I'm sure everything will be
[52:46] all right. I haven't uh I got wonderful
[52:50] officers and those kind of things uh
[52:53] able to uh hold down the fort while
[52:56] we're away.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:01] Paul told the Corinthian church, he made
[53:05] a statement there in uh 1 Corinthians 2
[53:09] and he says,"For I determined
[53:13] &gt;&gt; not to know anything among you
[53:16] &gt;&gt; save Christ and him crucified."
[53:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:21] I thought that was striking this morning
[53:23] as I dwelt upon that that he made this
[53:28] statement that I am determined.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; I determined I I I resolved in my heart.
[53:36] I I made this uh uh uh this judgment.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. uh in my heart that I wouldn't
[53:44] uh that I wasn't going to go looking for
[53:46] any other uh uh determination, but that
[53:50] I could that I could convey to you,
[53:53] &gt;&gt; right?
[53:54] &gt;&gt; That Christ died for sinners.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; And that that he says of which I am
[54:01] chief.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so he made this
[54:06] determined it actually the word
[54:08] determine there uh means to uh to become
[54:11] resolute to make a resolve
[54:14] &gt;&gt; and I I thought it and it just my mind
[54:16] went to this place that that when the
[54:19] president sits behind the desk in his
[54:22] oval office and he's making decision
[54:24] when he's uh uh uh uh making an
[54:28] executive order
[54:30] &gt;&gt; uh that he sets behind the resolution
[54:33] absolute desk, the desk of
[54:36] determination, the desk of of of passing
[54:40] uh uh uh presidential
[54:43] uh uh executive order. Now,
[54:46] unfortunately that when he steps out
[54:49] from behind that desk after a few years
[54:52] of uh of his term of office, then
[54:55] another president can come in behind him
[54:57] and he can change his executive order.
[55:02] you know, he can he can alter that ex
[55:04] executive order as long as it's
[55:06] according to the constitution as long as
[55:08] it's doesn't conflict any laws of the
[55:10] land that HE CAN NOW MAKE THIS resolute
[55:14] uh decision. And so he then determines
[55:17] to know something else. Maybe a a
[55:20] Republican decision or maybe a a
[55:24] DEMOCRAT DECISION or or HE'S GOING TO
[55:26] MAKE SOME DECISION ACCORDING TO HIS to
[55:29] his constituents or or to the lobbyists
[55:32] or whoever would uh grease his palm with
[55:35] a few extra dollars. BUT WHEN PAUL CAME,
[55:39] HE CAME TO MAKE A DECISION BASED ON THE
[55:42] LAW OF LAWS BY THE KING OF KINGS. HE
[55:46] SAID, "I NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING AMONG
[55:49] YOU, SAVE CHRIST AND HIM CRUCIFIED. I'M
[55:52] GOING TO GIVE YOU WHATEVER YOU NEED TO
[55:55] GET YOU FROM THIS WORLD TO THE WORLD TO
[55:58] COME. AND THE ONLY THING THAT'S GOING TO
[56:00] DO THAT IS THE SHED BLOOD OF AN INNOCENT
[56:03] ONE." THAT GOD HAD TO TAKE MY PLACE. Oh
[56:08] my. When you think about that,
[56:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Every day Sunday, isn't it?
[56:13] &gt;&gt; All right.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; G,
[56:16] &gt;&gt; brother Brandon makes some tremendous
[56:18] statements along these lines. I' like
[56:21] to, if you'll help me, I'll stay with my
[56:24] notes. Uh,
[56:26] &gt;&gt; it's 10:30.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; So, if I'm done by 11:30, we're good.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; That is that all right? I and I know we
[56:34] have some some time constraints there.
[56:36] We want to be studious of that. Now,
[56:39] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam tells us here. He says,
[56:40] "Now, in those days, they did not have
[56:43] any Bibles."
[56:45] &gt;&gt; So, the only way that Abel could have
[56:48] known how to worship the Lord,
[56:51] &gt;&gt; it had to come by a revelation.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[56:56] It was revealed to him
[56:59] uh uh some way
[57:02] for the two boys sacrifices was
[57:05] absolutely contrary one to another.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; Right?
[57:10] &gt;&gt; SO THEN NOW WE REALIZE THAT WHEN WHEN
[57:12] CAIN brought his uh his sacrifice when
[57:16] he came to his altar to worship, brother
[57:19] Ram said they both bu were both
[57:21] religious. They both built altars. THEY
[57:23] BOTH BROUGHT SACRIFICE. They both
[57:26] WORSHIPED GOD, BUT ONE WAS ACCEPTED and
[57:29] the other was not.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; And because their uh their their worship
[57:35] and their and their revelations were so
[57:37] contrary, their sacrifices were diverse
[57:41] to each other, totally uh in opposition
[57:44] to the other.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. So God had uh revealed to Abel by
[57:50] a divine revelation that what would take
[57:54] away sin was blood.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; We find that many places said, "DO YOU
[58:02] SEE CAIN HAD the revelation of his
[58:05] father that it was fruit?"
[58:08] &gt;&gt; All right.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; Or plants.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; All right. All right.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; All right.
[58:13] So, uh, we're going to hit a note here
[58:15] in a moment. He says, uh, uh, uh, the
[58:18] lamb that had been slain before the
[58:22] foundation of the world. Oh my, here it
[58:25] is.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; YES.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; HE ALREADY SAW CHRIST.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; OH MY. BY the revelation that before the
[58:35] foundation of the world, WHEN CHRIST WAS
[58:38] PRONOUNCED to be slain for the sins of
[58:41] the world, ABEL BY FAITH SAW THAT
[58:44] REVELATION. It was REVEALED TO HIM. AND
[58:48] THE ENTIRE BIBLE IS BUILT UPON that
[58:51] revelation. THAT'S RIGHT.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; OH, THINK ABOUT IT, FRIENDS, THAT HERE
[58:55] WAS A HERE WAS A A A YOUNG MAN THAT CAME
[58:58] OUT TO WORSHIP GOD. AND WHEN HE CAME
[59:01] THERE, HE HAD TO CONSIDER IN HIS MIND
[59:04] THAT I IN ORDER FOR ME TO COME INTO THE
[59:07] PRESENCE OF GOD, I HAVE TO GO WITH MY
[59:10] SINS COVERED.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT?
[59:12] &gt;&gt; I HAVE TO GO WITH WITH WITH SOME WAY
[59:15] THAT WILL please the the the THE THE
[59:19] EYES OF GOD.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; THAT GOD WAS LOOKING DOWN THROUGH
[59:23] ETERNITY. AND THERE HAD TO BE SOMETHING
[59:25] THAT WOULD PLEASE THIS GOD THAT WE
[59:28] WORSHIP. And so as HE BEGAN TO MEDITATE
[59:31] UPON THAT, HE had to think, "Oh my,
[59:35] THERE IT CAN'T BE THE PLANTS AND THOUGH
[59:37] THEIR FLOWERS ARE BEAUTIFUL AND AND
[59:40] THOUGH ALL THESE THINGS ARE ARE LOVELY
[59:42] FRUITS AND THINGS AND I SEE WHAT MY
[59:44] BROTHER'S DOING, BUT I REALIZE THAT IT
[59:46] WASN'T A SIN BY FRUIT, BUT IT WAS A SIN
[59:51] AGAINST THE BLOOD."
[59:53] &gt;&gt; AND SO THEREFORE, I HAVE TO I HAVE TO
[59:55] APPEASE GOD BY BLOOD. AND SO THEREFORE,
[59:59] SOMETHING INNOCENT HAS TO TAKE MY GUILTY
[1:00:02] PLACE BECAUSE I'M THE GUILTY ONE. AND
[1:00:04] THIS INNOCENT ONE HAS TO BE THERE TO
[1:00:07] DIE. AND NOT JUST FOR ME, BUT INSTEAD of
[1:00:11] me.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; THAT SOMETHING HAS TO TAKE MY PLACE.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Oh my glory. And so, Brother Bam tells
[1:00:20] us that he saw by REVELATION THAT GOD
[1:00:23] GAVE HIM A VISION OF WHAT TOOK PLACE
[1:00:27] before the foundation of the world.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; THAT HE LOOKED BACK AND BY SUPERNATURAL
[1:00:33] INTERVENTION that he WAS ABLE TO LOOK
[1:00:35] INTO INTO ETERNITY AND SEE THAT
[1:00:39] SOMETHING HAD DIED IN HIS PLACE, THAT
[1:00:42] SOMETHING TOOK HIS PLACE. AND SO, HE HAD
[1:00:45] TO REPLICATE THAT WHAT HE SAW IN HEAVEN.
[1:00:48] HE HAD TO REPLICATE it upon the earth.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; And by THAT GOD WAS PLEASED.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; But to Cain's sacrifice, he had no
[1:00:59] respect.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; Oh my revelation.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; And so as he offered this lamb, we find
[1:01:07] that that ABEL'S LAMB WHEN IT DIED, IT
[1:01:10] IT DIED SPEAKING IN TONGUES.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT HAD DIED SPEAKING IN A
[1:01:15] language that Abel COULD NOT UNDERSTAND.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; OH, IT WAS BLEEDING OUT. ELI, ELI.
[1:01:25] OH MY. IT WAS IT WAS IT WAS BLEEDING
[1:01:27] OUT.
[1:01:30] AMEN. IT WAS BLEEDING OUT. AMEN. WHY?
[1:01:33] BECAUSE HIS SHEPHERD HAD FORSAKEN HIM.
[1:01:36] HE WAS BLEEDING OUT BECAUSE HE WAS
[1:01:38] SUFFERING. HE WAS DYING. HIS TONGUE WAS
[1:01:42] CLEAVED TO HIS MOUTH. AMEN. THEY WAGGED
[1:01:44] THEIR HEAD AT HIM. OH, THERE WAS NO
[1:01:46] BEAUTY WE SHOULD DESIRE IN HIM. AND IT
[1:01:49] PLEASED GOD TO SMITE HIM.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; And when God's lamb died that day on
[1:01:58] Calvary, he spoke in a language that no
[1:02:01] one understood, "My God, my God, why has
[1:02:04] thou forsaken ME?" IT WAS GOD'S LAMB
[1:02:07] HACKED TO PIECES.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN. And he was the very lamb that Abel
[1:02:11] had in mind when HE SEEN THE PROMISED
[1:02:14] seed of the woman.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Then now THAT ABEL HAD LOOKED
[1:02:18] BACK, AMEN, AND SAW WHAT God had done,
[1:02:21] then he began to look future. And he, oh
[1:02:24] my, he began to see what was to come
[1:02:27] because there was a promise. AND THERE
[1:02:28] WAS A WORD THAT HAD ALREADY BEEN GIVEN.
[1:02:31] OH MY. To his mother and his father that
[1:02:33] the that the that the heel of the
[1:02:36] WOMAN'S SEED WOULD BRUISE THE HEAD OF
[1:02:38] THE SERPENT. AND HE KNEW THAT THERE HAD
[1:02:40] TO COME ONE.
[1:02:42] Oh my. And this one that came, Abel had
[1:02:46] him in mind. And he saw that he was the
[1:02:48] promised seed of the woman.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; He was the lamb that DANIEL SAW HUNED
[1:02:55] OUT OF the mountain without hands.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; He was the wheel in the middle of the
[1:03:01] wheel.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. WHAT WAS THAT WHEEL IN
[1:03:04] THE MIDDLE OF THE WHEEL? WAS GOD WAS IN
[1:03:06] CHRIST RECONCILING THE world to himself.
[1:03:11] Moses said that there would be no
[1:03:14] remission of sin without the shedding of
[1:03:17] blood.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; They had all seen it. They saw it and it
[1:03:25] was all met that day
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; on Calvary.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. THAT DAY ON CALVARY
[1:03:31] was the day of days.
[1:03:35] Back in 1944,
[1:03:38] there was a an operation by the
[1:03:41] Americans
[1:03:43] where they
[1:03:46] uh
[1:03:48] it was the largest air, land, and sea
[1:03:52] attack
[1:03:53] of in in history.
[1:03:56] And they called it the day of days.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; Or D-Day.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; And that's where we dropped, you know,
[1:04:05] thousands and thousands of men uh hit
[1:04:07] the shores of Normandy, France. And it
[1:04:11] was uh quite the operation.
[1:04:15] But I'm here to tell you that that day
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; pales,
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT,
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; to the day of days.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. WHEN GOD'S MAN WHEN GOD'S MAN
[1:04:28] THAT WAS UH UH GOD'S ARNOLD VAN WINKLE
[1:04:32] REED, IT WAS GOD'S MAN THAT RAN INTO THE
[1:04:35] THICKEST OF THE ENEMY'S SPEARS. IT WAS
[1:04:37] GOD'S MAN THAT WENT IN AND PAID THE
[1:04:40] PRICE FOR all mankind. IT WAS THAT DAY
[1:04:43] THAT THE BLOOD OF ABEL, AMEN, IT CAN
[1:04:45] ONLY SPEAK, AMEN, AGAINST CAIN.
[1:04:50] BUT THIS MAN'S BLOOD SPAKE FOR YOU,
[1:04:53] CAIN.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; IT SPEAKS FOR YOU THIS MORNING. AND IT'S
[1:04:57] SPEAKING LOUDER. OH MY. WHAT A MIGHTY
[1:05:00] tongue
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; that this blood has.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; We find then
[1:05:09] brother tells us, "But it it wasn't
[1:05:11] fruits. It was the blood." Listen now.
[1:05:16] It was the blood of Abel's father.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; Who made him mortal.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; All right. All right.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; BE BE BEFORE ADAM HAD SINNED, before
[1:05:30] there was this this this GREAT CHAOS
[1:05:34] THAT CAME BACK INTO THE EARTH BY BY THE
[1:05:37] SIN of one man.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; THAT THAT THAT MAN WALKED THE EARTH AS
[1:05:42] AN IMMORTAL.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; HE WALKED AS A SUPERMAN. THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; HE WALKED AS A GOD MAN UPON THE EARTH.
[1:05:49] THAT ALL CREATION WAS SUBJECT TO HIM. HE
[1:05:52] COULD SPEAK TO THE ANIMALS. HE COULD
[1:05:54] SPEAK TO THE TREES AND THE RIVERS AND
[1:05:57] EVERYTHING. HE was an immortal.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN HE FAILED AND SINNED AGAINST
[1:06:03] THE BLOOD, WHEN ABEL came forth
[1:06:07] crying, BLOOD COVERED,
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; OH MY. COME BY THE WAY OF THE MATRIX.
[1:06:13] BORN IN SIN, SHAPED IN INIQUITY. COME IN
[1:06:17] THE WORLD SPEAKING LIES. ABEL REALIZED
[1:06:20] THAT IT WAS HIS FATHER'S BLOOD THAT MADE
[1:06:22] HIM MORTAL.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; OH MY. IF HE WOULD HAVE COME BY SPOKEN
[1:06:27] WORD THE WAY ADAM CAME, THEN HE WOULD
[1:06:29] HAVE CAME FORTH AS AN IMMORTAL. HE WOULD
[1:06:32] HAVE HAD THE SAME POWER AS HIS FATHER.
[1:06:34] BUT NOW HE WAS HE WAS HE WAS A MAN FIT
[1:06:38] TO DIE.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; WOW.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD. He was immortal.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; SO HE CAME AND OFFERED THE BLOOD OF A
[1:06:45] lamb by revelation.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; No one
[1:06:51] TO TELL HIM ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; BUT HE BY FAITH HE SEEN THE SON OF GOD
[1:06:58] COMING AND OFFERED a lamb in a
[1:07:01] figurative type.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; Seeing that Jesus was a lamb
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; slain before the foundation of the
[1:07:07] world.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:09] Charles Spurgeon
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; made a statement one time. He said, "The
[1:07:13] blood of Jesus hath a mighty tongue."
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; And the importance
[1:07:21] of its prevailing cry is not vengeance.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; THAT WHEN THE BLOOD OF JESUS CRIES OUT,
[1:07:29] OH MY. NOT LIKE ABEL'S BLOOD.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; WOW.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; BUT THIS BLOOD DOESN'T SPEAK OF
[1:07:35] VENGEANCE.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; IT DOESN'T SPEAK OF WRATH. ALL RIGHT.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; But it speaks of mercy.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; A MIGHTY TONGUE OF GOD THAT IT SPEAKS OF
[1:07:44] MERCY. WHEN HIS EYE LOOKS UPON HIS
[1:07:47] PEOPLE, HE LOOKS THROUGH THE EYES OF
[1:07:49] MERCY. WHEN HE CORRECTS HIS CHILDREN, HE
[1:07:52] CORRECTS THEM WITH NAIL SCARRED HANDS.
[1:07:55] AMEN. OH, THAT'S MY JESUS.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE,
[1:08:02] THE BLOOD OF JESUS speaketh better
[1:08:05] things than that of Abel.
[1:08:08] Abel was a righteous man AND HE DIED
[1:08:12] INNOCENT.
[1:08:15] Listen to WHAT HE SAYS. BECAUSE HE WAS
[1:08:18] IN THE WAY.
[1:08:23] HE WAS IN THE WAY STANDING FOR THE REAL
[1:08:26] revelation that he had.
[1:08:29] SO HERE WAS AN INNOCENT MAN WORSHIPING
[1:08:32] GOD BY THE DICTATES OF HIS HEART BY
[1:08:35] SPIRITUAL REVELATION. BUT WHEN HE WAS
[1:08:38] STANDING THERE WORSHIPING GOD IN THAT
[1:08:40] WAY, HE WAS STANDING IN THE WAY OF his
[1:08:44] brother getting to God.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; BUT THE WORD SAYS THAT GOD SPOKE TO CAIN
[1:08:51] AND SAID, "IF YOU'LL DO WHAT YOUR
[1:08:53] BROTHER DID,
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; then you'll BE ACCEPTED ALSO." AND THEY
[1:08:57] COULD HAVE COME TOGETHER.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; WOW.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; But that brother THAT ABEL WAS STANDING
[1:09:02] IN THE WAY BECAUSE HE HAD ALREADY SET A
[1:09:06] divine dictate, A DIVINE UH UH UH uh
[1:09:11] precedent
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS MADE BY ABEL SHOWING THAT IT
[1:09:16] WAS SIN AGAINST THE BLOOD. AND NOW CAIN
[1:09:19] WAS GOING TO HAVE TO COME TO THE
[1:09:21] REVELATION OF THE SERPENT SEED.
[1:09:26] AND IN ORDER TO COME TO THAT REVELATION,
[1:09:29] HE WAS GOING TO HAVE TO ACCEPT THE
[1:09:31] GOSPEL
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; THAT Abel was preaching.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; OTHERWISE, HIS SACRIFICE WOULD NEVER BE
[1:09:38] ACCEPTED. IT WAS A DENOMINATIONAL
[1:09:42] revelation that was going to have to
[1:09:45] come subservient
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; to the divine revelation that God had
[1:09:49] given his prophet in that day.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; It's an amazing thought.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:56] So, uh,
[1:10:02] the just blood of Abel
[1:10:05] cried out against Cain.
[1:10:08] But the blood of Jesus
[1:10:11] not only cried out,
[1:10:14] but brother Bram said it redeemed.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; It speaketh better things. Amen. Amen.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; It makes you sons and daughters of God.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; It's a reproductive blood.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; THE BLOOD OF JESUS HAS THE blood cell of
[1:10:33] God that CAN COME INTO THE HUMAN heart
[1:10:36] and give you new birth.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; YOUR OLD BIRTH WAS BY THE BLOOD OF YOUR
[1:10:42] FATHER MADE YOU MORTAL. BUT THE BLOOD OF
[1:10:45] YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER, AMEN, NOW CHANGES
[1:10:48] YOU, IMPREGNATES YOU, AND MAKES YOU A
[1:10:52] NEW CREATURE in Christ Jesus.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; It hides you from the wrath of God. The
[1:11:02] blood of ABEL CANNOT HIDE CAIN, but the
[1:11:05] blood of Jesus can.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I love what he says here. HE
[1:11:11] SAYS, "SO COME OUT." UHUH. So he says,
[1:11:15] "So Cain, COME OUT TODAY."
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; HE CALLED US ALL CAIN.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; MY GOD.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; SO WE CAN ALL COME OUT TODAY. WE DON'T
[1:11:26] HAVE TO STAY
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; IN THAT CONDITION WITH THE MARK OF THE
[1:11:30] BEAST UPON HIM. WE DON'T HAVE TO STAY
[1:11:33] THAT WAY. THERE'S A WAY TO COME OUT.
[1:11:36] THERE'S A WAY TO COME INTO REDEMPTION.
[1:11:38] THERE'S A WAY TO COME INTO SALVATION. IT
[1:11:41] DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOUR CONDITION IS.
[1:11:44] IF YOU'RE A CAIN OR IF YOU'RE AN ABEL,
[1:11:46] IF YOU'RE AN ESAU, IF YOU'RE A JACOB, IT
[1:11:49] DON'T MATTER. AMEN. THE BLOOD OF JESUS
[1:11:51] CLEANSES us from all sin.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; Watch what HE SAYS.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; CAN COME OUT TODAY. IF YOU'VE BEEN A
[1:12:01] PERSECUTOR AGAINST THE WORD, say the
[1:12:04] days OF MIRACLES IS PASS. ALL THIS IS
[1:12:07] NONSENSE.
[1:12:08] THE BLOOD IS CRYING OUT. THE BLOOD OF
[1:12:11] JESUS CHRIST CRIES OUT, BUT THERE'S
[1:12:14] FORGIVENESS in that if you'll just
[1:12:16] accept it.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD. BROTHER B TELLS A STORY OF
[1:12:21] how that that that there was a gangster
[1:12:24] AND HE WAS SHOT DOWN IN THE ON THE
[1:12:26] SIDEWALK in Chicago.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; And there and A BIG IT BLED OUT THERE ON
[1:12:32] THE SIDEWALK
[1:12:34] AND THAT LEFT A STAIN on the sidewalk.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; And he said that the people when THEY
[1:12:40] WOULD COME TO THAT STAIN THEY WOULD WALK
[1:12:42] AROUND IT.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; THEY WOULDN'T WALK THROUGH THE BLOOD OF
[1:12:45] THEIR COMRADE. THEY WOULDN'T WALK
[1:12:48] THROUGH THE BLOOD of one of their fellow
[1:12:51] men.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "BUT OH, BUT WHAT ABOUT THE
[1:12:55] BLOOD OF JESUS?"
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "THEY'LL WALK THROUGH IT WITH
[1:12:59] HUG NAILED SHOES WHERE ANGELS FEAR TO
[1:13:02] TROD." AMEN. THEY'LL WALK THROUGH IT
[1:13:04] WITH BOBBED HAIR AND PAINTED FACES.
[1:13:07] AMEN. THEY'LL WALK THROUGH IT. AMEN.
[1:13:09] CIGARETTE SMOKING. AMEN. UH UH.

[1:13:16] THESE PIPE SMOKING, CIGAR SMOKING, AMEN.
[1:13:20] PORNOGRAPHY FIENDS. AMEN. THEY'LL WALK
[1:13:23] RIGHT THROUGH THE BLOOD OF JESUS WHEN
[1:13:25] JESUS DIED TO SAVE YOU FROM THOSE
[1:13:27] THINGS.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; Oh my. There was a preacher one time
[1:13:32] over in Europe and he was telling the
[1:13:34] the all these uh uh religions of the
[1:13:36] world. There was Zekes and James and and
[1:13:39] there was Muhammads and there was Hindus
[1:13:41] and BUDDHISTS AND ALL THESE DIFFERENT
[1:13:43] RELIGIONS OF THE WORLD AND they were all
[1:13:45] given the stories OF WHY THEIR RELIGION
[1:13:48] WAS so great.
[1:13:50] And finally there was a little preacher
[1:13:51] from America. Amen. And and I think his
[1:13:55] name was John Wit. And John went with
[1:13:58] there and he said, he said, "Over in my
[1:14:01] country in the Indian territory of
[1:14:03] Oklahoma, there was a woman
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; and SHE WAS SO VILE.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; She was wicked above above wicked."
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; OH MY. SHE SMOKED A CIGAR. SHE WAS A
[1:14:14] PROSTITUTE and a murderer.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; SHE USED FOUL LANGUAGE. AMEN. She run a
[1:14:19] ch a a a STAGE COACH DOWN THROUGH THE
[1:14:22] MIDDLE OF THE TOWN AND they had to
[1:14:23] arrest her. SHE WAS SO VILE THAT WHEN
[1:14:26] THEY WENT TO WHEN THEY went to tar and
[1:14:29] feather and execute this woman that the
[1:14:31] men wouldn't even touch her with their
[1:14:33] hands because they didn't want to become
[1:14:36] polluted. She was so wicked and so vile.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; Oh my. And brother Wit said, "You
[1:14:44] religions of the world, I want to ask
[1:14:45] you this morning." He says, "Do you have
[1:14:48] anything in your religion that could
[1:14:51] clean the hands of Lady Mcabe?"
[1:14:53] Hallelujah.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. THEY SAT THERE IN
[1:14:57] SILENCE. THEY SAT THERE, COULD NOT SAY
[1:15:00] ANYTHING. AMEN. THE LITTLE FELL, HE WENT
[1:15:02] RUNNING OUT THERE. HE KICKED HIS HEELS
[1:15:05] TOGETHER. HE SAID, "I'M HERE TO TELL
[1:15:06] YOU, HALLELUJAH. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU,
[1:15:09] AMEN, THAT THE BLOOD OF JESUS WON'T JUST
[1:15:12] CLEANSE OUR HANDS, BUT IT'LL CLEANSE OUR
[1:15:14] HEARTS." AMEN. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, THE
[1:15:16] BLOOD OF JESUS SPEAKETH BETTER THINGS
[1:15:19] THAN THAT OF ABEL. AMEN. I like this.
[1:15:23] Got a little bit more room up here to
[1:15:25] preach. HALLELUJAH. THINK ABOUT IT. THAT
[1:15:28] THE BLOOD OF JESUS WILL CLEANSE YOUR
[1:15:30] HEART. IT'LL CLEANSE YOUR MIND. AMEN.
[1:15:33] THE BIBLE SAYS THAT IT WILL TAKE AWAY
[1:15:35] YOUR GUILTY, STONY HEART AND GIVE YOU A
[1:15:39] HEART OF FLESH.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; OH, I say praise the Lord this morning.
[1:15:44] Hallelujah.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; Sure. THE BLOOD SPEAKS. IT SPEAKS BETTER
[1:15:52] THINGS. AMEN. THE OLD TESTAMENT, ARE YOU
[1:15:55] WITH me this morning?
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; The Old Testament, the blood of bulls
[1:16:00] and goats, it spoke of your guilt.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; The New Testament speaks of your
[1:16:06] redemption.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; The Old Testament speaks OF DEATH AND
[1:16:10] SORROW. THE New Testament speaks of
[1:16:13] resurrection and life. The New Testament
[1:16:17] speaks of healing. It speaks of joy. IT
[1:16:20] SPEAKS OF POWER. IT SPEAKS OF LIFE. IT
[1:16:23] SPEAKS OF HEAVEN AND THE SAME BLOOD THAT
[1:16:26] WAS SHED UPON THE GROUND CALLED AFTER
[1:16:28] HIS BROTHER THAT HAD KILLED HIM. BUT THE
[1:16:30] BLOOD OF JESUS COVERS OUR SINS AND
[1:16:33] SPEAKS PEACE AND RESURRECTION AND POWER
[1:16:37] and life and healing.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; ALL THE REDEMPTIVE blessings that the
[1:16:43] blood was shed for speaks for us this
[1:16:46] morning.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, the blood speaks. Amen.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; In Acts chapter 16,
[1:16:57] I want to tell you here was Paul.
[1:17:00] And Paul had in his heart. He knew there
[1:17:03] was a certain mission that that he was
[1:17:05] supposed to go on. I think he was on his
[1:17:06] way to
[1:17:08] Greece, maybe.
[1:17:12] But he was on his way. And him and his
[1:17:14] brother Silas,
[1:17:17] they were on their way. And all of a
[1:17:18] sudden, God speaks to Paul's heart and
[1:17:21] says, "Don't go that way,
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; but I need you to go to Macedonia."
[1:17:29] And so Paul changes course
[1:17:33] and the theologians and different ones
[1:17:35] call it the Macedonian call. So he got
[1:17:38] this call from God,
[1:17:42] the leadership of the Lord,
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; first church age messenger.
[1:17:47] Evidently, every word he spoke was thus
[1:17:49] sayeth the Lord.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Just saying.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; But did you read the rest of the story?
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; He goes to Macedonia
[1:18:02] on this call. He said, "I have much seed
[1:18:04] for you. I got all this program for you
[1:18:07] to do over there. I got I mean, you're
[1:18:09] going to go over there. There's going to
[1:18:10] be many converts. There's going to be I
[1:18:14] mean, there's going to be healing and
[1:18:15] deliverance and you're going to baptize
[1:18:17] them and YOU'RE GOING TO DO ALL THESE
[1:18:19] THINGS. That's what he had in his mind.
[1:18:21] Preach.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; HE GOES OVER THERE AND GO STRAIGHT TO
[1:18:24] JAIL.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; OH, WE'D BE SITTING THERE. He didn't
[1:18:31] hear from God.
[1:18:33] I TELL YOU RIGHT NOW, HE DIDN'T HEAR
[1:18:34] FROM GOD.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; ANY MAN THAT WOULD HEAR FROM GOD, THERE
[1:18:38] AIN'T NO POSSIBLE WAY THAT HE WOULD GO
[1:18:39] TO JAIL. OH, COME ON. HE MISSED IT. HE
[1:18:43] MISSED IT, BROTHER JACK.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; WONDERFUL.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; HUH?
[1:18:53] But we find out that he was in jail. He
[1:18:58] didn't lose a victory
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; WHEN THINGS WENT BAD. WHAT BROTHER BAM
[1:19:03] TELLS IN CHURCH AGE BOOK HE SAID HE SAID
[1:19:06] CLEAR SKIES AND PROSPERITY AND ALL THESE
[1:19:10] THINGS DO NOT MEAN THAT YOU'RE IN THE
[1:19:12] WILL OF GOD. NEITHER DOES CLOUDS AND
[1:19:15] STORMS AMEN SAY THAT uh that that you
[1:19:18] that you're NOT IN THE WILL OF GOD.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; Oh my. BUT IT'S IT'S THE ATTITUDE THAT
[1:19:24] YOU CAN KEEP AMIDST THE TRIALS OF THIS
[1:19:27] LIFE. AND SO HERE WAS A MAN THAT THAT
[1:19:31] THE BLOOD HAD SPOKEN TO HIS SOUL. HE WAS
[1:19:34] A DIFFERENT MAN THAN HE WHAT HE HAD
[1:19:36] BEEN. IT DIDN'T MATTER IF IT COME HELL
[1:19:39] OR HIGH WATER. AMEN. HE WAS GOING TO
[1:19:41] SERVE GOD.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. So the Bible says they COME
[1:19:49] ABOUT THE MIDNIGHT HOUR AND THEY WERE
[1:19:51] THERE IN THEIR CHAINS AND THEIR STALKS.
[1:19:54] HALLELUJAH. AND THEY BEGAN TO SING.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHEN THEY BEGIN TO SING AND
[1:19:59] PRAISE AND GLORIFY GOD IN THE MIDST OF
[1:20:03] HARD TRIAL,
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; JESUS,
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; there come a mighty earthquake.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; It shook down the whole jail, loosed all
[1:20:12] the prisoners. They were all going to
[1:20:14] run for their lives. Paul just told them
[1:20:17] all to stand still. The the centurion
[1:20:19] that was there, the Roman jailer or the
[1:20:21] Macedonian jailer, he realized THAT IT
[1:20:24] WAS A DEATH SENTENCE IF HE LOST HIS
[1:20:26] PRISONERS.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; He was going to fall on his sword and
[1:20:30] stab himself to death. Paul said, "Don't
[1:20:33] hurt yourself, son.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; We're all here."
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:20:40] He said, "If you believe on the Lord
[1:20:42] Jesus Christ, thou and thy house shall
[1:20:45] be saved." Oh my, it's got to be a
[1:20:48] household. Brother Brandham said, "What
[1:20:50] made so many LITTLE KIDS, WHAT MAKES so
[1:20:53] many women out on the streets?" HE SAID,
[1:20:55] "WHAT MAKES SO MUCH JUVENILE
[1:20:57] DELINQUENCY? BECAUSE WE'RE NOT ABLE TO
[1:21:00] GET OUR HOUSEHOLD UNDER THE BLOOD."
[1:21:04] OH MY FRIENDS, I BELIEVE EVERY DADDY AND
[1:21:07] EVERY MOMMY, AMEN, HAS GOT A GOD-GIVEN
[1:21:10] RESPONSIBILITY
[1:21:11] TO GET THEIR CHILDREN UNDER THE BLOOD.
[1:21:14] THEY'VE GOT TO SPEAK A DIFFERENT KIND OF
[1:21:17] LANGUAGE. THEY GOT TO SPEAK THE BLOOD OF
[1:21:20] CHRIST TO THEIR CHILDREN.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Mama, you got to speak it to your
[1:21:26] children or it won't be too long. They
[1:21:28] won't be under the blood no more.
[1:21:31] They'll go by the way of their daddy's
[1:21:33] blood.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; They can't help it because they're born
[1:21:36] mortals.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; They've got to be reborn.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; You can apply the token to your house
[1:21:46] and to your children
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; and that's that's we should do that.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. But those children have got to
[1:21:52] come under the power of that broken
[1:21:54] blood cell that when that cell broke
[1:21:57] there on Calvary, it loosed the dunamis
[1:22:00] power of almighty God. And the only
[1:22:03] thing that'll bring new birth in your
[1:22:05] life is when that power of that broken
[1:22:07] blood cell comes back upon the believer.
[1:22:15] Prophet goes on to say, "The blood
[1:22:17] speaks to your household."
[1:22:20] Listen, listen, listen to this from the
[1:22:23] church age book. Brother Ram said, "The
[1:22:26] evidence of the Holy Ghost is to receive
[1:22:28] the revealed word of God for your age."
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; So now then, the blood speaks, but
[1:22:38] remember, it's a bleeding word.
[1:22:41] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says, "Think."
[1:22:46] I'm announcing that this morning. Think.
[1:22:48] Think just for a moment. Don't let it
[1:22:51] just just be words that some red-faced
[1:22:54] preacher, Amen, is saying this morning.
[1:22:57] But let it be the word of God that
[1:23:00] broods over your spirit that changes you
[1:23:03] from what you once were to what you
[1:23:05] should be.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Brother Brand makes a statement. He
[1:23:09] says, "Think
[1:23:11] your garments
[1:23:13] washed by the water
[1:23:17] of the bleeding word."
[1:23:20] So remember that the there there's a
[1:23:22] there's a word that's come forth, but
[1:23:25] every word in every age has a blood
[1:23:28] connected to it.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; In the days of Irene, there was a blood
[1:23:32] connected to the message of Irene. The
[1:23:36] same with uh Martin and Columba,
[1:23:40] Luther, Wesley.
[1:23:43] Each age had a BLOOD CONNECTED to the
[1:23:46] word.
[1:23:49] You say, "Where do you get that, brother
[1:23:50] D?" Well, John preached it back in first
[1:23:52] John, I believe it was. HE SAID, "WE
[1:23:54] WALK IN THE LIGHT as he is in the light
[1:23:58] AND WE HAVE FELLOWSHIP ONE WITH ANOTHER
[1:24:01] AND
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; the blood of Jesus cleanses us from all
[1:24:05] sins."
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; So, AS LONG AS WE'RE WALKING IN REVEALED
[1:24:09] LIGHT, AS LONG AS WE'RE WALKING IN THE
[1:24:12] LIGHT OF THE WORD, THERE'S A blood
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; and it's a bleeding word. And brother B
[1:24:16] SAYS THAT THE WORD BECAME BLOOD.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; HOW DID THAT HAPPEN? BECAUSE THE WORD
[1:24:22] WAS MADE FLESH
[1:24:24] AND BLOOD IN THE BODY OF CHRIST. HE WAS
[1:24:27] THE WORD EXPRESSED AND THAT WORD THEN
[1:24:30] BLED FOR YOU.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; AND YOU ARE WASHED IN BLEEDING WORD.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; The word bleeding the life of God in the
[1:24:39] word. And the word was bled for you that
[1:24:42] you might be washed from the filth of
[1:24:45] these prostitutes.
[1:24:47] speaking of denominations and and and
[1:24:50] worldly living and these kind of things.
[1:24:52] He says, "And be cleansed and sanctified
[1:24:55] by the washing of the water of the
[1:24:56] word."
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; He said, "And it makes your mind and
[1:25:01] your heart stayed on God in his word."
[1:25:04] It's invisible union if you were
[1:25:06] wondering.
[1:25:07] So now the Bible tells us in St. John's
[1:25:11] gospel chapter 6 verse 53.
[1:25:15] This is a profound scripture
[1:25:17] because it says, "Then Jesus said unto
[1:25:20] them, verily, verily, I say unto you,
[1:25:24] except you eat the flesh of the son of
[1:25:27] man and drink his blood, you have no
[1:25:30] life in you." All right?
[1:25:34] So the the world of that day, brother B
[1:25:38] says the intelligent people of that day
[1:25:40] said he wants us to be a cannibal
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; or he wants us to be a vampire.
[1:25:47] But they could not understand
[1:25:51] that what Jesus was saying to them that
[1:25:54] YOU MUST RECEIVE ME IN MY ENTIRETY
[1:25:58] THAT ALL THAT I AM, MY FLESH, MY NATURE,
[1:26:01] MY LIFE, MY BEING
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; AND IF YOU RECEIVE ME THEN YOU RECEIVE
[1:26:06] the one that sent me.
[1:26:11] So he says this and SO THEN FROM THAT
[1:26:15] YOU HAVE EVERY KIND OF DENOMINATIONAL
[1:26:17] doctrine all the way down to uh
[1:26:19] transsubstantiation and all these other
[1:26:21] kind of things you know that the
[1:26:22] Catholic Church teaches that the
[1:26:24] communion it becomes the literal blood
[1:26:26] and the literal uh uh flesh of God and
[1:26:29] the priest can give that to you and
[1:26:31] somehow you've had a mass
[1:26:34] you've had a deception is what you've
[1:26:36] had. you've had, you know, uh uh uh
[1:26:40] ignorance gone to seed is what that is.
[1:26:44] And but a prophet comes in our day, a
[1:26:47] vindicated prophet,
[1:26:49] and he tells us that this statement was
[1:26:53] made, this profound statement in John's
[1:26:56] gospel, brother Brandham tells us that
[1:26:59] it was made solely to thin down the
[1:27:02] crowd
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T EXPLAIN IT. THEY
[1:27:08] COULDN'T UNDERSTAND IT. THE DISCIPLES
[1:27:11] couldn't understand it.
[1:27:13] All right. SO NOW THE BLOOD WAS SPEAKING
[1:27:17] Christ the word the bleeding word
[1:27:20] speaking
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; TO THIN DOWN THE CROWD TO SEPARATE the
[1:27:26] believers from the unbelievers
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; to separate the the the makeelievers
[1:27:32] from the true believers
[1:27:35] from GREATER THAN SOLOMON. BROTHER BAM
[1:27:37] SAYS AND HE NEVER EXPLAINED IT. RIGHT?
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T HAVE TO explain it.
[1:27:44] Watch what he says. Now, this is, you
[1:27:46] know, this is a pretty tough statement
[1:27:49] that he makes. HE HAD TO SHAKE OFF THE
[1:27:53] PARASITES that were around him.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; INSTEAD OF TRYING TO baby and put their
[1:27:59] name on a book, he was shaking them
[1:28:02] away.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; He had no use for them.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; WOW.
[1:28:08] OH MY. SOMETIMES YOU YOU READ THINGS IN
[1:28:11] THE MESSAGE, YOU SEE things in the word,
[1:28:14] IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S STRIKING. YOU FIND
[1:28:17] WHERE A PROPHET LOOKS AT THE the the
[1:28:20] women of that day. He said, "I've I've
[1:28:22] told you that that cutting your hair
[1:28:24] made you a a a dishonorable woman.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; Painting your face
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; makes you a Jezebel."
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "WE COULD CALL YOU MISS DOG
[1:28:35] MEAT.
[1:28:37] OH, SO MANY WOMEN, THEY BACKED UP ON
[1:28:40] THAT.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "YOU CUT YOUR HAIR, YOU'RE A
[1:28:43] NAKED PROSTITUTE before God."
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "YOU WEAR THOSE LITTLE UH
[1:28:49] LUSTFUL CLOTHES." HE SAID, "YOU'LL BE
[1:28:50] JUDGED WITH the with the prostitutes in
[1:28:53] that day, even though you've been
[1:28:55] virtuous to your husband."
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; That's right. HE SAID, "YOU BOYS WITH
[1:28:58] YOUR BANGS HANGING DOWN IN YOUR FACE
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; and and and and and and this and these
[1:29:04] curlers and all these things in your
[1:29:06] hair," he said, "YOU HAVE A SODOMITE
[1:29:09] SPIRIT."
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; OH MY, THINK ABOUT IT. AND AND HERE THEY
[1:29:14] ARE WITH THEIR LITTLE LIPS POKED OUT AND
[1:29:17] LITTLE FUZZY CAULIFLOWER LOOKING HAIRCUT
[1:29:19] AND AND ALL THESE KIND OF, YOU KNOW,
[1:29:22] LITTLE BOYS RUNNING AROUND WITH JEWELRY
[1:29:24] ON AND NECKLACES AND RINGS ON THEIR
[1:29:26] FINGERS. AND I SAY, "YOU'RE JUST A" AND
[1:29:29] THEY SPEND MORE TIME AT THE BEAUTY SHOP.
[1:29:31] OH MY, THINK ABOUT THAT. AMEN. THEY'LL
[1:29:34] SPEND MORE MONEY, AMEN, ON GETTING THEIR
[1:29:36] MANICURES AND THEIR CURES AND
[1:29:39] WHATEVER THEY ARE. AMEN. WHAT IS IT? OH,
[1:29:42] I'M HERE TO TELL YOU FRIENDS, A A BOY
[1:29:44] DON'T GO GET A HAIRSTYLE. AMEN. HE GOES
[1:29:47] AND GETS A HAIRCUT. HALLELUJAH. THAT'S
[1:29:51] WHAT A BOY DOES. THAT'S WHAT A MAN DOES.
[1:29:54] AMEN. OH, LET me tell you, IT'S IT'S
[1:29:56] HARD SAYINGS. IT'S HOLINESS TO THE
[1:30:00] EXTREMES. BUT BROTHER SAID, THAT'S WHAT
[1:30:03] WE BELIEVE.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; I say, "Oh, God.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; My God."
[1:30:09] and and and and and so it's hard
[1:30:11] sayings.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER BAM DIDN'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN
[1:30:14] IT.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; HE JUST SAID IT.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS IT FOR? TO SHAKE OFF THE
[1:30:19] PARASITES.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; He said, "PARASITES, OH YEAH, PARASITES
[1:30:25] ARE THE ONES THAT JUST STICK TO THE
[1:30:26] CHURCH AND SUCK THE LIFE OUT OF THE
[1:30:29] CHURCH BUT NEVER CONTRIBUTE ANYTHING
[1:30:31] BACK TO IT."
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; I.E. a dog tick, in case you were
[1:30:36] wondering.
[1:30:37] DEER TICKS AND DOG TICKS AND AND EVERY
[1:30:40] KIND OF uh blood sucking leeches and ALL
[1:30:43] THESE KIND OF THINGS. WHAT DID THEY DO?
[1:30:45] THEY COME TO CHURCH, THEY DRAW ON THE
[1:30:47] PASTOR. THEY PASTOR, PASTOR, PASTOR,
[1:30:50] ALWAYS PULLING ON THE PASTOR. NEVER HAVE
[1:30:53] NOTHING TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE CHURCH.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; BUT THE BLOOD OF JESUS SPEAKETH BETTER
[1:30:58] THINGS THAN THESE.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; OH, glory to God. He was shaking them
[1:31:03] away.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's why we preach these
[1:31:06] things shakes you loose
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; makes you think.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; If we don't tell you where your sin is,
[1:31:14] then how you going to repent?
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; How you going to repent of anything? You
[1:31:19] you just Brother B said he just babies
[1:31:21] them and pats them and and the and the
[1:31:23] and and the and the what do you call
[1:31:25] them? Uh the kind old priest
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; pet you this way all the time. You don't
[1:31:31] never rub that kitty backwards though.
[1:31:34] Oh man, she'll bite you.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. The disciples couldn't explain it.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Eating his body and drinking his blood.
[1:31:48] Now listen what he says about those
[1:31:49] disciples. They had done died to those
[1:31:52] things. They realized we we're not here
[1:31:56] to try to, you know, reason with God or
[1:31:58] teach God anything or teach. No, we're
[1:32:01] not here. we we're dead to those things.
[1:32:03] They had died to those principles. They
[1:32:06] weren't here to try to get on board with
[1:32:08] the Pharisees and the Sadducees and try
[1:32:10] to, you know, uh uh trap him in his own
[1:32:13] words. No, they just they just stayed
[1:32:15] quiet. He said no matter what it is, how
[1:32:18] much defeat looked like they had, they
[1:32:20] still believed it anyhow. They could see
[1:32:24] in that man a man THAT ATE, DRANK,
[1:32:28] FISHED, SLEPT, EVERYTHING ELSE, was born
[1:32:31] HERE ON THE EARTH, WALKED WITH THEM,
[1:32:33] talked with them, WORE CLOTHES LIKE the
[1:32:35] rest of them. But he was God.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; All right. AMEN.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "WHO DO MEN SAY THAT I AM? THEY
[1:32:41] say they're this and they're saying
[1:32:42] they're that you're of that." He said,
[1:32:44] "But who do you say that I am?"
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; He said, "Thou art the Christ, the son
[1:32:48] of the living God." Amen.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "You eat my flesh and drink
[1:32:52] my blood." The Bible says, "And they
[1:32:54] said, these are hard sayings. Who can
[1:32:56] hear it?
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Who can hear it?" But then Jesus asked
[1:33:00] him, he saw the se Jesus saw the the
[1:33:02] multitude go away. He saw the 70 GO
[1:33:04] AWAY. HE SAW ALL THESE OTHER THINGS. He
[1:33:06] said he he told the disciples, he said,
[1:33:09] "Are you going to go away, too?"
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Exactly right.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; Peter said, "Where could we go?"
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Where could we go where we are
[1:33:18] sure that thou has a word of life?
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. And they saw it clearly
[1:33:24] vindicated.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, we notice that no
[1:33:28] matter what others did, how they walked
[1:33:30] away, those disciples uh just this quote
[1:33:33] is just profound to me.
[1:33:36] Those disciples were predestinated.
[1:33:41] They were ordained to eternal life. They
[1:33:44] couldn't explain it. They couldn't
[1:33:46] explain it no more than the rest of them
[1:33:48] could. But there was something in them.
[1:33:52] Are you with me? There was something in
[1:33:55] them.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; It was that representation in heaven.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, just like Abel when he looked back
[1:34:04] and saw the lamb slain and knew that he
[1:34:07] was identified with that.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, he had to replicate what
[1:34:12] he SAW IN HEAVEN ON THE EARTH. Praise
[1:34:15] God.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Oh my.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam goes on to say it was a
[1:34:23] thought that God had of them before the
[1:34:27] foundation of the world. So when Peter
[1:34:30] and the rest of the disciples minus
[1:34:32] Judas that WHEN THEY SAID, "THOU HAS THE
[1:34:35] WORDS OF ETERNAL LIFE. WHERE ELSE CAN WE
[1:34:37] GO?" BROTHER BEAM SAID IT WAS A
[1:34:39] REPRESENTATION THAT THEY HAD OF A
[1:34:42] THOUGHT THAT GOD HAD OF THEM BEFORE THE
[1:34:44] FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. They knew that
[1:34:47] IT HAD MANIFESTED ITSELF HERE. That
[1:34:50] thought that you that that God had of
[1:34:52] you when you look at this word and you
[1:34:55] look at the message and you look at the
[1:34:56] blood of Christ and you say, "It's for
[1:34:58] me. It's not WHETHER IT'S FOR ANYBODY
[1:35:01] ELSE. I DON'T KNOW. BUT I KNOW IT'S FOR
[1:35:03] ME. IT WAS JUST FOR ME. HE DIED ON
[1:35:05] CALVARY JUST FOR ME. IF I'M THE ONLY
[1:35:08] PERSON IN ALL OF THE UH THE PALM COAST
[1:35:11] THAT CAN BELIEVE THE WORD OF GOD, IT WAS
[1:35:14] JUST FOR ME
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE HAD A THOUGHT ABOUT ME BEFORE
[1:35:18] THE FOUNDATION of the world.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; And I'm connected with God because of
[1:35:23] it.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; And was sure that God's promise
[1:35:30] vindicated and nothing is going to
[1:35:32] change that for them.
[1:35:34] Brother B said, "That's real, genuine
[1:35:38] Christianity."
[1:35:43] And he makes this statement that uh
[1:35:47] boy, if you're in Armenian this morning,
[1:35:50] you're going to be really upset.
[1:35:52] Hopefully, we're all Calvinists.
[1:35:56] I don't I don't want to be, you know,
[1:35:58] you start throwing things at me.
[1:36:02] the prophet of God.
[1:36:06] Uh hey, this was uh what's today? The
[1:36:09] 25th.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah. This is uh 1965
[1:36:15] uh February 20th.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; God's chosen place of worship. Brother
[1:36:20] Van makes a statement. He says, "But by
[1:36:23] grace you are saved by the grace of God
[1:36:28] through predestination
[1:36:31] of God's fornowledge of your being."
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; So you thought you just got saved in an
[1:36:39] altar.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; That's when you recognized that you've
[1:36:43] always been a child of God.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. You were predestinated.
[1:36:50] Amen. By fornowledge
[1:36:53] to be saved by grace.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; Beautiful. So, brother M tells us is
[1:37:00] then your salvation tonight
[1:37:04] uh as our musicians come. I won't keep
[1:37:06] you very much longer.
[1:37:09] This may take a little while, but I want
[1:37:10] you to be in place when I when I get
[1:37:12] there.
[1:37:16] So then, brother M tells us, then my
[1:37:19] salvation
[1:37:21] and yours tonight
[1:37:25] does not hinge upon the merits
[1:37:29] of our own acts.
[1:37:32] It hinges
[1:37:34] upon the positive
[1:37:38] sovereign grace of almighty God.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Who has chosen us in him?
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; That's the Bible. The Bible say that
[1:37:49] that we were chosen in him
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; from the foundation of the world.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So
[1:38:00] uh certainly he says
[1:38:04] I could never be perfect
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; right
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; nor you could never be perfect.
[1:38:15] So that that that that that includes all
[1:38:18] of us.
[1:38:23] And we don't claim to be perfect,
[1:38:27] but we have this one consolation
[1:38:33] that our faith rests
[1:38:36] in a perfect sacrifice
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; that has already been received.
[1:38:44] So when we begin to consider
[1:38:47] that in the in the in the days of the of
[1:38:50] the of the Levitical law and the the
[1:38:52] time when you know man brother said oh
[1:38:55] if we could just offer a lamb it would
[1:38:57] be so easy. He said it's easier now.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; It's easier now.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; You just have to believe.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; All right. Amen. And so but in that day
[1:39:08] they they they they would on the for on
[1:39:11] the 10th day of the month the worshipper
[1:39:14] would come he would have inspected his
[1:39:16] own lamb first. He would have done the
[1:39:19] very best that he could. He would have
[1:39:20] he would have made sure that that lamb
[1:39:22] was healthy. He would have made sure
[1:39:23] that all of its you know features and
[1:39:25] functions and everything was acceptable
[1:39:28] best to his knowledge.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; And then he would take that lamb and he
[1:39:32] would offer that lamb. He would take it
[1:39:34] to the priest. Now, the priest would
[1:39:36] take it on the 10th day and he would
[1:39:38] keep that lamb up until the 14th day.
[1:39:44] AND DURING THAT TIME, HE WOULD INSPECT
[1:39:46] THAT LAMB. HE would look at it. He would
[1:39:48] look through its its wool. HE WOULD
[1:39:50] CHECK ITS EYES, MAKE SURE IT WASN'T
[1:39:52] BLIND, make sure that when he fed it
[1:39:54] that it he would ingest, digest,
[1:39:57] manifest. He would HE WOULD HAVE ALL THE
[1:40:00] uh his features would all be working. He
[1:40:03] wouldn't be lame. He wouldn't be
[1:40:04] limping. HE WOULD INSPECT THAT LAMB,
[1:40:06] scrutinize for four days.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; At the end of four days, he would take
[1:40:13] that lamb and he would take it to the
[1:40:16] altar and there he would slay the lamb
[1:40:18] and the lamb would bleed for the
[1:40:21] worshipper.
[1:40:24] But I want to call something to your
[1:40:25] ATTENTION THAT DURING THIS TIME OF
[1:40:29] INSPECTION
[1:40:31] AND THIS TIME OF SCRUTINIZATION,
[1:40:34] DURING THIS TIME OF EXAMINATION AND AND
[1:40:37] PURIFICATION AND ALL THESE THINGS, AT NO
[1:40:40] time
[1:40:43] did he ever consider the worshipper.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; He only
[1:40:51] considered
[1:40:52] the lamb.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THIS MORNING, IF
[1:40:57] GOD WAS GOING TO INSPECT US, HE WOULD
[1:41:00] FIND ALL KINDS OF FLAWS. HE WOULD FIND
[1:41:03] ALL KINDS OF DISCREPANCIES AND
[1:41:06] WEAKNESSES AND MENTAL DURESS AND
[1:41:09] NERVOUSNESS AND ANXIETY AND LUST AND
[1:41:13] EVERY KIND OF HABIT. OH, BUT LET ME TELL
[1:41:16] YOU THIS MORNING THAT THE BLOOD OF JESUS
[1:41:19] SPEAKETH BETTER THINGS THAN THAT OF ABEL
[1:41:22] AND THAT OF MOSES AND THAT OF ISAIAH.
[1:41:25] OH, BUT IT'S HERE TO TELL YOU THIS
[1:41:28] MORNING THAT HE'S SPEAKING PEACE.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; HE'S SPEAKING LOVE. HE'S SPEAKING MERCY
[1:41:34] BECAUSE HE ONLY considered the lamb.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; One lamb for all. Amen. And he WAS
[1:41:45] ENOUGH. OH MY. AN OLD song of the church
[1:41:48] says that one drop
[1:41:50] of his blood can cleanse 10,000 souls.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Brother said if we had that blood
[1:42:00] in a charger this morning, he said it
[1:42:03] wouldn't be as valuable
[1:42:05] as those that it purchased.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; That you're the purchase of that blood
[1:42:10] this morning.
[1:42:12] He said, ' THEN HOW DO WE KNOW that we
[1:42:14] get that? When the worshipper
[1:42:18] puts his hands BY FAITH UPON THE BODY OF
[1:42:22] THE LORD Jesus
[1:42:25] feels the these are the words of a God
[1:42:29] sent prophet. HE SAID FEELS the terror
[1:42:34] of sin. Hallelujah.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; The mark of spit in his own face,
[1:42:43] FEELS the groanings of Gethsemane,
[1:42:47] the agonies of Calvary,
[1:42:50] and knows
[1:42:54] that he is guilty.
[1:42:56] You are guilty. I am guilty.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; And confesses his sins correctly. Amen.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed Lord, I'm guilty. I have no
[1:43:08] other way but you to help me. And by
[1:43:12] faith,
[1:43:14] the Holy Spirit has come and bids me
[1:43:17] come. And I now by faith accept Jesus as
[1:43:21] my personal savior.
[1:43:23] That life that come from him on Calvary
[1:43:27] called the Holy Ghost which was hid in
[1:43:30] the blood in the blood cell of the Lord
[1:43:33] Jesus returns to the worshipper and
[1:43:37] baptizes him with the Holy Ghost into
[1:43:40] the body of Christ.
[1:43:42] I say that, my friends, is the gospel
[1:43:45] that our first messenger preached to us
[1:43:48] when Paul said, "I'm determined to know
[1:43:50] nothing among you save Christ and him
[1:43:53] crucified."
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; That same gospel was preached by our
[1:43:58] seventh messenger. And may it be
[1:44:01] preached this morning. May you hear it
[1:44:02] from the bottoms of your heart and say,
[1:44:05] "Lord, I accept.
[1:44:07] I receive.
[1:44:09] I believe." Let's stand to our feet this
[1:44:12] morning
[1:44:15] as our pastor comes.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to
[1:44:22] pray with you this morning as we change
[1:44:25] the order of this service, but not in
[1:44:29] any rush to get out. Just want to make
[1:44:32] the opportunity tell you a little story.
[1:44:35] our heads bowed, our hearts before the
[1:44:38] Lord in humble adoration.
[1:44:43] There was a preacher by the name of DL
[1:44:44] Moody back just prior to the during the
[1:44:48] time of the Civil War. There was a great
[1:44:51] fire in Chicago. Burned the whole city.
[1:44:55] Hundreds of people died. It's terrible
[1:44:57] time. Just prior to that fire,
[1:45:04] Dwight Moody was had a had a meeting.
[1:45:07] And in that meeting, he had preached
[1:45:09] four or five nights.
[1:45:12] He was going to continue the meeting the
[1:45:14] next week.
[1:45:18] And so that night of the last night of
[1:45:21] the meeting, he bowed the hearts of the
[1:45:24] people and he prayed for them. He
[1:45:26] dismissed them. And he said, "I want you
[1:45:27] to think upon these things for a week,
[1:45:30] and when you come back next week, we
[1:45:33] want you to make a decision for Christ."
[1:45:37] And he let the people go that night. And
[1:45:39] little did he know that many of those
[1:45:41] people would not return because the fire
[1:45:45] came and many of them died.
[1:45:51] A tragedy, loss of life, all these
[1:45:54] things.
[1:45:56] But DL Moody said,
[1:45:58] he said, "From that day forward," he
[1:46:00] said, "I knew that I could never dismiss
[1:46:03] a service
[1:46:05] without giving the people an opportunity
[1:46:10] to make a decision for Christ."
[1:46:14] With our heads bowed this morning,
[1:46:16] friends, if you've never chose to follow
[1:46:19] the Lord, I would I would implore you
[1:46:22] today
[1:46:24] to slip your hand to God and say, "I'm a
[1:46:28] sinner.
[1:46:30] Lord, be merciful to me. Let me let me
[1:46:34] correctly repent this morning and accept
[1:46:38] that supreme sacrifice
[1:46:41] that I could be part of that ransom host
[1:46:45] of God that I could be a Christian. I
[1:46:48] want to be a Christian more than I want
[1:46:50] anything in this world. I want to be a
[1:46:53] son and daughter of God.
[1:46:56] As we pray this morning, I I trust
[1:46:58] you'll pray with me. I've prayed this
[1:47:01] prayer in many nations around the world
[1:47:04] over the course of 40 plus years.
[1:47:09] I don't believe it'll ever come back to
[1:47:11] us void. Believe it's the word of God.
[1:47:14] It's not just a tradition of men. It's
[1:47:17] not just some old theology.
[1:47:21] Because I never had theology. I was
[1:47:22] raised a dirty sinner,
[1:47:25] drug addict,
[1:47:27] filthy person. But Christ came
[1:47:30] saved me from my sins. And
[1:47:33] if there's ever anything I could do to
[1:47:36] win some soul to Christ, I say, Lord,
[1:47:38] help me to win that soul to thee. I
[1:47:41] pray, Father, this morning we bow our
[1:47:44] hearts in humble adoration.
[1:47:47] Lord, that you have bid us come, come
[1:47:50] now to thee, Lord, just as I am, without
[1:47:53] one plea.
[1:47:55] But Lord, that thy blood was shed for me
[1:47:59] on that old dark cross. That day when it
[1:48:03] was a day of all days when the when God
[1:48:06] himself came down in Christ to reconcile
[1:48:10] the world to himself.
[1:48:12] I pray, Father, for these your children,
[1:48:15] Lord. Many I know are are devout
[1:48:17] Christians. They loved you for many
[1:48:19] years, and I know they love you even
[1:48:22] still today.
[1:48:24] But Lord, if we've waned in our
[1:48:26] experience, if we've allowed the world
[1:48:28] to creep in, if we've allowed the the
[1:48:31] the the the
[1:48:35] cares of life to drag us down and to to
[1:48:41] live beneath our privilege this morning,
[1:48:44] could we come as David said, and let us
[1:48:47] not forget all of his benefits.
[1:48:51] For the blood of Jesus has every
[1:48:53] redemptive promise laying in it. Lord, I
[1:48:57] accept that blood as the atonement for
[1:48:59] my sins. The only means of salvation is
[1:49:02] through the bleeding word of this day.
[1:49:05] Lord, we pray God that you'll help us
[1:49:07] each one. Lord, that you'll burn this
[1:49:10] message down deep in our souls that we
[1:49:13] could that we could walk with you every
[1:49:16] day in the light of God's word and the
[1:49:19] blood of Jesus would cleanse us from all
[1:49:21] sins.
[1:49:23] We'll thank you for it as we give you
[1:49:26] all the praise and honor and glory that
[1:49:29] all sufficient name of the Lord Jesus
[1:49:31] Christ. We pray.
[1:49:34] Amen and amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:49:39] Oh, I love him. I love him.
[1:49:44] Hallelujah. I love him.
[1:49:48] Oh, that you probably don't know that
[1:49:49] song. Uh because he first loved me. How
[1:49:52] do we How's that go? Ah, that's it. I
[1:49:56] love him.
[1:49:59] Oh, I
[1:50:03] I love him.
[1:50:06] All because God bless you, brother Jack.
[1:50:10] He first
[1:50:12] loved me
[1:50:15] and purchase
[1:50:18] and
[1:50:19] burn
[1:50:21] just my
[1:50:24] salvation.
[1:50:30] Old
[1:50:31] C
[1:50:37] tree. Come on, sing it again. I love
[1:50:40] him. I love him. Oh,
[1:50:44] I
[1:50:47] love him.
[1:50:51] I
[1:50:54] love him
[1:50:57] because
[1:51:00] he first
[1:51:02] loved me
[1:51:08] and
[1:51:10] birth
[1:51:12] just my
[1:51:14] salvation.
[1:51:16] ation
[1:51:21] on camp
[1:51:28] tree.
[1:51:34] Hallelujah.
[1:51:41] This a another little song. This I'm
[1:51:44] gonna have the drum drop out. Just says
[1:51:48] Jesus is the sweetest name
[1:51:52] I know
[1:51:56] and he's just the same
[1:52:02] as his holy name.
[1:52:09] That's the reason why I love
[1:52:15] him so.
[1:52:19] Oh,
[1:52:21] Jesus
[1:52:23] is the sweetest
[1:52:25] name I know.
[1:52:31] And I love
[1:52:34] him.
[1:52:38] Yes,
[1:52:40] I love
[1:52:42] him.
[1:52:46] He's the only
[1:52:49] one true lover of my soul.
[1:52:57] Yes, I love him.
[1:53:04] Oh,
[1:53:06] I love him.
[1:53:12] He's the only
[1:53:14] one, true lover of my soul.
[1:53:24] Come on, let's give him a hand of
[1:53:25] praise.
[1:53:28] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:53:34] Oh, through
[1:53:37] the blood.
[1:53:41] Through
[1:53:44] the blood.
[1:53:47] Oh, we can come
[1:53:50] into his presence

[1:54:39] into his presence is through the blood.
[1:54:45] Through the blood Jesus has
[1:54:53] made a way.
[1:54:57] Thank you, Jesus. We can come
[1:55:03] oh into his his presences through the
[1:55:07] blood.
[1:55:09] Come on one more time. Through the
[1:55:11] blood.
[1:55:14] Through
[1:55:15] through the blood.
[1:55:18] Yes. It's through.
[1:55:21] Hallelujah. That precious blood we can
[1:55:26] come
[1:55:27] into his presence. Yes.
[1:55:32] Through
[1:55:33] the blood Jesus
[1:55:42] made a way.
[1:55:47] Oh,
[1:55:48] we can come
[1:55:51] into his presence
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; through
[1:55:57] the
[1:56:01] Come on and give the Lord a hand of
[1:56:03] praise.
[1:56:06] Thank God for the blood. It still
[1:56:09] speaks.
[1:56:11] It speaks greater things than the blood
[1:56:14] of uh Abel. We certainly appreciate
[1:56:17] brother Dale on this morning.
[1:56:22] Wonderful.
[1:56:24] Wonderful, wonderful thought. Amen.
[1:56:28] Given to our hearts. And I just love um
[1:56:32] how the Lord just kind of led him
[1:56:33] through. and just never really caught
[1:56:36] how uh we always talked about how Abel
[1:56:39] had a revelation and how he knew to
[1:56:42] offer
[1:56:44] um blood where his brother was offering
[1:56:47] fruit of the ground and things of that
[1:56:49] nature and and uh but Abel had this
[1:56:52] revelation because brother Brandham said
[1:56:54] he already saw Christ
[1:56:58] that that was it. He had a God had given
[1:57:00] him a vision of the lamb being slain
[1:57:03] before the foundation of the world. Abel
[1:57:06] had that revelation. Based on his
[1:57:09] revelation, he was able to offer certain
[1:57:12] sacrifice.
[1:57:13] And here here Cain just didn't have it.
[1:57:15] God never showed it to him. But he told
[1:57:18] him said, "Now if you can do the same
[1:57:19] thing that your brother's doing, then
[1:57:20] I'll receive it." And I love the way
[1:57:22] brother Dale brought that. Had Cain
[1:57:24] accepted that then he would have also
[1:57:26] had to accept the revelation of the
[1:57:28] serpent seed
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; that would that's powerful right he
[1:57:33] would have had to understand the
[1:57:34] revelation of the serpent seat actually
[1:57:36] how he got here
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; it would have changed everything and he
[1:57:42] didn't want he didn't want nothing to do
[1:57:43] with that
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; so he kills his brother I tell you that
[1:57:47] was just powerful and and then all to
[1:57:50] wind it all the way up to the end and
[1:57:52] you know when We sometimes we we we we
[1:57:55] we
[1:57:57] get caught in just uh just the mistakes
[1:58:01] that we've made, the failures that we
[1:58:03] have in our own life. And and um you
[1:58:06] know, Satan's always bombarding us. You
[1:58:09] did this, you did that, you did this.
[1:58:12] God will never receive you because you
[1:58:14] did this, because you did that. And and
[1:58:16] often times if we're not if we're not
[1:58:18] careful, Amen. We always look at what we
[1:58:21] did, but we never look to see what he
[1:58:25] did.
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; And he said when when the when in the
[1:58:30] Old Testament, they would always bring
[1:58:31] their sacrifice for their sins. They
[1:58:32] give it to the priests. And and the
[1:58:34] priest when you he takes it on the 10th
[1:58:36] day, he's holding it to the 14th day.
[1:58:38] But when he takes it on the 10th day,
[1:58:40] once you give him that, he never looks
[1:58:43] at you again.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; The priest never sees you anymore. He's
[1:58:47] looking at the sacrifice that you
[1:58:49] brought and all your sins are placed
[1:58:51] over over the head of this lamb. We had
[1:58:55] a lamb that was slain for our sins.
[1:58:58] Let's look at what he did, not what we
[1:59:00] did. Not what we do. Let's look at what
[1:59:02] he's already done. Amen. This This is a
[1:59:05] finished work. This is a finished work.
[1:59:07] I tell you, you ought to leave here.
[1:59:09] Amen. Excited to serve the Lord. Amen.
[1:59:12] Because there's nothing like the blood
[1:59:14] of Jesus.
[1:59:16] What can wash away?
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, nothing but the blood.
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; And what can make me whole?
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[1:59:45] Oh, precious.

[1:59:56] makes me white.

[2:00:48] in the blood?

[2:01:24] cleansing blood.

[2:05:13] Lord, for the word that has been brought
[2:05:15] to us.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; Your blood is still speaking.
[2:05:21] Another songwriter says, "It reaches to
[2:05:23] the highest mountain and it flows
[2:05:25] through the lowest valley.
[2:05:29] The blood that gives me strength
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; from day to day,
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; it will never lose its power.
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; Father, I I I I thank you for your
[2:05:42] servant just getting himself out of the
[2:05:44] way, Lord, to to speak this to our
[2:05:46] hearts. And Lord, many of us needed to
[2:05:49] hear. I know there were so many things
[2:05:51] spoken, Father, here that that just
[2:05:53] blessed me, God. And sometimes when the
[2:05:56] enemy coming to Lord bombard our minds
[2:05:59] with with with you did this and you did
[2:06:01] that when we just get a good glimpse of
[2:06:04] the blood.
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; Realize Lord that you're not looking at
[2:06:08] us but you're looking at the sacrifice
[2:06:10] that was paid on the cross at Calvary.
[2:06:14] Lord the perfect sacrifice that was made
[2:06:17] for us. Lord, help us, Father, to lay
[2:06:19] our hands on that and to identify

[2:07:19] given for us. We never want to do
