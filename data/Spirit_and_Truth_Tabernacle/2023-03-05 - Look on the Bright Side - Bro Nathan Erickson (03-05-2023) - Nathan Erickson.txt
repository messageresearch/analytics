do offering things change when covet came but uh but nonetheless actually I like it this way because in the Bible what do used to have is in the Old Testament they just had a box in the back that people would just give in they didn't have to stop the service and try to and do the offering so I don't like breaking anointing that's just me anything I can do to not break an anointing I'll do it

prayer Heavenly Father we just thank you Lord for a positive gospel this morning Lord that Lord we can look into your word today Father and Lord by this open book lord we can receive a message of encouragement Lord You've not given us the spirit of fear Lord or of worry but of a sound mind father for Lord You've ushered us into this age of Capstone love father and we have a personal relationship with you Lord from where we draw our strength we draw our encouragement Lord and we we we draw Lord everything that we have need of from you father Lord we don't confess the abilities of a man Lord for our abilities or frail Lord and in insufficient but Lord what we're looking for today Lord is for your Holy Spirit to come amongst us Lord with your quickening power Lord may you be the speaker of the word I pray father may you be The Interpreter Lord may you just open it up to every heart Lord in a personal way for we believe that you're still a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the Heart Lord father in our human Minds Lord we struggle with doubts Lord we there are many there are many things Lord in the atmosphere of this world Lord which are warring with our faith Lord I think even as your Prophet Lord took the platform on time lord and he he spoke of waves of Doubt Lord that he would feel coming from the audience Lord waves of interference but oh father he spoke of wave after wave of Faith Lord wave after wave of your glory Lord Jesus that's what we're looking for father that you come amongst us Lord May there be a transmission of Faith Lord that could not be hindered Lord by the efforts of the enemy but father may we just worship you and fellowship with your lord word father with wave after way of your presence we pray we dedicate ourselves to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you as you're seated this morning amen just look on the bright side and so we've read this uh this very familiar scripture and of course brother Branham uses the scripture as the text of the message Shalom amen it's a message that was uh specifically to the Bride of Jesus Christ it was not to the public but it's our personal it's our if you will our private message that we receive from the Throne of God a message of Shalom now now uh to receive this message you have to receive it in the context of the environment amen because this prophecy that's speaking of a light that is coming to God's elect amen is also speaking of a Darkness that's going to be on the in in the earth amen there's going to be a Darkness on the earth amen but but uh and and and a gross or a heavy amen or a thick Darkness would be on the hearts of the people amen amen and we're we're all living in the same world in the same you know uh age and environment that we we see this Darkness amen this is is a fulfilled scripture we it's a dark time it's a it's a very very dark time on the earth in natural uh you know natural ways and in cultural ways and in every way it's a dark time to be alive amen and not only is it dark in the world but there's a heavy Darkness that's on the hearts of the people Everyone that you work with everyone you rub shoulders within this world you you can see the weight of it beginning to balish the shoulders of the people why because uh because there is a darkness that has come on the earth the people can't help themselves it's a prophetic time it's a time a prophetic fulfillment amen the message spoke of the darkness amen that would come on the people it would weigh them down it would keep them discouraged it would it would hide their eyes you know from the word of God Amen but the message is not about Darkness but the message came to Herald the light amen amen and so many times we're guilty even as message Believers of putting our emphasis and putting our eyes on all of the darkness of this time but that darkness is not your message the message that came to you came to point your eyes and and and and and and straighten out your vision so that you could see that as dark as this world is as heavy as the people are there is a light amen there is a present light amen amongst the Bride of Jesus Christ we're just laying a little Foundation here just bear with me but that's the message Shalom amen shalom it's a it's a it's a greeting amen it's a greeting it's an identification it has a it's a there's a recipient amen of this greeting amen the message to you is shalom shalom we know means good morning good morning God's peace be upon you amen amen good morning it's a it's a good Sunrise it's a good light amen it's a it's a good time it's a to be part of this people it's a good people amen and that is your identification Shalom is a message of identification every message brother Brandon preached was a message of identification and he's identifying you amen not with the darkness that's in the world but you are identified with the light amen is that right the message rising of the sun there is a sunrise amen amen and you are identified in that son you're identified in the Son of God Amen you're identified in the son of man so your light has come amen our light has come has come past that friends we in this time and this place we are fellowshipping amen with a light that is not coming but he is here he is present he is manifested among us we're basking in the light of the sun amen amen right now right here brother Branham said to think that the same Pillar of Fire that came on the men that wrote the Bible is the same Pillar of Fire here today interpreting the Bible amen what a comfort he said what identification I don't know about you but that's my identification amen I'm not identified by putting a sign out on the road that says you know a message Tabernacle I'm not identified by a picture hanging on a wall but my identification is the present atmosphere of the light of the pillar of fire the same one that wrote the Bible is in our midst he's manifesting himself and that is the light that we're walking in what an identification I'd rather be identified in that than all the Baptist Methodist Presbyterian Lutheran all the rest of them but identified in that word where the Shekinah Glory lays where Revelation Lays that's what the message is all about friends it's a word of identification it's not a message about what's happening around you but it's a message about who you are and your identification is Shalom amen it's a good word spoken over you it's a good it's a good it's a good greeting it's good news your future looks bright France now every time God sends a message it's twofold to the world it's a message of judgment but at the same time the world is receiving judgment amen God's elect are receiving a message of Grace your message is not indictment a prophet came he put he spoke indictment over this world indictment over religious systems indictment over denominations indictment over politics indictment over culture but to you it's shalom hallelujah it's God's light shining upon you identification friends we just can't look at it enough amen amen we look at this world around us we get so discouraged sometimes looking at all the negativity amen of this time but don't worry about the negativity it's prophesied that it would be here it's prophesied it would be dark it's prophesied that people would be heavy but it's also prophesied that there be a a chosen elected bride that would receive the light of her hour now of course we sigh and cry for the Abominations Amen brother Bram I believe one place said that's an Evidence of the Holy Ghost evidence of God's seed if we shy and we cry to see what's happened to our churches to see what's happened to our country to see what's happened to our world to our you know to to to to to to mankind amen but sodom's not our identification we sigh over Sodom we cry over Sodom but we don't belong to it it doesn't have a claim on us we're called out people we've come out amen we've separated God's word calls for so total separation for unbelief amen and calls for a holy life it calls for a separated life amen but you know God's word doesn't just call for separation God's word offers separation when the way to this world's getting you down when you're tired of all the darkness God's word offers a provided way where a child of God can get into the light forget about the darkness amen it offers a separation friends and we have been separated from Sodom Sodom is not our identification this message did not place you under Fire in Brimstone and judgment but you've been called out you know where you're at you're in Abraham's tent hey you're not inside them you're not you're not part of this thing you're not rubbing shoulders with it you're separated you're in Abraham's tent amen what's happening in Abraham's tent God's there in the flesh bodies are changing amen a supernatural God has revealed himself not to Sodom but he's revealing himself to you Hallelujah we get so discouraged we get looking around like brother Brown said about Jonah amen he got he got in such a condition everywhere he looked his whale Billy everywhere he looked was stinking whale Billy that's where we get as Christians sometimes where we feel like everywhere we look is a bunch of stinking failure just a bunch of oh just stinking religion misery amen amen hypocrisy friends but by the light of this message you realize you're not looking at whale belly but everywhere you look is tent walls cause you're in Abraham's tent you got tent Vision amen hallelujah you've been shut in with God he said I'll meet you in there I won't identify you with this layout of seeing world but I'll call you out and I'll take you to a secret place where there's hidden power I'll meet you in there that's where he wants to bring us where the weight of this world don't get us down amen he wants to call us out of our religion call us out of our churchianity and get us to Christ Hallelujah [Music] brother bran said the one who I've heard but now I see he said the one who stayed back with Abraham performed a miracle told Abraham what stair was doing and thinking and Jesus who was the one who was in that person he said when this world gets to a Sodom condition the son of man will be revealed again and now he said we see that same promised word of Luke of Malachi all these other promises are made flesh they're dwelling amongst us and that which we heard with our ears now we see him with our eyes interpreting his own word we don't need any interpretation of man we don't need it church we don't need any man's idea we come far enough with this message what we don't need is somebody's idea about it what we don't need is some man's Doctrine what we don't need is some new teaching what we don't need is some new messenger what we don't need is some new personality but what we need is to have our eyes open and realize that this message that we heard is becoming flesh and materializing right before our very eyes Amen to realize whose presence that we're in these are not the thoughts of a man this is the body word of the son of man and that body's not laying in a intellectual tomb amen but the anointing of God is here amongst the bread of Jesus Christ to make the word of God live right bring the very life of Jesus Christ manifested in the flesh again we we don't need a new message we need a revelation of the message we need a revelation of what we've heard I've heard but now I see amen amen we feel that pressure of this age that pressure brother Bram said it's supposed to be there that's the light in you pressing against the darkness amen it's not so much this age it's pressing on you but you're pressing on this age amen it's not you that you know you walk into Walmart and as somebody look at you funny because of your modest apparel and because of your Christian Holiness you never pressed on there amen or then they never you your light pressed on them there's a pressure that we feel it goes both ways friends but what it is it means that the light is here the light has come that's why we're under pressure cause we got the light amen it'll change our attitude when we see what God is doing brother Bram didn't brother bran say is it came up to that Capstone it would be refined it would come down he said it would just come down smaller and smaller to the point of that Capstone he said it would become more in the minority smaller in number but greater in power smaller a number but it's greater in power amen hallelujah brother Jack was sharing his testimony about the mega church that he worked for you know said well why don't you just close up and you all come and sit under us we'll give you a position we'll give you I tell you if they recognize whose presence they were in they would have shut down and said you take this church you take this community you take this people why because their eyes aren't open friends but we've been long enough under this message we ought to be able to see what's happening amen it's nothing less than Jesus Christ the son of man taking flesh not just in a Ministry but in men and women and boys and girls that are walking in the light of this age what does it produce amen God In the Flesh that's the light of this day walking in it Hallelujah brother Brown preach you Shalom and you realize what it costs a prophet to preach it to you hear you take brother Branham just look at the circumstances of it brother Branham had a worldwide Ministry a global Ministry brother Branham preached to tense he preached a meeting in South Africa I believe it was 30 000 people came to the Lord in one service that's where God's Eagle had flown amen now look at him in 1965. amen all of his friends have rejected him all of his comrades all of his associates had turned their back on him the denominations had cut him off nobody wanted to have him preach in his church amen he went in the great City of Phoenix and not a Perth not a church wanted to have him and now he's in a house in the backside of the desert preaching a little handful of people oh friends you think a prophet was discouraged sure he felt the pain of rejection you can you you listen the message you know a little time in the ministry has taught me to pick up on those things how you listen to brother Brandon you hear the hurt you hear that rejection you feel the pain of it sure he felt it friends but did it change that message could it change his calling could it change that anointing no France he didn't preach a message of discouragement he preached you Shalom he preached you Victory Day they wouldn't let it do it in Omega Church so he did it in a house knowing someone would receive his message Hallelujah that's your identification friends amen it might come down just to the end you know that that that that that was the circumstances listen to brother Brandon preach around that time he said you know it gets to a place where it looks like the message and the messenger just about defeated looks like it's all run out looks like you come to the Twilight of his ministry friends brother Brown said God lets it get that way that's when he steps in amen and he rides the highways like brother Jack said that's what we're riding on Amen not my Ministry not my calling not your your religion but all Jesus Christ himself stepped into our boat he's in our boat so we'll Crest every wave amen we'll get to the destination because we're riding on it riding on it Glory amen comes right right down to the End Amen the angel of the Lord himself we say oh brother Nathan's getting so dark so many people walking away it's getting discouraging brother it was the hand it was the angel of the Lord himself wrote it on the wall of this layout of cnh how it would get down to just a minority just a little it'd be so dark in the layout of cnh it would get down just to a little sliver brother Ronnie from our church was just preaching this I love he said you realize that's not empty space that little sliver that's not empty space that's light that's light you say oh you know you know people don't uh people don't come like they used to people don't believe it like they used to church is not growing like it used to it's not the way it used to be but it's light it's light and it doesn't matter how dark it gets it'll never extinguish God's true light hey man let it pull away let the shut come friends we gotta recognize that we're in the day recognize your day in its message not recognize the night recognize the day it is the rising of the sun amen it's a oh it's a brand new morning brother Brown said you know it's beginning to pull away and and the Wheats begin to see amen we've had shuck pull away denominations pulled away neighbors pull away family pull away and so-called message Believers pulling away from the true message amen but it's so that the wheat can be seen this is not a Pentecostal age this is the Latter-Day age this is the bright age this is the evening light amen what is the evening light it's the bright age I'm trying to tell you it's your day amen it's Darkness on the world but the sun is rising over you it's your age it's your time it's your season this light has come for you God didn't send a light in to laodicea to make us impressed with what he could do through a prophet amen but he sent a prophet for a bride you are the Reason God sent a prophet you are the one he saw dressed in white you're the one who looked beyond the veil and you were resting on his words you're the one he saw take the book you're the one that ate it you're the one that prophesies you're the final voice to the final age you're the light you are the evening light Larry amen amen Luke spoke about it Malachi Jeremiah Joel air all the rest of them spoke of this day all I've heard Lord it was coming but now I see it with my eye that's your identification your identifications with the light amen now let's lingle there a little bit how many know that light in the Bible is manifested word manifested word when the word is manifested it's light amen you say oh God said let there be light he sure did and if you ever doubt it amen just walk outside in the morning and watch the rising of the Sun and you'll see the manifestation of the word and it's light amen so light speaks of an experienced word a manifested word a living word that's the kind of word that I'm interested friends I'm not interested in getting around and playing Church you know and just having a and just falling after a certain tradition and joining a group and getting under a good pastor and believing God sent a prophet and all those kind of things friends I'm looking for light I'm looking for a manifest head I want this thing to be real in my life and in your life friends amen that's why I don't believe in you know a dry-eyed religion I don't believe in in worship without passion without friends brother Brianna said we have no enthusiasm today because it doesn't seem to strike us right come on instead of like taking a match you know hey you take a match and if they don't have that sulfur on it if they don't have the right mechanics oh strike It Strike It Strike it all you want it'll never burn it'll never produce light he said there will be no light it won't strike but if that chemical amen when the genuine true Vindication of the scriptures of this last day message when you see the presence of Jesus Christ just before the Sodom condition is fired over with the wrath of God you see Jesus return amongst his people formed in human flesh and do the same thing he done it what I did to do he said it ought to strike our souls to glory and ought to do something to us why it's dropping on that it's dropping on that I just love that oh it's dropping on that God put a warrant over you it's dropping on you amen but there's something in you that can respond to the word it brings up power it brings a light it brings a flame Hallelujah mechanics and the Dynamics together the word is light friends but only when it's manifested only if it's manifested is it light otherwise you might belong to a you know you might sit under the evening light you might hear it preached you might belong to a good message church with a good message pastor and not walk in the light be as dark as you can be why this word has got to be manifested in and to and through you that's what I'm interested in Friends the word is light but only when it's manifested why do we see so much organized religion around the message why do we see so much denominationalism why do we see a Discord among the Brethren why do we see formality they're not walking into light they're not walking in the light amen but but they have the word oh brother Nathan we got the word we're a word church it's a word the word the word we don't need all that you know jumping and shouting screaming you all you know clapping on the offbeat and all that kind of thing that's for the Pentecostals we got the word brother Brandon said the body you know the body word he said yeah that's Christ Christ was the word but he said Christ means the anointed one amen and if he's the same yesterday today and forever if he's the word then the word is the anointing I said the word is the anointing you say we got the word not if you don't have the anointing amen not without the holy ghost moving through the church touching Hearts brooding over the people filling our children with the Holy Ghost opening blind eyes Healing The Sick delivering the bound amen the words the anointing it's not a theory it's not a Doctrine we're not a Reformed Church we're a restored Church back to the anointing of God brother bran said the word is God the anointing is a person it's a person amen the anointing is not emotion amen it's supreme power and control but I tell you when supreme power drops into church takes control of a man takes control of a woman speaks the very words he would speak through that individual oh you'll feel something you might get a little emotional why amen because this is not just our form this is not just our tradition of worship it's the presence of Jesus Christ the light of God anointing the church making this word live that's why we got people preach this word to the blue in the face and they'll never make the rapture because when the anointing manifests itself they kick it out the anointing is a person like song We Sing back home the word has a name and it's Jesus Prince the word has a name now if I went out you know to eat yesterday imagine we had a nice dinner with brother Jack his sister Erica and you know just imagine we went out to eat and I sat there at the table talked to sister Erica sister Erica it's so wonderful to be here with your husband I just you know I just love and admire your husband he's a real Hugh he's a real hero to me and you guys got a great husband I just can't believe I get to be here you know and just fellowship with your husband I went on like that a little bit she might get to look at me funny say you know my husband has a name in other words what does that mean he's right here why don't you talk to him why don't you look to him why don't you spend a little time with him he's here friends we've had so much preaching of the word but the word has a name it has a presence it has an anointing it's got a power it's got a life it's got an atmosphere amen quit preaching about the word start living with this word talking to this word spend a little time with this word amen it's alive it's real amen when you walk in this light the Bible the Bible says walk in the light why because he's in the light so if you walk in the light you're walking with him hey man hey man you're not a slightly better church with slightly better Doctrine you have been restored back to the day of Pentecost to the faith of the apostolic fathers amen there's no system got a hold of you there's no denominator it's you and God it's the pillar of fire on the inside of you by a personal relationship matter of fact you've gotten farther back than that but we've been restored back to an eating condition and an eating condition in Eden there are no prophets there are no priests there are no preachers there are no presbyters there are no pastors amen there's no mediator but it's a son or a daughter of God walking and talking with the creator of the universe this word has a name [Applause] it's a personal presence we got the word brother Nathan the word ain't enough sometimes oh I'm gonna need a quote on that I'm glad you asked brother Brandon preached about the road to Emmaus those two disciples walked with him they were walking with Jesus they didn't recognize it they were walking with I'll use some I'll quote him directly I'm I'm collapsing it down but I'll use some of these very phrases brother Brown used there they are with the resurrected Messiah he was revealing the word he was expounding to them the scriptures he preached the word he read it out of the Bible and brother Brown said and they still didn't get it what did it take it takes him coming in when I get down to the end of the road friends you can walk with Jesus you can hear this word preach you can talk about this word and it could be the resurrected Messiah coming down on Sunday morning and anointed your god-called pastor to preach the very Word of Life over you and expound the truth of the scriptures to you but until he comes inside and breaks the bread of life to you personally by a personal presence it's not enough it's not enough amen the personal presence the intellectual mind can never see it and we got so much intellectual Faith around this message they'll claim this message they'll quote this message you get out in the parking lot to swap quotes and so they'll try to blow your mind to prove how spiritual they are and they've never even met Jesus amen the message didn't come to produce that but the message came to introduce us to a personal God who is able to break the word to you like no teacher can break it like no preacher can break it only Jesus can make it live only Jesus can give it only through Jesus does it give you strength friends amen so much formalism so much intellectualism so much of it friends hey man brother Bram said intellectual Faith won't get you anywhere can I get off my notes a little bit this morning intellectual faith will not get you anywhere now intellectual Faith ain't bad faith Brother Band says there's two phases to Faith it's not bad faith but it's faith that hasn't been quickened yet I I I I don't have a lot of time to linger here but let me say this friends intellectual Faith isn't what we always think it is you know an intellectual Church you say oh I know you know intellectual that's you know they they're cold and formal and they sit around like a bump on a pickle dry no amen no rays in her hand you realize most of the time brother bran preaches on intellectual Faith he's preaching in Pentecostals Pentecostals amen now brother bran said intellectual Faith won't get you anywhere it might get you emotional but it won't get you the healing you're looking for now see you got to be careful now now you take you talk about formalism formal's not what you think it is now at our church we jump we Shout we worship amen we dance we do it without Rhythm but we dance anyway amen y'all pray for us we gotta we got a melanin shortage amen we gotta get what brother Jack get on Exchange program [Laughter] we worship we dance that's normal at my church I'm glad it is amen but see formal is normal sometimes what's normal at your church amen you can be normal in your church and be formal you understand what I'm saying the message didn't come to you know to cut it up and put shouting churches over here and teaching churches over here and get us all fire and shots of one another friends the message came to introduce the personal presence of Jesus Christ now wherever he is there's noise wherever he is there was worship but it won't be a formal thing friends but we'll dance and jump and scream and shout our way to a Rapture cause we're walking in the light with an ever-present helping God formal's normal I do not want to be guilty of normal Christianity gotta get to Christ are we really getting them to Christ or are we just getting into church but you got to go past the church to get to Jesus Christ that all right today amen gotta walk in the light oh that's what it'll take when he comes and he breaks the bread of life brother babe said that's my Ministry to declare him that he's here he didn't come to educate the church he didn't come to oh we're not Pentecostals with slightly better Church order we're not Baptists with slightly better worship we are a restored bride and what we have been restored to is the personal indwelling of the creator of the universe it is the same Pillar of Fire that led Moses has busted itself up as on the day of Pentecost amen oh yeah it congealed over the head of a prophet to vindicate a message to you but it's not there now amen it's hidden from the world it's veiled where is it you brought it to church with you it's a pillar of fire God's Own Zoe life that's why we're that's why we feel that Shekinah glory amen come right amongst us it's him it's his presence oh friends how could we look at the darkness when we're walking in such a Marvelous Light how could the darkness so much how could it affect us how could we even be conscious of this wicked age in his presence that's what we need more of is his presence his atmosphere our pastor has been teaching a little bit at home on the on that presence on his coming took the three Greek words in the Bible for his coming one of them is paracia his personal presence I know they make doctrines out of that can't help it it's in the Bible amen he's here he's here it's spiritually he's here amongst us amen and then there's another word apocalypse which is unveiling and unveiling amen and the third one is Epiphany which is the brightness or the manifestation or the dawning realization of his uh that he's here friends he's not just here but it's revealed that he's here the veil has been torn amen amen a message open our eyes to realize he's here but I'm so glad it's not just revealed that he's here but it's manifested amongst us we're walking in the light of a living God Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he's here and he's vindicating it with his own life he's keeping his promises he's doing the supernatural he's comforting the broken heart he is here the light friends and it's the light it's the Epiphany it's the manifestation of his coming that destroys the Antichrist that's what the Bible said amen the brightness of his coming the epiphany of his coming the manifestation of his presence destroys Antichrist because what is Antichrist brother Brown said it's church members hanging to their Church instead of walking in the light now you got it right on the sign spirit and Truth Tabernacle amen friends but but you can't hang to your church amen you're not going to slip by Brother jack won't let you slip by hanging on to the church you got to walk in the spirit and the truth and if you're walking in that light you'll find it he's there he'll be there for you he's there for you glory to God oh what an epiphany what a brightness what a shalom to be in his presence brother bam said if we could only realize that he's appearing to us in these meanings for one purpose for one purpose he appears that is to release our desires that we have in him to us he releases our desires to us that's why he's here it's why he has come but we've got to recognize his presence and how you recognize his presence is when the promised word for this age is made manifest that's light when a promised word is made manifest amen I'm not interested in theories not interested in a new Creed I'm interested in a manifested word brother man said we can't live by Creeds we cannot live by denominationalism we must live by the word because the bride's part of a bridegroom he said what is that word bride the manifestation of this hour you talk about bright age the word bride is the manifestation of this hour the bride not a Creed not a denomination I thought brother Nathan I thought the the message was a movement to you know get us all out of denominations and get us back to Bible believing and Independence and oh friends no the manifestation of this hour is it's not a bunch of Miracles and hunting stories that happened 60 years ago the manifestation of this hour by a Prophet by an oracle of God is the word bride of Jesus Christ you say brother Nathan what's God doing today where is he working today amen where where is he manifesting his word today in The Bride of Jesus Christ in the mystical Body of Christ amen Jesus Christ is here he's in flesh the world will never see it but blessed are your eyes you heard but now we see I wish you could see what I see from where I'm standing amen I see the manifestation of the hour the word Visage of our time the word bride having Oracle of God a living attribute of God the attributes of God in the formation of the Bride amen oh we need more word we need more revelation we need more teaching we all need to get together and and agree on our Doctrine and sort these things out here's the secret you say oh we you know we got to understand more of these Mysteries here's the secret direct quote the word is in the bride that's the secret you tell me a deeper mystery than Christ in you the hope of glory you tell me something greater to strive for you say well you know serpent seed godhead all those things speak of you they all point to this great Revelation this great mystery among the Gentiles Christ is the mystery of God revealed in you amen all that was in God he poured into Christ amen but the story's not finished but the ultimate the Pinnacle God's objective is for all that was in Christ to be poured into this church amen hallelujah yeah that's what it's all about friends you start preaching these things you know we got people around this message they got that coin phrase bride Pride right oh you preach on the bride all the time bride Pride bride Pride I like oh brother Tim Pruitt said one time I Think Jesus got some bride Pride he said you know he said he rejected every denominational system rejected every Power structure of man he rejected every Power on this Earth and bypassed it all he didn't come to the popes he didn't come to the denominations he came down to the lowest level amen because he was interested in a humble little bride amen he rejected all the great you you realize where you stand with god brother bran said there's a church that calls herself the Queen of Heaven but the Queen of Heaven the queen of God's affection the queen of his heart is the elected bride of Jesus Christ no wonder we live below our privileges we don't realize Who We Are if we did Friends there'd be no fear it would be no worry realize where we stand with God we are his Queen We are his bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh I tell you I just can't preach it good enough amen could not express the greatness of this thing the word bride the manifestation of this hour brother Bram you know talked about Emmaus how they walked with him you know amen but but but he said even the preaching the word they didn't get it why because their eyes were on the wrong things they and they were telling them all about it and he must have been chuckling into himself you know God must get a kick sometimes out of us you know because they're walking with him and you know he just kind of he comes down another path and joins them you know at an appointed time and walks in a little bit what long face why why you look so down today it's you know a beautiful day don't you know what's happened don't you know where we're at don't you realize they rejected the message of our day they kicked it out now it's down to just a little handful of persecuted people They Crucified the word just the other day this just happened they crucified him and the and the skies blotted out with darkness and earthquake shook the Earth and and the veil of the temple even ripped open it's a terrible time hey when he and then he would begin to just he you know he's never in a hurry is he man he said well didn't Isaiah say about this what happened didn't remember that one Psalm that David sang dude what about what Moses what he said and he began to preach in the scripture and oh but they wouldn't have it they wouldn't have it they just couldn't look on the bright side because it was so dark oh it's terrible what's happening you know I you know I've been listen I've been watching the news all day and I just I'm so outraged I'm so scared I'm so worked up ain't even gonna say don't you realize you know don't look at what's happened in Ukraine you realize the nukes could fall at any moment all right now Jesus said well you know what didn't he say you know not one Bob would drop before the bride was out of here didn't he say when judgment fall the bride would be in the palace isn't that what he said oh no they just couldn't look on the bright side oh it's so terrible not realizing they're talking to him he's right there not realizing they were living in the greatest time that it ever struck the Earth friends where are we at today what are we looking at today I know it's a little simple little thought but we got to look on the bright side there's so much glory in this message there's so much Beauty in it there's so much peace there's so much rest I know the world's dark I know it's falling apart I know it's rough I know we got things going on right in our own ranks of the message so much negativity oh but if we could just walk with him a little while let him break the word of life we might now not everything might come open all at once you know we might not just see it am I you know it might take a little time under the hat but you know you recognize it because something in your heart gets burning oh yeah I remember that this is a familiar feeling amen something my heart's burning as he's talking I don't I don't quite see it all but I know something good is happening right now I know I'm just on the verge of a realization I'm just on the verge of an epiphany oh my if he could just break it open I could see get my peace back I could love this message again I could love his atmosphere again I could worship him again like I used to with an open heart oh if I could just if I could just get in his presence oh friends when this word was revealed to me it set my heart on fire this message is a fire shut up in my bones amen you know the thing about that is sometimes we try to hold it back sometimes the weight of this world tries to hold it back but you can't it'll burn you up hey man it's a fire shut up in your bones it's a force it's a push it's a life Hallelujah brother Graham says the pillar of Fire anyone knows the pillar fire comma light that took Israel through the Wilderness it was the angel the Covenant it was Jesus Christ and but he said you understand that was God above us then he became flesh and dwelt Among Us and now he's in his church he is in his church the pillar of fire comma light what is this evening light France it is the personal presence of Jesus Christ it is his atmosphere it is his life it is his strength it is his character it is his nature it is all together Jesus Christ that's what this message is amen it's light amen you look a light in the Bible what is light in the Bible none of the prophets ever talked about the light ever saw an electric light they never saw it light to Paul light to Isaiah light to Moses meant a fire a fire not some artificial modern thing oh no it's a fire amen you walk in the light you'll find out it's a fire amen there's a lot of people preaching this evening light but it don't burn that's a problem with it it doesn't burn it's a if it's doesn't burn it's not the original light amen it's some Modern artificial light it never came off of those candlesticks amen it's some man-made thing amen it's some system of belief but if you could ever get to the heart of this message you'll find a light that'll be a fire it'll consume you it'll take over it'll warm you it'll be passion it'll be power it'll be fire not some strange fire Amen brother bam said you know about that Strange Fire Aaron's sons went in there they had their idea about it they had their opinion well we'll start a message church but we'll have our own little spin we'll have our own little opinion well we can't we gotta we gotta respect our background we gotta respect where we came from you got to be washed amen you got to be clean you got to be have your lamp trimmed and clear to receive this light cause brother man said this fire is the fire that God started that's what I want burning in me not some man-made idea not some intellectual Enlightenment but the fire that got started when he poured it out on the day of Pentecost Hallelujah you try all you want to make improvements to this message modernize this message make it more comfortable make it more suitable for the age that we're living in but all you'll ever produce is an artificial light brother man said you know they're looking for some great shiny something some great shine always looking for something shiny and new but he said the Holy Spirit doesn't shine it glows shine is of the world glow is of God glow Over Me Lord is my prayer humble me down take me mold me and make me Spirit of the Living God move fresh on me just take me brother Brandon begins to as he begins to speak these words he says mold me make me make me thine own Lord just take me he begins to enter into that seeking that not some shiny thing but trying to get to the glow trying to get to that fire amen and then you know he's building that atmosphere that's what we need is the atmosphere of God the atmosphere of God like we feel in the building today by his grace that atmosphere will come amongst them friends do you feel I'm not asking for an empty hand now you you witnessed that the atmosphere of God is in a building today how many feel his presence I feel his presence today oh friends sweeping amongst us when it came and brother Bram spoke these words he said I'm just as aware that the spirit of Christ is moving through this building here this morning the god that will judge the world is right here now just as certain he said as I'm standing in this pulpit are you aware today are you aware are you walking in the light of this message or is it just your church friends but have you come to Christ oh where there's such an atmosphere in this atmosphere all things are possible Hallelujah you know we might not have the neon lights we might not have a mega church we might have to meet in a school for a little while amen but yeah we don't have the flashy things but oh we've got the pillar of Fire we've got it friends and that makes all the difference it doesn't matter what balaam's got we've got his presence we've got the angel of the Lord he's here to keep his Covenant hallelujah praise God that's what this light is that light that fell at Pentecost was a burning light it was the Holy Ghost and Fire Amen brother bran said the pillar of fire itself came and busted itself up and tabernacled in each one Hallelujah tongues of fire how did you know they had the Holy Ghost the fire come on Friends the word is a lamp but to my feet it's a light to my path how will we ever navigate the laodicea without the Holy Ghost without the light of the manifested word Friends the one who lead us in all truth rise and shine thy light I know you're with me I just I know I I believe you understand what I'm saying rise and shine your light has come the glory of the Lord is risen not somewhere else it's risen upon thee amen people are drawn to the the the Gentiles are drawn to the brightness of his coming and it's a bride coming brother bran said a real Christian that's why I think about brother Jack when I think about this quote a riff when you're a real Christian people love to have you say something to them they hang on your every word you carry an atmosphere they just just to be noticed just to speak a word means everything to them what is it it's not a man but it's the pillar of fire amen just you know they might not they might not see the light but they feel that glow they feel that warmth why because you're caring about that fire and the fire thing about fire is it makes an atmosphere and in that atmosphere friends amen oh that's where you want to walk that's Heavenly places that's his presence that's the word that's light that's that's epiphany hey man may I have a few more moments Amen brother Graham talk about it Pentecost he said he said you know the the people there they said Something's Happened to Me Something's Happened to Me amen oh that's what we need today a witness that something's happening something's happening we're not sitting around in an intellectual form something's happening we've had too much intellectual faith in the message too much formalism too much systematic thinking too much systematic thinking give me a little Grace on this thought I know who I am and who I'm speaking to but we look at the world today you know and we look at our look at our country where that it's come amen you know uh where where we've come to a place in our country when you look at the law when you look at the Constitution look at these things of course been revised many many times but it's come to a place where under this constitution there's nothing inequal between one man and another there's nothing that should favor one man at the expense of another but we all should be equal brethren but you know as well as I do amen that uh you know that might be the theory but it's not the reality many people are living why because of the system it's not it's not the letter of it that's the problem it's the system it's what's in the hearts of the people it's systematic friends and when it comes to religion when it comes to church if you want to join a church this is a great Church to join you want to sit under a pastor that this is a great Pastor to sit under but it's the system don't just join the system the system puts you in bondage it's the system that has Injustice the system is why somebody can sit and hear this message preached Sunday after Sunday and be as miserable as they can be why because they never got to Christ they never got to the atmosphere they joined a new system God help us Amen to preach it until the people cannot miss it [Music] because to be under the system of religion is the worst fate that I could imagine for a human being it's the system isn't it it's the system amen amen but don't look at the system friends that that's where people go wrong they look at all this systematic religion about us look at all the Hypocrites in the church look at people walking away look at the first false Doctrine look at the church splits look at the hurts look at all the water that's gone under the bridge friends why don't you look to Jesus one time look to Jesus get in the light and walk in it he's there I promise you he's there the personal presence of Jesus Christ accompanying the angel of the Lord accompanies this message amen but you gotta come out of your system to get to this message amen amen the Bible says when Moses made a place for the Lord he didn't build it in the camp he went outside the camp he actually had to go quite a ways away to build that Tabernacle of the congregation oh and there were a whole bunch of message believers in that time every time Moses would go out to talk to the Lord everybody got in the door of the tent everybody came to church oh Supernatural oh the miraculous oh the music oh the preaching oh this is glorious two of them went into the promised land two of them why they might have been in the camp but not all Israel's in the camp young man young woman if you want to get to Jesus you're gonna have to go beyond the church go beyond the camp go beyond the group he's not in the group he's outside but Moses made a place the prophet made a place where somebody could go and get in the atmosphere of the presence of God Moses made a place Hallelujah you read there in Exodus 33 about the sit the way that Tabernacle was situated that's why this man that's why we got trouble amongst our young people today because we hear a message you know brother bran preaches against denominations preach calling the people out of denominations but you're already in a message Church where are you gonna go well I'll tell you you're gonna have to come out if your parents had to come out of Pentecost if your parents had to come out of Methodist if your parents had to come out of Baptist you're going to have to come out of your message Church I don't mean leave Spirit truth to Spirit and Truth Tabernacle I don't mean run away from Brother Duff I mean get past the system of religion and get to Jesus Christ it'll fix every problem in the church if we would get rid of our denominational traditions and believe this thing all the way get all the way into Christ all the way into this word formal's normal I don't want normal Christianity I don't want formalism I want Jesus Christ [Applause] come out of her my people yes don't be partakers of the system don't sell this glorious thing out to join a church Dear God open someone's eyes hey man what we need brother bam said it's like it was on the day of Pentecost we need some witnesses that something happened to me something happened to me something you know I was in the group we were all in the group we were in an upper room we was having church we had singing We had shouting we had preaching we paid our tithes amen we read the scripture we did all those things amen but we waited we waited we didn't settle for that Amen brother Brown said after a while one of them got up said well you know maybe if we just take it by faith no they waited they waited until the glory fell waited for the fire waited for the light they didn't settle for some intellectual understanding neither will I what we need brother bran said is a sane sensible group of people that can walk up and face God say Lord don't make me a church member make me a witness please make me a witness Amen brother bran preached about that little Maiden Amen in Syria amen and she had a master named Naaman and can you imagine that guy that guy invaded Israel and kidnapped this girl and took her home to exploit her exploit her labor and make her a servant in his house amen she didn't owe that guy anything but she was such a witness she was such a witness amen until when he was stricken with Leprosy where that little girl she went to she went to uh went to and said you know I wish you could get to my country because in my country we got a prophet and I know if you could get to the prophet amen that you could be clean I just know if you could just get there well what did he do that great intellectual man he said well you know I'm a deacon in the church you know I'm not I can't just I'm not going to go up to the altar everyone will think I'm backslid he said ah no no no no no I'll go to the king I'll go to the king so it went down to pastor formalism's church you know it goes to the king just like you know all just intellectual thinking well I you know I that guy's smarter than all the rest of them I'll go over to him get his take on it goes to the king says you know I got this leprosy I'm here so I can be healed because I heard that your God heals leprosy what'd the king do he said whoa now oh hold on now what are you trying to pull yeah we preaching yeah you I know our you know we preach about the brass serpent all those kind of things we preach that here we preach the message now you're standing my altar you want to be healed of leprosy are you trying to embarrass me you trying to embarrass me we we're a word church you know we we don't all that kind of we're not sign Seekers all right you must be you're looking for some Pentecostals we got the word days of Miracles has passed Hee-Haw you know isn't that just the way but he never should have went to that King in the first place he never should have took the intellectual approach but he should have believed a little girl's testimony he should have just took her at his word that there's a place where he could go where he could be clean amen friends there's a lot of people that'll pay lip service to a supernatural God they'll pay lip service to a message they're not they're you know Judas didn't mind preaching I and my father owondo he'd probably he'd preached the third pool till he was blue in the face but he couldn't go to Pentecost because he could not live in that atmosphere that's why brother Braham said and I don't have time to go into it but if you go into Third Exodus and search for uh actions speak louder than words brother Brown said that's a lot of churches today oh they'll say they believe it yeah we believe in the Supernatural oh we believe in miracles we believe in all oh sure God's A Healer but actions speak louder than words yeah we believe in the spirit of God moving in the people and then the first time it breaks out in the church we don't want no Wildfire around here but what about the pillar of fire amen actions speak louder than words it's a beautiful quote it's beautiful quote why because he said they're more they think they're more able with their intellectual Minds to set a church in order than the Holy Ghost so they don't need it any longer but when you do you take it right out from your framework the lifeline the lifeline amen we need that anointing friends and brother bran said there is a people that's elected they have their names on the Lamb's Book of Life they can't go for it they can't stand it he said now maybe a church won't speak it right out they won't speak now we see the spirit all around the message I thank God for your church your pastor amen that that will speak it and live it amen amen but that but there are so many won't they'll they won't right out come out and preach against the moving of the spirit they won't come right out and and and and say that God doesn't heal anymore but brother Brown said their actions prove it oh France Deliver Us from intellectual Faith amen but oh over on the bright side amen there's a there's a there's an elected people that's got their name on the last book of life and they can't go for it amen they can't stand that France amen and the Holy Spirit proves that amongst those kind when he gets them gathered together he proves that he still heals the sick he proves he still raises the debt he still speaks with tongues he still casts out devil it depends what's on inside of a person amen but when Christ is on the inside of a person there will be an atmosphere where all things are possible [Applause] Hallelujah Blue Devil brother bran said that little girl you know he said the beautiful thing about it is probably in her life she'd never seen in leprosy healed maybe there wasn't one case in her time of leprosy ever anyone ever being delivered from leprosy she'd never seen it happen amen it was ridiculous to the thinking of the time she didn't know anything about that all she knew was that in her country there was an atmosphere where all things were possible there was a prophet there was a person if you could ever get in that presence Anything Could Happen that's how I feel today I would to God that you could live in my country would to God everyone could get into this atmosphere that we're feeling in our midst today I just went to God they would do it amen don't bulk at it don't be afraid of it it's the presence of God and in that presence Anything Could Happen I would to God you live in my country friends I know our country the United States of America I know it's a mess but we don't belong to it anyhow amen we are our nationality is in the prophetic amen we are of a we are a royal priesthood amen we are a call out people hallelujah I wish you come to my country in my country we don't go for that intellectual religion in our country my country we don't settle for a form in my country there's a living God with a living atmosphere all things are possible in my country privilege you know what a privilege to live in this atmosphere I tell you Church don't ever take for granted what you have in your church this atmosphere this worship this ministry you thank God for it brother Bram said there are many people today that don't know they don't know that Jesus is Alive they don't know he still rules and Reigns they don't know that the blood of Calvary is all sufficient they don't know that that's real today can you imagine they don't know but blessed are your eyes for they see he said what we need is some more Little Maids to go around and testify of these things to get into the atmosphere of it to get into the atmosphere of it and I'll just bring it down on this quote brother ramp said did not our hearts burn within us does not it burn now to know that we are now in the presence of the resurrected Jesus Christ to whom be glory and praise forevermore who is in the express image of the almighty Jehovah who sailed down in the form of a pillar of Fire here he is even identified himself before science and by his very actions and his very prophecy the things that are prophesied of him to do in this day the things that make him the same yesterday and today and forever they have been perfectly Vindicated perfectly Vindicated do you believe he's here then brother bran said isn't it enough to make our hearts burn within us isn't it enough and when that struck me in my study I thought my God how many things and I whoever this is for will you receive it today how many things in my background in my past in my life in my church in my family how many things would I would have had it different how many regrets how many times have we seen it all go wrong how many times have people not lived up to the potential how many how much Darkness is there to look at how much darkness is on the hearts of the people but friends isn't it enough to be here in his presence and realize you're one in a million you say oh brother Nathan but the church is just down to one two three people but it's one in a million oh it just fills my heart isn't it enough isn't it enough to have our hearts burning on the inside knowing that we're walking in his presence there's things I would change there's things you would change not everybody's going to get it all right but if I've got Jesus this personal revealed this this this manifested Jesus it's enough amen look how we stand today amen brother Brandon was at a place in his life you know maybe we bow our heads for a moment just meditate on this that was a brother man was a man you know our Prophet went through hurts felt rejections went without things you know like when he would go to go fellowship with his comrades in the ministry you know and look at their great fine buildings and and campuses and things and here he had just a little little side room somewhere you know and he felt the pain of that he felt the pain of going without this Elijah was a man of like passions but oh my you know the word that God gave him applies to you and me he said I'll be your portion you might not have all the wealth of this world you might not have everything go the way that you would like it might not be Prosperity every step you take the way the world measures it but I I will be reportioned maybe you'd like to lift a hand today and something has spoke to you today to lift it to the Lord say God I I need you I need your presence I need you to be my portion I need to find my peace in you I need to walk with you today Lord I've been getting away from you a little bit I've been out of Fellowship God bring me back into that light Dear God let me live in that atmosphere where all things are possible take me home Lord take me home to my country Hallelujah God bless you Saints we'll just turn it right over to brother Jack Amen the presence of the Lord is here if you want prayer just come for prayer or there in your seed but fellowship with him he doesn't bring this presence everywhere but we're such a privileged people amen isn't your heart burden within you today amen God bless you today thank you [Music] praise the Lord man this presence is real and I know that brother Nathan found the mind of the Lord just to remind us of just where we are and what it's all about church [Music] we want to draw closer to him I want him to be real to us we want to be real to him

she thought she have to have surgery but as she was sweeping listening to the song the presence of the Lord swept over her amen that she was sweeping glory to God and she let out a sneeze and then she let out another sneeze and and when she let us see something come out and she's like wait a minute that serger that they told me I was gonna have to have I don't need it no more if she went back to
