respecter of persons with God amen you know we never want to get lifted up in ourselves I was just talking to brother Troy just a few moments ago and you know many of us were raised in this message many of us don't have the scars and the things of the world but you know friends even though you live in a good life now if you don't have the Holy Ghost you've got to get it because like I said there's no respecter of persons in God you have to receive it for yourself sin is sin hell is hell amen heaven is heaven god it's still God amen so don't just think just living a good life and doing pretty good is good enough without him without him I was here just a couple of years ago and brother Jack sing a song and he sing it for me and it's a song that take us back to our heritage brother Troy he says I'm going all the way I'm going all the way I'm not going halfway with Jesus I'm not just gonna take maybe a half a step for him because I don't want to end up in hell I don't want just fire insurance I want the baptism I wanted to comment and thirdly change me from head to toe away then I won't know that Jesus Christ has for me he saw me in my sin he saw me where I was just a backslidden message boy and at 20 years old he said I'll take that one he set the hook and friends I never look back I don't want as for me anymore Jesus said I offer you mine and I know delay oh it's gonna be wonderful when we get there it's going to be good when you get there but friends why because you're going to have more of the word than you have ever had before oh my don't ever underestimate that we certainly love each and every one of you with the love of the Lord and we're just thankful that brother jacket given me the opportunity to be here with you and we're just a counter to privileged to be here and we pray for you pray for us you know we're not that far away so come and visit us anytime we certainly appreciate that amen we'll glory to God let's just bow our heads this morning for a word of Prayer Heavenly Father Lord we love you so much Lord we're thankful that you truly are the same yesterday and today and forever you said I am God and I change not Lord and it's in this hour that you have chosen out a little bride Lord and we know that it's a revelation to us all the rest of the world just like the little girl out west who had a revelation that who her husband was gonna be and I believe I spoke on it last time I was here but Lord it means so much to us because Oh God we are that little lady the rest of the world can look at us and laugh at us and say all we dress a certain way we do sit we go to church on Sunday we go to church on Friday we go to church on Saturday a prophet taught us Oh God whenever the doors are open if we've got the Holy Ghost in our heart will in there Oh God and that's truly the case this morning Lord we want to come to church why because that life is you offered us that more abundant life dear God is here in a puppet on us when we come to you under expectation that our God meets that expectation Oh God Lord and we just are under expectation I am myself although I'm standing up here Lourdes I'm no different than anybody else but Lord I'm under expectation to see what Jesus Christ it's gonna do today dear God Lord there's certain things I have in my heart that I have need of and I just pray to your God Lord that is your Holy Spirit's here while you're brooding over your people dear God just go to each and every one dear God and mean each and every single need and desire that your children would have on their hearts this morning dear God Lord we love you we just commit the service to you now and Jess Heavenly Father that you would just be in our midst Heavenly Father Lord we just give you the preeminence we worship and serve you now in Jesus name we pray amen whoo I gotta tell you I was blessed by your song service this morning I'm not gonna sing anymore you a man I just kind of back to thinking you know do you guys have like that a CD or a tape or something like that at my if it did that for me what did it do to the one that you were singing to Amen if it did that for me just a mortal man the very one that spread forth his hands and took this took the nails took your set of mine but now he's you're worshiping him and serving him and giving him glory and praise like he did this morning I kind of thought to myself Prince let's just take a rapture let's just go let's get out of here I'm ready oh I am ready certainly appreciate brother Troy who hosting us this morning and brother Solomon the song service and the musicians I've been in churches they don't have the blessings that you have they don't have the the talent and the gifts that you know sometimes we just take things like that for granted but we just thank God for the the talent and the Worshipful spirit that they bring to you many times the psalmist David you know he wouldn't need he would need encouragement from God or even Saul and any other prophets when they need encouragement from God there's healing and music is that right so they would just bring in some Holy Ghost filled godly music like we have this morning and the Spirit of God would begin to brood amongst them so we're certainly thankful for that amen let's just turn in our Bibles this morning to Luke chapter 1 Luke chapter 1 verse 26 through 38 and then you can have your seats this morning Luke chapter 1 our subject matter this morning by the grace of God will be be it unto me according to thy word be it unto me according to thy word Jesus was praying in the Garden of Gethsemane and he you know is a man it was a tough thing that he had to do and he asked the Father there praying as his sweat became blood he said father let this cup be pass from me because he knew what manner of death he knew what manner of suffering he knew what he had to do he says father let this cup pass from me but you'll notice the very next statement he says nevertheless not my will but thy will be done chapter 126 and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph of the house of David and the Virgin's name was Mary and the angel came unto her and said hail thou art highly favoured the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be and they angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou hast found favor with God friends you have found favor with God in this hour and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth his son and shall call his name Jesus and he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no and that best stretches all the way up to 2018 then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing I know not a man and the angel said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God and behold that cousin Elizabeth she has also conceived a son in her old age and this is the six-month of this is the sixth month with her who was called barren she was called barren she wasn't barren she would just call barren for with God nothing shall be impossible glory to God and Mary said Behold the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed from her may our Lord at his blessing you can have your seats this morning amen and I love her attitude there she said be it unto me according to thy word let's just turn for another passage of Scripture to 2nd Peter chapter 1 everybody loved the Word of God this morning 2nd Peter chapter 1 we're gonna read 3 through 12 according in as according as his divine power has given unto us things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him but he have called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises but by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that are in the world through lust and beside these things giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither neither be barren nor unfruitful and the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and have forgotten that he was purged from his soul sense wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though you know them and be established in the present truth the present truth you see friends all down through the ages God had a truth he had something that he wanted to give each and every age is that right but friends now we have a present truth this is the Omega church the Alpha Church had it for Christ was right there in that church that all through the church ages a little bit was lost here the Palmer of Decatur were all these things took the truth away from the church to the church actually became completely apostate not even knowing anything about their God even denied the very name that's going to be baptized in and to take the name of the Lord Jesus right and replacing it with titles of the name Father Son Holy Ghost sisters when you take that y'all understand there's gonna be a wedding here before long when you take that man to be your lawfully wedded husband you take his name you take all that he is all that he has he freely gives it to you he's opening up his bank account to you he's opening up his home to you his car everything he has he's opening up to you or the God of glory is opening up everything that he has for you he's opening his sickness healing to me from from your God he says I will give it to you he never denies you anything why because you're his little bride oh if you've ever been loved in your life it's why you're Jesus but this present truth it's the restoration of everything that was lost all down through the years but now in this hour has been restored back to produce a bride for the Lord Jesus Christ and she will be a word bride not the word plus oh there's no additives to it there's nothing else to it it's Christ the word in the word only in her amen I'll read this one to you the law and the prophets were until John but since that time the kingdom of God is preached and every man presses into it group be easier for heaven and earth to pass one tittle of the law to fail heaven and earth will pass away but his word can not fail did we love the Lord Jesus this morning now in our opening Scripture we read about a little girl named Mary and you know I believe with all in my heart that she was just an ordinary woman just an ordinary young girl you know brother Duane who said she would maybe between 16 and 18 years old maybe she didn't stand out to the rest of the world maybe she just seemed ordinary just a good girl for we know that she was highly favored of Almighty God so she was a good girl we understand that but as far as fleshly attributes we don't know that there was something extraordinary that she did but she was highly favored of Almighty God a teenager between 16 and 18 years old a teenager chosen by God to bear his son glory to God you say brother Joel contain agers grasp this message I say yes to teenagers have the Holy Ghost I say yes take teenagers and Laodicea live the Word of God I say yes you know why because it's not you doing it it's you dying that you let go and let me talk live his life through you oh so many say I try I tried to do it but I couldn't well that's exactly right that's a good start you try now you die you come down to the altar you die you give it to the Lord Jesus Christ and then let him live his life through you so many of them try and fail oh then they give up and say the message isn't true it just couldn't do what it was supposed to do the problem that is is they tried I tried to give up drugs I tried to give up the things of the world I just couldn't give it up because the lust of the things of the world was too great in your life we used to sing as long this is all to Jesus I surrender all to thee I freely give I will ever and trust you and your service daily live friends it don't say I asked her when your most you know why sometimes prayers aren't answered the psalmist David gives us the answer to that because you have iniquity in your heart you have an open wide every door of your life that Jesus Christ coming to every aspect of your life you never let him in your computers and your smartphones you haven't let him in your thoughts you say oh I want the blessings of God but I just cannot give up certain things Bible says what would a man give in exchange for his soul what out there has the power to give you true happiness I just come back from Louisiana youth can't bless Sunday brother Andrew Glover powerful man of God really appreciate him and his minister in my own pastor brother Danny steamed and had the services there and you know the climax to me was that Saturday night prayer line you know why because everybody came under expectation and I wondered if they we'd even be here this weekend I thought maybe the rapture would take place right then because the power of God in the noisy of God was so strong in that building that I just didn't know what God was going to do but we do know that he has a bride is going to take the rapture he said he shall not all sleep but she shall be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye friends I gotta do something to hard to know that your God creator of heaven and earth would do that for you but there stood in the bread of life and you know you've seen the picture this picture right here of the pillar of fire the only supernatural picture ever taken and I'm saying they're laying hands on God's children and asking for his mercy and delivering power to come into their life and I thought you know Lord Jesus the same pillar of fire the same Holy Ghost this same Jesus Christ is right here is related Hanson for 500 young people's they came through that line and you know there was a young man sitting there it was friends and some other Minister brothers have been discouraging him they just leave the message it's not true just leaving just come and just live a good denominational Christian life they taught him not to come to this year's camp and Dry Creek Louisiana but friends under the power of God God began to deal with him and he was sitting there to see during that panel I don't even know who it was I just heard the testimony he said that he saw that same pillar of fire brooding over that then then that pulpit that altar where everybody was praying and receiving from Almighty God he said that pillar of fire was there meeting the people's needs I didn't see it but I definitely felt the effect of what God was doing for his people that day he said that the pillar of fire was brooding over the people on that platform that day it didn't stop there it started to brew down and come down amongst the people and meet them according to their expectations Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever your God has not changed he has not lost power the only problem with it is it's unbelief the disciples prayed and asked for a child brother Branham said that it was it was a disease was that to throw him in the fire I'm over 40 he shook him to cast him into the fire anyhow you know which one it was you look at your neighbor and say pray for brother Joe he lost his mind but that's okay we found his this morning a man glory to God but the fire the devil cast him into epilepsy cast him into the fire the disciples prayed for him and they couldn't cast him out and they Jesus came on the scene oh my that devil of epilepsy had no power there Jesus cast him out the disciples came to see Jesus why couldn't we do it he says it's because of your unbelief oh my no I thought he was posed to be a nice Jesus loves everybody Jesus and wanna step on toes and things like this sometimes the Word of God steps on toes but what is it doing its correcting you and getting you land line with God's birds sometimes he just has to tell you that you're wrong but in that correction the Bible says he loves who he chastens all the chastening I grew up man I know what it's like to be chasing I know what it's like to take a couple trips around the block with a stick behind my back I know what that's like but you see friends that put some value in you if cause you should not want to do what you just did again marry a teenager in her day a teenager oh man teenagers and blue to see you just got a bad rap no they don't I've had too many people tell me that oh they're kids the kids are not even in control anymore we just don't know what to do I do get him - Jesus Christ you get him under the anointing you get him in church and have a worship service like we just had a couple moments ago when that fun you want to talk about fun that was fun I enjoyed myself hearing you sing I'd like I said before I can't sing but I enjoy good Holy Ghost music amen I was blessed by myself but contain Agers be filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost can teenagers take a rapture yes they can yes they can why because you Mary was predestinated before the foundation of the world to carry the gospel for her day it has listened to a sermon here I go again invisible Union and our prophet was preaching and he said that we have been given the merit the wedding band of predestinated unmerited grace God gave you the wedding band of predestinated unmerited grace in other words you didn't do anything to get it God just says your mind I'll give it to you brother Branham said he slipped the wedding band on your finger glory Holly before the foundation of the world you may say I come into this world sinful I did not raise up in this message I come with all kinds of baggage but the wedding band are predestinated unmerited grace was already on your finger it was already there the problem of in us you just didn't know it but one day God by revelation revealed to you who you really are told you might have thought you knew who you were you might have thought you knew what you're aspiring to be what your ambitions were gonna be because they don't know you're mine and you're having call like Mary was to bear the Word of God for your day predestinated unmerited grace could Mary have doubted what the angel said oh absolutely she could have doubted it but did she we have no weather that says Mary says man what will my friends think man I'm not even married yet now I'm gonna be with child and this is a robert joseph thing Oh what am I supposed to do now oh let me think about this gate room maybe I just did hearin ponder for a little bit no she sent me in unto me according to thy word she just believed what he said for her now he says this now there is a womb of the physical there is a womb of the spirit do you believe that thank you brother there's a woman the spirit do you believe that there is a spiritual womb and a physical and the mind is the womb of the Spirit spoken word as the original see you might say well it was easy for Mary to believe and the angel came to her home I an angel came to Mary an angel Gabriel came for the presence of God who wouldn't believe in angel but friends listen to me now it took just as much faith for her to believe that angel is it takes for you to believe the message of the hour it takes just as much faith for you to believe who you are isn't it for her to believe the angel you say but all an angel didn't speak to me and into absolutely this speaks you you have 1,100 tape the Bible says unto the Angel of the Church of Laodicea write these things and that he that happened here let him hear what the Spirit says unto the churches what the Spirit says was it a man this is more than a man talking to my kids and devotions last night brother Perry Greene gave his testimony in our church please gone unto glory now but he said that he was in when a brother branham's meetings this is okay this morning he said he was in brother Brandon's meetings one time when his gives a young boy brother brems said y'all just bow your head and be referenced this morning praying for a little girl that didn't was born without eyes in her eye sockets friends that's not psychology that's not telepathy that's not even a devil the devil can't even do that he can pervert it but he can't do that so but about the head but better Perry just a young boy he's always had like that over his face like that he said but I still kind of left a little hey so I can see what was going on brother Brandon began to pray for that child and he pronounced her well brother Branham still had his hands on her head a little head at that point in time brother Perry peeking through his fingers like this inside of eyelids circles begin to circle round and round God right before them was creating eyeballs in the sockets of a little child brother Branham looks down he says I'm so sorry little sister I forgot to ask you what color you wanted glory to God he says I forgot to ask you what color oh when she opened up those sockets that were less empty she now had eyes to see to many people that have walked away from this message oh they read the things and oh how could this be how could that mean but friends the people that were there have testimonies of what your God did through through Scripture you say brother Joel was that absolutely script it was it was absolutely Scripture God said I will send you Elijah I will all friends John chapter revelations chapter 10 the type of the bride is that right he was given a book but it was an open book it was not any sealed up and sealed up in Revelation chapter 5 but it was opened up and when it was given to the bride it was an open book for friends we are recipient to the open book that's why eyes can be created in socket that's why lives of sin drugs and all these things complete completely abolished and take it out of somebody's life why because the book is the lie it is been given to you for deliverance is given to you so you have the power to take the rapture I like the testimony your brother Bill down close friend of our prophet 90 to 93 years old something like that he was sitting in the meeting power of God come down convicted as hog he went to church man he didn't hardly ever go to church a very wealthy man as his wife died I remember she was early 90s the state was worth about thirty six million dollars when brother and his wife passed away very very wealthy man so he didn't have much need for God but for the preaching of the word he recognized his need for the rate of said that light flashed across his life and he said I want to go down into the water I want to be baptized and take the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for my very own and you know friends he's the same yesterday and today and forever we have space in our own church how give me a little testimony now I told you what he did then I'll tell you what he did just a few months ago if that's all right young man in our churches in school I forget what he's going preaching hearing or something of the sort begin to talk to the little girl across the aisle from him she said what do you believe he's no I'm glad you asked let me tell you some testimonies he began to witness to her talk to her she can be a couple of times he comes up to me after one of the service he says brother Joel she wants to be baptized praise the Lord that's good he goes brother Joe must be baptized right now I said Walter the baptismal pool is not full yet I mean you know we have since behind you you've been there as what's not there so I went to the pastor he says yeah just I haven't set it up for Sunday and world baptized after the Sunday service she says that's not good enough I wait for you to fill and I said takes 45 minutes I don't care I want to take his name right now I don't want to go to sleep tonight and tell I've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for his promised percent to me and I would repent and be baptized in his name that I would receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and she said I want that Holy Ghost now I don't want to wait til Sunday I need it now so we just come across me we got a big old muddy pond in front of our church and that was full and I told brother Danny says well we'll have to take 45 take my 45 minutes to an hour to fill she's no way bear in mind this is a Wednesday night it wasn't Sunday nude it was 9:30 in the dark on a Wednesday night brother I told brother Danny's ear said we got the pond right here he's he said we get to man I'll do it I'll do it oh man I love seeing our dead one our devil but the devil get a black guy I love that man I'll go down there my church clothes kick my church shoes off walked out there in the head cold mud we baptized that sister in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the saints of God began to sing we went down into the water what they did is he turned all the cars around and shine the lights down in the water so we can see what we're doing they even told her there might be an alligator after we seen him before she said I don't care if we probably this smart you'll sustain me Booya and that's what God did just a few months ago and he's the same yesterday and today and forever parents if you've got children out there that haven't received the message they haven't received Jesus Christ like they should just hold on just keep holding on all your profession before Almighty God when the children of Israel left the land of bondage they didn't have to leave us behind when you leave and go in your rapture you don't have to leave the child behind you don't have to leave one loved one behind you claim those children in the name of Jesus Christ and if they're not applying the token do their life you're applying for them brother Branham since I have no apology for this remark that I'm fixing to make I believe that God can prove that the right mental attitude toward any divine promises of God will bring it to pass yes sir the right mental attitude but you've got to have the right that'll attitude that's what brings the results you say yes I believe that but I don't know that's not the right attitude the right attitude is to receive it and stay thus saith the Lord that is right thus saith the Lord what are you saying here take him at his word and don't doubt it and this is a quote that just means so much to me the mental attitude you take toward it will bring now the mind won't do it like you just said the right mental attitude toward the promise we've got to bring them to pass he says but now the mind won't do it but if you give that attitude attitude rather towards something that's got life in it then that life comes down and does it you see it's not you trying it's not you trying and failing and not getting knocked down and get back up I can't get my testimony here before raising this message spared a lot of things but music gripped in my life and I can't tell you how many times I quit listening to rock and roll in country music and all these things you start with rock and roll you end up and rap and then you say well country music's a little bit easier to listen to so I'll I'll listen to that and then where you go well that isn't right so I go to Christian country music I go to Christian rock friends there ain't no such thing because the 90 behind the thing is from the pinna now when we heard this morning it was good Holy Ghost film music and if you don't have some Holy Ghost field music like you heard this morning you talk to brother Solomon or brother Troy or somebody like that and they'll get you some good music to listen to something that honors and glorifies your God but you give that attitude towards something that's got life in it then the life comes down and does it not your mental attitude that only brings you in the presence of him your attitude only brings you in the presence of him that's what you do your mind the five senses is all right as long as they don't deny God but when they go denying God then you leave them alone the Bible says lay not onto your own understanding talking to brother Troy in the office this morning just one word according to your understanding things that the world look pretty good but because of one word the word not my son and I my traveling buddy here come here this morning and I forget how many wrecks and things we saw just on route 70 early on a Sunday morning where you know most people should have been just getting ready for church but ambulance is coming down the road car vets things are happening people in turmoil in pain because of one word one word but if you take the whole Word of God then there's a huge blessing if you take the whole Word of God not deluded by some man's I think you know one of the greatest men ever met I hope this is okay this morning well the greatest man ever met was my father-in-law brother John steam and some of you maybe remember him he passed away just a couple of years ago but I would go to him you know as a young and I wasn't ministering yet I was running from that but I would go to him many times and say well what about this what does the Bible say about this or what does this mean and you know one thing I admired about him sometimes he just said I don't know I've wondered myself and your prophet did that very thing sometimes in questions and answers but I never ever heard him say I think I think if you don't know just say you don't know there's no shame in that there's no shame in not knowing just place it before your God and if you have a question just place that there in your mind and then one day he will give you the revelation of that thing whatever it may be you just place it there and say God it might be a year you said I can't with you Abraham waited 25 for his promise and we can't wait a few minutes I like one time a minister said this is the age of the microwave when I grew up yeah they were out there they were real expensive yeah I'm dating myself I'm 42 years old I remember we got one man it was about as why does that pulpit had a little bitty door in it you put a little thing of popcorn in it we got it at a garage sale and that's okay but today we want everything instant I want it now you know they say that movies and television and things like that they change the picture every three seconds so you don't lose interest in it every three seconds our mind has to be entertained entertained entertained entertained sometimes I just saw it on brother Jack's wall a moment ago says be still and know that I am God just meditate on him for a little while and let him come down let his presence come down you know brother Branham said you want victories just get into your prayer closet just begin to pray and seek Him just wait till the house is all clear wherever you go to pray some of you may have a a nice little place where you can go for a walk and just commune with Almighty God tell him how much you love him put your petitions before him but then just get quiet brother Branham said just be quiet and let him speak to you but you know for instance times it takes a little while he may not answer you instantly but he said I will answer didn't Daniel pray one time it took 21 days to get his answer because the spirit of the Prince of Persia withstood the angel they had his answer of course Michael the Archangel Christ came down and assisted that angel and that answer was able to get to so just know your answers on the way but it don't always happen just the way that you wanted it to so many people have just walked away from this truth walked away since I can't believe it all those preachers just don't have a clue about the real world I mean he's old listen Matan he don't know where I've been and where let's go on let me say this we do have a clue about the real world many of us came from there we've definitely seen it but I'm here to tell you this morning about the real world and that's the Word of God we read it this morning heaven and earth are going to pass away but his word can not fail you say that that's not the real that is the real world that's the only thing that is real that's the only thing that can get you out of this world and into the next you see it's not based on your thoughts your emotion or even how you feel oh I feel so bad but the Word of God is still true you see friends often times we feel good and I remember in the Penn Harris meetings jumping and shouting and having a good old time but you know friends that did not have the power to keep us once we left from that building it's the power of God in your life you say brother drawer you can see motion absolutely not I believe that the power of God brings on emotion but it's not necessarily the jumping - screaming - shouting and the praising and things like that that brings down the power of God it's the preaching of the word the down the power of God just say he just prepared your heart you receive what he has for you I was in too many meetings when they said oh I can't breach now I've given so I'll talk then what did we come here for any out I could have stayed home and watched a video of singing I could have stayed home at this much I what the word you say well you're a preacher I was 12 years old when that came to me just a little boy that even converted you where the man stayed behind the Pope I feel sorry for you if you can't dance no well yeah we did but the power of God is what should bring that on did the preaching of the word we've seen so many miracles with so many things happen just while the people are in their position sitting under the sound of the gospel we had a brother in our church his ears were healed completely healed he was deaf her point in those eyes I'm sorry it was his eyes he was having a hard time sing a young man 56 years old very young I did the sound of the gospel God opened his eyes we had another man he's exact my age who eats younger than I am he's 42 years old sit there under the sound of the gospel when Jesus Christ his word was being preached this man has all kinds of back problems he comes in like a little old man he had a pretty heavy job he carries he sees a Salesman for Benjamin Moore paint up in our local church and he carries him five gallon buckets all day long probably weighs 70 pounds apiece I suppose I don't know he carries about two peoples trucks and now his 42 year old man with ten children he's walking around like this and you know he's our song leader and he came down off the steps like like this walk back to his seat and suffered for several months but you know one day the power of God came down strengthen that back but then bounce this backward God created feet no he doesn't crawl into church anymore he is he went to the physical therapist he ran three miles than that stayed the day before Maddy couldn't walk they said are you gonna stop before he could hardly move the next day he says Jesus Christ heal me want to see me jump up do it again I'm here and I'm never ever gone back where I was I'm never going back who Jesus Christ saved you from sin you're never going back to where you were Oh testimony so many people brother Brandon's meetings or healed but they didn't hold the testimony they begin to doubt well maybe I didn't get healed maybe it didn't happen maybe it was just a guess 100% of the time for 33 years oh come on devil I thought you were smarter than that and then when they began to doubt yeah the devil had an open door at that point and he could bring the cancer blindness whatever would be back on the person don't doubt all the time he said just believe don't doubt God honors his word and he anoints the minister to give you what you need you see friends I don't know brother Jack just sent me a text says could you be here Sunday morning and he said god bless you brother and their brother Troy you have any questions just contact my brother I said okay but the Jeff didn't tell me what you're dealing with he didn't tell me your struggles but Jesus knows Jesus the pillar of fire that was not relegated to January 1950 that was not relegated to try Creek Louisiana when we could go I believe with all of my heart that you brought him here with you today and he's the dissolver announced he's the dissolver of fear he's the disarmer of sickness he's the disarmer of sin so many times have talked with people and dealt with them in their problems they'll call me on Monday or Tuesday and we'll pray and we'll go over some scriptures and things like that and Wednesday night it might be a visiting ministry brother Jul 40 or somebody like that just come and really bring down the power of God but well something came up they needed to get peanut butter they just needed to go shopping or whatever it was just some little piddly I don't want in I don't want to make anybody sick next to me I'll tell you what don't don't but you know what many times that ministering brother that did not know what their problem was preaches his and tire sermon on the deliverance that they needed but for whatever Pedley little excuse oh well I thought it I thought I was about to come down with something I thought I was about to come down with something well what faith where's your faith where is your pain I feel like I'm about to get sick I feel like I'm about to be healed I feel like somebody's about to B's AIDS I feel like somebody it's about to be seen the baptism of the Holy Ghost let that be your profession the Bible says he's the high priest of your profession what you confessed he's the high priest of amen you haven't any business out on the field unless you are filled with the Holy Ghost and preaching the true gospel and demonstration of the power of Holy Ghost he says if you're not seeing the results that Jesus said you would see it's because you're not preaching the true gospel you see false doctrine pines and we see it all around the message oh you must belong to this group and we just believe so and so and this and that and we don't let the fivefold ministry into our church all right we're just gonna sit home and listen to tapes hello hello we're just gonna sit home and listen to it but if you listen to those tapes What did he say What did he say it doesn't coincide with anything that these people are doing questions and answers on the seals they asked him well the bride have a ministry before the rapture he says that's what's going on now that's what's going on now he said God choose a man to preach the gospel he could have chose the moon he could have choose the Stars he could have chose anything but he chose a man to bring you the good news he chose a man to preach Jesus Christ to you oh and I like this part he says it wasn't a mechanical device or something like that God chose a man so young man whoever you may be if God is calling you if God is dealing with you go go your confession should be Here I am send me Oh leave us Hudson Taylor one time great missionary to China young Chinese boy got the baptism of the Holy Ghost the power of God and the joy was deep down inside him he says mr. Taylor what must I do should I go get an education so I can take this joy to the rest of the world that's the Taylor told him he could you blow out the candles lid don't go out while the candles haplit he said little boys I don't know what to tell him what do I say Hudson Taylor says you just go tell them how the candle got Linda that's right you go tell them how the candle got there you go tell they move out spirit and light tabernacle either tell them about the power of God that comes down in these meetings you go tell him about the deliverance that Jesus Christ administers to his people in this day and that he truly is yesterday the same yesterday today and forever what time I started brother Troy will try to wind this up quickly if you would please just turn in your Bibles to Galatians chapter 8 Galatians chapter I'm sorry Galatians chapter 4 there is no Galatians chapter 8 you say God how brother Joel to know his Bible everybody loved the Lord Jesus this morning a man like your best boy says let's have church we come to have church amen glory to God certainly appreciate brother Jack and all that he's doing for the bride not just here in West Palm Beach but around the world how God is just sending him around and maybe you say well why would brother Jack have to go to Africa why would he have to go to Johnson City or Ohio well I would have to go there because God ordained him in his ministry maybe just to reach one and that one soul is worth 10,000 world's to your God and God predestinated him to go that's why if God's telling you to go go it's just that simple well I don't know I don't let doubt come into your mind go if he calls you to go that he'll meet you when you get there Galatians chapter 4 verse 8 and you know friends that had nothing to do with my notes but I believe that God is speaking to somebody this morning Galatians chapter 4 verse 8 howbeit then when you were when you knew not God you did service unto them which by nature are no gods but now after that you have known God or rather known of God how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements where to you desire to be in bondage you observe days and months and times and years and I am afraid of you lest I have bestowed upon you late in vain brethren I brethren I beseech she be as I am for I am as ye ye have not injured me at all you know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at first and my temptation which was in my flesh she despised not nor rejected me nor rejected but received me as an angel of God even as Christ Jesus where is then the blessedness she spake afore I bear you record then if it had been possible ye would have plucked out your own eyes and have given them to me and I am therefore become am I now listen to this words 4:16 I love it am I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth mom am I am I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth preach against sin they sell ously affect you but now well yeh they would exclude you that she may not affect me but is good to be zealously affected always that a good thing and not only when I am present with you so you can praise him any time and you should praise him everywhere you go but I like verse 19 is where I drove this thought for this sermon right here he says my little children of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you my little children to whom I travail and birth until Christ the word before him then you all could that happen in the ephesian church age can it happen in Laodicea it did it is it still has the power to change lives today amen back a chapter in verse 1 Galatians 3 so some foolish Galatians who has bewitched you that ye should not obey the truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ has been evidently set forth crucified among you they were witnesses have happened in their very day but friends our prophet said that they're crucifying him again don't you love the word in its perfectness is perfect the sword is there an English major here please forgive me but don't you love the word in its perfectness I think we can say that perfectness Moses smote the rock how many times twice he was judged for he was supposed to do that but the perfectness of God Jesus Christ was slain two thousand years ago but today our prophet comes around and picks up that same verse we understand that the rock that followed them in the wilderness was Christ and he was spit there he was spitting twice he said that this day they crucified Jesus Christ again a flesh the perfectness of the word they crucified him again with their denominations they crucified him again by denying his word they've crucified him again by adding do you see friends there's no such thing as being baptized in the name of the Father Son Holy Ghost he said you must be baptized in the name singular the name singular of the Father of the Son and the Holy Ghost which is the Lord Jesus Christ also many people divide their Bible and a half and say I'll take the red letters over your estimate I'll take what Jesus said over Peter but what they don't recognize it's Peter had a revelation of Matthew 28:19 lynnie said repent of your sin and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for their mission said and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost Jesus when he left he said I will be with you I will be with you I will be in you unto the ends of the world what his seal comes upon you according to Ephesians 4:30 you are sail until the day of your Redemption there is nothing can take that seal off of your life and there's no fear in that then Oh fear comes and paralyzes believers paralyzes people Oh what if I don't get it what if I'm not forgiving what if I'm not good enough and they walk around they down no you're a child of the king you remember brother Branham told the story of them young man on the plantation he walked out with his chest out a little bit different they said you feed him different he says no no he's just one of the servants no why does he have differences I wonder so myself and I found out in his motherland he's the son of a game and although an alien in his country he's away from his kindred he's away from his family he still conducts himself as a child of a king well friends you are children of a king you're pilgrims and strangers in this world you look different you walk different you talk effort you do different things than the rest of the world but you walk forward with your chest out your head high because you're a child I'm not a king put your child of a king and his royal blood flows through your veins Oh friends that's something to rejoice about we see the world getting worse and worse and worse it works all the time I just heard in my home state of Ohio and there's been man in the high o Supreme Court it's not too pretty bait right now whether they can put the child's gender on their birth certificate when they're born such profanity such filth such nonsense growing up I never in a million years thought something like when I was in school we still pray it was against the law but we still did it I still had a teacher the Hedden of God about her that we still pray for our food what's it like thirty years later you don't even give them just some name tree or apple or something like that that's completely gender neutral it's for yeah you're laughing because it's funny it's ridiculous but they think that's real and they're paying millions of dollars to debate whether it's okay to put em er F on a birth certificate as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be and the day when the Son of Man is revealed if you don't see Jesus Christ say open the eyes of my heart Lord open the eyes of my heart I want to see you I want to see you higher lift it up Apostle Paul says my little children to whom I travail in birth to Christ be formed in you you see it's the ministers labor of love to preach the word and to keep the church in line and so brother Branham told the vision that he saw of the bride and she was marching to the beat of the gospel there was one being led by a witch there was one listening to rock and roll music but it wasn't the one not the sainted little lady with her hair flowing down her back dressed in godly attire not trying to look like the world not being influenced by the things of the world but she was walking to the beat of onward Christian soldiers marching is the done to war with the cross of Jesus going on before he said that I saw the Asian Church no such bill then I saw the American Church and he said listening to rock and roll music and I thought to myself mine maybe it was the influence of the rock and roll on the Christian music of the day but just recently some of the brothers in our church have been invited to a prayer meeting at one of the mega churches of the of Sarasota and when they got there when they opened the door to get out it wasn't Christian rock and roll music playing it was just plain old Led Zeppelin it was just straight-up music from the pit of hell you say well the recipe we've got to do something to draw the masses in friends were not here for the masses he's a Gleaner he picks that one he says that one's mine that one's mine that was mine he picked you out of all the West Palm Beach think about how special you are out of all the people I don't know how many people live in this city he said but you're mine you're predestinated to emulate me under every process under every prophet I'm hurryin under every prophets message it Israel God of birth pain because that these prophets would come on the scene after the theologian and the clergyman have the churches in all organized form and when the prophets come on the scene with thus saith the Lord they shipped them churches and she had a birth pain finally she had birds planes birth pains bum on up into the delivered son of the gospel which was the word itself made flesh so the church really a birth pains tonight again for the deliverance of the son of God the Son of God to come again all the theologians and all the systems and all the other denominations had rotted right out from under us so we see a birth pain and the message from God always throws that message throws the church and the heavier pain but after a while she's going to be delivered of a bride the church is delivered of a bride he said come out of her my people that will bring forth Jesus Christ to his bride growing the message of the hour revealed Jesus Christ to you and in doing so where were you at the cross have you ever thought about that you were in him what come forth from his body that day blood water and spirit what are you made of blood water and spirit and every birth what comes first water blood and then a spirit like a brother just told me just a few moments ago he said with every birth it's a mess every birth is a mess so that day at Calvary Jesus Christ was slayed and looked to the rest of the world like he could never come back he was beaten he was bruised he was torn to pieces of course no bone of his body was broken according to the prophecy of the word but in him put in a grave that day but what come forth from that that day you and they ought to see you in 2018 he was waiting for a bride that he could live in that's the reason we can make the statement today that the message is alive the Word of God is alive why because it's living in you it's changing you and molding you and making you into the image of Almighty God that's why I say Prince it's not you trying it's not you runnings not him their will if you're in the running but God with mercy its God then directly I heard a real sweet music come again and here come that same little bride coming by again and he said this is what comes out though and when she walked by she's exactly like the ones was in the first place walking to the step of the music of God's Word marching on by and when I saw it I stood there with both hands up crying like that said would he come - he was standing out there saying because you know she was a couple of them towards the back of that line started looking at the worldly Church I don't know what she was thinking but she was looking at that maybe there was just a little attraction well maybe that's my a friend of mine they used to be in this line going up and now they're in that line going down and maybe I'll straddle the line don't straddle the line friends you can't do it but he said something kind of got distracted and began to look at that other church it was worldly and dancing and doing immoral things of the world oh there's a dance it's alright but it's a godly Holy Ghost and it's when the power of God comes down on you and then you advance but you don't have to do these worldly twitches and things that they do it in the world to draw attention to themselves when you dance you're drawing the attention of the Father [Music] do you believe Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever you see the Bible says it's through the foolishness of preaching that men's souls are saved like I told you before I'm closing I don't know who has the Holy Ghost and who don't but Jesus Christ is here this morning if you don't have it in your life if you need healing whatever you have need of Jesus Christ is here to answer your need he said I am the same yesterday today and forever he's the Alpha and the Omega he is the enve he was at with the in between is that right he's here in his fullness today whatever you have need of what he speaks to you through his word the brides responsible be it unto me according to thy word be it unto me according to that word it may bring reproach it may bring things upon you that you just not wanting to do but you responsibly be it unto me if the musicians that come forth this morning be it unto me the little girls response to the word for her name let's just bow our heads gracious Heavenly Father while you're here while you're moving amongst your people Lord we know that where the Spirit of God is there is Liberty Lord and without a shadow of a doubt you are here this morning because you have said that she would be so Heavenly Father we know without a shadow of a doubt that as our prophet had a dream one day that your children were bound in a cave and big heavy bars have them held up bound up and they said brother branham delivers he said I can't do it I just physically can't do it and then you appeared to him and he said deliver those people he looked back at them and said in the name of Jesus Christ House of Hell give way Oh glory to God Lord Jesus and he said that there was great popping and creaking as those doors had to give way to the name of Lord Jesus Christ so what there is this morning whatever fear whatever problem whatever would be fighting a little one of your Eagles this morning dear God we play now in the name of Jesus Christ awesome he'll give way to the name of Jesus Christ heavenly father I just pray dear God for that little one that little sheep whoever it would be Lord that your Holy Spirit would just go out to them your word says that you left the ninety and nine and one after the one Oh God and the consolation is the 99 were in the fold she was in a place where she could never be heard or nothing could ever get to her again but you and after that little one and I thank you so much dear God that one day back in 1995 I was that little one and you reached down your hand to me dear God Lord it was so thankful for that and the same Jesus Christ the same power of God is here today to reach out to whoever may need it I just pray now in the name of Jesus Christ that your Holy Spirit would just be here just brooding over each one answer questions dissolve doubts heal the sick and fill with the baptism or the Holy Ghost and fire and whatever your children may go I pray Lord that they would be testimonies and examples that there is the Jesus Christ that you're still healing Lord and that you're still empowering a people to live your word sweet Jesus we love you now Lord we just commit each and every one now to the
