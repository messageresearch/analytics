Church say you man we're gonna that's a turning our Bibles to Joshua we'll read a quick from the first chapter and then know that you have your seats and we'll go from there amen Joshua the first chapter now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of nun Moses minister saying Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise and go over this Jordan died and all this this people unto the land which I do give thee even to the children of Israel amen you may be seated amen being a kind of Bible Bible studies sort of a less informal sort of gathering just want to take our time and just take a look at some of these things I believe that the Lord is uh kind of have this inspired because even before the meetings I was kind of just looking at a certain subject on the message that the prophets speak spoke on respect and I didn't even realize it but the the video had came out just today the YouTube and when brother Joe got up here he sort of just kind of fell into that in talking about how in second Kings there how the the the woman they were they were coming to take her sons and and make them slaves but because she had a certain level of respect a man ensured a certain level respect for the gospel amen her sons were saved a man and then brother McGarry sort of just hit it on Sunday night and I say well Lord I'll tell you something else and no brother William I was right there and I said man I was just not even into that study into that and I started sharing with him some of the things that God had shown me and no month I got the words out of my mouth Jack was up here and he was kind of giving that monitor on the Stephanie he thought it's saying something to make things they said you're gonna learn to be talking around he preaches stop preaching your message so but I just believed you know I was talking about it and we were fellowshipping around it in there are seven brothers Danny was saying I said yeah because we all fish in the same pond name man it's the same Holy Ghost amen so looking at this I don't know you know if I had the title it I I would say I would say to the church this evening it's checking up time checking up time we're living we're living in a great hour we understand and we understand that uh we have to be in place to do our part God has called us amen to to be more than just how should I say more than just the come and sit and observe Amen you are eight an intricate part of what God is doing in this out amen your your your your your what you're doing is just as important amen as anybody else just as important because he's the gospel amen it comes to them we'll look at this oh man and in Scripture here let's just take let me go back and say what I was saying the gospel is just as important all the way down through amen the the tree all the way down through the bus a little start in a prophet but but it but it moves on through the body and it's just as important as it was in the Prophet as it was as it was as it is in the ministry as it is and the lay members it's the same word and it's the same responsibility amen and it's the same Holy Ghost amen so looking here we read Joshua what we see where the Joshua were the death of Moses and it was Joshua's job to to carry it on Moses we had spoke about a few weeks ago that the grace of men on that journey coming out of Egypt and redemption is a two-part coming out of and going into but we have to recognize that Moses the Prophet brought them out but it was Joshua that took them in so a midnight date of Moses being the Prophet a man had a certain level of respect they men had a certain level of where the people looked to Moses but they at that point they had to be able to recognize that the cigar was no longer using Moses but that same level of respect had to go to Joshua a man and even further we'll we'll read on down here let's look at this taking it from Joshua the second chapter amen remember it's checking up time and Joshua the son of not sit down of shittim two men to spy secretly saying go view the land even Jerico and they went out and came into the harlots house named Rahab to lodge there and it was told to the king of Jericho saying behold that came in in his - tonight of the children of Israel to search out the country and the king of Jericho sent them to rehab saying breathe forth to me and that I come to thee which are entered into thine house and they become to search all the country and the woman took the two men and heed them and said thus there came men unto me but I wish not which they were and and it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate when it was dark that the men went out whither the men went out what not pursued after them quickly for ye shall overtake them amen but she had brought them to the roof of the house and heed them with us with the stomps of the Flex which she had laid in order upon her roof and the men pursued after them by the way of Jordan unto the force and as soon as the as soon as they which pursued after them were gone she shut the gate and before they were laid down she came up - upon the roof and she said unto the men I know that the Lord has given you the land that you're that I know she said unto the men I know that the Lord has given you the lane and that your terror is falling upon us and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you for we have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt and I came out of Egypt and what he did to the kings of the ammonites that were on the other side of Jordan Sion and all whom ye utterly utterly destroyed now as soon as they had heard these things their hearts did melt neither did they remain any more courage in any man because of you the Lord God the Lord your God He is God in heaven above and in earth she says now therefore I pray you swear to me by the Lord since I showed you kindness and ye will also show kindness unto my father's house and give me a true token and that ye will save alive my father my mother my brother my sister and all that health and delivered our lives from death now I want you to notice that this harlot this Gentile Amen she had a certain level of respect she recognized Amen that God was with these people she had heard about the things that was going on that they had done and and not only her but all of the land but-but-but-but she had a certain level of respect for the gospel even though it wasn't to her there are several different places throughout scripture that we can see the same example a man that that because of a certain level of respect that they've had now let me say they chi-chi-chi didn't have this level of respect for Moses she but that wasn't to Moses she wasn't talking to Moses amen Joshua was not there she wasn't talking to Joshua she was talking to two unknown men but she had respect for the message of that out she had a certain level of respect not for that message and those men a man that came out to spy out the letter now she could have she cheat she she had choices she could have said who do you think you are and all of these sorts of things but because of her kindness and the level of respect that she had sure they meant God saved her her respect to these men and to the message was recognized amen all the way by through the ranks of God himself honor the messengers because she added the messages amen and the woman yet the people the message came to entreat their local ministers that are trying to tell them about even a greater message of deliverance for us and our families in this state and we'll treat them with such disrespect like they are almost entrusting the people of the earth and then wonder why there is no token applies to their families Amen I was I was talking about that out on a palm aware and that for stage and say and turnabout was I mentioned be careful very careful how you how you handle amen the message the word and it's ministers and it's anointed careful how you don't know another careful how you speak about one another there's a certain level of respect you are the bride of Jesus Christ you don't talk to the bride of Jesus Christ any okay no way there was in this message respect the Prophet was bringing out how there was a certain level of disrespect Elijah had gone on and the mantle was passed down to Elijah and and and no doubt he was talking about how they were at the house it was a certain family or whatever that may have been at the dinner table and having conversation and their conversation was about this old prophet who did he think he is saying all kind of manner of things against the message and the messenger now the children over here in this conversation over hearing these adults badmouth and say all sorts of things about a man what God is doing about the message about the messenger and so kids being kids amen they learned how to learn behavior just by osmosis amen there are sponges and they just kind of soak up the energy and soak up the conversation that they overhear the adults speaking amen and in me they kind of take on that spirit proverbs 20 second shot to the 24th and 25th work he says no makes make no friendship with an angry man and with the furious man for thou shalt not go let's now learn his ways and get a snare to your soul first Corinthians 15:33 say be not deceived evil communications corrupt good manners amen evil communications corrupt good manners and we see that in this situation here where they were these children of those they happened to see this profit and they began to tease this profit because they just kind of picked up from what their parents what they had heard they had no idea they did with children they didn't know any better they was just repeating what they had heard and had picked up the spirit through the communication of the adults that was supposed to be leading them and around them and they began to talk and cheese the profit and it cost them their lives so we see on one hand where one of our lead Rahab she had she she recognized and had a certain level respect for these ministers in her house was saved and on the other hand because the level of disrespect that children was lost we talking about its checking uptime watch how we handle one another watch how I will approach to the gospel because see I believe what the Lord is trying to get to us is that this is not a man in this hour this is the works of the Holy Spirit so works of the whole in there has to be a certain level of respect the Prophet was talking about another message I can't call it right now but he said that I've been all over the world I spoke the kings and judges and different things now you don't walk into the courtroom and say hey yo how to do was a no you have to address him with the certain level of respect if you expect to get anything yes Your Honor may I approach may I approach the bench your honor sir you have to approach him with a certain level of respect he said he was talking about on the keys you know you don't go into a kingdom a man and talk to the king queen Prince any kind of way there's a certain level there's a certain way that you have to approach a man that same thing applies in this hour okay if we're going to get anything from God it's a certain level it's a certain way of approach to the Gospels a certain way of approach a man to the ministry a certain level of approach that we have to one another a man now we move on her we see here in Joshua the sixth chapter and the fifteenth verse reads and it came to pass on the seventh day that they rose early about the dawning of the day and to capacitor about the city after the same man of seven times only on that day they come past about the city seven times and it came to pass and it came to pass at the seventh time when the priests blew the trumpets Joshua was said to the people shop for the Lord has given the you the city the seventeen first and the city shall be accursed even it and all that are therein to the Lord only Rahab the harlot I live she and all that are with her in the house because she hid the messengers that was saying 21st and they utterly destroyed all all that that was in the city both man woman young and old ox sheep as an edge of the with the end of the sward but Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country go into the harlots house and bring out thence the woman and all that she has as ye swear to her and the young men that were spies went in and brought out rehab and her father and her mother and her brother and all she had and they brought all of her kindred my god and left them with without the camp of issue of Israel and they burnt the city with fire and all was there in only the silver and gold and the vessels of brass and iron they put into a Treasury of the house of the Lord and Joshua was saying Rahab the harlot alive in her father's household and all that she had and she dwelt in Israel even unto this day because she hated the messengers which Joshua was sent to spy out Jericho a man now Joshua we see by the leadership a men of the Holy Spirit led the people into their inheritance of what God had promised them through the Ministry of Moses theirs was a natural inheritance ours is a spiritual inheritance even greater than the natural one the same thing is going on a date the Prophet was talking about how how Joshua parallels Ephesians Joshua parallels Ephesians and Ephesians parent lay lady of ceiling the same thing is going on today Amen well we're going over into it and into an inheritance a man to claim a man what is rightfully ours now I wanted to aside and just say now we noticed that they had to fight we had a wonderful weekend people gained ground we all gain ground I know I am sitting in heavenly places this morning a man still Thank You Marella still flowed from the weekend and the things that always said and how God really just blessed us we've gained new ground but you have to fight to keep it you have to fight to keep it because the devil wants to come and get that ground back he wants to come and make you regress from what you have gained no we have to fight and move forward move forward amen God has so much more for us it's been said that we are living so far beneath our means why three things we have to understand we have to recognize who he is who we are and what time we're living in we can recognize those things it would give us to courage a man to move forward we already have the victory it's already ours we just have to claim it we're talking about manifestations and different things of that nature but your president was saying in one area that was talking to the prophets saying well why you always only women about this short hair and the makeup and the way they dress and and all of these things he says how can I preached a PCS if they don't algebra when they came feces same thing here and we may not be we were beyond some of those things and we know how to carry ourselves we know how to dress I had to take some antibiotics and my wife was share and she said well uh you you can't take those antibiotics like that just you can't take them when you want to you have to follow the directions if it says take them every six hours you have to take it every six hours because that's how the medication was designed it wants to keep the the right amount of antibodies in your system at the highest level for a certain amount of time Amen so we come amen and we take the antibiotics we can't if you if you get off a little of the prescription off of the direction what happens you you but you do weaken of the amount of medication in your system what am I saying I know a lot of times we get busy I'll put it this way a minister said this right here once and I thought it was very very good you see you come to church on Sunday because you love the church you can come on Sunday night because you love the pastor you come on wins and my god you love the Lord okay it is important I will share what the fella just this weekend and he was say me y'all go to church too much I say well brother what is too much to you you know too much to you because you don't have an understanding as I said to him I said you know God meets all his appointments and if I was going to the doctor and I had an ailment and I go to the doctor and the doctors say well I want you to go home and do this thing come back at this time I'm going to get another appointment and we'll do something that's I got a check you out and see how that's working and you missed the appointment what does nothing he can do how can he Shh it's checking out of time how can he check you up when you missed the appointment the house of God amen is a house of correction is the house of print since is the check this is the clinic passages preached not too long ago he says every time you come again if you went to the to the hospital you you you you come in and you want to go out fixed the problem was talking about the young lady I said the young lady she was an old lady called the colored woman that got hit by the car and she said you needed the car said no not in Lord his son I need fixing I need fixing amen and we need to recognize and the spiritual sense that we need fixing we need fixing praise the Lord we can't wait we have the appointments is that this is vitally important God keeps all this importance is important that we keep on not now you say well were you just trying to am I to come to church come to church this is for your own good you in this hour is not about willpower that's see that's where a lot of people were willpower the truth to live a certain way and to carry themself a certain way you just got to have a certain amount of willpower he's saying God nothing to do with you this is the word that's doing the changing it's the Word of God that's building cell on top of self amen giving you what you need to sustain in these last and evil days amen it's them did the antibiotics that staying at a high in your system you miss a couple of dozen antibiotic and then the medicine in your system is getting low and you susceptible a man to catchy or the thing that they're trying to fight coming back it's a demon so you have to take the antibiotic prescription up to a certain level of strength and you can't do that by not feeding on the word of God which is the antibiotic you say well I can stay home and I can stream that's not the same as being in the atmosphere the doctor can called you into and tell you well are you doing it actually how you doing no he got that actually he got this press he'll draw blood and do all of these sorts of things see the Word of God in the desert of the it's a discerner amen a sharper than the 2-inch war you got to come in that's showing a certain level of respect that's showing that you are convinced my God that you are convinced that hell is at the house of the Lord you find yourself on we stay in home and and and and and and and and so well I was just going to listen to the tapes and I'm just going to do these sorts of things amen you're getting weak you don't realize it I don't if I miss my antibiotic I don't feel it I don't feel any different I feel just the same but on the inside the level of medication has decreased you can stay home and you can read your Bible I promise you that if you miss service you stay at home for six months and just I read my Bible is the same word but I promise you you'll see a change in you you'll see a change in your life and I tell you one for you miss one service is easy to miss - you miss - it's easy to miss folk watch the devil watch the devil pray for one another we're all in the battle we're all in the back and we are all in it together any man you see one who says that no eating even if you don't conscious Lord Jesus III haven't seen such and such a noble Lord I send the tow package Lord Lord whatever it is that may be hindering them Oh father god I pray Lord that day that they're safe for the safety in their foot I encourage them O Lord God because we know how important it judges go at all time must be a certain level of respect a certain level of understanding of what's going on in this out amen let me move on here Matthew touch in Chapter II says he that receiveth the prophet and the name of a prophet receives a prophet reward and he that received a righteous man in the name of a righteous man seems a righteous man award reward see it's not all it to the Prophet but as he's here talking here the final ministry don't take these things for granted of what God has has has given a man what to get us ready for a rapture amen thank you Jesus says he'll they believe to a point of coming out but couldn't believe beyond the state that God the prophet believing in Joshua the leadership of the Holy Spirit the least of the ones who carry the message of the hour I'm gonna read that again they believed to the point of coming out they had faith to come out but they could have believed beyond the stage of God sent a prophet to believing in Joshua and the leadership of the Holy Spirit we believe that God sent a prophet but what happens is a problem a lot of times we believe God sent a prophet but way but when it comes to the Holy Ghost leading Joshua there they had a problem well I see it in brother Branham but do I see it in the FIFO queue ministry do I have that same level of respect they made for the messages I had for my pastor a matter for the fivefold ministry that's coming through it's the Holy Ghost excuse me it's the Holy Ghost amen he said the Holy Ghost is here the same work a man nightwear that was in the prophet a man is passed through the bride amen and he said it order fivefold ministry for what the perfecting of the saints I use the analogy once that this perfecting of the Saints the Prophet is came in and and he's given us the material that faces the substance of things hoped for the material work when they gave us a basic outline a man of the bride but now it's the job of the fivefold ministry to do the little fine-tuning so that it coming through the full likeness a man of the bride the Prophet laid everything has put everything in the store she gave us the tools to work with he gave us to hammer the chisel he gave us to find carving and materials and things to do the fine tuning on this masterpiece amen amen so the fact that fivefold ministry is carrying out a man the same order amen that the Prophet was carrying out Moses my servant is dead now was the responsibility of Joshua then Joshua been typing a hold of ghost st. two spies to save this Gentile harlot woman the type of the fivefold ministry amen hey man I got a move on see my time is getting away so we see uh in the message to India report the prophecy uh but I got better hopes of you brethren here this morning that you'll be men of God who stay with the word and let everything else fall to the left but stay right with that word he says don't move no matter if you're a doormat out there be a good doormat don't try to compete with someone else or do this just get right in the word and stay right there and God will positionally place you into his kingdom where you can be the best now this is why you want to serve the Lord in your local church where God has placed you that is a very powerful thing don't ever let the devil move you out of your position of service don't ever let the doesn't move you out of your position of service because the position is an important part of the purpose of God in this hour no matter how small it seems very important Church is a place that individuals can we can serve one another as a body of believers it is not just coming to this building it is also then as the body of believers we then serve other parts of the body of Christ in other places and this is why the devil wants to destroy this church because we are making a difference by our service to the body of Christ in our community amen because we're making a difference now not now not now see we don't own the Bible that some people have read the only Bible that some people would ever read amen so you have just as much of a responsibility amen to share the word and to be a man a missionary in your community as the pastor does as the fivefold ministry amen just like you were saying that back the word comes down because thoughts at the Prophet amen through the Holy Ghost threw a yielded vessel amen two two two fivefold ministry to the lamb team to the community see it's all the vessels in every point to it and who's that received you not so much they might not run into brother Jack they may not run into brother Troy they may not running in a minister but they run into you so you're you're part of the vessel is just as important as the prophets it's checking up time now I want to say something here and I'm going to be bringing this to a close one of the mistakes that I've seen the Lord has been dealing with me on we talked about last week a couple of weeks ago rather we was talking about the journey from law degrees and we'll find that we'll get to a point and we feel like well I'm there I got it the Word of God is an endless will I can never have enough he's an inexhaustible fountain lady told my wife she was sharing with her on a job because she noticed the differences she's Christian lady you know she but they look different and she was sort of probing and when the devil tells you it don't take all that you know it's the veil because God would never tell you to just get so much in stock he'll never tell you say if this is the line he'll never just get you right to the other side of the line and say that's enough that's good enough come on people are so deceived by the enemy in this hour if this is the line I want to be all the way over there not even close to the line so when he says well it don't take all that well maybe it don't take all this but I'm gonna do this anyway because I know it pleases them even if it don't take all of that I know it just gives him joy so i'ma do it even if I don't have to do it see that's the attitude that's having respect for the message so what I say is this we see that a lot of times in spiritually speaking we get to a place oh this is good enough the the pool that the desire the fervent desire to have more just kind of what I get comfortable here and I'll stay right here no you have to keep pressing forward the problem is prophesied this hear the message convinced then consider he says now there's so many people say if you quiver hold your eyes shut do all kinds of things and get sensations you you get spirits friend but if your life don't tally up to what you're professing then there's something wrong with the spirit you gotta see the and it's true you must be sure he preached a message called presuming we don't want to pursue in this hour we want to constantly be checking up to make sure we have what we're professing it is a constant checking up of our selves by the word we don't want to pursue min this hour he says you must be sure the Holy Spirit will bring forth a holy life that's right and if the desire is in your heart if you have to if you have to force yourself constantly to crack to press and do what's right and the world is still Hungary in you then there's something wrong see the Holy Spirit in you will not hunger for the world it'll hunger for God if it's hard for you to go to church and press yourself to come with the touches open there's something wrong with the spirit it's trying to keep you away from God the spirit of God will run you right straight to the church every time the door is open for fellowship yes sir see so you've got to be sure of this now the time is at hand it's checking up time it is the hour where the wise Virgin is trimming her lamps and making sure she has enough oil for the journey so what am I trying to say let's not get complacent let's not get rest on our laws we're doing real well went wait wait wait when I like the fishing we're not cleaning fish every now indeed I'm using the knife and I'm cleaning the fish at night I may cut myself maybe some of your sisters know when you're cooking you're in the kitchen you're cooking and you're using that knife and times you get a little cut on your hand see so when if we're up here and we're in the wilderness war amen sometimes we get cut to say Lord I'm chicken up I'm checking up make sure that I have what I'm professor because the time is at hand amen be honest with ourselves my god press forward let's let us not get weary in well-doing it's not time to relax we're in a battle the enemy comes a man to the ground that we've gained I believe we've gained ground and we're constantly gaining ground but if you don't stay on the office if you don't keep fighting amen you will lose ground you will lose ground in the Ezekiel well let me say this first the prophets sayidina what I don't have the message he says do you realize the responsibility of this city he's talking about Tempe I believe that's Tempe Arizona but I'm gonna say the responsibility of this city here in West Palm Beach he said I believe is resting upon your shoulders I believe God has made you lighthouses each one of you didn't have the responsibility of the sins of the city is resting upon you is resting upon ministers upon the church people the pilgrims as we journey through is resting upon you young people I'm not in your school that's your job that's where God has placed you I don't run in your circles so you are responsible for the Lighthouse of the word in the circles that you run in God has placed that responsibility squarely in your lap squarely in your lap it's your responsibility amen don't take it lightly you are part of the vessel that the Holy Spirit is using a man in Ezekiel the 36 chapter he says I will sanctify my great name the 23rd verse I was think defy my great name which was profaned among the heathen which he have profaned in the midst of them and the heathen shall know I shall known that I am the Lord sayeth the Lord God when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes for I will take you from among the heathen and gather you out of all countries and will bring you into your own land then will I sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be clean from all your filthiness and from your idols will I cleanse you 26 verse says a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you now I want to start right there some people make the mistake he said I will put a new spirit in you and we think that's the Holy Spirit because you don't do the things you do anymore he's the Prophet said that he had to give you a new spirit so that that old ugly spirit that you used to had and get along with the Holy Spirit he had to change your nature so that the nature a man of that lamb a man the Dove the Holy Spirit can come and fellowship they have like natures but he had to change your nature sometime we get complacent with just a new spirit and never go on to the Holy Spirit a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit what I put in you and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh the stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of flesh and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and ye shall keep my judgments and do them let us not stop at just a new spirit let's make sure that we have the holy spirit the holy spirit that vessel will have us to do the same thing that the Prophet was doing now I'm not saying you're gonna be speaking or squirrels and to assistants and all of these kind of things don't misunderstand me but the manifestation of the love of God and if there's a need for you to speak a squirrel I believe you have the faith within you to speak it but let's just try to have a love of God the concern of God it should and you know when I am in the prayed up just right and it does I walk out in the streets and it just
