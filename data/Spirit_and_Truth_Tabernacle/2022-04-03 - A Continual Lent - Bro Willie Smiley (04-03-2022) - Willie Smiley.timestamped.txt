[48:08] in milton florida man it's
[48:11] almost all day drive it's good to have
[48:13] our visitors with us also this morning
[48:17] and we had a real wonderful time and the
[48:19] saints up there bring
[48:21] says their greetings and
[48:23] let's remember brother jack and the
[48:25] saints
[48:26] brother troy told me uh he preaching the
[48:29] house down
[48:30] we're going to be looking in the book of
[48:32] matthew chapter 16 in second timothy
[48:34] chapter 3.
[48:36] so let's remember
[48:38] him in prayer
[48:40] this morning
[48:42] just continue to pray for the service
[48:44] this morning and
[48:46] we just want to trust that the holy
[48:47] spirit
[48:49] helped me to get out of the way
[48:51] i was kind of undecided on what i wanted
[48:54] to preach
[48:55] this morning i had something that i
[48:57] thought i would preach but
[49:00] you know you just want to follow the
[49:02] leading of the spirit
[49:04] uh
[49:05] saint matthew chapter 16 we want to read
[49:08] the 24th and maybe the 25th verse it
[49:10] says
[49:11] then said jesus unto his disciples if
[49:14] any man will come after me
[49:16] let him deny himself and take up his
[49:19] cross and follow me
[49:21] for whosoever will save his life shall
[49:23] lose and whosoever will lose his life
[49:26] for my sake shall find it and let us go
[49:30] to second timothy chapter three
[49:36] um
[49:38] we want to start at the first verse it
[49:41] says this know also that
[49:43] in the last days
[49:45] perilous times shall come
[49:48] for men shall be lovers of their own
[49:50] selves covetous boasters
[49:53] proud blasphemers disobedient to parents
[49:57] unthankful unholy without natural
[49:59] affection
[50:01] truth breakers false accusers
[50:03] incontinent fierce despisers of those
[50:06] that are good
[50:08] traitors heady high-minded lovers of
[50:10] pleasure more than lovers of god
[50:13] having a form of godliness but
[50:15] denying the power thereof from such turn
[50:18] away
[50:20] for of this sort are they which creep
[50:22] into houses and lead
[50:25] captives silly women laden with sins
[50:28] led away with divers lust ever learning
[50:31] and never able to come
[50:33] to the knowledge
[50:34] of the truth let us just buy his
[50:38] gracious father we just thank you this
[50:40] morning for
[50:41] just allowing us to be here once again
[50:43] and uh we report for duty and uh
[50:47] we just
[50:48] trust that you open our mouths to the
[50:50] things that you desire to be said and to
[50:52] the things that
[50:55] you don't want to be said lord we don't
[50:57] want to say it
[50:58] lord my brother jack was saying the
[51:00] other night it was things that
[51:03] he thought about saying
[51:05] and he felt checked so
[51:08] uh we we're just here to just try to be
[51:11] uh a blessing and and help the people to
[51:14] come to this place of maturity
[51:16] that uh brother jack's been preaching on
[51:18] in his series
[51:20] so we're just trusting and depending on
[51:21] you that's when it's all said and done
[51:23] you can get the glory and the honor for
[51:25] what in jesus name amen amen you may be
[51:28] seated
[51:30] uh this morning i i just like to use as
[51:33] a little
[51:34] title to i
[51:36] thought
[51:37] um
[51:38] a continual lent
[51:41] and uh maybe as a context
[51:44] uh
[51:45] religious versus true christianity
[51:49] we we realized that we we're
[51:53] in in the season of uh of lent
[51:57] uh which is
[51:59] from march
[52:00] the second up until about april the 14th
[52:04] and um
[52:07] i'm i'm kind of going to just lay a
[52:09] foundation and kind of move forward and
[52:11] then kind of have to backtrack because
[52:14] of some things that i kind of want to
[52:16] uh just get out nothing just something
[52:19] just to help us i think as as christians
[52:22] um
[52:23] um we don't we one of the things that we
[52:25] don't want to be and i'm not a
[52:27] traditionalist i don't
[52:29] i don't do tradition you know growing up
[52:32] in church and around church
[52:34] you know we saw a lot of tradition even
[52:37] when jesus came on the scene
[52:40] uh he rebuked the people because it was
[52:42] so much tradition going on and not so
[52:45] much word
[52:47] and and and uh
[52:49] we we we don't want to be religious this
[52:53] this is the date according to
[52:55] uh uh ii timothy the spirit of the day
[52:59] is this where
[53:00] people are headed high-minded and just
[53:03] all of these other types of spirits but
[53:05] the the most important thing is that
[53:07] people have a form of godliness
[53:10] but but they they denying the power uh
[53:14] thereof that people people in in this
[53:17] age that we're living in they're turning
[53:19] away from actual scriptures and and what
[53:23] we find is that they're bringing in
[53:25] their their own
[53:26] perspectives in their own opinions and
[53:29] things of that nature
[53:31] and and what what we we find um in going
[53:34] back to genesis which we know uh genesis
[53:38] is the seed chapter of the bible can i
[53:40] get a witness this morning
[53:42] genesis is the seed chapter of the bible
[53:45] and the prophet he makes the statement
[53:47] in his teaching he said he he talked
[53:49] about
[53:50] the things that that started out way
[53:53] back then
[53:55] he said you could find the spirit of
[53:57] these things all the way back to genesis
[53:59] is that right because when we look back
[54:02] to genesis i like to work from genesis
[54:04] brother branham he talked about he go
[54:06] from genesis to revelation and keep
[54:08] going but but we we find uh the true
[54:12] perspective of god when you go back to
[54:15] genesis god's first and perfect act the
[54:18] first uh first and perfect church we can
[54:22] see the divine order and all of those
[54:24] different things when we go back to
[54:26] genesis
[54:28] right
[54:29] uh then we we see
[54:31] fallacy we see all of these things when
[54:34] they come in said right after the
[54:36] fall from the start initially we see
[54:40] perfection i love perfection church
[54:43] i love i love perfection we're gonna go
[54:46] somewhere this morning i hope y'all come
[54:47] to have church this morning
[54:49] i hope y'all didn't come to just look at
[54:51] me instead man and get scared relax
[54:54] everybody take a deep breath this
[54:56] morning y'all look a little tight y'all
[54:57] make me nervous
[55:00] lord have mercy i was telling brother
[55:02] choi man i
[55:04] i used to didn't be afraid to preach but
[55:06] folks started to make me nervous about
[55:08] preaching
[55:09] you get you get to talking and people
[55:11] get offended and we we get all of that
[55:14] it make me just want to see that back
[55:16] cone over there
[55:17] and let the rest of the brothers let the
[55:19] rest of the brothers have it
[55:21] but cause i'm different y'all ought to
[55:23] know that by now i've been here a year
[55:26] and i just i just like to say what's on
[55:28] my heart
[55:29] and sometimes it hurt my feelings
[55:33] but but i think
[55:35] if
[55:36] if it's medicine and it don't taste good
[55:39] it'll do us good
[55:42] say right because i don't know about you
[55:44] you know i i grew up a certain way i
[55:46] grew up i grew up going to the baptist
[55:49] church i i grew up going to
[55:52] pentecostal church and and when i study
[55:55] scripture even when we go back to the
[55:58] new testament church in in at the book
[56:01] of acts
[56:02] right we didn't have all of this all we
[56:04] had was one lord one faith and one
[56:07] baptism
[56:08] is that right but but but something's
[56:11] definitely got to be wrong because we
[56:13] got about 900 a thousand different
[56:16] denominations a lot of different names
[56:19] and i think brother jack alluded to this
[56:21] the other day he was saying what happens
[56:24] is this person get mad at the pastor's
[56:27] preaching y'all don't talk to me i guess
[56:29] i'm gonna have to pull y'all we this one
[56:32] get mad and then he decides well i'm
[56:34] gonna go stop me something over here
[56:35] because
[56:36] if if it's true the bible said blessing
[56:39] is he that's not offended in me
[56:42] so so you cannot be offended at the word
[56:46] if you're a true believer
[56:50] as a true believer you can only say amen
[56:52] to the word of god
[56:54] so be it
[56:56] glory to his wonderful name so when we
[56:59] look at genesis what we we we find we
[57:02] find truth we we find the mind of god on
[57:05] display we find the perfect the perfect
[57:08] church and a oneness and harmony but
[57:11] then but then watch this
[57:13] uh uh satan comes in in the church
[57:17] here here's where the problem started
[57:19] right
[57:20] the church stopped and opened up the
[57:23] wound of their mind to
[57:26] uh accept seed
[57:29] that was not originally given by god
[57:33] right what was given by god was that day
[57:36] you eat there of that day you die we're
[57:38] gonna go somewhere y'all keep praying
[57:39] for him
[57:40] right
[57:41] that was the original uh thought of god
[57:44] right back in genesis but then the
[57:47] serpent
[57:48] right begow e he said well
[57:51] you know they was having conversation
[57:53] listen i'll tell you something you'll
[57:54] never win a reasoning battle with the
[57:56] devil that's right
[57:58] right but we do it we try to reason
[58:01] things and reason this and reason that
[58:04] see one of the things and we might read
[58:07] it i might quote it and keep going see
[58:09] the the devil chose
[58:12] the head
[58:14] the intellect god chose the heart
[58:19] right
[58:20] you we can never out think the devil
[58:23] as far as as far as reasoning is
[58:26] concerned
[58:27] it's it takes god to quicken the
[58:30] revelation of the word of god to us
[58:33] if it's not quick and you do not get it
[58:36] right
[58:38] right
[58:39] you can study study study study study
[58:41] study study study study study study
[58:43] study study study you won't get it until
[58:46] god reveal it i was thinking all week
[58:49] because i wanted to preach on something
[58:51] else and i was just thinking about when
[58:53] we look at scripture scriptures is like
[58:56] an onion
[58:58] right
[58:59] it's it's just so many layers
[59:02] so many layers
[59:04] and sometimes i think that you know uh
[59:07] we need to keep peeling back
[59:10] and peeling back so that we can get the
[59:12] true
[59:13] fullness amen of this plan of redemption
[59:17] is that right
[59:19] but but we cannot approach it from an
[59:21] intellectual standpoint
[59:24] because the devil the devil chose the
[59:27] head the prophet he makes a statement in
[59:30] a little message uh called um
[59:33] all the days of our lives 1959. he he
[59:36] starts to talk about and this is where i
[59:38] want to start from before i kind of
[59:41] move a little forward to lay a
[59:43] foundation because
[59:46] you know for me i'm different right uh
[59:49] in the way you you start looking at
[59:51] things and you listen to people and
[59:53] you'll be like man it's so far away from
[59:55] god and then anything we thank god that
[59:58] we had a messenger to bring us back to
[1:00:01] the bible
[1:00:04] maybe y'all ain't with me this morning
[1:00:07] god we we needed somebody to bring us
[1:00:10] back to the bible
[1:00:13] because because
[1:00:15] with through traditions and things of
[1:00:17] that nature we error
[1:00:19] it won't produce faith for rapture
[1:00:24] creeds and see
[1:00:26] we needed see when jesus came on the
[1:00:28] scene you know what jesus did he just
[1:00:30] ripped down stuff
[1:00:33] he just was constantly in in his
[1:00:36] understanding
[1:00:37] of of scripture and prophecy it was
[1:00:41] constantly tearing down and and and men
[1:00:44] through denominations and creeds
[1:00:46] pharisees and sadducees that was all the
[1:00:49] time upset with christ
[1:00:52] right
[1:00:52] because his ministry was just so
[1:00:55] contrary
[1:00:57] to the things that they were doing it
[1:00:59] was word
[1:01:00] mixed with man's opinions
[1:01:05] we don't want that
[1:01:06] we don't we don't we don't you don't you
[1:01:09] don't want word mixed with brother
[1:01:11] smileys or brother jack's opinion
[1:01:14] you want pure word we want to be feeding
[1:01:16] on pure words
[1:01:18] right
[1:01:20] thank god pure word has come down in the
[1:01:22] evening time so right
[1:01:25] so that we we don't want
[1:01:27] part word part man's opinions you know
[1:01:30] part man's feelings and things of that
[1:01:33] nature cause we'll be all jacked up
[1:01:36] especially in the day that we're living
[1:01:38] in where it's crazy
[1:01:41] you you start thinking about yourself
[1:01:43] thinking about the world and and and you
[1:01:45] know all of this i these identity crisis
[1:01:49] and where where where people just don't
[1:01:52] know who they are and and what they
[1:01:55] supposed to be you know it's crazy
[1:01:57] sometimes when you listen to this this
[1:01:59] type of stuff it's it's well who are you
[1:02:02] i'm him him heard they v what
[1:02:07] i'm baffled
[1:02:09] what are you they don't they don't they
[1:02:12] they want to be man woman boy girl and
[1:02:14] all of this it's like wait a minute
[1:02:17] i know i know if you're you're a boy you
[1:02:19] start out as a kid and
[1:02:21] but but you don't somewhere
[1:02:24] your your birth as a boy
[1:02:27] and then somewhere you say god made a
[1:02:29] mistake no you just got a spirit on you
[1:02:31] that's all that
[1:02:32] is right
[1:02:35] and and and look our crazy governor i
[1:02:38] used to kind of like him man one more
[1:02:40] i'm just kind of baffled now because you
[1:02:42] can't even say
[1:02:43] uh gay now
[1:02:46] that's hate speech but we knew that it
[1:02:48] was coming
[1:02:50] right why because of the asian hour that
[1:02:53] that we that we're living in we we we're
[1:02:55] back in bible times we back in the days
[1:02:58] of noah
[1:02:59] is that right glory to god
[1:03:02] so see these things are so important for
[1:03:05] us you say wow how is that important
[1:03:07] because we still raising up children
[1:03:10] see i don't have those types of issues
[1:03:12] because i know who i am right now
[1:03:15] but but right one day i'm gonna have
[1:03:17] some grandchildren and i got nieces and
[1:03:19] nephews coming up and they're being
[1:03:22] indoctrinated by all these different
[1:03:24] perspectives y'all come on talk to me
[1:03:27] they're being indoctrinated they're
[1:03:28] being influenced
[1:03:30] by by these right since the tina's a
[1:03:33] teacher and i'm quite sure she see this
[1:03:35] type of stuff all the time
[1:03:37] and here these things and and because of
[1:03:40] outlets
[1:03:42] right these things is coming right in
[1:03:44] our
[1:03:45] our homes and everything
[1:03:47] around us where where our youth is
[1:03:50] feeding on these things and becoming
[1:03:53] what they're feeding on so so it's
[1:03:56] important for us to give the people
[1:03:58] truth
[1:04:00] right
[1:04:01] see it's easy just to put
[1:04:04] preach some religious something that
[1:04:07] makes us feel i know how to make you
[1:04:09] feel good
[1:04:12] is that right
[1:04:13] but but what happens when when when we
[1:04:16] just preach uh uh really a religious
[1:04:19] thought
[1:04:20] go back to adam adam had a religious
[1:04:24] thought
[1:04:25] after the fall
[1:04:27] he put a lot of work in the fig leaves
[1:04:32] man he oh god could you imagine picking
[1:04:35] up them leaves and putting them together
[1:04:37] and and all of that
[1:04:39] that was something he did within himself
[1:04:41] and then when when he did all of that
[1:04:44] at the end of the day when god come down
[1:04:47] and was calling for him he realized wow

[1:06:06] holy ghost we can't wait we can't hardly
[1:06:09] wait and when we get here we might be
[1:06:12] down in our body but amen there's a
[1:06:15] jumping going on in our soul
[1:06:20] but but it's a jumping because of the
[1:06:22] world
[1:06:24] is that right
[1:06:25] oh hallelujah
[1:06:27] you know it's it's it's
[1:06:29] uh
[1:06:31] stimulation by revelation
[1:06:35] see i like singing
[1:06:37] right i like the clapping of a hand but
[1:06:40] give me the word
[1:06:42] let let something strike in my soul
[1:06:46] brother ain't gonna make me tear up a
[1:06:48] place
[1:06:52] man a message dropped down in my heart
[1:06:54] the other day
[1:06:55] and i had to pull over to the side of
[1:06:57] the road that was wednesday night too i
[1:06:59] was pulling over writing i ain't
[1:07:01] preaching i don't know when i'll preach
[1:07:02] it
[1:07:03] right and i was like that's the thing
[1:07:05] that stirs me
[1:07:07] see that's the thing keeps me
[1:07:10] amen when emotionally i'm a wreck
[1:07:17] emotionally i'm a wreck i've been on the
[1:07:20] wall with the devil
[1:07:23] and emotionally i don't know whether i'm
[1:07:25] coming to go
[1:07:28] but but it's it's the word it's it's
[1:07:32] true
[1:07:33] right
[1:07:35] we used to sing a song back in the day
[1:07:37] something deep inside of me
[1:07:40] y'all don't know about that telling me
[1:07:42] go ahead
[1:07:45] something deep inside of me
[1:07:49] [Music]
[1:07:50] well i think we got a few old times up
[1:07:52] in here
[1:07:53] something deep inside of me
[1:07:57] [Music]
[1:07:59] go ahead
[1:08:03] it's the word deep inside of me
[1:08:06] i'm feeling good now
[1:08:07] [Applause]
[1:08:09] see it it's got to be see
[1:08:12] you know when i started studying the
[1:08:14] word of god i realized
[1:08:17] man because he come down according to
[1:08:19] revelation 10 right with an open book
[1:08:24] right
[1:08:25] to give us truth
[1:08:27] to give us a godly to produce see this
[1:08:30] thing came to produce christians that's
[1:08:33] right
[1:08:34] if we go back to the book of acts see
[1:08:38] they didn't call them baptist methodists
[1:08:41] pentecostals they didn't call them
[1:08:43] branham night they call them none of
[1:08:45] these names that we got attached to us
[1:08:48] they saw the life of christ on display
[1:08:51] and said these people are
[1:08:54] christians
[1:08:57] is that right why because they realize
[1:09:00] that these people were influenced by
[1:09:02] christ
[1:09:04] and they see that same kind of nature
[1:09:06] same kind of life
[1:09:08] manifested
[1:09:11] last week um i met a pastor from
[1:09:13] tennessee and he got up and closed and
[1:09:15] he said you know what
[1:09:17] it's not my job to to defend the message
[1:09:21] it's my job to become the message
[1:09:24] when we become the message
[1:09:27] right
[1:09:28] it shuts the critic's mouth
[1:09:32] right
[1:09:32] see because the problem of god makes a
[1:09:34] statement he said we shouldn't jump no
[1:09:36] higher
[1:09:37] than we can live
[1:09:39] we can tear up a church but how how
[1:09:42] what's your life like is your life
[1:09:45] worthy of the gospel
[1:09:48] [Applause]
[1:09:49] well praise the lord
[1:09:51] i'm gonna preach to the lights
[1:09:56] let me stop a second i'm not saying this
[1:09:58] to be offensive
[1:10:00] or anything we're not trying to uh hurt
[1:10:03] anybody's feelings
[1:10:05] but if if if we have a perspective
[1:10:08] that's contrary to scripture then we
[1:10:10] have got to get
[1:10:12] get rid of that perspective is that
[1:10:14] right because that perspective will not
[1:10:16] bring or produce a change
[1:10:20] is that right it it will not
[1:10:23] and see the prophet
[1:10:24] he he he talks about he says in in the
[1:10:27] garden of eden
[1:10:29] uh god and the devil
[1:10:31] chose their parts of the man
[1:10:34] right the devil took his head god took
[1:10:36] his heart the devil tries to show him
[1:10:39] with mental powers
[1:10:41] some great thing he can do right
[1:10:44] this is this is a lot of of of our
[1:10:48] problems all of our problems right
[1:10:51] come on preach glory to god look at
[1:10:54] watch this now come on i'm gonna preach
[1:10:57] the bible now
[1:10:59] watch the problem that they had in the
[1:11:02] days of jesus
[1:11:04] it was mental powers yes
[1:11:08] they was intellectually yes
[1:11:11] uh uh uh following jesus
[1:11:15] and and because his ministry
[1:11:18] right was just so contrary yeah right
[1:11:22] it just it just produced a fight
[1:11:27] right it produced a struggle
[1:11:31] so much so that they said you know what
[1:11:33] give us
[1:11:35] give us barabbas
[1:11:37] they would they would rather take a
[1:11:39] murderer
[1:11:41] and and destroy the revealed work
[1:11:46] come on
[1:11:48] right right look at when when jesus's
[1:11:51] ministry culminated
[1:11:53] right after three and a half years they
[1:11:56] were so frustrated
[1:11:59] that amen they said give us barabbas
[1:12:04] they was willing to take a murderer
[1:12:07] over the reveal over life
[1:12:12] david they was willing to take a
[1:12:14] murderer
[1:12:15] and rejected life
[1:12:18] rejected light on the world amen
[1:12:24] we got to be careful
[1:12:26] right come on
[1:12:28] of what what we're willing to accept see
[1:12:31] i'm not willing to accept anything
[1:12:33] that's so contrary to the world
[1:12:36] come on
[1:12:37] spirits does not die
[1:12:41] right
[1:12:43] this is what uh
[1:12:44] william branham is alluding to
[1:12:47] right
[1:12:48] going all the way back to genesis
[1:12:51] and and picking it up right
[1:12:54] and bringing it all the way down to
[1:12:56] 2022.
[1:12:59] spirits do not die
[1:13:03] people die but spirits don't die did he
[1:13:06] say it or he did did he not say that
[1:13:09] right we understand that
[1:13:11] right every spirit from
[1:13:14] that time amen has been a amen
[1:13:18] brought all the way down through seven
[1:13:20] church ages
[1:13:23] and is here in this age we had a real
[1:13:25] war church
[1:13:28] right it's worse for these children
[1:13:31] it's worse for these children than it
[1:13:33] was for me amen in my day
[1:13:38] i thought it was bad in the 1980s when i
[1:13:41] supposedly had i graduated but it's 10
[1:13:44] times worse probably 20 times worse
[1:13:47] for these kids
[1:13:49] right
[1:13:51] because they're fighting against stuff
[1:13:54] we have no cell phones
[1:13:57] i ain't walking around with a devil in
[1:13:58] my pocket all day every day y'all don't
[1:14:00] talk to me somebody
[1:14:03] huh
[1:14:06] virginia we still had that thing on the
[1:14:08] wall that you used to have to
[1:14:12] y'all don't know nothing about that
[1:14:14] you got to at least be my age come on
[1:14:16] bro capers preach with me
[1:14:18] you know you
[1:14:19] and you had to wait for it to spin back
[1:14:24] and then we thought we were something
[1:14:26] when we got a little push button
[1:14:30] oh glory to god
[1:14:32] huh
[1:14:34] see if you like young like what in the
[1:14:36] world is he talking about yeah we used
[1:14:38] to have that little round down
[1:14:40] and you you wanted a six you put your
[1:14:42] hand in and you spin it and it had to
[1:14:44] spin back you had to wait on in a second
[1:14:46] or two and then you get your other
[1:14:48] numbers then boy
[1:14:50] oh boy when we start since the time when
[1:14:52] we got them cordless y'all all know what
[1:14:54] i'm talking about
[1:14:57] brother troy probably had his hat
[1:14:59] probably had his cordless talking to
[1:15:00] sister tanya when they was
[1:15:02] in the stages
[1:15:04] yes
[1:15:06] i just can't hardly wait
[1:15:08] huh
[1:15:12] and then they brought peoples and we
[1:15:13] thought we were something but we still
[1:15:14] had to run and find a paper a pay phone
[1:15:21] and then when and then then when they
[1:15:24] got cell phone we like we didn't arrived
[1:15:30] boy help me preach
[1:15:33] but but i'm not against the cell phone
[1:15:35] cause
[1:15:36] i ain't going nowhere without mine
[1:15:41] because there's so much access
[1:15:43] right
[1:15:45] but but it's it's the web that's on
[1:15:47] there
[1:15:48] and you need the baptism of the holy
[1:15:50] ghost
[1:15:52] i'm gonna say this and it's gonna be
[1:15:53] tightened y'all young people don't stone
[1:15:55] me when y'all get outside
[1:15:57] but y'all don't even need internet on
[1:15:59] your phones
[1:16:03] they need a phone well just give him a
[1:16:06] phone
[1:16:09] whatever
[1:16:12] because see
[1:16:13] you know you get when you get all this
[1:16:15] exposure
[1:16:17] parents can't monitor i'm teaching this
[1:16:19] morning
[1:16:21] they can't monitor because you can't be
[1:16:23] with your children all day every day
[1:16:26] but you got to try to to the best of
[1:16:28] your ability to limit the exposure
[1:16:31] [Music]
[1:16:32] but praise the lord
[1:16:34] i'm still moving how much time i got i'm
[1:16:37] still moving
[1:16:38] right sometimes you know you just got to
[1:16:41] drop these things we we got a lot of
[1:16:43] babies coming up in the church young
[1:16:45] folks having babies and and all of that
[1:16:47] you know they ain't gonna be babies
[1:16:49] always right my was babies and i thought
[1:16:52] we'd have been gone in the rapture we're
[1:16:54] still here and my youngest just turned
[1:16:55] 18. praise the lord
[1:17:02] but when justin was born we didn't have
[1:17:04] all of that stuff
[1:17:06] but now the kids they have access and
[1:17:09] and and the worst mistake that my mom
[1:17:11] made she said well you know i grew up a
[1:17:14] certain way and
[1:17:15] and and i just didn't want y'all to grow
[1:17:18] up that way so she gave us a lot of
[1:17:20] leeway
[1:17:22] don't do it
[1:17:24] i'ma give you i'm gonna give you a
[1:17:26] little bit of rope
[1:17:27] you mess that up i'm taking that little
[1:17:29] bit back you got to earn it well i'm
[1:17:31] going on somebody tell me going on
[1:17:35] i see
[1:17:36] i
[1:17:37] i am who i am
[1:17:39] you know i'ma get where i supposed to go
[1:17:41] i if not then you know it'll be another
[1:17:45] whenever we get up here we'll finish
[1:17:47] right but but it's these you know what
[1:17:50] church these things matter a lot
[1:17:53] because we we wonder why our kids are so
[1:17:57] so messed up in their mind it's it's
[1:18:01] a lot of times that little thing that
[1:18:03] they carry around in their pocket
[1:18:07] praise the lord
[1:18:09] amen
[1:18:11] but so he says uh
[1:18:14] the devil took his head great something
[1:18:17] he can do
[1:18:19] he only wants to see with his eyes what
[1:18:22] he can
[1:18:23] can see
[1:18:25] see
[1:18:26] man trying to out teach god
[1:18:29] right
[1:18:32] and god is the source of all true
[1:18:34] knowledge and wisdom right
[1:18:36] god come in his heart makes him believe
[1:18:39] the things that he can't see that's real
[1:18:41] faith
[1:18:43] for faith and successive things hope
[1:18:44] whatever this is things not yet seen he
[1:18:47] just believes it because god said it
[1:18:49] right
[1:18:51] he said because god said he don't have
[1:18:53] to do nothing or no
[1:18:56] his sister the body has to cut
[1:18:58] declared it he just believes it in his
[1:19:00] soul where god lives right
[1:19:04] he said but the devil took his head
[1:19:06] watched this statement this statement i
[1:19:08] want to get to
[1:19:09] makes him smart
[1:19:12] figure himself out
[1:19:14] a religion and a way impossible
[1:19:19] it's impossible
[1:19:21] how can we figure
[1:19:23] figure out ourselves
[1:19:25] a religion in a way apart from god
[1:19:30] who has the perspective
[1:19:33] right
[1:19:34] see this that was the problem that adam
[1:19:37] had when he tried
[1:19:38] he the prophet makes a statement he said
[1:19:41] adam couldn't wait
[1:19:43] after he had failed he couldn't wait he
[1:19:47] tried to do something within himself
[1:19:49] but he failed in it
[1:19:52] why because it took god to lead
[1:19:57] it
[1:19:58] takes god to
[1:20:00] leave
[1:20:02] do we believe that amen
[1:20:05] you cannot you cannot lead yourself
[1:20:09] right i was i was talking to brother
[1:20:11] price last weekend
[1:20:13] and and you know he he made a statement
[1:20:15] that i thought was really profound uh
[1:20:19] we we we're basically leading ourselves
[1:20:23] most often we're leading ourselves
[1:20:27] it's not god's leading
[1:20:30] i don't you know i don't have problems
[1:20:32] with a lot of things education and all
[1:20:34] of these types of things i really don't
[1:20:35] have a problem because you don't want to
[1:20:37] be illiterate we know it takes education
[1:20:40] but most often people don't try to find
[1:20:43] out what's god's leading
[1:20:46] right
[1:20:48] i'm not talking about the outside world
[1:20:49] i'm talking about people
[1:20:51] in church
[1:20:53] around church
[1:20:55] do we pray for god's will to be done in
[1:20:58] our lives or it's it's our own
[1:21:02] intellectual
[1:21:04] uh thinking
[1:21:06] our own way
[1:21:09] right and we try to make god's way and
[1:21:11] god's
[1:21:12] will coincide and it don't work
[1:21:17] it does not work
[1:21:19] it doesn't work like that
[1:21:21] right
[1:21:22] see
[1:21:23] we there's a there's a worldly caudal
[1:21:25] perspective
[1:21:27] right
[1:21:28] and and there's a perspective given to
[1:21:31] us by god
[1:21:33] there's a leading that amen because god
[1:21:36] wants to lead
[1:21:39] the problem that adam and eve had they
[1:21:42] shifted for themselves
[1:21:44] yeah right amen right
[1:21:47] see
[1:21:48] you know what when e when when the
[1:21:49] revelation came to eve why you couldn't
[1:21:52] you probably could have told eating
[1:21:53] nothing
[1:21:55] probably thought well i'm smart i got
[1:21:58] something that adam does not have
[1:22:01] i could have saw her head swell up
[1:22:05] when she brought that thing back to adam
[1:22:08] adam probably put it did one of these
[1:22:10] numbers lord have mercy
[1:22:13] what you gonna do
[1:22:14] do you like do you realize what you
[1:22:17] actually done
[1:22:19] right yeah stand it studied it started
[1:22:22] to quotes out
[1:22:23] right
[1:22:25] because because
[1:22:27] the serpent
[1:22:28] was subtle
[1:22:30] brother branham said he was a
[1:22:31] more probably handsomer guy and all of
[1:22:34] that
[1:22:36] probably made it sound good
[1:22:38] but it was dead
[1:22:41] right because it was hybriding
[1:22:45] the word
[1:22:46] with the intelligence amen of the
[1:22:49] serpent which the intelligence was
[1:22:52] coming from amen
[1:22:53] the devil
[1:22:55] right
[1:22:56] and see when you hybrid something it'll
[1:22:59] produce a bigger better crop
[1:23:06] it'll produce a bigger see sometimes we
[1:23:08] look at these big churches
[1:23:11] right
[1:23:13] and like be like my and see you know and
[1:23:16] sometimes they'll look at a little small
[1:23:18] church like this brother solomon
[1:23:20] and y'all show god with y'all
[1:23:26] y'all got 50
[1:23:29] and we got 50 000
[1:23:32] but you got 50 000 of what
[1:23:37] what do you have
[1:23:38] right do you have 50 000 christians on
[1:23:42] the word
[1:23:44] right
[1:23:46] from the baptism of the holy ghost to
[1:23:48] the right amen uh baptisms
[1:23:52] all the way up
[1:23:54] right right
[1:23:56] uh or do you have just religion
[1:24:01] a little covering something that that
[1:24:04] you know on sunday you don't feel so
[1:24:07] condemned for laying up in the bed just
[1:24:10] you know sleeping
[1:24:13] see
[1:24:14] we do not want to be religious
[1:24:21] right we don't want that that's what we
[1:24:24] do not want i hope it's all right
[1:24:27] if it's not y'all blame the pastor he
[1:24:30] told me to do it
[1:24:32] right
[1:24:33] but we do not want to be go back to all
[1:24:36] the days of our lives 1959 and read it
[1:24:39] we do not want to be religious
[1:24:43] right we want to be christians
[1:24:46] we do not want
[1:24:48] tradition everybody gearing up
[1:24:52] well y'all probably already got y'all
[1:24:54] easter suits ready
[1:24:57] easter dresses if you ain't got it
[1:24:59] you've been thinking about it
[1:25:01] well praise the lord somebody
[1:25:06] there's nothing wrong with that i'm just
[1:25:08] you know
[1:25:10] but that's not it
[1:25:12] right because see there'll be people
[1:25:14] brother solomon they'll go to church
[1:25:17] right
[1:25:18] and you might want to say merry
[1:25:19] christmas
[1:25:23] uh what's the next one mother's day
[1:25:25] happy mother's day
[1:25:28] right
[1:25:29] that suit polly or that dress probably
[1:25:31] won't be worn again to next year
[1:25:34] right
[1:25:35] so so we do not want to be
[1:25:38] be religious i'm i'm getting there i'm i
[1:25:40] ain't gonna hold y'all along this
[1:25:41] morning
[1:25:42] hey man we do not want to be religious
[1:25:45] right
[1:25:47] we we we do not
[1:25:49] see he said god wants to lead him in the
[1:25:51] path of worship and that's what it takes
[1:25:54] because when we look back to genesis it
[1:25:56] was god god coming down in the cool of
[1:25:59] the evening right
[1:26:01] and so adam quickly sowed fig leaves
[1:26:04] together not waiting on god
[1:26:06] think that's where we've made our
[1:26:08] mistake all along people don't wait on
[1:26:10] god
[1:26:11] if that was wrong in the beginning it's
[1:26:13] wrong now
[1:26:15] it will forever be wrong if god depends
[1:26:18] wholly upon complete
[1:26:20] surrender
[1:26:23] right
[1:26:24] to be led by the spirit at the beginning
[1:26:29] that's the way
[1:26:30] it'll have to be forever what
[1:26:34] okay let's stop a minute
[1:26:37] what's leading us
[1:26:42] just a question don't have to answer
[1:26:44] think about it when you when when you
[1:26:46] when you go home when you leave the
[1:26:47] service this morning
[1:26:48] what's leading us
[1:26:51] is it the spirit of god
[1:26:53] now i passed it 23 years i ain't just
[1:26:56] start doing this now
[1:26:59] right i ain't even intimidated this
[1:27:01] morning i just mess around sometime but
[1:27:03] i ain't intimidated i ain't i ain't even
[1:27:05] really afraid to hurt y'all feelings
[1:27:06] neither
[1:27:08] sister virginia know me
[1:27:10] very well but kevin knew they sat under
[1:27:13] me
[1:27:14] but i'm not trying to do that but i'm
[1:27:16] trying to get us a man in the hour that
[1:27:18] we're living in
[1:27:20] is it him leading
[1:27:25] or or is is it us leading us
[1:27:32] is it something that maybe brother jack
[1:27:34] said when you know and
[1:27:37] you know that we didn't like
[1:27:39] and then we started you know
[1:27:42] right we stopped following the guy
[1:27:46] come on
[1:27:48] right because soon as the pastor say
[1:27:50] something that's contrary to our leading
[1:27:53] we stop following man he ain't no man of
[1:27:55] god
[1:27:58] six weeks ago my pastor
[1:28:02] when he said when when he preached on
[1:28:05] from here to there
[1:28:06] oh we almost told this building down
[1:28:10] well i'm a total bill to die y'all don't
[1:28:11] preach with me up in here
[1:28:13] when he would breathe from it or die
[1:28:16] oh no we were
[1:28:20] we were spinning
[1:28:22] huh
[1:28:24] but the moment something said
[1:28:26] that's that's contrary to our ideology
[1:28:30] and our feeling and our intelligence and
[1:28:32] our thought
[1:28:36] bro jack boy i tell you boy
[1:28:38] bro troy
[1:28:40] and don't get me started on that brother
[1:28:42] smiling
[1:28:45] if it's the truth
[1:28:47] watch what brother jack's been preaching
[1:28:50] for weeks
[1:28:51] right the fivefold ministry has been
[1:28:53] given for the perfecting
[1:28:56] right
[1:28:58] see watch something here i'ma drop
[1:29:01] something right
[1:29:02] because because
[1:29:04] we we
[1:29:05] we we grow up
[1:29:08] a certain environments
[1:29:11] right
[1:29:12] certain cultures
[1:29:14] and and there's an ideology that's
[1:29:16] associated
[1:29:18] right
[1:29:20] you know we talked about growing up in
[1:29:22] the hood
[1:29:24] there there's concepts there's spirits
[1:29:27] things that's contrary to bible
[1:29:31] that's that's mindsets
[1:29:34] right
[1:29:35] and and and when we talk to our foes
[1:29:38] there's this things that they inject
[1:29:41] that we feed upon that's contrary to
[1:29:44] bible that's why you shouldn't talk to
[1:29:46] everybody
[1:29:48] about your problems
[1:29:51] because there's a lot of times people
[1:29:53] aren't going to give you a biblical
[1:29:55] response
[1:29:58] i want to talk to you
[1:30:01] what what god girl
[1:30:06] if i was you
[1:30:09] if i was you i'd run
[1:30:11] because they are not going to give you
[1:30:14] something amen that's biblically sound
[1:30:18] is that right come on it takes a
[1:30:20] spiritual insight into the word of god
[1:30:24] amen
[1:30:25] see
[1:30:25] there's many things that i can look back
[1:30:28] to
[1:30:29] that i still to this day got to fight
[1:30:32] because i grew up in what they call not
[1:30:34] a rock
[1:30:36] huh i grew up all over west palm beach
[1:30:39] and riviera beach
[1:30:40] if i didn't grow up i hung out
[1:30:44] but there was concepts and mentalities
[1:30:46] that i still have to amen push down
[1:30:51] right
[1:30:53] come on
[1:30:54] come on
[1:30:56] and and through you know maybe sometimes
[1:30:58] what we go through and what we fight
[1:31:00] right
[1:31:01] you it's it's a battle to stay with
[1:31:03] truth
[1:31:06] right
[1:31:07] hey man y'all know what i'm talking
[1:31:08] about
[1:31:09] let your husband and wife get into an
[1:31:11] argument
[1:31:12] then you'll find out what i'm talking
[1:31:13] about
[1:31:15] oh glory to god
[1:31:18] right
[1:31:19] because if you don't have truth you just
[1:31:22] got religion you're gonna have some
[1:31:23] problems some real problems
[1:31:25] because it's gonna take it's gonna take
[1:31:28] amen truth in the midst of a marriage to
[1:31:30] keep two people together
[1:31:34] come on amen
[1:31:36] you're gonna take biblical truth in the
[1:31:39] midst of a marriage because the devil
[1:31:41] fights marriages well i'm in the message
[1:31:44] all right
[1:31:46] all right you better get a better
[1:31:47] perspective than that
[1:31:49] the message better be in you
[1:31:52] come on
[1:31:54] right because normally opposites attract
[1:31:58] i'm different than my wife
[1:32:02] i ain't gonna go there cause y'all gonna
[1:32:03] get nervous lord have mercy i already
[1:32:05] felt that
[1:32:06] i already felt that i'm gonna leave that
[1:32:08] alone
[1:32:10] y'all think i'm crazy don't y'all
[1:32:14] huh i preach i preach in general
[1:32:17] right but the devil fights the devil
[1:32:19] fights all marriages
[1:32:22] no matter how long
[1:32:24] you've been married
[1:32:27] right glory to god
[1:32:29] glory to god
[1:32:31] and it takes a man truth to keep
[1:32:35] a man some peace in the valley
[1:32:41] because she they have she has her
[1:32:43] opinions her thoughts you have your
[1:32:46] opinions as a male
[1:32:48] right come on
[1:32:50] come on
[1:32:53] yeah we do
[1:32:54] yeah we do
[1:32:57] yeah
[1:32:58] as a male we figure
[1:33:01] got to go this way gotta go that way and
[1:33:03] she look like a little sub buster
[1:33:07] and don't let them be bringing in no
[1:33:08] coins
[1:33:10] well praise the louder
[1:33:13] they're loud
[1:33:17] don't let her be making more money than
[1:33:19] you
[1:33:28] a little bit more education
[1:33:32] let me tell you something i ain't
[1:33:33] intimidated by how smart folks are no
[1:33:37] time right
[1:33:39] because you can be intellectually smart
[1:33:41] and not worldly smart
[1:33:44] that's right that's right and that might
[1:33:46] be good to help you to keep your your
[1:33:48] bank books balanced but that that might
[1:33:51] not help you amen to navigate a man
[1:33:53] through through life
[1:33:56] and pick up
[1:33:58] certain things i thank god amen you know
[1:34:01] for my experiences and the word though
[1:34:06] the word that's right i'm weird because
[1:34:08] i look at most everything by the word
[1:34:14] right
[1:34:15] when people rejoice in having a big time
[1:34:17] smelling out things
[1:34:19] i'd be pondering it
[1:34:22] i don't know about that one
[1:34:26] right
[1:34:28] and everybody jumping around about this
[1:34:30] and now you'll be like
[1:34:33] okay
[1:34:34] maybe lord i need you to help me on that
[1:34:36] one
[1:34:37] but i i learned to keep my mouth closed
[1:34:39] about a lot of things though
[1:34:42] come on y'all all right
[1:34:44] i ain't got about 10 15 more minutes
[1:34:47] right
[1:34:48] this ain't going away i i preached it
[1:34:50] last week different
[1:34:53] right
[1:34:54] but but it's a lot it's a lot for us to
[1:34:57] chew on
[1:34:59] right
[1:35:00] uh i was i was talking i was talking to
[1:35:02] brother jack about something a couple of
[1:35:04] weeks ago and um
[1:35:07] i was saying how surface
[1:35:10] how surface i feel that we are around
[1:35:12] christendom
[1:35:14] and and there's a there's a lot
[1:35:17] that that needs to be
[1:35:19] that needs to be taught
[1:35:21] outside of certain
[1:35:23] or our favorite doctrines
[1:35:27] because because
[1:35:29] you know we you you start looking at you
[1:35:31] start looking at the young generation
[1:35:34] right
[1:35:36] uh and you just kind of have to ask
[1:35:38] yourself the question where do young
[1:35:40] where do young people
[1:35:41] yeah where where the family's at
[1:35:45] right
[1:35:47] and what what i find is happening we get
[1:35:50] caught up and we've been caught up for
[1:35:52] the last i've been a christian since
[1:35:54] 1988
[1:35:56] and and trying to prove this and trying
[1:35:58] to prove that
[1:35:59] and there's so much lacking
[1:36:02] when when i got married
[1:36:04] man
[1:36:05] i mean it's it's it's on the job
[1:36:07] training but uh
[1:36:10] there's got to be still things that
[1:36:13] you know uh on our foundation that that
[1:36:16] we need to know
[1:36:18] i was sharing and brother jack was
[1:36:20] saying we need to bring
[1:36:22] the marriage seminars to this area
[1:36:27] right because you you finding
[1:36:30] uh because of a lack of truth yeah we
[1:36:34] got excitement we dancing
[1:36:37] right
[1:36:38] but
[1:36:39] our foundation is shaky
[1:36:43] then we we're limited in so many areas
[1:36:48] right when we got married we didn't know
[1:36:50] we didn't know nothing
[1:36:52] right we just you know
[1:36:57] saw somebody and felt like this was our
[1:36:59] wife and
[1:37:00] man we went to our dad trembling and
[1:37:03] shaking we went to the pastor and we got
[1:37:06] it worked out and we got down the island
[1:37:08] when we got in and after the honeymoon
[1:37:10] see
[1:37:12] brother
[1:37:13] that's not much of nothing i mean that
[1:37:15] is something you got to go that route
[1:37:16] but that's just the beginning stage is
[1:37:19] nice white boy i'm gonna tell you
[1:37:20] something i was clean on my wedding day
[1:37:23] what
[1:37:25] my wife was looking good we was in all
[1:37:27] white
[1:37:29] while my groom went right troy
[1:37:32] woo
[1:37:36] what
[1:37:40] yeah we all smaller we all slim
[1:37:45] i might have been brother t size back
[1:37:48] then
[1:37:49] man look at me now
[1:37:51] i'm ready for the defensive linemen or
[1:37:54] something
[1:37:56] people look at me and now say boy you
[1:37:58] playing football i said no i wasn't this
[1:38:00] big back then i played basketball back
[1:38:03] in the days
[1:38:04] when i was telling troy today i said man
[1:38:06] we were young well we we thought you was
[1:38:09] fat or whatever but bad you were slim
[1:38:13] compared to them days but you know we we
[1:38:17] grinned and we laughed and we had a good
[1:38:19] time
[1:38:20] but but then but then when we come back
[1:38:22] out for the honeymoon and we start
[1:38:24] trying to make a life
[1:38:26] all right
[1:38:28] right we did not have the information
[1:38:32] that's right come here y'all don't talk
[1:38:33] to him now
[1:38:34] we did not have the information and and
[1:38:38] and when when problems come
[1:38:41] people do not have the information
[1:38:46] right that's right and it's our job in
[1:38:49] ministry
[1:38:51] to be informative
[1:38:56] come on we have we have first got to be
[1:39:00] equipped
[1:39:02] in order to equip them
[1:39:06] for the challenges that they will face
[1:39:11] i don't care if you're a preacher deacon
[1:39:14] all the pastor the preacher what that
[1:39:17] means they get fought the most
[1:39:22] huh
[1:39:23] you have got to have the information
[1:39:26] you've got to have truth that's why amen
[1:39:30] we got to peel back the layers
[1:39:32] [Music]
[1:39:34] and make this thing holistic
[1:39:39] not just one perspective
[1:39:41] not just god sending a prophet
[1:39:45] but showing us how to be men showing how
[1:39:48] to be women somebody said uh i heard
[1:39:52] somebody saying this the average young

[1:44:40] because it's a lot man
[1:44:42] it'll help us it'll help us through the
[1:44:44] hard times that will come because the
[1:44:47] guns of the devil is aimed at us
[1:44:50] right this is not a picnic
[1:44:53] right
[1:44:54] amen you
[1:44:55] you want everything to see victory in
[1:44:58] homes
[1:44:59] see
[1:45:00] if we got victories in homes we'll have
[1:45:03] a victorious church
[1:45:05] but but when we got young couples
[1:45:08] struggling
[1:45:09] the church gonna struggle
[1:45:12] because because we what's happening is
[1:45:14] we got no balance and so we got to try
[1:45:16] to manufacture something i know what i'm
[1:45:19] talking about church
[1:45:20] the bible said because a house divided
[1:45:22] against itself can't stand that's right
[1:45:25] right
[1:45:26] you gotta see because we gotta come back
[1:45:28] to a oneness
[1:45:30] yes
[1:45:31] right
[1:45:33] oh loud
[1:45:36] i'll tell you what
[1:45:38] this is the day you know
[1:45:40] where people rather we'll we'll rather
[1:45:42] have religion
[1:45:44] right
[1:45:45] and and live kind of like we won't
[1:45:49] do what we want
[1:45:51] right
[1:45:52] but you won't make it into heaven like
[1:45:54] that
[1:45:56] right we we got ministry got we got the
[1:45:59] gospel so watered down
[1:46:02] it's no life
[1:46:04] right
[1:46:05] people
[1:46:06] man when i was growing up you you just
[1:46:08] didn't live any kind of life
[1:46:11] right we we know the pentecostal church
[1:46:14] was was the highest form of
[1:46:18] restoration after the word had fallen
[1:46:21] and now i see her
[1:46:23] right and god started reforming through
[1:46:26] luther that's true and then wesley
[1:46:29] and pentecost has had the restoration of
[1:46:31] the gifts with a great revival
[1:46:35] with a great revival
[1:46:37] but they still lack the word
[1:46:41] the fullness
[1:46:43] the full perspective of god
[1:46:47] oh yeah bodies was getting healed
[1:46:50] right
[1:46:50] people people were
[1:46:53] profit line and
[1:46:55] everything else but
[1:46:58] uh
[1:46:58] manufacturing gifts
[1:47:01] producing creeds and
[1:47:03] doctrines off
[1:47:05] right right and no fellowship
[1:47:08] listen let me say something that's
[1:47:09] really profound to me
[1:47:11] if the water has risen
[1:47:14] why is our attitude the way that it is
[1:47:17] because when the water rises the duck's
[1:47:19] supposed to get out and be able to
[1:47:22] fellowship
[1:47:27] right amen
[1:47:28] but but a lot of times just just look at
[1:47:30] us and our attitudes well we're in the
[1:47:32] message and they did they that
[1:47:34] that that really go back and study what
[1:47:37] brother branham tried to teach
[1:47:39] he did not try to produce amen another
[1:47:42] denomination he was bringing us back to
[1:47:46] amen the original word
[1:47:49] the original
[1:47:51] not denomination but the original
[1:47:54] experiences the original pentecost
[1:47:58] right
[1:47:59] trying to get us in position to go back
[1:48:01] to eden
[1:48:03] back to eternal life with eternal bodies
[1:48:08] right
[1:48:09] this one this is why we had to do away
[1:48:12] from
[1:48:12] just
[1:48:13] religion
[1:48:17] in this hour that we're living in i
[1:48:18] don't want to be religious
[1:48:21] i don't i don't want to approach this
[1:48:22] thing religiously i'm in the message
[1:48:26] nah nah it's got to be deeper than that
[1:48:29] this thing has got to be alive in me
[1:48:32] right because man should not live by
[1:48:34] bread alone let the musicians make their
[1:48:36] way up but by every word that proceeded
[1:48:39] out of the mouthful god
[1:48:41] it's got church has got to be
[1:48:44] every word as much as i i enjoy
[1:48:47] excitement like this morning they were
[1:48:49] feeling good
[1:48:50] i thought brother troy was gonna lift
[1:48:52] off up in here
[1:48:55] huh
[1:48:56] but i realized i you know what i might
[1:48:59] lift off for a minute but i got to come
[1:49:01] back down and when i come back down
[1:49:03] uh
[1:49:04] what i fed upon is it is it enough to
[1:49:08] sustain me
[1:49:10] yes
[1:49:13] yes
[1:49:14] let me change some church i wouldn't be
[1:49:16] here if it wasn't for truth
[1:49:19] amen
[1:49:20] [Applause]
[1:49:23] i'll say that again
[1:49:26] i would not be here this morning
[1:49:29] standing in this pulpit if it wasn't for
[1:49:33] truth
