[19:27] and uh and we we would
[19:30] go to service on a sunday morning
[19:32] and there would be time during the
[19:33] service that we would sing
[19:35] amen one of these uh just
[19:38] old hymns

[1:07:33] but uh we appreciate the lord we
[1:07:34] appreciate this opportunity
[1:07:36] amen to be here this morning
[1:07:39] and you continue to pray for us we
[1:07:41] starting to get started out in the field
[1:07:44] and uh
[1:07:45] last week i'm gonna tell you we had
[1:07:47] church
[1:07:49] we didn't have church we had church
[1:07:52] the building was on fire
[1:07:55] so we we pray this morning that y'all
[1:07:57] didn't come to sit and stay and look at
[1:07:59] me
[1:08:00] but that y'all come to pull on the word
[1:08:02] of god because it's not about me
[1:08:04] amen you know a brother brandon makes a
[1:08:06] statement he said we get out of what we
[1:08:08] put into it
[1:08:10] now uh he also makes a statement that we
[1:08:13] don't pack no revival in our briefcase
[1:08:17] if you ain't in no revival
[1:08:19] no matter how much i can be in a revival
[1:08:22] it's not going to help you you got to be
[1:08:24] in your own personal revival
[1:08:26] it's got to be a personal revelation of
[1:08:28] jesus christ because that's the new
[1:08:30] birth
[1:08:32] right so we we're looking at um psalms
[1:08:34] 111 now we preached on this a couple of
[1:08:37] weeks ago but uh the generation of the
[1:08:40] upright part two
[1:08:42] and we'll see how far we can get but we
[1:08:44] we want to start at psalms 111 and then
[1:08:47] want to read a portion of psalms 112
[1:08:49] because
[1:08:50] both of those scriptures are connected
[1:08:53] it says praise ye the lord i will praise
[1:08:55] the lord with my whole heart in the
[1:08:57] assembly of the upright
[1:08:59] and in the congregation the works of the
[1:09:01] lord are great sought out of all them
[1:09:04] that have pleasure the end
[1:09:06] his work is honorable and
[1:09:09] glorious and his righteousness
[1:09:11] and do it forever
[1:09:14] he has made his
[1:09:16] wonderful works to be remembered
[1:09:19] the lord is gracious and full of
[1:09:21] compassion he has given meat unto them
[1:09:24] that fear him
[1:09:25] he will
[1:09:27] ever be mindful of his covenants he has
[1:09:30] showed his people the power of his works
[1:09:33] that he may
[1:09:34] give them the heritage of the heathen
[1:09:37] the works of his hands are verity
[1:09:41] and judgment and all his commandments
[1:09:43] are sure
[1:09:45] they stand fast forever and ever and are
[1:09:48] done in truth and up righteousness
[1:09:51] uh he sent redemption unto his people he
[1:09:54] has
[1:09:55] commanded his covenant forever holy and
[1:09:59] reverend is his name the fear of the
[1:10:01] lord
[1:10:03] is the beginning of wisdom a good
[1:10:05] understanding have all they that do his
[1:10:08] commandments his praise and do it
[1:10:11] forever now let's go to psalms 112 it
[1:10:14] says praise you the lord blessed are the
[1:10:16] man that feareth the lord that
[1:10:19] delighteth greatly in his commandments
[1:10:21] his seed shall be mighty upon the earth
[1:10:24] the generation of upright shall be
[1:10:27] blessed
[1:10:28] wealth and riches shall be in his house
[1:10:32] and his righteousness endure forever
[1:10:35] unto the upright there arises light in
[1:10:37] darkness
[1:10:39] he is gracious and full of compassion
[1:10:41] and righteousness amen may the lord have
[1:10:44] a blessing to his word this morning you
[1:10:46] may be seated
[1:10:48] um
[1:10:50] like we say our title this morning is
[1:10:52] the gender generation of of the upright
[1:10:55] and uh
[1:10:57] the last time and i maybe just want to
[1:10:59] kind of lay a foundation and build
[1:11:02] uh just just for a moment is some things
[1:11:04] that
[1:11:05] we we tried to bring out that uh i feel
[1:11:08] i felt inspired by the holy spirit as we
[1:11:12] were studying
[1:11:14] um
[1:11:15] on this subject to try to get bring us
[1:11:18] to an understanding last week i pray
[1:11:20] preached the same subject in orlando and
[1:11:23] and after the service one of the uh
[1:11:25] minister brothers because i i got to
[1:11:28] talking about and i'll probably briefly
[1:11:30] uh talk about that a little bit this
[1:11:32] morning also as we go along
[1:11:35] about this this uh this millennial
[1:11:38] generation
[1:11:40] uh
[1:11:41] and one one of the things that that we
[1:11:44] and you know i don't try to say things
[1:11:46] to
[1:11:46] to be harsh or anything but we we gotta
[1:11:50] have truth right
[1:11:52] right we gotta identify things for
[1:11:55] uh the people of god that's just a part
[1:11:58] of of of
[1:11:59] why the ministry is called he's giving
[1:12:02] us a five-fold ministry for the
[1:12:04] perfecting of the state saints and and
[1:12:07] and you know uh uh
[1:12:10] we need light on the word of god
[1:12:13] right because you you'll never rapture
[1:12:15] in in error
[1:12:17] you're gonna get a witness
[1:12:19] you'll never rapture an error and and
[1:12:22] there's so many things that that that we
[1:12:24] see uh
[1:12:26] and and folk don't like you to talk
[1:12:28] about nothing we we want us to come to
[1:12:30] church and hear good good sermons to
[1:12:33] make us feel good and church be good and
[1:12:36] and blessings and we'll tell building
[1:12:38] down on those types of things
[1:12:41] but uh uh
[1:12:43] we we realize that as long as you're in
[1:12:47] error you'll never have faith to be
[1:12:50] translated in a moment of a twinkling of
[1:12:53] an eye is that right because one of the
[1:12:55] things that we we find in studying
[1:12:58] scripture
[1:12:59] god never started out an error
[1:13:02] god never produced error right error
[1:13:05] error was pro produced by satan
[1:13:09] is that right amen god i'll say that
[1:13:12] again god never produced error error
[1:13:16] does not come from god
[1:13:18] error comes by amen disbelief all right
[1:13:23] is that right if if we go back to
[1:13:25] genesis
[1:13:26] this is what we find god amen establish
[1:13:30] a church he established a family in
[1:13:34] truth
[1:13:35] and righteousness
[1:13:37] is that right amen and and see the
[1:13:40] principles of god can't change because
[1:13:44] we're in the layout of sin it in aids
[1:13:47] now we can say we we just because of
[1:13:49] thought we we've been elevated into the
[1:13:52] bright age
[1:13:53] but everybody has not been elevated
[1:13:56] there's still some people now now i'll
[1:13:58] say this it's still layout of seeing
[1:14:01] conditions that we're battling exactly
[1:14:03] this is the age where folks are blind
[1:14:05] wretched and naked and don't even know
[1:14:08] it
[1:14:09] that's the sad part about it to be blind
[1:14:12] wretched and naked and do not even know
[1:14:15] it right
[1:14:17] boy i feel uh help us help us
[1:14:20] so so we we we
[1:14:23] this is just the way that i think right
[1:14:26] and and all of us are different as
[1:14:27] ministers and and i just learned in
[1:14:30] studying amen the seventh angel to
[1:14:33] follow amen types and shadows and
[1:14:36] patterns
[1:14:38] right
[1:14:39] amen because these things reveal christ
[1:14:44] it shows us what was in god's mind
[1:14:48] it shows us the the intentions of god
[1:14:51] from the very beginning
[1:14:54] right glory to his wonderful name from
[1:14:56] the very beginning um we find the
[1:15:00] intentions on god now it might go a
[1:15:02] little different i don't know
[1:15:04] but but i feel good this morning
[1:15:07] and i hope y'all are right right now
[1:15:10] watch
[1:15:11] a statement in uh god's provided
[1:15:13] approach to divine fellowship matthew 6
[1:15:16] he said god loves to fellowship with his
[1:15:18] creation
[1:15:20] in the garden of eden we are told that
[1:15:24] when man watch this walk in the
[1:15:27] uprightness of god
[1:15:30] right
[1:15:31] in the uprightness of god god came down
[1:15:35] in the cool of the evening in fellowship
[1:15:37] with his children
[1:15:39] right and then one day there was a voice
[1:15:43] came up in the presence of god and said
[1:15:45] those your loved ones your children has
[1:15:48] fallen but in the beginning
[1:15:51] right in the beginning the children of
[1:15:54] god walked in the uprightness of god
[1:15:58] and so and then we also we read a quote
[1:16:02] where the prophet he was talking about
[1:16:03] time
[1:16:04] and how how the earth stood upright
[1:16:10] it stood upright but he said sin
[1:16:14] right sin brought judgment and judgment
[1:16:18] caused the earth to tilt
[1:16:20] all right
[1:16:21] right it caused the earth but the
[1:16:23] original plan of god because precepts
[1:16:27] has to run the same down through
[1:16:29] scripture
[1:16:30] he said i'm god and i don't change
[1:16:33] that right
[1:16:34] glory to his wonderful name so so
[1:16:37] the world tilts it but see this is why i
[1:16:41] thank god for redemption
[1:16:44] right because we we were born in sin
[1:16:48] right
[1:16:49] glory to god
[1:16:51] uh uh now i'ma say it like he said it
[1:16:54] because i know it's two scriptures but
[1:16:55] it means the same same thing and
[1:16:57] iniquity we're covering the world
[1:16:58] speaking life we were liars
[1:17:01] is that right glory to god now i know
[1:17:03] that's two scriptures and and i i don't
[1:17:05] have time to go pull them out and read
[1:17:07] them but i i'll give it to you the way
[1:17:09] that i've always heard it
[1:17:11] i know i'm standing there now
[1:17:14] i got my computer back there y'all need
[1:17:16] y'all need some help
[1:17:18] my phone in the car go get that too and
[1:17:20] look it up
[1:17:22] right
[1:17:23] cause folk get folks get calm
[1:17:28] amen but but then what redemption has
[1:17:32] done for me
[1:17:33] when i came to the world tilted
[1:17:36] opposite of the thoughts of god
[1:17:40] right opposite of the thoughts of god
[1:17:43] right
[1:17:44] but but one thing about god god had a
[1:17:47] plan
[1:17:49] before the foundations of the world
[1:17:53] right
[1:17:54] this book is the plan of redemption
[1:17:58] it was written before the foundations of
[1:18:01] the world
[1:18:03] right my name was there yes my picture
[1:18:07] was in the family album before the
[1:18:10] foundation of the world god took a
[1:18:13] picture of me
[1:18:14] knowing that i would be there
[1:18:17] knowing knowing that you know he would
[1:18:19] straighten me up yes
[1:18:24] knowing what day i would come in what
[1:18:26] dispensation that i would live in
[1:18:29] knowing what light of the day amen that
[1:18:31] i would fall under knowing that i would
[1:18:34] agree with the precepts of god
[1:18:37] god being sovereign took a picture of me
[1:18:41] [Music]
[1:18:44] hallelujah
[1:18:46] if he didn't i wouldn't be here and you
[1:18:48] wouldn't either
[1:18:51] see
[1:18:52] we all were tempted amen
[1:18:54] i know we like to talk about one another
[1:18:57] and we talk about this and this we were
[1:19:00] all tilted
[1:19:03] we were all jacked up
[1:19:05] but god
[1:19:08] but god i know some of y'all might be
[1:19:10] smarter than me may have more money than
[1:19:12] me and all of that
[1:19:14] but you ain't no better than me
[1:19:17] we got on the same road this morning
[1:19:20] spiritually speaking
[1:19:23] come on
[1:19:24] when we get to the wedding you ain't
[1:19:27] gonna have on a different robe than
[1:19:28] brother smiley
[1:19:32] y'all know the preacher i hope y'all
[1:19:33] study
[1:19:35] i ain't got time to try to explain it
[1:19:36] all to you this morning
[1:19:38] right so so no matter how how well you
[1:19:42] speak and all that that don't mean that
[1:19:44] we got to say if you got the baptism by
[1:19:46] the holy ghost you got the same robon
[1:19:50] that i got on you got the thing on
[1:19:52] that'll get you in the glory
[1:19:55] your education ain't gonna get you the
[1:19:57] glory
[1:19:58] your status ain't gonna get you in the
[1:20:00] glory your money ain't gonna get you in
[1:20:02] the glory
[1:20:03] [Applause]
[1:20:06] but the new birth will get you there
[1:20:09] you must be born again
[1:20:12] very very i say joining church won't do
[1:20:16] it
[1:20:18] being identified with a preacher or a
[1:20:20] church
[1:20:21] will not do it you must be born again
[1:20:26] is that right i'm glad for the new birth
[1:20:29] i'm glad that this church brother jack's
[1:20:30] still preaching the new birth
[1:20:33] still preaching new birth we still
[1:20:34] preach the new birth around here
[1:20:37] you must be you must be born again
[1:20:41] huh you must be born again it's
[1:20:44] imperative
[1:20:45] i shook the preacher hand ain't nothing
[1:20:47] in my hand
[1:20:49] [Applause]
[1:20:51] nothing in it
[1:20:53] glory to god
[1:20:55] these veins can't get you in the glory
[1:20:57] that's in my head
[1:21:02] but the new birth the new birth uh i'll
[1:21:04] get you there
[1:21:06] right
[1:21:08] a couple of things right he says um
[1:21:12] knowing who we are is important
[1:21:15] right
[1:21:15] and and like i say i don't i don't want
[1:21:17] to pick on anybody but to me that's
[1:21:19] important right
[1:21:21] because we we we got to have an absolute
[1:21:24] we we got to have something that we're
[1:21:26] tied to and i was saying this last week
[1:21:30] and it's it's people that i know people
[1:21:32] people that i've watched grow up in
[1:21:34] church it's good to see these young
[1:21:35] fellas now i remember these young
[1:21:37] fellows when they were little fellas
[1:21:40] now they now they got beards and
[1:21:42] everything more hair on their chin than
[1:21:44] me
[1:21:46] but i remember when they were little
[1:21:48] fellas coming up in church
[1:21:51] right glory to god but they must have an
[1:21:54] absolute
[1:21:55] they must have something that they're
[1:21:57] tied to
[1:21:58] something that reveals to them who they
[1:22:01] are glory
[1:22:03] right glory to god glory to god i know
[1:22:06] i'll probably make y'all mad when i say
[1:22:07] certain things but it's
[1:22:09] y'all gonna be all right
[1:22:11] that'll be all right
[1:22:14] glory to god cause cause i've watched
[1:22:16] things over the years yeah yeah right
[1:22:19] and and and because of the revelation of
[1:22:22] the word of god i don't be moved by
[1:22:25] those things
[1:22:26] see we can have all these emotions and
[1:22:29] all of these fits but but if we don't
[1:22:32] get up and accept what he's already done
[1:22:36] and move
[1:22:37] the revelation of what he's already done
[1:22:39] and they ain't going to do you no good
[1:22:41] i look man many times we back in the old
[1:22:43] days we cried we went to conventions man

[1:22:52] and when we came back we didn't have a
[1:22:54] clue of who we was in the spirit by the
[1:22:56] word

[1:23:02] and and at the end of the day we didn't
[1:23:04] even know who we were we didn't even
[1:23:06] know what we believed
[1:23:08] all right
[1:23:09] we didn't know what we were standing for
[1:23:12] that ain't the case this morning

[1:23:31] we worked together she asked me a
[1:23:33] biblical question i just looked at her
[1:23:35] right
[1:23:36] but we shouted over that revelation
[1:23:39] we screamed over that revelation but
[1:23:42] didn't understand right
[1:23:44] but we understand now
[1:23:46] right brother browner makes the
[1:23:48] statement he say you're gonna understand
[1:23:49] it and the bible say he'll open up to
[1:23:52] your understanding to the scripture
[1:23:54] thank god for understanding why
[1:23:57] because it's this understanding of the
[1:23:59] word of god that's become my absolute
[1:24:04] amen
[1:24:05] right
[1:24:07] some something that i realize i'm tied
[1:24:09] to
[1:24:10] something that i realized that it keeps
[1:24:13] me
[1:24:14] it keeps me when my flesh don't want to
[1:24:16] be killed
[1:24:19] when my flesh want to clown and cut up
[1:24:21] and say i got you buddy
[1:24:24] i got you you ain't going nowhere
[1:24:27] right

[1:25:04] oh hallelujah so knowing who we are and
[1:25:08] and knowing what we are part of
[1:25:11] right glory to god we gotta because
[1:25:15] things is constantly changing
[1:25:17] and one of the things that paul taught
[1:25:19] in the book of ephesians he said
[1:25:22] he wanted the people to be be anchored
[1:25:24] and not tossed to and fro with every
[1:25:27] wind and doctrine it's like and brother
[1:25:29] jack covered that
[1:25:30] right
[1:25:31] amen people that's anointed all right
[1:25:35] see
[1:25:35] just let me i'll say this the serpent
[1:25:38] was up upright
[1:25:43] he was anointed
[1:25:45] by the enemy he even had a place for us
[1:25:48] so he didn't have a soul
[1:25:50] i know we put him some of the pictures
[1:25:52] and the thoughts of man is like that's
[1:25:54] connor
[1:25:55] because he was upright
[1:25:58] he was he was close to humanity
[1:26:02] right
[1:26:03] he could speak he could say he could
[1:26:06] reason
[1:26:09] right not that's it it was it was it was
[1:26:14] the judgment
[1:26:16] that that put him down there but right
[1:26:20] it wasn't so from the beginning
[1:26:23] see
[1:26:24] the serpentine was stood up right
[1:26:27] huh
[1:26:28] glory to god amen
[1:26:31] oh hallelujah so so uh uh
[1:26:35] he says uh we gotta know what we are
[1:26:37] part of what's promised and what's
[1:26:40] important in scripture to god
[1:26:44] not your thinking not your opinions
[1:26:47] those things have caused you to stand at
[1:26:49] the day of judgment and give an account
[1:26:52] right it's it's god's plan yeah you know
[1:26:56] when adam and eve fell
[1:26:58] uh and we often say this adam adam tried
[1:27:02] in his own perspective
[1:27:05] to uh do something that would bring him
[1:27:09] back to
[1:27:10] his original state
[1:27:12] right where he could find himself in the
[1:27:15] presence of god and then then he
[1:27:17] realized uh this ain't working
[1:27:19] this ain't gone when when he heard the
[1:27:21] voice of god coming down in the cold of
[1:27:23] the evening he realized i ain't not
[1:27:25] right no more all right
[1:27:28] something that something that went wrong
[1:27:30] here
[1:27:32] because because he could see eve for who
[1:27:34] she was
[1:27:36] right come on
[1:27:37] jack just covered this now
[1:27:39] right he realized you know what
[1:27:42] where there was a spiritual
[1:27:44] veil over her eyes right there was a
[1:27:48] veil there where he could look in that
[1:27:50] lust
[1:27:52] now because unbelievable unbelief came
[1:27:56] in
[1:27:56] right
[1:27:57] he no longer could and not lust
[1:28:01] [Music]
[1:28:04] we got to thank god for the holy ghost
[1:28:06] church
[1:28:07] come on
[1:28:09] come on i know sometimes men think well
[1:28:11] i praise the lord i'm holy
[1:28:13] all right
[1:28:14] okay you let the devil fool you with
[1:28:16] that one if you wanna even the prophet
[1:28:18] had to put a cross in his car
[1:28:22] right cause he still had feelings
[1:28:25] sometimes you listen to tapes and hear
[1:28:27] how he describes women
[1:28:31] not like somebody with blind zone
[1:28:34] oh y'all gotta talk to me up in here
[1:28:37] hallelujah glory to god thank you jesus
[1:28:40] and all of that stuff huh he described
[1:28:43] her she's beautiful she's well built
[1:28:46] what that huh
[1:28:48] yes yes he was he was a man
[1:28:51] glory to god he wasn't trying to you
[1:28:54] know that's why he put that cross there
[1:28:57] huh
[1:28:57] oh
[1:29:00] we might need to put some crosses in our
[1:29:02] car all right horses on our glasses
[1:29:06] [Applause]
[1:29:07] brother brothers
[1:29:12] so i could see it
[1:29:14] so i could see it because these women
[1:29:16] have naked right here
[1:29:21] i'm going somewhere this morning
[1:29:25] uh
[1:29:26] a lot of times people don't
[1:29:28] don't seem to agree with that last
[1:29:30] statement um what's important to god
[1:29:33] according to this scripture
[1:29:35] it's like we we're living in the age
[1:29:38] where
[1:29:40] uh pretty much everything that goes in
[1:29:42] the gospel has been watered down
[1:29:44] right but i mean we had we had a gospel
[1:29:47] that that used to bring about real
[1:29:49] change
[1:29:52] and the only way that it's going to
[1:29:53] bring about change it's got to be
[1:29:55] preached in its fullness
[1:29:58] but but in 111 um a psalm that says
[1:30:01] praise you the lord i will praise the
[1:30:03] lord with my whole heart
[1:30:06] right
[1:30:07] you know you know
[1:30:09] man praise is what i do
[1:30:13] huh
[1:30:14] god created me to praise him
[1:30:16] huh
[1:30:17] i was a praiser when i was in the mind
[1:30:20] of god before
[1:30:21] god saw me praising
[1:30:24] god saw you praise it
[1:30:27] hallelujah
[1:30:28] glory to his name
[1:30:30] david identified with praise
[1:30:33] david identified with man david got to
[1:30:36] cutting up one time when he saw the ark
[1:30:38] of the covenant coming back
[1:30:41] man look at here he
[1:30:43] i could imagine
[1:30:45] i could have i gotta take my glasses off
[1:30:47] for this one
[1:30:48] i could imagine david
[1:30:51] not like this praise dance stuff you see
[1:30:53] now
[1:30:55] carl again
[1:30:57] i know y'all say he
[1:30:59] you know not nothing cute i just believe
[1:31:02] david didn't have no rhythm
[1:31:04] he probably is like oh glory the world
[1:31:07] is coming back hallelujah
[1:31:11] not not not standing waiting on see some
[1:31:13] of the things that i just really don't
[1:31:15] agree with but i let people do whatever
[1:31:17] they gonna do anyway you know not
[1:31:19] waiting on the music
[1:31:22] [Music]
[1:31:34] spontaneous worship
[1:31:37] spontaneous worship
[1:31:40] some strike you so deep
[1:31:43] that you something that you know what
[1:31:44] i'm talking about that you get besides
[1:31:46] yourself
[1:31:48] yes huh you don't care who looking you
[1:31:51] are shot all around a building
[1:31:54] all down through the house
[1:32:02] i think that's why we got all this
[1:32:05] around us
[1:32:09] all this other stuff we ain't hardly
[1:32:10] moving we coming to church and letting
[1:32:13] the air conditioner freeze us
[1:32:16] what we got to put on now ain't nothing
[1:32:17] wrong with y'all if you call your car
[1:32:20] somebody ask me when's the night brother
[1:32:22] smiley watch you oh you got that hoodie
[1:32:24] on i'd be cold
[1:32:27] it'd be cold in this building buddy
[1:32:30] i said i got a trick for that
[1:32:33] right
[1:32:34] but amen we need to shout but he said i
[1:32:37] will praise the lord
[1:32:40] right
[1:32:41] uh in the assembly of the upright right
[1:32:44] and like we say upright is the
[1:32:46] definition of a person
[1:32:48] of their behavior strictly honorable and
[1:32:51] honest right
[1:32:52] and and when when we
[1:32:55] when we think about scripture i i just
[1:32:57] have to think about all the things that
[1:32:59] i understand and i know
[1:33:02] uh uh
[1:33:04] god started out a church in genesis
[1:33:07] upright
[1:33:09] honorable and honest
[1:33:11] as christians
[1:33:12] you know
[1:33:14] that's the kind of atmosphere you want
[1:33:16] to be up under
[1:33:18] right
[1:33:19] you you want to sit up on a man that's
[1:33:22] honorable that has integrity morals and
[1:33:25] scruples and things of that nature is
[1:33:27] that right
[1:33:29] because like we often say god is only
[1:33:31] going to be identified by its
[1:33:33] characteristic there's things that god
[1:33:36] will be identified witness things that
[1:33:38] god will not be identified with
[1:33:40] [Music]
[1:33:41] right glory to god he only and see
[1:33:44] here's your thing and i think brother
[1:33:46] jack struck this a while back
[1:33:48] god
[1:33:48] requires
[1:33:50] that which is past
[1:33:54] why is that scripture in the bible
[1:33:57] because that scripture tells me
[1:34:00] what
[1:34:00] what was past
[1:34:03] was in the original thinking and mind of
[1:34:06] god
[1:34:08] you can't get away with it right you
[1:34:10] know when they when they came up to
[1:34:11] jesus one time and they was trying to
[1:34:14] trick him but he was a master of
[1:34:16] circumstances
[1:34:18] and there was action i'm about and i'm
[1:34:19] not gonna preach on divorce that's
[1:34:21] brother jack job uh uh uh about about
[1:34:24] you know
[1:34:26] divorce
[1:34:27] in so many words he just brought him to
[1:34:29] a place he said first of all your
[1:34:31] heart's hard he said moses moses did it
[1:34:35] but it wasn't so from the beginning
[1:34:38] that's what he said right it wasn't so
[1:34:40] from the beginning
[1:34:42] why could jesus because he was the
[1:34:44] author and the finisher he was the first
[1:34:46] in the last
[1:34:48] he could look back to the
[1:34:50] he was god veil
[1:34:53] he understood the principles of god
[1:34:57] he could look back when it was just one
[1:34:59] buck in one door
[1:35:01] before the before the fall
[1:35:04] right
[1:35:05] before before the fall
[1:35:07] right it was one buck and one dope right
[1:35:10] right
[1:35:11] right right
[1:35:13] go back to imagine divorce
[1:35:15] right before the fall see amen
[1:35:18] after the fall and this is where we we
[1:35:21] got our problem at but
[1:35:23] back then
[1:35:24] it was certain principles
[1:35:27] implemented that god could identify
[1:35:30] himself with
[1:35:31] [Music]
[1:35:32] see
[1:35:33] people want to bring in polygamy and all
[1:35:35] of this other stuff and a wife and a
[1:35:37] girlfriend and now you got a wife and a
[1:35:40] girlfriend and a boyfriend and all this
[1:35:43] kind of stuff y'all don't preach with me
[1:35:44] this is the age that you you you got
[1:35:47] this gender
[1:35:48] identity stuff and
[1:35:50] i'm going somewhere church
[1:35:53] you you've got all of this foolishness
[1:35:55] that that that people fight now
[1:36:00] they fight hard to bring in the uh uh uh
[1:36:04] these gender perspectives that's
[1:36:06] contrary to the word of god
[1:36:10] god knew what he meant
[1:36:12] from the beginning when he made adam and
[1:36:15] eve
[1:36:17] huh
[1:36:18] right
[1:36:19] god didn't make if god can make a
[1:36:21] mistake then we done
[1:36:24] we're done
[1:36:25] god did not make no now you know here's
[1:36:28] the intelligence of man i'm still going
[1:36:30] somewhere
[1:36:32] right where where you know people come
[1:36:34] this is what they're saying but it's
[1:36:36] these thoughts is coming from the pits
[1:36:37] of hell
[1:36:38] where where
[1:36:40] they're saying that you know
[1:36:42] folks coming to the earth with no
[1:36:44] no agendas and things of that nature
[1:36:47] it's like this is crazy
[1:36:49] this is the stuff that that they're
[1:36:51] teaching and they're pushing
[1:36:54] right they're pushing
[1:36:56] did they boycott right now dave
[1:36:58] chappelle cause his little comedy
[1:37:00] special
[1:37:02] right cause in a subtle way he's trying
[1:37:04] to say i'm born believe that stuff
[1:37:06] they fighting hard
[1:37:09] right
[1:37:09] to get this to the the millennials
[1:37:12] because we didn't believe that
[1:37:14] foolishness
[1:37:16] we
[1:37:17] now i'm a baby boomer but now that's all
[1:37:20] i can say about that cause i'm a
[1:37:22] christian
[1:37:23] see i according to the scripture i'm a
[1:37:26] part of the generation of the upright
[1:37:31] see i know where i'm
[1:37:32] at
[1:37:34] they might say well you're a baby boomer
[1:37:36] well that's carnal
[1:37:37] because there's so much that go here's
[1:37:39] the thing
[1:37:40] right
[1:37:41] when we make statements like that
[1:37:44] we we got to understand what follows
[1:37:46] these statements
[1:37:49] come on
[1:37:50] what what well you know and i'm gonna
[1:37:53] keep saying this and i i just gotta be
[1:37:55] sad
[1:37:57] right well we the
[1:38:01] and millennials said this and i'm gonna
[1:38:02] keep on saying it because it's some
[1:38:04] devils we got to chop off
[1:38:06] right
[1:38:09] okay
[1:38:10] when when we if you just say to me i'm a
[1:38:13] millennial and just leave it there
[1:38:16] then then okay
[1:38:18] on my right with just that statement
[1:38:21] but when you have this certain type of
[1:38:24] disposition in this attitude

[1:38:29] we're millennials and we don't go for
[1:38:31] this and we're millennials and we got to
[1:38:34] do this and we're millennial see you see
[1:38:37] the devil

[1:43:59] authority
[1:44:02] right she does not have the authority
[1:44:06] to push a vote
[1:44:08] and all the man he told me say he said
[1:44:11] rep he said all i did was what the
[1:44:13] church needed because the deacons wasn't
[1:44:15] wouldn't do it i say you are the supreme
[1:44:18] authority in the church no listen that
[1:44:21] that is the supreme authority in this
[1:44:25] church
[1:44:27] right
[1:44:28] we got preachers brother quite cool and
[1:44:30] and uh brother jerry myself and troy
[1:44:34] but we need supreme authority
[1:44:37] right i have to i pastor for 20 some
[1:44:40] years but i have to subject myself to
[1:44:43] brothers jack's ministry
[1:44:46] right glory to god glory to god no
[1:44:49] matter what i understand when he said
[1:44:53] bruh i i need y'all i'm here to i'm here
[1:44:56] i got you amen but after that when i
[1:44:59] leave this pulpit that's the man
[1:45:03] that's the man right there
[1:45:05] glory to god
[1:45:07] the box stops with brother jack not none
[1:45:10] of the rest of us
[1:45:12] see we've been we we we've been uh uh
[1:45:16] prone to follow evangelists and teachers
[1:45:19] and different things that's so contrast
[1:45:22] see when i watch all of this i'd be like
[1:45:24] you breaking scripture to do this stuff
[1:45:28] right
[1:45:29] amen that's what god gave us do you
[1:45:31] think brother branham just preached
[1:45:33] messages just to be preaching no no no
[1:45:36] he preached things amen to the upright
[1:45:39] generation that'll keep us in line with
[1:45:42] the word of god
[1:45:44] and the order of god
[1:45:47] see
[1:45:50] just like the president brother jack got
[1:45:51] veto power
[1:45:55] right
[1:45:56] but i believe he placed men in position
[1:46:00] that he could have confidence in that
[1:46:02] and make the right decision
[1:46:04] like when i you know i tell tell him
[1:46:06] about brother caper brother caples i
[1:46:08] never could have done it for 23 years
[1:46:09] with our brother and sister capus
[1:46:12] i placed them in a position
[1:46:14] i had total 100 percent confidence that
[1:46:17] he was going to make the right decision
[1:46:19] i wasn't always in the office uh how
[1:46:22] much money we got and all this it i did
[1:46:26] right praise the lord i implemented a
[1:46:29] few things brought in a few things and
[1:46:32] the rest
[1:46:33] i gave to brother capers to handle him
[1:46:35] and brother dave
[1:46:38] right
[1:46:39] amen that be time where where i want to
[1:46:41] do something they'd be like
[1:46:43] uh uh uh but we'll uh
[1:46:45] he'll do one of them numbers put his
[1:46:47] head down when he talks like brother
[1:46:48] will come look at me like oh nobody down
[1:46:51] that the fawn's looking a little okay
[1:46:53] that's all you got to say
[1:46:55] right
[1:46:56] amen because it's his job to keep the
[1:46:59] church from going bankrupt
[1:47:07] i could say that because they said quote
[1:47:09] yes yes right it's their job it's the
[1:47:12] trustees my brother jack might want to
[1:47:14] do things i hope that's all right bro
[1:47:15] jake it's all right huh what if the
[1:47:18] trustees say bro jack i think we might
[1:47:20] need to wait another four five months
[1:47:23] right
[1:47:26] let me tell y'all why we gon get it
[1:47:31] he gave me the okay to say that
[1:47:34] can we we're dealing with
[1:47:36] uh what's up right
[1:47:39] because because see there's always a law
[1:47:42] of contrast
[1:47:44] right
[1:47:45] that's upright and that's wicked
[1:47:48] and see this is why we got to be careful
[1:47:51] when when people approach these i'm
[1:47:53] trying to go somewhere
[1:47:55] uh well well
[1:47:57] we're generating this
[1:48:00] okay i'm watching the spirits
[1:48:02] see
[1:48:03] and and and
[1:48:05] see because there's a there's a there's
[1:48:07] a
[1:48:08] a spiritual application to all of these
[1:48:12] and and then if you watch
[1:48:15] right if you watch well i'm i'm i'm
[1:48:17] generation millennial
[1:48:20] and you come up under that spirit this
[1:48:22] is what you got to deal with
[1:48:25] come on you got to deal with all of
[1:48:28] these agendas
[1:48:29] and all of these things that they're
[1:48:31] promoting men wearing dresses and
[1:48:34] and and they're using hollywood

[1:52:57] and and his perspective is not honorable
[1:53:00] if he's partial in any form we might
[1:53:02] close this up

[1:53:10] the very beginning amen is right up
[1:53:14] honorable
[1:53:16] right

[1:53:20] worth holding on to
[1:53:23] as difficult as as things might be and
[1:53:27] things that's preached

[1:59:46] and full of compassion
[1:59:48] and sometimes people misunderstand the
[1:59:51] compassion of god
[1:59:53] and how and how god could go in the
[1:59:56] midst of of a group of people
[1:59:59] and heal a man that that

[2:00:23] getting in that show he could move
[2:00:26] right amen he had he had something going
[2:00:29] on in his body and you would think that
[2:00:32] jesus would come into the pool of
[2:00:33] bethesda
[2:00:34] and heal this man and walk right out and
[2:00:37] leave all of these sick people
[2:00:40] and call of mine would say
[2:00:43] where's the compassion and all that
[2:00:45] right
[2:00:47] right but here's the thing he said i
[2:00:49] ain't gonna do nothing except i
[2:00:51] i first see it
[2:00:52] by my father
[2:00:54] the father never showed him about
[2:00:56] healing because he could have said
[2:00:59] everybody in here rise up and gone on
[2:01:02] about your business
[2:01:04] and every demon
[2:01:06] would have had to go
[2:01:09] it would have been cuts and everything
[2:01:11] else like it was when brother branham
[2:01:12] was over in what bombay or somewhere

[2:13:45] brother smiley
[2:13:47] man on this morning and
[2:13:49] uh generation of the upright
[2:13:52] part two and
[2:13:54] uh you know i was just thinking how he
[2:13:56] was saying somebody told him brother
[2:13:58] smiley always sharing your testimony
[2:14:02] and um you know when you read in
[2:14:03] scripture like that
[2:14:05] but psalms 11 psalms 112 and
[2:14:08] you look back and you see where god has
[2:14:10] brought you from you can't help but show
[2:14:11] your testimony you
[2:14:13] realize that you were leaning
[2:14:16] amen at one point in time in your life
[2:14:18] you were leaning but god himself stood
[2:14:20] you upright
[2:14:22] right i mean for those years that he was
[2:14:24] a man on drugs he's lived more years off
[2:14:28] drugs
[2:14:29] than he did on drugs god has made a
[2:14:31] beautiful testimony out of brother
[2:14:32] smiley's life right so so he like he
[2:14:35] said i'm not i'm not just part of the
[2:14:36] baby boomer generation no no no no i
[2:14:39] it's a it's a greater purpose to my
[2:14:41] existence and just be born amongst the
[2:14:44] baby boomers i'm a part of the
[2:14:46] generation
[2:14:48] of the upright
[2:14:51] that is beautiful to me generation of
[2:14:53] the upright
[2:14:56] my god my god
[2:14:58] just thinking back on on last sunday man
[2:15:01] and just a sermon there and how you know
[2:15:03] we now behold now we are the children of
[2:15:06] god and and people don't realize who we
[2:15:09] are
[2:15:10] folk have no idea who we are right amen
[2:15:13] but but we know who we are we come from
[2:15:16] god we're going back to god we're part
[2:15:17] of this great generation of the upright
[2:15:20] no matter what generation you were born
[2:15:22] in
[2:15:23] this is the greatest greatest generation
[2:15:25] you can be a part of the generation of
[2:15:27] the uprights
[2:15:29] hallelujah i'm so glad i can say i'm one
[2:15:31] of them god bless you brother smiley
[2:15:33] thank you so much for
[2:15:35] just yielding yourself
[2:15:37] [Applause]
[2:15:39] a man
[2:15:41] you know he was uh talking about you
[2:15:43] know just he call it blocking
[2:15:46] amen and and and actually it's you know
[2:15:49] that's typically where people are doing
[2:15:50] a lot of writing but now
[2:15:52] uh the podcast thing has really taken
[2:15:55] off
[2:15:56] and uh and it's right it's something
[2:15:57] that you have to be careful of sometimes
[2:16:00] you can be saying something that could
[2:16:01] be very good but never get into a spot
[2:16:02] where you're trying to explain the word
[2:16:04] of god
[2:16:05] right don't do that don't don't do that
[2:16:07] because you'll get things all mixed up
[2:16:09] and you know and uh and and just
[2:16:11] unfortunate what i've seen the spirit
[2:16:13] that i've seen
[2:16:14] is that people that have lost their
[2:16:18] position
[2:16:19] maybe in church
[2:16:21] have used that platform
[2:16:24] to be a pulpit
[2:16:26] because they don't have a pulpit
[2:16:28] amen
[2:16:29] it's like um when uh
[2:16:32] kane got kicked out of the garden he had
[2:16:34] nothing
[2:16:36] praise the lord so they had to find
[2:16:38] someone else and you know brother was
[2:16:39] sharing this week so just think about
[2:16:40] just think about the names of some of
[2:16:42] this because
[2:16:43] uh it is scripture you know uh that's
[2:16:47] being fulfilled but just think about the
[2:16:48] names of
[2:16:50] you
[2:16:51] too
[2:16:52] [Music]
[2:16:54] you
[2:16:55] too it makes it all
[2:16:57] [Music]
[2:16:58] about it's not about god it's not it's
[2:17:01] it's all about you right
[2:17:03] and and so you start looking at some of
[2:17:05] these things and satan is behind it all
[2:17:07] just using it for his glory right so so
[2:17:10] we never we never really want to you
[2:17:12] know find ourselves just out there just
[2:17:14] i'm fine i'm kind of getting to the
[2:17:16] point where i just don't have enough
[2:17:17] time to keep up with it all
[2:17:19] amen you know you know people used to
[2:17:22] repent
[2:17:23] because they spent so much time shopping
[2:17:26] or or doing this and then spend enough
[2:17:28] time with the lord they used to repent
[2:17:30] go to church and repent of things like
[2:17:32] that now we should be repentant of all
[2:17:35] this time we spend on social media
[2:17:37] god has taken my time from you
[2:17:40] i need to be i need to be spending more
[2:17:42] time with you listening to the word and
[2:17:44] and feeling word look you can't listen
[2:17:45] to everybody podcast you can't you ain't
[2:17:47] got enough time
[2:17:49] praise the lord
[2:17:50] hallelujah i've only got enough time to
[2:17:52] listen to the word
[2:17:54] but that's the only thing that's gonna
[2:17:55] change me that's the only thing gonna
