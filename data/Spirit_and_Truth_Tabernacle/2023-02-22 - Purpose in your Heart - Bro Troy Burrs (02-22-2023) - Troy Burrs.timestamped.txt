[1:29] be seated I won't leave you standing if
[1:30] you grab your Bibles it will take a
[1:32] scripture reading real quick from Daniel
[1:35] the first chapter
[1:38] Daniel the first chapter
[1:41] amen
[1:47] probably going to be a little bit
[1:49] different and that might be used to the
[1:52] to the pastor's uh style so I don't I
[1:55] won't I'm not that computer savvy so you
[1:58] won't see all of that all of that stuff
[2:01] but uh
[2:03] hey man we'll go on anyway amen Daniel
[2:06] the first chapter it says here in the
[2:08] third year of the reign of
[2:11] uh jehoy Kim and I hope I said that
[2:15] right king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar
[2:19] King of Babylon
[2:20] until Jerusalem and blessed it and the
[2:24] Lord
[2:25] gave
[2:28] jeho Kim King of Judah into his hand
[2:33] with part of the vessels of the house of
[2:37] God
[2:38] and he carried
[2:42] amen and he cared into the land of
[2:44] shannar to the house
[2:46] of his God and he brought vessels into
[2:49] the treasures of house
[2:51] of his God
[2:53] and the King spake unto
[2:56] uh
[2:57] FNS the master of his eunuchs that he
[3:02] should bring a certain of the children
[3:04] of Israel and that the king's seed and
[3:08] of the princess
[3:10] children in whom was no blemish
[3:15] he would he but no blemish but well
[3:19] favored and skillful in all wisdom and
[3:22] cunning and knowledge and understanding
[3:25] science such as had ability in them to
[3:30] stand in the king's Palace and whom they
[3:34] might teach the learning and the tongue
[3:37] of the Chaldeans
[3:41] and the King appointed them a daily
[3:43] provision
[3:45] of the king's meat
[3:47] and of the King's Wine
[3:49] which he drank so nourishing them three
[3:53] years
[3:54] that at the end of the end thereof they
[3:58] might stand before the king
[4:01] now among these were the children of
[4:04] Judah
[4:05] Daniel hanaya
[4:08] Michelle and Azariah
[4:12] and unto whom the prince of the eunuchs
[4:16] gave names
[4:17] for he gave Daniel the name of
[4:19] belshazzar
[4:21] and to Hana Shadrach and unto Michelle
[4:27] uh Meshach and to Azariah of abendigo
[4:33] but Daniel purposed in his heart
[4:37] that he will not defile himself with the
[4:41] portion of the king's meat nor with the
[4:44] wine which he drank therefore he
[4:48] requested
[4:49] of the prince of the eunuchs that he
[4:52] might not defile
[4:54] himself amen may the Lord add a blessing
[4:57] to the reading of his word amen
[5:00] um the last time I was I was with you
[5:04] um I spoke on a little subject called uh
[5:10] withstanding the changing culture
[5:13] and this was part of that message there
[5:15] that you know uh you know Wednesday
[5:17] night sometimes we have to cut them kind
[5:19] of short so but this goes along with it
[5:22] we see that Daniel and those Hebrews
[5:24] that was uh are taken captive into
[5:27] Babylon amen that's exactly what they
[5:31] were doing they were withstanding that
[5:34] culture that was fastly changing
[5:37] amen the the they was the the king at
[5:41] that time was trying to get them to
[5:44] assimilate now the word assimilate means
[5:47] to to quote kind of uh uh uh to come
[5:50] into line or to be like the other people
[5:52] amen so we see here that uh
[5:58] the beginning of Daniel they offered
[6:02] them meat now I want you to put your
[6:05] spiritual thinking caps on because we're
[6:07] going to go somewhere in this and just
[6:09] point some things out that what you eat
[6:12] in your diet has a lot to do with uh
[6:17] your your physical well-being
[6:20] but in this instance where we were
[6:23] talking about here was a little bit more
[6:26] than the physical appearance
[6:29] amen now this is just types A man that
[6:31] he taught him that saying that they
[6:33] would come back and they would stand
[6:34] before the king amen and see that that
[6:38] that that that what was he feeding them
[6:40] was it taking hold or was it affecting
[6:43] them in the way that the king wanted or
[6:45] desired the food and the drink that he
[6:48] was giving them to affect them
[6:51] we see in this world today that we're
[6:54] living there because we're living in
[6:56] Babylon all over again
[6:58] we're living in the time of Babylon the
[7:01] word Babylon means Mass confusion
[7:05] okay and the world
[7:08] and that the devil is trying to feed you
[7:12] certain things to get you to come in
[7:15] line with the changing of the culture
[7:19] amen
[7:21] spiritually and physically
[7:25] uh I my wife just showed me an article
[7:29] on today as I was studying this message
[7:32] I think it was last night not knowing
[7:35] what I was the thought that I had in my
[7:37] heart and things of that nature but how
[7:40] they're cloning meat
[7:44] it was always a wonder she said I wonder
[7:47] why the eggs going up and the chicken
[7:50] ain't
[7:52] because the chicken is being cloned
[7:55] without
[7:56] in a in a in a petri dish
[8:00] so they they they're Mass producing
[8:04] uh meat that's going to give you no
[8:08] substance
[8:09] because it didn't come from life
[8:12] so there's no life in it
[8:14] and we in turn eat that
[8:17] we look at how uh the farmers and
[8:20] different things are so greedy and we
[8:24] see that hearing about everything is is
[8:26] is is is is so uh uh uh uh uh driven by
[8:31] money
[8:33] driven by greed the farmers that once
[8:36] had a desire to to grow uh fresh
[8:39] vegetables and fruit and things of that
[8:41] nature to feed people that we may have a
[8:44] good diet they are selling out now
[8:46] because it's more
[8:48] um
[8:49] profitable thank you excuse me
[8:52] to become uh landowners to sell their
[8:55] land to developments so they're getting
[8:58] out of the farming business and they're
[9:01] becoming millionaires because they're
[9:04] selling off portions of their Farm to
[9:06] Developers
[9:08] and in turn in doing so the developers
[9:11] come in and uh they cut down the trees
[9:13] and they take away the vegetables and
[9:16] they appeal brick and mortar houses for
[9:18] people to live in and they do manicured
[9:20] Lawns and then they build drainage
[9:23] ditches because they're somewhere near
[9:25] somewhere now for the water to go
[9:27] and they do all of these things uh uh
[9:30] just to make money everyone has a good
[9:33] idea of this is the way I can be rich
[9:36] and be money but they never consider the
[9:38] cost
[9:40] what is it really costing you yeah
[9:42] you're becoming rich you're becoming
[9:44] very well off
[9:47] amen but we'll get to something I don't
[9:49] want to get ahead of myself because you
[9:51] can't live in this life amen without
[9:54] having a true purpose and if I could
[9:58] title this message this evening that is
[10:00] the title we notice here that Daniel
[10:03] purposed in his heart
[10:06] that he might not defile himself with
[10:10] the king's meat
[10:13] no doubt you know
[10:15] I'm a carnivore at heart I love me some
[10:18] meat
[10:20] you know love a good steak every now and
[10:22] then love some chicken and things like
[10:25] that of that nature love you know you
[10:27] could see I love love to eat eat is a
[10:29] good you know I love to do that
[10:31] but at the same time I love to eat
[10:36] spiritual food
[10:38] amen just like I I love to eat natural
[10:41] food
[10:42] but see we're talking about this is it
[10:44] has a natural type also and a spiritual
[10:47] type
[10:48] your your your your spiritual health and
[10:52] along with your physical health is
[10:54] directly related to your diet
[10:58] and what you eat
[11:01] amen
[11:03] let's kind of move forward here as we we
[11:06] can here
[11:08] now the prophet says here that the soul
[11:11] of a man
[11:14] which can also be interpreted
[11:17] as the heart of a man
[11:19] it is the control tower
[11:22] of the human being
[11:24] amen
[11:25] his motives
[11:27] and and his objectives
[11:30] amen come from the heart
[11:34] so we see here that your uh uh what you
[11:38] purpose in your heart is very important
[11:42] amen so when we look at a subject like
[11:45] this we have to go below the surface
[11:47] amen we have to look deeper amen
[11:50] see what causes what causes uh our
[11:55] motivation
[11:56] amen the Bible says out of the abundance
[11:59] of the heart the mouth speaking out of
[12:02] the man's heart now look here in Mark 7
[12:05] the 18th chapter to the 23rd verse Jesus
[12:08] said and he saith unto them
[12:11] are ye also without understanding are ye
[12:14] so without understanding also
[12:17] do ye not perceive that what things from
[12:22] without interest into the man
[12:25] it cannot defile him
[12:28] because it interests not into his heart
[12:33] but into his belly talking about his
[12:36] spiritual man now
[12:37] and going without into drought purging
[12:41] all Meats
[12:44] and he said that which cometh out of a
[12:48] man
[12:48] that defilest the man
[12:51] from without
[12:54] for from within out of his heart of a
[12:58] man proceed evil thoughts adulteries
[13:02] fornication murders
[13:05] deaths covetousness
[13:08] wickedness deceit that's your business
[13:12] an evil eye
[13:14] blasphemy Pride
[13:17] foolishness
[13:20] these things come out of his heart
[13:24] all these evils come from with these
[13:26] things that come from within the man is
[13:28] what defile him
[13:30] Jesus is telling us the real source of
[13:34] where a lot of our problems are
[13:36] generated from
[13:38] this is why we need to guard our hearts
[13:43] amen keep it from defilement and
[13:48] pollution at our core being because what
[13:53] we allow to enter into our heart
[13:57] will come out and manifest in our lives
[14:01] amen Jesus telling us the real source of
[14:05] work a lot of our problems are generated
[14:07] from
[14:08] what we allow to come into our hearts
[14:15] now we remember
[14:16] King David
[14:18] amen his sin with Bathsheba was because
[14:22] he had let his heart become defiled with
[14:27] wrong thoughts
[14:29] amen
[14:31] because somewhere along the way he had
[14:34] let a thought
[14:36] take root in his heart
[14:39] about having an affair with another
[14:42] man's wife
[14:44] it wasn't that he didn't have wives of
[14:46] his own
[14:47] amen
[14:49] but he wanted another man's wife
[14:51] and so when the opportunity presented
[14:55] itself
[14:56] what was already in his heart came out
[15:00] in his life
[15:02] and it didn't end well for him or the
[15:06] others around him
[15:08] all starting from what David allowed to
[15:13] enter into his heart
[15:15] now the prophet was saying that that uh
[15:19] birds can fly over your head
[15:23] amen but you don't have to let that bird
[15:26] take make a nest
[15:29] so thoughts are going to come
[15:31] the devil is going to come and bring you
[15:33] all kind of thoughts
[15:35] but you have to guard your heart
[15:38] by shoeing those birds away showing
[15:41] those thoughts away anytime you have a
[15:44] evil thought it comes to your mind you
[15:47] immediately shoot that thing away
[15:50] amen
[15:52] the Bible says uh in Psalms 51 David
[15:57] said created me a clean heart
[16:01] O Lord and renew a righteous spirit
[16:06] Within Me
[16:08] it was an outside problem
[16:12] it was a heart condition
[16:15] David had a heart condition
[16:17] because of what he ate
[16:20] Now isn't that quite a type of the
[16:23] natural sometimes what we allow
[16:25] ourselves to eat in our diet would give
[16:28] us
[16:29] heart problems
[16:30] clog Our arteries and and and give us
[16:34] trouble down the road that we are asking
[16:37] the church to pray for us
[16:39] and the Lord to deliver us amen but we
[16:43] can take now and take some steps of
[16:47] being careful of what we allow our diet
[16:51] to be a man to help so that we don't
[16:54] have to go through that
[16:58] spiritually and naturally
[17:01] a lot of time because of our diet we
[17:05] bring things on ourselves
[17:07] now I'm preaching to myself this this
[17:10] evening
[17:11] and I've been really doing some things
[17:13] that's why when this message really came
[17:14] to me it was just so timely because I've
[17:18] been doing a lot of things my wife can
[17:20] attached to it and
[17:21] got her drinking all kind of teas and
[17:24] juicing and all kinds of things and you
[17:27] know uh just trying to do some things a
[17:29] little bit different here I'm no young
[17:32] man anymore
[17:34] my body just don't digest all of that
[17:36] garbage too well
[17:38] I can't go to the McDonald's in the
[17:40] Burger Kings and and all of the fast
[17:43] foods and amen even the the the the the
[17:46] as much as I eat
[17:48] uh uh sister Erica was got me on a
[17:52] little thing now I'm started to do a
[17:54] little intermittent fasting
[17:56] allowing myself to skip a meal or two
[18:00] amen
[18:01] and uh uh uh at first it was really
[18:04] difficult amen but I allowed myself the
[18:07] man
[18:09] down to one meal a day
[18:10] for the most part
[18:12] amen so and I can feel some changes and
[18:16] things in my energy level and and
[18:18] different things like that so y'all just
[18:20] keep praying for me I just keep going
[18:22] but at the same time understanding that
[18:25] that also have some spiritual
[18:26] applications
[18:28] amen I want to be careful of my
[18:31] spiritual diet
[18:33] amen what I'll allow my mind and my
[18:36] heart to feed upon
[18:38] amen because that what you put in your
[18:41] body and your feet upon it can give you
[18:43] a heart condition
[18:46] amen here just like David had a heart
[18:48] condition it came blamed Bathsheba or or
[18:52] or Uriah no one else he had a heart
[18:56] condition that made him sick
[19:00] that made him sick that caused him to do
[19:04] the things that he did
[19:06] amen
[19:08] you must you cannot stop
[19:12] at letting the thought coming into your
[19:15] head you must Shue it away
[19:17] from those things not dwelling on them
[19:19] letting them become a part of the
[19:22] purpose of your heart because it is out
[19:25] of the heart that your life will be
[19:27] manifested in Proverbs the fourth
[19:31] chapter in the 23rd verse here
[19:33] it says keep thy heart with all
[19:36] diligence
[19:37] for out of it
[19:39] are the issues of life
[19:42] the word initial keep means to God to
[19:46] watch over to protect amen you must
[19:50] purpose in your heart to do the right
[19:53] thing
[19:54] of life according to the plan of God
[19:58] if you purpose in your heart
[20:02] then there where if you have no purpose
[20:05] in your heart
[20:07] then there is no Center core for your
[20:09] convictions
[20:11] you must have a purpose in your heart
[20:14] that drives you that gives you
[20:17] conviction that gives you a reason to
[20:19] keep going if you're just just just just
[20:22] just floating through willy-nilly and
[20:24] and have no purpose you have nothing
[20:26] tied to you have nothing to drive you we
[20:31] see hearing this story with Daniel
[20:33] Daniel purposed in his heart
[20:35] that he would not defile himself with
[20:38] the king's meat
[20:41] he would not defile himself
[20:44] amen
[20:46] so many people talk about
[20:49] life that you should pursue
[20:52] amen and and pursue uh a great job now
[20:57] that there's nothing wrong with having a
[20:58] great job
[20:59] but what are you doing with it
[21:02] amen
[21:04] um um um a lot of people there was a a
[21:06] fellow in my job I was having a
[21:08] conversation with at one time and and
[21:10] and and and and I was just sort of
[21:12] checking him he's just talking about how
[21:15] much money he's made and how well he's
[21:17] he's doing and things of that nature and
[21:20] it's quite natural yeah you're doing
[21:21] pretty good
[21:23] but I told him I say I facetiously I say
[21:26] yeah he who died with the most toys win
[21:28] and he looked at me and he said yes and
[21:31] I looked at him I said
[21:33] I said my
[21:35] if that's what you really think he who
[21:38] dies with the most tourists when you
[21:39] ain't gonna take nothing with you
[21:42] I told him at that time I told him I
[21:45] said never seen a U-Haul truck falling
[21:47] behind a hearse
[21:49] so you die in your accumulate all of
[21:53] these worldly Goods
[21:55] just to leave it here
[21:58] just to leave it here so what did you
[22:00] really do what was your real purpose
[22:02] what did you really do what are you
[22:03] leaving
[22:05] see you have to purpose in your heart
[22:07] Amen to to to to do something bigger
[22:11] than just having material things
[22:14] now let me let me go on here many people
[22:16] thought that when they got to a certain
[22:19] point in materialism
[22:21] that it would bring them all happiness
[22:24] and contentment only to find out
[22:27] that there's trouble even with all the
[22:30] money you have
[22:33] people that are so wealthy
[22:35] billionaires are committing suicide
[22:39] it shows you that the material wealth a
[22:42] man does not bring you complete peace it
[22:46] does not bring you Joy it does not bring
[22:49] you the happiness that you're seeking
[22:51] amen that only comes with the person of
[22:55] Peace amen the Prince of Peace
[22:58] so we want to find a purpose in our life
[23:00] that's bigger than ourselves
[23:02] amen
[23:04] the little short time we have here on
[23:06] Earth just breathing air and
[23:09] accumulating material things only to
[23:12] lose it all when we die
[23:14] now it is impossible or it is possible
[23:18] for you to occupy this planning for 70
[23:22] to 80 years
[23:24] and just breathe the air and eat food
[23:27] and walk upon the Earth and collect nice
[23:30] stuff
[23:32] but when you are gone
[23:34] if nothing in your life
[23:37] was achieved for the Eternal purpose of
[23:41] God
[23:42] then it was a wasted life
[23:45] then it was a wasted life
[23:48] so how
[23:51] do I keep my hard guarded
[23:53] that's the question here
[23:55] how do we keep our hearts guarded
[23:57] especially in this day when there's so
[24:00] many distractions and purposes that are
[24:03] fighting us for recognition
[24:05] amen
[24:08] recently on my job
[24:10] I was working there and had to put up
[24:14] some lights on the the street there
[24:18] but this poll that we came to
[24:22] had a swarm of bees
[24:26] these bees had just taken over I mean I
[24:30] wasn't going nowhere near it and I say
[24:32] that but I did
[24:34] and uh
[24:36] just bees everywhere so we had to call
[24:39] out the beekeeper
[24:42] and The Beekeeper come out and he went
[24:44] out and
[24:46] in order for him to do his job
[24:49] he had to know how bees think
[24:52] and how they how they maneuver and how
[24:54] they operate
[24:56] and one of the things here a bee Colony
[24:59] the queen bee
[25:01] are fed a different diet
[25:05] to the other bees in the hive
[25:09] and the only difference in whether
[25:15] you make sure I'm not missing none in
[25:17] the story here the only difference in
[25:19] whether a fertilized egg develops into a
[25:21] worker bee versus a queen bee
[25:25] is the food that it's fed
[25:29] to it during its development
[25:32] okay that's the only difference between
[25:34] a worker bee and a queen bee is the food
[25:38] that it eats
[25:40] The Hive if the hive requires a new
[25:45] Queen
[25:46] then a fertilized egg will be placed
[25:49] into a larger Queen sale
[25:53] either by the current queen or by the
[25:58] worker bees
[25:59] then the special feeding begins
[26:03] an egg which is required to develop into
[26:07] a queen bee is fed a diet
[26:11] of what is known as royal jelly
[26:17] she is fed nothing else
[26:20] the royal jelly causes this egg to
[26:24] develop faster and bigger with the full
[26:28] reproductive capabilities that only the
[26:32] queen bee has
[26:34] the queen bee will remain on a strict
[26:39] royal jelly diet
[26:42] for the rest of her life
[26:45] living 30 to 40 times longer than any
[26:48] other bee in the hive
[26:50] and capable of laying upwards of 2000
[26:54] eggs per day
[26:56] clearly there's something very special
[26:59] about that royal jelly
[27:04] and there's also something very special
[27:07] about the message of the Hour Diet
[27:11] that is our royal jelly
[27:14] amen that allows us to reproduce a man
[27:19] The Life of Christ amen it allows us
[27:23] amen gives us What It Takes Amen to be
[27:27] uh uh Kings and Priests amen the royal
[27:31] jelly we are sitting amongst on
[27:34] Wednesday nights and Sunday nights and
[27:37] and some Friday nights and being fed
[27:40] royal jelly
[27:43] amen feeding on nothing but royal jelly
[27:48] amen becoming bigger amen and stronger
[27:52] amen and wiser now this goes all the way
[27:55] back down to Daniel when they had to
[27:57] come before the king
[27:59] Daniel we're coming up on the Daniel
[28:01] Fast Daniel said give me beans and water
[28:06] don't I don't give me that stuff that
[28:08] the king is eating or want us to eat
[28:11] what is he trying to do defile us Amen

[28:18] of Babylon

[28:24] living in that that manner amen uh uh uh

[32:17] shower and let the impurities come out

[32:21] get the mucus out
[32:23] there's certain vitamins and things of
[32:26] that nature hey man we got to get out
[32:27] and get in the sun sometime
[32:30] that vitamin DC everything you have need
[32:33] of God is already provided
[32:36] see but we get so accustomed because we
[32:41] have become accustomed to the culture
[32:45] we
[32:46] got cars now we don't walk no more
[32:51] see we come in accustomed to a change
[32:54] this this culture
[32:56] and it's killing us every time
[32:58] there's more fast food restaurants try
[33:01] to find a good healthy place to eat
[33:04] hard to find but you pass by 50
[33:07] McDonald's
[33:09] Wendy's
[33:11] and everything else hard to find a good
[33:13] home-cooked meal
[33:16] so you got to take that time Amen to
[33:19] just push away
[33:21] notice what happens when you when you
[33:23] push away and you allow your mind and
[33:26] your body to detox itself
[33:30] the prophet said you begin we look out
[33:33] here in Daniel
[33:35] they allowed themselves to to not be
[33:38] defiled and God was able to deal with
[33:41] them in dreams and visions
[33:44] amen gave them strength to withstand the
[33:48] test and the battle that they had to go
[33:50] through
[33:53] those
[33:54] Shadrach Meshach and then Bendigo
[33:57] a man would not bow down to the king
[34:00] why because they had not assimilated to
[34:04] the culture
[34:05] they had not taken of the king's meat
[34:08] which would have weakened them
[34:13] but they was able to stand in the face
[34:16] of of of of of of of of of of uh the
[34:20] pressure
[34:22] and what happened God came down
[34:26] the prophet said he came down and fanned
[34:29] away the flames
[34:31] amen
[34:34] Daniel
[34:36] he didn't defile himself
[34:39] with the king's meat
[34:42] and became divisions and so divisions
[34:45] was able to the wisest man in the
[34:47] Kingdom
[34:49] because he Sanctified himself
[34:53] because he stayed away from those things
[34:55] he purposed in his heart so he guarded
[34:59] his heart
[35:01] against those things
[35:04] my brothers and sisters it's important
[35:07] to guard your heart
[35:10] we don't want to end up with a heart
[35:12] condition
[35:14] by the diet that we eat
[35:16] amen
[35:18] so we see here that uh
[35:23] the bees they eat this royal jelly
[35:27] they're on a special diet
[35:29] amen that allows them to reproduce amen
[35:34] and to be bigger and stronger amen than
[35:38] their adversary
[35:39] bigger and stronger than those uh worker
[35:42] bees
[35:44] amen
[35:48] why has the world become so defile and
[35:52] filled with crazy things
[35:55] that are taking hold of the people lives
[36:00] the people
[36:02] are going crazy
[36:05] and it is all to do with their diet
[36:10] y'all don't hear me
[36:12] I say the people are going crazy and
[36:14] it's all to do with their diet
[36:18] my wife just pulled up a a a quote for
[36:21] me uh just last night there was some how
[36:25] many mass shootings this year
[36:28] 67 mass shootings
[36:31] now I'm gonna read you a quote
[36:34] the prophet for saw this
[36:37] so much of the problems that come from
[36:39] people's lives
[36:40] has to do with their diet and what
[36:44] they're feeding on naturally and
[36:46] spiritually so the Book of Daniel shows
[36:49] us a mystery for this hour
[36:52] that people the people of God are
[36:54] surrounded by a Babylonian influence
[36:58] it shows us that we are to purpose in
[37:03] our heart in this hour
[37:05] to eat the right spiritual food in due
[37:09] season especially
[37:12] when we are surrounded
[37:15] by all the spectacular and dainties and
[37:19] tasty delicatessens of food and wines of
[37:23] Babylon
[37:26] read between the lines now
[37:28] we are spiritually
[37:31] we are surrounded
[37:33] amen by the spiritual food of Babylon
[37:39] amen which tastes good
[37:43] it don't talk about
[37:46] short dresses
[37:48] they don't talk about
[37:51] decency
[37:53] and in order
[37:55] no it just tastes good eat drink and be
[37:59] merry
[38:01] in other words if it feels good do it
[38:05] amen but sometime that uh food amen that
[38:11] the eunuchs was providing
[38:13] may not be an old taste as The Taste is
[38:16] but it is sufficient amen the prophet
[38:19] said it seemed like God you eat that and
[38:22] God take a a couple of vitamins and just
[38:25] pour it in there for you and then to
[38:27] give you strength amen
[38:30] a couple of quotes here
[38:33] says remembering in this the message
[38:35] remembering the Lord
[38:38] uh 62 1209
[38:42] he says there has to be a creator
[38:45] and if there is a creation
[38:48] and if there uh and if there is a
[38:51] creation it was made by a creator
[38:57] and any man's work reflects himself
[39:02] he is a good Carpenter he is a good
[39:06] work
[39:08] he does good work he builds
[39:12] and if he is a good mechanic he does
[39:15] good work
[39:18] your work only reflects you
[39:22] and God's creation
[39:25] reflects God
[39:27] and God made everything for a purpose
[39:32] and everything that serves God's purpose
[39:38] when it dies it has a resurrection
[39:43] and if a man serves God's purpose
[39:48] there is a resurrection just as sure as
[39:52] anything
[39:55] we have all no doubt no thought about
[39:59] the purpose of why we have been put here
[40:03] upon this Earth
[40:05] and at this time in history humanity is
[40:09] in Babylon again
[40:12] it is a time of mass confusion
[40:16] where the main idea is that if it feels
[40:21] good
[40:22] then do it
[40:25] and the message the world is falling
[40:27] apart again
[40:30] he says here
[40:32] uh
[40:34] as I said 1963 1172 paragraph 178.
[40:41] just think
[40:44] what could you promise yourself today
[40:48] in another 10 to 15 years
[40:53] if the world shall stand
[40:56] if it does stand that every man in
[40:59] Shreveport
[41:01] Every Woman
[41:03] you have to pack a gun on the street
[41:07] with you in your pocket to protect
[41:10] yourself
[41:14] the hoodlums
[41:17] how you going to stop it
[41:20] he says I was in New York the other week
[41:23] and went down through there for Miles
[41:27] was nothing but these teenage hoodlums
[41:33] with earrings in the ear
[41:37] and ratted hair
[41:40] and legatards
[41:44] on the girls
[41:47] with little bikinis
[41:50] they called it on like that out on the
[41:54] street
[41:55] and the public has to give them the
[41:58] right-of-way
[42:00] what is the matter with this country he
[42:04] says it's because a sign of moral Decay
[42:08] God rejected Nation
[42:13] tell me if we don't see that now
[42:17] people with leggings and leotards more
[42:19] than they were
[42:21] pants they don't went from pants they
[42:23] call them pants I guess
[42:26] you everywhere you waitresses everywhere
[42:29] you go
[42:30] leggings leotards
[42:33] it used to be a time where they kind of
[42:34] that was underneath garments
[42:36] now they wearing their underneath
[42:38] garments as outer garments
[42:42] moral Decay because they have fed from
[42:46] the king's table
[42:48] they've been feeding a diet
[42:50] that has decayed their minds
[42:57] so it's important my brothers and
[42:59] sisters
[43:01] to guard our hearts
[43:03] give ourselves a purpose
[43:07] that is God's purpose
[43:09] not just material things or when there's
[43:12] something to do for the kingdom of the
[43:14] Lord make sure you be caught doing
[43:17] something working for him
[43:19] even in my job in my career I find I I I
[43:24] I I I I tell everybody I say that God
[43:26] has me here for a purpose
[43:32] I have a co-worker who
[43:36] I've been
[43:38] kind of dealing with
[43:41] some 10 years
[43:43] I gave him a church age book
[43:46] and uh
[43:48] he took it held on to it for about four
[43:51] years
[43:53] then just gave it back to him I said did
[43:55] you read it no I didn't read
[43:58] I said okay
[43:59] you have no idea what you what you just
[44:02] turned down
[44:03] but he's religious
[44:05] very religious
[44:08] and one day on the job I was going
[44:10] through something and I I we have our
[44:12] meeting and right in the middle of the
[44:13] meeting not just quoted scripture
[44:16] this came out of inspiration I just
[44:19] quoted the scripture they were getting
[44:21] on my nerves I just quoted a description
[44:24] you get angry sometimes your quote
[44:27] description
[44:27] [Laughter]
[44:30] it's called a scripture
[44:32] and it caught them all off guard
[44:35] room became a little quiet
[44:37] so then he jumped up says oh I didn't
[44:39] know we recording scriptures I got
[44:40] plenty of them
[44:42] but did it come from your heart
[44:44] because if it was inspired to you you
[44:46] would have quoted a scripture don't wait
[44:48] and wait till I quote the scripture talk
[44:49] about how many scriptures you can quote
[44:52] no all right mine came it was real
[44:56] I was dealing with something and that's
[44:58] what came out
[45:00] what come out of your mouth
[45:04] but now
[45:07] he's having an issue
[45:10] so I try to show love
[45:12] and say Lord what is my purpose because
[45:15] we've had some really deep meaningful
[45:17] conversations
[45:18] and I'm sure he's had with no one else
[45:21] on that job
[45:22] those kind of talks
[45:24] those kind of conversations
[45:28] and I'm sure that I I would hope I would
[45:30] say that he's thinking on some of those
[45:32] things now and he said Lord if that's my
[45:35] purpose
[45:36] and let me serve my purpose
[45:39] I'm sorry not my purpose your purpose
[45:43] not my will but your will be done
[45:47] Amen to serve the Lord's will even our
[45:50] young people
[45:52] you know as a young man you can serve
[45:54] God's purpose even in school
[45:57] I have testimony after testimony
[46:00] when I was in school amen they even even
[46:03] on the job now they called me I got a
[46:05] nickname right now every time somebody

[46:08] say you the preacher man
[46:10] I said yeah okay I guess I wear that

[46:38] mean this good just huge just naturally
[46:40] big running back for the football team
[46:43] I ain't gonna call his name I almost
[46:45] called his name

[46:51] in the gym there in PE he's typing PE
[46:54] class put him back and he take the
[46:56] basketball and throw it and hit me in

[47:23] guys in the class coach Grant from the
[47:26] kill Troy you better go out there and
[47:27] get him
[47:28] I'd have said to my name
[47:33] because this guy was so so much bigger
[47:36] than I was
[47:38] so when we got outside
[47:40] I just caught him and I say man what is
[47:44] the problem
[47:45] what is it I mean you know man you ain't
[47:48] got no problem with you what is the

[47:52] and look what is it you're going through
[47:55] something at home
[47:56] is there anything I can help you with
[47:58] because obviously and I'm maybe a junior
[48:01] in high school and this is how I'm
[48:03] having the conversation with this fella
[48:06] and by that time
[48:09] he's standing there and he looks at me

[48:29] a little conversation that's all we just
[48:31] came out here to have a conversation we
[48:33] ain't coming out here to fight we came
[48:34] out here to have a conversation
[48:37] and the coach was even the PE coach was
[48:39] impressed with that so you can take even
[48:42] in your school take a stand
[48:45] guard your heart
[48:48] it's okay to be different
[48:50] Daniel didn't have no problem being
[48:52] different
[48:53] those Hebrew boys didn't have a problem
[48:55] being different because they knew it
[48:59] would pay in itself
[49:01] at the end
[49:03] it was the way God wanted them to be see
[49:05] they they had it purposed in their heart
[49:08] that they not going to be just like the
[49:10] other kids these other kids are losing
[49:13] Lord I Have Mercy the kids the kids the
[49:15] kids
[49:16] it's about this I'm looking at these
[49:18] things now Lord let us hurry up and get
[49:20] to church and get our school
[49:22] because these Public Schools is just
[49:25] ridiculous
[49:27] just ridiculous
[49:29] but you can be different even in the
