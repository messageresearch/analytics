[30:59] church

[31:05] open is when he'd step into the pulpit
[31:07] and actually read the word of god and
[31:08] begin to preach
[31:09] but soon as he would close his bible and
[31:12] and step out the pulpit his eyes were
[31:13] just shut
[31:14] tight again uh but i remember you know
[31:17] we saw him there
[31:18] in that condition and they went out to
[31:20] eat on a sunday after service and they

[31:25] brother dixon if you want to get some
[31:26] food from the buffet you have to open up
[31:28] your eyes and go up there and get it
[31:30] and uh and uh brother dick said okay if

[31:34] popped his eyes open by faith and
[31:36] they've been open ever since
[31:41] our god is a healer amen he's a he he's

[33:52] [Music]
[34:04] oh
[34:07] [Music]
[34:09] let's see one more time
[34:22] [Music]
[34:27] amen praise the lord there's nobody like
[34:31] our king jesus
[34:35] healer we make up hallelujah thank you
[34:39] lord
[34:40] amen it's good to be in west palm again
[34:42] we thank the lord for
[34:44] all of you have come out to hear the
[34:46] word of god and
[34:48] we pray that you come to see the lord
[34:52] because without him being here it's just
[34:55] a bunch of us just come together but we
[34:57] we know if god is here all things are
[34:59] possible
[35:01] so we have to come with that expectation
[35:04] and i pray that the lord will give you
[35:05] something you can take home
[35:07] you know something that you can live by
[35:10] and uh again like
[35:11] like jack said you know we've known each
[35:14] other a long time amen
[35:16] and uh it's been good
[35:20] um first time i i think one of the first
[35:22] times i ever came to florida
[35:25] to preach was actually at brother
[35:26] smileys i think
[35:28] um years ago and then from there we
[35:32] kind of they kind of got me in the loop
[35:37] to start preaching that brother wesco
[35:39] meetings and his
[35:40] history from there you know so we
[35:44] i love them brothers i certainly
[35:45] appreciate them they like big brothers
[35:47] to me
[35:48] and uh anything i can do to help them
[35:50] and likewise i know
[35:52] uh they'll do it for me so we just we
[35:54] just love god and it's good to
[35:56] be here still believing the same thing
[36:01] amen because trials and tribulation has
[36:04] altered some people's thinking
[36:07] it ain't the word that's changed it's
[36:09] just the way they're thinking that's
[36:11] changed
[36:12] so i'm grateful that i still think like
[36:15] i once
[36:16] thought when i first got illuminated you
[36:18] know and that's a blessing
[36:20] amen so we just love god let's just have
[36:22] a word of prayer and we just pray that
[36:24] the lord is going to move you know i'm
[36:26] grateful
[36:28] you know my my voice is much better you
[36:30] know i want a piece of this but i'ma
[36:32] just let it go
[36:33] you know because this time probably uh a
[36:36] year ago
[36:37] i had no voice i mean every time i would
[36:39] try to
[36:40] preach or sing it just clog up on me and
[36:43] that was it
[36:44] but i didn't quit i kept preaching i
[36:47] kept singing
[36:48] and i kept saying it's gonna come back
[36:51] it's gonna come back
[36:52] and it's almost there it's almost there
[36:55] i i
[36:56] i'm not settling for a cracking of the
[36:59] song
[37:00] no i wanted to be clear and pure that's
[37:03] what i'm looking for like it was
[37:05] god can restore amen that's what we're
[37:07] believing for so let's just have a word
[37:09] of prayer and we'll get
[37:10] right into the word of god tonight if
[37:12] you have a need you can lodge it to the
[37:13] lord by
[37:13] uplifting hand lord god we just love you
[37:16] we appreciate you and thank you there's
[37:18] nobody like you lord
[37:20] lord we can search this world over and
[37:22] over again lord but nothing
[37:24] can compare to you lord you're our
[37:27] strength you're our peace your
[37:28] lord you're our deliverance our healer
[37:30] lord our provider
[37:32] lord any adjective that speaks of good
[37:34] and greatness father

[37:40] you for
[37:41] just calling us out of the world lord
[37:44] and illuminating this word in our lives
[37:47] father
[37:47] and holding us father because we know
[37:50] it's not us holding ourselves but
[37:52] father you predestinated us for this
[37:54] time to stand on the word and
[37:56] and live the truth and manifest the word
[38:00] that's been coming forth lord so we pray
[38:02] you just bless the hearers that are
[38:04] hearing lord and give them the spirit to
[38:06] be able to do
[38:07] what they hear lord not just lord be a
[38:10] bystander but be a partaker
[38:13] of the manifestation of the word and
[38:15] lord we just pray that you would just
[38:17] bless this church lord and the different

[38:54] his mercy i mean let's go to exodus the
[38:57] first chapter
[38:59] exodus one
[39:12] exodus one
[39:20] let's um let's start reading that verse
[39:23] verse eight
[39:28] 1 and verse 8. the bible says now there
[39:31] arose up
[39:32] a new king over egypt which knew not
[39:34] joseph
[39:35] and he said unto the people behold the
[39:37] people of
[39:39] the children of israel are more and
[39:41] mightier than we
[39:43] my isn't that something
[39:47] come come on let us deal wisely with
[39:51] them
[39:52] let lest they multiply and it come to
[39:55] pass
[39:55] that when their fault when they're
[39:57] falling out
[39:58] any war they join also
[40:02] unto our enemies and fight against us
[40:04] and so
[40:06] get them up out of the land therefore
[40:10] they did set over them task masks to
[40:12] afflict them
[40:13] with their burdens and they built for
[40:16] pharaoh treasure cities
[40:18] feed them and ramses but the more
[40:22] they afflicted them the more they
[40:24] multiplied and grew
[40:26] they were grieved because of the
[40:28] children of israel
[40:30] my you mean to tell me the more pressure
[40:32] they put on
[40:33] the stronger they got
[40:38] sound like people are god to me amen
[40:41] let's go to joshua
[40:43] uh the first chapter
[40:50] joshua
[41:05] joshua chapter one um let's just read
[41:09] verse nine
[41:10] the bible says have not i commanded thee
[41:13] be strong and of a good courage
[41:15] be not afraid neither be thou dismayed
[41:19] for the lord thy
[41:20] god is with thee whether so thou goest
[41:24] amen the lord bless reading of his word
[41:26] you can have your seats
[41:31] by the grace of god we want to we want
[41:34] to use for a subject tonight
[41:36] unlocking the mystery of the believer
[41:40] unlocking the mystery of the believer
[41:44] now you know if we just take uh a
[41:47] natural type
[41:48] we know that uh spiritually we are
[41:52] called the bride amen
[41:53] and if you just take a natural type of a
[41:55] wedding
[41:56] you take everybody everybody is already
[41:59] seen but nobody knows who the bride is
[42:02] hallelujah you got you got the pastor up
[42:04] there you got all the officers
[42:06] you got the pastor you got the best man
[42:08] you got the gurusman you got the
[42:10] bridesmaid
[42:11] matrix of honor honor of guests but
[42:14] until that bride comes nothing else is
[42:17] taking place
[42:18] so you know the bride has always been a
[42:20] mystery hallelujah
[42:22] but church uh what unlocks the mystery
[42:25] of the bride
[42:26] speaking spiritually hallelujah but if
[42:28] we look right here
[42:30] in the book of exodus the bible said
[42:32] that there arose a pharaoh
[42:34] who realized that the slaves were
[42:37] stronger than they was
[42:39] think about that he he got a revelation
[42:42] and the people that he was persecuting
[42:44] he looked at them
[42:46] and he said in his mind if those people
[42:48] ever come together
[42:50] if those people ever realize who they
[42:54] are
[42:54] if they ever realize that they are
[42:57] stronger and mightier
[42:59] than the people that sitting on this
[43:01] throne if they ever realize
[43:03] if they could just come together and do
[43:06] things like sisters and brothers
[43:08] we're in trouble hallelujah in church
[43:11] today if we as a bride of people could
[43:14] realize
[43:15] that god made us the head and not the
[43:18] tale
[43:18] we could get further down the road but
[43:22] we have too many chiefs and not enough
[43:24] indians hallelujah
[43:26] we need to learn how to follow instead
[43:29] of always trying to lead
[43:31] and you know that was the demise of the
[43:34] children of israel
[43:35] they couldn't follow behind the one god
[43:38] was using to lead
[43:39] because somebody wanted some credit
[43:41] hallelujah so they could say
[43:43] i know god too church we're not in a
[43:47] time where we're trying to
[43:49] prove who knows god who don't know god
[43:52] we just want to make it in heaven
[43:55] hallelujah what i i was telling somebody
[43:58] one of the best things god did for me
[44:00] when i first got saved two things
[44:02] first he gave me a revelation of paying
[44:06] tithes
[44:10] that's a powerful revelation i'm gonna
[44:12] tell you how powerful it is
[44:14] that revelation is so powerful
[44:16] hallelujah i i
[44:18] i i started evangelizing in 2009 without
[44:21] a job and i'm still here
[44:22] in 2020
[44:27] did you hear me church did you hear me
[44:30] so when phase got tight
[44:32] i had a promise i had a promise that was
[44:35] unlocked
[44:40] i had a promise that would unlock a
[44:42] mystery
[44:43] in my life you know my neighbors brother
[44:45] solomon they would work a 9-5
[44:47] when they go home when they go to work
[44:49] i'm at home when they come back
[44:51] i'm at home when they go to school i'm
[44:53] at home and they're wondering how my
[44:55] bills get paid
[44:58] it was a mystery hallelujah but when you
[45:02] become obedient to god's word he will
[45:05] unlock things in your life
[45:06] that the average person cannot
[45:09] understand
[45:10] [Applause]
[45:11] [Music]
[45:13] i have that oh my praise god i had one
[45:16] brother come to my house and try to do
[45:17] some business one time
[45:18] he said he pulled up in the neighborhood
[45:20] and he said brothers can't stay out here
[45:25] he said he can't stay out here he said
[45:27] kept driving down and the houses got
[45:29] bigger and bigger he said he can't stay
[45:30] down here
[45:37] and they wonder how's he doing
[45:40] i ain't it's god
[45:44] church we fail to realize that god
[45:48] uses certain things to get the best out
[45:50] of us
[45:51] and tonight you know i kind of want to i
[45:54] want to encourage you
[45:56] because in this hour you know a lot of
[45:58] people fighting against what they
[46:01] believe
[46:02] you know a lot of people unsure what i
[46:04] want you to understand look at what god
[46:07] told joshua his church he said be strong
[46:10] and very courageous he said don't be
[46:14] dismayed now why would he tell joshua
[46:16] that at the beginning of his ministry
[46:19] before he even did anything god said
[46:21] joshua
[46:22] be shown he said now i'll tell you this
[46:24] again
[46:25] be strong he told me at least twice
[46:27] before he even did
[46:28] anything why god knew he was gonna have
[46:31] to fight
[46:33] so he put joshua's mindset in a mode
[46:35] that no matter what happens
[46:37] god told me to be strong and courageous
[46:41] be not dismayed by my light bill be not
[46:44] dismayed by the covenant we're not
[46:46] dismayed by the people backsliding
[46:48] being not dismayed but be so and very
[46:51] courageous
[46:53] church that's where we are there are
[46:56] giants
[46:56] in the land but they can be defeated
[47:00] [Music]
[47:02] because god puts you in a day where
[47:05] giants have to fall
[47:07] hallelujah but we know we see
[47:10] so much turmoil so much things going on
[47:13] in the world
[47:14] and people are wondering if they still
[47:18] believe the truth
[47:25] but when you when you think about look
[47:26] what god look what the scripture says
[47:29] about the children of israel again
[47:31] he says but the more they afflicted them
[47:34] the more they multiplied and grew
[47:38] and they were grieved because of the
[47:41] children of israel
[47:42] now look this is a prime example of who
[47:45] we really are
[47:46] pressure is supposed to bring out who
[47:49] you really are
[47:51] pressure is supposed to unlock the
[47:54] mystery
[47:54] of who you are holy not easy going god
[47:58] sent me a prophet and praise god i'm in
[48:00] church every night no
[48:01] it's the things you go through that
[48:04] shapes and forms you
[48:05] and brings out character hallelujah but
[48:08] you know
[48:09] people hate to be tested you know what
[48:11] if you don't be tested
[48:13] you'll never go to the next level
[48:16] so you got to go through something
[48:18] hardly but my old desire
[48:20] is to go through it like paul paul said
[48:23] for this purpose i came
[48:26] think about his purpose church he was
[48:28] bit by a snake hunter
[48:30] venomous snake he was he was in the sea
[48:33] of night and day
[48:35] man hey rip over five times four
[48:38] stripes stone through over the wall
[48:42] and paul said if i grow it i'm a glory
[48:44] in the things i suffer
[48:48] man how many of us give god praise
[48:51] hallelujah
[48:52] when we go through something where was
[48:54] the last time he said oh god thank you
[48:56] for my trials
[48:58] we don't talk like that but let me tell
[49:00] you something that's believable language
[49:03] that's believable language holy i got
[49:05] another scripture romans 4
[49:06] verse 20 holy when when abraham was
[49:09] going
[49:10] through his trouble the bible says that
[49:12] he got strong in faith
[49:15] the more he went through the stronger he
[49:18] got
[49:19] church that's our inheritance but you
[49:21] know what we go through things
[49:23] and we start to question in my bride
[49:26] lord why me because you have to become
[49:30] perfect hollywood
[49:32] church if if i can for a second i want
[49:35] to show you something
[49:38] you see this if you can't see it that
[49:41] mean you too far back
[49:44] this ain't no classroom
[49:48] we want to be right in the presence of
[49:49] god you see that that's a seed
[49:55] unless you had experiences with the seed
[49:57] before
[49:58] honey you don't know what kind of seed
[50:01] this is
[50:02] see every seed has a mystery that needs
[50:04] to be unlocked
[50:06] but there's only one process
[50:09] there's only one thing that the seed
[50:12] needs
[50:13] for it to get going
[50:14] [Music]
[50:17] and the first thing that gets it going
[50:20] ain't water
[50:23] it ain't sunlight no the first thing
[50:26] that gets the seed going is you have to
[50:29] plant it
[50:30] in dirt the only way i can get anything
[50:34] out of this i got to put it in a dirty
[50:37] filthy
[50:38] nasty condition
[50:40] [Applause]
[50:42] whoa but that condition is going to
[50:44] start the process
[50:46] of its transformation it needs dirt
[50:49] not just any kind of dirt but good dirt
[50:55] i messed up are you still here so that
[50:58] means that mess up was good
[51:04] i did some things i'm not proud of but
[51:07] i'm still here
[51:08] so what i did was good dirt
[51:13] i didn't told lies why i'm saved but
[51:15] that was a good dirt
[51:22] how did you think i know god wasn't
[51:24] proud of but you know what
[51:26] my seed is in good dirt because i need
[51:28] that dirt
[51:29] to come forth somebody say i'm good dirt
[51:36] because dust you are thus you shall
[51:39] return
[51:40] and for those who might get a feeling
[51:42] ain't no dirt oh yes you are
[51:44] yes you are because when your life
[51:48] leaves your body
[51:49] this right here gonna go back to dirt
[51:52] but the thing of it is
[51:53] what's important is the life inside of
[51:55] the shell
[51:57] but it needs a condition a dog
[52:02] dry
[52:05] dark dry no light no water
[52:09] filthy condition
[52:12] and unless it's put in that condition
[52:14] i'll never get anything out of it
[52:17] he said oh brother jesus put it in the
[52:19] presence of the lord in church
[52:21] no good it's sitting right there do you
[52:24] feel the holy ghost
[52:25] no good hallelujah this is the
[52:29] atmosphere of the holy ghost
[52:30] no good that seed will never bring
[52:32] anything forth
[52:34] until it's put in dirt
[52:38] you say brothers i went to church but
[52:40] where are you
[52:41] holy he says accept a grain of wheat
[52:44] hurry what happens
[52:45] it has to go in the ground it has to die
[52:48] it has to
[52:48] rot this life has to look
[52:51] stinking
[52:58] well god bless you my brother now
[53:04] you look at yourself and you know that
[53:06] you just filled the ranks
[53:08] you know you ain't nothing without the
[53:10] lord holy
[53:11] but you know what if you can see
[53:13] yourself like that
[53:14] you can see the grace of god and that's
[53:17] the reason why
[53:18] the people can't see the grace of god
[53:20] because they think they're somebody
[53:23] we ain't nothing but five and six feet
[53:25] of what
[53:26] dirt
[53:30] and i can take this you know the prophet
[53:32] god said the closest place to heaven
[53:34] is behind the pulpit now i'm gonna take
[53:36] this peach seed
[53:38] and put it in the closest place is it
[53:40] giving me anything
[53:42] it ain't gonna give me nothing i can lay
[53:44] down hallelujah and have jack preach
[53:47] holy brother smiley preach i preach
[53:50] brother biscuit priest
[53:51] on and on tim pruitt donny reagan
[53:53] everybody put that seat back there
[53:55] let them preach in the presence of god
[53:57] but unless this has dirt
[53:59] [Music]
[54:05] unless it has dirt the mystery will
[54:08] remain a mystery
[54:10] the only thing that can unlock it
[54:12] hallelujah the only thing that can bring
[54:14] it forth
[54:15] is a trial
[54:25] look look in the bible
[54:28] mostly every believer that came forth
[54:32] they came forth out of a trial
[54:35] holy we didn't know who they were until
[54:37] they were put under the microscope
[54:40] and then the real them i was preaching
[54:41] the message to real you the real you
[54:44] had to come out hallelujah and if i
[54:46] could just say you take moses hallelujah
[54:48] moses was born hallelujah under a decree
[54:51] of pressure hello he was but
[54:54] but that decree it didn't change what
[54:57] his mom and daddy saw
[54:58] they knew that their child was special
[55:01] and then hallelujah king
[55:02] pharaoh sitting out of the creek we're
[55:04] gonna kill all the young men we're gonna
[55:05] keep
[55:06] we're gonna keep the girls but we're
[55:07] gonna kill all the men don't that sounds
[55:09] like the world today
[55:10] where are the good men where are the men
[55:13] that's leading the children
[55:15] where are the men the good men in church
[55:32] in the strip club they had the ball game
[55:36] they doing all these things what is it
[55:38] it's a degree that's went out to kill
[55:40] our men
[55:42] because pharaoh know if i can get to men
[55:45] the women will struggle
[55:47] hallelujah but listen church and it's a
[55:50] sad place to be
[55:51] if you're a woman that don't want no
[55:52] handshape
[55:58] because you fall right on the ladder to
[56:00] see you see
[56:01] pressure will tell me who you are
[56:04] [Music]
[56:05] hallelujah but you look church you say
[56:08] okay let's just take moses moses
[56:11] hallelujah
[56:12] he was born a proper child you know when
[56:14] he was born his
[56:16] parents saw a lot of light came in the
[56:17] room but that still didn't bring out who
[56:19] he was
[56:21] the pill of fire over his head that
[56:24] still didn't unlock his mystery
[56:30] look what happened when that degree went
[56:32] out hallelujah
[56:33] josephine and amram they say no we ain't
[56:35] killing our baby
[56:37] i ain't giving my baby to the world i
[56:38] don't care who the president is
[56:42] i don't care they say this is a red
[56:44] state i ain't giving my baby to him
[56:46] i don't care if it is a blue state i
[56:48] ain't giving up giving my baby to jesus
[56:51] [Music]
[56:55] you know what it's imma hit this real
[56:57] quick and get off of it
[56:58] but it's amazing how many believers get
[57:01] caught up in politics
[57:05] when we know that church and state don't
[57:07] mix we know that god has nothing to do
[57:10] with politics
[57:11] when when christ came in because the
[57:13] sadducees and pharisees them democrats
[57:16] and republicans hallelujah they couldn't
[57:18] understand the word when it was being
[57:20] revealed
[57:20] why because they wanted everything
[57:22] politically correct
[57:24] jesus why didn't your disciples wash
[57:26] their heads jesus why didn't they bless
[57:28] their food
[57:29] jesus why are you doing this on the
[57:30] sabbath day they want everything
[57:32] politically correct
[57:33] [Music]
[57:37] but look church that didn't change
[57:40] amram and josephine it made
[57:44] who they really were come out hallelujah
[57:47] because they looked like just ordinary
[57:49] people till they had to sacrifice their
[57:51] child
[57:52] and they said no i ain't sacrificing my
[57:54] baby you know what i'm gonna do
[57:55] and you think about it this sounds crazy
[57:57] but this pressure
[57:59] made her do something she wouldn't
[58:00] ordinarily do on a regular day
[58:03] this pressure she said think about this
[58:05] she said you know what i'm gonna do
[58:06] i'm gonna take my baby my moses and i'm
[58:08] gonna put them in a basket and i'm a
[58:10] picture within without and i'm gonna put
[58:12] them in a now with crocodiles and
[58:13] pythons
[58:18] it seemed like that was more pressure
[58:21] putting the baby in a place
[58:22] that she couldn't control but what was
[58:25] it she was trusting in god
[58:28] see when you are a believer sister brown
[58:30] when pressure comes
[58:32] god is just trying to get you to trust
[58:34] him
[58:36] [Music]
[58:39] he ain't trying to make you quit he's
[58:41] trying to get you to trust him
[58:44] but what we do we get mad we fuss we
[58:47] switch churches we do all kind of stuff
[58:51] when all god is trying to do is get the
[58:53] real you to come out
[58:59] that brother preaching on me trying to
[59:00] get the real you to come out
[59:02] ain't nobody shake my hand you're trying
[59:03] to get the real you to come out
[59:05] someone's so sick i ain't going to that
[59:07] church you're trying to get the real you
[59:08] to come out
[59:10] haven't y'all realized covet has shown
[59:12] who the real believers are
[59:21] i was talking to a friend of mine in
[59:23] another country and we was talking about
[59:26] before the lock down after lockdown time
[59:28] to go back to church
[59:30] and he was having a vote to come back to
[59:31] church and the people voted no
[59:37] supposed to be believers they say no
[59:40] we're going to stay home and stream
[59:44] come on see what they want they want a
[59:46] ministry they can control
[59:48] they want a time they can control they
[59:51] want atmosphere they control
[59:52] and see right now they're watching me
[59:54] they're doing this
[1:00:02] turn that all the way down turn it down
[1:00:04] he too loud turn it down
[1:00:07] and they can go to a game with 70 000
[1:00:10] people
[1:00:10] streaming to the top of the lawn and
[1:00:12] they lose their mind
[1:00:15] but when they come to god they want more
[1:00:16] control
[1:00:18] oh honey wait a minute i gotta go feed
[1:00:20] me a sandwich
[1:00:23] that's what people want they want to be
[1:00:25] able to control everything but see god
[1:00:28] he wants us in a place where he wants us
[1:00:30] to develop trust
[1:00:32] hallelujah and you know church in this
[1:00:34] time and hour that we end
[1:00:36] pressure is the only thing that's going
[1:00:38] to bring out who you are
[1:00:40] but we are not to run from the pressure
[1:00:42] we ought to welcome the pressure
[1:00:45] holy we are to say thank you lord shape
[1:00:47] me move me for me
[1:00:49] into who you want me to be hallelujah
[1:00:52] but you look hallelujah
[1:00:53] mary if you go through your trial right
[1:00:56] you'll find yourself hallelujah stepping
[1:00:59] into things that god has already done
[1:01:02] because god don't change hallelujah look
[1:01:04] at hallelujah josephine what happened
[1:01:06] she said you know what i'ma put my son
[1:01:09] in a basket
[1:01:10] and i'mma pitch it within and without
[1:01:11] what was she doing she was tapping into
[1:01:14] deliverance
[1:01:15] that had already took place in an arc
[1:01:18] [Music]
[1:01:19] [Applause]
[1:01:22] but this time it wasn't a boat it was a
[1:01:24] basket this time it was noah
[1:01:26] it was moses hallelujah same scene
[1:01:29] hallelujah
[1:01:30] same god delivering in a time of
[1:01:33] tribulation hallelujah
[1:01:34] and if you go through your trial right
[1:01:37] you'll pick up that same god
[1:01:39] that had delivered in times before see
[1:01:41] god cannot change
[1:01:44] [Music]
[1:01:46] so if he did it before he'd have to do
[1:01:48] it again
[1:01:49] and you look hallelujah she was so
[1:01:51] inspired
[1:01:52] she said i'm not just gonna put him in a
[1:01:54] basket but i'ma slime it
[1:01:58] what was that when she was catching the
[1:02:00] inspiration she was unlocking a mystery
[1:02:04] what was it the mystery of the
[1:02:06] deliverance
[1:02:08] why because a child was the next
[1:02:10] deliverer
[1:02:16] oh my god and then she puts the baby she
[1:02:20] puts the baby don't get nervous don't
[1:02:21] buy the clothes
[1:02:22] she puts the baby in the basket and she
[1:02:25] freely gives him up
[1:02:26] and she lets him go down the river and
[1:02:29] she takes a hand off of it
[1:02:31] the prophet god said if you ever want
[1:02:33] god to move
[1:02:34] he said give god a communal hallelujah
[1:02:36] he said you committed to god
[1:02:38] take your hands off of it and leave it
[1:02:39] alone he said then god
[1:02:42] is obligated to answer that prayer and
[1:02:44] he said
[1:02:45] if you don't answer that prayer he said
[1:02:47] didn't you be certain of god
[1:02:49] [Music]
[1:02:53] hallelujah little church and then he got
[1:02:56] to a place
[1:02:57] where moses now is just freelance
[1:02:59] drifting
[1:03:00] but he wasn't by himself his sister was
[1:03:02] watching
[1:03:05] she was on their own look hardly
[1:03:06] sometimes you may feel like you're by
[1:03:08] yourself
[1:03:09] but god got somebody you ain't even
[1:03:10] expecting watching over you
[1:03:13] you don't even see it most didn't even
[1:03:15] know his sister was watching but she was
[1:03:17] watching over him hallelujah and she
[1:03:19] followed the basket
[1:03:20] all the way down look where the basket
[1:03:22] went the basket
[1:03:23] went in the hands of the enemy
[1:03:33] sometimes god will allow you to go into
[1:03:36] the hands of the enemy
[1:03:38] but it's his plan because you look
[1:03:41] church
[1:03:42] now pharaoh's daughter she knew all
[1:03:44] about the degree
[1:03:45] see look pressure holly situations
[1:03:48] brought out the real her what was her
[1:03:51] pressure
[1:03:52] she wanted a baby but had no man to have
[1:03:56] one
[1:03:59] so when she saw moses moses came
[1:04:02] drifting
[1:04:03] after she then took a bath and her hands
[1:04:05] made there now here comes a basket and
[1:04:06] they open it up and they say
[1:04:08] oh it's one of the hebrews and you know
[1:04:10] the hands may probably pull out their
[1:04:11] sword
[1:04:14] we gonna kill it it's a male you heard
[1:04:17] what pharaoh say
[1:04:18] let's drown it let's kill it you say
[1:04:19] stop wait don't do nothing
[1:04:22] why the bible says she had compassion
[1:04:28] god knows what he's doing he knows
[1:04:31] how to unlock the mystery of the
[1:04:34] believer
[1:04:35] when it looked like moses light was over
[1:04:37] god put him in a place of compassion
[1:04:44] you know what you ought to start doing
[1:04:46] for those of you who got bills and
[1:04:48] stuff you can't pay and you asking
[1:04:49] people you say hey um
[1:04:51] you know can y'all help me do this have
[1:04:53] mercy on when you send that bill off
[1:04:55] write a scripture on the envelope
[1:05:01] [Music]
[1:05:02] you know if they see it they're gonna
[1:05:05] have to go back and read it
[1:05:10] hallelujah so what i do is i write
[1:05:12] scriptures like oh no man nothing
[1:05:16] [Applause]
[1:05:18] greater is he that is in me than he that
[1:05:20] is in the world
[1:05:21] i just sent some stuff off and i said
[1:05:23] and i put psalms 1
[1:05:25] 112 and i think five on it hallelujah
[1:05:28] that god will give you
[1:05:29] favor with me
[1:05:30] [Music]
[1:05:32] hallelujah church we have to operate in
[1:05:35] who we are
[1:05:37] and you look now this pressure this
[1:05:39] pressure made joseph and amram give up
[1:05:41] the child
[1:05:42] now moses is floating down hello miriam
[1:05:45] is watching the whole situation
[1:05:46] the baby goes down into the hands of the
[1:05:48] enemy the enemy has compassion
[1:05:50] and then miriam comes out and says hey
[1:05:53] do you want me to get someone to nurse
[1:05:54] the baby
[1:05:58] she had to say yes because pharaoh's
[1:06:01] daughter
[1:06:02] was not with child so she couldn't feed
[1:06:04] the baby
[1:06:07] she got something but she couldn't take
[1:06:09] care of it
[1:06:10] she got something but she couldn't bless
[1:06:12] it so she had to get somebody else
[1:06:15] to put a blessing on it
[1:06:19] don't you let god give you something and
[1:06:21] you can't bless it
[1:06:26] god didn't give you a saturday night
[1:06:28] service and you ain't gonna bless it
[1:06:31] [Applause]
[1:06:34] you ought to be giving god praise
[1:06:39] church now the baby comes down
[1:06:42] hallelujah
[1:06:42] the enemy has the baby she has
[1:06:44] compassion miriam comes up and she says
[1:06:47] hey
[1:06:47] you want me to get one of the hebrew
[1:06:50] mothers to come nurse the baby
[1:06:51] she says yes my child yes my child go
[1:06:53] not even realizing that she's talking to
[1:06:55] his sister
[1:06:57] so all miracle dudes go back and say i'm
[1:06:59] going to get my mama
[1:07:01] let's get my mom god is in control
[1:07:05] god is in control when it looked like
[1:07:08] all was lost
[1:07:09] when they were put under so much
[1:07:11] pressure god was showing
[1:07:12] that he's still in control
[1:07:16] sometimes god will put you right in the
[1:07:18] midst of dirt
[1:07:21] to unlock you
[1:07:25] now look church he says you know you go
[1:07:27] to hebrews
[1:07:28] the bible says by faith moses refused to
[1:07:31] call
[1:07:32] be called the son of pharaoh's daughter
[1:07:34] why
[1:07:36] those people were nothing but good to
[1:07:37] him
[1:07:40] you ever thought about that
[1:07:44] let me back up a little bit let me back
[1:07:46] up joseph bear comes down
[1:07:48] she comes down and she comes to pharaoh
[1:07:50] she says hey yo
[1:07:51] she called the federal door and say um
[1:07:53] um the child told me that you needed
[1:07:55] someone to nurse the baby
[1:07:56] yes yes yes you nurse her and i will pay
[1:08:00] you
[1:08:02] sisters wouldn't you love to get paid
[1:08:04] for taking care of your child
[1:08:09] tell you about y'all mama would jump for
[1:08:11] joy if she get fifteen dollars for every
[1:08:12] time y'all asked for something
[1:08:15] jump for joy honey and you think about
[1:08:17] just just think about her
[1:08:19] just think about it boy jacob be like
[1:08:22] hey
[1:08:26] every time you ask for something god
[1:08:27] said okay i'm gonna pay you just do it
[1:08:29] i'm gonna pay you
[1:08:30] now joseph is getting paid to do what
[1:08:32] she automatically would have done
[1:08:35] hallelujah think about that our god is
[1:08:38] an awesome god
[1:08:40] what a wonderful god he is hallelujah so
[1:08:43] church we are not to be holding on to
[1:08:45] things of this world
[1:08:46] give it up and see what god will do all
[1:08:49] of them
[1:08:50] now she gives it up and now she's in a
[1:08:52] better situation
[1:08:53] look church not only is she getting paid
[1:08:56] but the whole
[1:08:57] living conditions have changed she's not
[1:08:59] raising moses in a tent
[1:09:00] or a cottage now she's raising her own
[1:09:03] child in the palace
[1:09:06] [Applause]
[1:09:12] it's crazy to me why people don't want
[1:09:13] to serve the lord
[1:09:17] he's never failed
[1:09:21] church now the same baby she put in the
[1:09:24] river
[1:09:25] holly it made the real her come out what
[1:09:28] did she do
[1:09:29] she began to trust and because she trust
[1:09:31] god
[1:09:32] let her raise that same child under
[1:09:34] better condition
[1:09:35] you know this time she ain't need her
[1:09:37] food stamp card
[1:09:40] [Music]
[1:09:42] everything was coming from the king
[1:09:46] church they were eating organic
[1:09:50] they were eating grass-fed plant-based
[1:09:54] this stuff they had no steroids in it
[1:09:56] they had no
[1:09:57] they were eating chipotle
[1:10:02] [Music]
[1:10:05] talk to me church now she was raising
[1:10:08] her son
[1:10:09] under a condition that she would have
[1:10:11] never been able to give him
[1:10:20] pressure began to unlock a mystery that
[1:10:23] she would never be able to pay god
[1:10:25] back for
[1:10:30] and we complaining about what we're
[1:10:32] going through
[1:10:33] god just trying to set you up
[1:10:45] [Music]
[1:10:47] lord set me up
[1:10:49] [Applause]
[1:10:51] set me up in a way lord

[1:11:00] me up
[1:11:01] [Applause]
[1:11:02] [Music]
[1:11:10] and one of my favorite proverbs that i
[1:11:14] like to say
[1:11:16] is the devil can't do nothing but what
[1:11:17] god allows
[1:11:21] if you ever get sick it's because you
[1:11:23] allowed it in your mind first
[1:11:27] are you ever going through something
[1:11:28] like boy i'm struggling that's because
[1:11:30] you accepted the struggle
[1:11:34] especially us as a black a black black
[1:11:36] folk black and brown people whatever you
[1:11:37] want to call it
[1:11:38] they get on my nerves bro how you doing
[1:11:40] what's going on boy i'm still in the
[1:11:41] struggle
[1:11:44] i'm like don't come don't don't talk
[1:11:45] that foolishness to me
[1:11:47] i ain't in no struggle my god is in
[1:11:50] control
[1:11:51] he said i'm the head and not the tail
[1:11:54] i'm blessed and not cursed holly
[1:11:56] i'm rich or not poor holier i'm saving
[1:11:58] that loss
[1:11:59] my eyes are open not blind i can hear
[1:12:02] i'm not death
[1:12:04] what kind of struggle are you talking
[1:12:06] about
[1:12:18] look now moses is been raised up in the
[1:12:22] palace
[1:12:23] and he's next in line to be king hello
[1:12:27] and while he's next in line to being
[1:12:29] king he had the best food
[1:12:31] the best teaching hallelujah the best
[1:12:34] training hallelujah moses
[1:12:36] was being built up to be the next
[1:12:38] pharaoh
[1:12:39] hallelujah but in that atmosphere
[1:12:42] hallelujah
[1:12:43] he began to feel a certain way
[1:12:46] all of a sudden the real moses started
[1:12:49] to come out
[1:12:51] his mystery the mystery of his seed
[1:12:54] began to be unlocked what happened he
[1:12:56] saw one of his brothers getting beat on
[1:12:59] how first of all how did he know that
[1:13:01] was one of his brothers
[1:13:03] when all he knew was the egyptians all
[1:13:05] his life
[1:13:06] [Music]
[1:13:10] they wasn't sitting at the same table
[1:13:12] they weren't having no fellowship
[1:13:15] when they saw moses they said oh king
[1:13:17] moses bowed down
[1:13:18] but some kind of way moses was
[1:13:20] connecting with them
[1:13:22] how the words of his mother
[1:13:29] well she was in the palace teaching him
[1:13:31] she said son i want you to remember
[1:13:32] there's something special about you
[1:13:35] there's not you're not
[1:13:36] you're not an egyptian you're a hebrew
[1:13:39] he brought it to my
[1:13:40] what what are you talking about all i
[1:13:42] know is this
[1:13:43] you know all i know is this you know
[1:13:46] this chipotle you know
[1:13:51] what are you talking about i've been
[1:13:52] drinking kombucha all my life
[1:13:55] [Applause]
[1:13:58] i'm good spring water
[1:14:04] fuji
[1:14:07] so moses we asked the question i began
[1:14:10] to think about this
[1:14:12] why was he connecting with something he
[1:14:15] knew nothing about
[1:14:18] how was he starting to connect with the
[1:14:20] slaves
[1:14:21] why was he starting to feel sorry for
[1:14:23] them
[1:14:24] what was happening let me read your
[1:14:26] scripture hallelujah
[1:14:29] in the in the in in the book of john
[1:14:32] chapter 15 he says
[1:14:33] now ye are clean through the word which
[1:14:37] i have spoken unto you
[1:14:38] holy and even in ephesians 5 he said
[1:14:41] he's talking about god presenting his
[1:14:43] church
[1:14:43] he said that he might sanctify and
[1:14:45] cleanse it with the washing of the water
[1:14:48] by the word
[1:14:49] and you know church the more moses real
[1:14:52] mother josephine
[1:14:53] spoke and told him who he was what was
[1:14:56] she doing
[1:14:56] she was washing off all the dirt that
[1:14:59] was buried around that seed
[1:15:03] all right back to the seed
[1:15:07] now to take this and i have to plant it
[1:15:10] in dirt
[1:15:10] good dirt and if you want to be
[1:15:12] technical the best kind of dirt
[1:15:20] say what you want the richest dirt
[1:15:24] it's dark black fine dirt
[1:15:29] hey i'm just telling what scientists say
[1:15:32] look it up and you know what they say
[1:15:35] the blacker the bear the sweeter the
[1:15:36] jews
[1:15:38] hallelujah church look
[1:15:41] you can't take this and put it in red
[1:15:44] clay
[1:15:45] and think you're gonna get peaches
[1:15:48] it has to be a ground with something in
[1:15:51] it that can
[1:15:52] unlock you mean to tell me it's the dirt
[1:15:58] oh it's the dirt that starts the process
[1:16:02] you can't put this in some gravel no it
[1:16:04] has to be pure
[1:16:06] dirt
[1:16:12] anybody going through something dirt
[1:16:17] but i want you to realize something he
[1:16:19] said all right
[1:16:20] i failed this good dirt
[1:16:23] because you still here good dirt listen
[1:16:26] to what the scripture says
[1:16:27] the scripture says hallelujah a corrupt
[1:16:30] tree
[1:16:31] can't bring forth good fruit he says
[1:16:34] good tree can't bring forth evil fruit
[1:16:35] holly
[1:16:36] so if you do something wrong but you
[1:16:38] still here
[1:16:39] trying to make it right that means you
[1:16:41] are good fruit
[1:16:44] that means you're a good tree hallelujah
[1:16:46] because when you look at the scriptures
[1:16:47] say
[1:16:48] a righteous man fallen seven times but
[1:16:51] he gets back up
[1:16:54] but it says the unrighteous on the other
[1:16:56] or i forget how the scripture exactly
[1:16:58] says it
[1:16:59] but he says that person that falls he
[1:17:01] continues and runs to mischief
[1:17:03] so what makes that person righteous he
[1:17:06] gets back up
[1:17:08] when he falls down when he has dirt in
[1:17:10] his life he cleans himself up
[1:17:12] and he keeps on pushing now you look at
[1:17:16] what does the dirt do
[1:17:17] what does dirt represent trials in
[1:17:19] tribulation
[1:17:22] our trials and tribulations what does
[1:17:25] that dirt do
[1:17:26] hey this dirt it smothers the seed
[1:17:30] no sunlight no water nothing it smothers
[1:17:33] and suffocates the shell and what does
[1:17:37] it do
[1:17:37] it takes the shell through a process
[1:17:39] where it breaks loose
[1:17:43] dirt dirt causes all of my troubles
[1:17:47] to separate from me
[1:17:53] thank god for my trials count them more
[1:17:57] precious than gold
[1:17:58] try it in the fire
[1:18:00] [Applause]
[1:18:09] you know why some of y'all ain't
[1:18:10] shouting because you ain't been
[1:18:21] you think that's a trial not ain't no
[1:18:24] trial
[1:18:27] ain't no trial because you can call
[1:18:29] somebody and get a ride
[1:18:31] ain't no trial a trial is when
[1:18:34] no matter what you do you can't help the
[1:18:38] situation
[1:18:42] look at the mystery i'm i'm jumping
[1:18:44] around a little bit
[1:18:45] but i hope you catch it look at how god
[1:18:48] unlocked moses mystery
[1:18:50] moses is at the red sea he can't go
[1:18:54] forward
[1:18:55] he can't go neither east or west and he
[1:18:57] can't go south
[1:18:58] because hallelujah the demons are on his
[1:19:00] trail
[1:19:01] and now god is going to unlock a mystery
[1:19:03] in him
[1:19:04] that he didn't even know was there
[1:19:07] but first things first god has to
[1:19:09] elevate us hallelujah
[1:19:11] to think higher of ourselves than what
[1:19:13] we think
[1:19:14] moses he comes to god hallelujah look
[1:19:16] church let's backtrack
[1:19:18] moses now he he's beginning to become
[1:19:21] he's beginning to come uncontent with
[1:19:24] being in the palace
[1:19:25] [Music]
[1:19:26] for no reason he eating good he dressing
[1:19:29] good
[1:19:30] he got the fires of the finest why is
[1:19:32] this man becoming discontent
[1:19:34] right the real hymn is coming out
[1:19:39] he's looking down at the hebrews being
[1:19:41] whipped and being being being taken
[1:19:42] advantage of
[1:19:43] and he's becoming more and more angry
[1:19:46] till one day he comes out and he sees
[1:19:49] the egyptian
[1:19:50] doing what he always do
[1:19:53] think about it this wasn't the first
[1:19:55] time moses saw one of the one of the
[1:19:56] slaves being taken advantage of
[1:19:59] but this time hallelujah the dirt was
[1:20:01] gonna pull away
[1:20:05] this time the shell was pulling off and
[1:20:08] now the germ is gonna come out
[1:20:10] hallelujah churchill right there that
[1:20:12] moment he saw that egyptian
[1:20:14] taking advantage of the hebrew and moses
[1:20:16] with that a man what you doing
[1:20:18] he said oh king moses he's always this
[1:20:20] he's always dead and next thing look for
[1:20:22] you no more
[1:20:23] pop over
[1:20:26] done pop his neck you know he had
[1:20:28] military training look church
[1:20:32] look at god the man sends out a degree
[1:20:37] to kill all of the men because he heard
[1:20:40] about god had a deliverer
[1:20:41] and then he turns around and raised the
[1:20:44] deliverer
[1:20:46] the very one he wanted to kill was a
[1:20:48] very what he raised up
[1:20:51] [Music]
[1:20:56] there's no god like jehovah there's no
[1:20:58] god like jehovah
[1:21:00] [Applause]
[1:21:03] the wisdom of man is foolishness to god
[1:21:07] now if you told pharaoh that moses
[1:21:11] was the deliverer that he wanted to kill
[1:21:13] he would say couldn't be i raised him
[1:21:17] but the very one he raised was the very
[1:21:20] one that was going to take his kingdom
[1:21:21] down
[1:21:23] that's why god let some of us go to the
[1:21:25] world
[1:21:26] he let us go out and listen to rap music
[1:21:28] and do all the stuff
[1:21:29] because once we got saved now we're body
[1:21:32] guards
[1:21:34] hallelujah so now we tell our children
[1:21:36] we tell you young people
[1:21:38] some of these sisters that went out and
[1:21:39] did what they supposed to do
[1:21:41] they tell these young girls now hey girl
[1:21:42] listen to me
[1:21:44] see now she becomes your armor bearer
[1:21:48] she's watching over your life hallelujah
[1:21:50] the very thing
[1:21:51] that satan pulled the idea to do she's
[1:21:54] become his enemy now
[1:22:02] look church moses pops a neck moses goes
[1:22:06] on the run
[1:22:07] you know i like the movie the ten
[1:22:08] commandments i say this all the time
[1:22:10] you know and and i like the part where
[1:22:13] you know moses on the run and the king
[1:22:15] he's almost the the old pharaoh he's
[1:22:17] almost about to die and
[1:22:18] he's so sad and then a woman comes up i
[1:22:20] forget her name
[1:22:21] never titilla whoever she was she comes
[1:22:23] up and says the only thing can make him
[1:22:24] smile is only one name
[1:22:27] the name of moses
[1:22:34] that's the only one that will bring joy
[1:22:37] in his life
[1:22:38] the one he loves moses
[1:22:42] but now moses is on the run the real
[1:22:44] moses is coming out hallelujah
[1:22:46] moses is on the run he's on the back
[1:22:48] side of the desert why because there was
[1:22:50] a woman back there who had children
[1:22:51] inside
[1:22:52] of them hallelujah hooray but not only
[1:22:55] that
[1:22:56] why why was it uh uh why was she the one
[1:22:59] that most supposed to want
[1:23:00] to marry because there was something in
[1:23:04] her
[1:23:04] that could unlock a mystery to humble
[1:23:07] moses
[1:23:08] [Music]
[1:23:15] cause evidently he had a temple just pop
[1:23:18] somebody's neck
[1:23:20] so he had to meet a woman that could
[1:23:22] calm him down
[1:23:23] you know brother brother say she was
[1:23:25] just as feisty as he was
[1:23:27] right and by the time
[1:23:30] she got through with him the bible says
[1:23:33] there was never
[1:23:34] a man meek is moses
[1:23:39] she knew how to calm that man down
[1:23:43] she had the mystery of humility
[1:23:51] [Music]
[1:23:55] there's something in you that can get
[1:23:57] something out of your husband
[1:23:59] that nobody else can get and likewise
[1:24:03] hallelujah but you look church holy
[1:24:07] moses before he went down there he was
[1:24:09] big and bad
[1:24:10] he was talking all that talk and then he
[1:24:12] met his wife you know in one place in
[1:24:13] scripture
[1:24:15] moses forgot to circumcise one of the
[1:24:17] kids she
[1:24:18] circumcised it and took the flesh and
[1:24:20] threw it at him
[1:24:21] and said you're a bloody husband to me
[1:24:24] you know that probably most probably
[1:24:25] dropped his head
[1:24:32] the mystery is being unveiled and now he
[1:24:35] gets back to god
[1:24:37] holy before he gets there look he had to
[1:24:40] get into a place where he could get
[1:24:42] so broken and so quiet hallelujah well
[1:24:44] he would wonder about
[1:24:45] all his life he's not thinking about the
[1:24:47] palace none of that stuff no more the
[1:24:48] mystery has been unlocked he had to get
[1:24:50] to a place
[1:24:51] where he would he he would listen to
[1:24:53] where he could hear his name
[1:24:55] being called out of a bush
[1:24:58] [Music]
[1:25:08] god took him on the back side of the
[1:25:10] desert hurry up
[1:25:12] when nobody else was just to speak to
[1:25:15] him
[1:25:19] and then god calls his name moses moses
[1:25:22] moses moses
[1:25:23] and the bible says moses went to see
[1:25:26] what was going on he went over there
[1:25:28] and god tells him take off your shoes
[1:25:29] holy ground then god begins to give him
[1:25:31] his commission
[1:25:32] and now listen to moses moses began to
[1:25:35] say thanks to god now moses said
[1:25:39] oh god i i i i just
[1:25:43] i just can't tell where that come from
[1:25:46] he was a general
[1:25:48] he could talk he was smart and
[1:25:49] everything what happened that wife
[1:25:54] she broke him down to where he couldn't
[1:25:55] even talk no more
[1:25:58] now he didn't got back to god he ain't
[1:26:00] even confident no more
[1:26:03] she then stripped him what was it that
[1:26:06] was her purpose
[1:26:08] because not god can use them because
[1:26:10] he's thinking as himself as what he
[1:26:12] should have always thought of himself
[1:26:14] nothing and now he comes to god and he
[1:26:17] says lord
[1:26:18] i just can't talk and now god is going
[1:26:20] to elevate the whole situation god said
[1:26:22] shut up moses
[1:26:24] and moses thinking i can't do this i
[1:26:25] can't do that now listen
[1:26:27] god is always going to elevate us into
[1:26:29] his thoughts and then he tells moses
[1:26:31] moses saying lord i'm nothing i can't do
[1:26:33] this he's like moses
[1:26:34] you be god
[1:26:38] and let aaron be your prophet hallelujah
[1:26:41] that's what god does when he begins to
[1:26:44] unlock the mysteries of your life
[1:26:46] he puts you in a position that you will
[1:26:48] never saw yourself
[1:26:54] little church and all of that started
[1:26:57] with dirt
[1:27:01] all of that started with a trial
[1:27:04] and i moses he comes back
[1:27:08] and i was just fast forward he's at the
[1:27:10] red sea and god
[1:27:11] already knew what kind of fruit
[1:27:15] was inside of him
[1:27:18] see the only way i can get fruit out of
[1:27:21] this is to plant it
[1:27:23] this is no good in this condition
[1:27:27] can't get no nourishment out of this
[1:27:29] would you like to go home and tell to
[1:27:30] cook you cook you a batch of peach seeds
[1:27:35] cook meals in pcs honey i'm home tonight
[1:27:38] i want some seeds
[1:27:39] no good no nourishment don't taste good
[1:27:42] or nothing
[1:27:43] but if you let this go through the
[1:27:45] process and grow you can eat peaches all
[1:27:47] night long
[1:27:50] and those pieces will put the
[1:27:52] nourishment
[1:27:53] back in your body holy church you want
[1:27:55] nourishment in your church
[1:27:56] you got to produce some fruit
[1:28:01] because that's where the life is the
[1:28:03] life is inside your fruit hallelujah
[1:28:05] because once this grows honey and pushes
[1:28:08] our branches
[1:28:08] it pushes our fruit holly the tree is no
[1:28:11] good the leaves are no good
[1:28:12] the branches are no good what good is
[1:28:14] the tree
[1:28:16] until the fruit come
[1:28:19] oh brother i'm in the message what good
[1:28:22] is it with no fruit
[1:28:26] holy church now moses gets to the point
[1:28:30] the way he says
[1:28:31] he refused to be identified the people
[1:28:34] ain't never did no wrong to him
[1:28:36] now the mystery of who he is begins to
[1:28:38] come out don't get nervous don't body
[1:28:39] clothes
[1:28:40] the mystery of who he is begins to come
[1:28:42] out hallelujah
[1:28:43] and now he finds himself being
[1:28:45] identified with something that he can't
[1:28:47] explain
[1:28:49] what was it life was coming forward now
[1:28:51] church you take the sea you put it in
[1:28:53] dirt
[1:28:54] dirt smothers it hungry dirt starts to
[1:28:56] process
[1:28:57] it dries it out makes it rot and the
[1:29:00] shell
[1:29:01] drops away once that shell drops away
[1:29:04] then it begins to fill the heat
[1:29:11] see you don't feel the heat in the shell
[1:29:13] no
[1:29:15] it's still smothered around dirt ain't
[1:29:17] nothing coming forth hallelujah
[1:29:19] but it's the dirt that dries it out oh
[1:29:21] yeah it's the dirt
[1:29:23] that makes the shark pull away harley
[1:29:26] smothers it and then that shell drops
[1:29:29] off
[1:29:29] nobody else sees it dropping off either
[1:29:33] and once it drops off nobody even acts
[1:29:36] about it again
[1:29:41] stop worrying about the shock let them
[1:29:42] go do it let them go
[1:29:44] do whatever they do we looking for life
[1:29:47] hallelujah so once the shuck drops off
[1:29:50] now that seed
[1:29:51] it feels the presence of the sun where
[1:29:54] in the dirt

[1:33:34] in an area much to drive for survival
[1:33:39] that's why god didn't let the real you
[1:33:41] come out in a pentecostal church
[1:33:44] or let the real you come out of the
[1:33:46] baptist or catholic church
[1:33:47] the atmosphere was too dry they couldn't
[1:33:49] keep pouring on the seeds so it can grow
[1:33:51] so that way god didn't let you come into
[1:33:53] your full potential until you came into
[1:33:55] truth
[1:33:57] because once you came into truth you
[1:33:59] could get gus shout out to gusher
[1:34:01] gushing out the gusher experience has
[1:34:03] experienced
[1:34:04] true experience but listen he said it
[1:34:08] would
[1:34:08] it would risk coming to life in an area
[1:34:10] much to drive for survival
[1:34:12] it needs to know that the water supply
[1:34:15] is adequate
[1:34:16] to support it hallelujah he said until
[1:34:20] it can send its roots down to deep
[1:34:23] layers
[1:34:24] where it's almost likely more moisture
[1:34:27] what happens to a sea or tree
[1:34:30] when it's under strong winds
[1:34:34] when it's under strong winds the roots
[1:34:37] go
[1:34:38] deeper the trial of that tree
[1:34:41] crosses causes it to grow deeper
[1:34:46] the more it blows the more it bends the
[1:34:48] deeper those roots go
[1:34:51] so it needs that kind of wind it needs
[1:34:54] why you thinking palm trees
[1:35:01] cuz i'm roof real deep
[1:35:04] real deep
[1:35:08] what's holding it
[1:35:12] it's the trial of the winds every year
[1:35:16] there's some trees out here in florida
[1:35:19] that won't survive in arizona
[1:35:21] because of the climate
[1:35:25] those take those say take these same
[1:35:26] palm trees put them in the desert
[1:35:28] they'll die
[1:35:29] but take these same palm trees put them
[1:35:31] in a hurricane and it'll live
[1:35:35] [Applause]
[1:35:40] i wasn't born to be in the desert i was
[1:35:43] born to be the hurricane
[1:35:45] [Applause]
[1:35:47] hallelujah i'm a hurricane tree
[1:35:51] my food come forth in the midst of a
[1:35:54] hurricane
[1:35:59] come on somebody i remember i came down

[1:36:04] and hurricane dennis was down here and
[1:36:06] we were doing the first meeting or
[1:36:07] whatever
[1:36:08] and hurricane dean's in miami holly and
[1:36:10] the wheels of blow they were so strong
[1:36:12] we was going by the west coast everybody

[1:36:18] church
[1:36:22] we going to church and check them
[1:36:24] smiling everybody's turning around like
[1:36:26] ain't nothing going on
[1:36:27] people going to get the cash
[1:36:32] i'm like they don't feel these wheels
[1:36:36] see it wasn't none for them they were
[1:36:38] born in these conditions
[1:36:40] [Applause]
[1:36:44] they were born in these conditions they
[1:36:47] were put down here to survive
[1:36:50] oh they've been through hurricane have a
[1:36:52] hurricane have a hurricane
[1:36:54] so you say come on dennis we will
[1:36:57] survive
[1:36:59] but these snowbirds come down here oh my
[1:37:00] god i'm going back to new york
[1:37:03] why because they're being grafted in
[1:37:08] they wasn't born here
[1:37:09] [Applause]
[1:37:13] and the only way you're gonna survive
[1:37:15] living this message of the hour
[1:37:16] is if you born into it you can't be
[1:37:19] grafted in
[1:37:23] in church i kid you not i'm looking
[1:37:26] around like these people crazy
[1:37:29] there's a hurricane out here they told
[1:37:30] my day going to church
[1:37:32] and when i'm i'm kidding
[1:37:38] that's how hard the wind is blowing and
[1:37:41] we went in church
[1:37:43] and i had to preach tonight and i could
[1:37:44] just feel the fear
[1:37:46] i see people acting like they're good
[1:37:48] but i say but they scared
[1:37:51] and when i didn't board up housing and
[1:37:53] some of y'all got boy y'all like
[1:37:55] y'all like home depot
[1:37:58] y'all can board up a house like it ain't
[1:37:59] nothing
[1:38:01] put me out here my house will be flooded
[1:38:03] why because i wasn't born in these
[1:38:04] conditions
[1:38:05] holly but because you are here and
[1:38:08] you've gotten accustomed to it
[1:38:09] you know how to overcome it hallelujah
[1:38:13] so church you know we did we got out i
[1:38:15] got up and preaching i said you know
[1:38:16] what
[1:38:16] the devil is trying to stop this meeting
[1:38:18] trying to make us afraid at least he was
[1:38:20] trying to make me afraid
[1:38:24] so we prayed hallelujah we prayed
[1:38:27] against the storm you know what it
[1:38:28] left miami and went up the other side
[1:38:31] and we had church the rest of the
[1:38:32] weekend
[1:38:34] but see sometimes adversity brings out
[1:38:37] who you are
[1:38:38] trials and tribulation brings out the
[1:38:40] real you it took hallelujah
[1:38:43] it took an atmosphere of prostitution
[1:38:46] for for for um rahab to be in position
[1:38:50] to receive the spies
[1:38:55] listen to this i think i'm gonna shake
[1:38:57] your boots if she wasn't a prostitute
[1:39:00] she would have never been in position
[1:39:02] [Music]
[1:39:08] remember remember remember this good
[1:39:11] dirt
[1:39:15] she was good dirt even though she was
[1:39:18] she had a life of prostitution
[1:39:20] she was good dirt because through her
[1:39:22] came jesus christ
[1:39:24] through her came boaz to marry a roof
[1:39:30] then came jesse obed did came david
[1:39:33] there came
[1:39:33] jesus holy so that prostitute had to be
[1:39:37] in position
[1:39:38] so every other seed that was on that
[1:39:40] tree when it was this high can come
[1:39:42] forth
[1:39:45] remember the proper guard say every
[1:39:48] bushel that's in this right now
[1:39:50] when the tree gets this big it's already
[1:39:52] in it thousands and thousands and
[1:39:55] thousands of peaches
[1:39:56] is already in it
[1:40:06] listen
[1:40:08] it says germination begins
[1:40:12] when water penetrates the seed coat
[1:40:16] and initiates chemical change within the
[1:40:19] tissues inside
[1:40:22] listen to this once begun
[1:40:25] these changes can't be reversed
[1:40:31] if you ever come in contact with god
[1:40:36] it doesn't matter what kind of trial you
[1:40:38] go through
[1:40:39] it can't be reversed if he
[1:40:43] ever takes you behind the veil and
[1:40:46] reveals his mystery to you
[1:40:47] he can't give you back ask jacob about
[1:40:51] it
[1:40:51] he got a woman that he didn't want but
[1:40:53] she went in the chamber
[1:40:54] once she got in the chambers he was hers
[1:41:00] because she knew his secrets she knew
[1:41:03] all the mysteries about jacob hallelujah
[1:41:05] so jacob couldn't have a woman out there
[1:41:06] walking around knew everything his wife
[1:41:08] knew
[1:41:10] so he had to wife her up hallelujah
[1:41:13] all right all right
[1:41:16] he had to because she'd be walking
[1:41:18] around and say i know what y'all
[1:41:20] yeah i know girl i've been in that
[1:41:21] chamber he couldn't have somebody out
[1:41:24] there like that so he had to keep her
[1:41:25] that's why he couldn't give her back
[1:41:27] so he said you know what i'm gonna do i
[1:41:28] still got more dirt in my life so i'm
[1:41:30] gonna work seven more years
[1:41:36] let me close this up he said it can't be
[1:41:40] reversed
[1:41:40] water supply stops and the purpose until
[1:41:42] it continues
[1:41:43] the seed dies hardly so church once god
[1:41:47] ever deals with you if he ever deals
[1:41:49] with you gets you in a place
[1:41:51] where that shock breaks off and life
[1:41:53] starts to come out the ground
[1:41:54] it's over
[1:41:58] can't get a man in the body it don't
[1:42:01] matter
[1:42:02] what they do in this world it's over
[1:42:05] i ain't going nowhere they ain't got the
[1:42:08] problem you got to prove you got to show
[1:42:09] me some special quote
[1:42:10] about the prophet said is the problem
[1:42:12] i'm convinced
[1:42:16] you ain't got to take me to a mountain
[1:42:18] you ain't got to take me to a cave
[1:42:20] you ain't got to take me to indiana i'm
[1:42:22] convinced
[1:42:24] you say what makes you convinced by what
[1:42:26] he did in my life
[1:42:30] it ain't the life of the prophet that
[1:42:32] keeps me steadfast
[1:42:34] no it's what god did in me
[1:42:37] [Applause]
[1:42:38] i knew what i was i know what i used to
[1:42:42] be
[1:42:42] i know where i used to go there's been a
[1:42:45] change in me
[1:42:49] and you can say what you want to say
[1:42:50] about the prophet but i know
[1:42:52] what god did in my life and i know what
[1:42:56] listening to the opening of this word
[1:42:58] has done in me
[1:43:05] so you can go back and say you know they
[1:43:07] never found this
[1:43:08] and they ain't none of my business
[1:43:13] ain't none of my business you know when

[1:43:24] exercise ain't no good
[1:43:26] you know sometimes people being there

[1:43:33] technique right
[1:43:35] in church when it comes to who we are in
[1:43:37] god sometimes it's the technique
[1:43:39] you know when it comes to all these
[1:43:40] different things and all this people
[1:43:42] listen people that
[1:43:43] i got to prove those finest about the
[1:43:45] bible and all this stuff all this
[1:43:46] nonsense
[1:43:47] church you got to know where you stand
[1:43:52] if you can't look look you want to know
[1:43:54] how to witness the message
[1:43:56] tell somebody what god did in you
[1:44:00] when you came into this truth tell what
[1:44:03] god did in your life
[1:44:04] that's the that's the message of the
[1:44:06] hour
[1:44:09] a living written a pistol
[1:44:13] but you know i'm to a place now you know
[1:44:14] like i said i'd be in the gym people
[1:44:16] doing stuff wrong
[1:44:17] i just tell you says as i say cup i'm
[1:44:19] mind my business
[1:44:21] and once i say that you look around you
[1:44:22] know somebody ain't doing something
[1:44:23] right
[1:44:26] [Music]
[1:44:28] and they know i'm snitching
[1:44:33] so when it's my turn you know what they
[1:44:34] do they shout out my words
[1:44:37] i mind my business because they know it
[1:44:40] works
[1:44:41] church we got something that works
[1:44:43] hallelujah
[1:44:44] and if we just stick with the pattern
[1:44:46] life will come forward
[1:44:48] hey don't get so bogged down with dirt
[1:44:50] you got to have dirt all of us
[1:44:52] everybody need dirt all of us i might
[1:44:55] deal with this tomorrow but you
[1:44:57] understand
[1:44:58] people got dirt in their lives while
[1:45:00] they're filled with the holy ghost
[1:45:10] but that doesn't change the life of the
[1:45:11] seed because you put it in dirt but the
[1:45:14] life doesn't change
[1:45:16] hallelujah look filled with the holy
[1:45:18] ghost
[1:45:20] the prophet lied
[1:45:26] huh come on somebody
[1:45:30] chipping out the back door i ain't here
[1:45:35] with the holy ghost seeing visions
[1:45:37] having prayer lines
[1:45:39] being vindicated and got a lying spirit
[1:45:42] on
[1:45:45] but you know what that was good dirt
[1:45:49] that's all right
[1:45:53] i ain't telling you it's okay to lie but
[1:45:54] what i'm telling you god uses dirt to
[1:45:57] bring out things in your life so you can
[1:45:58] continue to grow
[1:46:00] and then once god dealt with that
[1:46:02] hallelujah let me let me leave that
[1:46:04] alone
[1:46:07] but church this is no good
[1:46:11] until it's planted it grows and it comes
[1:46:13] back to this again
[1:46:16] you understand what i'm saying and the
[1:46:18] only way this i can get this again
[1:46:20] is if i eat the fruit
[1:46:27] because i never get the seed after i
[1:46:29] plant it
[1:46:31] after i plant it it's done the only way
[1:46:34] i can get this life again
[1:46:35] is if i eat the fruit and the only way
[1:46:39] we will get the things that we've been
[1:46:41] studying
[1:46:41] in malachi 4's message the message of
[1:46:43] jesus christ
[1:46:44] is if we eat the fruit
[1:46:48] if we eat the word hallelujah because he
[1:46:51] said drink in and what
[1:46:52] push out drink it and push out but the
[1:46:55] thing of it is church
[1:46:56] and ain't just drinking to push out you
[1:46:58] got to drink
[1:46:59] in more than what you need
[1:47:05] because you don't drink anymore than
[1:47:06] what you need that's just enough to keep
[1:47:08] you growing
[1:47:11] and what good is a tree if it ain't
[1:47:13] pushing out no fruit
[1:47:15] i'll give you a prime example you know i
[1:47:17] hadn't told the story before
[1:47:19] but you know we we get so upset you know
[1:47:22] i'm almost about to close don't get
[1:47:23] nervous
[1:47:24] we get so upset when people talk about
[1:47:26] us they say things and this and that
[1:47:28] you know what i mean sometimes church
[1:47:30] it's good not to give people explanation
[1:47:33] let them make up their own story let
[1:47:35] them let them just
[1:47:37] just tell you on the move let them do
[1:47:39] whatever they want
[1:47:42] let them make up their own stuff as long
[1:47:44] as you know
[1:47:46] who you are logan you know
[1:47:51] who your god is but we're too busy
[1:47:54] trying to
[1:47:54] look a certain way in the eyes of the
[1:47:56] people
[1:47:57] forget all that stuff long as you're
[1:48:00] good with god
[1:48:01] but you know i always tell a story it
[1:48:03] was a it's a young boy they're
[1:48:05] encouraged to be a preacher he's going
[1:48:07] to church
[1:48:08] musician y'all can come he was going to
[1:48:11] church and you know all the young people
[1:48:12] you know how they do when you young it's
[1:48:13] like
[1:48:14] boy you going to be a preacher when you
[1:48:16] grow up boy when you grow up you're
[1:48:17] going to be a preacher
[1:48:18] you know that's how they do they put
[1:48:19] that in the little kid's head and he be
[1:48:21] coming to tell you like
[1:48:23] damn your father you know how you're
[1:48:26] preaching
[1:48:28] you know he keeps doing it and keep
[1:48:30] doing it he become one where he grow
[1:48:32] grow a little bit didn't begin to handle
[1:48:33] the word you know he started turning
[1:48:35] into a little preacher
[1:48:37] you know and then if it's a real gift
[1:48:38] there it started to come out hardly
[1:48:40] and if it's a real gift there he ain't
[1:48:42] gonna spare the feelings of the people
[1:48:45] and then that's when you see if they
[1:48:47] really want to be a preacher or not
[1:48:51] because the story of this young man when
[1:48:53] he became a preacher he stayed right
[1:48:55] with the word
[1:48:56] so all those that recruited him when
[1:48:58] they were doing wrong he blasted them
[1:49:01] and then they started tearing them down
[1:49:04] ah
[1:49:04] boy you ain't called and you ain't
[1:49:05] dissing how this is that blah blah blah
[1:49:08] he got so discouraged till he quit
[1:49:09] preaching
[1:49:11] he was throwing a little dirt on dirt
[1:49:13] ain't supposed to make you quit
[1:49:15] dirt is supposed to make you grow
[1:49:20] y'all need to parallel that your trials
[1:49:23] are to make you grow
[1:49:24] not to make you quit
[1:49:28] look church abraham hallelujah had a
[1:49:31] lying spirit in him
[1:49:32] but god had to put him under pressure so
[1:49:34] that lie can come out
[1:49:36] and then once it came out god dealt with
[1:49:38] him and abimelech in the whole country
[1:49:40] and you never heard of abraham line
[1:49:42] again
[1:49:45] [Music]
[1:49:48] church the young man now all the people
[1:49:51] that supported him
[1:49:53] now they hating on him so he goes to the
[1:49:55] bishop bishop
[1:49:57] you know all these people that pray for
[1:49:58] me to be a preacher now they all turn
[1:50:01] their back on me
[1:50:02] all the people who cheer for me now they
[1:50:04] hate to see me coming
[1:50:06] because they say i'm too saved now you
[1:50:08] ever heard that one
[1:50:10] he too said you know church and then the
[1:50:12] preacher's bishop said come here son
[1:50:14] look out this window he said what you
[1:50:17] see he said i see two trees say what
[1:50:18] kind of tree you see
[1:50:19] he said oak tree and a pecan tree he
[1:50:22] said yeah but what do you see
[1:50:24] he said what's under that oak tree he
[1:50:25] said nothing he said what's under that
[1:50:27] pecan tree he's a sticks rocks bottles
[1:50:29] shoes everything
[1:50:31] he said you know why all that stuff is
[1:50:32] under the pecan tree and not under the
[1:50:34] not under the oak tree he said because
[1:50:36] the oak tree ain't got nothing nobody
[1:50:38] wants so they don't throw at it
[1:50:40] he said but that pecan tree got a lot of
[1:50:42] stuff people want so they throw at it
[1:50:44] if somebody's throwing at you is because
[1:50:46] you got something they want
[1:50:48] if it ain't none of your tree nobody
[1:50:50] don't want that
[1:50:51] if ain't nobody jealous ain't nobody
[1:50:53] talking about you ain't nobody saying
[1:50:55] that
[1:50:56] you ain't got no fruit that nobody wants
[1:50:58] but if you got fruit somebody won't they
[1:51:00] got to throw at it they got to shake the
[1:51:02] tree
[1:51:03] they got to do something because they
[1:51:04] hungry
[1:51:07] [Music]
[1:51:12] y'all know you know i remember you told
[1:51:16] that story about the mango say all your
[1:51:17] whole family watching that mango
[1:51:19] everybody looking at it can't wait till
[1:51:21] it drops
[1:51:22] and then somebody snuck everybody
[1:51:27] why because everybody in the house
[1:51:30] knew what that fruit tastes like

[2:05:07] talk about that seed
[2:05:09] and how it has it has to
[2:05:12] go through some dirt you know when a
[2:05:15] farmer or
[2:05:17] whoever is planting that seed
[2:05:20] sometimes the dirt is just so
[2:05:22] [Music]
[2:05:25] so messy that they have to put gloves on
[2:05:28] they don't want to get their hands too
[2:05:29] dirty right and you know they they
[2:05:32] or if they get their hands too dirty
[2:05:34] then they're going inside
[2:05:36] later in the evening to wash off and off
[2:05:38] their hands
[2:05:39] but it's in conditions like that that
[2:05:42] god brings the best things forth for my
[2:05:44] life
[2:05:46] and you know just just i just love the
[2:05:49] way the holy spirit just kind of comes
[2:05:50] and ministers grace
[2:05:52] to our hearts sometimes you think about
[2:05:55] what you
[2:05:56] what you're what you've done and what
[2:05:57] you're in but it's it's good dirt it's
[2:05:59] good dirt it's good dirt right
[2:06:01] some of the mistakes that we made god
[2:06:03] knows exactly what he's doing all things
[2:06:05] are working together for good
[2:06:07] because we love god and we're called
[2:06:08] according to his purpose
[2:06:10] and i tell you i just i just appreciate
