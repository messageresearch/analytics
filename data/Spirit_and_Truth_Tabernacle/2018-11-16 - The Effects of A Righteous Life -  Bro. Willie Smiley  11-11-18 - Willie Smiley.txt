River I'm kind of reminded of the scripture when the angel called who is word come and take the book and then loose the seals and John was looking around and I begin to weep no man was worth you know no man was worthy and and you know immediately though his crying stopped because there was a word the one a man and aren't you glad for that one this morning you know you know we worship a lot of things we worship cars clothes we worship you know we worship men and we idolize the mean but you know what nobody was worthy to take the book is that right and then loose the seals thereof but the worthy one and that's Christ Jesus all mine hey man let's just buy heads for a word of Prayer this morning most gracious Heavenly Father we just come this morning to give thanks on brains we thank you this morning because you are worthy you were worthy you are world and we we don't want we didn't come to the worship creation for the Creator we come to look to you we become the worship we realize one to the profit we was created to worship you we when your mind before the foundations of the world because of that we hear Lord God not looking to a man we're looking at Jesus Christ we trust that father that bless brother Roosevelt this morning back home bless the saints out in Arizona brother jacket different was it continued to be with them in protecting the train home safely and the law we here this morning to feed upon a life so we trust that folks didn't come to see a man to hear from a man we created to take control of human instrumentality and say something that'll be edified this morning and we'll be so careful to give you the praise glory not afford in Jesus Christ wonderful name let's get our Bibles out this morning it's it's good to be here once again it's always be a good to be able to come and the fellowship with spirit and truth Tabernacle I'm gonna be looking in the book of Philippians this morning just remember your pastor brother Jack and all of the saints that went out to Arizona we had the invite but things didn't work out for us to go so he asked me what I fill in and I'm always grateful for the opportunity to be able to come and to try to share something that will be edifying to this portion of the body of Jesus Christ let's pray for Outlook assembly in Okeechobee this morning trust that God are used by the Roosevelt but it's it's always good to be here I always enjoy my my time of fellowship with you all and it's just good to see all of the smiling faces y'all are smiling our child a man is always good to see my friend in the back brother Guerin I don't think he was here the last time I came but God made a way he's always on our heart you know I like that song better son it's just a mountain that's it's all it is I think I think what happens is we fail to realize who we are a lot of times and and what's been given you know one of the things I like the property talks about Jesus Christ being a master of circumstances one day we're gonna learn how to master our circumstances by the word until then we're gonna be constantly up and down and and defeated but one day we're gonna get a complete revelation of who we actually are in Christ Jesus and what's been given to us right until then we're gonna be up and down we're gonna be a yo-yo but once we learn who we are we're going to stop all of that and I'm not worried is that right let us let us look in the scriptures this morning we we want to start at the first verse Philippians chapter 1 it says Paul and Timothy is the servant of Jesus Christ to all the Saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi with the bishops and deacons grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ I thank my god upon every remembrance of you always in every prayer of mine for you all making requests with joy for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now being confident of this very thing that he which has begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ even at is his meat for me to think this of you all because I have you in my heart it in as much as both in my bonds and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel ye all are partakers of my grace for God is my record how greatly I longed after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ and this I pray that you'll love me about yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment that ye may approve things that are excellent that ye may be sincere with our offense til the day of Christ being filled with the the fruits of righteousness which are by Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God but I would that you should understand Berlin that the things which happen unto me have fallen out rather until the furtherance of the gospel so that my bonds in Christ are manifested in all the palace and in all in all other places and many of the Brethren in the law of West and confidence by my barns are much more bold to speak the words without fear so indeed preach Christ some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife and some also a goodwill made a lord out of blessing to the reading of his word this morning you may be seated we want to use as a topic a topic the effects of a righteous life and as a context the response of the current Christian life one of the things we we realize true Christianity is based upon more than just being excited it's it's it's you know people think that their Christian because they run around church and that you know they feel goose bumps and things of that nature but first and foremost is something that you can't get away from you must be born again is that right I think the new birth is the foundation of the pyramid is that right you've got to be be born again you you can't venture up with first without being born again amen I believe that you know it character character is a big part of this thing and I think sometimes we we fail we we approach Christianity I think a lot of times but we approach it by a lack of understanding I think the manifestation of the character of Jesus Christ is is the important thing for me is that right I enjoy being excited y'all know me I like the worship I like to praise God every now and then I even like the shower but but I realize you know it's something that's that's beyond that because we've seen that we've seen people excited and we've seen people run around the church and things of that nature and then we've seen people totally disappear right y'all come on without Church with me we've seen people totally disappear we've heard people say well I believe God Center proper things of that nature and then you know the whole confession begins to change and this is why Jesus said it's so important that a person is born again said verily verily you must you must be born again and it's it's not it's not anything that you could get around it's something that that must take place that's there's got to be a change that that takes place in you because without that you'll never be able to understand the kingdom of God you'll never really understand the Word of God youyou might have some intellectual conception you might by being smart can read and understand maybe the you know be able to quote back but you'll never really be able to understand amen the things of God without being born again so you know that that's important for the Church of the Living God I think that that's that's a part of Christendom that we could never get away from you must be born again every individual no matter how good you look how good you smell this morning you got to be born again yeah a lot of priests with me this morning you you you can't get around right everything hinges on your new birth experience we don't go somewhere I'm not gonna bother y'all too much this morning but I'm just trying to get the itself out of the way so the Holy Ghost can do some winning this morning but but it's important from the youngest to the oldest you go nowhere without being born again it takes it takes the life of Christ right amen it takes the life of Christ see it's you know I realize something it's just not me it's it's the working of Christ in me pricing you the hope of glory is that right amen because if it's me boy I do some crazy stuff if it's me I'll say some crazy things right if it's if it's just me my emotions are you know up and down but but it's Christ in the church right the acts of the Holy Spirit wasn't just a group of men right and it was Christ in the church operating through men and that's what it's got to be a man in the hour that we live in is that right it's Christ in the church doing the work right living the life see that when that revelation breaks it does away with our struggle right because we think that we we gotta be good and we gotta be no you get the life of Christ and Christ of maturing you and the things that you thought were not possible will be possible the things that you thought you wouldn't be able to overcome you'll find yourself overcoming see people struggle to try to try to make themselves a Christian you you are Christian in the life of Christ we know we know brother branham taught on on on on the progression the three stages right but you don't want to stop at justification and sanctification you want to go all the way into Christ so many people stopped short where I believe Jesus you just justified you need to be sanctified and feel right and then amen grow up in God grew up in God find your place right in Christ hip-hip all Paul was was was right into the Philippians Church and I you know I do things a little bit differently God builds a minister and we all ain't the same and I trust that y'all don't think that I'm gonna preach like brother Jack that's my brother-in-law but I'm different I look different I'm tall he's short I'm being here's a little small and we see things just a little bit differently and and you know we sometimes I find people people we want to put everybody in the box and and we want to clone everybody to a certain individual I often tell my church that looked at would be messed up if everybody around the world was a brother smiling lord have mercy did your man you you get tired of me everywhere you look every man that came to the pulpit dressed like me act like me lord help her mercy we you know glory to God but but God has a Gaza God of variety I thank God for that diversity right but Paul what Paul here he says I thank my god upon every remembrance of you now now we know Paul Paul and Silas had had this great experience in the Philippian jail jail they had a revival you know that you don't think they were they had circumstances surrounding them they were in jail and and and this face with with nobody wants to go to jail you ever been to jail you know you'll never want to go back if you and your right mind you know I did a few days in the bygone days and I realize that's no place that I ever ever never never never ever want to go back to but you know even even in the midst of that Paul Paul found themselves in this place because of the gospel sinks is that right not not because he was a bad individual he was robbing us stealing but but for the sake of the gospel but I like Paul's mindset Paul had a revelation that you know he was commissioned by God to take the word to the Gentile church and and and you know the the mysteries was given we know he was the messenger of the aides and things of that nature and and you know the message was taking them against the grain it takes you against the theology of the day and and this is a lot of reason why we have backlash a lot of times right amen because it's it's against the grain when everything else is going one way the Word of God that's been given in this hour it's taken us in a total different direction is that right amen and I appreciate that because what it has done for me it has opened up my understanding to things that you know I probably would not understand if I was in any nominal Church right Amen because what we gotta we gotta understand it's given us wrapped in faith and rapture and grace right it's ensured us things that we really would not understand outside of coming in contact with the seventh danger is that right amen and he said I preached what Paul preached is that right amen and and so you know Paul here we find Paul was in prison and and you know I like most people when when we face wit with with circumstances the first thing we start doing is complaining and belly aching and pulled me and whine me huh if anybody had a reason to feel sorry for themselves it should than Paul but you know what Paul did in the midst of adversity he started singing huh he started right look it is what it is and he realized we're here amen you know what God read one thing we don't we get into a little stupor but we fail to realize God allows us to go through things for the sake of the gospel right God knew that amen it was needful for Paul and Silas to be in prison because he had a predestinated cease there huh y'all are the priest with me this morning Paul got cut Paul got to Paul got the singing and worshipping and boy it calls it caused the prison walls to begin to shake a man the prison doors begin to come open men begin to a man be set free and I believe that was set free not just naturally but spiritually God God was showing himself mighty in the midst of paul and silas's life amen man could've Ramapo sigh wait a minute don't y'all go anywhere don't you go anywhere I could could you imagine being in the jail right having to keep all these folk and now here he is they free that's enough to change a man's heart hallelujah I said nothing oh my god I'm gonna lose my life but but not not realizing you know predestination is a powerful turn the Prophet says it's not skim milk right it's not skim milk even doing doing his time than even if you study even some of the commentary ins when they talk about predestination in the book of Ephesians they have the same mind that even the Prophet had right how profound the book of Ephesians is and how really profound buried destinated really is right to think that God before the foundation of the world could could look at you and know right no see we ain't here by chance right we're not here this morning by chance right you're not believing Amen this message my chance this is the foreknowledge of God you're on God foreknew you in this age knew you would be here this time knew that I would be hearing this time even when I was messed up on the streets even when I was messed up on drugs and crack and all that God predestinated me to be here right no no even even before I you know even thought about preaching all I wanted to do is get myself straight God God had a greater plan for my life right hallelujah you know God had a plan and a purpose for a Lowenthal to go behind the prison walls right amen because of it folk got converted right they saw they saw not a man see we get we get we messed up sometimes we get so caught up looking at a man and their personality we make men great and the greatest man that ever walked the earth that came up to him and said good master there's nothing good about me only thing good is in the Father and that's the same way I feel when we kind of make me in something we make me great we make me a big day right babe because no man could redeem himself no man could take the book right the big the big man took the book the big man is living in you and I glory to God and I outside of that you know I like the property saying you know real big man make themselves small but he says it's the ones with a suit suit of clothes a little bit of money in the bank right they try to make themselves something he says the nature of man he said you know they try to make themselves small for a minute for a season and the next I give too low and they start trying to work them work themselves back up right but he said real big man and make you feel like you something and you somebody right hey I like that that feel good to me that sounds good see a real big man right brother he talks about coming in contact with men of status right man with man with position man with power men with money right but he said real big man to make you feel like you somebody not mash you down not put you down but a lift you up a real big man lift you up pull you up by your bootstraps you can make it you'll be I that's a real big man when ministry really understands what ministry is all about a man will stop lifting ourselves up and lifting up God's people right I'm gonna leave that alone I am free to get in trouble this morning I'm just a guest you know I say that kind of stuff and when I go home right well it's the truth in it have chased him I've been around a little while now about 30 years I see things and I just like lord help us right not that I'm smarter than anybody else but you know I just believe the word but but here Paul Paul come in contact with the Philippians and and and brought forth conversions and and the folks saw they saw something in Paul and Paul's message they were willing to make an eternal investment into the kingdom of God they became partners with Paul in in the work they don't say something see as as a minister as a any Shepherd they can't do anything outside of partnership you would be got you have got to become partners in ministry right cuz it's not a one-man show right no one man can build a ministry right without the people see you if all y'all leave here what you got just brother Jack right you are or what partner with him investing and in the ministry because of what you see right what what you know that's eternal what you you you sisters coming from God you popular right you partner see these individuals saw the power of the Holy Spirit at work in a life and they partnered right back now I want to stop a minute see the the the life of Christ has got to be the right kind of life has got to be the right kind of motives the right type of objectives right we got a talk a certain way y'all not priest with me right we gotta live a certain kind of life right it's no way around it see no no hypocrisy none of that nope no put on no try to you know be what you ain't be what you are don't try to be impressed people be be who you are what you are to God cuz I'm gonna get to it if I can cuz that's power begin to tell it's how you say he that begun a good work in you right now the work that's been started this morning's good it's a good work right no matter where you went no matter what season you in the work that God has started this morning in you is good right you you may not be where your brother is you may not be where your sister it right but the work is good because God only does good things y'all gonna make me preach up in here this morning right the work is good God don't do halfway stuff you look back to Genesis to see chapter the Bible everything he done was perfect it was good no flaws huh you know sometimes I I was telling the church Thursday night I say you know we living in an age where were men are dissecting the Bible and and bringing in all of these different things and and the word the term that they're using is is being inclusive being inclusive see because they're trying to bring in all of these these foul spirits right and into the Church of God and then they take scripture same thing that the devil did back in Genesis right now that was a lot of quote the Bible right he just gonna give you all a error he gonna give a certain amount of truth and then then he's gonna slip a little something in on you and and they said well you know God is love and and we gotta we gotta just love everybody god is love and we do have to love everybody but we don't have to put up with foolishness [Music] Gus that's the truth that's we we do not have to accept right people said well he i was made like this no you gotta just a devil on you right cuz cuz god don't this deceit of god is perfect see that's that is why the seed had to be restored come on we needed a restoration in order to produce the kind of church that god is looking for the amiga church has got to be like the alpha charge in order to produce that it had to be a restoration of the seed that's why he preached spoken word is there isn't a seed to try to shout smart man what his ministry was all about right come on see if we we gotta get back we had to get back to the bible in order to produce a bible church right cuz the denominational seed can only produce it done after this kind right and see you look at the nominal world now it's this that term is there inclusive we we want the homosexuals to come in and be relaxed right we want all of these folk not realizing scripturally from Genesis God separate he say where I put enmity between thy seed and surfacy right he told he told Abraham when he dealt with him right in Genesis he says man separate yourself see the Word of God always called for a total separation of all unbelief always why he told him look man when you when you you know when y'all cross over into the land which is a promise that I'm giving you man don't look don't let your son don't let your daughter's the I mean be separated be different be different see but we won't inclusive then we say love but see what people don't realize God God is a God of love it is also a God adjustment to he no church he he just a sodomite I'm gonna get off this in a minute but y'all pray for them he justice sodomites see don't don't look at just one aspect now we take inhale out the Bible ain't no such thing as hell if God said Amen is such thing as hell who is a man to come and say is no such thing is held see but you know people people are not spiritual they they get on the bandwagon of a hold of these things but not realizing the word says you got to come back to the Bible right come on church amen regardless of emotions and sensations you got to come back to the Bible back to Pentecost back to the word of st. just good things that the Prophet he was trying to show us something right he said people error because they don't know the Bible right they don't know scripture but see these these brethren they made an internal investment right amen watch watch the double life of Christ see these things is written for an example for us see we have got to be able to look in the scripture right and see God on display right what's the the characteristics of God in a vessel right how God responds to things scripturally how the Church of the Living God what'swhat's their action right what's right come on priest with me somebody watch right y'all just hold on you might have to go back and get the tape a listen to it again but what's right see cuz you know that there's a there's a right way the wrong way right glory to God and you want to know what's right as a Christian how do I supposed to live what's what's my action right see we're gonna what we're going to see we're gonna see action in a response that their actions from their experience with Paul and their conversion what Paul calls them to make an eternal investment in the kingdom building right I'm gonna stop throwing that a minute cuz you find people talk about kingdom building but they're talking about a lot of times earth our earthly something Jesus they tried to make him the king of things at an instrument if my kingdom was of this world my people to fight but a lot of times you find smart man take terminology but they're only concerned about an earthly kingdom something that that you know they could sit on an earthly throne see a man take a position here and get accolades and praise right look look what I've done look what I built and when you do that you free to get yourself in trouble cuz cuz look at Moses the minute Moses the minute Moses got in the flesh God say okay you the big man right this all about you right okay you come on up here let me show you something mister huh when he got mad at the children of God when God told him to go speak to the rock and he went and in the flesh and smote the rock a second time you bunch of rebels see we gotta watch you bunch of rebels do I got to watch do I got to God say you did say that did no no here most come out Moses Moses come calm calm calm come on up you don't need to talk with you for a minute right you when you first started out in ministry you couldn't speak y'all don't talk to him I'm feeling good now you could speak you couldn't talk you you didn't want to go hurt you it man I'm illiterate man I'm too small and now you now you've gotten to a position in your place now is you mean to tell me I well what happened oh I feel good now see what what happened to the man that couldn't speak come on see we gotta watch things we gotta watch spirits what what happened to the man that was subtle what happened to the man to have five church members you know what happens a lot of times we get elevated you're seeing it all over the message now well we making songs after preachers we bound okay and then we wonder why the outside world sometimes look innocent that's a lot of crazy there see the emphasis supposed to be on Christ the word and not a man see they those early Christians invested right amen in Christ in the work in the world not anything fleshly not anything earthly right and Paul was was in isn't it right into the philippians church right and he he was saying i thank my god upon every remembrance of you look at the response look at the christian the christian character right yankie following me right look at the life of Christ and Paul Paul say I'm thankful right Paul was gracious right for the partnership for the support right people are highly grateful anymore we aren't we are weak we have more folk let me taste something right we have more now than we've ever had all of our lives the history of folk right let me say this how many of us ever you know we we don't most of us young Americans at least my age we don't know that but no outhouse oh I'm singing overseas somewhere I never experienced that come on man when I was raised up my folk had bathrooms in the house my momma know bout that I don't know nothin bout that a little bit older than me probably know that and if you from another country you probably know that you know I went to Jamaica I remember one time you know brother brown a priest on a broken sister and I went to I went to Jamaica and I first hand I'm like oh oh that's the sister I knew exactly what it was huh Bulls the screen Bulls all on top is like lord I can't drink that ain't built for that go get me some water for so well we have more man let's think about it some of us got two three cars in our yard we got air-conditioned that's a luxury huh how do you think things that we take for granted right is-is-is is a real luxury but we we as Christians we should be thankful for the least little thing huh from the young to the old well you watch you watch you know beat and we can support for us to Train about children right we spoil them and they be so unappreciative this I only gave me this Oh Tyree kicking when I was coming through if you went on a tirade my mom would be right right behind you like the Tasmanian devil y'all gonna talk about right now y'all know mother Tillman didn't play the radio yeah we were soldiers boy but you know you and the reason the reason why you see a lot of what we see inside people aren't grateful people people are thankful people don't have the kind of respect right and I ain't even talking about a lot of times out there on time I even in the church right in the church for Paul says man I'm thankful I'm thankful for what you guys have because you guys have made it possible for me to work for me to accomplish things does the small gestures look nothing too small right cuz look at Jesus with the woman with the love to love to meit's right he try to stop even the prophet of God he you know one time he wanted to stop stop the woman you know don't do that nobody blessing he looked in the scripture and saw where Jesus didn't stop that woman from giving her life cuz you okay I'll give God huh man kind of grew up in the Baptist Church a little bit they just saying the more you give the more he'll give you to you no matter how no matter how hard you try you cannot outgive God God won't let you beat him huh you give two dollars he'll give it back five dollars ten dollars huh God like what you can't outgive me I got too much resource huh how many believe that lower to his wonderful name because you know he says you know I thank my god upon every remembrance of you look at Paul's response right what was he responding to write the character of God displayed by the church right yeah I got a whole ethos going because that's what it is what causes you to do what you do in the flesh a lot of times we wouldn't do it when the pastor talked about giving love to get quiet sometimes at home you start talking about money you could feel the wall go up like oh my y'all was just a Manning and glory to God now I say mo NE why and it's like Jesus stop grabbing your pockets and pocketbooks but Paul was like and look at his remembrance right I'm going somewhere look at his remembrance of the church right his response was positive it was something something of Joey right and that's the way it's supposed to be when people come in contact with the Church of the Living God their memories of the church should be positive you know I'm reminded of the story they they bought they bought the woman that they said were caught in adultery y'all know the story they brought her to Jesus and and a bunch of hypocrites wanted a stone they were trying to get Jesus to break the word of God all right come on cuz you know you can't come into dusty on y'all now come on let's be real let's be real she could not it's like okay y'all brought over Winterfell it went where was the man there right how could how could Jesus pass judgment without the man being there but they was trying to be hypocritical but Jesus was a master of circumstances right amen and and Jesus you know kind of you know had some discernment in his ministry three and and Jesus went down on his knees and start right in the dirt and he made a real profound statement he that without sin please cast the first stone never did look up I believe Jesus knew half of the men in this kind and in in this little time them probably being with this woman see never looked up never looked up Wow everybody started dropping the rocks easy now huh making a mass exodus when they were all Jesus looked up say woman when your accusers well don't look like I got nothing she's saying wonderful and I ain't here the accuser he said goings don't sit no more right hey man see and I could have I could rip you know I could think about heart response right amen went when she started remembering that date she could have died by the hands of a bunch of hypocrites she could have been dead sleeping in her grave but she was brought in the tight with the son of man right and he was able to discern the situation and know the Word of God I believe when she got to thinking about Jesus said boy what a mighty God what what a mighty man what a great man what a what a example right what a you know an example of real Christianity and being responsible see we gotta be as Christians responsible because there's a responsibility that's been given to us we are the Great Commission we we gotta know what we're here for we gotta know what we're doing because we don't want people you know cuz sometimes you find people testifying yeah I was over to that church and boy limit II see their remembrance of that group right it's not a folk-rock weren't effective in a positive way it was it was negative see sometimes sometimes it's just the devil own people gotta call it I can see it right sometimes the devil just won't won't de minister to break the word to accommodate people I'm not here to try to accommodate y'all I'm trying I'm trying to preach all into the body change I'm trying I'm trying to you know get something you know if anything in here get it transformed right here come on church see and it won't benefit anybody for me to compromise cuz if I customize for this family I gotta compromise for that family if I compromise for this function I gotta compromise for that person and who are we helping and then what we got is a gathering together of a you know just a bunch of malice and envy and strife in and hatred and then none of those can be identified because he can only be identified by its characteristics come on now that's it that's it I'm showing you something see it ain't just enough wants to come and smell good and look good and all of that no we gotta manifest the life of Christ we it's imperative it's not something that we could get around see that the outside world responds look at the Alpha Church they they will call Christians because the people around them saw the life of God living in a group of people they read they saw they saw something that was alive something that was real huh Amen something that was genuine see and this is the thing people people want to come in contact people are looking for something that's genuine huh we we need a whole lot of mother deers come on come on brother branham honey with this guy that was cruel cruel hearted and everything else and you know a lot of times a lot of times we don't realize God allows us to come in contact with folks because God's gonna ultimately do so we gotta be patient we gotta be understanding see you know what Paul writes in the book of Philippians we read it Paul Allah God allowed these things further for the furtherance of the gospel and and and everything it's not ill willed a lot of things actually meeting the purpose of God we just don't see we just don't understand because you know we want to live a Christian life you know like we on a picnic instead of that that this is a walk I seen y'all on you know talk about your battle with Warren Jin and running all around this place but you gotta keep that in mind when when you come in contact and faced with a situation look I am in a spiritual battle this is a spiritual war Amen God have you got me here is for a reason huh amen if you brought me in contact with this person we Lord praise the Lord Church pray for me that the Lord will deliver me how you know God don't want God want you to be where you had cuz God wants to bring deliverance garbled ah listen that can happen to you let's got a lot got a love for a man Paul to be in prison him and Silas and look what happened right Oh God a lot of times bringing us in contact with folk because God wants to do some info right and we're just the instruments of God see amen that's not we're the instruments of God and see when we come in contact with folk and leave the president folk we walk there their response in their memory amen something a positivity not you watch it oh my god see people at people who people come in contact with Christian folks and they leave like a lot of mercy they didn't make my situation better not criticize y'all but I'm just talking right I'm just trying to show us something that shouldn't be the case if we look at it biblically right because you know they couldn't you know the people around Jesus you know the hypocrites and the religious people I couldn't understand Jesus you know they would go back to the disciple you master always Ronnie's you know tax collectors and all these types of people but they were sick they were sick they needed a physician the world is sick they need us though the world needs us right because we've been given the word we understand the word we understand what God was got with his word right come on come on hey man and see we don't want the patients to leave like what I was a crazy doctor lord have mercy who was dead we you know this is my desire right is that when when God brings me in contact with folk I could have a positive right attitude because sometimes our attitude is not right huh and people be looking at you everybody's not crazy right and people look at you they say it was a Christian they always complain they ain't never smile if that's Christian y'all won't know everybody I know everybody's guys have got a variety and everybody ain't gonna be giddy everybody ain't gonna be like but again you know some people gonna be a little bit you know low-key and everything but we want to be we want to find ourselves in a position where God can really use us right God used the Philippian Church the benefit Paul in ministry and and and you know his when he thought about the church man it he was grateful he was thankful and it was something to smile about could you imagine man if you know Paul would have come in contact with this group of people and you know one good man boy y'all a terrible group of folk talk about representing the kingdom that wasn't the case look you know I like this I like to look at little things like this it might not mean nothing to y'all this more but it'd mean a whole lot to me I could preach on this for both servers right it means a lot because what it shows me right is is it shows me the life of Christ in the church and then it also shows me the life of Christ in the individual and the response right positive responding positive right in a positive way they responding positive bye-bye you know support now you got to go back and get the history now I do a little bit thing right but it's the support right Paul was looking at all of the things and then you know Paul was looking at the fact that okay these guys will wit me from the start right and here it is you know my present-day situation and they're still here come on now looking at me funny get a smiling face do something cuz see sometimes people say but that's my ride and die Ronald I'm that's the you know the clone to turn right attack and as soon as you you know your circumstances and situations change right you can't you know and we sing song you're something going go away yes to see him and we be all about the fallout and everything and as soon as something don't go our way I'm gonna leave this alone I don't wanna hurt nobody feeling UK horrified Oh huh see in the agent out that we living in people wanna interfere in it how can I say they said it I said my hair but they ain't gonna come out with my right a gospel that don't offend right they ain't scripture cuz we need change okay how long you been doing it if it ain't right it's just not right right come on the work is good and sometimes sometimes it take God you know tearing us down right in order to build us up according to the blueprint y'all heard the start the time to develop this contractor he built he built the building and he decided to do his own thing huh he decided he he doing his own way and he this doing it this way of making the folk happy this this is not what I paid for and you don't know that unless you work in construction let me tell you something folk be funny by day money huh especially real rich folk the people that I be work we'd be working huh don't want me to begin there looking at the man be standing in the background be like girl you in trouble but she's gonna put it on you huh and sometimes they'd be the hardest people to please but he wanted to do the thing on his own and he had a tag down see and sometimes you know godson tears down we gotta be broken right I'm grateful for I am what I am today by the grace of God I realized you know what church listen I ain't what I we're supposed to be at evil can I be real with you but I know the work is a good work I know that you you you you cannot tell me you know brother Johnson might be a better person than me right but the same God that started to work in him started the work in me and the work is good huh and this one thing I know the work will be completed your work gonna be completed I'll be alright tear yourself just said yeah like I said I know my I do things purposely don't tell you sir I'll be alright because the work is a good work huh sometimes even young people you gotta tell yourself you you weave so everybody was full of mistakes especially young people they trying to grow they're trying to mature they're trying to find themselves but you got to know that the work is a good work the work is a good work and you may not be a daddy but the workers a good work and you young ladies may not be your mama but the workers of good work being confident he the thing that he started here performing right one or two more scripts and I let you go y'all all right I'm gonna keep y'all all day I feel good this morning I don't feel like I got nowhere yet but that's how I do but I think but he says I thank my god upon every remembrance to you always in every prayer of mine for you all making requests with joy what see look at the response his response to our life to character to partnership could you imagine being him really I'm lead us along to you you'll be a relationship and partnership right and it's like time to make the donuts you can't hardly stay in one another you can't eat Allah God I gotta go home you was happy too you realize you gotta go home huh now don't get quiet now I know I'm starting the middle right what kind of response is that to Christianity to Christians you see church people don't think things through a lot of times right amen everybody did God leave me yeah God needs you by his word if you don't know as far as I'm concerned I'm crazy just like this you can tell me blue cheese on the moon you go up there with some soda crackers and have yourself a ball I'm not doing that because I know that's not the truth right I've been pastoring out 20 years and I realize I've seen things I've heard things that people best about I feel bad I mean when I look at things about a word okay what you tell me I go for it just like the time to you know the man told brother branham that uh he felt like God was sending them overseas and everything and brother bad Oh Godspeed Billy Paul told her like but then why you telling man he told me he didn't ask me and most times people don't people don't action your opinion they tell you what they did I'd already sat down and figured out let's just come and tell you what they're gonna do whether you agree with it and don't agree with it and the worst people are fussed with it's those type of people well go do it if it worked out it was him most times it do not work out right and you know it but you just gotta let folk do it see partnership but but he says I I thank my God he's our always in every prayer of mine for you all making requests with joy for your fellowship right the partnership in the gospel from the first day until now right see and in partnership give me a second I'm a close in a minute hope y'all alright is a person who takes part in an undertaking with another or others especially in a business or company which shared risks and profits see people want people want to be protectors of the profits and the benefits when you struggling when you going through a matter of a story you know my wife cousin Lynn told us some years ago about it was it was just this this guy he worked on Wall Street and you know we had a little money educated and everything you know a lot of time them guys they got those guys get them little a little trophy wives you know to make them look good no and and yeah young lady was married to and and they were doing cause she had two nannies and the BMW the big house and you know maids and all of this kind of stuff and man she you know fine clothes and beyond the man arm at the big business parties and everything and then the man lost his job huh she was there for the profit he lost his job and he went to a set up honey um why I lost my job we got the kind of scale back know you know we might have to get rid of one of the cars and you know your nanny we might know that was not a part of the agreement huh that was not part of the agreement the agreement was I be the trophy on your arms you know I have all of this she left a man she left the man with the children and we got her another a man rich man see but she wasn't there for the risk and and for the downfall what a person when he wasn't doing good see but did he came up right that's that's it that's just life stock sometimes you know you you might lose a little bit of something but you gotta hang on in there cuz it's go rise back up again right but a lot of times you know people people you know they want to be with you they probably want to be down with you you know you look at demons demons demons want to hang up why I tell you folk out the world he started looking at power like wait a minute wait a minute oh you sure are still dealing with you you show God still with you you show you a man of God my god you ain't got man a man like you a man of your caliber you've got one coat you call it for one cup my god that's the position you in man see people are people to leave you people to stay with you long as you're looking good and things looking good you're riding good but don't not something happen do like we've days they're doing the Baptist race back in the day y'all know I'm talking about huh oh oh how could you have confidence in folk like that huh you have to have you know let me tell you something can I preach for a minute i'ma go ash Apple what wanna have confidence and people that's gonna be winning through the thick unity though his option through his down when he got a chance falling when the folks start walking away right as long as a man of God is preaching the Word of God we get caught up in family friendship and things of that nature I didn't start out with you don't mean they're going all the way which they're right glory to God take a look this morning take a stand for the Word of God no matter who leads the spirit of true tabernacle I'm here for the Word of God I'm here because of what I understand about the Word of God Fred might go coworkers may go I remember one of the hardest decisions I had to make years ago as a young convert man I know I was going to you know rapture face and and I had to make a decision and and check one pastor in back then huh yeah I wasn't gonna say this how y'all know me I ain't scared huh and while what it was the situation was where the world and I hated Ali cuz man all of our friends were there Jimmy burner huh whole bunch of I mean what we said we had a little group there huh all those young people coming up right but God started dealing with me I wanted to know more I want to understand why I didn't realize God trying to get me into a place ain't man to put this microphone in my hand I was set up and didn't know it and the hardest thing it was to lead I mean man I could Burton a home in I mean the let's go own it own it own it own it own it hurt my heart to how to lead the church right but I wasn't leaving the church because of anything personal column but for the words sake I was I was trying to get more understanding of what I had because I didn't understand I now I realized that God has given us a great message but I couldn't understand it go to conventions and here folks are my seven thunders give faith we Shawn hallelujah did somebody come on what was what what was that Christ we couldn't break that down back then we were just some group of excited people we didn't understand what brother brothers ministry was all about why God why we even needed a prophet see why because we were so far off the Word of God right yet religious see we needed to come back and line ourselves up with the word God always says a prophet when the people get away from the Word of God to bring them back to the Word of God cuz he you could be worshiping this is a powerful statement and worshiping God in vain people don't believe that when Jesus came on as he said vain do you worship Me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men see and through denominationalism from catholicism right on down a lot of amen doctrines the commandments of men not biblical not biblical see you got worshiping God came what no infidel came worship but his his worship was not accepted see Amen people don't even realize this morning day worshipping God powerful statement but it's the truth right hey man see you got to come back to the Word of God that's why we needed a prophet because people with so much era that's why he took so much criticism if you stay with the word of God you're gonna be hated you're gonna be hated you'll be hated in your own home huh you'll be put down to your old home amongst family people until something take place and damn that's the truth amen see I don't need a whole lot of people you know I love the dumb dumb dumb brother but I said you know what how can I help people and I can't help myself right I couldn't help myself and then I remember when God stopped dealing with brother Jack I like first annoyed first learn I had been gone for a little minute right and I remember I remember there were times he old man he said I remember the time here Hilary know some time some time we'd be in discussion and why I'd be totally disagreeing but I wouldn't fight with it right I say you know what I believe God gonna bring him to it and after a while he couldn't you know I press my we were talking about sunset you know what I had got a little wrong in I'll just smile at him right to say I gotta do that but you know I knew it take it was gonna take God it's just gonna take me to love you and pray for you was gonna take God to open up your understand to the scripture brother I'm saying you're gonna understand it right and now we on same page we like we like right left off huh amen see he can he can out confidence a brush my like you know I need to come take the church from you don't worry about I got your brother right see but God God has brought him to this great understanding and then I get to talking to people let me say well you know what brother Jack creaks and we was over to the little meeting the other week you know that combined meeting my brother Jack preach the house down the preachers against the preaching of them fourth generations and everything and I can are watching them from the theologians they was quiet trying to figure out where he was going he had already talked to me about it cuz sometimes sometimes you know folks think that they know it all this is an inexhaustible message when you think you know something god I'll show somebody something that beyond you me and you be like oh well I don't even think about that one huh I'll tell my church yes look we're gonna be learning way on the other side right come on come on don't come into this place and be sanitary God is a bit gone and God is able to blow your mind drop something up in here like an atomic bomb like whoa whoa okay whoa whoa that

branham was talking about not putting a comma back behind what you believe a period I mean right amen because the message the messages sometimes I think I'm still on the surface because this thing is profound it really is this books of the Bible man I know I haven't even touched it just takes studying on them and being inspired by God I read of god this is so rich we should never ever come here and be complacent trying to make the donut well I'm here brother Jack the lord have mercy I'm gonna say this I remember I remember doing the time that musicians come I remember the times back in the
