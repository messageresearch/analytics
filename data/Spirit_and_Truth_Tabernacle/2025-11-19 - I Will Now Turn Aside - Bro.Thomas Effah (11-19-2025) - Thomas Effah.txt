We certainly thank the Lord to be uh in his house tonight. Praise God. As brother Maris was just mentioning, um God sent us a surprise. Amen. Uh for tonight. And and I always like to say um it's like being in the field of Boaz. And um when Ruth was in that field, the reapers had to drop some things on purpose uh just for her to get. And sometimes when God sends us a little surprise like this, then he's dropping something on purpose for us to get. Amen. And we're looking forward to that tonight. But brother brother Thomas Epha, amen, is with us. He is passing through these parts from Ghana. Amen. and um you know he had reached out to me and told me he was coming but I didn't think it would fit uh because of some of the other things we had going on but it just so happened to work out and uh and I believe the Lord has ordained it. So we want to prepare our hearts to receive the word of the Lord tonight uh from brother Thomas Epha. Amen. He's a minister uh from the from Ghana. Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's uh go to Amazing Grace. Amen. And then might need to lower the monitors just a little bit with this microphone. Amen. Hallelujah. Zing grace, how sweet the sound that saved a rich like me. Oh, I once was lost. Oh, but now I'm found. Oh, was blind. But now I see. Praise God. Praise God. Oh, praise God. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Amen. It's amazing grace indeed. Sometime we don't Just stop for a while and take inventory and just think of the grace of God, the love of God towards us. And the prophet said, "Millions and million of people are on earth today. But why did God select you? Why did Jesus pick you?" Then when you come to understand this grace of Jesus Christ, the grace of God, then something in your heart will be burning toward appreciate the love of God. So we thank the Lord that we have been selected from this wicked and adulterous generation. Let us pray. Heavenly Father, we don't have words to justify or qualify father this wonderful opportunity that is being granted unto your people. Father, one thing is certain because we were before the foundations of the world, we were in you. That is why you cannot get us missing or we cannot allow any one of us to perish. Father, we have gathered here tonight. Something has pulled us together. That's the word of God. Our heart is looking for this meal that it will energize. It will give us quickening power so that we can take up from this wicked world and be with you in eternity. Help us as we approach the word of God. Come deliver your word. Speak to your people. Bring everything under control and let your power manifest in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Okay. While we are standing, maybe you want to turn your Bible with me. Let us go to the book of Exodus, second book of Moses, chapter 3. Chapter 3, verse 1 to 4. Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the prince of Midian, and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Herob. And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in the flame of fire out of the midst of the bush. And he looked, and behold, the bush burn with fire, and the bush was not consumed. And Moses said, I will now turn aside and see this great sight where the bush is not bent. And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see, God called him out of the midst of the bush and said, "Moses, Moses." And he said, "Here am I." May the Lord add blessing to reading of his word. You can have your seat for now. May the Lord bless each one of you. It's good to come into the presence of God. So if you make it in God's presence, it means you are victorious because you have you have really fought battles before you could get here. &gt;&gt; The enemy is always trying to hinder you. He always want you to have an excuse. &gt;&gt; And you you you you dump a lot of excuses on you. &gt;&gt; But thank God you have been able to break through. That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, may the Lord bless you for coming to church &gt;&gt; and uh I thank the Lord that I've got opportunity to to be with you this evening. Uh things seem not to have worked like this but the Lord wor it out. I appreciate my friend &gt;&gt; for granting me opportunity because it was not really planned like this but at the 11th hour &gt;&gt; yeah something changed so God bless you and I will take this opportunity to turn the church may the Lord bless you because I told my friend bra I don't have a car to do the ministry m ministry in Africa, Ghana. So I managed to get a car that was ordered from Japan. But when it got to Ghana, it was difficult to pay the duty, you know, Africa very expensive duty to clear the car from the port. So I told my friend, I told some other friends and this church supported me to clear that car. May the Lord bless you. I appreciate that. Let us give let us give a hand. God rich bless you. So when brother Jack comes to Africa, maybe he will come to Ghana. He will ride in that car like the very the very beast that Rebecca nourish. I believe Rebecca he rode. So I will be expecting you to come and ride in it. May the Lord bless you. I appreciate that. God bless you all. &gt;&gt; Uh tonight we are here for one purpose and we are here to see Jesus. &gt;&gt; The prophet said it depend what you want to see. If you are here to see a founder, you see a founder. That is maybe you say this man is a founder. &gt;&gt; If you're here to see a bishop, maybe you can call him a bishop. &gt;&gt; But if you are here to see Jesus, &gt;&gt; your eyes will go beyond this man's flesh and you will see Jesus. &gt;&gt; Because that is what we are here to see. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is a song here. I s I love to sing that one that I think 946 if it is only believers. Wasted years. Wasted years. Wasted years. Wasted years. Oh, how foolish. As you walk on in darkness and in fears, turn around. Turn around. God is calling. He's calling you from a life of wasted years. Wasted years. Oh, wasted years. Oh, how foolish as you walk in darkness and in fears. Turn around. Turn around. God is calling. He's calling you. from a life of wasted years. &gt;&gt; It's time to turn around. &gt;&gt; That is the subject that we want to stay on this evening. He said, "I will now turn aside." &gt;&gt; And tonight, if your focus is set on somewhere else, I want somebody to turn aside. I want to present Jesus TO YOU TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; TURN ASIDE. Turn your eyes from all the stuff, all the attractions. &gt;&gt; There will be attraction tonight. &gt;&gt; And I want somebody to turn aside. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look unto him. &gt;&gt; He's standing beside you. He has got something to talk to you. He has something to give to you. Turn aside. &gt;&gt; Now, this was Moses. God's anointed prophet. He knew his commission. You supposed to know your calling. &gt;&gt; You don't come to church and sit here without knowing your purpose. &gt;&gt; You supposed to know your purpose where God has called you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are not following your father. You are not following your mother. You have been brought here for the purpose. Don't say I am just a little guy, small boy or girl. I'm following my father. You are not following your father. You are following Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Therefore, you supposed to know where he has called you. Moses, he knew his calling. He knew his purpose. He knew he was anointed man. He knew he was a deliverer. He went to the camp and he tried to use it by his physical, his strength and he could not work. &gt;&gt; FRIENDS, MOST OF THE TIME WE HAVE TRIED TO EXERT OUR OWN ENERGY TO DO STUFF BUT IT CANNOT HELP US BECAUSE you never met with God. All right. &gt;&gt; The reason WE ARE FAILING MOST of the time is because we have taken the wrong way. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Friends, but when Moses became a running away prophet because HE HAS KILLED an Egyptian and he was a wanted man, &gt;&gt; GOD KNOWS HOW TO BRING YOU to his presence. &gt;&gt; Maybe you put sickness on you and you run to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe you put problem on you and you run to God. &gt;&gt; He put Moses in problem and he was a wanted man. He has to run. And then you got to the wilderness. God says, "I got my man, but I have to give him training. He has to be a shepherd." GOD HAS TO PULL AWAY ALL YOUR STUFF, YOUR EXPERIENCE. HOW TO GET OUT OF you until God can use you. your experience, your ambition, your me and me, me, ME ME HAS TO GET OUT OF YOU. GOD HAS TO EMPTY YOU AND FILL YOU with his purpose. &gt;&gt; He did that to Moses after Moses about 40 years that experience that God said this is the time that I can use my prophet. Re said God always give a sign always to attract the people and after he has gotten the people attention to the SIGN THAT A VOICE WILL SPEAK. It is not the sign that is the purpose of God. He is only giving you a sign to attract you so that he can get a message for you. &gt;&gt; The voice of the SON NOW WE FIND out here the burning bush was a sign. It was given to attract the attention of Moses. And that is what God gives a sign for. To attract the attention of the people. That is what a sign is for. To attract attention. And we go down through the scripture here as we teach it now for a few minutes and we find out if that isn't so that he give these signs to attract attention and then when he gets the attention of the PEOPLE THEN THE VOICE OF the son begin to speak. &gt;&gt; Jesus healed the sick to attract attention. You see then he be he begin to speak. You see he always it always attract attention. The burning bush was was given to Moses to attract the runaway prophet attention and he turned aside to see what it was. Then the son gave a voice. The son always gives a voice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When the attention or when the attraction WAS GIVEN TO CATCH THE ATTENTION OF THE RUNNING AWAY PROPHET, then there was a voice And WHEN THE VOICE SPOKE TO MOSES, &gt;&gt; HE WAS VERY VERY CONCERNED TO SEE TO COMPARE THAT VOICE WITH THE SCRIPTURE. &gt;&gt; Any attraction that you RECEIVE IS OKAY. BUT AFTER THE ATTRACTION, look at the voice. &gt;&gt; And after you LOOK AT THE VOICE, COMPARE IT TO THE SCRIPTURE. If it is a scriptural voice, &gt;&gt; Moses, Moses, he turn aside. God is calling somebody. &gt;&gt; HE'S CALLING YOU TONIGHT. TURN ASIDE. HE HAS A MESSAGE FOR YOU. WHEN HE TURNED ASIDE, THEN GOD SPOKE TO HIM. &gt;&gt; I HAVE REMEMBERED MY PROMISE. I MADE A COVENANT WITH ABRAHAM. &gt;&gt; I'M GOD OF ABRAHAM. I'M GOD OF ISAAC. I'M GOD OF JACOB. AND I HAVE COME DOWN. MOSES SAID THAT IS SCRIPTURE PROPHET THIS IS SCRIPTURE THIS WHAT GOD TOLD MY FATHER ABRAHAM HE THIS IS NO OTHER PERSON THERE'S NO OTHER PERSON BUT THAT IS JEHOVAH speaking &gt;&gt; because HE COMPARE IT to the scripture &gt;&gt; let God help us &gt;&gt; THAT WE DON'T BE SWALLOWED BY ANY STUFF WHATEVER PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT ALWAYS STAY WITH THE SCRIPTURE STAY WITH THE BIBLE MY FRIEND THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; THIS MESSAGE IS BIBLE. BROTHER BREN IS A BIBLE VINDICATED PROPHET. HIS VOICE WHEN YOU HEAR, YOU LISTEN, it's a scriptural voice &gt;&gt; always. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Isaiah one time he said, "Look and leave." Isaiah 5 50 55 45 21 TELL ye and bring them near and let them take counel together who have declared this from the ancient time who have told it from that time have not I the Lord and there is no God else beside me just God and a savior there is none beside me look unto me oh ye look unto me and be ye saved all the ends of the earth, for I am God and there is none else. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look unto ME ALL YE THE WHOLE EARTH. &gt;&gt; You understand? That's why you have the song. Look and live. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; my brother live. Look unto Jesus now and leave &gt;&gt; for it is recorded in his word. Hallelujah. It is only that you look and live. &gt;&gt; Somebody want to live AND THERE IS ONLY ONE place to look. TURN ASIDE and look unto Jesus. &gt;&gt; That is life. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. NO PERSON, BROTHER, no person can claim to be a Christian OR A PASTOR UNTIL YOU MEET GOD face to face. THE PROBLEM IN THE MESSAGE IS HERE LOT OF CONFUSION PEOPLE DOING THEIR STUFF IS BECAUSE THEY NEVER COME INTO THE PRESENCE OF GOD. LET US BE honest to ourselves. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; No person HAS GOT THE RIGHT to claim to be a Christian or even a right to come behind the pulpit until he has MADE A PILLAR OF FIRE FACE TO FACE THAT NOBODY CAN TALK IT OUT OF HIM. &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? JUST LIKE MOSES EXPERION, HE CAME FACE TO FACE with God AND TO TAKE HIS GOD ORAINED responsibility just like Saul. &gt;&gt; The same way God commissioned his people to bring them face to face before he commissioned them. &gt;&gt; If you have a gift even speaking in tong, God has to bring you gift and callings without repentance. It is sitting in you right there. But God has to bring you face to face before him. &gt;&gt; Before your commission will be effective. &gt;&gt; God cannot send or COMMISSION ANYONE UNTIL HE has brought him face to face. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN HE BRINGS you face TO FACE, HE GOES WITH YOU. God has never left a man to GO BY HIMSELF. IT HAS NEVER HAPPENED. HE ALWAYS GO WITH HIS MAN &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE WORK IS NOT MAN'S business as we missionary we are going. It is not the business of THOMAS NEITHER IS THE BUSINESS OF IT IS GOD'S business &gt;&gt; and if it is God business God must execute his business. Nobody can do it. &gt;&gt; So when you see a man commissioned brother you should know that it is not a man God in the man. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; GOD TOLD MOSES IN EXODUS 23:20 said, "I WILL SEND my angel before after he has called him." And he commissioned him. He said, "My angel will go with you." Look at Elazar. When Abraham sent him to fetch Rebecca, Elazar said, "If the woman will not per adventure, you will not go with me. You will not come with me." He said, "Let me tell you, the angel of the Lord will go with you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Then Elazar was satisfied. He was okay. Master, what did you say? Said the angel of the Lord will go with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. WHEN MOSES HEARD THAT COMMISSION WHEN HE COMMISSION was given, he said, "BUT I WILL SEND my angel before thee &gt;&gt; and he will bring you to the promised land. Listen to his voice. THERE IS A VOICE IN THE ANGEL. OBEY HIS VOICE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Obey his voice because if you don't, I will not forgive YOU. HE SAID, "BEHOLD, I SEND MY ANGEL BEFORE THEE to keep you in the way and to bring thee the place where I have prepared. Beware of him and obey his voice. Provoke him not for he will not he will not pardon your transgression, for my name is in him." BUT IF THOU SHALT NOT obey his voice and do all that I speak, then I will be an enemy. I will be an enemy unto your enemies and address unto if only you obey my voice. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; THERE IS ALWAYS ATTRITION. THAT IS WHY WE MUST HEAR go what God want to DO IN THIS GENERATION. THAT IS WHY HE GAVE US A PROPHET. A prophet IS ALWAYS A SON. BROTHER SAID WHEN YOU HEAR OF a prophet, A VINDICATED PROPHET, IT'S A SIGN &gt;&gt; THAT GOD IS READY TO SPEAK. &gt;&gt; Look at PAUL AND SILAS WHEN they preach and then that dance who was giving his m a lot of money because of enchantment. That girl was giving the master a lot of money. But Paul and Silas, they saw that devil, that demon, and they cast IT OUT. GET OUT FROM HER. And when the master got to know that he was he has now been paralyzed because all his power has now gone and the way he was making money was really seized. His everything is seized. Now they arrested Paul and Silah and put them in prison. BUT THERE WAS ATROCION IN THE NIGHT. THEIR CHAINS, EVERYTHING FELL FROM THEM. THE PILLAR OF FIRE, GOD CAME DOWN AND released their chains and lose their chains. &gt;&gt; AND THE JAILER TOOK THE SOUL TO KILL HIMSELF because the his master or his he his officer big man is going to find get problem. We gave you prisoners. Where are they? IT WAS AN OPPRESSION. WHEN THE POWER OF GOD CAME DOWN, PRISON DOORS, everything was loose. Then there was a voice. &gt;&gt; PAUL SAID, "DON'T KILL YOURSELF." I SAID, "WE ARE HERE." &gt;&gt; It was just God giving you attraction so that we can speak to you. &gt;&gt; What must I do? If you will believe with all your heart that Jesus Christ is the son of God, thou shalt be saved. &gt;&gt; And the Bible said right away he was baptized because he saw God. &gt;&gt; When you see God, you'll be convinced. &gt;&gt; You understand? Now you go got to a crucial time. JESUS CHRIST HAS COME TO THE CLIMAX OF HIS MISSION. He has to go TO CALVARY. EVERY ONE OF US, WE MUST GO TO CALVARY. WE HAVE TO COME TO THAT ROAD OF CALVARY. THAT'S WHAT BRAB PREACHED THAT DAY at Calvary. &gt;&gt; You must take a trip to Calvary. Jesus has come to that place and they have taken A HOLD OF HIM. THEY ARE DRAGGING HIM TO CALVARY AND PETER SAID, "I WILL GO AT ANY LENGTH. I'LL GO WITH YOU. I'll go with you. Let everybody desert you. Let everybody run away." That is not Peter. I will stay on. Jesus said, "Peter, you can do that. you can this way unless I go before you when the high priest is the lord that has gone before us that's why we are able to walk this way &gt;&gt; so Peter wait until I go before you Peter said no I'll go with you said let ME TELL YOU BEFORE THE ROLL you will deny me three times amen Amen. The prophet SAID WE HAVE COME TO THE GROWING TIME. THERE IS GOING TO BE A TIME JESUS IS GOING to turn to you because you have denied him. Many of us, most of us has denied Jesus. We have PUT HIM TO SHAME. WE HAVE BROUGHT REPROACH to the message. Remember all the things that you did, you and your husband, how you are fighting in that community. People are really disappointed. reproach. Listen, AS I THOUGHT ON MY WAY 59 0 says 1 0 0 1 0 number paragraph 37. AFTER THE HAS grown three times and Peter look up in the face of the Lord Jesus, he begin to think on his ways and what he has done to our our Lord. And the prophecy, the word of the Lord came into his view. For he KNOW GOD HAS SAID THE SAME GOD THAT TOLD HIM THAT HAS TOLD US WHAT to do also. What did what did it DO WHEN HE THOUGHT on his ways THAT HE HAD TREATED HOW HE HAS TREATED JESUS and how he had denied him before the classical people and how he has tried to be one of the world and he tried to act like the rest of them. And when he begin to h be AND WHEN HE THOUGHT on his ways it drove him into the darkness to weep bitterly. I BELIEVE IT IS GROWING TIME NOW FOR the church of THE LIVING GOD TO GET ALONG ALONG WITH GOD AND WEEP in bitterness. &gt;&gt; IT IS COCKROINING TIME. THE IS COCO. It is cocky in town. &gt;&gt; WHY? WHEN JESUS TURNED HIS EYES, IT CAUGHT THE EYES of Peter. &gt;&gt; Jesus is turning his eyes tonight. &gt;&gt; It is touching your eyes &gt;&gt; and remember how you have treated him. &gt;&gt; Then Peter remembered but THANK GOD. PETER LOOKED FOR A CORNER AND HE WEPT BITTERLY. BROTHER, IT IS TIME OF WEEPING. WE HAVE TREATED JESUS IN SUCH A WAY. THIS IS THE TIME FOR YOU TO WEEP BITTERLY AND SAY, "LORD, FORGIVE ME." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT IS TIME TO GET UP FROM HERE. FRIENDS, LET US TELL YOU, WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME TO STAY HERE. IT IS TIME TO GET UP FROM THIS WICKED WORLD. LET US BE UP IN DOING IT IS TIME TO get out from this wicked world. Turn a look to Jesus and then remember how you have treated him. It is time to weep. Didn't the time to make amusement of Mary. It is weeping down. Peter the reason he WAS NOT CONVERTED. PETER WAS NOT CONVERTED although he has WALKED WITH THE MESSAGE for several three and a half years but he was not converted. That's how he be behaved that way. YOU WILL ONLY BEHAVE THAT WAY TO DENY JESUS BECAUSE YOU NEVER RECEIVE THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; LET IT BE VERY SINCERE TO OURSELVES. YOU DON'T REALLY PAT ON YOU DON'T PUT PEACOCK FEATHERS IN your in your wings &gt;&gt; and presume that you're a peacock. &gt;&gt; It will fall apart. &gt;&gt; BE HONEST TO YOURSELF. IF YOU DON'T HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO TO STAND THE SHOCK, YOU MUST CLIMB THE STEPS. MOVE TO THE upper room. I am inviting somebody tonight. &gt;&gt; LET US COUNT THE STEPS AND MOVE TO UPPER ROOM. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN YOU COME FROM UPPER ROOM, THE NARRATIVE, THE STORY WILL CHANGE. &gt;&gt; Everything will change. &gt;&gt; You understand? God have mercy. &gt;&gt; Was given two signs to attract the people. We know vibration when he people had vibration his son healing. Second discernment. &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS GOD DOING? HE WAS ATTRACTING THE PEOPLE TO BRING THEM TO THE THIRD POOL. &gt;&gt; GOD WAS MUCH CONCERNED ABOUT THE THIRD POOL. NOT THE FIRST POOL, NOT THE SECOND POOL. The first and the second pool was JUST AN ATTRACTION. BUT GOD WAS CONCERNED WITH THE TEMPLE, THE OPENING OF THE WORD. &gt;&gt; EXACTLY. &gt;&gt; That was the ministry of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Jesus also came the same place. The anointed one at the end 65 TABLE NUMBER 0725 PARAGRAPH 359. NOTICE THE VERY DAY WHEN THIS MESSENGER NOT WHEN HE START ON BUT WHEN HE BEGINS to declare his message. You see the first pool healing the second pool prophesying the third pool the opening of the word the mysteries revealed. No more THERE IS NO MORE HIGHER ORDER TO REVEAL the word than prophets. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We are talking of A PROPHET A VINDICATED PROPHET. NOBODY can take IT FROM US. WILLIAM IS THE SEVENTH ANGEL AND WE have to be very careful and we don't add, we don't subtract. Whatever he said, leave it like that. &gt;&gt; You understand? NOW WHAT IS THE FASHION ON THE MOUNTAIN? The prophet said THE VOICE CAME BACK AND said it is not a king saw but the KING SAW THE WORD OF the Lord said fear not this is the tailpool the vindication of your ministry that is the trashing when God Abraham got that trash and he saw the sword in his hand there was a voice &gt;&gt; always a voice follow a sign. You cannot GET A SCRIPTURAL SIGN without a scriptural voice. THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES THAT HE HAVE COMPASSED AROUND THIS MOUNTAIN so long enough. TURN NOT TOWARD IT IS TIME TO GO AND POSSESS THE LAND. In Deuteronomy chapter 2 verse 1-5, then we turned and looked and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea, as the Lord spoke unto me, and we compass man cell many days. And the Lord spake unto me, saying, Ye have compassed this mountain long enough. Turn ye notward and command thy the people, saying, Ye are compare ye ARE GOING TO PASS through the course of your brethren, the children of Esau that dwell in S, and they shall be afraid of you. Take ye good heed unto yourself, therefore, meddle not with them, for I will not give you of their land. No, not even one foot breath because I have given man unto Esau for possession. That's why we are moving through this stuff. We are moving out. PENTECOST CANNOT STOP US. We are moving out because there is an attraction. WHEN MARTIN LUTHER GOT THE ATTRACTION, HE MOVED THE PILLAR of fire move and it moved them to that is justification. The pill of move further to sanctification. THE PILL MOVE FURTHER to Pentecost restoration of the gift. &gt;&gt; But today it has moved to the promised land. &gt;&gt; That's why you sit here tonight. You have come back to your inheritance. &gt;&gt; You are back home. &gt;&gt; I SHALL RESTORE US, SAYS THE LORD. &gt;&gt; I will bring you back to this land. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why you sit here. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Back to the promised land. The word of God. &gt;&gt; That is your inheritance. &gt;&gt; It is set. The stage is set to go for it to go to the promise. That's why we here. GOD GAVE ISRAEL A SUPER SIGN, BUT THEY REFUSE TO SEE THEIR SIGN. A VIRGIN SHALL CONCEIVE. THERE IS NO SIGN THAT CAN SURPASS THIS ONE. NO SIGN. No sign. I WILL GIVE THEM A SUPER SIGN. &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT DID he do with their son? They rubbish it. They refuse to take their sign. But rather they went back to Jesus Christ. Please give us a sign. Jesus said you guys you are asking for a sign. I HAVE GIVEN YOU A sign and NOW YOU ARE CALLING ME THAT I was born out of wedlock. You are calling me a fornicator. You are calling me that I'm born of fornication. &gt;&gt; Look at how you are treating your sign. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE CALLING ME BB. LOOK AT HOW YOU ARE TREATING YOUR SIGN. YOU HAVE SEEN THE SIGN OF THE MESSIAH. Look at what you are talking about. &gt;&gt; Now you WANT TO SEE A SIGN. NO SIGN WILL BE GIVEN UNTO YOU BUT THAT OF JONAS. THREE DAYS IN THE HEART OF THE of the whale. So the son of man, &gt;&gt; this your sign friends. Jesus told them that I you will receive the son of Jonah. THEY PREDESTINATED WHEN THEY TURN ASIDE WHEN THE angel was with his his master John the Baptist he saw Jesus walk past said behold the lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world MASTER SO YOU COULD NOT TAKE AWAY my sins no that's not my business it's not my job this one he will take away said master baba you finish your Bye-bye. If you couldn't take away my sin, I'll follow this one. He followed Jesus. Jesus turned around said, "My friend, whom do you whom do you seek?" said, "Master, I want to know where you live." Said, "Come on." HE STAYED WITH HIM THAT NIGHT and he OPENED THE SCRIPTURE. HE TOLD HIM ALL ABOUT HIM. &gt;&gt; HIS HEART, &gt;&gt; ALL WAS IN him was told. Amen. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "MASTER, MY FATHER JONAS TOLD ME THAT MESSIAH WILL COME. WE HAVE RECEIVED FAKE MESSIAHS, FAKE MESSIAH, PRETENDERS, &gt;&gt; BUT I am convinced &gt;&gt; you a scriptural messiah." &gt;&gt; I'll go and call my brother. Brother said, "Don't be a selfish Christian when you see Jesus. Call somebody." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. When you see Jesus, the reason we can't call people is because our character is not good. &gt;&gt; Let it be honest &gt;&gt; because even if your mouth cannot speak, your attitude, your behavior, YOUR CONDUCT, YOUR CHARACTER WILL CALL PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Like somebody TOLD THE PASTOR WHEN YOU WAS convinced for baptism, the pastor said, "You want to baptize?" He said, "Yes, I want to baptize today." What happened to you? Is it the message I preach? I said, "No, it was good, but not the message. is the sons that is it was good but not but what happened he said pastor there is a brother in the church he's in the same company we work together that brother you kick him he will not talk you abuse him he will not talk whatever you do to that brother pastor I want to be like that brother &gt;&gt; hallelujah I want to BE LIKE THAT YOUR CHARACTER WILL CONVINCE SOMEBODY. &gt;&gt; YOUR CHARACTER WILL WIN SOMEBODY to Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you honestly, there are some people you go closer to them is death. Some people you go closer to them is life. &gt;&gt; Listen, MANY PEOPLE SAW ZAKIEL SAW THE SIGN. ANDREW SAW THE SIGN. NAT SAW THE SIGN. THE WOMAN AT THE WELL THEY SAW THE SIGN THEY WERE ATTRACTED AND WHEN THEY SAW THE SIGN THEY SAW A SCRIPTURAL PROPHET BECAUSE THIS WOMAN at the well master I know that Messiah cometh and he come this will be his sign this will be the Messiah sign he will know our heart who are you by the way woman I cannot hide from you you are Abraham's seed I that speak unto you I am He &gt;&gt; he saw the sign and the voice came forth. &gt;&gt; You understand? THE PROPHET IS A SIGN. A sign that the word of God is ready to be fulfilled. Anytime you see the voice that the a sign, a prophet, God is ready to speak. AGAIN, THE COMING OF THE prophet is a sign. Do you know that the coming of the prophet to the age is a sign? Now I don't mean a doctor of divinity. I don't mean some royal pastor, some good person. That is fine. Them is also God's servant. But a prophet is a sign. THE BIBLE says so here. And what's the sign of? It is a sign that the word of God is fixing to fulfill &gt;&gt; to fulfill for the voice of this prophet sign. Notice the coming of the prophet is a warning sign of judgment is at hand. Did you know that judgment is ready to strike? &gt;&gt; That's why God sent a prophet to the land. That's why he told you I will give you a ledger. I'll send you a ledger, the prophet otherwise I'll come and strike the earth with a curse. Which means there is going to be a curse. GOD IS GOING TO STRIKE THIS EARTH. BUT BEFORE THAT, HE WILL GIVE us a prophet. He will send a prophet and the prophet is a sign that God is ready to strike. &gt;&gt; Amen. The trouble with the Pentecostals and all the other churches, they fail to recognize the God-given son. Abraham said, "Hear me, thus say the Lord. This is your last sign. If anything rises greater than this, call me a false prophet. That is why nobody, nobody can really joke WITH THIS MESSAGE. DON'T DON'T DON'T PRESUME. PEOPLE WANT TO really put their finger in this message. Don't try to do it. God sent a prophet and we will take from the prophet and give to the people. You don't you don't have to bring your revelation, your ideas or your your intellectual. No, we don't need that. &gt;&gt; We don't need that. That's what people are trying to do. &gt;&gt; I'm going on the field. I know what I'm talking about. People want to try to put something to to make them big bishops. They have the privilege. They understand the Bible. They understand everything. All the messages in their bosom. May God HAVE MERCY. &gt;&gt; THIS MESSAGE IS SIMPLICITY. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Like I told my friend Brah Quinton when a a minister called me to preach in Togo and he has really called a big big name in Ghana. One big name in Ghana and that big name excuse him said no I cannot come. So my friend Brad Don the voice of God represented in Rome he said I have a friend Thomas if you get his number and call him. So he called me. I said, "Okay, I'll go and then hold the convention, the meeting for them in Togo." When I got to the station and the brother drove to pick me, when he saw me, he this brother, what can he preach? So he said he was very disappointed. So he took me in the car, he went and then took me to the hotel. Then he he the service start. I went to the poopy like this. After the SERVICE FIRE FELL EVERYWHERE and after the service he came to the office and he knelt down beside me like I was sitting he come brother forgive me I said brother what have you done to me said no let me tell you when I pick you at the station I was disappointed in you but brother forgive me from that time any He is always calling me to come prayer. It is not the big name THAT PREACH THE MESSAGE. IT'S THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; BUT PEOPLE GIVE GIVE THEY PUT premium on big names. &gt;&gt; When you have a good pastor is a gift, &gt;&gt; not a big name. Maybe brother Jack might not have a big name in America but we are not dealing with big names. &gt;&gt; We are dealing with Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; BROTHER SAID YOU ARE RECEIVING YOUR LAST SIGN. THIS IS THE LAST SIGN TO THE GENTILES. ABRAHAM RECEIVED THE LAST son and Isaac appeared. No sign was given to him AGAIN WHEN HE SAW GOD IN FLESH. That was THE LAST SIGN. WHEN ISRAEL ALSO RECEIVED THE LAST SON, they saw God in flesh. &gt;&gt; TODAY WE THE GENTILES, WE were not privileged. BUT TODAY, THIS IS our day to SEE GOD IN FLESH. AND THAT IS OUR LAST SIGN. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet said. &gt;&gt; That's our last sign to see God in flesh. And that is why we should not make mistake. Brother is not God. Brother Abraham IS NOT CHRIST. BUT GOD HAS REVEALED HIMSELF IN human flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why today I'm confident that God is on earth. Brother said God is on earth. &gt;&gt; Not this one. This one is a polluted earth. God has to cleanse it and renovate it. &gt;&gt; But he has finished with you. &gt;&gt; He has renovated you. &gt;&gt; That's why he is SITTING IN YOU. &gt;&gt; GOD IS ON EARTH. This earth &gt;&gt; is where Jesus is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus on earth. &gt;&gt; Jesus in you. &gt;&gt; The hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; BUT HE'S GOING TO CLEANSE this one in the millennium and he'll bring it down here. But today when I see you, I've seen Jesus. That is why you should not disappoint me. You should not disappoint your brother. Let your brother see Jesus in you. AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOUR CONDUCT, EVERYTHING. &gt;&gt; LET US SPELL OUT JESUS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GLORY. &gt;&gt; BROTHER, we must be honest TO OURSELVES. IT IS TIME TO TURN ASIDE. LET US TURN ASIDE FROM ALL THIS WORLDLY THINGS. ALL THIS STUFF. YOU AMERICA, YOU are you are saddled with many. I know lot of things. Lot of deaths. Lot of So you are working. It's not easy. We know. We know. And then you support missions. You stop a lot of things. But you must also have time AND TURN ASIDE. TURN ASIDE. &gt;&gt; LOOK UNTO JESUS. &gt;&gt; Have time for God. That's the last sign. Beloved, you must turn aside. And when you turn aside, be very attentive. Listen to the voice. DON'T ONLY BE ATTRACTED with a sign but look at the voice. Brother said LOOK MAYBE YOU ARE looking for a wife and then you see a sister he he he fit all the qualifications all your requirements. The sister fit into that category but she is not your wife yet. You are just admiring her. Just open your mouth and give her you are that is offer. And when he she accept then he becomes yours. &gt;&gt; Otherwise you'll be admired. Oh this sister is nice. Oh you understand? If if I was a young man I'm looking for a wife to be married and there stood a girl he met every qualification that I thought it would be good to take him for a wife. Why morally? She was a queen, a lovely, fine personality, a fine Christian, everything that I could think of to make me a good wife. NO MATTER HOW MUCH I say she's perfect, she is exactly right. She isn't mine till accept her and the responsibility of her being my wife. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE JUST ADMIRING. SO ALSO THIS MESSAGE that is the same thing like the message you must say it IS RIGHT. THE MESSAGE IS RIGHT or this that and that you become a sympathizer sympathizing with the message I believe this that is the truth I BELIEVE IT BUT YOU HAVE GOT TO ACCEPT IT AND IT HAS GOT TO BECOME PART of you and you become part of it &gt;&gt; then it become yours &gt;&gt; YOU MUST BECOME PART OF THE MESSAGE BECOME PART OF MALACHI 4 DON'T STAND ON THE SIDELINE ON the fence and the admir Malachi 4. Oh, that's good. That's a good message. You must be part. &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus said that day you shall know I in God, God in me and I in you. &gt;&gt; This is the day then you are part of Jesus. He look onto you and say flesh of my flesh, bone of my bone. Samson was a GREAT MAN AS HIS FOCUS was turned on God. Said he was a great man as long as he followed the Lord and kept his commandment. The same thing as long as the church walk with God and keeps his commandment, God can use the church. But when the the church GET OFF ON THE SLAND AS Samson did, then God can't use the church anymore. What can you say more? Because you have turned from God's requirements. SAMSON, HE WAS A STRONG man because he was complying with all God's requirement. His laws were there. Everything the covenant was there. So he was a strong man. But when he went flirting with the world and then Delila put her to sleep on her lap. May God have mercy like a pre David is that awake from your sleep. It is time to awake brother. But when you awake from your sleep be careful that your locks are not off. All right. &gt;&gt; When you wake up, make sure your loss are not off. &gt;&gt; Noah, they they were unlookers. Unlookers that stay with the scientists and rejected the God-given sign and the voice. They rejected it. Noah, there's no way rain can come from heaven. Look at the signs. Look at the machines. It proved that there's nothing nothing rain comes from the the ground. It doesn't come from heaven. Science dispute disputed they disprove what Noah was preaching. Today we are facing the same challenge. Leave that man. He he he was trying to call himself God and God kill him. That's what the Pentecost are talking. The man was trying to say he was God. He was something else and God kill him. May God have mercy. But brother, YOU HAVE PULLED THE LENS. YOU HAVE FOCUSED IN AND NOW YOU ARE CONVINCED THAT THIS IS A VINDICATED PROPHET. &gt;&gt; NOTHING, nothing can pull you away from this. &gt;&gt; Nobody can deceive you &gt;&gt; because you are part of this message. &gt;&gt; The 10 spires, THEY WENT TO THE PROMISED LAND. BUT Pet I mean Joshua and Caleb, they were keenly following the pillar of fire. You understand this message? Set your eyes on Christ. &gt;&gt; Don't look onto anyone. You look onto your sister, you'll be disappointed. &gt;&gt; You look onto Brian Thomas, you'll be disappointed. &gt;&gt; LOOK ONTO JESUS. &gt;&gt; HE IS YOUR EXAMPLE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? JOSHUA AND CALEB BECAUSE THEY WERE FOCUSED. THEY WERE LOOKING AT THE PILLAR OF FIRE. THEY HAVE TURNED ASIDE. THEY DON'T CARE WHO WHATEVER IS GOING ON. ALL THEIR CONCERN was to look onto the pillar OF FIRE. WHEN IT MOVES, they move. When it stop, they stop. &gt;&gt; Praise God, &gt;&gt; friends. And finally, the pillar of fire got to the promised land. And it hang on the promised land. And Joshua and Kell saw it. Said, "Finally, we have come to our destination. WHEN YOU WATCH, you look at THE PILLAR OF FIRE AND YOU ARE SICK AND THE PILLAR OF FIRE PROMISE YOU AND HE PUT YOU ON YOUR INHERITANCE. BY MY STRIPES YOU ARE HEALED. WHEN YOU SEE THE PILL OF FIRE RIGHT THERE, you'll be convinced that you have arrived. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You'll be convinced. Nobody can take it from you. No doctor can take it from you. &gt;&gt; Doctor, you say I would not be healed. The pillar of fire has brought me to the promised land. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. &gt;&gt; You understand? Caleb and Joshua once they were looking at father Abraham footprints BECAUSE IN GENESIS 13 REMEMBER WHEN ABRAHAM GOT TO THE LAND AFTER HE HAS SEPARATED from Lot, you have to get away from all those KIND OF STUFF UNTIL GOD can show you your inheritance. &gt;&gt; IF YOU WANT TO SEE YOUR INHERITANCE, YOU HAVE TO SEPARATE YOURSELF and God will show you your inheritance. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what he did to to to Abraham. Abraham, separate yourself from this guy &gt;&gt; before I can show you your inheritance. &gt;&gt; And when they separated, he did not HE DID NOT TELL ABRAHAM TO SIT ON THAT ON THAT on that e or that tree and then begin to draw a plan. Abraham could have tell God, Lord, I am a good architect. I can draw. Let me stay here and then draw that mountain river Ephites. This Yeah, let me draw it. No, God said, "Walk through the land." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what God told him. Walk through the land, the length and the breath because footprints is the possession. &gt;&gt; JOSHUA AND KALEB COME TO THE SAME PLACE. THEY KNOW FATHER ABRAHAM'S FOOTPRINTED THERE. SO THEY WERE looking at the footprint OF FATHER ABRAHAM. TODAY I AM LOOKING AT THE FOOTPRINT OF JESUS CHRIST. JESUS STEP HERE. JESUS step here. Jesus step here. Jesus step here. &gt;&gt; Nobody can take that from me. &gt;&gt; You understand? And because I'm stepping in the footprints of Jesus Christ brother I am confident. Far Abraham STEPPED HERE. BUT THE OTHER 10 GUYS, they were looking at the opposition. Wow. Golth, these guys are giants. Hey, he can't take the land. Brother, you are looking AT THE CANCER. YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE SICKNESS. OH, I cannot be healed. WOW. A CHILD OF GOD, YOU YOU CANNOT MAKE YOUR CLAIM. &gt;&gt; DON'T PUT JESUS TO SHAME. HE PAID THE PRICE OF SIN. HE PAID THE PRICE OF YOUR SICKNESS. &gt;&gt; HE DIED SO THAT YOU LIVE. &gt;&gt; Turn aside. We'll be closing very soon. This is evening service. We cannot stay long. Brother, I want somebody to turn aside. &gt;&gt; Turn aside and look unto Jesus. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Jonah when he turned from his responsibility and he he joined the ship of Tashes. Many people have joined that ship. You remember the time you joined the ship of Tashes? You were also riding the ship of Tashes. One day you were going the wrong direction. You took the wrong route. But you got to a place that there was a tumble. There was a great storm. And what happened? They have to throw you overboard. THEY THROW YOU FROM THE CHURCH. THEY THROW YOU because they could not contain you. denomination couldn't contain you again &gt;&gt; because you have pulled the focus. Jonah said, "Hey, my friends, you are trying to throw all stuff into the sea. If you don't throw me, you will never have peace. &gt;&gt; You don't have peace." And when they throw him, there was the the storm was calm. Everything was calm. Wow. They were astonished and they were afraid because Jonah identify himself to these guys. I am the servant of the most high God. FRIENDS, TURN ASIDE WHEN ELISHA he saw THE MESSAGE OF HIS DAY ELIJAH AND HE SAW THE MANTLE WHEN HE PUT THE MANTLE ON HIM AND HE WEAR IT. It didn't fit him at that time. He has to go through some training. You understand first king 19 when you put the mantle on him it couldn't fit him he said master said you have to be trained you need training so I'll follow you they come to battle said Elisha this is where the altar is this where they kill the sacrifice when you are here you eat meat meat they kill lot meet here. This is the altar better. So stay right here. Said, "Master, my belly is not is not for food. I am my eye is on the mantle. My eyes is ON THE POWER THE HOLY GHOST in you. That's what I'm eyeing. I will FOLLOW YOU." HE TURNED ASIDE FROM ALL THOSE THINGS, ALL THE PRIESTS, HOW THEY WERE KILLING SHEEP, KILLING GOATS AT BATTLE. HE TURNED ASIDE, FOLLOWED THE MASTER. They come to Jericho. There was the sons of the prophet. They maybe they were prophesying. They were prophesying. They were prophesying to exile. It was just a a great excitement. It was an attraction. But Elisha, he turned aside. He said, "Master, don't ask me to go and join those staff. I will follow you." HE GOT TO JORDAN. HE SAID STAY AT THIS SIDE OF the door that I'm crossing over. Said master you you mean I should stay at THE BANK BEFORE ELIJAH REALIZE HE HAS to cross over to the land THE OTHER SIDE. WHEN JESUS IS crossing cross also DON'T WAIT CROSS OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE. And when he cross Elijah look at him say my friend you have prevailed. You made it. You made it. Ask whatever you want. It should be given unto you. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE COME TO. WE HAVE CROSS JORDAN. JORDAN MEANS DEATH. WHEN YOU DIE, WHEN ALL THE WELLIES, EVERY STUFF DIE OUT OF YOU. Ask whatever you want. It should be given unto you. &gt;&gt; How many want to take a trip to Jordan? &gt;&gt; Cross Jordan. Die. Friends, it is time to turn aside. Turn aside. WHEN MOUNTAIN SUNSET, LOOK AT THE PEOPLE. THEY SAY IT WAS A JET PLANE. Some smoke, some smoke formed the cloud. When they turn aside, that's what they saw by their opinion. BUT WHEN I TURN ASIDE, I SAW THE CONSTELLATION OF ANGELS. AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's what I saw. God, the angels returning to glory after they brought a message. &gt;&gt; But if you saw cloud, take it. That is you. That's why we have str interpretation in this message. Strange strange. And you the youngest people are putting all those fool THINGS ON THE ON THE INTERNET AND PEOPLE ARE READING READING. How many books have you read and then you are looking at people's opinion on the internet. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; What will that research do you? It will not do you good but it will do you harm. &gt;&gt; Turn aside from all those things. Look onto Jesus. Focusing. Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever. Focusing from Genesis to Revelation. You will see him. Amen. Saul, he was persecuting the church. But when the pillar of fire strike him that day, he turned aside and he remembered his father Moses said, "This is the fire that my father met right away." He called him, "Lord, what do you want me? What do you have me to do for you?" Can you recognize him? The pillar of fire in the message shalom said the pillar of fire started this church. It to end this church. Paul pillar of fire. William pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; PILLAR OF FIRE IS RIGHT HERE WITH US. &gt;&gt; HE NEVER LEFT US. &gt;&gt; HE'S RIGHT IN THE CAMP. &gt;&gt; IT'S BECAUSE THAT WE DON'T PULL THE FOCUS. YOU HAVE TO ROB YOUR EYES. LET US AWAY FROM OUR SLUMBER. YOU WILL SEE THE SAME PILLAR OF FIRE. YOU SEE THE POWER OF GOD. THE WORKS THAT I DO, he shall also do &gt;&gt; that the commission. Otherwise, he told a lie. &gt;&gt; He's with us. &gt;&gt; He can never leave us. He said, I will never leave you nor forsake you. I will be with you until the end of the world. That's a promise. You understand? So, it is time for us to turn aside. Let us look onto Jesus. Turn aside from all the fake imperson impersonators people TRY TO IMPERSONATE. TURN aside the prophesied in the message. Look the same message. Look the this is 63 0428 paragraph 2 292. The same in this group brother. This is re genuine spiritfilled men and women. Re you can't put finger on their life. Won't you look and leave this evening? It was morning. Look away from the imp impersonators. LOOK AWAY FROM THEM. THE ones that will be fanatics. Look away from all that and look to the real Jesus. We are it recorded in his word. Hallelujah. To those that look for him. the second time he will appear. We are looking for his second coming. That is in the book of Hebrews. Hebrews chapter 9 vers 28. Those that look for HIS SECOND COMING TURN ASIDE. DON'T JOIN the moners who are always making preparation to appoint cap captains to take them BACK TO EGYPT. MERS THEY WERE weeping mourning. Moses why do you bring us here? WE ARE GOING TO APPOINT captains and go back to Egypt and eat garlic. May God have mercy. How many people want to go back to Egypt? Brother, you don't need any captain. The captain is in the camp, the pillar of fire. Moses, the anointed prophet. But these people, they wanted to appoint captains and go back to Egypt in the me in Numbers 14, chapter 4. Numbers chapter 14. And they said one to another, let us make a captain, and let us return to Egypt. Why do you need another captain? May God have mercy on us. The captain is in the come. Is somebody ready as we going to pray? Are you ready TO TURN ASIDE? TURN YOUR ASIDE FROM ALL THIS KIND OF THING. All this thing that give you attention be attracted by the Holy Ghost. If you are not born again, let us not take chances. This time the message we have to preach to you guys is Holy Ghost fire. You need it. You need that perpetual FIRE TO BE BURNING IN your life. &gt;&gt; It to consume ALL THE WORLDLY THINGS, all the stuff. It to consume. That's what the fire is SENT FOR TO BURN ALL THOSE THING OUT OF YOUR life &gt;&gt; and then Christ will get a good place to stay. The fire comes first before Christ. You understand? The same said, let us put a smile on the face of Jesus Christ. Put a smile on HIS FACE. THE REPORT THE HOLY GHOST IS ALWAYS periodically sending report. Your conduct is always being reported to Jesus to the Lord. And what report is the Holy Ghost carrying along? Ask yourself in a message say hear him say he go WITH A REPORT. FATHER, your son is doing good. Oh, your daughter. I'm proud of your daughter. She's good. Then Jesus will sit and then chess out. That is my daughter. &gt;&gt; THAT'S MY DAUGHTER. BUT WHEN THE REPORT becomes otherwise, oh Jesus, is that your daughter? Oh, she has brought such a shame and reproach. Then Jesus head will drop like that. FRIENDS, LET THE LORD JESUS HEAD NOT DROP. LET HIS HEAD BE STRAIGHTENED LIKE THIS AND SAID, "THAT IS MY SON. &gt;&gt; THAT is my daughter." &gt;&gt; Make Jesus proud tonight. &gt;&gt; We are going to turn aside. Are you ready to pray? &gt;&gt; Turn aside. Look unto him. He's calling you. He's calling you. When you call Moses, Moses turn aside. So, can't you hear his voice? He's calling you. It is time to turn and look onto Jesus. Forget about all the obstacles, whatever, the hindrances, the all the the the hangings, whatever. Turn and look onto him. We are going to pray. Are you ready to pray? Will you turn aside? God is calling you. Like I love that son. Wasted years. Wasted years. Oh, how foolish. As you walk in darkness and in fears, turn aside. Turn aside. God is calling. He's calling you from a life of wasted years. I want somebody to talk to Jesus. Let Jesus hear your voice tonight. Talk to him. Tell him, "Lord, I've heard I've seen the attraction. There's such an attraction and I turn I'm turning aside tonight and THERE IS A VOICE IN THAT ATTRACTION. THERE'S A VOICE in the sun. Jesus will speak to you. Your heart desire will BE MET TONIGHT. JUST TURN ASIDE. HE HAS A PACKAGE FOR YOU. Jesus has your solution." Braan said don't look at the problem. The problem is always there. What is important is the solution. The problem will always be there. But the solution is what count. Look at the solution. IF YOU ARE SICK, SICKNESS WILL always be with us as long as we are in this flesh. But the solution is in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; We need that. Just talk to him for a while. open up for him that Lord I am turning aside all the things that mostly attract you God is calling you turn aside he has something special the enemy always said sin is appealing sin is very nice Satan will package you very beautiful to attract somebody. That's how he pack sin. Sin is very attractive. But may God have mercy. Let that not attract somebody here. Turn aside and look at Jesus. Look at the blood. I'm going to pray. If somebody is here tonight and he has really battled it all by himself to no avail, the hour has come. You can walk out here and say, "Ministers, pray for me because I've tried. I've tried. I've fought the battle by myself." But still you couldn't come with any success. Who is here tonight among us that has been fighting battles? You can be on your feet while we are going to pray for you. It's time to turn aside. Don't look at somebody. Close your eyes everyone. Let somebody stand up. Somebody that is fighting battles and then you want Jesus to touch you tonight. The power of God is here. His ambassador is here on earth. The Holy Ghost is still here to do God's will. God bless you. God bless you, precious. God bless you, heavenly father. Nobody can pull somebody from his seat. IT WILL TAKE THE HOLY GHOST TO DO THAT. IT WILL BRING SUCH A CONVICTION TO YOUR SON, YOUR DAUGHTER THAT NO I CANNOT FIGHT THIS BATTLE ALONE. I need a strong hand. AND THAT IS WHY THEY HAVE STOOD UP. THEY STAND UP BECAUSE THEY WANT JESUS TO GIVE THEM a hand. Father, IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST, YOUR SERVANT, I PRONOUNCE ON THIS SISTER AND THIS BROTHER, LET THE HAND OF GOD GIVE THEM THE TOUCH. FATHER, TOUCH THEM TONIGHT. GIVE THEM VICTORY IN THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. WHATEVER THE CHALLENGE MIGHT BE, WHATEVER THE OPPOSITION, WHATEVER THE FAILURE, whatever it is, IN THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST, I PRONOUNCE VICTORY IN JESUS CHRIST'S NAME. FATHER, grant unto your children. Father, the whole congregation maybe they could not stand up, but they are battling with some stuff. Father, may you remember each one of THEM AND ADDRESS ALL ISSUES AND LET YOUR PEOPLE GO FROM HERE REJOICING WITH TESTIMONIES, WITH JOY, WITH HAPPINESS. BECAUSE SHE SAID YOU ARE JOY YOU GAVE UNTO US NOT THE JOY AS THE world givers this peace of God will stay with us through all this eternity help your people help my friend pastor Jack for giving me the opportunity to speak to the bride of Christ thank you father in Jesus Christ's name amend bless Certainly thank the Lord for his word uh on tonight. It's time to turn aside. Uh very very precious word from the Lord. I like the little statement there that um brother Thomas is making regarding people researching uh brother Brandham.
