[Applause] name amen praise the Lord feel like I have one more one more song One More song I wrote um after we did down um we had a big uh live uh worship night recording that we did a few years back and I was I was in charge of organizing it and choosing the songs and making sure everything went smoothly and it was just a huge pressure something I had never experienced before and uh it was very overwhelming and the night before that concert I was trying to pray and and connect with God and just relieve some of that stress and I just couldn't there was a a wall that I was hitting and I was just so surrounded by doubt and little comments that that I'd heard people say indirectly and it was just so overwhelming and uh I just wanted to just let it go and talk to God and there was something that was stopping me and wouldn't let me get there and so I just sat down in the living room and was just didn't know what to do and I just started talking and and I felt like I couldn't pray but I just started to say something say words and I I found myself writing another song and uh so I just started writing these lyrics down and typing them in my phone and I just sat there and once I felt like I expressed what I wanted to say to God I just started reading through it and reading through it and it just I I felt his presence just come in the room and he just felt like he just gave me a big hug and said I got you and I and that it wasn't it wasn't good enough I was like no like you really got me like I I'm not okay tomorrow like I I can't do this on my own like I need to know that you you really got me and he just gave me the biggest spiritual hug in my living room and uh so this song that's the testimony behind this song it doesn't sound like a a very happy song but the testimony behind behind it is is very very uh helpful and very exciting for me [Music] personally my mind is all over being flooded with [Music] thoughts we living moments that wounded my heart I just want a moment to express how I [Music] feel but in this [Music] moment the stress is to reach [Music] Lord can you help me [Music] out pull me out of this house I need you to read my mind and tear out the pages that you don't like I can't hear myself think let alone hear you speak how can I lay my burdens at your feet I Lord I need a breakthrough conversation with you I'm willing to wait as long as it takes I need a clean [Music] slate I need a clean [Music] slate my mind is all over being flooded with [Music] thought the living [Music] moment that wounded my heart I just want a moment to express how I feel but in this moment the stress is is too [Music] real lord can you help me out pull me out of this stwn I need you to read my my mind and tear around the pages that you don't like I

Atlanta and uh we were doing the the uh the message Believers concert there and and um when brother Wesley came on the stage I was telling people it's probably something I shouldn't say publicly amen and I actually didn't say what I wanted to say I just kind of set it up a little ways but I'm going say this since since we at Spirit and Truth Tabernacle amen uh brother Wesley is one of my favorite [Applause] singers you know actually both both him and his wife sister Ashley as I was listening to him they got they got this like soothing voice you know you can put that on at night you know you battling and fighting just put put them singers on and just might just bring a atmosphere and a presence into your home but we really appreciate you all thank you for amen coming to be a [Applause] part amen this is uh this is this is wonderful um um brother Capers at s the song uh I feel the pool well uh brother Wesley's uncle brother Paul La fontain amen is uh who wrote that song so sometimes it's just a blessing when you end up in other congregations and somebody singing a song that you you know the person that wrote it happens all the time with uh my my aunt sister sis sister Lewis uh songs that she has written and they just sung all over the world and uh and I always I always just sit back and said Lord who would have ever thought a song would have came from Florida and ended up all all over like this but God is good amen God is good God is good so good to have everybody in the house of the Lord on today amen and uh I won't delay the time um you all are fully aware of where we are amen the uh the Lord had placed in my heart some time or before I get there uh to do this family series but before I get into the sermon Friday night we were absolutely [Applause] blessed um you know just I appreciate the young people and and parents you know you know I I was telling Church on Friday night that I I was talking to somebody just last week and they're telling me how they have a lot of young people young people in the church but the the their Church does nothing nothing for the young people no Services nothing happens for the young people at all and uh and I'm like well you know we we we don't have a lot but we're going to do something with the ones we got you know and uh Friday night we had that service and my brother Jerry just uh had a wonderful talk to the young people and and we all just feasted on the word of the Lord so we appreciate you brother Jerry thank you so much amen for um for the word amen uh and and I do want to say thank the Lord I know we

was battling Amen brother Quinton Jr is battling sister Cobb is battling amen but we thank God for victory Amen in the midst of all of this praise God Amen and you know one thing that we cannot do is live in fear that's right amen and you know and I know that uh different ones were taking test and and it was not showing that it was Co it wasn't showing Co and now you know we get to a point where you you don't even know what it is you know it's just a devil that's amen and uh and you have power over every devil come on no matter what form it comes in you got power over every devil amen so so so use your loud voice and speak against that devil amen and claim your healing in your body amen amen so we we thank God for the victory for each and every situation amen all right um let's uh as I said we are in our family series amen this is where the Lord has us at this moment and and I'm just um crazy enough to believe I I this just the way I believe I'm so crazy that the sermon that God gave me to give y'all is the one that he wanted you to here right I'm that crazy to believe that the one that God gave me for the for the Full House amen that this the one he wanted you to hear all right amen so we going we going to enjoy ourselves this morning how many just love the word all right all right cuz we going to preach the word this morning don't tighten up it's okay I I I learn amen I can say Amen to myself cuz I got one on the inside I I got one on the inside amen so praise the Lord I know sometime you get into areas like this and people get real quiet like brother quu told us that's when people really thanking yes sir they thanking they thanking they thanking amen we're going to make it through by the grace of God all right amen all right let's stand let's read the word of the Lord amen let's go to Ephesians 5 amen and um we will read just a couple verses you can go next on that slide and just one more next for me all right just leave it right there nope go back go back okay thank you very much um here in Ephesians 5 the Bible says uh wives verse 22 wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything let's have a word of prayer uh father we have read the word of the Lord and God God we uh know that you have purpose for placing these uh things in scripture and as the Holy Spirit would just take us now Lord into uh this thought that you have as we're dealing with the families we realize there is a major attack on families uh it's a structure that you established way back in Genesis when uh Adam was uh there in the garden you say it's not good for man to be alone and Lord you provideed a wife for him but God it wasn't just amen uh so he could just have a wife and and today people have wives just because it's eye candy but God you gave him a wife because there was a Commandment that they were supposed to be fruitful and to multiply so you knew that there would be children that would come forth on the earth and uh God you established certain things for the family our focus our H agenda our attempt today Lord is to help us get our mind Minds amen around your thoughts concerning family and God if we can wrap our minds around that then Lord uh things will just go a lot more smooth uh smoother in our in our home so we ask that you would just come Lord uh speak to us thank you for everything that has happened thus far the song service amen the specials that went forth we we thank you for each and every one uh being here and being present we ask God that you would speak to every heart not just those here but those also online in Jesus name we pray amen and amen God bless you you can be seated Amen in the presence of the Lord amen let me just get myself set up here all right you can see a man uh I I I I put that slide there with that picture I just like that because this just kind of gives us a little picture of what God has in mind for the family Christ is the head of the family amen Jesus Christ is the head of every family uh my brother if you're looking for a wife and she's not submitted to Christ you don't want to marry her my sister if you're praying that God would send you a husband you want to make sure that that man is has a life that is submitted to Christ because if it's not submitted to Christ you don't want to marry that man uh this would be trouble all the days of your life hello somebody you want you want a person that has amen the ability to submit themselves to their headship of Christ and when I say the headship of Christ let me just make it a little bit more clear amen this is Christ am that's right the headship of the word amen is submitting to Christ yes sir hello somebody amen and and there are sometimes things that will come up in Scripture that you may not necessarily See Clearly but you still have to learn to submit to it you say Amen even when you don't understand God I don't see it just yet but I say Amen to it and I know you'll show me and do time all right but the husband as well as the wife needs to be submitted to Christ and notice now we have the Christ Christ first and God puts the husband amen next underneath that umbrella and he has to cover the family he has to cover his wife and his children amen and and he's the protector he's to lead the family he's to provide for the family and then you know the wife kind of comes in and you know now this is this is when we when we look at this this is really uh the structure that God set up now we realize we live in a world where this structure has really been uh distorted sir hello somebody amen and because of this because of the Distortion of the structure amen if I had another uh picture diagram amen they would move the wife right up right next to the husband and some must done done that already but that ain't what God established hello somebody that's not what God EST that's what that's what Society has established but it's not what God established now we're going to go back to the scripture to see what God established but the way God put it is that the husband would be protector leader provider and then the wife would come in and she's to comfort she's to teach she's to nurture brother brandom even said that the Fifth Gospel The Fifth Gospel was coming from the wife but she had she she would have the ability to to raise her kids and to teach her kids and I mean you go back to the Garden of Eden when when when the punishments were dished out it was Adam that had to go out and work it wasn't Eve's job to do that right that's right brother that was Adam's job to go out and work now I realize we live in a society we live in a world where they're forcing the women to have to go out to work I realize that but that does not change the structure that God has in place all right all right all right but the wife amen she Comfort she teaches she Nur nourishes and then the children underneath all that umbrella now we have children today trying to go from here to up here they want to tell the parents what to do but I I I'm going tell you like this if you going to tell me what to do then you going to provide protection hello you going to put a roof over my head that's right and I'mma say eat up all your groceries that's right if you going to tell me what to do hell then you going to have to go to work yes you going to have to pay the bills that's right hello truth long as you underneath the umbrella long as you underneath the house then you just love and obey your parents am amen a statement that I want to make from the prophet here because we're talking about why submitting to their husbands brother Brandon makes a statement says I was preaching the other night somewhere about women to obey their husband uhhuh he says obey and that's you know people like obey they see let me just tell you this right now and I I said it before I'm going say it again if I'm marrying a couple and they want to do their own vows I have no problem with that there's only one other thing I'm going to add I'm going to also do my vows as a preacher the vows that I do are write out a little book that I always read and in that book it says love honor and obey yes right and I'm going read that in your in your ceremony and I'm I'm I'm going hear you say I will hello somebody we we not changing things that's try to sound cute amen marriage means something yes it does Amen right and he he says about women obey their husband obey yeah that that that went out of the marriage ritual a long time ago but they ain't going to do that no sir they live in America and they let you know so right they're not going to obey but as long as you don't do it now he's talking to the sisters with that Spirit but as long as you don't do it don't never try to call yourself a Christian because you're not I don't care how much you dance and speak with tongues if you don't obey your husband you're out of the will of God Amen if you don't obey your husb husband you are out of the will of God your young sisters before you get married just make sure it's a young man that you can obey hello make sure you can obey him don't don't ever think that you get into the relationship so you can run things cuz you find yourself out of the will of God things don't work that way you got to be able to obey your husband all right next brother random makes this quoted marriage and divorce he says now we see being that the continuity is broken then the lifeline was broken also the timeline was broken the Covenant was broken everything shattered what caused it we're going back to the original what cus it a woman that's what broke the Covenant now if you want to read that you can read it in Genesis 3 it says now it was then it was then man was made to rule over the woman by God's word Genesis 3 we're going to read it it was then man was made to rule over the woman by God's word she was no more co-equal with him because of what happened in the Garden of Eden the wife is no more coequal with her husband and if we don't understand what happened in the garden we go back to Genesis uh chapter 2 and chapter 3 amen it was Eve that was deceived by the serpent we're going to read it it was and because of that deception uh there God has established a certain order a certain place amen for the husband and for the wife praise the Lord we're doing things based on what happened in Genesis glory to God not by what's happening in the world but by what happened in Genesis amen church we we want to go back to that original amen marriage that's that's what we're striving for that's what we're looking for all right so so he says she was no more co-equal with him she was co-equal in nature you know but when she broke God's word God made a man to be a ruler over her Genesis 3:16 if you want to put it down she was no more equal with the man she was a breaker of God's word don't you see see the church down here the breaker of God's word that throwed her completely out of continuity and that's what the church has done it's throw uh throw spiritual death upon the whole thing now you understand why I hammer at these things like I do it's truth it this is Bible facts notice why did she do such a thing as this how could that lovely beautiful perfect woman I seen a picture one time I believe was in Greece of an artist that painted a picture of Eve she was the most horrible looking thing you ever seen that shows what a carnal mind can look at but she wasn't she was beautiful because she was a perfect she was perfect woman all woman I I like that Eve was all woman yes sir we got a lot of EES today that think they man right but when God made Eve she was all woman other thing we know about what God did when he when he made Adam and Eve they were he was both male he was masculine and feminine at the same time but God had to take the feminine Spirit out of Adam and he gave that to Eve praise the Lord so when a man turns around and has a feminine spirit in him you know something wrong somewhere let me put it this way that did not come from God yes sir no sir Hallelujah now now I want I want I'm going say this you know just the same way that they're trying to force us to accept the homosexual gender there's a spirit in the land that's also trying to force the sisters to get away from the image that God had for them in Genesis true we we are battling Spirits every day you go to work you battling a spirit amen amen amen every day you go to work you battle a spirit you got to realize it's a spirit yes sir all right let's go on amen amen it ain't got quiet yet but I guess it will be soon let's keep going amen he says uh an artist that painted a picture of Eve she was most uh most horrible looking thing you ever seen that shows what a carnal man can look at but if she wasn't she was a beautiful because she was perfect woman all woman notice why did she do such a thing being in that high order she was right with man co-equal with him but we all know that she lost her co-equal with man when she sinned and God said man would be your ruler from here on out now that's the scripture if you want to we could read it and uh since since he said if you want to we can read it we going to read it we not preaching things outside the Bible that's right this is the scripture and you know so so what we want to do is align ourselves up with scripture now here in Genesis 3 verse we're going to go verse 1-6 but we're going to take it slow says now the serpent this is what happened in the Garden of Eden this is what created the problem where amen a woman is no longer co-equal not not not like that anymore the husband has been made the ruler of the home amen not just in the house but even in the church this this why you see that according to the scripture uh you're not supposed to have woman preach I know that is not uh popular but we here let me just put it this way we're not trying to be popular we're trying to be scriptural I mean and churches all over the place got it and then they they justify but I can't see it according to the word of God the Bible say I Ser not a woman to teach or usur authority over a man and and and when a woman takes this pull she has she has control over the entire congregation sir amen it's spirits in the land it's it's if I can just put it this way it's it's spiritual homosexuality and spiritual lesbianism now the Bible plainly say let the bishop be husband of one wife that that that's the Bible H H how how we going to go over the Bible and now you got women want to be called Bishops that is that is spiritual lesbianism that's right amen amen amen that's what it is see and and we don't need that in the church it's it's sad enough we got to deal with it in the world but we don't need that these are spirits that are coming to the land and we fight daily right we fight daily Amen on the Bible says not a serle was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman now notice the serpent wasn't talking to Adam here he's talking to Eve right he said unto the woman ye hath God said ye shall not eat every tree of the garden now now look at what what what the servant is doing he's actually Amen brother random say he's uh he's not quoting the word but he's coding the word and here what the devil going to do the devil going to try to use the word against youh amen sir that's why not it's good for the Sisters to make sure that they you know before you just run off with a revelation go back to your husband and and and run that thing through him and if you don't have a husband right then you're running through the pastor amen make sure that thing is lining up just right amen uh uh and and and for for young ladies they can go to their father make sure it lines up right so said the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God have said ye shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest ye die right in verse four and servant said unto the woman ye shall not surely die all he did was add one word to what God Said God said you're going to die he said You shall not surely die right and uh so he added one word and that one word threw everything out of out out of out out into chaos right for God doth know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be open and ye shall be as Gods knowing good and evil look at them tricker now look at them tricker verse six next says and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food now I'm just again I I I'm one that believes um this was not a one-time conversation this was something that he just kept working now now I need you to understand something about the serpent the serpent was something made by God it was not not an evil Beast it was made by God go I mean here here even God brought all the animals to to Adam for him to name Adam knew this serpent the only thing about the serpent that it had the ability to talk just like a human could talk it could reason just like a human could reason so Satan knew that this this animal was in the garden Hallelujah and when Satan got kicked out of heaven come on he dropped down into that beast and this was not the serpent talking this was Satan inside the serpent talking am it was Satan that was talking you got be a you got to be able to recognize when the devil is talking and and let me make it very clear the devil will use the word to talk to you right the devil will use the word to talk to so be very careful you got to know whether that's God or whether that's the devil right all right MH that's what he used to with Eve he used the word this one something way out he used the word and he tricked her on one word now let's go he says this and when the woman saw the tree was good for food that means she got involved in something here that's how she saw it was good for food she said and that it was pleasant to their eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and look at this and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat now Adam was with her when she had this act but Adam was with her in the garden so she came and introduced what happened to her to Adam it was the woman that did this and because of what happened to the woman praise the Lord let me uh do something because of what happened to the woman amen uh it put her in a different position Amen in God's order all right all right all right all right let's let's let's look at this verse um verse 7 says and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked now they didn't know this because they had a a veil on before amen but now the veil is taken away and uh and and and here's here's the other problem uh when they sin here they recognize amen that they was naked this is what happened in the very beginning now unfortunately Today We Live in an age where people are blind miserable wretched they're also naked but they don't even know it amen you talk about a mental condition they they have that problem right here today all right so it says uh they were naked and they seed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons and they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the in the garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the Trees of the garden next he says and the Lord God called unto Adam said unto him where art thou and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked this is new language this is new Adam never heard this word before right but after this act he recognized something went wrong now now let's look at this let's look at this and I hid myself and it said who told thee that thou was naked hast thou eaten of the tree whereever I commanded thee thou should us not eat and the man said the woman whom thou gavest to be with me she gave me of the tree and I did eat that is Adam passing the buck Adam is blaming Eve but Adam himself got involved in this now now here the thing is the scripture tells us Adam amen was not deceived Eve was but Adam wasn't Adam willfully walked out into this Hallelujah he knew if God would take Eve out he have to take him out as well yeah amen Adam could not redeem Eve there was nothing in him to redeem only Christ can do to Redemption but Adam willfully walked out hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Hall Hallelujah one of the things brother brand said here about what happened in the Garden of Eden he says a woman can be deceived a thousand times quicker than a man amen a woman can be deceived a thousand times quicker than a man right now I'mma just I'mma just put it like this God and brother Jonathan said it when he was here God put certain things inside of a man that's not inside of a woman and God put certain things inside of a woman that's not inside of the man and once we find our order find our place then the family functions the way it's supposed to function praise the Lord especially when it come to spiritual things don't I mean a sister should not try to lead in those spiritual thing let your husband do the lead and make sure look God put you in this place God call you to this place God equip you with certain things you got to lead this family don't don't go on the other side well he won't do it so I'm going just jump don't do that you get out of the way will of God when you do that I'm going keep preaching I'm going keep preaching it's all right thank y'all for the few amens I I appreciate them but I'm not here to get amens I'm not here to get amens and because I you know like brother quu say they sometime they be coerced uhhuh uhuh and then sometimes it's just uh it's something that's just coming from the depths of your soul and and and coer if we have to co an amen it's not a genine amen that's right the other thing I found about uh preaching is that sometime people say amen hey get off that preacher amen amen amen amen amen amen no no no no no no no no no no no no I'mma keep I'mma keep right on this line we talking about the Family series verse 9 says and the Lord God called on Adam and said to him where art thou and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because th was naked I H hid myself and he said who told thee that thou was naked hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou should us not eat and the man said the woman that whom thou gavest with to be with me she gave me of the tree and I did eat and the Lord God verse uh uh verse 13 says the Lord God said unto the woman what is this that thou Hast done and the woman said the serpent begot me and I did eat and the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou has done this thou are cursed above all cattle now look at what happens here these are the punishments being dissed out I'm not going to go through all of them amen but uh but here it starts with H with the serpent says um uh the Lord God said to the serpent because thou has done this Thou Art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and thust shalt thou eat all the days of life so here the serpent loses his legs he used to stand on two feet like a man but in this spot he loses his legs and now he's on his belly and he's the missing link between man and and and and Animal Kingdom hallelujah it's the serpent that's the missing link glory to God got cursed in the Garden of Eden and that's why they'll never find until they unless they can believe what really happened in Genesis they'll never find what happened all right here and and and the next verse says and I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shall bruise his he that verse alone is speaking of the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ because a woman does not have a seed she has an egg that has to be fertilized with a male seed Hallelujah but but since she since he says thy seed amen it said uh between thy seat and her seed her seed was talking about the birth of the Lord Jesus Christ cuz he was the only one born on this Earth on without a human sensation yes sir God created the the the sperm and the Egg and he brought forth Jesus Christ sir so I can just tell you even in the midst of this so-called mistake God had a plan amen amen God had a plan amen and it was it was being executed so God want I mean nothing happens out of out of you know just just happen stance God always got a plan for what he's doing yes sir all right all right now here verse says unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception and sorrow sh thou bring forth children and you know and and and all y'all sisters that done had a baby y'all know this ain't nothing but the truth what what the Bible say here my my my my my daughter just come through having a child and my my son-in-law said that she was just a different woman when the baby was coming for she was just doing some things that just wasn't one didn't seem normal and she's saying things and I mean and you know everybody get out of here I don't want to see nobody in this I mean just you know it just this is the scripture this is this is some this is something that happened this was a result of what happened in the Garden of Eden and and it's something how a woman can go through all that pain and and and and and and and and and get push that baby out into the world or even if she goes through a cesarian birth or whatever go through all that pain have to be cut and sewed up and go through all that pain and then somehow get a Feeling start talking to her husband about let let's do this again how I I I tried to tell you there certain things that's inside a woman that's right and they not inside of a man because as a man if if if we had to get birth like that I can tell you right now now we wouldn't have too many children on the Earth unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception and sorrow shalt thou bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband that's right and he shall rule over thee this is the scripture he shall rule over thee and here's here's the problem and like I say I know we live we live in a in a very EXP expensive area of the world and it's and many wives have to go out to work and so I wouldn't come up here and preach against the women working I if if you can do it you know I if your household can afford it it's a it's a great thing if your household can afford it but I wouldn't sit here and try to I I know churches that that that just kind of um they make people feel bad if their wife's not at home they make them feel bad I'm not here to put no guilt trip on you I will tell you this that the original plan of God was for the husband to go out to work and the wife to take care of the children that's the original plan of God if you can if you can somehow find a way to fit that original plan I would say do it you might have to cut back on some of your expenses to do it amen but I know sometimes wives do have to go out to work but here's the issue when you go out there sis understand you got to you got even if you boss on the job on right you don't got promoted and you boss you telling everybody what to what to do as you driving home as as you driving home you got have to switch a gear right you going have to dial it way down cuz you ain't boss at the house can I go a little further brother roel came to our church and said this I'mma say this I love it when he said it brother Roy say if if if God has blessed you sister to make amen $11,000 a week and your husband is making $100 a week you know what your $1,000 is to his $100 is a help amen that's right and if you can look at it that way you keep everything in line right amen amen amen hallelujah amen let's go forward next this is a woman's Nation brother brandom tells us that and he makes a statement says notice what takes place Jezebel she ruled Ahab she slammed them around it used to be poor Papa or Mama set home with the baby babies while the drunken husband was out poor Papa now takes care of the baby while the drunken woman is out now that's not a joke that's the truth I'm not speaking of righteous people no sir now this is important that's why I underline it I'm only showing the spirit that is in the world there is a spirit in the world now now now now now now let me just go I'm I'm going to go a little further he said this is woman Nation I want to show you some of the spirits that have come in the world uh first amen just hit next just uh first thing in 1933 brother Brandon prophesied it didn't it didn't it didn't seem like this would happen in 1933 but he prophesied there would be a woman president or vice president and it said also it could type out the Catholic church he told us that right and we are living in the time of the prophecy being fulfilled we have a woman vice president right now and a prophet told us that in 1933 yes sir that's true now when you see a woman president vice president you see just the the where where women have reached to there was a time where women could even vote now look at where we are amen and I mean and and Lord have mercy I shouldn't say this from the pull pit I shouldn't say it some of the people that they give us to choose from to be president are so questionable amen that it forces the people to vote a certain way because we got very questionable characters the next statement I want to just make here in the 1960s and 70s women's rights there was a movement women's rights now now part of this amen uh the women's Liberation and women's rights movement in the 60s and 7s they sought equal opportunity and and and uh also greater personal freedom for women now here's the thing when I say it's spirits that we're fighting because part of is it it seems so it's right right now you know if if if my wife have to work if she has to work I don't want her to go to a job and get paid less doing the same job that if a man was there doing the job he get paid more I everybody know that that's wrong but so when they start pushing this amen with the the the the Equal Rights and and Liberation there was a spirit there and seem right here let me just put it this way there's a way right that seeth right unto men but the end thereof are the ways of death and what it was doing was just kind of setting us up and getting us out of the order that God had established for the family yes sir Spirits brother random say this is a woman Nation next thing he said you just look at our symbol of Freedom next Statue of Liberty is our symbol of Freedom it's a woman amen that's our symbol of freedom for the United States of America he also said next that the flag was made by a woman and you know where this really come from is the church because the next one says that we have the worship of Mary over Christ so this spirit is released from the church and it trickles down into everything else yes sir amen but we trying to get back to Bible order look at this what the prophet says in this next segment it says out of the message just one more time Lord says a woman said I have a right to do what I want to do that's my American privilege the prophet say it is your American privilege It Ain't Your god-given Privilege though and what we're trying to do is get back to our god-given privileges hello somebody all right we're going further amen next says this I I want to just first uh bring this in when when when the Bible's asking or not even asking it's it's it's telling the wives that they need be be be submissive submit yourselves amen wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord and I want to just put this submission is a choice from your heart it's something that you choose to do you choose either to submit or not to submit it's a choice from your heart look at this amen next a woman is not meant to have an iron disposition so it it it shouldn't be the woman saying I'mma put my foot down hello that's right I'mma put my foot down I'm I'mma say how it's going to go around a woman not meant supposed to have that that disposition anytime you get something like that you know a spirit has jumped on top of you amen hello somebody amen I told you it's going to get quiet it's all right it's the word anyhow brother brother brother brother quu told me they thinking about it I'm going to let you think about [Applause] it a woman is not meant to have an iron disposition she is according to the Holy scripture to be submissive to the male that is commanded of her amen a woman who is truly female and look at that that word again all female will be of that disposition look at this not a doormat amen no real male makes a female a doormat but she will want to be under Authority and not to rule over the male for he is the head of the house if she breaks the image that God made for her she is perverted amen all right she is perverted oh I I I I I thank God for the prophet and him just kind of bringing these truths right back to us amen no she's not supposed to just be handled any kind of way right and this is not you know anytime a a preacher has to deal with this subject they just feel like it's it's trying a man being chauvinistic or something like that that's a spirit y'all that's a spirit it's not chauvinism we're trying to get back to Bible order Bible order and and this is why when I started this whole family series I started with the husbands husbands love your wives I started with that and let me tell you when a husband truly loves his wife his wife easily submits to everything that he wants the key to unlocking submission is the husband actually loving the wives as Christ love the church amen it's right here in the scripture yes sir submit means to be subject unto to submit oneself to to arrange under to subordinate to subject uh is is to obey to to to to to submit one's control can I work with that for a little bit when we talk about submission is to submit one's control hello somebody because you know sometimes our sisters amen and again you're made this way you can't help it sometimes you know with the sisters they they need to understand exactly all the details they need to know them details oh y'all ain't going to talk to me truth they they they must how is this going how we going to do this and how we going to do that and I mean you need to explain this thing out and when and when the husband is saying look I'm just I'm believing God he hasn't told me how to do it yet I don't know what to do I I I I I know I'm going from part from point A to point B but how we going to get there I don't know and then it's hard for the wife to submit herself to a guy that just don't know and then what happens is then she begin to try to take control I believe we at Point a and we're going to point B but I'm going I'm going to get us there my Lord when do that you break the image that God has for your family amen Lord submit to one's control yield to one's admonition or advice yield to one's admonition or advice so that means we going to talk about it but you know what the final say in the house has got to be the husband now he may agree with you and he may not agree with you but in your house you got to make your husband the final say Amen hello somebody that's that's what being submissive and sub and subject and the other thing is as a husband he won't be there just because I said so you ain't got no scripture to support your position or nothing my brother just because you said so well make what make that right how you following Christ that's right brother so you going to have to use the word in these I mean you going to have to pray and seek out God give me something out of the scripture you got to be reading the scripture if you want to get something out of the scripture God give me something out the scripture maybe maybe I'm listening to a tape give me something the prophet that I can take and give my wife just a little comfort and consolation that God got this thing under control amen my wife my wife told me sometime that's all she want to hear me says God got it under control and it she said just something about me saying it God got it under control it's going to be all right dear we going to be okay I I don't know how I know he going to make a way and then maybe sometime take your wife through a journey of where God has already brought you from remember we was up against it one time and God did this and and God did that and God did this and it causes her to start thinking a little different when you can share testimonies like that sir it comes a spirit down amen she don't want that iron disposition but what you doing to kind of keep that away from her right hello amen when she takes on the iron disposition she breaks the image that God made for her here the next one brother brandom says this in the message we would see Jesus just like why does a woman every time she gets married put a veil over her face she's coming to her husband the head just like Rebecca did she put a veil over her face to meet Isaac she has no more head Isaac is her head and the church ought to be so so submissive to the word of God that it veils s its own face it has no head look he says the nature of a woman is to submit to a man God put that in a woman to be able to submit to a man and that's what the church ought to be doing submitting to Christ to his word to his Doctrine to his principles she takes no thought for herself she has no head Christ is heard not some ecclesiastical uh Bunch but Christ ishe the word and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us hallelujah now you know um Colossians 3:18 also tells us wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as is fit in the Lord It's a woman is made her nature is to submit to a man her nature is to submit to a man now I want to I want to I want to add a couple things here uh the Bible tells us Colossians 3:18 like I just quote it but there was a a a question asked and I didn't bring this quote up don't worry about trying to pull up the quote just leave the the slide there but there was a question asked to brother brandom one time says should a wife obey a husband I'm a Christian and my husband is a sinner he persecute me in every way that he can for me not to go to church and read my Bible and denies the word what should I do uh what what should you do not listen you're supposed to obey your husband that's that's the word now if he tells you and refuses you to read your read the Bible go to church or something like that you don't have to obey that amen amen so so cuz it's a woman's nature to submit and and Men know this and sometimes a woman don't realize a man will take advantage of your nature and he will use scripture to take advantage of your nature that's right hello somebody am amen you want to make sure he's not doing this in a way that he's doing things in a way of love not in a way to try to uh uh manipulate you cuz that's what s he was using scripture to manipulate Eve in the beginning and you still have men the Daya to do the same thing if he's getting you to do something that's outside the word of God you don't have to obey that amen amen you don't have to obey that because he that will not forsake his father's mother husband wife or whatsoever it is and follow me is not worthy of mine so brother brandom clears that up now let me go a little further here cuz um I I mentioned earlier that sometimes a wife would like to try to take control over things and and and and there was a time like I I want to read not read but I want to just have you think of the story of Rebecca my there was a time Rebecca was so submissive to the will of God here come Eliza praying like Lord let the the young lady that comes out and not only offer me water but offer water to my camels let her be the one that I'm going to take to Isaac right back to to Isaac I I let let that be the one and soon as Ela says amen Here Comes Rebecca to Amen to to the well and she's hey you want some water well let me get some water for your camels he knew right then oh my this is it he begin to give her gifts and and all kind of things and and then he said where your house at I got to go talk to your dad I got to tell him this testimony what just happened God just heard my prayer and uh and and I'm here representing Abraham and I'm looking for a wife for Isaac and he he didn't want no wife from back there he wanted one from right here and uh and say and you the one I believe God is sending to Isaac so he went back and talked to the family and the brother the mother the father and and all of them was sitting there saying well you know what we believe the testimony but let us stay for about 10 more days and uh she they say they said no no don't delay me I got to go now God is moving now I need to take her back right now and they say well I tell you what let her decide on what she'll do Rebecca said I will go never met this man never seen this man just heard the testimonies about this man she say I will go she was willing to leave her daddy's house and submit herself to a man she did not know she did it she went there and got married to Isaac that's Genesis 24 Genesis 25 she was pregnant with two twins and as she got pregnant with these two twins uh she began to pray she began to seek God about what was going on inside of her womb and she was told by God that the older will serve the younger God gave her an answer to her prayer now here in Genesis 26 we see this same Rebecca that submitted herself Amen to leaving her daddy's house and go here to marry man she did not know when she get to Genesis 26 now she is deceiving her own husband yeah and and and and my question is how does a a a sister go from amen being a submissive female Amen to her husband now she get a few chapters later in her life and now she want to rule everything what happened to Rebecca what happened in this house that caused Rebecca to do some of the things she did she didn't have to help God out right by trying to help God out it actually only amen messed up the process but here she's just deing her own husband by telling her something now you need to dress this way you need to do this you need to do that and and I'm going to make you some you know some lentils and I'm going to give you this to go there I I'mma dress up the meat and I'mma do all this and I'm G make this thing taste like like your brother cooked it why is she doing something like watch she trying to control the situation how do we move from this place to this place Lord It's a spirit that comes in somewhere that causes Rebecca to become this type of woman yes sir now it didn't stop God's word from being manifested in her family but it certainly delayed some things she went years without seeing her son because of what she did and and can you imagine the other son right can you imagine the other son Esau when he probably figured out what happened he he probably my my my brother Jacob my brother Jacob my brother Jacob but then when he realized my my own Mama right you mean my mama was in in involved in this and I actually wasn't even it was my mama's plan come on can let me let me just drop this off right here for the parents Mam and daddies do don't you ever show favoritism to one child over the others amen amen you create problems in your own house when you do do that spirits that do this just something for you to think about let's go into the next one the prophet says uh oh for the grace of God that he give us understanding of such great Mysteries as Paul here further Amen on down in Ephesians speaking of the husband and wife it said this is a mystery how the woman should be in respect to their husband even the second place I believe it is uh in the entire Bible that reverence was ever spoke spoke to said the woman seeing she reverence her husband reverence her husband then a husband ought to live such a life before his wife that his wife could reverence him as as a Son of God and if he doesn't live that kind of life well then of course she wouldn't reverence him because she knows what he's made of but when it is a man that is when but when uh but but when it is a man that is reverent rever and clean with his wife and before his family a real servant of God then the women children all should respect that servant of God with a reverence Now understand that was really based on uh a man and the life that he lived that actually produces the reverence from his wife and what brother Rand is referring to a scripture in Ephesians 5:33 nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband now I want to talk about that amen what does this really look like it's reverencing the husband before we get there let me remind you something you can hit next I'm not going to read this whole quote just to underline Parts I believe anything that helps the human race is Godly and the other thing the prover says is you got to look at anything sensible right if you if you if you fail to look at things sensible then you're going to miss it like I told y'all my my I preach from my experience and I didn't put the disclaimer out there but I put it out there again when I'm preaching this the spirit and Truth Tabernacle uh I'm preaching from my experience amen and uh and and some of the things that I've gone through in my journey I've been exposed to teachings am man that I think are very helpful it helped me in my ma my marriage I have gone to to marriage seminars and message churches they don't do it oh y'all ain't going to talk to me but message churches they don't don't do marriage seminars they don't they just think y'all got the word and y'all should be able to do something with it but y'all got the word with problems and don't know how to figure it out amen amen amen it's a truth in house right I mean you know we we have we have we have a lot of problems in the message in Mar in homes and and there's been nobody to go out there and try to bring anything to help us right I know some Churches they don't even counsel Families my Lord but and the family struggling over here they don't even know how to figure their way out of this you know and they won't even try to spend any time with them true but I I I have been exposed to things I I call them tools because they're tools that will help my marriage so I like to share those tools with people wherever I go anytime I'm asked to speak amen about marriage people going to get these tools that I've been given amen they help me all right look at this I I brought this in the last time cuz this this first uh before it talk talked about wives submitting themselves to their their husbands first in verse 21 it in in Ephesians 5:21 it says submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God and I brought this out the way that we do that is uh hit next is with these five love languages hit next twice um the acts of service receiving gifts quality time words of affirmation physical touch it is I I feel like it's so important for you to understand what your spouse's love language is and after you understand what spouse's love language is then you might have to understand what your children's love language is in order to really establish your family I brought you quotes the last time I spoke to the fathers amen where brother brandham actually used all five of these love languages in one situation yes sir I proved it I took it right through right through the message and proved it right so so so these are these are things Dr uh Gary Chapman came up with these and I find that they're very appropriate and and and it's you can go out there and read about it yourself it's all available to you on the internet but these are things that I think could be very very beneficial to a marriage now you know we're talking about wives you know um referencing their husbands submitting to their husbands now I want to go to something here next brother Harold Becket has uh put out a little book and um and he got all these quotes and everything about you know the woman's needs and the man's needs and quotes about it from from from from every position so I I went back to that book and I just kind of looked at some of these things just hit next for me one time these are a woman's needs and you know this is what a husband needs to understand a woman is looking for a leader spiritual guide a protector she's looking for affection and tenderness amen uh she's also looking for family commitment a real good father be be a great father be involved in in the family amen she looking for a provider security through through the finances she she wants a husband that will work a woman wants that amen uh when a woman has a child she most most women want to stay home with their child most of them want to do that right but they need to make sure that the husband can hold things down financially another thing is that she wants honesty and openness this is what a woman is looking for amen now let's look at what a man's needs are first a man wants a Godly wife with inner and outer beauty he wants a Godly wife with inner and outer beauty second thing a man's looking for she wants he wants a woman that don't mind sharing his interest now now now let me just clarify this she don't have to do the interest but if she shares them she won't complain about him if she shares his interest she won't complain about now now you know there's some brothers in here that love fishing and they be just W their wife to go out there fishing but your wife don't like touching worms your wife don't want to pull off no fish she'll eat it now she'll eat it but she don't want she don't want to do none of that and and you can't get upset with her because she don't like touching worms right amen you don't like going to the all is the truth inh I mean I will go but I'm looking for a seat soon as I get there I'm looking for a chair I'm not going to walk from rack to rack and this this $2 less than this and I don't and and not rack for Rack store to store I'm going to pay $20 more because because I ain't got to go to all these places in my mind I feel like I'm saving money in gas but my wife she don't mind going to this Goodwill and the other Goodwill way on the other side of town right she don't mind going to all these stores and wherever a sale is that's where she like that you know what and I need to share her interest too if that's what she like to do go ahead I ain't going to put no pressure on you amen cuz sometime a husband get out there and he just you know he just mess up her whole day ready to go and she can't shop shop like she shop because she thinking about you and only thing you thinking about is your pocket yeah what you need to do is get some stuff out your pocket and give it to her so she can just have some Freedom some [Applause] Liberty talk about I'm trying to save money save money for what save money to buy the things that you want to buy share his interest am her interest I'm I'm I'm I'm coming home soon soon soon all right thank you brother Joseph I I I need that brother I need that if don't nobody else say it you see it brother she needs domestic support well I'm sorry he needs domestic support giving him preference your husband needs domestic support giving him preference your husband needs admiration and praise oh yes your husband needs [Music] forgiveness now I usually set a timer here as to far how long I'mma preach and I feel like I'm going to go overtime today have your okay amen so we're just going to go on cuz you know next week y'all might not come back so while y'all here um today is the day this is the day the Lord has made Hallelujah we going to rejoice and be glad let me finish it that let's work on these one by one a Godly a man needs a Godly wife with inner and outer beauty now um I I'll give you if you I'll read this but what this story really is about is brother brandom telling a story of these two couples that he married and uh the one couple he married he said he had to do all kind of crazy stuff the the you know to slide kneel down here and do this and do that and and get get these kids married it was two couples and one one was the both daddies were Millionaires and uh you know so they had this I mean extravagant wedding very EXT extravagant wedding and um you know and after he he went there and he you know he he he married the people then he had this other couple that came his brother told him say I work with this young man and he want to get married he got a young lady that he found he wants to get married to her and um and he says you know he just he's just looking um you know he need a preacher to marry him I said my brother will marry you so brother Rand said I I'll sit down and I'll talk to you and I'll I'll uh uh just make sure that that that everything is good um you know with you and one of the things that he asked the young lady because they said it didn't look like they was old enough to get married he ask young lady said now when when when times get rough because in every marriage times are going to get rough anyone that tell you that times are not going to get rough they lying to you they lying every marriage will have disagreements and and and and typically you want to have disagreements in your court courting stages all right because if you're not disagreeing and over over coming those disagreements and courting then you get married and you say well I never thought they was like that you didn't Court properly you didn't Court properly yet people are going to be people y'all two trying to become one there should be some disagreements that's that's very natural and you you got to learn how to work your way through that otherwise you're going to be working your way through it on the other side and I tell people like this you're going to pray one way or the other either you pray before you get married or you're going to pray after you married but you're going to pray that's right so so so you know this one couple I mean he say they didn't have nothing he say he say young lady um um you know what about when what if he lose his job or whatever what you going to do you going you still going to stay married to him and and it's good that the pastor brother brandom in that case had questions to ask difficult questions you want to see how they respond and how they answer them amen right as a pastor when I when I'm when I'm I'm looking at how the answers come coming right and also I'm looking at who doing the answer yeah I asked him why is she answering something is not right here or I ask her and he's answering you know when when you start seeing that you you realize there's a spirit here somewhere because they not even being truthful one other one another somebody's trying to dominate the relationship right so I brother Brandon asked now what what you going to do he you know um you know you going to leave him or you know uh he lose his job you going you going back to mama she he said she said no no no no I've already made up my mind if things get rough I'm going to just stick it out with them character enter and out of beauty yes sir and then um he asked young man said now now when you have a few kids and man you can't really make them bills meet the ends meet what you going to do send her back to a mama you said no I ain't gonna send her back to a mama I'mma I'm I'mma try to find a way to make it work went up there to visit both of these couples after they got married one house the the the millionaires he got to their house and my God they were just fighting and fussing and everything and and when he when he when he walked you know they they walked up on the door he can hear all the arguing and then he just knocked on the door when he knocked on the door uh he heard the family say God bless you brother brandom God bless you brother brandom oh and how y'all doing oh we doing fine aren't we honey we're doing just fine not like the prophet didn't here all that fussing and fighting and pans throwing and everything else in the house we're doing we're doing we're doing great we're doing fine it's it's it's it's a false uh false representation of the marriage it's a mirage yes sir right and and and it's the same thing you know I don't want you to come to church with this Mirage but you're going back home living like I don't know what at some point in time you got to apply this word truth brother right you got to find your place in God's word and allow your house to run the way God functioned for it to run brother Brandon went to the other couple they were living in a box car he said they didn't have a house on a hill they were living in a box car and when he got there this is where this PO comes in he just wanted to see how they was doing and you say He Slipped around look through the door and as he was looking through the door amen he saw the fell take all his money out of his pocket and put it on the table and say this much for this and this much for that hello somebody husband hiding money from his wife wife hiding money from the husband if I don't if I don't hide it she'll spend it all spend it on what spend it on herself they I I've learned this my wife I would give her money and when we had kids coming up my wife would never spend money on herself my wife always spent money on them kids because them kids needed it yes sir amen amen she'd always put the kids first she'd put other other people first and then I have to try to say no now this right here this is this is for you don't you give that to them kids this is for you on the other side I also had to have something to say now give this to the kid for the kids that's right brother random slipped there and he saw he said he say he put the money on the table say he say uh this is for this is for this this is for that this is for this and then at the end of all he said you know what dear I just been saving a little money and I there's a little dress I saw in the when I've been looking at it for weeks looking at it for weeks I want to buy you that dress and because she had inner and outer beauty she told her husband said you know what I got a dress I I don't need that one I'm okay let's just keep you know let's keep working and doing what we're doing I'm okay she got that Inn out of be now when a man hear a wife telling him dear I'm okay you ain't got to go do that for me you know what it does to that man it make him want to go out there and get that dress and then have some money left over he can say look there we still got money left over I bought the dress but we still got money left over we we okay we Okay we okay now that gives her peace but if she see that you done emptied all the bank account for her we're in and out of beauty hello with in and out of beauty she not she not happy with that now if she ain't got no inner beauty she'll tell you to empty your bank account empty your mama's account empty but when she got in and out of beauty she'll stick with you through thick and thin yes sir brother amen a man wants a wife like that a man wants a wife that will give domestic support this next one uh giving him preference and look at what the brother what the prophet says on this in the message here you him says the world's looking for something today when your little wife told you she'd be your sweetheart and wife she was looking for somebody to love her and when you promised your husband he was looking for somebody uh when he come in tired and weary from working all day some little wife to put her arms around him and kind of brush his hair back and tell him how much she loved him now I underline this because we have a a society where it's not only the husband coming home from work but the wife is also coming from home from work and and when that wife gets home from work she wants a husband that's G uh uh I mean I mean hey massage my feet do all these things right that's what she looking for but I remember remember I told you sis in in in in and in God's economy when you driving home you G have to shift your gear sir you G have to give your husband preference because you know what he's the one that's in charge of that house amen amen and with him knowing that you work I'm sure he'll do something for you if he want to do he'll pay for something for you so you can go to get yourself one of them them uh neck massages or whatever amen he'll pay for it he'll give you he he'll give you a um certificate to go get one right yes I know the husband going to do that I know your husband going to go out and buy you a gift certificate that's right when you promis your husband he was looking for somebody when he come in tired and weird from working all day some little wife to put her arms around him and kick and kind of brush his hair back and tell him how much she she loved him that's what calls is separation in families is the neglect of love that's what causes separation in churches neglect of love we got to have love this next one says share his interest now I got to be quick I'm being quick in in all of this I wish I could just take time one of these days I am I'mma come right back and just really take my time share this interest you know what when brother brandom got married he a't had no money to take his wife on the honeymoon and and God told him to get married October 23rd and he knew God knew and brother and brother Randon knew October 23rd was the opening of a hunting season so brother Brandon didn't have no money to go on on a honeymoon so he took his wife on a hunting trip now I got some sisters in here saying right now ain't no way they going to take me on no hunting trip kind of man is this ain't no way he going to do it but you know sister brandom she went right on with him went on the hunting trip you see he said certain log she couldn't get over so he have to help pick her up and get her over the log get in and get her out of there right and she just going and now now I know they went for the honeymoon on the hunting trip maybe he sold it up at some nice cabin in in in in in the woods I don't know what he sold it up but but she went she went I don't know if she went back but she went but the other thing is that she didn't do she never complained exped about him going even when it impacted their anniversary she never complained about him going and and I'm I'm I'mma tell you when I get to heaven I might want to shake sister Brandon's hand the reason I want to shake her hand is because by her not complaining about him going there was one time he went to Colorado yeah and when he went this time there was a great miracle that happened up there in Colorado where a storm was coming in and the Holy Spirit told him now go back into the area where you just come from right in the heart of the storm and he say now I'm the same God that that that did this and I'm the same God that did this and I want to use you to speak to this storm open up your mouth and tell his son tell the sun to shine and the storm to stop brother brand spoke that St St sun come out for four days and say immediately after he spoke it son came out and this was during their anniversary and because he did because God did something like that in his life during the anniversary time we get the benefit oh my my my my my we get the benefit of that I mean I I I I I feel like you know one of my one of my one of things that I really like to do I like to play golf I like to play golf and my wife never complains about me going out to play golf I spent hours three four hours sometimes for round of golf she never complain about me going out there I need that for some rest and relaxation because I don't you know what in in in my life it just ain't my problems CU I got them I got problems yes sir me and my wife have to work through things all the time but we committed to it yes sir but I don't just take on my problems I have to take on everybody else problems too yes sir so I need something to relax myself and and golfing is the thing that I do to relax myself I refuse to go crazy [Applause] I refuse I'mma take care of I got to take care of me cuz I'm going tell you people don't think about that don't don't think about that that part of of pastorship they don't think about that part but the pastor got to take care of himself that's right he he carried the load sometime I got to carry the load financially it's not my problem this is my house over here amen but because it's in the church I got to step up amen if if I was in debt up to here I wouldn't be able to do some of the things I do for the church for the people of the church right amen I got to there's a lot a lot goes here y'all a lot amen so golfing is my thing and if you see me pull out my golf bag you pray for the pastor bless him Lord help him relax himself while he out there father give him a ho in one [Applause] Jesus your husband needs admiration and praise oh my Ephesians 5:33 nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband remember anything that helps the human race is Godly and uh I want to bring out just a couple things Proverbs 31:23 says her husband is known in the gates when she sth among the elders when he sth among the Elders of the land the character of his wife pushes her to a place where even a husband is getting praised for the wife that he chose right uh another thing that I found this on the on the on the uh internet this was coming from a website radiant marriage and it's a lady by the name of Jess uh Ro robart uh now she she she she wrote these things and this is where I'm going to go into overtime so let's let's go next on this the first thing is first two things is uh admir for admiration and praise sister watch what you say about your husband Colossians 4:6 says let your speech be always with Grace seasoned with salt that she may know how you ought to answer every man all right and this lady said wives need to watch the words they say to and about their husbands think before you speak our words need to edify him and build him up the next next one says let him know when he has done something well you say our husbands need to need to hear when they have done something well he needs to know that we notice him and the steps that he has taken make don't make the man feel like he ain't contributed nothing to the family next thing uh she says is you need to learn how to say thank you she said these two little words mean so much that says I see you and I appreciate you am amen also here's a good when recognize that your husband is not perfect amen I don't know where where sisters think that when they get married to some man that boy he is my God the the the the the them them them books this night and shining armor stuff that don't exist y'all it don't exist I mean he come in and you think he's sweeping you off your feet and he's doing this and this man going to be Oh my he he he is my savior no he ain't Jesus is amen amen and God going to let certain things happen in your life to show you that this man is not your savior God is trying to get your attention on him your husband will fail you so many so many times you going have to learn how to you know he ain't perfect and here's here's what what the scripture I put with that is 1 Corinthians 13 charity suffer long right and is kind charity enth not all right charity vth not itself is not puffed up do not behave itself unseemly seeketh not our own is not easily provoke and this is the one I one I really love in in in in in that in in in verse 5 and in 1 Corinthians 13 thinketh no evil and what think of no evil means that you cannot keep bringing up the past right if you trying to go forward in the future you can't keep telling your husband you did this 25 years ago you got get past that right recognize that he ain't perfect amen let's go on to some other one watch your verbal your non-verbal language it said did you know that non-verbal language makes up about 93% of our communication our tone of voice and body language are huge indicators of our respect level do you roll your eyes do you cross your arms while he trying to to talk to you do you look away when he's trying to talk with you yeah right right if if and you say if you say yeah I do that then watch your nonverbal language you're going to have to fix some of that would you do that to [Music] Jesus act like Jesus is in your husband cuz he is amen am watch your non-verbal language this admiration and praise another one is seek to understand and what this is is don't assume the worst all the time assume the best and seek to understand your husband's heart rather than seeking to be understood we need to truly hear where our spouse is coming from is often a much better spot than we think be trustworthy what this me and and and and this lady said with while this needs to be in all areas I specifically want to talk about finances there have been many wives that have talked that have talked that I have talked to Who hide purchases and packages from their husbands they want to get home before he get home because there's a package coming I don't need him see that it's not his gift it's something you bought and and it's not something that you bought it's something you keep buying these packages show up every day every day and you hiding them credit card just running up like crazy and then you get yourself so maxed out now you looking for him to try to give you a little money to try to get off that get get get get that credit card back under control who who who who did it you did it you going to have to learn how to control yourself over them little packages Amazon become a curse you know most people you know the Amazon is actually a place it's a it's a place a Amazon forest and most people will not walk through that Forest but they'll take their Mouse and they'll go right through the force of Amazon on on the internet be trustworthy pray for your husband defitely pray for his heart yes for his mind pray that God will protect him and cultivate a man who loves the Lord and is obedient right and here's the thing that I want you to understand this what this lady wrote anything anything that to help the human race is Godly this lady said God is the only one who can transform our hearts and we need to trust that God is in control praying for our husband recognizes that we are not in the driver's seat God is amen amen the last one she says is have a Gentle Spirit true she says cloak yourself with gentleness Grace and humility this is what will speak to your husband's heart and and I like this cuz first Peter uh chap 3: 1-6 says likewise your wives be in subjection to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they also May without the word be won by the conversation of the wives while the while they behold your Chase conversation coupled with fear whose adorning let it not be that outward adornment of platting the hair and of wearing of gold or of putting on of apparel but let it be the hidden man of the heart and that which is not corruptible even the ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit a meek and quiet Spirit which is is in the sight of God of great price amen that means it's it's kind of hard for people for sisters to get themselves to that spot where they have a Meek and quiet spirit amen for after this manner in Old Time the holy women also who trusted in God adorned themselves being in subjection unto their own husband even as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters ye are as long as you do well and not afraid with any amazement I like that Sarah call Abraham Lord and I love the way brother Keith Brown says you know either you're going to call your husband my Lord man you just blessed me I just thank God for you so GL so glad God gave you to me or you going to say my [Applause] Lord which one you think going to be encouraging in your house this last one that I want to give you your husband need forgiveness here brother brandom says in this message why other people so talks about he's giving a woman advice their house is about to fall apart they're breaking up they're they're they're leaving and he gives his wife some advice now when he gives his wife advice he's actually giving her advice of some of the love languages that she could use one of them is physical touch uh and the other one is words of affirmation which is praise right it says the most powerful weapon there is in the world is love I stood by a little lady the other night where her husband was fixing to leave her and marry another woman a very fine known couple I looked at her she said well I'm going to leave brother brandom I said don't do it sister told me said oh my husband his ministry will be ruined what can I do I'm going to New York and I'm going to get me a job I said don't do it don't do it sister what can I do brother brandom I said go up to him said well I found the lady's picture and I broke it up and I done so and so and I did that I see that but I said go up to him put your arms around him and say sweetheart no matter what you done I still love you that'll do it it was right when this woman was really willing to forgive her husband go up and show him physical touch and and and now I I can almost say probably in this household there was not a lot of physical touch oh oh my but but she probably didn't realize this was her husband's love language that he needed her to come and put her arms around him and and just and just reaffirm him that I'm with you no matter what you've done I still love you and and notice now notice this because in the scripture you know uh I I I've seen sisters get divorced they divorce their husbands over a scripture that they misinterpret a scripture says that if if if a wife does something like this then a husband has a right right Matthew speaks about it if a wife does something then a husband has a right and they say the wife wife does it husband has a right well if the husband do it I have a right but that ain't what the Bible say ain't what the Bible say and and and in all honesty I don't know one scripture that supports a wife just leaving her husband now if they separate that's one thing but the Bible say you try to reconcile even in separation that's what the Bible say you can't stop you can't stop that but here the thing of it is is that you it's not it's not supportive of a wife just getting up and well he this and he that wait a minute now let's get back to Bible order right let's get back to Bible order amen amen amen right but here you know this this love language of going and just putting her arms around her husband and then with with words of affirmation say no matter what You' done I still love you that's what actually restored their home and that's what kept that other lady out their house husband needs forgiveness the wife also needs forgiveness we all need that amen next next I think uh here let me these are my last two quotes go next again so let's go back to the beginning in the original physical creation as we know it today God made everything in pairs male and female there were two chickens rooster and hen there were two cattle the cow and the bull and right down the line but when it came to man there was only one there were not a pair Adam had been made in the image of God he was a Son of God as a Son of God he could not be tempted and fall that would be impossible so God took a byproduct of a man to cause the fall now and I like the way another brother say uh if if if if if God um the woman is the byproduct of the man she was the rib out of the man she was the byproduct of a man amen she was a byproduct of a man Brothers you need to understand why your wives like to byproducts can I can I can I say it this way that used to be in you brother God took it out of you and gave it to your wife all right let's finish um there were two cattle to C the bull and right down the line but when it came to man there was only one there were not a pair Adam been made an image of God he was the son of God as a Son of God he could not be tempted and fall they would be that would be impossible so God took a by product of a man that caus a fall one woman never Ste fresh from the hand of God as a true product of God she was produced from man when God cused her to be brought forth from man she was vastly different from the from the other females he had created she was able to be seduced no other female in creation can be immoral but the human female may be touched at almost any time and that weakness in her allowed Satan to to to seduce her by the weight of the serpent and he and has brought the woman come into a very peculiar position before God and His word the next statement says she's the type of all things vulgar foul and loome on the one hand and on the other hand she is the type of all things clean and beautiful and holy as the receptacle of the spirit and the blessing of God blessings of God on the one hand she is called the who is drunk with the wine of her fornications on the other hand she is called the bride of Christ on one hand she is called mystery Babylon the Abomination before God and on the other hand she is called New Jerusalem our mother on the one hand she is so foul and wicked and LW that she is summarily cast into the Lake of Fire as the only fit place for her and on the other hand she's exalted to Heaven sharing the very Throne of God as the only face only place befitting such a queen our objective our goal just hit next on that our objective our goal our reason for even bringing this is that we want to find ourselves in this structure that God has established for the family Christ is our head the husband amen is underneath Christ the wife underneath the husband and the children underneath that this is the way God establish it I know Society does something totally different but we're Christians and we want to do it the way God established it God richly blessed your church amen let us pray father we thank you for your word today thank you for the opportunity we have Lord to just revisit and look at these things that you have

you've put in place help us God to receive the word we don't want to be out of a position we want to receive all the blessings that you have for us oh God and we realize that uh if we're not doing things according to your perfect will then there's no way that we'd be able to uh get those blessings you started us off off this year with a theme that theme was to to to submit to the perfect will of God and Father even all down here to September Lord you are bringing us to this point father amen where uh we're still finding a a place where we could submit first the scripture tells us to submit ourselves one to another secondly it tells the wise to submit themselves to the husbands and then thirdly Lord the husbands have to love their wives the way Christ love the church because this is a great mystery that Paul is speaking of Lord is the mystery of Christ in the church and our marriages that reflect the relationship that you have with your church God we pray that the words Lord would not just go in one ear and out the other but Lord may it register in our in the depths of our soul that we'll find ourselves living amen according to word there there might be saints that uh have been
