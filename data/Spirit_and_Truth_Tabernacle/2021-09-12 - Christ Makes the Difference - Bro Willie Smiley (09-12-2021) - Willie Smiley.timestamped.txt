[48:11] god is is in control
[48:14] doing doing great things
[48:16] amen
[48:18] um we want to start from the eighth
[48:21] verse and we'll read to the tenth verse
[48:24] it says for by grace are you saved
[48:27] through faith
[48:28] and that not of yourselves it is the
[48:31] gift of god
[48:32] not of works lest any man should boast
[48:36] for we are his workmanship
[48:38] created in christ jesus and to good
[48:41] works
[48:42] which god has before ordained that we
[48:45] should walk in them amen
[48:48] gracious father we just thank you this
[48:50] morning
[48:51] and uh we trusting in you we know the
[48:54] gift is the ability to get yourself out
[48:56] of the way and
[48:58] uh we just here to just yield the
[49:00] instrument to you trust in that lord god
[49:03] we could say something that'll be
[49:05] edifying
[49:06] and help us to look at the scriptures
[49:09] and
[49:10] just look at life in general from a
[49:12] different
[49:13] standpoint
[49:15] and uh we'd be so careful to give you
[49:17] praise glory and honor in jesus name
[49:20] amen amen may be seated
[49:22] uh we like to this morning by the grace
[49:25] of god i want to use as a little topic
[49:28] uh uh christ makes the difference
[49:32] and y'all just gonna have to bear with
[49:34] me for a few minutes
[49:36] uh we wanna maybe try to build uh
[49:39] brother jack made a little statement uh
[49:41] wednesday night and it just kind of
[49:44] brought me back to a
[49:46] a scripture there i know he's been
[49:48] working in the book of ephesians and uh
[49:52] on some series and i kind of try to stay
[49:55] behind him and not try to get ahead of
[49:57] him
[49:58] or any series or anything he always tell
[50:01] me bro go ahead go ahead just do your
[50:03] thing
[50:04] you know but
[50:06] uh
[50:07] uh it's just something he said it struck
[50:09] this scripture in ephesians chapter
[50:12] 2 and and also
[50:14] just a a story that the prophet of god
[50:17] he he begins to tell he tells a story
[50:20] uh and and maybe we'll read
[50:23] we don't i just let the lord use me uh i
[50:27] want to find it in because it's a few
[50:29] things that we want to say this morning
[50:31] to just uh uh help us all one of one of
[50:35] the things i've learned in life um just
[50:38] you know in the natural and even been
[50:40] since we've been a christian
[50:42] and uh you you know you have to
[50:44] appreciate growth
[50:46] and maturity
[50:48] because when when people are really
[50:50] shallow
[50:51] and and definitely before the new birth
[50:54] uh people are really carnal and just the
[50:57] way that they they approach things and
[50:59] the way that they
[51:00] just look at things
[51:02] we a lot of times we look at things from
[51:05] a carnal standpoint
[51:07] right the way that it looks the weight
[51:09] of this shape
[51:10] you know we try to identify oh she's
[51:13] she's
[51:14] uh if i could use it she's heavy all
[51:17] right or he's heavier he's he's this
[51:21] and and a lot of times we look at the
[51:23] outward appearance and and we we don't
[51:26] we don't really see the the real person
[51:30] we we look at the outside but we don't
[51:33] know the person
[51:35] right and the person is us all together
[51:39] different from the outside per
[51:41] individual the shell
[51:43] you know you you've never really seen me
[51:47] you just see my house
[51:49] my shell the building that i live in
[51:52] that you know we we dress up on on
[51:55] sunday and wednesday y'all just see that
[51:58] a lot of times but it's it's that is the
[52:01] thing that people
[52:03] uh try to make you you
[52:05] [Music]
[52:06] right
[52:07] right the outside the thing that we
[52:10] dress up and i like to dress up and i'm
[52:13] quite sure y'all like to dress up but
[52:15] that's not you
[52:18] because you you can dress this up
[52:20] and be a whole nother person outside
[52:24] of what you are on the outside i'm
[52:26] feeling something now
[52:28] so just the way that the way that we
[52:31] we approach things in the way that we
[52:33] look at things in the way that we
[52:36] process
[52:38] right is it's kind of i'll say it like
[52:40] this i'm not educated we got educated
[52:43] people in here i ain't one of those i'm
[52:45] not ignorant illiterate
[52:48] but you know y'all ain't gonna get no
[52:50] big words out of me
[52:51] [Laughter]
[52:54] you know i just kind of try to bring it
[52:55] right down where everybody's at you know
[52:58] one thing about the giraffe he has the
[53:00] ability to eat from up here
[53:03] and
[53:04] the ability to eat from down here
[53:08] so if you're a giraffe you're just gonna
[53:09] have to come on down here
[53:11] but i was gonna say jacked up
[53:15] a lot of times our views in the way that
[53:17] we look at things is really really
[53:19] jacked up right because we we we're not
[53:22] talk in uh in our early stages of life
[53:27] before before the new birth to really
[53:30] process things in the way that amen god
[53:34] would process things
[53:36] come on y'all
[53:38] you know we we get we get kids that's
[53:41] bullied on social media and and all the
[53:44] things that we hear this and it's all
[53:46] these things is because
[53:48] the people that's bullying
[53:51] uh uh look at things from a certain way
[53:54] and don't understand how to process
[53:58] how how to look at a person from the
[54:02] the eyes of god
[54:05] right through a thinking man's filter
[54:09] we preaching this morning
[54:11] right we we don't do it even even when
[54:14] we're converted and i'm going somewhere
[54:16] this morning even when we convert it a
[54:19] lot of times um
[54:21] we don't we don't we don't do it because
[54:24] we lack maturity and that's why
[54:26] sometimes you know these these messages
[54:29] has to be preached so that they could
[54:32] change the way that we we look at things
[54:35] the way that we we process things the
[54:38] way that we process and look at
[54:40] situations
[54:41] is that right
[54:43] i mean we we're all growing i'm not here
[54:45] to kind of you know belittle anybody or
[54:46] anything but but we're all growing we're
[54:49] all maturing in christ
[54:52] and i've been preaching for a
[54:54] good little minute and i'm still i'm
[54:56] still
[54:57] growing i'm still maturing
[55:00] right i'm still
[55:01] having to check myself
[55:04] in the way that i process and the way
[55:06] that i look at things and the way that i
[55:09] look at an individual the way that i
[55:11] look at somebody that falls in christ
[55:16] right
[55:17] because somebody make a mistake or
[55:19] somebody fall
[55:21] we we ready to crucify
[55:25] you know we we were able to kick a man
[55:27] when he died
[55:29] right
[55:31] you know we we sometimes we don't i
[55:34] don't think by the revelation we've
[55:35] learned how to pick folk up
[55:39] but the bible says we should
[55:43] but i think i think you know we we
[55:46] become clannish and and all you know we
[55:48] go through all of this stuff
[55:51] and and and we we
[55:55] we do more damage than we do good a lot
[55:57] of times
[55:59] right
[56:00] but but
[56:01] after this morning i i think it'll
[56:04] change some things for us
[56:06] and that's that's what we're here for
[56:08] right that's what brother jack is all
[56:10] about that's what these ministers is
[56:12] about we're trying to transform amen the
[56:16] way that we process and the way that we
[56:18] look at things and the way that we look
[56:20] at one the way we look at our children
[56:22] no matter what state i had to come to
[56:25] that as my children amen got older i'm
[56:29] going through all kinds of things
[56:32] you like with my children but i've grown
[56:35] to a place now
[56:37] that that i'm settled that no matter
[56:39] what they come at with me it don't it
[56:42] don't shake me all right amen you know
[56:45] it don't shake me they might think that
[56:46] old dad gonna hold
[56:48] you know this and that the other thing
[56:50] i'm like
[56:51] not me
[56:53] no not me i'm not gonna allow that to
[56:56] move for me
[56:57] i just realized that you know as as
[57:00] individuals we have to make our own
[57:02] choices now you say where would the
[57:04] world brother smiley go y'all keep on
[57:06] following me
[57:08] [Applause]
[57:09] now i ain't no helicopter i'm kind of a
[57:12] 747 all right so it take me a minute to
[57:15] get up and then it take me a minute to
[57:17] come down
[57:18] so i hope y'all ain't in a hurry what
[57:20] time we got to be out of here
[57:23] amen
[57:24] but you know you as as a parent you know
[57:27] because i had all these ideas when my
[57:29] kids were little
[57:31] when i could control them when i could
[57:33] give them that i in church and i could
[57:36] give them that eye and put my head you
[57:39] know i could control them but when i got
[57:41] to the place when they started getting
[57:43] older
[57:44] we realized that we can't control them
[57:47] we can't manipulate them with all of
[57:49] that they're at a place where amen they
[57:52] have to make their own choices
[57:56] and and here's the thing young people
[57:59] you live and die by the choices that you
[58:01] make
[58:05] especially especially when you grow up
[58:06] in a church like this and you sat under
[58:09] brother jack some of y'all have sat
[58:11] under me y'all without excuses
[58:14] that's right because one thing about it
[58:16] i believe we've tried to give you the
[58:18] word
[58:20] and we and we're still growing and we're
[58:21] still maturing we're still
[58:23] by by understanding learning how to
[58:26] process because now we got we got the
[58:29] mind of christ and there's there's a
[58:31] certain way that that we have got to
[58:34] look at things i was thinking about this
[58:37] this uh thought even yesterday and
[58:39] riding the last couple of days you know
[58:41] sometimes i just allow the holy spirit
[58:44] to bring inspiration
[58:46] and i and i started thinking about the
[58:50] book of genesis you know and just
[58:52] thinking about about uh uh god and just
[58:55] the way that god looks at things god
[58:58] looked at the thing that was created and
[59:00] when it was when it was without form and
[59:03] it was void and darkness covered the
[59:06] face of the deep
[59:08] god was not moved by that
[59:11] amen
[59:13] god what god wasn't moved by that the
[59:16] condition of the earth the darkness and
[59:18] the void and
[59:20] and all right
[59:22] god god looked beyond all of that
[59:28] right we talked about we talking about a
[59:30] supreme being all knowing
[59:33] right
[59:34] with attributes how to how to plan
[59:38] right fatherhood was in his mind and all
[59:41] of these different things right
[59:43] god had the ability to raise up
[59:47] and look at that thing and understand
[59:50] that amen
[59:51] amen this will be a part of my plan
[59:55] and god's beginning to speak yes and
[59:59] what what
[1:00:00] initially was dark and void became a uh
[1:00:05] a idiot
[1:00:07] right became an eden
[1:00:09] became a place where his his family
[1:00:13] could could dwell in harmony and unity
[1:00:16] and oneness and safety
[1:00:19] and prosperity
[1:00:22] come on
[1:00:23] no lack no division
[1:00:27] innocence
[1:00:29] perfection
[1:00:33] right
[1:00:34] you know god looked at the earth and
[1:00:36] said man i
[1:00:37] yeah that's that's temporary
[1:00:40] but when it's all said and done it'll
[1:00:42] bring forth this this great eden right
[1:00:46] and so i started even thinking and and
[1:00:49] just following that inspiration down
[1:00:51] through the scripture
[1:00:53] right with through through the prophets
[1:00:56] right through through through you know
[1:00:59] coming over into
[1:01:00] uh the new testament with with the
[1:01:03] apostle paul
[1:01:04] up under this um
[1:01:07] eagle anointing this teaching anointing
[1:01:10] right
[1:01:11] let me tell you something
[1:01:13] you you gotta look at things from the
[1:01:15] right place from the up under the right
[1:01:17] anointing
[1:01:20] is right you got to it's it's it's a
[1:01:23] must
[1:01:25] it's a must to be able to look at the
[1:01:28] thing paul teaching
[1:01:30] the the different churches the new
[1:01:32] testament church
[1:01:34] uh unveiling the mighty god
[1:01:37] uh under this eagle anointing
[1:01:41] was had the ability to look at things
[1:01:44] amen from a different space
[1:01:48] right
[1:01:49] even even when the the
[1:01:52] the jews was looking at the gentiles all
[1:01:56] funny
[1:01:58] right
[1:01:59] paul was able to look at the situation
[1:02:03] from a different space because of the
[1:02:05] anointing
[1:02:07] that he was under and and and bring this
[1:02:10] this thought of god down and express it
[1:02:13] to the people yes glory yes sir that
[1:02:16] right
[1:02:17] oh hallelujah
[1:02:19] and and i'm i'm a venture out a little
[1:02:21] bit y'all don't quit on me
[1:02:25] even even
[1:02:27] william branham
[1:02:29] right
[1:02:30] under this eagle anointing
[1:02:34] right
[1:02:35] was able to go up and catch the thoughts
[1:02:38] of god
[1:02:40] bring down the mind of god leaving
[1:02:43] brother jack i think i don't know if it
[1:02:44] was wednesday or sunday he he was
[1:02:46] talking about brother branham and
[1:02:48] brother branham crossing over and
[1:02:50] talking about talking you know to that
[1:02:52] voice and everything and and talking
[1:02:54] about paul and paul's group and
[1:02:57] you know across the uh um
[1:02:59] and and if paul grouper make it my group
[1:03:02] will make it because i preach what paul
[1:03:04] preached
[1:03:05] paul paul
[1:03:07] being being the writer of the majority
[1:03:11] of the new testament
[1:03:13] right right
[1:03:14] he could catch the plan of god
[1:03:17] the mind of god the program of god
[1:03:21] sees that god's thoughts don't change
[1:03:24] all right he unders he understands in
[1:03:27] his writings
[1:03:29] that that that you know
[1:03:32] god was rebuilding
[1:03:35] right right another masterpiece
[1:03:39] he wrote it he wrote it in scripture
[1:03:43] but then in the evening time
[1:03:46] right at the end of the day
[1:03:48] right god sends his mouthpiece
[1:03:52] to catch yes
[1:03:54] to catch the inspiration
[1:03:58] to catch the inspiration of the bible of
[1:04:01] what paul wrote
[1:04:03] in scripture
[1:04:06] right
[1:04:08] let me tell you something that's why you
[1:04:09] got to get in the spirit to hear and
[1:04:11] know
[1:04:12] you you got you got to get up under this
[1:04:15] eagle anointing
[1:04:17] because if you don't
[1:04:18] you're really you're going to really
[1:04:20] miss the bible we talk i'm not just
[1:04:22] talking about a man
[1:04:26] people like to try to get us focusing on
[1:04:28] a man and his failures
[1:04:30] man it ain't the man it's the it's the
[1:04:33] inspiration
[1:04:35] that the man
[1:04:36] taught up under that eagle anointing
[1:04:40] that was on the man the person
[1:04:43] to catch the revelation of the word and
[1:04:47] bring that thought down to the people
[1:04:52] right
[1:04:54] a more better plan to make the thing
[1:04:57] clearer
[1:05:00] to unveil this god before us
[1:05:04] is that right
[1:05:06] see
[1:05:07] this this is where people fail
[1:05:09] see brother branham brother branham was
[1:05:12] anointed as an eagle right
[1:05:15] up under this eagle anointing
[1:05:18] to catch things
[1:05:20] that everybody else wasn't gonna catch
[1:05:24] that's why he could preach the master
[1:05:27] piece identified masterpiece and all of
[1:05:30] these messages
[1:05:32] he elevated and
[1:05:34] understood by the word
[1:05:37] amen what god was doing
[1:05:41] praise god
[1:05:43] he could look because of this
[1:05:44] inspiration
[1:05:46] he could show you what paul was doing in
[1:05:48] this age
[1:05:49] this one was doing in that age
[1:05:52] but break down the history
[1:05:56] is that right of church history
[1:05:59] right he could do that
[1:06:02] not as a man
[1:06:04] but but because of his call and because
[1:06:07] of that anointing that prophetically and
[1:06:11] we must be under the right anointing
[1:06:16] we have got to be up under this eagle
[1:06:18] anointing
[1:06:20] in order to understand what's going on
[1:06:22] in this age
[1:06:27] right
[1:06:28] amen
[1:06:29] if you don't you miss it all right
[1:06:33] if you don't you miss it
[1:06:35] it's it becomes fanaticism it becomes it
[1:06:38] becomes this it becomes that it becomes
[1:06:41] you know while they preaching against
[1:06:42] denomination i
[1:06:44] ain't preaching against no denomination
[1:06:46] i just understand where they stand at
[1:06:49] according to scripture
[1:06:52] is that right whether people go on the
[1:06:54] hell that's between
[1:06:56] them and god
[1:06:57] see i'm i'm i'm i'ma strike something
[1:07:00] right quick
[1:07:02] uh
[1:07:03] names was written in the land book of
[1:07:05] life before the foundations of the world
[1:07:13] and that's what you got to see
[1:07:16] see
[1:07:16] if if god reveals to you your name
[1:07:21] on the book
[1:07:24] there you go i could go somewhere
[1:07:26] oh hallelujah
[1:07:28] all right
[1:07:29] you got to be able to see your name
[1:07:32] right
[1:07:33] not john jones army neville
[1:07:36] you got to be by revelation see your
[1:07:39] name on the book
[1:07:41] see come on
[1:07:43] [Music]
[1:07:45] see this is why that's people can't take
[1:07:48] anything from me
[1:07:50] is that right because i see i understand
[1:07:53] who i am i see myself i'm full of faults
[1:07:56] i'm full of faith not anytime i'm still
[1:07:57] growing too
[1:07:58] but one thing about it i can see myself
[1:08:02] in the scripture
[1:08:06] the word broke and i can see myself in
[1:08:09] the world
[1:08:11] we still going somewhere
[1:08:13] come on this ain't in my notes i'm just
[1:08:15] letting them use me right now
[1:08:18] right
[1:08:18] and and that's that's the thing church
[1:08:21] you know the the prophet the prophet and
[1:08:24] and this is why people could could call
[1:08:26] him fanatic and say well he's a man of
[1:08:28] god when the anointing is on him and
[1:08:30] he's discerning and he's healing but man
[1:08:33] his teaching
[1:08:35] lord have mercy
[1:08:38] they weren't in the same spirit they
[1:08:41] weren't under the same anointing so they
[1:08:43] couldn't see what he was seeing that's
[1:08:45] exactly right
[1:08:46] exactly
[1:08:48] i'm just gonna be real with you you
[1:08:50] gotta be there under that same anointing
[1:08:54] right under that same inspiration or you
[1:08:57] won't see evil
[1:09:00] i'm telling you
[1:09:01] the bible is alive this morning
[1:09:06] the bible is living this morning
[1:09:10] right
[1:09:11] church let me tell y'all something
[1:09:13] in a lot of instances we still on the
[1:09:15] surface of things
[1:09:17] there's so much in scripture
[1:09:20] right
[1:09:21] amen this right now being inspired
[1:09:26] 20 some years of preaching i'm still
[1:09:28] being inspired
[1:09:30] i'm still watching the word unfolding
[1:09:37] [Applause]
[1:09:43] we now can teach from a different
[1:09:44] perspective because the word is
[1:09:46] constantly open
[1:09:48] and the way that you know we might have
[1:09:50] looked at things and was a little bit
[1:09:52] more legalistic and you know didn't
[1:09:55] really you have no grace nowhere
[1:09:59] everything was bloody preachers came to
[1:10:02] the pulpit with a bloody sword
[1:10:07] right
[1:10:08] amen
[1:10:10] just killing the people
[1:10:14] sometimes we wonder why we ain't got no
[1:10:16] young people we didn't kill them all
[1:10:22] we even made we made it so so
[1:10:26] legalistic now i don't believe in
[1:10:27] compromise i believe in giving the word
[1:10:29] of god but i believe in operating under
[1:10:32] grace
[1:10:34] it is grace
[1:10:36] grace to serve the lord yes see
[1:10:41] we we we approach things and our views
[1:10:44] too as lay people
[1:10:46] they're so-called deep
[1:10:48] we approach things amen with a bloody
[1:10:51] sword we ready to kill people
[1:10:53] [Music]
[1:10:56] our views
[1:10:59] and the way that we look at things
[1:11:03] a lot of times right
[1:11:06] but you know paul had to look at things
[1:11:09] from a different perspective let's let's
[1:11:11] stop for a second
[1:11:13] let's look at paul in the way that he
[1:11:15] looked at things before the new birth
[1:11:20] he thought he knew something
[1:11:24] he thought he knew something didn't even
[1:11:26] know god
[1:11:28] didn't even know the word he had the
[1:11:29] letter
[1:11:31] he could read he was a smart man
[1:11:34] but he couldn't see the unfolding he
[1:11:37] couldn't see the progression of the word
[1:11:40] right because if he could have seen the
[1:11:43] plan of god unfolding he never would
[1:11:46] have persecuted the church
[1:11:48] right come on
[1:11:50] amen god had to knock the pride off of
[1:11:54] him
[1:11:55] right
[1:11:56] get him to a place where amen he looked
[1:11:59] up
[1:11:59] and and you know he realized boy i'm in
[1:12:02] a bad shape
[1:12:05] right
[1:12:06] because he was persecuting the very god
[1:12:10] that he was supposed to be worshipping
[1:12:12] by killing the church we do the same
[1:12:15] thing
[1:12:18] [Music]
[1:12:20] come on but then when he got the baptism
[1:12:23] out of the holy ghost
[1:12:25] right and really start operating a man
[1:12:28] uh in his position
[1:12:30] then that anoint and change things
[1:12:34] see watch this christ made the
[1:12:37] difference
[1:12:38] [Applause]
[1:12:40] and the way that in the way that he
[1:12:42] looked at things
[1:12:44] right and the way that he operate then
[1:12:46] he got to the place he'd say
[1:12:48] man all that all that i've learned i
[1:12:51] counted is done
[1:12:53] it's nothing boy it's like i can imagine
[1:12:56] paul saying boy i thought i was deep i
[1:12:58] thought i was a preacher
[1:13:00] man i got i got letters and everything
[1:13:03] else man i count all that nothing
[1:13:06] i don't what a state to be in the
[1:13:08] realize you don't know nothing
[1:13:13] most of us
[1:13:14] should be there
[1:13:16] cause most of us really don't know
[1:13:18] nothing
[1:13:20] come on
[1:13:21] i know y'all like to sit around message
[1:13:23] churches because the word has been
[1:13:25] opened and feeling we still don't know
[1:13:27] nothing because we still make messes
[1:13:32] [Applause]
[1:13:34] i'm starting to feel my help now
[1:13:38] right it's the truth
[1:13:40] paul didn't know until christ came into
[1:13:43] his life and made the difference
[1:13:47] right it's the truth
[1:13:49] christ
[1:13:50] made the difference in paul's life
[1:13:53] and in the way that he looked at things
[1:13:55] in the way that he perceived things
[1:13:57] right
[1:13:58] amen it
[1:14:00] just it it challenged him it brought him
[1:14:03] to a place where you know
[1:14:05] he was just willing to to just forsake
[1:14:07] all and die
[1:14:08] right
[1:14:10] see
[1:14:11] so
[1:14:12] that helps us when i look at even
[1:14:14] brother brandon's ministry
[1:14:16] right
[1:14:18] under this anointing
[1:14:20] he sees things
[1:14:22] from a different from a different
[1:14:24] standpoint he looks at things and this
[1:14:26] is why when people would criticize them
[1:14:28] all he wasn't moved by that
[1:14:31] because he realizes like i'm operating
[1:14:33] up on a different anointing
[1:14:36] right i'm up i'm operating on the
[1:14:38] prophetic anointing
[1:14:40] i see myself in the scriptures that was
[1:14:43] the thing with
[1:14:44] with mary while mary could go through
[1:14:46] what she went through in the age that
[1:14:49] she lived in right because she could see
[1:14:52] by the word
[1:14:54] john the baptist right they could
[1:14:56] identify themselves in scripture can we
[1:14:59] [Applause]
[1:15:00] right
[1:15:02] they're not being critical
[1:15:04] but this is the place that we got to be
[1:15:07] so that we're not moved when we when
[1:15:09] we're faced with with challenges i'm
[1:15:11] still going somewhere
[1:15:13] i ain't got that yet but i'm still going
[1:15:15] somewhere
[1:15:17] right that's the thing that that helps
[1:15:19] us so i'll stop here and then we'll try
[1:15:21] to get on track a little bit more you
[1:15:24] got to be able to
[1:15:26] uh operate under an eagle anointing amen
[1:15:33] right
[1:15:34] you you got to look through the eyes of
[1:15:36] faith
[1:15:38] through the eyes of a prophet
[1:15:42] right
[1:15:43] because of the word of the lord comes to
[1:15:45] a prophet
[1:15:46] that was the thing that he knelt down a
[1:15:48] man all the time in in his ministry the
[1:15:51] word comes to amend the prophet
[1:15:56] he said i ain't doing nothing except i
[1:15:58] reveal it to my servants
[1:16:01] that's just the order of god who can
[1:16:03] tell god what to do with his word none
[1:16:06] of us we didn't even know the plan of
[1:16:08] god
[1:16:09] not even adam
[1:16:12] listen listen how to get back to god
[1:16:15] right after he fell across the chasm boy
[1:16:18] he went to work trying to trying to put
[1:16:20] up uh uh uh and taking those fig leaves
[1:16:23] those leaves and sewing them together
[1:16:25] and putting them on and realized
[1:16:27] i'm in a mess
[1:16:32] [Applause]
[1:16:34] you you have to do something and realize
[1:16:36] this ain't gonna work
[1:16:38] [Applause]
[1:16:39] [Music]

[1:18:24] right
[1:18:25] the the prophet of god he he begins to
[1:18:28] tell the story
[1:18:29] right of of of

[1:18:46] it was it was up for auction in the
[1:18:48] auctioneer
[1:19:06] hey
[1:19:21] listen to something here
[1:19:24] the auctioneer
[1:19:26] lacked
[1:19:27] the ability to express
[1:19:31] what was in
[1:19:32] the violin
[1:19:40] sarah
[1:19:42] there she go
[1:19:43] see now i'm the auctioneer

[1:19:58] right
[1:19:59] i'm watching the whole thing take
[1:20:02] this thing
[1:20:04] is worth probably
[1:20:06] countless thousands of dollars
[1:20:09] but i do not possess the ability
[1:20:15] to bring forth the expression
[1:20:20] of this violin
[1:20:22] i can't make it move i can't make it
[1:20:24] sing talk i can't make it do nothing
[1:20:27] and i'm sinking no matter how much these
[1:20:31] thing's actual worth is i don't possess
[1:20:35] the ability
[1:20:36] well we preaching now
[1:20:41] a lot of us are the auctioneer
[1:20:48] [Applause]
[1:20:51] we shouldn't be
[1:20:55] but i'm gonna keep going on
[1:20:56] that's all right y'all take that home
[1:20:58] with you
[1:21:00] right but he didn't the thing the thing
[1:21:02] the thing
[1:21:03] had value
[1:21:06] right
[1:21:07] the people that was auctioning watch
[1:21:10] this the way that they looked at the the
[1:21:12] instrument it was all
[1:21:14] it was it just didn't have much of an
[1:21:17] appeal
[1:21:19] right
[1:21:21] see
[1:21:25] colonel most often looking at the
[1:21:28] outside
[1:21:30] right
[1:21:31] god this thing
[1:21:33] it's just
[1:21:34] well i'm finna get y'all
[1:21:35] people listen people will give
[1:21:38] thousands and thousands of dollars to
[1:21:40] warn out michael jordans
[1:21:42] [Music]
[1:21:44] i'm done with real is money money
[1:21:46] that we could almost live off the rest
[1:21:48] of our life for a pair of raggedy
[1:21:51] michael jordan worn
[1:21:54] shoes right
[1:21:57] and then then things that really have
[1:22:00] you know real value
[1:22:03] right you know sometimes like our
[1:22:05] children and
[1:22:06] family members
[1:22:08] and things of that nature you know that
[1:22:10] we look at and we cast aside and all
[1:22:13] that child ain't gonna be nothing
[1:22:17] yeah it'll be nothing
[1:22:19] she's not gonna be nothing
[1:22:21] they ain't gonna that family
[1:22:24] y'all know what i'm talking about
[1:22:27] we we
[1:22:28] we put ourselves in categories uh this
[1:22:31] family but this this one and this that
[1:22:34] one and that's nonsense
[1:22:37] that that really is it's it's it
[1:22:39] you can't you can't look at things from
[1:22:42] that standpoint
[1:22:44] right i'm i'm still preaching i'm gonna
[1:22:46] help us this morning
[1:22:48] because we we do a lot of damage but
[1:22:50] it's the way that we look at things we
[1:22:52] look at things amen uh from a common uh
[1:22:56] standpoint
[1:22:58] naturally and things of that nature
[1:23:01] right and it just really shows that
[1:23:03] we're just the auctioneer
[1:23:06] right
[1:23:07] but but but thank thank god though
[1:23:10] thank god that there was a real master
[1:23:13] yeah there was somebody with real
[1:23:16] ability
[1:23:17] in in one of the quotes i uh paces i i
[1:23:21] have right here brother batman say he he
[1:23:23] was the creator of it he was the
[1:23:24] designer of the the the uh uh violin
[1:23:29] right right it was like he couldn't take
[1:23:31] it
[1:23:32] he stepped forth took the little thing
[1:23:35] and
[1:23:37] right
[1:23:38] why he had ability
[1:23:41] right he wasn't looking at the age
[1:23:44] how old it was
[1:23:46] sometimes the things that were made back
[1:23:49] then are more valuable than the things
[1:23:51] that are made now
[1:23:55] people people pay countless dollars for
[1:23:59] stuff that we look at and say oh that
[1:24:01] ain't nothing
[1:24:02] because we we like the understanding
[1:24:06] huh
[1:24:07] of its real value it kind of kind of
[1:24:10] reminds me of the story of the little
[1:24:11] boy who who who found a little stamp
[1:24:24] took that step to the man that man gave
[1:24:27] what 50 cent a dollar something like
[1:24:28] that i can't remember the price huh
[1:24:32] 15 cent or something like that
[1:24:34] and all he could see but the man who
[1:24:36] sold it to him
[1:24:39] huh
[1:24:40] he looked at the stamp with some
[1:24:41] understanding in real life but i got my
[1:24:43] little subs up
[1:24:44] i might have paid 15 cent but you know
[1:24:47] uh this thing is worth a little bit more
[1:24:50] and now brother banner makes the
[1:24:51] statement he said that thing worth
[1:24:52] thousand dollars down that's right
[1:24:54] that's right
[1:24:56] who's that that's right when i was
[1:24:58] growing up to be stamps meant to put on
[1:25:00] envelopes to mail letters
[1:25:04] nothing come on y'all with me not to
[1:25:07] save and put in this and that other and
[1:25:10] become rich off for no
[1:25:14] sometimes you know the way that people
[1:25:16] look at you know you look at art
[1:25:18] and and all of that
[1:25:22] they what
[1:25:24] they pay high for that
[1:25:28] see
[1:25:28] we don't see a lot of times the
[1:25:30] significance
[1:25:32] we we don't tap into the inspiration
[1:25:35] behind it yeah right because a lot of
[1:25:38] art collector you know i remember
[1:25:41] me and my wife we was over in europe we
[1:25:43] went to england and uh
[1:25:45] we went to the museum and we were seeing
[1:25:47] michelangelo and some of these great
[1:25:48] artists and you know stuff i'm looking
[1:25:50] at
[1:25:52] and and and they're like but if you
[1:25:54] could get out of here with one of these
[1:25:56] paintings you said
[1:25:58] huh i'm looking at
[1:26:00] that ugly thing
[1:26:04] see but you you here here's the thing
[1:26:08] you're not i'm not an art collector
[1:26:10] and and and
[1:26:12] the back story
[1:26:16] right
[1:26:17] the inspiration yeah i like brother
[1:26:19] branham telling stories to a lot of
[1:26:21] times for years and years and years i
[1:26:22] thought it was stories but you start
[1:26:24] growing you start preaching you realize
[1:26:28] from a story
[1:26:31] right a story has a message in it right
[1:26:34] i was even maybe last week one day um
[1:26:39] i was i was listening to
[1:26:42] a biography of this
[1:26:44] african girl
[1:26:46] um i forgot what country she was from
[1:26:49] uh she's a a pretty
[1:26:51] famous ballerina now
[1:26:54] right and and
[1:26:56] man when she was a little girl her her
[1:26:58] parents got killed over in africa do
[1:27:00] back in the day and thing
[1:27:01] and and and you know the village and the
[1:27:04] foster parents they call her child 27
[1:27:07] something like that
[1:27:09] and and
[1:27:10] she had a a skin disease
[1:27:13] right around her neck so there could
[1:27:15] okay she heard a story skin disease
[1:27:18] and and the the people in the community
[1:27:21] used to call her the child of the devil
[1:27:23] my god how many times we didn't did that
[1:27:27] the child of the devil
[1:27:29] people would look at him because of a
[1:27:31] skin disease
[1:27:33] and that's all that they can could see
[1:27:36] they couldn't see a a man a past her
[1:27:41] physical
[1:27:42] features
[1:27:44] right and and and this this disease that
[1:27:48] caused her neck in this area to spot
[1:27:53] so so they put her down they they kind
[1:27:56] of starved her and they treated her
[1:27:59] right
[1:28:00] they couldn't see no value
[1:28:05] they couldn't see no value in and
[1:28:07] somebody that looks like this
[1:28:11] right
[1:28:13] child of the devil
[1:28:18] so the story goes on you know one day
[1:28:20] she was playing outside of the foster
[1:28:22] home and
[1:28:23] and uh
[1:28:24] this paper flew there and she grabbed it
[1:28:28] it was the picture of a ballerina
[1:28:31] on it on one of these magazines
[1:28:33] and she grabbed it and she helped onto
[1:28:36] it that was god
[1:28:38] come on brother
[1:28:39] come on that that was that was god
[1:28:41] ordering her steps
[1:28:44] that's right
[1:28:46] see
[1:28:47] her life was changing the the moment she
[1:28:51] got that that started her destiny
[1:28:56] when the people around all that could
[1:28:58] see was this child oh jacked up with all
[1:29:02] of this then lost
[1:29:04] her mom and dad and treating her like
[1:29:07] this and that
[1:29:09] and so uh this this american couple
[1:29:12] white couple um they were they were
[1:29:15] looking for you know the adopt they i
[1:29:17] think they had lost their children so
[1:29:19] they wanted to you know adopt and
[1:29:21] and uh so the people told him we got a
[1:29:24] girl they probably were saying they said
[1:29:26] we could we got somebody for you
[1:29:30] you know y'all know y'all know how
[1:29:31] people a lot
[1:29:33] people can be real crew
[1:29:36] right
[1:29:37] and so when the person the lady adopted
[1:29:39] her you know she couldn't speak english
[1:29:42] and the lady started asking what she
[1:29:44] wanted to do she ran and grabbed she ran
[1:29:46] and grabbed her paper
[1:29:48] she said this
[1:29:50] right she wanted to be a ballerina
[1:29:53] the the child that that the child that
[1:29:56] that that didn't look like nothing that
[1:29:58] people didn't want
[1:30:00] right that lady made the difference
[1:30:04] in her life
[1:30:05] see it changed things when she got
[1:30:08] adopted by somebody that could see her
[1:30:12] for more than than this thing around her
[1:30:15] neck
[1:30:17] huh
[1:30:19] somebody that was mature
[1:30:22] that could see her for more
[1:30:25] see that there's more for her to express
[1:30:30] and begin to put her put her in you know
[1:30:32] the right places you know ballet ballet
[1:30:35] and things of that nature now she's a
[1:30:37] worldwide ballerina
[1:30:40] right
[1:30:41] but people that lack lack vision
[1:30:45] that that that could only see the
[1:30:47] exterior
[1:30:49] with no ability
[1:30:51] a man to comprehend that you know what
[1:30:54] uh there's there's more to her than the
[1:30:57] outside
[1:31:01] right
[1:31:02] glory to god so this this this master
[1:31:06] of this violin when when people looked
[1:31:09] at this thing like this thing oh
[1:31:11] man
[1:31:12] why would i why would i invest my
[1:31:14] resources in something
[1:31:16] it just took the master
[1:31:21] right to make the difference
[1:31:24] when that man got finished brother
[1:31:25] branham said it wasn't a dry eye nowhere
[1:31:30] and what what was perceived as and
[1:31:33] looked at us all and nothing now was
[1:31:36] worth countless of dollars
[1:31:38] it became a bidding war
[1:31:42] a bit abandoned war for something that
[1:31:45] that you know one man presented
[1:31:49] right with no ability
[1:31:52] no ability he presented it just as
[1:31:55] numbers
[1:32:10] with the instrument
[1:32:12] [Music]
[1:32:13] new new it's real
[1:32:16] real worth its quality it's it's
[1:32:19] understand its ability to make music
[1:32:24] man cause caused the whole thing to just
[1:32:27] like go just oh my god
[1:32:30] right yeah right
[1:32:33] he made the difference
[1:32:35] right he made the difference
[1:32:39] that that that individual he
[1:32:41] made the difference
[1:32:44] right let let me read a couple of things
[1:32:45] and we'll keep moving i got a little bit
[1:32:47] of time
[1:32:49] y'all all right
[1:32:50] can i go home
[1:32:52] praise god
[1:32:54] amen see he says there was an auction
[1:32:56] there one time that he had no fill up
[1:32:58] there you heard it
[1:32:59] uh an old violin the auctioneer said
[1:33:02] when i'm uh what am i offered for it
[1:33:06] he said i may not have this just right
[1:33:08] he said according to the poem it's been
[1:33:09] many many years right he said they
[1:33:11] picked up the old fiddle
[1:33:13] didn't look very much
[1:33:16] didn't look very much looks crummy and
[1:33:19] everything
[1:33:21] how many times we'd have done that
[1:33:23] right child as a baby walking through
[1:33:27] you know
[1:33:28] you know schneider nose crusty dirty
[1:33:31] pampers on and
[1:33:33] you know from a household that man does
[1:33:36] open and
[1:33:37] countrified and you know we dignified
[1:33:40] so-called and all that then you find
[1:33:42] that that child grows up to be
[1:33:44] lawyer doctor
[1:33:46] huh and you all you gotta take that back
[1:33:51] you can't judge things like that amen
[1:33:55] we see
[1:33:56] i'm i'ma say this even before i get to
[1:33:59] it
[1:34:00] we we
[1:34:01] we bought a new birth we have the mind
[1:34:03] of christ
[1:34:05] right
[1:34:07] we we have the revelation of the word of
[1:34:09] god
[1:34:10] right
[1:34:12] wow this is empty
[1:34:14] come on y'all y'all don't win out the
[1:34:16] door on me
[1:34:19] huh
[1:34:20] right we we have the thoughts of god
[1:34:24] right
[1:34:26] the mind of god
[1:34:28] god sees things
[1:34:30] perfect see we have to change how we
[1:34:34] look at things
[1:34:36] especially in the economy of god
[1:34:39] even outside of the economy of god
[1:34:42] right right
[1:34:44] amen because if you look at a sinner
[1:34:46] like he's just a drunk he's just a bomb
[1:34:48] he's never going to be nothing he's
[1:34:49] never
[1:34:51] you'll never be able to help that person
[1:34:53] never ever ever ever ever ever ever
[1:34:56] right see god you know jesus didn't
[1:35:00] jesus did could y'all imagine the the
[1:35:02] woman at the well and i'm taste i
[1:35:04] believe i believe jesus sent the fellows
[1:35:06] away
[1:35:07] because he realized they ain't gonna be
[1:35:09] able to handle this
[1:35:11] [Music]

[1:35:48] could see
[1:35:50] right
[1:35:52] jesus
[1:35:53] looked beyond the outside
[1:35:57] and saw that she was represented
[1:36:01] there was representation by
[1:36:03] predestination
[1:36:04] that's exactly right
[1:36:06] see christ made the difference

[1:38:08] oh my god that's why god went in there
[1:38:11] and wiped out her path eradicated
[1:38:14] [Applause]
[1:38:17] so so he could elevate her and she never
[1:38:20] had to look and worry about looking back
[1:38:24] at somebody whispering because everybody
[1:38:27] in her house was grateful
[1:38:30] like brother jack was reaching everybody
[1:38:32] that a man that came under the token was
[1:38:35] grateful that she had enough faith
[1:38:38] amen to put this scholar color card
[1:38:41] outside of the house to stay the wrath
[1:38:44] of god
[1:38:45] they was grateful grateful grace and

[1:38:51] see when you're grateful you you know
[1:38:53] the grateful people they ain't
[1:38:55] criticizing to talk about this
[1:39:04] for getting a revelation of amen what a
[1:39:08] man would stay the wrath
[1:39:10] of
[1:39:11] because the whole city was worried
[1:39:15] one was no fight and no man
[1:39:19] even though they were big and everything
[1:39:20] they were no fighting them dudes
[1:39:23] huh
[1:39:29] amen god god sought to god
[1:39:32] you know i'm jesus i'm glad god saw more

[2:00:44] just as specific as moses to bring the
[2:00:47] people out of egypt
[2:00:49] right just as specific as john the
[2:00:52] baptist introducing christ the first
[2:00:54] time
[2:00:55] and god could have used anybody it
[2:00:57] didn't have to be moses it could have
[2:00:58] been a guy by the name of joe
[2:01:00] but he chose moses
[2:01:02] and it knows that he could have chose
[2:01:04] um you know noel but he chose noah right
[2:01:09] and uh and this day he brought brother
[2:01:11] branham for a very specific purpose and
[2:01:13] that's to bring the word of god to us
[2:01:15] that's all his job was is to bring the
[2:01:18] word of god to us and now we're
[2:01:19] fellowshipping around this word and just
[2:01:22] just when you think about how you talked
[2:01:24] about that old violin and um i mean you
[2:01:26] you look at it everybody thought there
[2:01:28] was no value to it
[2:01:30] our lives were the same way
[2:01:32] people thought there was no value to us
[2:01:35] but look at us when god gets a hold of
[2:01:37] us
[2:01:38] christ makes the difference when god
[2:01:40] gets a hold of us then there's value in
[2:01:42] everything that's done
[2:01:44] i'm so glad he got a hold of me
[2:01:47] i'm so glad i
[2:01:49] i just i just thank god and just just
[2:01:51] just a wonderful wonderful thought i'm
[2:01:54] leaving here knowing that i've been to
[2:01:56] church
[2:01:57] amen and i heard from god
[2:02:00] i got strength to carry me through the
[2:02:01] week you know amen i just appreciate the
[2:02:05] lord jesus so let's continue to keep our
[2:02:07] precious brother in prayer amen that the
[2:02:10] lord will just continue to inspire him
[2:02:12] and uh that he'll keep continuing to
[2:02:13] speak through him um we'll prepare
[2:02:16] uh to to just have a closing word of
[2:02:19] prayer and um
[2:02:21] um i know that for some of the brothers
[2:02:24] we just have to turn the room around a
[2:02:26] little bit amen for them to use for the
[2:02:29] for this week so if you don't mind just
[2:02:31] helping us out we greatly appreciate
[2:02:33] that one of the things that um we were
[2:02:35] talking about this yesterday i heard the
[2:02:36] family talking about at home uh we we
[2:02:39] know this is temporary what we're doing
[2:02:41] because you know we're at church that we
[2:02:43] love the fellowship most of y'all go to
[2:02:45] churches and y'all are the last ones to
[2:02:47] leave
[2:02:48] all the other saints done left that
[2:02:50] church they didn't go home and y'all
[2:02:51] still in their parking lot
[2:02:52] fellowshipping
[2:02:54] and that that's just who we are right we
[2:02:56] we love our brother branham talked about
[2:02:58] um uh it talked to one brother saying
[2:03:00] how do you get the people to just do
[2:03:02] that like they just love each other they
[2:03:04] love being in each other's presence they
[2:03:06] love fellowship with one another and uh
[2:03:08] you know just that's something that god
[2:03:10] does that's nothing that a preacher does
[2:03:11] right so so you know i i i i know that
[2:03:15] sometimes when the time constraints i
[2:03:16] feel like we got to break our fellowship
[2:03:18] and i just can't wait to see what god
[2:03:20] get ready to do so that we don't have to
[2:03:22] lose that amen so you know we want to go
[2:03:24] ahead and do what we have to do here and
[2:03:26] then maybe we can fellowship a little
[2:03:28] bit there just talking about the word of
[2:03:30] god and just how we just appreciate what
[2:03:31] the lord has done for us today so let's
[2:03:33] have a word of prayer amen and we will
[2:03:36] prepare to dismiss god we thank you for
[2:03:39] uh your word on today thank you for your
[2:03:41] servant
[2:03:43] lord brother smiley just coming to
[2:03:45] reveal to us amen your thoughts and
[2:03:49] god just how much you love us we are
[2:03:51] your workmanship
[2:03:53] lord and uh
[2:03:55] and where where
[2:03:56] others might have thought there was no
[2:03:58] value at all to our lives
[2:04:00] god when they look to see what you've
[2:04:02] done for us and in us
[2:04:04] they have to admit that this is nothing
[2:04:06] but the hand of almighty god and father
[2:04:09] how grateful that you have taken us from
[2:04:11] nothingness just like you took this
[2:04:13] earth from nothingness
