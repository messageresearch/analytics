open my mouth gotta open my mouth so I'm gonna the atmosphere praise the Lord praise the Lord no I was listening to the radio as I was riding I believe it was on Thursday and there was a minister speaking and he took two scriptures and he put them together said if you confess me before the people something to that nature it slips on my mind right now I'll confess you before my father which is in heaven and then over in Luke it says I'll confess you before the angels of God he said so Jesus Christ is the word so whenever you put the word on your mouth and you begin to confess it before men then God employs his angels to bring it to pass so he puts the angels to work when Jesus goes and confess you before the Father and before the Angels and I thought that was something because if God gives you a command like our pastor gave us the word back last year over your mouth and I will feel that that was a word of God to us so when you begin to obey that word you start speaking that word now God employs the Angels to go forth and then the Angels begin to move brother Caleb gave a awesome testimony about when we felt the presence of a law coming to a little business meeting that we were having and he said I will not lack and then God employed the angels because he confessed him before men while he was confessing before one of them was a sinner one was a nominal Christian and then there was a believer there so he confessed this before men and then the angel of the Lord was employed to put a thousand dollars at his feet so you put the Word of God upon your mouth don't be ashamed of him before me and confess the word Amen if God has given you a promise by His stripes I'm healing you are sick you confess that before the doctors God went for the angels to bring it to pass he's a lord man he's worthy to be praised [Music] come on and bless the Lord with me come on and bless the Lord baby come on and bless the Lord with me come on [Music] [Music] come on and clap

man he is he is certainly moving in the midst of his people and we're we're grateful they meant for all that he is doing a man for us a man praise the Lord we want to just give a few announcements in a man and we'll move forward in the service a man we want to continue just encourage you be as safe as possible a man during this season I have been getting texts from everywhere just different people that have been feeling symptoms and and and and things that nature last night I heard from from brother Jeff a member of the Jeff banks and he said that his chest just began to tighten up on him and he wanted to go back to the hospital and you know just just have them check things out and and as he you know he went there to the hospital you know he said that the the doctors did say that he actually had the virus and I told him brother we just gone we gonna believe God alright because I know that soon as you go with a symptom they gonna give it to you 90 you're gonna get it because they gonna give it to you but you you can refuse it a man that the box of rattlesnakes that the devil try to send you away you say send it back I'm not taking it and so he act we prayed with him and we know that at the initial phase of this for the Jeff was filling something in his body and and and he went in and and they they said that they didn't they didn't see anything but he said well I just got free rent for about two weeks a man at the hospital I said that's the way to look at you gotta have the right right mental attitude when you're going through things right and you know so he was just I said God brought you through before I know he'll do it again and and so he just solicit our prayer is also sister Cheryl and she said I'm T Abigail they weren't feeling their best but they asked for our prayers and and also sister kid kash Neda she asks for our prayers who she hasn't been feeling her best so every symptom that we are refuted the name of the Lord Jesus Christ when rebuking it in Jesus name so let's remember these Saints of Prayer got another purpose from South Carolina one of the saints of the church a friend of theirs they said if she doesn't have a move of God she won't make it through the night so we just want to pray that God will just hold up a half a man we believe God and we believe God the same God they touch such diverse situations I love that promise man thanks Abraham and Sarah say anything you know and anything includes anything so whatever it is that we're believing of or let's just trust him a minute he's going to bring us through will

you we thank you Lord for all that you have done and continue to do this in Jesus name that we pray amen amen amen praise the Lord [Music] I was in prayer this morning the scripture just kind of came to him and I wanted to read it to us Isaiah fifty-four Isaiah 54 just a quick scripture I want to be [Music] starting at verse one here says Stingo baron now that's dis not here break forth into singing and cry aloud now that did not now that dis not travail with child for more are the children the desolate than the children of the merit wives they had the Lord and the way brother branham brings this to our attention it's you're gonna have more in denominational churches that you're gonna have in the bride's all right but it says the verse says enlarge the place that I tent and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitation spare not lengthen my course and strengthen thy States for thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left and my seed shall inherit the Gentiles and make desolate cities to be inhabited praise God this scripture was given to me and it just kind of came back to my spirit and it was a scripture that I believe was for even us expanded into a new church into school I wrote this down somebody gave me a stink and told me to write the scripture down and put on the stink and just kind of declare some things and I wrote it down in 2017 I declared I declare that we were having to church into school and I declare that we would have a resources amen in order to accomplish this and you know and as I looked at how I wrote things down God has done like the first three things that I wrote down God has already done and the part where he said resources I just begin to think about the building fund account I said God you have blessed us with resources so we can make something happen so the next step for this is that that's the new church in the new school whatever the property is that God has for us we got Stefan to is assumed I believe that with all my heart I'm I'm under expectation hallelujah and as I was reading the scripture I've written something in my Bibles time ago and I said what does that I wrote down on my Bible I looked at it was gentle gentle William Carey hey man it was a minister and years ago and also just took on a lot of big projects I believe he was also involved with kind of taking care of doing shelters and things like that for for kids that didn't have homes and he was reading the same scripture he he wrote a statement to himself he says expect great things from God and attempt great things for God that one occurs at church expect great things from God and then a temper things for God hallelujah i'ma say it again expect great things from God and then once you get it temp great things for God hallelujah Amen I mean I'm on the expectation God's gonna do some great things praise the Lord well this morning we have acts brother quick coup to come and share with us amen on today and I'm sure that the Lord will bless our hearts a man I've certainly been blessed by his ministry and disappearing how the Lord uses him and you know so this morning he'll be coming to speak to our hearts so let's just stand a man to feed and let's welcome our precious brother to the full fit as it comes to share the gospel of Jesus Christ with us state man this morning we can continue to sing that softly jihoh jihoh she / she / Bochy / - seola ji [Music] Chiho Chiho sickening it whoa [Music] [Applause] there's no point students for the Lord amen and I'll tell you why what I wouldn't reach about is G Hawaii had it's got to do me home sharing free our 10 our Father Lord the love of mankind fountain of all blessings Lord we are here before you know Jesus cried this morning coming from various

courage and confidence the Lord you are Jehovah you are with them Lord Jesus Christ you never forsake your people Lord for you say that I'll be with you even in you on to the end of the world urg over el shaddai Elohim Rafa Lord God significant oh you are all of it Lord Jesus Christ and we have no doubt and no fear that our Father above is right in our hearts manifesting your glory and taking us through this covered situation Lord to bring it to the other side for the glory of your name you are the same Lord who took Lord Noah through day that the flat Lord about for three thousand years ago and you brought him to the other side Lord God for a testimony Lord and for your witness Lord you are the same one Lord and you are doing the same thing blessing and Anna belong to your name in Jesus Christ and we pray amen glory hallelujah to the Lord shall we give a clap offering unto the Lord [Applause] Sharon take a seat for god bless you sisters the Lord is good amen the Lord is always good he always has something for us and the Lord will never leave it lead you to a situation that has not already equip you for though you might not know he said keep you but when the situation arises you would know that this equip you he leaded Joseph to us different situations he equip him before he led Hannah through certain situation she equip Aaron he played a Samson through a situation where he faced a lion when he didn't plan to fight a lion but at the right time the Bible said that anointing of the Lord move on Samson the anointing was in him but then it wasn't our knowing him onto the situation came and when the situation arose the anointing came from within out and then took care of the lion amen so the same Lord the same device with you and whatever situation you are going through now is already equip you and it's prepared you for it Amen when I begin to think about what a minister went into prayer and something came upon my had about seven compound attribute of Jehovah but as I kept stating and praying it was modified to change it today the attributes the servant divine attribute of Elohim amen because their servant before the servant they should be an eighth there should be a zero to start counting from one through seven so the seven attributes has to come from some way and all of them came from Elohim amen so we want to without wasting time let's pick out scriptures and look at how those attributes manifest in your life and we know that God is not God of history he did things in the history which we recollect and read from the Bible to build our faith to seven as an example but I didn't and in history if it ended in history then the scripture should be taken from the Bible Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday history today right now and forever future amen so God is not God of history he was God of history but he's not God of history in the time of Abraham in the time of Wesley in the time of granham he did what he could do in the time of our fathers he did what he needed to do but then is the same God the same Elohim the same Christ Jesus the same mechanic the same son of God son of David son of man right in our time writing you manifesting what he promised manifest for this day amen glory hallelujah so we want to talk about the seven divine attributes of Elohim seven divine attributes of Elohim and Elohim is the eighth is the zero and eight amen let's start a little foundation before reading scriptures Elohim means the soft assistant one is a Hebrew word wait LLL o him we modified it in English to be able to sit in our tank but an original where it means the soft assistant the surface system one the one who doesn't need anybody's hope to exist it doesn't need oxygen to exist it doesn't need ventilator to exist it doesn't need a doctor to exist it doesn't need a medicine to bought a house for him he done it doesn't need a creator because he himself is the creator amen he's the Elohim so is the Almighty is the all-powerful all sufficient soft assistant one that is Elohim amen and in him is every fountain of every blessing comes from Elohim all the blessings that you can look around creation itself came from Elohim without him nothing will exist amen both good and bad nothing can exist without Elohim permitting it amen and what we see as good and bad is all designed to work for the profit of Elohim amen just like let's say when we began this year we talked about year 2020 I remember but I preached on it that is even beyond 2020 vision 2020 2020 is just up to 2020 but is way beyond is in eternity on engine amen so we started the year nicely then we heard about some virus in China you know coming from the news some viral somewhere from different angle which we never thought of this virus coming to us or any part of the world then or too soon this virus begin to hit different part of the world everywhere on the planet in the u.s. just the motor continent and then this virus took over the world amen as if there is no God as if God is not in control as if God is sleeping and something over to him no amen if you read Isaiah chapter 45 1 through 7 si I'm the Lord I created good and I do evil I the LORD do all these things amen so there's not nothing as an angel of the Lord standing right upon the earth amen who is permitting this to go on for divine attributes amen glory hallelujah to the Lord amen glory hallelujah there's nothing we know that a prophet professor about it that is there was going to be a disease that the doctors would not have any anti due to it they wouldn't have a clue what to do to do to it the America books will end when those disease comes on earth because you can read order for my city cause that's my area or the medication thousand and plus none of them can treat this virus or the science is the big one on the planet all over Europe Africa Asia America just name them sad America none of them can fathom where this disease is coming from because he's beyond the beyond amen is what ello implemented for eternal attributes amen you are asked why do why does Elohim permit that why doesn't we enjoy daughter blessing let me use this for example you know Israel in the year around 1940 40 46 48 something begin to happen we know the world war we know what happened to Israel millions of them were killed that one scripture for that Israel will go back to her homeland so for Israel to go back to a homeland god I mean allow a man called a Hitler to arise a dictator and he was even a half job he had he was Jewish himself but then he slaughtered the Jews like he was slaughtering animals just to foreign scripture Israel to be uncomfortable in the Gentile world and go back to Jerusalem to for food richer email when the lot himself was born before that there was a lot of scriptures that Rachel was crying and mourning for her children but they were not found a lot was born we know the story of the three wise men who were ordained to go and worship the Lord and they passed by the King as a he wrote one of the King when he heard said Wow if there's a king born let me know so I can worship Him but they didn't know his heart he was looking at this political Kingdom that Wow so there's going to be a king greater than me I got to take care of this skin so he was deceiving the white man where the wise men but then the lord elohim being with them didn't name everything so he disclosed it to them that don't go back to Herod go by another way and when he saw that he has been tricked they have been more clever and he was he was anointed to forfeit a scripture there Rachel thousands of a children in other was the Hebrew children were slaughtered and Herod commanded that any child looking at historic seas looking at data looking at solicit data based on the data he might be under two years so all the young boys are boys from two-year and under less to cure them so there's the cutest begin to take off those little kiss so that is my before food a scripture that that sons and daughters of rich ritual was crying and mourning for children but they were not the kids were killed amen so it was part of the Scriptures yes it wasn't good part that you want to you wanted to happen but as part of the Scriptures so that it would be fourfold amen because the Lord God is with a law of contrasts the Lord permits the good he permit the bad he permit a bath so that it could be manifested if you never got sick you didn't never need a healer amen you didn't need to verify but if you got sick before that is what you can appreciate Jesus the Rafah in your life the great doctor and the great physician in your life amen if you never be distressed before where you've confused why you couldn't sleep where you couldn't your heart is in turmoil you never enjoyed peace when you can sister and you can see peace all around internally and externally but because we've gone through grief and you've gone through a distress and perplexity of time you can appreciate a piece of Christ in your heart you would even appreciate the new wave if you were not we were not born in sin and iniquity and we were telling lies without even thinking about it you are doing things without thinking about it somebody was motivated with motivating from the inside to do sin but then there was a time someone else took over destroy that the one who was motivated to do evil and then there was a piece that you've never experienced in this dimension and you got to know that behold I am the Lord amen glory hallelujah so begin of this year I will talk about a blessing that was coming the year 2020 all the changes or the organizational groups politics everybody knew there was something going to happen but we never anticipated that it was going to be a coronavirus but God is using the coronavirus to bring their blessing to really divine attributes to manifest on earth amen because the Lord looks beyond our goose and our bus he lose at his word being four-fold what I was good or when I was bad amen so the word of the Lord is he an amen but you have been ordained to fulfill the divine part of the weight that is your blessing amen so let's read Genesis chapter 22 verse 14 let's pick the face attributes Genesis 26 22 14 if you want to be on our feet we can blessed be the name of the Lord Genesis 22 14 glory hallelujah to the Lord okay let's go back a story about Abraham let's go back to 12 or like 10 an Abraham straight forth his hand and to the knife to slay his son and the angel of the Lord called out him out of heaven and said Abraham Abraham and he said Here I am Here I am I and he said lay not thy hand upon the lad neither do thou anything unto him for now I know that thou fearest God seen that scene thou hast not withheld thy son thine only son from me and Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns and Abram went and took the RAM and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son verse 14 and Abraham called the name of the place dov'è Jireh as it is said to this day in the amount of the Lord it shall be seen an angel of the Lord called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time and said by myself I sworn said the Lord for for because thou hast not that has done this and has not we held thy son thine only son that in blessing I will bless thee and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore and I seed shall possess the gate of his enemies amen shall we be seated glory hallelujah viii invested and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou has obeyed obeyed my voice amen so the Lord before he could manifest Jehovah Jireh in the life of Abraham there was supposed to be a trial because if there was no need for Brom to need a ram to neither good a mountain good whatever it is RAM then there was not I was not going to be any Java Jarrah has to be the scene but there should be a situation where Graham should come to a distress situation where he has to take take the life of his only son that he had prayed for years him and his wife Sarah since they married at at a tender age maybe they married around less 18 16 you know dose time didn't go to school they didn't have to go to high school and college you know get a job and August and so they didn't have television they didn't have technology or they need is what just Marie start your family life and they married they were nobody than you and I they were not different from you and I they were other worshipers his father was Abraham from the Bible means they were triplets if you go to the Bible when you read Abram he said they were born three of them Abraham I think two of his brothers lost father Terah they were actually triplet if you go today read from the Bible so they were just normal people but God ordained him for money for an eternal purpose so the Lord called him from his people and shown him a land he didn't assume the land but is that good where I'm going to show you by faith because the attribute of faith was embodied in Abraham so though he was another worshiper nothing was in him and there was a situation for the law to manifest it so the Lord called him and by faith he moved following the Lord he didn't matter eyes mystics amen he made a bunch of them but the Lord doesn't look up to the mystic he look up to the seed and a calling in your life amen the mystic will be taking care of amen so it doesn't matter how many miss this meat and how many you ever make the lost Colin doesn't I mean the law doesn't it doesn't make it the positives of God in your life I used to say that there's nothing good you can do to deserve eternal life and you cannot commit enough mystic to only treat your eternal life amen there's nothing you can do that eternal life in you will be unelected it does not happen amen so don't let your Mystics the past mister which is no video Mystics amen the one who these dudes and think is dead and gone amen you are just occupant of this Tabernacle he did all those mystics for to learn and experience but then you have a new occupant Jesus Christ who transform you and change you a so the past wasn't you Amen so it doesn't matter how you think about Abraham you've heard a lot yes he made a lot of mistakes but that didn't that didn't again the calling of the Lord in his life so there was a time that the Lord told Abram after living for ninety something years and his wife was almost 90 years or 1,900 they had a son Isaac they were happy the joy of their life and one day the Lord came to him the angel of the Lord came to him Abraham take your son your only son and go and sacrifice for him as a sacred gray and sacrifice for him sacrifice him for me how would you do it just like looking at year 2020 Oh a year is going to be a great year of grandeur blessings coming and will behold corn a virus is right here staring at our faces how you take it I go to see the Opera Jack you said that we could have all a wonderful blessing but Apple company says where you lie to us ways you didn't talk about core Navarro's yes that is part of the promise a male gen like Abraham amen the negative has to come in so I wanna cross over to the other side you can appreciate the positives amen without the negatives it's normal to you it was normal for us to come to church good go out and come in it was normal to even hug your brother and hug your sister but there was a time that you could even have

you are attend a person and you are here for eternal purpose nothing can take your life sometimes you pray you believe the Lord the Urraco not happen instantly there are certain diseases or sickness that you pray doesn't mean it doesn't mean you don't have faith it doesn't mean the law doesn't listen to your Freya but the Lord has a bigger testimony for you amen let's use William Rand for example William Bramley stomach problem which we know for years when sometime it's this is like something he's eating his stomach and it sprayed me what there was a time he said he prayed for people was doing a prayer line pray for cancers were dropping people were getting healed the dead were being he will raise but after that he couldn't even get up from to walk because of a stomach pain is not something that comes you couldn't describe it it's like something eaten his intestines and he prayed and believed the Lord me work it is healed when he pray for them people problems were solved thousands and millions of them but one day he went to pre and this demon which was like a squirrel came out he was trying to enter his mouth it hit a target and he was delivered and when that deliverance came his face was drawn on iraq according this state but he went home grab a camera went back to take a picture and there was his face drawn on a rock amen ordinarily I wouldn't have June his face on a rock had not been that situation but for believe in his healing even though he was going through the pain he was seen as symptoms he was going to read from D to D different times but it was a time when the Lord said I am your healer amen and he to the sickness away from him he never suffered from that sickness the rest of his life amen so a situation that could be lingering on it doesn't mean Allah doesn't care he's even new situation Mountain your feet higher and higher and higher and higher that you believe in just like your father Abraham just like your mother Sarah that you believe in that the Lord promised you is faithful to fulfill their promise glory hallelujah to the Lord amen it could be a live situation it could be al something you need in your life it could be whatever Berenice you want a child it could be wonder husband you want a wife you want grandchildren you want a job you want a house we want a change we want a school whatever you want they are all part of the promises for your life amen it might not happen the very hour you pray but it doesn't mean the Lord has turned a blind eye to it no he's letting the attribute to you come out stronger and stronger and stronger so what you believe that even though I don't see the child here maybe I admire you for 20 years I've been seing the child but I have a child of children amen and I and I've seen I've seen a situation where copper mine for years the woman was past 50 the man was past 50 and one day the woman miss have no man strapped Rodan she was thinking what's going on they went to do their tests she was pregnant she said my lord do you think it's true do I have a baby in my womb is every day said she has a husband do you think there's something my womb is I said don't you believe it that a lot has done it for us is I believe it but because it's lingered too much was so happy overjoyed that she could even believe that for real for rather something there's a baby in my womb she brought for this baby and I remember was in college we took a pitch ended the whole church is a big church about six hundred we took a picture with her sister and the husband and the baby went it was dedicated but as that was past fifty before she had the baby that was around 2000 to 2001 so the Lord is anything hard for the Lord there's nothing difficult for the Lord it doesn't matter the situation it doesn't matter how long you've been sick it doesn't matter how long you've been poor it might have been jobless it doesn't matter how long you've suffered the Lord is Jehovah Rapha amen the Lord is the one who heals all our sicknesses amen let's go to LEM give some more scriptures we don't have time to read all of them as a chapter 4 verse 5 maybe let's read this one Isaiah four and five slandered over alpha minded I scripture praise be to God praise be to God glory hallelujah amen permit me to read a whole scripture as a at a fall in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying we will eat our own bread and we're our own apparel only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach that was the seven th Ages when the force changed the false bride I wanted to marry Christ but he didn't want the name of Christ what is the name date date the gold it didn't want Christ to live in hey so only I want to be called a Christian I want to be called a church person but I don't want the Holy Ghost baptism I don't want the message for the hour I don't want to assert a message of the day I don't want to accept your mess messenger but I just want to be called a Christian I want to be a normal for my Christian amen because if I if an otherwise a party would not look good on you it would be a reproach so I want to be like a woman who is not married so when you are married okay misses something but meanwhile she doesn't respect a husband meanwhile the husband is running around with other women but at least she's caught misses so that is what the church wanted and in that dish had a brand by the second verse is that in the dish had a branch of the Lord now this the loss the branch coming from the Lord this is the true vine this is the true bride a true life of Christ must manifest in her character in that dish added shad a branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious and the fruits of the earth shall be excellent and calmly for them that are escaped of Israel and it shall come to pass that he that is left in Zion and he died minute in Jerusalem shall be called holy even every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and shall have preached the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment and by the sweat of Benin and the Lord will create upon every dwelling place of Mount Zion and upon high assemblies a cloud and a smoke by D and a Shannon of a flaming fire by night for upon all her glory shall be a difference amen Giovani see the one who defend

didn't wake up again something happened in the night that physically nobody can tell but supernatural is something to please because the up we've got principalities and spectra demons who come to the Bible say that the devil came to destroy to steal to destroy and to kill but Jesus Christ came to do what to give you life and give you abundantly eternal life and order blessing there is amen so Java Missy he's our banner is our protector he's we give that color red brown which is earthly color she often is don't need protection celestial bodies don't need protection they don't need earth they don't need a house to sleep in they don't need food to food to eat they don't need this water to drink they don't need a microphone we're beyond that dimension is beyond your chiefin is beyond this

a Shalom is our peace when you add distress sometimes I mean peace you can't get from your husband your wife cannot comfort you enough your mom cannot give you that comfort no matter how your mom

has got all this ammunition didn't have even nothin but a lot use it for purpose to protect the earth because the devil the demons want to bring that third world war bring destruction prematurely but

peace be unto thee so now because of the stories on that we are not not all of us are used to be so I'd like to go give a little background let's read from verse 19 when Gideon was in distress he was one of the judges in Israel and God went in and made ready a kid sorry and Gideon went in and made ready a kid the angel of the Lord came to announce his ministry that you should save Israel and he said me Who am I I am the least and so let's look at the conversation and Gideon went in and made ready a kid and unliving kicks of an ephah of flour the flesh he put in a basket and he put their broth in the pot and brought it out onto him under the oak and presented it and it and the angel of the Lord said unto him take their flesh and their own living kicks and lay them upon this rock and pour out their broth and his dessous then the angel of the Lord put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand and touch the flesh and only wind kicks and they rose up a fire out of the rock and consume the flesh and the living case then the angel of the Lord departed out of his sight and when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the Lord Gideon said alas o God our Lord God for because I have seen an angel of the Lord face to face and the Lord said unto him peace be unto thee fear not thou shalt not die then Gideon built an altar there onto the Lord and called it Jewish a log onto

something and it burns you maybe you didn't know you touch it it gives you distress the Lord is the sense it's the Lord is speaking to you it doesn't matter what it is doesn't matter the pleasure you get from it it doesn't matter whatever money you get from it if it doesn't give you a turn a piece internal and external peace is not for you stay away from it God will not bless you when God gives you something you bless you with it amen since that distress is you friends that distress is you they would not take you away from the word you know that those are not friends issue go with Amen but go with people that say Shalom to you from the heart people I say God bless you from their heart believers that speak to you you know God is in them amen one other sign the lawsuit between when he

God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe for there's no difference for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God the Lord Himself give us his

eat him he spit it out he said naw if you don't eat that can to get it down and that boy won't be healed sometimes you have to stand in the gap for somebody else right sometimes if you want to see
