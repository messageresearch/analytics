thank God just really really quick a man the update here last month a man we receive three thousand two hundred twenty nine thousand fifty Cent towards our Building Fund let's say praise the Lord for that we thank God and you know I'm gonna tell you you know I look at I look at you know we set a goal that's what we voted on we're gonna try to raise a hundred and five thousand dollars a year and then our pledge you know to that goal was fifty six thousand eight hundred and nine dollars a man towards a pledge and receive for this year we got seventeen thousand five hundred ninety nine dollars and sixty three cent and also received this year is interests of 284 73 right and and which gives us a net of seventeen thousand eight hundred eighty four thousand thirty six cent praise the Lord and I mean for me when I look at this I don't necessarily just stare at this column and I don't stare at this column but I start staring right here and I start staring right there because there was a time we couldn't get a dollar so to have seventeen thousand I celebrate that right I celebrate that and if this is my two fish and my five loaves of bread then I don't know what I know but my I can do with two fish and five loaves of bread he can feed a lot of folks right so I'm just I just think God for you all and you know as we are pressing our way to get a new building you know we came here you can get that brother Jimmy when we came here we were we were in a church it could see the by 60 people the church could seat 60 and we could never have any meetings never right because of you know we just didn't have that that that much space you know y'all remember it you know if you was you know it was just yeah you you come out the pulpit right then you come and you standing right back at the pulpit in the plainest you know so just you know we had we we it was set up you know just for us when we got started Lord my mind going back that isn't I'm going back the system Michelle when she walked in here for the first time I remember system Michelle walking there than at first I mean we even had we wouldn't even have a church at that time we were working on it and sister Michelle walked in there and she talking to us sister cop so y'all got a church yeah we got a little building you know where's that I need to get some so she come and see come in she looked around at one time this is Michelle see I can see myself sitting right there y'all know what's Michelle been sitting here ever since that time praise Allah I remember them I mean man we don't have some precious moments y'all right God God been good man I remember I don't remember the exact year but I know we the first service was open on my daughter's birthday she just celebrated a birthday yesterday thank God for that but it was open on her birthday that's that's 17 years ago 17 years ago that that the church opened and I remember we were there for a roughly five or six years something like that and when we when we decided to come here we necessarily didn't have you know a hundred I mean we didn't have sixty people filling it up right well I think we might have had about forty when we came here and and we came here by faith I rent double when we came we had the same amount of people and I rent doubled right and and when the rent double you know we were we were you know not we were concerned yeah but you know I can see for the past 12 years God has not failed right God has not paid thank God been good to us but God been real good to us and you know and and and you know just just again when I just start going down memory lane to so many things just really speak to my heart you know and and and and and I'm under expectation that our situation will change we're gonna own our own building I'm on expectation for that we're gonna own our own building we certainly thank God we certainly thank God for what he's done you know and we we're looking forward to it we're looking forward to what God has in store praise the Lord Chantal so good to see y'all a man the girls the girls our girls with some special girls to us we thank God for them and amen what grades are y'all going to now eighth and eleventh Lord Jesus where has the time gone that's all right thank God amen a man we appreciate Joe my daughter Sara a man she would come and sing a song for us on today and you know I was just thinking to myself you know if I can go to Australian to a concert I can show Lee some song service right here in West Palm Beach and so I was I was kind of happy that things worked out the way that they did and I didn't know mom was gonna set me up this morning at the singing but but I think everything God just do you just work everything out right and see you know for me when we're not when I think about going to Australia I was telling the church and thank you brother Jerry he spoke last week at Pinnacle Palms he did a wonderful job a man there praise the Lord it was talking about a burn into the promise I believe so right born born born I got like oh my old man you looking I got doctors writing brother but born into the promise dinky but you know as he was preaching I was just thinking when we were out there pinnacle palms God watches over our faithfulness God remembers faithfulness and he rewards you for faithfulness if I can tell our young brothers young sisters one and when brother Misaka came here and preached that message about faithfulness that was a very important sermon right if there's anything that you you can learn as a young person learn to be faithful and let me tell you something you're not faithful to brother Jack that's just not about brother Jack this is about being faithful to the Lord Jesus he's the one that's done great things for you right you know they're just it's just a place where you can show faithfulness but this is not about doing it for brother Jack so sometimes we get them at my will brother Jack brother Jim no no no it's God that rewards my brother Jack right it's got that does it so I can if I can encourage you to do one thing in your life learn to be faithful faithful and you know what faithful faithful not just showing the church on Sunday it's not just doing that I mean it you as a Christian anytime a church to us open you want you should want to be there that's that's as a Christian anytime the church doors open but but one thing I would encourage you like like what we used to do we got a church 30 minutes ahead of time that was an actually 45 minutes at a time because as brothers we were prayed over the sanctuary before the people came in we didn't just do that on meetings we did that every week right so if I could encourage you you'd be faithful I remember not having no degree and I'm taught all of us me my brother my cousin we just graduated high school sister Tina didn't have a little college degrees and then we went straight out the Pratt Whitney and got jobs and we had jobs that we could take care of my family's a man that because of faithfulness oh my God will bless you beyond measure because of faithfulness I remember brother Wescoe when he got his first house and brother Wescoe he was he used to live in an apartment and as a pastor like man we won't want to see pastor bless he had he had an apartment and he was just still Stanley serving and praising the Lord that part with Department him and sister Wesco and one day he invited said I want to come and see this blessing the Lord got me because I did a Martin circle thank you Jesus we were so happy about that house and I remember walking through the house table just I was I was at Meijer and everything and I said it's this come from faithfulness and brothers brother let's go say that struck his heart because he couldn't understand why he got the blessing but when they heard that faithful they should say this is what God gave it to me and God then did a double double on talk about being faithful I'm talking about I'm trying to get out and get my daughter feel he was in a position where they told him that he could not have the loan because it's his income fluctuated as a passive income fluctuates you never know when somebody gonna get mad at you and you gotta keep reaching and you realize something that a man God is your source everything else is resource all right but God is your source but I remember the let's go say they told him no he couldn't get that loss they said we tried we tried we can't get you this loan and brother wesco told the man on phone he said you keep doing what you do and I'm gonna keep doing what I do they say well what'd you do he say I pray so you keep doing what you do and I'm gonna do what I do and a man call back a few days later say sir we got the loan approve and he walked right on in and got their house live there faithfully ended up with two houses till he sold it sold one and he told you how to test them out a few weeks ago he got the other house and needed $29,000 to close Sarah Gavin I don't have it and I didn't hear the whole rest of the testimony but but I heard him say somebody blessed him when he walked in on closing day and somebody blessed him with 29,000 let's see ugh is the if I was meaty I'll be honest I look for who the person that person went to another you want to get to know that man I'm gonna tell you who the person is you can get to know him real quick his name is Jesus praise the Lord sister Sarah would you come and bless us with a song amen on today praise the Lord amen [Applause] [Music] I [Music] you [Music] you're grown we trust [Music] we trust you [Music] Adri and God promises remain we trust you we trust you [Music] right [Music] we trust you we trust [Music] we trust you we trust [Music] forever more [Music] [Music] my my love Oh [Music] [Music] I [Music] we [Music] and we [Music] we trust you [Music] [Music] raining baby [Music] [Music] we need you [Music] praise his name [Music] praise the Lord a man let's stand a man and get our Bibles I wanted to also mention Thank You musicians appreciate you all very much you can turn my mic down just a little bit add a little back here brother Jerry wanted me to mention that the wedding in November was open to the church there in Haiti and be the wedding will occur there in Haiti and he would just need just a number from how many people were planning to go there they'll give Hotel information so everybody would know what it would cost but if you you know desire to go what's the date again November November 16th hey man don't forget that date brother Jerry never forget that date after you're married don't forget that date man but uh so November 16th is a date of the wedding they're in Haiti and if you desire to go just please make sure a man he's notified or at least let us know something so that there won't be any surprises on that date November 16th amen in Haiti praise the Lord so let's let's turn a man in our Bible to 2nd Peter chapter 1 we've been reading this a man going through our journey here on war strategies and today we will focus on temperance a man war strategies temperance and when I was in Zimbabwe for brother simba sister ruse wedding one of the brothers was preached and I was behind him and he did a little something on his phone where he said a little timer on the phone that kind of so he'll know just you know how much time he was there in the pulpit so I've been trying to use that same little strategy so I don't keep y'all too long a man but y'all just bear with me I'm not gonna tell y'all for how long I said it but it's just a little something to kind of keep me on tasks and I feel like I can get my thoughts you know across a little bit better when I do that so just bear with me as I'm still kind of getting used to this technology but but here in in second Peter one has been our one of the theme scriptures and I got a couple of us that I want to read but here in second Peter 1 verse 3 says according as his divine power have given us given unto us all things that pertain them to life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this given all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and this is the one we'll be focusing on today temperance it says and knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity so if these things being you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful and the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather brethren give all diligence to make your calling and election sure but if you do these things you shall never fall let me just slip back over to Ephesians chapter 4 this is also a one of the like core scriptures as we're going through this journey a man and war strategies just so that we kind of get where we're pulling all these things together Ephesians 4 verse eleven a man says and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints this is the purpose for given ministry is to bring the Saints to a place of perfection all right for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry that's the continued administrator Lord Jesus Christ for the edifying of the body of Christ and verse 13 says till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ and this is our objective it's not just going to church but we're trying to be more like Jesus amen we want to be just like Jesus amen so the last verse that I'll read here is in 1st Samuel 23 a man first samuel 23 praise the Lord a man just bear with me here little reading and then we'll let you be seated afterward of prayer here in verse 1 says then they told David saying they'll hold the Philistines fight against Keela and they robbed the threshing floor so here the David is being told that the Philistines are robbing kealan robbing the threshing floors therefore David inquired of the Lord so he's praying about it a man saying shall I go and smite these Philistines and the Lord said unto David go and smite the Philistines and save Kela and David's name said unto Him behold we be afraid here in Judah how much more than if we come to Kela against the armies of the Philistines then David inquired of the Lord yet again the Lord answered again and said arise go down to Kela so he's prayed about it twice arise go down to Kela for our deliverer the Philistines into that hand so David and men went tequila and fought with the Philistines and brought away their cattle and smote them with a great slaughter so David saved the inhabitants of Keylong now watch this and it came to pass when a be a Abiathar the son of Himalaya fled - David - tequila that he came down with an e5 in his hand and it was told Saul that David was come tequila and Saul said God have to live it him into my hand so he is shut in by entering into a town that hath gates and bars and saw caught all the people together to war alright so here's a war a man getting ready to happen and it's all going against David alright and it was he says called all the people together into war to go down to Kela to besiege David and his men and David knew that Saul secretly practiced mischief against him and sent to abiathar the priest bring hither the ephod Oh mom then said David O Lord God of Israel thy servant have certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Kela to destroy the city for my sake will the men Aquila delivered me up into his hand will Saul come down as I serve and have heard Oh Lord God of Israel I beseech detailed our servant and the Lord said he will come down a man and look at this verse 12 then said David will the men of Kela deliver me and my man into the hand of Saul and the Lord said they will deliver thee up so we can see here in just 12 passages a man or 12 verses of scripture here in this one chapter David has sought the Lord three or four times prayer was a critical component a man for David and and what he was doing here during this time so let's just remember that amen as we go into this thought today let's pray father we thank you for your the ability to read the Word of God thank you for the the inspiration and direction and instruction that we can get from the Word of God as we prepare to endeavor upon the thought Lord hear war strategies as we talk about temperance a man and becoming a man more like Christ we pray that the Holy Spirit would anchor these things into us that God we would we would take what we hear we would apply it it won't just be another sermon but Lord it'd be something that we can apply to to make us more like you change us into your very image with your work God is our desire and our prayer it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen you can be seated praise the Lord so as we just again look at war strategies we're talking about temperance today a man we will open up just by reading a quote here from the Statue of a perfect man the Prophet makes some statements here about temperance and it says fourthly fourthly and you know and when we talk about such of hurt man we're talking about this chart here to my very right a man where Peter says that faith and virtue and knowledge and temperance and patience godliness brotherly kindness and then love or charity we're there towards the middle where it says temperance all right and and so let's let's look at this as fourthly we'll have to hurry because I just feel so good to stand here and talk about it a man says you have fourthly thank you it says at temperance oh my we've come to temperance now you've had faith first I have to have that to begin with then you add virtue to your faith if it's the right kind of virtue then you add knowledge and as we were talking about last week you've got to be a knowledge that can realize that the scripture does not contradict itself a man and there's many scriptures there that we could go through but we chose other Branum counter pointing out the one on baptism so we brought that out last week but but understand scripture never contradicts itself you got to see it completing Amen itself rather than contradicting itself it says you add knowledge if it's the right kind of knowledge now you're going to add 10 primps it says temperance doesn't mean stop drinking alcohol amen now that's not what tempers mean now but when you when you're when you are sanctified I'm talking about before you even feel what the Holy Ghost sanctification should take those things away amen it should take lust away it should take alcohol away I should take smoking away saint of sanctified life does not do that hallelujah amen once a person reaches sanctification those things that go but the Holy Ghost kind of come to give you strength so you can keep living that life amen listen he said teres doesn't mean stop drinking out here either no no temperance doesn't mean alcoholic cure not in this case this is Bible temperance he says holy spirit temperance that's just one of the lusts of the flesh so drinking alcohol smoking him and all they say that's a lust of the flesh and you got to overcome lust of the eye lust of the flesh and the pride of life say he said that's just one of the lusts of the flesh but we're talking about Holy Spirit temperance that means how to control your tongue Oh glory to God a man salutare by adding temperance we're talking about a person being able to control their tongue how to control your tongue not be a Tattler alright now this is these are this is good definition that the Prophet has given us not be a tally you shouldn't be in everybody's business and man you know what temperance would say no I don't need to get involved with that tippers were saying I'll not because the devil can bring it to you and if you're looking for you're gonna find it but you gotta have chippers Holy Ghost temperance that is saying no I want to be a part of that Holy Ghost tippers will say don't say that amen because you might get you might you might uh you might be persuaded to say something at a certain time amen and you know exactly who to say it to but Holy Ghost embers say no don't say that the Holy Ghost ever said no keep your mouth closed on that hallelujah you got to everybody got to be able to experience that hallelujah alright alright a man a man you never want to be known as a person that tattles babbles and talks all the time you never want to be known that way temperance is what helps you curb that alright glue and look he say he say uh I said that's just one of the flesh we're talking about Holy Spirit tempers that means how to control your tongue not be a tateleh how to control your temper not fly off every time anybody speaks crossed to you oh my all right it says boy a lot of us gotta fall off before we get started now I wanna I want to make sure we get this a lot of us gonna fall off before we get started aren't we see then we wonder why God is not in his church doing miracles and things that they used to do yes sir see hallelujah so this tip is that we're referring to amen it's how to control your tongue not be a Tattler amen how to control your temper and not fly off every time anybody speaks across to you amen and I sometimes you might get a little upset but not every time a man you're temperance has got to be there to stop you from getting upset every time and let me tell you something the devil gonna show test your temperance God gonna allow the devil to test your temperance he's gonna allow him to push certain buttons to see how you're gonna respond Oh glory to God hallelujah Church amen hey man let's go on to this court out of blasphemous names hallelujah Amen I III I like this I like this topic Amen war strategies temperance temperance temperance we all need it and he say boy a lot of us gonna fall off before we even get started so let's look at this a man let's look at this praise the Lord now this is out of blasphemous names a man he says our sister had a feet wet when she got to the bottom all of us knows sister Shepherd to be charitable her house is open her and a brother I don't care if it's a bum beg or whatever it is they'll feed him do anything they can to help him along Oh God accepted that her foundation part it says in here's now get this lesson say here's what's wrong eternal eternal Fitness here's what's wrong with the Branham tabernac you see there is two different kinds of faith he said there's two different kinds of virtue as I had it the other day two different kinds of knowledge two different kinds of temperance I love this hey man you know if lord help us to even just kind of bring that back out a little bit later on two different kinds of temperance he says one thinks it's prohibition they got that ain't the kind of temperance that God is talking about so you know trying to keep yourself from this and trying to keep it from that he'd say that ain't the tempers that God is talking about is that ungodly listen to these words that he used ungodly uncontrollable temper you got and things of that side fast back fuss so we talk about temperance is to notice the words you use on godly I got a quote up here that lets a temple a man come from Satan I don't know if I get a chance to read it all but tip I actually come from Satan it does not come from God so when you use an ungodly uncontrollable temper a man in a Christians house a wall should not be have a hole in it because somebody hit it now the Christians house I don't talk about Chris's house you got to repair the wall because you hit it hello somebody amen glory to God and then they just had something in the news just recently some guy got so upset he was in the dugout a man playing baseball something happened on the baseball field in and told the televisions up in the dugout right a temper I could not and when you see a man get that man you don't even want to be nowhere near him do you think the Holy Ghost want to be near when a person get like that hello somebody I know this good preaching anytime the church get that quiet it's got to be real good preacher the way we go somewhere October to tempo glory to God he color are currently uncontrollable come on somebody in in traffic what Jews get ready to do with that finger no you wouldn't I know you one thing about doing nothing with that finger you're gonna praise God's amen I know you were thinking about that ungodly uncontrollable and that came from the devil God didn't send that the devil sent there and we just flow right with it no no ungodly uncontrollable temper then when we say add tempera since what we got Lord when we see this thing rising that's that old nature eyes enough and like Lord we gotta we gotta crucify this fella Amen I don't need him to rise up no more I don't want nobody to see that and when you say when i'ma just go a little further with this thought on two different kinds of temperance you know because it's what we got one temperance when we're dealing with folk in the church then we got another temperance when we're dealing with people at the house hello somebody Amen I mean it's a different tempers we we can just put up with anything and everything with somebody to church but let it be a child or spouse or son we lose the temperance hello somebody two different kinds oh Jesus god help us here no don't y'all just stay with me long enough glory to God don't everybody get up and walk out it's a man stay with me today with war strategies we gonna give you something to overcome the devil all right let's just I'm starting to have you take that down so fast I'm going on in this a man a man he says patience and so forth there's a mockery of it pretend pretending to be a nature giving faith in nature giving virtue there's a nature giving temperance amen all these things are nature given and the biggest part of our faith is mental faith by hearing the word it brings us to a mental recognition of God but if this coming from above oh brother if it ever strikes this there is a godly spiritual faith then what does that thing do that faith recognize it's only the word no matter what anything else says it only recognizes the word because in a begin was the word and the word was with god and the word was god in the word is still god and the world was made flesh and dwelt among us and when the word itself is pouring into our faith our mental faith becomes a spiritual revelation listen and upon this foundation I build my church see not a part of mental conception of Church joining a mental conception of that but upon the revelation when the streams of grace has poured into that mental faith that you've got then upon this spiritual revelation I'll build my church and the gates of Hell can't prevail against that see that shows they would be against it but it will never prevail oh what a glorious thing now see faith these five streams and it goes on a little bit there some I want to go to just keep it just bear with me I want to just kind of set this this little foundation up even when it when he talked about he talked about he said a lot of us gonna fall off before we get started a lot of us gonna fall off before we get started I want to just kind of show you something about this temple now we hit this last week and I talked about Elijah right and how he'll I sure was calling for a minstrel hey man and I actually used minstrels last week but the Bible actually says minstrel he called for one amen but now brother Branham did come around another quote he says minstrels and he talked about how you know the minstrels have to kind of be together but he said buddy but in the scriptures minstrel men stroll alright he called for one minstrel one anointed person and and this statement here in the met and the message make the valley full of ditches let me just kind of read this and y'all just bear with me here I got a couple things I need to just share and we'll get we'll get to where we're going it says yes that this poor this poor fellow pour water on Elijah's hands yeah yeah he was he'd been in good company you said go go get him so they got on their charity and away they went and stood there before the prophet's house he come out and he looked at them kind of angry way man the Prophet looked at them kind of angry he looked all around he said wild I said jaebum why don't you go to your mother's profits back there to the idols of bail why don't you get down there to them and they said why don't you come to me he said if it wasn't that I respected the presence of Jehoshaphat I wouldn't even look at you now that's a man that's pretty upset I wouldn't even look at you right so so he says Connie got his dandruff up that preacher did you know they can do that say said I said I wouldn't even look at you but nevertheless bring me a mistress II got his temper all up so here this prophet Elijah is dealing with a temper it's - actually he had a pretty bad one Amen the prophet Elijah had a pretty bad word that when they begin to criticize his ballhead the little kids were gonna say go up bonehead go and when they begin to criticize his ball head he called for two she bears to come and destroy all these children oh my god his temper did that oh my brother branham said that when the Holy Ghost in him that one the Holy Ghost that his temper day that he saying say I got his temper she got his tip all up he had he had to get calmed down and what calmed his temper down was actually music anointed music you know people can Oh Lord can I just be honest with you you can be coming from the parking lot all your way to church them had an argument and the only thing that's gonna get you into the spirit of worship it's when somebody coming here and playing on it music otherwise you ain't got you you you might as well pick the devil has robbed you of one service when you allow that to happen praise the Lord glory to God the devil ride the church with you sometime amen I mean y'all could have talked about it no other time but that time huh but here here - devil bring that thing up and sometimes people thinking we're ain't ain't none but a simple conversation not knowing that the reaction was gonna be that way and the devil and got it got a 10 minute has destroyed everybody's immortan then you got to come here and get somebody with an anointed song that'll help your spirit get under control Elijah could not prophesy until he had good anointed music look at this now he says he says God he had to get calmed down now you people don't believe in music in the church what about that the minstrel begin to play in the spirit come on the prophecy if music helped bring the spirit on a prophet then it'll do the same thing tonight all right let me go on a little further now this is uh yeah I believe that you know what what controls the temperate temperance is actually when we're filled with the Spirit of God the spirit of God gives us a different spirit he said give you a new heart I'll give you a new spirit and then I'll put my spirit in the middle of that so God has to give you his spirit in order for you to be able to overcome your temperance and when you when you feel that thing rising up again that's when you got to go back in prayer we got to go back in prayer I got some quotes here brother Branham say to keep this thing if you want to overcome it you got to commit it in prayer amen glory to God not know great somebody nor to it oil no you committed in prayer you know that thing is in you so you're gonna have to commit it in prayer all right let's go on now this is a real good statement this is out of God's provided way and I had to read this from the reason I had to read this one is because the Prophet actually preached it right here in West Palm Beach so when I saw this I said Lord I got to read that so I guess this is God's provided way look at this he says now a righteous man I hope I can encourage y'all with this one a righteous man is not a sinless man so you know I went up what I'm trying to get to see someone's gonna make some mistakes but God in pushing us to the side because we blew our temple no way he wants you to do it just bring that temper back under control but a righteous man is not a sinless man listen he says for you notice that Elijah was a man subject to like passions as we are he had his ups and downs and he differences and the scripture of his life proves that he had ups and downs like we do and he had that he had his times of wandering and it's times that his temple got away from him I'll talk about the prophet Elijah he had times where his temple got away from him and he had a lot of things that went wrong but Oh glory but he was still a righteous man and I want to encourage you yet maybe sometime your temper has gotten I gotten away from you but you are still a righteous man and you are still a righteous woman hallelujah glory to God good thing kick you to the side because of that and then he actually just wants to chip that off of you listen but he was still a righteous man because he confessed his unworthiness and believed in God so that's what made him righteous we're not righteous within our own selves we're righteous through Jesus Christ I cannot be sanctified within myself I am sanctified through Jesus Christ who stands in the presence of God in my place it is that my holiness it is his holiness amen he says my holiness won't work at all but his does because God done accepted him and in accepting him he had to accept me oh praise God for that glory to God he had to accept me because I am in him amen that's what makes it real isn't it then we don't have to depend on ourselves no now that doesn't make us say we can see in brother if you see in you just away from God that's all there's only one thing to do is confess it and get right with God as long as you desire to sin the desire of sin still in your heart then it's time to stay down to the altar - that thing is taken out says now you will sin that's what the Prophet said now you will see him you're bound to sin because you just can't help it but not willful sin I noticed that it knows what he just said you will sing but not will sin will force it when you don't plan this thing how you don't plan it you know exactly what you was gonna do a man before you got it done hallelujah I know no snow folk you know needs to go to the confession booth and they they they axed for forgiveness for something before they did it they they paid for forgiveness God in looking at that type of stuff right God is not even accepting a prayer like that so it's not willful sin now you will make mistakes this is what he said you're gonna make mistakes sometimes your temper gonna get the best of you but remember you covered under his righteousness now that don't mean Amen to go out have just counted well I'm covered anyway so I might as well just let this one fly no you keep that one hello somebody hey man don't don't don't make grace of disgrace here that sense willfully after he received the knowledge of the truth there remains no more sacrifice for sin but every day you're bound to see my notice what he says in his next statement says you're bound to be backsliding constantly constantly so it takes a constant prayer to God that's why I was showing you how David in that 1 and 12 verses David prayed about full times in 12 verses every situation David prayed before he went down there to face the Philistines David prayed when he got down there in Keela now even here to rescue these people and then he hears that Saul is on the way to come in and have war with him and he had to pray that Lord where the people Aquila and I don't rescued them they should protect me but he said will the men of Keela deliver me into Saul's hands yes they are and then he goes they say now Lord oh it's all actually coming yes he is so so he constantly pray you gotta constantly pray in order to keep your temper under control hallelujah it takes a constant prayer to God listen Paul said I die daily listen and if Paul had to die daily how much more I'm going to man I'm gonna have to stay there and stay there dead all the time if Paul had to die daily to stay right with God and so we'll all have to do that just die out to ourself that's getting God's Way now there's only two ways of anything that's the right way in the wrong way and then ways are your ways and God's ways and you can't be in your way in God's Way at the same time you got to forget your own way to get in God's Way and you got to get out of your own way to get in God's Way for as long as you're in your own way you're out of his way listen so forsake your way forsake your thoughts forsake everything and just rely one thing on thus saith the Lord that's all then you know you're right now you know this temperance is it's something that you try it with all the time you can take that down you know you on your job you try it with it in school you try it with it I mean sometimes you can you can be in school at home you try it with it you can be in school and he say well you know I'm just I'm just having a hard time with this teach I'm gonna change classes in your chant classes and the next teacher you get actually works let me taste some if you if you if you go through a situation on your job hallelujah I know this happened to somebody recently you know they thought of real bad on one job said they got up and they left and they went to another job and actually got worse on the other job now I want to tell you some when you see that happening you're in your life that's because God is trying to perfect something in you and you can't run from it you can't run from it some time rather than complaining about it start thinking God for what's going on hallelujah you can't run from from one job to the next stop thinking things don't change you know why spirits don't die experience they will anoint somebody else and they'll come right against you again and you wonder where this came from it was God trying to do something in you spiritually this ain't got nothing to do with the people on the job he's got only it's got it's got it's got to do a one person that's in that building you God God only looking at one person in the building that's you so he allows these situations to occur in order to bring out his attributes in you you can't run from this as a Christian you can't run from this hallelujah Church so we gotta learn how to just praise God I told you last week put it in the bucket right I mean now it's one thing when God take you off the job you know when God has released you from a job amen sometimes sometimes we beat God to it and I just say now you're gonna take something somewhere if you don't want to take it there y'all y'all gonna hurt my story all the time I'll tell you about the man that had to carry a cross right and then he had a cross they say Lord this cross is just way too heavy I can't carry this thumb Oh God and he say it say it say okay you don't have to carry that one but you gotta at least carry one he said okay Lord he said I want you to bring that cross into this door and I want you to just lay it down in this room but you're gonna go through it another don't pick up another cross so he brought it in he later on said okay Lord praise the Lord and he went round through the other door and he said he looked at a big cross he said oh I don't know who got to carry that but I ain't touching that one they say that that's that just way too much scared there oh that ain't no way it kept looking any star there's real small cross in the corner they went running over to get that I said man I got me a cross Lord I got me one I'm a carry at Lord the Lord said that's the same cross you just put down see God know exactly what he doing right Amen don't try to outsmart God but sometimes God is trying to perfect these virtues in us so don't run from your trials hallelujah this ain't got nothin to do it whatever they name is this got everything to do with God getting something better out of you hallelujah amen he have to use your job sometime to get it he have to use what happens in the house sometime to get it right he has to use things that happened in school to get it he has to use your surroundings to get these things out of you praise the Lord search see now brother branham just told us in that last that Paul had to dive daily and you know in the first quote that I read out of the statute of perfect may he say a lot of us gonna fall off before we get started also just read how Elijah Elijah they had problems with a temper you know you can I can go through scripture King Uzziah died a leper because of his temper King Uzziah died a leper because of his temper right brother branham said Moses had a temple he threw down the Ten Commandments right God just finished writing them with the with the finger of his hand gives them to Moses and Moses takes them and he sees the people dancing around an idol God and Moses takes the tablets throws them down on the ground his temper did that Holly a prophet with a bad temper look at this now that not only that Moses are thrown out of ten commandments but when God told Moses to speak to the rock Moses went and struck the rock twice brother Brennan say it was his temper that did that oh my god and and when we get from this because he lost his temper Moses missed the opportunity of going to the promised land oh I hope we'll stay with that one because he couldn't get control of that temper he missed the opportunity of going to the promised land don't let your temper keep you out of a rapture all right looking look at this Paul had a temper a man he sought to arrest and kill all the Christians but he was chosen of God even though he had this temper problem now now now now the other thing we found out about Paul's that after he was converted after he received the Holy Ghost you didn't see those problems anymore this is why the Holy Ghost is very important for for all of us believers we must receive the baptism Holy Ghost and when we get it we gotta constantly actually refills because we see these things coming up in us all the time I want to just kind of read this a man because give me questions and answers glory to God brother branham even confessed to having a temper he had he had it he had he had a really really bad temper look at this before he got the holy ghost watch this they want someone when someone says evil about you say something do it I want to say that again when someone says evil about you say something good if you can't say something good about them then don't say nothing that's a good one that's a real good one amen if you can't say something good about them then don't say nothing just let it go see and then when you get to yourself pray for them prayer is the key if there's one thing in my life that's helped me to understand that the Holy Spirit came in to me down there that day has been that I was hot-headed that means I got a temper fiery Irish on both sides and I always could never eat hardly at all my mouth was all mass where where somebody mastered jumping up where I shouldn't jump up I've got some some of my teeth broke out now and feel where I spoke where I oughtn't to have spoke you see oh and said thanks always in trouble and said somebody said to me my teacher at school said lady I can't help it see I get in trouble all the time and I said I can't help it poor old mother temple she just wished the glory the other day and she said well look honey she got me up on her lap and she pulled me up in her arms and started crying first time I had ever had love like that from somebody an old woman she just cried over the top of me she said Billie I'm gonna do something for you honey I'm going to give you a little piece of string it said if any boy jumps on you oh my goodness I just love this state that this uh that this you know he said call me corn cracker because I was from Kentucky you know and I was really was terribly dressed and they make fun of my hair hanging pretty near as long as it is now and all down over my face and I was just having an awful time and you know and they would beat me around and slap me at any time anybody gets that tip up they walk around get a hold of me and slap me down so when they get upset they come hit him my car and snap me down and here I come and so then a fight and we got week week week we gave them I even had knife fights I'm talking about the profit I even had knife fights and everything else and took a Winchester rifle and tried to shoot him pump it right into four or five boys from beating me till I could hardly stand up would it would have killed every one of them if it hadn't been for God hallelujah amen picked up the shells off the ground put them back in the gun and they were just shooting as good as they they ever did see I've been been a mother of five men probably a fire boys now imma just just just hold on I want to make sure we get that brother Brandon what happened these boys was picking on them and as they you know as they're picking on him he decided you know he said if y'all let me if I go home I go home real fast boys I go home I won't come this way them oh and they say Oh Katie they let him up he went runnin home and he said the gun was hanging over the door and he went and grabbed the gun from off the door and he went right back and waited honey these men waiting for these little balls to walk now he was 12 years old 12 years old with a temper problem some of us bought with tempers all right 12 years old he and he got this gun and he just waited say they were laughing about how they beat him up and next thing you know one of the boys kind of stepped out and and and they were laughing so brother branham jumped out from behind the bush he say which one of you want to die first so you don't have to see the other ones dying he said he said oh no it aint funny no more he say all y'all gonna die right now and he starts shooting he starts he said I forget how many bullets he had but he starts shooting say every time he shot nothing would come out nothing would come out and the boss was running scattering everywhere crying like he say don't cry 9 all y'all gonna die and he did this because of a temper and it's so so when they start shooting try start shooting say none of the none of the bullets were gone the boys had scattered the bullets had fallen on the ground he picked one back up put it in the guy shoot up in the air that goes off oh my god God had to keep him from being a murderer because his temper would have hurt himself his temper would have hurt his ministry God had to keep him even when he had a temper let me tell you God been keeping some of us even with our bad tempers our golly uncontrollable tipples God has still been keeping us now that don't give us a manner a license to go and keep having bad tempers we need to bring that thing under control it's it comes from the devil praise God let me keep on going here hey man he says not now you know here let me let me I'm a skip down on a little bit this just put me at our paragraph 82 what what happened with this teacher Miss Temple she gave him the stream to counter so I said now anytime somebody hit you say I want you to toss nine knots time nine knots and and what that was to see Sara McGee some that helped control that temper tie these nine knots and watch what happened he say he got he took the string and somebody hit him soon as he got the string he got hit so I hit him and he took he took the string he tied the first night sitting through the string down and he started fighting all over again he said I can do this Amen in my own strength I can't I can't keep myself holy he don't need something stronger to keep up amen and if you can recognize that today Lord I can't do this in my own strength got on and tried and I keep failing over and over and over again I need more of you amen I need the baptism of the Holy Ghost praise God Church the Prophet came to that conclusion and this is what he says here in this paragraph he says he says actually go back up just one paragraph he says and I said I can never be a Christian keep it going sister and I said I could never write I get right there I could never be a Christian amen but let me tell you is that there go up just a little bit further okay I could never be a Christian he says but let me tell you that right down yonder on Ohio Avenue when the Holy Spirit came into me that settled the temple that was over I said I could never do it I could never be a Christian because I'd never get over that I said something that's born in me I said boy my daddy was hot-headed and my mother half Indian enough temper to find a bus song I said me boy anybody that jumps on me is gonna get it that's all I said if I have to climb up on a stepladder they hit them I said I'll sure do it this is pretty bad see he says but now you could drag me out there what some change but now you could drag me out there and wallow me and not see not me what am I trying to make a point here something happens that old power that old William Branham died and someone else come in and it makes me feel sorry for my enemy when anyone does anything wrong to me I never pray against them I pray for them that's where the Holy Spirit give that test the other night in New England before this happened out here when it gave when it gave power said just speak what you what you what you will tell them people the way he the way done and I figure down there I said I forgive you that's exactly what he wanted see forgive your enemy see there these are spirits that make you evil watch those spirits and what he's referring to is that church 190 preaching and these two young people come in a boyfriend and girlfriend they sit right on the front row and then just start kissing each other and brother and the Holy Spirit I warned brother Graham say I got it there's a trap set for you there's a test set a big test and he can understand what the test was and I say so he's sitting in the girl just boys are important girl just going out he said please stop it you in the house of God don't do that in the house of God and they just kept going got worse than where I said please stop you in the house of God and I'm no nobody could get this little couple to stop so finally the Holy Spirit say I put them in your hands what you're gonna do oh my god I want to tell you God God's saying the same thing in your situation whatever you facing right now there's some family it's been put in your hands what you're gonna do there's some friends that have been put in your hands what you're gonna do there's an old boss that has been put in your hands what you're gonna do so there's some co-workers been put in your hands what you're gonna do brother branham say the Holy Spirit say it said put him in your hands what you whatever you say it happened to him right now if you would have said you drop dead right now they would have dropped dead just like that but what he did when in resident rather than curse them he said I forgive you they say the Holy Spirit was pleased when he said I forgive you you know in order to forgive somebody they actually had to do something to you for you to Proctor for you to practice forgiveness somebody's gonna have to do something to you amen how you gonna test them out I forgive you ain't done nothing see you have to work through them emotions you have to work through them feelings you got to work through I mean that temper just kind of Rises and being able to kind of bring it back down it shows that a different person has come in the Holy Ghost is that person that has come in and made a change in your life whoa thank God for this a couple statements that the prophet mate and he was talking to his sister that was in a prayer line and and as she was coming through the prayer line he says you're awfully nervous aren't you he says you got a lot of temper that causes that nervousness the latest temper was causing her to be nervous they say temper temper comes from Satan and I'ma read that quote for you on a second temper comes from Satan and another statement that he makes they say don't fuss with others my god he says this don't these family fusses the profit actually say that don't have these family fusses as I said love breathe love and temper breeze temper he said when your mama a man come and tell you something and if your mama tell you I don't want you to go to that church and we say don't fuss with mama he say he say what you gotta just learn how to love mama right mama I okay I respect what you're saying uh you know I appreciate your care and concern for me mama I love you mom I'll be praying for you right learn how to not fuss with it but amen but you got to let your temper just because I just get tired of her saying it's not and I get tired of your temper you to God hallelujah say don't don't have family fusses glory to God look maybe some young boy wanna flex his muscles and he gotta let mom and daddy no no no no don't do that young man no no family fusses cuz temple gonna be temple amen you blowin up at me in my house you just fitted a tin my food and you blown up at me no temple it's tipping I gonna breathe love tip we're gonna breathe temple a man serve you if you watch your mouth and I can watch my mouth you understand hallelujah glory to God and then somebody got to get to the person say now I saw where this went last time we ain't going there no more amen you know soft answer always turns away wrath hallelujah and also the Bible said where there is no wood the fire ceases that means it stops if you don't add no word to it the fire go out praise the Lord somebody that's why the prophecy they say when when that new nature came in you can you can hit me you can kick me you can say this about me I won't respond you said cuz I'm an owl or I'll learn how to pray for my enemies god I want to get there Jesus you know the Prophet was in a place where people could not tell his enemies from his friends because they treated everybody the same people know your enemies you just you just you know we all we freeze up we do all kind of crazy things when we get random enemies we ain't talking no mo amen praise the Lord O some just changed yo your enemy the devil's your enemy your brothers and sisters not your enemy this sermon letting off the pressure I just want to read this oh I got just a couple things I just need to say it says but now he says even Christians is bothering them see see see some of them all pressured up and snap you off enough temple all built up like they're going to blow up what's the matter something wrong they shouldn't be temple comes from Satan everybody is under pressure though course I don't believe it believe it's this group here everybody's under pressure he says no but you you know these meetings are being taped so it'll go other places you see so I'll be I'll be speaking to that group that's under pressure now he's saying I don't believe it's a group that he's talking to he was in Wisconsin talking say I don't believe it's y'all but the meeting being tape is going somewhere now you know the Prophet know some people that group that had some temper problems but he also knew some people that wasn't in that group they had temper problems and they needed to hear this temper comes from Satan you know these meetings are being taped it'll go to other places see so I'll be speaking to that group that's under pressure but I thought you know that kind of bothers all groups pressure if Satan once can get you under pressure he's about got you whipped if Satan can get you under pressure he's about got you whipped you know you know you know when folks start smoking and drinking when they under pressure when I am the pressure that that's the first day they turn to is is a drink I smoke on it and God want you to turn to him rather putting that energy in a smoker drink put it in prayer right so he say Satan about gotcha whip that's right so much pressure people are doing things wrong and trying to hide from him well the only thing that does is build up more pressure it just builds up more pressure there's a question in questions and answers and this is the second quote on questions and answers I won't read the whole quote I'll just read just a portion of it here and then I'm gonna make a quick turn for you all this is a makes a statement somebody's accident question his brother branham when someone gets on me or steps on my toes this might be a good one says steps on my toes as the old saying is my temper rises how can I overcome this thing they said my temper rises how can I overcome this thing he says I know the Lord will have to do it but but what can I do in my heart I don't want this thing I want to anybody say I want this thing well I don't want this thing especially we come from the devil I don't want it this is his answer sweeten your temper with prayer it's a simple sweeten your temper with prayer I love that then make up your mind right after you sweeten with prayer make up your mind going back down that road no more now now now the reason I'm not gonna read the rest of that quote he's talking about them then boys are they almost shot and I just gave you all the story of that but now let me just go back because I read for you First Samuel 23 sweeten your temper with prayer I also want to try to bring out two different kinds of tips I want to break I bring it bring it from a different angle because the proper talked about prohibition but then he also talked about the ungodly uncontrollable temper now let's go back to the scripture right because when we look at a war strategy David was about to go to war he had just finished a battle a man for Kela they that God told him he prayed about it and he went down and he helped the frit help the brothers down and Kela David is not the King David is just a man a man that has a reputation because he's defeated Goliath right so if David comes he defeated Goliath people got confidence that somehow David gonna get us out of this - so David prays before he goes down tequila right God gives him instruction go to Kela and no way I'm gonna deliver the deliver the people who deliver the Phyllis time since he has down in Kela oh my god has a victory amen Darren Keela and while he's there he gets wind or he gets word that Saul is on his way to Kela to try to come and battle Satan I mean compact battle David now now what the property tells say it's kind of strange that you know David is not the king but look at the pressure look at the stress that he's under he's fighting the Philistines on one side and then he's running from Saul on the other side but God has saw him in the midst of his trial say he gonna be the next king and his woman be the next king why am I going through what I'm going through let me tell you something you might be trying to figure that out right now Lord if I'm your child why am I going through the things that I'm going through it's because God is trying to bring some character out of you is a victory I mean you gotta overcome something to get character right you can you gotta go through a trial amen and actually amen defeat that trial in order to gain character see before before God was gotta allow David them to give it be king I mean he's already anointed king but before you can go and take on the throne this did some character issues got to be worked out and God is using these trials and what they was doing is it's his commitment to prayer and I found out that that Saul is coming he comes back in he grabs a the father begins to pray and say Lord what should I do it with Adel it will well it saw them to come yes will the men of Kela deliver me into his hands yes so David takes six six hundred men and they leave Kela solids already gathered the men for war right and they leave Kela and they just matter they're sleeping in caves their only run from Saul and he's like suddenly people have appreciated me for delivering them from the Philistines no they're gonna actually Amen let they're gonna let fall no because Saul killed people that don't tell him where David is Saul is a mean fellows you want to know somebody with a real temple problem so Saul would throw daggers at you so a man saw Saul gets upset with his own boy because this boy is a friend of David's right so let's all is a really rough fella my god and it's an evil spirit that trouble song do you realize that it was a and then all the way you could get so calm down y'all wit me this morning is he had to have anointed music you know his musician was this my sex army song got an orchard musician so new David was a big help to him able to play that heart in them spiritually calm down I know that music will always calm down a spirit trouble get going in your house put on some of northern music put on the Word of God you'll see that devil come right now I said no that music rap music won't do that country music won't do that rock'n'roll won't do that but anointed music will change the atmosphere in the house David is here since harpus but even while you planned solace throwing javelins at David you can be doing something good can I get can I just say that way you can be doing something good and they'll still be throwing javelins at you and you know what you cannot take the javelin out the wall and throw it back the only thing you can do is dodge the javelin and then thank God you didn't get hit Wow David has finished at Keela and he's running from Kela because he's been told by gods that Saul is on the way now if we were to pick him up in and in and in first 724 David is hiding in caves running from song and I mean just day by day trying to get away from song he knows Saul is coming and he's doing everything and one scripture says all just stopped stopped chasing because he knew that David wasn't in Keela but one day while David I mean my song got in order to go look for David again David is up in a cave in the dark and so it walks into the same cave tired weary chasing something that he should have been chasing and he lives in decay and he lays in the cave and and David and one of his warriors cease all in the case and it's warriors say oh oh oh the day you've been praying for God has delivered your enemy into your hands right here in this tape David take come on David this is it you'll never have to worry about this problem anymore you can take him out right in the cave this is first seventy twenty four nobody'll ever know but me and you David and David takes the Swart and he just cuts a little defeat a little piece of his garment off Saul's garment that was Temperance that was temperance consider you know sometimes your enemy gonna be right there and you can say something I mean you gonna you don't you're gonna be in a spot where you can you but you've been saving this for a long time and you can finally give it to him but temperance say everything no no no no just just just no no and David Davis today David got convicted from just cutting a piece of the garment he sack came touch the water knowing it I can't do it I just I mean no no no no I can't I can't do that you can't kill you can't kill the Lord's anointed oh my let me uh oh Jesus yeah you can't you can't do it so David David David huh they were just dead David just take a little piece of his garment and saw wake up from his sleep and he walks out the cave and when he walks out the cave when he walks out the cave David follows him and he and when he follows him out he follow it falls on his knees bowser's face to the ground say Oh King live forever you thought a man with temperance his enemy was right there in his hand and he let her go say and and then so turn around and say is that to David say yeah it's me and say you know you can see by just this little piece of garment that I got the Lord puts you in my hands but I just couldn't take your life Saul say oh you much wiser than I am David he said he said you know what David come on back home I'm not gonna I'm not gonna mess with you no more I'm not gonna mess with you no more David you know you're free that spirit came right back on and and I think Saul wanted to free David okay can I just put it this way there's some people that actually don't want to treat you the way they treating you they don't want to do it I was talking to my wife too just the other day I mean I've gone through some trials with some with some of my jobs and and you know hit me with brotherbrother whisper said that you know as vessels of mercy and vessels around some people are designed by God to do the things that they do and some time when they come in against you God had to create that person with that ability to be able to do that because the average person that knows you would never treat you that way they just won't treat you that way they love you too much but there's an anointing that comes from the devil that they fall underneath that anointed and they have to do what they just did that's in order to get things out of you that God no he put there before the foundation in the world here David had a chance inside the cave the kill saw but he didn't remember that's taking about two kinds of temperance because that was first a mere 24 first 70 25 David has the opportunity to get some food he's out here in the fields and you know he the me hungry he's hungry he's you know he and and he finds out about this guy by the name of knee ball having sheeps here in time which means it was a great celebration it was a lot of food gonna be happening around that time and David David said now I showed them in and they bought some kindness we protected them from the enemy so maybe not why he's in abundance he'll give us something David said his men down there maybe when I got to do with David he's just a fugitive running from Saul you know he's a disobedient you know who we think he is I got none for and they both went on about his business David I told you two kind of differences you know why because David had tempers for Saul but when he heard about naval doing them like this his temper is one there see that one say sometime you treat the people in the church one way but you treat your family something different that's two different types of temperance you want Holy Ghost temperance where everybody is treated the same the way God would want you to treat him nabe all David say get them in young y'all get ready we going down hit an Eightball house and I'm gonna cut off everybody every male in this house we cutting them off knee--balls wife got a hold over Abigail she she's caught David before he came and she brought him some food and see she was a very wise woman and she stopped him from from summons from slaying innocent blood but where was his temperance where was his temperance she had it with Saul but it didn't have a Whitney ball and you know what right after the First Samuel 25 you go to first timber 26 Saul comes after David again this time Saul is in the inner valley and David goes down and takes his his sword God sent a deep sleep on the on Saul and his army and David goes down takes his Wars run up to the top of the mountain and calls back out of Saul and says there who got you swore I got it see he was able to exercise and when he was down there in the valley he had another warrior with him and this warrior say no I love the way to script to put he's saying David permit two strikes all cuz see they knew David couldn't do it I mean you you too weak David permit me to strike so hallelujah sometimes sometimes you ever made it maybe you won't say something bad about a person but you allow somebody else to say that and you just kind of sit there and just as guilty you just this guilt is there so what you should do is when you hear something stop that right there don't don't say another word about it and another thing you should have you prayed about it cuz I told you prayer is a thing that helps you conquer this can we stop and pray pray foot no no can't we stop afraid yeah let's pray and you pray for the president and you praying for the king king got no king right is you praying for all these other people but you ain't pray for the person that you got a problem with so when you actually say let's stop and pray bouncing no no no no no no no no no it interrupts them in their prayer no I'm we praying for the person that you had a problem with the one you're just talking about that's what we praying for and pray pray something pray that God bless them pray that gotta open up doors for pretty gotta provide in ways that go beyond the expectations I mean I mean really playful see David had another opportunity here this man say you know if you permit me he said we cannot touch God's annoying I love David's response not only am I'm not gonna touch him but I'm not gonna let none of y'all that's with me touch him he said you can't kill him you can't kill him you're gonna let God take care of him how low he gonna be in our way we don't know until God get us to the place that he want us to be how long I got to stay on this job I don't know until God gets you to the place where you want what he needs you to be and actually he might be using your life on that job for somebody you quit if you want to you quit if you want to you know what happened they end up getting hired at the new place you just went to start working then you'll know that this is from God let me just read a couple of things for you this is out of the message God's preparation so you sweat me is sweeten your temper with prayer sweeten your temper with prayer and this message out of God's preparation says one man one time by the name of David who could have killed his enemy God led him right up to the enemy and the man that was searching for his life and even his general said God has delivered him into your hands take his life and he cut the piece off of his coat went back up said god forbid that I touched his anointed that's right so don't say nothing evil about Christians don't try to harm Christians because you'll reap what you sow every time touch not my anointed do my prophets no harm for it was far better for you that you'd have a millstone tied at your neck and drown in the depths of the sea than to fill my anointed is that right so don't say nothing about Christians maybe some of them don't live just right or do just right but that's God's child let the father take care of his own kiddies you know if we go to fright and one another God give us both a whipping maybe see so Jeff I mean so let's let's just leave the other fellow alone and do what pray for him try to love him and correct him and maybe God will help him prayer is the key to overcome in temper the Bible says add to your knowledge temperance amen temperance a very very key ingredient for Christians hallelujah let me finish this a man with a couple other statements we want to be like Jesus I got a couple scriptures that I want to read to you that will go back to statue of a perfect man paragraph 223 and then I got a couple scriptures that I would just want to read to you we want to be like Jesus as believers we need the have some we got to have temperance we got to have temperance Christianity should look different from the world Christianity looks so so much different from the world can I offer a word of advice some go wrong in your life everybody on Facebook don't need to know somebody do you wrong everybody on Instagram don't need to know right that's not actually what you're trying to do is defame the other person right so what you have a lot to do just kind of keep some things to yourself something you just you just can't let folks know because it's gonna make the other person look bad oh my I mean I just figured let me leave that alone I mean put focused posts anything and everything I mean they had they had to preachers going at it over Facebook and Instagram why preacher accuse another preach of doing something and then this preacher got to get back on it and say look I'm sorry I mean I didn't mean it that way and they going back and forth in the whole world got to hear this why can't they come to Bible say if your brother offend you when you supposed to go to your brother come on Matthew 18 but we don't practice that no more temperance this justice statement he says at these things that temperance to it Oh temperance how to answer in kindness when wrath is spoke to you somebody said you bunch of holy rollers down there don't jump out and roll up your sleeves I was gonna have to put down my Christianity I got the wonder did you ever have it because Christianity like that we don't put it down and pick it up and no no no no we keep it up all the time right I don't know just about roll up your sleeves now say this and see not not that but talk with godly love oh my temperance kindness is that's the way you want to be when you when you round upon round not back let him Christ let him be your example he says when they said if thou be the Son of God turn these stones into bread he could have done it in show he was God but he had temperance when they called him Beelzebub he said I'll forgive you for it that's right they pull handfuls of his beard out of his face and spit in his face and said come down off the cross he said Father forgive them they they don't even know what they're doing now now you know I I know that there's some people there with their with their now you know you supposed to be able to forgive me no no no I realized that but now now now you supposed to not do that to make me forgive you so you have some wisdom - now amen glory since when he had the gift he knowed all things for in him was the fullness of the Godhead bodily they had seen him perform miracles by telling people what was wrong with them and so forth like that they put a rag around his head like that around his eyes and he and hit him on the head with a stick and said prophesy tell us who hit you will believe you will believe you see he had temperance now if you got it like that add it to your faith cuz I couldn't if somebody would put up a put a rag around my head and hit me in the head and say probably especially I had the ability to tell you who hit me how to point you out real quick and not only you hit me and I want God to get you right temperance won't do that temper just okay Lord deal out this trial to happen I accept it now if you got it like that if you gotta like to add it to your face if you still blow up and sass and fuss and stew and carry on uh-huh you ain't got it you ain't you came at that cuz it won't have C it won't vulcanized you couldn't take a piece of rubber you know and vulcanizer a piece of iron it just won't work no it's got to be flexible just like the rubber see and and when your faith and your temperance becomes the same kind of Holy Ghost temperance that he had Christ had then it will vocalize with him you're added to it when your virtue is like his virtue then it'll add to it let me just give you a couple scriptures as we bring this to a close Isaiah 53 and 7 we want to be like Jesus this is our whole focus we don't go to church just to go to church a man we're trying to be more like Jesus Christianity should bring us more a man like Christ hallelujah here these scriptures in isaiah 53:7 he was oppressed and he was afflicted and look at this yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before Shearer's is dumb so he openeth not his mouth there some things we're gonna go through and we can't open our mouth a man mark 14 verse 60 through 63 mark 14 verse 60 through 63 it says and the high priest stood up in the midst and asked Jesus saying answerest thou nothing what is what what is it which these witnesses which these witness against thee but he held its peace and answered nothing again the high priest asked him and said to him art thou the Christ the Son of the Blessed and Jesus said I am and he should see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of heaven then the high priest rent his clothes and said what need we any further witnesses here was standing before them on his way to cross to be crucified he answered nothing a man you know what some of the things we're going through in life it's a crucifixion to us we got a diet our sales data our thoughts data our ideas we're dying out to ourself we're becoming more and more like Jesus don't run from your problem run to your problem when it's working at the inside inside level let God do what God want to do in you 1st Peter chapter 2 1st Peter chapter 2 verse 20 for what glory is it if when you be buffing it and and what buffing it means is to strike repeatedly or violently now now you know you you some of y'all just went through a great trial last week on your job and you ready you ready to just kind of throw in the towel on him and say but but you're gonna go right back in and you're gonna be battered they're gonna hit you again this week they're gonna hit you again this week until God see that that thing don't affect you no more they're gonna keep allowing it to come to you when you stop complaining about it then got to deliver you from it Amen when you stop complaining about it then God will deliver you from it commit it to the Lord in prayer praying is not talking to everybody oh and they did this and they did you know what happens especially when you get a whole bunch of people working together you know you in the church it can happen you let one person say something but this happened between me and so on so you know what the person that you're told all of a sudden just just had a problem I mean the person they did nothing to them but now they got an offense and they take and now you know the person go straight ahead and they they get cold on them well what did I do to you and then you ever said that say well you ain't do nothing to me well why are you acting like that it ain't me it ain't me it's what you did this sword so how you know what I did that said you shouldn't even been privy to that and a good good reason why you should have been privy to it cuz you can't handle it look how you acted praise the Lord Church so that's why that's why you know you don't you don't do that you don't you don't create problems like that amen whether it's on the job whether it's in the church just just do what God sent in your direction and just talk just for me I got some things I'm going through this prefect well what is it if you're going through it see your tateleh you you do dig in you dig in you don't hop let's be specific how can I pray for you know just pray for me just pray for me that's all you need that's all you need well I know I mean I mean I need to know what I'm praying about well you want I don't want praying for me then it's temperance cuz you don't know you don't know how to hold stuff hey man and let me tell you another thing everybody don't need to know about what you're going through don't put all your trials out there everybody don't need to know that hey man let them hear the testimony after God bringing you through hey man but why are you going through they don't need to know about it because here's what happens if if you telling everybody what you're going through then they gonna look at you say now if I tell you what I'm going through then you're gonna tell everybody else what I'm going through alright if you tell about what you're going through then you'll also tell about what I'm going through and then what you do is you put yourself in a situation where nobody want to say nothing temperance knows how to hold things no no they don't need to know that no that's okay sometime I own the only person he didn't know is the pastor that's the only person that need to know don't don't let everybody know your business prays a lot alright I'm bringing it home for what glory is it if Wendy Buffett it for your faults you shall take it patiently now you don't did something to get in trouble right you can't say well god no no you you caused the problem and you actually got to deliver you from it no you go you'll make that thing right right but here the scriptures say well what glory is that when you be buffeted I mean that's struck repeatedly Amen for your false you shall take it patiently but if when you do well and suffer for it you take it patiently this is acceptable with God for even hero to where you call what that mean I'm gonna go through some things and I may have to take it patiently so here even here are two where you call because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that ye shall follow his steps if you're gonna call yourself a Christian you got to follow Christ who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth who when he was reviled reviled not again when he suffered when he suffered look at this look at this look at this look at this when he suffered he threatened not Christians can I talk about Christians oh what'd you say no had me go get my piece what are you talking about how you using language like that as a Christian the Bible say the Bible say when he was reviled reviled not again when he suffered he threatened not he threatened not but committed himself to him that judgeth judgeth righteously now you know what that mean I'm gonna commit this whole thing to you God what they did to me was wrong and how they handled this was wrong but you the one that judge righteously you know what I did god I'm gonna commit it to you I've tried it I've tried to go to people when I thought I was being wronged I went I went one time to a boss and I think you know man I just wish I had the opportunity just to sit down and talk to you you know just to tell you you know a few things breakfast brought that but I went and when I when I offered I said could you just you know let me have a meeting with you and man were not putting me on his schedule and I realized that they were working together one time I you know I had a situation and I went through them you know they tell you on the job if you have a dispute then you go through this process and you raise it up to this level your reason 11 you you know something I'm doing every time right now I'm a doctor and when I get to the levels and the Gauchos look they say and I had never seen this man treat me that way all the time you talking to me so nicely in the hall and how you doing today Jack and I this and they were like Walden's office how you know they did that how you know that what you're trying to say now why are you talking to me like this then I realize they all in cahoots together so I got to commit myself not to the process that the job got I gotta commit this to the one that judges righteously who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness by whose stripes you were healed we're talking about temperance cuz the Bible said add to your knowledge temperance and this is the type of temperance that God is looking for from us as it brings us to the stature of a perfect man perfect woman and Christ he told us in his word be perfect as I am perfect amen let's pray father God did these are challenges the word challenges us where we are as Christians what we want to be like you we want to live like you we want to express in our lives the way that you would explain it you did express why you here on earth you gave us an example it's not easy it's not easy to live this kind of life it's not it's very difficult but that's what Christianity is all about we stand out because of the lives that we live god help it not just to be words that go in one ear and out the other but Lord let it be something that really registers in our in our in our souls let it be something that changes from the inside we know what you're calling for we know what you're asking for help us Lord to do that areas where we fall short and and and certainly in what we can be righteous we could be the righteous people Lord because of your righteousness but realize that we fall short in some of these areas help us for it to commit these things in prayer that's how we overcome sweeten our spirits with prayer what advice we could receive from your prophet if we want to overcome these things Lord we must follow this advice bless us God bless us Lord to do what you have asked us to do how we need you God Jesus name we pray amen amen tell you the the Lord certainly has a way of just dealing with us right where we are he knows exactly what we need and when we need it and I pray that I pray that this this word that he's given us would be something that would help change us there was a statement
