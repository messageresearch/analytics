for each and every song a man it was a real blessing amen to the service of the Lord there was one exit you all remember sister Keisha Brown and prayer sister Brown called me this morning sister Keisha was an accident on yesterday with treasure her daughter and she's in the hospital right now and the doctors are contemplating maybe doing a surgery there on her on her knee I believe it is so we just want to remember his sister Kishin prayer amen on today that God would just touch her and a man and we believe that same God that touched sister Branham before the doctors hand could touch her body God had already taken care of things a man so we're gonna believe God for that a man I like you know moving around like this it's real they have thank God for a DJ free shade too retro this look real nice I like this god bless you I wanna I won't hold to have you standing too long I'll read a scripture you know I was listening to my mother's singing she made a comment there said I was just trying to get a thought for for the for the song I just couldn't couldn't get the thought and the Lord just put something in her heart and she comes something it was a blessing to us and I was just saying you know I want to have a Christmas thought and I just you know Lord just didn't give it to me like that and hey man we just gonna go what it gave me a he just put a few things in my heart and and some things that pertain to Christmas and some things that don't amen but there was a quote that brother branham say everyday should have been Christmas everything a man coz christmas is a time of worship right even a man Christmas is worship a man so we're gonna we're gonna talk a little bit about that but we just trust that the Lord would just help us a man today I want to read a man familiar passage for this time of year let's go to Matthew chapter 2 and let's read from there my man Matthew chapter 2 and man praise the Lord glory to God Matthew chapter 2 and a few verses and just the first 12 verses I believe here says now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the King behold there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem saying where is he that is born King of the Jews for we have seen his star in the east and I've come to worship him when Herod the King had heard these things he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him and when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together he demanded of them where Christ should be born and they said unto Him in Bethlehem of Judea for thus it is written by the prophet and thou bethlehem in the land of judah are not the least among the princes of Judah for out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule my people Israel then Herod when he had privily called the wise man inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared and he sent them to Bethlehem and said go and search diligently for the young child and when ye have found him bring me word again that my that I may come and worship Him also when they had heard the King they departed and lo the star which they saw and the East went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy and when they were come into the house they saw the young child with Mary his mother and fell down and worshiped him and when they had opened their treasures they presented unto Him gifts gold and frankincense and myrrh and being warned of God and a dream that they should not return to Herod they departed into their own country another way amen the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word let's just pray over what we've read god we thank you for what we've read here in the scripture and Lord certainly we are grateful to be able to come into the house and Lord today to bring our worship and our Isha to you and father we just pray that as we would just embark upon a little thought that you got would just get the glory and the honor out of the things that we would share and help us Lord just to receive what heaven has for us on this day we take every spirit that's against the Spirit of God underneath the control of the Holy Spirit even right now in Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you can be seated a man just a little little thought that we'll share today just remembering Christ this Christmas a man we're just remembering Christ this Christmas and before I go further I do want to also thank God for brother Jerry on Friday night and then just a beautiful thought on you are God's radiance amen you are God's radiance and just just really really appreciated that just he brought a a quote that I don't think I'm sure I heard it but just never looked at it you know that way and and and it just bless me and I pray that maybe today will get a chance to bring it back around and a man and just pick it up I want to just talk about remembering Christ amen this Christmas now I'm gonna say something but let's just read this first quote Matt and I now the Christmas is about it's well it's supposed to be about Jesus supposed to be by Jesus but we realized a man if you didn't know this I'll be the first to tell you that Jesus was not born on December 25th a man of our Lord and Savior was not born on December 25th hallelujah a man Jesus was born in the springtime being the Lamb of God amen all our lambs and things like that they come forth in spring so Jesus was born probably somewhere around April a man and so so we you know just just keep that in mind we got to tell the truth about it because we don't want our children to a man equate Jesus to Santa is that Alright a man Santa is a myth but Jesus is real all right hallelujah glory to God and unfortunately you know we we were quick to take our children and put them on the lap of a stranger take your picture - its Sam time and we we got all this kind of stuff that we pushing the kids out there to do but how quickly we to bring the kids to church [Music] all right and and and and and to introduce them to what this really is all about right this you know the one thing I can say about Christmas is that it forces everybody to stop and think about what this is hallelujah so I do appreciate that amen but but but but with truth be known amen truth be known Christmas or December 25th is not the birthday of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ all right let me just read something for you now I don't when I read this it meant I'm not gonna apologize for it but a man I just I just want this I want this to settle in your spirit okay this is from the patmans vision day man we want to remember Christ's a man of this Christmas the Prophet makes a statement says so Paul was picked up and got into that spirit of Sabbath and was transmitted by the Holy Ghost all the way over into the day of the Lord why we got Wars we got we why we got troubles why is nation against nation Jesus come the Prince of life and they killed him in a few weeks or even right now there's reindeers and Santa Clauses and jingle bells and all kinds of things hanging up which is pagan ceremony all right it says it's an article of the Catholic Church hallelujah people paying great prices hallelujah Amen people paying great prices and swapping presents and things like that pagan I just wanted to leave that in everybody laughs Christmas is a take of workshop amen hallelujah this bunch of prophets say it right they say they've been great prices swapping presses and you know what that is it's bacon Oh glory to God hey man I'm not gonna take your presents from you amen IIIi want you to enjoy yourself but but what I want to do is I want us to remember Christ amen because it's so easy to get wrapped up and caught up in this season hallelujah glory to God we amen we're not supposed to go in debt around this time of year that's not the will of God Jesus was not born for you to go in dead hello somebody that was not the purpose of the purse it's for you - amen to get swallowed up and dance MAME answers right now I'm not I mean the Prophet did receive gifts people bought suits for the Prophet and his wife but my Bible and all kind of things like that so we understand that we want to keep a balance in these things but but understand now if we if we if we don't strike the balance work in the father and all the pagan traditions come on church they may we'll follow a lot of bigoted racist conditions and we don't want to do that we're Christians hey man we're Christians so you know there's a statement that the Prophet made here he says Christmas is not mentioned in the entire Bible right never one time did Jesus refer them to his birth oh my but to his death Jesus didn't refer back to his birth he referred to his death hallelujah amen he said Christmas is a worship and he said I see the sign not long ago said put Christ back in to Christmas we want to remember Christ amen at at Christmas let me go on a little further here I want to read from this sermon when their eyes were open they knew him amen when they're high were open they knew him and I want to I gotta try to bring us a man of look look look look forward it's unfortunate that most of the world when they when they get to this time of year they think they they they bring out all of their all their stuff and they put it all over the place and you know which is fine they got the they got the scene of the manger in their yard and and and they got the wise men there which is not accurate if I can just tell you all that truth the scripture that I just read amen the wise men were not there at the time of his birth the wise men came years later if you if you if you if you just followed me in the scripture amen the wise men found him in the house not at the manger there were separates that came to a manger and even that was a man was four tamed of God he knew Herod would go to a manger right he knew he knew there was others that would go to a manger but since a shepherd is identified with things like that God could speak to shepherds they were humble people they were simple people that God could speak to when he announced his birth he went to simple people amen and when God is announcing things that he is doing today he is going to simple people praise God it's gonna take simple people to catch the revelation the Bible says that he has eat these things from the wise and the prudent and has revealed them unto babes such as would learn I want to say that many people have him past tense they have them past tense and in this morning they're even preaching of Jesus that's past tense Oh hallelujah and if I could just borrow the words of Paul they're preaching another Jesus hallelujah hey manna and this just coming in my spirit because I don't want to preach to you another Jesus I don't want to just talk about the Jesus that was in the manger he did he himself did not refer to his birth he referred to his death brother that's with many things that have happened since our Lord and Savior has come Oh glory to God let me just read a little bit here if I can I'm gonna try a man a man when their eyes were open they knew him hey and we need our eyes open today says would you like to take well would you like to took a trip with clear Cleopas and them on the road to emmaus I'd like to walk with them and it's possible I'm glad to be living today that I can still do the same thing walk with him today just the same as they did them saying the thought of it how how that Jesus has raised up from the dead but the sad part of it was slowing him who loved him didn't know it so he raised from the dead but sermon him that loved him didn't know it and he says and that's certainly a picture of today oh excuse me one second this keeps me on task so y'all just I've been on preached for three hours and then didn't realized so just let me let me get that it says so it says and that's certainly a picture of today there is many people who love Him who doesn't read doesn't yet realize that he's alive they love them they they think they put the the manger scene out amen they they they baby they are they that maybe they read the scriptures so about him but they don't realize that he's alive listen this is not something to be celebrated just one day a year glory to God that's why the prophets and a word Christmas is a worship and it should be something actually he said being that it is a worship it's actually not a celebration a May it's a worship now to celebrate he say you celebrate Lincoln's birthday he say you celebrate George Washington's birthday he made him celebrate the things that Martin Luther King made you can celebrate all that but when they come to Christ not a celebration worship Oh glory to God when those wise men showed up brother they weren't coming a man to play games they came to worship where is he King of the Jews where is he that can change my life where is he that to redeem me where is he that can save me where is he that can change me where is he and when you find them you know worship Him praise God Church glory hallelujah amen no they wanted to know where he loves it was it was it was it was you know so supernatural the way God did things Amen at that time it was so supernatural what God did and we will get him telling a little bit but let me let me say the course many people don't realize that he's still alive the preaching are talking about of Jesus amen that was in a manger but he's not there anymore he's not there anymore hallelujah that was that that I can't say that was the beginning of the story that was just part of the story and the story went all the way back in God's mind and things got things got started in heaven came down to the earth hallelujah Oh glory to God and this is why I said worship because we were so disconnected Adam sold us out in the Garden of Eden when theme came into the world through Adam and Eve and I'm not through not through I want to say Adam asar when they sold us out because Adam willfully did what he did Eve was deceived but I don't wilfully did what he did and he sold us out and what with what Adam did it required now a kid's me redeemer to come and bring us back into fellowship with Almighty God I got good news for you to team God did not just him his son God became the son and they came less not just to be born but to die and pay the penalty of sin that's why he didn't refer back to his birth it wasn't about that I had to be bored so I could die well if he hadn't come we wouldn't be able to come to church today if he hadn't done what he done we wouldn't be able to sit here and worship today right that's why we have to remember Christ hallelujah let me go on a little further here say there's certain people it's a certain certainly a picture of today there is many people who loves him who doesn't yet realized that he's alive that is some kind of a history that they have learned in some school it's come in some book of theology some ethics code of ethics that they studied somewhere and Jesus is a historical figure to them hallelujah amen I don't want him to be a historical figure to me no he the same yesterday today and forever we got to know he's still alive he's he's alive and well hallelujah doing what he always did here in this this this year we get ready to go to a new year Jesus is still alive glory amen yet in history it says and yet in the history they love him and don't realize that he's alive with us walking right around with us just as he always did he is here just the same as he ever was you know and as I read that quote it just kind of struck my heart people loved the story of Jesus but they don't love Jesus are you just like hearing the story and we can tell you the story but but that story was told in order to make an impact oh you Oh hallelujah oh you see those even the song that was chosen he could have let me drown but instead he took me here right he came to make a difference in your life the Bible Amen when it was announced that he was coming say he's gonna save his people from their sin Oh aricept so there's a statement in there he's gonna save his people from their sin can I just put a plane everybody not his people no he's coming to save his people from their sin even the Jews of that day y'all with me even the Jews of that day would not have been considered his people hallelujah you know Jesus was not a Jew Jesus was not a Jimtown Jesus was God so his people we can put it this way he came to save his predestinated people from their sins I'm so glad I can see I'm one of them when we remember Christ at this Christmas what we remembers that God some 2000 years ago gave birth to himself God came and took on the form of a man so that he could die for our sins sometimes it's good for you to just kind of go back and remember where you were if God had not come into your life hallelujah amen let's not read a little further in this this quote when their eyes were open they knew him he says now the reason they why didn't they believe it that statement just strikes me it strikes me this message that we have a soap freshest but uh in and all of it you got so many people that just won't believe it just just won't believe it they didn't believe Christ's birth they came up with well they're all kind of names are called Mary oh I just didn't let me just stay here for a little bit they they came up you know with you know what kind of woman are you you you are engaged to this man to be married and you turn up pregnant what kind of woman are you Mary I'm you can just imagine the criticism that she was going through the Bible even tells us that you know Joseph didn't really want to be associated with Mary a man with a testimony like that do you realize it took a supernatural car to count them to Joseph to sell his spirit if God would not have showed up through an angel in a dream to Joseph Sultan would have would have put Mary away amen by God using a supernatural experience with Joseph then Joseph could identify with the supernatural experience of Mary Mary had a testimony that she had been visited by an angel hallelujah somebody can you imagine going around and telling that testimony to people that I was visited by Gabriel and he told me that I was gonna have a child hallelujah church amen Mary had to walk by faith Mary had to stand against all the criticism Arrieta amen go against popular opinion mary had to endure whatever was gonna be thrown her way come on church hallelujah God needs some omaree's like that people that are willing to go through the criticism people that don't mind being a man being ostracized because you believe a message hallelujah people that don't lie being told that they crazy Oh God need some omaree's praise God leave without a willing to stand with the word Oh Mary had was a couple of scriptures but then scriptures was a lot to keep up [Applause] her experience had to match the scripture can we just go back a little bit I'm like i'ma get to this in the same but brother Branham gives us a man some some so he gives us information that we probably wouldn't get just by reading our Bibles oh I said a mouthful there brother Branham gives us some insight things that we win catch if we were just reading our Bibles myself hallelujah imma give you a couple of things I'm gonna try I'm trying my best to keep my thoughts together here but but you know one of the insights that the Prophet gave us is you know it wasn't only the wise men that sort of stuff you know one of the insights brother brayla brought he and he as he's preaching it and you know for me sometimes you don't know in the prophets intervention and preaching his vision do not even sure about that he might be preaching what he's seen brother branham's Oh Eve in the garden it could tell us what she looked like it's today's that it's that too I mean too hard for people to see how could Moses even write about the garden anyone even there see God gives a prophet insight that he doesn't give other people so brother Branham said that has Mary and Joseph for coming into the city Mary and Joseph saw this time not only did the wise men see the star but Mary and Joseph saw the stop what I'm trying to get you to see is a man there would be multiple people that'll be able to see the supernatural and they'll be able to identify and I might as well say this way because you have seen a star [Applause] because you can identify with the seven church age messenger which was a star in the hand of Jesus you have come to worship Him [Music] that's why a man that's why these brothers can come from Honduras and not just look for any church I'm not just looking for any church language I can identify with the spirit please God we have seen his star and we come to worship glory to God you know how easy it would be to just go to just go to a church right down the hall they they speak my language but I'm not here because you speak my language I'm here because you speak a higher language then my language you speak a heavenly language Oh glory to God glory to God glory to God so wasn't Jess you know the wise men sought but even even though Mary Joseph they sort of stopped said brother brain and say you know he was just kind of giving it a picture he said he just looked at say the mayor say Joseph do you see the star you see that sighs it's so I mean it's so different so unusual you see that stuff and and she just having conversation she makes her brother man saying maybe he can just hear say something like you know I'm so glad that he chose me he chose he chose my wool to conceal himself in and then reveal himself can I tell you something you all are like Mary he chose your spiritual wound to conceal himself and we are entering a season where he will also reveal himself now now now be careful because in the season where the revelation is coming forth that's also a season of persecution can I put it it's a season of great trial it's a season of great distress and the same time that he's manifesting himself you go through great trials and tribulations now we're not gonna run from this we're gonna accept everything God got for us but we understand this right let me go on a little further here you know we thank God for a prophet that gives us gives us this and you know these now nowadays people just don't have the complete picture but we want it we want to keep Christ we want to remember him a man at this at this season a man look at look at this and when their eyes were open they knew him lord help us Oh help our eyes to be open so we'll know you got look at this says now they the reason why they why didn't they believe it it's because the resurrection was too unusual the resurrection was too unusual that hadn't happened before since so it was an unusual thing for them to believe something like that we ain't nothing like this ever happened before it talked about the resurrection but also you know he goes on says and the unusualness is where God lays I'll stay with that church they are usual nests you know just because the crowd going with it don't mean God is with it and then the unusualness is where God God lays he says see Christ's birth was unusual if I could also just add the word incredible Christ's birth was incredible I mean I need prosthetists call timeout at this season it just reflect on what happened a virgin conceived and bore chopped now now now now in my mind if there was anything impossible that was absolutely impossible a virgin first of all cannot conceive virgin can do that right remember in this particular situation for us to be called Christians we have to believe the fact that a virgin can see can I go a little further you came even scientifically prove that I'm going somewhere with that you can't even scientifically prove that but yet you have to believe that that shows you that your faith in Christ is not built on scientific proof hallelujah faith is built on a simple belief that if God said it I will not question God's a God that can create the universe a God that can create the heavens in the earth God that can do whatever he wanted to I will not question him I got a I'm trying to just get into some things if I can but it was unusual it was unusual and for us to you know for us to place our faith amen on Mary story Mary's testimony not only the marriage testimony but you know we see Christ didn't come but but we also can see in Scripture why Mary why Mary based stuff faith somewhere she based her faith will will read that in a second let me finish this says that God is always unusual he does unusual things but it's always accordance his work I love this statement God is always unusual he does things unusual he does unusual things but as always according to his word my god ain't doing things outside of what the scripture promised a man listen he says he never does nothing outside of his word so unusual because he promised it he promises it first and then said somebody to manifest that word to make it real to the people now you hear he promises at first see he tells you that this is what I'm gonna do he touch exactly what he's gonna do and then it's up to you to catch it by Scripture and then once you catch it by Scripture you know that what God said was absolutely right Oh hallelujah stay with you stay with me stay with me amen he says when you better counsel people first receive the baptism the Holy Ghost that was an unusual thing but yet God promised it pour it out in the last days in here it was so no matter how unusual it was it was a promise of God that had to be made manifest because God promised it I like this I like this the promise a man was found for Mary for her - for her to hear the angel Gabriel come and say you know you're gonna have a son and you're gonna call his name Jesus you know and he's gonna save his people from their sins and you know and and say you know Mary Mary caught this this visit and she even had questions say how could this be I don't even know a man how could this be she was she had a good testimony I've never even known a man how can this be just say he say the Holy Spirit got over shouted you he said and you know what Mary said back to back to Gabriel which is the same thing that we need to say be it unto me according to your word not not even according to my doubt not according to anything that I say cuz sometimes I say the wrong things but be it unto me according to your word and do you know right there when she accepted the word Concepcion took place well Larry with this experience before Jesus even start kicking in the womb went to testify of what God had already done for her told Joseph told Elizabeth hallelujah you all know the store when she totally Lizabeth John had been dead in his mother's womb for for six months but as soon as soon as soon as Mary Cameron said I'm gonna have a child and his name will be Jesus as soon as she said her name Jesus child begins to leap in the womb and even the Bible say that John was filled with the Holy Ghost I wish that's all we had to do is come in here and say Jesus and everybody would be filled with the Holy Ghost please God I wish it was that like that to take Jesus in lives a change Jesus and situations are changed Jets a Jesus Oh glory to God I'm tired of fighting this thing Jesus tired of going through this series us [Applause] glory to God relevant our God became man things begin to change Oh hallelujah Mary only had a couple things after this experience she had to be able to take it back to the word or she only had a couple things that she could depend on just a couple her faith was in what was already written in the word and can I just a man bring it a little forward today your faith has got to be in what is already written in the word Mary could look at genesis 3:15 the Bible says and I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel we know amen just according to amen the way to bond a woman's body's designer a woman does not remember to see that's the main that produces that and then she has her act hallelujah amen but by here the Bible says her seed so this was a promise from Genesis that there would be a virgin that would conceive that's all Mary had to hold on to alone with another prophecy here let's read this side I said seven and fourteen all glory to God hallelujah hallelujah now God didn't change the prophecy he just gave a little bit more information for when we go forward and I'm saying seven fourteen it says therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive not just oh look at this and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel so any you know I'm brother you know brother branham toe said there were so many young ladies that took off at that time a man are claiming that they were pregnant that they were going to fulfill this promise be be careful with that be careful with that hallelujah one thing to speak by faith but it's another thing you know just to wait on God you know recently they had something happy where this lady telling everybody something and it didn't come to come to pass and when it didn't come to pass she she kind of lost her mind she lost her mind she killed her best friend and it took the baby from my best friend and claimed it as as hos right I mean people lose their mind and things like that so you got to be careful God God is God and let me put it this way if you believe in God for a child God will give you one you can stand on the same scriptures that I mean with Mary when he told Mary that she was gonna have much I said nothing will be impossible with God she said I can this ain't me nothing will be impossible god I want to tell you it whatever you believe it God for nothing will be impossible with God just hold to the Word of God they may he'll bring it to pass but here here Mary is holding on to these scriptures that all she got to go look at just a couple scriptures and now she got this testimony of a visitation from you know from from from Gabriel and you know just as so many things that are that are unusual about this let me just add something that I want to share there if I can just find it okay you know it's just so many things that's unusual but all she had was Amen what was descriptors in this experience oh my god and I want to just bring it forward because we know he's not in the manger back there you know the same way the stars and actually it's hard me know the same way two wise men saw a star and Mary and Joseph saw star brother branham say this star is something that all that that science is trying to make it very common science say this happens to every eight hundred years or so science try to make it very very common like nothing supernatural happened on that night but no he said he'd say that that star was very soup natural not if it was a very common event why was it that only very few people saw it if it was very common offense and then actually it was you know if I want to bring it forward to today when brother Brennan was born something happy with the Stars hallelujah now the preachers couldn't tell them that the preachers didn't know that just like Herod and those around Herod did not know what was going on in that time but the religious leaders today did not understand what was happening where God sent a prophet in this thing but a woman that watch saw a woman that that studied this she said I know the exact date you were born I know the exact day you were born she said I can tell you born on April 6 because the stars came together just like it did on the day Jesus was born now I'm just saying I'm not I'm not trying to put brother Branham in a higher place in Christ but I do want to understand you got to respect that God was using this ministry if I could just put it this week he's the same yesterday today forever and if we can see what he did what happened back then his birth then bring it all the way up to you know I'll just about hundreds o years from from where we are right now we can see he's the same but here we see you know all these stars are lined again and for me I got for me to believe about the stars aligning for brother Branham I had to be able to go back to the scripture and find what scriptures were pertaining to that ministry that's why I could believe Malachi 4 helps me believe revelation 10 7 helps me believe it st. Luke's 1730 helps me believe Oh glory to God let's just read a little bit more here oh my my God my God my God my God this was uh this is this is this is a blessing to me this is a blessing just something about the Stars God's gifts always find their places just a little something here that the Prophet makes a statement and and I just I just believe so many supernatural things that happen and I want to I want to try to hit and hit many of them but that's just about these stars it says notice now not two more days to Christmas one more day isn't it that that be to Monday Tuesday Christmas Eve Tuesday's Christmas Eve isn't it awful to see that this great holiday that we're approaching is approached in the manner that is approached in it's such a pitiful thing such a rational thing to think that rabbits in a myth cause Kris Kringle Santa Claus and everything has taken the realvalue away from Christmas from what Christmas is now we don't know and I certainly do not believe I was just coming down my wife back there coming down the road was listening at an astronomer that now they just fell on the idea which an astronomer told me many years ago when I was just a game warden here in Indiana nice talk about his experience that he had with that bat lady that was astronomy says when they told me that says how those stars came together just like that first astronomer did and in that form hundreds of years or something like that and and it reforms itself again Sarkis and Jupiter and I forget Mars no X wrong it some some of the stars how they how they speed when they cross their orbits in line of Earth and this astronomer to tonight was trying to tell that it actually was a natural thing they're trying to tell that it was a natural thing I don't accept that I like that I like that a man somebody might try to you know deduce this thing down to make it seem like it's very natural no a supernatural and Christ was born it was supernatural a man a man a man a man he says he says I don't accept it I believe it was a supernatural thing that God did God did he thing's a supernatural God he is supernatural he is supernatural I wanna just kind of talk there were so many unusual things that happen at the time his verse first thing is unusual a virgin is conceiving and bearing a child that's unusual but she's standing on the word as you know as she's confessing and telling rider what happened between her and an angel Gabriel she's just standing on that and she's telling the word even when she told Joseph all she could do was stand on the word hallelujah Joseph amen as he was thinking privately to put her away amen Joseph was visited by an angel through a dream that was also a man unusual supernet fear not take them to the Mary thy wife but that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost Joseph was visited by a man an angel visited in a dream and there he found comfort to be able to go forward with Mary as his wife Oh hallelujah I just believe that somebody gonna need a visitation from God in order to keep going with this word hallelujah if you if you I mean if you got some doubt God just like Joseph had some doubt if you got some doubt God is able to visit you hallelujah hey man hey man you know there was a brother one time has some doubt about the Prophet he went to Africa to speak and this brother say III I'm sorry he had he had a dream of some black brother branham smoking a cigarette and now we know the Prophet ain't never smoked no cigarette the angel told him not to touch those things right so he could even when he tried the angel pushed it you know I mean stopped it from happening so so he say he'd say even his daddy tried to get him some non-locking I'm not supposed to do that so here this ego so African his brother say he had a dream by a brother branham smoker seriously that's why you got to watch every dream and I ever dreamed me a man every dream in what you think it is alright so so here this man had a dream say he's saying I can't I can't get in touch even I can't I came fellowship with this meaning because this dream that I just had it I'm sorry brother branham as a man that's not right so so so the man was kind of moving away from the meeting and he was he was going back to where he was coming from and as he was going back he felt a hand come on his shoulder hallelujah brother quick we could come for a second just turn and face to face the audience he felt a hand just come on his shoulder like that and just I told him stop stop go back you know it's okay you can fellowship with him he just felt the hand like that going back to your seat brother and when he felt the hand he turned and he went back and he just began to talk to the Prophet and talk to different ones about his experiencing and he didn't realize this but when he got back to them the imprint of the hand was still on his back and then brother Branham had to break it down he said brother if you don't mind I want to show you something that imprint on your back the angel that visit at you that imprint on your back actually if you just let me put my hand on the imprint you will see that it fits my hand [Applause] confirming that God was with the Prophet say God God moved in a supernatural hallelujah but before you even call to believe in the supernatural God put scripture there since I might as well just see this because I'm this just this just in my spirit I'm saying it like this for a reason turn with me to this distant part I say is someone gonna be Chris oh I'm gonna be Christmas and so I'm not gonna be Christmas but every day Christmas 2nd Corinthians chapter 11 you know we we we are under attack spirits attacking everything and we don't realize that the spirits we got it we got to recognize the enemy and and for me for me you know I remember going to Jeffersonville and having the opportunity to see the prophets grave and I'm one that that believes that when you go to brother Bram's grave you go to Jeffersonville they have a little chain fence around the grave and the chain fence is there so that you don't go over the fence to get next to the grave right you can take a picture on the other side of the fence you ain't got to be up leaning up to on the grave you don't do all of that right but but the chain is there to keep you out of that area amen but you have people that'll just step right over and go lean up against the promise great you know one person did that in this video they're on YouTube they went to lean up and a dove flew out of the grief supernatural done right that should have said something but no they gonna smile and takes no you don't do that respect respect that right and while I was there you know just just just just at the green the Lord spoke something to my spirit he says says always respect my prophet always respect my prophet what did what he taught me says don't lift him too high respect my profits say don't lift them too high don't put them too low you got to walk in the middle of the road when you're dealing with the profit hallelujah hey man when you're dealing with God's you gotta walk in the middle of the road hallelujah so he told me that and and I've always done that I mean don't don't put him too high because he's not greeted in Christ he was a star in the hand of Christ but don't put him too low he was not just a good preacher he was a prophet of God hey man for feeling scripture this is what's in my spirit 2nd Corinthians 11 for I'm now forgive me for being all over the place but this just where my thoughts were for if he that cometh preaches another jesus whom we have not preached or if you receive another spirit which he have not received or another gospel which he have not accepted you might well bear with them now Paul is saying this and it just it just my spirit a man just began to be challenged why would Paul use words like this if he that cometh preaches another jesus think about this was there another Jesus on the earth doing the things that the Lord our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ was doing was there another man that could even compare to what Christ was doing I want to put it this way if there was another man like that we would have heard about we would have heard about him in there was a man compare it to this Jesus the Christ hallelujah glory to God see so as I look at that amen I think Amen they were preaching the same Jesus just preached them a different way Oh stay with me here you know back in Matthew when Jesus rose again you know it was the via the soldiers went to the Sadducees and the Pharisees and said you know he rose and the stone was rolled away and we don't know what happened you know they said what you need to do is come up with this story and we gonna solidify the story we gonna pay you to tell the story tell them that you were sleeping and the disciples came and took him away hallelujah they had a different gospel about Jesus they knew he was no longer in the grave but they had a different gospel can I go a little further I want to put it this way Paul knew that maybe they had Jesus in the wrong place in history maybe they didn't see that he had already come and was resurrected nodular maybe they was missing sir paul had already run into him on the road to Damascus so Paul had a new Amen Paul had a different revelation than what those Sadducees and Pharisees had even though they was looking at the same scriptures oh my god I want to go a little further because if they preach another Jesus you know there's a statement being made nowadays we just want to preach Jesus which Jesus which Jesus we talking about you know we just want to preach Jesus because I'm telling it while I'm preaching right now I'm preaching Jesus I'm preaching Jesus hallelujah but I'm bringing you forward I'm not just leaving them in the grave I'm not just leaving them in a manger Amen I'm sure you need the same yesterday today forever so so when when Paul is saying it's preaching another Jesus what is if they're not reaching the Jesus that is promised for this day they preaching another Jesus if they're not pretty l can I go a little further Jesus is the word Jesus is the word so if they not preaching the word for this day they're preaching another Jesus Oh hallelujah if you cannot see that Jesus sent a prophet for this thing you preaching another Jesus if you can't receive what he's done but this day if you can't see the Scriptures people feel for this day you're preaching another teeth see it's so easy to go talk about reindeer and what they got to do with Jesus what Santa Claus got to do with Jesus here's some about a man he he grows beard I had to look like Santa Claus why why can't people look like Jesus girls beard to look at look like Sam Kyle take care he'd do all kind of stuff that man get paid $200 an hour to act like Santa Claus you gotta pay nobody to be like Jesus no nothing I mean it's nothing it's all free and this just this is why we got to remember Christ at this time I'm trying to bring the attention back to him we want to see what he's doing today not what he did back then brothers brother Jerry brought us a quote you know the wise man saw the star and they followed and they got to Christ but brother Brandon brought out a statement he says you are the star you you the star then brother Jim rather quote to us on Friday night you and you're the star so so the question is this if wise men we're looking for for the Christ child back then and they follow the star to get to Christ who following you who's following you cuz you are the star now oh my I could have left away brother Brandon we know he's a star in the hand of Jesus but the Prophet said you are the star I read the code for you I read it I'll read it I read it who following you who's trying in let me just read it alright let me read the quote it'll help you it help you this is from great shining light yes great shining light all right paragraph 92 is that where I'm going to start let me just read this this would be a help to you you're the star you're the star you're the star hey man don't let nobody shake you off for off of this word and you know and I mean when when the stars align great things happen we can get all these stars in here line boy some great things that happen supernatural things happen when stars align I'm trying to get the stars to line and a man let's let's get our mind back on what it's really all about hallelujah and the only way we gonna live is by following a message the message was what came to help put us in line a man glory to God hallelujah great shining light he says this and we cannot be an ordinary we have to be unusual why y'all got to be so different we have to be unusual we cannot be usual because God's people are a peculiar people they've been through the ages so they've been through the ages they still gonna be peculiar today a man although peculiar yet the star was brilliant not brilliant in in world's educational world's affair but brilliant as sacrificed before the Lord we prostrate ourselves as the match eyes did in the presence of the King of Kings to reflect his light because I star on and reflects the light of the Sun and we reflect the light of the s om listen you're a star it's not the one that's born a Hollywood y'all they with we so interested and get my name on a star Hollywood but what what is that gonna do for everybody how's that gonna bring people to Jesus huh amen we want we want to reflect Christ in this day listen he says you're a star every Christian is a star to God the lost to God the weary the foot of the traveller to those who are seeking then the star cannot be guided by itself this is beautiful to me they may it must be led by the spirit it must reflect the brilliancy of God in its life to abstain from the things of the world that's how you reflect the brilliancy of God amen is by abstaining it has to be a decision that you make that I will not give my body to sin [Applause] hallelujah somebody you gotta come to that conclusion yourself I'm gonna live for God I'm gonna die for God I'm gonna worship God you know even Paul said I present if you got a present to give the Christ if you just got one present cuz he gave you something he gave me his life on the cross and now it's time for you to bring him a present bring your body I present my body a living sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God Paul said this is my reasonable reasonable service it's the least I can do the star cannot be guided by self it must be led by the Spirit must reflect a brilliancy of God in its life to abstain from the things of the world and to live godly and solely in the present life it must reflect the light of its great of its great one that shine what are we to do then - rise and shine the light of God to the dying and death darkness of this world we are to reflect and shine the presence of the Lord Jesus in his resurrecting power as he's as he is yesterday so see today to reflect him he goes on to say this but remember and this is a good thing when you realize your star you shining and and somebody should be following you to church just probably - and with the purpose what of your a little church because you're trying to bring them with Christ is a man listen what you do he'll say this cuz when you get them when when when the wise man found Christ the star left the star left when they got to Christ the star left no more star when they got to Christ hallelujah look at what the prophets saying this statement says but remember then the star again when it's finished its course it takes no honor when the star finishes its course it takes no honor the star just brought them into their destination and showed them that perfect life a man we're not taking any honor we just want to bring people to Christ hallelujah if we want to preach to them of Jesus that is the same yesterday today and forever Jesus that is still fulfilling his promise word that's what we want to present to them Oh glory to God all right I'm gonna stop right there on that particular quote I want to I got a couple other things I want to share and then a man we will uh we'll close off a man funded a church there were so many unusual things that happen during that time the Virgin being being able to conceive just through spoken word receiving the word at the that the angel spoke to her a man a virgin conceived and bore a child Joseph received a supernatural visitation from an angel - to take Mary his wife a man there was also a law that was enacted at that time had forced him to leave the situation that they was in Oh God law forced him to leave the situation they was in if I could just say it this way some of us is gonna take a act of God to force us to leave the situation we need oh y'all and catch that a man it's gonna take an act of God because you you comfortable when you are you enjoying where you are but God gonna do something just disrupt your environment that's that's a prophecy God gonna do something to disrupt your environment because you comfortable where you are and God got to do something to get you out of where you are and if you have to change the law lotta changed laws and cause you to leave where you are you'll be forced out of that situation you'll be forced to that circumstance and the reason you've been forced because God want to bring you where he wants you to be amen you cannot have Christ in Galilee you must have him and that's why I'm because that's where the promise said to

why you might have been blessed because you've been faithful in your times and there's a promise behind that there is a promise behind that the promises I will rebuke so when you stop paying your ties you have no covering that promise cannot be applied to you anymore god god no no no no thank god this is you you don't do it for long as you do your part hallelujah but there's a promise wrapped around that I rebuke the Devourer for your sake baby say I'll pour you out blessings where you have room not enough to receive and then he said if you don't do it he said you are cursed now think about that I'm trying to come back curse with the curse you realize this what's that you can get another portion of curses or you can get a double forces of blessings you make the choice new law forced in the leaf where they were to travel back to their homeland their birthplace shepherds were told ago these are supernatural unusual events that happened shepherds were told to go find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloth you know that's that that's not normal for a baby to be wrapped in swaddling cloth it would have been very normal a man to go to the hospital and find all these babies and then try to find the right one right but say no no i'ma do something unusual and then and then i'ma cause you to believe the unusual and you're gonna be brought today so you got to know as soon as you find this baby wrap that wrap them swallow cough this is the one this is the one that's gonna save their people from their sins this is the one that you want to come in worship hallelujah so shepherds were told to go find this baby what wrapped in a SWAT link loth a man and the wise men another unusual thing wise men following the supernatural star to get to where Christ was Church we got to just reflect on these events that happened is it's not about swapping presents but I Lord and Savior become in God Himself became a man to take our sins and nail him to a cross that's what Christmas is all about amen let's let's look at just a couple things here a couple more quotes told you that you a star God became flesh God became flesh let's look at this quote out of the deity of Jesus Christ the deity of him who is he some of them think him a little baby back there he's the one that that that stood on the invisible Oh my platform reached out his hand and spoke and said let there be light this is the one that we're talking about that was there said let there be light and there was light says that was Jesus Christ for he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world recognized him not he was and he's the deity of God look what he did back there talk about the miraculous back there you talk about shouting hey you know Joe where was that when the sons of God shouted for joy the Morningstar staying together amen I mean we used to start thinking about what happened it produces a shouting you since when he performed the miraculous things to make things which are now out of things which are not he spoke and it was so glory and the same that same Christ hallelujah let the fundamentalist let them people who deny the power of God say it's wrong hallelujah but that same power that spoke the world into existence is in those people that Scott the Holy Ghost that's right many women is time that we found out who you are the devil is trying to hide you back tell you that just some little trot down something can I say that the devil is a liar Amen you're not a man your son's in daughters of God the deity is not in heaven it's in room please come Romilly looking for in a manger but they won't find them there they looking for the God the Father menu because you the star DT is not in heaven and seeing you hallelujah I know you think I'm crazy but let me tell you something brother when you realize that Almighty God lives in you immortal life my life I give Zoe the life of God is in the human being it goes on and says this he says he stood he stood back there he's the creator of all things he made life frogs and all these ducks chickens animals created everything and nothing was made but was what was made by him who Christ a deity he brought down plagues and everything in the days of Egypt who Christ he stopped the mouths of lions he quits the violence of the fire they escape the edge of the sport they raised the dead from the grapefruit Christ oh my what would it be who is it Christ the deity I love this he says and brother sister that deities in you a little while and the world seeth me no more yea ye shall see me for I'll be with you even in you to the end of the age Christ in the manger no Christ in you hallelujah we're not worshiping Christ in the manger but Christ in you so if they still preaching Christ in the manger they're preaching another Jesus we got to find out what he's doing today and brother branham told us not Christ in the manger but Christ inside of you glory to cannot sail a man he said he says he says Christ in the manger but Christ no cry you we're not worshiping Christ in the manger but with Christ in you the Holy Ghost the hope of life hallelujah the Creator God Himself dwelling in the human being and does not yet appear what we shall be but will see him as he is four will be made like him no room for him now at the time of his birth there was no room in the end for our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ I want to ask you will you make room for him in this season in your heart see the stable that the manger the stable it was a place that nobody really wanted to go nobody wanted to go and sometimes we look at our hearts it kind of reminds us of the stable that's a place that you really don't want nobody to go you don't want nobody to know some of the things that don't happen in there hallelujah but God wants to come inside the midst of all your darkness and he wants to give you some light let's just reflect less reflect during this season let's remember Christ it's last quotas coming out of Smyrna in church age I want to read and brother Randleman made a statement just just imagine this Jehovah God and a manger crying like a baby can you imagine Jehovah that said let there be light that Saint Jehovah came down form the body he got in the body and start crying like a baby he says think of Jehovah playing as a boy think of jehovah having the same struggles that every teenager has and see the reason that he had to be tempted the same way you attempted is is because he can secure or he can help you through the things that you're going through he says think of think of him building a house out of the very timber that he created can you imagine that Jehovah with a hammer in his hand Jehovah with nails on his side oh can you imagine with with the ham in his hand and the nails in the side and building houses but when he's reaching down there getting him nails he says one of these days are you with me as he's reaching into a man to pick up a nail and and build a house he said one of these days I know where where is now gonna go I know what a hammer gonna do hallelujah he recognized was not bad but he didn't learn from it he he could he could have caused all nails to cease to exist all hammers to to disappear but no no no no he welcomed the hammer he welcomed the nails this is why he came to earth this was his purpose he wasn't focused focusing on the back he was focusing on the death to Jehovah I just love the way the Prophet prove it I want to read this I want to just to strike you and I want you to think about Lord and I'll save it as I read this out of Smyrna Church it says how striking it is born over a manure jehovah born in a manger of strong there is your everlasting sign to the proud and puffed up pseudo-intellectuals that have evolved their own theology denied the truth of God Jehovah God a crying baby in a stinking barn then we think we have a right to be proud holding up our noses criticize and then acted as though we were somebody here's your real sign this is the right one jehovah playing as a boy jehovah working in a carpenter's shop jehovah washing the feet of fishermen i would give you a sign said god not the style of a white-collar priesthood not a sign of wealth and power there's nothing in this time that you were wont or think suitable but it is an everlasting sign it is the greatest sign of all jehovah standing in the courtyard bruised and bleeding with thorns on his brow and spit on his face i'm talk about jehovah same God that created everything saying we talk about we can't go through nothing why me she over went through it all Harlan and didn't complain while he was going through listen a man says mocked and said it not jehovah despised and rejected can you imagine that to over despised and rejected hanging naked upon the cross while the hypocrites jeered and dared him to come down off the cross she Hova dying not just that just struck me a funeral for jehovah the very one that raised Lazarus from the grave when when the widow of nain came by touched a buyer in and in her boy came out jehovah at a funeral service can you imagine having it being one of the disciples that day of having to go to the funeral service you would be discouraged when you left the church jehovah died jehovah praying and nothing happening you get you you you ready to just give up on God because you're praying been hurried yet but jehovah prayed and nothing happened when he said he says when he was in the garden of garden of gethsemane praying let this cup pass Jehovah was praying nothing happening and he had to bring himself to a conclusion Lord not my will but thy will be done as an example to all of us that sometimes we gonna go through things like that in life Lord not my will but thy will be done g-hold are praying nothing happening now when you start going through that you don't prayed to God and seem like I'm not moving you just keep praising God then Jehovah died that is the sign for oh man now there isn't another like it it is the great one the darkness came upon the earth they put him in a tomb there he lay those three days and nights until an earthquake shattered the gloom of night and he came forth I like this Jehovah came forth Jehovah ascended on high dim Jehovah returned to end well his church so who's living on the inside of you Jay OVA deity is living there a man Jehovah came back with a mighty rushing wind and flames of fire Jehovah came back to walk in the midst of his church and empower his people once more Jehovah came and this time to stay in his people and again Jehovah heals the sick Jehovah raises the dead Jehovah manifests himself by the spirit Jehovah came back speaking in tongues and giving the answer back in interpretation Jehovah came down and he raised the prostitute to sin no more he came down to the drunkard with flat blows on his face and he lay unconscious in the gutter yes Jehovah came to manifest in flesh and I like this manifest through flesh well whose flesh whose pleasures are gonna manifest himself through deities in you Jehovah came to manifest in flesh and manifest through flesh Jehovah came God in us the hope of glory church christmas is a time where we should be reflecting on all of this it's not about all the other things that the pagans have made it and as believers as believers we got to be so careful that we don't get wrapped up in all the pagan traditions of it and I'm not trying to take Christmas from you if you know there's nothing wrong with you sharing at the present here and there but don't going dead over it don't go and dead over it and don't put pressure on people to buy you presents amen if you have a revelation of this you can go putting the pressure a little bit I know you're gonna get me something cuz I got you something no it don't work that way that's not what this is about where's Christ in the midst of all of that right so we got to keep on keep on as believers you know I believe God wants us to get closer and closer to him as the years a man go by one of the things brother Branham said is you know he says the children don't know about these things so don't don't deprive the children that's what he's saying he says that you got together put yourself on the level and understand that but some of us some of us ain't children no more praise the Lord it's time for us to grow up a little bit this this is not about what we've made it we got a we got to bring it back to a warship how can we worship God on Christmas Day I almost feel like I need to apologize for canceling service on Wednesday Christmas is a worship nobody nobody should be even better here like man no church on Wednesday praise God how do we get ourselves that we would we should have had a we we should have had a Christmas service planned for this church people should have been bringing the talents to the Lord on Christmas night right here that was the night should've been a night everybody should have sir bring you a poem bring you a song bring bring something bring something to worship the king that's what we really should be doing but we make it we missing the point Church
