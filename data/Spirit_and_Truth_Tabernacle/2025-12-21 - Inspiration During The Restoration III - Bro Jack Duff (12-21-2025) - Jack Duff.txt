You can grab your Bibles. I'll just make a few quick uh announcements. Um, I heard the prayer requests for uh Sister Boyd and I wanted to just u mention I sent the brothers a text. Sister Boyd is um I'm going to say she's one of the uh she is a she's evidence of the restoration. &gt;&gt; All right. when this season that God has brought us through our restore, sayith the Lord, Sister Boyd, we used to fellowship um back together years ago and and um so during this season, God has been bringing her right back and and um uh the enemy's attacking her her household. Uh she has a son, his name is Quincy, and uh she text me and said, "Quincy actually has to have a surgery this week." And you know, that's not easy right before Christmas. And you know, and um I mean, I hate to say it like this, but sometimes people can go to the hospital and get more sick, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Uh so um I'm, you know, I'm I'm actually headed right out of town. Soon as I leave the pull pit today, I'll greet you all and then I'll be jumping on a plane this afternoon headed to Ghana uh for some meetings. And I pray that you all pray for me. But I always really make my arrangements like this because I like being in church. And not only do I like being in church, I like being in church with y'all. There's nothing I like better than when God's children get together. It feels so good &gt;&gt; just being here again. But, uh, I asked the brothers, I put something out there, brothers, if you all wouldn't mind if you all would, um, if just a couple of you would go and just encourage Brother Quincy. Uh, Brother Quincy knows about this message. Uh, Brother Quincy, uh, was a really, really good singer back in the days. Uh, you know, and and but, uh, I believe he's also a part of the restoration. And so if since I can't go, if I can just get a few brothers to be an extension of Spirit and Truth Tabernacle and go and just pray over that brother either before his surgery or after his surgery. Let's just show him that we care about him. We love him. We're concerned. He's in Bethesda West. No, I'm sorry. Bethesda Memorial Hospital. I don't know if that's West or East, but I gave you all the contact information for sister board. can text her and just get the exact, you know, details. But just a few brothers, if y'all don't mind, uh, taking care of that, uh, for Spirit and Truth Tabernacle. Amen. Not not for brother Jack, but for Spirit and Truth Tabernacle. I would really appreciate it. Amen. We we thank God. Uh, all right. Um, I think that's all I need to mention. Brother Stanley, so good to see you. God bless you. Amen. And Cesaly is in the house. God bless you. She's one of the daughters of the house. Sister Michelle's oldest girl. Amen. She uh has moved away. Praise God. But we wait for the day for you to return. Amen. Amen. The porch light is always on. Praise God. All right. All right. All right. Let's Yes. Sister Gwena, where at? Well, praise. Oh my God bless you, Sister Gwenna. Good to have you. God, she come to see the granny's. Amen. Good to have. And and we we saw um uh her son Joey. Amen. On on on Friday night, he didn't want to sing no special. So uh but we thank God for Joey. Good to see you, brother. God bless you. Amen. Let us uh turn in our Bibles. Amen. Um to uh a passage here in Jeremiah, which is where we have been. And you all are fully aware of um the the location for the New Year's Eve service. They should have had that on. We announced that. Okay. Uh so we'll be looking forward to seeing everybody uh there. I I I I just when I heard that they were going to use their sanctuary, I'm like, "No, we got to have a New Year service. We got to." So, we we found this location and um um we'll have the building to oursel and I think it's just going to be a real blessing. Amen. So, we we we looking forward to it. All right. Um Jeremiah 29, I I'm going to start at verse 10 today. Um and we'll try to move a little faster into this thought. Uh it says here, "For thus sayeth the Lord that after 70 years be accomplished at Babylon, I will visit you and perform my good word toward you and causing you to return to this place. For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, sayeth the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you an expected end. And as I mentioned, this scripture is one of those life verses for Christians. I mean, it it it you know, anytime you're going through any trial, you you you have to be reminded that God knows the thoughts he has for you. No matter how hard that trial might be, God knows the thoughts he has for you. And the another scripture says that my thoughts are not like your thoughts and and my ways are so much higher than your ways. Sometimes we we can't comprehend and understand how God does the things that he does. But we have to resolve within ourselves that he is God &gt;&gt; and he's worthy &gt;&gt; in the good times &gt;&gt; and he's still worthy &gt;&gt; in the bad times. &gt;&gt; David said, "I will bless the Lord &gt;&gt; at all times." And David said his praise. &gt;&gt; His praise. His praise shall continually &gt;&gt; be in my mouth. &gt;&gt; And then he invited you to do something. Said, "Oh, magnify &gt;&gt; the Lord with me. Let us exalt his name together. Please let me read this scripture. &gt;&gt; Sometime know, you know, when you when you've been a Christian for a long time, you done read the Bible and you got, you know, some of this just in you. When you going through certain things, this what come up about you. &gt;&gt; It just come rising up at you. &gt;&gt; Boy, I praise him in the good times. I praise him in the bad time. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm going to praise him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But but this verse 11, it says, "For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, sayeth the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you an expected end. Then shall you call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I that's a promise. God going to hear your prayer." And and I'm tell probably some of the greatest words that a believer can hear is I heard your prayer. &gt;&gt; That mean the answer is is present. &gt;&gt; If I heard your prayer, the answer is present. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You done touched the heart of God. I heard your prayer. Now, thus sayith the Lord this and thus sayith the Lord that. I that's that's what that's what we long to hear. He says, I I I I then shall you call upon me. ye shall go and pray unto me and uh and I will hearken unto you and ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for me with all your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I will be found of you, sayaeth the Lord, and I will turn away your captivity. That's restoration. &gt;&gt; I will turn away your captivity and I will gather you from all the nations. That's restoration, right? Uh and it says uh and from all the places whether I have driven you sayeth the Lord and I will bring you again into the place where I caused you to be carried away captive. Restorations all over this says because ye have said the Lord hath raised us up prophets in Babylon. I I just like that. Let's pray. Father, we thank you for the word. Thank you for every promise that you have made to us because your promises are yay and amen. Uh we thank you, Father, for the saints that have gathered here on this blessed day. We trust, oh God, that you would minister to every heart and to every need. Thank you for the worship that has happened thus far, the specials, the the uh the encouraging words through a poem. God, we just appreciate everything that's happened. And now we come where we must hear the word of God. We pray father that the word would be applicable uh to where we are right now in our journey. We give you all the glory. We give you all the honor. We give you all the praise. It's in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Can be seated. Um our journey continues. Amen. In the subject of inspiration during the restoration. uh uh you know, as we've been working with this for the past couple um sermons that I preached, we um um we highlighted, you know, just verse uh 11 there in Jeremiah 29 and just, you know, what um uh a Google search would produce as far as uh when you, you know, you when you want to look at, okay, what are some of the devotions that are around this? And you know, they talked about being able to trust in God's timing, enduring through suffering and and being able to surrender control. All of that is in that verse. But the the higher uh view of this verse, if I could say, amen. Uh this verse was written at a time uh that Israel was in exile and they went into exile because of uh just some of the things that they allowed to happen, how they got themselves away from God. Uh so they ended up where God allowed them. I mean the land was blessed. God gave them this promised land. It was blessed and and and somehow they just just allowed themselves to to drift away from God. And uh when they when they drifted away from God, then God drifted away from them and he allowed the Babylonians to come in and take over their land. Carried them away into bapti captivity. Carried them away from I mean a land so far away from where they were. Many of them died there. But there were many great things that still happened in Babylon. Hallelujah. God can still move in Babylon. &gt;&gt; One of the things that God did in Babylon is that there were there was a man that decided that no matter what cuz he had a promise in the scripture that if he would just pray, &gt;&gt; right, that God would actually hear his prayer no matter where he was. So he would turn his face. He found out what direction he was in. And he turned his face towards the temple and he be to pray. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And uh and and and and one day, I mean, I don't know why the people so upset about him praying. Amen. But they got so upset about Daniel praying that they came up with a scheme that if anybody pray in the name of any other god outside of the name of the king at that time, he said they have to go into this lion's den. And the king thought that was a great thing, you know. So he signed the the the the the you know the little uh order, executive order, if I can put it that way. The king sign an executive order and uh and the king forgot. Hallelujah. Maybe the king had an ego problem. &gt;&gt; But the king forgot, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. Amen. that when they signed this order, there was one man that he loved that was going to be impacted. And as soon as it was signed, they went looking and scheming said, "Okay, we got it signed." So, now we're going to see if Daniel prayed. Daniel heard that the thing had been sign. And Daniel went to his house and and what we understand is that Daniel didn't shut the windows, but Daniel opened up the windows. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. I if if you want to see me pray, I'm going to be at the same place at the same time every day. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And Daniel went right back to that his prayer closet and he began to pray. Them boy them boys said, "We got him now." And they went down and told the king, say, "Look, we got him." He was praying in in the name of his God, and now it's time to put him in the lion's den. Well, in Babylon, Daniel went into that lion's den. But in Babylon, Daniel also came out &gt;&gt; of the lion's den. God can move &gt;&gt; in Babylon. &gt;&gt; The Hebrew boys were thrown in the fiery furnace down in Babylon. You know, and and I I don't know if I have time to get into some of these things because there were prophecies that Daniel actually spoke of the end time that happened down in Babylon. Hallelujah. Lord, I I would love to get into all that, but we'll we'll have to just go as far as we can today. We um we we read the scripture there where Jeremiah said in verse 15, "Because you said, the Lord have raised us up prophets in Babylon." Daniel was a prophet in Babylon. Ezra, the book of Ezra in the Bible, that was a prophet in Babylon. Nehemiah comes out of Babylon. Uh, Haggi, right, comes out of Babylon. Zachchariah comes out of Babylon. We're gonna hopefully hit a little bit of that today. And another one that I thought was very important was Malachi. We talked about that on last week. Amen. And we stopped at chapter 3 in Malachi because that's where God uh instructs us of how he wants us to handle our finances. It comes from a prophetic word that was released in the ex the post exile period when them coming out of Babylon. You got to understand when when I when I when I thought about that, you know, why would God actually put that scripture there when they're coming out because 70 years had got away and I can imagine the people got away from their tithing and offering. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I mean, where were where were they going to take the tithing to, &gt;&gt; right? I mean, there was no temple to go to, you know? I mean they were in they were in complete captivity. Can I can I put it this way? They were even in captivity in their finances. &gt;&gt; Right. So So God had to raise up a prophet and and the reason that God uses a prophet a prophets Amen. Uh uh primary responsibility is to bring you back to the word. &gt;&gt; So God raises the prophet Malachi and he says look I I challenge you to to prove God. bring your tithes and offerings to the storehouse. And he said, "Prove me now and and see when I open up the windows and pour you out blessings where you have room not enough to receive." He say, "I will rebuke the devourer for your sake if you would just just give me 10% of your income. &gt;&gt; You can keep the other 90%." I'm the outside of your offering now, &gt;&gt; but you can keep the rest of it, but just just give me that and see what I just blessed like you never imagined. &gt;&gt; And and look here, I'm a witness that God still does this. This this ain't just something that happened in the post exileic period. This still happens today. &gt;&gt; And and his blessings are still overtaking us today. &gt;&gt; Your my blessings are far too many to number. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But but but we we we we we we went there to Malachi. Amen. Chapter 3 on last week. But but but but you know, I'm a I'm a message believer. And uh and I and I love I love the message of the hour. I'm going just be honest with you. I love I love that God has allowed me to see Amen. some of the things that I see. I I'm glad that he opened up my understanding to the word of God. I I I love being a message believer. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. Amen. And and let me just let me just just drop this off real quick. Uh when we first started the church, Amen. Uh years ago, my wife had a friend of hers, her grandmother was a old Pentecostal. And she watched how things have changed in the Pentecostal church. And she told she said she told her her her her granddaughter, she said, "Tell tell Jack that whatever he start out preaching don't change." That was old old old time say she said whatever you start out preaching don't change she could say that because she saw the changes in the church. So so when she said that I took courage not and and I'm still preaching the same thing today that I was preaching back then &gt;&gt; and God has blessed the preaching. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So we we thank God for lives have been changed because of the preaching. So we thank God for that. But being a message believer, I can't stop at the tithes and offering in Malachi 3. &gt;&gt; There is more to the book of Malachi that we must discuss. &gt;&gt; Let us let us look at it. Amen. This morning, praise God. Let me let me let me let me So be before before I I uh Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's look at this. Let's Oh my before I before I hit Malachi, I'm going to I'm going to hit Malachi 4, but there was a a scripture Zechariah being a prophet uh also during this time and I I want to read something out of Zechariah and I want to read out out of out of Malachi. Uh let I tell you what, let's just go to Malachi. Let's read it. Malachi 4. Now again, post exileic scriptures. This is scriptures that are coming after um they have um they have they're coming back from bondage after 70 years. This is a time of restoration. And Malachi comes on the scene at this time and he he begins to prophesy. But Malachi's prophecy actually was a prophecy for our day. Now look at him in Malachi 4 verse one says, "Behold, the day cometh." And I just love this. This is the the uh the way that the Bible's written. This is the last book in the Old Testament because the Bible actually has, you know, the Old Testament, New Testament. This is the last book in the Old Testament and the last chapter in the Old Testament and the last verse in the Old Testament that speaks to our day. Malachi speaking of us. &gt;&gt; Look at this now. He says, "For behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yay, and all that do wickedly shall be stubble, and the day come and and the day that cometh shall burn them up, sayeth the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch. Evil's going to be done away with at some point in time." Hallelujah. says, "But unto you that fear my name, shall the son of righteousness rise with healing in his wings, and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall. And ye shall tread down the wicked, for they shall be ashes under the souls of your feet, in the day that I shall do this, saith the Lord of hosts." Now look at this. Remember ye the law of Moses, my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb, for all Israel, with the statutes and judgments. In verse 5, behold, I will send you Elijah. This is Malachi prophesying about an Elijah to come. Now look, he says, "Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet." Glory to God. before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. Now, now let's let's let's just let's process this. All right, the next verse says this. And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to the fathers, lest thou come and smite the earth with a curse. Now go back to the the verse five. Elijah is to come before the great and terrible day of the Lord, which is a day of judgment. &gt;&gt; Oh my God. My God. And see this that that's why it connects over to Daniel 70 weeks and all of that, but I don't have time to tie those things together today. But uh but but but we realize that uh Daniel when he prophesied, he said there'll be 70 weeks determined to the people. So there's a time uh that that God's going to end this whole thing up. And let me tell you, by the time Jesus started his ministry, 69 of the 70 weeks had already been completed. Hallelujah. It was Jesus that got cut off in the midst of the week, which was the last week that God promised Daniel before this thing comes to an end. Jesus ministry lasted three and a half years, which was the the middle of the last of the 70 weeks for Daniel that was prophesied in the scripture. Hallelujah. But but before all before God, amen, would bring destruction on the earth, what he says is that I'm going to send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day. Now, there are people that would say that this is John the Baptist, but John the Baptist did not come at the time of the great and dreadful day. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. It was a great day, but not a dreadful day. John the Baptist prophesied and his ministry happened, Amen. at the coming of a redeemer. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's not a dreadful day. Amen. That was a that was a big change for mankind. Had not had not Jesus come and did what he did, we'd all be in trouble. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, so this was not John the Baptist ministry. That's why when you look at verse six, it's very important that you catch it. Amen. There is two ministries spoken here in verse six. Now, both of them will have the ministry, Amen. or the spirit of Elijah. Hallelujah. But there's two different things happening. The first thing happening in verse six, he will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children. Now, that actually was John the Baptist ministry right there. Hallelujah. He turned the heart of the fathers to the children. But the the second part and John the Baptist did have the spirit of Elijah on him. But the second part is for our day. The and Amen. the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse. That is us. What does it mean to have your heart turned back to the Amen to to the heart of to the fathers? That simply means that our hearts will now turn right back to the word of God. &gt;&gt; And what is what what am I saying here? Because when you go to church today, you'll see people that do things that's not actually in the word of God anymore. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let let me just let me be, you know, I use this example all the time. Anytime you see somebody, especially a woman uh today that calls herself a bishop, &gt;&gt; that's out of the word of God. How do you know that? Because the Bible say that the bishop is supposed to be husband. &gt;&gt; Husband. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Husband is a is a masculine thing, &gt;&gt; right? I mean, only the man is the husband in a relationship. Oh my. &gt;&gt; I know we trying to reverse these roles. I don't care how much he taking care of the kids and she going out to work. His title is still husband. &gt;&gt; It's supposed to be &gt;&gt; husband. And there's responsibilities that go with the husband. &gt;&gt; My God. But the scripture actually say that the bishop is supposed to be husband of one wife. A woman cannot be husband. Unless it's a lesbian relationship, &gt;&gt; Am I preaching yet? &gt;&gt; A woman can't be husband unless it's a lesbian relationship. And spiritually, the church has gotten off into a spiritually lesbian relationship when they leave the word of God. All right. &gt;&gt; So when we say turn our hearts back to Amen the the the what the father said. We're going back to what was written in the scripture. No. Paul is not a woman hater. &gt;&gt; Not at all. &gt;&gt; We don't believe that. Ain't nobody going to sell us on that. These things were written for a purpose. God has a God has God has a reason. And let me tell you something. God know the thoughts that he have for you. &gt;&gt; They're not thoughts of bondage. They're actually thoughts of freedom. Yes, &gt;&gt; we talk about being free in the word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Everything we do, we can point it back to the word of God. Why y'all dress the way y'all dress? Let me show Let me read it to you out the Bible. &gt;&gt; Why y'all act the way y'all act? Let me read it to you out the Bible. That's turning your heart back to the word, not turning our heart towards popular opinion. &gt;&gt; No, our hearts are turned back to what the word of God says. And and and I don't do things just because brother Brandham said it. What brother Brandham said is what I see in scripture. And what he said was to actually get me back to looking at scripture. &gt;&gt; Is that all right? &gt;&gt; So here we got Amen. Um Malachi prophesying about our day. Now Zechariah also prophesies about our day. And and we're going to try to bring these two things together. what we just read out of Malachi and then we want to pick something up over in Zechariah chapter 4. Let's read let's read Zechariah 4. Actually, give me give me uh let me just read a quote here for you and then I I'll go to Zechariah 4. This is coming out of images of Christ. Praise the Lord. Oh my I love I love this message. I love I love the word, you know. Um, I I was just as I was looking at my notes here, my mind went down memory lane. And when we started off the beginning of the year with this this theme of overflow and I will restore, say the Lord, get back in step. When we start off the beginning of the year, uh, I took you all on a journey where I showed you multiple scriptures where God actually uh, was prophesying about brother Brandham's ministry. Look, we not we not following other brother Brandon because, you know, we ain't got nobody else to follow. No, we're following we're following Christ through the word. &gt;&gt; I mean, wait a minute. Okay. I mean, look look if if if if if they didn't receive John the Baptist because John was the actual one fulfilling turning the heart of the the the foster children, we we need to know who doing this. &gt;&gt; I mean, here here Malachi speak about it. Well, who's the one that's doing this? Right? Because this ain't just this ain't, you know, we not we're not just going to church just we going to church. We we we want to be in truth, right? So So if God say he going to do something, we want to know how this thing be fulfilled. So back in that day when John the Baptist came on the scene, he never really even identified himself as the one fulfilling it. They had to be able to read between the lines. And Jesus eventually told them, you know, he's already come and gone. But he say there will be another one that's going to come and restore all things. That was this whole restoration because brother Brandham's ministry was to restore the truth back to the people. All right, let's let's let's let's look at this. Let's look at this. In images of Christ, it says that's the only way we know God is to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit. It says that's oldfashioned. It's God's program. It's always been God's program. It's always will will be God's program. Not by power, not by might, but by my spirit, saith the Lord. And and and I want to I want to uh uh just kind of mention something because um and and and and and in the message because we're following this truth. I can just tell you right now, you won't have a lot of members &gt;&gt; in a message church unless you're overseas. Here in the states, because of the condition of the states, you won't have a lot of members in the message church because this is uh most people do not want to walk this tight. I'm just being honest. Most people do not want to come in line with the scripture like that. They they they just want enough church. &gt;&gt; Huh? To say I went. But to actually uh surrender to that word and let that change you from the inside out, they don't want all that, man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But that's what makes you like Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hey, and look, look, let me tell you something. Jesus didn't go partway to a cross. He went all the way to the cross. Had nails in both hands and in his feet. Jesus died on that cross. &gt;&gt; This was no half job. This was this was a full job. Not only did he die, but he rose again. &gt;&gt; He had to do the complete work. &gt;&gt; And then he said, "We got to take up our cross and we got to follow." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Taking up your cross mean I got to give up some things of the world. &gt;&gt; I got to give that up. Yes, you do. &gt;&gt; I got to give this up. I got to give that up. I got I got a sacrifice. And look, your sacrifice ain't nothing near his sacrifice. &gt;&gt; All right, church. &gt;&gt; But most of the time, you're going to find small groups gathering because people don't want to walk in the fullness of the word. But I can tell you this much. I can go anywhere in the world if I know that somebody they they just reach out to me say, "Yeah, brother. We we we we looking for someone to come and preach. We believe this message." And all I just got to talk to them just for a little bit. I can tell what they believe. And if I know that they got that that sold out uh uh uh commitment to God, it's very easy for me to go and just fellowship with them, brother, like I like I like I like I've always known them. You can go, we can go anywhere in the world and fellowship with people that that's that's on this because look, if you accept this and you walk in it, I know you got a you got a tight life. &gt;&gt; You got a tight life. &gt;&gt; I can trust a tight life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All right, let me let me let me go on. I'm trying to get there. Um, it's not by power, nor by might, but by my spirit, sayith the Lord. That's where it comes. And and let's look at this statement. Long long fellow once said this. The way to succeed is to find a worthy cause that's being talked about. A worthy cause that's being talked about and then hold on to it. Uh should something that's been talked about turned down by science is worthy, then hold on to it. Now, now before I go further, just scroll that back down. Uh I don't want to go ahead of them. Um, I I I I started thinking, well, what is a worthy cause? That's something that we should hold on to. And he gonna come and say something here about the gospel, but then it just hit me. This message is a worthy cause that we should hold on to. Something that's talked about. How do we know it's talked about? All you got to do is go on the internet and you just do a search with Google, put in William Brandham's name, and watch how much negative stuff will come out. And here's my my thing. I I I I I realize that what comes on Google, you don't even know whether it's true or not. &gt;&gt; Somebody else put that out there. So, you don't know whether that's true or not. They'll tell you it's a cult. It's a this is that. No, no, no. For me, I just read it in Malachi chapter 4 that God was going to send Elijah. And I'm saying William Brandom is the fulfillment of the second part of that. I say John the Baptist is the fulfillment of the first part of that. And if you don't agree with that, just tell me who he is. and let us work through it together &gt;&gt; because I'm looking for truth &gt;&gt; and if this is this then what we need to do is get deeper into it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And let it just change us. &gt;&gt; So this message is a worthy cause that we should hold on to. No, despite what anybody says, this is something that we should hold on to. Now look at what he says in his next paragraph. He says, "Do you know in 1872 the Medical Association of the United States turned down bathtubs. They said they are absolutely unsanitary and said they will scatter diseases." Bathtubs. Now, now, now, so in 1872, your parents were probably telling you to stay away from bathtubs. They probably had washed stuff. Now they talk they say a bathtub unsanitary. Now in my mama them day. Hallelujah. Uh some of y'all go back go when they might have had to uh or maybe their parents when they might have had to share. &gt;&gt; See y'all y'all heard y'all heard my my mother-in-law. &gt;&gt; Huh? They they they go back to them days where Yeah. You talk about unsanitary. &gt;&gt; They had to share bath water. And and and and and sometimes you wanted to be the first one to get in the water. &gt;&gt; And you had a big family, &gt;&gt; brother. They had to have some real salt back there. &gt;&gt; But by By the time you got in the water, the water was so dirty. &gt;&gt; And you talk about that that's a bathtub is unsanitary. No. What we did before bathtubs &gt;&gt; was unsanitary. &gt;&gt; Now, back in those days, because they probably believe what medical medical science was saying, don't get a bathtub. Don't get a bathtub. People probably avoid it. Now, we force you into I get in that bathtub, boy. Get in there and take a bath. things change over time. &gt;&gt; It says baptis, they finally come to it. Then he goes and says in this oldfashioned gospel that we're talking about, washed in the blood of the lamb, it may seem oldfashioned, but they'll have to come to it sooner or later. It's a worthy cause. Hold on to it with all you've got. It's a blood wash blood washed away. A blood washed away. It cleans a man up. not going out there drinking and smoking and riding around and calling themselves Christians. There it is, young people. Keep that one. There's a quote you can highlight and you can put in your uh uh on your table app so somebody asks you about drinking. Brother Brandham told us, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. Says not going out there drinking, smoking, and riding around and calling themselves Christians. &gt;&gt; Amen. Says because they belong to a church. It's that clean, unadulterated Holy Spirit in a human life that reflects Jesus Christ, the son of God. That's why people today reject the new birth. Oh, they got what they call the new birth. Now, when he say they got what they call a new birth, some people got it in their intellect. &gt;&gt; But when it come, it'll change the way you live. &gt;&gt; Let me go on. He says, he says, I went up shaking hands with the pastor, but that's not a birth of reason. They won't accept it. That's why they go to uh go to join churches because they can come in some intellectual way. God said except a man be born again, he cannot even see the kingdom of God. No matter how intellectual you may be or how good a Christian you claim to be, you got to be born again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let us go on here. I want to catch this. Zechariah 4. Malachi 4 connects to Zechariah 4 here. Zachchariah is one of the prophets that raised up uh during this time of the post exilelic period. Again, some inspiration during this um this restoration. These are just some of the different prophets that that that that that we have we've been able to to catch. Zechariah 4 says this, "And the angel talked with me uh uh talk with me, came again and walked and wake me as a man that is waken out of his sleep and said unto me, what seeest thou?" And I said, I have looked, behold, a candlestick of all gold with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps there upon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the the top thereof, and two olive trees by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof. Now, you know, when the prophets are prophesying, it seems all symbolic. Let me let me let me just drop this off. So, what you're reading here, Zachchariah is is is prophesying about something and it's symbolic. We we want to what what are these two olive trees? What's these two bowls? What's what's the one on the left side, the one on the right side? And if a prophet could write it, wouldn't it be sensible to believe that a prophet would also interpret it? So we don't have to sit here and wander around and let me let me also go go see we don't have to stumble around with theologians trying to interpret it. &gt;&gt; Amen. We can go straight to a prophet and get the interpretation of it. This is why we go back and say brother Brandham said because a prophet is bringing the interpretation of what I'm reading in the scripture. Now we have what we call clarity. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; And that's what we want. We want clarity. We don't want to stumble around in the darkness. We want to be able to see clearly. &gt;&gt; Let me just keep reading. Then I'll tell you what the prophet said about it. Watch this now. He says this. The two olive trees by it. One upon the right hand of the bowl and the other upon the left side thereof. So I answered and spake to the angel that talketh me, saying, "What are these, my Lord?" And the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, "Knowest thou not what these be?" And I said, "No, my lord." Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, "This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel." Now, now, now Zerubbabel, uh, if we were to, you know, we read about him last week, and that he was, his name, and and I'll read it again in a second. His name was found in Ezra chapter 5 verse one uh verse one and two. Zerubbabel was one of these guys that was a part of this post exile. So, so look at what he says now. He says um then he answered and said speak unto me saying this is what this is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayith the Lord of hosts. Now here's another life verse for believers. when you really going through something, I'm talking about uh maybe a financial crisis and you really need God to make a way. This is one of them scriptures that we come back to like Lord, you said not by might nor by power. I'm not just depending on my job. I thank you for my job, but I'm not just dependent on my job. &gt;&gt; I need something beyond my job. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And and sometimes, you know, you you can't even just depend on a group of people, &gt;&gt; right? I mean, like like when Gideon went down to fight in this battle, he had 300 going up against thousands. &gt;&gt; It was not by might nor by power, but by the spirit of the Lord that things get done. That way, God get all the glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Sometimes you find yourself in a situation that you need a not by might, not by power, but by my spirit. You know, cuz when the spirit of God move, it does supernatural things. This this what I'm talking about. God, God, send me a Cyrus. And and and and cuz cuz cuz what I I mean, I was just sitting there thinking, I heard brother Solomon mention that earlier, but you know, Cyrus actually came during the restoration. &gt;&gt; That's when Cyrus showed up. It was during the restoration. I'm carrying this inspiration right on to next year. &gt;&gt; I'm still in the restoration cuz I'm looking for a Cyrus. &gt;&gt; Now, now, now I'm going to tell you, there's going to be some seasons where God going to send you a Cyrus and there's going to be some seasons where God going to make you a Cyrus. &gt;&gt; But I will welcome both seasons. right now. Send me Osiris doing the restoration. I'm looking for my Cyrus. &gt;&gt; Oh my God. &gt;&gt; Look at this. Now look at this. It says um verse 7, who art thou, oh great mountain before Zerubbabel? Thou shalt become a plain. And and I don't want to just leave it at Zerubbabel. What What mountain is standing before us? &gt;&gt; Huh? You I'm I'm speaking to the mountain. &gt;&gt; Mountain you shall become a plain. &gt;&gt; That mean it's going to be easy for me to walk across this. &gt;&gt; When you walk in a mountain, it's a struggle. But no, when it becomes a plane, it's easy to walk across. &gt;&gt; The the mountain will become a plane. I don't care what your mountain is. The mountain be getting ready to be flattened, &gt;&gt; become flat land, &gt;&gt; Florida land. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Woo. &gt;&gt; Who art thou, oh great mountain, before Zerubbabel? Thou shalt become a plain, and he shall bring forth a headstone thereof, which shoutings, crying, grace, grace unto it. There's so much in here and I can't get it all today, but it's a lot in here, y'all. It says, "Moreover, the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, the hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house. His hands shall also finish it." Let me just pause there for a second. Go back to Ezra chapter 5, verse one and two. So he has to lay the foundation and also finish the building. Now watch this verse uh verse Ezra 5 because he was one of the prophets during this post-exic period says then the then the then the then the prophets Haggi the prophet and Zachchariah the son of Ido prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel even unto them. Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shelatiel and Jesua the son of Joedc and began to build the house. Now we just read how Zerubbabel was also uh uh he laid the foundation. And here we see Ezra tell us that Zerubbabel be to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem. And and and with them were the prophets of God helping them. And I just I love that. I love that. I I like seeing leaders that are involved. It's important. You know, Brother Random talked about two different types of leadership. He talked about um you know the the the the the the fire captains and one fire captain they had a fire blazing out of control and he put a big cigar in his mouth and he got there and he's telling the boys, you know, squirt a little water there and squirt a little water here and squirt a little water there. He just got a cigar that's puffing telling them where to squirt the water. He about to start another fire with that cigar, right? But squirt a little water here and squirt a little water there and the fire just burning out of control. It says, "But then there come another fireman." And it say another uh and and he's at this this this fire chief is not on the ground talking about squirt a little water here. He's at the top of the ladder. Amen. At the front of the ladder going into the fire and say, "Come on, boys. Let's put this fire out." He not on the ground. The man is in the fire. And God want leaders that'll get in the fire with the people. &gt;&gt; Brother, I don't want to be a leader that's telling people just squirt water here and squirt water there. I want to be in the fire. &gt;&gt; I want to be involved with the people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's two different types of leadership, &gt;&gt; right? But but here we see in scripture in Ezra, man, these guys these guys are prophets, but they're here laying the foundation. And so we pick it up in Zechariah. And Zechariah says in verse 9, "The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation." Amen. Of this house, his hands shall also finish it. Look at this. And thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts have sent me unto you. I I'm I'm I'm I'mma just I'mma just inject my own self in here. you know, was underneath um um Lord, I I was just recently talking to a brother and it just it just it just blessed me when I I'm I'm I'm getting off, but I I'll get back to it. It blessed me. I was talking to brother uh Tim when I went to visit him in Louisiana and um I was looking at how the Lord had just blessed their their their their church and and where they've come from and just what God has given them. G I think about 40 acres of property. They got a nice huge sanctuary. They got a gymnasium. And the reason that the gymnasium is on the property because brother Tim was uh on a uh he was called into court. Uh he had to be on the jury and there was a case was against a young lady that was going around to all the local gymnasiums and sweeping the getting all these little boys out the gymnasium, 12, 13, 14 year old boys. Oh yeah, I'll help you get a a scholarship and I'll help you do this and getting these boys to her house and then she is taking advantage of these boys when they get to her house. Well, they brought her up on charges for that. So, Brother Jim said, you know, our boys are going to those gyms. We need to have a gymnasium here that they ain't got to worry about stuff like that. So, on the 40 acres, they built a gymnasium. They built uh a a big fellowship hall. They built, you know, uh, if you want to do a outdoor fellowship, they put a big pavilion out there to do a fellowship. I mean, they just just property and things everywhere. He say, "Brother, everything been paid for by cash." I I I I I say, "Brother, I say, and brother Tim is in his 70s." I I say, "Brother, does it ever ever do you ever wonder why God would allow you to get all this now? I mean, your best years are, you know, back there, right? And and and he says, "Sit down, brother Jack. I need to tell you something." I said, "Okay." He said, he he says, "Brother, that's a good question." He says, "But here's the thing. The way all this started, it wasn't even me. It's the way God orchestrated all this to get all this started and everything that that happened. Even when my wife died, people gave me so much money that I could not use the money for myself. So, I put it back in the property." It says, "And what God showed me is that I'm not doing this for me. I'm doing this for the next generation." &gt;&gt; And all I'm saying is that you know what? God has allowed me to pastor this church and allowed us to be able to save a little money. And that that money to me is going to be the foundation of where we getting ready to go. &gt;&gt; But I don't believe God going to take me nowhere until it is finished. So Rubel was a part of the foundation and a part of the finishing. I'm claiming the same thing for me. &gt;&gt; Now, some of y'all need to catch all that. &gt;&gt; I'm the one gave money towards that building fund. I'm going to be part of the foundation. &gt;&gt; I'm going to see it built. I ain't going nowhere until it's built and I'm going to be part of the finishing. &gt;&gt; You got to claim your own. You got to claim it yourself. The the verse N say the hands of Zub Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house. His hands also shall finish it. And thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto you. For who hath despised the day of small things? I told y'all there is a lot in here. I can't I can't preach all this. Who hath despised the day of small things, spirit and truth. &gt;&gt; God saw you when you started in Lantana in the living room. And some of y'all come to the living room. Hallelujah. Boy, I can I can Lord, I'm trying to Lord have mercy. Jesus. Boy, I can't I can't Just forget about it. Some of y'all started in the living room in Lantana, my wife and three daughters. And um there we were in our living room having service for roughly a year. And I remember um I got up one one morning I I was speaking to the family and I and I told them I I I just it was a prophecy. I said, "Don't y'all be surprised if people start joining us?" And roughly three weeks later, uh I got a call from my mother-in-law. She was that morning she was preparing to go to church and she said, "Are y'all having church?" I said, "Yes, ma'am, we are." She said, "Can I come? I said, "Yes, ma'am. The church is open for you to come." And um and she she just she come she said, "I'll be right there." She come rushing down there from from Jock Road to get the Lantana. And she got there. But on the day that she came, uh Sister Dixon had already told me that she was going to make Spirit and Truth Tab Tabernacle her her church home. And we were meeting in our house. Sister Dixon is the first member of Spirit and Truth Tabernacle, right? But when she comes, she had her son, Brother Roy, bring her to church that day. And I set up chairs in the living room. We already used to have them already set up. Set up chairs in the living room. And we got three visitors on the first time we ever had visitors. Three. Why would God send three on the first time? Three is a number of perfection. I had three daughters and these three visitors that showed up which but what what would would have caused it to be seven of us. Well, is that right? Three daughters. No, eight of us. Eight of us, which eight eight is the number of a new beginning. Okay. So, some of you all when we say despise is not a day of small things. We started in that living room and then my mother-in-law uh one day she's driving down Lakeworth Road and she said, "You know, there's a building over here for rent." I say, "Uh, that I I said, "Okay, we'll go take a look at it." And um we went now the the you got to understand my living room is free. You get that? Are we clear on that? My My living room is free. So for me to take a step of faith and go out somewhere else right where I got to pay &gt;&gt; that that's faith. &gt;&gt; So we she said there's a building over here you know a plaza over here y'all can probably put a church said well we'll come take a look at it and I walked in I looked at that plaza I say ain't nothing we can do here. My wife said no we can do this we can do that we can she's a visionary when it come to things like that. So anytime I look at property, I always take my wife because she got a vision for stuff like that. And she tell me, she said, "You got to look in this. You got to look look in here and see nothing in this room and then what you can do with the room." I can't see nothing. God got to have a helpmate there to help you, right? So So I thank God for my precious wife, right? So she like a visionary and things like that. Oh yeah, I can do. And so she's starting. That's why if you if you went to that church, we used to have that that that crown molding or whatever it was. Not not crown. It was uh uh what do they call that thing? Chair chair chair rail. My wife want to come up with that. I'mma paint this color down here and I'm going to put this color. I mean it was looking nice and we was in there working on that building. While we working on the building, Sister Michelle called Sister Cobb say, "I need to bring you some work. I need to do this." She said, "Well, I'm out here in in in in Lake Worth doing this and doing that." Sister says sister Michelle said, "Y'all y'all got a building?" She said, "Yeah, we got we got we got a building. We're working on it and we we we getting ready to start meeting in here." And um she said, "Okay, I'm coming to bring bring the bring bring the bring bring the paperwork." Sister Michelle walked into that place. She saw the chair sit up and she just she just sat down and just let some words out of her mouth. She said, "I can see myself sitting right here." &gt;&gt; She had Let me tell you something. Before you can make a a a a transition, you got to see yourself already. &gt;&gt; She said, "I can see myself right here." And from that day to this day, &gt;&gt; with all her trials that she done went through, where she sitting at? And look, I'm I'm talking about the day. I'm talking about despised not the days of small things. &gt;&gt; See, some of some of these saints are what I call ride or die saints. &gt;&gt; Been been been with us for a long time. &gt;&gt; I remember her daughter uh Somaya when she would go to church, &gt;&gt; Somaya could not stop crying. But when she came into Spirit and Truth Tabernacle, you didn't see that no more. Now, some of that she grew up out of, but but she was still at the time she was doing all that crime, she was still in transition. I remember I remember I remember I remember going to Sister Tina house one time during during all this. I got so many testimonies, but I remember going to Sister Tina house and and uh and and and Shereice and Chenise and and Somaya and Cesley, all of them. They was with Mama and all us at Sister Tina House was something. Chenise looked at me and she just she just looked, "Are you the preacher in the church?" And I say, "Yes, I'm the preacher in the church." And Chenise, I'm still the preacher in the church. But I remember I remember I remember because at the time before Sister Michelle and Sister Tina made their decision to come and be a part of Spirit and Truth Tabernacle. I remember um uh we were going to some meetings in Georgia. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And and and I had a car that uh I I said y'all could take my car, you know, and and and and ride it up there. Y'all ain't got to rent no car. So they jumped in my car. Sister Michelle, Sister Tina, they jumped in the car and they they drove on up the road. But when they got in the car, all of a sudden there was a song on the radio and they thought I set them up, but I ain't set them up. It just happened to be that way. The song simply said this. It wasn't easy, but it was worth it. Let me tell you something. It's not easy to make a decision to come, but it's going to be worth it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It wasn't easy for for some of y'all to make that decision. &gt;&gt; But over these years, it's been worth it. &gt;&gt; It wasn't easy for me to make the decision to step out into ministry, but I can I thank God &gt;&gt; for coming to that decision. It's been worth it, y'all. &gt;&gt; I'm out here. Y'all got me way out here. Just this week, I was sharing with some some um some guys I play golf with and um telling them about, you know, just my calling into ministry. I had roughly seven different things happen to me in my life that that um helped me, you know, see that it was it was the hand of the Lord that was that was pulling me in this direction for ministry to start the church. One of those was uh I was one day I got off work early from work and I don't know know why but we were living right down the street in u the pines um it's a little development there for um town homes and the way that the pines are set up you have like a town home here a group of town homes there group of town homes here and a group of town homes here and then in the center center of it all is where you have the parking So, we lived back on this side and then there was an older lady lived up on this side and I happened to get home early this day and and as I was getting out of my car, I'm parking over here on my side and I get out get out of my car and that old lady she used to see me all the time and I just wave at him and say hi. But she she she says, "Young man, young man, that day she saw me, young man, young man." I say I said, "Yes, ma'am." I took off running over there to see you need anything. She said, "Young man, are you a minister?" I said, "No, ma'am, but I am a Christian." She looked at me. She said, "Wal in the house and left me standing there." Now, what would you do if somebody did you like that? Lord, why would you do me? I mean, what what is going on here? I don't even know the lady's name. She could barely speak English, but she asked me that question and and I I'll see her one day on the other side. Ma'am, I surrender to my calling. Thank you for ask answer asking that another uh situation. I'm only going to give you a couple, but it's it's seven that I could give you. Why God do seven completion? I'mma give you another one. I went to get my master's degree and my very first class and get my master's degree. Um the teacher that God gave me was a retired Lutheran minister and now he's teaching in college. So, you know, when he said that he was a retired Lutheran minister, I'm like, well, wow, this is really strange. uh my first my first uh class in in uh and get my master's degree. I got a a preacher that's my teacher. I said this is strange. So I and you know just let it go. So we had a three-week class. It was an introductory class and uh and I had to everybody had to present on a little subject you know uh he wanted to he wanted you at the end of three weeks you take five minutes and present you know before the people before the class. So, uh, you know, we had a little subject we had to talk about. So, we were finishing up a certain part of the class, getting ready to go to lunch. He says, "Do y'all want to do y'all presentations now or y'all want to do them later?" And I was so nervous. I'm like, "No, we got to do let's do it later. Let's do it later after lunch." And the rest of the class said, "No, we want to do it now." So, the majority won and we all had to do our presentations then. Everybody get up, do their presentations. Well, at the end of the presentation, he says, "Well, uh, if you'd like, I can give you all some feedback now, or I can do it after lunch." I say, "After lunch, after lunch, please. After lunch. I I don't want to hear this criticism coming my way cuz I know I just did terrible." He said, "So, the rest of the class said, "No, we want our criticism or feedback." Now, I said, "Oh, Lord, majority don't want again." He say so and so you did this and so and so you did that and so and so if you you know you you did this and you did that and and he say and Jack I say oh Lord here it come. He said Jack you are a natural information just flow out of your lips. I said what they said yeah you just seem like you was made for this. That's man as nervous as I was. &gt;&gt; He says, "Yeah." And I went to lunch. It's still kind of with a mind battle. I was expecting this man to kind of rake me over the coals, but he's encouraging me. And I'm like, "Wow, this is this is this this I don't I don't I don't see this." Well, in that same class that day, we're sitting there after lunch and there is a a gentleman. He was a ret he was a a captain in the Marines. His name was William Carr. And he says uh and I'm talking the same day, same class. William says, "Jack," I said, "Yes." He say, "Anybody ever tell you that you sound like a reverend?" I say, "Uh, come on, man." I said, "We here talking about business, you know." So, so, so another young lady was sitting there and she heard him say that. She said, "Yeah, when you up there talking, I ain't know whether to say amen or what." I say, I said, "Come on, y'all say." All right. Thank y'all. Appreciate that. I thought it was over. Um, William say Jack say, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. What's going on? He said, "How old are you?" I'm 33. Okay, Jack. There's three questions now. Three questions. Three times he calls my name now. And I ain't catch this till now. How many times did God call Samuel's name? Right. So this time he asked me his last question to me. How old was Jesus when he died? And I knew the answer to that question. Jesus had died at 33. Now he didn't have to say no more. I can read between the lines of what God is trying to tell me through this man. It was at that point in time that I had to die to my own thoughts. I had to die to whatever I was feeling and I had to surrender to what God wanted from me. That's how spirit and truth got started. And from that day to here, no, we not despising their small things. And we done moved from we moved from the living room to Green Acres on Lakeworth Road. Then we moved to Robuck Road. Yeah. Y'all know I don't even forgot all that. Then we moved to a school for four years. And now we back in Green Acres. Hallelujah. We must be close to something. We must be getting ready to strike a main spring somewhere here in Green Acres. Hallelujah, somebody. &gt;&gt; So, so, so, so I I I don't I don't I don't I don't despise the day of small things. I'm telling you, God has been good. And I can walk many of you all through your own testimonies of how you got here. &gt;&gt; Everybody got a testimony. And your testimony was not brother Jack called me and he uh he encouraged me. There's only one person in this church that I can say I pro uh procelitated. No, not my wife. God actually showed her God showed her dreams before we even got started. Oh Lord, I can take y'all back. I'm telling you, I can tell you God showed her dreams of of of she kept going to the closet and changing clothes. Kept going to the closet, changing clothes. And we didn't have we didn't we didn't know what what what what this meant. We just happened to look up something and say, "Well, you know, when you see that happening in your dreams, that mean God getting ready to change something in your life and that was changing us to ministry and we had to surrender to ministry, right?" And and she she I remember God giving her those dreams and and and she knew at that time because of all the changes that was going on around us, she knew that we had to make a make a change. She's like, she's like, "What we going to do? What we going to do?" I said, "We're going to start a church." She said, "What we going to name the church?" We said, "We going." I said, "The name of the church is Spirit and Truth Tabernacle." God had given me the name of the church two years before I even told my wife. I didn't tell nobody. I was still faithfully going to church and serving in my capacity as song leader and whatever else, whatever else before I did anything. Look, I didn't This ain't no overnight thing. This ain't overnight. This is This ain't something that rose up. Somebody had some idea and just jumped out there. No. No. That ain't that. That's not what this is. I had to struggle because when you struggle through something, you know what it does? It produces character. &gt;&gt; So, I thank God for the journey. &gt;&gt; But there's only one person that I prolighted. Quinton Jr. I actually went to him. We were we were in we were in um London visiting brother Gwena. Sister Gwenna happened to be here today. But we were in London. I told him and his sister, "Y'all ought to pray about coming to West Palm Beach." I'm still working on Sarah, but but Brother Quinton was there in in Georgia and he and he prayed about it and he's here and he has been a blessing ever since he's been here. But other than that, I ain't proited nobody. And and I and I also tell my tell the church, don't you procelite nobody. Let people come to their own decision. let them pray about it and decide what they want to do and let God bless them. I all I know is that it it wasn't easy, &gt;&gt; but it's been worth it. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm way way away from my notes, and ain't no sense of me trying to go back cuz I I I I I I I know what I wanted to say, and it'll take me a little time. So, that means I'm going to have to keep going. I'll pick it up somewhere along the line. Now, let me just mention this. We are we're we're we're changing a little bit next year. Um we've been on this journey of I will restore sayith the Lord and restoration is something that you can just never stop preaching. It it it keeps unfolding to me. It keeps unfolding. So you you probably still going to hear some sermons about restoration next year. I'm going tell you that. But the Lord has already laid on my heart to uh with a different inspiration. I'm telling you ahead of time. Usually I would save it for the first of the year. Uh but I'll go ahead and release it now as the least the inspiration you'll know because um it's connected to a lot of things. But the inspiration that God has given me for next year is um preparation for a manifestation. &gt;&gt; Preparation for a manifestation. Amen. Now, I'll just leave it there because there's going to be so much tied to that. Lord, let me get out of here. Um, I'll just finish reading Zechariah. That'll be the last thing I do, okay? Because I didn't finish it. But the hands of the Rubel have laid, verse 9, have laid the foundation of this house. His hand shall also finish it. And thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto you. For who have despised the day of small things? I'm telling y'all, I'm I'mma just tell y'all, Spirit and Truth Tabernacle, I appreciate you all. I love you all. I thank God for you all. Some of y'all was willing to jump on the wagon while we pushing it up the hill. But there's going to come a time that that wagon is going to go down the hill and it's when you going downhill ain't no pushing no more. &gt;&gt; It it's that's that's when it becomes a plane, sis. It's you're going down the hill and you know what happened when when things go down the hill? A lot of folk want to jump on. But I want to thank you for jumping on while we were pushing it up the hill. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And if you don't believe it's going to go downhill, watch and see. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you for not despising the days of small things. Thank you for coming to the house when we was in the house. Thank you for coming to the storefront on Lakew Worth Road. Thank you for coming to Robuck Road. Thank you for going to a school. &gt;&gt; Thank you for coming to a shared facility. You have not despised the days of small things. Thank you so much. See, this is why you can you can you can you can work with people and serve people that have that type of heart that are that are that'll join you like that. That's how it's so easy to be united as as one. Thank you. That's all I can say is thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate you all. I love you all. Thank you who have despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice and shall see the appointment in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven. They are the eyes of the Lord which run to and fro throughout the whole earth. Then answered I and said unto him, What are these two olive trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side thereof? And I answered again and said unto him, What be these two olive breaches uh which which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves? And he answered and said, "Knowest thou not what these be?" And I said, "No, my lord." Then said he, "The are these are the two anointed ones that stand by the Lord of the whole earth." Brother Random, you know, goes on to tell us, and I said a prophet would have to tell you what these things mean, but and I don't have time to read it all. I'm going just let it go, but I'll tell you this. Brother Random said, "Those two olive trees was the Old Testament and the New Testament." And uh he he he made a a a statement about um the way that that oil was was just um poured in. You know, it was a it was a candlestick that they were talking about there. And uh and the candlestick had the light at the top of it. It says, "But what happened the you never had to necessarily light the the the lamp on the top. You just pour oil into it and then the oil went up through the wicks and that's what brought the light." And the way that you kept the light burning is that you just kept pouring oil in. If you want to keep your lights burning, keep your fire burning bright and clear. Huh? Something like that. If you want to keep that fire burning out of control, we got to keep putting the oil inside the lamp. And the oil represent the Holy Ghost. Once you get the Holy Ghost, things change from the inside out. Church, God bless you. I'm done for the day. I have to just stop right there. You get up here sometime and you got your plan, but God be having another plan. Um, God knows all things. Let's pray. I had the musicians come. Amen. and um we'll prepare to just turn the service back over to brother Solomon. Father, we thank you, Lord Jesus, for just your word. And God, uh just this little trip down memory lane as I was reading the scripture, I I didn't see that didn't come to me like that. But Lord, you get here in the pull pit and and um you you begin to just take us on a journey. And and I just thank you, Father, for the journey. I thank you for every saint, every family, every person, God, that has been a part of this journey with us. My I appreciate them. I love them. I I care for them all. I'm grateful, Lord, that you have assigned us all together to work together for the cause of Christ. And I pray, Father, that you would just continue to anoint us. And and Lord, you you told us here in the word that we did not despise the day of small beginnings. You told us that we would rejoice. So, I'm looking for that, God, that uh you you you've seen our journey. You've seen where we've where we've come from. You also know where we're going. Why? Because you said in your word, I know the thoughts that I have towards you. I know these plans. I I already know that you might not know it, but I know it. God, all you ask us to do is just keep walking by faith and not by sight. And Lord, as we press, God, you'll bring us right to where we need to be. So, Father, I just pray your blessings upon uh each family. I pray your blessings upon each person. Bless them during this holiday season. May you keep us, Lord. Bless our families as we gather together with uh loved ones. Thank you for the different ones that have come, Father. And we got many that are traveling, Lord. Sister Tina being away there. And we know that uh Sister Rachel is reaching that point, Father, where patience will come. We ask that you watch over Sister Rachel. God, um, Brother Steven, you know how important this is to them. We just thank you for bringing it this far in the in the pregnancy and and we believe, Lord, that it will it will come to a conclusion and, Father, patience will be on the other side. So, Father, we pray, Lord, that you would just look upon her and as me and my wife, daughter, uh, Brother Quinton, God, we'll be traveling. Just bless our our journey as we're away. And give me strength for the journey, you know, all that's in front of me, oh God. So, give me strength for the journey, God. Look upon uh, sister boy that she sent out a text in her household and especially brother Quincy as he's preparing for surgery. God, I pray that you would look upon him and that you would touch him. And Lord, even may this be a time that restoration would come to him as well. Lord, we uh we trust, oh God, that you would just get glory and you would get honor out of all that we say and all that we do. It's in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. The Lord richly bless you, church. I want to wish you all a a merry Christmas. Uh I will see you before the new year. So, I'll we'll give you the happy new year greetings then, but we'll wish you a merry Christmas. Amen. Those that'll be traveling, may God give you traveling mercies. Amen. And um those that will be here, um church will still be going on, things are already arranged for you to be fed on next week. And I believe you will be fed. Amen. God bless you. We love you. We thank God for you. Amen. I'll turn the service to brother Solomon. Hallelujah. Will you stand to your feet with me? When I remember what the Lord has done, I will never go back anymore.

Say when I Oh, when I remember what the Lord has done, I will never go back anymore. When I say when I remember what the Lord has done, I will never go back anymore. Come on, help me say no. No, no. Oh, say no. No, no, no, no, no. I will never go back anymore. Say, oh no, no, no, no, no, no. I will never go back anymore. Say, "Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I will never." No. Say no. No. No. No. No. No. No. I will never go back anymore. Praise. Praise the Lord. Let's Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let's bow our heads. Almighty God, Father, we thank you for your truth. We thank you, Lord Jesus, that you changed our pastor sermon, Lord, just to remind us not to despise the days of small things. We can all look back in our lives, Lord, and saw how you brought us from there to where we are. how you changed the course of our lives, Lord, when we were going the wrong way, Father. How you brought us to this faith, Lord Jesus. Father, we want to tell you thank you, Lord. Thank you for loving us so much, Lord God, that as you were making preparations for us. You were preparing a pastor, Lord Jesus, that will feed us, Lord. You you brought them through different trials and tests, Lord, to be the right kind of pastor that we need. And father, we're grateful for that. We're we're so grateful for the balance, Lord Jesus. And it's hard for people to stay balanced. We've seen it throughout the message where people would go off on a limb and Lord, so many would go into fanaticism, Lord, but to to remain balanced, Lord Jesus. We're so grateful for that. And Father, we're grateful, Lord, for this place that you've given us to worship in. And Lord, I know it's not our home, Lord Jesus. was just seeing a few weeks ago when brother Quu was preaching. Lord, how he had to skip over these notes and these scriptures and these quotes. Lord, we need the time, Lord, to worship you, Lord, the way that you deserve to be worshiped. Lord, we don't want to just sing one song at the end, Lord God. We want to water, Lord, the word that we've heard, Lord, that it may bring forth much fruit. So, Father, we know, Lord God, that you have a place for us to worship and we're looking for that time. But until that time comes, Lord, we want to remain faithful, Lord Jesus. Standing at our post of duty, Lord, pushing this thing up the hill, Lord Jesus. Lord, for there's coming a time, Lord, when the momentum is going to carry us, Lord Jesus. So, Father, we pray, Lord God, again, for our pastor. Give him the strength that he needs, Lord, that he he gave out this morning. But give him the strength, Lord, Lord, to go and be all that you would have him to need be in Ghana. Lord, be with the saints, each one. Bless your people, Lord, as we prepare to leave this place. Lord, bring us all back at the appointed time. Lord, we'll be careful to give you the praise, the honor, and glory. It's in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you saints. Our brothers to come at this time and dismiss you. The Lord has done. I will never go back anymore. When I when I remember
