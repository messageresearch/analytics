there's much you know that could be said and I'm sure that many you know we'll have a lot of things to say but but I will say this God remembers your kindness to the brides God remembers your kindness to the bride and there was a time not many people even noticed my first time probably was sharing it with you one of the family home going services that I had to preach and I can't remember exactly whether it was whether it was mother Tillman or if it was brother Brown I'm not not sure but I remember after the service I was just at the house with the family and my brother Darrell walked up and shook my hand but when he shook my hand he had something in his hand shaking my hand and I just said I just appreciate you just gave it to him and just moved on didn't say a word and I never said a word just said thank you but I'll tell you what God remembers that and that what you do unto the least of these my little ones you've done unto me so search I'm encouraged and I like to say that brother Darrell got drafted you got drafted a man we just thank the Lord keep the family in prayer we'll get information to you as Morris release they talked about they gave sister Laura I mean

compassion to them during this time so we'll give you more information as though as a days approach and not just accident everyone just try to make yourself available a mess that we can do all we can

that went forth this morning of sister wisdom sister Charisse sister burrs a man God richly bless you I didn't I was trying to get out there too I had it planned to go to Okeechobee let the Lord changed you know things yesterday so I wasn't able to make it any of the sinks and notice the birds man any other sects make it out alright praise the Lord glad y'all was able to make it did y'all enjoy yourself alright well that's good good to hear we got one more tonight a man at the combined services a man that brother West goes and will be looking forward to that after pinnacle Palms and you know but but but please or let's let's do all we can just to also provide our support to the family a man during this time I want to read a couple scriptures just a little something that the Lord at placed in my heart I've been dealing with this doubt for a little bit and and I've just a couple things that happened this week and you know I felt that it was necessary for me to kind of go down this path and and going this way just kind of re-establishing troops we already know these things some of the things that I'll speak on this morning but it's just reiterating and reestablished these things and and for those that may have not heard it may be would be something that would you know just kind of help you along the journey and I know that there are people that I listen to you know us on the radio as well as on the internet and we just want to bring truth to people that's that's what the whole objective is you know I mean because if you know the truth the truth will make you free a man if the truth that does dance a man you can jump and shout but even got no truth you're not gonna be anchored that devil will bun rush you beat you down right so but we we need to be established in truth and and and so this morning we will be bringing out some things like I say most of you will be familiar with this but there might be others that are not so a man it would be you know it it's gonna be necessary listen that way hit belief when necessary but let's let's read a couple scriptures a man I want to read from first Timothy of chapter 3 and then also from John chapter 13 will read from the scriptures and and keep your Bibles close to you because later on the nasarah I will pull a lot of Scripture a man that we will will go through so praise the Lord Amen first Timothy 3 and verse 13 says without controversy great is the mystery of godliness God was manifest in the flesh God noticed that God was manifest in the flesh justified in the spirit seen of angels preached unto the Gentiles believed on in the world received up into glory wait a minute God was or Jesus was which one I mean God was received up into glory or was Jesus received up into glory right we we need to know these things a man hallelujah I can tell you both of them was God was received up and Jesus was received up why because Jesus is God's glory hallelujah alright let's go on a man over here to John 13 and let's just read a passage from there praise the Lord a man John 13 and I'll start at verse 1 this particular passage deals with the communion amen this is a scripture that we we use for communion especially when it comes time to the feet washing portion of the service a man and and Jesus did this and I just I'm always amazed by seeing the Creator a man come down to his creation and get so humbled that he will wash their feet right I mean the same people that he created now he's so humble that he comes down he washes their feet what a what a very special moment this was seeing you know God do that it just shows one of the that the attribute that was in God to want to be a father right and to want to have children to want to be connected to his children it shows this when we look at things like this in Scripture but here in verse one John 13 says now before the Feast of the Passover when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the end so now we know Jesus was received up into glory and now the Scriptures tell us that Jesus is a part of going back to the Father okay and it says here and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God right the Bible goes on to say he rose from supper and laid aside his garments and took a town gird himself after that he poured water into a basin began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with a towel wherewith he was girded let's pray father we thank you for the reading of the word now may the Holy Spirit come and help us to understand what it is that we have read and may you father get all the glory and all the honor out of this portion of the service thank you God for all that you have done and we also Lord just wanna take a moment to remember a man of the rudolph family in our prayers that god you would certainly strengthen them sister Linda is in need of you and only you God can provide what she needs only you can give her the comfort we we all have words and things that we can try to share but only people that have been there and done that can really understand you know what it's all about and and we know that if you're able to turn our mourning into dancing then you can do the same thing for her and as the song say your light in the darkness so in this dark situation father may somebody recognize Christ and may they be drawn to the light of your grace in the midst of it we know that your God we know that you're in control we know that you don't make mistakes and and we declare you are still away maker a promise keeper you're a miracle worker you're all that and we just appreciate you for who you are so now bless us God as we enter into this stuff today in Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you can be seated praise the Lord amen we'd like to use for our subject today he came from God and went to God and man he came from God and went to God very you know when we just kind of think about these words that Jesus said he says I came from God and in verse 3 says Jesus knowing that the father given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God also when we read there in and Timothy chapter 3 - praise the Lord a man we read there in Timothy chapter 3 verse 16 without controversy great is the mystery of godliness God was manifest in the flesh justified in the spirit seen of angels preached unto the Gentiles believed on in the world received up into glory and I'm just trying to tie these things together that's why I asked the question say now now now the Bible says that God was received up into glory and if we're taking it for what it is we know that Jesus was the one that was received up into glory so you have to yet the questions acts well how can alright these words you know here in the book of Timothy that that God was received up into glory it's because Paul had a revelation that jeez just was god right it's not that we got three different gods a man Jesus was God hallelujah amen you know and I find this I mean to me it's just very important I was having a conversation with you know a couple different people this week and you know one of the one of the things that I was sharing a man with somebody was you know just on the on the a thing of baptism and what that you know what that means you know and I was just kind of telling them you know when you get baptized make sure you get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ all rights and make sure it's done in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I started walking them through the scripture you know I say now why would Jesus make the statement baptize in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit you know the Holy Ghost you know but then ten days later Peter comes along and he says baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I say now why would Peter say that that's not actually questioning one person say that Peter have it wrong and they say yeah Peter had it wrong that's it's not wait a minute yeah oh yeah yeah what y'all say that Peter had it wrong then now you're saying that the Word of God is contradicting itself and you think God put something in this scripture right that that that actually would allow people to you know feel like it was contradictory God don't work that way amen what happened is that Peter caught a revelation of who the father was who the son was and who the Holy Ghost was and Peter said baptized in the name the name was the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah you know and I was telling us first I say now I you know so be sure that they do this to you don't go down in the water if they don't if they're not gonna do it that way and now they went down in the water and got baptized in the name you know and the name of father name is son name and holding us I said now let me give you an example here let me try to take this little further that's that just arranged a I got an agreement that I just signed and and it got our church name on it and and if we got a we established a little relationship with the hotel a local hotel and and for the meetings that we're gonna be hosting in June we're saying hey if anybody calls in from you know from that church and they need a room and they call and put an ax for the name of the group the group name further for the room that's the rooms that a block say then they should get the special ring but you got to know the group name alright I say now you go down to that hotel I just told you that I created this down there right and say now you go down to the hotel and you say now now I'm coming in the name of the pastor that got the the group rate with your hotel you know in order to get that special rate they don't say well what pastor cause we got a whole bunch of pastors that got got group rates what pastor well since I don't know the name of the pastor I'm coming in the name of the church right that's that got a special rate with you and they say they'll get a discount if you just use the name of the church well it was the name of the church right I mean you just can't go down say I'm coming in the name of the pastor I'm coming in the name of the church you got to give the people specific information right so when you go you gotta say I'm coming in the name of Pastor Jack Duff who represents spirit and truth tabernacle that has a group rate can I get the rate that he's established in his name come on your prayers ain't even gonna be heard if you came played in the name of Jesus if your parents ain't gonna be hurt then how you think your baptism gonna be accepted if you can be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus hallelujah somebody we need we need to understand what his name is understand what Jesus was talking about the church world has gotten so far off from these things and you know and I was just being I was telling another person this week I said you know cuz they were they were telling me how you know God's been so good to them and and and does so much for them and deliver them from cancer and and so many other things that God brought them back from and you know I mean close to death multiple times but God kept bringing them back and say you know even though they are on they're serving the Lord and and and even had an experience with God as they were driving the car this week ever said how the Holy Spirit came down in the presence of the car and they just began to worship so with by the time they got to work they like man I gotta straighten myself up because I can't go in there like this so they was trying to give himself out fixed up in the car I mean we need more experiences like that people get messed up on the way to work you just taking back the Lord and you just sit in the car crying because you thinking back the Lord now in order to do that you have to turn the radio off hallelujah somebody Amen but this person is sitting there in the prison Lord say say they think they think they try to compose themselves and they walk through the door a man in the office and Sue they stepped in though they just broke out crying all over again I say what a what a what an experienced a but you know I'm going through all that say but I don't feel complete and I say I said okay I understand say I have all that and I'm happy I got this I'm blessed financially I got this but I just don't feel complete so I said well you know the only way you're gonna feel complete is that you begin to walk in the full truth hey man they say what you mean walking in the full truth I say I said you know you say the Bible say that ye shall know the truth and the truth will make you breathe you can have the walk in the full truth and northern feel true amen completeness in Christ listen tonight what what you mean I said what can you ask that question I gotta break it down God sent a profit and that profit came back with the restoration of the word of God and until you can come back to that complete restoration of the Word of God and stand in that you will never be complete so it's people listening to this on the radio right now right they listen to it they don't feel complete the reason they don't feel complete because they have not come to complete truth oh my you're walking in that which is parked but when that which is in part has been done away with then that which is perfect has come and you can walk in that church Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so you know we realized that there's a there's a reason Amen that we follow things that we follow that we believe what we believe God God sent this so that we would we will find our way by out of this the the maze of christendom if I can just put it that way ain't nothing but a big maze and we don't run into a lot of dead ends amen and we have to turn around and go back the other way but you know as we as we as we find our way through the maze God as God has made a way through the word that's been presented to us now we can find our way out don't worry - god I want to just kind of just keep working with this a little bit he came from God and went to God now Jesus makes this statement you know right at the time that he's having communion and feet washing with the disciples and and here you know we can we can now wait a minute how could he say something like this I came from God and I'm going to God then that night now at the average church they have Jesus sitting on the right hand of the Father that the average church got Jesus sitting on the right hand in front and they leaving them there right now the first thing I want to tell you that God don't have right head and left hand like we have it we're talking about God God is a spirit so when the Bible say it sitting at the right hand of God it's not talking about heads like ours but it's talking about a place of power and authority and that's why when you pray you gotta pray in the name of Jesus not in the name of the Father not in the name of the son not in the name of only ghost you gotta pray in the name of Jesus if you want to see results ask the Father anything in my name you had to know his name come on somebody you got to know his name what is the name of the Father what is the name of the son what is the name of the Holy Ghost his name is Jesus Christ all right all right all right but he says this I came from God and I'm going I'm going back I went to God right I come from God and I'm going back to God I went to God he's giving us you know these these things you might well now how how did he come from God how how did he come from God how is he going back to God and it like I said not just we know the scripture speaks of the right hand of power you know but I mean Jesus sitting under our hands but we know by revelation is the right hand of power right it's a place of authority that Jesus sits hey man hey man so now when we look at this you know just a little closer and they says I come from God what where and how did he come from God we have to go all the way back to the beginning of Genesis you know why 1 and when you start just reading there in the book of Genesis I've mentioned this multiple times but I said again say when you look at Genesis when he says let there be light that first light that came out was s/o in light hallelujah not su in light because when you read your Bible you get down to the fourth day you'll see that God made to greater lights one to rule the day and one to rule the night anybody can recognize that that is the Sun to rule the day and the moon to rule the night anybody can recognize that well if the Sun and Moon did not come into existence to the fourth day what came into existence when he said let there be light what what came it takes instance then see we always looked at as that was to su in I'm here to tell you this one and no that was he s OE oh you don't believe it well we got our we got a a personal scripture that tells us what that it was and after Jesus had died rose again and we got a guy crucifying I mean actually one that wanting to kill Christians by the name of song and he's on his road to Damascus he's gotta let us in his hand anybody don't believe the way I believe my he's gonna kill him right so Paul got the letters in his hand and and Paul gets knocked off his high horse and as he's knocked down off his high horse here Paul has an experience that he places in the Bible and Paul says you know he sees a great light so that first s o in light was a great light it could be seen it could be identified not only that he could speak back to you because Paul begin to speak to the s o in light this light that Paul saw was greater a private in the Sun come on church it was brighter than the SU in he was looking at the SOE and as they begin to conversate Paul asked the question who art thou Lord the light spoke back to Paul it says I am Jesus well that's the same light out of Genesis 1 when he said let there be light Oh blessed be the name of the Lord it's right there in the Bible glory to God so we got to understand the light when he said I come from God you know God was if we just give you a little picture here God was not even God until they had something to worship Him he was L owe him the self-existing one he was all by himself but trapped inside of God was some thoughts hey there's some attributes that wanted to be expressed and they say the first thing I needed something to worship me I can't even be God until I got something to worship while he created angels angels came forth and they began to worship Him and that was that was real good but God still has the most stuff in him that he wanted to release and the only way he can get it released is that other things have to happen on this earth for that to occur my god let's just kind of pick this up glory glory glory glory glory amen amen amen let me just let me find something here let me start with the identified Christ of all ages glory to God a man just taking you on a little journey here glory hallelujah it says now God is great like a great being says in the beginning God see he wasn't even God to begin with God is an object of worship and he was called there was nothing to worship he was self-existent Elohim and there wasn't nothing to worship him when he created angels den there was something to worship Him but in this Great God Elohim was attributes there was absolute sin there to be God there was attributes and there to be God attributes to be father attributes to be son attributes to be savior attributes to be healer now you know this attribute that God wanted to be a son now the average person if I gave that to Mitchell well that was manifested when Adam came for if no no no it wasn't manifested when Adam came forth it was manifest when he said let there be light that's when the s om came out hallelujah that attribute was manifested when the s om came out and let me just go on a little further here so you can see what I'm what I'm saying here it says there was attributes there to be God attributes the attributes are to be father attributes to be son attributes to be say the attributes to be healer all these attributes was in God and if you've ever got eternal life you were in God's attributes because you got eternal life Jesus came as Redeemer and redeemed means bring it back to where it started from right you were in God's thinking he might have to breathe this with that and down here and down here like a man making child for the church puts in so much brass and so much iron gets it just right I've just just at the right pitch the molder knows how to put it in if he does it he doesn't get the right ring and what we're trying to do for the church is get the right ring hey man we get the right ring is talking about Jesus being God not having three guys that's the wrong ring we want to get the church back to the right ring Oh hallelujah hallelujah I got I got a little bit more than I want to read amen on this I want to go questions and answers on Genesis praise the Lord the Prophet says and questions and answers on Genesis says now God created man in his own image and in his own likeness what kind of man did he create he says a spirit man now if you'll notice after you have made all the creation and created a spirit man the close reading of this now the be the one that's asked the question we found this that God gives a million of the cattle and the fishes and everything to the man but in in his making up there he made man in his own image to lead the cattle lead the beasts of the field a man just like the Holy Spirit leads the believer today so the first man that was made was a spirit man right so what I always like to say this when you're looking at me you're not really looking at the real me right there's something on the inside of me praise God that was made in God's image this right here this this could have been made that's the animals image but what's on the inside of me it's been made after God's image and what's on the inside of me has to dominate what's on the outside of me listen he says this he says he was in other words out on the first name in the lower creations of God the first creation was God himself then out of God came to logos that's what I'm getting that right there out of God came to logos that's the som that came out of God out of got so when he said let there be light out of God came the logos what was the logos it was a light right it was a light because god being a spirit we wouldn't be able to identify him so he had to go on a form that we could actually identify him we could actually you know I mean that's what the children Israel saw that was leaving them that logo stat like it was a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night that's the same thing that Paul ran into on the road to Damascus it was the logos and then I could also be so Boaz the same thing that took a picture with brother Branham we see when you see the halo over brother branham's hair that's the logos that came out of God so unfortunately people get too mixed up on the Prophet but they fail to see the logos a man the the profit is underneath the locals understand that the logos is above the profit hallelujah amen so we want to put emphasis on the logos who we say I'm said we put emphasis on Jesus because he is the logos he's the one that came out of God and he's the one that way back to God hallelujah glory to God listen listen says the first creation was God of something out of God came the logos which was the son of God then out of logos which was the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh is what among us out and logos came forth the man out of the logos came forth the man just real quick just another statement that brother Branham made I won't pull this up he just says like God becoming God when he created angels he becomes son when he created Christ Jesus he become Savior when Jesus died he becomes healer when he was wounded for our transgressions and with His stripes we were healed those attributes were expressed at that time a man he becomes husband when he's married to you Oh glory to God amen God was not looking for a girlfriend he wanted a wife and he predestinated her oh my before the world even began he before she even came to urged he had a wedding band though the wedding band of Greece oh my god Church that's why the devil couldn't keep her you never belong him in the first place you always belong to God oh you come through this come through that doesn't matter what you come through you always belong to God's a man a man I see the same way that Jesus could say I come from God and I'm going that God we can say the same thing because we were attributes in his thinking we come from God and we're going back to God you know I was telling somebody recently you know God thought about you so much he thought about you so much that he created a man that would get an idea to create a chair because he knew that my wife wanted to sit on that chair the whole company was established with you in mind Oh y'all don't get that whatever the name of your company is the reason that they established is because you work there and God looted that company would have to be used to supply your needs the car that you drive he had somebody to silent anointed them to design it because he had you in mind he knew what you liked every detail God knows I mean every wife wants her husband to recognize the details right God knew your details and everything when this earth was designed to bring and then to bring comfort to you oh I just love him Church I love him a man I tell you what when we think about some of these things of what he he come from God he went to God he come from God not only did he come but we came from God and we're going back to God and if I could just put it this way you can't be lost impossible you know that this friend I was talking to this week is that I was here and I almost died with cancer and I was he almost died with this and I was here almost out you know you couldn't I mean until you come to a man understand of who you are in Christ you weren't going nowhere right I mean an addict at it as a young boy he might have remembered certain things but he was telling me say he said man I was just listening to the prophecy now you got to come back the truth and I said now what I mean by what really happened in the Garden of Eden what really happened he say well I was just listening to it this week and I heard brother Branham say now you talk truth why are you talking truth know what no Kyojin say what did the Prophet say about it he said I never heard these pains in all my life I say yeah you heard it you just didn't remember it he said that I heard brother Branham say it was a Daltrey I say oh yeah yeah are you talking something because now we go max why are there two genealogies in the book of Genesis wives John Cena Kane was up that wicked one why does the Bible say these things we gotta get back to truth I'm gonna tell you one thing we can't get it right in Genesis ain't no way we gonna have it right in Revelation we're trying to bring the church back man a man y'all just bear with me here today is we on a journey on a journey back a man even the Jews wanted to go back to their homeland what about the charge let's go back to what the scripture said that is our homeland hey man a man a man glory glory glory all right let me let me just go on a little further here we realize and as I was just sharing with him you know say that the way that we get back to truth is we have to follow what a prophecy it's telling another another young person I say you know you got any Bible you won't I have you got Thompson chain you got Scofield I got a Thomas somebody out of hock any now have to look at the beginning of to try to find but it's so many different manufacturers out there everybody got a Bible but if you're not care if you understand that the different manufacturers got different theologians that they agree with so they they're going to present the Bible in the way that they feel if you can present it so there's certain scriptures you start going through just studying your Bible you're just studying and then you get a scripture reference and you see what the theologian put there and you chase trace that reference sometimes it's spot on other times it's so far off you're like hi in the world what is that now the only way you'll know that is if you listen to the prophet then you can't you start catching things because see brother branham say after the seals were revealing say the bible became a new book so so when you listen to the prophet right the bible is the Bob will become a new book you can preach like the denominations preach you can't do that in the Bible's a new book you begin to see things and that is in my own Bible I start seeing things and read a minute that right there connect over here and I go and I look they don't have the reference but I right there representing myself because I know it's connected I'm not a theologian I'm just a bride and I know what my husband is writing to me in this love letter sellers say now see revelation 10 7 says in the days but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as you have declared to his servants the prophets the Word of God come to a proper if if we look at scripture I'm especially Old Testament written by prophets Isaiah prophet Jeremiah prophet Moses prophet Daniel prophet right I mean you just name it many prophets that God used to write write the Bible many problem so if God would use a prophet to write it why would you use a prophet to interpret it so why we why we satisfied with their with a theological point of view we ought to go back to what a prophetic view is now don't get me wrong brother branham did not come amen an interpret scripture for scripture for us he didn't do that but the Holy Spirit is here to interpret scripture for scripture for us but we got to get in the same we got to get on the same Channel oh my god service I mean those y'all that watch TV if you want to watch a certain thing you got the tune into the right channel hey man you watch it on the Internet you got to go to the right website if you want to get some from God you gotta have to be in the right channel of inspiration to get it from God you got to be in the right channel that denomination is not the right channel amen that denomination went off it got fuzzy you you hid in your rabbit ears glory to God ain't man you ain't got to do that no more with this message the picture become clear from Genesis to Revelation the picture it's clear oh my lord it god yes it was adultery that happened in the Garden of Eden hey man listen in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets here brother Branham makes some statements that I just wanted to pick up about mysteries amen this out of is this the sign of the answer and men he says some things here about mysteries now when he picks us up he's taken the notes of dr. Scofield and he's bringing that in to talk about mysteries but then as he's bringing in dr. Scofield notes then he adds his own notes so let's pick that up praise the Lord is this the sign of the answer he says now let's load a few of these mysteries and if you want to write them down first cuz it's a diamond missions of God would be finished so brother Brad let's not stand what are some of the mysteries what are some of these mysteries hallelujah who says - says now let's note for a few mysteries say let's note a few of these mysteries and if you want to write them down first I'll take first I'll take what Scofield Stan's here in Matthew 13 not not that he absolutely agree totally with Scofield but I'm gonna take what Scofield says amen it says now if you like to tight some of them down if you haven't got a Scofield Bible you might read what he thinks you might read what he thinks some of the mysteries are now in the eleventh verse it says he answered and said unto them because it's given to you his disciples because it is given to you to know the mysteries of God mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but not to them but to them it's not given now before I go further that I just gotta inject something here God inject something just turn with me in your Bibles to John 16 John 16 praise the Lord glory glory glory amen John 16 and I want to start reading here verse 25 we were just mentioning on Wednesday night to be an overcomer in the Philadelphian church age you were placed a man as a pillar in the temple of God and as been placed as a pillar meant that you were a part of the foundation a man holding up the superstructure right you were part of the foundation he established in place even you know the what the prophets said and what the you know the disciples were walking with they were part of that foundation right so here here with you been an overcoming you also be a part of the foundation pretty much saying that the same revelation that they walked in is the same revelation if you'll walk in and what I'm trying to tell you this for is that if you are walking in this revelation with clarity you're already an overcomer if you're walking in this revelation with clarity you are already an overcomer and what I mean by that that nobody can shake you take that pill out this church just what this building one exists um and that's I mean look you have another website you want to put up it will not impact me I'm not even it doesn't even matter I mean I'm not that when I first heard about him I actually avoided them completely i but you know why I said I don't want to waste my time I don't need to waste my time right I mean it's the same thing with you you try to give me another Bible outside of KJV I'm not really gonna read it I'm not gonna read it right I mean you know specially when it if I know that I'm took scriptures I love it why are you gonna give that to me oh my god right I mean you know I you know let me just kind of inject just a little bit y'all just bear with me here nowadays you know people say we even also just talked about how there's a uniting happening right the Catholics is uniting with the Protestants this year represents 500 years of division with the Lutheran's and the Catholics the Lutheran's are first ones to break away and everybody else follow suit right but now the Lutheran's the Protestants are coming back to the Catholics Joel Osteen got comments out there Rick Warren got comments out there everybody saying things like are they coming back together in the Catholics oh yeah we it's going to happen we already talked about how we gonna get this thing settled and then when they sense that you know what it's just the core things that we need to agree on I want you to hear that it's the core things Jesus died for your sins Jesus rose again right you got to be baptized which baptism because you know one of the visions was is that they baptize in the name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost and rest assured leave Lord Jesus Christ that's how the church started in the name of the Jesus Christ but the Catholics came along and they took it - father son Holy Ghost now the church they said we just got it we just got a file a court court you know Court we just got a grim cor things the Lord told me no no no no no no no we gotta agree on core things we gotta agree on all the words not just part of the word we gotta agree on all the word until you can become one with the word that we'll never experience unity all right all right John 16 this quote here just kind of brought this back to my attention because he was quoting the scripture there about the it's given to you the disciples it's given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but not to them but to them it is not given but it's given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom ever here John 16 the verse 25 these things have I spoken unto you in Proverbs but the time cometh when I shall no more speaking to you in Proverbs but I shall show you plainly of the Father listen at that day ye shall ask in my name oh you got to know his name you should ask in my name and I say not unto you that I will pray the Father for you I don't say I'm gonna pray to the Father for you right now and here here Jesus said now I'm not saying that I'm gonna pray to the Father for you almost separating the two right here Jesus being the son said I'm not gonna pray to the Father for you almost separate the two but you got to keep reading for the father himself love with you because you have loved me and have believed that I came out from God look at you slip that in now say you you believe that I came out from God let go til he says I came forth from the father and I am come into the world again I leave the world and go to the father his disciple said unto Him lo now speaking style plainly and speakest no proper now as a disciple you understand what he just but if you're not in fact well that was very confused and talk to you oh my that was extremely confusing wait a minute what you're talking about Jesus it's how about you know you're not gonna pray to the Father for us and now you tell me you come from God are you going back what are you talking about well the disciples knew that he was God Peter Peter said it Peter you know you say who do men say that I am hey save some say reliance so Jeremiah is one of the prophets that's what they say then he actually very specific question about who do you say that out of Southern Man a.m. they say thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God he said blessed art thou simon barjona because flesh and blood hath not revealed this to you but my father heaven has revealed this to you that's why Peter can also come after the day of Pentecost say be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because he had a revelation of who the father was who the son was who the Holy Ghost was look at this verse 28 I came forth from the father and I am coming to the world again I leave the world and go to the to the Father here's the cycle set of him low and now speaking out plainly and speakest know properly now we now are we sure that thou knowest all things and need it's not that any man should ask D by this we believe that thou camest forth from God jesus answered them says do you now believe brother branham save just like he had a maybe a little look on his face you finally got it and that's what you want to tell the church do you do you get it did you finally get it Jesus Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the new let's go on back to school okay let's go back to this quote is that it's just a sound the answer says uh in the answer that said in them because it is given to you his disciples because it is given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but not to know them but to them it's not given the mysteries here is the mystery now he's giving Scofield notes Scofield notes and he said I say this is what's Goldfield thought the mysteries were let's go on so now the mysteries here is the mystery a mystery is Scripture is a previously hidden truth now divinely reveal but which is a supernatural element still remains despite the revelation my god I like that a supernatural element remains despite the revelation when I look at that and I think about that I don't care how much people been teaching first revelation a supernatural element remains on the true revelation my god amen it was always in Scripture it was just hitting the church was not teaching it all the way back to what happened in the Garden of Eden the church has stopped teaching it years ago they gave us an apple they gave us an apricot they gave us they gave us every every other fruit but they did not give us adultery all right let's keep going Scofield's knows number one the mystery of the kingdom of heaven that's the one we're talking on now Matthew 13 3 250 says now second mystery is the mystery of Israel's blindness during this age and this still knows why was it's real blind you know you know during the stage heat and heat give me a reference of Romans 11:25 now praise the Lord some of the things just right there in the Bible when Jesus even pray you know Father forgive them for they know not what they do he knew that Israel was blinded and they were blinded so the Gentiles could see but Scofield thought that was a mystery well that's just scripture that's not a mystery let's keep going all right third history of the translation of the living Saints at the at the at the end time of this age wait a minute national fitness construct something the mystery of the translation of the Saints because you know the church then got away from teaching about the rapture they don't understand it and they even would tell you that the word rapture is not even in Bible when they say that that mean we don't have to teach it because it's not even in the Bible it's not scriptural maybe the word rapture it's not in the Bible I'll give you that but catching away is and the Bible say the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout voice and truck how did God do that well the Prophet tous that Jesus does all three so the Prophet brought the revelation of how the rapture supposed to take place it's right there in the message oh my god hallelujah so Scofield got something there but I'll go fit in here the Prophet actually explained it maybe he would have put that in his nose you know he'd already wrote it before the Prophet come but that's okay Amen listen the third mystery the mystery of the translation on the living Saints at the end time of the stage first first Corinthians 15 and also Thessalonians 4 14 14 through 17 another the fourth mystery of the new New Testament church is one body composed of both Jews and Gentiles Ephesians 3 1 to 11 Romans 16:25 and also Ephesians 619 Colossians 4 3 they use a script of support you know where he's getting stuff from the fifth mystery of the church as the barata price it features five twenty eight to thirty to the sixth mystery is that the living Christ saying yesterday today and forever now Scofield caught that but I don't know if he saw it manifested hey glory to God Galatians 2:20 in Hebrews 13:8 in many places like that the seventh mystery is of God even Christ as the incarnate fullness of the Godhead embody in whom all divine wisdom and godliness is restored to man ninth mystery is a mystery of iniquity found in 2nd Thessalonians and so forth the tenth mystery of the seven stars of revelation 1:20 look at the Scofield he want to know who these seven stars are he couldn't tell you who they were but he knew that was there as a mystery what God sent a prophet and he told us who each tie was God a man so it's no longer a mystery anymore people picking up the Scofield and not even interpret what the mystery is we pick up the scoping when we can tell you oh we put up all Iranian Martin Columbia Luther Wesley William Branham I gave this I gave that to a brother I said brother he was working for Kinkos at the time and I gave it to the president would you just you know make make you know make this for the church just blow this up I took the picture out of the church book if you look in his church age book brother brother Brandon blows it up he doesn't put brand him there he puts the Elisha and some people just leave it blank well this brother when he came back and brought brother Beck's it's not here and I don't think I even put it I don't know if I pretty large or anything now I just I just gave him tours just blow it up when I got it back it had Brandon there he caught it by revelation who was that seventh angel that seven star glory to God and we know about revelation who the seventh ain't Scofield looking for it let's go firstly this is mystery that got to be revealed it has been let's keep going I'm trying I'm just trying to get somewhere here today and I'm not making I'm not making much progress but he said he'd say that the tenth mysteries and Mister the seven stars revelation 1:1 twin and we just and brother Branham said we just been through that the seven stars of the seven churches the 7 messengers and so forth and says the 11th mystery is the is mystery of Babylon the prostitute revelation 17:5 to 7 now here Stoffel identifies in his Bible that the Catholic Church is revelation 17 fulfill in revelation 17 revelation 18 the Catholic Church and the Catholic Church is the Angel City that come out of her my people the Catholic Church all her dogmas and everything else that she had and now we are in a season where the Protestant churches are all going back now we'd be considered Protestant but we're not considered all that's going back we're not going back to the Catholic Church we going back to the word glory all right let me keep going he goes on looking what the prophecy is that's some of the mysteries that this Ange is supposed to wound up all the mystery all the mysteries of God that's revelation 10 7 and the other sin may I say this with reverence and not referring to myself but referring to the angel of God the serpent seed that's been a hidden mystery all through the years see how he injected that oh the grace Street now not disgrace but real true grace not no such thing as eternal burning hell you can't tell nobody gonna go to hell and burn eternally you just look at hell was created and anything created can not be eternal oh that's what brother Branham say couldn't believe in eternal sonship alright cuz the Sun was born it came out of God now praise God now we realized that with him coming out of God and going back to God there was an internal quality about the Sun and not only is there eternal quality about the Sun there's an eternal quality about you oh yes yes yes yes yes I am it's the gray straight now not disgraced but it's real true grace not no such thing as an eternal burning hell you'll burn for millions of years but anything that was eternal had never a beginning or end and hell was created all these mysteries says the mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation now you know there's a new one going out that you've got the half sensation where you get the Holy Ghost but brother rhythm so you can have it without sensation now you know just hold on to that I'm gonna give you a quick example you know that's why could I could appreciate what for the wand you know was saying just a few weeks ago and everything like that but you all remember there was a brother two showed up at a brother branham's Church we can pull it down he showed up and he was wondering about where they had the Holy Ghost and he had a there was a situation where his wife was going to church he wasn't going and he had a little card that he had you know and it's he was selling the car had a little card in his pocket like this and a guy gave it to him just witnessing to him gave him a little card and he put it in his pocket like his jacket pocket and now one day he he happened are looking at jacket pocket he just pulled a card out and the car say where were you spend eternity thought about it man where would I spend eternity man I never I never thought about this admit I need to get my life right so he just say start going to church and start going to church with his wife and man he just got completely sold out doing you know what was I mean just just completely sold out what was going on there and as she was there and began to praise her seeking God he wanted to be filled with the Holy Ghost so they say oh you come on and you you know you do this and and you had hold of girls I think it was you know think it might have been jumped or something like that you had Holy Ghost you know just whatever they tell them to do he did it and he say man I felt like I just didn't have it after that he said he went to amongst another group and and they told him to shout just shout you know I mean Joshua bid you to shout just shout you know he just starts shouting say he felt like he had the Holy Ghost then he got amongst the Pentecost to say oh we know what your problem is you ain't spoke in tongues yet what you need to do is speak in tongues oh my god so he you know he said he said he said that you know they start beating on the back beating on it he just started speaking of tongue speaking of time he say I spoke in tongues I still feel like I ain't have nothing so they say well maybe you got some sin in your life and what you needed to go see a prophet brother branham got a gift of but he can he can tell you what them happen in your life and that he'll find it and he'll tell you what you need to do to get the Holy Ghost so brother Brad I'm sitting there talking to the man he just went through his whole story he said brother they told me to see you got a profit maybe you can tell me what I've done in my life that might be stopping me from getting the Holy Ghost maybe you can share with me you know I'm just so open I just want to know what's stopping me from getting the Holy Ghost he said my brother you said that you were moving in this direction why you're selling cars you were doing this that in the other you weren't even thinking about the Lord and say but then you look down at a card and it said where were you spend eternity he said he said yeah that's exactly what happy to say that's when he came in see that was the Holy Ghost without sensation he said that's when he came in and the man thing what that's when he came in he say I shouted and I and I jumped and I cried and and I spoke in tongues you say what's they wrong he said no they had part of it right you say that's what her to do that they come in he said but but that's when he came in say the man begin to shout the men begin to jump the men begin to speak in tongues everything right there on the spot when he caught a revelation see you can't be completed to you coming to total truth that's when that's when you feel complete like man sometime we did cuz we've always always built it on any motion we always built it on sir say no you know when things changed in your life you know that and only you know you know what you got real with God and when you would fake you know that's why brother Branham said the Holy Ghost is an experience that you know and if you don't know then just seek God for the Holy Ghost right but you know and not only will you get it you keep fueling it because you own baptism after baptism refilling after refilling hey man yo your car your car King just have one feeling just keep going for the rest of his life try you caught the other side of the road because you refused to put gas in it somebody else might come get it and use it where the gas can how you expect to be used by God if you won't get the refills I'm trying all right let me let me go back let me go back it was um it was one thing that I'm trying to get here and I'm gonna have to skip all this to get there but I'm by God's grace we'll make we'll make some progress so the Prophet says this the one of the other mysteries that Scofield didn't catch was the mystery of the Batchelor old ghost without sensation but the person of Christ performing and you the same works that he did so the Holy Ghost is not just to come and make you speak in tongues but the Holy Ghost is to come and make you perform the works of Christ do the works of Christ right he said the spirit of Beethoven's issue is in you you write the music of Beethoven if the spirit of John Dillinger was in you you have guns shooting everybody say better the spirit of Jesus Christ is in you it's gonna make you live the life of Christ make you act the life of Christ that's what the Spirit of God is supposed to make you do if you claim the Spirit of God this please bear with me this you know I had two conversations this week just it just gets me you know these these things sometime you'd be looking for God he'd just be right there in front of you you know but uh young lady come to Michigan saying you know she was going I was talking about the mace and how in Christendom people just going through the mace they just they trying to find this trying to find that so they get with this group and it goes so far hit it Danny then they back up and didn't go go so Bob this other group they hit of Danny back up so so I I was just talking about just general terms like that she finally called it when she said you know I was going to church and and I was talking to him we had a Bible study we got to talking about the gifts of the Spirit talking about speaking in tongues say I believe in speak in tongues was that I spoke in tongues and she was telling me how you know somebody encourages say when you just got that anger built up in you you just don't know what to say to start speaking a toast when you get angry you just you just go - speaking of tones just let it out because you can't express it in your own normal language so just let that anger let it keep talking when - that's the Pentecostal church that gave it at if I said she went to Baptist Church the Baptist Church says we don't believe in speaking in tongues so wait a minute now the Bible actually said they spake in tongues and I said I said I said I said now you know there's a middle of the road here that we gotta get and that saying this was you know I I ran into a lady yesterday and she was just telling her she just they say we believe in holiness and then she looked what she that she looked Sheila hopefully but she was she dressed real nice you know looking holy but she said she's saying she's saying you know what I believe in speaking in tongues so I ain't got that much time to talk because I I know we would be in a conversation for a good while probably - this time tomorrow you know talking about this but I mean I look at people that just say that they just they don't believe in that but the Bible says that it happened in the church so we're supposed to believe in it I said but there's a middle of the road I say the middle row is you know this church is telling you to speak in tongues when you get angry that's not what the Bible's saying the Bible say they speak in tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance say not when you get angry that's you doing whatever you want to do spirit and give you no utterance and and how you gonna pray to God mad at God you expect God to hear that and they just just they coach them on the wrong stuff you just can't go talk to God any kind of way and expect to get a result yes sir you got to have the right approach to God I'm angry you angry but get over it all right but you know but I said there's a middle of the road that we got to find and what this message is done is brought us back to the middle of road glory to God listen brother Branham says the mystery of the mystery Baptist no Holy Ghost without sensation but the personal Christ performing in you the same works that he did the mystery of water baptism where the extreme trinitarianism has brought it into titles of Father Son and Holy Ghost in mystery of the Godhead being fulfilled in the baptism of the name of Jesus Christ the mystery of the Godhead being fulfilled in the baptism of the name of the Lord Jesus Christ according to the Book of Revelations that the church in this time was to receive there is some of the mysteries the pillar fire returning back a man that's the thing that's supposed to take place and we see it oh how we could go on naming the mysteries all we noticed that the viable told us in Revelation 10 7 that when thus in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound then the mystery of God should be finished as they have to clear two servants the prophets so if we want to understand these things it's best to go back and get a prophetic understanding of it then we know we stand Lord Jesus y'all just bear with me just for a few more minutes let me just share maybe one or two more things and then I will I will try to break out of this a man just some statements that I came out of church age book and this is regarding the Godhead and this is really where I want to go to today brother Branham said today there's a gross error if it is that there are three gods instead of one this revelation that's given to John by Jesus himself corrects that error it is not that there are three gods but one God with three offices there is one God with three titles Father Son and the Holy Ghost this mighty revelation is what the early church had and it must be restored in this last day along with the correct formula of water baptism notice the gospel says this if there were three persons in the Godhead Abraham the descendant of Shem and Genesis 18 saw only one God with two angels that's why I said my lord if he wasn't three people then he can't be three now he says Hebrews 12:2 looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endure the cross this positive shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God now that's where people get it but remember if there if it wasn't three then it can't be it can't be three now so we'll say Jesus sat down at the right hand the throne of God I know that's what the Bible said but God don't have a right hand like ours this was a place of power and authority listen it is not two gods but simply why God manifest in his mighty triune offices and titles one other thing that he said they who believe in three persons have a three guard Godhead are guilty of breaking the first commandment first commandments thou shall have no other gods before me we got to come back to the truth now I want to just bring this in and get out I'll get out today look at this I've been I had to go all kind of places to get this from EMI let me use you for a second now this is a what is this what is it it's a ruler one ruler are three rules now what we got is it two rulers open it up brother what is it he just opened it up two times here we had three rulers one ruler right so brother branham said when we're looking at the trinity say God is like he called it God is like a three-foot rule God the Father God the Son God the spirit now I never changed it was always one ruler he just unfolded himself at different times in history to show who he was it's always the same God I didn't give you three rulers it's one ruler but just changing that different dispensations so when it came into sin and his son gene and I always tell people it weren't God sending his son it was God becoming the son that's why great is the mystery of godliness that's why he went back up into heaven that's why I came from down I went to God he always came from God ask God the Father then it became God to son but Jesus say I'm sending you a comforter open it up let us see the confident but it's always the same God all the time and it's in its whole purpose for the he can't well inside of you you can't give me no three guards this one God all the time hallelujah so let me just read that quote for you now come on out of here deep calleth unto the deep look at what he says here a man a man a man he like a three-foot rule I I went all over the internet to get this v on they don't they don't have this dome over see brother branham had that back in his school days and they say it's like a three-foot rule it's just one one ruler for three sections it's one God but three offices one God multiple titles it's always one God though and I just love the way he say he unfold and he like he like he like that but then he just opens up that's why I say in the beginning in the beginning God created right actually you know if I just let me just say in the beginning God created the heavens and earth right but if you go back I can't read it all today but you go to Colossians and say Jesus did it well Jesus is going to say one thing cuz I should say something else they had to be the same person but what God was doing was unfolding himself so when the logos came out of God he just unfolded himself and when the Holy Spirit comes into you he just unfolded himself my hallelujah church glory to God man amen all right all right let's look at this he says if Jesus has risen from the dead as he said as he said that he as we know he has then he said he'd be with us since in all the way through the end of the world that's right that right then he if he is risen from the data set the things that I do show you do also he said he could do nothing except the father showed him in other words God the Father was in the pillar fire that was God the Father then no one could touch him not even Moses even if a beast touch the mountain it had to be killed with a dart you know the story well then that was in the burning bush that halo of fire a pillar fire and then that pillar fire come down and was made flesh among us that's that's John 1 that pillow fire came down and was made flesh among us listen it says that same pillar of fire was God yet watch and then when his son when when this Son of God died then his spirit came back into me and simple men see that was a holy virgin born come back and that makes God like a three-foot rule see the first 12 inches God the second 12-inches God the Sun hurt 12 inches God the Holy Spirit that's the reason as wheels commanded the baptized in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost but it's the same God not three gods which that'd be a heathen our God but it's our God one God it's God unfolding his self down to man and the reason he's doing that so he can get down and live among me isn't he lovely now he's done that so he can help you tonight and hear me is sinner like you saved by grace but God has unfolded his stuff down into mortal being and that he could take through one and help another yeah I couldn't heal you but that's already did at Calvary I couldn't forgive sins or heal sick nobody could God did that but now gifts are putting the church to point to that church I I just I rejoice over this when we get the true revelation a man of who he is if I tell you what it makes us overcomers and there's not a thing that the devil can do to get us off this we're part of the superstructure one more quote here out of here um I think it's the last one I got on that page hear ye him the Prophet says this it says now you see Jesus had proven to God that he'd been the right kind of Sun and God took him up on the top of the mountain brought witnesses out out their heavenly witnesses and earthly witnesses and they clothed him in immortality when they looked up they said his garments shine like the Sun a supernatural something taken place his garments glistened like the Sun in in its middle of the day as wide as they could be God placed on him that robe of immortality showing that he had received him that's the thing that God will do to his sons here on earth someday he says he we'll call you a side Church and if you'll only obey Him and stay on the word and believe it and he will placed into the church before the coming of Jesus Christ he will placed into the church all the powers that Christ had in him will be in the church all that God loves he poured into Jesus and just think about that ruler right Oh God being that first part of the ruler first 12 inches then we opens up amen the second part he says all that God was important of Jesus when he opens up now the second part all of that Jesus was he pours it into the church the third part right all that Jesus was he pours into the church God wanting his work done he sent it into his son the son one in the work done sent it into the church and that that day you'll know that I'm in the father the father me and I in you and you and me at that day because the same power of God was in Jehovah God rested in Jesus Christ the same power that rested in Jesus Christ rests in the place sons in the body of Christ all I can say is a man I'm so glad that we standing on this and like I said we got to go back and and really just you know revisit these things we not serving on three gods it's one God and I didn't get to it a day out if I get a chance I'll come back brother branham said from Genesis to Revelation that Revelation has been there of one God I want to walk you through scriptures just Genesis it was this way I eyes there it was this way another scripture was there I mean I'm I can't do it today I can't get it all out in one sermon but we gonna we gonna get there we're gonna get there I just I'm just trying to reestablish trying to bring people back to truth oh yeah we going back not like the night not like all the other Protestants we going back to the word and we can't agree on simple things like this how are we gonna have some unity I mean I still believe that a Catholic Church is a great revelation the Pope is the man of sin the Antichrist I still believe that that's why they separated because they believe things like that right but now what I mean you ask people who the Antichrist is they have no idea well the hat harlots she had daughters amen that's exactly what the Bible's saying and her daughters are going back home but I didn't come out from the Catholic Church I come from God and I'm going back to God and brother Branham say there's gonna be a lot of pressure put on us he said but Jesus comes at a time of trouble I'm under expectation for a rapture because I'm standing on this word did Jesus come at a time of trouble for the Hebrew boys where were they they were in the fire but in the fire they met the fourth man glory to God so if we got to go through some fire we're gonna meet somebody praise God and they won't stand on the revelation that we got they were standing on their own but we got a little bit more than what they had but we standing on the anyway and I believe God I'll meet us just like he met them praise God amen they at least knew not to bow down to no false gods faint man they knew not to do that and we not bowing either no false god you know they were and in some places brother man who say that you know they'll even take your building from you you won't even have a place to worship unless you're doing what they actually to do now I have to be careful when I say this because if they took this place of worship from me they didn't take my worship they didn't take my worship they might have took the place of worship from now while we still got a place to worship come to church cuz they ain't taking it from you the devil taking it from you now when they take it from you then you can't then you got we have to come up with some other you know alternatives praise God but now now while we still got a place to worship let's come to church for sake not to send yourselves together as you see the Day approaching but wait to the day get here before you stop let's pray father we are just so grateful for a truth that we could stand down and god these are things that we know but sometimes it's so good just to kind of go back over it just to reestablish got what you have called us to and now your prophet is telling us that you're like a three-foot rule what a powerful example we see it's just one guard all the time unfolding himself until he finally gets to spot where that to god that was there at the beginning there wasn't even God until he created angels to worship but there was still things in him that were bottled up that needed to be expressed to still to be released you want it to be a son you want it to be a father you want it to be a healer you want it to be a deliverer you want it to be a wave maker a promise keeper light in the darkness and God we declare that is exactly who you are we thank you Lord for every attribute that you have expressed to us and God as we walk with this word today realizing that you know we might be some of the only ones on the earth holding to truth but God will hold with everything we got so Lord let the demonstration would be something that sinks into our hearts into our minds and you know God may be something that we hold on to in this hour no matter what the enemy offers no matter what tricks he wants to play God we just want to hold to the word so keep this God as our prayer we give you all the glory we give you all the honor we give you all the priests sin Jesus name we pray amen amen let's give the Lord a hand of praise [Applause] brother Troy once you come close this out today a man prays a little church hey man how many appreciate of the word a man let's go to the Lord and to praise a man really kind of caught me off guard I'm gonna go over and wrap up certainly the Lord did speak to us it was wonderful you know I was just a couple of weeks ago kind of talking with a good friend of mine Lords just dealing with his heart and he's going to church and things and here I'm say certain things just try to be laying window when the winter break things opens well I don't want to just choke him out he's a babe in Christ you know you give a baby I strong meat they go to looking at the side wait man what are you into you know so I just try to be led by the Lord on how much I give them what I give them and then I
