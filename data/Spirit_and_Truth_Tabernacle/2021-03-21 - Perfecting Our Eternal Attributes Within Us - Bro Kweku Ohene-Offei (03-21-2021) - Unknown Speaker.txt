this morning praise the lord [Applause] god bless you this morning i walked into church and i just was overwhelmed with um just this feeling of nausea so i claim my healing um if you know this song just sing with me okay so many times i've questioned certain circumstances and things i could not understand and many times in trials weakness blurs my vision and my frustration gets so out of hand [Music] it's then i am reminded i've never been forsaken i've never had to stand the test alone [Music] and when i look at all the victories the spirit rises up in me and it's through the fire my weakness is made strong [Music] he never promised that the cross would not get heavy that the hill would not be hard to climb [Music] and he never offered victory without fighting but he said help would always come in time [Music] so just remember when you're standing in the valley of decision and the adversary says given just hold on our lord will show up and he will take you through the fire [Music] again i know within myself that i would surely perish but if i trust the hand of god he will shield the flames again [Music] he never promised that the cross would not get heavy that the hill would not be hard to climb [Music] and he never offered victory without fighting but he said help would always come in time [Music] so just remember when you're standing in the valley of decision and the adversary says given just hold on our lord will show up [Music] and he will take you through the fire again just hold on our lord will show up and he will take you through the fire again [Applause] praise the lord do you believe that amen no matter what you're going through amen there's a fourth man on the scene praise the lord he will meet you in the fight he'll never let you face it

saints it's good to be in the midst of you this morning before i go into the song i want to uh just share something with the church i received a very evil report this week from my doctor and it really stunned me and i sat there just trying to process the things that he was telling me and i thank god for being in the room i really do doctor you know he was telling me what he what i needed to know and he says you know i hate telling you these things but i'm a doctor and i have to i have to i have to let you know what's going on [Music] he uh he reached over and he grabbed my hand and he says he says are you a woman of god i said yes i am yes i am he said i knew that from the first time i saw you i knew that you were and i know you know who the healer is i said yes he's touched my body many times many times he says well i'm a man of god and i know him too he began to share testimonies of healings within his family of some really some dark situations that uh he witnessed the healing one was his dad his dad is a pastor and he said the doctor had given given his dad a month to live and he says here he is 15 years later he's still ministering the word of god and he's he was in no hurry to get me out of the office he just went through testimony after testimony and just he says you're going to be fine you're going to be fine he said i know you know the lord i guess i do yes i do then he started praying for me it wasn't no simple little prayer truly was the son of god that was praying for me and i sat there the tears just swelling up and spilling out because i was overwhelmed by his compassion more so than the what the diagnosis was just seeing a doctor so out of his professional role you know on my behalf [Music] and we talked on the look for him constantly encouraging me he says i'm gonna i'm gonna keep praying for you i'm gonna be following you i'm gonna be you're gonna be in my heart i say i know i know that and as i get i got up to leave he stood up and he walked around in front of me and he says i know this is totally out of protocol but can i hug you it was you know it was like he was ministering to his mother it was and it just moved me right on past what i was going through i told him i never forget it i'll never forget him and i never will and as i left that building i just cried all the way to my car and i got to my car and all i could do was worship the lord so all i could do was worship and sit there and worship the lord [Music] [Applause] because he showed me he showed me from the start that he's with me that was i told i said you are son of god just wearing the white coat but you're positioned right here where you are where you need to be most i'll never forget it i never will and this is the thing that when the enemy comes i go back to that moment that jesus christ appeared to bring a balance to my emotions i thank him so much i know he has me i know he has me i expect my healing i don't know how god is going to do it i love for him to touch my body and everything be gone that's my preference but if he chooses it another way i'm willing to go that way because i know he has me i know he does he has me [Music] i thank you lord

lord not just in this this little tabernacle lord our lives outside the tabernacle will be jesus christ and manifestation we thank you we love you we bless you take every suppression oppression of the enemy out of your people and bless them in abundance fold we thank you we love you we bless you in jesus christ and we pray amen god bless you and shall we give a lot of clap offering unto the lord amen god bless you our musicians i call them our cherry beans and seraphims they bring the inspiration for us the preachers we thank the lord for his goodness you may take your seed the lord is good we thank him for all his blessing whatever he's done for you and i throughout the week and the year and over the years it's the grace and the message of the lord and we don't take it for granted every day we breathe every day we rise up and we go to bed it's a blessings of the lord and our whole duty is to serve the lord with all our hearts with all our mind our body soul substances and whatever we have we give it to the lord jesus christ amen because the purpose we are here is not a lot of visions and a lot of dreams that we have but the grand vision is his world the purpose he has called you to be what is called you to do that is the duty of man amen the bible said the whole duty of man is to save god and obey his commandment so whatever little dreams you have if that dream supersede the word of the lord then you have to trash it amen whatever vision you have if it doesn't doctor with the word of the lord then it's not from the lord throw it away but if you find what the lord has allotted you to do position you here on this earth to do then you carried out with all your might with all your strength amen so this one you want to just speak on a little subject entitled perfecting our eternal attributes within us perfecting our eternal attributes within us before we came here on earth the lord put it put certain attribute in us before adam before your great-great-great-grandparents over the generation the lord ordained you for this work and he put certain things in you to manifest and those attributes are eternal you can't take them away from you it's part of your nature and that is what we are trying to find out what the lord has ordained me quickly to do ordain you to do and when you find your purpose as brother solomon is found his purpose singing unto us leading their songs bringing a blessings unto us our sisters here and everyone has found their purpose but if you haven't found your purpose in life if your purpose is to think you are you are here to make a dead president you know that dead president right american american dollar it's got the image of that president if that is your vision that that is all you have you are here to do then you've missed the vision entirely you've missed the whole ballgame your vision is not for dead president and for mansions they are good the additions they are places and their bonuses the lord give it to you and i but that is not why we are here on this earth if the dead president leak out of your pocket you still said the lord jesus christ if your mansion is taken out from you you celeste a son of or a dead of god if you don't have electricity you are still the daughter of jesus christ if you are if you don't have food to eat you are still the lord of jesus christ just like a human being nothing changes you if you go under the ocean to swim you still a human you are not a fish you can swim with a fish but you're not a fish if you go to the woods and run with the wild animals the deer and whatever you don't become part of the animals you're still a human being so it doesn't matter where you find yourself you sell a son and a daughter of jesus christ amen and so you want to find out the attributes so we want to read certain scriptures we can take our scriptures if you don't mind let's stand up and look at certain scriptures before let's look at ephesians chapter one verse one to four ephesians 1 1-4 we want to see paul when he found his purpose on earth before he became poor we know his life he was so he had a lot of knowledge here and he was very religious person he studied under pharisees under gamaliel one of the greatest tribes in in in his time but he realized that i was in his purpose he ended up even killing people persecuting people because he thought those people were not doing what he thinks they were supposed to do but then he found his purpose when he made a pill of fire personally for himself not what gamaliel taught him not was what somebody taught him but what the lord jesus christ revealed to him personally and so there's other scriptures that are god's eternal attributes certain scriptures pertain to before your time on this earth and certain scriptures pertain to your life on this earth so ephesians chapter 1 verse 4 is one of the scriptures that pertains to your life before you drop from your mother's womb so let's read one to four ephesians chapter one chapter one verse one to four paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god to the sins which are at ephesus and to the faithful in christ jesus grace be unto you and peace from the god our father and from the lord jesus christ blessed be the god and the father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ verse 4 according to us he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love 5 5 also pertains to eternity having predicted us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will may the lord add blessing to the origin of his word shall we be seated now we realize that paul was talking about the scripture ephesians one for us he said according us is choosing us in him before the foundation of the world so he wasn't here when the lord chose him the truth was the lord not what he chose to do he chose to be under his parent took him to a gamaliel to go and study that was the end of the day they didn't have the school we have here they have they find a tutor and they place you under the tutor to steady and those time they had all their trade paul was a lawyer he was as a scribe he was a theologian he had all the dog treats you can think about he was a professor but he missed one-on-one experience with the lord jesus christ he believed in jehovah he believed the law of moses to the core he fought for it he lived it he breathed it he read it all the time in those time they didn't have to some of them didn't have to work the former way we work 8 hours putting in 8 hours and 12 hours a day no their work was doing farming and and gardening and what have you they didn't have what you they don't have a time table where you clock in and clock out no so they had more time for themselves so they spent time reading the scroll the scriptures of moses but yes so he missed the eternal portion the eternal part because he was here on earth having a one-on-one experience with the lord jesus christ but then there was a time when he had one-on-one experience when the pillow fired himself that he was fighting met him and said so so why do you persecute me he said who are there lord because he knew that was jehovah but he didn't know him as jesus christ so the lord said i am jesus whom you are persecuting how could this persecute jesus christ when jesus christ was dead and living in heaven heaven was in the heart of the believers so jesus christ was the believers at that time amen the believers were jesus christ at that time and if jesus christ is in you you are the jesus christ of this day amen god bless you so let's go let's get back to the topic perfecting our antenna attributes let's read another scripture from hebrews 11 1-8 the book of hebrews chapter 11 and we want to build a foundation where the lord started a foundation of unconditional covenant hebrews chapter 11 verse 1 to 8 we'll be jumping some of the scriptures now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtain a good report through feet we understand that the walls were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear by faith able offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than king by which he obtained witness that he was righteous god testifying of his gift and by its being dead and by it he been dead yet speaketh by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god translated him for before his translation he had a testimony that he pleased god five but without faith it is it is impossible to please him for he that committed to god must believe that he is and that is the reward of them that diligently seek after him amen so we will leave it there and the rest you can read when you get back home for the sake of time and i want us to read another scripture from hebrews 12 hebrews chapter 12 verse one and two just two scriptures wherefore seeing we also are compass about with great cloud of witness and i want you to underline cloud of witness let us lay aside every week and the sandwich that so easily beset us and let us run with patient the risk that is set before us two looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endure the cross despising the despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god so what is a cloud of weakness how can a cloud we know the clouds in the sky how can they be a witness the class is a symbol of supernatural clouds so the cloud where paul was right now about is not a cloud in the sky but a cloud of witness is the theophanies your celestial body amen you and i that we are witnesses upon the earth you are a cloud of witness we are not a physical cloud floating in the atmosphere maybe you can see class when you look at the imagery no this cloud is a type of you and i amen this cloud is a type of the celestial being in you so paul is talking about singing knowing that we are compass we are surrounded by a cloud of witness by few funnies by celestia being the lord himself is here he's not in the sky somewhere no he doesn't live on jupiter the lord created all the celestial bodies but he chose the earth the third planet to be the place of his abode and that's why your flesh and my flesh is templing the lord jesus christ amen he didn't put human beings on pluto on mars on jupiter but he placed human beings on this little tiny earth here and he placed himself not on the whole earth his glory is seen on the whole earth but then his glory is seen more in you amen because you are the temple of the living god blessed be the name of the lord so let's go back to the attribute let's take our father abraham if he can give us the um the powerpoint that'll be great our father abraham thank you god bless you the lord we know the law started with a covenant called conditional covenant with our father adam that do this and i'll do this when i do this you do this so it's you do it you do something the lord does something and one of them was don't tie the tree in the midst of the garden and we know what happened the man film because man is not able to keep covenant and the lord kept on bringing laws and conditional covenant to the point that the lord decided that okay man has experienced enough of the law man cannot live by law so i'm going to flip it i'm going to give an unconditional covenant which is by grace what i have done regardless of what you do which is called love love doesn't base on do and i do you do and i do is law it's obligation but then when it comes to the love of christ you don't have anything to do with it you just accept it amen so the lord began to construct a house just like masons and con contractors and architects control the house bethlehem house is based on the four corners we use the square or rectangle so one corner here one there one here one here so the lord is also an architect the greatest architect thereof is the lord jesus christ himself so he wanted what we do here is just a pattern of what the lord does dimensionally we look at a pattern and bring an image of what the lord is trying to achieve in the celestial world so the first concrete or the first pillar he put on the earth when he started the unconditional covenant is a man called abram who later became abraham now abraham in him when the lord called him he wasn't a righteous man he was an idol worshiper just like his people that's what they knew they had idols just like people worship idols at this time we watched them in different manners people worship if you go to india they don't eat some not all part of india but some people don't eat um cow they don't eat meat because the cow is is an idol it's if you kill a cow it's like you kill a human being you'll be in trouble so certain part you can't eat a cow you can't eat certain animals that we eat here because it's idols that they worship some worship rivers and if you go to let's say certain countries and country most people don't worship idols in that form but yes we have greater idols like as a dead president people can kill somebody for the sake of that president i was watching a another news at youtube and a man burnt a house i think his mother-in-law's house and his wife no his mother lost vehicle and the house his wife or girlfriend was living in it because he didn't get his bonus 1400 1400 1400 right yeah a thousand four hundred four hundred dollars he said his mother's mother's mother-in-law how um vehicle ableist and he said his wife house ablaze because of fourteen hundred dollars because what dead president i does to him they are so dear to him that you touch his dead president you touch his bloodline and that was a price the mother-in-law and the wife paid for it for touching his 1400. so that is an idol so back to abraham he was another worshiper just like anybody that was born without christ but then the lord in him before the foundation award he was an embodiment of faith the lord called him to be a faithful servant of course abraham had mistakes you can go through the bible old testament read about abraham's life genesis he had a lot of bunch of problems a lot of flaws in his life but yesterday before the lord he was perfect because the covenant is not conditioner amen so to the extent that the lord called him father of faith that title was given to him when abraham didn't know that he was going to have a son or not how can a father of who doesn't have a child but the lord wanted you to use faith as we read that faith is the substance of sin of things not seen with the physical eyes but it's in the celestial eyes it's in your heart it's in the celestial world it's it's right here though you might not see it with your physical eyes it's just right here it's in the sixth dimension or the sixth realm where you might not see with this eyes but then the six frames is in you it's in your brothers and your sisters and you don't look at your brother or your sister the way he is you look at him the way the lord looks at him amen it doesn't matter so ibrahim was started the lord started with abraham as a father of faith and abraham had mistakes but he was faithful to the lord would despite his mistakes when the lord calls me abraham move from your people and go to where i'm going to send you when he didn't even know where the lord was going to send him imagine telling your parents your family that the lord has called me and i'm going to take my wife and going to live in this country where did the lord tell you i don't know do you think you are probably getting crazy you don't know where you are going you're taking your family what's wrong with you you're prosperous you've got land people here you've got businesses why are you taking your wife and go to a country that you don't even know where you are going but that is faith and the lord accounted to abraham as a blessing for being sincere for being faithful to the lord he went through he had his six ups and downs i mean he went through thick and thin but abraham received a promise now out of abraham came isaac isaac was christ just like abraham in part revealing the love of elohim amen all these things if you look at my diagram the four corners elohim or jesus christ or eternity or the fountain of life was the one that was powering all these attributes it's just like the mason if there's a house sometimes when you go and inspire the house you don't see the contractor but the contractor was the one or the masons were the one who put the pillars and the concrete and everything the foundation there you might not see them around you see the beautiful mall that was just erected in your area oh this small is so beautiful wow that's awesome you don't know who put it there but there was somebody who put those more there the lord jesus christ was the one who was bringing the attribute out of abraham so isaac was the beloved son as you know his story he was an embodiment of the love of christ so the lord made sure that the parents went through some challenges before isaac came about remember the lord gave the promise to abraham that you're going to have a son when he was abram and his wife sarah but then it took how many how long 25 years they went through difficult times for them to appreciate for them to see that it's the love of god amen what you have sometimes you don't appreciate it but when you lose it that's when you appreciate that oh wow this was dear to me i wish i would have handled if he's a person i should i would have handled a person differently i would have shown him or him or love amen so now that you see your brother you see your son your wife your children your husband give them the best as you give it unto the lord because maybe tomorrow they may not be around and you can't do nothing much it's already gone amen god bless you now so isaac was the second foundation which is love the love of jesus christ isaac portrayed jesus christ it doesn't mean isaac didn't express faith perfection and grace but the main attribute that the lord was trying to achieve with isaac's love life was the love of christ as he did faith with abraham so now isaac came israel or jacob jacob means a supplanter a deceiver and we know his life he was interested in the dead president he was deep in his brother for it his father-in-law and he would just do whatever to i mean he would he could do to get his dead president is that president was the gold and the sheep and the lamp and dustin those were there present at that time they didn't have the paper dollars we have then so jacob was really he was a jew and if you have really encountered a jewish person who are interested in dinero money he was a typical jew so he didn't play with dead president you know so and he had a lot of them but he realized that there was something missing in his life there was a missing link and this president and gold and diamond and wives he had a bunch of wives children they couldn't fulfill it there was something missing and he saw his life like no this is not who i want to be the great voice the great pillow fire was speaking to me son where are thou the lord was the one who gave him all the blessing but there was a missing link in his heart that was eternity and it came to himself that norm i need to do something so one time he met an angel angel of the world came to visit him and he said i know i'm wretched i'm not this is not who i want to be that eternal voice ephesians 1 the voice that chosen before the foundation the word was was talking to him he said lord he said if you don't change me change my nature i'm not going to let you go and then just say no i cannot be seen by people it's getting light it's coming out sun is rising leave me said no if you don't change me i don't want to be jacob no more i want to be changed i don't know who i want to be but i don't want to go on this way i want i want i don't want to be a deceiver i'm not satisfied with all the the lamps and the goats and lands and all this property that is not that doesn't satisfy my soul and then he wrestled an angel and then you said what is your name he said my name is jacob i'm a deceiver and said your name is going to be israel a prince who has obtained favor with the lord amen and he went limping but he had the holy ghost in him amen glory hallelujah to the lord in the old testament they had the holy ghost but not in the form that we had it because the lamp has not been sacrificed they had christ in them but not in the the way we call the new breath as in the new testament but nevertheless they had christ on the inside of them and that's why they were doing what they did the women and the ladies and the men in the old testament so now israel for full grace the grace of the lord turn his life around from being jacob the deceiver to being israel a prince who has got favor with the lord now let's come to the last corner of the building the last pillar joseph who was a type of perfection he epitome the perfection of jesus christ of elohim or jehovah now he was you know his trial he didn't become a perfect person in a day when he was born for going to be a perfect person the lord took his mother away before he even was conceived his mother was barren and the mother was even present the husband why is my sister-in-law getting children why are the seven getting children give me a child and jacob said i'm not in the place of the lord i cannot i can do as a husband but the lord has to give you the seed so the right time the lord gave him uh joseph and his brother benjamin and through i think when benjamin was being born his mother was taken away whatever happens in a believer's life in as a child of god the lord has an eternal purpose for it and if you don't see the eternal purpose you're going to dwindle into oblivion but when you find out that whatever happens to me elohim has a purpose i may not understand it now but in the course of time he's going to reveal it to me amen because the lord didn't want him to be a mummy's boy he wanted him to be a ragged person because he was going to raise him jesus christ was elohim was epitome trying to bring the attribute of perfection in his life which is the type of jesus christ so jacob went through his trials with his brothers and and potiphar's house he thought he's got a refuge no things didn't work he has to i mean be taken he was firstly accused and he went to jail somebody was going to be perfect he landed in jail to begin with a criminal record now you can probably get certain job you you went to jail nobody's going to hire you but then that was joseph that was god's perfection and man the lord chose to be a perfect person and so the lord ran him through myanmar through different trials and temptation and now he matched as a prime minister of egypt which was the superpower at that time amen so whatever the lord is doing in your life the lord has a purpose the lord took a parent of esther when she was just a little girl because the lord was going to bring a princess who was going to be a queen and he wanted to line her with her uncle or her cousin what's the name monica who was a prayer warrior to bring that eternal attribute out of esther she didn't know she was a queen she just knew that she was an immigrant the jewish in in in india that was the superpower at that time with his uncle they migrated but the lord had an attribute in him to be the present wife or the king or the wife of the queen at that time so whatever happens to you you might not understand the trials you're going through it might even be a sickness but the lord is trying to achieve something out of that glory hallelujah to the lord there's nothing out of cater with the lord he knows exactly what he's doing amen so the over keep he got his foundation and he begin to unveil himself through the prophet and women at that time until he came to a point that the masterpiece himself has to come down amen and want to read a little quote here before let's go to uh the message masterpiece which the prophet barbara preached our prophet preached in 1964 july july 5th 1964. we want to go to paragraph 59 that was uh unconditional covenant five nine so he begin now he begin now taking men from man from his covenant of saying that if you will i will and he begin with a man called abraham and give him and give and give to abraham a covenant unconditionally every time he will start a masterpiece satan will get it because because the word because the word but when he started with abraham he said i have already done it now this is unconditional not what if you will i will but i've already done it now he the sculptor is determined to have this masterpiece then from abraham comes the patriarch and the patriarch really now now what's god's doing he's rebuilding this masterpiece that had fallen so in the patriarch the first we find was abraham amen let's go to so the lord already had a masterpiece with adam which fell and the lord is trying to reconstruct another masterpiece so paragraph 61. now watch every masterpiece is put on a foundation a sculptor angelo's monument of moses is on three or four foot piece of marble it's got a foundation so god in preparing this masterpiece he put it on the foundation of the patriarch and the patriarch foundation first was abraham then isaac then jacob then joseph the four corners and now abraham was foundation of faith let let's see it's hard for foundation the foundation of faith was abraham but the foundation of love was isaac the foundation of grace was jacob god's grace to jacob anyone knows that but in joseph was perfection there is where he could set a monument upon not on the first foundation the second foundation the third the third foundation but on the fourth foundation that is perfection let me read a paragraph 17. all the oh if you want to sorry you can bring it up for for us you can if you have either the powerpoint or the code from the message you can bring it up sorry thank you paragraph 70 that all the prophet had flaws all the ones was a portion but here at last coming up through finally comes the masterpiece the perfect one no fault in him at all so perfect reflected of the builder himself his own image was reflected in his work god and christ were one in so much until he put his own spirit into him then even the image and the brother became one god and his sculptor work his masterpiece moses uh was in the working of saint angelo was in my angelo rather was his copter a sculptor awake that was that was dead because it had been made out of a stone but here the master builder when he got his handiwork perfected he stepped into it amen mark angelo couldn't step into his masterpiece but then the lord stepped into masterpiece and what is the masterpiece is you and i amen turn the word masterpiece around it's coming from two as master and peace if you turn it around you've got a peace of the master that is where the word is coming from so it's not you are not eliminated from the lord you are very the lord jesus christ in manifestation libra solomon's son is not an alien from him is his own blood is is part of him it's a manifestation of him amen so you are christ in manifestation for this day and for this hour just as peter and paul and moses and hannah and rebecca and elizabeth were christ in manifestation you are the modern day peter and hannah and joseph and what have you jesus christ on earth amen you are not an alien because before the foundation of the world as we read from ephesians chapter 1 4 he put those attributes in you you you wrote your name in the lamb's book of life what is the lamb book of life it is himself so you were part of him that's why you can never be lost there's no way it's impossible that you'll be lost no it's not your name was in the lamb's work of life so getting lost is out of the way you can make all the mistakes you want of course the lord can make you you will make you pay for it on earth regardless of you being a son or daughter but there's nothing like you getting lost because you are part of eternity if you get lost then the lord is not complete it's like you take a person's hand off the person is not complete because it's got a missing lamp or a missing finger the body is so they're all together that if you chop just a little part of the finger away the sense of balance is going to change because the whole body the working coordination they are part of each other amen glory hallelujah now let's look at this masterpiece when it came on earth here as in the form of the man jesus christ and we want to look at the powerpoints and look at some images which we know we want to look at huffman's head of christ at 33. praise god hallelujah this is the just the image of hoffman was a german sculptor he had an inspiration and he drew the lord jesus christ when he was just about to be crucified he spent about 33 to 33 and a half years on earth so that was what uh huffman portrayed he was a human being he was he had headaches he was sick he was tired sometimes because he wanted to be part of the attribute that you and i go through that's why the bible said that jesus christ the high priest who can be felt by what can be touched by the feeling and underline the word feeling of your infirmities because he's been sick before if he's not being sick before you and he wouldn't understand what sickness is he's been poor before he's been cast out before he had sorrow before even john is it 10 30 he said and jesus wept the almighty god cried he shared tears when his best friend of his best friend last rose died he cried because he had emotions just like you and i amen so when i go through emotional stress mental stress spiritual stress bodily stress he can feel you because he lives in your flesh amen by the feeling of your weaknesses of your infirmities and then come to your deliverance and bring you higher amen glory hallelujah so that was the man jesus christ the image of the man jesus christ on earth there's another picture and our arrival is something you understand why is barack you're showing us pictures we have the huffman picture here right here now this is another picture that uh hofsman's i think nephew painted of jesus christ and the disciples and that's the eastern the way they dress they wear ropes uh like choices wear ropes i mean they wear they have the inner garment and the ultra garment so that was the man jesus christ who was preaching on uh working in nazareth and judea and all the samaria and preaching the word of the lord that was the almighty god the fullness of christ was in him from uh adam to abraham they were portraying christ in parts and in bits like abraham was portraying christ in the form of faith isaac love jacob grace joseph perfection this man was the embodiment of all of them because he was the one that was powering that was feeding the corners amen but he was the fullness himself faith grace mercy love deliverance redemption eternity earth healing just name it you can be talking all day long right all those attributes list in him so he stepped here and he said i and my father are one if you see me you'll see my father jehovah the the jehovah of old testament who was worshiped who could come in the pill of fire so people will cry i mean moses we can't we can't encounter this this is too much just go listen to him and bring us the word now jehovah put himself bottled himself in a lot of flesh called jesus christ of nazareth who borrowed a woman to be born in now this jesus christ because it's eternity eternity can take any form that it wants to take eternity can't take any form like a dive and appear here it and it can preach to you like i'm preaching to you eternity can listen to the word like you are listening eternity can can't take any form it can come like like a dove like a wind like like like a computer it can't take any form because celestia is not limited it can come like any form like a jet plane do you know why sometimes and nasa and those scientists they call it ufo on identified flying object why they can't identify it i used to i bought when i was in uk i used to buy a book of uf and read and all of them said they couldn't they could see like a flight they thought it's maybe russia trying to spy on britain or america they tried to chase it they just disappear because celestial bodies can appear and disappear it's not restricted to foreigners of this building amen and that's the attribute that is who you are don't be restricted to this flesh amen this flesh is not your restriction this flesh can be 100 years old 120 140 whatever you're gonna drop it back to the cosmos but there's another flesh another blood no blood is fleshy blood but the blood is the holy spirit which can pass through walls who doesn't need to buy jet flight to fl to move to another country who doesn't need a vehicle to go back home after service who can just by thought you are in your house by thought your food is cooked already but i thought everything is done and now that thought in you want to express himself that even when you're sick sometimes you just by thinking your positive thinking the energy in you sometimes you don't even have to pray just by your thought coming from you bring the healing to your body bring the healing to your brother your sister your children because that being is in you it's not restricted to the weakness of this flesh amen and that being want to express himself and you just have to what yield to him and the more you yield to him he that is in you will take care of everything that you need amen glory hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord amen so now 1963 this man jesus christ took on another form he said over the years i don't want to go into church churches but we all know that the lord sent um serving messengers from paul he started with a covenant of grace and unconditional when he came on earth he has finished with the law the law has come to an end so he began with grace and he started with paul and we know paul was like we know his history he was a murderer he said look i'm the i'm the least of the apostles i'm not even worthy to call myself an apostle i'm not qualified to be a minister to preach to you but the lord by his grace because i what i wasted the church of the living god when they were killing stephen i was the one who took the you know like those times they had the outer garment and inner garment just like your your suit let them take your your outer coat for you so that you can really go into action throw the stone whip stephen is that our hours he didn't physically beat stephen to death but he did what we call in court aiding and albertan if you aid it means to help somebody or you push somebody or you conduct and connect with somebody to commit a crime you didn't personally commit a crime but you are part you are a criminal because it's your thought it's your ambition that was manifested in a person so we call it hidden and albertans so he was a criminal but the law did something when stephen was dying when the theophany of stephen was coming out he saw some supernatural which is beyond his theology which was beyond what gamaliel taught him which was beyond what the pharisees taught him which was beyond the law of moses which was beyond even what he has believed in moses which was the word of the lord and that's where all of us need to be you need to be go beyond believing the bible it's great to believe the bible that's the foundation the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom it's good to believe that prophet the prophet the lord sent to us willie abraham it's great to receive the prophet whoever you see the prophet receive the lord but then if you don't have jesus christ on the inside that one-on-one experience with the lord jesus christ it doesn't do you much good you'll be a fully educated message believer you'll be a fully educated a christian who knows the bible from cover to cover but there's no revelation of jesus christ from your inside out amen you'll be a theologian you'll be a christian jesus wasn't a i was a christian he was christ and the lord wants us to be christ christianity as a religion is just a covering religion means what covering i'm a muslim i'm a jewish i'm a christian i'm a hindu whatever i mean whatever so many buddhists i mean just name it i don't believe in nothing who don't believe in nothing atheist and this that is just a covering to put in a certain bracket but we are not talking about that we are talking about elohim the creator of heaven and earth living in your turn living in your flesh and manifesting himself out that is what makes you a christ not christian as a religion not a message believer you can bring the message but the message might not be in you you can know the bible here intellectually but the word the pill of fire when i'm talking about the word i'm not talking about scripts i'm not talking about english word and spanish word and and language is no the word is not a language no the word is not english it's not king james version it's not half man's version the word is life and that life is jesus christ is the celestial body the great theophany elohim el ella elohim in you manifesting himself in you so that people can see you without even talking they could see that there's christ in brother solomon because that is christ in sister virginia because of jesus christ and sister lois the christ in you is what makes the difference amen it's not what you pack up here you can pack religion here you can be so educated and proud like soul of tassels but you don't have nothing of jesus christ in you and that's why we have to know do i have christ in me and if you don't have a christ in you then you can't fulfill the law of god then it becomes a struggle it becomes like someone is pushing you if i don't do this they'll say this about me if i don't go to church oh my god is going to know i'm i'm sent from church if i don't do this oh people are going to if i do this who are going to watch me if people are not watching me i could do it but i probably my sisters are watching me no there's someone in you who speak to you my daughter go here do this don't do this go and tell this person this do this for me and that when you're working working one-on-one with the lord christ on the inside of you that is when you are on the right course with your maker amen blessed be the lord so let's see this man jesus christ in 1963 he picked another form he revealed himself let's go to um thank you my sister reveal there was a cloud supernatural cloud they used to call it the caption in the news um science magazine was called mystery clouds on arizona on the skies of in this case of arizona and they didn't know which what this cloud was so there was a prophet on the land called willie abraham and they brought a copy of this photograph he didn't take these pictures it was the scientists and people they captured it from u.s from mexico canada and certain places and so there was a cloud which was beyond where there was strange cloud or mystery cloud which was beyond where the natural cloud could form jet plane can go above the cloud but they can't go above setting police even astronauts which goes into outer space in the moon they can fly so high but this cloud was uh how 27 27 miles way above where the normal clouds are so they rather no they detected on their computers and they saw that no there's something strange so they captured it with pictures and different observatories and computer whatever at that time captured it but they couldn't find they saw it was something mysterious what is this and a carpet landed in brahms hands and he said turn it upside down when they turn it you could see the picture of jesus christ you could see his eyes right here you could see the pill of fire around him the pillow fires the angels is that all of you were there amen we were part of him how many were in christ let me ask you questions how many were in jesus christ before the foundation of the world all of us how many were jesus christ when was crucified on cavalry because the bible said that when blood and water came from me you and i came from him how many were in the cloud of arizona when he appeared in that mystery cloud sometimes it's easy for people to believe something that happened four thousand years ago oh yes i believe moses was the prophet of god i believe abraham was a son of god but this brother sullivan i don't know about brad solomon i don't know but brother but i smiley i don't know whether it's a son of god or not you could believe that abraham was a son of god abram that he didn't meet but you can't believe that smile is the son of god you can't believe the man is the daughter of god then there's some because man wants history it's already passed but then when the word is made flesh it takes only eagles to be able to to see to see and accept it but when is history and is done is religion and covering oh yes i believe the law i believe they love moses but it's gone and bygone in history but when the lord is made flesh that's when you can have life in it amen glory so this cloud the lord gave uh revelation and and certain things to his servant things that were hidden in the bible let's read uh i think revelation chapter one and let's see how scriptures fulfill in a very small way and people jump over it revelation one for the sake of time i'll jump to [Music] verse maybe let's start from the verse one but verse seven is where i really want to land on so verse one said the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servant things which might shortly come to pass and is sent and signified it by his angel onto his servant john verse two okay let's jump to verse verse six verse six sees and has if you go home you can read the rest of the verses and he has made us kings and priests unto god and his father to him be glory and dominion forever and ever so he has made you kings and what priests verse seven behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierce him and all kindreds of the earth shall well because of him even so amen versus said i'm out i'm alpha and omega the beginning and the end says the lord which is which was and which is to come the almighty so now john was caught in a vision and he saw he the lord showed him a lot of things and he saw the lord commit with clouds 1963 that prophecy became this day this scripture is fulfilled the lord came in a class of arizona not just a cloud supernatural himself and he allowed his photograph to be taken by computers to be detected so that you and i will see that the word that is sent to was prof to his prophet was he and amen it was vindication of what you are believing now what is in you now amen it's just like it's not different from when the lord appeared to a paul on his way to damascus to persecute the christians in those time they didn't have camera and it wasn't time for the lord to reveal himself in that manner to them yet so he allowed soul of soul of tassels to see him and he had a personal testimony and he preached to him and not only that he appeared to me in vision but this time because we are an intellectual age and it's also scripture has been fulfilled the lord allows his photograph to be taken in the supernatural form and if you look at the photograph we go back to the picture you could see the head and if you go back to the messages i'm not i'm just using this one as an application if the lord makes a way someday we speak on it but then you could see but ram talk about even the beard you could see his beard you could see his eyeballs you could see white awake and what was the white wig it's the supreme authority the whole universe there's no power there's no putin there's no uh joe biden there's no trump there's no president there's no queen of queen elizabeth the most powerful person is the lord jesus christ and he's also served as the most humble person on earth amen that's why the people that are jesus christ they are not proud they walk humbly but christ is on the inside of them amen jesus christ glory hallelujah amen god bless you amen glory hallelujah so they work humbly but they are jesus christ in flesh amen and you can see jesus christ in them they don't have to tell you you can receive in their smile we'll let you know that jesus christ is in this sister jesus christ is in this woman jesus christ and this brother jesus christ in this man because they are christ in manifestation amen oh glory hallelujah we are already sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus how many know the opposition if you know position you are in in you all the attributes in you in is in you out it's not outside in it's inside out [Music] just like the new breath the new breath doesn't come it's not like jesus christ scoop his scoop and come and jump and enter into seeing you before the foundation of the world but when your your mind gets to know that he's on the inside that gives you your new breath amen the rapture is in you the holy ghost is in you where is the rapture taking you to heaven who is in you jesus christ where did jesus christ leave heaven he was only using this flesh when he's down with it he break it down to the cosmos and then he manifests right here at the other side they are sent here there are people watching us here they are not of this dimension they don't have flesh and blood they are flesh and blood is the celestial flesh and blood which you call the theophany the celestial body these our loved ones are here they are not somewhere in a physical distance they are right here amen oh my i don't know how to even explain it i don't want to go away from my salmon glory hallelujah to the lord when brother brahms says mother-in-law sister amides mother died and his wife was sad of course losing your mother is not a joke it's like a part of your heart has been taken away from you when you've lost a loved one before and you missed then you laughed and she was crying say oh pull me down i wish you could see she wasn't me to see what he was singing he said her mother is right there looking at her own the body the flesh she used living in she was standing right there her theophany was standing right there looking at their body being laid in a casket she had an experience in their flesh body that you and i were but when you finish you draw that experience and the celestial body in you take it to the other side so all that we are going through you are packing the word packing experience testimonies miracles the word upon the word and the word upon their word and they see the water upon the word and manifestation of wonder manifestation that experience will not be negated when you finish your life here that experience is taking the celestial body in you you will tell this body just like your clothes you're wearing after you go from here you don't go to the kitchen with this clothes when you go home say okay you you did a good job at the church but i need to be at the kitchen i need to cook for my children for their sisters i need to get something to eat so you want you you you take it away from you you if it's dead you throw in the in in a what you call it um laundry bag it doesn't mean you are dead your clothes is footing the laundry back by you yourself it's working at the kitchen preparing food for your children maybe the brothers maybe you want to surprise your wife preparing food for your wife and your children or being at the restaurant so when we leave this earthly tabernacle we are not dead christians do not die they change dimensions they swap clothing they swap garment but they do not die death do not pertain to you so brother people are dead people are in the mug no if he's a christian he's not dead he just laid his garment down but he or she herself is working right there in a higher body amen a body that cannot cry anybody that cannot have arthritis a body that cannot have blood pressure a body that can offer a coronavirus a body that cannot be sick a body that cannot be hungry anybody that cannot own mortgage and rent a body that doesn't need american dollars a body that is celestia a body that walks in can walk through the walls and that is who you are amen glory hallelujah so glory hallelujah let's look at another another one of the pictures so please show me that one which is green that is even more clearer this is the lord captured and you were there 1963. it wasn't remember where we already said uh hebrews 12 cloud of witness the lord himself and all the sons and daughters of god even those who are not born i wasn't born in 1963 some of some probably might be born already we're here on earth but some of us were on the other side but wherever the lord goes like a king entourage the subject go with him so we work with him on the other side before even we picked this our sistine element to live in it we were in the mystery cloud people saw us as club but there was a picture of a solomon but a troy sister sister my sisters and my brothers here and all the body of christ we were all there in that little cloud glory hallelujah we were in him before the foundation of the world where him on calvary where him on 63 clouds and we are still in him and he seen us amen is the same lord jesus christ we are eternal being so he wanted to you know you don't you can't remember it's just like prove to me do you remember when we were in the lord before the foundation of the world no this mind is finite right it's just a little little little little something here it can think so far our eyes can't see so far but there's an unseen eyes there's celestial being that remembers everything amen look at william let me for example but abram's daughter who died sharon rosharon at six months or two years less than two years when william brown went to the other side he was crying the lord wanted to comfort him he broke into the other side and was wearing his american heart he saw a young lady and just like his age group so he took took off his heart and greeted the lady said dad welcome said dad i mean we honestly how can i be your father when we are all the same is like 21 22 24 he said that you don't know where you are this is heaven he said i am your i'm your rosharan on earth and william ram was quickened rosharan you've gone to be a beautiful lady how he said this is heaven this is what you preach and mommies in the home would you say home perhaps a drunkard and they died drinking i don't have we have vagabonds you don't have a home say here you have a home and the the chair who wanted to you wanted to buy you couldn't buy it it was right there his dog was right there his uh donkey horse was right there old fries and old charlie were right there his loved ones were gathered with him over there if the lord gave willem ram his dogs and his dog and donkey horse how much more your loved ones your children your husband your brother your cousin your friends if animals were represented there they have to finally put it that way the lord gave them to you fun because there are some things that are dear to you how much more your children your grandchildren your friends you already there don't worry about what you see them now they have a see they have a representation and the representation is what the lord is looking up to amen glory hallelujah and yes another one the blue supernatural cloud formed by seven angels scientists gave them so many names but now i want to jump to i want i don't want to take too much time so i don't want to do too much reading we so now those were the clouds now this cloud remember i told you jesus of 63 as we showed with hoffman's head of christ 63 yes we believe that was christ came not a picture but jesus christ came on earth to do the redemption story but yes it doesn't benefit me and you if he doesn't he's not living on the inside of me no matter how you claim you're a christian yes i believe in christianity i don't believe in islam or uh i'm not an atheist i believe there's god let me send you to one scripture uh acts chapter 19 verse one to five so paul was preaching with his disciples and he came across another preacher apolos who was preaching jesus christ this time to mention the name jesus christ could land you in death or in jail or weapon it's not just a pain they whip you with animal skin which is dried rope and when they whip you use blood will be oozing out of your body that was the kind of weapon paul and co went through so to mention the name jesus christ not that i believe in jesus christ but mention jesus christ means you and your family you you are mentioned that name we heard your daughter talking about jesus christ do you believe in jesus christ you have to make a quick decision because you could face death and those times they don't care it's demons they could rape pregnant women and they would tell the husband to laugh if you don't laugh they do the same thing to you that was what they went through but the lord anointed them with a spirit of a lion a lion is a feastless animal a lion can go through anything it doesn't have nothing like a fear no it's not part of his life so the lord gave even the women the children that anointed that they went through death they just transitioned to the other side without being afraid of the name jesus christ so paul met this man gentleman and was preaching that jesus christ was the lord that the jewish people and the romans crucified so paul asked him that hey brought you up the holy ghost and he said holy ghost what is that i don't know what you're talking about and supporting that oh okay how are you baptized he said i was baptized with john baptism by emission from uh uh from from your sin baptism in water doesn't take your son but it's a good question and john baptized onto emotion so we did it i was baptized so okay remember john said that there's one greater than himself and he was the lord jesus christ the almighty god he will not just baptize you by mentioning water but he'll baptize you with what with fire and burning you can marry a woman have a fantastic wedding spend about 10 billion dollars on the wedding buy 25 100 carat gold at the cost of 25 million dollars for that wedding if after the wedding don't put your life in the woman that is not a marriage because the life has to be the woman to bring your image and the woman's image so if the lord the what baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ just a wedding you are accepted the lord jesus christ jesus christ you want him to be your lord and your husband so you're taking your name off and your nature of lord i don't want my nature i want you to be my lord i don't want to walk the world to control me i don't want satan to control me i want you to be my masterpiece but then when you are baptized when you have your wedding the pastor baptizes you in the a river or lake or whatever pool and he gives you a baptism certificate and the lord jesus christ doesn't put his life in you one-on-one you are not married to him you're only trying to bear his name call yourself a christian a believer but alive the gem life is not there and that is where i want us to land amen so let's go to um let me see let's read i think i'll skip some of my readings let's read um evidence of the um crisis the mystery of god revealed it's in one of my powerpoints but you can pull it it's paragraph two two three christ is the mystery of god revealed grace 2 3 3 say look christ in you makes him the center of life of the revelation c christ life in you makes him the center of the revelation christ in the bible makes the bible the complete revelation of jesus of christ christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing and i want you to take your time and absorb this and i'll go over again look when prophet said behold when you read the bible and the the lord when you read he said behold look it means something of utter utmost important importance so look christ in you makes him the center of life of the revelation so when christ is in you it makes him christ the almighty the center of life of his revelation when it's on the inside of you christ life in you which is christ himself in you makes him the center of the revelation christ in the bible when you bring the bible it makes the bible the complete revelation of christ in other words when we talk about the attribute the masterpieces uh the the building the lord was the attribute from abraham and all the prophets and all the women in the bible without christ it's just an empty bible so it's christ which makes the bible complete whether it's the old testament new testament or present day now he said christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing the bible christ and you the whole thing and see what is the new breath you say well but abraham what is the new birth it is the revelation of jesus christ personally to you and i want us to absorb that it is not being a church member it does not say that oh i belong to this church it is not to be a good person i don't drink i don't smoke i don't cast those are good as a human being nobody was born drinking and casting with cigarette on his mouth if a mother has a child and the child has got cigarette on their child's mouth maybe the mother would throw the child away and i mean i'll give it to the midwife and said i don't want to don't tell nobody that that was my child you can let somebody adopt this child i don't want to be named this child has got a cigarette on his mouth or marijuana on his mouth or crack cocaine crystal in his hands i don't want nothing to do with this child so nobody was born with with those stuff in our hands so if you don't do them glory hallelujah amen but those those things not doing them that do not make you a christian not drinking no smoking makes you a good social person so was a good social person uh the rich young ruler in the bible who came to jesus christ asking for he was kind of bargaining with the lord jesus christ and the lord saw him he said i mean he wanted to eternal life he came to the lord with a question and said you know the law he took him to the law he said with the law from abraham all the way from adam to moses i've obeyed all the law and the bible said jesus christ knew he was sincere and he loved him for that for keeping himself clean not drinking no smoking but that didn't give him eternal life eternal life is accepting the word for your day encountering the lord jesus christ one-on-one so he said go and sell all that you have not the physical riches but he had spiritual riches he was a holy man righteous man he was somebody with a noble character he had a testimony in society but i said that is still a bad garbage throw it away and come and accept that word but that was too heavy for him he couldn't accept it if you can accept the word that is being preached to you if you cannot say being born again that regardless of who you are the old life that came through your mother you came through your the laws of your dad and your mom womb that life will not take you today the other side you need another life a baptism a quickening condition a new breath the old person has to die in you baptism is death when you die then you get buried so that's why when you go to baptize it's a symbol of you being buried in the water another supernaturally not the first cow the humans product but the old person the whole being the old nature they also dies and christ comes in in you already in the seed form quicken your body but then god requires your will if you give your world to him he'll do that for you amen a man cannot just say that oh i love this woman you just you don't even wait for the one to say yes okay you grab the woman and go and have a wedding and live with her no it doesn't happen that way the one has a wall she can say yes or no you can go away i don't want you so christ is a gentleman he's a husband looking for a wife and he wants you to accept him or reject him amen you can't be in between you can be a holy you can be a sober drunk person you have to be drunk or sober you have to be christ or not a christ it's not being belonging to a tabernacle or i belong to this tabernacle that doesn't that is just a church amen but god is not looking for a church he's looking for you personally he's looking for me personally that's why he said that brother what is the new birth it is the revelation of jesus christ personally to you not you joined a church you shook a hand you done something different you said a creed you promised to live by a code of rules but christ the bible he's the word that was revealed to you and no matter what anybody sees what takes place is christ pastor priest whatever it might be it's christ in you that is the revelation of that that is the revelation that the church was built upon amen let me read another quotation from here separation from unbelief paragraph where's my paragraph okay start i start with if if you were lying down grasping gasping for your breath i don't have the coach here but uh maybe you can use my um my powerpoint if if you find a code find if you don't find it yeah let's do the powerpoint is that if you were lying down grasping or gasping for life death rattles in your throat 50 doctors standing around you he's going he's going out to god in the next five minutes he's living now and now in your heart you believe jesus christ had healed you that wouldn't bother you a bit just as sure as there's god in heaven you come out of it yes sir cause god's duty he's god to keep his word and you will never know what christ or what the word is until first the holy spirit has personally revealed it to you in your heart then you know that jesus is the lord when your heart says so not when your knowledge says so when your heart says so then that's when you know it amen when your heart can see something in you when the word is being preached your your heart accepted your what your your heart says amen not your mind or if i don't say am in the preacher the preacher man will think i don't believe the word that is intellectual amen for me i don't care whether you say i mean or not i mean i don't preach based on amen preaching what is the man on the inside preaches out amen but then when the evil is coming from the christ on the inside and that is when it makes a difference when you do things from the inside out not from here this guy here the devil can deceive you that's what mankind we came into what we were in but when the man on the inside the lord jesus christ himself takes over your heart you give it to him all your heart all your mind your body your soul that whatever you you are and you have it's not for you it's for the man jesus christ to reveal his character to express the eternal attribute in you then the lord takes over your life and everything become different amen and i'm going to tell you a little listen for for us parents uh as we see the society is this out just something a story not a story something a word of wisdom the lord put upon my heart to share with you there's a saying one let me read that quote quotation and then i think that might be my last quotation and then i'll go ahead and tell the word of wisdom let's read a quotation from a nigerian writer called chinuachibi and that's on the ninth into um okay here we go is that any any kid the bird says that since that since men have learned to shoot without mason he has learned to fly without preaching and he wrote in a book called things for things fall apart now we're going to use this one the lord gave me a wisdom for children amen many many our parents have got children now the world that we are living in the world is full of wisdom knowledge technology devices destruction hell we know when the seas were open the bible the prophet told us that how many demons if you read the book of revelation demons from who were bound yeah they were bound now that was they were not in operation demons and officers capable to put them in jail but the lord put them in a position where they don't operate on men and women but now when the services were revealed when the lord fullness of christ was revealed the same time hell is like a in a bucket the lead was open and those demons jump on the earth so now they can operate on human beings operate on everybody president whatever from the pope whoever they can operate on any person so that's why we see the word going there well let me go back to the prophet's time prophet time was talking about homosexualism and so forth but they said even in government they were doing it it's not even parents i have letters here parents are crying their children are becoming gays and lesbians but he never talked about he will even talk about school they teach them children how to have sex and to be productive but they never talk about school children being taught to be gays and lesbians now they have books in england they have books which sometimes they try to get before they cover they get children to go for a trip and during those those trips they teach the children how to accept that you can have your mother and father being a brother john cena mrs johnson the same person a man and a man can be your father and your mother or a woman a woman can be your mother and a mother mother and father which is pervasion of nature so that's where we have come to and as the writer said that the best land at hunters learn how to shoot without missing their target what did the best do they learn to fly without perching on trees for the hunter to shoot them amen the lord has given us wisdom to combat the antichrist pray don't look at antichrist as pope john paul i mean or whatever pope francis antichrist is a spirit any person that is not born again is antichrist if i should put in his plain weights if christ is not the inside turns out you might do good things but have you seen the lizard the lizard the physicist of eliza is black and white he's got a white feces and the black comes out so if you don't if you don't have the new breath your works will be good and bad it's true of knowledge of good and bad it doesn't mean you do all bad things or you do all good things but good and bad isn't it but when the holy ghost takes over your life you move from the tree of knowledge of good and evil to tree of life you are not operating on knowledge that oh this is good i shouldn't go and fight because if i fight no it's not good the church will hear i'm fighting but i'll cook with a fighter no no no no it's not on the inside of me to do that but when i didn't have the holy ghost i had i'm left-handed and sometimes i could get mad i have to pocket put my mind in my in my pocket and hold it frame praying that i wouldn't use this left hand and i used it a couple times so when the holy ghost is not there you don't have the control tower to control you you can't even control your own self you can't control your flesh but when the holy ghost comes and the lord tried me when i had the holy ghost oh my goodness i was tried and said where's my i still have my left hand but i couldn't use it it's like peter peter was able to slay someone say yes but when he was born again when they were crucified and said oh you know this this is not the pita you guys knew you knew me you couldn't arrest me your ears would be gone already but the holy ghost on the inside said look don't worry i'm not afraid to die just tell me upside down i don't want to die the way my cries i'm not worthy of him you crucify him upright tell me absolutely and crucify me that wasn't the peter that wasn't the old simon that someone died amen there's a new peter in him who is the lord jesus christ else you couldn't i mean venture go your ears already gone you try again your head will be off but the new breath makes the difference the holy ghost baptism so the lord gave me a word of wisdom for parents that parents should have spiritual time with their children what we preach here they have celestial beings they are celestial been understand but their natural mind do not understand most of the things we preach because we don't have time to break it down to the children's level so when our parents you have the duty to take the same word that by the job preach brother smiley and all the ministers preach and go and break it down to your children and every i'm going to give you something i'll give you a guideline as to how you do it that uh children go to school thank god on coach thank god for the covet they don't go to school as much like they used to go sometimes they spend much a lot of time in school learning certain things that you didn't teach them but it's cool put it in them and they will be children are like garden like a land or plant you can fertilize the land plant whatever you want on the land you want to plant mango whatever cocoa palm tree whatever tomato plant on the land and pour whatever fertilizer and nutrients you want the way you want it you can plant whatever soils and nutrients to come up so the children are like a garden school put things in them now don't worry about school because because of coffee pork they don't go to school but a cell phone internet youtube google what else uh icloud just name it uh twitter whatever right they put stuff in them that you didn't put in them god didn't put in them and sometimes a certain age they don't react they don't react upon that but when they get to certain age of accountability then they'll start begin to manifest and say why didn't put this in my son i didn't put in my daughter why is it manifesting so it's good as parents as you do every obligation work and feed them go to school to give them careers but the most important career is what god chose for them so have a time with your son maybe take him not the place that he used to not in the living room even though if you have time not in the house take your son or your daughter outside a park maybe both parents and tell your son that you're not in trouble you haven't done anything wrong but you just want to go and talk and when you go ask him that to pray with him as praying pray first and let your son or your daughter know that you have a purpose on this earth you came through the loins of me and your mother but your true mother and father is the lord jesus christ and as a parent we have to connect you to him and you have to give your world to him now there's something called holy ghost baptism new breath baptism in the name of jesus christ that is the most important thing you need to have in your life we can buy you clothes work and bloat mansions for you both companies for you that when you get old you can take over or whenever you can take over or save for you billions of dollars for you it will not benefit you a dime if you don't have christ on the inside so as my child i want to pray with you and i want you to have the desire to ask the lord to come and live on the inside of you to take over your life because like i said as the they asked the hunter begin to shoot without missing what do you have to do you have to fly without preaching you have to go to go about five times what you need to do as a parent to get your children to where the the things of the world will not even tempt them anymore and let go back to the bible like moses remember the moses story when he was born he was privileged to be raised by his mother his mother and even being paid for it their mother took advantage and planted the seed in him that hey moses beware you are not an egyptian always the mother will tell him you are never an egyptian yes you have been privileged to become a pharaoh to be but always know that your people are the people who are the mad davis and you were born a deliverer before you were born your dad used to pray when you come from work he doesn't eat i call your dad amram your food is really said no i'm going to pray today we're whipped things are getting worse they don't even give a straw to to to to do their job we have to go get our own straw i can't eat your father i'll go upstairs and go and pray go to the antique and go and pray and when the angel of the lord came that amram you and joakibet you're going to have a son who delivered israel from egypt so you were born as a deliverer you are not a pharaoh and moses yes though it was intellectual but it was printed on his heart it was imprinted on his heart that even in his mystic he was trying to do the things of the lord he ended up killing but he had in him that he know he was a deliverer no matter how he went that thing was inside him that a man planted on him so it was so strong that he couldn't take that in for moses he didn't know how to go about it but the lord so the lord called him to the back side of the desert and gave him what he needed to have and i said parents let's be like a jokey bed plant the seed in your children because the word we are in the word is just looking for your child spirits they are here search on their cell phone when they go to school practically take their cell phone and run through and see what is on their cell phone protectly take their school bags and when they another run through their school box see what is on the school bag set do a search because the lord has given that child to you as your responsibility to raise them like samuel someone was raised until that time god began to use him he didn't know who he was he know he was born as a promised child be in the house of ally but there was a time god began to use him so as parents it's your responsibility to put whatever you need to put in a child don't wait to the child become an adolescent or teenager i know science even said that the smartest time a person is when is he or she's three years old their brain is way up here they absorb things they see things you don't think they know they might not see it verbally but it's important in their heart and in their mind so when you plant the right seed in them don't spend time just cooking for them and talking to them about school and teaching them that is good but pray with them if your child is sleeping you the father or mother wake up go to your bedside neither and pray for him once he or she is sleeping that's the word of the lord the lord give it for you if you want to write it down pray for your children when they are even on their bed not only when they are going to school every if you can do it every day dude every day if you work and you think you are busy we can find a day that is my child when his father sleeping and snoring you the mother of father go and pray lay your hands on them and pray for them and have a child and son or child and daughter time holy spirit whatever you want to dab at spiritual time take him out of the place and go talk to him because when you talk to him away from in home it's going to be normal because he's used to the home don't take it if you've got more than one child don't take two of them together find time let's see if you want to do it this month find if you want to even do the same thing take this one because we have what they call transfer of responsibility if you take junior and his younger sister alicia with you when you're talking to them junior is thinking you're talking to alicia eliza's thinking about talking to junior okay it's for you abigail it's not for million dollars always for you uh linda is not for me but then when parents are talking to just only one he knows whatever is coming from parents coming to her or him directly and you pray over them wrap up scriptures over them and don't wait teach them certain things you as a parent because certain things children don't learn from their parents they learn from school and all bad friends teach them when they get certain to them about themselves as a young girl adolescent age coming up about how how she was born is part of life let your child know how she was born let your son know how he's born but you wait until the lord give you a husband or wife before you do that you plant that seed in him or her that you are a holy child the lord has given you to us to nurture you is going to use you you've got so many bible characters so many people your own example your experiences you could share with them that if you stay with the lord it's a blessing it's not about worldly materials what the materials you can get all of them you are never happy people commit suicide in uh uh stars superstars in movie stars and sports stars and whatever they take their life they've got billions of dollars and millions of dollars is so dead american president it will buy you something but it doesn't fulfill their soul their heart so teach the children and plant them so every month if you can do it every man fine if you can do it every three month bingo whatever it works for you but at least a year half at least four times of you and one on one both parents or if one parent talk to your child about holy ghost about your purpose on this earth so when you take them you tell them you pray we are praying for you we want you to pray as the lord just like samuel samuel committed his her mother his mother committed him to the lord in the house of eli and the priest told him how to pray so someone need to pray he was born as a prophet the pill of fire showed up when he was born but then he has to have an experience william brown had a pill of fire coming to his room when he was born but that didn't didn't do him good until he has his own experience so it doesn't matter how holy and righteous your parents are you don't automatically become righteous because your parents are holy and righteous no you have to have your own righteousness we cannot impart into a children that i'm holding my child you have to take your own decision so you help the child to take the decision even at the age of three they have the they know things and the lord deals with children so when the parents bring them speak those spiritual ways to them they remember it forever i remember my dad and my mom used to take me to a park and they told me like god has a purpose for you you the holy ghost is what the lord wants god want to use your vessel your vest is not for drinking and smoking and all the foolishness you see around you but you are the temple of the lord i didn't understand but now it makes sense to me thank god thank the lord for my even when you are not here your children some of us talk about our great grandparents parents who did certain things for us and god is with children amen let me use an example me standing here at the age of about let's say 10 to 12. i wasn't born in united states i was born in ghana africa and i was playing soccer with my friends we call it soccer in africa and i was wearing a t-shirt with with wisconsin was a wisconsin at the back and i remember as a red t-shirt with white white sleeves and i remember i was used to dribble we call it dribbling and my friends were giving me fans and by inspiration something told me that you spent part of your life in the united states at the age of 10 or 12 between 10 and 12. it wasn't my parents but that thing was in me and i as i grew i knew that i was going to spend part of my life in the u.s and now as i grew i know that it's more about the gospel the lord used my natural profession to bring me here but it's more about the gospel of jesus christ amen so your children don't think they are too young the prophets are if they are not too young for the devil to use them they are not too young for the lord to use them when i was in texas one parent the daughter was around eight years old and the brother said brother my daughter want to she said she want to get baptized but i think she's too young she's even got a song i said brother you should be thankful to the lord she's eight years old he's got a song she wants to sing to the lord come on let the pastor come let let i mean you're gonna baptize your daughter and she got baptized so teach them about don't just feed them don't just give them computer games to play those things makes their brain work so fast but let them read read to them their bible tell them bible stories pray over them and let them also pray sometime let your children prove by the meal so that they what is in them will come out let them recite scriptures ask them what the minister preached what did they get from it so that you are questioning their spiritual mind because sometimes we lose those mind on fertilize and then the world fertilizes for us so we have to be proactive we have to go ahead of the devil before even he would think they
