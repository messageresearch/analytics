[29:34] god said
[29:37] oh jesus
[29:42] yesterday i was asked to come and
[29:45] pray for someone and
[29:49] i got there they were
[29:52] just going through some things in their
[29:54] body and then their mind
[29:57] and they were telling me that they they
[29:58] could feel when the enemy was
[30:01] attacking them they could just feel it
[30:03] you know it was coming up you know
[30:06] so if you can feel when the devil is
[30:08] actually attacking you then you can
[30:10] speak to that devil
[30:11] [Music]
[30:14] i'll say because the bible tells us that
[30:17] if we
[30:18] resist the devil
[30:23] and that that mean that that don't mean
[30:25] fight with him
[30:26] you understand just resist
[30:30] a little push the bible say he'll flee
[30:33] and and i said you know if you just
[30:35] resist the devil he'll flee
[30:37] you know and um and i say now
[30:40] how have you been resisting the devil
[30:42] and they really didn't have an answer i
[30:43] said okay i'm gonna give you a a a
[30:45] solution
[30:46] of how to resist the devil when he's
[30:48] attacking your body just say this say by
[30:50] his stripes
[30:52] i am healed
[30:55] so just keep saying that over and over
[30:57] again says like the doctor giving you 30
[30:58] pills
[30:59] for 30 days and you take the same pill
[31:02] every day
[31:03] and watch it produce the result by his
[31:05] stripes i am healed
[31:07] so when you start feeling the devil
[31:09] coming upon you just by his stripes iron
[31:11] hill
[31:11] by his stripes i'm healed by his stripes
[31:14] i'm here saying i'm gonna add a little
[31:15] bit more
[31:16] tell the devil i ain't gonna accept this
[31:20] i'm not accepting this by his stripes
[31:23] i'm healed
[31:24] add a little bit more i'm not accepting
[31:26] this by his stripes i'm healed
[31:29] hallelujah and just a little resistance
[31:32] will actually
[31:33] bring victory in your situation i don't
[31:35] care what you're facing this morning you
[31:36] can resist the devil
[31:38] and he'll flee hallelujah to the lamb of
[31:42] god
[31:43] but i just thank the lord it's been a a
[31:46] blessed amen service thus far and i'm
[31:48] looking forward to all that god has in
[31:50] store for us from today
[31:51] uh god is god is god is moving church
[31:55] god is god is moving in our midst
[31:57] sometimes
[31:59] we don't get a chance to hear all that
[32:00] god is doing and
[32:02] and uh you know a few weeks ago i was
[32:04] invited to
[32:05] join 8 o'clock
[32:10] discussion in the book of revelation
[32:12] [Music]
[32:14] there's some brothers that they get up
[32:16] eight o'clock every morning
[32:17] from the west coast to the east coast
[32:19] and they gather on the telephone and
[32:20] just
[32:21] and they talk about the book of
[32:22] revelation and you know just things like
[32:24] that and
[32:26] i was asked to to join and i said okay
[32:29] let me let me see what this is all about
[32:30] and
[32:31] i said i don't know if i can do this
[32:32] seven days a week this might be a little
[32:34] tough but
[32:35] i'll do what i can as i just begin to
[32:38] um join in and just listen and hear you
[32:41] know the different
[32:42] different ones just sharing uh i said
[32:44] well
[32:45] i'll tell you what this song said let me
[32:46] let me get a little bit more information
[32:48] about this group
[32:49] you know that that i'm asked to maybe
[32:51] even speak in
[32:52] some time they want me to speak so i
[32:54] said well let me just see about
[32:56] this and i call one of the brothers a
[32:58] pastor there that i knew that was
[32:59] involved i said just give me some
[33:01] background on this group
[33:02] please i'm trying to understand some
[33:04] things
[33:05] and they say well there was a brother
[33:08] brother ernie villanueva who came here
[33:11] and preached right before the pandemic
[33:13] struck so brother ernie had been
[33:16] witnessing to a man
[33:17] for for 10 years 10 years he witnessed
[33:20] to him and
[33:21] it just seemed like this man was not
[33:23] going to accept the word he was a
[33:25] pentecostal preacher but just seemed
[33:26] like he would not accept the word he
[33:27] just kept witnessing for 10 years
[33:29] with him and said one day the man
[33:31] finally said you know what
[33:33] i accept it this has got to be the truth
[33:35] you know and uh
[33:37] and he was a pentecostal pastor he took
[33:39] the message
[33:40] and uh and and you know god had blessed
[33:42] him in his business and everything and
[33:44] you know just
[33:45] doing very well but after he accepted
[33:47] the message about a year
[33:48] later he found himself uh kind of mixed
[33:52] up in some
[33:53] uh investment that went wrong
[33:57] right and uh and when it went wrong
[33:59] since he was
[34:00] since his name and his money was tied up
[34:02] in there they caused him to take the
[34:04] fall
[34:05] so here he is in prison you know because
[34:08] of a bad investment but he goes
[34:10] with the message in hand to prison
[34:14] and while he's in prison um you know he
[34:17] has all of his books and things there
[34:19] and he puts them in the library for
[34:21] anybody that might want to get a hold of
[34:22] a book they can get it and read it and
[34:24] and all of that so there was a a
[34:27] situation come up in the jail that
[34:28] somebody
[34:30] got killed a fight broke out and
[34:31] somebody got killed so they put the
[34:33] entire jail on lockdown and uh so this
[34:36] other
[34:37] gentleman said you know what we're going
[34:38] on lockdown that means three days we
[34:40] can't come out these cells he said i
[34:41] gotta go to the library and get myself a
[34:43] book
[34:44] uh to read while i'm in this lockdown
[34:48] so when he went to the library he went
[34:49] and got himself the church age book
[34:54] i'm talking about in jail
[34:55] [Music]
[34:57] and for three days he read the church
[34:59] book church age book all the way through
[35:01] he said
[35:02] he said oh my goodness so after after
[35:04] the lockdown he said
[35:05] who brought this book to the library
[35:09] and he went and met this brother that
[35:10] brother ernie had been witnessing to for
[35:12] 10 years
[35:14] so they began to go through the church
[35:15] ace book and just have little studies
[35:17] there in jail
[35:19] and uh evangelist this man that was on
[35:21] lockdown that got the church but he
[35:22] actually got transferred out of that
[35:24] particular jail
[35:25] took a church his book with him met
[35:27] somebody else in the next jail that he
[35:29] was in
[35:30] and uh and start talking with that
[35:31] person about the church ages
[35:33] and uh so both of them end up getting
[35:36] out of jail so they started this little
[35:38] group where they get together on the
[35:39] phone every morning
[35:40] and just go through the book of
[35:41] revelations they just read a chapter
[35:43] share what they what they get out of it
[35:45] and then they turn it over to a couple
[35:46] brothers
[35:47] uh they ask brother tim calhoun and
[35:50] brother jason watkins just to share
[35:52] their thoughts on
[35:52] different things out of the church ages
[35:54] so brother tim said we're looking for a
[35:56] third brother to join us brother jack i
[35:57] see
[35:58] we'll see you know but uh but the lord
[36:01] just so had it yesterday morning
[36:03] uh none of the other brothers could do
[36:04] it so i jumped in and just you know gave
[36:06] him a lesson
[36:07] you know on the church ages and and the
[36:09] same thing that we've been doing here i
[36:11] time you know luther and wesley and amen
[36:14] pentecost back over to the life of
[36:15] samson
[36:16] you know and and as i was just looking
[36:19] at it it just kind of
[36:20] moved me because uh there's some
[36:21] different quotes there where brother
[36:23] branham said
[36:24] uh uh the the false church got their
[36:27] revival first
[36:28] it says this in in the uh in the seals
[36:30] see the first false church got their
[36:32] revival first and when you really
[36:33] studied
[36:34] amen uh revelation chapter two that was
[36:37] the seeds of the false church that was
[36:39] that was going there and it came to full
[36:40] maturity in the dark ages
[36:42] volunteering praise the lord say but but
[36:45] he says uh
[36:46] they got their their their first three
[36:48] ages you know ephesus
[36:50] and and and smyrna and pergamos that was
[36:52] the false church coming to full maturity
[36:54] inside here
[36:55] say but then in sardis things was about
[36:58] to change
[36:59] the true church was about to get its
[37:01] revival
[37:03] hallelujah and that's where we are now
[37:05] we are and we are in revival whether you
[37:07] feel it or not
[37:08] we are still in revival because we are
[37:10] revived by the word of god
[37:13] amen the truth of the word of god
[37:16] hallelujah so you know we just i said
[37:18] and when you look at scripture
[37:19] the revival to the true church actually
[37:21] happened in revelation 3.
[37:24] so the false church in revelation 2 but
[37:26] the true church revelation 3
[37:28] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so we
[37:31] had a little fellowship amen around
[37:33] these things yesterday morning and
[37:35] and this morning i come here to prayer
[37:37] and i get up from prayer and i got to
[37:38] text me brother jack would you share
[37:40] this morning i said my god i
[37:41] had time to get nothing so i but by
[37:44] god's grace
[37:45] amen somebody else stepped up and uh and
[37:47] took it but
[37:48] y'all just pray for me my the primary
[37:50] reason they got me involved in this is
[37:52] because there was a brother
[37:53] that is in fort lauderdale that's been a
[37:56] part of this group for
[37:58] a number of months and uh they want him
[38:00] to know that there's a church that he
[38:01] can come fellowship
[38:02] at amen so i said well yes i will
[38:05] certainly be a part of this and
[38:07] we'll do what we can just to win some
[38:09] souls you know just to get people in
[38:11] fellowship so
[38:12] the lord is good he's moving all the
[38:14] time amen he's moving
[38:16] all the time uh i think i got a prayer
[38:19] request here that i want to just make
[38:20] mention of brother
[38:21] garen sent this to me um this morning
[38:25] he's asking prayer for his mother um
[38:29] she's been dealing with a situation
[38:32] uh that they say the doctors are really
[38:35] they don't know what it is they say they
[38:36] contributed to stress
[38:38] and water pills um
[38:41] and uh and something uh something that's
[38:44] starting to get into her eyes
[38:46] it's like blood that's getting into her
[38:48] eyes and
[38:49] uh so they he just asked for prayer for
[38:52] his mom he sent me a picture
[38:53] and everything and and she certainly
[38:55] just needs our prayers that god would
[38:57] just touch her
[38:58] in her body amen and we want to we want
[39:01] to offer prayer for
[39:02] for her so just bow your heads with me

[39:07] in the precious name of the lord jesus
[39:10] on behalf of brother garren's mom and
[39:13] lord this
[39:14] blood condition whatever it is that the
[39:16] doctors really can't figure out
[39:18] they're saying stress and we all have
[39:20] stress we
[39:21] we have that whether it's positive or
[39:23] negative but lord water pills
[39:25] they're not sure what it is but father
[39:28] you know what it is it's a devil
[39:30] that is attacking her and father we come
[39:33] as the sons and daughters of god making
[39:36] our request
[39:37] known that you would bring healing to
[39:39] her body
[39:40] that lord she would see a miracle on her
[39:43] behalf
[39:43] and god through this miracle may uh her
[39:46] heart be drawn closer to you father
[39:49] may she realize that it's not man that
[39:51] did it but it's god almighty that did it
[39:53] so
[39:54] in between her condition and she as a
[39:56] patient we place the blood of jesus
[39:58] christ
[39:59] for you were wounded for her
[40:00] transgressions you would bruise for her

[54:23] time ago that one of the prophet went to
[54:25] a situation
[54:26] and he asked them to sing a song because
[54:28] their song created an atmosphere
[54:30] even the song itself cast away demons so
[54:33] when you are sick
[54:34] even the song alone when you move into

[55:12] let's probably do one two five
[55:15] to say the background matthew chapter 1
[55:21] verse 1 to 5 to give a background of how
[55:23] jesus christ came to earth
[55:26] coming from brokenness taking lives of
[55:28] brokenness
[55:29] and he came through it those lives to be
[55:32] the redeemer amen
[55:35] so matthew chapter one verse one to
[55:39] five or let's say six will be enough
[55:43] the book of generation of jesus christ
[55:45] the son of david and i want you to take
[55:47] note the son of david
[55:48] of course we know that jesus wasn't born
[55:50] by flesh of man
[55:51] jesus was the spoken word son of god
[55:54] he was god himself who battled himself
[55:57] in the womb of mary
[55:59] it wasn't the blood of mary it wasn't
[56:01] the genetics of mary or
[56:03] joseph but it was god's own genetic the
[56:06] genetics of elohim
[56:07] but he borrowed the womb of mary because
[56:10] he wanted to be a human being he has to
[56:12] come through
[56:12] a man sorry he has to come through a
[56:14] womb to be a redemption
[56:16] he has to come through the blast system
[56:17] he has to come through a tribe
[56:19] a family so we want to trace the
[56:21] genealogy of jesus christ
[56:23] where he came from so matthew 1 and
[56:25] verse 1
[56:26] go in the book of generation of jesus
[56:28] christ the son of david son of abraham
[56:31] abraham begat isaac and isaac because
[56:34] begot jacob and jacob begat judas and
[56:36] his brethren
[56:37] verse three and judas begat faris
[56:40] and zara of tamar and faris begat esram
[56:44] sram begat iran iran begat
[56:48] amin adap aminada begat nassen nassim
[56:51] begat
[56:51] someone and someone begat both or boys
[56:55] of richard richard or is the same as
[56:58] rehab
[56:59] of jericho and boaz or both begat obed
[57:03] of ruth
[57:04] and albert begat jesse and jesse because
[57:07] david the king and david begat salomon
[57:10] of her that had been the wife of urias
[57:13] and on and on and on you can go through
[57:14] and trace
[57:15] how the lord jesus christ the sun the
[57:17] root and the offspring of david we may
[57:19] take our seat
[57:20] god bless you
[57:23] glory to god jesus christ was the root
[57:27] and the offspring of david amen
[57:36] praise be to god so jesus christ when he
[57:40] came through this earth
[57:42] he didn't come through the tribe of the
[57:44] pursuit
[57:45] we know the priesthood tribe that is the
[57:47] tribe of levy or levi
[57:50] moses came through that tribe
[57:53] then when jesus was coming he swept that
[57:55] tribe and came to the tribe of judah
[57:59] and we know jew that we can talk about
[58:00] one brokenness of judah
[58:02] judah was a man her daughter his
[58:05] daughter-in-law was
[58:06] sama and in the old testament when
[58:09] a son or a man maurice and doesn't give
[58:11] birth to children
[58:13] and the husband dies the brother of the
[58:15] person has to marry the woman
[58:17] and bring forth children to kind of keep
[58:20] the
[58:20] family line going however there wasn't
[58:24] any
[58:25] adult to give it to this uh tamar so
[58:28] there was a young man coming up so he
[58:29] was supposed to grow
[58:30] and get married to tamar however when he
[58:33] grew up they didn't give it to her
[58:34] but there's a lot of uh a lot of uh
[58:38] procreation the law of uh
[58:41] redemption or redemption the law of
[58:43] keeping the family line
[58:45] so there was something in tamar so he
[58:48] decided to
[58:48] do something and sometimes the things
[58:50] that are that seems
[58:52] way off the lord uses those things
[58:55] to bring his word to pass so tamar
[58:58] dressed up as a prostitute in a note
[59:00] on the olden days in the bible this
[59:02] holding bible days the addresses were
[59:03] different
[59:04] the women like the muslims they cover
[59:06] almost all their face
[59:08] they put on ropes they have the inner
[59:09] garment outer garment and so forth and
[59:11] so on
[59:12] so tamar was on this on on the road like
[59:16] a prostitute and judah went to
[59:18] take care of his ship coming with his
[59:19] staff and rod and so forth
[59:21] and he saw this prostitute in the old
[59:23] interest in the old testament
[59:24] they could have wives and have
[59:26] concubines that is the old testament but
[59:28] not a new testament
[59:30] so uh judah talked to this prostitute
[59:33] and he said
[59:34] what will you give me say well i don't
[59:35] have anything here but i can give you my
[59:36] stuff
[59:37] and my inside and son is like maybe
[59:39] wallet right so i'll give it to you and
[59:41] i'll send somebody to bring you sheep
[59:43] and goats and whatever so he did what he
[59:46] did
[59:47] and then he went his way it wasn't long
[59:50] they realized that hey
[59:51] they came to uh judah say hey your
[59:53] daughter-in-law is pregnant say really
[59:55] she's pregnant
[59:57] she got to be killed because she didn't
[59:59] wait for the for the young man now they
[1:00:00] put the blame on her
[1:00:01] all right and so they want to find out
[1:00:03] who got her pregnant
[1:00:05] well they don't know okay let's go find
[1:00:06] out so they went to find out hey
[1:00:08] who got you pregnant so well i don't
[1:00:10] know who got me pregnant but the man who
[1:00:11] got me pregnant
[1:00:12] pregnant gave me his staff and his
[1:00:15] wallet and his name
[1:00:16] id callum used it like an id card so
[1:00:18] this is the man's id card
[1:00:20] or social security number his name is
[1:00:22] this so they went back to jude i said
[1:00:24] judah
[1:00:25] she doesn't even know the man who got
[1:00:27] her pregnant but she has got some
[1:00:29] something instrument uh staff and id
[1:00:32] card
[1:00:32] right so this is the id card and the
[1:00:35] name of the id card was judas
[1:00:37] saying really so judas looked at and
[1:00:39] said look
[1:00:40] she's more righteous than i am
[1:00:43] she did this to preserve life
[1:00:46] amen she didn't do it for the doing sick
[1:00:49] but she did it to preserve life
[1:00:51] and so now through that tribe that is
[1:00:53] where the lord jesus christ came through
[1:00:55] therma as we read here
[1:00:57] we look at a woman called a rehab you're
[1:01:00] going to center mostly on rehab but
[1:01:02] ruth we know her life she came from a
[1:01:04] country of idol worshiping
[1:01:06] she wasn't part of the kingdom of heaven
[1:01:09] but before the foundation of the world
[1:01:11] her name was in the lamb's book of life
[1:01:13] so she has to come through the same
[1:01:15] lineage of jesus christ or jehovah in
[1:01:18] that time
[1:01:19] but hers was through marriage and we
[1:01:21] know the the story of ruth
[1:01:23] now on rehab she's the one we're going
[1:01:25] to center on
[1:01:26] she was a prostitute in jericho and uh
[1:01:30] this woman came through we want to
[1:01:32] there's so many uh so many things that
[1:01:34] we can look at the story of
[1:01:35] rehab five thousand or four thousand
[1:01:37] years ago and we see ourselves
[1:01:39] in rehab amen because rehab is our
[1:01:42] mother amen
[1:01:43] our gospel mother rehab was a prostitute
[1:01:45] but then she heard a story
[1:01:47] of men two spies who are spying
[1:01:51] the land and being a prostitute they
[1:01:53] went to a house
[1:01:54] to kind of keep those men you know if
[1:01:56] you want to find out about
[1:01:57] issues entire go to those prostitutes
[1:02:00] they know everything in town
[1:02:01] because they know all the men they know
[1:02:03] the politicians they are their customers
[1:02:06] they know that senators the governors
[1:02:08] the mayors
[1:02:10] and even the ministers and so on and so
[1:02:12] forth so if you want to find information
[1:02:14] about selling place
[1:02:15] go to the prostitute because they will
[1:02:17] tell you the people that come to them
[1:02:19] and the things that they talk they tell
[1:02:21] they tell them so they can give you all
[1:02:23] the info
[1:02:23] all the secrets that even their wives
[1:02:25] don't know this prostitute hold those
[1:02:27] information
[1:02:29] praise be to god so they went to the
[1:02:30] prostitute house to say hey
[1:02:32] you know we are here for a business but
[1:02:34] you know if you want to keep our
[1:02:35] business sacred
[1:02:36] uh uh secret we will take care of you we
[1:02:39] will keep you alive
[1:02:41] so they realize that these men are not
[1:02:43] just ordinary man they are not just
[1:02:44] coming for business
[1:02:45] her business but they want to find out
[1:02:47] things about the town
[1:02:49] because the almighty has sent them to
[1:02:50] take over the town amen
[1:02:52] and this morning we are not talking
[1:02:53] about towns like taking over boca raton
[1:02:56] or taking over miami or taking over uh
[1:02:59] west palm beach but we've got an earth a
[1:03:02] town a city
[1:03:04] people human beings insisting element
[1:03:07] your loved ones and my loved ones
[1:03:09] sons and daughters of god that we need
[1:03:11] to go back and take it from the king of
[1:03:13] jericho
[1:03:14] amen those are the towns and cities we
[1:03:16] are talking about
[1:03:17] so for in four thousand years ago five
[1:03:19] thousand years ago
[1:03:20] it was a typica uh physical town
[1:03:23] physical city
[1:03:24] but now that is a type the city is human
[1:03:27] beings
[1:03:27] amen so rehab
[1:03:30] kept their business uh secret they got
[1:03:32] all the information that they they
[1:03:34] wanted
[1:03:34] and the bible said that the people of
[1:03:36] jericho
[1:03:38] feared one translation said their
[1:03:39] hardware melting for the fear of the
[1:03:41] people
[1:03:42] because they could see that it's not
[1:03:44] human beings it is
[1:03:46] jehovah himself in human flesh working
[1:03:48] upon the land of jericho
[1:03:50] he's coming to take back his inheritance
[1:03:52] amen
[1:03:53] as a brother jack preached was it last
[1:03:55] week the more you know
[1:03:56] the less you fear the more you know that
[1:03:59] this is for you
[1:04:00] you go with boldness and claim it for
[1:04:02] yourself because
[1:04:03] this is your inheritance it's your
[1:04:05] position and you've got
[1:04:07] that celestial dimensions behind you all
[1:04:10] heaven is behind you to claim your
[1:04:11] inheritance
[1:04:12] so you go with boldness and ask him hey
[1:04:15] this is my pen give it to me brother
[1:04:16] joseph i'm just kidding
[1:04:17] it's not my thing so if something is for
[1:04:20] you that's how you go with you just
[1:04:22] claim it
[1:04:23] you don't go trembling you go with what
[1:04:25] with strength
[1:04:26] with courage and claim it you don't go
[1:04:28] begging for it
[1:04:29] but you go receiving it claim it from
[1:04:32] from the thief
[1:04:33] amen so whatever the enemy has stolen
[1:04:35] from you
[1:04:36] whatever the devil conditions of life
[1:04:38] has stolen from you jesus christ is here
[1:04:39] to restore to you
[1:04:40] amen blessed be the name of the lord
[1:04:44] so
[1:04:48] rehab let's read joshua
[1:04:52] to to to give some background
[1:04:56] joshua
[1:05:02] chapter one the verse
[1:05:12] joshua chapter one
[1:05:21] rather chapter two joshua chapter two
[1:05:26] let's read from one going and joshua the
[1:05:29] son of nan sent out
[1:05:31] sent out to him two men to spy
[1:05:33] secretly
[1:05:34] saying go view the land even jericho and
[1:05:37] they went
[1:05:37] and came into an hallowed house named
[1:05:40] rahab
[1:05:41] and lodged there and it was told the
[1:05:43] king of jericho saying behold
[1:05:45] there came man in heather tonight of the
[1:05:47] children of israel to search out the
[1:05:49] land
[1:05:50] and the king of jericho sent out rehab
[1:05:52] saying
[1:05:53] bring them bring forth the men that are
[1:05:55] come to thee which are entered into that
[1:05:57] house
[1:05:58] for they be come to search out our
[1:06:00] country
[1:06:01] and the woman took the two men and hid
[1:06:03] them and said
[1:06:04] there came men unto me but i was not
[1:06:07] once they were
[1:06:08] and it came to pass about the time of
[1:06:10] shouting of the gates
[1:06:11] let me skip two verse verse 10
[1:06:14] for we have heard verse 10 says for
[1:06:18] we have heard how the lord dried up the
[1:06:21] waters the water of the red sea for you
[1:06:24] when you came out to egypt and when you
[1:06:26] did
[1:06:27] unto the king of kings of amorites
[1:06:30] that way on the other side of jordan
[1:06:32] sinha and og
[1:06:33] whom he utterly destroyed as soon as we
[1:06:36] heard of these things
[1:06:38] our hearts did melt neither did there
[1:06:41] remain any more courage in any man
[1:06:43] because of you for the lord your god
[1:06:45] he is god of heaven above and in earth
[1:06:48] below
[1:06:49] amen if you have this god what do you
[1:06:51] have to fear
[1:06:55] tell me if you have this person in your
[1:06:58] life
[1:06:59] what do you have to fear what do you
[1:07:02] have to worry about
[1:07:03] what do you have to dread because the
[1:07:06] lord fights your battle for you
[1:07:08] amen is just using your
[1:07:10] instrumentalities
[1:07:11] it's using your your your body to
[1:07:14] surrender your body or spread your soul
[1:07:16] to him
[1:07:16] so that he can take care of things you
[1:07:18] need to take care of amen
[1:07:20] so now jericho was the name
[1:07:24] rehab we have a little background of her
[1:07:26] that she was a woman of jericho
[1:07:28] and she was a prostitute her life was
[1:07:30] full of brokenness there was nothing
[1:07:31] good to write home about
[1:07:33] but there was a seed of presentation in
[1:07:36] rehab amen and the lord looked at the
[1:07:39] seed in a person
[1:07:40] the lord doesn't look at your physical
[1:07:43] body how beautiful or how
[1:07:45] ugly you are that is not what the lord
[1:07:47] is looking up to
[1:07:48] he's looking out to your heart amen that
[1:07:50] you have a little bit of love for him
[1:07:53] regardless of your brokenness do you
[1:07:55] love him
[1:07:56] do you want to connect to him do you
[1:07:58] want to surrender your life to him
[1:07:59] that is what the lord is looking up to
[1:08:01] amen when a man is going to marry a
[1:08:03] woman
[1:08:04] the man is looking at number one love
[1:08:06] amen
[1:08:07] the man is not if he's a true man who
[1:08:09] wants a true wife he's not looking up to
[1:08:11] beauty first if you look up to beauty
[1:08:13] without love it's gonna be a failure
[1:08:16] amen
[1:08:17] however if you look up to love first
[1:08:19] that you know that this woman for sure
[1:08:20] loves you and you love her
[1:08:22] then it's going to be a good marriage so
[1:08:25] the lord is a type the natural type of
[1:08:27] spiritual when the lord is
[1:08:28] proposing to you he's looking after you
[1:08:30] do you love him
[1:08:32] not how broken you are not how rich you
[1:08:34] are
[1:08:35] but do you love him will you surrender
[1:08:37] your life to him
[1:08:38] that the lord jesus christ will be your
[1:08:40] husband to come and live in you
[1:08:42] to rule you to order your footsteps or
[1:08:45] you want to
[1:08:45] live your own life you want to be a
[1:08:47] isaiah 4 verse 4.
[1:08:49] isaiah 4 4 said there were seven women
[1:08:52] who wanted a man
[1:08:53] but they wanted to have their own name
[1:08:55] and wear their own apparel
[1:08:57] they don't want to be called this is
[1:08:58] jesus christ they just want to be a
[1:09:00] church member
[1:09:01] they want to belong to a society they
[1:09:03] want to belong to a group
[1:09:05] but they don't want the lord to be their
[1:09:07] husband they just want to have a name to
[1:09:09] be just we call a christian
[1:09:11] but the life the nature the deity of
[1:09:14] jesus christ
[1:09:15] the abort and dislike in their lives
[1:09:18] i don't i don't i don't think we want to
[1:09:20] be that kind of church
[1:09:22] but we want a church we want to be the
[1:09:23] call that one
[1:09:25] uh revelation 18 4 if i'm right
[1:09:28] that kami among them from among them my
[1:09:30] people and be not be the participants of
[1:09:32] jericho
[1:09:34] for their sins of what mounted high and
[1:09:36] i the lord
[1:09:38] has come down with a consuming fire to
[1:09:40] consume them amen
[1:09:42] if you think the world is so glorious
[1:09:44] and you're gonna
[1:09:45] enjoy this for thousands of years in the
[1:09:47] cosmos form
[1:09:49] look at coronavirus does it say that if
[1:09:52] you don't know death go to the cemetery
[1:09:54] look at the grave
[1:09:55] but if you think this word is so
[1:09:56] glorious in itself in a cosmos form
[1:10:00] then look at coronavirus shot countries
[1:10:04] big people with big name putin trump
[1:10:06] trump
[1:10:07] whoever queen of england everybody's
[1:10:10] hiding out
[1:10:12] all the kings and the queens and all the
[1:10:14] big people
[1:10:15] all the big names billionaires and
[1:10:18] puppets
[1:10:18] are like poor and they're rich everyone
[1:10:22] is running for their life
[1:10:24] because there's a spirit of death on the
[1:10:25] land on earth
[1:10:28] so where is the place of refuge there's
[1:10:31] only one place of refuge
[1:10:32] that is in jesus christ amen so he said
[1:10:35] come out from among them
[1:10:37] and be not be partakers of the cosmos
[1:10:39] evil but rather come to the uh to the
[1:10:41] lugas
[1:10:42] come to the word life come to eternity
[1:10:45] come and be identify yourself who you
[1:10:47] you were before the foundation of the
[1:10:49] world
[1:10:49] and that is what rehab did rehab put her
[1:10:52] faith into action
[1:10:53] the name the meaning of rehab means
[1:10:55] white and broad a land
[1:10:57] wide land and broadland now rehab didn't
[1:11:00] have
[1:11:01] any good implanted on the land
[1:11:04] she planted prostitution and adultery
[1:11:08] and spread that is not of the lord but
[1:11:10] one day she received
[1:11:12] visitors she received the lord himself
[1:11:14] in the form of the two spies
[1:11:17] and she had a choice to make to stay in
[1:11:19] the old church
[1:11:21] to be a part of the king of er what's
[1:11:24] the name
[1:11:24] the kingdom of king of jericho that
[1:11:26] kingdom doesn't hold water
[1:11:29] that kingdom was about to break down
[1:11:31] that kingdom has been melted
[1:11:33] when chronovirus came their sister gave
[1:11:34] her testimony she belonged to a church
[1:11:37] and she was expecting things to happen
[1:11:39] in the church this is a time that church
[1:11:40] has to put their faith in action but
[1:11:42] everybody is running away
[1:11:44] and he said where's the faith i thought
[1:11:45] this church is going to do something
[1:11:48] the church everybody's ever the pastor
[1:11:50] they don't find him
[1:11:52] because he's running for his life he
[1:11:54] doesn't want to show up
[1:11:55] he cares for his life he doesn't want to
[1:11:58] die
[1:11:59] and the sister was disappointed he said
[1:12:01] i thought it's a church where it is a
[1:12:03] time that we have to
[1:12:04] rise up and pray and you know the lord
[1:12:06] coming down no they had
[1:12:08] a name but they didn't have the word the
[1:12:10] life amen
[1:12:12] you may have a name christian you may
[1:12:14] have a name tabernacle
[1:12:15] but if the life of christ is not in you
[1:12:17] it's just a name
[1:12:18] amen blessed be the name of the lord
[1:12:21] jesus christ
[1:12:23] so rahab had to make a decision that her
[1:12:25] earth that is her body
[1:12:27] has to be redirected to a new man
[1:12:30] jehovah
[1:12:31] they have to be a new crop being planted
[1:12:33] on that land
[1:12:34] and the lord was so messy for if you
[1:12:36] want to read uh we don't have the time
[1:12:38] but you can read
[1:12:39] uh joshua chapter two he's going to tell
[1:12:42] you about
[1:12:42] his her story how she was rescued but i
[1:12:44] want to take some few highlights
[1:12:46] you want to take james chapter 2 verse
[1:12:49] 25
[1:12:51] james 2 25
[1:12:54] about this woman that was a prostitute
[1:12:56] and how the lord liberated her
[1:12:58] and put her in the family of christ
[1:13:03] james 225 likewise also
[1:13:06] was not rehabbed the harlot justified by
[1:13:08] wax
[1:13:09] when she had received the messengers and
[1:13:12] had sent them
[1:13:12] out another way so her works
[1:13:16] that is when he put her faith into
[1:13:17] action her works her feet produce
[1:13:21] uh rewards it produced an action
[1:13:24] which brought rewards onto her that is
[1:13:26] redemption of her and a household
[1:13:29] the same thing the greater faith is in
[1:13:30] you amen if your faith could redeem it
[1:13:33] from
[1:13:33] being consumed by the destruction of
[1:13:35] jericho then your faith in jesus christ
[1:13:37] can redeem you and your loved one from
[1:13:39] all the cases of the world
[1:13:41] amen you want to read
[1:13:44] hebrews chapter 11 30 and 31
[1:13:48] hebrews chapter 11 verse 3 30 and 31
[1:13:51] he said by faith the walls of jericho
[1:13:53] fell down
[1:13:54] after they were compass about seven days
[1:14:01] right 31 by faith the harlot rehab
[1:14:04] perished not with them that believe not
[1:14:06] when she had received their spies with
[1:14:08] peace amen
[1:14:09] when she received them with peace now
[1:14:11] rahab went after she was redeemed
[1:14:13] she was adopted into the family of
[1:14:17] jehovah into the tribe of israel
[1:14:20] she became part of gas economy now she
[1:14:23] married to
[1:14:24] a man called salmon and someone
[1:14:28] the name remember the name the meaning
[1:14:29] of rehab means el vas land
[1:14:32] an empty land that nothing had been
[1:14:34] planted on
[1:14:35] now salomon means peaceable perfection
[1:14:39] and he that rewards amen
[1:14:42] peaceable perfection and he that rewards
[1:14:45] amen now rehab didn't have peace to
[1:14:48] begin with
[1:14:49] that wasn't the life of peace men coming
[1:14:52] after the other
[1:14:53] there was noop it doesn't matter how
[1:14:54] much you get it was a lot of life of
[1:14:56] destruction and brokenness
[1:14:58] but then when she received the word from
[1:15:01] the from the
[1:15:01] spice of uh spice of joshua
[1:15:05] now she had what she had peace
[1:15:08] and when she had peace she became
[1:15:10] perfect
[1:15:11] and through that perfection she received
[1:15:13] rewards
[1:15:15] of being redeemed and her loved ones
[1:15:17] being redeemed
[1:15:18] not only redemption but the lord gave a
[1:15:21] husband
[1:15:22] called salmon salmon is a type of christ
[1:15:25] a man and when she married to someone
[1:15:28] she brought about a son
[1:15:30] uh i think that was a boss now boaz
[1:15:33] means the lord of the harvest
[1:15:35] amen who is also a type of christ and
[1:15:38] was married to another broken woman
[1:15:40] rehab by redemption the whole life is
[1:15:43] about redemption
[1:15:44] and she redeemed ruth into the family of
[1:15:46] christ and out of ruth came forth who
[1:15:50] jesse obered first right obed then from
[1:15:53] obed
[1:15:53] jesse from jesse david from david
[1:15:57] jesus christ amen so regardless of how
[1:16:00] broken you are
[1:16:01] jesus christ can come through your
[1:16:03] bowels
[1:16:05] amen regardless of how unworthy you are
[1:16:08] jesus christ if you surrender your life
[1:16:09] to jesus christ you can take your
[1:16:11] brokenness
[1:16:12] and bring masterpieces out of your life
[1:16:15] amen
[1:16:16] because he's looking at the seed he
[1:16:17] planted in you when you plant a
[1:16:20] crop the crops sometimes will rot fast
[1:16:22] certain crops
[1:16:23] it has to die it has to rot
[1:16:26] and then the life in it everything
[1:16:28] everything has to roll the seed
[1:16:30] completely then there's a life the life
[1:16:32] is a six-dimensional life
[1:16:34] and it's the spoken word of god when the
[1:16:36] lord created the earth he spoke
[1:16:38] let the earth bring forth what fruits
[1:16:40] trees
[1:16:41] yielding fruits flowers and so forth not
[1:16:44] only the physical
[1:16:45] earth but you are fruit of the earth
[1:16:48] if you read some uh one he said blessed
[1:16:51] is the man
[1:16:52] uh who put not the trust in in
[1:16:54] wickedness and do wickedness
[1:16:56] but a man who what who put his trust in
[1:16:58] the lord he shall be like a tree
[1:17:00] planted by the waters of rivers of water
[1:17:03] he will yield
[1:17:03] his fruits in its season so when you
[1:17:07] give your life to christ
[1:17:08] regardless of what you go through yes
[1:17:09] you have to go through rottiness and
[1:17:11] being dead
[1:17:12] and then by the way that's a seed the
[1:17:14] life the six dimensional life
[1:17:16] the mind of christ will come out of you
[1:17:18] by the holy ghost baptism
[1:17:20] amen two weeks ago i think not this
[1:17:23] last saturday but previous saturday i
[1:17:25] was invited to speak to
[1:17:26] the youth in mexico and some part of
[1:17:29] south america
[1:17:30] in a virtual preaching so we did it by
[1:17:32] brother josue's house
[1:17:33] and the lord laid on my heart finding
[1:17:36] your purpose
[1:17:37] in earth not your purpose on earth we
[1:17:40] have so many purposes on earth
[1:17:42] on earth your job yes whatever you do
[1:17:45] school raising children family
[1:17:46] but you've got one purpose in earth
[1:17:50] in your earth in your sistine element
[1:17:52] and that purpose is what
[1:17:54] the mind of jesus christ for you and
[1:17:56] what is the man of jesus christ
[1:17:58] the holy ghost baptism the new breath
[1:18:02] the being born again being receiving
[1:18:04] christ into your heart
[1:18:06] so that christ will restore the garden
[1:18:08] of eden in your life
[1:18:10] not some kind of eating in in egypt or
[1:18:13] in uh
[1:18:14] somewhere in israel by the garden of
[1:18:16] eden in your earth
[1:18:18] because your body is 16 element the the
[1:18:21] lord
[1:18:21] one person is more valuable than all the
[1:18:23] earth or the planet
[1:18:25] because this is an earth that can move
[1:18:27] that can talk
[1:18:28] that has got a soul the natural earth
[1:18:31] yes the lord rules over the natural
[1:18:33] earth
[1:18:34] but it's not as important to the lord as
[1:18:36] your earth
[1:18:37] amen because in your earth he can
[1:18:40] establish his kingdom on it
[1:18:42] the natural earth is doing what he's
[1:18:43] supposed to do he's bringing forth fruit
[1:18:46] rivers and what a view but are you
[1:18:49] and me are we bringing forth the fruits
[1:18:51] are we bringing
[1:18:52] manifesting the purpose of god or not on
[1:18:54] in earth
[1:18:55] so the lord has a purpose for you in
[1:18:57] your earth
[1:18:59] and when you receive just like rahab
[1:19:01] when you receive the word
[1:19:02] christ into your earth then you can
[1:19:04] bring forth peace
[1:19:06] perfection and all the rewards in christ
[1:19:09] amen jesus told his disciples seek he
[1:19:11] first the kingdom of god
[1:19:13] and his righteousness the kingdom of god
[1:19:16] is a person
[1:19:17] that's what i said his righteousness so
[1:19:20] seek he the person of jesus christ
[1:19:22] into your heart and the holiness that
[1:19:24] goes with it
[1:19:25] everything else will be added on to you
[1:19:27] amen
[1:19:28] prosperity whatever job business
[1:19:31] marriage
[1:19:32] children grandchildren whatever you
[1:19:34] desire
[1:19:35] as long as you have a desire the lord
[1:19:37] has already given it to you
[1:19:38] glory be to the lord amen so whatever
[1:19:41] you desire in christ
[1:19:43] is there for you so you have to allow
[1:19:45] the lord to plant
[1:19:47] his seed upon your earth many probably
[1:19:50] haven't allowed the lord to plant
[1:19:52] the the seed of the of the word of god
[1:19:54] upon their earth
[1:19:55] and the lord has got opportunity for you
[1:19:56] today because today
[1:19:58] when you hear the word don't reject the
[1:20:00] word of god let the word
[1:20:02] be conceived like mary in your heart to
[1:20:05] bring for the lord jesus christ
[1:20:07] because today might be your last day
[1:20:09] amen
[1:20:10] why do you want to go back to where the
[1:20:12] lord redeem you from
[1:20:14] when the lord has spent economy look at
[1:20:16] let me look at it in a business form

[1:20:20] they expect they expect money and profit
[1:20:22] back

[1:20:32] business
[1:20:33] uh transportation business they expect
[1:20:35] they already put down certain things
[1:20:36] they just don't throw their money one
[1:20:37] billion

[1:20:57] and after maybe 10 years
[1:20:58] or five years maybe they have a short
[1:21:00] term and a long time in a year or two
[1:21:03] i have to break even in other words i'm
[1:21:05] not making profit but i'm not losing
[1:21:06] but in the third year i need to begin to
[1:21:09] retrieve my money back
[1:21:10] we're going to get more money get more
[1:21:12] profit and reinvest
[1:21:13] now the lord invests in us amen the lord
[1:21:16] is the greatest
[1:21:17] businessman more than other businessman
[1:21:19] more than the guilt and trump and so

[1:22:30] planted you in a church
[1:22:32] in the house of the lord as a
[1:22:34] businessman to bring forth fruits
[1:22:36] so that a certain age you are in an age
[1:22:38] of that you don't know
[1:22:39] good and bad so we call it the age of
[1:22:42] you are not giving a
[1:22:43] you are not accountable for whatever
[1:22:44] happened to you when you are maybe three
[1:22:46] years
[1:22:47] god doesn't hold you for any sin because
[1:22:49] two-year-old
[1:22:50] when you you're maybe three years four
[1:22:52] years some people get to age of
[1:22:54] accountability but based on
[1:22:55] individual some could be seven eight
[1:22:59] ten some probably excuse me to say maybe
[1:23:01] some children might be
[1:23:03] and they have to grow a little longer to
[1:23:05] be accountable yeah
[1:23:06] because of maybe sickness so it's
[1:23:08] different for each and every one now
[1:23:09] when you get to age of accountability
[1:23:11] maybe 12
[1:23:12] teenager let's say 15. now god can put
[1:23:14] you to work
[1:23:16] you can take the excuse me let me use
[1:23:18] this time marine for example
[1:23:20] you can use the tambourine glorify the
[1:23:23] name of the lord amen you can sweep the
[1:23:25] house of the lord
[1:23:26] you can pray your prayers have taught
[1:23:27] you how to pray now that's what the lord
[1:23:29] is yielding his investment is breakeven
[1:23:32] the day he gives you the uh you get to
[1:23:34] age of accountability
[1:23:35] there's a break even time so now god is
[1:23:37] going to swap you to the other side
[1:23:39] where you'll be accountable maybe from
[1:23:41] the age of like i'm just making an
[1:23:43] assumption let's say from the age of
[1:23:44] zero
[1:23:45] up to 15 you are not accountable i'm
[1:23:47] just making an assumption but now 15
[1:23:49] you are fully accountable or even 12.
[1:23:51] you are accountable
[1:23:52] you know what is good and bad you know
[1:23:55] it's good for you to save the lord
[1:23:57] you know it's good for you not to smoke
[1:23:58] you know it's wrong for you to go after
[1:24:00] men and women who are not your husbands
[1:24:01] and your wives
[1:24:02] you know it's not good for you to have
[1:24:04] to go and form a gang
[1:24:06] and wrap people and shoot people in
[1:24:08] their homes you know it's not good for
[1:24:10] you to gossip
[1:24:11] to smoke to drink to go to parties
[1:24:14] there's a lot in you
[1:24:15] on your conscience that tells you but
[1:24:17] when you get to that break-even age
[1:24:19] that's when there's something on the
[1:24:20] other side telling you don't you see you
[1:24:22] i mean
[1:24:24] you're kind of old-fashioned why do you
[1:24:27] follow your parents to church

[1:24:58] listen to brad troy i mean i don't have

[1:25:09] have a boyfriend who picked me up
[1:25:11] and then take me to the restaurant that

[1:25:30] can't even get my own job you know
[1:25:32] i'm moving out with my boyfriend and
[1:25:34] then you begin to take that decision now
[1:25:36] the kingdom of god
[1:25:37] is in deficit
[1:25:39] [Applause]
[1:25:41] the lord is losing money he's losing
[1:25:44] anointing
[1:25:45] the anointing that he put on you now you
[1:25:48] are licking it to the world
[1:25:50] [Music]
[1:25:52] amen
[1:25:54] [Applause]
[1:25:58] the lord is losing there's nobody to
[1:26:00] play the tambourine
[1:26:02] what god has put in you to do yes maybe
[1:26:05] this brother can play the tambourine
[1:26:06] but not like the way you do it
[1:26:10] this person can sing but not the way you
[1:26:12] do it
[1:26:14] this person can work on the i.t but not
[1:26:17] the way you do it
[1:26:19] this person can testify to people but
[1:26:21] not the way you do it
[1:26:23] this sister can live their life but not
[1:26:25] the way you do it
[1:26:26] so god does make you so uniquely unique
[1:26:29] that what you do the next sister the
[1:26:31] next brother
[1:26:32] cannot do the same amen so when does
[1:26:35] somebody leave they need an i.t
[1:26:37] i know brad jack has it and you go and
[1:26:39] tell kwaku
[1:26:41] cannot do the i.t brad jack has to be
[1:26:44] there to do the iit work
[1:26:46] i can use the instrument but i don't
[1:26:47] know how to do it
[1:26:50] if there's somebody to fix their face
[1:26:52] their itis at their back their sisters
[1:26:54] can do it maybe
[1:26:55] brother brother steven cannot do it yeah
[1:26:57] he's not an i.t he's just like me
[1:26:59] right so the lord has put something in
[1:27:02] you but
[1:27:03] uh starting for you to do something that

[1:28:14] and go to the other side you receive
[1:28:16] cases
[1:28:17] and i'll tell you a story of a man
[1:28:20] this young man was a christian from the
[1:28:22] pentecostal background
[1:28:23] and he had about the message this is in
[1:28:25] ghana and he moved to the message and i
[1:28:28] knew he was not somebody who was trained
[1:28:29] to me we prayed together he
[1:28:31] brought his family when i started the
[1:28:32] church into the church
[1:28:34] he loved the message with his wife i
[1:28:36] don't know something that voice began to
[1:28:37] speak to him
[1:28:38] he didn't like the message no more okay
[1:28:40] he went back to the old church
[1:28:42] which was good and his wife was still
[1:28:44] there he stopped his wife from coming to
[1:28:46] the church
[1:28:47] and he even stopped his wife from going
[1:28:48] to pentecost church it wasn't too long
[1:28:50] he left the peninsula church
[1:28:52] he started selling alcohol a christian
[1:28:55] selling alcohol
[1:28:57] making money he didn't need that money
[1:28:59] but he just whatever happened to him
[1:29:01] that he didn't end up there he wanted
[1:29:03] power
[1:29:04] so begin to look for idols went to togo
[1:29:08] where they could get idols they can give
[1:29:09] you idol for whatever
[1:29:11] i do for money i don't for like i know
[1:29:14] haitians i've got a voodoo
[1:29:16] when you go to certain places they have
[1:29:18] idols you can buy an idol if you want a
[1:29:20] woman
[1:29:20] you can have an idol that will give you
[1:29:22] for girls if you want a certain girl or
[1:29:24] a man
[1:29:24] what do you call it a uh i forgotten
[1:29:27] that's a term for it somebody who has
[1:29:29] got money that's a term i don't remember
[1:29:31] but if you want somebody a rich person
[1:29:33] uh

[1:29:42] of bring wash him so that he can give
[1:29:44] you

[1:30:06] telling this brother to advise his
[1:30:08] the husband but shouldn't pay heed after

[1:32:36] so the house is here and part of them is
[1:32:38] kind of you know transforming to a
[1:32:39] church
[1:32:40] and this poor old man is very godly man
[1:32:43] but her granddaughter will not
[1:32:44] step foot in the church sunday she will
[1:32:47] run around with men

[1:33:19] of maybe hypertension diabetes
[1:33:22] no she wasn't sick of blood that kind of
[1:33:25] sickness
[1:33:26] but demons demon of death tormenting
[1:33:29] demons
[1:33:30] were taking her life sapping the life
[1:33:31] out of her fear
[1:33:34] and you could see spirit of death
[1:33:35] written in her face
[1:33:38] she couldn't talk or where are the boys
[1:33:41] they were not they were not there to be
[1:33:43] found

[1:33:54] grandparents
[1:33:56] they are standing the god for you and

[1:34:02] there could be a barrier when you cross
[1:34:03] it might be the last time
[1:34:05] that you hear this good news like the
[1:34:08] young man
[1:34:09] he had the pentecostal church he had a
[1:34:11] message church but he went for idols
[1:34:13] and he died screaming policemen were
[1:34:15] chasing him he left his wife and his
[1:34:18] children behind
[1:34:19] if you don't serve the lord you won't do
[1:34:20] god's purpose god will take you from the
[1:34:22] earth
[1:34:24] he hosts your life and my life amen
[1:34:27] never say that my life it's me i can do
[1:34:30] what i want you gonna find out
[1:34:32] if you created yourself if you give
[1:34:34] birth to yourself you will find out
[1:34:36] pretty soon in the right time
[1:34:38] and if the lord has blessed you with
[1:34:40] where you hear the gospel
[1:34:41] coming for the intruder in life what
[1:34:44] does you want
[1:34:45] why do you want to separate yourself
[1:34:46] from jesus christ why don't you
[1:34:48] why do you want tormenting demons they
[1:34:51] torment people people cannot sleep
[1:34:54] demons every person that you sleep with
[1:34:56] who is not your husband or your wife
[1:34:58] you plant a spirit in you you plant a
[1:35:01] demon in you
[1:35:03] because human beings have got spirits
[1:35:05] spirits don't live in a walls no
[1:35:07] you don't see if they're spreading this
[1:35:09] water that's not going to have an action
[1:35:12] jesus christ was not living in trees no
[1:35:15] satan doesn't live in trees if you live
[1:35:17] in tree he cannot function
[1:35:19] his stagger is not a tree he's tagged
[1:35:21] his own human being
[1:35:23] working on earth remember what's the
[1:35:26] name
[1:35:26] um the man that got mad into the
[1:35:29] cemetery
[1:35:30] she was cut himself with stone legion
[1:35:33] yeah
[1:35:34] legion had maybe he was in church but
[1:35:36] legion began to do otherwise
[1:35:38] left his wife and children maybe money
[1:35:41] maybe
[1:35:42] something and he became a prodigal son
[1:35:44] and legion was now living in the
[1:35:46] cemetery
[1:35:46] and demons in him who in his normal
[1:35:48] sense would take a stone
[1:35:50] and cut himself he's tormenting demons
[1:35:52] but he was lucky jesus christ remembered
[1:35:54] him
[1:35:55] and he went there to save his life and
[1:35:57] brought legion from his condition
[1:35:59] if we're living in a legion condition
[1:36:02] remember the prodigal son
[1:36:03] progress and go to certain age when he
[1:36:05] has to be profitable to the kingdom
[1:36:07] he said no i've worked in this kind of
[1:36:09] my dad you're rich i need to i need to
[1:36:10] get my portion

[1:36:18] when you have money you can get million
[1:36:20] girls to follow you
[1:36:21] when you think you are pretty you can
[1:36:23] get million men to follow you
[1:36:25] but there's a time will come that when
[1:36:27] you are in trouble
[1:36:28] you look around nobody will be found
[1:36:31] maybe you can cover the jack
[1:36:33] he's the one who come and pray for you
[1:36:35] you can cover the solomon
[1:36:37] you can call your parents you can call
[1:36:39] some brother
[1:36:40] some sister and they'll be there for you
[1:36:42] because why
[1:36:43] christ is in them is jesus christ on
[1:36:46] earth
[1:36:47] in the same ministry amen
[1:36:50] why do you want to separate yourself
[1:36:51] from people that will be a blessing to
[1:36:52] you
[1:36:53] so this young man took his money went to
[1:36:56] the cities

[1:37:04] nowhere to be found
[1:37:06] all their friends were nowhere to be
[1:37:07] found and he was eating with pigs

[1:37:16] they are the worst you can talk about
[1:37:18] you know pig you know
[1:37:19] photius so he was living in filthiness
[1:37:22] demons he found himself this is not

[1:37:29] me they don't even recognize me as a
[1:37:30] human being
[1:37:32] i'm sleeping with pigs why where did i
[1:37:35] get to the
[1:37:35] how and there's something in him a seed
[1:37:39] a voice of the father calling out to him
[1:37:41] son where are thou
[1:37:43] daughter where are thou and she came he
[1:37:46] came to himself
[1:37:47] he said you know what i've messed up but
[1:37:49] i'll go to my father
[1:37:51] for adventure he'll forgive me and i can
[1:37:53] be one of his libraries
[1:37:54] and he went but the father is full of

[1:38:01] love
[1:38:06] who take your broken your broken pieces
[1:38:09] and create brand new things out of it
[1:38:11] so the father received him with love he
[1:38:13] didn't make him a libra

[1:38:17] out forever his son
[1:38:18] and the father brought him back home put
[1:38:20] jewels on his neck killed
[1:38:22] fat cows for him and they had a party
[1:38:24] bring him back home
[1:38:25] because his son has now learned his
[1:38:27] experience so he's come back home
[1:38:29] now he's not going to go back to the
[1:38:30] world anymore amen if the lord jesus
[1:38:33] christ has privileged you
[1:38:34] to be born in a family where they read

[1:40:59] because why christ is in him
[1:41:01] crisis in him crisis in you crisis
[1:41:03] that's connecting together

[1:41:31] somewhere and he said
[1:41:32] when he was going with his father he
[1:41:35] didn't have an experience
[1:41:36] he was a young boy his mother died when
[1:41:38] he was young and his father was his
[1:41:40] father and his mother but abraham took
[1:41:42] him
[1:41:42] travel all over the world to preach and
[1:41:44] the lord called him
[1:41:46] to be part of his father's ministry
[1:41:48] there was a time that the angel of the
[1:41:49] lord came to visit
[1:41:51] his father to give him a message and
[1:41:54] after the angel speaking to about
[1:41:56] abraham they were bram was a
[1:41:57] he chose that life for his ministry he
[1:42:00] chose to be a poor man
[1:42:01] the lord blessed him later with with
[1:42:03] money he wasn't pro-begging for bread
[1:42:05] but he chose to be the way he was for
[1:42:08] the ministry the lord gave it to him
[1:42:09] somebody gave him a gift of a thousand
[1:42:11] dollars sorry one million dollars
[1:42:14] he said that one five he said this will
[1:42:15] kill me i can't take it i'm not like the
[1:42:18] lord has blessed but i believe
[1:42:19] uh billy graham and ura robert they have
[1:42:21] university
[1:42:22] the employee people that they have to
[1:42:24] pay for me 300
[1:42:25] is not for me i ran my little office
[1:42:28] mind the people that i deal with is
[1:42:29] people with cancer
[1:42:31] with tumors so if you buy me a private
[1:42:33] jet
[1:42:34] and i'm way up here when i come here i
[1:42:37] cannot connect to the people
[1:42:39] so for me the lord has chosen me to be
[1:42:40] who i am
[1:42:42] so that i can reach people with cancer
[1:42:44] women who have got breast cancer
[1:42:45] they are the one i have to connect with
[1:42:47] so i have to be like them
[1:42:49] and he said if i have my own ways that i
[1:42:50] don't see this to be humble i would
[1:42:51] rather prefer to walk
[1:42:53] on my feet but of course i can't walk
[1:42:55] from uh in indiana to arizona
[1:42:58] he can't walk from america to south
[1:42:59] africa to preach he has to go on jet
[1:43:01] flight
[1:43:02] so he chose that life so one day the
[1:43:03] angel of the lord came to visit him and
[1:43:05] said
[1:43:05] he asked the angel can my son he was
[1:43:08] with his brother they were in the same
[1:43:09] line of the same bed
[1:43:10] one bed they didn't have the fanciful
[1:43:13] bathroom they had the bathroom where you
[1:43:14] have to go
[1:43:15] and take shower i think he said what do
[1:43:17] you call it
[1:43:19] come help me i can't hear
[1:43:23] yes just like separate old-fashioned
[1:43:25] bathroom where they have a shower go and
[1:43:27] shower
[1:43:28] so braham said that can i can my son and
[1:43:30] my brother see you said
[1:43:31] no your your brother cannot see but your
[1:43:33] son can see me because he was i
[1:43:35] called him to work with you so he put a
[1:43:37] pillow on by the billipe's face
[1:43:39] and said billy you remember the angel of
[1:43:41] the lord that i talked to you about say
[1:43:42] yes
[1:43:43] he said would you like to see him say
[1:43:45] yes he said it's not going to harm you
[1:43:47] don't be afraid
[1:43:49] i'm going to i'm going to take the
[1:43:50] pillar off and inside the corner
[1:43:52] you see him the engine stand at the
[1:43:54] corner and then the angel was standing
[1:43:56] at the corner
[1:43:58] somewhere like this and billy paul
[1:43:59] looked at him and you could see the
[1:44:01] glory
[1:44:03] he was a person he was a human being
[1:44:05] right with her
[1:44:06] he was about 250 pounds or somewhere and
[1:44:09] he was
[1:44:10] barefooted wear a white garment and he
[1:44:12] was watching him and you could see the
[1:44:14] glory of the lord
[1:44:15] watching you could see the dimension the
[1:44:17] celestial dimension
[1:44:19] watching him and the kindness he said he
[1:44:21] could speak
[1:44:22] and the whole earth could even evacuate
[1:44:24] it could be scooped
[1:44:26] but the love of christ was in this angel
[1:44:29] watching
[1:44:29] billy paul and he said you could see
[1:44:32] that music after he left he went into
[1:44:33] like a
[1:44:34] a like a pill of fire he went back
[1:44:37] and there was a rainbow in the room for
[1:44:39] the whole day something like that
[1:44:41] and that is what billy paul had all this
[1:44:42] experience
[1:44:44] all this experience encounters let me
[1:44:45] call it an encounter
[1:44:47] but he didn't have one-on-one experience
[1:44:49] with the lord jesus christ
[1:44:52] so there was a time the enemy
[1:44:53] sidetracked
[1:44:55] he said you follow your dad i mean of
[1:44:57] course your mom is dead
[1:44:59] if your dad you become your daddy's
[1:45:00] puppets you know you go to him to africa
[1:45:02] to germany to europe to
[1:45:04] to preach you don't have fun you don't
[1:45:06] even get time to bounce your basketball
[1:45:07] come on
[1:45:08] do something you got to do something you
[1:45:10] know and they didn't begin to sidetrack
[1:45:12] him
[1:45:12] right you don't have no life just
[1:45:15] fooling your dad
[1:45:16] shame prayer cards come on you're a
[1:45:17] young person you got to get some life
[1:45:19] your father is an old folk so there was
[1:45:22] a time he said you know what daddy
[1:45:25] i want to go and stay with my grandma
[1:45:32] when folks want to do something you come
[1:45:33] up with some excuse
[1:45:35] i want to go and stay with grandma say
[1:45:36] when did you stay with grandma if you
[1:45:38] stayed together
[1:45:39] since your mom died but the prophet saw
[1:45:41] in vision already
[1:45:43] and he gave him advice i said billy
[1:45:45] there's a way before you
[1:45:47] there's a cross on the left and there's
[1:45:50] a way on the live
[1:45:51] that's right you can go all this way you
[1:45:54] have a choice
[1:45:55] i cannot bound you you are my son i love
[1:45:57] you but i cannot
[1:45:58] put a hedge around you that i want to
[1:46:00] hey my son don't go out no
[1:46:02] you are a human being you've got your
[1:46:04] choice but when you get all the way the
[1:46:06] cross will still be where you are
[1:46:08] still be where it is if you go all the
[1:46:11] way left
[1:46:12] the cross will be remain where it is so
[1:46:15] you've got your choice
[1:46:16] so he said well i want to be so he went
[1:46:18] to stay with his grandmom
[1:46:20] because now he wanted to gamble because
[1:46:22] in brahms house you can gamble
[1:46:24] so he went to his grandma now he has his
[1:46:26] own life you could
[1:46:27] go and play basketball whenever you want
[1:46:28] another basketball isn't a problem
[1:46:30] but he wants to go and gamble and do
[1:46:32] things that he wanted to do
[1:46:34] that string voice side tracking from his
[1:46:37] calling
[1:46:37] this man the angel of the lord reveal
[1:46:39] himself to him personally
[1:46:41] and he got attracted to the voice his
[1:46:44] strange voice
[1:46:45] and began to do what he did there was a
[1:46:48] time abraham was preaching as someone he
[1:46:49] came into church
[1:46:50] that the kids were trying to push him to
[1:46:52] go and i mean confess or whatever i go
[1:46:54] to the altar
[1:46:56] and abraham was a gentleman after church
[1:46:58] he talked to him asking how he's doing
[1:47:00] he said billy there's someone that
[1:47:01] there's someone was exactly what his god
[1:47:02] was going through
[1:47:03] so he said billy i didn't preach someone
[1:47:05] again the lord gave it to me two weeks
[1:47:06] ago
[1:47:07] it's not for you because i'm preaching
[1:47:09] this on him i didn't mean to preach
[1:47:10] against you no you know i'll never do
[1:47:11] that
[1:47:12] but you just fell in the same one so it
[1:47:14] might assume that because you're my son
[1:47:16] i'm preaching against you no
[1:47:18] i will never do that the lord gave me
[1:47:20] this sermon two weeks ago
[1:47:21] to preach it and i have to preach it and
[1:47:24] say daddy i know you will never do that
[1:47:26] you'll preach against me and the ram
[1:47:28] even told the dickens that you know what
[1:47:30] i know you have a good intention
[1:47:31] the lord has to do it wow so you can't
[1:47:34] push him to
[1:47:34] confess just leave him pray for him i
[1:47:36] know you love him pray for him and let
[1:47:38] the lord
[1:47:39] do the job so all too soon he fell
[1:47:42] sick at the hospital and began to call
[1:47:45] for his father
[1:47:46] and the eldest of the church he was on
[1:47:48] the verge of dying
[1:47:50] and now he remembered that his father
[1:47:52] was a prophet
[1:47:53] his mama i'm using example your mama
[1:47:56] he's a christian
[1:47:57] your mama is a believer your uncle
[1:48:00] priest
[1:48:01] your pastor prays for the sick so now
[1:48:03] when he got sick
[1:48:04] you didn't invite the people that you
[1:48:06] gamble with no
[1:48:09] what why did he invite you
[1:48:12] people that you drink with why did you
[1:48:14] invite your boyfriend
[1:48:16] why did you invite your girlfriend by
[1:48:18] invited the man that you despise
[1:48:20] the gospel that you despise that can't
[1:48:23] pray for me
[1:48:24] if you know there's a salvation in that
[1:48:26] man the lord is in him
[1:48:28] preaching to you the lord is in your dad
[1:48:31] your uncle your mom your brothers and
[1:48:33] your sisters preaching to you
[1:48:34] why don't you even get so closest to
[1:48:36] them that brother i need to i know that
[1:48:38] someone have got something i don't have
[1:48:40] it
[1:48:40] how can i get it say brother let's go we
[1:48:42] can pray let's go on our knees
[1:48:44] it's not hard and so he covered abraham
[1:48:47] and they went that the kids went to the
[1:48:49] hospital
[1:48:50] and he said well you did your sin so you
[1:48:53] confess first i'm not going to pray for
[1:48:54] you
[1:48:55] you confess you whatever you did let it
[1:48:57] between you and the lord
[1:48:59] you confess everything to the lord jesus
[1:49:00] christ i'm not interested in hearing
[1:49:02] when you confess to the lord then we can
[1:49:04] pray for you
[1:49:05] so he confess his sins whatever he did
[1:49:08] and the lord forgiven they pray for him
[1:49:10] amen but there's consequences
[1:49:13] you know but paul had i think three
[1:49:15] daughters
[1:49:16] and he buried them all so you have to
[1:49:19] have
[1:49:20] the lord is not mocked never think the
[1:49:23] life that is in you is your life is not
[1:49:24] your life
[1:49:25] it's the lord jesus christ it's given to
[1:49:28] you
[1:49:29] amen let them come back to my son and i
[1:49:31] won't keep you long
[1:49:33] that was just by the way but it was
[1:49:35] impressive on my heart to say
[1:49:37] and if i if i hold it's going to hunt to
[1:49:38] me so i have to point out
[1:49:40] amen if the lord the lord said is it
[1:49:43] jeremiah he said jeremiah i sent you you
[1:49:44] said i'm a child so don't say i'm a
[1:49:46] child
[1:49:46] go tell the people they are not the
[1:49:48] people of strange language
[1:49:50] if you don't tell them i'm going to hold
[1:49:51] their blood on you if they are blood
[1:49:53] if they die in their sin their blood
[1:49:55] will be on your hands
[1:49:56] but if you tell them and they are they
[1:49:58] repent then i will save them
[1:50:00] if they don't repent their blood will be
[1:50:01] upon their own head amen
[1:50:03] so preachers have got responsibility to
[1:50:05] tell you the truth whatever the lord put
[1:50:06] upon our heart
[1:50:07] to speak to you is he in amen if you
[1:50:10] take it as a life
[1:50:11] it will transform your life if it
[1:50:12] despises that is between you and the
[1:50:14] lord amen
[1:50:16] libra jack said that i can i can't do
[1:50:18] nothing but i have to pray the word amen
[1:50:20] so you have to preach whatever the lord
[1:50:22] put upon your heart
[1:50:23] now there's a story back to rehab we all
[1:50:26] like rehab we're broken in pieces
[1:50:28] because we are born wrong no because
[1:50:29] you're drunk not because you fornicated
[1:50:31] not because you smoke
[1:50:32] no because you committed adultery but
[1:50:34] because you were born wrong
[1:50:36] that breath is the one that put all of
[1:50:38] us in brokenness
[1:50:40] beside jesus christ adam and mrs saddam
[1:50:43] they didn't come the way we came but the
[1:50:45] rest of creation
[1:50:46] the rest of humankind we came by sex
[1:50:50] and that put us in the form of
[1:50:51] brokenness and so regardless of
[1:50:53] even if you haven't done any sign of
[1:50:55] commission you still have to be
[1:50:57] born again jesus christ to the young
[1:51:00] rich ruler that
[1:51:01] he must be born again receive the word
[1:51:03] that will give you the new breath
[1:51:05] because the new bed that will help you
[1:51:06] to be who you are so rehab in the old
[1:51:08] testament
[1:51:09] a form of new birth by the rest call it
[1:51:12] the rest color is the type of jesus
[1:51:13] christ
[1:51:14] then on calvary for you and i you have
[1:51:17] to have the arrest call it on your door
[1:51:18] post
[1:51:19] as the enemy can so destroy your life
[1:51:22] what is the rescalet it's christ in your
[1:51:25] life
[1:51:25] the pill of fire in you amen receiving
[1:51:28] the word into your heart
[1:51:30] that you and the word become one now
[1:51:32] when he's walking is jesus christ
[1:51:33] working
[1:51:34] people see you as message jesus christ
[1:51:36] because they see
[1:51:38] him in you i think invisible union
[1:51:41] the prophet said that she is him right
[1:51:44] when the seas were open we became christ
[1:51:47] we are no longer alienated from god
[1:51:50] we are him amen we are the lord jesus
[1:51:53] christ working on earth
[1:51:54] and when we see our position in the lord
[1:51:56] when we see who we are
[1:51:58] then we can step in a vision amen
[1:52:02] oh glory hallelujah it's like i want to
[1:52:04] go back glory hallelujah
[1:52:05] but abram wanted when this were open but
[1:52:08] abram was in the house of
[1:52:10] aerys the lord jesus christ is the aries
[1:52:13] the son of god now iran was in pisces
[1:52:16] pisces was a cross fish the seven church
[1:52:18] churches were the gas remember i think
[1:52:20] jack was talking about this morning
[1:52:22] about the jews that in if between the
[1:52:24] old testament
[1:52:25] we the gentiles will not even have the
[1:52:26] privilege to come into the house of god
[1:52:29] but we have been blessed because there
[1:52:30] was a time god crossed
[1:52:32] his hands the blessing of the of the
[1:52:34] firstborn was given to the second born
[1:52:36] amen the blessing of the jews were given
[1:52:39] to us
[1:52:40] because they rejected the gospel and the
[1:52:41] lord said that now i go to the gentiles
[1:52:44] he sent paul irenaeus luther wesley
[1:52:48] abraham and other seven messengers to
[1:52:51] come to the gentiles to give us the word
[1:52:53] so now the lord and the prophet were on
[1:52:56] another dimension but the bride those
[1:52:58] time the bride haven't received
[1:53:00] when the seats were open but asked
[1:53:02] people to ask him question
[1:53:03] and they said abraham can a woman color
[1:53:05] her hair
[1:53:07] when he's preached about the seven
[1:53:08] thunders revealed seven seas review they
[1:53:11] were talking about their hair
[1:53:12] abram was disappointed they said oh lord
[1:53:15] say i know it's not the time yet for
[1:53:16] them to see it
[1:53:19] hey we've read this one as fundamental
[1:53:21] since he started his ministry in 33.
[1:53:24] what does he coloring or hair got to do
[1:53:26] it with the serving seals
[1:53:28] but it wasn't time for them receive it
[1:53:31] so he said whatever you have you keep on
[1:53:32] being good person
[1:53:34] serving the lord just be who you are but
[1:53:36] there will be a generation
[1:53:39] those who come after the eighth come
[1:53:40] after the seventh church is the eighth
[1:53:42] day
[1:53:43] they are the one the wife of christ that
[1:53:46] the lord will reveal this to them the
[1:53:47] lord will hide in them
[1:53:49] and manifest the seven seals on earth
[1:53:51] amen
[1:53:52] so there was a time when the lord began
[1:53:54] to deal with the body of christ
[1:53:56] god to know that the seven sisters are
[1:53:57] not strained the seventh thunders are
[1:53:58] christ
[1:53:59] in you it's not something coming in the
[1:54:01] future it's not really
[1:54:02] abraham resurrecting him brings
[1:54:04] something again no but it's jesus christ
[1:54:06] here on earth
[1:54:08] william ram paved the way for christ and
[1:54:10] christ has taken over his wife
[1:54:11] involved marriage after the seven church
[1:54:13] ages the seven churches were
[1:54:16] messengers but after the seven church
[1:54:18] ages christ and his wife are united
[1:54:20] that's revelation chapter 10 verse 8 to
[1:54:22] 11
[1:54:23] amen and the wife has a ministry
[1:54:26] before you leave the earth as a body of
[1:54:29] christ
[1:54:29] and as an individual you've got a
[1:54:31] ministry and you have to manifest your
[1:54:33] ministry
[1:54:34] and just like rehab we have a ministry
[1:54:36] to go to become to become adopted
[1:54:39] he was incarcerated into that family and
[1:54:41] he has to bring forth
[1:54:42] children that the lord jesus christ will
[1:54:44] come through amen
[1:54:46] and your earth that the lord jesus
[1:54:48] christ wants to come to your earth
[1:54:50] is put you here on in west palm beach or
[1:54:52] wherever you are
[1:54:53] for a divine purpose the purpose in your
[1:54:56] earth
[1:54:57] amen that jesus christ himself will be
[1:54:59] born out of your flesh
[1:55:01] glory there are people around you that
[1:55:02] you should redeem them how do i redeem
[1:55:04] them
[1:55:05] rehab was a redeemer when she got to
[1:55:06] know her please
[1:55:10] she got to know that oh really i'm not a
[1:55:12] prostitute no
[1:55:13] that's life garbage trash

[1:55:31] she became a hebrew
[1:55:33] the one who was originally a from
[1:55:35] jericho
[1:55:36] she was no longer a gentile but she was
[1:55:38] a supernatural hebrew
[1:55:40] amen and she married to salomon salmon
[1:55:44] who gave a peace perfected her and gave
[1:55:46] her rewards
[1:55:48] of children amen the spoken word

[1:56:11] maybe you're a bad attender or you
[1:56:14] you've got you
[1:56:15] whatever you do that you know it's not
[1:56:17] godly
[1:56:18] and you forsake it and i receive the
[1:56:20] lord what will i get
[1:56:22] the lord will give you eternal life
[1:56:24] number one
[1:56:25] because you don't have eternal life you
[1:56:27] don't know even who you are you think
[1:56:29] you are
[1:56:29] something i have my own life no you
[1:56:32] don't have no life
[1:56:33] that life can perish it's perishable
[1:56:35] life
[1:56:36] it's like a meat when you buy a meat it
[1:56:38] doesn't last you put it for a while it's
[1:56:40] beginning to perish
[1:56:41] so this life is a meat if that's what
[1:56:43] you have your faith in
[1:56:44] it's perish but it's an unperishable
[1:56:46] life the theophany
[1:56:48] the eternal part of you that is a tenor
[1:56:51] and that is one that lives eternally
[1:56:53] amen that is the one that is in you
[1:56:56] is christ in your form amen christ wants
[1:57:00] to be part of you
[1:57:01] and how could be part of you he also had
[1:57:03] a body that doesn't perish
[1:57:04] there's only one form of eternal life
[1:57:07] there's no two billion eternal life
[1:57:09] it's only one eternal life what's that
[1:57:10] eternal life jesus christ
[1:57:12] i think recently abby but abi was asking
[1:57:15] a question
[1:57:16] now how can i how can god live in many
[1:57:19] people
[1:57:20] if he's only one person said that's a
[1:57:22] good question
[1:57:23] but god is infinite he's not finite like
[1:57:27] my body is finite here to be able to be
[1:57:29] there i have to move
[1:57:30] here and when i'm here i'm no longer
[1:57:32] there but the spirit
[1:57:34] is infinite a spirit can live in more
[1:57:37] vessels
[1:57:39] more so omnipotent god elohim can live
[1:57:42] in every one of us
[1:57:43] or the body of christ and there was a
[1:57:46] sister i'll
[1:57:46] share a testimony i'm about to close
[1:57:48] there was a sister
[1:57:50] a christian who said the lord who had
[1:57:53] christ in earth now this sister had a
[1:57:56] cancer
[1:57:57] she was dying on a hospital in a
[1:57:59] hospital and
[1:58:00] a stranger knocked at a hospital at the
[1:58:02] room that she was
[1:58:05] and he said can i come in they say sure
[1:58:08] when she came said can i take a picture
[1:58:09] of you
[1:58:10] say sure she took a picture polaroid
[1:58:12] picture i think one of those disposable
[1:58:14] old-fashioned camera she left it there
[1:58:17] and she went he went away he and they
[1:58:20] took their picture this is that past the
[1:58:21] way they developed the picture
[1:58:23] and they saw the sister of course lying
[1:58:24] at the on the hospital bed
[1:58:28] and then her children he's got a little
[1:58:30] kids around
[1:58:31] they visited at the hospital and had few
[1:58:33] funny
[1:58:34] on the right side of the hospital and
[1:58:38] they had they look went into an old
[1:58:39] album of this sister
[1:58:41] and they realized that the picture her
[1:58:42] theophany was exactly the same as
[1:58:45] a picture of her when she was younger
[1:58:50] i want to read the scripture before i
[1:58:51] continue
[1:58:53] let's let's read the hebrews chapter
[1:58:56] hebrews sorry if second corinthians
[1:58:58] chapter
[1:59:00] 5 verse one that's my closing scripture
[1:59:05] second corinthians one to see the reward
[1:59:08] of eternal life
[1:59:09] blessed be the name of the lord amen two
[1:59:16] corinthians
[1:59:17] five one
[1:59:22] can somebody help me with the reading
[1:59:26] okay but yeah but just come and help
[1:59:32] for we know that if our earthly house
[1:59:36] of this tabernacle were dissolved we
[1:59:39] have a building of building of god
[1:59:43] and house not made with hands in
[1:59:46] eternal in the heavens for in this
[1:59:50] we groan earnestly desiring to be
[1:59:54] clothed clothed upon
[1:59:57] with our house which is from heaven
[2:00:00] if so be that being clothed
[2:00:04] we shall not be found naked
[2:00:07] for we that are in this tabernacle
[2:00:11] do grown being burdened
[2:00:14] not for that we would be unclothed
[2:00:18] but clothed upon that mortality
[2:00:22] might be swallowed up of life
[2:00:26] now he that hath
[2:00:29] wrought us for the self same thing
[2:00:33] is god who also has given up
[2:00:36] unto us the earnest of the spirit
[2:00:42] god bless you god bless you brother
[2:00:45] joseph
[2:00:46] anders of the spirit amen
[2:00:50] and i want to share something with you
[2:00:56] can you help me i don't have maybe i
[2:00:58] don't know it might not be
[2:01:02] probably that i don't have family each
[2:01:04] one can have one probably maybe not
[2:01:06] if not our princeton later and i want to
[2:01:09] see the reward
[2:01:11] of eternal life that went early in the
[2:01:15] picture
[2:01:16] that brother brother stephen is sharing
[2:01:24] you see the sister lying on lino
[2:01:27] hospital bed
[2:01:29] and their true hair you know this gospel
[2:01:33] that the prophets are not people who
[2:01:35] excuse me to say they don't drink they
[2:01:36] don't smoke weed or drink
[2:01:39] a sniff cocaine or take tobacco and come
[2:01:42] and say that says the lord
[2:01:44] no it's almighty god speaking through
[2:01:46] them and that word that they speak
[2:01:49] is ye and amen it's not a word of
[2:01:51] falsehood
[2:01:52] amen we are not believing in fables we
[2:01:55] are not believing in some of these
[2:01:56] fables
[2:01:57] we are not believing in we are not
[2:02:00] believing in
[2:02:01] a fable
[2:02:06] we are not believing in some fables from
[2:02:08] a man but we are living in
[2:02:09] reality that when this earthly
[2:02:11] tabernacle be dissolved
[2:02:13] we haven't won which is in you amen
[2:02:17] all the experience that you learned on
[2:02:18] this earth in this 16 element
[2:02:21] when you finish your life the holy ghost
[2:02:24] will transport it
[2:02:26] to the theophany in you to transport it
[2:02:29] to the other side
[2:02:30] now heaven is real is not a place that
[2:02:32] we wonder about
[2:02:34] is right here just that we are of the
[2:02:36] human flesh is of another dimension
[2:02:39] and the heavily celestial dimension is
[2:02:41] of also another dimension
[2:02:43] so they of that dimension see you
[2:02:46] by real of this dimension unless through
[2:02:48] visions
[2:02:49] through inspiration through revelation
[2:02:52] through trans
[2:02:53] that is when we see the other dimension
[2:02:55] there was a time i don't know your
[2:02:56] experience but
[2:02:57] the more i pray god give us more
[2:02:58] supernatural greater dynamics and that's
[2:03:01] what the lord is doing
[2:03:02] there was a time that when if you are by
[2:03:04] yourself when you a place where
[2:03:06] there's nobody with you sometimes i
[2:03:08] don't know if it's like somebody's
[2:03:09] following you but there's nobody
[2:03:11] following you and it's scary is that
[2:03:13] select the being in you
[2:03:15] wanted you to unveil himself to you and
[2:03:18] if you can take it
[2:03:19] that is a celestial body want to have is
[2:03:21] in you but when there's no
[2:03:23] there's no people around you want to
[2:03:24] have that sweet communion with you
[2:03:26] there's a time when you pray you move
[2:03:28] into the spirit you go over beyond this
[2:03:30] mind
[2:03:31] you could see the celestial dimension
[2:03:33] around you
[2:03:34] i see somebody standing by you it is the
[2:03:36] being it is your true self
[2:03:38] that is making himself known to you
[2:03:40] there was a time i was praying for a
[2:03:41] brother
[2:03:42] he was sick i went to his house to pray
[2:03:43] for me and his family and as i was
[2:03:46] praying i see the being in me moving out
[2:03:48] of me
[2:03:49] going to the brother and i didn't know
[2:03:51] that brother had that experience so
[2:03:52] after we finished the brother the lord
[2:03:53] said that i said brother when you pray
[2:03:54] for me
[2:03:55] i saw the holy ghost coming from you and
[2:03:58] touching my body
[2:04:00] god has got eternal purpose for you in
[2:04:02] earth
[2:04:04] your life is to influence people your
[2:04:07] life is to bring in
[2:04:08] a benefit dividend return on investment
[2:04:12] the lord has invested eternal life he
[2:04:14] gave us food
[2:04:16] clothing houses shelter family
[2:04:19] school job cities peace security for you
[2:04:24] just for you
[2:04:25] amen what are you giving back to god
[2:04:29] he heals your sickness he takes care of
[2:04:31] your family
[2:04:33] he put food on your table when you sick
[2:04:36] people blackjack will pray for you
[2:04:38] your brothers and sisters will pray for
[2:04:39] you the lord heals you
[2:04:42] you just are you in earth just to eat
[2:04:44] drink
[2:04:45] and go back that when you go the lord
[2:04:48] gave a gift to people
[2:04:50] if i think the four or whatever people
[2:04:52] that you give give to
[2:04:54] you give one i'm just making up numbers
[2:04:56] one a talent
[2:04:57] right they're probably the talents one
[2:04:59] hundred one fifty
[2:05:01] thirty and five and two and one
[2:05:03] something like that
[2:05:04] and one person chose that you know what
[2:05:06] this person is a mean person i'm not
[2:05:08] going to
[2:05:09] spend my time you know working for him
[2:05:11] i'm going to put one talent
[2:05:12] there when he come back i'll give it
[2:05:14] back give me one one dollar that's your
[2:05:16] one dollar take it back
[2:05:18] so the man came back in the day of
[2:05:19] reckoning that hey i want to
[2:05:21] see what you did with the talent say
[2:05:23] well the one who
[2:05:24] got hundred well i make hundred okay
[2:05:26] good good seven stand here
[2:05:27] um you gave me fifty i made fifty i made
[2:05:29] thirty the one that had one said well i
[2:05:31] know you're a wicked person
[2:05:33] you want to reap what you did so so i've
[2:05:35] got your one dollar here for you take it
[2:05:36] back
[2:05:37] really you could have put an investment
[2:05:39] somewhere if you think i'm wiki
[2:05:41] i want to reap when i don't sue is there
[2:05:43] a lot of wicked persons that a lot
[2:05:44] cassimo to the outer darkness
[2:05:46] if the gift the lord put in your life
[2:05:49] you don't use it for god's glory
[2:05:51] your life you don't want to live the
[2:05:53] christian life you don't want christ to
[2:05:54] marry to you
[2:05:55] but you want to have your own life on
[2:05:57] quotes you'll find out pretty soon
[2:05:59] whether that
[2:06:00] belongs to you or not so this day
[2:06:03] if you've heard the voice of god let's
[2:06:05] commit all our heart to the lord
[2:06:07] and this is an evidence of a sister this
[2:06:09] i think somewhere 2008
[2:06:11] a minister posted it the lord is real
[2:06:14] the gospel is real but abram didn't come
[2:06:17] to deceive us no
[2:06:18] he didn't come to tell us fables no the
[2:06:20] lord didn't send prophet
[2:06:21] to come and tell a story don't pay he to
[2:06:24] lose a voice
[2:06:25] no don't let somebody deceive you out of
[2:06:28] the message that the word of the lord is
[2:06:29] not true
[2:06:30] but give all your soul all your heart
[2:06:34] and the day that even you leave this
[2:06:35] flesh you'll be walking the celestial
[2:06:37] dimension
[2:06:38] when your children are crying say oh for
[2:06:40] them they don't know where i am
[2:06:41] i'm here in this celestial dimension i'm
[2:06:43] shaking out with my sin with the sins
[2:06:45] i'm here before the lord and that is the
[2:06:47] gospel the lord has given to us
[2:06:49] god bless you
[2:07:02] we have another tamaraco in us that is
[2:07:05] non-perishable
[2:07:07] it's antenna it passes through walls it
[2:07:10] passes through

[2:11:10] the opportunity just to share some of
[2:11:12] those
[2:11:12] testimonies and they encourage people
[2:11:15] all over the world but
[2:11:16] he could have been a preacher but his
[2:11:19] decisions as a young man
[2:11:21] caused him to lose his ministry we need

[2:13:10] so because the the god that i know
[2:13:13] when he cast out devils i want to show
[2:13:16] y'all how he did it
[2:13:17] [Music]
[2:13:19] amen that's the god that i know
[2:13:23] the the bible say by the finger of god
[2:13:28] by the thing of god devils were were
[2:13:31] cast out right
[2:13:32] did jesus just walk up and just leave
[2:13:35] i mean even even when legion jesus
[2:13:38] didn't even say nothing
[2:13:40] legion they actually
[2:13:43] knew their time was up they come begging
[2:13:47] would you please not send us you know to
[2:13:50] the abyss
[2:13:51] but let us go into the swine they knew
[2:13:54] they time was up
[2:13:55] it's time for people to know and we
[2:13:58] would talk about dynamics and mechanics
[2:14:00] and
[2:14:00] and i'm seeing dynamics i'm seeing it
[2:14:02] i'm seeing it sometimes we don't see it
[2:14:05] you know we think it's because we don't
[2:14:06] see certain things here but god is
[2:14:08] moving church
[2:14:10] and i'm just sitting there just trying
[2:14:11] to pick up on things pick up on things
[2:14:14] and yesterday the lord just kind of had
[2:14:16] me ask a question
[2:14:18] and i just asked a question i just let
[2:14:20] it be i just let it be
[2:14:22] but i know god don't just have you say
[2:14:24] things just to say things
[2:14:26] because there's certain reasons why
[2:14:28] devil will feel
[2:14:30] comfortable staying in certain
[2:14:32] situations
[2:14:34] [Music]
[2:14:36] you need man we need we talked about it
[2:14:39] you know
[2:14:40] and and bible study i want to say a few
[2:14:43] few months ago about the spirit of
[2:14:45] wisdom
[2:14:48] coming into the church and and sometimes
[2:14:50] that's what we need for you just jump up
[2:14:52] and
[2:14:52] in the name of jesus just wait
[2:14:56] wait and get the spirit of wisdom
[2:14:59] let them come down and speak something
[2:15:02] to you
[2:15:03] right because you get so alert alarmed
[2:15:05] and alerted
[2:15:06] and you just i mean you know i'ma tell
[2:15:09] you a person that know they got power
[2:15:12] don't yell and scream
[2:15:14] [Music]
[2:15:18] the person that really know where they
[2:15:19] position they don't get on the screen
[2:15:21] i remember my uncle you know he was in
[2:15:23] the military and
[2:15:26] he walked into a room and he started
[2:15:28] seeing guys they having a conversation
[2:15:29] they stop
[2:15:33] i say well my lord what in the world is
[2:15:36] going on here
[2:15:38] he knew there's certain bars
[2:15:41] that he wearing oh come on church
[2:15:46] certain balls that he wearing and and he
[2:15:48] all
[2:15:49] everybody understand they they they
[2:15:51] position
[2:15:52] because of those bars hallelujah to the
[2:15:56] lamb of god
[2:15:57] it's time for the devil to recognize the
[2:15:59] sons of god's position
[2:16:01] because of what christ has done for us
[2:16:04] but first we need to know what he's done
[2:16:06] for us
[2:16:08] church we got to be running from devils
[2:16:09] and all this other kind of stuff we need
[2:16:11] to know who we are
[2:16:12] and take take your place with authority

[2:23:18] image of god and lord as
[2:23:21] uh brother kwaku just began to go
[2:23:23] through and
[2:23:24] many of us sometimes we think that this
[2:23:27] life that we have that we gave it to
[2:23:29] ourselves
[2:23:31] we don't realize it's you that breathe
[2:23:33] the breath of life into our bodies
[2:23:37] no matter what our circumstances and
[2:23:39] situations are you breathe the breath of
[2:23:40] life and
[2:23:41] and god uh sometimes we get to the point
[2:23:44] where we think that we can just do
[2:23:45] whatever we want to do
[2:23:48] but lord i thank you that your grace
[2:23:50] would speak to us amen and the way that
[2:23:52] you spoke to us this morning that we
[2:23:53] would just
[2:23:54] if we would hear it we would humble
[2:23:56] ourselves in your very presence
[2:23:59] and realize god that we can't live the
[2:24:02] way that we want to live
[2:24:03] even in the midst of our sin you have
[2:24:05] been watching over us
[2:24:08] your grace has still been covering us
[2:24:10] lord even in the midst of us doing
[2:24:11] things that we
[2:24:12] should not be doing you have still been
[2:24:14] covering us and god

[2:24:32] you told us any word as many as believed
[2:24:34] on him
[2:24:35] to them gave he power to become
[2:24:38] the sons and daughters of god
[2:24:42] lord i pray somebody would just believe
[2:24:44] right now believe that you spoke to him
[2:24:46] believe
[2:24:47] god that it wasn't just brother quaker

[2:24:58] the word of god

[2:25:05] thank you for your servant getting
[2:25:06] himself out of the way and
[2:25:08] just allowing your father just to share
[2:25:10] through his lips the various testimonies
[2:25:12] and
[2:25:13] lord things that he's experienced and
[2:25:15] god just
[2:25:16] uh it's it's what we call a spirit of
[2:25:18] pride that rises up inside of people
[2:25:21] causes them to do these things that
[2:25:23] little
[2:25:24] bitty spirit of pride leads to
[2:25:27] destruction
[2:25:29] god i pray that you would help us oh god

[2:25:38] that you continue to bless them and
[2:25:39] continue to use them for your glory

[2:26:04] no matter what is going on father as we
[2:26:06] got this just uh looking at billy paul's
[2:26:09] life and some of the things that he went
[2:26:10] through but yet lord you've used them
[2:26:12] for your glory with the
[2:26:13] many testimonies that he's given and and
[2:26:16] father how he has blessed us
[2:26:18] over the years we're grateful for it but
[2:26:20] i pray lord that others will be able to
[2:26:22] just kind of look to that and see
[2:26:24] the grace of god that's been given to a
[2:26:26] man
[2:26:28] and have such a supernatural experience
[2:26:31] but if it's not something happened on
[2:26:32] the inside
[2:26:34] then lord is it's just it's not meeting
[2:26:37] the mark
[2:26:39] so i pray god you help us all to rise up
[2:26:41] and meet the mark
[2:26:43] we need more of you jesus
[2:26:47] bless us as we prepare to leave this
[2:26:49] place but not your presence
[2:26:52] may the spirit of god go with us may we
[2:26:54] meditate on the things that we heard may
[2:26:56] we talk about the things that we heard
[2:26:57] here today
[2:26:59] and may the glory of god just draw near
[2:27:01] if there's
[2:27:02] anything in our lives that we need to
[2:27:04] fix and straighten out god i pray the
[2:27:06] spirit of god would not give us rest
