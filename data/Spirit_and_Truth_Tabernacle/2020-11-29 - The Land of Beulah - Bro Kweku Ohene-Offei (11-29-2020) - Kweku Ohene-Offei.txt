you brother god bless you sisters glory hallelujah to the lord amen our lord is good amen we might take our bible and just read the scripture and i'll let you have your seat let's look at isaiah the book of isaiah chapter 62 verses 1 to 5 isaiah 62 1-5 and we want to speak on a little simon and the title is the land of beulah or we know bella land we have a song that we sing oh beulahlan swee bula land and so on and so forth so let's read isaiah 62. it goes for zion's sick will i not hold my peace and for jerusalem sick i will not rest until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness and the salvation thereof as a lamp that beneth 2 and the gentiles shall see thy righteousness and all kings thy glory and thou shalt be called by a new name which the mouth of the lord shall name thou shall also be crowned thou shall also be a crown of glory in the in the hand of the lord and arroyo died them in the hand of thy god verse 4 thou shalt no more be termed forsaken neither shall thy land anymore be tempt desolate but thou shall be called hefzeba and thyland beulah for the lord delights in thee and thy land shall be married five for as a young man married a virgin so shall thy sons marry thee and as the bridegroom rejoices over their bride so shall that god rejoice over thee god bless you shall we take our seed the land of beulah amen bela land so what is we want to break a couple of the terms from the scriptures that we read so that we can have some basis to to fly on it's like when you go to the airport and uh before that the flight the jet plane takes off they go they kind of gather momentum gather their velocity by just going on the earth for a long time for a little period of time to get the engines going to shrink themselves to be in a flight mode to taxi and do what they need to do so we want to just break a couple of times here from the scriptures now verse 1 said that for zion's sick i will not hold my peace i believe all of us understand peace peace is rest in your heart absence of war absence of struggle when you've got the rest the rest of christ in your heart we can break even into you can break it into different category we can talk about peace let's say you walk people work like 12-hour shifts people do night shifts so they work all night when others are sleeping and they come back in the morning maybe eight o'clock seven o'clock nine o'clock tired broken and they just jump on their bed and they sleep like a dead person that could be a piece for them because they are no longer working with machines they are not with a supervisor they know what bosses and they've got peace that is the human peace peace could be a struggle you're struggling to achieve something when you achieve it your heart is at rest right we can use it as a peace peace is why when people have financial security they have peace when the economy is going haywire people don't don't have peace because they don't know how whether they are going to be laid off their their investment what is going to happen their investment their pension so it brings agitation on their mind but then when the economy is going good hey wall street is doing good people at peace i mean there's joy everywhere you know people can buy and sell people can make money online just name it you know there's peace it's all good but then there's one piece that is what we're talking about eternal peace that wall street cannot give you that the economy cannot give you your supervisor can you cannot give you sleeping will not give you that peace but the peace that the almighty gives unto you amen so that is the peace we're talking about then we read about zion what is zion zion is nothing but the queen of heaven who lives in earth and you are zion amen so good morning zion zion don't look at zion as something some mountains sitting in israel they were all types and shadows but the true zion is you amen you who came from heaven from the mouth of god from the mind of god from the pillar of fire himself from the almighty who created the heaven and earth you came from him and you are his wife you are the queen of heaven you are in earth amen you are not just earthly being but you are a celestial being though you are you are you are engulfed around a lot of flesh cobra solomon amen a lot of flesh called uh brother uh calib calib amen so that is that is uh but before you became f you were a zion in heaven amen so we want what is jerusalem jerusalem can be broken into pieces jeru and salem jeru means god salem is city of peace now what is the city of peace is it a los angeles of course there's no peace over there fire bushfire and chaos and suicide united states there's no peace anywhere black lives matter white lives matter and what have you people marching to wall street presents presidential election at stake different things we don't know who is we don't know what's going on so there's no peace in the united states which country england no peace buckingham palace no peace russia no peace africa no peace haiti no peace so there's no peace anywhere on the land where you can say this is absolute place when i go to los angeles california i've got a piece no when i go to new york city bronze i've got peace no when i go to uh south africa cape town i've got peace no when i'm in mexico i've got peace there's no peace no way there's only one peace that comes from the lord and that is by the baptism of the holy spirit when the old nature is dissolved and god gives you that city then you become a peace not just that you you have peace but you are an epitome you are the center of peace you are the embodiment of peace you are the manifestation of peace you are a fountain of peace amen because peace himself is in you amen amen glory hallelujah to the lord blessed be the name of the lord so that is jerusalem gas city of peace now we talk about um we talk about bula that's where we're going to center what is that what is a hebrew word bela means owner or ownership beulah also means master bila means lord and it also means married and claimed as a wife married not just married but you are claimed as a wife heavenly zion amen so can the lord claim you as a wife are you married to him and can he claim you as his wife that he can trust in you that he can boost about you that you display his attribute or you don't you are not even married to him at all if you haven't done the marriage then you can do the marriage today and if you are married to him and you are not manifesting the marriage you don't have the marriage certificate you can do that today amen because god is love today this is the day the lord has made we are glad we are having a wedding right now so where's the word where's the brother the groom the bread is you and the groom is the lord jesus christ amen so people are going to receive the avoiding certificate today if you open your heart to the word of the lord the word has got the power to transform you to change your nature and give you the heavenly jerusalem amen so that you become the god city of peace working on earth in earth but you are embodiment of peace blessed be the name of the lord glory want to read this a little scripture here to just break down beulah or the the other word i wanted to break down is hefziba health ziba means my delight is in her my delight is in her who is mine christ who is her you his wife the delight of the husband is in the wife so the delight of christ jesus is not in the trees it's not in a white house it's not in the nations but is the nation of his wife amen the city of his wife you that is married to you that is giving his wedding a ring unto amen and let's see that he didn't just give a wedding ring but i gave you crowns i died him what is that item i want to go further a little bit but then let's read a scripture from daniel 7 18. daniel 7 18 reads by the saints of the most high take the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever even forever and ever amen the sins of the mosaic shall take the kingdom what is the kingdom the kingdom is the holy ghost baptism it is not white house kingdom it is not a russian kingdom is not the zulu of south africa but the kingdom we're talking about is the kingdom of jesus christ amen let's read a little bit further uh matthew 5 3 to 3 to 5. it reads blessed are the poor in spirit matthew 5 3-5 blessed are the poor in spirit for this is the kingdom of heaven blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted blessed are they meek for they shall inherit the earth amen the meek those who are mourning the poor in spirit this is the kingdom what is the kingdom is the sixth dimension christ himself and what is the earth the earth is what you have around you the spoken word of god upon all the earth god elected you just took a piece of atom cosmic light uh calcium potassium ion and put it together by the spoken word and created brother solomon amen that is what the city god wants to dwell in that is the earth and because heaven is living in earth there's comfort in your heart regardless of whatever situation that comes your way amen and let me read the the scripture that pertains to another scripture psalm 37 22 for such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth and the and they that are cursed of him shall be cut off they that are blessed will inherit the earth who are those that are blessed those who sleep are in the lamp's book of life every human being on earth has his or her name in the book of life what is the book of life the book of life is the earth and the air that you breathe the human life which was born in 1952 which dies in 2020 or who died in 2020 the human life has a beginning and has an end that is the book of life animals have got book of life plans of god book of life all human beings regardless of what they've got book book of life adolf hitler had a book of life because he was a human being he had a a breath in in his heart but abram went to i think south africa and they learned a word called amoya amoya means they have different meanings of ammonia it means the unseen force the unseen wind and it also means the breath that we breathe so abraham preaches someone blasphemous name he said if all of us we all breathe amoya we breathe the air if all of us have got eternal life then why do we struggle for eternal life if their breath the oxygen that we breathe the ammonia is eternal life then why do we struggle because all humanities are struggling for eternal life you say over a quick not everybody people are clapping and dancing and they are doing stuff yes those in hollywood they want to eternal life that's what they spend millions to do a cosmetic surgery because they want to live forever because in them they know that there's something about living eternally about eternal life but in their mind they think doing plastic surgery cosmetic surgery and trying to stay in young uncoats forever will make them live eternally but it doesn't happen that way sometimes they end up committing suicide upon all the millions and the billions because they don't have the peace they don't have mount zion they don't have villa land in their heart their hand is their their land is not fertilized as builder land but when the land is becomes builder land then you've got that peace that you don't have to pay money to do cosmetic surgery it doesn't matter what happened to this earthly flesh there's a being who lives eternally amen glory hallelujah to the lord blessed be the name of the lord let's break then the book of life let him finish that thought the book of life the lamb's book of life is the eternal life the life that has no beginning it doesn't have above date it might began manifesting at a certain time but the life itself does not have a beginning amen for example you can go and scoop a soil and put in a plant and put a flower in it or plant a seed in it and you can put a deet this soil was taken at this time i put mango tree i put a hibiscus flower in this plant in the soil but the soil was there way before you were born the soil didn't begin when you scooped it and tried to put a seed in it the soil has been there maybe started manifesting becoming a soil where plant your plant or your flower or your seed was living in it but the soil has ever been there since the lord's put it into existence so the word of god the seed in you has always been there it doesn't matter when you were born it's a tenor is the almighty himself is jesus christ and it has not it does not it doesn't have a beginning it does not have an end and that's eternal life and that is a gift of god that is the lamb's book of life so one time i think the prophet was asked what is the difference between the lamb book of life are they the lamb's book of life and the book of life are they two separate books he said yeah it looks like there are two but in reality in essence it's one book there's only one brother solomon i can see a shadow a little shadow of him there so you might look at two okay brother salomon and brother solomon but it's only one it's original brother solomon that is casting a shadow of of brother solomon that you see on earth the trooper that solomon is the tenor being his shadow is what you see is what you hack what you shake hands with is what sings but a true better solomon is the one that lives on the inside of brother solomon it's only one amen there's only one form of eternal life and that is jesus christ that has no beginning that has no end and that is the lamb's book of life that's good goes beyond amoya one time the same bahram saw a young man in south africa i think it was like from a tribe called huttington and he was carrying an idol and was supposed to be a christian so he was working walking traveling with i think one brother called sidney jackson if i'm if i remember correctly he was a mayor of south africa somewhere and said why is he carrying this idol let's ask him a question he said are you a christian say yes i'm a christian and he mentioned his name abraham of course couldn't say the name so it's okay since you're chris i'm going to call you thomas thomas why are you a christian and so having parking idols say well these adults were given to me by my dad one time my dad was in the woods and a lion appeared and my dad set a fire and consorted the idols and the lion ran away and so no it wasn't the light it wasn't the idol it wasn't a moya it was a fire that scared the lion and he said if amoya fails i i'll use the second idol so ram said well you don't need ammo yeah you need jesus christ when you have jesus christ in your heart you are all secured you don't have to have another backup the backup of all the backup of all the backup is the lord jesus christ so when you have him in your heart you just let him take care of situation if you have jesus christ in your heart and you need another backup then you don't really have him if you have jesus christ if you think jesus christ can take your situation and you're still like no maybe jesus christ cannot take it he might be able to but you know what i think brother susie can help me better so let me get back brother jose as a backup then you don't really have jesus christ if you have a vehicle let's say a ford and you think uh the ford has a problem you have a problem with the vehicle and you think fourth company can do it you send it to ford company you don't send it to chevy because ford is the one who manufactured a vehicle and they know their needed greatest about their vehicle they know what is how it's whatever every part the engine how it works they know their horsepower in it they know what to do with it so when your for your fault breaks down you take your default company and they will fix it for you but then if you think this fourth company cannot do it i need to get a chevy company then you don't really have faith in the fourth company so if you have christ in your life you think you have christ in your life and you can rest on him have peace in christ then you don't have christ because if you have christ in your life in the midst of the storm in the midst of the difficulties in crisis time yes you might go through crisis the boat will be i mean dangling on the river but yes so christ in you the hope of glory and the expression of glory in your earth will tilt the boat to the right direction we will streamline the boat in the direction that it should go we'll bring peace we'll uncut the boat amen so you need to christ for your security for everything amen and if you don't have him then life is full of chaos nothing will hold for you money will not hold nothing marriage doesn't hold children will not hold family will be broken and nothing job nothing careers will not help you can get all the best career you can achieve your so-called life dream be on the top of the ladder yes you don't have peace in your heart there are people who have got money but they can't sleep without taking about six tablets of medication before they go to sleep some take about 12 medication but they have all their money they can go for all the vacation they've got properties around the world but they cannot have a simple six hour sleep without taking about three to twelve medication and sometimes it doesn't even last they can't go to sleep for six hours or eight hours they can get two hours they wake up and sit on their bed watch television but you have christ in your life it doesn't matter what is going on outside remember jesus was on the boat the boat was capsizing and there was torment and storm but it was fast asleep and snoring because he was the master of peace the circumstances doesn't change his situation he wasn't a situational god he was he wasn't a situational christian and let me break break it a little bit situational christian is like when you're in crisis oh i know hurricane is coming hey i got to be in church where's i mean brazil please open the church door i need to be in church i need to pray please please pray for me because hurricane is coming because there's a there's a crisis there's a global pandemic chronovirus i need to be a christian fellow i need to be a crippy when chronovirus is over oh now you have ever seen i can go back to my old life and have fun enjoy the world so you're a situational christian when a condition arises you are a christian when that condition is over you are no longer a christian when you are sick you need prayer from the lord you want to be around god's people when you are healed back in the world and doing foolish things that is a situational christian but the one who is a christian through and through it doesn't matter just like the lord regardless of the storm he was sleeping at peace because he has got a spoken word in him to speak the storm out of creation he can speak into creation and he can speak out of creation amen and the same power is in you you can speak situation into creation and speak it out of creation a minister traveled to israel and he met a jewish rabbi and he was sharing the word of the lord with him of course being a staunch jewish he wasn't believing that no messiah is not here yet we are still waiting for the messiah and he said well the loss god sent the messiah yeshua elohim sent a prophet and that prophet spoke cancer out of existence and he spoke squirrel into existence and said he's a prophet he must be a prophet because we the jewish people our prophet speaks things into creation and they can speak things out of creation so if that gentle prophet william abraham spoke things into creation and spoke things out of creation he's the prophet of the lord and that man believe the word of the lord at that hour because a prophet speaks into creation and you are prophet a priest and a king and a queen you can speak things out of creation and speak things into creation if there's a situation in your life or in your loved one's life and it's not a good situation it's an adverse situation the lord has got given you the authority to speak in it out of out of creation to speak healing into creation one time william brown's wife says tamida had a tumor you know how how it started she had a little a little bit of a disrespect for the husband and the lord was mad so there was a tumor she was tricking by timon but it didn't manifest until like a year and it became big bigger and bigger and it got to the side like size of a lemon so they had to do a surgery but ram has been praying the same time period of time he was praying for people when they are getting healed he was healing the sick raising the dead but his own wife was in trouble he prayed and fasted with everything that was in him it looks like the lord wasn't listening so they had to do a surgery on their surgery abraham decided to go home and pray for the last time so he went home and he prayed and the lord said why are you troubling me why are you getting trouble speak what you want and he said before the doctor touched my wife before the doctor touches my wife let the tumor vanish and the daughter has prepared the tumor prepared the surgery they were going to do surgery and they couldn't find a cell he couldn't find a tumor where's the tumor i think they look at the x-ray it's supposed to be maybe on the right side it's not there it's not the left what's going on here and the ram appeared at the hospital room said be still be at peace the lord has already taken care of situation he's the master physician the chief surgeon and when you have the feet sometimes you build your faith you might it might seem the lord is not listening to your prayers you might assume the lord doesn't care about your situation but he wants you to your feet to go higher and higher and higher and higher so you get to know that my solution is in me because i've got christ in me and when the christ see me when i resurrect brenda christ i mean to create into manifestation everything is done you are looking this way for solution you are looking this way for solution but the solution is in your heart he said the kingdom of god is not in the north or the south the kingdom of god is in you amen the holy spirit is in you and that creative spirit creative power is in your heart to speak things into creation and out of creation amen glory hallelujah our lord is good so back to the land of er beulah now when the lord calls you as his own he decorates you he put crowns and died him and what does he want to break away diadem diadem is a crown you know different cultures use uh different jewels gold diamonds rubies different jewels for different purposes now a diadem is a crown it's a cloth headband sometimes adorned with jewels and in the olden days it was worn by monarchs in asia minor and other part of the east to signify royalty dignity and authority another translation said that the diadem is a head piece symbolizing royalty and authority and is worn by kings and queens it's a crown and if you go into the bible the lord ordained when you're doing moses to ask moses to ordain his brother aaron as a priesthood they had their crowns and diadems and bells jewels that rings to signify authority that when you hear the bells of uh aaron's clothes the priest the priesthood rope when you see those crowns and bells ringing it it means the lord is alive god is still in manifestation shaking our glory is still here and you can read it from ezekiel 28 and leviticus eight to nine we can't we don't have time to read the bible now i want to move it i want us to move to a jewish alphabet so brother what are you talking about are you going to teach us hebrew i don't even know hebrew myself we are not going to do hebrew lessons i met a i was doing in 10 hours at a cvs on target and a lady came to the pharmacy she was looking for i think the daughter had a a little surgical procedure she was looking for and deceptive soap to wash to disinfect the police so nobody was helping her people would go to this aisle go here and i step out of the pharmacy to go and help her get the item so i begin talking to her and she said i'm actually from israel i'm sorry i don't know anything about these places so i don't know their shop what to find that's no problem let's go so i got it for her and we started talking i could see a spread of the lord in her addressing and everything about her it's just like a saint of christ so i said i wish i can bless you with a hebrew word but i don't know any i don't know i don't know hebrew but i know one hebrew it and she said shalom yes thank you that's it you got it shalom peace of god to you so i'm not going to teach you hebrew but i want us to god is found everywhere you can see god in in nature in the trees you can see god in buildings you can see garden people you can see god in animals you can see them in the waters you can see them in the in the zodiac because the first bible the lord created or the lord wrote wasn't the paper bible that we read he wrote in the atmosphere in the skies in the in the firmament he wrote the first bible was the sun and everything come came from the sun all the creation the sun was the first spoken word of god which types the logos the son of god god himself moved himself from the seventh dimension to the sixth dimension which is christ it doesn't mean he spoke something something separate if you go to the greek word kinos kenos means god translating himself it's not like you bringing for your child but a solomon and his son yes they are the same thing he's gone by the solomon but he's got he's got his own personality but then christ and elohim is the self-same person he just translated himself from one attribute of all existence into an attribute of of a human because he wanted to become a human so he created the first image the first part of him was the lugas the theophany the word body and that is what you have that is the eternal part of you the word body is the true you amen when this earthly person is dissolved there's a weird body in you which is a tenor which was here before us was born which was here before texas was spoken into existence which was said before alaska came into creation and that is the red body so he moves himself to the word body which is the theophany the logos because he wanted to become more like a human he doesn't want to be self-existence in the theophanic that uh dimension so he moved himself in the logos form and begin to manifest in the logos form and then gradually he moved himself into becoming a human becoming a melchizedek becoming jesus christ becoming brother solomon becoming sister naomi becoming sister sarah becoming such a car becoming all my sisters and brothers here because you are christ amen you are not different from christ you are christ but you are modern day christ amen you don't have to wear eastern garment like like jesus of nazareth you can wear tie you can wear dress but as long as you've got the holy ghost in you you are christ in manifestation amen so the lord wanted to the hebrew alphabet have got crowns and each alphabet has got a certain authority that they they denote they kind of predict that authority now there are seven uh letters that have got very powerful significant diadems or crowns and each letter has as a kind of energy that they operate or frequency so the crack the letters a they call it alif alif signif signifies the unity the oneness of christ god is one the unity of the spirit god is not true that's why a true jew a true hebrew even if he doesn't know nothing about this and he doesn't believe there's two guys they are trinity they are three guys no the father the son the spirit is the self-same god but he manifests himself as a father as a son and as a holy spirit it's not three guys who agree in what no it's not about a josue but a solomon a tsunami agreeing to go to restaurant after church whether they want to go to what's your favorite restaurant where do you want to go burger king wrestling where who they have to go papa pappas okay salami where do you want to go she's not decided yet so you're going to have a problem here you want to go to a burger king papa because that is not decided yet it's not that type of unity it is one person now but someone cannot change to become better josue but jose cannot become a salomon but now christ is eternal and he can be in the form of melchizedek and he can change to become jesus christ because he's the son of god who lives in heaven and he lives on earth he can be here and he can be in india he can be here and he can be in africa my flesh cannot be here and be in africa no but christ the eternal being can be here and being everywhere he wants to be because he's a tenor amen glory hallelujah to the lord amen so the letter is let me just read a little bit from here praise god hallelujah glory to the lord let's read from ephesians chapter four one to six paul's talking about the unity of the of of the spirit verse one said i therefore the prisoner of the lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you are called with all lowliness and meekness and with long suffering for bearing one and another in love that's that's the caption love uh endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the band of peace so where there's love the spirit is there there's going to be what peace there's one body that's for one body one spirit even as you are called in one hope of your calling one lord one faith one baptism one god and father of all who is above all and through all and in you all so that is the the first letter of the jewish alphabet signified alphabet is the oneness of the spirit amen there's not two girls that's why the lord gave moses the commandment what's the first commandment o israel the lord thy god is one obula land the lord thy god is one oh wife of the wife of christ the lord i got this one oh bride of christ the lord i got this one oh queen of heaven the lord thy god is one in other words you've got one husband lord means savior and husband amen a woman cannot have two husbands you go and stay with this husband and you go and you cook for this husband and you cook for no you cook and split it for two husbands it doesn't work that way you have only one husband amen now so the hebrew letters are they are just like ordinary letters but then each letter is a symbol and they have inner meaning beside the letters that you see they have an inner meaning so the first letter is called alif that is the first letter of the air of the hebrew hebrew alphabet and alif indicates or signifies the oneness and the unity of the creator it gives it goes beyond the duality of man's translation man want to have polytheism want to worship this and worship that and worship this but there's only one god amen now a leaf and represent creation of something from nothing that's was one minute a leaf a representing creed creating something from nothing who can do that elohim he's the only one who can create something out of nothing amen he's timeless speechless and he's present everywhere he doesn't have any time limitation on him you can't contain him in the space he's beyond your container he can do all things he's beyond perfection he's beyond human understanding and that is i like the oneness of the world now let's look at creation let's look at let's use medicine to break things here doctors sometimes when they go to medical school or those who study biology anatomy they give them animal samples like a rabbit guinea pig frog and dissect them they give you one rabbit and then you dissect the rabbit cut open the open the intestines the the gut and then you cut the head you if you want to learn about the nerves or the the brain or whatever sometimes they give you chemicals to see how these animals will respond before drugs are manufactured or before they they are given to human beings they have to go through trials they use animals to try to see the effect on the animals and then they kind of project see that okay if this uh medication cause abortion in the in the animal it can cause abortion in in human remembering when it is can lose the fetus so they use those trials so they set the animal look at the study the brain all the parts the neurons the nerves they look at them give them names many of them even when you study the human head right things about the head can blow your mind you have thousands of things in the brain nests doctors and those who study medicine they've got they have to dissect them and turn in the nitty-gritty of every part of their brain what they do but then it's only one person if you come to the stomach of course still the hands the nerves the veins the arteries there are many of them but they belong to one person there's no thousand thousand persons it's one rabbit it's got many parts it's got a foot it's got hands and the head and yes but it's one rabbit so the same thing the lord has got many forms of manifestation but it's only one lord one christ one holy ghost amen so there's only one form of eternal life there was only one book of life the at the la the lamb's book of life is the true book of life now the the book of life the earthly life is just a shadow to represent god on earth so that god can manifest in just like brotherhood i can see by the ghost way and the shade is wearing i can see him in the image of the but it's not too red ah sui if you want to look at it you can look at his shirt as one separate being and himself as another separate being but it's one person so the lord is not different from jesus christ jesus christ christ elohim jehovah is the self same person oh israel the lord that god is one that is only one god now the hebrew second word in hebrew means beth betha beth means it's a house god want to manifest just like god wants to manifest himself in more attributes he couldn't just remain elohim all of us were in him in a celestial world but he wanted to also be earthly person so the lord created a being called melchizedek called adam called brother solomon called by the caliph called sister lois to live in those earth to manifest himself so god is duplicating himself so one person but he's got the power of duality amen he's got the power to multiply himself it's just like 1 times one times one times one times one is what one that is what god the lord does so we are one it doesn't matter you're feminine we have got the same spirit that's why when you see your brother why are we gathered together is it because all of us like a certain type of food or we go for motorbiking people are doing motorbiking at this time because they belong to that club there's something that put them together unite them together they all love motorbikes they put on their bandera and you know go have fun wear their jeans and cowboy and whatever what have you gonna have barbecue go and have fun somewhere you know do motorbiking with your wives and girlfriends and different things something bind them together some people are talking about business as we are sitting here starting business and talking about how to create jobs how to take over the vaccine how to invest in vaccine because this vaccine is going to be a big investment how to buy stocks there's something that bind them together money they are trying to make money they've all got the same mind their mind of money so they are making uh business maneuvers to get the best out of money companies are doing different things as we are here different companies are trying to see how best they can drain from the coronal situation because their mind is what money so what binds you and i we are here together it's not because we like certain food or we wear certain type of clothes or we are from the same place it's because of what one spirit one baptism one christ one calling one holy ghost baptism that is why what that is what binds us together as a body of christ amen and that spirit is the supernatural spirit it's got a power beyond everything that you can think about the lord is not limited the holy spirit is not limited it's not limited to yesterday's situation the lord did this yesterday but this situation is so it's just like it's pinning my head around the same lord who did what he did yesterday is the same lord who is doing this for you today only you have to put your trust in him you have to believe him in you amen so jesus taught his disciples to believe him in them he said they came to ask him lord where is the kingdom of god some say the kingdom of god is in the west it's in the east it's in this church it's in this assembly is in this congregation saying no no no no the kingdom of god is in you and your prophet with abraham said that whatever you need for your earthly journey whatever you ever need if you need a jet flight if you need a rocket to fly to the moon i was in houston i think uh 2012 they were talking about going to mass i think mass the year 2035 and i said this for a professor and they were kids said some of you be going to mass now man is thinking about going to mass if man want to go to mass then there should be something in mind to produce what it takes to go to mass that's a man who is falling i'm not talking about man who's got the holy ghost in him this is an earthly man who's using his intellectual regardless of his fallen estate he's still a son of god a daughter of god and he can create a machine a capsule that can move him from earth he's already gone to the moon now he's thinking about going toward going to mass if a a falling son of god is thinking about going to mass how about you how about you standing upright what are you doing amen what's your objective you can't believe god for simple things man is thinking about going to mass and i believe they'll do it right how about you and i you should be able to speak things into creation it shouldn't be something unusual in your life when it becomes necessary you speak it when it's needful in your life you speak it when you come to a situation that you can't move forward anymore then you have to go with a spoken word there was a time in jesus christ life was preaching the gospel the devil annoying people to persecute him they wanted to literally kill him and that was their purpose but it wasn't time yet right so you'll be preaching and tell them that before you destroy he said look at this temple before salam before abraham was i am before abraham you were right josue before abraham lincoln was here you were here how come so they gathered like biggest stone they wanted to and you just like passed through them what do you think they passed through them or you went under the puppet and hide and went to the chair oh don't tell me please but please don't stone me no that wasn't that he knew who he was that he was the son of god that christ is in him so he goes inward to look at the christ in him and that is where his faith is the christ in him and his body breaking into the gases into the atoms they couldn't see him no more he wasn't in here he breaks it into the atoms and he appeared in okeechobee preaching their word in okeechobee that spoken word was in jesus christ and that spoken word is in you brother salomon he's seen is your sister mary seeing you uh sister elise is in all of us brother brother all of you brothers and sisters is in every one of us they seem not a different spoken word not the last one but the same spoken word that was able to bring jesus flesh into the atoms and put them back together by the same spoken word it's in you my sisters and whatever you need is as a daughter of god you don't have to be the pastor you don't have to be the high priest you don't have to be the prophet you don't have to be you have to be a son or a daughter of god and whatever is in your heart you speaking from your heart and the creative forces that was in your father jesus christ the same critic forces in you and it will bring your need into manifestation that's what the lord has put you here for speak the word that's what your problem is for the problem that is troubling you that is on your head you go to bed that problem is there whatever it is there's something in you that the lord is bringing out of you trying to help you to see he's waving it at you look at his son look at the daughter speaking you are my daughter i mean you just just do it just let it come from you just yield yourself to it it's not beyond you i won't give you more than you can handle i'll give you more than you can take i ordain you for this calling and you are the only one who can stand lord why why me lord why me why me why this trouble oh lord why not brother who sway why me brother who's really stronger he can take care why me why not brother solomon no the lord said you you are the one to do it why not brother jack he's the pastor he's anointed he's ordained why not why not him why me you are the one to take it amen and he has to equip you to do it and you have to stand up to the occasion that i'm a spoken word daughter of christ i'm not just an army but i'm christ in manifestation you don't have to be a man no jesus christ wasn't it wasn't a giant samson wasn't a giant no he was an ordinary person but his anointing the christ the word the unity of christ the eternal life in him that means samson who samson samson amen that made jesus christ so jesus christ could break his body into the atoms and appear again yeah so jesus could do it but i'm not jesus what about is this steven one of them somebody did it philip or sleeping one of them which of them philip yes when it was needful philip was baptized he went to baptize and ethiopian enoch and he needed to go to azertos to preach those times they go by horses do they have jet planes did they have vehicles the horsepower they have is like horsepower as in horsepower not in a sports car no no no ship no no no jet flight they just go by horses and chariot that's the best you could get so to go to azeroth seven miles i mean i don't remember the miles but far away so the holy ghost and said no lord i need to go preach and here i am i need to go to no miami is too close uh let's see uh orlando about five hours ride i need to go to london to preach before i can walk in horses to be already the next day i need to be in orlando and as he spoke his atoms broke into the gases and he appeared in orlando azatus and goodies he started greeting the saint shalom god bless you brothers and begin to pray the gospel to them it's nothing strange if they did it under the old testament in the old testament the same holy ghost is here amen the lord is all singing one time israel i think one of the nations they had trouble with israel i think it's one of them i don't remember and whenever they plan to go and i mean kill the king of the jew to go and attack the jews they happy that the jew the king of israel hears the plan of um a forgotten nation syria and so he was the king was troubled who among you is a spy today today today is right today jewish people he said no king nobody says fire none of your subject is inspired as pie what happens is what is we plan and speak in our bed chamber there's a prophet and that prophet the almighty lives in him the one beyond amoya lives in him and what you speak in your secret chamber he'll be there watching you when you are speaking go back to israel he's not there physically but it's a dimensional being so his dimension the christ in him we hear what you are planning okay we're going to we're going to ambush them in ogotobi this is the way they do okay this is the way you you are captain do this you are going to do this when they are coming you go this right go to the left you're going to have hundred people here stationed here 200 here you'll be able to kill the 100 people you are the next force to attack and now elijah elijah honor another prophet come and tell the king of israel hey you are in trouble syria is planning against you they want to kill you and they dismantle their plan why elohim was in elijah and elijah so what they planned elohim reveal it to elijah or elijah whoever was it and then he still the king of israel but greater than greater than elisha is here greater than elijah is here greater than solomon is here greater than david is here the lord jesus christ himself is in your flesh greater than william abraham is here amen people cannot go beyond people think the lord jesus christ died when will abram died the prophet like the bible said prophet god unto the people yes i know families that were broken when babraham died it's like god has died right on on the universe people used to go to the to the graveyard especially was going to arise because they saw a man who's speaking to creation a man when something you've got something missing he can tell you that oh your wallet is here your horses are here he can tell you things that you don't know he can tell you things from your ancestry this disease is coming from your generation you can tell you that it's coming from your father's side you can tell the secret of your heart so when this man died their hopes were shattered but they didn't know the lord is about to give more just like solomon just like samson samson was attacked by the seven church ages samson had seven locks woven on his head that was the seven church ages but the lord finished with the seven church edges and move into the eighth day in the eight they don't have to have seven logs you don't have to have a you have to have the spoken word in you you have to have the third pool amen the lord was bringing more than the seven church ages and that is the omega age amen so after the seven church ages uh after samson's er seven lots were cut off and the enemy thought oh i've got this guy the black is ice what is an eye seer who's a seer a prophet so when the prophet was taken away from the earth families were shattered ministries were shouted people like we're mourning like almighty is dead there's not god anymore we can't pray to nobody anymore william brahma is not here anymore but the lord jesus christ was still the lord jesus christ and it's like the lord jesus christ amen and the lord jesus christ especially abraham to resurrect they went to the uh he's going to resurrect somewhere go in their families going dead we know you're going to rise you're going to rise and ride the trail we're going to rise and bring build the tent and they went for a year and they keep going and they go to a place no no the man is gone the lord has now finished with him but the lord is looking up to you you are elisha you have to get the mantle of elijah you follow him to get his mantle and when you get a mantle you become him amen so when elijah died elijah actually didn't die it wasn't a flesh elijah it was a man to the anointing and the same anointing came upon elijah so elijah was actually elijah in manifestation amen it's just a different flesh the same only goes in william brahm in elijah the teach bite in john the baptist in jesus of nazareth in mexico appeared to abraham in abraham in sarah in hana in elizabeth in esther the same holy ghost is in you amen and when you believe with all your heart when you surrender to him the same thing can manifest in you amen and the lord has you here at this time this difficult time politically socially economically whatever wise you know society-wise everything seems to be broken this is the time the lord found it purposeful to put you right here on earth so that you can manifest the third pool you can manifest the spoken word you can manifest the a day you can manifest after the seven churches are done you are more than the seven church churches greater than seven churches are here amen greater than the hair of solomon is here no solomon they have to uh no sorry no solomon uh samson they have to play their head no they go to the place they didn't have any head to think about but the eyes were a plaque off now the intelligence himself the intelligence which is what christ himself christ was the one who was using the hair as a symbol it wasn't the herpes but there was an anointing under the head so now christ doesn't want to use symbols no more right no more he's not sending messages anymore he's done with the seven churches messengers by himself he's dealing with his wife directly glory hallelujah and so you don't need to you don't need to have a bishop to pray for the lord to hear your prayer you need to what have christ in you for the lord to hear your prayer you need to have do you need to be anointed by the word you need to be born again number one and when you are born again you keep eating the word eat more than your portions it's something that will that will shake you you hear something in the word of the lord that shakes you i've never seen this before it lifts you up higher and you keep eating it building a weird body and what you eat you become what you eat you are eating the spoken word of god so what do you become spoken word so when you speak what happens you eat a creator so when you when you eat a creature you become what and so when you speak what happens you create amen and that is what the lord is looking for for in us he's not looking for nothing complicated from you he's not asking you to build a firmament if there's a need you can build one amen if you need to move here to russia you can do it amen there'll be a playstation there for you to move to russia if you need to break your atom your body atoms and appear in russia and speak to a sister in russia or a brother in russia the holy ghost in you can do that amen you might not need a jet plane you might not need putin's permission you might be in russia to preach the word and take your body back and come back to the u.s putin will not even know about it that is what the lord has made you to be amen we don't have we don't need the economy of u.s i'm not saying that if economic goes we want the economy to be good but whether the economy is bad or good you are not depending upon the economy how they balance the economy how they think oh you're going to have a recession no you live beyond recession you live beyond coronavirus you live beyond infection because he that is in you is greater than the coronavirus here that is in you is greater than the bad economy he that is in you is greater than the joblessness in the society now he that is in you is greater than the food stamps you have got the creative force of christ in you and you stand as a daughter of god and as the son of god and you speak and move forward you can't go back no the back is sealed the lord wants you to move forward in your faith whatever you need is in you your family your loved ones it's in your heart why do you test why do you have the desire to for you want to see your loved ones saved because they are saved already you won't have desire for the microphone to be saved whose printer looks save this microphone microphone doesn't need eternal life you use it we pray that they function well for us but we don't pray for microphone to have it in our life no we use them they already have the life they need to manifest their purpose but you have loved ones people in your life that you can't shake them off no matter how they treat you you still love them you still contain them here no matter how they despise you how they mock you they walk off the way they're still here there's something in them in you and in them that'll bring them back take your loved one let them go as far as they can go let me say natural example let's say your child doesn't want to serve the lord he doesn't want to hear about jesus christ so you take off his name off i don't want to be called uh whatever name it is moralist or whatever it's it's gone i don't know i'm not i don't belong to that morality family i'm gone you go to peru so i'm a peruvian i'm not from the us you're going to study learn spanish and live in peru but your heart is still calling for your son your daughter is way off is now in south america he's not even in the u.s for you you don't even have you don't know where he is you know he's in peru but you don't have any line to talk to him you don't have email there's not even any connection but your son your daughter your grandchild your father your mother your wife your husband your friend your auntie he lives in your heart you can't take him off why can't you take him off the dna is still there though it doesn't go by the family name anymore the life in the family is still in him so he got sick he gets sick he can be doing cocaine doing whatever it is he's got money he doesn't he doesn't even speak english anymore but one time you get sick and they try to give him blood they do this it doesn't work and they found out his dna is different where are you from he said i'm from the united states you are from the u.s oh really and we have to send you back home because you're gonna die and you've been praying for your son you are crying lord i want to see my daughter i want to see my son here he's in peru i don't even know where he is i don't know what he's doing and one day you hear knock your son is back home he's coming back son daughter is that you say yes in tears i'm sorry for all that i've done i'm still your son i want the name back because why the end of the life he never got lost he got lost in earthly dimension but the life was still in him even in his lost estate he know he's what a son of god he knows he belongs to their family so regardless about your faith your prayers your creative spirit don't look at situation remember i told you jesus christ wasn't a situational christian he was all-time christian he just doesn't act when when else he was everyday christ his faith didn't waver and when you've got a new breath your faith shouldn't waver you should always see that when a situation arise just look beyond the situation come to your heart that's what the lord did when they were going to arrest him they wanted to kill him it wasn't time yet he just disappears nothing he just he's just disappeared appeared in somewhere else where you see they've got their rocks the way see where's joseph where is he he's gone how did he go they didn't run away no they could have overtaken him but the creative spirit in him manifested sometimes he would say a word destroy this temple of solomon i'll raise it in three days oh my they couldn't take it you're gonna destroy the solomon's temple that was 40 years in burden and raise it in three days now you're a demon you don't don't you don't just have a demon you're a demon you're abusive you are the devil himself destroying the whole nation who can take this word and they wanted to put an end they were jet they were i mean they were sincere about it because in their mind they thought is the demon how can you destroy this building this mansion and build in three days how what he's talking about was his temple he's talking about eternal waste and the same western you and he could break his body and disappear and appear the same force the same spirit is in you greater than solomon you are builder land a land that has been fertilized with a word the lord himself has stepped on your land elohim is your husband elohim is your lord you are message jesus christ the queen of heaven who lives insisting element don't be confined to assisting your existing element the z element can break down you should be marching on destroy this sister element break it down what you call quicku i will see be singing glory hallelujah in the other dimension i'm a tenor i can't die you cannot die death so white people are dying they are not dead they are walking in the other dimension and we have to go beyond things that we see with these two eyes these two eyes are actually blindness this is a shadow and if you go beyond that then the intelligence in you just like solemn something something wasn't looking at his situation he noticed his eyes were gone the heads were off but there's something in him it was an eagle so when the enemies were rejoicing having their party drinking wine and whiskey and boozing around and you know crafting and puffing on you know because it was a big big fiesta big party for them the enemy that troubled them killed thousands and probably millions of them now they've got this enemy and they are mocking him but you remember he was an ego he began to go back inward internalize things he said i don't want to leave no more lord he was talking to the pillar firing him my work is done i want to go home but i want to destroy i want to kill the enemies i mean killed all of these people prevent them from my eyes that they plucked out of my out of the socket and the elohim the pillow fire me begin to boil like boiling a soup begin to boil begin to boil and begin to speak into his heart put his hand on one one one pillar to the little boy that go the little boy had a seat go away just go was counting was in his mind counting make sure maybe an hour make sure that the boy calling him hey jew are you there you are you there give extra time to make sure the word was gone because you wanted to spread that boy's life the rest of them you want to revenge and you put one one one one one arm on the other other pillar how can you you it's a human being he wasn't like a giant how can he put one arm on two pillars how far how far apart were the pillars it wasn't his hand it was a pill of fire in him and the pillow fire began to match he said samson i'm going to revenge for you don't worry son you are coming home i'm bringing you home and the pillow fire came around the whole building with mighty pillars how's it going to break these two pillars but the pill of fire did it the whole building collapsed and the bible said that he killed more people than all the people he killed in his life why he was a son of god he was an ego and you are an ego one timely abraham i'm close and i won't take too much of your time william brown went to the woos and he's he saw an ego there was a storm he was looking at this eggo and he had he had a gun with him said look they said he was looking at him said do you know i can shoot you he pointed again at the ego the ego didn't shake he wasn't bothering he said you know i can shoot you i can kill you take your life the girl was watching about abraham and he was watching him he said he was as brave as anything and then she said why you know i can kill you i can just shoot you there girl was looking at him if i i could dramatize him you're just kidding me you can shoot me i can see before you throw your gun i'm off i've got a i can flop my wings and i'll just swerve your your your bullets because he was an eggo he comes go at a velocity beyond what you can imagine certain echoes about is what their wings about 14 what 14 inches or whatever forgotten they are so far wide apart and they are so strong they can take a sheep and take them to the sky to the mountains there's the creative force the eagle nature is in them and they're as brave as anything just like a lion and the same spirit is in you even the bread is a type of you the spirit of christ in you and that creative power that authority the spoken word it's in you and whatever you desire the girl wasn't scared like oh william is going to kill me no you look at him so you are just kidding you can't kill me i'm an ego i was born to fly and i can fly the deep blue skies no way i'm the master of the of the skies of the atmosphere i can just tilt myself and it's bram said there was says tom coming and he saw the eagle has got little ones and he said why what this igor wasn't afraid of the storm so he said he already commanded the children that when his ghettos now pick you up so when the storm was like so so bad it got so bad he just came down put all the little egglets on his wing and took at a velocity in the atmosphere move away you've got the master ego the lord jesus christ if you think situation is out of hand you can't control you just come and just pick you up from the situation because it's you he's don't look at him from the natural skies no it's in your heart and when the flesh cannot take off himself he'll put his flesh together and put him where it belongs to in safety amen when you are sick and you can wake up from your bed i want to go to church sunday but i'm sick i can't wake up the holy ghost in you put you together before realize oh you taking shower i'm going to church wow what happened oh i'm feeling

trial had already begun i lost my car and everything and i bought a 300 car a station wagon imagine me in a station way i called it big dusty and one night um i was working at a tour bus company i was a maintenance manager i went with the owner down in orlando and that night about one o'clock i was driving home on i-85 and i was singing a little song bueller land and i was just you know just broken up because my trial had begun and as i was singing that song it was pouring down raining and i didn't know that there was a diesel fuel spill in the middle of the road and as i was driving i was singing the song of beulah land and then all of a sudden my car started spinning and i was singing bueller land i went up and hit a bank still singing beulah land i started spinning back going straight back towards the other side of the road and i was just still singing beulah and i looked to my left and i saw lights there was 18 wheeler coming directly at me i was still singing a song the 18 wheeler hit me crushed the car and i went back up against the bank and i was still singing bueller and by the time the car stopped i was singing bueller and i stopped did that truck hit me so i got up and i ran up to the truck to see if they were okay i was thinking i wasn't afraid at all of what was going on it was like the presence of the lord came and that gave me such a peace during that time that there was no fear at all and i got hit by 18 wheeler i mean it came and hit here totally crushed that car and so much when my pastor and his wife came to my house after they told her that she looked at the car and she cried like a baby because i should have been dead but i didn't have one skull just singing a little song it was one of those songs that i don't think i ever sung it in church before i was singing it at that time because i was just learning it because of the different trials that i want i would like to try and sing that right now do you have the words for that i
