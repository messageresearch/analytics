Amen Happy New Year to those that I didn't get a chance to say it to but amen we thank God uh for just one more year amen one more year closer to the coming of the Lord [Applause] amen um often times when we start the new year I just try to seek the mind of God for what he would have for us amen uh this year and last year just waiting on the Lord he was giving us a little thought on yielding uh to the perfect will of God and um uh we started out um with that theme amen and um this year just been feeling uh just a little thought in my spirit uh I will restore sayeth the Lord thank you Lord amen I will restore sayeth the Lord amen and so uh at the beginning of the year I will have a few sermons that will be uh around this theme and um this is somewhat of my inspiration we will use a different title uh today for our sermon but I do want to read a couple scriptures if I actually stand with me uh our title today will be get back in Step amen and get back in step and um I want to read from Joel chapter 1 and Joel chapter two since we're taking this inspiration of our will restore sayeth the Lord um oh my had the wrong scripture there um let me just get this really quick uh Joel 1 and two it says this in Joel 1 verse4 it says that which the Palmer worm hath left hath the Locust eaten and that which the Locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpillar eaten uh go to chapter two and uh we'll start at verse 23 in chapter two uh it says be glad then the children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for Heath given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you uh the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month Lord let that be amen and the floors shall be full of Wheat and and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil and I will restore to you now this has become that's right it's personal you got to you got to act like God talking directly to you speaking to your situation speaking to your circumstance your neighbor may not be going through what you're going through but this is for you right and this is what it says it says I will restore to you the years that the Locust hath eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you now there's so much in this and we ain't going to be able to get to it all today now the the Locust the caterpillar uh the the canker worm they were sent by God to do a very specific thing hello somebody but in the midst of being sent by God it allows God to fulfill another promise I will restore and then he says in verse 26 ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that have dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and that I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed repeated it twice now it says and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out of my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids uh in in those days will I pour out my spirit and I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth blood and fire and pillars of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and terrible day of the Lord come and it shall come to pass pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be Deliverance as the Lord have said and in the remnant whom the Lord shall call let's just have a word of prayer amen over this father we thank you for the word of God as it has been read but Lord we must be able to apply what we read to where we are so God I pray that the Holy Ghost would come and make the word live uh for uh for for us we we these promises were not just to Israel but lord they're they're to your beloved and we are your beloved as well so father we ask that you would speak uh to every heart those that are present those that are online May the spirit of God take control over this thought God as it's been presented to the people it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you you can be seated again our uh subject amen today is get back in Step amen get back and step but to uh get us going amen uh in this I want to pick a quote out of the restoration of the brid tree and uh we will just kind of start from there uh um brother brandham as he preached a sermon restoration from the bride tree what we're going to find here is that he got his inspiration from a sermon that brother Neville had preached the morning before this was a Easter uh uh message that he preached but brother brother uh brother Neville had preached early that morning and at the end of his sermon he was making comments about restoration and brother brother Brandon went took that and uh and just kind of formed a sermon around it and preached the restoration of the Bri tree a three-hour sermon came from a note that got from Brother Neville amen it shows how he got inspiration from other people praise the Lord amen and he wasn't afraid to tell I got the inspiration from this other this other brother you know but but God gave him just a little bit more and as we as we get deeper in this we'll see some things but but here he uh he makes these statement says now after brother Neville preached this morning that notable message at the at the last thing he said on his last thoughts was to be restored to be restored and so that give me the idea right there to restore now I rushed home and got my dictionary and so forth and some scripture notes and begin to copy some things down and then I got Webster's Dictionary to find out uh find out the right definition for ReStore to restore means to return to the former owner blessed be the name of the Lord amen or to bring back uh to the former estate of condition amen this is what restoration when we take this inspiration we're looking for God to return some things to the former owner amen we're looking for things to return to their first state or condition their former state that something's got to come back ah hallelujah amen something's got to come back here he says and and we can and I like this and we can enforce a claim to be restored amen now that's what Webster says the word restore means to bring back to the former o owner or to bring back to a former state of condition and if a claim is made on something to make that restoration you can enforce it I like this to make it come back to its right place and may God bless these people wordss now he said you can enforce it so you know there there's things that uh that we'll be talking about amen over the next couple weeks how does this enforcement happen amen uh but I don't want to get ahead of myself so let me just keep reading it says to restore means to bring back or to restore a claim can be enforced now to bring anything back to its rightful owner where it belongs therefore some way it went away from amen it's rightful owner somehow the devil got involved and moved that thing away from its rightful owner I moved it out of its rightful position but God made a promise it's not my promise it's not your promise you didn't you didn't you didn't say these words God is the one that said these words and in God saying it we can expect God to fulfill what he said and I'm I'm here to tell you you don't have to feel it amen you ain't even got to believe it if you don't want to but God going to do it anyhow because he said it and he cannot lie Hallelujah he says somewhere went away from his rightful owner and and and and can wander around anywhere look at this now amen it says but to restore is to bring it back to who really owns it or to bring it back to its natural estate where it was at the first time bring it back into its natural condition and in order to do this we have a right to enforce if there's a law to enforce this rightful condition of restoration to restore I like it I like what the prophet is saying I I I'm I'm I'm going to enjoy this journey hallelujah look at this now he goes on to say this he says like if some somebody stole some property and they're holding the property captive ain't your children your property and there's a devil holding them captive then you can take the law oh my God and go to this person and the law enforces this person to restore this property back to his natural owner into his a prior our first estate enforcement oh what a text he says how I like to have two days on that enforce he says now brother brother never preach for us I'm just just going to talk to you teach a Sunday school lesson so I get uh I get to continue on I hope with what he had and I just like how the prophet did that he he he he picked up on the inspiration that brother Neville had and he just kind of carried it Forward Hallelujah and I'm gonna I'm going to set some things and I'm going challenge amen the ministers to try to catch this inspiration and Carry It Forward glory to God Amen as we just start out the year let's let's catch this inspiration of what the holy spirit is doing and let's kind of Bring It forth I I believe as we all enter into this channel God got something for us look at this now look at what he says he says inforce then we are we have the privilege to enforce upon Satan the claims that God give us he says for God he says for God has a law and his word is a law and God in this word made certain claims Amen to the church therefore we have a right to force these claims upon Satan and say oh my now now here's the thing here's the thing you just can't be quiet uh and expect the devil to give up you going to have to open up your mouth and you going to have to say something things and and when you speak it out of your mouth oh you got to understand there's a promise that already looms that God said he will restore but God wants you to be a part of the promise tell that devil give it back hey Hallelujah you done had it long enough now it's time for you to give it back praise God church amen amen the prophet tells us this now he says we have a right to force these claims upon Satan and say give it back and look at this he has to do it because we can take God's agent the Holy Spirit go right down on our knees and say it's thus sayth the Lord what's thus sayith the Lord the part that thus sayith the Lord is I will re restore Hallelujah he say not going to let you be made ashamed I will restore right said it's thus said Lord he's got to give it up that's all cuz the holy spirit's there to make him do it all you got to do is really it release it out of your mouth the Holy Ghost take care of the rest I like this and you know I had a little a little thing amen uh another little thought and I don't and maybe we'll we'll preach it or maybe not I can just kind of inject it right here I believe that we've been in defense mode long [Applause] enough give me one second here I I I just believe it's we've been we've been on defense long enough we don't we don't need to be on defense no more thank you all right I got what I need I got what I need praise the Lord amen uh you know when you when you're in defense and and any of y'all that know anything about sports you know I played when I was younger played played uh uh football played basketball and and you know you follow different favorite teams and things of that nature and um you know when you in defense you trying to stop somebody from making an advancement you trying you just you know you're always trying to block and trying to guard and trying to tackle trying I mean you just you chasing everything in defense Hallelujah you just trying to get one play where you stopped them Hallelujah just just one play but you know I mean lately there was a game and they got all the way down to I want to say about the five yard line and uh the defense was on there and and they they backed up against the goal line and and they got one play fourth down play in order to stop this team in order to win that game and and often times when you're defense mode everybody don't feel so so come you don't know what they going to throw at you and and you just got to try to be in the right position to stop whatever it is that they throw at you Hallelujah and and you just defending this and you're defending that and you're defending this and you're defending that but brother I'm tired of being on defense sister I'm ready to go on the offense and in the office they don't know what I'm about to do I might run it I might throw it you don't know where I'mma pass through you don't know what's getting ready to happen I put the devil in suspense I'm not the one going to be in suspense but the devil is in suspense because I am on offense and we done took everything the devil had to throw at us defending this and defending that no we going to offense and we going to open our mouth in 2024 Satan give it back woo Hallelujah I'm confident that on offense we going to score some points we going to win the game on offense Hallelujah some teams feel like if I can just get my quarterback the ball in his hands if I can get the running back the ball in his hands if I can just get get the ball in Michael Jordan hands on LeBron James hands if I can just get the ball in I know we going to win this thing that's when you got confidence on offense it's time for us to move from this defensive position to being on offense amen amen in soccer If Messi get the ball man P I know you dribbling and you just get the ball in the hands we down we just need to score one go get it to him let him get an open field I guarantee that man will score that we we there's something about being on offense there's a different feeling amen that that comes into the air when the team is on offense and they driving for the winning score hallelujah it's another feeling when you're on defense you you just kind of wait to see what's going to happen but when you on offense you got a an assurance you got a conf confidence you know something good is about to happen something good is on the way Hallelujah I'm moving I'm switching positions this morning I'm going on offense if the prophet said that the we can enforce the claim and the devil have to give it back let's enforce our claims this year not just sit back and just take whatever the devil doing no it's time to go on offense I'mma open my mouth and speak to this situation GL amen amen amen the prophet goes on to say the law of the land is to enforce it's by the land for the land but the law of the spirit of God is to force Satan I like that the law of the spirit of God is to force Satan to give up that which he has unrightfully right [Music] deceitfully believe the sign went to don't believe the sign and they did it deceitfully people got wrapped up in that spirit and didn't realize it was a spirit behind the whole thing Hallelujah but but the law of the spirit of God amen I believe it's here to force Satan I'm saying it at the beginning of the year I believe the law of the spirit of God is here to force Satan to give it back unrightfully Wicked devil deceitfully taken from God Souls of men he took from God Souls of women children if if you've been sick in your body he took your sickness away that was not God's original position for you to be sick amen God's original position for you to be well amen it is his will that your soul prosper and be in good health even as your soul Prosper it is God's will for your body to be well the devil is a liar [Music] [Applause] hey I'm telling you the devil is a liar we going to go in office and we're going to take back what the devil stole from us that's what restoration is all [Applause] about souls of men he took from God Souls of women children sickness of the body he placed upon people where God Made Them In His Image to be like him and the church look at this now the church is given the rightful legal rights by the Bible to take the Holy Spirit and and force them upon and force this upon them you got to know who you are in Christ Amen brother brandom talked about the the little policeman that man that man ain't strong enough to stop no car coming Full Speed Ahead the man cannot the man can't stop a car if you got out there and and even a 18wheeler trying to stop 18wheeler and and just just standing out there no no no no no no my brother you you lose your life it says but if he throw them hands up my God and they see that badge you see that 18 Willer just everything just come to a Hal everybody I just just stop just like that and it's it's time to throw your hands up make the devil come to a halt throw your hands up go down on your knees and watch God enforce these claims upon the Devil make him give it back come on let's go on the office church this year hey we tired of watching and seeing what the devil it's time for us to do something it's time for you to call to play praise God it's time for you to [Applause] [Music] execute oh yes hallelujah hallelujah here you know I'm looking at this year and there's there's there's there's there's so much that I I believe we can be in expectation for as I Was preparing amen for uh uh you know just this first sermon of the year I thought about how brother Billy Paul was taken home amen October 23rd he was buried on October 23rd I'm he passed away before that but he was buried on that day uh and and a lot of people begin to wonderer at the passing uh since he was told by his daddy that sharks would be swimming where he was standing and this was after brother brandham had preached a a powerful sermon amen um choosing of a bride and there so much happened in that one ser sermon Lord knows I I feel like I'm not going to get through this sermon today but but there's so much happening in that one sermon you know all we get is the recording of the prophet and his sermon which that's that's really all we need but there were so many things happened before that one of the things that happened is brother Brandon Met prophesied to a sister um uh shakarian Florence sharan I think is her name he say hey thus said the Lord you're going to die sis God showed me that he going to take you off the scene you're going to die so you need to get your house in order now now most people don't want to hear prophecy like that but if God tell you that all you got to do is get your house in order and get ready to go that's right amen so she he told the sister say you're going to die God showed it to me well he come and and and everybody uh I don't know how everybody heard but many other preachers heard that he told that sister that so before amen the uh the preaching of of Tu of bride they said was a mighty anointing in the church like it was this morning a real strong anointing in the church and it was so strong that amen one of the uh uh famous preachers of that day and and I can't remember his name but he had a big television Ministry and everything he went and prophesied to the lady thus sayith the Lord you are not going to die but you shall live that's what he told the lady now brother brandom said you're going to die and this man just said you going to live brother brandom heard him didn't say anything went out and preach choos of a bride and at the end of the sermon anointed came in Hallelujah and uh when anointed came he prophesied that Los Angeles was going to go under and after after he prophesied this you know he said it's going to be like Capernaum and you know you'll be found in the bottom of the sea and so on and so forth he leaves the service and he's underneath that anointing brother Billy Paul just walking with him and brother Billy Paul begin to say daddy now uh you you heard that tonight right say yeah yes son I heard it uh you know you told me to respect the gifts D said yes I I I want you to respect those gifts son he said now daddy you prophesied that the woman was going to die but this man prophesied tonight that she's going to live but you didn't say anything about it he said yeah that's because God ain't told me nothing different I don't care who come up with what type of Prophecy I don't care who come up with what type of website God ain't told me nothing different right so so so he said God ain't told me nothing different he say now Billy say where you standing he say I'm standing in Los Angeles he says no be more specific it says I'm standing here at the maze uh in front of the maze store in Los Angeles he says sharks going to be swimming where you standing before you become an old man sharks will be swimming before where you standing where everybody been watching brother Billy Paul watching brother Billy Paul watching brother Billy Paul now they say before he become an old man shark's gonna be swimming where he's standing and they watched him turn 70 now what about the prophecy they watched him turn 75 what about the prophecy you know what and is brother bradam a false prophet because look at he told his son this and it didn't happen oh my my my you missed it you missed it amen it happened well before he became an old man that's right I want to say roughly a few years after brother Brandon left to sing they said a man that Paul Harvey was on the radio announcing that in the Maze building there's been an earthquake and a flood and this flood has sharks swimming in the garage of the maze building this was only a few years after brother brandom died now now now now now see the problem is is that they miss the rest of the [Music] [Applause] story and they was waiting for something that already manifested now I'm going tell you something you waiting on a restoration but it's already manifested amen and I'm going Show You by God's grace that by your very fact of sitting here you are already a part of restoration you didn't feel it amen you never you never saw nothing big happen but yet the promise of God was fulfilled in your [Applause] life they completely missed it but a lot of people still had their eyes on it but it gives us opportunity when people start asking questions it gives us opportunity to have some conversations what else could they have missed that God has already done brother Jason Watkins had a a a brother in his church who had a sister that worked in the Maze building and uh and that that that brother say his sister told him they gave her a memo saying don't go in the garage because sharks are swimming in that garage don't go the same place where he told Brother Billy Paul they'll be swimming before you become an old man it happened exactly like like that now what happens is is uh they go to Google and they say but they don't have this reported well why would they report it and I mean you talk about in the 6s this would not be there praise the Lord it really wouldn't be there but but but can you take an eyewitness a brother who had a sister who worked in the building that got a memo now most likely that lady's already gone Hallelujah so I'm not going to be looking for I need to talk to her I need to get her Memo well if you're going to be like that why don't you go back and try to visit with Moses if you going to take the account of what happened in Genesis go back and have an interview with Moses and see what Google has to say about that oh you going have to take some things by faith we were listening to the tape the other night I'm coming I'm coming home brother Brandon made a statement in the tape that we listened to on on on uh on Friday night amen turned northward he says the Revival produces twins yes but one of the twins that comes out of the Revival his approach to the word is intellectual so when you see somebody approaching the scripture intellectually they are twin spirit that comes out but they're looking at the word from the wrong angle you cannot look at this from an intellectual perspective it's going to take faith without faith it's impossible to please God not without your intellect God can blow your intellect out of just out of orbits you you wouldn't know what you what you was thinking about I thought I had it right no God God thoughts are higher in your thoughts and his ways are so much higher than your ways so you got to approach things by faith I just believe I wondered after brother Billy Paul was called home I wondered was it enough to turn the hearts of those who have walked away with it turn them back again and I found that it wasn't enough but I did find another event that would be more than enough to get the job done Amen to turn people's hearts back to the faith amen I found an event in Scripture that is more than enough that'll get the job done and that event is this promise that I'm reading over you I will restore sayth the Lord that's more than enough to get the job done now a a a restoration occurs regardless of the conditions oh brother brandom says it just like that a restoration occurs regardless of the conditions and I want to just inject a scripture here because I believe Paul kind of speaks to this amen and when we look at our own lives and some of the things that we were involved in a restoration has occurred has brought us back to our condition that God saw us at in the beginning amen before the foundation of the world Hallelujah how' you come back to this position it it was the spirit of God that brought you back here now now look look at what Paul says in 1 Corinthians 6 it says this know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God Amen be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolators nor adulterers nor Emin nor abusers of themselves with Mankind and that's that's speaking so much of homosexuality hallelujah amen you ain't going to make it to Heaven living that kind of Lifestyle Hallelujah we might as well just be honest with people God God loves The Sinner but he hates sin and we got to preach against sin amen church right look he says says uh nor feminine nor abuses of themselves with mankind if you don't know what that mean look at up you'll see it deals with homosexuality and it told you that you're not going to inherit the kingdom of God you're not going to do it look now he says this verse 10 nor thieves nor Covetous nor drunkers nor revilers nor extortioners my God my God taking advantage of people and taking their money from them extortioners you not going to get there amen look he say shall inherit the kingdom of God and look at this look at this and such were you used to be this way but after the Holy Ghost got a hold of you something changed amen such were some of you but look at this but ye are watched but ye are Sanctified but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus by the spirit of our God here you had nothing to do with this justification s there's nothing that you could do by yourself God had to do it alone inside of you I like this I said your wickedness could not stop your washing our sinful ways could not stop God from sanctifying us amen my past I want to tell the devil my past is over and I am justified the washing of the blood of Jesus makes it just as if I never sin in the first place a true washing of the blood will cleanse you from all your sins and a true cleansing brings you back into perfect fellowship with God he says I will restore sayith the Lord now this may mean different things to different people it just depends on where you are in life I I want to read a few scriptures Amen to you uh when it when we talk about this restoration Jeremiah Jeremiah 30 and 17 Oh Glory Jeremiah 30:17 says for I will restore Health unto thee see if you're going through this you ought to take a hold of this promise I will restore Health unto thee and I will heal thee of thy wounds now now now now now I want to you know just Camp there just for a little bit sometimes it's not an external wound you know a bruise before it shows on the outside something occurred on the inside hallelujah amen before that bruise could develop something had to happen on the inside before it showed on the outside what this healing of the wounds is that whatever took place on the inside God will bring healing to it God I'll restore Health unto thee and I will heal thee of thy wounds say the Lord because they call thee an outcast saying this is Zion whom no man seeketh after Genesis 40 and13 I want to read about this restoration see uh maybe you lost a job amen we saw this even here in our own church a brother that used to work at a particular organization he went there to another organization end up losing job over there because they was they want to send them all kind of places like no I can't do that Hallelujah came back into the presence of the Lord and then he he he started looking for jobs everywhere but then all of a sudden just suddenly this one job shows up and he really didn't want to go back to that job but it showed up and it disappeared just like that he applied got the job with the race God restored him back to his position and when God restores you back he don't he don't decrease you he increases you I don't know if I got them all here but there's a scripture say because of the things that you went through I restor to you double but here in Genesis 40 and 13 look at this it says and this is this is uh the story of the butler hallelujah amen he lost his position but because he was in the right place Joseph in the right Jail at the right time he had a dream interpreted and here was the interpretation of his dream yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head and restore thee unto thy place oh my if I needed a job I would jump on that God I'm looking for it in three days if the butler got his job in three days what about me yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head and restore thee unto thy place and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's Cup in his hand into his hand after the form of manner when thou was his Butler he's going back to the exact position that he lost oh I I I I just I I pray church that we can we can take a hold of this you go back to the exact position that you lost this is being spoken at many levels here I pray this ain't going over the church's heads we're talking about restoration you're going back to the exact position that you lost and then force is here to make the devil give it [Music] back God Second Kings ate this lady lost land this lady lost her house she lost a lot of things because of a famine that had come into the land but when God changed the situation and famine was gone this lady went to the king and she got everything she lost back now I'm going tell you the famine today is not natural things but the famine is the Famine of the word of God and there many people lost and trapped out that that Satan has unrightful deceitfully taking Souls of men and Souls of women but the Holy Ghost is here to tell the devil we going on the off fense you going to have to give it back 2 Kings chapter 8 ver4 says this and the King talked with gahaz the servant of the man of God saying tell me I pray thee all the great things that Elisha hath done and it came to pass as as he was telling the King how he had restored a dead body to life that behold the woman whose son he had restored to life so this lady had a son raised from the dead Elisha was the one that raised him and as he's telling a testimony the lady walks right into the court of the king and he say hey this the lady I'm telling you who what happened but this is the lady that had happened to she had been away for for for for for years but she happened to walk in in at the right time she came in the right season and when she came in this was an opportunity to get everything restored the king's heart was touched by the testimony this could not have been a more perfect time for this lady to come back from her journey W hallelujah amen amen amen this is the year somebody coming back from their Journey they've been on a long journey but this is a year you come under the right inspiration you come at the right time you come because God said he was going to restore and it came to pass as he was telling the King how he had restored a dead body life that behold the woman whose son he had restored to life cried to the king for her house and for her land my God and gahaz said my Lord oh King this is the woman and this is her son whom Elisha restor to life and and when the king asked the woman she told him so the king appointed see now now I just when when she when when the king asked the woman I can see let I know he telling you his part of the testimony but let you let me tell you my part of the testimony and as as she told it look look at what happened so the king uh and she told him so the king appointed unto her a certain officer saying restore all that was hers and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land and even until now so everything you lost in the Years while you were away we want to give that to you plus you don't lose with God you increase not decrease you get double for your trouble Amen Let me give you two more scriptures here amen turn with me to Psalms 51 M because amen sometimes it's Health sometimes it's land might be business income healing to the Inner Man glory to God but sometimes it's just you and all that you just been going through and maybe you don't feel as close to God as you used to feel hello somebody but God God knows exactly where you are now there were some things that caused David to get into that same condition it was his sin that moved him further away from God but when he got those sins corrected when he repented before God he can write this prayer in the scripture Psalms 51 and: 10 says create in me a clean heart hallelujah oh God and renew a right Spirit within me at the beginning of the year renew a right Spirit Within Me cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy Holy Spirit from me and then it says restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit sometimes all we need is our joy restored we didn't lose our salvation but the joy of Salvation we need God to restore the joy I remember I used to be on fire I couldn't wait for the church doors to open God I need that type of joy to come back into my life again restore the joy Hallelujah here in this last one that I want to read is Genesis 20 and 7 now in this praise God uh when brother brandom you know preaches the sermon restoration of the Bride tree he uh he takes uh uh Joel Joel one and Joel 2 and he also injects Genesis 20 and7 uh in there and and here's the things that I want you to understand about that as we as we get ready to read this uh regardless of the condition regardless of the condition God will do the restoration amen amen yes Sarah Abraham and Sarah put God in a really difficult position through a lie that they both told this man was only doing you know what he thought was right this King was only doing what he thought was right but but because of this lie that Abraham and Sarah told amen it caused this man to take Abraham uh take Sarah because they told him this is my sister now part of that was truth they were half sister and half brother but they they moved from the stage of just being brother and sister to being husband and wife now look at this amen uh when we look at this uh uh God had already told and gave Abraham a promise that Sarah thy wife will have a son Oh Glory to God now aimc could not touch Sarah because had he touched her it would have broke the promise of God so God not not necessarily protecting Abraham and Sarah what God was protecting was his promise and if God has made you a promise God will bankrupt Heavens before that word falls to the ground and return void I will restore sayth the Lord wo I don't know how long it's going to take I don't know what kind of dream he might have to give somebody but God going to move some way Somehow Here in in Genesis 27 says now therefore this is why ailec was sleeping God had a conversation with him restore the man his wife I I'm just going to say it like this I believe aimc represent the devil and I'm going to speak to the devil Satan now therefore restore the man his wife restore the woman her husband restore them parents their children give them back praise God restore the health to those people amen he said now therefore restore the man his wife for he is a prophet man I just love this scripture let me let me just let me just read it to you but let me let me let me let me inject a few things here and he shall pray for thee and thou shalt live and if thou restore her not know thou that thou shalt surely die look who who Who's Making This Promise Abraham is not the one telling this man to restore my wife back or I'mma kill you that's not Abraham's words Abraham is not the enforcer but we get a glimpse of the enforcer the enforcer is God himself talking to ailec restore that man his wife let him pray for you then you'll be blessed and if you don't do it I'mma kill you Thou shalt surely not thou and all that are thine you talk about an enforcer man that man woke up from that dream went quickly to Abraham why why you tell me why you getting me all this trouble with God why you do me like this yeah I thought for sure y'all would kill me man we righteous people down here we don't live like that and so but you see here's a here's a beautiful thing that I like about this that Abraham we see it plainly in scripture Abraham lied right right Abraham told this man that that's my sister she could she she agreed with it they both lied to AMC this is my sister they both lied now when God begin to speak of Abraham when God begin to talk to aimc now you got to have the right type of heart that God can speak to you like this when God begin to speak to Abraham he did not call Abraham a liar did God hear his lie yes he did but even in his condition even in his circumstance even in his situation that's why the prophet say regardless of the condition the restoration happens regardless of the condition regardless of how you put God in a really bad spot regardless of what your family has done to upset the plan of God I want to tell you they haven't even upset the plan of God they are part of the plan of God you know a part of the plan of God is to send the canker worm send the Palmer worm send the Locust send the caterpillar but after all that then I'm going to restore you never even felt the canker worm when it came the Palmer worm and the cat you just saw the results of it you ain't going to feel when restoration is happening but you're going to see the results of [Applause] [Music] [Applause] it the promise was Sarah thy wife shall have a son and regardless of the condition there was a lie told that put them both in this position but regardless of that God say I'm going to restore somebody my God believe the devil's lie and is now experienc experiencing bondage their failures could not sto God's promise amen when in Abraham's situation God gave him back his wife and I don't know what your needs are today but I'm here to tell the devil give it back if he stole your money give it back huh he stole your car give it back if he stole your health give it back if he stole your peace of mind give it back amen hey they say I'm saved Sanctified Holy Ghost filled and serving God in my right mind I I I'm we going to force the devil to give it back no we're not going to be on the defense this year wonder what's going to happen tomor no we going on the offense you going to be wondering what we doing brother brother Westco used to say it's time to give your mind battles mind [Applause] battles oh my my my brother the the the the scripture he didn't call him a liar he called him a prophet and there's many people today that brother brandom said this and it didn't come to pass brother brandom said that and didn't come to pass brother no no no you let's go back and let's look at some of these things that you say didn't happen you you go find me to quote and you tell me now don't tell me what some what you think somebody you heard somebody say you get the quote first and you come show me where he said it and then and then we'll we'll go from there and then the other thing we'll say is that now we see and I I don't feel brother brandom ever intentionally lied to nobody to try to pull people to himself to try to exalt himself in it to try to take the attention from God he always pointed us to Christ and same thing I'm trying to do point you to Christ he always every preacher is doing the same thing pointing you to Christ supposed be right but in in Abraham's case where we see him blatantly tell a lie God didn't call him a liar so why man gonna call him one God say he my prophet and I want him to pray for you now what would you do if you was ailec you know the man just lied to you but if you want your life and your family's life you better get down there to the prophet God you telling me to go to this liar this man nothing but a liar and you want me you want your life you want your family's [Music] life woo let me go I got I got uh a lot that I'm trying to work through here let me go forward let me go forward there might might be some things I can just cut for the day and I I'll pick them up again this this is important to me I I went and I did some research on this Joel 14 and just I got different commentaries uh that I'll I'll read um at a later date I won't read them today but what I want to what I want to try to show is um one of the commentar said that the meaning of of the four Hebrew words of palmerworm locust korm caterpillar the meaning of the for words translated there is uncertain that's the commentary that say the meaning of these words is uncertain now if churches are picking up that commentary and going to preach they would have no idea what Joel was talking about but we're just not looking at commentaries we're looking at prophetic insight and with prophetic Insight we can go into the scripture and see a lot more now I'm going to try to just bring just one little piece here today Lord knows I am I'm running out of time brother brandom said it's four stages of the same insect the Palmer worm he says that worm came to destroy the fruit on the tree he destroyed brother love and and and um uh he eats that faith in the word he also eats the joy of your salvation that Palmer worm was eating the joy of your salvation pretty much no noise in the church when amen and and and brother brand say when you know one brother got offended at him by all the people yelling amen and praising God in church just that just that just get me upset I can't I can't I can't take that I can't handle that he say Well it it it me it messes with me when they don't do it and he say when when they be yelling out a man in church it's like it's like my my my dog that I had I would take him hunting and when we get a or we get a a skunk we get them up the tree and then I say now sick them boy go get a get that skunk out of the tree or get that that raccoon out of the tree go get them sick them boy say when they say amen that's like sick them to the devil all right but the Palmer worm tried to take all that out now one of the other things he said the Palmer worm destroy the brother love and the way that he destroyed the Brotherly Love in the church was through gossip the way that the Palmer worm comes into the church is through gossip somebody do something or say something and you a really like you go I'mma just get this off my mind I got to share it with you God said a Palmer wor starts in the church but he says I will restore Hallelujah and now now brother brandom said the way that we can amen stop that P or he says we need to put up a spiritual electric fence that would stop him in his tracks God put up a spiritual electric fence now I'm leaving that there because I'm hoping brother tro would pick that one up and bring it home to us a spiritual electric fence I'm moving on the Loc amen he eats the leaves of divine Fellowship the caner worm he goes into the bark of the tree the lifeline of the tree and he Des he destroys the covering or the religion because the word uh religion means covering he attacks the doctrine hallelujah amen and and there's so much more that I can I can get in there but I uh let me just just drop this one right here he says um oh my water baptism that Doctrine was attacked in in in the early years of the church rather than baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ because there's nobody Amen in in the New Testament that we can find being baptized in the titles of father son Holy Ghost everybody baptized was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ outside of those that were baptized in John's baptism but we found out John's baptism wasn't enough because in Acts 19 people had to be re-baptized Amen in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ now now now here amen um uh uh brother brandom say you know it's like you can't cash a check if the check was written and signed by boss you can't take that down to the bank and say I want I want to cash this check has been signed by boss they're gonna ask you what is your boss's name because we got a lot of people with Accounts at this Bank by the name boss right or the title boss we got a lot of bosses what is your boss's name he say also you could even cash a check if your boss wrote the check out this is to John do or Jane do take this down there and cash you would stop your boss in his tracks and you say look that ain't going to work the bank ain't G to see me as John do or Jango that's just a a name people use you going have to use my name right and if you can't get a check cash with the name boss or the name jundo or Jano how you going to go to heaven not being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ see the doctrine has to be restored the caterpillar comes along amen he sucks the life out of the church he sucks out the spirit and the way that they suck out the SP Spirit or the life of the church is through denominating see a prophet gives us Insight in this the other thing amen that he tells us uh uh oh my my my my my my that regardless of these conditions regardless of these things that have happened glory to God we're going to see amen a restoration happen now I'm going tell you he talked about this Restoration in so many different phases one of them is through through the church the church ages there was a restoration that took place in the church it's already happened we not waiting on it it has already happened it's when the word came back to us the restoration had already happened let me just I'm I'm I'mma get here and just read read a couple things I'm I'm jumping but I want to do something today and then I because it sets me up for where we want to go in the future here let me just read this one this one one quote I I made a note Amen on uh okay no that's that's good that's good all right proven his word proven his word let me read this one oh Glory that restoration that happens through the church ages in order for the restoration to happen God has to predestinate people that will walk on the earth at a certain time that would believe the fullness of the word oh my my my you know in the days of Paul not everybody believed but there had to be people on the Earth that would believe what Paul was saying in the days of arenus not everybody believed but there had to be people on Earth that would believe what arenus was saying Martin Luther Wesley all of them there had to be people on the Earth that would believe well there was and God predestinate certain people to be there you know what those people are there for to fulfill the restoration oh my my my my my my Lord Jesus those people we and I'm I'm going just tell you like this we are here the reason I'm sitting in spirit and truth tabernac I can be at any other Church in the city but the reason I'm here is because God wanted me to be a part of the restoration now if I said this would it hurt you I am the restoration did that hurt you because there was a a a man that uh that walked he a policeman and he walked around during the days of a wal Revival and they come looking at him asking him where is the West Revival the man didn't Point them to a building you came to found the W Revival you looking at it sir I am the W Revival what he saying is I'm a product of the Welsh Revival people that are waiting on the restoration don't realize you sitting next to a restoration you live with a restoration I am the restoration my very presence my very reason for being here is because God predestinated me to be the restoration I will restore sayeth the Lord look at this this is the quote that just got me and I just I need to share this and then I'm gonna I'm G just try to get out of here I'm oh my I I'll come back and pick up some more things this is out of proving his word he proves his word in every age by the most unusual way but he always does it in the same way see what did he do in the days of Noah somebody asked me a question this week why do we need a prophet I say man I wish they would have asked that to Noah in his day ask Noah why ask the people in Noah's day why they needed the prophet Noah because the word comes to the prophet and I and like I told you I can I can I can give you uh definitions about this scripture and and I'm going to do it if the Lord would allow me in the coming weeks I'm going to give you other definitions that people wrote but it's it don't even compare to what a prophet said it don't even get to the depths of what uh uh when you take prophetic Insight on the same scripture how many people can pick up their Bible and uh uh that which the the the the the Locust uh uh that which the pom have left have the Locust eaten that which the Locust have left have the cankerworm eaten that which the cankerworm have left have the caterpillar eaten how many people come pick that up and and realize what they talking about this is why we need a prophet when I picked up now I can preach to you that scripture because I'm giving it through prophetic Insight what did what did they they ate Fellowship they ate Joy brother brand said they ate peace of mind all of this stuff was eaten from that's what this this this Palmer worm was eating my God eating at the bark eating at the leaves eating at the fruit eating at everything but God said he was going to restore look at this look at this he says what did he do in the days of Noah when he was fixing to deliver the remnant he sent them Noah the prophet he sent Noah a sign and now notice when he comes to deliver the children of Israel what does he do his same way he sends his Prophet His prophets got the word look the signs and wonders of the word promise back the of the word promise backs it up that's it that's it's exactly the truth Israel made her March to the promised land because they believed it now watch this next statement watch this watch this and in the wilderness in the wilderness Journey it came to pass where did they where did they do it now in the wilderness Journey it came to pass that they disbelieved this Prophet after seeing the word being so confirmed the bride got out of Step oh I wish I could just take a long time on that but I'm going just drop this and and I'm going to come back to it this is where my inspiration for this year is that's why I got this little this little statement today get back in step when did they do it when they were going through the Wilderness Journey before they actually made it to the promised land but our promised land is a Rapture before people made it to the Rapture they got tripped up just like Israel got tripped up woo W he says after seeing the word being soak you saw all the the Miracles you read about them you heard them on the books and the text you saw you heard all these testimonies but somehow a website comes along and it trips you up unrightfully deceitfully but give it back look he says after seeing the word being so confirmed the bride got out of Step you know what I'm speaking about in The Vision SE got out of Step there was one stayed up by the name of Joshua and Caleb and believe the word of promis true regardless of what the circumstance was now I like that because God going to fulfill his words regardless of the conditions and you got some folk in here that's going to believe this message regardless of the conditions amen can I can I put it like this when you got one regardless of the conditions over here meeting another regardless conditions over here you know something got to happen and another statement brother random said when two when two omnipotents meet something's got to take place I will restore sayith the Lord now I got a lot more but I I just wanted to kind of just lay a little Foundation to where I want to go as I take my seat oh Lord see I I can preach like that that because I know what I'm talking about see and people and and and and denomination we wait for the preacher to get there he but he just wind that thing up and and I just go to church I see him do it I already I know what they gonna do I just I just stand up and but sometime I be feeling like I be wanting to do it too though I'm going to be honest coming from my Baptist background I'll be feeling that sometime yes sir but but but as I take my seat I simply wanted to bring the voice of the Prophet to you yes Lord he's going to explain to you about the bride getting out of step and I need you to understand something about when the bride got out of Step there was a certain part of this Vision that brother brand was going to explain and and there's a certain part where he was getting ready to scream and he's getting ready to tell the bride now now why did they get out at after they saw the vindications after they saw the word confirmed somehow this unrightful deceitful devil slipped in and caus people to get out get out of Step but the prophet before he could scream out before he could release it from his mouth somehow the people themselves yeah how did they do that the reason that they could do that is because God promised I will restore that's not says brother Jack that sayith the Lord and a restoration happens even when you don't feel it even when you don't see it you look back and see it's already done a restoration [Applause] [Music] [Applause] did you feel yourself coming to the message did you know what you was coming to but yet you were part of the restoration you yourself represent the restoration Hallelujah can we just go to the quote I'm going to prepare to take my seat they're going to

thank you Brothers brother Troy I was over here standing in the I got s minutes to tell you something that happened the day before yesterday to get out on time July the 3 I was over here sitting in the this Center over here shopping center right out from sure I've been in pig alley in Rome in France and I've been New York City Los Angeles but the filthiest bunch of women I ever seen in my life is Jeffersonville Indiana I never seen so much gum and filth in my life as I see him among some people I sat there to my heart eight and the Lord had gave me a vision now I'm going to tell the vision I don't know what I can interpret it but I I'm going to tell the vision for my first time I fell into a trance and when I did there was somebody with me I didn't see the person it was just the voice and uh I looked and as I I looked this way he said the bride will come in view for a preview and I looked coming to me and I seen the most the most prettiest bunch of clean dressed women I ever seen in my life but each one of them looked like was dressed different they all had long hair and they were longer sleeves and skirts and so forth young women they look kind of I'd say about maybe 20 now I have the Bible open here before me I can only say what I seen if you say what are you looking at I'm looking at a clock what you look for I'm looking for people look at people why are you looking at I'm looking at the Bible that's what I'm telling the truth that's what I see now I can only say what I seen I don't I don't know what all about it I just have to tell you but when this bride she was looking right at uh the one was talking to me and I standing together her eyes she was the cleanest sweetest looking people I ever seen in my life look like it could have been a dozen or more just I don't know how many was a breast but they just a group up and she passed by sweetly with an air and her eyes eyes up watching as she passed by oh she was beautiful I looked at her as she passed by he said now we shall review said that's the bride now we will review the churches and they come I notice them coming up and when they come up each one look like got worse I never seen such a filthy bunch in my life and when he sit next I heard a noise and said next said Here Comes the American group now I am an America well this this made me sick I am not uh eloquent enough to in a mixed audience to say what was taking place uh uh uh and you'll have to read between the lines but when the women were coming the leader of them was a witch she had a great long nose and great big mouth and all of them was dressed with some kind of low clothes down here but the top just had a strap that just a little about a/ inch strap that moved up and went around them like this and each woman had something on the order many of you years ago used to remember when we used to cut that paper you know newspaper and make it old fly bush how many remembers you know well I think they using carnivals you know hanging down like a fringe paper lace paper they had something holding below them like this uh holding blow them all this part was exposed and each one had hair cut up real short and Fry looking things all over it like that real shortcut hair and full of makeup absolutely nothing but look like street prostitutes and they were walking with this paper and the vulgarity now the paper was what was hold in front of them but when they pass the review stand in the back of them and to see the way they were going on when their foremost in their back part and how they were acting I said is that the church and there she went and they were singing this year twisting Roll songs you know what you call going down sing going by I said is that the church and I was standing there and in my heart I was crying and this witch to my notion it's nothing else in the world but she's a she's that World Council of churches leading him right straight down the road where she was going they went off to the left and disappeared in chaos still beating this music and making real funny sounds and shaking their bodies one side and then the other side and then like that like that walking and I just started to bow my head and he said wait the bride must come again and I look and here they come again and they pass by a sweet looking little ladies that's all looking around at me as they pass by I noticed each one was dressed different and one in the back had kind of long hair hanging down and had it rolled around like this might have been German or something like that and I watched him and then as he started leaving two or three of them in the back car to get out of step and I was going to holler at him and they trying to get back and step again and I seen him just the vision just fade out and change from now here is the interpretation thereof the reason I remember I had just got through writing I hadn't finished I hadn't wrote these notes yet but in preaching this morning I caught what it was right in my sermon did you notice the church only came and view now that's the truth friends the heavenly father who writes the word knows that I tell the truth I don't I just say the truth and not knowing it till just a few minutes ago look like or just recently see did you notice the Bride come in view twice the first seed the second seed both of them exactly the same one and the reason they were dri dressed in different parts she'll come from All Nations it'll make up the bride each one had long hair no makeup and real pretty girls and they were watching me that representing the bride coming out of all Nations see each one representing a nation as they March perfectly in line with the word thing and then I have to watch her she'll get out of Step of that word if it don't watch when she's passing by if she gets by maybe it'll be my time when I'm over see when I'm finished or whatever it is what they was getting back trying their best getting back this getting line is looking out somewhere else watching about that church and just went out of into chaos but two the front ones never the back ones just two or three of them was kind of stepped out a little bit bit to the right hand side it looked like was trying to get back in line as you went by as this passed me old for here at the wall passed me I was standing there and then I just see it all move out and leave but you notice the church only came in to view once each Nation the church but the Bride come in twice see see what it was now not knowing but look at with my message this morning not knowing that see the seed fell in the ground at NAA that was Original Seed and she's come through the process of these denominations which only comes in existence once but the bride returns back again in the last days I will restore see the Masterpiece is brought up that's the reason she was in view reviewed the second time she was reviewed the first time and she was reviewed the second time and she's perfectly the second time like she was the first time oh God have mercy hurry hurry hurry life get in the green right quick all others never appeared no more they went out never to come back again but the bride came back because she is Alpha and Omega God the great sculpture has made him a masterpiece for it is a piece of his first masterpiece like he made in the garden of Ed and took a piece from and made another piece and that was marred and fell now he's been all this time building it up again and he brought forth this masterpiece and was smitten and order that part that was smitten was an order to bring back again that Masterpiece again so the Masterpiece in the Son of God the Masterpiece in the bride and it's a piece of him which must be the fulfilling of the word the word has been fulfilled and we're ready for the coming of the Lord oh Church of the Living God by your hearts and your yourselves before God these things are true I know that it sounds like it's such a greater thing as that would be it would be so spread out over the Nations it never was he doesn't change his way just be thankful Church be thankful that you are where you are today if you're in Christ of course you see now and when that remember all that life will be gathered right into the green for the resurrection but the stalk must be burned the rest of it the husk and all must be destroyed and it will be don't trust in your them denominations you stay in the word the life God and His Masterpiece now what is in the Millennium Christ and his bride back in the garden of the Millennium amen amen Brothers amen
