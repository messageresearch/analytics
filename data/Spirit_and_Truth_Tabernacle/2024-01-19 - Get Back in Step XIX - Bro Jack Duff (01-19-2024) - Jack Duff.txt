appreciate your service on today thank God for the special and also the worship Amen brother Solomon leading leading us we thank God for all things that have happened uh I'll ask that you get your Bibles um couple things I need to mention to you as we're just turning our Bibles I'm going to go back to Revelation 10 again this morning um uh on Wednesday tonight we the Lord's going to drop something on purpose for us brother Andrew Glover will be passing through uh to preach for us on Wednesday night I believe he's preaching this morning amen at uh Rapture Faith there with brother Mike and then tonight he'll be at um bride of Christ Tabernacle there with brother Jean and then on Wednesday he'll be with us so uh I trust that you all will come Amen to pull on the word of the Lord I know you'll be blessed amen by our brother's Ministry brother Paula fantang will be passing through the very first weekend in February uh so we'll be looking forward to that as well amen and uh uh we want to try to remember brother Smiley and per he is there in uh Orlando this morning preaching at the church there at brother Stacy so uh let's remember him in prayer I'm I'm happy to see restoration amen uh and I know he just kind of took a little time off but uh he can be useful Amen to many of these churches and I'm glad to see that he's getting out there uh um um in the field amen and just letting the Lord use this gift we had a lot of saints that went out of town amen this weekend that's why you see some not here but uh some are out of town amen uh um you know doing what out of town people do uh but we we thank God for all things just pray for them safe journey amen back home let's turn here to Revelation 10 we read this on last week and um um I just kind of felt like the Holy Spirit every everything I was reading was like popping off the you know the pages I'm like I if I keep going we going to be here for 2 or three hours so sometimes you just have to just pull back and just don't don't keep the people that long you know there'll be another service if the Lord T and we'll get more you know from the next service so uh but we just want to pick up where we left off amen we're still in our thought of get back in step and uh and as I'm seeing this this is just uh it it's it's so Grand to me uh this is even for those that might even um you know like I told you there's people that's never heard these things before they're watched online they never heard it but the get back and step theme is for them as well because it's the Holy Spirit calling back to a place in Christ oh my my my my if we could see what God was doing in this hour uh but here Revelation 10 and as I read this uh this is not a past tense uh I mean I'm this is not a a future tense but this is a past tense scripture things that have already happened oh my glory to God so let's read amen Revelation 10:1 says and I saw another Mighty angel uh come down from heaven clothed with a cloud uh and a rainbow glory to God was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little a book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon left foot on the earth cried with a loud voices when a lion Roth and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and and when I say this is a past tense um scripture uh let me declare we actually know what the seven Thunders utter this church and there's other churches all over the world that know what the seven Thunders uttered because a prophet told us that the seven Thunders uttered what was inside the seals so when you listen to The Seven Seals you know what the Thunders uttered amen praise God it's it's in our hands past tense glory to God Amen and verse uh verse 5 says and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the Sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer uh but in the days of The Voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God shall be finished as he have declared to his servants the prophets now let me uh just go back to Joel uh 2 because what we just saw as far as when the when that seventh angel sounds the mystery of God will be finished uh that is right here in Joel 2 as well um this is um um uh verse 25 I'll just just give you that one and I will restore to you the years that the Locust have eaten the korm and the caterpillar and the palore and my great Army which I sent among you so this restoration happens at the same time that all the Mysteries are revealed amen praise God so let's pray amen father we thank you for the ability to read the word but we know it takes the Holy Spirit to help us understand what it is that we have read so father we trust that the the Holy Ghost will come now and anoint this portion of the service just as you've anointed uh the musicians and their playing and and uh the song leader and leading Us in songs a special that went forth by Sister Sharice and everything that has happened the congregation enter into this this this this place of worship and God we uh we just appreciate all that you're doing in our midst we pray father that you would just bless Lord this portion of the service and bless those that we here not just present but those online and God just remember each one remember brother Smiley as he's there ministering the word of the Lord today use them for your glory god you know what that church is in need of so we ask that you'd help them to get himself out of the way that you could use them there all the other saints that are traveling Lord uh for the various reasons pray that you bless them and watch over them and keep them Lord until they return uh we just trust God that you take control over this portion of the service in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you can be seated I also want to mention so good to see sister Isabelle Amen in service today she's been working so much but she finally got a Sunday off amen God bless you Sister Isabelle amen praise the Lord all right all right amen so we we continue our journey I want to just go back to the quote that I was trying to read last week and uh we'll just uh go forward from there we we um uh speaking from a place of just seeing the scripture already manifested and uhu and there are things that um like I said there are people that that have no idea of these things that that we are talking about uh for us it may be just going over refresher we've heard it for years uh but that's okay the the reason that we have to keep preaching because we're looking for the last seed Amen to come uh that last person that would recognize um you know that what day they're living in so you know it's very important for us to make sure that they have Clarity amen uh anointed ones at the end time is where I'm reading from and um this um this quote goes along with Revelation 107 so brother brandom helps us to understand this says notice compare them together uh when now when you get home notice Matthew 24:24 and that's a very very very important scripture um praise the Lord very important scripture because um there we find a statement made by Jesus that um if it were possible it would deceive the very elect and and and and what what I've come to realize is that since I am elect then I can not be deceived because Jesus spoke a word over me and there's people sometimes a little afraid to step out you know and and take a hold of this message because they're not used to uh God using prophets they're they're not used to that type of language or the prophets that they're talking about is somebody that rose up and Prophet lied right I mean so they're afraid of that but but when you got bogus dollars just remember it has to be at least one real dollar somewhere to make all the bogus dollars amen but but when God promises that he's going to use certain Ministries and and he's going to do certain things we have to look for that to be fulfilled in the scripture amen things that happened after Jesus died and rose again amen so so so we have to be able to kind of catch these things and and this is our job to try to try to bring that forth but but here he says compare it compare it compare them together now when you get home Matthew 24:24 4 Jesus speaking Paul in 2 Timothy 3:8 many others he says now compare that he says and then put another scripture Luke 17:30 and Malachi 4 wait a minute compare what all right compare Matthew 24:24 which tells us that the very elect can't be deceived and then compare that with St Luke 17:30 and Malachi 4 so when we see the man estation of Malachi 4 and we see the manifestation of St Luke 17:30 then we know the elect will not be deceived the elect will know this is a part of scripture yes sir amen we are living in the days of scripture being fulfilled Hallelujah we'll go a little further here amen he says this he says um as Janice and jambre with stood Moses the anointed word of the hour so will these men not man men anointed ones resist the truth and this ain't nothing but the truth if you look at believe the sign or you've heard about that they used to believe the sign but they stopped believing it and uh but it's men that rose up and start resisting the truth and still doing it he says in the very day that the son of man is revealed Revelations 10 1-7 read it when you get home we just read it the seventh Angel's message opening up the seals what is it not the angel is the son of man the son of man not the angel is the son of man we're going to read this scripture in a little bit but but just bear with me not the angel is the son of man we not here just promoting brother brandom please don't don't don't misunderstand us we're not here what it is and like like like like my mom said and I just loved that said no we're not putting him on the same level of of of Jesus that is not what we're doing but what we are doing is we're putting them on the same level as Paul and as Moses amen and in Moses day they had to say what Moses said right amen and still today we saying what Paul said right right I mean he's the one that came and gave us 2/3 of the New Testament if things were over after Jesus died and rose again why did Paul Come Along Paul was not even Walking With Jesus huh Paul Paul was fighting against Jesus and he was living during that time but Paul was Paul received a revelation and with that Revelation wrote 2/3 of the New Testament we thank God for what Paul wrote we thank God for what brother Brandon preached because it was the same thing all right let's let's go on a little further he says this says now not the angel is the son of man but the messenger is revealing the son of man can you get it separated at now and that's important that we all get that separated get it separated keep it separated all right amen he says that's where it seems to be so hard for you see says not the son of man himself but the seventh angel the seventh messenger is revealing to the public the son of man because it's left a shook now I'm going to say this again amen while I'm here you know one of the things brother brandom taught us he says if you reading your Bible and uh and you can't see Christ in the scripture he says go back and read it again all right glory to God he said the other things that Jesus Christ is the principal theme of all of this Jesus Christ is the principal theme of this message that we believe Jesus Christ is the principal he should be the Principal theme of any sermon that we're presenting from the pull pit glory to God he say so so so he he already told us that that Jesus Christ the principal them that's why we don't sing songs in this church amen that don't honor Christ hello somebody glory to God and I know people got songs in this message that just talk all about brother Brandon but nothing about Jesus we don't sing them songs because he told us that Jesus Christ should be the Principal them of it all praise the Lord somebody all right all right all right let's go on it says um uh uh it it's Le the Shu he can't organize it it's the grain itself again he says and in the day Jan Janice and jambre will withstand anointed ones make Believers and unbelievers the church former and the Pentecostals stand up against the True Grain but let them alone their Folly will be made manifest as theirs was see you understand now it goes on it says Revelation 10 said in the days of the sounding of the seventh angel now remember seventh leoda Church age and that's why I'm I mentioned to y'all when we read Revelation 10:7 and it talks about at the sounding of the seventh Angel's message the MS of God will be finished what Angel is he referring to that angel is the same one found in Revelation 3:14 which is the messenger to the lean Church age so brother Brandon's Ministry is identified in both Revelation 3:14 Revelation 10:7 both is is his ministry all right God promised it let's go on amen he says this now uh uh the sounding of that angel when the church age is done denominated and become a church age when it's done when when it's done in the Pentecostal organization when the messenger to that what what was each messenger what was Martin Luther a rebuke to the Catholic amen what was Wesley a rebuke to them lutherans and it's so important that we you know uh I I as as um you know some of us were not born in this message we come from different denominational backgrounds uh you know but understand that when Luther came out Luther was protesting all the things that he saw wrong in the Catholic church and he nailed his 95 thesis to the church door and say enough is enough something's got to change when God was uh when God anointed Luther to do that that's how we know a move was on Amen and Luther happened to be a messenger to the Sardis Church age amen but but Luther them got denominated now it was not Luther that started the Lutheran denomination it was the people that was following Luther that started that denomination and as soon as it denominated yes God was using it but as soon as it denominated God stopped using it and he moved on to his next next part of the plan and the next part of God's plan was to raise up a man by the name of John Wesley praise the Lord John Wesley was a star in the hand of Jesus he was a messenger to the Philadelphian Church Age come on church amen and he begin to preach a a gospel that that begin to bring the people back to the word and and Luther preached uh the the justification just shall live by faith but Wesley begin to preach sanctification oh my my my my my my my and as as as Wesley begin to preach amen a new organization started now after Wesley left the scene they start a new organization what is this new organization the Methodist right but Wesley was not the one started it's the people that came after the Wesley that started that yet God was in it but when they start a denomination what does God do move on again where did God move to God moved to the Pentecostals when they were not a denomination when they were just people amen going from place to place house to house almost having prayer meetings and God came down because it was time amen for God to do something with this restoration but but but William Seymour and all the ones back in that time here they were H used by God but when they became a denomination yeah we got two that that that that came out of it we got the the the Church of God in Christ amen and we got the Assemblies of God and it was divided over color of skin Lord oh can I I can say some things here a church should not be divided over the color of skin come on somebody a church should be United by the word of God we we have the look Beyond skin color when we get to the other side we might as well look beyond that now and when you really think about it praise God I don't care what your skin color is I don't care what nation you come from if when when we when we really think about it we [Music] cousins hello somebody how can you say that brother Jack because ham sham and was brothers and all of Us come from Ham shama we cousins blood praise God and we got something greater than a natural bloodline that keeps us connected together and that is the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ this gospel is not to divide this gospel unites us blessed be the name of the Lord so when you see the the the Pentecostal organization go out into their separate ways like that God leaves it and he moves on to something else where can we find them today in the end time message of the hour because that's the word of God that has come back to restore the people to where they're supposed to be let us keep reading my God my God he says what what what was each messenger what was Martin Luther a rebuke to the the Catholic what was Wesley a rebuke to them lutherans what was what was the Pentecost a rebuke to them mothers where has the life gone now away from an organization no more shck it's the grain what what what what is it a rebuke to the Pentecost see fulfill the scripture of this hour see let's go on it says notice the very day when this messenger not when he starts on but when he begins to declare his message see the first pull healing second pull prophesying third pull the opening of the word when the seals was preached opening of the word and many other things amen that he already preached before he got to the seals it says the opening of the word the Mysteries reveal no more there is no more higher order to reveal the word than Prophets this is this very important cuz God said in his word surely I'll do nothing unless I reveal my secrets to my servants the prophets that's Amos 3:7 so no higher order to reveal the word amen than the prophets all right he says uhh he says uh but the only way a prophet can be Vindicated is by the word I like that a only way a prophet can be Vindicated is by the word that mean we got to be able to see his ministry in the scripture Revelation 10 we see his ministry in the scripture Revelation 3:14 we see his ministry in the scripture praise God Amen St Luke 17 we'll read it a little bit later we're going to see his ministry in the scripture my God Malachi 4 we see his ministry in the scripture all over the scripture not just one but all over the scripture we see this ministry that's why we follow it because it's according to the script and the ministry is not to lead us to him the ministry is to draw us closer to Christ yes sir can I can I can I can I can I just be honest with you you won't even know Christ if you don't know the word you won't know Christ if you don't know the word now I'm explaining that that that statement when Jesus rose again he was on the road to emus uhhuh yeah with a few Brothers they were so downcast in their Spirit right they had they they and they like man we thought he was the one we thought this we thought that he would he would take us from this Roman amen per uh persecution he would do all these things but had no idea who he walked with him slept with him ate with him talk with him had no idea who he was oh my but on the road to emus as they downcasting Spirit he begin to amen just break the word of God to them Hallelujah it begin to explain this scripture and explain that scripture did the prophet did not the prophets in the Old Testament say this and did not this one say that and didn't David say this and then Isaiah say this didn't this one say that I mean he was just breaking it all down and when they finally I mean the Bible actually tell you in Luke 24 you can go back and read it but but B say when when it finally when it finally clicked it said did not our hearts burn Hallelujah as he spake to us the scriptures oh my God if the scripture don't make you shout ain't nothing going to make you shout but when the scripture has been revealed and amen being made known and and you begin to understand that the scripture is Quicken it's a whole different story then you got to know him according to the word and even in that story in Luke 24 Their Eyes Were blinded they couldn't know they didn't even know that Jesus was walking with them Jesus with all the scripture that was being taught they still was blinded so they they but they knew something about this man breaking the word down they done been to church for years ain't nobody broke the word down like this but when they say say look don't the night the day is far spent don't go any further come come come they they saw Jesus giv to to walk on he said he said no no no no don't don't go any further just just come with us come on the inside he was waiting on that invitation and when he got to the inside of the room with him amen they they pulled out some bread to eat and and Jesus Took the bread and when he broke the bread and the way that he broke the bread them brothers knew can't nobody break bread like this and don't don't get me wrong we're not talking about breaking physical breads we're talking about breaking spiritual breads when the bread is being broken and Revelation is coming we're we're getting stimulation of Revelation the fats are overflowing with wine and oil Hallelujah when that's happening the amen the the bread is being broken again for the people for them to recognize Christ in their day Christ according to scripture sir amen hallelujah let me keep reading my God my God my God my God I know where I'm standing I'm standing on the word and and heavens and earth will pass away but this word won't won't fail it won't fail this word won't fail remember the third pull opening of them Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word do you see it says it is in that day when this thing take place that Janice and jam the impersonators it is then and that day when this this is take place I'm sorry will appear again just like they did when Moses appeared with the original word to say to say it they they appear to impersonate just exactly right now you see Matthew 24:24 see anointed ones and and there's there's the there's the other thing I want you to get it now they are anointed with the genuine Holy Ghost to do what they doing and God will put them before you like that to see which decision you're going to make and and let me tell you because what God God wants you to do is base your decisions upon his word don't base your decision on no feeling don't base it on no emotion and I don't care what church you go to and they prophesy over you and they prophecy is absolutely right that don't mean you become a part of that church Hallelujah you better watch what you get yourself involved with cuz the rain is fall on the just and the unjust and for me when I if I can see the the unjust using the gifts of God like that what about the just all right all right all right Hallelujah that's why I believe in the restoration because those gifts are supposed to be amongst the just amen amen you shouldn't have to go to no denominational church and they tell you I see the Lord calling you to this career mhm you should be able to get that right here amen you should be at somebody with a gift of wisdom somebody with a gift of knowledge somebody living close to God that ought to be able to give you that oh my God part of our part of our lacking of this is because of how we get so wrapped up in the things of the world Amen I might as well be honest church it's because we get so wrapped up in the things of the world I'm tell y'all something I might as well say these things while I'm here now I'm a I I I played football I played uh basketball uh when I was a young man now I play golf cuz I can't do all that no more but I I've always been a a guy that was in sports and I love sports I love sports but I I found it you know sometimes even you know uh it's playoffs time and you get really you know I want to see who winning I want to see who doing this I want to see that but I come to find out uh if I click on a link they want me to pay to watch sports and I told the devil I refuse to actually pay to have to watch sports now now that's something when the devil got you paying for it it used to be free but now the devil got people paying for it that's a shame before God and I might as well say this we need to cancel some of our subscriptions amen amen we need to cancel some subscriptions tell the devil I refuse to pay for something like this amen my God my God but I'm telling you if we got closer to God we'll see more of God Amen Church all right all right all right amen and and I think that's the problem we want God to do it all but we don't want we don't want to give up nothing we don't want to give up nothing no fasting no praying back in the old days they did that and they saw more of God in their midst we got to wait for once a year for the pastor to call for a corporate fast you ought to be fasting every week hello somebody oh my god oh Jesus boy I get out here and can't get back to where I'm going but it's it's the truth anyhow we we we we need this we want see God restore and God's not a past tense God he's a present tense God he he wants to use the gifts that he has right here in our midst but those gifts need to surrender themselves to God to be used by him right it's going to take some prayer yes sir it's going to take some prayer amen it's going to take some fasting it's going to take some giving some time to Goden glory to God even even in sports you don't want no player that just show up on game day he never come to practice he just show up on game day and and and and he want the ball no you got to come to practice my friend put in some time at home Glory Glory Glory Glory all right all right all right all right so I I I did I finish this yeah yeah let me just get the last paragraph on that uh it is then in that day when this thing is to take place that Janice and jambers the impersonators will appear again just like they did when Moses appeared with the original word that say they appear to impersonate impersonated just exactly right now you see what Matthew 24:24 is see anointed ones all right let me go on I want to pick up uh a quote out of restoration of the Bride tree and uh yes all right praise the Lord praise the Lord this restoration of the Bri tree is where the whole inspiration of our restore sayth the Lord that goes with the theme of get back in Step uh these two were connected throughout last year and they're moving forward this year amen with a another layer amen of inspiration and that's amen the year of overflow all right so we're we're just we're just taking all of this and just absorbing what God has for us so amen here in the message the restoration of Bri tree brother Brandon makes this statement says amen restore restore all the signs restore all the signs remember last week I told you now one there's many signs and we going we going we're going to get them today signs that show that we are in the end time however there is a chief sign that you want to make sure you keep your eyes on and a chief sign is when God sends to the earth a prophet that's a chief sign all right amen it says amen restore all all the signs the sign of lot at the end time here's another one we've went through that how that lot this angel of Jehovah made flesh among the people see with his back turned to the tent and said where is Sarah thy wife now in that those two sentences two things happen glory to God one was the sign of lot we'll read about that in a second and at the same time that the sign of lot is going forth amen the sign of Jehovah in flesh is also going forth now what is problem what the problem is that everybody got this their eyes on the sign of lot but they're missing Jehovah in flesh that's right Lord oh my all right let's keep going here we go it says the angel of Jehovah made flesh among the people sat with his back turned to the tent and said where is Sarah th wife in the tent behind you he said I'm going to visit you and Sarah laughed he said why did Sarah laugh uh her in the tent amen Jesus said it'll be the same thing at the coming oh then the evening lights of Malachi 4 come shining through the darkness Amen to bring the evening light on the predestinated word I love that the evening light of Malachi 4 amen come shining through the darkness Amen to bring the evening light on the predestinated word that's what we're living in that's what we're walking in that's what we're listening to the evening light hallelujah amen as promised according to Malachi 4 in Revelation 10 we're listening to that he says uh he says hallelujah what's the fourth message to be what's that fourth Messenger to shine the light on the word and when you talk about the fourth messenger the fourth message is the cankerworm the Palmer worm the caterpillar the Locust right because those were four death Messengers but there's four life Messengers and that fourth light brings back the word may amen hallelujah said what's the fourth message be what's the fourth message to shine the light on the word the word is predestinated it has to come forth something has to do it what we're doing in these next next few uh weeks is I'm taking that light and I am shining it on specific scriptures so that we can have Clarity and understanding as to what it is that we believe amen watch this now we're going to take the light and shine it this morning so let's go let's go on he says um to shine the light on the word the word is predestinated it has to come forth something has to do it for God said I will restore say the Lord I will restore right the evening lights come shining through on that predestinated word yes sir he says oh it shall be light start singing a song in the evening time the path to Glory you will surely find Amen in the Waterway is the light today buried in the precious name of Jesus young and old repent of all your sins the Holy Ghost will surely enter in for the evening light has come yes and it's a fact praise God God in Christ are one amen Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the New Testament yes sir he goes on says there they are one together one in us the same signs human beings can't do as Manifest themselves comes out the word to bring forth the predestinated word of God out of the roots of the tree back Yonder that all the denominations that refused and refused and refused but there will come a light forth my God and and and and now look denominations are still refusing this I had a a cousin that used to be here you know uh with me in the church he was my song leader and he left and went back to his denomination church and but he left with some uh some uh packages if I can put it that way he had he had he I I remember amen when I preached about them Ducks one time years ago in in uh Green Acres my God he was on fire he went and bought me he found a a little little picture of some ducks amen uh uh uh flying south and he gave me the picture I got I had it in my office and got it in storage right now but but you know he was just so inspired but when he left he went back to the denational church and he began to try to preach right some of this message they recognize ah no no no n no n n n and and the Pastor said now we know where you're getting that from we don't believe that over here we don't believe that over here we know where you're getting it from don't bring that no more here to the pull pit cuz we don't we don't believe that Hallelujah so they still rejecting the word they still refusing the word I told you if you just look at Revelation 3 you would see the manifestation of it right there in the midst of the organization Jesus is on the outside of his church knocking trying to get back in amen where did they reject Jesus Oh My they rejected his word that's where they're rejecting Jesus yes sir all right all right and and and now don't get me wrong we know that they picking up the Bible and they preaching amen the miracles of Jesus we know that but that's not all the word just because you preaching the miracles of Jesus can you also preach the Prophecies of Jesus okay can you preach it because if you can't preach that if you can't see the Prophecies of Jesus then you're not preaching all of Jesus Oh My My My the only way you're going to get all Jesus is somebody can see the whole picture from Genesis and Revelation amen amen all right all right all right hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah all right so this says there there they are one one together one in us the same sign human beings can't do it can do is manifesting themselves comes out the word to bring forth the predestinated word of God out of the roots of the tree back Yonder that all the denominations that refused and refuse and refuse but there will come a light forth there will come a light will rise whereabouts over in Jerusalem no sir evening lights will not rise in Jerusalem the evening lights goes where in the West yes sir right here where we standing at amen they had their day and refused it but the evening light shall rise in the west what for to shine upon the word what to ripen the fruit bring forth the bride tree with the same signs this is this is important the bride tree coming forth with the same signs the Wonders and the fruits that they had at the beginning that's right amen all I'm we're not taking anything less than that it says it shall be light in the evening time right oh the word will then bring forth its fruit in its season yes sir watch this it shall not wither but it'll bring forth its fruit David said in its Seasons amen same fruit it had at the beginning I'm going on a little further it says now with his words and his predestinated stage as he's got it now and we see these words all being manifested what is it it's a perfect Vindication that the coming of the Lord is at hand watch it now and the time uh when he said I'll restore say the Lord and all that them canker worms all that the Methodist left all that the caterpillars eaten all that is that this done after they uh stripped it down but I will restore in the evening time oh my woo all right all right it goes into a song there and I'll just uh skip the song talking about oh how I love Jesus and and we got to love him we got to love him according to his word and so when he when he when he when he when he gets here tell us that it's the same signs the same signs he's restoring the same signs as a days of lot now let's slip over to the scripture St Luke 17 Hallelujah these are things that go that Jesus Promised and if we we can't preach this part of the Bible we not preaching all the Bible then we got to take the whole book amen amen St Luke 17 all right watch uh this I wanted to uh pick up a little early I was going to start at 26 but I'll start at 22 now this is important because we begin to see Prophecies of Jesus right here in our midst every day it says and he said unto his unto the disciples the days will come when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the son of of man and remember I I I started off by reading a quote where brother brandom say can't you get it separated now the messenger is not the son of man but the messenger is revealing the son of man the messenger is a son of man and his job is to reveal the son of man so a son of man as a prophet reveals the prophet of prophet Prophets The King of Kings the Lord of lords Jesus Christ John the Baptist was a son of man revealing the son of man at the first coming of Jesus if he used the prophet to introduce him at the first coming his pattern is simply the same because he does not change according to Hebrews 13 and8 he's the same yesterday the day and forever if he used the prophet at the first coming he will use a prophet amen at the second coming and that Prophet is a son of man revealing the son of man language is important here when we look in scripture verse 22 and he said unto the disciples the days will come when you shall desire to see one of the days of of the son of man and ye shall not see it right then he goes on says and they shall say to you see here or see there go not after them nor follow them for as the lightning that lith out of the out of the one part under Heaven shineth unto other part under heaven so shall also the son of man be in his day but first must he suffer many things and watch this now one of the things he going to be that he's going to he's going to endure one of the things that the son of man going to endure he's going to be rejected of this generation so I I I think I mentioned last week people don't even realize they fulfilling scripture when they're walking away from the word they reject the word they're rejecting Christ can I I'm going just I'm going let me just make it very simple these are simple statements to reject the word is to reject Christ to receive the word is to receive Christ all right all right he says but first he must suffer many things and be rejected of this generation and look at this and as it was in the days of when you when you look at it it seem like it going to say noi but no it's Noah as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man now you got to understand what happened in the days of Noah right if it's going to be the same at the coming of the son of man thee not a thee son of man when when he comes these are certain signs that we need to look for one of the signs is the days of Noah now now they actually tell us Amen in verse verse 27 what kind of happened there they did eat yes they drank they married wives my God they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all let's break these things down so we just don't go right over the top of them what were some of the signs listen now amen and when when when when when we're talking about the coming of the lord it's it's like it's like uh me getting on the road and and getting ready to drive to Orlando it's about a 2 and 1/2 three hour drive from here amen now if I if I if I'm if I'm going in the right direction glory to God I should see signs on the road telling me I'm moving in the right direction when I first get out down the highway it might say uh uh uh Orlando uh 180 miles or something like that whatever it is 180 miles now if I'm moving in the right direction if I get up the road a little bit further I should see Orlando 150 Mi then I should see Orlando 120 Mi that let me know I'm moving in the right direction if I get out there and say Orlando 180 miles and I start going in One Direction then I say Orlando 220 miles Orlando 250 miles I am moving in the wrong direction the other thing is if I'm moving in the wrong direction I won't even see no size porting to Orlando right I see signs going to Miami somewhere else but I won't see signs Orlando that should be something that make me stop and think am I moving in the right direction so we if we getting closer to the coming of the Lord there are certain things we're supposed to see now you can't stop this from happening in the earth it was prophesied amen amen only thing you can stop is that you w't be a part of it right right amen I see it but I ain't going to be one of them watch this now here go some signs here goes some signs to look at first one is they did eat they drank very very normal things to do to eat and drink problem is is when they do it the way we do it especially here in the US Buffet is everywhere yeah they eat they eat too much y'all saw the video with the man say he said you you got to leave you eat too much and and and and here here here here here here in our I mean you go other plac they don't have it like this but but uh but but man McDonald's Burger King when you go they give you the big gulp size extra large and everybody always want to up it up take me to a large you want the the biggest of the big and actually do more damage to your body is the truth any any anyhow glory to God man not just no one Burger give me that double right this is where the problem is right so so so so watch it say say us they did eat they drank they married wives wives why why it say married Wise It's because there would be a problem with divorce and remarriage divorce and remarriage all you got to go go to go to uh uh uh uh what's Nevada Las Vegas just pull just drive in drive through marriage and drive- through divorce I mean people don't have no no no no no commitment to their marriages anymore it's just a this is what you see it's a that's why you see a lot of marital problems hitting the church right but this is a spirit that comes into the land don't think the devil won't attack your marriage there's a spirit that comes into the land to do this in this time you got to resist that devil I made a vow I made a commitment and I'm stuck to You Like Glue hello somebody this is what the this is what they mean by Mar wives lot of marriage and divorce issues other thing is they were given in marriage what does that mean that mean they living with each other without being married to each other now you know that's happening all around you and and this why I say you got you got loved ones that you know they living in sin I I might as well just be honest and tell you they are living in sin and you can't come to my house like that amen are y'all married you can't stay here this is not a hotel God bless me with this house and y'all ain't living here like that amen hello somebody amen amen this is this is what the scripture is telling us when when it says that they they were given in marriage they acting like they married but they're not all right let's go in a little further until the day that Noah entered into the ark now it used to be time people feel so convicted by that they don't even feel conviction anymore no conviction watch it says uh until the day that Noah enter the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all people just going to keep going in sin and the FL they're going to be destroyed not just a flood of water it's going to be a flood of fire let me go on now look at what happens because there's another thing that happens in the days of lot where he says in the days of Noah so Noah was was was marriage problems amen divorce problems amen people living together not being married now now what happens when when you when you when oh Lord Jesus when we become cheap what happens sisters when you become cheap something else happens there's another spirit that comes along when when when when when when when when God when when when women become easy for God's just a Chase I mean women don't have no standards look bro you going to have to have a job praise the Lord y'all done got me off my subject but bro you got have to have a job because the

right so sisters don't I'm I'm just telling you don't be don't be cheap but don't be you know bougie either get somewhere in the me in the Middle with some character now because women have become cheap yeah there's another problem that comes into this day and it's a spirit that we all see it look at and Jesus prophesied these things would be here now now let me let me just tell you not only are they here in this day they taking over churches [Applause] yes yes and the brother just told us on on Wednesday night y'all that was here yeah and the man was walking right into my sermon say went to a church make sure went to a church the preacher preaching the sister was there in the church and he kept running up to her and say sister I think you got something to say she said no I a't I ain't got nothing to say I ain't got nothing to say I'm I'm good kept on preaching came back to again the Lord telling me you got something to say I ain't got nothing to say I'm not no preacher I ain't got nothing to say so she said that she say Lord if that man come back again then I think you want me to say something Lord and I'mma say it if you come back again I wasn't going to say nothing but but if he come back to me then I'm I'm going have to say it he went around preaching just running around preaching preaching preaching finally end up right back at the sister I know the Lord telling me that you got something to say she said yeah I do I rebuke that homosexual Spirit that's in you right [Music] now he got blasted in front of everybody m that's right well that's the days of lot let's read it oh I'm now y'all know this ain't nothing but the truth even y'all at home got to sayen y'all ordaining homosexuals to preach their Spirit was never for it but yet they s because they're part of an organization that's why I rather be not connected to organization I want to be connected to the world word of God but but but but you you not do a homosexual to preach the gospel what can they preach Lord they they ain't even been delivered ain't nothing they can say look at this ver verse 28 likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drink they they bought they sold they planted they build it when you see all the building happening that's why anybody tied to real estate you're going to do well because it's a prophecy of Jesus right so so so so this these are things that supposed to happen when you see the economy just just blossoming like that all building and buying land and selling land I mean just you it's just unbelievable and not of prices of land is especially here in Palm Beach County how house prices is just going out through the roof and and I I went I went somewhere the other day I don't know oh I think I went to get my my car wash and um just because I have a truck they want to charge me a little extra for the truck I look I looked I say you know everything going up but my paycheck people Charing for everything now house prices out the roof you can't find just that cheap house that you used to look for it's not there anymore in the market and even in a down Market the prices are still up this is prophecy but I I tell I I will tell you this God will provide for [Music] you don't matter what the market look like God going to provide for you if he got to send you money from some somewhere he'll do it I'm telling you I know a God that can give $300,000 cash Amen brother look in to buy a house and the man gave him $300,000 cash didn't even know he had it thought it was a bag of candy I can't tell the testimony but I but I know that God here he says this um uh they sold they planted they built it but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rain fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all now now now the the thing about this it you know when it just say the days of lot you got to be the one to go back and read in Genesis 19 what happened in lot's day why why when why did fire and brimstone come down because of a lifestyle when the when the ladies get cheap now I I I say not sisters actually don't don't let don't even call it ladies women women but when women uh just get cheap and and and and any man can come by and do whatever he want when whenever he want come on right when you get cheap like that it causes men to stop pursuing women right and it caused women Amen to start being pursu it's caused men to start pursuing men because they that that's a harder thing to get right I'm telling the truth and then it caused women because they've been hurt in so many relationships they don't trust men no more because they've been hurt now they get connected with a woman that hurt was a spirit that was anointing you causing you to fulfill the days of lot Hallelujah ain't nothing but the truth but but but but Jesus say these things will be there when you recognize it when you see it you start running for your life I ain't going to be a part of this amen amen but but but but but God had to destroy the city of Sodom gor because of the sin that was happening all the I mean God even sent Angels down to this city an Angelic beings came and the men of the city went to lot's house knocking on door say you know uh uh bring those uh visitors out they I mean visitors Heavenly visitors only showed up one night in the city and these people spirit so bad when when you got when you got your home homosexual friends trying your cousins that just came and are trying trying anybody they'll try everybody they try preachers they try everybody I know I know what I'm talking about cuz I I was working on the job with one that fell made a comment to me and I say uh now see if I said that I lose my job I lose my job and if I go to go to report you to HR they're going to still cause me to lose my job over what you just said M kind of give him that a certain look I ain't got to say nothing you know what the look mean don't try me you going to need more than you and your friend cuz it ain't going down like that amen but but but these Spirits are so prevalent and and and I mean like like now you go to work and one person is is James uhhuh on Friday but when he come back on Monday or he take a week off and come back from vacation his name changed call me Jamie and I know one of the brothers uh from Africa he went to he saw this guy is James and he come back say call his no I'm James James and went to HR said no he wants to be called I know what he want to be called but his name is James he lost his job yeah but you know what when he get the when when that guy get the get to Judgment Day he going to see that same brother James it'll be judgment to him now we ain't got a we ain't got a we ain't got to knuckle down to sin if if God got to bless you with another job then let him bless you with another job but these are spirits in this day Jesus told us about it and when we allow this stuff to come into the church then you know we got some real big problems well God just love everybody he do love everybody but he don't love the sin that everybody's doing well what did he die for if he died for your sins then get then then get get rid of them repent get rid of your sin amen amen amen amen right but here but but here we we see all this and it's very obvious to me with the homosexuality rise the marriage and divorce problem and notice all this hit at the same time that's what Jesus said in this scripture all this here at the same time but the other thing that happened and I and I'm trying to make my my turn out done lost track of time but just I I want to read just one other thing for you but when this happens the same thing happening when all is sin is mounting up there is a visitor that is visiting Abraham now here here's a question let me just put it down like now there there there there there's three groups in this day of the days of lot and the son of man come during a time like that it's a promise that these are going to be signs during that time these are things we can look at we know Jesus is coming soon this is why we have an end time message because these are end time signs the days of lot the days of Noah and another thing in days of Noah it was violence all over the land yes sir we see that today too sir every time you turn on you pick up a newspaper somebody and Di police brutality and and and don't we need the police I'm not trying to defund the police but some sometime the police make some mistakes we got we got we got stuff going on it's just it's it's UNC controllable sin just on every hand so much violence but that happened in the days of Noah but we got these three groups we got we got lot we got the sodomites and we got Abraham all right now lot was in Sodom with the sodomites Abraham was in the outside not only just on the outside but praying for his nephew lot that was on the inside the question is which group do you want to be a part of cuz I can tell you what happened amen with the sodomites they result they died fire and brimstone lot got pulled out let's keep reading I I forgot to read this part let's keep reading verse verse verse 29 verse 30 even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed now now see the son of man got to be revealed how is the son of man revealed by a son of man who reveals the son of man so a prophet has to reveal [Applause] Christ amen amen let's keep going in that day he which shall be upon the Housetop and his stuff in the house let him not come down and take it away and he that is in the field let him likewise not return back remember Lot's wife Jesus telling us to remember these things because Abraham is not here Abraham is praying for lot to come out never specifically call lot by name but he say Lord if there just be 50 righteous would you would you spare what if it's lacking five what if it's 30 25 20 okay one more prayer what if it's just 10 righteous would you destroy the city for 10 righteous if I find 10 righteous I won't destroy now Abraham never asked for lot specifically but he knew what was in Abraham's heart and he went right to lot's house and he got lot out invited lot invited lot's children now lot had two daughters that came but lot had Sons down there too that didn't come out lot had grandchildren that didn't come out because brother Brandon say the reason that Lot's wife got got there she could hear her grandchildren a prophet tell you that she could hear her grandchildren and was so attached to them grandchildren that she turned in her heart she wanted to go back you when when God called you out of sin in your heart you can't want to go back [Applause] [Music] when you come to this you got to be satisfied you got to see this that's better than anything that God that that God could allowed you to get in this life being a Christian is the best life that one can live amen here see you got to understand Spirits just open up so many other Spirits you you you you you you you get started with drinking drinking now will connect you with with smoking smoking would connect you with sexual sins and I mean it just just keeps going on and on and you find yourself like Legion I got 2,000 demons in me don't even know how they got here and legion's Demon was connected to a lie brother Brandon said that the young fellow uh maybe maybe went out and smoked something and then after he smoked he come back and he put something on his breath so people can smell they smok and then he tell um uh maybe his mom or his wife You' been out smoking no he say soon you say no a demon step in something else come up and you and you lie about that another demon step in right amen and every time you tell a lie and then you get to a spot you don't you don't you don't you don't even know when you're lying and not don't that you start believing your own lies and every time you do it another demon stepping in another demon stepping another demon stepping in and you 2,000 demons don't even know how he got there but you know what this this is the beautiful part about a man with 2,000 demons could be delivered by Jesus Christ Hall by coming in contact with Jesus Christ 2,000 demons can't even hold them amen and then 2,000 demons start praying yes sir amen yeah demons say please don't send us to the abyss but would you allow us to go into these pigs and G Jesus say yes I give you permission to go into the swine so I'm here to tell you like brother Jean told you if demons can get their prayer answer what about the children of God [Applause] hey your prayer soon as you thought it God had already sent the answer your way because he loves you that much glory to God amen hallelujah amen amen Lord have mercy thank you Lord in that day we have all these Spirits that's being released and Jesus tells us this but but in the same time all this sin going on down in Sodom Gomorrah they got their two angels that come down brother brandom told us that two angels represented in this day the ministry of or Roberts and the ministry of Billy Graham went down into into the Moder day uh Sodom now back in them day you would have thought now now uh brother brand why would you say that because these brothers were preaching the gospel go into your average Pentecostal church today Andress your average denomination Church see how many gays are being welcomed in the church and you tell them if that's not Sodom and gomorra in the church well we can't put them out we got to love everybody I I'm not saying that but deal what they saying right this this this type of sermon that I'm preaching will never be preached in a church like that they avoid these topics and y'all know I'm telling the truth they avoid talking about this because they don't want to lose nobody I don't want to lose nobody either but I do want to lose that sin amen [Music] am you got what kind of spirit on you and you want to teach our Sunday school class no no no you want to be a youth leader [Music] no no no that ain't going to happen praise the Lord praise the Lord amen and it's okay to tell them no there's another church that probably love to have your services but not here amen we want to see you I mean complete and totally delivered amen glory to God Amen Hallelujah I don't lost my I I don't lost where I'm at but I what I am trying to tell you cuz there's something I want to read here for you but what I am trying to tell you is that while all that's going on in Sodom God was dealing with Abraham and there was there was a a visitor actually three visitors when they came to Abraham Abraham said my Lord when two visitors came to lot he said my my lords he had the wrong Revelation Abraham said my Lord and when when Abraham sees them they're sitting there they're having a conversation and um and it's the lord it's it's the Lord himself in a body of Flesh and he has his back to the tent and he says why is Sarah Laughing Now first there's a couple things that we need to understand how did he know Sarah's name right right cuz her name was Sarai but now it's Sarah and he pronounces it Sarah Abram was Abram but now he's Abraham right how did he know the name had changed only God can know that because God is the one that gave him the name change why where is Sarah wife she in the tent behind you why is she laughing how did he know she was laughing it was a discernment it was a discernment right and and and and and so that spirit of discernment that happened in the days of Abraham will be the spirit of discernment that we'll see today am amen now can I just read a quote I'm here now let me just read it let me just read it uh two two two two quotes and then I'm going to I'm I I I get out of here Discerning the body of the lord I want you to notice this is 1959 brother brandom preaches this and look at what happens here in in the in the service it says look at here there sits a little lady back here with a check looking dress on she's got her head bowed she's praying for her father he's got liver trouble you believe the Lord will heal Him Sister you believe it then you can have it lady you were awful kind to her to tell her that it was her so there's a lady sitting there said this you this you this you he calling you he calling your situation out and this lady's telling her cuz she about to miss it right he says you were you were awfully kind to tell her that it was her the reason you said that because the Holy Spirit moved right over to you too that's right you have a prayer card you don't you don't need one you're praying for a mother Discerning this lady in the audience both of them just Discerning what they praying for they don't have no prayer C never even told but he's picking up the Holy Spirit showing him what the people are there for it says um you're praying for for a mother and you're thinking on bringing her to church tomorrow night that's right look at this you don't have to do it oh my lay your hands on her and call the name of the Lord Jesus she'll get well if you'll believe it hall hallelujah amen hallelujah amen challenge your faith who else has not a prayer card and wants to believe you're sitting here in front you believe me to be God's Prophet a prophet is a messenger to an age do you believe I have God's message you do it I don't know you but God knows you if God Will Tell Me Your Troubles will you accept it as your healing believe that it is that it is his you can discern then that if your spirit can touch him now while I'm talking to you then you'll accept your healing will you it's your chest scar tissue and besides that you're a preacher that's right that is thus sayi the Lord believe God it says uh it says I'm going to turn my back my God my God deserving the Lord's body says believe God says I'm going to turn my back pray see if he's the same Angel see if it's the same God that promised when he had his back turned to the tent pra some of you that the Lord God sent his Angel and prove that Sodom was uh the end was at hand he says oh Lord God send your angel tonight and give the same discernment cuz it's a promise your son uh the promise of your son and let it be so amen now he's got his back turned it says a woman stands before me and She's suffering with uh a cat of the head she's back in this direction for I feel her pulling her faith her name is Miss Wy know her name how did he know sarai's name have been changed to Sarah when we see these same signs being manifested watch the chief sign yes sir her name is Miss Wy where's she at let's see back so when he says let's
