it's gonna take us a service or two to kind of feel comfortable in this space amen but nevertheless uh we trusted in jesus christ this morning it's good to see everybody we're gonna look in ephesians chapter two amen just remember the saints that's not here this morning and just continue to pray for me and my family and you know god is is in control doing doing great things amen um we want to start from the eighth verse and we'll read to the tenth verse it says for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus and to good works which god has before ordained that we should walk in them amen gracious father we just thank you this morning and uh we trusting in you we know the gift is the ability to get yourself out of the way and uh we just here to just yield the instrument to you trust in that lord god we could say something that'll be edifying and help us to look at the scriptures and just look at life in general from a different standpoint and uh we'd be so careful to give you praise glory and honor in jesus name amen amen may be seated uh we like to this morning by the grace of god i want to use as a little topic uh uh christ makes the difference and y'all just gonna have to bear with me for a few minutes uh we wanna maybe try to build uh brother jack made a little statement uh wednesday night and it just kind of brought me back to a a scripture there i know he's been working in the book of ephesians and uh on some series and i kind of try to stay behind him and not try to get ahead of him or any series or anything he always tell me bro go ahead go ahead just do your thing you know but uh uh it's just something he said it struck this scripture in ephesians chapter 2 and and also just a a story that the prophet of god he he begins to tell he tells a story uh and and maybe we'll read we don't i just let the lord use me uh i want to find it in because it's a few things that we want to say this morning to just uh uh help us all one of one of the things i've learned in life um just you know in the natural and even been since we've been a christian and uh you you know you have to appreciate growth and maturity because when when people are really shallow and and definitely before the new birth uh people are really carnal and just the way that they they approach things and the way that they just look at things we a lot of times we look at things from a carnal standpoint right the way that it looks the weight of this shape you know we try to identify oh she's she's uh if i could use it she's heavy all right or he's heavier he's he's this and and a lot of times we look at the outward appearance and and we we don't we don't really see the the real person we we look at the outside but we don't know the person right and the person is us all together different from the outside per individual the shell you know you you've never really seen me you just see my house my shell the building that i live in that you know we we dress up on on sunday and wednesday y'all just see that a lot of times but it's it's that is the thing that people uh try to make you you [Music] right right the outside the thing that we dress up and i like to dress up and i'm quite sure y'all like to dress up but that's not you because you you can dress this up and be a whole nother person outside of what you are on the outside i'm feeling something now so just the way that the way that we we approach things in the way that we look at things in the way that we process right is it's kind of i'll say it like this i'm not educated we got educated people in here i ain't one of those i'm not ignorant illiterate but you know y'all ain't gonna get no big words out of me [Laughter] you know i just kind of try to bring it right down where everybody's at you know one thing about the giraffe he has the ability to eat from up here and the ability to eat from down here so if you're a giraffe you're just gonna have to come on down here but i was gonna say jacked up a lot of times our views in the way that we look at things is really really jacked up right because we we we're not talk in uh in our early stages of life before before the new birth to really process things in the way that amen god would process things come on y'all you know we we get we get kids that's bullied on social media and and all the things that we hear this and it's all these things is because the people that's bullying uh uh look at things from a certain way and don't understand how to process how how to look at a person from the the eyes of god right through a thinking man's filter we preaching this morning right we we don't do it even even when we're converted and i'm going somewhere this morning even when we convert it a lot of times um we don't we don't we don't do it because we lack maturity and that's why sometimes you know these these messages has to be preached so that they could change the way that we we look at things the way that we we process things the way that we process and look at situations is that right i mean we we're all growing i'm not here to kind of you know belittle anybody or anything but but we're all growing we're all maturing in christ and i've been preaching for a good little minute and i'm still i'm still growing i'm still maturing right i'm still having to check myself in the way that i process and the way that i look at things and the way that i look at an individual the way that i look at somebody that falls in christ right because somebody make a mistake or somebody fall we we ready to crucify you know we we were able to kick a man when he died right you know we we sometimes we don't i don't think by the revelation we've learned how to pick folk up but the bible says we should but i think i think you know we we become clannish and and all you know we go through all of this stuff and and and we we we do more damage than we do good a lot of times right but but after this morning i i think it'll change some things for us and that's that's what we're here for right that's what brother jack is all about that's what these ministers is about we're trying to transform amen the way that we process and the way that we look at things and the way that we look at one the way we look at our children no matter what state i had to come to that as my children amen got older i'm going through all kinds of things you like with my children but i've grown to a place now that that i'm settled that no matter what they come at with me it don't it don't shake me all right amen you know it don't shake me they might think that old dad gonna hold you know this and that the other thing i'm like not me no not me i'm not gonna allow that to move for me i just realized that you know as as individuals we have to make our own choices now you say where would the world brother smiley go y'all keep on following me [Applause] now i ain't no helicopter i'm kind of a 747 all right so it take me a minute to get up and then it take me a minute to come down so i hope y'all ain't in a hurry what time we got to be out of here amen but you know you as as a parent you know because i had all these ideas when my kids were little when i could control them when i could give them that i in church and i could give them that eye and put my head you know i could control them but when i got to the place when they started getting older we realized that we can't control them we can't manipulate them with all of that they're at a place where amen they have to make their own choices and and here's the thing young people you live and die by the choices that you make especially especially when you grow up in a church like this and you sat under brother jack some of y'all have sat under me y'all without excuses that's right because one thing about it i believe we've tried to give you the word and we and we're still growing and we're still maturing we're still by by understanding learning how to process because now we got we got the mind of christ and there's there's a certain way that that we have got to look at things i was thinking about this this uh thought even yesterday and riding the last couple of days you know sometimes i just allow the holy spirit to bring inspiration and i and i started thinking about the book of genesis you know and just thinking about about uh uh god and just the way that god looks at things god looked at the thing that was created and when it was when it was without form and it was void and darkness covered the face of the deep god was not moved by that amen god what god wasn't moved by that the condition of the earth the darkness and the void and and all right god god looked beyond all of that right we talked about we talking about a supreme being all knowing right with attributes how to how to plan right fatherhood was in his mind and all of these different things right god had the ability to raise up and look at that thing and understand that amen amen this will be a part of my plan and god's beginning to speak yes and what what initially was dark and void became a uh a idiot right became an eden became a place where his his family could could dwell in harmony and unity and oneness and safety and prosperity come on no lack no division innocence perfection right you know god looked at the earth and said man i yeah that's that's temporary but when it's all said and done it'll bring forth this this great eden right and so i started even thinking and and just following that inspiration down through the scripture right with through through the prophets right through through through you know coming over into uh the new testament with with the apostle paul up under this um eagle anointing this teaching anointing right let me tell you something you you gotta look at things from the right place from the up under the right anointing is right you got to it's it's it's a must it's a must to be able to look at the thing paul teaching the the different churches the new testament church uh unveiling the mighty god uh under this eagle anointing was had the ability to look at things amen from a different space right even even when the the the jews was looking at the gentiles all funny right paul was able to look at the situation from a different space because of the anointing that he was under and and and bring this this thought of god down and express it to the people yes glory yes sir that right oh hallelujah and and i'm i'm a venture out a little bit y'all don't quit on me even even william branham right under this eagle anointing right was able to go up and catch the thoughts of god bring down the mind of god leaving brother jack i think i don't know if it was wednesday or sunday he he was talking about brother branham and brother branham crossing over and talking about talking you know to that voice and everything and and talking about paul and paul's group and you know across the uh um and and if paul grouper make it my group will make it because i preach what paul preached paul paul being being the writer of the majority of the new testament right right he could catch the plan of god the mind of god the program of god sees that god's thoughts don't change all right he unders he understands in his writings that that that you know god was rebuilding right right another masterpiece he wrote it he wrote it in scripture but then in the evening time right at the end of the day right god sends his mouthpiece to catch yes to catch the inspiration to catch the inspiration of the bible of what paul wrote in scripture right let me tell you something that's why you got to get in the spirit to hear and know you you got you got to get up under this eagle anointing because if you don't you're really you're going to really miss the bible we talk i'm not just talking about a man people like to try to get us focusing on a man and his failures man it ain't the man it's the it's the inspiration that the man taught up under that eagle anointing that was on the man the person to catch the revelation of the word and bring that thought down to the people right a more better plan to make the thing clearer to unveil this god before us is that right see this this is where people fail see brother branham brother branham was anointed as an eagle right up under this eagle anointing to catch things that everybody else wasn't gonna catch that's why he could preach the master piece identified masterpiece and all of these messages he elevated and understood by the word amen what god was doing praise god he could look because of this inspiration he could show you what paul was doing in this age this one was doing in that age but break down the history is that right of church history right he could do that not as a man but but because of his call and because of that anointing that prophetically and we must be under the right anointing we have got to be up under this eagle anointing in order to understand what's going on in this age right amen if you don't you miss it all right if you don't you miss it it's it becomes fanaticism it becomes it becomes this it becomes that it becomes you know while they preaching against denomination i ain't preaching against no denomination i just understand where they stand at according to scripture is that right whether people go on the hell that's between them and god see i'm i'm i'm i'ma strike something right quick uh names was written in the land book of life before the foundations of the world and that's what you got to see see if if god reveals to you your name on the book there you go i could go somewhere oh hallelujah all right you got to be able to see your name right not john jones army neville you got to be by revelation see your name on the book see come on [Music] see this is why that's people can't take anything from me is that right because i see i understand who i am i see myself i'm full of faults i'm full of faith not anytime i'm still growing too but one thing about it i can see myself in the scripture the word broke and i can see myself in the world we still going somewhere come on this ain't in my notes i'm just letting them use me right now right and and that's that's the thing church you know the the prophet the prophet and and this is why people could could call him fanatic and say well he's a man of god when the anointing is on him and he's discerning and he's healing but man his teaching lord have mercy they weren't in the same spirit they weren't under the same anointing so they couldn't see what he was seeing that's exactly right exactly i'm just gonna be real with you you gotta be there under that same anointing right under that same inspiration or you won't see evil i'm telling you the bible is alive this morning the bible is living this morning right church let me tell y'all something in a lot of instances we still on the surface of things there's so much in scripture right amen this right now being inspired 20 some years of preaching i'm still being inspired i'm still watching the word unfolding [Applause] we now can teach from a different perspective because the word is constantly open and the way that you know we might have looked at things and was a little bit more legalistic and you know didn't really you have no grace nowhere everything was bloody preachers came to the pulpit with a bloody sword right amen just killing the people sometimes we wonder why we ain't got no young people we didn't kill them all we even made we made it so so legalistic now i don't believe in compromise i believe in giving the word of god but i believe in operating under grace it is grace grace to serve the lord yes see we we we approach things and our views too as lay people they're so-called deep we approach things amen with a bloody sword we ready to kill people [Music] our views and the way that we look at things a lot of times right but you know paul had to look at things from a different perspective let's let's stop for a second let's look at paul in the way that he looked at things before the new birth he thought he knew something he thought he knew something didn't even know god didn't even know the word he had the letter he could read he was a smart man but he couldn't see the unfolding he couldn't see the progression of the word right because if he could have seen the plan of god unfolding he never would have persecuted the church right come on amen god had to knock the pride off of him right get him to a place where amen he looked up and and you know he realized boy i'm in a bad shape right because he was persecuting the very god that he was supposed to be worshipping by killing the church we do the same thing [Music] come on but then when he got the baptism out of the holy ghost right and really start operating a man uh in his position then that anoint and change things see watch this christ made the difference [Applause] and the way that in the way that he looked at things right and the way that he operate then he got to the place he'd say man all that all that i've learned i counted is done it's nothing boy it's like i can imagine paul saying boy i thought i was deep i thought i was a preacher man i got i got letters and everything else man i count all that nothing i don't what a state to be in the realize you don't know nothing most of us should be there cause most of us really don't know nothing come on i know y'all like to sit around message churches because the word has been opened and feeling we still don't know nothing because we still make messes [Applause] i'm starting to feel my help now right it's the truth paul didn't know until christ came into his life and made the difference right it's the truth christ made the difference in paul's life and in the way that he looked at things in the way that he perceived things right amen it just it it challenged him it brought him to a place where you know he was just willing to to just forsake all and die right see so that helps us when i look at even brother brandon's ministry right under this anointing he sees things from a different from a different standpoint he looks at things and this is why when people would criticize them all he wasn't moved by that because he realizes like i'm operating up on a different anointing right i'm up i'm operating on the prophetic anointing i see myself in the scriptures that was the thing with with mary while mary could go through what she went through in the age that she lived in right because she could see by the word john the baptist right they could identify themselves in scripture can we [Applause] right they're not being critical but this is the place that we got to be so that we're not moved when we when we're faced with with challenges i'm still going somewhere i ain't got that yet but i'm still going somewhere right that's the thing that that helps us so i'll stop here and then we'll try to get on track a little bit more you got to be able to uh operate under an eagle anointing amen right you you got to look through the eyes of faith through the eyes of a prophet right because of the word of the lord comes to a prophet that was the thing that he knelt down a man all the time in in his ministry the word comes to amend the prophet he said i ain't doing nothing except i reveal it to my servants that's just the order of god who can tell god what to do with his word none of us we didn't even know the plan of god not even adam listen listen how to get back to god right after he fell across the chasm boy he went to work trying to trying to put up uh uh uh and taking those fig leaves those leaves and sewing them together and putting them on and realized i'm in a mess [Applause] you you have to do something and realize this ain't gonna work [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you don't put all this effort into it and everything you realize man i don't work on this thing man for five hours this ain't gonna work you know adam worked on that thing put it on and everything here you gonna eat you know i got you what though and then you realize lord have mercy all out to put into this he come god i'm out of position i'm out of place man i got this this thing around me ain't none of this working i know what he gonna say he i guess he had a feeling at least i bet it took him a little minute y'all know what y'all got children they beat doing dead things and you'd be calling their name they hear you they hear you but they realize they be their maid they be they made such a mess then done something supposed to and you could be calling them calling and after a while yes ma'am they hey they had that they they had to feel sorry in their voice feel sorry for me because all them did somebody had no business doing teaching be to call home yes ma'am my god see they already know yes sir then they already know that this that crying ain't gonna work either that's right that's right okay okay now let us get it let's get on track right it's all right so so i said all of that so that you can understand where we're going at next right the the prophet of god he he begins to tell the story right of of of this this this auction right y'all ever heard the story yeah and and what what they what they were doing they they had this violence right they had this violin and and it was it was up for auction in the auctioneer hey listen to something here the auctioneer lacked the ability to express what was in the violin sarah there she go see now i'm the auctioneer and sarah is the master violin all right all right i'm going on i'm watching that thing tank right i'm watching the whole thing take this thing is worth probably countless thousands of dollars but i do not possess the ability to bring forth the expression of this violin i can't make it move i can't make it sing talk i can't make it do nothing and i'm sinking no matter how much these thing's actual worth is i don't possess the ability well we preaching now a lot of us are the auctioneer [Applause] we shouldn't be but i'm gonna keep going on that's all right y'all take that home with you right but he didn't the thing the thing the thing had value right the people that was auctioning watch this the way that they looked at the the instrument it was all it was it just didn't have much of an appeal right see colonel most often looking at the outside right god this thing it's just well i'm finna get y'all people listen people will give thousands and thousands of dollars to warn out michael jordans [Music] i'm done with real is money money that we could almost live off the rest of our life for a pair of raggedy michael jordan worn shoes right and then then things that really have you know real value right you know sometimes like our children and family members and things of that nature you know that we look at and we cast aside and all that child ain't gonna be nothing yeah it'll be nothing she's not gonna be nothing they ain't gonna that family y'all know what i'm talking about we we we put ourselves in categories uh this family but this this one and this that one and that's nonsense that that really is it's it's it you can't you can't look at things from that standpoint right i'm i'm still preaching i'm gonna help us this morning because we we do a lot of damage but it's the way that we look at things we look at things amen uh from a common uh standpoint naturally and things of that nature right and it just really shows that we're just the auctioneer right but but but thank thank god though thank god that there was a real master yeah there was somebody with real ability in in one of the quotes i uh paces i i have right here brother batman say he he was the creator of it he was the designer of the the the uh uh violin right right it was like he couldn't take it he stepped forth took the little thing and right why he had ability right he wasn't looking at the age how old it was sometimes the things that were made back then are more valuable than the things that are made now people people pay countless dollars for stuff that we look at and say oh that ain't nothing because we we like the understanding huh of its real value it kind of kind of reminds me of the story of the little boy who who who found a little stamp took that step to the man that man gave what 50 cent a dollar something like that i can't remember the price huh 15 cent or something like that and all he could see but the man who sold it to him huh he looked at the stamp with some understanding in real life but i got my little subs up i might have paid 15 cent but you know uh this thing is worth a little bit more and now brother banner makes the statement he said that thing worth thousand dollars down that's right that's right who's that that's right when i was growing up to be stamps meant to put on envelopes to mail letters nothing come on y'all with me not to save and put in this and that other and become rich off for no sometimes you know the way that people look at you know you look at art and and all of that they what they pay high for that see we don't see a lot of times the significance we we don't tap into the inspiration behind it yeah right because a lot of art collector you know i remember me and my wife we was over in europe we went to england and uh we went to the museum and we were seeing michelangelo and some of these great artists and you know stuff i'm looking at and and and they're like but if you could get out of here with one of these paintings you said huh i'm looking at that ugly thing see but you you here here's the thing you're not i'm not an art collector and and and the back story right the inspiration yeah i like brother branham telling stories to a lot of times for years and years and years i thought it was stories but you start growing you start preaching you realize from a story right a story has a message in it right i was even maybe last week one day um i was i was listening to a biography of this african girl um i forgot what country she was from uh she's a a pretty famous ballerina now right and and man when she was a little girl her her parents got killed over in africa do back in the day and thing and and and you know the village and the foster parents they call her child 27 something like that and and she had a a skin disease right around her neck so there could okay she heard a story skin disease and and the the people in the community used to call her the child of the devil my god how many times we didn't did that the child of the devil people would look at him because of a skin disease and that's all that they can could see they couldn't see a a man a past her physical features right and and and this this disease that caused her neck in this area to spot so so they put her down they they kind of starved her and they treated her right they couldn't see no value they couldn't see no value in and somebody that looks like this right child of the devil so the story goes on you know one day she was playing outside of the foster home and and uh this paper flew there and she grabbed it it was the picture of a ballerina on it on one of these magazines and she grabbed it and she helped onto it that was god come on brother come on that that was that was god ordering her steps that's right see her life was changing the the moment she got that that started her destiny when the people around all that could see was this child oh jacked up with all of this then lost her mom and dad and treating her like this and that and so uh this this american couple white couple um they were they were looking for you know the adopt they i think they had lost their children so they wanted to you know adopt and and uh so the people told him we got a girl they probably were saying they said we could we got somebody for you you know y'all know y'all know how people a lot people can be real crew right and so when the person the lady adopted her you know she couldn't speak english and the lady started asking what she wanted to do she ran and grabbed she ran and grabbed her paper she said this right she wanted to be a ballerina the the child that that the child that that that didn't look like nothing that people didn't want right that lady made the difference in her life see it changed things when she got adopted by somebody that could see her for more than than this thing around her neck huh somebody that was mature that could see her for more see that there's more for her to express and begin to put her put her in you know the right places you know ballet ballet and things of that nature now she's a worldwide ballerina right but people that lack lack vision that that that could only see the exterior with no ability a man to comprehend that you know what uh there's there's more to her than the outside right glory to god so this this this master of this violin when when people looked at this thing like this thing oh man why would i why would i invest my resources in something it just took the master right to make the difference when that man got finished brother branham said it wasn't a dry eye nowhere and what what was perceived as and looked at us all and nothing now was worth countless of dollars it became a bidding war a bit abandoned war for something that that you know one man presented right with no ability no ability he presented it just as numbers with the instrument [Music] new new it's real real worth its quality it's it's understand its ability to make music man cause caused the whole thing to just like go just oh my god right yeah right he made the difference right he made the difference that that that individual he made the difference right let let me read a couple of things and we'll keep moving i got a little bit of time y'all all right can i go home praise god amen see he says there was an auction there one time that he had no fill up there you heard it uh an old violin the auctioneer said when i'm uh what am i offered for it he said i may not have this just right he said according to the poem it's been many many years right he said they picked up the old fiddle didn't look very much didn't look very much looks crummy and everything how many times we'd have done that right child as a baby walking through you know you know schneider nose crusty dirty pampers on and you know from a household that man does open and countrified and you know we dignified so-called and all that then you find that that child grows up to be lawyer doctor huh and you all you gotta take that back you can't judge things like that amen we see i'm i'ma say this even before i get to it we we we bought a new birth we have the mind of christ right we we have the revelation of the word of god right wow this is empty come on y'all y'all don't win out the door on me huh right we we have the thoughts of god right the mind of god god sees things perfect see we have to change how we look at things especially in the economy of god even outside of the economy of god right right amen because if you look at a sinner like he's just a drunk he's just a bomb he's never going to be nothing he's never you'll never be able to help that person never ever ever ever ever ever ever right see god you know jesus didn't jesus did could y'all imagine the the woman at the well and i'm taste i believe i believe jesus sent the fellows away because he realized they ain't gonna be able to handle this [Music] huh they ain't gonna be able to handle this once they find out she a prostitute and all of that they ain't gonna be able to handle this look look at the master she's talking to ow lord what jesus doing y'all go to the city and buy some vitals y'all go buy some videos y'all the auctioneer see because all they could would be and even when they came back that's all they could see right jesus looked beyond the outside and saw that she was represented there was representation by predestination that's exactly right see christ made the difference huh he began to talk to him talk to him right find out a problem and all of that he made the difference right hey man what when she came from the present everything was different hallelujah right she didn't even see herself the way that she used to see you look at you look at think about listen church let me tell you something look at rahab the harlot come on ray y'all were ray hams too y'all are prostitutes too right look at look at rahab the harlot right joshua wouldn't have made the difference in her life right jesus a prostitute come on now how many of us will see a prostitute with a general do he know what he got do he know who she is watch how i'm glad god don't think like us right i'm telling you church i'm glad god don't think like us boy to think that you know what god's gonna use a prostitute to bring forth the sea lion to bring forth christ we never would have done it we never would have done it come on a prostitute all we can to see child please man everybody talk about her in the city that's why i got that oh my god i got rid of the city oh y'all gotta preach huh oh my god that's why god went in there and wiped out her path eradicated [Applause] so so he could elevate her and she never had to look and worry about looking back at somebody whispering because everybody in her house was grateful like brother jack was reaching everybody that a man that came under the token was grateful that she had enough faith amen to put this scholar color card outside of the house to stay the wrath of god they was grateful grateful grace and grateful great see when you're grateful you you know the grateful people they ain't criticizing to talk about this for getting a revelation of amen what a man would stay the wrath of because the whole city was worried one was no fight and no man even though they were big and everything they were no fighting them dudes huh amen god god sought to god you know i'm jesus i'm glad god saw more in me than i even saw in myself when i couldn't see where i was going when i didn't know who i i you know it's in this let me tell you something it's oh it's a it's it's an ongoing battle but it's the revelation of the word of god that's keeping me moving forward right man i'm telling you something with with some of the things that you know you you go through in life you'll be ready to give up you'll be you'll be ready you'll be ready to quit you people be traumatized by by life come on folk with money and everything give up quit i'm tired i'm done i'm finished i've had enough wow but christ makes the difference huh her whole status they had to call her missus mrs rahab sister mayhem all all right glory to god amen i'm still moving see all right i got my 15 man okay y'all still with me he said he couldn't even he he said they couldn't even get a bid on it finally i think he got a bit of a dollar something like that and there was one standing there that didn't think it ought to sell for that that was the master right when people criticizing us and this god be like uh it ain't what they say it is right he said there was one standing there that didn't even oh it ought to sell for that so he went picked it up and struck his hands and picked it up the bow and the resin on it and he played a tomb and when he did everyone started crying they never heard such music in their life then the auctioneer but it took a man with ability right i'm i'm still going oh my he said then the auctioneer he said two thousand five thousand ten thousand see what it was the master's hands reveal what was veiled in the old instrument see this is why i titled it christ makes the difference right it's it's in his hand yeah right when i look at my life i realize you know what where would i be if i wasn't in his hand come on i don't know if i would even be here today huh amen a couple other things right he said but remember just talking on the same same thing he said but remember there is something in the old book that promised that there would be a predestinated ordained hand to come one day amen you know what i thank god for that hand today right uh that would pick it up and make the word of this book through a predestinated heart to tag to the task that it's made for reveal the promises that's in it let me tell you something i appreciate god anointing a man amen because you know what growing up in church all i heard was jesus whoa the hair he rose from the dead on the third day jesus oh jesus everybody jumping up the motherboard and the deacons wake up from out of they sleep and slumber cause they know it's time to go when red went red ran back and rolled down and they hit they hear the the musicians and the drummer everybody come to life i'm gonna close i'm gonna close i'm gonna close you should have closed before you started [Applause] cause it was cause cause it was a close close-minded man preaching from a closed book [Applause] and see we preaching from an open book [Applause] to reveal what's been promised let me tell you something without that we wouldn't have faith for a rapture we wouldn't know who we were we wouldn't understand what the nature and the character of god is what god likes and what god don't like come on church it's so much that's in the word of god see amen so they might they might look and say oh a bunch of holy rollers or something in that order but just takes the master's hands the word on it to reveal that word thank god for the master huh thank god for the master oh let me tell you something don't expect me to look at the bible amen the way that maybe y'all even look at the bible because i hate y'all come on cuz i'm in his hand right i'm in his hands right people want to dumb you down no don't dumb me down you got to come up come on your understanding's got to come up i'm not coming down for people is that right no sir no sir if in your understanding you lack scriptural basis i'm not coming down maybe to help pick you up because amen of the anointing of the master right amen but but for me to say well you know i ain't doing that i ain't doing that i ain't doing that ain't doing that i'm doing that i'm just gonna thank god for what what he's revealed to me and pray that god reveals to you what he's revealed to me because he ain't no respected person to drop my understanding right and follow fault i ain't doing it don't expect me to do it that's right is that right i ain't genesis adam y'all missed that huh glory to god it's christ in bright form i ain't that adam i'm following the word man should not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of mouth with god right that's right amen if you like understanding amen just ask god who gives to us right come on i'm almost there i'm going to close in a minute glory to god amen say okay i'm finished with that two or three more things and i i'm gonna go i just wanted to see it it makes it makes to do he said you could stroke he said a word from it he said uh lord like the old violence did uh to the violence make it so lord make it play the right tomb amen right bow in the master's hands then we'll see him standing in full view how these people must have thought that day when they wouldn't give nothing they wouldn't even give nothing right didn't give nothing for the old vine they didn't want it they wouldn't have it in their house but once picked up by the one who could master it amen then they sold everything that they had that that's the difference right once it's picked up by the right he says the old master of the violin had revealed its true quality right christ is here the master to reveal our true quality yes sir right come on when people look at you look at them with that blind skirt song do y'all ever wear pants no we cry it's christ here revealing what he likes what he don't like right revealing through us his true quality right amen he said oh oh brother sister now let the the master of this world who wrote it it's the holy spirit rosen rising up his bow with love and pull it across your hearts there he there he there is a fountain filled with blood drawn from emmanuel's vein he says you'll see the full value and see the unveiled god come right into view see he said what was what was the difference the master right christ is the difference he said he's the one who knew it the one who built it he knowed how to get out of it what was in it christ christ knows how to get out of us what's in us right christ he says now and and when god has has borne you a new by the holy spirit right he can only look upon you as a perfect work you say why why would you read something like that brother smiley right this is what we got to understand we look at things one way god looks at things another way we see faults and failures and immaturity god don't see that god god god's taking the word and working cause we're his workmanship right glory to god glory to god oh just help us this morning let's let's look at things through the eyes of faith right and and understand amen it's christ in us the hope of glory then if it's christ christ sees a perfect work yeah right come on y'all getting quiet on me i guess it's my time to go huh come on church christ sees a perfect work christ don't see well god my husband stop praying about your husband and pray about yourself well if if you change him no first you change you let god change you god works on both ends come on now because church we think more highly of ourselves sometimes than we ought to that's right amen we like they used to say i know they probably got loose saying we think we all add in a bag of chips and all that kind of stuff i remember they used to say that corny little saying but right but we think more highly of ourselves than we ought to sometimes right and god be looking at you like boy if you ever see it like brother branham did in that in that that story that day he thought he would sow something huh preaching all over the world and walking there with his nose tooted up ready to condemn them to hell god say uh mister come around this corner around his corner we need to talk we need to have a conference when he came from back from around that corner he was a different man he realized boy i'm just as bad as that he is huh glory to god amen amen but he says uh let the musicians make the way he said he cannot condemn you for ye are his workmanship amen he said oh my i feel like shouting like a methodist think of it you are god's workmanship he did it by his sovereign grace not because you jumped not because you went to church not because you turned a new page but because god by his mercies brought you into christ and the fellowship and looks upon you as a perfect work of his own see he looks different than we look why i brought him i present him into the blood and there's nothing wrong with my work huh see you you cannot criticize a person right amen because you got this is what we got to realize church it's god's work it ain't even it's not even my work it's god working and i'm chasing my pastor for 23 years and boy you get frustrated and all of that why i'll be sitting back there looking at listening to run zach and and and i'll be saying if nobody don't understand what he's going through i sure do i understand i've been there done that right but but we we we we grow to a place to where we realize you know what man i better go home and lay down and go to sleep cause it's it's it's the work of god come on it's a perfect work it's his work it's perfect no matter how they look right now amen the work is perfect huh no matter what position your children are in they backslid they ain't in church they drinking they doing this the work is perfect right the work is perfect the work i ain't finished yet but the work is perfect that'll help us brother jack you know you know the work is perfect god is working right i mean we that's a human element we get frustrated you're getting frustrated that's the human element yes right but that part we just gotta yield to god you to god yield to the revelation of the word of god is that right workmanship we his workmanship the work is perfect amen and that's that's that's the way that we gotta look at the church when we're ministering the church i see a perfect church you just got cussed out by a church member the work is perfect folk that won't [Music] give me some music amen amen amen i i ain't gonna i got too much to read you love him this morning i'll tell you what christ makes the difference you know p people we we've made a mistake we've tried to get people to brother branham we tried to get them the great preachers and all of that man this is why we fail you get the people to jesus christ by the revelation of the word of god bring them into this union this oneness with god he makes the difference in people's lives that's it that's it see now i preach laugh with y'all a minute get in my car go home don't have no problems going to sleep i had to learn that because i was stressing myself out right but i learned something i learned something my job is to yield my vessel to the to the holy spirit preach what god places on my heart and god gonna take care of the rest is that right amen amen amen amen let us stand let's get a lot of hannah praises brother jack come this morning [Music] [Music] like me oh i once was over now i'm found let's sing it again amazing grace in grace how sweet the sound [Music] like me [Music] was blind but now i see praise god praise god [Music] [Applause] praise god [Music] [Applause] well [Music] praise god [Music] praise god praise god hallelujah [Applause] christ makes the difference um i must say i was thoroughly enjoying brother smiley amen the thought that the lord gave him to give to us just a wonderful wonderful thought just so much that he said that uh that i was feeding on but um he walked right into a teaching that i did this morning on the eight o'clock call that i'm a part of and and um i was just making some statements about uh how you know god used brother brandman's ministry was very specific and it was just as specific as noah to build an ark just as specific as moses to bring the people out of egypt right just as specific as john the baptist introducing christ the first time and god could have used anybody it didn't have to be moses it could have been a guy by the name of joe but he chose moses and it knows that he could have chose um you know noel but he chose noah right and uh and this day he brought brother branham for a very specific purpose and that's to bring the word of god to us that's all his job was is to bring the word of god to us and now we're fellowshipping around this word and just just when you think about how you talked about that old violin and um i mean you you look at it everybody thought there was no value to it our lives were the same way people thought there was no value to us but look at us when god gets a hold of us christ makes the difference when god gets a hold of us then there's value in everything that's done i'm so glad he got a hold of me i'm so glad i i just i just thank god and just just just a wonderful wonderful thought i'm leaving here knowing that i've been to church amen and i heard from god i got strength to carry me through the week you know amen i just appreciate the lord jesus so let's continue to keep our precious brother in prayer amen that the lord will just continue to inspire him and uh that he'll keep continuing to speak through him um we'll prepare uh to to just have a closing word of prayer and um um i know that for some of the brothers we just have to turn the room around a little bit amen for them to use for the for this week so if you don't mind just helping us out we greatly appreciate that one of the things that um we were talking about this yesterday i heard the family talking about at home uh we we know this is temporary what we're doing because you know we're at church that we love the fellowship most of y'all go to churches and y'all are the last ones to leave all the other saints done left that church they didn't go home and y'all still in their parking lot fellowshipping and that that's just who we are right we we love our brother branham talked about um uh it talked to one brother saying how do you get the people to just do that like they just love each other they love being in each other's presence they love fellowship with one another and uh you know just that's something that god does that's nothing that a preacher does right so so you know i i i i know that sometimes when the time constraints i feel like we got to break our fellowship and i just can't wait to see what god get ready to do so that we don't have to lose that amen so you know we want to go ahead and do what we have
