grateful so grateful the announcements are we want to wish our sister Blanche a happy birthday home on Tuesday the fifth a man should be celebrating the birthday sister Blanche Gipson giving her another year and as we continue to work with our government through this kovat a man 19 pandemic that we are we want to continue just to kind of do our services the way we have been doing them we'll

quick update on our building fund a man and where we where we are praise the Lord as you can see there a man what we just said as a goal a man for to raise this year was 105 thousand what we have pledged on that goal was sixty thousand nine dollars and what we have received here today has been to a thousand seven hundred and seventy dollars a man and nine cents last but just last month we received two thousand nine hundred ninety one dollars and seventy two cents so I'm just grateful about $3,000 they made $9 shorter $3,000 for last month and you know in a time where this supposed to be a pandemic God is still blessing it's right God is still moving amen in the midst of all of that so we think God for that and with the money that we have in the bank and we've accumulated $265 and 15 cent of interests and again that's positive in the midst of this which gives us a total of 13,000 $35 at 24 cent and and we have not touched our for nothing no transfers not used we're not robbing Peter to pay Paul and I'm grateful for that because you know I told you for the past couple years we you know we have a hefty amount of rent that we have to pay here for this place and all the times when people ask me they say you know brother Jack want to just find somewhere else it's much it'll be much cheaper I say this is Palm Beach County everywhere you go gonna be like this and you know and and and I say so that's just what it is but the same God that can provide 300 dollars can provide $3,000 right so whatever I need is God I will provide and he has proven that over and over again so I told y'all we were you know sometimes we were struggling and try to get the rent together we always paid but sometimes it was late once again goddess did it where we can write a check on the first week of the month take it and drop it off and you know I'm grateful for that because you know there's a lot of churches can't do that a lot of churches closed them down even right now he didn't have enough to sustain that but God is keeping us open please we've got to praise the Lord it's keeping our so God is in it and I know that the other thing that God has with this money that's been put away

we'll get right into Lord Jesus father were here again Lord on the merits of your grace more glowing knowing that we don't deserve the good that you've given us father but your elective love Lourdes is proving us Lord is shaping us and molding us into the image of your mind and all we just thank you Father for choosing us Lord and calling us out of darkness Lord and placing our feet on solid ground and all we pray today that you just bless the service Lord and father you allow me to get out of the way loud hear it I get out of the way father did you can find a resting place and that he can bring forth fruit 6200 fold and although we know that the word he shall not come and shall not return until you thought but it shall accomplish so like that what you purposed in bless this church Lord in the past in different ministries with the name of Jesus Christ we pray and we thank you Lord that turns amen amen we have your Bibles let's go to Isaiah you know I just I love that song but I just wanted to get into the word you know I had I said now I'm gonna let it go away man hallelujah Isaiah 55 and then we will go to Luke 7 and and as we read this you know I gotta say this morning we want to snatch all the power away from coronavirus we want to put all of it back in God amen so no matter what you're going through let's put that in the scripture right I was at 55 let's start reading that uh verse 6 the Bible says seek ye the Lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near then the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon him and to our God for he will abundantly pardon now if we wonder why God let this verse go forth he's telling the wicked to return he's telling them they'll be pardoned call upon his name and now he's gonna address us who's already here he says for my thoughts are higher than your thoughts you know sometimes we believe people can't come back after they sinned we believe what they've done you know they don't reserve the grace of God but he says he says for my socks are not your thoughts neither are my ways and you know your ways my ways saith the lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my salts then you're a salt he may keep that in mind let's go to Luke the seventh chapter we serve a merciful God Luke seven and just to make the reading short let's go to verse 37 I'm just back up let's go to 36 and one of the Pharisees Luke 39 and 36 and one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him and he went into the Pharisees house and sat down to meat and behold a woman in a city which was a sinner when she knew that Jesus said and meet in the Pharisees house bought an alabaster box of ointment and stood at his feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet with with tears and did wipe them with the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment now when the Pharisees which had bidden him solid he spake within him saying this man if he were a prophet would have known who and what manner of woman this is that touching them for she is a sinner a man order bless reading of his words you can have your seats today amen do you know this service I want to challenge you amen you know my subject today is control your thoughts control your thoughts you know and we know that the Prophet he preached a message greater battle in the mind so you have the power to control your thoughts but one thing I want to make really plain you know we said the greatest battle ever fought is in the mind that doesn't mean your mind belongs to God remember he said battle that means God and the devil all God also wants your mind we also said well God wants your heart no he wants your mind - he wants to covet your thinking he wants you to think like him so don't just say well you know the battleground is a mouth it's a battleground that mean God wants your thoughts he wants your mind also you know so don't just settle for any kind of thing that comes to your mind no control your thoughts look right here in the Bible God says his thoughts are not our thoughts his ways are not our ways and then he started to give it an example of you know how high the heavens are and he's tall so it's saying up into the heavens a man and sometimes things take place and we just can't understand it that's because God stars I hide in your thoughts hallelujah and you know what I love about God he challenges us to believe amen so I say in this hour in this time amen gather your thoughts and gather them to believe in the Great God we know here in the Book of Luke where Jesus was invited to the Pharisees house right and you know most of the religious people came out but there was a similar I heard about Jesus being invited to their house now let's go get her salt process she wasn't invited she wasn't looked upon to be a Christian but I need to stop her from thinking she could be saved that day hurry you know she was known to be a prostitute but that didn't stop her from thinking she could be saying hallelujah she didn't even have any conversational interaction with Jesus but that didn't stop her from thinking today oh yeah that was a mindset she she controls her sauce against her testimony of prostitution oh yeah she control assaults against what was going on in the household a gift so reputation against what everybody else thought about her and she said I'm going to see Jesus what about you Church we have to control our sauce because in your sauce that last you power huh I want to read a quote to you man let's listen yes let's start out of wisdom verses Fame hallelujah wisdom versus faith look listen what the Prophet said he said the word was in gone it was gone it was his thoughts that was with him always now the word that we read the word that we do it was in Gaza and was God it was his daughter Leah now we say we believe that we are the word amen so that means I was in go that means I was with God that means that I am God I was in yourself so that means I don't know what you think about yourself but if you thought of God God said you are eternal let's get you thinking right a man he says Amen he said that a skim milk touch that a 2% get a one daddy got no hormones in it that's her straight milk you know straight milk don't need no assistance there's just a certain time where the birth take for milk is automatically they say that any skim milk brother see here here we go that means he's enjoying it how many of us come to church and we enjoy you see Church we enjoy hearing the word because we're hearing about ourselves Lissie say here it is here he comes he said God's thoughts was his word in the beginning that's in eternity now listen church Harlan if we come from God we was in God his thoughts were in were in that's not you I don't ever use in this place because how you think ago then we come from eternity in the mind of God think about that Church hallelujah like like like like like all the tough kids in here they know that there are Duff nobody can change that you see them you see the father that's what God is saying to us God is saying you come from me you go back to me honey like we said this morning we are experiencing the blessings of : 90 [Applause] brother how can you be blessed because times like this hallelujah the word is being fulfilled [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] I want to see you where is it coming from where's that desire coming from you were one that's why Jesus out come from God I go back to God amen see we control our thoughts he made a feel hunger in for God where's that hunger coming from hey man you hunger after the things you've already tasted hallelujah Garre so Church for us too we have to control ourselves a man he says and the word was with god and the word was god his dolls oh yeah is what he is oh my this doll is what he was listen church honey he says his dolls is what he was that's you too so if we are God's dolls honey if his boss is what he was when you see me you see God you see the thoughts of God revealed huh come on come on I want to challenge you let's stop walking around here like we just ordinary people see the greatest mistake that the Pharisees me they thought he was God huh they thought he was a man trying to make himself God they had it twisted he was God himself a man became God no so what what you do i we have a phone we have two two lines and we have two nimble's they say what's the primary number oh Jesus his primary world he was gone first see he wasn't me if you call him call him as God first did you check for your mess of man let's control your thoughts and you know church amen we sometimes our mind is what gives place to a lot of different things brother give me that first picture hallelujah I want to show you what happened to me I want to say what happened to me the last time I went to Canada if we got it honey oh we can get a man this is what happened to me the last time I went to Canada now control your thoughts because you know they say a picture's worth a thousand words that's me that is me and I do have on the chair soup and that's a jailhouse behind me and you say well a brother got locked up I don't know what brother digs deep but they got him this time you know cuz I seen the picture pictures worth a thousand words well that's correct what good is a picture being worth a thousand words if you don't have the right country no doubt that's a chance no doubt that's a jailhouse no doubt I'm in shackles but what's my story she and with yourselves you can project your own picture you can protect your own content but what good is your pocket if you have to that's why I say come to this message stay with the content and you know the thing about earlier our mind control your thoughts now because you may be you might not know me you like Jack game up there preaching and clear his data's brother than been to jail clearance dating I heard he was going through something but I knew a guy that bad control your thoughts you know there's a lot that goes with a picture in a thousand words in the way we think cuz you say yeah I saw the picture the brother the brother was in a jail suit he was locked up he had to be locked up he had to do something wrong so you mean to tell me everybody that's in jail did some room because they did some role but God never did so every picture of the know the right content you know this picture is here so you can most of y'all know me from church but how many I really know me so if you really don't know me your mind can project Oh countless scenarios well I mean I am by two years I wonder what's up I know why brother Jack ain't been inviting them brother didn't been to jail all alone that's what your mind your mind I project his own outcome and you know Church just look at this picture and I said control yourselves you know if you got a problem with me your salts are gonna be evil as soon as you see that picture if I forgot to shake your hand you know told you nasty I told you I told you see you're projecting something without the right content but you're projecting it based upon how you feel you know maybe one day I last about here I was preaching and I stepped on your toes uh-huh see I told you I told you there was something up to him I just felt funny in my spirit when he came around when he came around it was just something funny in my spirit without even knowing the content you project all these things where's it coming from your mind it's coming from your mind and you you made up your own scenarios you didn't make me a criminal and this could have been an example of a scared straight moving something and it chose me to be the star but because you got a problem with me every thought you have is something negative and we do that all the time with one another people go through trials that are a Dane of God and the first thing we do is think something negative but the trial is our Dean of God so God if God is doing it that mean is something positive this morning Jacob and all the things that he did and he was and all the things that happened but it was God putting him in position oh yeah so you have to control your thoughts when we think about one another hey man you know that maybe in a time way you tried to talk to me and it looked like I shun you yeah he deserved to be in jail he deserves to be in jail control your thoughts Church look let's go to the coating demonology you can pull that one down brother we all come back to that Oh sister I'm sorry I'm sorry mrs. King see Jack had to do that because the enemy might have got in your thoughts why you keep calling me no man I ain't no man I'm gonna mess up the whole picture he see me back he know who I am see God knows how he said the world is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart before God desert [Applause] look search we make things what they are listen listen what the prophet of God says he says but now what stars - sees what's darker or vows what started where did it come from hallelujah where did it come from listen what he says he says now becomes a disease even exist until you accept the Spirit in your body because your mind is [Applause] yo y'all know me I got a shock you real quick hug ain't no power than that man you in how about you thinking put this on and it'll stop me from catching Corona that's what you believe in your mind but Corona is just as powerless with myself saying I'm under the blood without a mask I'm trying to tell you what to do I'm just saying you are only as powerful as your thinking oh yeah he says it becomes Harlan it's a spirit first before it becomes a disease let's think about that hallelujah how do we accept the spirit you know some mornings you make it up I think I'm coming down with something see in your mind you'll get ready to accept sickness the prophet of God said we'll get to it a little bit later he said the mind is the gateway to the soul if you receive it up here huh your mind will make it coming to make it come into existence let me tell you something to be a millionaire you have to have meat and sauce don't wake up and say I'm gonna make $20 today no you do that when you work at Burger King but me that says hey I'm gonna make thousand today hundreds or even means that's his mindset he's my a millionaire has millionaire salts and we ask the Bride of Christ we should have eternal holy assaults but in your church before it becomes a disease you have to accept it as a spirit and you know you can be coughing like was it my tote does something as simple as dust oh maybe something a little bit of saliva went down the wrong way honey but you you make it a cool when you say I think I'm coming down with a cold because you begin to invite the spirit in in another form because it starts off just in your mind hallelujah but as you begin to accept it like you know cuz sometimes um we we get sick but we put the name on it hallelujah we put the name on it when we get sick sometimes oh man I think I got the flu growing the flu gonna come cuz you called it holy remember Jesus identified the spirit by name we met up with Lisa he said what is your name she acts the demon to identify itself earlier so a lot of times they man things happen in our life things take place because of our thinking process oh yeah so I challenge you control yourself see me cancer has no power over you until you accept it as a spirit first remember it was just as powerful as Adam until she receive another man Stahl's remember the proper God said the actions star of the first scene you consume little earlier Eve had to accept the source of the serpent adultery since she became an adulterous you see the poor your thoughts make it ape when you receive the thoughts of it you make it plural you give it life amen and search as we can see listen I got go to go to the hostel next the next uh quote in Jesus Christ the same you know you wonder why Paul what makes tables like I can do all the things that Christ that stretches me that was the place he lived in he lives in a place that he believed God could do anything because of what he saw God do now I wonder how many of us have seen God do great things so listen have negative thoughts when it comes to what we need we should always reflect back to what God is already you know we talked about controlling and all these things and and on what's taking place let's just friend them if I go back to the picture Holly you know a place where I work out that you had a couple trainers and different people that go huh now we're dealing with control your thoughts you know I wish I took that same pitch I just show job and I show to the trainers and I show one one other lady that works out here with me honey so I show one of the trainers who don't really know me that because he just see me and they're working everybody called me rail I show them the pitch I say what stick money see where look like they got you like you messed up red look like you done based off of the picture and him not really knowing me all he could do is judge it by what he saw and a little lady know me so to him I could be guilty of going to jail in the same place I showed it to my trainer hallelujah he pull it back up funny brother sister I'm sorry he looked at the picture and he stopped to examine he said they let you weigh that they let you have the head hold and that certain almost they let you put what was he doing he was he was examined by the sauce but he hadn't been to jail before so he was examined by his own experience that works out in in we have had extensive conversations about God the goodness of God the greatest of God she's totally obsessed I told my testimony I show her pictures I don't believe it much contact with me as you guys but just simple conversations here in their house we get to connect around the world the question when it comes to what kind of sauce comes our mind when we thinking about our sister brother first moves you got a problem with me I showed the same pitch in my church and a sister came up to me she said birdies all I can think about was you was I did preaching and he finally got you I said something that wasn't evil that was a credit to Who I am but he looked at the picture you say see I told you it wasn't something right about him told you you know some of us we got issues with one another okay and we won't say that but in our spirit when you saw that picture you said nah that's the worse already [Music] mmm-hmm without the right content come on Jesus Christ the same I want you to understand when the prophet of God says there's enough power in here to create a world and go live on Harleys that starts up here that starts in your mind hallelujah you have the power to create the lifestyle you want to live honey you have the power to accept or reject the things of God because God is a lover you ain't gonna make us do anything hallelujah it's up to you to receive him in him but listen Jesus Christ the same he says now he says but what a man will do he will hear a little something and keep moving his papers now you talk about a man bouncing from church to church honey you hear something good over here here move over there yes I'm good over there you move over there see he's being carried away by I stimulated his mind is he's not catching it in his spirit hugs a lot of times people follow ministries that make them feel good you don't feel good so don't mean your pastor's not cold he says well now you never find Christ moving your people see God I don't do a thing Oh God God God is in the business of letting you make up your mind think about that church honey he could easily force us to believe in him but he don't God stands by how you make up your mind but you know hallelujah I learned something church over the past couple two years that I don't always need to voice my opinion on situations you know my oldest girl she sees she's getting married and she's she had to keep postponing because of this Karuna thing but you know the guys she chose didn't know nothing about this word he didn't know anything about the prophet of the hour you know wasn't even a Christian person and y'all know what I was the fool I said going down like this [Music] I told Jasmine I told her that cuz I'm judging a book by it's cover I'm looking at this young man and I'm saying he ain't worthy I don't know in the body sometimes God I do that you don't know nothing about the situation but what he has to do is bring out those hidden things inside of you that you don't know there I asked some hidden anger inside of me I had to bring out I had some hidden things inside of me that I wouldn't I wouldn't normally agree with that God had to bring out in that moment she was introducing the young man and all the stuff if y'all would have saw me y'all be like that can't be brother team that can't be brothers Karen he belongs in jail but you know Church in that moment oh yeah you know I never like I don't care she said well he wanna go to Bible study I say well pastor cuz you know I felt like they were trying to get over me see I didn't projected my own stuff in my mind you know what God did saw God came to me and gave me a new ministry he gave me a new minister Rachel that I kind of went really far but you know this ministry is so powerful so powerful it showed me a supernatural way and God does things and I think all of you can get into this ministry and I know y'all kind of wonder what is his brother tell it what is it tell us this ministry is called to set your Mountain ministry [Applause] [Applause] shut your mouth just bill daddy but think about God God I challenge your thoughts and gotta go overboard here make the picture real be and it comes to me he's talking to me in this before all this moment before he's giving me the shits in my ministry he says look here she's dope she don't need your permission to get married so you leave this house and go get married tomorrow he said now would you rather it go down like that and you not be a part of her life or would you rather shut your out and be a friend and let me so I listen to God and I shake my mouth oh boy that thing was hard boy that thing was hard because we have the revelation of the word we're looking at things to this and we're like lord I want my daughter with us and I won't have Dustin that according to the scripture remember you can't see what God can see ya young man come to me hungry who's better the mess is going to a good church see ya Brody I wanna coach it on God's ways are not Hoey's I ain't giving nobody no excuse to go wrong why my brother I don't need you with me shut your mouth no that ain't what I'm saying that's a line devil in your thoughts the Bible says honor thy mother and father control yourselves and a lot of times we try to take the word and make it what we desire sometimes become your heart's desire and you might marry a rebel but you're gonna get your heart's desire I didn't told you know I didn't told you no Balogh but since your wound is so bad go ahead and on the way you're getting what you want I'm a kid he told Balaam no two to three times and God got to the point he saw it was in baylin's heart she had become a disease 9 it's a disease huh it went from a spirit hug him just think about old man I can be rich I can get design get dad now he's been overcome by honey he's produced lights in his room he want it so bad he can't stop so you know what he does he keeps coming to God keep like what God say no God ain't made no mistake he know what he's saying no for sometimes we come back to God with the same thing like Garlin mean what he said that's our thinking the baby comes back come back God says go ahead go ahead and do it did God change his mind no but God knew Baylor was gonna be so hard-headed he wasn't gonna stop to keep that thing he got that thing is almost died getting it but you know church when it got to those two I was like hello you owe me my mouth my mouth you know I see them get out help me Lord you know but what happened Church when I became a friend to the situation Ilia then the spirit change Ilia when I went from dad to dad and free and how do you meet a Jasmine like this now has become my dream something else I get giddy sometimes coz were you thinking God is not in control he is yesterday Sunday that Monday he takes me he said hey how can I get all the brother branham's messages [Music] [Applause] not the way that God have it the church and I can see that everything I would have desired in this moment for my daughter God is doing it so I'm just giving God praise but searching the midst of it all before he even before they even got engaged hallelujah this young man met up with me I know I'm telling a business but it's alright it ain't no secret they finna do thing you know but Church she met up with me he say how you say bye through you we know each other by three years I say in three years you know that's the only ones being arrested in light-weight he's looking straight at me and saying yes sir mmm-hmm see my mind I'm still like God had told me to shut up but I still got some tonight I'm still trying to control the situation people do they try to control the situation they look at you a certain way so you hurry up and close let me tell you something that don't stop a preacher that energizes a preacher because we want to see you saying so we keep preaching hoping something going clean and you set your watch to a certain time I guarantee you angle here hallelujah but you know Church we sitting in the car he's telling me all these things you wanna do and marry a man you show I'm in denial I got my own thoughts I say you sure you like yes sir I'm sure he says but I ain't gonna do nothing unless I got your blessing Church right there I was like bloody all my fight was gone because God was showing me day he's not who I think he is hallelujah he says just tell me what you expect out of me what can I do to get your blessing I told him what I expect he says thank you because we always hear Harley get the father's approval get the father's approval but we don't know what his approval is now that's mommy but first godhead - give me - shut your mouth minister you know a lot of times we need to practice that in church you can see a brother the sister on the side of the church talking about something in your mind either working mmm you seen a see Mary mmm why you have those kind of thoughts first about your system brother how you noting switching up prayer requests you know this covert 19 pandemic make the Bloodhound stalker there's all kind of stuff idea in the blood I'll give you but we have to control our church when we go back to the scripture hey man look at these me and honey just warming huh who I gonna be too much longer long back because this woman who's who has a reputation of a prostitute some kind of way she hears that Jesus is going to the Pharisees house they didn't run in the same circles so God must have made away father here that Jesus was near and no doubt she knew his reputation because she had a desire to see him hallelujah so you know what she does in her mind her mind that dates you like I'm getting seen again so what she did last night last night she probably was a prostitute honey but today she had different thoughts in church she goes and buys an alabaster box probably use a prostitute money [Applause] you know criticism [Music] she comes from behind she pulled on him and she the glory it was in his control same thing with a woman at the well everybody's looking at her because of reputation but Jesus say he must needs go by healing everybody had particular thoughts about her but when it came to God he had thoughts of peace and not of evil what goes through your mind when you're going through things is it why me you should say why not me why not me why why wouldn't you want to be purged by the Almighty God why wouldn't you want to be tried by this unleavened bread the womb the gateway to the soul you remember now there is a worm with a physical there is a womb of the Spirit did you believe that there is a spiritual man if the mind is the wound to the spirit you accept these things in by the way you think now I bring something real simple that we've always talked about we say we're the prophets say ah if somebody deliver you a bag around snakes the box around snake you wouldn't accept it can I get any man how many of us will go down to the swamp and get you a Python none of us cuz in your mind that'll do you harm so you ain't gonna accept so why will we accept these spiritual demons demons of depression demons of hatred Envy oh yeah demons of all these things huh that'll create a spiritual disease in your life first that comes by believing Satan's lie hurry into your womb of your mind that polluted her soul talking about her her receiving the thoughts of the enemy polluted her soul and that's the only way that a woman ever can commit adultery against a husband is to firstly some man talk her into it so before you did it you had several conversations you talked to me told you I like you had a day of those women a breeze I like I just like the way you wait at least friend you know he's just talk to you ain't getting your spirit have you smiling and all these things and you forget you marry where we had somebody on the job talking stop talking going about your business because all it is is a serpent trying to win you over to take you farther than you want to go look I like to say this I like to say this and I want to make this real clear to our virtual assistants who may be single these young men are looking at you and they like man I wish I had a you're a prize they're looking at you but they're not looking at you with the intent of a lifetime they're looking at you at the 10th for the experience so don't sell yourself short no they're plenty guys that would desire to have you but you want the right one cuz one of these slickers and the britches down and all the stuff they pop up tees are you a Christian I'm a Christian too until they get what they want and then they don't know you they wanna Dave his boy did his sister like he could desire desire desire desire desire and then when his desire may he said I hate you like I always say Church holy in your mind you should always sisters just always want to be hunt it make him go out there hunt make him go through all the channels make him stand out in the cold make him get bit by mosquitoes huh he's supposed to hunt hallelujah let him put his camouflage on honey let him see it ain't gonna be easy huh cuz I got little brothers who hunt brilliant friends that hunt and ain't none of them so I never told me a big buck jumped outta here shoot me b-boy No kinda hurtful I gotta put cameras up you got to put feed out do all that stuff you gotta conquer your fears go up in a tree stay sit up there for a little while and you gotta be quiet got to be still Ilia got to be still and know that he's got I'll you can't just see something pretty scenario write it away he said the enemy polluted also and said death it is so then the nature the natural acting place see there's certain things holding it when you receive it in your mind your body's automatically going to go through the actions for clothes gonna read you a story that's the story many years ago everybody all right there's a story many years ago there's a man who used to travel by train hopping he was hot from train to train but there's one time he jumped in a train a boxcar and he got locked in and he was supposed to be a frigerator freezer car this I'm gonna read you the story as many years ago a man was traveling across country by sneaking from from one freight train to the next first first of all he was wrong he was supposed to be sneaking from trainer train he says one night he climbed and he climbed into what he thought was a bus car when his eyes adjusted to the light he realized he was inside a refrigerator freezer boxcar he was in a freezer now can't you imagine what's going through his mind I gotta get up out of here he said he became aware of the intense freezing cold he for him and pounding on the door but all the noise he made from inside the car failed to attract anyone's attention after many hours of struggle he lay down on the floor holier he lay down on the floor of the railroad car see he was locked in and now he's getting cold he's freezing is beating on the door he's losing it we're in his mind he's creating an atmosphere she's locked through he's in a boxcar true he's locked in but listen he tried to fight against the freezing cold he scratched a message on the floor that this is easy and reached his last point he feels like he's dying I'm dying so he said let me scratch on the floor and leave a message for when they find me he didn't already produced his death we're okay these are my scratches on the floor I'm freezing up cold when they find me I got to let him know what happened the mind is powerful he said he tried to fight against the freezing cold he scratched a message on the floor explaining it's unfortunate enemy death late the next day repairman from the railroad open the door and found and found the dead man inside listen to that next day repair me repairman found him why repairman because the freezer did not work Church when they found him earlier what happened was he heard the fan blowing and he thought it was a refrigerator but it was the same temperature from outdoor being blown into the boxcar and in his mind earlier he produced freezing temperature he was being blue they said it was like it was inside the box he was in his mind all the appearance of having the most likely the temperature of the railroad car had never fallen below 50 degrees so where did he die first control your thoughts the man had died because he thought he was freezing to death and I wonder how often do we get what we're thinking certain things happen because of our thought process certain things we go through is because of how we think remember the prophet of God said you are what your thoughts are so we need to challenge ourselves to control our thoughts oh yeah we need to have thoughts that I'm the head and not the tail I'm blessed in that curse hallelujah I'm royalty amen I'm the son of a king amen hallelujah we need to have those kind of thoughts first but as I close put the last picture back up sis look like a jailbird onna I know some of y'all thinking I wonder is that Photoshop no that's actually me I sex with me and that's actually a jailhouse all that behind me honey put the last picture now I'm gonna give you the current content I went to Canada and I had to do a youth meeting Hylian and garbage gonna give me an inspiration I'm breaking the shackles hallelujah and you know why shackles because oh yeah there's a lot of people in church honey that are bound in shackles notice I didn't say chains hung because you can break the chains honey put the chains can easily hook back up to the shackles in your life a man oh yeah as you know as I was thinking about that I say there's a lot of young people there's a lot of people in your life find yourself doing the same own thing and I say to you today let God break the shackles off so why God was giving me that inspiration huh I wanted to make it real I wanted to make I wanted to look like an inmate so you know what I did Holly I went to Party City I said y'all got any jail suits in here yeah we got something back I said need one holiday so I really didn't go to jail I'm in person they know inmate so I'm winning both the jail suit I women got the shackles hallelujah I didn't water they said we gotta hand cuz I said no I want that you can get out of that with a key I want something that has to be broken off by stronger force oh yeah and why I had to change though Rachel why I had to change my head of shackles old hug Oh break honey and I say y'all notice the change that Steel's dangling from who come back up see I'm still bound I come again why I'm preaching I see when I steal these two hook and hook it back up on and I keep preaching we having a good time in church and I break them I see but I still got a shackles on I said what we need God to do he's breaking the shackles in our life and sometimes it's who told you that was it God or is it just your way of thinking huh sometimes we got things we struggle with but all it is is God trying to give us to cry out for help God trying to give us to cry out and say lord I need you but instead of us crying out because we got so much pride we keep doing shackles on but let me tell you something honey if you're not careful you're gonna find yourself getting tuning in life how did you do that douses so if you ever see that first picture circling on the internet you ever see it some kind of way somebody then got a hold of it they did extreme shot at it they didn't I cheated they didn't Facebook it and they spreading it around taste it with the jelly just oh we got you know and this is what I hate people who want to gossip in Colliers and we need to pray for our brother nobody to pray for me just pray we got a call so we gotta pray for our brother you ain't hurt seeing in mind they got other things that we want to say but if you ever see that picture circulating it something you to defend me because you know the truth you know the truth about your brother so you got to come to my defense oh yeah and you know I shouldn't say this but I like to shoot down a person that believed lies I do it in a nice way but when somebody come bring stuff to you you know it ain't true I'm quick to say no no they I'm like no no I'm like that I know pastor whoo whoo God moved him to another church and this is these brothers I'm save us by God's grace I'm about to close we've been blessed to get a great revelation of Jesus Christ we've been blessed and know things that a lot of people don't know and sometimes because of that it produces a pride and mashes believer can be some other they can be some of the cruelest people on earth because they know the revelation they don't believe that children can make mistakes they don't believe that hallelujah that things can happen in a marriage and and all these studies of not knowing the content not knowing whether God is in control of this thing remember brother babe hey man just mind his own business catch a ride if I if I got it right catch a ride with some guys and did something crazy and all this to get stopped by the police and he'd find himself going to jail innocent with a bunch of crooks why would God let that happen to a man of God he did nothing wrong when did one bother nobody he was pretty much in the wrong place at the wrong time but no that was the will of God because there were people in that jail huh that God had ready to receive the Word of God you know what people do in jail oh I just oh Jesus when it was all God sees us before we judge something by this make sure we got the right content what you thinking huh Leah is what you are so when you see things happen be like a Bible saying I believe this slow speed quickly here quick - listen let's be that way but a lot of times we need complete opposite we quickly speak don't wanna hear and don't want to listen remember the prophet of God said they were blaming this man for something he was supposed to do with a woman and he proved that he wasn't even there and they still condemned although you had the proof throughout the day let's control our thoughts now this message and condemn you but this message is to show you that your thoughts have power to control your life I know I know the sister who's in the Philippines and it was in church hallelujah brother was preaching on these lines then we were children of God and we come from God and so forth and after service they went down to the water to the ocean her brother got in the water and got lost Church and they prayed for hours crying out for him crying out falling pray for hours like where's my brother he did a search party all these things some people said he's gone he's drowned you know the water in got him but that sister she began to refresh her brother she began to reflect see now she's gonna respond because she have thoughts of love for her brother hallelujah so now she begins to think what the Word of God see that we are choosing of God and we had the power of the spoken word and all these things she walks up to the ocean hallelujah oh she walks up to the ocean stretches out her hands huh and she begins to quote some of the things that the man hallelujah God said that morning and she said ocean I command you give up my brother and write what she said that he came washing ashore they search for him for hours all it took was somebody hungry to speak the word that was in their mind and it became a manifestation is not some I don't know brain huh the ocean can't communicate with me so what was it it was creation here in the create came washes up on shore he just got up and it was like whether you been well you just what happened sounds asleep how'd you sleep in the water the only ones I know do that is these sharks and whales and fish hurry washed up on shore and they were like will you do or hear me say I was asleep I don't know our God is an awesome God come come control your thoughts because you can even create life or you can create death and like I say in this time with the pandemic and all the stuff going on have the right thought cuz like I said someone's getting free money the blessings of covert 19 some of us are spending more time that we ever did with our families the blessings of Cova 90 some of us are now having family dinner that we never had the blessings overnight some of us got a greater hunger and desire for God like I said don't be one of them people have this go and they open up the state and everybody back going you go back haha no remember God is up to something Amen let's just pray always thank you for your word Lord and only you login give us an experience Lord that turns into something that we can use constantly in our lives Lord and Lord as we see things unfold and we see things take place father help us to have the right thought process proposed they have the right attitude when it comes to the things of God and Lord even the things that we don't understand the things that we may see Lord and we don't understand opposed to remember that your ways are higher than our ways your thoughts are higher than our thoughts Lord and all God's just supposed to reflect back on the Word of God Lord when our eyes are trying to control our mind Lord let us live by the experiences of the Holy Ghost we pray you just continue to bless this church Lord the past and all those who are here and connected to this ministry in the name of Jesus Christ we pray and we

fear a man does not fear or anything like that we understand when it comes to Christ what his word promises he said it shall not come get it all around you but it's not gonna come near your house if you're not going to do we gotta pass by I'm also - this is this this is what God promised us holding onto everything he said control your thoughts control a man let's just bound a word of Prayer
