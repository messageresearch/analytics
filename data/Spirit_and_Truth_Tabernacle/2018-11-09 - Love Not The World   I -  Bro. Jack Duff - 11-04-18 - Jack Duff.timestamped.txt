[1:04:29] first Sunday morning and some things are
[1:04:34] just need to do before we get into the
[1:04:38] word of the Lord wanted to first just
[1:04:43] think all those that were able to and
[1:04:47] then just come to be a part of the
[1:04:50] service on yesterday and those that just
[1:04:53] supported it through the prayers and the
[1:04:55] food and the things that nature we
[1:04:57] really really appreciate it as a family
[1:04:59] as I mentioned and I had to apologize to
[1:05:04] my wife and also to my mother-in-law a
[1:05:07] man last Sunday morning I should have
[1:05:10] announced that we had a death in the
[1:05:13] family and and I fail to do that like I
[1:05:16] had the ax for their their forgiveness
[1:05:19] but it was my mother-in-law's
[1:05:20] mother-in-law she made it to 90 years
[1:05:23] old and her birthday would have been
[1:05:25] yesterday she would have been 91 and as
[1:05:28] we mentioned that the homegoing service
[1:05:30] if there was a present that I could ask
[1:05:33] of my Heavenly Father to give me if I
[1:05:36] was 90 and turning 91 that that present
[1:05:40] would have been to be able to enter into
[1:05:42] his heavenly courts with Thanksgiving
[1:05:47] right and and I think she had an
[1:05:49] opportunity to do that so she celebrated
[1:05:51] her birthday in heaven and that that's
[1:05:54] the best place to celebrate a man so uh
[1:05:57] so we just appreciate everyone in their
[1:05:59] support for that a man on yesterday I

[1:08:28] the year that that that transfer that
[1:08:31] you see there a man we fell short an
[1:08:34] hour
[1:08:35] offering and we had to transfer money
[1:08:38] from my building fund in order to cover
[1:08:40] our offering and you know that's
[1:08:42] something that we never want to do and
[1:08:45] you know so we were glad that it only
[1:08:47] happened once but I have to save Church
[1:08:52] that last month was a tough month a man
[1:08:56] and and you know I just want to
[1:08:59] encourage everybody please continue to
[1:09:01] give we we have a rent it's very
[1:09:07] expensive and what we had that well if
[1:09:09] ax is that an offering if we get 37
[1:09:12] people every month just give one hundred
[1:09:15] dollars in offering eight minutes all we
[1:09:17] asking tithing that's 10% a man what
[1:09:20] that's what God requires but when it
[1:09:21] comes to offering this free will but our
[1:09:23] ask is that consist we paid almost 3:30
[1:09:26] 750 in rent if we got 37 people giving
[1:09:29] $100 a month then we would cover our
[1:09:32] offering I mean we'll cover our bills
[1:09:34] pretty much every month so last month it
[1:09:37] was it was tight a man it was tight I
[1:09:40] you know but but I do want to just
[1:09:44] encourage of her please you know just
[1:09:45] some if you commit it to giving $100
[1:09:48] make sure you give a mentor dollars so
[1:09:51] our net is this $30,000 $30,000 under
[1:09:59] six dollars and four cent because we had
[1:10:01] to take $400 from that from this
[1:10:04] building fund so that's why we end up
[1:10:06] with a net over here thirty thousand
[1:10:07] nine hundred six thousand four cent and

[1:13:12] man y'all keeps us the brown in prayer

[1:13:24] Columbia so uh keep keep them in prayer
[1:13:27] and as she's away praise the Lord stand
[1:13:30] with me we'll turn and read a passage
[1:13:33] here out of first John chapter 2 and I a
[1:13:41] couple weeks ago we bleep the halls for
[1:13:45] a moment and we read this scripture and
[1:13:49] verse John chapter 2 verse 15 and I ask
[1:13:54] everyone to just maybe take it and write
[1:13:58] something down as to how the scripture
[1:14:01] speaks to you a man and and I pray is
[1:14:05] something that you've been meditating on
[1:14:07] and just thinking about but I know as we
[1:14:10] we have various generations that are
[1:14:12] represented here in this congregation
[1:14:15] and as we read this scripture again
[1:14:17] today it should speak to us all a little
[1:14:20] differently but nonetheless a man it
[1:14:23] should have some type of impact on our
[1:14:25] lives here in 1st John 2 verse 15 it
[1:14:29] says love not love not the world neither
[1:14:38] the things that are in the world
[1:14:40] If any man love the world the love of
[1:14:43] the father is not in him amen let's read
[1:14:47] it again love not the world neither the
[1:14:49] things that are in the world
[1:14:51] If any man love the world the love of
[1:14:53] the father is not in him amen let's pray
[1:14:58] over this father God we approach your
[1:15:01] throne we thank you for
[1:15:05] bet you have given and/or Jesus our
[1:15:09] trust is that you would God that you
[1:15:14] would just suss to us through it that
[1:15:17] you would help us Lord to see what the
[1:15:20] Spirit is is desiring for us to see
[1:15:24] today
[1:15:26] even at this moment we take every spirit
[1:15:28] that's against the Spirit of God
[1:15:29] underneath the control of the Holy
[1:15:31] Spirit and we trust Lord Jesus that you
[1:15:34] would have Liberty a man and this
[1:15:38] portion of a service the Bible says that
[1:15:40] where the Spirit of the Lord is there is
[1:15:42] Liberty so God just take your take your
[1:15:45] rightful place take control over our
[1:15:48] thoughts kick take control over our a
[1:15:52] man our and attention span take control
[1:15:55] father over everything that Satan will
[1:15:59] try to use to prevent us from receiving
[1:16:01] from heaven on today God speak and only
[1:16:05] way that you can minister to every heart
[1:16:07] may go Lord beyond our flesh and may go
[1:16:09] to the depths of our soul let the word
[1:16:12] make a difference it's in Jesus name we
[1:16:14] pray amen and amen god bless you let's
[1:16:18] feed it
[1:16:29] praise the Lord a man we want to just
[1:16:33] take for our title here today love not
[1:16:37] the world a man love not the world you
[1:16:44] know and I was there I guess a few
[1:16:48] months ago there in Tucson and I was in
[1:16:53] you know in the in my hotel room just
[1:16:56] kind of getting ready for service but I
[1:16:57] was doing my my daily Bible reading and
[1:17:02] the scripture was one of the scriptures
[1:17:05] for that day and as I as I read the
[1:17:08] scripture it just seemed like verse 15
[1:17:12] just kind of lifted up you know out of
[1:17:15] the Bible and and man I felt like
[1:17:18] getting up and just running around the
[1:17:20] room you know over over that and and it
[1:17:23] was a reason you know I took me back to
[1:17:26] a message that brother Belton had
[1:17:31] preached here a man and and you know
[1:17:33] when we look at this it says love not
[1:17:36] the world okay but he had made uh he
[1:17:40] made a statement he asked the question
[1:17:41] to say here the Bible's telling us love
[1:17:44] not the world a man and but uh but Jesus
[1:17:49] said actually well I'm sorry not Jesus
[1:17:52] but the Bible says here in John which is
[1:17:55] a very very favorite passage you know
[1:17:58] you see it uh you know you go to
[1:18:00] football games and they just got the the
[1:18:02] the you know the sign all all out to
[1:18:05] everybody got this sign out basketball
[1:18:07] games got it they might even have it at
[1:18:10] hockey games I don't even know right but
[1:18:12] everybody just put this sign up you know
[1:18:14] it's supposed to mean so much and I mean
[1:18:17] if people didn't know one scripture they
[1:18:20] got at least know that without the Bible
[1:18:22] right John 3:16 says for God so loved
[1:18:26] the world a man that He gave His only
[1:18:29] begotten Son that whosoever believeth in
[1:18:32] him should not perish but have
[1:18:34] everlasting life so here you know I've
[1:18:38] thought about that and brotherbrother
[1:18:39] belted me to come and they say well what
[1:18:41] world
[1:18:42] right
[1:18:43] mean here here it's a God so loved the
[1:18:45] world but then over here in first John
[1:18:47] it tells us love not the world but now
[1:18:50] so yeah we got a conflict here if God so
[1:18:53] loved the world the question is what
[1:18:54] world what world does God love right a
[1:18:58] man and and you know the other thing I
[1:19:00] won't just kind of take a journey here
[1:19:03] through if we could just bring up
[1:19:05] Hebrews chapter one a man verse one
[1:19:08] through three a man Hebrews chapter one
[1:19:11] verse one through three and it says this
[1:19:14] God who at sundry times and in divers
[1:19:19] manners spake in time past unto the
[1:19:23] father's by the prophets says hath in
[1:19:26] these last days spoken unto us by his
[1:19:30] son okay who me hath appointed heir of
[1:19:33] all things by whom also he made the
[1:19:36] world's alright so we see something in
[1:19:40] Scripture Amen that there are there's
[1:19:43] not just one world but there are world
[1:19:46] right and and any other thing here a man
[1:19:50] that we see here is that uh since this
[1:19:53] after these last days spoken unto us by
[1:19:55] son whom he hath appointed heir of all
[1:19:57] things by whom also he made the world's
[1:20:00] okay who being the brightness of his
[1:20:02] glory and the Express image of his
[1:20:04] person and upholding all things by the
[1:20:07] word of his power when he when he hid by
[1:20:10] himself purged our sins sat down on the
[1:20:12] right hand of the Majesty on high so I I
[1:20:15] just kind of I kind of got stuck there
[1:20:17] on that Scripture when he said when it
[1:20:19] says that whom he also made by whom also
[1:20:22] he made the world's so this tells us
[1:20:25] here that there's uh there's multiple
[1:20:27] worlds that we're dealing with a man
[1:20:29] there's this seen world it meant even in
[1:20:32] this room right now there's another
[1:20:34] world hallelujah you can't see with your
[1:20:38] eyes Amen but it's another world and uh
[1:20:42] that's operating Oh hallelujah you ever
[1:20:48] ever come to church sometimes that you
[1:20:52] feel like Amen you can ship house down
[1:20:57] huh and that the times you come to
[1:21:00] church and you can barely lift your
[1:21:02] hands huh amen you feel like something
[1:21:06] is stealing your praise that's because
[1:21:08] inside this church there's multiple
[1:21:11] worlds that are happening hallelujah and
[1:21:14] there's an influence that comes from
[1:21:16] those worlds sometimes it's a heavenly
[1:21:19] oh my god even if I could just put it
[1:21:23] this way you got really at one world a
[1:21:27] man you got this disarmed this just this
[1:21:29] demonic must fear that's another world a
[1:21:32] man indeed you got what you living in
[1:21:34] right now it may praise the Lord Amen
[1:21:39] you got you got what you're living in
[1:21:41] right now just where your physical being
[1:21:43] is that's another world now that that's
[1:21:45] all these different worlds that God has
[1:21:47] created and we got to be able to
[1:21:48] recognize amen
[1:21:50] where we're getting the pull from
[1:21:54] because there's only one world that God
[1:21:57] loves hallelujah amen and I believe it's
[1:22:02] that heavenly atmosphere that God loves
[1:22:04] right amen God though I mean God though
[1:22:07] when they say when they say I hate God
[1:22:09] so loved the world but then he also said
[1:22:11] love not the world hallelujah amen so
[1:22:15] God don't love everything about this
[1:22:17] world and you know what as believers we
[1:22:19] not supposed to love everything about
[1:22:21] this world amen hallelujah I want to
[1:22:24] just you know kind of take a little time
[1:22:26] and just read a few things here amen to
[1:22:28] you let me um let me I want to maybe
[1:22:31] read it pick up another scripture here
[1:22:33] out of Colossians hallelujah Colossians
[1:22:37] chapter 1 and i'ma start at verse 12
[1:22:40] let's just pick this up oh my god my god
[1:22:44] a man thank you Jesus he says giving
[1:22:48] thanks unto the Father which hath made
[1:22:51] us meet to be partakers of the
[1:22:54] inheritance of the Saints in light who
[1:22:57] hath delivered us from the power of
[1:23:00] darkness
[1:23:01] so that's that's a world right the power
[1:23:04] of darkness that's a world and you don't
[1:23:06] realize sometimes you can be influenced
[1:23:08] from that world they man they limit us
[1:23:10] pal darkness and hath translated us into
[1:23:14] the kingdom of his dear son hallelujah
[1:23:19] so that there's an elevation that should
[1:23:20] happen when you leave the world of
[1:23:22] darkness to come into a world of light
[1:23:24] right listen he says in whom we have
[1:23:27] redemption through his blood even the
[1:23:30] forgiveness of sins who is the image of
[1:23:33] the invisible God the firstborn of every
[1:23:36] creature for by him were all three three
[1:23:40] we're all things created that are in
[1:23:42] heaven hallelujah and that are in earth
[1:23:46] visible and invisible amen so there's an
[1:23:52] invisible world amen there's a natural
[1:23:55] world and there's a spiritual world and
[1:23:58] in the spiritual world that's an elderly
[1:24:00] room and a demonic room amen there's
[1:24:03] many worlds that we're talking about
[1:24:05] here so what world did God love listen
[1:24:10] visible and invisible whether whether
[1:24:13] they be Thrones or dominions or
[1:24:14] principalities or power all things were
[1:24:17] created by him and for him and he is
[1:24:21] before all things and by him all things
[1:24:23] consist and he is the head of the body
[1:24:26] the church who is beginning the
[1:24:29] firstborn from the dead and in all
[1:24:30] things that he might have the
[1:24:32] preeminence for it please the father
[1:24:34] that in him should all do awfulness well
[1:24:37] hallelujah so I mean really the world I
[1:24:40] think that God really loves is the one
[1:24:41] that he could have preeminence in oh my
[1:24:45] god amen the one he can really have
[1:24:48] preeminence because a man of things of
[1:24:50] this world plot does not have
[1:24:53] preeminence in that a man we see the
[1:24:55] devil at at work in the things of this
[1:24:58] world so here Paul I mean John ourselves
[1:25:00] love not the world or the things of this
[1:25:04] world right that in the world If any man
[1:25:06] love the world the love of the father's
[1:25:08] not in him now let me just start here
[1:25:09] with a quote out of who was God who was
[1:25:12] God look at this he says I and then
[1:25:16] we're going to make the second man the
[1:25:20] first man you can't see him
[1:25:23] you know I was I was you know just
[1:25:26] recently talking with somebody about
[1:25:28] this you know when you really look at it
[1:25:31] Genesis 1:26 27 that man was a spirit
[1:25:35] man made after the the image of gods
[1:25:38] all right say but in Genesis 2:7 I
[1:25:41] believe when he took flesh and wrapped
[1:25:44] that spirit man in what we see on the
[1:25:47] outside is just the flesh hallelujah but
[1:25:50] there was a spirit in there that was
[1:25:52] made after the image of God now let me
[1:25:54] tell you something
[1:25:55] glory to God you can just see a man even
[1:25:58] in your own makeup there's a pool of
[1:26:01] different worlds that happen
[1:26:03] a man worn your spirit man pools for the
[1:26:06] things of God but your flesh cuz Adam
[1:26:11] did not fall into he came into his flesh
[1:26:13] right and so what happens sometimes your
[1:26:16] flesh becomes a mess and what happens to
[1:26:22] your flesh is that it's always been
[1:26:24] influenced by a different world your
[1:26:27] spirit man is trying to be influenced by
[1:26:29] heaven where this flesh is being
[1:26:31] influenced by hell let's go further
[1:26:35] he says this it says and then we're
[1:26:38] going to make a second man the first man
[1:26:39] you can't see him second man was a halo
[1:26:41] and now he now he takes a third man and
[1:26:45] makes him like a little white cloud
[1:26:47] coming over we can see him Holy Spirit
[1:26:49] coming down he's all man that's the soul
[1:26:52] of man eternal then he says then after
[1:26:55] this man sinned he marked that soul
[1:26:57] blackness darkness coming to it and then
[1:27:00] God came down and lived in man suffer
[1:27:03] with man to redeem man and the Holy
[1:27:05] Spirit comes into man and drives that
[1:27:07] blackness and sin away from him and
[1:27:10] brings it back into perfect fellowship a
[1:27:12] part of God and now we see by the blood
[1:27:15] of Christ who cleanses us from sin we
[1:27:18] become Sauron sons and daughters of God
[1:27:20] who is God the one that stood there and
[1:27:23] rolled stars off of his hand and roll
[1:27:26] and and rolls world's I like that
[1:27:31] rolls rolls out of his hands
[1:27:33] and may the things which do not appear
[1:27:36] deity and deeds himself lives in man the
[1:27:40] creator that made heaven and earth lives
[1:27:43] in mankind God created worlds hallelujah
[1:27:48] so you know the spiritual world we're
[1:27:49] talking about God created this natural
[1:27:52] world that we're talking about God
[1:27:53] created a man all of this is created by
[1:27:56] God but when he says that he loves a man
[1:27:58] God so loved the world he's not talking
[1:28:00] about all of that a man is that heavenly
[1:28:03] that heavenly atmosphere that he's
[1:28:04] trying to pull us into when you come
[1:28:06] into church what the word is supposed to
[1:28:09] do is to pull you out of this earthly
[1:28:11] atmosphere and pull you into a heavenly
[1:28:13] atmosphere and you know what that's not
[1:28:15] something that you live in amen on
[1:28:17] Sunday morning only amen that's that's
[1:28:20] that's the reason you got to feed
[1:28:22] yourself when you leave the church
[1:28:25] because you were happening you're
[1:28:27] hearing from a different world do you
[1:28:29] realize when you get the word going to
[1:28:30] your car we're going to get the word
[1:28:32] going in your house that it invites the
[1:28:34] presence of angels huh hey man you can
[1:28:40] act sometimes you feel tears coming down
[1:28:42] your eyes it's the presence of God
[1:28:44] wherever you go you can have a presence
[1:28:47] of God in school you can have the
[1:28:49] presence of God on your child people can
[1:28:53] be impacted by the presence that you
[1:28:55] create at your desk huh amen because
[1:29:00] because you're living in a different
[1:29:02] world now you can also take rock music
[1:29:05] and create a different atmosphere and
[1:29:09] demons will be present demons will be
[1:29:13] welcome in that atmosphere it's a
[1:29:16] different world and God don't love that
[1:29:18] world guess what we as believers should
[1:29:21] love that world either oh I don't
[1:29:24] understand I've seen folk do it you know
[1:29:27] because we you know I got a quote here
[1:29:29] but imma just kind of you know brother

[1:29:53] that elevate him and allow him to speak
[1:29:55] what happened in the person's life

[1:29:59] atmosphere all right now he says say I'm
[1:30:01] living in two different worlds but you

[1:30:04] visions we I mean now God want us to see
[1:30:07] it but we might not be in that spot
[1:30:09] where you know where we surrendered to
[1:30:10] God where we can see that but I can tell
[1:30:12] you right now that people even though
[1:30:14] they not experiencing spiritual things
[1:30:16] like that they still live in to two
[1:30:18] different worlds

[1:31:35] different worlds you know folk folk
[1:31:36] dressed like Christians when they come
[1:31:39] to church huh that to you you're a
[1:31:44] Christian only when you come to church
[1:31:46] you think God don't see that huh and but
[1:31:49] but when you leave church it's a whole
[1:31:52] different story don't catch them in the
[1:31:54] street you might be surprised at what
[1:31:58] you see
[1:31:59] now wait a minute I thought uh-oh and
[1:32:03] see you say no I thought that was only
[1:32:04] for church no no no no no no no it's not
[1:32:06] only for church this is a 24/7 life that
[1:32:11] means 24 hours a day seven days a week
[1:32:13] we live this holy life what happens that
[1:32:18] you get trapped you get a pole from a
[1:32:20] different world and there's an anointing
[1:32:23] there and if you're not careful you'll
[1:32:26] fall underneath that anointed can we
[1:32:30] just talk to you a little bit this
[1:32:31] morning huh I mean you know uh you know
[1:32:35] sister she might not wear her heels so
[1:32:37] high here at church you know and I wish
[1:32:40] that we was kind of like like it wasn't
[1:32:43] in Africa I went to Africa one time you
[1:32:45] know the preaching and the pastor say
[1:32:47] the sisters came to church the week
[1:32:48] before with these high heels don't say
[1:32:50] the Deacons met him at the DOE told him
[1:32:53] that they could not come into the house
[1:32:54] of God like that now you know some of
[1:33:00] y'all I said that in the first thing
[1:33:02] with you minds that that happened to me
[1:33:04] I won't be coming back to that church
[1:33:06] that's sure what were you living in that
[1:33:12] show exactly because the Bible say love
[1:33:16] not the world or the things of the world
[1:33:18] because if you do that the love of God
[1:33:21] is not in you all right so the brothers
[1:33:26] don't know we had to tell them not say
[1:33:27] you know what ask Africa we need to
[1:33:29] bring it right here to the US we need to
[1:33:32] bring it right here to the US I mean so
[1:33:34] you know see where where certain things
[1:33:36] to church but then we you know we got we
[1:33:39] got this other side of the closet can I
[1:33:43] just talk this morning we got this other
[1:33:45] side of the closet that we go to when we
[1:33:47] think we not going to see those things
[1:33:48] oh god I'm gonna have to preach to
[1:33:54] myself I'm gonna say amen to me right
[1:33:58] amen but we got this other side of the
[1:34:00] closet
[1:34:00] and you know you don't realize that
[1:34:02] other side of the closet amen that's it
[1:34:04] you even in your closet is too different
[1:34:08] [Applause]
[1:34:10] in your closet there's two different
[1:34:13] worlds
[1:34:14] and let you see when God said he's so
[1:34:17] loved the word he what he don't like
[1:34:19] that other side of the world that's why
[1:34:22] you don't bring it into the house of God
[1:34:23] what you gotta understand not just
[1:34:25] coming to our God you are the house of
[1:34:28] God you represent God everywhere you go
[1:34:34] and I can tell you but God don't love
[1:34:37] that part of your world
[1:34:41] hallelujah that that's the part that he
[1:34:44] action will he tell tell us love not
[1:34:46] that's the part that he you know he hate
[1:34:48] himself that's the part that's gone you
[1:34:50] know just like like in Sodom and
[1:34:51] Gomorrah there was one part that burned
[1:34:53] it was there was so many worlds in Sodom
[1:34:56] in Sodom
[1:34:58] right kind of Abraham was living in a
[1:35:01] world
[1:35:04] Abraham happened to be in one world
[1:35:07] living in a particular world in the
[1:35:09] world Abraham lived in allow God to come
[1:35:13] and visit him and reveal secrets to him
[1:35:17] if you not hear secrets from God if you
[1:35:24] die Aaron secrets from God maybe you are
[1:35:28] living in the wrong world now lot also
[1:35:34] lived in a world his world was counted
[1:35:37] in between right yeah I mean I can say
[1:35:42] man with Abraham but I can also pull out
[1:35:45] my wife to do stuff down here that made
[1:35:48] me grieve my spirit but because she my
[1:35:50] wife I go see nothing huh not only that
[1:35:55] allowed his kids to get involved in all
[1:35:57] kind of stuff huh it's all kind of Wars
[1:36:00] happening and then it got so bad to the
[1:36:02] sodomites they were in a different world
[1:36:05] now you know even a lot being a made
[1:36:08] believer it grieved him what the
[1:36:10] sodomites was doing it grieved him but
[1:36:13] it did change them
[1:36:17] because if he was really impacted by he
[1:36:21] would have got up on there I think not
[1:36:23] knew that his wife weren't going nowhere
[1:36:29] look at the Bible the Bible the Bible
[1:36:32] make it plain when it when it I didn't
[1:36:34] just just just three words when it
[1:36:37] talked about the days of Sodom and say
[1:36:39] remember Lot's wife nine I ever did Lee
[1:36:44] Lot's wife had a lot more going on then
[1:36:47] just turning her head back to Sodom
[1:36:49] I think she had a certain pool a lot
[1:36:54] made it maybe Lot's wife was what we
[1:36:58] would call a dominating female spirit
[1:37:02] and she lived in a different world huh
[1:37:07] glory to God maybe maybe she's happy
[1:37:09] that her husband wants the mayor if see
[1:37:11] that's why you gotta watch certain jobs
[1:37:13] that you get because it puts you at a
[1:37:16] certain level where you got to conduct
[1:37:18] yourself a certain way and you got to
[1:37:20] live a certain way in that world you got
[1:37:29] to live a certain way in that work and
[1:37:31] you get so mixed up a man so confused
[1:37:34] because when you come to church you hear
[1:37:37] something different you hear in the Word
[1:37:40] of God right and when you hear the word
[1:37:43] of God this article victory buddy when
[1:37:46] when Judge they love not the world what
[1:37:49] is he talking about see see see see see
[1:37:55] see you looking like you look at his
[1:37:58] wife you look at the sodomites you look
[1:38:01] at you look at Abraham you look at all
[1:38:03] them everybody was living in this world
[1:38:06] but they had they were live in different
[1:38:09] worlds in this world you know you know
[1:38:11] the Bible say that we are we as
[1:38:13] Christians we are in the world but we
[1:38:18] are not of the world you know you know
[1:38:23] why we not well because the Bible also
[1:38:26] say that we are citizens
[1:38:29] from another Kingdom that's why don't
[1:38:33] that's why I don't walk around with my
[1:38:34] pants down huh
[1:38:37] amen you know it's just as you know I
[1:38:39] mean I'm just I'm just hitting these
[1:38:41] things you know when you when you when
[1:38:43] you when you when you when you think a
[1:38:45] man when the devil just just bothering
[1:38:49] you a test and you're trying you bite
[1:38:51] them high heels because the Bible speak
[1:38:54] of it y'all might not know that but you
[1:38:56] know the Bible also it actually
[1:38:57] prophesied that women will walk with
[1:38:59] stressed-out necks and what causes a
[1:39:02] nexus Trek it's the high heels man you
[1:39:05] can't even you can't even you can't even
[1:39:08] enjoy yourself in them Hills yeah I mean
[1:39:10] you wear them can I can I just be honest
[1:39:13] you ran because you want people to see
[1:39:15] you right but then when you when you get
[1:39:19] to where you're going you can't wait to
[1:39:23] take them off now I want to actually
[1:39:26] question where did the influence come
[1:39:28] from which world cuz there's many worlds
[1:39:35] the world the worlds we're freeing all
[1:39:40] these worlds we'll pray now God is
[1:39:43] trying to see which world you're gonna
[1:39:44] live in
[1:39:47] hallelujah somebody right but you know
[1:39:50] which world a man are you getting the
[1:39:52] influence from because I got it all
[1:39:55] right here but but you can't you either
[1:39:56] be an influence from the world

[1:42:06] right and make it look if I do say so
[1:42:13] myself
[1:42:15] and all along you are being influenced
[1:42:20] from a demonic atmosphere
[1:42:25] [Applause]
[1:42:28] [Music]
[1:42:29] see I'm not doing it because brother
[1:42:32] so-and-so did it or because sister saw
[1:42:34] so did it are you doing things because
[1:42:36] you saw it in the world
[1:42:38] what world the haircut that you might
[1:42:44] wear you know because we know sisters
[1:42:47] now now you know can I y'all just I'm
[1:42:49] just all over the place right now sister
[1:42:52] you know the Bible speak to you about
[1:42:54] not cutting your hair
[1:42:56] you ain't read that if you ain't ready
[1:42:58] see me after church I will show you in
[1:43:01] the book of Corinthians where God says
[1:43:04] it's wrong for a woman to cut her hair
[1:43:07] I'll also show you in that same book of
[1:43:10] Corinthians that is wrong for a man to
[1:43:12] wear long hat so when you catch a man
[1:43:16] with long hair and you catch the woman
[1:43:19] with shorter have you asked the question
[1:43:21] which world it's the truth in half see
[1:43:29] the world that God loves it's the one
[1:43:31] that's gonna follow his word the word
[1:43:34] that God love is the one that can have
[1:43:35] preeminence amen
[1:43:37] ask you a lamp a scripture it used to be
[1:43:40] a time if somebody showed me in the
[1:43:42] Bible that that's all it took for me I
[1:43:44] want arguing no mo because God said it
[1:43:49] now you know you could take one
[1:43:52] scripture out of context and we're gonna
[1:43:55] need to see it from from from Genesis
[1:43:57] all the way to Revelation which word you
[1:43:59] you been influenced by let me tell you
[1:44:02] something God only have to say it one
[1:44:04] time in order to judge you he only have
[1:44:09] to say it once
[1:44:15] alright hair styles haircuts I mean cuz
[1:44:20] it's so now after Bible speak against
[1:44:21] the haircut which word you think you're
[1:44:24] getting the influence from because the
[1:44:26] Bible tell you not to do it but you saw
[1:44:29] it probably some magazine or you know
[1:44:32] and light like brother Brahim say you
[1:44:33] notice the sister she won't she don't
[1:44:35] cut her hair but she wears it bobbed
[1:44:40] remember that quote he said this is
[1:44:44] to here she don't cut it but she wears
[1:44:46] it bobbed and I looked at that I said
[1:44:49] now what does that mean I had to go deep
[1:44:51] into the mind of God to get an

[1:46:52] mmm chief well which
[1:46:53] when I notice notice he got one speaking
[1:46:56] on this shoulder one speaking uncial
[1:46:58] that means he's got something
[1:46:59] influencing him from two different
[1:47:00] worlds and he's stuck in between oh god
[1:47:05] I hope we see that right he's stuck in
[1:47:08] between so sorry he got this thing
[1:47:10] something from the underworld and
[1:47:11] something from up above amen
[1:47:14] both of them trying to speak to him at
[1:47:15] the same time right so so sorry I said
[1:47:18] which one we in chief which one the
[1:47:21] black dog gonna like though he said
[1:47:22] depends on the one I feed the most how
[1:47:29] you think you feed the underworld how
[1:47:35] you feed down the world the music you
[1:47:37] listen to the television shows you watch
[1:47:40] i han't got no televisions the websites
[1:47:43] you go to the apps you got on your phone
[1:47:46] how you think you feed the underworld
[1:47:50] [Music]
[1:47:53] and can I just you know let's just be
[1:47:56] honest most of us only get to church
[1:47:59] once a week so your spirit man really
[1:48:04] ain't getting fed let's just put it this
[1:48:08] way you get about two and a half hours
[1:48:10] of church a week and the rest of that
[1:48:13] time I can't even add up how many more
[1:48:16] hours there is the rest of that time the
[1:48:18] devil get but here the Bible say love
[1:48:24] not the world nor the things of the
[1:48:27] world because the love of God not in you
[1:48:29] all right all right all right all right
[1:48:32] y'all just let me get it out every
[1:48:40] specie of every animal is living in the
[1:48:44] world that God created for a bird has a
[1:48:47] different world that he lives in than
[1:48:49] what we live in the bird has the ability
[1:48:51] to fly right a fish lives in a different
[1:48:54] world and let me tell you something a
[1:48:56] fish has the ability to swim and if you
[1:48:59] take a fish out of his world that fish
[1:49:03] will die and you take a bird and trying
[1:49:06] to stuff it down
[1:49:07] underneath the sea that bird will die
[1:49:10] right and let me tell you something
[1:49:12] spiritually if you out of your position
[1:49:17] you will also die see that that bird
[1:49:23] understands that he's created to soar in
[1:49:25] the Himalayas
[1:49:25] that's his world he's not trying to be
[1:49:28] no fish the fish understands that you
[1:49:32] know look look God made me that way to
[1:49:34] did this body's desire then I got to
[1:49:36] stay inside this water I got a I got a
[1:49:39] constantly a man be inside the water
[1:49:41] that's where I'm gonna live if I get out
[1:49:43] of this condition I'm in trouble how
[1:49:46] come a man can't see that if you get out
[1:49:51] of the condition of a position where God
[1:49:53] bless you you'll die all right
[1:50:00] undeveloped countries consider
[1:50:04] themselves third-world countries that
[1:50:06] mean they live in a different world on
[1:50:08] what you living in huh it meant but the
[1:50:12] other thing that I mean even though they
[1:50:14] live in a different world they might not
[1:50:15] have all the same amenities that you
[1:50:18] have but the other thing that I found is
[1:50:20] that they still impacted by an unseen
[1:50:22] world right hallelujah amen in a fully
[1:50:28] developed country the rich and the poor
[1:50:30] live in different worlds can I tell you
[1:50:33] another thing heaven and hell are
[1:50:35] different worlds right there's a natural
[1:50:39] world and a spiritual world just as
[1:50:41] there's a natural body and a spiritual
[1:50:43] body a natural man and spiritual man
[1:50:45] says when we talk of galaxies we're
[1:50:47] talking about worlds right when we talk
[1:50:50] of dimensions we're talking about worlds
[1:50:54] now look at this the Prophet makes this
[1:50:57] statement here it says in questions and
[1:50:59] answers part two he makes a statement it
[1:51:03] says here as I've often said I believe
[1:51:06] in the church here there's a role here
[1:51:08] like and in here in here lives mortal
[1:51:12] beings and each one is in this great
[1:51:16] conglomeration of gaiety of blackness
[1:51:19] and darkness
[1:51:21] turtles live in here now they are
[1:51:24] influency out when I talked about that
[1:51:25] man having a the black dog and a white
[1:51:27] dog now he's living in between glory to
[1:51:31] God this is where you live in so mortals
[1:51:33] living here now they are either
[1:51:34] influenced from this away or from that
[1:51:38] way so either from this way or that way
[1:51:41] either below or up right say you cannot
[1:51:44] be here a spiritual being sinner or
[1:51:47] Saint without having an influence from
[1:51:52] the underworld or from the above world I
[1:51:56] want you to think about that so this is
[1:51:58] not just something that that saints go
[1:52:00] through alone sinners also are either
[1:52:03] influenced from above or below
[1:52:08] hallelujah when you think that sinner a
[1:52:10] man is feeling the need I got to go to
[1:52:13] church I don't know why but I just feel
[1:52:16] like man I just I just need to be in
[1:52:18] church even though I just finished sin
[1:52:20] and I still need to get the curve Church
[1:52:22] where you think they being influenced
[1:52:24] from you think the devil tell them to go
[1:52:27] to church huh
[1:52:30] or if you know hear that hear that you
[1:52:32] know they filling that tub to go to
[1:52:33] church but then they also don't go to
[1:52:35] church today you too tired
[1:52:37] you too tensed due to that now I don't
[1:52:39] go today I mean not not now next week
[1:52:42] where you think they got that from
[1:52:46] hallelujah see that came from the
[1:52:48] underworld but but when you when you
[1:52:50] feeling that that that press the press
[1:52:52] right through that's coming from the
[1:52:54] above world that's coming from God but
[1:52:57] you got to be the one to make the
[1:52:58] decision as to where you're gonna live
[1:53:03] and it's a daily decision where which
[1:53:09] way you gonna live
[1:53:10] which way you gonna lean which way
[1:53:13] you're gonna go huh because so every
[1:53:17] thought didn't come from God
[1:53:20] sometimes there's thoughts that come to
[1:53:22] your mind you just be one to act on them
[1:53:24] that came from hell my god and if you
[1:53:30] follow through with that you'll end up
[1:53:32] in jail somewhere that's why you got to
[1:53:36] even bring your thoughts make them
[1:53:38] subject it to the Word of God you gotta
[1:53:44] bring your thoughts into captivity
[1:53:48] hallelujah somebody see because you
[1:53:51] always been influenced there and that's
[1:53:52] why when brother Branham say to either's
[1:53:54] from the underworld or from the above
[1:53:56] world that lets you know that there's
[1:53:58] multiple worlds that we living in
[1:53:59] multiple dimensions that we living in
[1:54:02] your cell phone operates in a different
[1:54:04] dimension than what you operate so you
[1:54:07] can you know your cell phone is in that
[1:54:09] fourth dimension of science and that's
[1:54:12] why that's why text messages can come
[1:54:14] right to your device and you never felt
[1:54:16] it you didn't see it and the only reason
[1:54:21] you hear it now you didn't hear the text
[1:54:24] message you heard the the effect or the
[1:54:27] end result of it right and all the
[1:54:30] reason you can hear that is because you
[1:54:32] got a little bus on your phone oh my god
[1:54:35] but as it was coming you didn't hear it
[1:54:37] can I take some it pass right through
[1:54:40] you and let me tell you something else
[1:54:45] demons pass right through you
[1:54:49] angels pass right through you but what
[1:54:53] what do you yield yourself to cuz the
[1:54:59] Bible say don't love the world or the
[1:55:01] things of the world all right I'm just
[1:55:03] I'm just highlighting that today there's
[1:55:06] more for me to say there but I want to
[1:55:08] highlight that part today what are you
[1:55:13] using yourself to your thoughts what are
[1:55:16] you yielding them to a man so you know
[1:55:19] this thing you know I mean you know what
[1:55:21] what what people tell you is like you
[1:55:23] know just you should read a message or
[1:55:26] listen to the message every day and and
[1:55:27] IIIi believe I agree with that but I
[1:55:30] don't I don't agree with it from the
[1:55:31] standpoint of just doing it
[1:55:33] to do it you got to know what you doing
[1:55:38] when you're listening to the message
[1:55:40] when you read your Bible those are
[1:55:42] things that actually influence you from
[1:55:44] that above world because you have to
[1:55:47] understand you are in a struggle and
[1:55:49] like I like this I said daily the same
[1:55:51] saying every hour every minute and I
[1:55:54] agree with that
[1:55:55] hallelujah you know you've been fought
[1:55:57] right now oh my god
[1:56:05] i'ma leave some of y'all alone I'm leave
[1:56:07] yellow but you can see how the devil

[1:56:14] devil do t come on church I mean it's
[1:56:23] the truth in it hi you'll leave here go
[1:56:27] sit down and watch a football game for
[1:56:29] hours and never wink never even not not
[1:56:38] one time what do you think is
[1:56:41] influencing you but let me try mean you
[1:56:44] know oh my god in it I'll help me Lord

[1:56:51] sleeping problem a sleeping problem now

[1:57:09] why the devil don't want you to hear the
[1:57:13] voice of the Prophet

[1:57:17] actually stop Bob remembers bother you
[1:57:20] from stopping you from sleeping he leave
[1:57:22] quick and then he let his friend come

[1:57:55] I'm just you know I'm just sharing this
[1:57:56] I hope they said this off just don't
[1:57:58] hurt nobody
[1:57:58] cuz you know sometime y'all think the
[1:58:00] past is so spiritual no the past is just

[1:58:26] Jesus there's no sleep man go ahead and
[1:58:29] sleep God anoint you when you get up
[1:58:34] that's why you don't wear yourself out
[1:58:36] like that Oh God
[1:58:39] right but but Church I'll tell you what
[1:58:41] you know we got to understand that it is
[1:58:43] we're living in we're living in this
[1:58:46] world in between but we've been
[1:58:48] influenced from one of the other one
[1:58:51] side of the other and I'm gonna tell you
[1:58:53] I mean even as you go from from from the
[1:58:56] side of um you know from front front
[1:58:58] from this underworld it actually more
[1:59:00] worlds underneath that first that first
[1:59:02] world and from this side there's more
[1:59:04] worlds I mean brother branham talked
[1:59:06] about how you know even in that fifth
[1:59:08] dimension he put three different areas
[1:59:10] up there it's just showing you there's
[1:59:14] all these worlds right and we're trapped
[1:59:17] and all of this just trying to find my
[1:59:18] way now
[1:59:19] you know let me read this other oh I
[1:59:21] didn't finish this quote right here is
[1:59:23] that right
[1:59:24] that was not reading um yeah let me just
[1:59:31] finish reading it all right he says not
[1:59:35] they are either influenced from this
[1:59:36] away or from that away you cannot be a
[1:59:39] spiritual being sent on st. without
[1:59:41] having an influence from the underworld
[1:59:42] from the above world if you're
[1:59:44] influenced from here you're from above
[1:59:47] right your celestial body is waiting up
[1:59:50] here but if you're wicked and
[1:59:55] hypocritical and indifferent now you
[2:00:03] understand that's three different worlds
[2:00:05] there's a hypocritical world there's an
[2:00:09] indifferent world there's a wicked world
[2:00:12] but all of them are being influenced
[2:00:14] from the underworld right said you're
[2:00:18] including your celestial body is down
[2:00:20] here regardless of how much you think is
[2:00:23] up there because the fruit that you bear
[2:00:28] before people proves where you're from
[2:00:36] the fruit that you bear before people
[2:00:39] who's where you're from
[2:00:41] so you are here what you are somewhere
[2:00:44] else you are here what you are somewhere
[2:00:52] else your life that you live here is
[2:00:54] just reflecting what your inheritance is
[2:00:58] when you leave here the actual question
[2:01:05] do you understand I know that that's
[2:01:07] heavy his head is hard to read at all I
[2:01:11] got ten pages of quotes like this but
[2:01:14] it's hard to read at all because I mean
[2:01:16] Jeff says just this one a little bit
[2:01:18] just got you know what is this I'm
[2:01:21] trying to get you to see that you are
[2:01:23] under attack and the only way you can
[2:01:26] overcome a man is through the Word of
[2:01:28] God hallelujah Church right you're not
[2:01:32] gonna win
[2:01:32] you can't you
[2:01:34] that is plain is simple love not the
[2:01:38] world and I actually I'll say right what
[2:01:40] does that mean to you what does that
[2:01:43] mean now what you got to do is go back
[2:01:44] and just kind of look at this and these
[2:01:47] are some things that's you know the
[2:01:49] Bible tells us the last side every every
[2:01:51] weight and every sin there's some things
[2:01:54] that are not sin but it's a way and if
[2:01:59] it's a weight where it where is it
[2:02:01] pulling you from now you know we sing
[2:02:03] the song I feel the pool you feel both
[2:02:05] of them you do you feel a pool but it's
[2:02:09] coming from two different directions one
[2:02:11] is to try to pull you up one trying to
[2:02:12] pull you down you know this uh um man
[2:02:22] one time was sharing with me so you know
[2:02:24] uh when you look at like a telephone
[2:02:26] telephone poles you know on the street
[2:02:28] and said you got one pole sticking up
[2:02:31] here and they run that line and then you
[2:02:35] got another poll here to kind of connect
[2:02:36] the line to you say but every once
[2:02:39] awhile to get a little drew in the line
[2:02:41] and the only way to get the dru pot is
[2:02:43] to take another poll stick it right in
[2:02:46] the middle and that it take the droop
[2:02:47] out the line that's what the wins the
[2:02:51] night service do for you
[2:02:55] it's taking the droop out your line
[2:02:57] right because you just you got a Sunday
[2:03:01] Sunday to Sunday and some are saying
[2:03:03] doing Nance
[2:03:04] you got some serious troops in the line
[2:03:06] right but but but your Sunday to Sunday
[2:03:09] we put a droop in a line that's why God
[2:03:11] gave you Wednesday night so you can take
[2:03:14] the droop out your line
[2:03:20] [Applause]
[2:03:22] let me just read some mo let me read a
[2:03:28] little bit more this is I'm coming out
[2:03:30] of smyrnaean church eh paragraph 1 20
[2:03:32] 3-1 let me let me just read this this is
[2:03:38] deeper than what I'm actually saying to
[2:03:40] y'all right now but but I want y'all to
[2:03:42] get this part then I can go further with
[2:03:44] it
[2:03:44] this Myrna Church ad says how tragic
[2:03:47] that was little did they realize that
[2:03:51] when they were asking God to let them be
[2:03:53] like the rest of the world they were
[2:03:55] rejecting him they talked about Israel
[2:03:57] and one in a king not might not
[2:04:00] understand that the he's saying just by
[2:04:03] them desiring to walk I've designed a
[2:04:05] king they're rejecting God but by them
[2:04:08] design a king they actually want to be
[2:04:11] like the world so you ever get the
[2:04:15] influence from God then want them to
[2:04:18] have no king god was their king but
[2:04:20] where they get influence they looked
[2:04:21] around they saw what everybody else was
[2:04:22] doing and let me tell you something
[2:04:24] that's how all of us act we see what
[2:04:26] other folks are doing and we want to be
[2:04:28] just like them
[2:04:29] do you realize you're rejecting God when
[2:04:31] you do that I want to be like the word
[2:04:35] let me go a little further with this he
[2:04:37] says to be like the rest of world they
[2:04:39] were rejected him because God had
[2:04:40] ordained that his people act different
[2:04:42] from the world they are not of the world
[2:04:47] and they don't look like the world and
[2:04:50] they don't act like the world cannot
[2:04:52] just this is what it say God's people
[2:04:54] they are not of the world and they don't
[2:04:57] look like the world and they don't act
[2:05:00] like the world they are crucified unto
[2:05:04] the world and the world is crucified
[2:05:07] unto this it's a 24/7 religion it's a
[2:05:15] 24/7 relationship right we don't look
[2:05:19] like the world that you want to know why
[2:05:21] we dress the way we dress we don't look
[2:05:23] like the world not because you know what
[2:05:24] sometimes you can't tell whether they
[2:05:26] Christian or whether they say based on
[2:05:28] how they dress you can't tell now I'm
[2:05:30] gonna take it used to be years ago you
[2:05:32] knew who the Christians were
[2:05:34] they absolutely dress different I thank
[2:05:37] God for the sisters you know I remember
[2:05:40] my wife and a man's sister Tina and
[2:05:42] sister Shonda a man they used to stand
[2:05:45] out there on the corner and and walk the
[2:05:47] kids cross and you know some of the
[2:05:50] times they got criticized the most is
[2:05:52] when it was wintertime when that weather
[2:05:55] was changing they spent out there in
[2:05:56] this skirt and the people come up to us
[2:05:59] then I ain't your cold what kind of
[2:06:02] question is that ain't you cold are you
[2:06:07] cold
[2:06:08] of course I'm cold right well but they
[2:06:13] sent it to set them up aren't you cold
[2:06:16] yeah well why don't you put on some
[2:06:18] pants are you cold and you still got no
[2:06:21] pants the reason that they can stand
[2:06:27] that's because they've been influenced
[2:06:29] from an a world they can stand and
[2:06:32] sister Rachel did it too
[2:06:33] they what they were out there in nature
[2:06:35] and I thank God they did every time
[2:06:38] somebody passed by they had many
[2:06:40] Stoppers say you know I used to I used
[2:06:42] to be like that used to oh there was a
[2:06:48] world that got ahold of you and stop you
[2:06:52] from being what you used to be and I'm
[2:06:58] gonna tell you the word I got a whole
[2:06:59] date ain't no one that God loved cuz
[2:07:03] that world that got ahold do you
[2:07:04] actually pulls you away from doing what
[2:07:06] God wants you to do Danny and the one he
[2:07:08] loved and ain't know when he died
[2:07:13] I'm going on there crucified to the
[2:07:16] world the world is crucified unto them
[2:07:17] 2nd Corinthians 6:17 3:18 says wherefore
[2:07:21] come out from among them and be ye
[2:07:25] separate saith the Lord and touch not
[2:07:29] the unclean thing and I will receive you
[2:07:31] not just come out from them don't even
[2:07:34] touch what they got Oh glory to God
[2:07:40] because what they got is gonna infect
[2:07:42] you it's gonna impact you I want to just
[2:07:47] share a little some
[2:07:48] here let me just let me there's a quote
[2:07:51] that I want to read I want to go to
[2:07:53] God's power to transform now III got a
[2:07:57] imma just get here but I gotta bring out
[2:08:00] something else in this particular
[2:08:01] scripture it's deeper than just things
[2:08:05] of the world and when we were in
[2:08:07] Pentecost that's all we could preach but
[2:08:09] now that we got a man the fullness of
[2:08:11] the word we can go further than that
[2:08:13] however however I think it's necessary
[2:08:17] that we talk about these things too
[2:08:21] because the influence of the world come
[2:08:23] in and I guess if the preacher don't
[2:08:25] never say that and people think it's
[2:08:27] okay and it's not okay God sent love not
[2:08:32] the world or the things of the world he
[2:08:34] said the things they say if you do that
[2:08:36] the love of God is not in you I don't
[2:08:39] care how much you say oh but they love
[2:08:42] God they do and they manifest in the
[2:08:45] world that's not what I see it that's
[2:08:51] what that's what that's what that's what
[2:08:53] God said is work you see in the world
[2:08:55] you see fruit the world if fruit coming
[2:08:57] off this tree and they say they love God
[2:08:59] now I got a question which God
[2:09:08] alright let me just let me read
[2:09:10] something here and i'ma come
[2:09:12] i'ma you know I'm gonna bring it to a
[2:09:15] close the day but I got motive see so
[2:09:18] you know like I like I told you they're
[2:09:20] sisters from Africa when they got sent
[2:09:22] home they actually came back to church
[2:09:25] the next week different well no why they
[2:09:29] came back different not just because it
[2:09:31] was going to get sent home they knew
[2:09:33] there was been influence from the wrong
[2:09:34] world and when you realize know that
[2:09:40] your brother Jackie right and you know
[2:09:42] what some of y'all I watched some of
[2:09:44] y'all change right here before my very
[2:09:46] eyes y'all used to didn't do that who
[2:09:50] you got the influence from where you got
[2:09:54] it from did you get it from the word I
[2:10:00] doubt it you got it from somebody and
[2:10:03] she was watching all right the might as
[2:10:06] well be truthful amen let me go on God's
[2:10:11] power to transform now I want y'all to
[2:10:12] get this cuz we just gonna turn corners
[2:10:15] night and I won't be able to hit it all
[2:10:16] today but God's power to transform he
[2:10:19] says this see something here
[2:10:25] the first spirit the first veil was a
[2:10:29] holy veil and she wasn't supposed to
[2:10:33] look out of that when Satan beginning to
[2:10:36] talk to her about knowledge
[2:10:38] she just had to take a little peep at
[2:10:40] the world he's talking about Eve let's
[2:10:45] just stop and think about this Adam and
[2:10:50] Eve were living in bliss this was like
[2:10:54] the perfect place paradise on earth now
[2:10:58] I mean they went the way that this was
[2:11:01] set up is that they would they would
[2:11:03] enjoy themselves during the day every
[2:11:04] day evening time come in God would come
[2:11:07] settle down and have church with Adam
[2:11:09] and Eve I mean it was a beautiful they
[2:11:12] went to church everyday it was a
[2:11:13] beautiful place to live this this Garden

[2:14:03] them next week but this week he wanted
[2:14:04] to tell you love not the world but you
[2:14:09] know what folks shout over this type of
[2:14:10] stuff and say you know I told you my
[2:14:14] spirit was bothered by what I was seeing
[2:14:16] in the fourth generation and then you
[2:14:18] know the other thing I realized is that
[2:14:20] they didn't hear these type of sermons I
[2:14:22] grew up listening to this and I went
[2:14:25] back to church the next week well that's
[2:14:29] what it went up when the pastor said you
[2:14:30] can't say a man say ouch hi the eve take
[2:14:40] a peep at the world in eating this this
[2:14:45] perfect environment perfect atmosphere I
[2:14:49] mean look I mean Eve went looking at no
[2:14:53] bad magazines eat eat when watching TV
[2:14:59] even when listening to Tom Joyner on the
[2:15:03] radio were laughing at Steve Harvey huh
[2:15:12] and from from my day Richard Pryor no
[2:15:17] she went doing all that Eve 1/2 a little
[2:15:19] dance
[2:15:20] yo y'all call that comedy and they
[2:15:24] cursing like sailors and you call it
[2:15:26] comedy which world you think you being
[2:15:29] influenced from huh huh
[2:15:34] you want to play your jazz and wonder
[2:15:37] why you got a lot spirit I can't get rid
[2:15:40] of this less spirit it's in the music
[2:15:43] hello somebody
[2:15:50] you know I mean that yeah yeah don't get
[2:15:55] me wrong I believe folk can come up here
[2:15:57] we can lay hands on they can get
[2:15:58] delivered but the question is can they
[2:16:02] stay delivered what you do when you
[2:16:06] leave here hi how did she take a peep at
[2:16:12] the world when none of this stuff was
[2:16:14] there but but the prophets say Eve took
[2:16:19] a peep at the world all right well let's
[2:16:21] just let me just read let me read let me
[2:16:23] read first thing I will tell you this
[2:16:25] the way she took a peep at the world is
[2:16:28] that she went against the word you want
[2:16:35] to know when you start taking the people
[2:16:36] at the world when you go against the
[2:16:38] word Satan began to talk to her about
[2:16:45] knowledge she just said just take a
[2:16:48] little peek at the world and that's
[2:16:50] exactly what her daughter the church has
[2:16:52] done you have to see you have to dress
[2:16:53] like some movie star or young men have
[2:16:56] to act like Elvis Presley or Pat Boone
[2:16:58] or some of those people under the under
[2:17:01] the name of religion Pat Boone is a
[2:17:04] Church of Christ Elvis Presley as a
[2:17:05] Pentecostal look at this to demonize
[2:17:08] characters
[2:17:15] Elvis Presley Pat Boone to demonize they
[2:17:19] actually came out of the church now you
[2:17:21] know why the devil brought them out of
[2:17:23] the church because he can influence a
[2:17:25] church now with the people that came out
[2:17:27] of the church mmm see when they forsake
[2:17:32] the word they've taken a peep at the
[2:17:34] world that's deeper that's deep
[2:17:38] when you when you when you leave the
[2:17:40] revealed truth and go to a
[2:17:44] non-denominational cuz you know yeah I
[2:17:46] gotta put it like that right because we
[2:17:48] know denominations is bad but done on
[2:17:51] denominations carry the same spirit all
[2:17:55] you did was take a peek at the world I
[2:18:00] know what I'm talking about
[2:18:02] I got the quote here to prove it you
[2:18:06] know you know when brother brother
[2:18:07] Branham say when when them two angels
[2:18:09] went down Amen to Sodom you say they was
[2:18:13] preaching down in cosmos he say they
[2:18:17] were preaching in the world oh my god
[2:18:20] that meant Billy Graham and Oral Roberts
[2:18:23] was preaching to the world and the Bible
[2:18:26] stay loved not as heavier is heavier
[2:18:33] it's much heavier it's much heavier it's
[2:18:38] much heavier love not the world I don't
[2:18:42] care how much you tell me you love God
[2:18:47] you do not let me finish reading the
[2:18:57] quote now I'm gonna tell you something
[2:19:00] read the book of John not just first
[2:19:04] gentleman read the book of John you know
[2:19:06] we was bringing out this talk last week
[2:19:08] John 6 Jesus has this problem with the
[2:19:12] with his doctrine and the people walk
[2:19:14] out on his doctrine John 6 is 21
[2:19:18] chapters in John how did they get I mean
[2:19:22] it would be honest John 6 we don't in a
[2:19:25] sixth chapter
[2:19:27] and they were gone so I'm just telling
[2:19:34] you this this deeper than what we
[2:19:36] actually think right I mean let's start
[2:19:38] with things of the world and you if you
[2:19:40] can see the types just on the natural
[2:19:41] then hopefully you can follow me
[2:19:42] spiritually but I'm gonna tell you
[2:19:44] something if we saw involved in things
[2:19:46] of the world it's gonna be hard for
[2:19:47] y'all to come and say man it is this is
[2:19:49] just as good as last week it's just as
[2:19:53] good as the week before I mean I mean
[2:19:57] this one should have brought the house
[2:19:58] down
[2:20:04] yeah I'm just I need you to understand
[2:20:06] this you know and I'll bring the quotes
[2:20:09] right and you know so you understand
[2:20:10] where I'm coming from right and and and
[2:20:13] this is why it's important that we even
[2:20:15] read the quotes because people don't
[2:20:16] understand the spirit that they be under
[2:20:18] you influence one way or the other every
[2:20:20] decision you make it's being influenced
[2:20:25] by one one either heaven or hell is
[2:20:28] influencing it bottom line it ain't no
[2:20:33] ain't no in between
[2:20:34] either the devil is behind it or God is
[2:20:37] behind it all right let me finish
[2:20:40] reading this it says to demonized
[2:20:46] characters that's throw the world in a
[2:20:48] no and a worst chaos than Judas Iscariot
[2:20:51] did it betraying of Jesus Christ they
[2:20:53] don't know it them boys don't know that
[2:20:55] nothing that I have against those boys
[2:20:58] man it's the spirit that's motivating
[2:21:00] and can I tell you ain't got nothin
[2:21:02] against nobody but I do hate spirits and
[2:21:04] I know what spirit is behind that you
[2:21:10] need to see the coming from one way or
[2:21:11] the other up or down praise the Lord and
[2:21:17] look this way I say Eve Eve was in a
[2:21:20] perfect place perfect but how does she
[2:21:23] take a peep at the world in Eden
[2:21:26] y'all gotta think about that you I mean
[2:21:28] you're in Eden but you takin a peep at
[2:21:31] the world
[2:21:32] I can see Lot's wife I know how she took
[2:21:35] in the people at the world I could see
[2:21:37] the condition there in Sodom and
[2:21:39] Gomorrah I mean she was living in
[2:21:41] world but Eden Eden
[2:21:45] a perfect place of perfect paradise but
[2:21:48] the prophets say she took a peek at the
[2:21:50] world the only way she could do that is
[2:21:53] when she forsook the Word of God God
[2:21:56] gave him specific instruction and when
[2:21:59] they went against God's Word they were
[2:22:01] looking at the world well I don't know
[2:22:09] what it is maybe the sermon is just not
[2:22:11] I don't know but I hope and I don't want
[2:22:16] nobody's mind to be blown I don't want
[2:22:17] none of that I want to make sure folks
[2:22:19] getting this because people I got I'm
[2:22:23] going back remember it remember I was
[2:22:25] telling y'all about Nimrod I'm coming
[2:22:28] back to God's power to transform you
[2:22:30] singing but remember I was telling me
[2:22:31] all about Nimrod on last week I told
[2:22:34] y'all Nimrod had three things that he
[2:22:37] wanted to do three things he wanted to
[2:22:41] build a strong nation he's taking a peep
[2:22:44] at the world he wanted to propagate his
[2:22:48] own religion he's taking a peep at the
[2:22:50] world he wanted to make a name for
[2:22:52] himself anybody now I'm that all tied
[2:22:56] back to something I got a stick I got to
[2:22:58] get out of that I can't let me get away
[2:23:01] from that right now I'm coming back with
[2:23:04] that one let me finish this quote cuz
[2:23:06] that that that ties into something that
[2:23:08] I came I can't I can't talk about the
[2:23:10] day let me finish this just step over on
[2:23:19] that side one bit let that creeper just
[2:23:24] get one little hold around the shuck of
[2:23:27] that corn one time watch what takes
[2:23:31] place the corn is gone oh yeah it's done
[2:23:38] it's done got him and that's the way
[2:23:41] it'll do it it'll do it every time Eve
[2:23:43] had to take just one peep at the world
[2:23:48] they say and let me say something to you
[2:23:51] brother and sister in first John the
[2:23:54] second chapter
[2:23:55] fifteen verse we can read it if you wish
[2:23:57] the Bible says if you love the world or
[2:24:00] the things of the world it's because the
[2:24:03] love of God is not even in us now look
[2:24:08] at what they say here now the world the
[2:24:11] word there is not earth it's a greek
[2:24:16] word cosmos which means the world order
[2:24:22] see how deep that is
[2:24:24] now I started y'all on some basic things
[2:24:26] but this go deeper it means the world's
[2:24:29] order if you love fashions of the earth
[2:24:35] the world if we love the trend of the
[2:24:42] day if we think this is a wonderful time
[2:24:48] or we have all these things if you think
[2:24:51] that it's because your thinking is wrong
[2:24:55] look at this
[2:24:57] it is perverted by the devil that means
[2:25:00] your thinking was influenced from the
[2:25:02] underworld and and not only is it a
[2:25:04] thought but it become actions your
[2:25:06] actions I pervert it by the devil it is
[2:25:09] perverted by the devil for if you love
[2:25:11] the world's order and the things of this
[2:25:15] present world is because the love of God
[2:25:17] is not even in you remember that Oh God
[2:25:21] look what we're looking into I'm gonna
[2:25:26] leave it there I got more to say the
[2:25:29] unfortunate thing I can't come back next
[2:25:31] we can see it but I be here I'm coming
[2:25:37] back and I'm just leaving you something
[2:25:41] I want you to meditate on that Scripture
[2:25:43] right I want you met first let it deal
[2:25:46] with you from a personal level right and
[2:25:49] and and and if you know like I said
[2:25:51] there are things that you wrote down
[2:25:52] that was God dealing directly with you
[2:25:54] you need that you some of y'all send me
[2:25:56] out products that television was one of
[2:25:58] the things of the world get rid of it
[2:25:59] summer radio get rid of it right sumit
[2:26:03] something might have been fashion might
[2:26:04] have been clothing get rid of it
[2:26:06] whatever it was that was affecting you
[2:26:08] you get rid
[2:26:09] of it but here's one thing we know love
[2:26:12] not the world neither the things that
[2:26:14] are in the world
[2:26:14] If any man love the world the love of
[2:26:17] the father's not in him all right
[2:26:20] it's what John said and we know he got
[2:26:24] so loved the world that He gave His only
[2:26:26] begotten Son but what world is he
[2:26:27] talking about because this one right
[2:26:30] here that John tell us don't love the
[2:26:32] ain't the one got love and that's not
[2:26:33] the one he died for cuz that one won't
[2:26:35] receive him that went getting further
[2:26:37] and further away from him amen
[2:26:40] that's the underworld he not talking
[2:26:43] about that that can't even be converted
[2:26:49] praise the Lord
[2:26:51] but he talked about the one that's
[2:26:53] caught in the middle of them two worlds
[2:26:56] that he's trying to get Redemption to
[2:26:58] him right but which would you know what
[2:27:01] just which one you're gonna take the
[2:27:03] pool from you gonna take it from above
[2:27:04] there you gonna take it from beneath
[2:27:10] let's pray father this is what you've
[2:27:15] laid before us we all have decisions
[2:27:20] that we have to make we have choices
[2:27:25] this is real the Bible tells us to love
[2:27:30] not the world the things of this world
[2:27:32] because if we do the love of God is not
[2:27:34] in us father and and and as you just
[2:27:38] just really put it in my heart as I
[2:27:41] thought a lot about this fourth
[2:27:42] generation there's so many things are
[2:27:44] going through God I also know that this
[2:27:48] is something that that they feel the
[2:27:50] attack in right here and they need to
[2:27:52] know how real it is the influence from
[2:27:57] either the world above or the world
[2:28:00] underneath we want to be influenced from
[2:28:02] above see what what's beneath us is
[2:28:05] actually trying to pull us down but
[2:28:08] what's above us is trying to pull us up
[2:28:11] you said come up hither so Lord that's
[2:28:14] exactly what we desire to do but help us
[2:28:17] to lay aside the sins and the weights
[2:28:19] that so easily beset us
[2:28:21] I know that revival fires are burning in
[2:28:25] this place but a real revival will watch
[2:28:28] trash onto the shore god that's what
[2:28:31] that's what revival supposed to do it
[2:28:33] washes the trash out of our lives onto
[2:28:36] the shore so what we pray that you would
[2:28:39] help us O God help us Lord to hear what
[2:28:43] your spirit is speaking to us God we
[2:28:46] trust that you would just you would get
[2:28:48] the glory and you would get the honor
[2:28:50] out of our lives we we Lord we don't
[2:28:54] want to a man be pulling in the wrong
[2:28:58] direction
[2:28:58] influenced by demons we don't want that
[2:29:02] God we want heaven to be pleased won't
[2:29:05] heaven to be welcome wherever we are
[2:29:13] Father send a mighty name of Jesus that
[2:29:16] we pray amen amen
[2:29:27] the song says I surrender all and if
[2:29:33] this is just a time where maybe the Lord
[2:29:35] is just dealing with your heart and
[2:29:38] maybe there's something that you just
[2:29:40] want to surrender I want to invite you
[2:29:43] to do that I want to invite you to do
[2:29:46] that even right now the altar is always

[2:46:23] [Music]
[2:46:26] says but if our gospel be here
[2:46:30] it is here to them that are lost in whom
[2:46:34] the god of this world has blinded their
[2:46:38] minds blinded the minds of them which
[2:46:41] believe
[2:46:44] so there is a God that we serve and
[2:46:47] there's a God of this room
[2:46:50] God sends his angels with messages to
[2:46:54] his people
[2:46:57] Satan says his temps to anoint you what
[2:47:00] I believe
[2:47:01] that you know you should not hear the
[2:47:04] word that we've heard this morning
[2:47:07] we should have all been checking our
[2:47:09] souls I've no idea

[2:47:13] world in any country I don't want the
[2:47:15] influence of the world coming into my
[2:47:17] home I don't want to see the influence
[2:47:19] of the world on me my wife no of my
[2:47:21] children so we must fight constantly
[2:47:25] constantly praying every thought before
[2:47:30] the word of Almighty God before you make
[2:47:32] a decision be prayed up the way your
[2:47:37] influence is coming from it's constant
[2:47:42] 24/7
[2:47:43] in your dreams Satan even cubes in your
[2:47:45] dream but God is awesome
[2:47:48] were you gonna surrender to who are you
[2:47:51] gonna feed the most

[2:47:56] meditate on it daily feed your soul with
[2:48:00] Word of God daily or sing praises to
[2:48:03] your God
