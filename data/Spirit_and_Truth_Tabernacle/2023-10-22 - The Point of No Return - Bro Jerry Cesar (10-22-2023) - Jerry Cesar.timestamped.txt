[7:27] I greet you all in the precious name of
[7:29] the Lord Jesus Christ uh it's truly an
[7:32] honor I'm grateful always to be before
[7:35] you and I just want to turn our Bibles
[7:38] uh just a thought the Lord uh presented
[7:41] to me and trusted to be a blessing and
[7:43] encouragement to you uh let us turn our
[7:46] Bibles to uh The Book of John chapter
[7:50] 17 and we just want to read the first
[7:52] few verses there verse
[7:55] [Music]
[7:56] 1-5 and just say Amen when you're there
[7:59] amen
[8:01] amen
[8:02] amen and it reads these words spake
[8:07] Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven
[8:09] and said father the hour is coming
[8:13] glorify thy son that thy son Also may
[8:16] glorify thee as thou has given him Power
[8:20] Over All Flesh that he should give
[8:22] eternal life to as many as thou has
[8:25] given him and this is eternal life that
[8:28] they Know Thee the only true God in
[8:32] Jesus Christ whom thou has sent I have
[8:35] glorified thee on the earth I have
[8:36] finished the work which thou has given
[8:39] me to do and now oh Father glorify thou
[8:42] me with thine own self with the glory
[8:45] which I had with thee before the world
[8:48] was I also want to read um Genesis chter
[8:52] 31 and just one verse
[8:57] there verse three
[9:00] Genesis
[9:03] 31:3 and it reads and the Lord said unto
[9:07] Jacob return unto the land of thy
[9:10] fathers and to thy Kindred and I will be
[9:14] with thee you may have your seats amen
[9:18] may the Lord add a blessing to his
[9:19] reading
[9:21] amen so tonight Saints I want to use as
[9:25] a title the point of no return
[9:29] and as a subject we want to focus this
[9:32] evening on recognizing and accepting the
[9:35] word of God now uh you know when it
[9:39] think about the thought the point of no
[9:41] return we can think about uh just anyone
[9:46] in a particular situation that has
[9:48] crossed a line and perhaps there's no
[9:51] turning back from that line uh there's
[9:54] many different examples we can look
[9:57] around us to think about uh someone
[9:59] having the point of no return uh but
[10:02] this evening if the Lord will be
[10:03] gracious to us we want to just look at
[10:05] it from a spiritual
[10:08] perspective and uh you know there's
[10:10] different um definitions of what that
[10:13] means having the point of no return and
[10:16] I just want to read a few of them to you
[10:18] tonight so uh according to Mariam
[10:21] Webster uh an example here is the point
[10:24] of no return is like being in a flight
[10:27] in an aircraft Beyond which the
[10:30] remaining fuel will be insufficient for
[10:33] a return to the starting point with the
[10:36] result that the craft must proceed and I
[10:40] like that example because you see uh
[10:42] when you get on the airplane uh there's
[10:45] no uh there's no uh brakes that you can
[10:47] press on uh there's a certain amount of
[10:50] fuel the pilot has to put on the plane
[10:54] to get to its destination right and if
[10:56] it gets to a certain place you see it
[10:59] cannot go back because the few will be
[11:01] insufficient it has to continue to its
[11:04] destination another definition is a it's
[11:07] a critical point at which turning back
[11:10] or a reversal is not
[11:13] possible amen turning back or a reversal
[11:17] is not
[11:18] possible praise the Lord uh we we have a
[11:21] few other words I'd like to read
[11:23] according to Cambridge it is the stage
[11:25] at which it is no longer possible to
[11:27] stop what you're doing and when its
[11:29] effects cannot now be avoided or
[11:32] prevented another place we find it is
[11:35] the time when one becomes no longer
[11:38] possible to make a different decision or
[11:41] return to an earlier place or state so
[11:44] if you signed a contract uh you You'
[11:47] sign on the dotted line you've reached
[11:49] the point of no return that contract is
[11:51] final is sealed now in the message the
[11:55] godhead explained in
[11:56] 1961 0425 this was a breakfast meeting I
[12:00] believe and the prophet was among many
[12:02] Brethren and one of the Brethren there
[12:04] Tommy Hicks said we're too close Amen to
[12:08] the other side we've reached the point
[12:11] of no return how many times that I've
[12:14] heard the captain call back on the plane
[12:17] we've now reached the point of no return
[12:21] He says not long ago I Heard a Voice
[12:23] from another world that spake to me and
[12:26] said son you've reached the point of no
[12:28] return turn that means I'm closer to the
[12:31] other side than I am from the point
[12:34] where I started from and Saints I want
[12:36] to just remind you tonight that each one
[12:38] of you here have reached the point of no
[12:41] return that means you are closer to the
[12:44] other side than where you started from
[12:47] you see we're living in a day where
[12:49] there's unsettled rest but in this hour
[12:52] I believe God has conditioned and
[12:54] prepared a bride to have the point of no
[12:57] return realizing that where you are
[12:59] today is closer to where you were back
[13:03] then now we want to go back to Genesis
[13:06] 31 there and there's many people in the
[13:10] word the Bible that had a point of no
[13:12] return now why we can focus on is Jacob
[13:16] in verse three it says the Lord said
[13:18] unto Jacob return unto the land of thy
[13:21] fathers and unto thy Kindred and I will
[13:24] be with thee now Jacob was given this
[13:27] Promise by God
[13:29] in Genesis 28 where he had a dream and
[13:32] God told him that hey I'm going to be
[13:35] with you you will your seeds will be as
[13:38] the SC of the earth and I'm going to
[13:40] bless you now 20 years goes by Jacob
[13:45] goes into this land and he uh meets uh
[13:48] his wife and he gets married to uh two
[13:51] different women uh you guys know the
[13:53] story very well but 20 years go by in
[13:56] Jacob's life and he comes to the this
[13:59] point where God speaks to him that hey
[14:02] uh this blessing that I've announced to
[14:04] you 20 years ago now I want you to go
[14:07] forth and return to the land of your
[14:09] fathers in unto that Kindred and I will
[14:12] be with you now as Jacob goes into this
[14:15] uh uh return to back to his land we find
[14:19] that uh he's caught in this in this in
[14:21] this uh situation where he's caught in
[14:23] between uh he he has some unsettled
[14:26] business with his father-in-law la
[14:29] but he also had some unsettled business
[14:31] with his brother Esau right and we find
[14:34] him in the middle of this situation
[14:36] where he's going to a particular
[14:38] destination but one one way he's he's
[14:41] being pursued by his father-in-law and
[14:44] on the other way he he's he's about to
[14:46] come into contact with his brother and
[14:48] you see sometimes Saints I believe in
[14:50] this world you become surrounded by the
[14:53] things of the world where you have to
[14:55] get to a place where you meet business
[14:58] with God
[14:59] you see I like what it said here because
[15:01] in Genesis uh
[15:05] 32:4 uh we'll read verse n before that
[15:10] uh we find where Jacob is praying and
[15:12] pleading unto God he comes to God and he
[15:15] reminds god of what he said Jacob said
[15:19] God of My Father Abraham and God of my
[15:21] father Isaac the Lord which said unto me
[15:24] return unto thy country and to thy
[15:27] kindrick and I will deal with with thee
[15:29] he's reminded god of what he said verse
[15:31] 10 he says I am not worthy of the least
[15:34] of all the mercies and all the truth
[15:37] which thou H has showed unto thy servant
[15:39] for with thy staff I passed over Jordan
[15:42] and now I become two bands and that
[15:44] means Jacob is basically saying 20 years
[15:47] ago I came here only with a staff but
[15:50] now I'm coming here I have a group of
[15:52] people on this side and a group of
[15:54] people on that side Jacob had a double
[15:56] portion of God's blessings now he goes
[15:59] on to say deliver me I pray thee from
[16:02] the hand of my brother from the hand of
[16:04] Esau for I fear Him lest he will come
[16:07] and smite me and my mother with the
[16:09] children and thou sayest I will surely
[16:12] do thee good and make thy seed as the
[16:14] sand of the sea which cannot be numbered
[16:16] for
[16:17] multitude and now we'll jump to verse 24
[16:20] and it says and Jacob was left alone and
[16:24] I like that because sometimes when you
[16:26] are in a great need when you are praying
[16:29] for God for a particular thing God will
[16:32] leave you alone to see how desperate you
[16:34] are God will leave you alone to see how
[16:36] willing you are to endure until the
[16:39] blessing comes in verse uh we continue
[16:42] here it says and there Wrestled a man
[16:45] with him until the breaking of the Day
[16:48] verse 25 and we saw that he prevailed
[16:51] not against him and he touched the
[16:53] Hallow of his thigh and hallow of the
[16:55] Jacob's thigh was out of joint as he
[16:57] wrestled with with him and he said let
[17:00] me go for the day
[17:02] breakthe will not let thee go except
[17:05] thou bless me you see Jacob was Jacob
[17:08] was determined he was committed he he
[17:11] had a made up mind that in this
[17:13] particular situation I am not going to
[17:16] leave without you Blessing Me Lord you
[17:18] see and and I believe he had a
[17:21] desperation uh not only for the
[17:23] birthright right but he had a bless he
[17:25] had a a desperation for us all that God
[17:29] had in store for him and God I believe
[17:31] it takes that same desperation in this
[17:33] hour to have a perfect faith for the
[17:35] Rapture
[17:38] amen
[17:40] now in the message unchangeable God
[17:43] working un unexpectable
[17:46] way
[17:47] 1962
[17:49] 0120 paragraph 42 the prophet says Jacob
[17:53] God had just spoke to him and said Jacob
[17:56] return home I will be with you you and
[17:59] multiply you I will make your seed like
[18:01] the Sands of the sea he says why so un
[18:05] expected then for God to come to him
[18:07] that night when laan was coming one way
[18:09] and Esau another yet God promised him
[18:12] amen there you are friends when God
[18:14] makes a promise and opposition rise
[18:18] that's only to test whether you've
[18:19] really got the word or not the man
[18:22] that's got to the man that's got good
[18:25] gold don't mind going to the testing
[18:26] Stone that's true see that's right when
[18:29] you get the Holy Ghost a husband going
[18:31] to run you out the house a mother's
[18:34] going to leave you home them things
[18:36] don't give up and go back into the world
[18:39] that's only a testing time and I
[18:42] encourage you tonight saints that as we
[18:44] are surrounded by the different things
[18:46] of this world uh uh God is concerned for
[18:50] you to make it right God has prepared
[18:53] you and conditioned you for this hour
[18:55] for you to come out on the other side it
[18:58] it and and God I it says I believe that
[19:01] what you have today is is greater power
[19:04] than anything that the devil has
[19:05] released in this day that's right amen
[19:08] right now Jacob had a point of return
[19:13] now we can also find in uh in his life
[19:18] in Luke uh not Luke but Romans chapter n
[19:21] where uh Paul reads this and he tells us
[19:25] for the children this is Romans chapter
[19:27] 9 vers 11 he says for the children not
[19:30] being yet born neither having done any
[19:33] good or bad that the purpose of God
[19:36] according to election might stand not
[19:38] works but that of him that calleth it
[19:42] was said unto her the elders Shall Serve
[19:44] the younger as it is written Jacob have
[19:47] I loved but Esau have I hated and you
[19:51] see the war will have a very a very big
[19:54] problem with this statement because he
[19:56] they were questioning why and how can
[19:58] God hate you see would look at the life
[20:01] of Esau and says well you know when Esau
[20:04] bowed down and he honored Jacob they
[20:06] would have a confusing uh understanding
[20:09] of why and how God can hate but you see
[20:12] God's purpose is purpose unto election
[20:16] and when you look at the point of no
[20:18] return it was not when God called Jacob
[20:20] and said for him to return it was even
[20:22] before he was born it was while he was
[20:25] even in the womb and God had a promise
[20:28] over his life that at the appointed time
[20:31] he would receive the birthright and not
[20:33] just receive it but he would have a
[20:35] longing for it and I believe Saints we
[20:38] ought to have a longing for the Holy
[20:39] Spirit a longing for a Revival a longing
[20:42] for a a revelation and a refilling of
[20:45] God's spirit in in this day amen now we
[20:50] find a love a man that had another
[20:54] occasion in uh in his life where he was
[20:58] stripped of all that he had and his life
[21:01] seemed to be in a Blair where he just
[21:03] didn't understand what was happening
[21:04] what was going on but you find that in
[21:08] the midst of all of this he started to
[21:10] look around him and he started to
[21:12] recognize some things and we find this
[21:15] in job
[21:18] 14:7 he says for there is hope of a tree
[21:22] if it be cut down that it will Sprout
[21:25] again and that the tender branch thereof
[21:28] will not seize though the root thereof
[21:31] wax o in the earth and the stock thereof
[21:33] die in the ground yet through the scent
[21:36] of water it will bud and bring forth BS
[21:39] like a plant but a man dieth and wasteth
[21:42] away yay man giveth up The Ghost and
[21:45] where is he as the water fell from the
[21:48] sea and flood decayeth and drith up so
[21:51] man Li and riseth not till the heavens
[21:54] be no more they shall not awake nor be
[21:57] raised up out of their sleep see Jo job
[22:00] started looking around and he he was
[22:02] recognizing that there was a Revival
[22:05] happening in the pl life there was a
[22:07] Revival happening in nature but he
[22:10] couldn't it wasn't settled in his mind
[22:12] about himself because he lost everything
[22:15] and he was wondering if there would be a
[22:18] restoration to his
[22:20] situation you see he got to a
[22:24] place where it goes on to say here and
[22:28] we'll go to job
[22:30] 19 verse 13 got to a place where he also
[22:35] accepted some things as well and he said
[22:37] he hath put my brethren far from me and
[22:40] my acquaintance acqu acquaintance are
[22:43] verily estranged from me my kin folks
[22:46] have failed and S and my and fam
[22:49] familiar friends have forgotten me that
[22:51] they dwell in my house and my Maids
[22:54] count me for a stranger I am an alien in
[22:57] their sight I called my servant and he
[22:59] gave me no answer I entreated him with
[23:02] my mouth my breath is strange to my wife
[23:06] though I entreated for the children's
[23:07] sake of my own body yay young children
[23:11] despise me I arose they spake against me
[23:14] all my inward friends abhor me and they
[23:17] whom I loved are turned against me so
[23:21] job is noticing these things around him
[23:23] and he's he's accepted that he is now in
[23:25] a place where he's alone and in this
[23:29] place we we find that in verse 25 he
[23:33] comes to a place where he recognizes the
[23:36] main thing and the main thing was he
[23:39] said for I know my redeemer liveth and
[23:42] that he shall stand at the latter day
[23:44] upon the Earth and though after my skin
[23:47] worms destroy this body yet in my flesh
[23:51] shall I see God whom I shall see from
[23:54] myself and my eyes Shall Behold and not
[23:57] another though my range be consumed
[23:59] within me you see
[24:01] job had a point of return where he
[24:04] realized no matter what happened to his
[24:07] flesh no matter what happened to his
[24:10] family he was going to see a Redemption
[24:12] day he was going to see a day where
[24:15] there was a a resurrection you see but
[24:19] later God took job a little further than
[24:21] that we go to Job 38 and we read verse
[24:25] four and God asked him a question says
[24:28] where was thou when I laid the
[24:30] foundation of the earth declare if thou
[24:34] have a understanding who hath laid the
[24:36] measures thereof if thou knowest or who
[24:39] hath stretched the line upon it where
[24:41] upon the foundations thereof fasten or
[24:44] who laid the Cornerstone thereof when
[24:46] the morning Stars sang together and the
[24:48] sons of God shouted for Joy see God
[24:51] reminded job that your point of return
[24:54] was not you know uh uh uh uh just when I
[24:56] I show you these natural things but it
[24:59] was even before you were born you see
[25:03] God took them before the
[25:05] beginning in church I think it's
[25:07] important that we have the understanding
[25:10] that no matter the situation we're going
[25:13] through God had already settled all
[25:16] things in heaven the scripture says thy
[25:20] Lord or his word is already settled in
[25:22] heaven so if you have hold if you're
[25:25] holding fast to his word then you're
[25:27] you're not dealing with a a a a carnal
[25:30] weapon you're dealing with a weapon
[25:31] that's already been proven to
[25:35] overcome
[25:38] now there's a few other people we can
[25:41] look at but for the sake of time we want
[25:45] to we want to we want to definitely uh
[25:48] just look at a few other ones here Ruth
[25:52] had a point of no
[25:54] return in Ruth chapter 1 verse 15
[25:58] we find that she she comes to a place of
[26:02] accepting certain things it says and she
[26:05] said behold thy sister-in-law is going
[26:08] back unto her people and unto her Gods
[26:11] this is Naomi saying this to Ruth return
[26:14] Thou after thy sister-in-law and Ruth
[26:17] said entreat me not to leave thee or to
[26:20] return from following after thee for
[26:22] whether thou goest I will go and whether
[26:25] thou lodgest I will Lodge th people
[26:28] shall be my people and thy God my God
[26:31] where thou dest I will die and there
[26:34] will I be buried the Lord do so to me
[26:36] and more also if art but death part thee
[26:39] in me and when she saw that she was
[26:42] steadfastly minded to go with her then
[26:45] she left speaking unto her in in Ruth
[26:48] chapter 2 we find Ruth
[26:53] recognizing in verse 10 it says then she
[26:55] fell on her face and bowed herself to
[26:57] her ground to the ground and said unto
[27:00] him why have I found Grace in thine eyes
[27:03] that thou shouldest take knowledge of me
[27:05] seeing I am a stranger and Boaz answered
[27:08] and said unto her it hath fully been
[27:11] showed to me and all that thou Hast done
[27:13] unto thy motherin-law since the death of
[27:15] thine husband and how that thou Hast
[27:18] left thy father and thy mother and the
[27:21] land of the nativ Nativity and art come
[27:24] to unto a people which thou knowest not
[27:27] here to here to4 the Lord recompense thy
[27:30] Work and a full reward be given to thee
[27:32] of the Lord of Israel un un those under
[27:36] whose wings Thou Art come to trust you
[27:38] see when you come to a place of a point
[27:40] of no return he calls for complete
[27:42] separation you see God will separate you
[27:46] from those that were trying to hold you
[27:47] back God will take you away from the
[27:50] things that were drowning you in in in
[27:53] in a life that did not bring a testimony
[27:56] unto God and when you come to this place
[27:59] of Po uh no return God allows you to
[28:02] recognize his word in your life and then
[28:04] he allow he gives you his Spirit his his
[28:07] perfect will to accept what he's doing
[28:09] in your life
[28:11] now another person we find that had a
[28:14] point of no return is the woman with the
[28:17] blood issue now she doesn't have a name
[28:21] but we know she had a blood issue in the
[28:23] scripture in Matthew chapter 9: 20 it
[28:27] reads and behold a woman which was dis
[28:30] diseased with an issue of blood 12 years
[28:33] came behind him and touched to him of
[28:35] His Garment for she said within herself
[28:39] if I may but touch His Garment I Shall
[28:43] Behold we pick up the same story in Mark
[28:47] 5:25 it says on a certain woman which
[28:49] had an issue of blood 12 years and had
[28:52] suffered many things of many Physicians
[28:55] and had spent all that she had and was
[28:58] nothing bettered but rather through
[29:00] worse it says you might not see what the
[29:03] result of God is bringing to your life
[29:06] right at this moment but have the same
[29:10] approach the same mindset that this
[29:11] woman had when she was willing to sell
[29:14] that she had she exhaust her resources
[29:17] she exhausted all the things that God
[29:19] has given her as a possession but you
[29:22] see there was only one that could answer
[29:24] that prayer there was only one that
[29:26] could bring healing to her body that's
[29:28] right and that was the Lord Jesus Christ
[29:31] amen and we find it
[29:35] says verse 28 for she said if I may
[29:38] touch but his clothe I Shall Behold and
[29:41] straight way the Fountain of blood was
[29:42] dyed up and she felt in her body that
[29:45] she was healed of that plague Luke 8:47
[29:49] says she was healed immediately see when
[29:51] God is doing something and you have
[29:54] faith to just uh believe just a small
[29:57] all these things that he said in his
[29:58] word God will allow the things to com to
[30:01] pass
[30:03] immediately God doesn't take time Saints
[30:06] to do his work in your
[30:09] life we also
[30:11] find another person with a point of no
[30:14] return and I find this rather
[30:15] interesting because in this scene here
[30:18] we find two people that had a point of
[30:20] no
[30:22] return and uh we find this in Luke
[30:25] chapter
[30:26] 23
[30:27] and it reads uh chapter
[30:32] 23:39 and it reads in one of the Mal
[30:35] factors which were hand railed on him
[30:38] yeah saying if thou be Christ save
[30:43] thyself and us this is one thief on the
[30:47] cross that is breathing His Last Breath
[30:50] of Life and he is standing he he's on
[30:53] the cross next to the only one that can
[30:55] save him but he he challenges this he
[30:59] challenges Christ to say if you really
[31:01] are the Christ I hear all the people are
[31:04] saying well why don't you come why why
[31:07] don't you bring us all down we we're on
[31:10] this cross at this very
[31:12] moment you if you really are Christ you
[31:14] should have the power to to to take us
[31:17] all down from this cross this was his
[31:21] desire you see in verse 40 we read but
[31:26] the other one answering rebuked him
[31:29] saying dust not thou dust not thou fear
[31:32] God seeing Thou Art in the same
[31:35] condemnation now I like this because
[31:37] this other Thief recognized that he was
[31:41] a sinner he recognized that he was
[31:43] guilty and he was he was a a right he
[31:47] was rightly put in that position for the
[31:49] things that he's done you see and then
[31:52] he said unto uh verse 41 and he says
[31:55] indeed justly for we received the due
[31:58] rewards of our Deeds but this man hath
[32:02] done nothing amiss and he said unto the
[32:05] Lord Jesus Remember Me when thou comest
[32:09] into thy kingdom and you see you have
[32:13] one Thief that wanted to remain
[32:16] Earthbound and you have another thief
[32:18] that wanted to be heavenbound now I tell
[32:20] you tonight
[32:22] Saints do not trade the
[32:26] opportunity to be Earthbound that's
[32:29] right you see do not trade the
[32:31] opportunity to establish a Heavenly home
[32:33] for a hotel experience you see while you
[32:37] on Earth it's an experience that will
[32:39] pass you by but you see this thief on
[32:42] the other side realize he he he had to
[32:46] bypass he his own he had to bypass the
[32:50] faith of believing that yes I believe
[32:53] Christ can release us from this
[32:55] situation and we can can go back to our
[32:57] old lives but he didn't want that you
[33:00] see he wanted to have an establishment
[33:03] in the kingdom of God you see so he said
[33:07] remember me when thou comest into thy
[33:09] kingdom and Jesus said unto him verily I
[33:12] say unto thee today shall thou be with
[33:15] me in Paradise now tell you Saints this
[33:18] was a thief perhaps he was a thief his
[33:20] whole life perhaps he did things he was
[33:22] not supposed to do his whole life but I
[33:25] tell you tonight God's Redemption has no
[33:27] limits you see when God created you he
[33:30] took the limits off and God does not
[33:33] know no limits if you can come to God
[33:36] with the approach that God is then he
[33:39] will make you his son and daughters
[33:42] right
[33:45] amen
[33:47] now we want to turn now
[33:51] to John chapter
[33:54] 12 and he said vers verse
[33:59] 27 we'll read there uh it says now is my
[34:02] soul
[34:04] troubled and what shall I say father
[34:06] save me from this hour but for this
[34:10] cause came I unto this hour father
[34:13] glorify thy name then came a voice from
[34:16] Heaven saying I have both glorified it
[34:18] and will glorified it again now tell you
[34:22] saints that God is glorifying his name
[34:24] again through his bride amen
[34:27] now verse 33 he says uh then he said
[34:32] signifying what death it should be I'm
[34:35] sorry verse 32 he says and if and I if I
[34:37] be lifted up from the earth will I draw
[34:40] all men unto me then he said signifying
[34:43] what death he should die the people
[34:45] answered him we have heard that the law
[34:48] of Christ abideth forever and how sayest
[34:51] thou the son of man must be lifted up
[34:54] who is the son of man then Jesus said un
[34:56] un to him yet a little while the light
[34:59] is with you walk while ye have the light
[35:03] lest Darkness come upon you for he that
[35:06] walketh in darkness knoweth not where he
[35:09] goeth while ye have light believe in the
[35:12] light that ye may be the children of the
[35:14] light these things spake Jesus and
[35:17] departed and did a hide himself from
[35:20] them now tell you tonight Saints it is
[35:24] our duty to walk in this light while
[35:26] there is light you see the bride is the
[35:29] light of this day when the bride goes
[35:33] the light will no longer be so walk
[35:36] while you have light in Luke 18 verse
[35:41] 1 it says and he spoke a parable unto
[35:45] them to this end that men ought to
[35:47] always pray and not to faint saying
[35:50] there was a city and a judge which
[35:52] feared not God neither regarded man and
[35:55] there was a widow in in that City and
[35:58] she came unto him saying avenge me of
[36:00] mine adversary and he would not for a
[36:02] while but afterward he said within
[36:05] himself though I fear not God no
[36:07] regarded man yet because this Widow
[36:10] troubleth me I will avenge her lest by
[36:13] her continual coming she wey me and the
[36:16] Lord said hear what the unjust judge
[36:19] said and shall not God avenge his own
[36:22] elect you see if God could if a judge
[36:26] that is unrighteous that has no fear of
[36:28] God can uh be so compelled to
[36:32] accommodate this woman how much more
[36:35] with God hear un The Cry of his bride it
[36:38] goes on to say verse 8 I tell you that
[36:41] he will avenge them speedily
[36:43] nevertheless when the son of man cometh
[36:45] shall he find faith on the earth and I
[36:48] tell you tonight saints that your cry
[36:51] does not bother God your trial does not
[36:54] worry God your unbelief
[36:57] does not even worry God but when you
[36:59] recognize church that your faith can
[37:01] move
[37:03] God your faith doesn't only move the
[37:05] mountains it moves it responds to the
[37:08] god that created the mountain it
[37:10] responds to the master of all
[37:12] circumstances the creator of all
[37:15] things now in message desperations the
[37:19] prophet says verse uh paragraph 32 I
[37:22] truly believe that we're on the verge of
[37:25] the most mightiest thing that ever
[37:27] struck the Earth since the days of the
[37:29] Lord Jesus it says but now we can only
[37:32] be known as it'll be so humble see what
[37:36] man calls Mighty God calls Abomination
[37:39] but what man calls foolish God calls
[37:42] Mighty see so now watch it it'll be so
[37:45] humble that you'll miss it if you've not
[37:48] gotten the token there to examine it now
[37:51] I encourage you sa to make sure the
[37:54] tokens applied that's right
[37:57] amen now as I come to a close here I
[38:02] started off with this with this uh quote
[38:04] and I'm just going to go back a few
[38:06] paragraphs this isn't the same message
[38:07] that God had
[38:09] explained paragraph uh
[38:12] 42 it
[38:14] reads this is Tom brother Tommy Hicks
[38:18] there at the breakfast meeting with the
[38:20] brethens he says I think that we can say
[38:24] this um evening to sum up every that's
[38:27] been said with these words Christ in me
[38:30] the hope of glory say him he says please
[38:34] Christ in me the hope of glory there's
[38:37] ins and outs and overs in this life of
[38:40] every man I have a message I believe
[38:43] that every Christian says my heart is
[38:45] stirred this morning and I believe that
[38:47] for many of us things disturbed us make
[38:50] us better men and women of God Babe Ruth
[38:53] was known as the Home Run King but did
[38:55] you know that Bab Ruth was also the
[38:57] strikeout King he struck out more times
[39:00] than he ever made home runs he struck
[39:02] out
[39:03] 1,330 times he only made 860 home runs
[39:08] but every time Babe Ruth struck out he
[39:11] went back to the Doug out and when the
[39:13] old umpire holled you're out he went
[39:16] back to the Dugout and rubbed his hands
[39:18] and picked up the bat and pointed over
[39:20] the fence and he said I feel sorry for
[39:23] that picture out there there's nothing
[39:25] wrong in strik out but remember pick up
[39:28] the bat because Christ in need the hope
[39:31] of glory and he says we've reached the
[39:35] point of no return and I encourage you
[39:38] tonight Saints you might strike out your
[39:41] whole life you see you you you might
[39:44] have experience like the thief where it
[39:48] it seems like it's one bad event after
[39:50] another but you only need one word for
[39:52] the Lord and you see God says that all
[39:55] things would work together for good to
[39:57] them that love him and to them that are
[39:59] called according to his purpose so I
[40:01] encourage you tonight to trust in God
[40:04] and I wish to read
[40:06] this uh scripture here in Proverbs
[40:09] chapter
[40:10] 8 verse
[40:13] 22 and it
[40:17] says Proverbs chapter 8 verse
[40:22] 22 and it reads the Lord possessed me in
[40:25] the beginning of his way before the
[40:27] works of old I was set up from
[40:30] Everlasting from the beginning oh ever
[40:32] the Earth was when there was no death I
[40:35] was brought forth when there was no
[40:37] fountains abounding with water before
[40:40] the mountains were settled before the
[40:42] hills was I brought forth while I as yet
[40:46] he had not made the Earth nor the fields
[40:49] nor the highest part of the Dust of the
[40:51] earth of the world when he prepared the
[40:53] heavens I was there when he set Compass
[40:57] upon the face of the death when he
[40:59] established the clouds above when he
[41:01] strengthened The Fountains of the deep
[41:03] when he gave to the Sea his decree that
[41:06] the wat should not pass his commandment
[41:08] when he appointed the foundations of the
[41:11] earth then I was by him as one brought
[41:14] up with him and I was daily his Delight
[41:18] rejoicing always before him and church I
[41:22] believe as the bride of Christ you were
[41:25] there and that was your point of no
[41:28] return you see when God speaks his word
[41:31] it is forever settled in heaven God
[41:34] bless you
