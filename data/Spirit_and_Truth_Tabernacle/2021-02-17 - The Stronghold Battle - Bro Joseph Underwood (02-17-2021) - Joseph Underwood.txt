midst i just feel like god is just doing something and just expecting just so much more every time i come into the house of god and man i just expect him to do so much more and i'm looking forward to what he has in store tonight uh just before we have the word of the lord just let me give you the announcements and i wanted to say thank you to you all for abiding a man i mentioned that we had a case that was very close somebody came in contact with someone that had tested positive for the virus and we've been doing everything we can not to have an outbreak here and when i when i first heard about the the test my mind was going you know to and fro as to should we just shut church down for two weeks or you know what do we do and um you know as i was just kind of talking things over with brother troy and you know we just kind of came to the conclusion we want to keep church going we really want to keep church going and um and you know and had we shut things down we would not have been able to have the service that we had on sunday had we shut it down and uh have we shut things down we wouldn't be able to have the service that we're having tonight right so uh i want to thank you all for just just bearing with us and and i'll i'm i'm gonna just put this out there uh actual just to wear your mask just for the next couple weeks and so what i'm asking for tonight and for sunday let's wear maybe vigilant about wearing the mask in here but next week those that you know want to lighten up i'm giving you a amen next wednesday amen will will be past that that that little threshold of uh so many days of quarantine right so we'll be past that so those you know one thing i i didn't ever want to do is make it mandatory that when people came to church that they had to wear their mask i don't i didn't feel comfortable about that i just didn't feel comfortable but when we have been told that there there's a positive case nearby then we want to be what we call extra precautions right because we don't want the church shut down in any way at all so thank you all amen for just bearing with us as we get through this you know last year in 2020 we shut down but this year we're trying to do something a little different right so uh i mean we this is something i feel like we're gonna have to learn how to live through it amen we got to learn how to live through it and i think it as as a body together we can do that and uh and i just know that god will bring us through i really feel that way um so um just real quickly uh we'll have a service on this sunday at 10 30. amen uh we those

bride of jesus christ nothing hallelujah any accusation is already under the blood hallelujah any failure is already under the blood it's not a permit to sin it's a permit not to sin because you know all my sins are washed away and you love him because he did it for you in advance amen which reminds me i don't know if you all know this little song but i was singing it uh last sunday and it the congregation joined in and picked it up and it's um i love you too much to feel him now oh i love him too much oh to break my vow i promise the lord that i will make it somehow oh i love him too much to feel him now let's try it oh i love him too much to feel him now oh i love him too much to break my vow yes i promised the lord that i will make it somehow i love him too much to fill him now we come too far amen see we know he loves us he's proven it but how much do we love him amen do you love him enough to hold to that vow because remember it's a marriage amen it's a marriage and and it's it started with marriage in genesis and it ends with marriage in revelation and that is the mystery of redemption i'm gonna preach on that but i did last sunday amen but it's good to be here you may be seated a moment i'm going to say a quick prayer in a moment i just want to greet you from the family of god church in ocala florida we're we're constantly still on the move i appreciate the faith words of your pastor to continue on with church services you know uh uh there's a great spirit of fear in the land and and rightly so from a natural point of view but when you're when you're called to be the bride of christ it's just something else in you tells you i gotta go to church i gotta get with the believers amen and i know you can have home services and you can have home church and still be just as blessed by the word but oh how good and how pleasant it is to be able to look another brother and sister in their face and smile with your eyes it took someone a little while to catch that brother jack but y'all know what i mean i mean it's just good i i saw brother jack now this is going to throw some of y'all i tried wrote a jack at rudolph's house uh the other day and even if he had covet i'd have still hugged him without the mask we'd had covert together because that's how much i love it i'm just being honest with you that's how much i love him i know that in everybody's faith now amen amen i probably shouldn't have said that that kind of preachers we got in the pool fit today they take risks but no it's just i just meant that the love of god was so great that you could overlook all kinds of things amen you have a wonderful pastor i appreciate him i appreciate you all too i know y'all been supporting us with your prayers i i had an attack by the devil i won't go into the the full testimony of it but i'm just thankful to be standing here and before you tonight i i uh you know it was a battle i remember after i came out of the hospital and i went to a doctor just for a checkup and and he said something that caught my attention because i was just trying to figure out how much longer i needed to take these certain pills and i'm not giving you the whole testimony i'm just breaking in here somewhere and this doctor told me he says if you're not careful what's going on inside of your stomach will kill you and he got my attention because i was trying to stop taking these pills and he was letting me know if you stop taking the pills you may possibly die that's what he was trying to tell me in the midst of covet and everything else now i got i got a a a diagnosis like that that if i don't take the medicine i could die and so i walked out of there and i kept thinking about it uh and i just kept hearing this little song says i shall not die but live and declare the works of the lord [Laughter] i said i got more faith in the word of god than what the doctor says even though i knew my situation was not a light but i did stop taking the pills and i have not died and and they told me you're so healthy we can't even find trace in your body where they've ever had ulcers or anything at all it told me completely the doctor said you're completely healed that's how he said it and i was like thank you for that diagnosis so you know we thank god jack knows how things was i'm sure he shared it with some of you but just want to thank you for your prayers and for god uh delivering and bringing me through that ordeal and just keep me and sister pam in your prayers we were building a new church and when i heard jack say he's waiting to get a new address man i would love it if i i would just love to see you all have your own property and new church and i was thinking about it the other day i was like man if anybody should have it it should be brother jack and god's got a plan and he's working it out amen that we're we're getting um close to uh midway with the church it's a 5 000 square foot building so it's and it's 14 foot walls and someone asked me why did you build the walls so high and i said i didn't build the walls to how did the masonry crew built the walls that high i was being shortcast but i said the reason is so high is because the sound booth is up there and they turned around and looked and the sound booth is sitting over the entrance doors way in the back and i said they told me they wanted to be 14 foot high we wanted it up high not on the floor and and and kind of like what the pastor have here but we were not just trying to be big we were just trying to be convenient and so on and so they made it so big up there that it'll seat 25 people up there and i said that's special seats for special people i got some special people in here amen not just jack and erica we we love them but i got a tina in here somewhere sister michelle they somewhere around in there and boy becca and sarah i had some daughters named beck and sarah i ain't seen them in a while but it's for them too it's for you it's for all god's people really but y'all get my point how you doing rebecca good to see everybody i'm just loosening up a little bit y'all give me a few minutes if you knew what i've been through and spamming out but we we fought a good fight we finished and this thing went out amen but keep us in your prayers we love everybody brother josue and and his wife we just fell in love with was already in love with him we fell in love with his wife we took them out on a boat and you talk about a sister just know how to fellowship for a while i thought she was black i mean i really did i said this is a black woman and a white woman's body i'm sorry sister i i hope i don't offend you forgive me i should have thought about that a little bit more before i said it but boy she was veganizing me and everything and i i just love them and it was real she was so real she wasn't fake she just was wide open true and i said man god sent brother jack some good members i sure hope he's sending me some more like that but but we just loved on them i had a great time so we appreciate when brother jack's members come up they're now looking for big man troy he's not here tonight this man i can't i can't leave here without hugging brother troy i'll get him i saw his wife uh sitting over in the back god bless you tanya greet brother troy for me when you see him tell him i wanted my hug tonight but i can wait i can wait but but yeah he's my friend we just appreciate him so we love all of the uh spirit and truth members all a special group of people i see your brother came for sister k first i was thinking about you when they gave me 18 pills a day to take i said brother kate was told me he didn't have to take any pills i said i want capers faith lord anoint me with capers faith the doctor said we're not hearing that you don't take them you shall surely die i said man i mean i was sick 24 hours seven days a week brother capers taking those pills i mean i never had a moment where i wasn't feeling sick and it just took my faith i refused to stay in the bed i refused to to just be bedridden but we kept moving and after two weeks my faith fully kicked in and there was no more pills and i got healed by not taking the pills by not taking the pills so that caper faith all you gotta do is think about the people who've testified to you about the glory of god you may not know it but the prophet said when that that man gave his life to the lord he used to drink and and go out and gamble and everything and god uh he went to church and he told the pastor i'm ready to testify and the pastor said well go ahead and tell us brother he said i hope you don't mind but you used to be a rascal and you used to gamble and so so tell us how you gave your life to god was this what sermon did i preach he said well pastor i got to tell you although you preached some good sermons it wasn't your sermon that did it and although the singers in the choir song good songs but it wasn't the choir singing that done and although the specials were good it was none of the specials he said well then brother tell us what caused you to give your life to jesus christ he says i was at work and there's a man who i made fun of all the time i called them holy roller holy fanatic everything i could think of but he kept on demonstrating the life of christ until one day i said lord i want that jesus that this man right here have and that man right there led me to christ brother brennan came behind that and said he said god uses you to bring people in amen he wants to use us i was preaching a message on hidden in earthen vessels and and and i was close to speaking on it tonight but i i turned felt a little turn there but i'm telling this word is right this word is good and i thank god that he uses us testimonies from each other and if you listen to it just right one day it'll be a blessing in your life so that bless me brother capers i mean i really thought on that thing and it brought me through by the grace of god so we're happy to be here sister pam and i and brother jack thank you and the spirit and truth family for having us on a wednesday night i know it's not easy for people to kind of come out with work schedules and all but thank you all for coming out to support the service tonight god bless you i do want to go ahead and get into the word of god and not delay any longer uh we're going to um go to second corinthians um the 11th chapter and we're going to just read from there thank you sister becca for your music if i can open this up here and we'll start second corinthians chapter 10 verse 3 and 4. amen well they have it on the board great i'll just turn and read it but though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds now i'm just going to just read that by you here's with me let's pray father god of heaven and earth all your creation we thank you for this blessed opportunity to speak to the believers here south florida spirit and truth tabernacle church we thank you god for being here with us representing each one that's born again and saved we thank you for the holy spirit tonight father may your presence that is already here just move over the word of god tonight on a special way and touch me give me the strength to stand and touch my body my mind my thoughts lord that will speak what you want said lord and help the church in the way you intended for it to help us lord and we will give you all the glory honor to praise we recognize the season and time that we're living in and just may our hearts be rejoicing as we stone this manner from heaven in jesus name we pray amen and amen you can have your see thank you for standing with me uh just from reading that verse of scripture i would like to um give it a title if i would call it even a sermon tonight i just like to talk to you from from this verse a little bit the stronghold battle the stronghold battle and man we have battles don't we we all we all have our own personal little battles and and we're constantly at war with something right you know and and that's understanding because we know we have an enemy as long as you have an enemy you're going to have a war you're going to be ever in a battle at some point in your life amen and so uh talking about this stronghold battle the scripture tells us that the weapons of our warfare so we have weapons we have a mighty weapon and the weapon that destroys the strongholds it is the word of god now now the sin nature itself it is a stronghold it is a stronghold we don't go around testifying that we live in this sin nature but it's still there it's still there so and it is a stronghold but but i just like to i want to talk around a little bit and see how god helped me to to to go through this little uh talk with you this evening god's weapons or weapon his word will pull down and destroy anything that has a tight grip on you anything that has a tight grip on you can be pulled down and destroyed is that right amen for our weapons are mighty through god god works his power through his word he gives us the authority to use his weapon is that right and and we can use it on everything that has a stronghold and that is of their sin nature everything and and now there is a quote i want to kind of open up reading to you where the prophet of god said this and brother this is god's word which is sharper than a two-edged sword it's the greatest power that was ever put in the hands of man and gods expecting adam's race to put sin sickness and all kinds of devils to the fighting wrong because we're going to have to fight him now we're going to have to fight him we're going to have to deal with sin issues we have to deal with sickness issues that's we're all dealing with right now is that right he's saying all kinds of devils to the fighting wall that's right we've got the most powerful weapon that there is this is the word of god so now a stronghold is something that has a strong grip on you it's holding you tight or you're holding it tight all right come on come on all right god's word is so designed and has the power in it to pull it down and also to destroy it if you believe that's amen everything about yourself everything that you have allowed yourself to to make up about who you are it has to be pulled down if it's not in line with the word of god there are some personalities and characteristics about us that is anti-god but but we still embrace them because we've convinced ourselves it's who we are yeah and it is who you are but that's a stronghold in your mind that's got to be pulled down a mindset a wrong mindset is one of the most uh hindering things to your life is when you have the wrong mindset you almost can't achieve anything or accomplish anything you can't even be a real good christian when you have the wrong mindset you're constantly battling do i believe do i not believe am i in am i out you know should i listen should i shut it off should i have came out wednesday night or should i stay home i mean you battle that thing right so your mindset can be the very thing that is besetting you keeping you from coming to full maturity keeping you from achieving your goals and overcoming fears and frustrations these kinds of mindset must be pulled down the wrong mindset can keep a church from getting a new address it'll keep you in one place for a long time it'll keep you from growing spiritually developing you'll be coming to church sitting in the pews and you'll repeat that year after year and hadn't grown a bit you don't know if god has gifted you to be a be something or not because in your mind you just a church member that's a stronghold right there brother it's got to be pulled down because every son and daughter of god is gifted to do something amen we all are amen now the bible is our weapon of warfare and the first person we should use it on is ourselves we quickly use it on somebody else i'll give you a quote in a minute brother the prophet said i'll give you a scripture but we have to use it on ourselves first the prophet says this let's diagnose that down like take the chemistry of the blood or the chemistry of water or whatever it is see let's diagnose it down in other words look at how it comes together look at what makes it what it is then he says why why did why did he give the word because he said now are you ready congregation says amen i know you're a little late because you knew i was reading a quote but are you ready okay so he says the word is eternal when i first read this i said you worked the congregation up just to tell them that the word is eternal but watch what he says why that statement is so important he said the word is eternal see and if god made a promise that is eternal and there is nothing nowhere can stop it they couldn't turn every atom upside down turn it backwards could never pierce the word of god one little word see because jesus said both heaven and earth will pass away but my word shall never fail amen he's trying to show us how powerful the word is he said that it is eternal it cannot fail see god was eternal before the beginning he's going to be eternal at the very ending but he put you in a time loop he put you in a tying loop so you can figure that you can get to know who he is now through trial and error sinful birth but he's still eternal now but what he's going to do is put eternity in you while you're on the earth that's his word coming into the ride he's going to give you eternal word by predestination seed that's already in you by faith so he's going to put the i thought about it i've said here i am i'm in eternal in the mind of god i don't have to leave but god created a time loop and deposited us in this time loop creatures of eternity placed in time and if any time something leaves eternity it's got to die now i'm going to prove this to you god put us in this time loop because everything in heaven is perfect nothing dies nothing gets sick nothing hurts there is nothing wrong in heaven is perfect and only perfection can go back there so if you weren't perfect from the beginning you're not going back there because you got to be perfect to get back there so he already knew what it would take to get you back where he was in the original but the question is why did you put me in a time loop if you read revelations chapter 3 somewhere around the 19th verse as a matter of fact you can read the whole chapter it talks about all the seven church ages right and every church age as he addressed the church age he says something to every age and he's only talking to the elect of the age of the or the sons and daughters of that age he says this to every age to him that overcome he says this in every seven church ages because there is nothing for failures there's nothing for quitters it's only for overcomers and he knows that there's going to be overcomers in every age he would not have said it [Applause] and how does he know there's going to be overcomers because he's going to give you what it takes to overcome it's not carnal it's mighty because in this age in this world is it is a world of sin hallelujah it's a word of sin i had a young man visiting us a long long long time back and i was preaching something similar to this thought and he said after church pastor it is impossible for anyone to overcome sin take a moment he said no one can overcome sin everybody sins take a moment he says so i don't see how you can preach that i said first of all is the word amen the bible says we can overcome the world he just born of god to not commit sin now he said yeah yeah i know it says that but that's not what it means i said i know what it means you telling me what it means i'm trying to tell you what it means you're the unbeliever i'm trying to help you boy we had a little talk there but i said god never makes a promise he can't keep we're the ones failing god god is not failing us so in your case you're right but god is going to have a bride that he's going to bring to perfection they will not willfully sin now watch now y'all heard me say that right but the prophet said only a christian can sin i mean commit a sin so how are we going to be made perfect you will never be the word in you is already perfect amen you got the blood in you there's nothing against the blood amen you know why the prophet god had to give the prophet a vision of the bumper around the whole world while he was criticizing the lady at the cafeteria table he said i'm a bumper for her sin what wait a minute you mean she's already forgiven y'all you know that's what god was telling the prophet she's already forgiven i'm a bumper for her sins he said my blood already covers her oh because she had already once given her life to jesus now ain't gonna break that down she just needed somebody to restore such a one isn't god good this quote says okay let me i read i read the quote out of context but we'll do it again this quote says but then eve he's talking about eve and he drops down and says satan had to get to her now you remember he's in a warfare with god y'all need to really get this part your adversary is in a war with god which means he's in a war with you because you're god's sons and daughters as a matter of fact i think he says that in the quote he said remember he's in a warfare with god and men and women is his children children of god so he's in warfare with satan god's in warfare with satan satan's in the warfare with god we're in a war y'all understand this we are in a war don't get comfortable now amen don't let your guards down too much amen cause we're in a war and so he says so now remember satan comes down to use a tactic to try to counteract god's warfare god's warfare god's uh weapon is his word remember that his protection so then the only tactic he could use would be reasoning i told the church back home i said i can prove to you very easily why satan is able to get anyone to walk away from the truth of god it's so easy to prove how he does it it's a tactic he has a real good strategy all he needs their mindset to do is lean over here to e empty there's no more word there there's no more belief coming in there's a blocked channel there the channel is blocked you can't pick up no signals it's a block channel you're sitting there but there is no signals coming through that the channels are blocked you know how the parents have the ability if they want if they have television or devices they can block their children from going to certain places they call the block channel that's how some people come to church they have a block channel gosh god's speaking seven church age uh seven seals and they can't pick up the channel just keep going to four and five and three but the preachers on channel seven they say i wish i could zoom i can't link up they're not trying to link up they're on a different channel and it's blocked amen logical thinking see satan tried to give evil a better way to look at it it wasn't a better way but he was deceiving her to think that it was a better way there was no better way but he was able to convince her that it was this thing that message god told you it's not all the truth there is there's a little more somewhere else now what what's striking is that eve already knew yeah she had truth and it was already a settled truth but he gave her another mindset you see we don't like to use god's weapon on ourselves we start looking for the fault everywhere else that's wrong he said this this ain't right pastor said that that ain't right but if you ever use it on yourself this is the only time when i can preach suicide and agree with it amen use the weapon on yourself and make sure you kill yourself okay i said it make sure you kill yourself with the weapon you know what i mean pastor i'm not i'm not i'm not preaching anything i hope y'all following me cause i'm trying to stay simple tonight use the weapon on yourself so anyhow we're quick to use it on somewhere else y'all get it so the word of god the bible said it's not carnal the weapons of god is not conor he's trying to get you to see these are not physical weapons or natural ideas and things that man are creating bombs and all this this ways of fighting with with carnal weapons god has given us a far mightier weapon than those things right that is true so we have a mighty weapon and god has given it to us to use he uses this weapon to pull us out of the grips of sin unbelief sinful behavior backslidden conditions uncertainty of where we stand he has to pull us out of that because all of us don't take a trip there at some point you see your pastors were standing up here and he was choosing his words carefully how he was talking about where your mask for the next two weeks see because that's wisdom pastors has to have that he could have stood up here and says i don't care what happened don't wear no mask in here this is a faith church and everybody who believed this message got to demonstrate that kind of faith and the church of god saying he could have easily said that and some of you with a stronghold would have said i ain't coming to that service i love you brother jack but you just dismissed me for two weeks [Applause] it's funny but it's the truth [Music] so pastor has to be wise because we know what we're dealing with spirits amen i'm going to sit down in a minute but it feels all right up here brother james so let's look at it now satan wants to use with uh reasoning he want us to use the reasoning with the word of god once you start doing that you're going to start down yourself out this this could be an area of of a sinful behavior or sickness in your body could be kept pretty much any any area but if you get you the reasoning with it you're reading yourself out of your own faith now uh god do expect us to believe that he can protect us i just read that in the quote where the prophet says his protection so god is protecting us god protects that seed in us amen so that you cannot be deceived so that the devil can't pull you out of the faith he's protecting you that way with that mighty weapon of his word you need to protect yourself from a lot of other stuff for example if i'm going to take a drive in a very very very very very dangerous neighborhood i'm going with protection i didn't say what kind but i will be protected right if i'm gonna uh man brother jack had a little laugh about this earlier this week we vote for chocolate brother go about you know when we had to go across seas and things and we had to take all them shots and and uh they they left both of my arms so sore and jack got a little sick from it or whatever but we took them shots we manned up to it we had to it was the only way to travel let the man up to that thing and brother branham said he he got ready to go across seas and they told him you got to have your shots brother brown that's right brother brown said but i don't need them but they said you got to have them i told them i didn't need them but he took all five it wasn't the lack of faith he had to have him i liked the little quote where the brother said you go to the doctor and you're dying say doctor i'm dying then the doctor says i got a medicine for you that will save your life he says if you refuse to take the medicine it's not the doctor's fault if you die now back to what i'm preaching here so a stronghold has got to be pulled down in the church say amen and the devil used reasoning and all these things to try to to get us to turn from the word of god he messes with our minds because he has access to the mind and we know this because we're experienced people we're we're not new at this we we know that the devil had access to our mind we've been listening to the message preaching the word for for many years now most of us is that right and so we know that's part of his strategy is to use reasoning against us but some people still don't know how to stop it they're not using their weapon so he uses this reasoning to challenge the word of god and its meaning its revelation is that right but the truth of god will always destroy a stronghold see you can't stop sinning on your own you not not by your own will power it might be successful a little bit here and there and in this area in that area but somewhere he's going to get you god didn't design you to do it on your own he designed you to need him prove it the prophet said god had attributes on the inside of him that he needed to express and only he could express it he had to create you so he could express them so he didn't design you to go through it alone because he knew you couldn't do it by yourself there's some people in here got best friends people that they call best friends people that they can go to and talk to i believe me and jackie is like that we can go months without talking but when we start talking and be like i've been talking with him just yesterday we have a connection like we can pick right back up that's good friendship is that right and that's all right you you have that amen but even in that i might need him he may not be available sometimes he might need me and i may not be available sometimes he may be dependent on all of you and some of y'all might not be here for him all the time but god will he designs you not to go through it alone let me let y'all in on something when a pastor calls a meeting and he got 50 people in his church and only five show up that bothers the pastor he ain't gonna tell you all that so i'm telling y'all for him i don't know if that ever happened here thank you brother but it does the pastor started wondering what's going on because he's human but in his prayer and in his expectation he saw everybody in the church but everybody didn't show up so he gets up here and put on that real face this i'm talking about myself and he goes through the emotion and the good words and being kind to everybody but in his mind he wanna say i rebuke them devils holding you back from coming to church you hit me on that zoom you know you should be here god was talking to you you let the devil keep amen we deal with this stuff these are strongholds even we have to deal with within ourselves but we have to turn around and put this weapon on us stay humble don't let it bother you i actually got the other day i said they just told me on monday that instead of needing just uh master jack instead of just needing ninety two hundred dollars and another seven thousand dollars for witnessing doors they just told us we have to put all the stuff in the church before we pass inspection everything got to be done we only have two months before our extension if our permit time is out thousands upon thousands upon thousands of dollars i looked at sister pam she looked at me i said well god god is all right he just made it easier now i could have said harder because in my natural flesh i was looking at the pam that's thousands of dollars she said that's all right it's got to be done she put the weapon of god on me quick boy straighten up pow what you doing over there the first bullet did it i was like yeah you right god something else he he gonna take care of this thing for us see once it hit you you're straightened up you know you got to use it on yourself tried to make me doubt how we gonna do that in this short period of time and all that i said god saw that coming before i did amen so i went in brother west coast office he was sitting there doing the budget and writing checks i got in line he said what you doing i said i need to i need you to write a check and i told him the number he just started laughing i said no i'm serious but that's when we had just found out that right sister fam all that faith he preached he's still in write me that check brother jackie oh my god but we still we still love each other though but i was sister sister uh uh i'm about to call you sister duff uh i'm sorry sister burst it was coming back to me trust god we're believing god we love god and we love you all thank you all so much let me try to finish this sermon i don't mean to step out but i've been through a lot i'm just rejoicing that i'm able to be here amen i'm just happy to be here amen but but you know you can't stop the nature of sin from pulling you into sinful behavior it's designed to do that that's what the sin nature does it causes you to sin singular first because it's called the sin nature after you start sinning it becomes sins it keeps pulling you further and further into sinful behavior and you don't know it's happening but there are strongholds developing in your life and you're still a good church member and that's great there's nothing wrong with continuing to go to church but it has to be identified so uh we all know some people like this there are people who smoke and and people who drink people who listen to the world's music we all know somebody that do that right and and we know people that dress themselves in decent and in my in modestly is that right we know these kinds of people we know people that will choose to to go to parties of the world and different things like that and and waste their money and destroy their good health strongholds make them do it we know these kinds of people right now we're church-going people so this would not really be our practice with our life am i right these are not things that we would find ourselves doing but there's another side there are some church-going people who do smoke a lot of lies and drink a lot of deception amen and listen to a lot of private interpretations [Music] and they will not dress properly in the garment of the promised work they refuse to put it on oh there there are some like that they let the devil plant lies in their spirit in their mind that's smoking them that's right drinking deception false interpretations and doctrines going places they shouldn't go because that's not where the the word for the bride is at they have developed a stronghold in the mind and it's sad because like the prophet said about eve he said eve if she had had only waited she would have come together with adam but she couldn't wait so she did an illegal act and took on another man's seed because she couldn't wait he deformed her mind that was the first thing happened to her was in her mind she deformed her thinking that's how he formed her by what he put in her mind and he said if she had only waited for the right way and he said the second eve did the same thing now he's not talking about the elect of the age he's talking about the gentile churches of this age he even mentioned the third e but i'm talking about the gentile churches of this age what he says and he quoted the elect gets raptured the foolish virgin must go through the tribulation period and be judged with the sinners that's a failed bride that's a failed church because she really is part of it but she took another seat i think people are fighting this because this seed is coming from the groom it's a pure seed only the elect gonna take this in amen she won't be like the first eve she'll keep herself she'll wait hold herself in place no matter how tempting it gets how hard it gets she'll keep herself right there's a war going on let me try to close this thing up i'm sorry i kind of got lost for time here but as we look at it these you know you know there's this flip side of the natural you look at it in the spiritual and you can see some some types and shadows there and i like something random said when you see your shadow you can't deny it that there's an original following amen he said that black woman that was standing at the gate waiting on brother brown waiting on him to get there he says when he got there she said good morning to him he said she saw her type because she told him what it was she said like the woman in the bible was waiting for that elijah to come he said once she saw her type god had to send the original i don't bother you can't get something you're not looking for you have to if there's a shadow there has to be a person following it there has to be an original coming with it amen i'm talking spiritual thank you jesus that's good right there my god forgive me for being slow you know when i when i first come off the medicine and everything i i wanted to get back to normal so fast i ran out that door grabbed my fishing boat you couldn't stop me i was at any lake i saw ready to jump into my boat and just drive it my body said slow down i started having pain fail so you're all right i said yeah i'm fine i didn't want to tell her what was going on but i i was in some pain and and she i said but i want to eat whatever i want she said no take it easy don't eat stuff right away i said it's been so long since i tasted real food let me tell y'all to tell on her while i was laying in the hospital sister pam obeyed the doctor so she they brought me some broth looked like it was made from the shadow of a chicken as brother brown would say it didn't have a taste and she like you got to eat that i said i thought this woman loved me but she had tiptoed out and brought me some old broth but it had enough of that thicker sauce in it i said thank you lord i ate it like it was the last shop i was like thank you god thank you lord but when i got out and got a little clearance to go ahead and eat you know be careful what you eat i said all right she said i'm serious don't eat too much i went drove 35 miles from the house and i found the restaurant it said 20 piece buffalo wing with hiberna sauce and a large fry for 19.99 i got to the one that said please give me that please she said you want something else you got i said what else can i get she said you got beans and i said give me a large beans and rice i just did it i sit in that car i looked at that food i parked over there right in the little uh parking lot i said thank you jesus bless this food that's i'm about to receive i cut it short i sit there and ate 20 buffalo wings ate some of the fries and the red beans and rice i drunk up my car and proceeded to go back to the house pam said you're right i said i'm fine by the time i got to the house my body began to tell me you're preaching you should have better wisdom than this you should know not to do that said pam i just ate 20 wings i said i meant so much i'm in so much pain oh my god i'm sorry y'all ain't trying to be funny but that's it she said why did you do that you deserve what you deserve what you're getting too much she understood why i did it but you know i wasn't supposed to do it amen i did it again a week later but let me get back in my sermon here it's a stronghold i needed to be delivered from a stronghold but now we all deal with strongholds and it's a grip on you and sometimes you don't even know it's a stronghold in your life you're just going about your daily tasks and things like that and and i'll try to wrap this up i i know i'm being a bit lithium and i do apologize for that but but you don't know for example sometimes it's normal for the wife to make a certain comment to the husband that keeps repeatedly doing something she had asked him not to do you know she might just say to him uh how many times am i going to tell you to pick up these clothes i'm not your maid something like that i'm using an example now she does that regularly because he does his behavior regularly right but after a while this arguing becomes a stronghold because it's going to go from why you didn't pick up your clothes to why you didn't do this and why you keep doing that and after a while temple will breeze temper and he's going to fire back and no one is using the weapon right right i've used the weapon on sister pam before just to gain leverage in our conversation and she would sit there quietly i said and that's right i know i'm right she'll wait because women are small they don't forget they just wait for the right time to fire back i thought i'd be to warn something until it comes back around and when i talk about she hit me hard she gets me good and she do it with love that's what's that's what make it hurts even worse but i thank god for her approach because she knows how to fire a weapon hit the target but not kill the intended target but it has helped me over the years to grow pastor jack to be a better husband and all of that and hit me to see that sometimes i do talk too much this tongue can be a stronghold oh it can be a stronghold and it takes god to pull it down some people don't know when to stop talking getting mad and they just get to go and you're like why don't they they say women talk a lot no women don't talk a lot women are just full of information that's a nice way of saying they talk too much this brother oh my god i'm sorry sisters but i used to say that to my wife honey come on that's just too much information but when i dissected down every bit of it i needed to hear god was allowing her to deposit some word in me that would help me to see myself and and i have to take it see if you don't take the word you're going to continue to be in a stronghold battle with yourself so i i just hope a little bit of this resonates with you all tonight amen is that all right and that's why i kind of find a closing spot here um god is so good to us it'll give us a little this little message that we have from his prophet let me see if i can get this back on read this last quote to you i think it'll be a blessing to you i'll chop this message up here but it's all good everybody all right i'm about to wrap this thing up uh so anyhow it takes god to get on the inside of us and pull down these holes that are holding on to us and i'm going to give you a little example real quick of of a stronghold it's a true story too i'll share with you in just a moment because strongholds if once they get in your mind they work their way into your heart and they become an emotional stronghold and you see people that get so caught up in their emotions over some of the smallest things they just get so caught up it didn't start there that's where it growed to that kep that thing kept holding them it becomes part of their emotions and now it's in them as a relationship they're connected with it amen and and god is warning us and paul is trying to tell us how we can be free from these strongholds and it don't just stop with paul i got a old testament scripture here i'll share with you in a moment but but the the devil likes to use these demonic influences to to bring an affliction and an oppression on us because the prophet said uh christians are not possessed with the devil but they can be oppressed by the devil and afflicted by demon spirits and you look at both words they're almost saying you can be possessed but these are demons that will torment you and come after you and bother you all the time they follow you around waiting on opportunities to get on you every single day they do this of course this is this is proven in the old testament the bible says that when the devil came to job he said i've been traveling to and fro he's looking for someone to oppress and afflict and he found the believer and so god said you consider my servant job yes i want to afflict him and oppress him but he couldn't possess it because if he could have possessed me to kill him so the oppression in the affliction is possible for him to do to all of us because we're all god's sons and daughters and the church said so he's always trying to do this that was a young man i'll tell you this story and try to shoot through it uh where's your clock at brother oh it's 8 54. i see it i'll stop here in a minute this young man he doubted god he doubted the existence of god and he didn't know better he was a young man he grew up in a household they didn't pray they didn't acknowledge god at all he heard his dad say a few times ain't no god i'm christian people they're just making all that up so his belief was he didn't really believe that there was a god so he had a good friend of his that invited him to go to a camp meeting it was a christian camp meeting and so he decided well i'm going i'll go because he's a really good friend of his he decided he'd go and he said you know just come you know we're going to do some things that i think you'll like so he went and they flew on a plane to get to the place where everybody was gathering for this camp meeting and so when they got there yes just like he thought there were some things he did that he really enjoyed he was a young adult and they did a lot of things that was was catering to the to the young adult age people there and he was just having a great time but then it come to the worship service and when he went in the worship service he said in the back and he heard the minister say jesus took two fish five loaves of bread and he fed five thousand that thing stayed in a young man's mind so after church the minister went over to him and asked him did he have any questions about the sermon anything he wanted to say he said i don't believe jesus took two fish and five loaves of bread and fed five thousand and he stood there for a moment as if something happened to him and he turned and walked away he never said another word to the minister next day he packed up he left got to the airport got on the plane when he got on the plane he had this very bad headache in his head it was so bad that the more the plane flew and vibrated it got worse and worse and worse it got so bad he began to squench and he was didn't know what to do so god when he said that his mind went back to what he said to the minister i don't believe jesus took two fish follows the bread fit five thousand hold up let me see god i repent i do believe jesus took two fish and five loaves of bread and fed five thousand as soon as he said it the pain left him he had took on a spirit of unbelief that was so bad that in front of a preacher he denied the word of god and this spirit was on him but he what he didn't know is when he got on when he was leaving the minister got together with some of the church members and say i feel that they pray for that young man because right in front of me a demon spirit possessed him this is a true story another pastor told it and that young man was telling everybody he saw on that plane jesus took two fish and five loaves of bread and he fed five thousand what unbelief was gone he now believed the word it was a stronghold in him he was determined not to believe but thank god for the word it pulled down the stronghold but it taught him a lesson amen you got to know when you're listening to the word of god don't let nobody influence you if you think that devil even try to make you doubt that's the devil amen cast him down hey man let me wrap this thing up everybody all right amen the spirit of unbelief is a very powerful thing in some people's lives and as believers we don't think we have nothing to do with that but but see we have to really be careful because unbelief follows everybody it's a demon spirit it's actually sin but it's also a demon spirit it's an unclean spirit in the church say amen it gets a tight grip on some people and no matter how much you try to show them the way i tell them the truth they will not they will not come to it they can't come out of it see they have a blocked channel see that's the first thing we're going to have block channel second thing is they're under the influence of an unclean spirit because no one in their righteous mind would reject the truth especially proclaiming to be children of god everybody follow that now before i close i was going to talk about so i think i'll skip this i wanted something i want to get to let me read this quote to you here the conflict between god and satan because it's a war we're in right see now what is the word of god the word of god is god himself now if you let that go over your head too quickly you'll think you caught it but the prophet god is trying to show us something the word of god is god himself this is the authority of god it's the power of god is in his word it was only intended for believers to handle it not everybody can handle this word correctly so he says it's god himself so god gave the believers himself amen he says it's god himself he gave the believers himself to attack the enemy by in other words he's the father and the word is god then the word is our father we're born by the word and he's standing in the uh and he's standing in the forefront for his children amen there you are he's standing out there for his children see i like the picture like this god never lost the battle i heard y'all singing here up in miami jack got up there was singing this is how i fight my battle and jack picked up the bible he was adamant about pushing the bible out look at that demonstration this is how i fight my battle this is how we fight our battle but you ain't gonna always have this with you okay then he's preaching now if it ain't in you that song ain't gonna help you at all you can't shout and get this and be victorious you this these strongholds don't go away just because you sing a good song they don't go away just because you heard a good sermon i just told you what the young man said at the church service to his pastor these strongholds need something more more powerful now it's not that the word is not that the preacher wasn't preaching one powerful no it needed a lived voice it was looking for somebody who had the word with skin on it it was looking for a person that was real it wasn't just a talk offense but it was a manifestation right before him he was looking for something real and when he stepped in now you say well wasn't the pastor real yet but those are church services everybody sitting there has to be sort of respectful at that moment in time this man was possessed with many spirits he had many strongholds who would have ever thought but seeing a man living clean and pure to the glory of god would be the the delivering power that called him out of that sinful condition god used it that way he said yeah he heard the preaching he heard all the singing yeah he heard it but i'm gonna put a real living example in front of him i let him criticize it i'm gonna let him tell him it's not the right message it's not the right voice i found errors in it didn't move it all right amen don't sound right prophecies were wrong one correct wasn't there when the cloud showed up all kinds of accusations didn't move it finally had to give in that's why we ain't moved yet that's why your pastor's still standing here preaching it that's why he's still keeping you up on that we're not moving amen those are taking scales away from this here we know this is it amen we were delivered from the strongholds they're still battling the strongholds amen so if you don't move the strongholds in them will finally be delivered from them if they are seed don't let them move you don't be afraid it is jesus be not afraid amen there you are he's standing out there for his children what are we scared about don't you know fear is a stronghold don't be scared it'll get on you i heard a young lady giving a testimony of of of something that was it wasn't positive it was kind of negative and she was trying to say why she had problems still believing the message and i don't like to really get up and talk about this but i thought there was a unique little testimony she was sharing and one thing she said is she says i i don't mean to be negative toward it but god i just couldn't see it being altogether the truth and i just listened to her he said the reason i couldn't believe it anymore is because i did some research once she said she did some research i knew what happened to her same thing happened to eve her research reasoned her her true faith away right out of her out of her heart that's why the problem said if you look for something criticized we can all do that i can stand up here and give y'all eight straight and i ain't exaggerating eight straight hours of negative things i read on the internet about this message you'll get tired of me you'll be like jackie stop him from preaching he's killing my belief system i know all that stuff's out there read every article everything out there i've seen it heard and read it and it still didn't move me you know why didn't move me because when it's revealed to you you can't be moved it's when you don't have a real revelation that you can be moved [Applause] you can't be guessing at this it's either right or wrong it ain't both [Music] but when you don't have if god have not given to you okay well put it to you like he told jeremiah jackson they could put this on the board i'll sit down cause i ain't gonna get to give me jeremiah chapter one all right now watch i'm gonna be doing i'm done i gotta even finish this because it's too much i want oil to read this with me and i'll sit down i'll read that last quote and sit down he says here don't have it turn to it in the bible jeremiah chapter one just start at the well let's start at the ninth verse let's do the ninth verse he says then the lord put forth his hand and touch what my mouth and the lord said unto me behold i have put my in your so god put a weapon in the prophet's mouth and when he put it in his mouth this is what he said to do with it watch watch what the word gonna do give me verse 10. i'm going to preach it and sit down see i have this day set thee over the nation over the kingdom to root out all right see when paul got it paul said that whether our warfare are not caught by the mighty through god for the pulling down of the strongholds jeremiah said to root out see when you pull something out by the root you kill it completely so the word the weapon in the prophet's mouth was to root out all the unbelief kill all of the other influences of system beliefs that were out there it had to be that way because if you hold on to any of it any bit of it it'll still cause weeds to grow then he says to root out and to pull down paul caught it right right paul knew what he was preaching and to pull down what and to destroy watch what god do after he get all that out of you and to throw down then what he's gonna do to build it back up and plant the right thing in your heart can't put the right thing in to get the wrong thing out and some people never let it all come out and while you're trying to get the right stuff in it some stuff should need to be rooted out strongholds that you're still holding on to beliefs that you're still holding on to and god said i gave jeremiah word go find it i said where is it at and the holy ghost led me there i put my word in your mouth jeremiah was speaking with a weapon they couldn't handle it god said it's going to root out some stuff pull down some strongholds destroy that sin nature so when the prophet came on the scene they didn't understand what god put in his mouth it was tearing them down rooting up some stuff then god says i'm gonna have you climb seven steps to perfection and i'mma build you up into a statue of a perfect man and that really threw some people off but it's still right here in the bible brother branham just said it differently root out a total separation from all unbelief you read the messages if you're not read that root out pull down what the systems indoctrination of other belief systems put in all of us if we went to them churches false son holy ghost speaking of tongue evidence pull it down get that out of you i'm gonna put the i'm gonna put i'm gonna put something in here build it up real good people see you they're gonna see a walking sermon what do you think the man seen in the testimony brother venom gay he saw a walking sermon amen it was so powerful the man he said nothing to him he was making fun of the man man they said the word sister burroughs but he was listening to the sermon the whole time every step he took amen holy holy holy unto the lord holy steps man watched holy steps so much he became holy himself i know this work but can the bride that say that abroad today live this out or you're sitting there thinking i got stronghold oh no i'm just i don't know if you're thinking like that you hinder yourself you'll never grow and you'll sit you'll come for years in the church i have these strongholds and there's a lot of them i was going to cover this personal that we have in our personal lives it covers everything the things that we do the secret sins the hitting sins the stuff that we don't want nobody to know that we hope nobody ever finds out about strongholds it's got to be pulled down brother only one weapon is capable of doing that now you know brother branham said that the holy ghost was a weapon he even said your prayer is a weapon but as he concluded in 1962 uh put on the whole arm of god he said the word it's a powerful weapon the reason he anchored it on that because when you hear the word preach it right i don't care what kind of thing is holding you down that word comes and the holy spirit follows the word and it comes right where you are in that stronghold condition hidden don't want nobody to know but the word finds you sitting right there and you didn't tell nobody but all of a sudden god said this is your day of deliverance and you are coming out of it that's why no way give me birth okay don't putting that nails up that'll be up here too long but god knows every single one of us and what our stronghold is your block channels and all these things that that we deviate from yeah and it may not be anyone in here but i still have to say it because the longer we're in this thing the more of a battle we're going to have to fight because you're going to get challenged every step of the way would you stand on your feet with me i'm going to close see if i read conflict part the second quote from conflict or the last quote so the infinite god is going to choose for his army the best weapon that could be given and he choose it and it was his word god gave his army the best equipment that could ever that it could ever use and ever could use and would never have to be changed it's his word and he said well we hear that all the time the word the word the word the word the word the word but in this it's not just word only god is pouring out the holy ghost in the end time on this bride on the believers of this day that's a spirit come to make this word come to life you can keep this word on your tongue you can meditate on this day and night you can use this in any situation any situation i don't care what it is you can use it but you got to know how to use and don't be afraid when you use it stand there our testimony i when we speak it we don't even doubt y'all remember when the walls fell down the front walls of the building we were building it up and the walls fell down i walked out there a tornado came through there and one of the members called me and said brother on the wood oh the walls fell down now when she first told me i had to i had to rebuke this sister because she almost gave me a heart attack she said all the walls were down but when i got there was just the front walls i said sister please give the messages by phone correctly you you you don't know what i mean i was so shook but when i got there said lord please don't let all the walls be down that was over about 8 000 bricks if that whole thing would have fell down and how we got there was the front wall so i got up there i walked on top of them like i was walking over to mount carmel somewhere and i stood there i said it shall go back up and god told me when you sent out the scripture in ezekiel you said you were going to rebuild the wall that was broken down you spoke it and it manifested you sent out the wrong scripture this is a true story in the right sister pam i had to tell the church i did say we are going to rebuild the wall that was broken down now if god can honor that much of me speaking the word [Music] and listen in 24 hours someone sent me the money and we built the wall right back up amen so i said now that scripture is fulfilled what do you want me to do next the in saint mark 16 the prophecy i didn't understand it so i couldn't preach it it'll be as you say i think mark 11. right he said he'd understand so i'd never preached on it because i didn't fully understand it while he was out hunting now this is what he said he's out hunting he hadn't shot a squirrel didn't even see one and god told him well you're hunting you have need of game it's and he told him what the scripture and saint mark was all about he said but i never understood that so god says telling me keep trying to make you see it what do you want you have neither game what do you want now look at the significance of this it'll be like you say what do you want the first one god never told him where to say it he was teaching the prophet that we have the power and the authority in us the spoken word ability to speak the word brother branham said this is not just for me he said this is for all who believe it's in the word brothers and sisters but there's a spirit that we already have received if you receive the spirit that's here to make it work but if you have fear you'll fail and the prophet of god said you can't you can't pretend faith because your subconscious will tell whether you really have it or not because your subconscious is where you truly believe amen and so he pushed the prophet beyond his fears and he finally caught the revelation not all of his fears he wasn't fearing god but what he didn't know about that verse and there it was he'll do the same thing for you and i in any situation can you just believe that tonight that our god can't fail his word is perfect he taught the prophet that this is wrote around testimony i'm just trying to keep it in the proper way he said it but when he caught that you couldn't stop him that was the second speaking of squirrels y'all know the story right god is good pray with me so i'm sorry so infinite god is going to choose his army the best weapon that he could be given and he chose it and it was his word about yes with me father we thank you for the word tonight and i know this sermon is much longer than i intended to be and we just caught this inspiration to come here tonight we just thank you god that our strongholds can be pulled down we are in a stronghold battle all of us we deal with these issues every day and all of these examples that we could have said i believe the church sees it this is a mature audience mostly adults here not many children and god you know why you had it said you know why you wanted these things spoken you've helped me through my life i pray your help our brothers and sisters that are sitting here tonight and outstanding they have any strongholds in their lives that they will know that it can be pulled down the weapon on themselves go to the pastor if they don't know the right way the right approach to it because we can't hide these things we want to be right we want to be free you don't want to give the devil any access into the holy temple of god not on purpose if you have done that and if there are some things in your life i want you to listen you can go free from those things right now you don't have to leave here even if it was a wednesday night this could be your time i said god i have strongholds there's things that i i've been dealing with there's things i i'm i'm dealing with right now and i try to get away from him and it comes back and i i'll go good for a week or two and it'll come back and i keep second guessing my faith and you don't have to do that brothers you don't have to do that anymore sister have faith in god these holy scriptures this word is so true [Music] these things are so real this is for the elect of this age i don't mean for that to sound prejudiced against any other churches it's not intended for that but god knew who would and who would not thank god that he chose you lord jesus keep the spirit and true family so united together protect this church its ministry this pastor this staff the ministers and all the congregation that have been so faithful over the years special people in the audience who i dearly love because they they've proven to be faithful and sincere and i believe they love us back keep them god the best is still yet to come stay united together church whole to the word of god and if you're struggling with that stronghold right now in jesus name i pray it'll be broken off of you right now whatever it is unbelief because the devil use every device he has against us and every vice that he can put on us to keep us bound in unbelief while we yet sit in church come out of it in the name of jesus i i give you your freedom in the name of jesus christ i bind and break and destroy and pull down god put it in jeremiah's mouth the word to do it so the servants of god today we pull it down in the name of cast it down in the name of jesus that stronghold that that influence we pull it down in the name of jesus it won't hold you no longer god's breaking it right now have faith in god he's breaking that stronghold he's tearing it down he's destroying it as he told jeremiah god don't send a word just to play and tickle our ears it's designed to have an effect on the receiving part of the audience which is you so in the name of jesus receive what god has for you tonight be not afraid be not afraid god is with you father i thank you for giving me the opportunity to be in this fastest church and greet this portion of your bride represented here in south florida thank you for such a solid ministry and i know they have their testing trials but i can see the hand of god moving over these people and working through them just by how they came out here tonight thank you dear lord and may this blessing remain with this church that they will know the power of god is here the presence of god is here that we're one together as one family of god with the spirit of truth family tabernacle god bless you brothers and sisters and if you can applaud the holy spirit as your parents to come thank you for allowing me to speak to you tonight thank you for taking the time out of your schedules during the week to be here this evening god bless you come on pastor jay that's a little song that says let me see if i can get it mr rebecca you might be able to play it you see i want to sing that i just love the lord this song says jesus you are the love of my life and jesus you are the hope that i cling to you mean more than this whole world too man and he says i wouldn't trade you for silver ago [Music] i wouldn't trade you for rich's son [Music] and i just love that because i know now how important it is how important jesus is to me it didn't take my experience a few months ago but it certainly helped i love him too much to fail him now i love him too much to break my vow i promise you lord that i'm gonna hold on and make it somehow and i know how the overcoming power of this word doubles praise the lord appreciate brother joe tonight just sharing his heart with us and um i don't think god has things to be said on a whim i think god has he's perfect in all his ways and he knows exactly what needs to be said and when it needs to be said you know he knows who needs to hear it and um i just love the way that the holy spirit just tells you know we we can come to church we can and he said smile with our eyes because we got the mask on our face right but uh but god knows the things that we're dealing with as we leave the building and god wants to set us free from every stronghold uh i think brother branham talked about how he went to the cincinnati zoo and it just just troubled him uh to see this eagle just caged up and all often times the kate the eagle would try to get out of the cage and lift so high and it hit the top of the cage and have to come back down and this is what happens to god's eagles they get to a certain spot they get so high and then the enemy just brings them right back down but as an eagle that's not your position is to be down your position is to be up and flying above the problem flying above the stronghold and and i believe the power of the word of god that has been given to us tonight is enough to overcome every devil if we'll just use it the way god has intended for us to use it i thought about the woman at the well and she had so many strongholds in her life but when she heard christ with the word she was set free from every stronghold i found out this week that sometimes when uh god is speaking it's not just for people that are here in this building it's people that's watching online and uh we don't know who and where but i know this word has power to even go through the airwaves and set captures free you've been in this place long enough your mountain sign has been rough the struggle is over for you [Music] hallelujah you are [Music] whatever you've been going through god says the struggle is over for you i believe that tonight see you been in this place long enough your mountainside it has been rough but the struggle is over for you come on let's sing it one more time oh wherever you are hallelujah whatever you've been going through hallelujah god says [Music] the struggle is over for you you see you've been in this place long enough and your mountainside it has been rough but the struggle is over for you the struggle is [Music] day the over is over for you the struggle is over i know it is the struggle is over for you the struggle is over hey the struggle is over for you the struggle is over oh yes it is the struggle is over for you say my struggle is over yes my struggle is over oh for me my struggle is over well the struggle is over see you've been in this place long enough your mountainside it has been rough the struggling over for you i want to sing it again see you've been in this place long enough your mountainside it has been rough but tonight the struggle is over for you [Music] father we heard the word of god tonight and we know the word has power to change any of our circumstances and situations no matter what it is that we've been facing and no matter how long we've been facing it i believe the holy spirit is here to pull down every stronghold of the enemy and it only comes through the power of the word god that's what we have to use to overcome when when jesus was tempted uh god their amount temptation he used the power of the word no supernatural strength it kept using it is written it is written it is written god i pray that somebody tonight will drive a stake down and let the devil know it's written it's written it's written concerning me i am a son of god i refuse to live beneath my privileges i am a daughter of god i refuse to live beneath my privileges i'm gonna be all that god has called me to be god may they drive the straight the stake down here tonight but they confess on their own mouth lord that this struggle is over this stronghold is broken it's pulled down it's rooted up oh my it's cast down god it's i mean lord you're gonna rebuild you're gonna replant you're gonna rebuild we thank you for that but but we thank you for the deliverance that happens before that we don't have to feel it to believe it all we got to do is agree with the word of god and let the word enforce the claim that has been written over our life thank you for your servant lord just coming and depositing this word into our spirits tonight god i know it was for purpose it was for a reason i know it god and i thank you lord that he got himself out of the way to speak to our hearts tonight i know that there will be changes in the lives of the people those present and those that are streaming god we just give you glory we give you honor and we give you praise for the work that you have done in this place tonight we declare in the name of the lord jesus christ the stronghold is broken and the struggle is over in jesus christ's name we say it amen amen amen let's give the lord a hand of praise tonight hallelujah you can be seated in the
