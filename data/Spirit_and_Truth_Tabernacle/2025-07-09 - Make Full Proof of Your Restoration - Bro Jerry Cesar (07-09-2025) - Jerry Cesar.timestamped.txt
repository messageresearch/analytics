[11:07] [Music]
[11:18] There's another
[11:21] God bless you. Let's bow on a word of
[11:23] prayer.
[11:26] Oh heavenly father,
[11:28] we just thank you Lord God for what you
[11:30] did for us Lord. Oh father when we sing
[11:34] this song Lord we can we can say it's
[11:36] personal because Lord if you did not get
[11:40] crucified Lord if you did not shed your
[11:42] blood father Lord our past would not be
[11:45] erased. And God, we just thank you,
[11:47] Lord, that we can walk forward, Lord,
[11:50] knowing that we don't have to look
[11:51] backwards, but we can look to Calvary.
[11:54] And Father God, you have assembled your
[11:57] people here tonight, Lord, because your
[11:59] blood has made us whole. Your blood has
[12:02] made us perfect. Whatever the situation
[12:05] is tonight, Lord, your blood has settled
[12:07] it. And Lord, we thank you, God, that
[12:10] you would look upon us, Father, that we
[12:14] would mean more to you than your own
[12:15] blood. Lord, we just thank you for that,
[12:18] God. Lord, we just pray that you would
[12:20] have your way this evening, Lord. Visit
[12:23] us, Lord, in a special way as you
[12:25] visited your children in the cool of the
[12:27] day, Father. God, I pray have the
[12:30] preeminence, Lord. Lord, may you drop a
[12:33] word, Father, that would minister to the
[12:35] hearts of your people, Lord. Lord God,
[12:37] you've ordained this day, Lord. And we
[12:40] heard it on Sunday, Father. You work in
[12:42] the way that's predestinated, Lord. You
[12:44] predestinated this service. So, Father,
[12:47] we thank you, Lord, for the
[12:48] predestinated word this evening.
[12:50] And God, we just want to commit all
[12:52] things into your precious hands. In the
[12:54] name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray.
[12:56] Amen.
[12:58] Praise the Lord. Thank you, musicians.
[13:03] God richly bless you. I greet you all in
[13:06] the precious name of the Lord Jesus
[13:08] Christ.
[13:10] Uh it is truly a honor and privilege to
[13:14] be here tonight.
[13:15] Amen.
[13:16] Uh so this evening we want to just turn
[13:18] our Bibles to the book of Luke.
[13:27] Praise the Lord. Uh I do apologize. My
[13:31] computer just froze on me.
[13:34] Um, give me just one moment.
[13:39] Amen.
[13:45] Praise God.
[13:48] I did bring a backup. So, let me get my
[13:51] backup.
[13:57] In the name of the Lord.
[14:08] Uh Luke chapter 6 verse 45.
[14:14] Praise the Lord.
[14:16] And it reads, "A good man out of the
[14:19] good pleasure of his heart bringeth
[14:21] forth that which is good. And an evil
[14:24] man out of the evil treasure of his
[14:27] heart bringeth forth that which is evil.
[14:31] For of the abundance of the heart, his
[14:33] mouth speaketh. And why call ye me Lord,
[14:38] Lord, and do not the things that I say?
[14:41] Whosoever cometh to me and heareth my
[14:44] sayings and do witheth them, I will show
[14:47] you to whom he is like, he is like a man
[14:50] which built an house, and dig deep, and
[14:52] laid the foundation on a rock. And when
[14:55] the flood arose, the stream beat
[14:58] vehemently upon that house, and could
[15:00] not shake it, for it was founded upon a
[15:03] rock. But he that heareth and doeth not
[15:06] is like a man that without a foundation
[15:08] built an house upon the earth against
[15:11] which the L against which the stream did
[15:13] beat vehicently and immediately it fell
[15:16] and the ruin of that house was great.
[15:19] Praise God. May the Lord add a blessing
[15:21] to his reading. You may all have your
[15:23] seats.
[15:28] I want to read another scripture
[15:30] and want to turn to Malachi.
[15:33] Very familiar scripture to you all I
[15:35] trust. Malachi chapter 4 verses 5 and 6.
[15:41] And it reads, "Behold, I will send you
[15:45] Elijah the prophet before the coming of
[15:48] the great and dreadful day of the Lord.
[15:51] and he shall turn the heart of the
[15:53] fathers to the children and the heart of
[15:55] the children to their fathers, lest I
[15:58] come and smite the earth with a curse.
[16:01] Praise the Lord. So this evening I just
[16:03] want to speak on a little thought the
[16:06] Lord uh inspired me with um
[16:10] just over um just over the different
[16:13] messages we've heard. Uh I had other
[16:16] things that I was studying but but this
[16:18] seemed to come uh pretty sudden. Uh but
[16:22] the title tonight is make full proof of
[16:24] your restoration.
[16:27] Make full proof of your restoration.
[16:30] And we just want to work with that um
[16:33] making full proof for a while for a
[16:35] little bit and and just kind of break
[16:36] that down. Um so the word proof it it
[16:40] means in the evidence that something is
[16:43] true. Um that's what that word means. Um
[16:47] and when you think about um when you
[16:51] think about looking at a tree for
[16:53] example uh you can take a apple tree and
[16:56] the evidence that makes that apple tree
[16:59] true is that it bears forth apples. If
[17:02] you look at a mango tree the evidence
[17:03] that makes that tree true is that it
[17:06] bears forth mangoes.
[17:08] Is that right? So a tree is known by the
[17:12] fruit that it bears. Praise the Lord. So
[17:15] we we've been talking about the
[17:16] restoration of the bride tree. So when
[17:19] you look at what makes the bride tree
[17:21] true, the evidence is the restoration of
[17:24] the bride tree. So the the evidence the
[17:28] proof is evidence that something the
[17:29] evidence that something is true. The
[17:32] other another definition we can use too
[17:34] is proof is something that is able to
[17:36] withstand or uh resist. uh is when
[17:40] you're able to withstand something
[17:41] danger uh that is either damaging or
[17:44] something that's in danger or something
[17:46] that you can resist.
[17:47] Praise the Lord. So for example, if you
[17:50] take uh take something that's
[17:52] waterproof, water, something that's
[17:54] waterproof can resist the water.
[17:56] If you take something that's fireproof,
[17:58] it can resist fire. Praise the Lord. So
[18:02] if you take something that's restoration
[18:04] proof, then that means that you should
[18:06] be able to resist what you were restored
[18:09] from. Is that right?
[18:11] Praise the Lord.
[18:12] And tonight, we just want to we just
[18:15] want to uh gear our attention to what it
[18:18] means to be restored,
[18:20] what it means to you. Praise the Lord.
[18:23] And and and you know, when you when you
[18:24] talking about the the not just making
[18:27] proof, but making full proof. So full is
[18:30] something that's complete entire,
[18:33] something that has no empty space,
[18:35] something that has been made whole.
[18:37] Praise the Lord. So if we could put
[18:39] those two thoughts together, uh to make
[18:41] full proof is to make is to have the
[18:44] complete evidence of something, the
[18:46] complete evidence of your restoration.
[18:48] Praise the Lord. And the reason why I
[18:51] can call it either the complete evidence
[18:53] or the complete resistance is because
[18:56] the evidence that you have is that the
[18:59] the the fact that you can resist it is
[19:01] not because that you were restored from
[19:03] the thing, but it's who you were
[19:05] restored to. Praise the Lord.
[19:06] And the power lies in what you were
[19:09] restored to, not what you were restored
[19:11] from.
[19:12] Praise God.
[19:13] So when you've been restored, you have a
[19:16] responsibility.
[19:17] Praise the Lord.
[19:18] Amen. And and our responsibility tonight
[19:21] is we've been under the inspiration of I
[19:24] will restore sayith the Lord. Praise
[19:26] God.
[19:27] And now the purpose of all that is that
[19:30] we would find where our placing is where
[19:32] our position is in that in that title of
[19:35] that that that inspiration of being
[19:37] restored. Praise God.
[19:39] Now it would be uh disappointed at the
[19:42] end of the journey to realize that you
[19:44] didn't do all that you could do. Praise
[19:47] the Lord. So, if if there is anything
[19:49] the Lord requires of you is to go all
[19:52] the way,
[19:53] not halfway, not part way. Praise God.
[19:56] If you want full-time benefits, you're
[19:58] going to have to be a full-time
[20:00] believer.
[20:01] Praise the Lord. And God expects you to
[20:03] go all the way. Amen.
[20:05] Amen.
[20:06] The prophet says this here in the
[20:08] message, perfect strength by perfect
[20:10] weakness. He says, there's one thing
[20:13] that we've got to master. Not two, not
[20:16] three, one thing that we've got to
[20:18] master if we expect to fulfill God's
[20:21] desire in our lives. That is we have to
[20:24] master the thought of human ability.
[20:27] If we ever get to a spot where we think
[20:30] that we can do it on our own and our own
[20:33] intelligence and our own abilities,
[20:35] we've got to master that in such a way
[20:38] that we can get rid of the thing and lay
[20:40] it aside so that God can use us. Praise
[20:44] the Lord. You see, it's easy to have
[20:46] plans and God might perhaps allow you to
[20:49] execute those plans and you you might
[20:51] even experience some success. Praise the
[20:53] Lord. But you see, at the end, all
[20:56] you'll really experience is waste.
[20:58] Praise the Lord. And God doesn't want
[21:00] you to experience waste. God wants to
[21:02] turn your plans into increase. He wants
[21:05] to turn your plans to his plans. Amen.
[21:07] Yes, sir.
[21:08] Praise the Lord.
[21:09] Thank you, Jesus. And and when you have
[21:10] your plans, when you whatever it is that
[21:12] you desire to do, it's got to be based
[21:15] on the foundation of the word of God.
[21:17] That's the only thing that can stand.
[21:19] Praise God. The prophet goes on to say,
[21:22] make a complete surrender. We cannot use
[21:25] not one ability. We've got to make a
[21:28] complete surrender. And to come to God,
[21:30] you've got to surrender to him. Both
[21:32] soul, body, and spirit. Everything that
[21:35] you are has to be surrendered to God in
[21:38] order that he can work his will in you
[21:41] and in me.
[21:43] Now he says now that's hard. I know cuz
[21:46] we're always wanting to put our part in
[21:50] something that we know. We know that we
[21:52] want to do it well. I just know it
[21:54] should be done this way. But as long as
[21:56] you're going about it this way, it's
[21:58] going to be wrong. God will never use
[22:01] that effort. Praise the Lord. So, it's
[22:04] key and important and pivotal that we
[22:06] always realize that our abilities don't
[22:09] matter to God.
[22:10] Amen. God doesn't need our help to
[22:13] fulfill his promises in our lives.
[22:15] Praise the Lord. God just wants us a
[22:18] surrendered heart to what he's doing in
[22:20] this very hour.
[22:22] He wants to make you the best version of
[22:24] you in every season. Praise the Lord.
[22:27] When you go to work, he wants to make
[22:29] you the best employee. when you go at
[22:31] home, he wants to make you the best man
[22:33] or the best woman. Praise the Lord.
[22:35] And you know, the last time I checked,
[22:37] he knew you before you knew you. Praise
[22:39] God. So, he wants you to make you the
[22:42] best version of yourself.
[22:44] And the only way that will happen is
[22:46] when you come to a complete surrender.
[22:48] Praise the Lord.
[22:51] Make full proof of what God is doing in
[22:53] your life.
[22:55] Praise God.
[22:57] Now, I'm always thinking about our young
[22:59] people and uh just want to just want to
[23:03] take a moment to uh lay some things
[23:05] down. It'll minister to us all, but
[23:07] certainly had the young people in mind
[23:10] as as I was studying this. So, we want
[23:12] to just turn to Luke 15 11.
[23:16] Praise the Lord.
[23:20] And it reads,
[23:23] this is talking about
[23:25] the story with the with the two sons. It
[23:27] says, "He said, a certain man had two
[23:30] sons, and the younger of them said to
[23:33] his father, father, give me the portions
[23:36] of goods that fallth to me, and he
[23:38] divided unto him his living." And young
[23:42] people, I just want you to understand
[23:44] that your parents, they they have
[23:46] accumulated what I can say according to
[23:49] the scripture is they've accumulated
[23:51] portions of goods for you, right?
[23:53] They've accumulated not just financial
[23:55] goods, but spiritual goods, emotional
[23:58] goods, natural goods. Praise the Lord.
[24:01] And if I could say it like this, do do
[24:04] not waste your goods. Praise the Lord.
[24:07] All the things that your parents has
[24:08] invested in your life are a portion of
[24:11] goods and do not waste those goods. And
[24:14] and and if I could even go further,
[24:16] don't give your goods to the devil.
[24:18] Right? Because the devil wants all that
[24:21] you have. Praise the Lord. And and all
[24:24] he wants to do is destroy it.
[24:26] Amen. It goes on to say, "And uh not
[24:29] many days after the younger son gathered
[24:33] all together and took his journey into a
[24:36] far country and there wasted his
[24:39] substance with riotist living." Praise
[24:42] the Lord. And I just want to stop there
[24:44] for a moment and say it it's it's
[24:47] something that when you are when when
[24:49] you were close to home, this young man
[24:52] uh when he gathered all of his goods, he
[24:54] decided that he was going to go a far
[24:56] and maybe he thought to himself he could
[24:58] get away with some things because he's
[25:00] further from home. Praise the Lord. And
[25:02] and there because of his environment,
[25:05] because of where he what he was
[25:07] disconnected from, he wasted all of his
[25:09] substance. Amen. and and and the the
[25:12] things that your parents go through to
[25:14] be who you are in this hour, to be under
[25:16] the the the ministry. Amen. All these
[25:19] things is so that you can have a
[25:21] sustainable life spiritually.
[25:24] Praise the Lord. Not just naturally.
[25:26] Your health is important, but your soul
[25:29] has to prosper spiritually.
[25:32] Amen. And and you see he went to a far
[25:35] journey, a far country and is that is
[25:37] where he raced all the things that that
[25:39] that that that he decided that he took
[25:41] away from home. Amen. And and you see
[25:44] the thing about when you are a believer,
[25:47] you must be careful young people how far
[25:50] you want to go.
[25:51] Right? Because one thing that's
[25:53] important, you'll never know how far is
[25:55] too far.
[25:56] Amen. But I'll tell you, who knows how
[25:58] far is too far? The devil. The devil
[26:01] knows how far is too far. Praise the
[26:03] Lord. And and and you see, he'll make
[26:05] you go further than you want to go.
[26:07] Amen.
[26:08] So he goes on to say that
[26:10] when um he he basically subs righteous
[26:13] living. Verse 14. And when he had spent
[26:16] all, there arose a mighty famine in that
[26:20] land and he began to be in want. And
[26:23] when it couldn't get any worse, it just
[26:25] got worse.
[26:26] Amen. And and he goes on and it says,
[26:29] "And he went and joined himself to a
[26:31] citizen of that country, and he sent
[26:34] into him, you know, he sent him into his
[26:36] fields to feed swine, and he would have
[26:40] fain have filled his belly with the husk
[26:42] that the swine did eat, and no man gave
[26:45] unto him." Praise God. You see, it's a
[26:48] sad situation when you um when you try
[26:52] to uh replace uh what you have for for
[26:55] for something less. The the prophet
[26:57] said, "A hungry man will eat from a
[26:59] garbage can." Amen. And you see, if I
[27:02] could encourage you, young people, don't
[27:03] leave the overflow for less than crumbs.
[27:07] Amen. I'm going to say that again. Don't
[27:08] leave the overflow for less than crumbs.
[27:12] Amen. And you know, at least the crumbs
[27:14] are supernatural.
[27:16] Amen. And you go, you you know what I'm
[27:18] talking about when I say supernatural
[27:19] crumbs. But when you when you accept
[27:21] less than crumbs, it shows that what
[27:24] you're identifying with. And this young
[27:26] man had no identity. It was so bad that
[27:30] he lost the sense of who he was, the the
[27:33] purpose that he had in life.
[27:35] Amen. And it all started because he was
[27:37] in the wrong environment at the wrong
[27:39] time. Amen. And he was left with
[27:41] nothing. And that's what the enemy wants
[27:43] to do. He wants to strip you of
[27:44] everything that you have.
[27:46] Amen.
[27:47] But you see the story doesn't stop
[27:49] there. In verse 17, it says, "And when
[27:51] he came to himself," Yes,
[27:53] sir. He said, "How many hired servants
[27:56] of my fathers have bread enough to
[27:58] spare?" Amen. And I perish with hunger.
[28:02] He decided, I will arise and go to my
[28:05] father and will say unto him, Father, I
[28:07] have sinned against heaven and before
[28:10] thee. A he says, I am and I am no more
[28:13] worthy to be called thy son. Make me as
[28:16] one of thy hired servants. Praise God.
[28:19] And I like this this the decision this
[28:21] man made because no matter what your
[28:24] situation is, the power to arise is
[28:26] within you. Amen. I'm going say it
[28:28] again. The power to arise is within you.
[28:31] Amen. It's not something God has to do.
[28:34] God does not have to go back to Calvary
[28:36] so you can get back up. Amen. I'm going
[28:38] to say it again. God does not have to go
[28:40] back to Calvary so you can get back up.
[28:43] Amen. You have the power within you to
[28:45] arise from any situation. That's right.
[28:48] The scripture declares, "A just man
[28:50] falls seven times,
[28:52] but he gets up again."
[28:53] Praise the Lord. So, if anybody's down
[28:55] tonight, I encourage you to arise.
[28:58] Hallelujah.
[28:59] Yes, sir.
[29:03] Amen.
[29:04] The prophet says in the message, "If God
[29:06] be with us, then where be all his
[29:07] miracles?" He says, "If you want to see
[29:10] a miracle, become one. Let God work on
[29:14] you first.
[29:16] He's got some overhauling to do, some
[29:19] different lenses to put over your eyes
[29:21] because you are blind, dead in sins and
[29:24] trespasses, spiritually blind, double
[29:26] dead, right? God has to give you life.
[29:30] Touch your eyes so you can see, perform
[29:32] a miracle and make you a miracle and
[29:35] then you can see the miracle working
[29:37] God. That's the first thing. Praise the
[29:40] Lord. And I just love that because maybe
[29:42] you're looking around you and you
[29:43] realize that this person is successful.
[29:46] This person is is is is progressing.
[29:48] This person is doing very well. And you
[29:51] look at yourself and you realize what am
[29:53] I doing? Amen. But you see, I tell you
[29:56] that God still has a plan.
[29:58] Amen. And part of his plan is for you to
[30:01] become a miracle.
[30:02] And the only way you'll become a
[30:04] miracle, the only way you'll become a
[30:06] miracle is by believing the miracle.
[30:08] Praise the Lord.
[30:09] Yes, sir. And I can imagine this young
[30:12] man going back home now. I can imagine
[30:14] that maybe he uh he's received home by
[30:17] his father. His brother feels a little
[30:19] bit a type of way, but but ultimately
[30:22] maybe his brother had a the bed the
[30:24] bigger room in the house, but this young
[30:26] man now has the biggest room. He has a
[30:28] he goes from a queen-sized bed to a
[30:30] king-sized bed. And and maybe he he he
[30:32] he he he took some bread in his
[30:34] possession because of the overflow.
[30:37] Right? So the thing about this young man
[30:39] that I like is he may have lost his
[30:42] inheritance. But he had to accept one
[30:45] thing and that one thing was his
[30:47] position as a son. Amen. He decided that
[30:50] he was going to go back home to as a
[30:52] servant but he had to accept that
[30:55] decision that he was not born as a
[30:58] servant. Amen. He was not predestinated
[31:01] as a servant. Amen. He was predestinated
[31:04] as a son.
[31:05] Amen. And when you experience
[31:06] restoration,
[31:08] restoration is to go back to the same
[31:10] position that you fell from.
[31:12] Praise God.
[31:13] That's right, brother.
[31:14] Amen.
[31:15] And and and you know this young man, he
[31:17] he had the opportunity to to make full
[31:19] proof of what God did in his life. Amen.
[31:22] The prophet says this in the message,
[31:24] come follow me. He says, always
[31:26] remember, keeping the commandments of
[31:29] God is a great thing. Being raised in a
[31:32] good home is a heritage from God. and to
[31:35] be fine kids with personalities as you
[31:38] have good wonderful to have an
[31:40] education. It's wonderful to even live
[31:43] in this free land. We got many things to
[31:46] be thankful for. But there's one thing
[31:48] that you just don't inherit. You've got
[31:51] to accept it. That's eternal life.
[31:54] And you'll only do that by following
[31:56] Jesus by a born again experience. Don't
[31:59] neglect that. Amen. And I encourage our
[32:02] young people, no matter where you find
[32:03] yourself, no matter what situation, no
[32:06] matter the crowd, don't neglect that you
[32:08] have a decision to accept. Amen. And you
[32:11] have the opportunity to make full proof
[32:13] of what God's called you to. Amen. A
[32:16] Christian does what Christ does. A
[32:20] Christian loves like Christ loves, even
[32:22] if your brother hates you. All right?
[32:25] Christian is patient as Christ was
[32:26] patient. A Christian has the the
[32:29] meekness of God even if you're
[32:31] quick-tempered. No matter the situation,
[32:34] God God quickens the word to you so you
[32:37] can be like him. Amen. And and and so
[32:40] much so that God wants your faith to be
[32:42] at a place where it's no longer your
[32:44] faith, but is his faith. It's the very
[32:46] faith of Christ that becomes indwelled
[32:49] in you. Amen. Even if you don't
[32:51] understand it.
[32:53] Praise God. The the prophet says in in
[32:55] paragraph 74, possessing the gates of
[32:58] the enemy, he says Paul said,"None of
[33:00] these things bother me, for he was tied
[33:03] to an absolute, Christ, and every true
[33:07] achievement is tied to an absolute. And
[33:10] my absolute is the word. And everything
[33:12] else, everybody else that's really born
[33:14] of the spirit, their absolute is God's
[33:17] word. I'm tied to it. I laid my hands
[33:20] upon it and it took my place and I've
[33:23] identified myself with him. We knew that
[33:25] he promised to identify himself with us.
[33:28] That brings genuine faith, not your
[33:30] faith, but his faith. Something that you
[33:33] don't control. And I just like that. He
[33:35] says it brings not just your faith, but
[33:38] his faith, something that you don't
[33:40] control. He says he does it. Now, notice
[33:43] that then and only then is the promise
[33:46] made to you. And and I I was just
[33:48] reminded that some someone that was
[33:50] really in a situation they couldn't
[33:52] control, they had no power over is the
[33:55] three Hebrew boys. Amen. They had no
[33:58] control over their situation. Matter of
[34:00] fact, they had power to prevent, but
[34:03] they had no power to control. You see,
[34:05] and and if they decided to ex exercise
[34:08] the their right to to to not go through
[34:11] that fiery furnace, right, they would
[34:13] have they would have violated God's law.
[34:15] they would have served another god.
[34:17] Amen. But they have something within
[34:19] them that uh that even if and I want to
[34:23] echo this to the young people. Always
[34:25] remember that you have an even if.
[34:27] Amen.
[34:28] Always remember you have an even if.
[34:31] Because they took a stand and they they
[34:33] they called they they were called to the
[34:35] king in that time and the king had to
[34:37] question them to confirm whether the
[34:39] accusation was true. And when they came
[34:41] forth to the king, they says, "Yes, O
[34:44] king, it is true. We have not decided to
[34:47] bow down to your God." Amen. But you
[34:50] see, the king had a had a commandment.
[34:53] He had a decree. He said, "If you do not
[34:55] bow down, this will be the
[34:57] consequences." And they knew that. But
[34:59] in the midst in the face of this king,
[35:02] they said, "King, our God is able to
[35:05] deliver us from this situation. But even
[35:08] if he don't,
[35:10] we will still not bow down.
[35:12] That's right.
[35:13] And you see, even if Right, it it it
[35:16] suggests the worst case scenario,
[35:18] right? It it it it puts you in a
[35:20] situation where the very worst can
[35:22] happen. Amen.
[35:24] But but just like we heard the other
[35:26] Sunday, right? Uh uh uh God has a way of
[35:29] and I don't want to get this get this
[35:31] wrong, but he has a way of oneupping the
[35:33] situation. Praise the Lord. Because even
[35:36] when it gets worse,
[35:38] even if
[35:40] God has a way to go even beyond that,
[35:44] amen, you have a even if.
[35:46] And God can go beyond your even if.
[35:50] Praise the Lord.
[35:52] [Music]
[35:54] Not just like this because here we we we
[35:57] find this whole thing played out. Now,
[36:00] these three Hebrew boys, they're in the
[36:02] fire, right? And we'll go to verse 25 in
[36:06] in Daniel chapter uh Daniel chapter 3.
[36:10] It goes on to say, "And he answered,
[36:15] this is the king." Actually, we'll start
[36:16] at verse 24.
[36:18] Uh verse 24, the king says, "Then
[36:20] Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished
[36:24] and rose up in haste and spake and said
[36:27] unto his counselors, "Did not we cast
[36:31] three men bound in the midst of the
[36:33] fire?" They answered and said unto the
[36:37] king, "True, O king." And verse 25, it
[36:42] says, "He answered and says,"Lo, I see
[36:45] four men loose."
[36:47] All right,
[36:48] walking in the midst of the fire. And
[36:49] and I just want to stop at that word
[36:51] loose.
[36:53] Because you see, he he he said there
[36:56] were bound three men that were bound in
[36:59] the fire.
[37:00] But his testimony had to change. Amen.
[37:04] Because now he says we see four men
[37:07] loose.
[37:08] Praise the Lord. So you see when you're
[37:10] in the right company or if I could this
[37:12] when God is in your company you can
[37:15] experience to be loose.
[37:17] It doesn't matter the situation.
[37:19] Right? Even if you're bound, you can be
[37:23] loose.
[37:24] Praise God. Amen.
[37:25] And you see it it proved that that that
[37:29] that they have to they have to testify
[37:31] that the very Hebrew boy's testimony.
[37:33] And it goes on to say that then King
[37:36] Nebuchadnezzar came near.
[37:39] Uh do a pause. I'm going to finish
[37:40] reading verse 25. It says, "And he said,
[37:43] lo, I see four men loose walking in the
[37:46] midst of the fire, and they have no
[37:48] hurt. In the form of the fourth is like
[37:51] the son of God." Then Nebuchadnezzar
[37:54] came near to the mouth of the burning
[37:56] fiery furnace and spake and said,
[37:58] "Sadrach, Meach, and Abednego, ye
[38:01] servants of the most high God, come
[38:03] forth and come hither." Then Shadrach,
[38:06] Meach, and Abedneo came forth out of the
[38:09] midst of the fire. Praise the Lord. And
[38:12] verse 27, it says, "And the princes,
[38:15] governors, and captains, and the king's
[38:18] counselors being gathered together saw
[38:22] these men." Now, I just want to take a
[38:24] moment to really uh uh uh picture this
[38:26] moment that's happening. It goes to say,
[38:29] "Upon whose bodies the fire had no
[38:32] power, nor was in hair of their head
[38:36] seen, neither were the their coats
[38:39] changed, nor the smell of fire had
[38:41] passed on them."
[38:43] Praise the Lord. And I just want you to
[38:45] notice that there was absolutely no
[38:48] proof
[38:49] that they had been in the fire.
[38:52] There was no proof, no evidence
[38:56] that they were in the fire. And then I
[38:58] can go further. The only proof that they
[39:00] had is that they had been restored.
[39:03] That was the only proof.
[39:05] So the proof, there was no tangible
[39:07] proof, but the proof was restoration.
[39:10] Amen. The fact that they were in the
[39:12] fire is the only way that they know that
[39:14] they were now restored back to their
[39:16] position.
[39:17] And you see, they weren't just restored.
[39:19] If we go on to the story, you'll if you
[39:21] read it, you'll see that at the very
[39:22] last verse there, it says that they got
[39:24] a promotion.
[39:26] So you see, when you were restored,
[39:28] you'll restore with better. Amen. You
[39:31] don't ever experience restoration with a
[39:33] demotion.
[39:34] You experience restoration with
[39:36] promotion.
[39:38] Praise the Lord. With promotion,
[39:43] with increase,
[39:45] with overflow. Praise the Lord. Yes.
[39:49] And that was their testimony.
[39:51] They experienced a promotion.
[39:53] My God.
[39:54] Because of their faithfulness to God.
[39:56] Yes, sir.
[39:57] Praise the Lord.
[39:58] Glory.
[39:58] And I just I just like this because one
[40:02] of the things that we also have the
[40:03] responsibility to do is when we see our
[40:06] brother or our sister restored,
[40:09] right, there should be no proof of what
[40:11] they've been through. So when we look at
[40:13] them,
[40:14] we can't point to what they were
[40:16] restored from.
[40:17] We have to pray to where they restored
[40:19] to.
[40:20] Praise the Lord.
[40:21] Amen.
[40:24] The only proof that matter is that they
[40:26] were there and now they are here.
[40:29] Praise God.
[40:30] Somewhere between here
[40:33] and there.
[40:35] Praise God.
[40:36] Hallelujah.
[40:37] Glory.
[40:37] So when you see your brothers restored
[40:39] at these meetings,
[40:41] when you see your brothers sitting right
[40:42] next to you,
[40:44] what they've been through, there's no
[40:45] proof. Amen.
[40:46] There's no evidence. Praise the Lord.
[40:49] Because what matters is that they're
[40:50] right beside you.
[40:52] Amen.
[40:53] Glory to God.
[40:56] The prophet says this in the message
[40:58] influence. He says, "And if we take the
[41:02] testimony of being Christians, I think
[41:04] that is one of the most solemn things
[41:07] that a man or woman, boy or girl, could
[41:11] do." Praise God. He says that when he
[41:14] takes on the name of Christ that is that
[41:17] is he is going to be a representative of
[41:20] Christ. You should watch every move you
[41:22] make because somebody is watching you.
[41:25] And in this it reflects what God has
[41:27] done for you inside of you. Praise the
[41:29] Lord. A and we have as a responsibility
[41:32] to be mindful when we are representative
[41:35] of Christ because every action matters.
[41:38] Every situation matters. Praise the
[41:40] Lord. Job 13:15 says, "Though he slay
[41:44] me, yet I will trust him."
[41:48] Amen. But I will maintain my own ways
[41:51] before him, he also shall be my
[41:53] salvation. For an hypocrite shall not
[41:56] come before him. Habach 3:1 17 says,
[42:00] "Although the fig trees shall not
[42:03] blossom, neither shall fruit be in the
[42:06] vines, the labor of our of the olive
[42:08] shall fail, and the field shall not
[42:11] yield no meat. The flock shall be cut
[42:14] off from the fold, and there shall be no
[42:16] herd in the stalls. Yet I will rejoice
[42:20] in the Lord. I will joy in the God of my
[42:22] salvation. The Lord my God is my
[42:25] strength. He will make my feet like his
[42:27] feet. He will make me to walk upon my
[42:30] high places. The chief singer on my
[42:33] stinger stringed instruments. Praise the
[42:35] Lord. So you you have you have in every
[42:39] situation the opportunity to defy it.
[42:42] Praise God. You have the opportunity to
[42:45] to to say to yourself, even if it
[42:48] doesn't play out the way I expected to,
[42:50] I will still praise the Lord. I will
[42:52] still jo have joy in the Lord. Praise
[42:55] the Lord.
[42:56] Because the the the joy of the Lord is
[42:58] greater than your weakness. It's greater
[43:00] than anything that you can go through.
[43:02] Praise God. So just want to continue
[43:04] this thought here and we'll just read um
[43:08] uh Luke chapter 8. So that was to our
[43:12] young people. So you guys are dismissed.
[43:18] Praise the Lord.
[43:19] So Luke chapter 8 verse 38 is what we
[43:23] want to turn to.
[43:24] And in this uh in this uh situ in this
[43:29] story in the word that we we we we see
[43:31] this is a time where Jesus has entered
[43:34] into this country or city and he he he
[43:37] comes in and immediately there's a man
[43:39] that that cries out to him that falls
[43:41] before him and says that uh it says that
[43:45] um that that he's in need. Amen. Uh but
[43:48] but this man he is so possessed of
[43:51] demons. Amen. The demons question Christ
[43:54] and says, "What have we to do with
[43:56] thee?" Amen. And and you know um in this
[44:00] in this in this uh story we see that
[44:03] this man had a a condition that he'd
[44:06] been endured for years. Uh he'd been
[44:08] away from home. He left everything
[44:10] behind and his only habitation was in
[44:13] the tombs. This is this is where he he
[44:16] this is where the devil drove him. And
[44:18] you see the the devil has a way of
[44:20] driving you into some insane places. I
[44:23] don't think he ever imagined that he'd
[44:25] be his habitation would be in the
[44:28] wilderness, right? But this is where he
[44:30] his his his habitation was. Praise God.
[44:33] So in verse 38 it says uh uh now the man
[44:38] of whom the devils were departed
[44:41] besought him that he might be with him,
[44:44] but Jesus sent him away. And this this
[44:48] as this is happening um people is is is
[44:52] hearing all of this that's happening the
[44:53] the the devil's being uh uh cast out of
[44:56] this man and and and he went to the a
[45:00] thing of swine and the swine got choked.
[45:02] But this man at after he had been
[45:04] delivered of this of this devil, he he
[45:07] had the right desire. He had the right
[45:09] uh attitude. He he wanted to follow
[45:12] Christ. Amen. That's what he wanted to
[45:14] do. He wanted to go where Christ went
[45:16] because he realized that there's
[45:18] probably more where that came from.
[45:20] Amen.
[45:20] That's right, brother.
[45:21] But I I just thought it was real
[45:23] interesting what Christ's response was.
[45:25] Amen.
[45:26] It says that now the man of whom the
[45:28] devils were departed besought him and
[45:30] that he might be with him. But Jesus
[45:32] instead of saying follow me, Jesus says
[45:35] send him away saying return to thine
[45:37] house and show how great things God hath
[45:41] done unto thee. Praise the Lord. And I
[45:44] just thought that was remarkable because
[45:47] Jesus sent him away with a specific
[45:51] instruction,
[45:52] right? He he didn't just say, "Return to
[45:54] thy house. You have been made whole." He
[45:57] says, "Return to thine house and show."
[46:00] Right? So So there was a responsibility
[46:02] this man had to to go
[46:05] and and to show the evidence
[46:07] of what happened to him. Amen. and
[46:11] and and and now the evidence was that he
[46:13] was in a he was in a new situation where
[46:16] he was not the same man anymore. Amen.
[46:19] And I just wonder that how many things
[46:22] are being delayed, right? Because maybe
[46:24] we have not returned to certain
[46:26] situations the way God has instructed us
[46:29] to. Praise the Lord. What blessings are
[46:32] being delayed because we have not
[46:33] returned? And you see this man now had a
[46:36] testimony because it wasn't that he just
[46:39] returned, but he had to return and show
[46:42] what God did in his life,
[46:44] right? And he had to he had to go the
[46:47] full nine yards to show that things had
[46:50] been different. Amen. And I just want to
[46:52] encourage you tonight that don't just be
[46:54] restored. Amen. But but make full proof
[46:56] of what God has done for you.
[46:58] Show all the things that God has done.
[47:01] Amen.
[47:02] Praise the Lord. the the the the story
[47:05] goes that the the whole city that he was
[47:07] in was now under expectation for Jesus
[47:11] to come before them. Praise the Lord.
[47:13] And and and it goes to say in in verse
[47:15] 40, "And it came to pass when Jesus
[47:18] returned the people received him gladly
[47:22] for they were all waiting for him." So
[47:24] because of this man's testimony,
[47:27] it brought everybody under expectation
[47:29] to what God can do.
[47:31] Praise the Lord. So his restoration was
[47:35] a testimony to the whole city.
[47:36] Yes, sir.
[47:37] Praise God.
[47:38] Amen.
[47:41] And for the sake of time, just going to
[47:44] skip a few of my notes here. Praise the
[47:47] Lord. And I just want to
[47:50] turn to Colossians chapter 1 21.
[47:56] And it reads, "And you that were
[47:59] sometime alienated and enemies in your
[48:03] mind by wicked works, yet now hath he
[48:07] reconciled in the body of his flesh
[48:10] through death to present you holy and
[48:12] unblameable and unprovable in his sight.
[48:16] If ye continue in the faith grounded and
[48:19] settled, and be not moved away from the
[48:21] hope of the gospel which ye have heard,
[48:24] and which was preached to every creature
[48:26] which is under heaven, whereof I Paul am
[48:29] made a minister, who now rejoice in my
[48:32] sufferings for you, and fill up that
[48:34] which is behind of the afflictions of
[48:36] Christ in my flesh for his body's sake,
[48:39] which is the church. So I thought it was
[48:42] just real interesting to see all that
[48:44] Paul had to go through in his day. Amen.
[48:47] And we know that the early the early
[48:49] church had an experience where uh
[48:52] certainly they they were a together
[48:54] group. They had to come together and
[48:56] become one in one accord. And Paul being
[49:00] the prophet of that age could see
[49:02] further far off and realize that the
[49:04] things that he was going through was for
[49:07] the purpose of bringing the future bride
[49:09] together. Amen. So, he endured those
[49:11] afflictions knowing that there was a
[49:13] body that had to be complete.
[49:15] Praise the Lord. It goes on to say in uh
[49:18] verse 25, whereof I am made a minister
[49:22] according to the dispensation of God,
[49:24] which is given to me for you to fulfill
[49:27] the word of God, even the mystery which
[49:30] had been hid from ages and from
[49:32] generations, but now is made manifest to
[49:35] his saints, to whom God would make known
[49:38] what the riches of the glory of the
[49:40] mystery among the Gentiles, which is
[49:42] Christ in you, the hope of glory. Praise
[49:45] the Lord.
[49:46] in verse in 1 John chapter 3
[49:50] I'm going to read verse 16
[49:55] praise God
[49:57] and it reads hereby we perceive the love
[50:01] of God because he laid down his life for
[50:04] us and we ought to lay it down our lives
[50:06] for the brethren but who so hath this
[50:09] world's good and seeth his brother have
[50:11] need and shutth up his bows of
[50:14] compassion from him how dwell dwelleth
[50:16] the love of God in him. My little
[50:18] children, let us love not in word,
[50:21] neither in tongue, but in deed and in
[50:24] truth. And hereby we know what we are of
[50:27] the truth, and shall assure our hearts
[50:29] before them. For if our heart condemn
[50:31] us, God is greater than our heart, and
[50:34] knoweth all things. Beloved, if our
[50:37] heart condemn us not, then we can have
[50:40] confidence toward God. And whatever we
[50:42] ask, we receive of him because he we
[50:45] keep his commandments and do those
[50:47] things that are pleasing in his sight.
[50:49] Praise the Lord. And I just thought it
[50:52] was uh a very long time to hear our
[50:54] brother preach last week on the church
[50:56] of God. And you know, one of the things
[50:58] God desires is that we are a together
[51:01] group. That we have a love that cannot
[51:04] be broken by any chains of devils. Amen.
[51:07] And and one of the things that's
[51:08] important is is when we can realize that
[51:12] the purpose of the word is so that we
[51:14] can be is just like Christ was. And if
[51:18] Christ laid down his life, then we have
[51:20] to lay down our lives for one another.
[51:22] Amen. And and and that's one of the
[51:24] things that that I think uh the enemy
[51:27] tries to sneak in and he he tries to
[51:29] disrupt different things, but we have to
[51:32] set our affection so high that we look
[51:34] beyond the faults of each other. Amen.
[51:37] But we look beyond the different things
[51:39] that may happen that that were
[51:41] unintentional. Praise the Lord. Because
[51:44] God has God God says Paul says that we
[51:48] must do those things which are pleasing
[51:49] in his sight. And it pleases God, right?
[51:52] Just like as a parent, you're pleased
[51:55] when you can see your children love one
[51:57] another. Amen. So God is pleased when we
[52:00] can love one another. Praise God.
[52:02] Amen. Amen.
[52:04] The prophet says this in the message
[52:07] turning northward. He says, "I know it's
[52:10] not popular. It's not popular amongst
[52:13] people, but brother, it's the message of
[52:15] the hour to come together. The souls
[52:19] have to move together. We are to be one
[52:22] church of the living God. Methodists,
[52:24] Baptists, Presbyterians, Lutheran,
[52:27] oneness, threeness, fiveness, all of us
[52:29] together. We are one group. We are God's
[52:32] children by birth. That's exactly right.
[52:35] All the father has given to me will come
[52:37] to me. And how are you going to come
[52:40] when you got a fence built so high you
[52:42] can't touch the coconuts? See, you have
[52:45] to do this and do that. Oh, so many
[52:48] people. And you know, I could put it
[52:50] this way is is your your the prophet
[52:52] said, "How is how are you going to how
[52:54] are you going to invite this brother or
[52:55] how are you going to allow this person
[52:56] to come when you have your fence built
[52:58] so high you can't touch the coconuts?"
[53:01] But your brother can't touch the
[53:02] coconuts either. Your sister can't touch
[53:04] those coconuts either. Amen. So, it's
[53:07] important that we we lower the fence.
[53:09] Amen.
[53:10] Praise God. It goes to say that like the
[53:13] Philippian jailer that night when he
[53:15] said, "What must I do to be saved? What
[53:18] will we do? We tell him what not to do.
[53:22] You got to quit doing this. You got to
[53:24] quit going over there. You've got to
[53:26] quit doing this." He never asked what we
[53:29] had to quit doing. He asked what could
[53:31] he do to be saved. Right? Paul told him
[53:34] in no misunderstanding words. He said,
[53:36] "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and
[53:39] thou shalt be saved." That's all. Get
[53:42] the faith of God back in the people so
[53:45] that they'll know what to do and how to
[53:48] act. And I just love that because you
[53:51] see, God intends for you not to just
[53:54] experience a breakthrough of of of of of
[53:58] having the perfect faith, but God also
[54:00] wants you to know how to exercise that
[54:02] faith. So God wants you to not only know
[54:05] you've been restored, but what it means
[54:07] to be restored and what you must do
[54:09] going forward. It says, not say, "Come
[54:12] over and join our group. Come over and
[54:14] join that group. Just get them back to
[54:16] God. God will take care of the rest. Get
[54:19] them into the kingdom.
[54:21] Praise the Lord.
[54:24] In ma in the book of Acts
[54:27] 4:31
[54:30] and uh this is just a moment where there
[54:33] was a togetherness among the church.
[54:35] Praise the Lord.
[54:37] And you know, you know, when you're
[54:40] together
[54:41] when and I that's why I I I enjoy the
[54:46] brother's prayer every Tuesday. You see,
[54:48] because the the brother's prayer, the
[54:50] way that that started uh and we can go f
[54:53] uh further back to the sister's prayer,
[54:55] but I remember when I started the the
[54:58] brother's prayer, it was intercessory
[55:00] prayer, which means you not praying for
[55:03] yourself, but you're praying on behalf
[55:05] of others because you recognize that
[55:07] there's a need that others have and you
[55:09] have access to the throne. You have
[55:11] access to the lifeline. Praise the Lord.
[55:14] But when there's a need, you you get
[55:16] down and pray. But you have to forfeit
[55:19] your your prayer
[55:21] so that you can pray on behalf of
[55:23] others. Amen. That's togetherness.
[55:27] And here we see it says, "And when they
[55:30] prayed, the place was shaken where they
[55:33] were assembled together
[55:35] and they were all filled with the Holy
[55:36] Ghost and they spake the word of God
[55:39] with boldness. And the multitude of them
[55:41] that believed were of one heart and of
[55:43] one soul. Neither say any of them that
[55:46] ought of the things which he possessed
[55:48] was his own. But they had all things
[55:51] common. And with great power gave the
[55:53] apostles witness of the resurrection of
[55:55] the Lord. And Jesus uh and great grace
[55:58] was upon them all. Neither was there any
[56:01] among them that lacked. For as many as
[56:04] were possessors of lands or houses sold
[56:06] them and brought the prices of the
[56:08] things that they were sold and laid them
[56:10] down at the apostles feet. and
[56:12] distribution was made unto every man
[56:14] according as he had need. Praise the
[56:17] Lord. So you see now we we might not
[56:20] have to go sell our physical homes.
[56:22] Amen. But we could sell out on our
[56:24] pride.
[56:25] We could sell out on our on our what the
[56:28] what whether it's envy or what whether
[56:30] it's jealousy whatever we can sell out
[56:32] on those things. And when we have filled
[56:35] when we have been filled with the love
[56:37] of God, the love of God, as brother
[56:39] Quinton read on last Wednesday, we can
[56:41] be cemented with that love. Amen.
[56:45] Cemented with that love and distribution
[56:48] can be made to all. Praise the Lord. One
[56:51] might have more love than the other.
[56:53] Amen. But we will not lack nothing.
[56:56] Right? This is what the church
[56:58] experienced. They had no lack of
[56:59] nothing. Amen. and and and I just I just
[57:02] I just believe that the love of God has
[57:05] a way of penetrating through any
[57:07] situation. Praise God. You know, the
[57:09] prophet before he he said that the the
[57:12] evidence of the what the evidence of the
[57:15] baptism of the Holy Spirit was, he says
[57:17] that the having love in your heart, that
[57:20] was how you can identify a true
[57:22] believer, just having that genuine love.
[57:24] Amen. And and I just believe the
[57:26] prophet's ministry evolved to where he
[57:29] he he God revealed more to him to where
[57:32] he could say that you must believe not
[57:34] just have love but you must believe the
[57:36] hour for your day. Praise God. You must
[57:39] have a revelation of what God has called
[57:42] you to in your hour.
[57:43] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[57:46] In Hagi chapter 2 verse 6 it reads
[57:55] for thus said the Lord of hosts yet once
[57:58] it is a little while and I will shake
[58:01] the heavens and the earth and the sea
[58:04] and the dry land and I will shake all
[58:06] nations and the desire of all nations
[58:09] shall come and I will fill this house
[58:13] with glory sayith the Lord of Hosts. The
[58:16] silver is mine and the gold is mine,
[58:18] sayeth the Lord of Hosts. The glory of
[58:20] this latter house shall be greater than
[58:24] of the former, sayeth the Lord of Hosts.
[58:27] And in this place will I give peace,
[58:29] sayeth the Lord of hosts. And I just
[58:32] want to declare that over you all
[58:34] tonight. Praise God. That if you've been
[58:37] restored, Amen. The glory of your house
[58:40] shall be greater than of the former.
[58:42] Amen. Amen.
[58:43] And and we can expect things to be on a
[58:46] greater scale.
[58:48] Amen.
[58:49] Because God only gets greater. Amen.
[58:52] When we meet God on the other side of
[58:54] our restoration, we're not meeting the
[58:56] God of yesterday.
[58:58] We're meeting the God of today. Praise
[59:00] the Lord. And God only increases. He
[59:02] only gets better. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[59:06] God doesn't get better, but God's
[59:08] greatness is revealed more to you. I
[59:11] needed to correct myself there.
[59:12] Praise the Lord. So, in closing, just
[59:16] want to go to
[59:20] the message, the restoration of the
[59:22] bride tree. It says uh paragraph 513.
[59:29] Praise the Lord. And before we read
[59:31] that, um, just want to take a moment.
[59:34] Uh, we we we when Jesus had to also make
[59:38] full proof of of of the things that God
[59:41] called him to do. Praise the Lord. When
[59:43] we go to uh Luke chapter 4 and he and I
[59:47] won't read it for the sake of time, but
[59:49] he goes and he he he goes to he he goes
[59:52] and the book is given to him, right? Our
[59:54] pastor has gone over this, but as as the
[59:57] book is is is given to him, he opens it
[59:59] and and the scripture says he found
[1:00:00] where it was written and and he found
[1:00:03] where it was written concerning himself.
[1:00:06] Praise the Lord. So when he when he
[1:00:07] opened the book and read it, he saw
[1:00:10] himself in the scripture.
[1:00:12] Praise the Lord. And therefore, he was
[1:00:14] able to to to not only understand what
[1:00:17] God called him to, but he was able to
[1:00:19] know exactly what he needed to do to
[1:00:22] make sure that he fulfilled the mission.
[1:00:25] Praise the Lord. And and and and as he
[1:00:27] as he did this, the things got the
[1:00:30] things in his journey got harder. He
[1:00:32] eventually got to a place where he he
[1:00:34] asked God, "If this cup could pass from
[1:00:37] me, let it be." But he came to the
[1:00:39] conclusion that never that nevertheless
[1:00:41] not my will but but thy will be done.
[1:00:43] Praise the Lord. So so God so Jesus was
[1:00:46] tried and he had to get to that place
[1:00:48] where he had to make full proof of what
[1:00:52] God was doing in his in his life. Praise
[1:00:54] the Lord. The message says uh in
[1:00:57] paragraph 513
[1:01:00] uh we know that the prophet has told us
[1:01:02] that there's four life messengers and
[1:01:04] that uh four death messengers killed the
[1:01:07] tree but four life messengers will
[1:01:09] restore it. So it says what the fourth
[1:01:12] was the word itself the word made flesh.
[1:01:16] It says fruits of the proof of the
[1:01:19] resurrection sign that Christ has
[1:01:21] finally after justification planted,
[1:01:24] sanctification planted, baptism of the
[1:01:26] Holy Ghost, organ organizations died out
[1:01:29] and Christ has again centered himself
[1:01:32] like that cap of the pyramid. Amen. Uh
[1:01:36] what is it? the Holy Ghost bunch uh the
[1:01:39] Holy Ghost bunch being honed out so that
[1:01:41] it can be fit with the same kind of
[1:01:44] ministry he had when he went away that
[1:01:48] when he comes back it'll catch the whole
[1:01:50] thing in the rapture where that where
[1:01:52] the justified sanctified and baptism of
[1:01:54] the Holy Ghost that pyramid will stand
[1:01:57] again the house of God will live again
[1:02:00] the tree of life is growing again praise
[1:02:04] the Lord and I'm just uh so happy that
[1:02:06] we all could be part of that. Amen.
[1:02:08] Praise the Lord. So, in closing,
[1:02:13] um, in the message, the spoken word is
[1:02:15] the original seed. Just a few more
[1:02:16] quotes and I'll get out the way. Uh, the
[1:02:20] prophet says, remember, there will be
[1:02:23] such a denominational gathering pretty
[1:02:25] soon. It'll be terrific and they will
[1:02:28] bring themselves together into the
[1:02:30] federation of churches. And this and
[1:02:33] then and then this kind of church will
[1:02:35] be put out of operation as far as they
[1:02:38] know. Amen. It's at that time that Jesus
[1:02:41] will appear and he will show which is
[1:02:44] bride and which is not. And remember
[1:02:47] Christian friends, I'm a man. I can make
[1:02:49] mistakes. But God being God cannot make
[1:02:52] mistakes. All the words that's been
[1:02:54] written must be fulfilled. Jesus said
[1:02:57] so. So we've got things here in the
[1:02:59] scripture that must be fulfilled. And
[1:03:01] that is one of the things this boycott
[1:03:03] to come. Praise God. And and and you see
[1:03:06] when this boycott comes, it's a place of
[1:03:09] decision. Amen. Because you either have
[1:03:11] the seal of God or you have the mark of
[1:03:14] the beast. Amen. And you know, uh
[1:03:16] there's certain people that like to dis
[1:03:18] that like to dismiss the idea of, oh,
[1:03:21] I'm not a religious person or I'm not a
[1:03:24] spiritual person. I'm just a good
[1:03:26] person. But there is no in between.
[1:03:28] You're going to either have the seal of
[1:03:29] God or the mark of the beast.
[1:03:32] You're going to serve one or the other.
[1:03:34] Praise God.
[1:03:36] Goes on to say, "But before this boycott
[1:03:38] can come of the marking of the beast,
[1:03:40] there has to be a sold seed for God to
[1:03:42] take a church out of it." You
[1:03:44] understand? A seed has to be sold, a
[1:03:47] denominational seed, and they're going
[1:03:48] to make a form of an image to the beast,
[1:03:51] the church of Rome. And there has to be
[1:03:54] a true bride. And we understand that the
[1:03:57] so-called bride is rejected. Praise the
[1:04:00] Lord. And uh paragraph 837 further down
[1:04:03] it says, "Now the ministry here has to
[1:04:06] hone into a place to the very same works
[1:04:10] that Jesus did because when he comes the
[1:04:13] headstone will catch right into it
[1:04:15] because they won't. There will be a
[1:04:17] rapture come and they'll be taken and
[1:04:20] the rest of the body will come with it
[1:04:22] and she'll be gone into heaven." Not a
[1:04:24] not a denomination, friends, a church of
[1:04:27] the word of God. You believe it? Praise
[1:04:29] the Lord. So
[1:04:32] for the last time in closing.
[1:04:36] Praise the Lord.
[1:04:38] This this this thought of just just
[1:04:41] making full proof of your restoration.
[1:04:44] We we see where where different ones had
[1:04:46] to go forth and make full proof of their
[1:04:48] situation. Jesus didn't just make full
[1:04:51] proof of anything. He made proof. He he
[1:04:53] had to make full proof of the word and
[1:04:55] the word has now become our absolute.
[1:04:58] Praise the Lord. So because of that uh
[1:05:01] we have what we have today and we read
[1:05:03] in the beginning that uh in the book of
[1:05:05] Malachi that the God was sent Elijah and
[1:05:09] we all know who that Elijah is. Amen.
[1:05:11] And you see in the beginning of brother
[1:05:14] Brandham's ministry, brother Brandham um
[1:05:17] when I when this thought was given to
[1:05:19] me, I as our pastor always says uh
[1:05:22] search it through the through the
[1:05:24] message and uh just just came to
[1:05:26] different things that the prophet
[1:05:27] himself had to go through. And one of
[1:05:30] the first things is as he was laying the
[1:05:32] cornerstone of the tabernacle, uh he had
[1:05:35] a trance. He called it in those days. It
[1:05:38] was a vision. He didn't know what to
[1:05:39] call it, but he said it was it was a
[1:05:41] trance. But in this vision, Amen. he was
[1:05:44] visited. Amen. And and what what he saw
[1:05:47] in this vision is he saw that there was
[1:05:50] uh uh two trees. There was two sides.
[1:05:52] Praise the Lord. And in midst of the two
[1:05:55] sides, he says that uh there was an
[1:05:57] empty place on each side to be filled,
[1:06:01] right? And then he there was a tree that
[1:06:04] was planted down and he took each
[1:06:06] branches of each side and he cut the
[1:06:08] tree in half and he planted it down. And
[1:06:11] it goes to say that uh and up into the
[1:06:14] heavens went the great trees uh growing
[1:06:16] quickly and the fruits fell down and
[1:06:18] they were delicious. He says I was
[1:06:21] eating them and at the cross just ahead
[1:06:23] of me lay all lay all covered with
[1:06:25] fruit. And it was at that time that he
[1:06:29] got to a place and the spirit of the
[1:06:31] Lord spoke to him and says, "Make full
[1:06:33] proof of your ministry." He says, "Do
[1:06:36] the work of an evangelist. Make full
[1:06:39] proof of your ministry." And I just
[1:06:41] thought it was u real interesting
[1:06:44] because he asked uh the the the the
[1:06:47] voice the spirit of the Lord told him
[1:06:48] that this is not your tabernacle. The
[1:06:50] tab where he was laying the cornerstone,
[1:06:52] the foundation, he says, "This was not
[1:06:54] your tabernacle." He says, "Where is my
[1:06:55] tabernacle?" Right. And I just thought
[1:06:57] it was very interesting that the prophet
[1:07:00] had to lay seeds. We had a different
[1:07:03] seeds were sold. Billy Graham preached
[1:07:05] to his group. Oral Roberts preached to
[1:07:07] his group. But the prophet Elijah was
[1:07:10] sent to a specific group of people. And
[1:07:12] the the word seed was sown and it's the
[1:07:15] same word seed that will bring the
[1:07:17] restoration of the bride tree. That's
[1:07:20] the fourth stage of the restoration.
[1:07:22] Praise the Lord. and and and and the
[1:07:25] prophet, I can say, fulfilled that. He
[1:07:27] he he made full proof, amen, of the of
[1:07:30] his ministry. Praise God. Cuz when we
[1:07:33] read the book of Malachi, when we read
[1:07:35] Luke 17, when we when we read Revelation
[1:07:38] chapter 10, right, we can see that the
[1:07:42] the the the mission was complete because
[1:07:44] he has a people that has been restored.
[1:07:47] Amen. And we are that people that has
[1:07:49] been restored back to God.
[1:07:51] That's exactly right. Praise the Lord.
[1:07:54] In the message restoration of the bride
[1:07:56] tree, paragraph 404 444,
[1:07:59] it says, "After Easter, his raising, he
[1:08:02] said, go into all the world, and I'm
[1:08:05] going to go with you. As the living
[1:08:07] father has sent me, he is in me, so I
[1:08:11] will send you, and I will be in you. I'm
[1:08:13] with you to the end of the world. the
[1:08:15] works. The same thing that I've done to
[1:08:18] prove that I was, you'll do the same
[1:08:20] things to prove that you are. I like
[1:08:23] that. These signs shall follow them that
[1:08:25] are believers. Not make believers, but
[1:08:27] believers. These things that I do, you
[1:08:30] will do it and vindicate that you are a
[1:08:33] believer just the same as the works that
[1:08:35] I done. Because the living father lives
[1:08:37] in me. It ain't me that doeth the work.
[1:08:40] It's my father. And it won't be you
[1:08:42] doing the works. It would be me and you
[1:08:44] doing the works. Now you go into all the
[1:08:47] world. Otherwise, you're going to form
[1:08:49] what's known to me as a bride. See, I'll
[1:08:52] go with you and you'll be part of me.
[1:08:54] You'll be my bride. My life will be in
[1:08:57] your body. Just like a husband and wife
[1:08:59] is one person. You and I are going to be
[1:09:01] one. At that day, you will know that I
[1:09:04] am in the father, the father in me, and
[1:09:06] I in you, and you in me. I just love
[1:09:08] that. Satan just gets so angry at that.
[1:09:11] See the oneness of God. All that God
[1:09:13] was, he poured into Christ. And all that
[1:09:16] Christ was, he poured into the church.
[1:09:18] There you are. Makes them all one.
[1:09:20] Praise the Lord. And and I just very uh
[1:09:24] just thankful to God that we can look on
[1:09:27] the other side of of of of Brother
[1:09:30] Brener's ministry and see that the
[1:09:33] mission was complete. See that we are in
[1:09:35] that ripening season where we can see
[1:09:37] the the fruits of the of the word of God
[1:09:41] bring forth a true restoration to every
[1:09:44] individual. Praise God.
[1:09:46] So just want to encourage all of us
[1:09:48] tonight as we uh just make ready uh for
[1:09:52] the meetings uh let us let us make full
[1:09:55] proof of what God has done for us.
[1:09:58] Let us make full proof of his
[1:10:00] restoration in our lives.
[1:10:02] Amen.
[1:10:04] Let us bow.
[1:10:09] Amen.
[1:10:11] Oh dear Lord Jesus.
[1:10:13] Father we just want to thank you God for
[1:10:16] your word Lord.
[1:10:18] Father God uh just unworthy mortal lips
[1:10:21] Lord. But Father your word is sharper
[1:10:25] than any twos word God. It can been it
[1:10:28] can penetrate oh Father deeper than any
[1:10:30] man's word can. And Lord it is our
[1:10:33] absolute tonight father. And God, we are
[1:10:36] all here tonight because we are
[1:10:38] believers, Lord. We're here tonight
[1:10:40] because you says there must be a bride,
[1:10:43] Father. And Lord, you promise, God, that
[1:10:46] there will be a togetherness that will
[1:10:48] come forth in the midst of the bride. Oh
[1:10:51] Lord, that will cause a such a love,
[1:10:53] Lord God. That God, we'll experience, oh
[1:10:56] Lord, omnipotence, Father. And God, I
[1:10:59] pray Lord that as we will just be
[1:11:02] preparing ourselves, Lord God, we will,
[1:11:04] Lord, just be saturated, Father, with
[1:11:06] your with your word, Lord, we'll be
[1:11:08] saturated with your presence, Father
[1:11:10] God. And Lord, we'll we'll go forth
[1:11:13] knowing that, Lord, you have to fulfill
[1:11:15] your word, Lord. If you spoke it, it
[1:11:17] cannot come back to you void, Lord. And
[1:11:20] if you said, I will restore, Lord, there
[1:11:22] must be a restoration, Father. So Lord
[1:11:25] God, let us all be under expectation.
[1:11:28] Father, that Lord, our brothers will be
[1:11:30] restored, our sisters will be restored,
[1:11:32] Lord. Father, if you could call Lazarus
[1:11:35] by name, Lord, that we can call our
[1:11:37] sisters by name, Lord. We can call our
[1:11:39] brothers by name, Lord. And God, we can
[1:11:42] expect for you to meet them there in a
[1:11:44] special way, oh Father. So, Father, we
[1:11:47] just ask that you would just be with us,
[1:11:48] Lord. Go with us as we would leave,
[1:11:50] Lord. And God, may the words that's been
[1:11:52] spoken, Father, be be swed in our
[1:11:55] hearts, Lord. And may you be the one to
[1:11:57] to water it with your praise, with your
[1:11:59] with your anointing, Lord, that God, we
[1:12:01] would just experience more of your
[1:12:03] restoration, more of your glory, Father,
[1:12:05] as we heard tonight, Lord, the the glory
[1:12:08] of the the the the glory of the latter
[1:12:10] house, Lord, shall be greater, Father,
[1:12:12] than the former. So, God, help us,
[1:12:14] Father, to to just expect more from you
[1:12:16] in this hour. In the name of Jesus
[1:12:18] Christ, we pray. Amen.
[1:12:20] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:12:22] Praise the Lord. God bless you, saints.
[1:12:27] Bless you. Bless you. Praise the Lord.
[1:12:30] Amen. We thank the Lord for the word.
[1:12:34] Uh appreciate brother Jerry
[1:12:37] uh just getting himself out of the way
[1:12:39] and allowing the Lord to speak through
[1:12:41] his lips to us. Amen. Uh feel like I've
[1:12:46] been to the Smores board again tonight.
[1:12:49] Amen. God is good.
[1:12:52] God is good. Let us um um get the
[1:12:56] announcements uh for tonight
[1:12:59] and um
[1:13:07] All right. Um
[1:13:10] so we um we have prayer this Sunday
[1:13:15] morning from 9 to 10. Uh our service
[1:13:19] will start at 10:30
[1:13:21] and then um uh Sunday school from 9:30
[1:13:25] to 10:00 for our youth and young adults.
[1:13:28] We continue our streaming through uh
[1:13:31] Facebook which is SAT tabernacle
[1:13:34] as well as our church website uh
[1:13:36] john423.org.
[1:13:38] Um, I think there was a little confusion
[1:13:41] about that on Sunday, but the musicians
[1:13:44] practice is for our musicians. It's not
[1:13:47] for um the choir, but this is for our
[1:13:51] musicians, and it'll be here Friday,
[1:13:54] July 18th from 7 to 9:00. It'll be here
[1:13:56] at Jagger Middle School. Um, don't
[1:14:00] forget as we're approaching the uh
[1:14:02] meetings, uh know a lot will be done be
[1:14:05] having to be done. So, the Wednesday
[1:14:07] before the meetings, there won't be any
[1:14:09] service. Uh, that's Wednesday, July
[1:14:11] 23rd. I know on the 24th, we'll be doing
[1:14:14] all the setup there to get the the
[1:14:15] building all uh ready. And then um 25th,
[1:14:20] everything will be uh happening 25th,
[1:14:23] 26th, and 27th. And uh as I mentioned to
[1:14:27] the church on uh on Sunday, uh the Lord
[1:14:31] has provided for us to um someone open a
[1:14:34] door for us to to come and worship. They
[1:14:36] they're sharing their sanctuary with us.
[1:14:38] Uh the name of the church is Eagles
[1:14:40] Rest. And um which again, I don't think
[1:14:43] that's by a chance uh cuz we are Eagles.
[1:14:49] Amen. We are Eagles. And um so we uh the
[1:14:53] church is located at 2922 Jock Road and
[1:14:58] uh that's in Green Acres. That's just
[1:14:59] just down the street about 7 milesi down
[1:15:01] the street uh if you go south. And um um
[1:15:05] it's at the corner of 10th Avenue and
[1:15:09] Jog Road if you all are familiar with
[1:15:12] that area. And you'll see a big old
[1:15:14] sign. It's actually in the corner of the
[1:15:15] plaza just like we were over here. in
[1:15:18] the corner, you just see this big sign
[1:15:19] say church. And um that's where it will
[1:15:22] be right there in the corner. Uh our
[1:15:24] first service is going to be on a
[1:15:26] Wednesday night, July 30th at 7:30 p.m.
[1:15:28] That just gives us an opportunity to
[1:15:30] kind of uh get a feel for the building.
[1:15:34] Uh cuz the the the service times will be
[1:15:36] changing when when we get there. The
[1:15:39] service times will be changing. will be
[1:15:41] starting an hour earlier uh on our
[1:15:44] service and um a Sunday school to kind
[1:15:46] of get pushed up a little bit. I we'll
[1:15:49] we'll be giving all that information to
[1:15:51] you as we uh approach, but just want
[1:15:54] everyone to be aware uh to see all this
[1:15:56] so that when we finish the meetings, we
[1:15:58] won't be coming back to here. We'll be
[1:16:01] meeting there. All right. Uh so we'll go

[1:19:30] Sister Bur,
[1:19:34] Sister Bur,
[1:19:37] thank you. God bless you, saints. Uh, I
[1:19:40] just wanted to thank the Lord for
[1:19:43] my coworker coming out to the service
[1:19:46] last week
[1:19:48] and once we got back to work, I hadn't
[1:19:52] seen or talked with her for a couple
[1:19:54] days and then one day she came up and
[1:19:56] she started talking about the service.
[1:19:59] She was actually saying some of the
[1:20:01] things that the minister had said and we
[1:20:04] just had good fellowship on it. Really
[1:20:06] good fellowship. So, she's planning on
[1:20:08] coming Sunday.
[1:20:10] So, you all be in prayer that you know
[1:20:12] the enemy doesn't come and hinder that.
[1:20:15] And I really see the Lord pulling her.
[1:20:19] Amen.
[1:20:19] And also, I'd asked prayer some time
[1:20:22] back for this chaplain that he and I had
[1:20:25] been having conversations and I gave him
[1:20:28] the flyer uh today for the meeting
[1:20:31] coming up and he really expressed an
[1:20:34] interest. He's having some issues with
[1:20:36] his car and he asked me to please pray
[1:20:39] for his car. So I I said I believe that
[1:20:42] God
[1:20:43] he's concerned about the things that
[1:20:45] we're concerned about. So I can we can
[1:20:48] pray for your car.
[1:20:49] Amen.

[1:20:52] day. Uh

[1:20:58] Okay.
[1:20:59] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:21:03] or anyone else.
[1:21:06] All right.
[1:21:08] Okay. Uh let's take these requests
[1:21:13] uh to the Lord
[1:21:16] and um uh actually on last last um
[1:21:22] last
[1:21:24] uh Wednesday uh brother Quinton was
[1:21:27] preaching. He had no idea some of the
[1:21:30] things that he was saying was like right
[1:21:34] down that sister's alley.
[1:21:38] I mean, did you had no clue what you
[1:21:40] were saying up here? No clue. And um um
[1:21:46] uh Sister Birds could could share just
[1:21:48] some of the things that the the Sister
[1:21:50] Denise, that's her name, right? you
[1:21:52] know, you you were talking about the way
[1:21:54] people dress and she made a comment
[1:21:56] before she even came was like, "I need
[1:21:58] to go home and change before I actually
[1:22:00] go to church." And um and you come up
[1:22:03] talking about that and it's like, oh my
[1:22:05] Lord, she knew she was in the right
[1:22:07] place at the right time.
[1:22:09] So, uh it's good to know that the Lord
[1:22:11] is dealing with her and that she want to
[1:22:13] come on Sunday. Uh we pray that God will
[1:22:16] speak to her once again. uh and uh but
[1:22:19] but you know it it's I I'm happy people
[1:22:22] can come to church and know that they've
[1:22:24] heard from God, not not from a man. And
[1:22:26] especially when a person don't even know
[1:22:28] them. That's that's the work of the Holy
[1:22:30] Ghost uh that does that. But but yeah,
[1:22:33] it was it was it was precious precious.
[1:22:35] Thank God for you all of our brothers.
[1:22:37] All right, let's uh let's um uh take
[1:22:40] these requests to the Lord and um uh
[1:22:44] just pray over it. Father, we we come in
[1:22:46] the name of Jesus. First, we thank you
[1:22:48] for how you're dealing with Sister
[1:22:50] Denise. Thank you for her presence. And
[1:22:53] God, that she could hear your voice.
[1:22:55] Scripture says that my sheep know my
[1:22:58] voice and a stranger they will not
[1:23:00] follow. So God, she could hear you
[1:23:01] speaking through uh Brother Quinton to
[1:23:04] her and and Lord, um you're dealing with
[1:23:06] a heart that she wants to return uh once
[1:23:09] again. And then father as uh brother JZ
[1:23:11] would come a minister all the way from
[1:23:14] uh coming all the way from Nigeria. I
[1:23:17] mean yes Nigeria. And God um we pray
[1:23:20] that you would use him to say something
[1:23:22] else that would further her experience
[1:23:24] uh here. We know the enemy would try to
[1:23:26] fight her and maybe uh disrupt her uh uh
[1:23:31] uh coming. But Father, we bind the hands
[1:23:33] of the enemy right now in the name of
[1:23:35] Jesus. And you told us oh God that what
[1:23:37] we bind on earth will be bound in
[1:23:40] heaven. What we loose on earth will be
[1:23:41] loose in heaven. So we loose your spirit
[1:23:44] just to continue father the work that
[1:23:46] you have started uh in her life. Also
[1:23:48] the chaplain that mom has on her job
[1:23:51] that uh heard about the meetings and and
[1:23:55] desires but he has a uh some trouble
[1:23:58] with his vehicle and asks for prayer
[1:24:00] over the car. Uh I I'm reminded of
[1:24:03] different ones that have prayed over
[1:24:06] different things and you answered. Uh
[1:24:08] people prayed over their air
[1:24:10] conditioners and you answered, God, they
[1:24:12] they prayed o over vehicles and you
[1:24:14] answered. Prayed over refrigerators and
[1:24:17] you answered, God, you you are a God
[1:24:19] that's concerned about every uh part of
[1:24:22] our life. So uh we don't take this for
[1:24:25] granted and we speak life to that car.
[1:24:27] what whatever condition it is, Lord, may
[1:24:30] it be resolved. And uh if if you're if
[1:24:33] you're preparing him for a newer
[1:24:35] vehicle, then we receive that as well.
[1:24:37] Uh so whatever your plan is, God, we
[1:24:39] receive it. Just ask that you would
[1:24:41] bless him. And Father, that the door
[1:24:43] would be wide open for him to come and
[1:24:45] be a part of uh these services. Lord,
[1:24:48] Brother Quinton's brother Fenton um has
[1:24:51] a business need and uh we ask that you
[1:24:54] would just be involved. He has uh uh
[1:24:57] some needs that must be met. And God, we
[1:24:59] know that you're more than capable of
[1:25:02] meeting those needs. And Father,
[1:25:03] sometimes when we hear uh others put in
[1:25:06] requests like that, we think about our
[1:25:08] businesses. And Father, you know, the
[1:25:10] needs of each and every one of our
[1:25:12] business, God, you told us that whatever
[1:25:15] we put our hand to that it would
[1:25:18] prosper. And Father, so we expect
[1:25:20] prosperity. uh and when Satan tries to
[1:25:23] come and take away, you promise to
[1:25:26] restore. So, Father, we we expect
[1:25:28] restoration. We ask that you would move
[1:25:30] by your spirit upon all of our
[1:25:31] businesses, oh God, and that we would
[1:25:33] see overflow because that is what you
[1:25:36] have declared over us, amen, in this
[1:25:38] year. So, Father, let your uh let your
[1:25:40] your great plan go to work in our in our
[1:25:43] on our behalf. Provide the clients, the
[1:25:45] customers, the workers, everything we
[1:25:47] need uh provide. Father, we also want to
[1:25:50] remember uh both brother Quinton's in
[1:25:53] prayer and sister Sarah as well as they
[1:25:55] prepare to travel. Uh give them
[1:25:57] traveling mercies, oh God. And may you
[1:25:59] watch over them while they are away and
[1:26:01] may you keep them, Father. And uh Lord,
[1:26:03] just let them return uh home safely is
[1:26:06] our prayer. Bless the saints now as they
[1:26:08] prepare to leave this place but not your
[1:26:09] presence. God, may you go uh with us.
[1:26:12] Thank you for the word that has been
[1:26:14] brought to us tonight. And I just ask,
[1:26:16] oh God, that you would get glory and
[1:26:18] honor out of all that we do. Bring us
[1:26:19] back uh this weekend uh ready to hear
[1:26:23] once more from you. In Jesus name we
[1:26:25] pray. Amen. Amen. God richly bless you.
[1:26:31] Uh the brothers will come at this time
[1:26:34] to dismiss you. Amen. And God bless you
[1:26:37] tonight.
