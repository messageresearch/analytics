[20:12] Praise God.
[20:15] God bless you all tonight.
[20:17] Uh so [music] good to have you here in
[20:21] uh fellowship with us.
[20:23] Some come from far, some [music] come
[20:25] from near, but we all come for one
[20:28] purpose and that's to glorify the name
[20:29] of the Lord. Man, truly he is worthy uh
[20:33] to [music] be praised.
[20:35] And uh I wanted to just take a a moment
[20:41] [music]
[20:43] just read a a scripture as it relates to
[20:47] this weekend. As you all have heard, our
[20:50] theme [music] for this weekend is I will
[20:53] restore
[20:56] saith
[20:57] the Lord. [music]
[20:59] Amen. And um we the church has been on a
[21:04] journey [music] actually for roughly two
[21:06] years uh where God started [music] us
[21:09] off last year with this this inspiration
[21:11] of our restore sayith the Lord and it
[21:13] carried us right through the year and as
[21:16] we entered into
[21:17] &gt;&gt; [music]
[21:17] &gt;&gt; uh 2025 we knew that we were going
[21:20] forward with that theme and um and since
[21:24] the theme carried [music] over then it
[21:26] had a second inspiration and that second
[21:29] inspiration is the year of overflow.
[21:32] Hallelujah. We're under expectation for
[21:34] God to do some overflow in this place.
[21:36] [music] Amen. This this weekend, we need
[21:39] spiritual overflow. Amen. Some of us
[21:42] need the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Some
[21:45] need refillings of the Holy Ghost.
[21:46] [music] And we're expecting God to come
[21:48] in and just fill our hearts. Amen. We
[21:51] want to see change. But our scripture,
[21:54] amen, that we use for our uh [music]
[21:57] theme is out of Joel chapter 2.
[22:00] And I'll start at verse 21.
[22:02] Um, start at verse [music] 21.
[22:06] The Bible says, "Fear not, O land. Be
[22:09] [music] glad and rejoice for the Lord
[22:12] will do great things." Anybody believe
[22:15] that?
[22:18] Hallelujah.
[22:20] It goes on to say, "Be not afraid,
[22:22] [music] ye beasts of the field, for the
[22:25] pastures of the wilderness do spring.
[22:28] For the the tree beareth her [music]
[22:30] fruit, and the fig tree, and the vine do
[22:31] yield their strength. Be glad then, ye
[22:34] children of Zion, and rejoice [music] in
[22:36] the Lord your God, for he hath given you
[22:37] the former rain moderately, and he will
[22:39] cause to come down for you the rain, the
[22:42] former rain, and the latter rain in the
[22:44] first month. It says, "And [music] the
[22:46] floors shall be full of wheat, and the
[22:50] fats
[22:51] shall [music] overflow with wine and
[22:54] oil." So that's the year of overflow
[22:56] right there [music] in the scripture.
[22:57] the fat shall overflow with wine and
[23:00] oil. We know that that wine, amen, is is
[23:04] is [music] a stimulation. Praise God.
[23:06] And what we're looking for a stimulation
[23:07] of revelation overflow this weekend.
[23:09] [music]
[23:10] Blessed be the name of the Lord. The
[23:12] next verse says this, uh, "And I will
[23:14] restore
[23:16] to you the years that the locust have
[23:18] eaten, the cankerworm, and the
[23:20] caterpillar, and the palmer, my great
[23:22] army which I sent among you." And I love
[23:24] this verse here. Ye shall [music] eat in
[23:27] plenty.
[23:29] Now, I want to I want to just uh mention
[23:32] [music] this because I am very
[23:34] intentional as a as a shepherd that I I
[23:37] didn't let you all know who was going to
[23:38] be preaching. [music] And the reason I
[23:40] didn't do do that because I want you to
[23:41] come under expectation. And the other
[23:44] thing I want you to know is that God
[23:45] made you a promise. You know what God's
[23:48] promise is? Ye shall eat [music]
[23:51] in plenty.
[23:54] That's what God told you. With this
[23:56] inspiration, ye shall eat in [music]
[23:59] plenty.
[24:00] And the Bible says, "And be satisfied."
[24:04] I'm I'm here to tell you tonight, you
[24:06] will not leave these meetings
[24:09] disappointed.
[24:11] God made you a promise. You going to eat
[24:14] in plenty. Just bring your knife and
[24:16] bring your fork. Bring your plate. Get
[24:18] it. Get ready to eat in plenty.
[24:24] &gt;&gt; [music]
[24:25] &gt;&gt; It's what God said. No, no, y'all don't
[24:28] go there. Y'all don't go there. [music]
[24:31] Ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied
[24:33] and praise the name of the Lord your God
[24:35] that have dealt wondrously with you.
[24:39] [music] And I love this. My people
[24:43] shall never
[24:46] be ashamed.
[24:49] &gt;&gt; [music]
[24:50] &gt;&gt; Verse 27 says, "And ye shall know
[24:53] that I'm in the midst of Israel, and
[24:55] that I am the Lord your God, and none
[24:58] else, and my people [music] shall never
[25:02] be ashamed." Thank God for his promised
[25:04] word.
[25:06] Thank God for his promised word. [music]
[25:13] God's prophet makes some comments,
[25:15] [music] amen, about this scripture.
[25:19] I just wanted to read a quote really
[25:20] quick. [music]
[25:24] Amen.
[25:29] [music]
[25:32] You can just pull that up for me.
[25:38] Out of the restoration [music] of the
[25:39] bride tree, Brother Brandham,
[25:42] he preaches a powerful [music] sermon.
[25:45] powerful sermon on this uh on this
[25:47] restoration and [music] and if you have
[25:49] if you haven't listened to it I
[25:50] encourage you go back and listen to it.
[25:52] It is it is powerful. And u there's
[25:54] [music] some inspiration that we're
[25:56] grabbing from this for our meetings. And
[25:59] the prophet says this, notice the same
[26:01] insect that little rascal,
[26:03] the same insect [music] that started and
[26:05] killed the tree in the beginning started
[26:07] right back at them Lutheran branches.
[26:09] But what it can't kill [music] it. It
[26:13] can't kill it because God has done said,
[26:15] "I will restore." [music] My God. That
[26:18] insect started on Luther to kill all the
[26:21] Lutheran branches. It came right over to
[26:22] Wesley, killed all the Wesley branches,
[26:25] but the main part of the [music] tree
[26:26] keeps coming. And it says this. Now
[26:29] notice in the old time when the tree was
[26:31] killed, it was killed went plum to the
[26:33] roots when it killed it back there. But
[26:35] this time because the word is [music]
[26:37] predestinated.
[26:39] Now this right here is very important to
[26:41] me. Uh the prophet said the word is
[26:43] predestinated. And what we're looking at
[26:45] here is [music] the scripture that I
[26:47] just read to you says, I will restore
[26:49] saith the Lord. Let me tell you
[26:51] something. You don't have to do the
[26:52] restoration.
[26:54] [music]
[26:56] That's not your job to do the
[26:57] restoration. It is God's job to do the
[27:00] restoration. And he said it's a
[27:01] predestinated
[27:03] word. It's [music] a predestinated
[27:06] promise. And it's a promise for this day
[27:08] in which we live. [music]
[27:11] Let me tell you something. Uh if if we
[27:13] would just come here under expectation
[27:15] what God [music] promised in this world,
[27:16] we'll get exactly what we expect.
[27:19] Nothing less, church. [music] Here he
[27:20] says it to us. He says, um, he says,
[27:22] "But this time, because the word is
[27:24] predestinated,
[27:25] there is nothing
[27:28] going to stop [music] it.
[27:30] Nothing going to stop it." He says, God
[27:32] said, "I will restore." No matter how
[27:34] much they organize, how much they do
[27:35] this, that, or the other, I'm [music]
[27:37] going to restore it. That settles it.
[27:39] All the laughing, making fun, scoffing,
[27:43] calling holy rollers nonsense, [music]
[27:45] everything you want to. God still said,
[27:49] "I will restore," said the Lord. And
[27:51] look at this. Just as sure as he raised
[27:54] Jesus out of the grave under three days,
[27:57] under three dispensations or three
[27:59] sections, he is going to raise the
[28:02] church to its fullness and power again.
[28:07] We have a promise from God. I will
[28:10] restore, saith the Lord.
[28:14] &gt;&gt; I I I thank God for his words. [music]
[28:16] As you all are quite aware here in South
[28:19] Florida, we used to do the the meetings
[28:22] uh here in in in July. Precious Brother
[28:26] Wesco was the one that would host
[28:27] [music] the meetings there, Rapturing um
[28:30] Rapture Faith Tabernacle. And and as
[28:32] you're aware, the Lord called [music]
[28:33] our precious brother Wesco home uh on
[28:36] last year, but I tell you, his influence
[28:38] is still felt in many of our lives.
[28:41] Amen. [music] He he taught us how to
[28:43] have services like this. And he would
[28:45] help try to create an environment, you
[28:46] know, where where God could move amongst
[28:48] his people. And that's what we've done.
[28:50] Amen. This weekend [music] is just
[28:51] trying to carry that forward. And and
[28:53] and the meetings that used to go, God
[28:55] said, "I will restore." So this is part
[28:57] of that restoration. Hallelujah. Amen.
[29:00] And we're come we're coming tonight
[29:01] under expectation. Uh I wanted to also
[29:03] just acknowledge uh this weekend we'll
[29:05] [music] have Sister Wesco with us. We
[29:08] thank God. We thank God for her.
[29:12] We truly thank God for her. And I uh I
[29:16] just uh wanted to just just ask [music]
[29:19] amen to just honor her space. Uh this is
[29:22] kind of like the first time she's coming
[29:24] out in in in in a in in a larger crowd
[29:26] like [music] this. And you know, and I
[29:27] know everybody probably want to just get
[29:29] with her and tell her how much you love
[29:31] her and and and and and just talk to
[29:33] her, find out how she's doing, but but
[29:35] just let her have her space if you don't
[29:36] mind. Uh let her just kind of get in
[29:38] where [music] she fit in. Amen. And just
[29:41] keep her in prayer. But we thank God for
[29:43] her. We thank God, Amen, for for what
[29:45] this area was established. [music] We
[29:47] thank God for Rapture and Faith
[29:48] Tabernacle. Thank God for that for the
[29:49] church that's still moving on in the
[29:51] name of the Lord.
[29:54] We thank God. Amen. So, as we come
[29:57] tonight, uh I just wanted to just
[30:00] introduce what the meetings were all
[30:01] about. And um and and I wanted to also
[30:04] put you under [music] the promise that
[30:05] you're going to eat in plenty and you're
[30:07] going to be satisfied. I promise you
[30:09] that this weekend, it's not it's
[30:10] actually not my promise. It's God's
[30:13] promise. [music]
[30:14] You're going to eat in plenty and you're
[30:15] going to be satisfied. But tonight,
[30:17] [music] I uh one of my uh deacons when
[30:21] we were preparing for the meetings, he
[30:23] he [music]
[30:24] just kind of kept asking me, he's like,
[30:26] "Brother Jack, can we do another night
[30:27] of worship?" We did it last last year
[30:30] and um you know, we had a wonderful time
[30:32] last [music] year. Um South Florida
[30:35] Choir, they they were awesome. They were
[30:39] awesome. [music]
[30:43] So when my deacon asked, I said, "Well,
[30:45] you know what? we'll we'll do our best
[30:47] to try to [music] assemble the choir
[30:49] again and and and and see what we can do
[30:50] to make this happen. And um I um I
[30:54] [music] called on brother Joe Underwood
[30:57] Jr. and and brother Paul Jean if they
[31:00] would just kind of help me bring
[31:01] everything together and and they did.
[31:03] Brother Paul was in the midst of uh they
[31:06] were expecting their second child, so he
[31:08] couldn't do as much. But Brother Joel
[31:09] took a a lead role in just really
[31:11] helping bring this [music] choir
[31:12] together and working with the musicians
[31:14] from we got them from multiple churches,
[31:16] the choirs from multiple churches here
[31:18] in South Florida. And I just appreciate
[31:19] [music]
[31:20] the unity and the fellowship, Amen, that
[31:22] we have here. I thank God for it.
[31:26] I thank God for it.
[31:29] So as we just [clears throat] uh prepare
[31:33] uh that I just want to read a scripture
[31:35] in regards to tonight um coming out of 2
[31:39] Coronicles chapter 20.
[31:48] Verse 20 says, "And they arose early in
[31:52] the morning and went forth [music] into
[31:55] the wilderness of Takcoa." And I believe
[31:58] we have um there's an ensemble that's
[32:01] going to get this started tonight if
[32:02] they would make their way. Um I'll read
[32:06] the scripture. And they they arose early
[32:08] in the morning and went forth into the
[32:10] wilderness of Takcoa. And as they went
[32:12] forth, Jehoshaphat stood [music] and
[32:14] said, "Hear me, oh Judah, and ye
[32:16] inhabitants of Jerusalem. Believe in the
[32:19] Lord your God, so shall you be
[32:21] established. Believe his prophets, so
[32:23] shall you prosper."
[32:26] It says, "And when he had consulted with
[32:28] the people, he appointed singers unto
[32:32] the Lord, and that should praise the
[32:35] beauty of holiness, and they went out
[32:38] before the army
[32:40] to say, and to say, praise the Lord, for
[32:43] his mercy endureth forever."
[32:46] And when they begin to sing and to
[32:48] praise the Lord,
[32:51] begin to sing and to praise, the Lord
[32:53] set ambushments against the children of
[32:55] Amman, Moab, and Mount Sier,
[33:00] which would come against Judah and they
[33:02] were smitten. It's just something about
[33:03] the word of God a as as we worship
[33:08] and especially when you worship in a
[33:10] time of difficulty when you're going
[33:12] through great trials and tribulations
[33:14] and distresses but you make a choice
[33:16] that I'm going to worship God right
[33:17] through the midst of that. You know what
[33:19] happens is that you actually begin to
[33:21] you begin to give your enemy mind
[33:23] battles
[33:25] &gt;&gt; because he wondering how can you worship
[33:28] when you're going through all that? How
[33:31] how can you praise God when you ain't
[33:32] got no money in your pocket?
[33:35] Because I know the God that's going to
[33:36] put money back in my pocket. That's why
[33:37] I can praise him. But he, the Bible says
[33:40] he set ambushments
[33:43] against the enemy. Your your praise can
[33:45] bring a release in your spirit. So as as
[33:49] they went to battle, we'll see something
[33:50] here. Let's keep reading in the Bible.
[33:53] Um
[33:56] verse uh uh 22 again. It says, "And when
[33:59] the when they began to sing in the
[34:00] praise, the Lord set ambushments against
[34:02] the children of Ammon, Moab, and Mount
[34:04] Sier, which were come against Judah and
[34:07] and they were smitten. And the children
[34:09] of Ammon and Moab stood up against the
[34:11] inhabitants of Mount Sier utterly to
[34:14] slay and destroy them. And when they had
[34:16] made an end of the inhabitants of Sier,
[34:18] everyone helped to destroy another. And
[34:22] when [music] Judah came toward the
[34:24] watchtower in the wilderness, they
[34:26] looked unto the multitude, and behold,
[34:28] there were dead bodies fallen to the
[34:30] earth, and none escaped. Now watch this.
[34:32] And when Jehoshaphat and his people came
[34:35] to take away the spoil of them, they
[34:37] found among them in abundance, both
[34:39] riches with the dead, uh they stripped
[34:43] off for themselves more than they could
[34:45] carry away. And they were three days in
[34:48] gathering
[34:50] of the spoil. It was so much that mean
[34:52] they experienced [music]
[34:54] an overflow.
[34:57] &gt;&gt; But all this happened after the people
[34:59] begin to worship and they begin to
[35:01] praise the Lord. And and as we're
[35:03] getting ready for this weekend, what we
[35:05] want to do is have this night of worship
[35:08] where we just prepare our hearts for
[35:09] what God's going to do this weekend.
[35:11] [music] And and I always say this, when
[35:12] the choir comes up to sing, uh you're
[35:15] not the audience,
[35:17] you actually are the worshippers.
[35:19] They're going to put the words up here
[35:20] for you. So sing along with the choir.
[35:22] Let's just have one big night of
[35:24] worship.
[35:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; But our audience is the Lord Jesus
[35:28] Christ. And we come to worship him. We
[35:31] come to praise him. We come to exalt
[35:33] him.
[35:35] So tonight as the choir would come and
[35:37] amen just enter take [music] us into
[35:39] this time of worship. I pray that you
[35:41] would en enjoy amen. The songs that have
[35:43] come and and that you would enter in and
[35:45] also worship right along with them. God
[35:47] richly bless you. Welcome [music]
[35:50] to the 2025 meetings. I'll restore saith
[35:54] the Lord.

[1:25:25] some of you all may be aware, some may
[1:25:28] not be aware,
[1:25:30] but uh the Lord blessed me this year to
[1:25:33] release [music] the first solo
[1:25:37] project.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Um it's it's titled finally
[1:25:50] and um it's because it's been years that
[1:25:54] people have asked me to [music] do
[1:25:55] something and uh it just just seemed to
[1:25:59] all come together uh during this season
[1:26:01] [music]
[1:26:02] and um on this project I got a lot of my
[1:26:05] family uh members [music] that have
[1:26:07] joined me in it and um I did
[1:26:13] Okay. I did 12 [music] songs and 11 of
[1:26:15] those songs was written by my precious
[1:26:18] mother, Sister Ellen Burs.
[1:26:23] [music]
[1:26:24] And and uh certainly thank God for her.
[1:26:27] My sister uh my daughter, my nephew,
[1:26:30] they all got together and collaborated
[1:26:32] and and kind of created the music uh for
[1:26:35] this this project. [music]
[1:26:36] And just a little story behind it, mama
[1:26:39] wrote most of these songs roughly 20 to
[1:26:42] 25 years ago. Uh [music] they have been
[1:26:45] sitting in a folder and uh some of it
[1:26:48] some of the songs that's [music] there
[1:26:50] are um uh there's songs about my journey
[1:26:54] into ministry and just trying to find
[1:26:57] the will of God before I moved out into
[1:26:59] [music] ministry and just struggling,
[1:27:01] you know, with the calling that God
[1:27:03] placed in my life. And uh so she wrote
[1:27:05] songs through those those that [music]
[1:27:07] time period of my life as I was having
[1:27:09] conversations with her uh God would just
[1:27:12] birth these songs. And now 23 years
[1:27:14] [music] later uh the ministry is uh we
[1:27:17] thank God that you know he he won the
[1:27:20] wrestling match. And uh uh but [music]
[1:27:22] 23 years later we look back and um and
[1:27:26] we say finally finally finally we have
[1:27:28] peace. Finally we have joy. [music]

[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; Come on, give the Lord a praise.
[2:04:56] Come on, we can do better than that. How
[2:04:57] many love the Lord? Come on. Come on.
[2:05:00] Come on. We can do better than that
[2:05:01] tonight. We didn't just come to hear
[2:05:03] some some good [music] music or some
[2:05:05] good singing, but I love you.
[2:05:09] Come on, somebody [music] praise him
[2:05:11] just for a minute. I love you, Jesus.
[2:05:14] Maybe you didn't get to tell them this
[2:05:16] week. Now's your chance to tell them. I
[2:05:18] love you, Jesus. [music]
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; I worship and adore you.
[2:05:26] Just want to tell you
[2:05:30] [music]
[2:05:31] more than anything.
[2:05:34] Maybe you forgot to tell him last night
[2:05:35] before you laid down said, "I love you,
[2:05:38] Jesus. [music]
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; I love you, Jesus.
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; I worship and adore you. [music]
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; Worship.
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; Just [singing] want to tell you,
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; Lord, I love you, [music]
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; Lord."
[2:05:56] Let's just say that in the partner.
[2:05:58] Lord, I love you more than anything.
[2:06:01] Say, "Lord, I love you [music]
[2:06:04] more."
[2:06:06] One more time from the bottom of your
[2:06:07] heart. Lord, I love you more.
[2:06:11] Lord, I love [music] you more than
[2:06:15] anything.
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; Somebody give him a praise tonight.
[2:06:19] Hallelujah.
[2:06:23] [music]
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:06:30] [music]
[2:06:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:06:34] [music]
[2:06:35] There's nothing about there something
[2:06:37] about just worshiping him and let him
[2:06:39] know how much you love him. He's proved
[2:06:43] his love to us
[2:06:45] when [music] he went to the cross
[2:06:48] and died for our sins. Some of us, we
[2:06:50] weren't even born, but he died before we
[2:06:51] were born.
[2:06:54] He made a way.
[2:06:57] I thank God
[2:06:59] for his great sacrifice at Calvary.
[2:07:05] We want to sing a song next. And we're
[2:07:08] going old school.
[2:07:11] [music]
[2:07:12] Some of y'all may remember this one, but
[2:07:16] I love it when we can sing the
[2:07:17] scripture.
[2:07:19] Sometimes we go through things in life.
[2:07:22] But Paul
[2:07:24] made [music] a statement
[2:07:27] says, "Be ye steadfast."
[2:07:32] And he said,
[2:07:35] "Unmovable,
[2:07:37] [music]
[2:07:40] always
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; abounding
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; in the work of the Lord." Then he says,
[2:07:46] "For as much as you know [music] your
[2:07:47] labor,
[2:07:51] It's not in vain. Turn around and tell
[2:07:52] your neighbor. Tell your neighbor. Say,
[2:07:53] "Neighbor, your labor [music]
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; is not in vain.

[2:09:06] [singing]
[2:09:07] [music]
[2:09:11] often [music]
[2:09:14] wonder why
[2:09:18] the clouds
[2:09:20] [music] seem to dim my sky.
[2:09:25] Even though I search
[2:09:27] [music] with hope and determination,
[2:09:32] so often [music] it turns to nothing but
[2:09:35] frustration.
[2:09:38] But when I kneel, I kneel
[2:09:42] down to pray. [music] Seems like I can
[2:09:45] hear the small voice of Jesus always
[2:09:48] seem to say
[2:09:51] [music]
[2:09:52] another
[2:09:54] way about me. [singing]

[2:10:19] Sometimes [music]
[2:10:21] the way seems so very hard,
[2:10:26] [music] so much so [singing]
[2:10:29] I [screaming]
[2:10:30] can't seem to lie.
[2:10:32] But when I kn knowing
[2:10:36] right from wrong,
[2:10:39] seems like [music] I just can't get
[2:10:41] enough courage. Stand up and be strong.
[2:10:46] But when I kneel, I kneel [music]
[2:10:49] down to pray.
[2:10:51] Seems like I can hear the small voice of
[2:10:53] Jesus always seem to say
[2:10:58] [music]
[2:11:00] I'm movable always
[2:11:03] [music] found [singing]

[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:20:17] [music]
[2:20:20] &gt;&gt; For unto us
[2:20:23] a child is born,
[2:20:26] [music]
[2:20:27] and unto us
[2:20:30] a son is given,
[2:20:33] [music]
[2:20:35] and the government shall be [singing]
[2:20:38] upon his shoulder.
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:20:42] &gt;&gt; And his name shall be called
[2:20:48] Wonderful
[2:20:52] Counselor.
[2:20:54] [music]
[2:20:54] Isaiah said, "The mighty God,
[2:20:59] the everlasting father, [music]
[2:21:03] and the prince of peace."
[2:21:06] Well, what makes him mighty?
[2:21:09] [music] Because he gets involved in
[2:21:11] things that only God can do.
[2:21:15] [music]
[2:21:17] You see, I'm reminded
[2:21:19] when the children of Israel came [music]
[2:21:21] into the Red Sea,
[2:21:23] the mighty God showed up. When Moses
[2:21:26] stretched out the rod, God opened up the
[2:21:28] Red Sea for the children of [music]
[2:21:29] Israel, but he closed it on Pharaoh and
[2:21:32] his army. He is a mighty God.
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; I'm reminded
[2:21:39] of when he went to the grave of Lazarus.
[2:21:41] [music]
[2:21:43] See, he did something that only God
[2:21:45] could do at the grave of Lazarus.
[2:21:50] [music] He was man and he was God. He
[2:21:54] was man when he began to weep at [music]
[2:21:57] the grave of Lazarus. But the prophet
[2:21:59] told us that he was God when he said
[2:22:02] Lazarus [music] come forth. The prophet
[2:22:06] also told us that had he not called
[2:22:09] Lazarus by name that everything that was
[2:22:13] in the grave would have come out [music]
[2:22:15] because he is a mighty God. Yeah.
[2:22:21] [music]
[2:22:23] That's what he is.
[2:22:26] mighty.
[2:22:28] [music]
[2:22:30] I'm a I'm a
[2:22:33] mighty mighty
[2:22:38] [music]
[2:22:43] [music]
[2:22:44] mighty
[2:22:48] mighty God. [music]
