Lord are you speak we ask these blessings and Jesus precious me and the church say hey man you love the Lord amen if you would grab your Bibles they may have we gonna straight to uh Hebrews four also take something from Galatians two and twenty so we're gonna read from Hebrews four first and then we'll go to Galatians the second chapter xx man you love the Lord man so you're really congratulations to the new grandparents I had to give my brother a hard time for you first got that boy I remember when when Sarah was born I think you're gonna try but God knows all things something special about all the grandchildren I'll tell you what man Andy yeah they look different than the chair and the sub special about those grandchildren oh man he rules for let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it not being mixed with faith in them that heard it for we which have believed do enter into rest and he said as I have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world for he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise and God did rest the seventh day from all his works and in this place again if they shall enter into my rest seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein and they to whom if it whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief amen let us go to Galatians amen the second chapter xx the first Galatians ii chapter xx first breeze on this was I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not i but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me may the Lord had a blessing to the reading there was a word Lord God we ask you Father to just take these this thought Lord garden may you've just planted into the hearts of the believers Oh father God that it may manifest Lord God its intent Lord God Lord God may our faith be elevated Oh father God may we recognize who we are Lord God recognize the time in the hour that we're living in Oh Lord God and we ask you Lord God to just have your way come down in the mighty way look are we in right your presence in O Lord God just as Moses Oh father God approach that burning bush Lord God you say take off your shoes Moses for your standing on holy ground now Lord God we believe Oh father God that you're still here Lord God doing the same works ulis the same God Lord God the same Oh father God you said you never leave us nor forsake us Lord God you'll be with us to the air no Lord now Lord God speak have your way Lord God in Jesus precious name Amen amen amen if I had to title proof of the resurrection a man proof of the resurrection I'd like to start off by a hypothetical question and the question is how many this evening is looking forward to the rapture and I believe if I ask that question everybody would raise their hand that we're looking forward to that great that they went up that spoken of and on all that a religious Christendom since crisis all been talking about one day he's coming back again and he's gonna take his people away we're expecting a rapture we expected God to come and deliver us from this evil place but my brothers and sisters what I want us to look at is you know we look at the cross and what it represents amen they represent sin crucified all right it represents sickness healed amen but I want you to understand that we're we're close to that rapture everybody's just couldn't agree to that we have to be God we're looking at the signs of the times I said Lord it's got to be close yeah I can't see I can't see how things can get much worse where there's all kind of science Lord understanding that we know that we want me healing in the rapture we won't need a bondage to be broken in the rapture we all of these things amen we won't need them anymore all right so I want to ask you then if that be the case what are we waiting for what are we waiting for you have faith hope and charity Oh puts things a fall as well well well I understand that this is supposed to happen and anything that is supposed to happen but Lord will one day you're going to come and you're going to and you're going to medicine all of these gifts right but faith says not one day now is the time now is the time if there was ever a time now is the time I was just sharing that in the back of a brotherhood this is my God when we when we first coming up as young boy and coming into this message we believed it almost instantly almost instantly because I there was just something in there right that was never a real question that we this makes sense this just makes with grandparents Moses went through all of the things that he went through and he was 40 years old and just coming into his purpose Wow so all of that time God was preparing him for that and I believe that this evening that God is preparing for the time is this we're going to get into some things I attached you actually to pray for me amen I want to say faith is not an option faith is a requirement for the believer it is not something that you can say well I have faith if you look if you go out into the streets and take a pole and go around and ask just pick a random hundred people and say do you have faith I bet you every land ooh I don't even know nothing absolutely is a requirement no because you receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the same thing that it took for you to believe that you see the same faith it's going to take for you to believe know that you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost now we're gonna look into that amen faith means believing in what the Bible said see faith faith has to have a friend our foundation it has you can't just blindly believe he said faith is a revelation a revelation of the word not my god faith is a you can't just have faith cause you know you can't just have faith cause you say you got me faith has to be revealed and I hope somebody God revealed this 'man what faith is by the help of the Holy Ghost faith is knowing that God's Word is true and everlasting it is knowing and putting all confidence into his word and all confidence into our lives taking that faith in God and putting it into action not just saying I got see but the Bible says that the just shall live by faith and my brother says that faith is gonna be tested that faith is gonna be put to the test amen I don't want to get ahead of myself the scripture says in Hebrews 11 but without faith it is impossible to please God for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of those that diligently seek a man now in order to know that Jesus Christ is the son of God when his spirit bears record with your spirit in an experience of the new birth what is an experience I looked up the word experience it is an encounter or an event or in a current that has taken place an experience of the new birth not just saying it it is an experience are you with me your spirit bearing record with his spirit in the experience of the new verse when your spirit bears record with his spirit your sons and your daughters God then you are a witness of the resurrection the message is proof of the resurrection how do you know ask the question not too long ago how do you know that he's risen whatever it cost the to empty well one of the arguments then was they stoled about proof of a resurrection not until he came and proved the Tyrell did they believed that he was resurrected you're gonna know that he's a resurrected God you can believe it by reading it oh you can believe it because somebody told you but you have to have evidence for you if you don't have evidence for yourself you can't have faith there's nothing there that have based the faith oh you have to know not because of it because what a preacher - it has to be an individual bearing yes spear in an experience to where you know why because he did me thin you can have faith he says I said I spoke this last winter he says it's like tuning a string on a guitar if I tuned into the note of C and say I'm a little low and that spring is a certain pitch or a certain octave then all of a sudden what do I have to do I have to put that string and listen to it it sounds a little low so I have to turn the knob on that string and your DC is it gonna pop is it gonna break no because that string is designed [Music] [Applause] [Applause] perfect of the test stream the prophets saying when it coincides in a demon that's got that person bound has got to turn loose that type of faith see when your spirit bears record with his spear then your faith will deliver you God has already done the work he already sacrifices of your sins remaining faith only way to have faith is through the baptism of Holy that your spirit is gonna bear record with his spirit the only way that your string is gonna sound in the same pitch that your voice is gonna speak the same as his voice nevertheless not i but Christ that they can't tell Dad everything that you speak at all is it caught because the pitch is justice now the only thing that is to do is to stimulate faith of the people that they might see see that's what we're doing here we're trying to stimulate your faith so that you can see is it you he's already done the world amen we're gonna get into some things amen we're gonna get into something the promise is unto you and to your children and to them that are far off as many as the Lord that God shall call God has got to keep his promise he did it in the Bible age he will do it in this age because he's the same yesterday today and forever amen my mind just went to go to somewhere and I say wait i'ma hold off on that there's nothing that we can do to heal a person nothing any man can do that would heal another we've seen brother Branham on the platform I didn't do it you you pull that angel to you it's nothing the only thing a man can do is preach the word put you in a direction to elevate your faith to believe every person in the world is already seen every person in the world is already healed hello it's enough got quiet on me I can back then show you the quote it's an expectation paragraph let's see here 20 right amen there's nothing okay every person in the world is already healed there's not one but that what's already healed there's not a sinner in the world but what already saved Jesus Christ when he died at Calvary he paid the price there that's right now the only thing we have to do is look there except all you have to do is accept it now you say well I got saved two years ago he says no sir you got saved 2,000 years nothing you got 1,900 but we done moved on 2,000 years ago you just accepted it two years ago the same question at Calvary there's two kinds of men two things that a man can't do a man can't forgive sins nor can i man heal it's not given to man to do that right Nick never was it was only in Jesus Christ and there a man by the preaching of the word can point you in that direction and you can accept your fountain your salvation or your healing and he was wounded for our transgressions and his spot his stripes we were healed past tense pastors the it's already done you just have to accept it the church say Amen now back let's make sure I'm not overlooking that cuz I'm gonna tell you what this some I got some good stuff here but I don't want to read too much but I don't want to miss nothing neither because what am I trying to do my brothers and sisters I am trying to get us to believe recognize who who we are where were and what's promised to us didn't there's no spirit but no demon and hail can stand before not a what he told a prophet if you can get the people to believe and your prayer is insisting still nothing will stand before God even cancer nothing will stand now I appreciate the the the material blessings thank you Lord Jesus for the houses and land and jury and all of these things new shoes thank you lord but place yo treasure on heavenly things what does it profit a man [Music] [Music] everybody say they going ahead there used to be a song about to say they're going to heaven right it's gonna be a great and dreadful day that great and dreadful would be grateful for a bride dreadful for the rest of them folk the real dress are you set right here to listen to the gospel in the steel mister real dreadful the prophets eat something now bear with me because I don't throw nothing at me to prophecy oh that's dad out of the kitchen is out of her please victory he said now let me see let me read about that ha ha remember the bride is a woman and we're in the kitchen and we're cooking look acts 2:38 in the pocket we're throwing a little a little Malachi 4:5 and we oh yeah that good let me tell you something every time we used to have a birthday mama would cook us our own cake Jack would give a carrot cake and I can't wait to he cuz you got to get the first slice once he get the first slice everybody could get some my cake was the German chocolate with the Carmel nuts in it man I get me a big hunk of that cake and sit down but you know what was so special about it was it was cook with love he gave us the ingredients but it's gotta be love when we went with somebody come on I called my mama half nine she always said why are you looking thin mama I ain't looking thin you look hungry I could have just a it's something men before in the kitchen every time is something that of lovable to feed we don't wanna get outta my teacher she's left her place position we realize that society has got to a place where it may take to win cause in this natural [Applause] when you got some my grandmother used to do it all the time check out a pot she's been in that cooking food smelling good probably where he's going with the food I'm going to the secret machete I'm going to the hospital just as someone so sick I'm going to feed oh yeah but she got to worry about cooking so now what's she calling over there you know sister he was wounded come into the house oh I got some on the stove something to talk to you [Music] [Applause] [Applause] he was talking to the bride glory to God not an Old Testament there was two types of ways that they have for a message one of them was a dreamer and the other one was by a prophet and then they had what was called the Urim therm okay when that dream of told that dream or that prophet that prophesy that your own family which was the breastplate of N had to light up if it didn't light up then it's not indicated it's not a vindicated word and don't believe it now the day we hover you infirmary it's God's Word God's Bible is the Urim third heaven and earth to pass away but not one word of this word shall shout you're not a man and this is the first and the foundation and the only foundation for Christian truth lays in God's Bible it has to come there now amen amen another question do you believe that you will raise and have an immortal body how many believe that this is the Prophet talking in the message Moses a man 50 0 1 1 0 29 the middle there somewhere how many believe that the resurrection that you will raise and have an immortal body now he says divine healing is the donal pavement or the earnest money of your immortal body he said see what I mean it is the evidence that you have an immortal body you'll see coming to the platform a little crippled twisted up children you see them stand here all misformed and out of shape you see it and you're with your own eyes see their hands and arms come straight and walk off the platform it's normal children you'll see people come here with all kinds of condition I'm prophesy here with all kinds of conditions and see them healed and leave the platform what is that that is the down payment that is the earnest you know that person you know that person someday if they stay under the blood of Christ will receive an immortal body cancer in black death don't it's the earnest of our salvation it's the earnest of our salvation divine healing divine healing is only the bait it is only the bait I love to go fishing and when I'm trying to catch a certain fish I use a certain kind of bait sometime it requires me to flawed genius get up early in the morning and I get my stuff together I get out there before daybreak you know the Prophet everybody has to have their place some some some some have a certain place in their home that they pray some have a closet some have a certain room some walk around believe the Prophet went to the mountain that's what he felt closer to God yeah I go to the water i hey there is nothing more tranquil to me then being on the water debris him abhi having my lines tight and ready watching further the don't that's what my wife called it we sitting like they're hunting Easter don't that's when the fish dump how do you know something's on the other line cuz I can feel him I can feel it pull it can you see him but I can feel him pull it so now the wisdom is when to set the hook divine healing is just the bait but it was all settled at Calvary it was all settled dead Calvary right there together now listen what the prophecy he says thing you never showed her fish to hook his show on the bait he grabs the bait and gets the hook he says about 98% and Jesus Christ meetings were all divine healings but he healed the sick to catch the psychology of the people to catch them to a place and then he preached the gospel to them what's the sense are you going to heal healed everything else but you still shrouded in unbelief the Prophet came and taught us that we smoked in adultery and all of these different types of things these are nice this is my unbelief it's just the opposite if you believe you say how do you know you're saved I believe I'm saying well if you don't believe you say then you that's it the sin is it's not to believe God will do what he say there's no way in unbelief that you're gonna take on them another body when Jesus went down to the multitude 2,000 people probably seeing multitude of 2,000 people why did he only heal one is what he only I do all of what the Father show but I remember same thing the Prophet I prefer to this day I'm waiting for that angel I'm waiting for the angel yeah oh wait a minute wait wait wait wait wait wait wait just over there your name is such-and-such you from such in such a place you got in like what are they that one any wins with only one happy woman with the issue of blood all of the people around them they just down Oh praising it and then touching them they just dead because of something that they heard they heard that he was the great man they heard on anything but this woman had see she knew that if I could just get to Jesus I'm she said this now listen I know I be made hope and she touched just to him of his garment your faith has made you whole no faith needed and your faith my brothers and sisters it's what's gonna have to do it he's already done it but he cannot do it over unbelief now he says you have two types of beliefs he say the Pentecost in the fool gospel I say and he said one it's fundamentally right but they don't have faith and the other one have faith but they also were he said it go one way to explain it is one guy money in the bank and don't know how to write a check and the other one can write a check but no money in the bank if you can ever get the two together he said we're being the millennium yeah now listen this is very important I want you to get this lordy God he says now if he hasn't got the Holy Spirit in there he's got nothing but just nor his mind to rest on it intellectual faith so he just can't comprehend the things of God he doesn't know them the natural mind can't understand the things of God they're foolish to you now the Pentecostal or the Full Gospel you are he says the one thing that I find the one of the greatest hindrances amongst us is that you're trying to place the things of God yet to comfort when you're right in the middle of it now now you say just wait a minute well that could be the millennium where we won't need any healings and things in the next age now you are the sons of God now we're seated together in heavenly places not we will be we are now this evening this afternoon right here now sons daughters of God seated together in heavenly places all things are possible when those little shackles of dark shadows get broken away the Holy Spirit can come right in and perform miracles I want to go back and read that again when those little shackles of dark shackles get broken away then the Holy Spirit can come right in and perform miracles Oh what he came there is nothing impossible just he says but just that little doubt sitting there nothing is impossible but just that little doubt sitting there it's what's gonna stop it okay he says here you have to have it based on faith that God's Word well then a man goes to school and he learns theology he reads it and say God said so yes I believe that he believes that in his mind see he says but you've got a sub conscious and the subconscious disagrees with this because when when he starts to do it he's no disco bless you he's a little bit scared that it won't happen if you a little bit scared that it won't happen then it won't not a lot of this kid little bit that it won't happen it won't happen see that's his spirit bearing record with your spirit right see you can't fake it you can't just say it I believe I believe I believe no I'm at work and my wife's call was safe honey I want you to stop by the store and get some milk before you come home nah okay baby i'ma stop by and get in the middle and I'll be right there well our pass and I'm not home yet now she is he told me he were gonna come with the milk I asked him for the milk he told me he was gonna bring the milk now she still believe him a brand new milk but she know me he don't probably got held up running his mouth sometime your blessing get held up but you can't was talking about the sister she came up to a prayer cuz she was having the stomach condition I believe it was some kind of reflux and every time she ate butter toast of whatever all her stomach her just gets so upset so she was in the meeting and she came into the prayer line and then the Prophet toll of a condition and everything and he said go you you'll be made whole and she had a friend there with her who had all the rides and a garden on the side of her neck and she went through the prayer line and she was healed too right away they went home and they say Sheba fixing the dirt and breakfast for school and they got a monster school and everything and they didn't eat all of it breakfast and then she said she says I'm so hungry I was hungry she went over there and she of the good news [Applause] [Music] [Applause] sold my wife tells me come home with

says he says it's got to go into your subconscious beyond your mental thinking that's just lip service it's gotta be in your heart your heart listen he say it's like a man that's crossing the sea that man goes across the sea he says the real man that drives the ship never sees where he's going right hey man thank you never sees where he's going down in the bowels of the ship he's the engineer the man setting up on the deck he takes and gives the orders from the man up in the crow's nest he says now he was seen down the word two nights to the left he says now then the man down here he don't see where he's going it's just the engine well what if he would give it two nuts to the right or if he just won't give it at all then the man up here what I either rat okay up here just wouldn't give it at all go forward and he put it in reverse and it goes backwards they'll never get out of the harbor he said that's the way to church you're going this way and you're going that away and yet now when the man up in the crow's nest says straight ahead the men are the men on the deck says straight ahead this man down in the bottom says straight ahead there's going to move when God says by His stripes you were healed the man received in his heart says by His stripes we are healed the subconscious you're going to move nothing can stop it you in full harmony not a wave I don't care what kind of waves come it'll never be contrary to your face when the man in the crow's nest the man on the day these three bear record [Applause] we're going somewhere bear with me amen amen now that's that dare to quote about the lady now hey man he says here well then okay yeah he says you got the Holy Ghost operating in your body well he says uh no let me read no no no let me back up I don't want to miss this like I was telling you it later this morning when she was framing me for breakfast and a big bunch of grease popped on her hand the first thing she just got scared to do you grabbed him and well where is the unguent team I guess some kind of ointment okay just as quick as you can there is the reason it burns you because here let's look at this man look at this you got the Holy Ghost it's operating in your body well when that old snake grabbed a hold of Paul's hand there was not a bit of scare he looked at it and shook it off in the fire and went on and got some more snakes nothing to it no fear it didn't scare him see when Peter come walking out on the water doing fine until he seen the waves of contrary and when he got scared he begin the scene Jesus picked him up why did you fear oh ye of little faith fear you're scared it won't happen don't have one bit of fear move focus God said so that settles it now listen listen listen listen listen listen listen this is this is this is gonna help you this is gonna help you lord have mercy he says and you can't do that until you have perfect no because perfect love casts out fear remember those three faith hope and charity amen he says if it want to contribute anything he says if I contribute anything to the success of my ministry amongst people is this I'll admit I have I have had to butcher up meetings because I just couldn't said it and in the routine like other ministers do he was talking about all of Robertson yeah Billy Graham and that other young fellow yeah TL Osborn hi they would come he said all Roberts got that Bulldog faith and he said TL are going to preach that thing called a educated see can you preach that thing so tightly can't help but believe but then they'll be healed Healing campaign he said many times I've had to promise he says back there because God will make me do it but he said if there's one thing it's because I have love for people and people know that you take a little baby three months old he don't know nothing he's got a mind and it isn't developing yet he don't know anything the doctor says he can see light he might see your hand but he can only follow it he's just kicking his little heels and screaming - the hot cup of his voice well he comes of some kind of woman comes along and pat him and say well dear and he just kicks right on and and he don't know who that woman is he knows don't know nobody but let that mother walk up just put her hands on that child that settles it now he don't know his mother but his little spirit knows there's something about that spirit that nothing else can inject that mother's love to him no matter how much that person loves it ain't that mother's love it ain't that mother's love so it's got to be a genuine it can't be our love have got to be the love of God listen and when the love and when the love of God and when we love God with all of our hearts and souls and minds and we love one another as ourselves our neighbors as ourselves the people can actually feel that you can't put it you can't put it on you can't make a belief cause they'll know it that's the only thing that catches out fear is perfect love perfect love and one bit of fear we'll what's the word I'm looking for contradict your faith so you have to love one and you can't it's got to come from a place of love is the heart that sinneth sin is unbelief already the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh the word of God comes from the heart of God because it's the spoken word that come from his heart it is a love story to the bride and when we read the word it's us falling in love with him saying that he promised us with it's a love affair and if our husband says he'll do something we know he'll do it and there's no doubt I'm not scared sometimes it may work our patients sometimes my wife may be yeah she tried he said he was gonna be home but he done got her done in his mouth but I'm coming just testing my patience amen now amen we go I'm trying to get some of our brothers and sisters amen now we look at Moses herding sheep on the backside of the desert and an angel appeared to him in the burning bush amen the angel appeared to him in the burning bush now the angel came down to bring the message to Moses and otherwise to be his guide now you can't guide yourself there's only two ways that that your way and God's Way and when your way you're out of God's way a man there's only two ways that's your way in God's Way and when you're in your way you're out of God's way and you have to forget your way and find God's Way and a man cannot lead himself he was called a sheep we're liking unto sheep amen now we see Moses I'm not my moped cuz I don't I don't I don't want to reality but I want you to see something here Moses went before the burning bush that is attention he look up on the mountain and he see this fire he's got his attention there I gotta go and see what this is so as he gets closer he began sort of realized he began to feel the presence of the Lord as you get closer so prophesy he come a little closer and he saved take off your shoes for the ground you're standing on this holy all kind of stuff coming to me here but I time is getting the way I want to get something round take off your shoes the ground you're standing on is holy the angel commissioned him says I have heard the cry of your people and I'm gonna send you back now let me let me let me let me let me regress it Moses had a peculiar birth he was had a peculiar life he knew some of the things that happened to him I mean the way he was hidden you know dinner put in a basket like the hand of God was on him as a child you see gifts on callings I without repentance if a person is not a dream when you can't tell him to dream even if he want to if he's not a person to see vision you can't make yourself this is a gift of God that is called from your birth that's given to you a minute amen so he told Moses Multan are not the Bible saying Hebrew by faith Moses went back and delivered the children of Israel out of Egypt now let me tell you something from what I read folk Moses they handle faith Moses say do this he said I'm a man of few words he said I can't I can't do it is he was raised and he was a leader of Federal Army he nobody would coming up against me go back and do what all right you know what I can't do this what's that in your hand Moses he said this there's no stick that I use the Shepherd being sheep throw it down right through the stick down it turned into a snake the Prophet say he ran no not a not not a voice the voice come out of the burning bushes same I pick it up he picked it up by the tail that came into a rock he says at that time it was no longer just a stick it was it was a judge Peeples a wooden stick that represented the circuit that represented the cross in our sins on the cross the Prophet said if Pharaoh could have ever got that stick away from Moses day to defeat and he says your speak today is the name of Jesus never take the name of Jesus Christ our rock so Moses went back and he did he followed the angel Moses didn't do not one miracle he just follow danger he followed the angel he was obedient to the voice proof of his resurrection my brothers and sisters fast forward to this 19th century we had a prophet and was born a peculiar birth peculiar birth right amen yeah I don't want to jack this one up I'm gonna read a little bit but I want you to see this here amen amen he says here he said now in the calling of this time he says I was born very humble parents but from the very time I was born something happened he says not of my own good and it's not of my parents goodness but it was about a foreknowledge of God he said when I was a little boy just about 12 years old it made its first he said about seven years old it made its first visible appearance in a wind in a bush sound familiar and then later knowing nothing about religion the only thing I noticed somebody told me there was a God and that all I knew about it that's all I knew about it until I was a man and then after being converted and become a United with the Baptist Church and one day on May the 7th while coming in and I was a game warden in Indiana by the way on the street today since I met a man and maybe here in the auditorium mr. price from Indiana I used to say I used to say his state at his house when I was patrolling through there and he probably in the building now little did I ever know that I meet him on the streets in Houston but he and his wife are here they're vacationing to to Florida and came to the meeting something pulled my heart at that time but one day it made itself is visibly known it was a man about six foot tall weighing some 200 pounds when it come down when it come a few years before come down in in the form of the light and hung over where where I was where I was at it come down many times here in the form of a star where thousands of people stood and looked at it it made its visible appearance right in this auditorium and so forth and different things taking place this time he comes as a man he says and I was scared he walked towards me he said do not fear I'm sent from the presence of the Lord I sent from the presence of God said to tell you that you are peculiar worth and a peculiar life has been indicated that you're taking a gift of divine healing to the people of the world and said that if you get them to believe and be sincere when you pray there's nothing that will stand before your prayers well I said I'm uneducated served he said I'll be with you and said that that you might know it'll come to pass that you'll take people by the hand and their left hand and you'll be able to tell and said you feel the results now he says I call it vibrations upon the hand you become familiar with it and you'll tell the people the disease that they got in their body and then you and then if you'll be now then I was in Texas the other time that was in operate that was in operation is that right and you was in my meetings before raise your hand if you was in operation if you've seen him in operation and and if this now you people raise your hands all the way in my means if you know that it seen it in operation not perfect because he said was not perfect because he was still learning how to use it but see the God gave him two things as well he gave Moses two and he gave this Prophet truth now remember I said the healing was just debate there was a voice Moses had to recognize and follow the voice that was coming out of this sign this prophet followed the angel amen now my brothers and sisters you are a holy nation a peculiar people a royal priesthood and an angel has come to you and told if you only believe nothing is impossible he said what scientific was given to sign Moses was given to sign he said go ye therefore until all the nations baptizing them in the name of the Father Son and the Holy Ghost and these signs shall follow them that believe these signs shall follow them that believe the sign his only debate amen is only debate the miracles the signs it is the voice so there was a voice with Moses a man and the children the children of Israel had to hear Moses his voice Moses had to hear the engine they had to hear Moses our prophet heard the angel we have to hear the prophet not a world have to hear us why because we've taken all of this food that was laid up and we in the kitchen cook we in the kitchen cook we in the kitchen cooking and there's a de voice of the sign the spirit in the bride not then now is the time we're living in the day we're living in the greatest hour but we're also living in the most treacherous out now is the time now is the time if I can do nothing else I want this first surface to elevate your face to elevate your faith that's your subconscious your subconscious can take a whole of this word and believe nothing nothing is impossible there used to be a turn when and listen when we come to service early and pray not not not not not not if you don't have nothing to pray for for yourself pray if you if you can walk through this world and see the lostness of the people that you come in contact with and your heart don't burden for them you ain't got the Holy Ghost take the time and look as you see diff young boys young ladies and I say Lord what can I do I'm just I ain't got no great speech but I was born to put you I know you wit me Kimmy what the same thing you just talked to the Prophet said this that Peter and Paul came to the gate of beautiful because they were preaching the gospel the man heard them and when they shadow walked over it wasn't a shadow that healed man it was the main faithful word what they will preach cause he heard what they were pre if we we have to understand that we have to get the faith huh people don't believe that these things exist people have they don't believe in divine Hitler they don't believe that they found that data that they're bound and chains of the devil they don't believe it it's up to us we are a final voice to the final age you will peculiar people you was raised for a purse to carry the Word of God remember you tuned in with that stream your voice sounds just like his voice stay in the kitchen my brothers and sisters stay in the kitchen take it to the street feed the hungry see this world get that soaking the land they gotta go feed them that's all well and good but that's natural we talking by spirit every chance I get oh brother let me tell you something we serve a god that's right god it's coming back literally but he's already back spiritually wake up you had a final voice you want to find a voice the Prophet they say they came to a brother Branham don't smoke don't drink don't defy your body we had an angel coming at us and see it don't smoke don't drink don't cut your hair don't wet your pants take off the makeup do all these things you are the final voice if you don't say nothing your life speaks you walk different time different not in the millennium let us stand to our feet a man I hope brothers and sisters that something was saved to elevate your faith to believe that nothing nothing is impossible it's one thing a man houses and linen but we want to see Honda's broken Moses went to deliver the children out of oppression bondage there are people down when I go to the doctor sometime I have to undress I just recently went to the doctor and had to have an EKG a young lady told me to take my clothes take your shirt off t-shirt - oh okay you ready for this young girl he goes at one time I went to the doctor the young lady asked me to take off her clothes and asked my wife to step back yeah yeah she looked I said hold on hold on dammit why she just say she don't have to stay man when there's an emergency situation the first thing they do is come and they cook they can't fix you with all of them leaders God can't fix you with all of these layers you have to come naked before ah because under those layers could be hiding certain things and see the Jesus see the fivefold ministry has to handle it with nurse gloves with nurse gloves see I had to Nick it before the nurse but she's a professional this is her job she can handle this because this is what has to be done so that the healing can take place of whatever the sickness is if you have a problem take off the covering the religious cover and come before Lord Here I am and you as brothers and sisters with the love of God for sin and sickness and bondage and oppression and depression sometimes you can do it sometime you have a cut I never seen know about to do an operation but nobody fully clothed tell to rip off the leaves come naked to the altar and ask God Lord I want to be healed I want the Holy Ghost come musicians I want my sphere to bear record with your spirit that nothing is impossible and that one day I'll take off this mortal flesh and put on a near mortal body only believe you love him Church now is the time my brothers and sisters now is the time there's a lost lost sensing world and we cross paths with them every day and if we don't have a burden amen then something is wrong don't keep coming here in the presence of God in a shame to undress before a shame to come naked before he's seen you he knows anyway come clean if thou be made whole [Music] only believe Amen all things are possible if you only believe what would your heavenly Father Lord God I just thank you Lord God for letting me deliver my soul I believe with all my heart Lord God that this message each changed its message about three or four times believe this is what you wanted your people to hear raise our faith of God to believe Oh God made people who ever walk through

now all things are [Music] Oh [Music] that all things are things are [Music] what I believe hallelujah Lord I received say Lord I receive yes I do Oh Lord I receive because all things are possible [Music] Lord I receive where now Lord Lord I receive [Music] yes for all things are possible [Music] just keep playing softly I'm gonna appreciate the word of the Lord on tonight the resurrection man we thank the world for a precious brother so much was shared I don't want to try to recap it all but one thing that really struck me was a statement that they said if we just have a little if we were just a little bit scared that it won't happen then it won't just if there's just the low fear maybe you know Lord I believe I got faith and I know that you can do this that sometimes hope in turns any would say well you did it for this person so I know you'll do it for me but it's not really faith standing but God whether you did it for anybody or not it's mine because you promised to me promised it to me sometimes you know we in turn to hope sometimes we're in turn to faith but we want all fear just to be removed and perfect love casts out all fear we don't want to be afraid of anything never afraid of one of God's promises right if one thing God cannot do if there's at least one thing that he cannot do God can't feel today man he's never failed and he won't fail now so Church we want to believe with everything we have and any man like a brother traversed and God's got some great things in store a man and not just houses and cars and things like that that's that's good but we want to see the spiritual things of God so we need we need blessings in both the upper springs and the and the lower Springs we we want heavenly blessings as well as earthly blessings but we want all that hallelujah Church I'm under expectation it's just thinking you know to myself there's something that I wanted to do tonight as we were entering this this Good Friday and I received a little text and you know with a quote and I said you know I like this and and I felt that it would just be very appropriate for us tonight we're coming out of a time of fasting and we're coming into this weekend or services and and brother Anna asked a question he said how many would like to rededicate their lives to the service of the Lord on this Good Friday night anybody would like to rededicate their life and he was preaching one good Friday night and then he acts that question in church and and many lifted their hands like we've done here tonight and and and he prayed a prayer and I want to pray this over you so just just bow your heads amen and just listen to the words of his prayer and in your heart I want you to just think about rededicating yourself to the service of the Lord there's been any doubt or unbelief or anything X God to forgive you for those things and ask him to just reimagine it you could just only believe Amen that you can only believe it Manny he makes this the statement here and I just want to I want to read it amen he says Lord on this Good Friday night so it's father I pray that you bless these who lifted their hands and those who did not even have the courage to do it and while I'm praying it's just if your hands to heaven while I'm praying to slip your hands to heaven and keep your eyes closed it says we prayed that the all-sufficient one tonight will bless every one of them we're thinking of Calvary God our Savior laid in the shame taken down was given to the hands of a wealthy man who taking this body after begging Pilate took it over and wrapped it in some clean linen - laying in the grave oh god what a feeling must have been over those poor disciples seemed like they were defeated at that time the one they had trusted so much was now gone but not for long just a bleeding sacrifice that was all some day a few hours later he arose and then joy came help us tonight Lord as we're in this season may it be upon us that we'll see the suffering that it costs for our Redemption the sadness it costs for us to be happy and may our souls tonight Lord we consecrate ourselves to thee and our souls be afflicted to look yonder and see what oh god what a horrible death how cruel sin must be and I pray father that you'll bless us together now and help down me O God as just servants standing here with the very poor voice and you children waiting to hear something from the word help me Lord and break the word of life freely to every everyone as we rededicate our lives and our hearts the tears of our hearts dropped down deep in our bosom when we think of a sacrifice help us now but we ask it in Christ's name Amen amen amen aid man thank you Jesus hallelujah it's just finger sing a few more courses of this song and so we just think about what he did for us some 2,000 years ago we don't have to walk in fear we can walk in faith it's already done Church whatever it is that you believe in God for it's already done you don't have to be afraid you don't have to be scared if God made the promise be sure to fulfill him he's sure to fulfill I don't care I'm possible it may seem there is nothing impossible if we only believe come on let's keep

is when we are in our place Israel was blessed as long as they were in the land when they got out of the land they lost their blessing so father we pray that we would just receive what we heard here tonight and God I have the scripture that was read we're crucified with Christ nevertheless we live yet not as that's us that's living but if it's Christ living on the inside and we thank you Father
