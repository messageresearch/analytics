tasted that the Lord is gracious to whom coming as unto a living Stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God and precious ye also as Lively stones are built up a spiritual house and holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold I lay in Zion a Chief Cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded ain't no Rock like our unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which is which be disobedient excuse me the stone which the builders

stranger to us amen he and his precious wife sister Sarah amen they have visited us many times I've been here in fellowship with us and and uh but this this morning brother Jonathan comes with amen a new responsibility amen he has to deliver to us the word of the Lord and the Lord has called him to Ministry for a little bit now and I was telling him this morning one of the things that I appreciate about ministers is when they can wait on their Ministry the Bible tells us that a man's gift that maketh room for himself and it brings him before great men and for me when I see a minister that's just able to wait on this ministry and just wait on the Lord to open up the door not trying to push Doors Down you ain't got to force no Doors Down down when God called you to minister you ain't got to do that God will always open up the door oh somebody I'd have said man I'm a living witness you know every every everywhere that I've gone it's been because God has called me there it's not because I went seeking an opportunity I don't have to seek opportunities there's there's um 52 weeks in a year and there's two Services a week at Spirit of Truth Tabernacle that makes 104 services that I can preach right here so I don't have to go anywhere right here there's this this Pulpit is where I can preach from and I thank God for that but you know what the Lord does is that he don't just call me here he's got others that he won't preaching from this pulpit and I get fed too when the other ones come so I thank God for that right but what I want to just say is that we wait on the Lord amen for any door to open uh for us and this morning the Lord has opened the door for our brother Jonathan to come and to deliver his heart to us and tonight another door has been open for our brother and I'm so grateful to see the Lord do these things amen amen it means so much to me amen so uh we'll get ready to welcome him but let's just pray before he comes amen father we just come first praying over the offering net you have blessed us to be able to give you've blessed us with jobs we've blessed us with businesses God and sometimes you go beyond our just normal means of income you go beyond and bless us in other ways and father we are grateful to be able to come and give it back to you in the forms of time that offering father we ask that you would use this for the further to be a kingdom may you Lord continue to expand amen or what you would have us to be a part of we realize that even where we are right now God is temporary so we're thanking you in advance Lord for the new church and new school we we know that you have it all under control and your timing is perfect amen we ain't got to force no doors open you'll open every door God supernaturally you will open every door Hallelujah so father we just asked that you would move a man in our giving and father also we want to access you a bless your servant Lord as he would come this morning brother Jonathan Lord just to deliver his heart to us we Lord we pray to it use them Father hide them behind the cross that he might not be seen but may Christ be on display and you get all the glory and all the honor and all the praise from what happens in this place it's in Jesus name we pray amen let's stand to our feet we want to welcome brother Jonathan Houchin a man to the pulpit this morning trust the Lord will use him amen and a special way to speak to every heart amen Mercy to rewrote my life amen is that your testimony let's sing with all our heart amen I should have fallen oh I should have fallen my soul cast down but first yes it did it rewrote mine Hallelujah [Music] my [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] yeah Mercy because [Music] [Music] amen amen [Music] you know that song is uh that's become my theme song God's mercy praise His Mercy rewrote my life there's been a lot of people born Through the Ages different ones born for different reasons Michael Jordan was undoubtedly born to play basketball but I was born to be a believer Peyton Manning was born to play football but I was born to be a believer Wayne Gretzky was born to play hockey but I was born to be a believer was anybody else in here born to be a believer I believe we have a room full of Believers to [Music] I want to thank brother Jack for having me it's been a it's been a journey first time I ever met brother Jack was on a golf course shook the man's hand I knew there was something different about that man I knew he was born to be a believer all right first time I came into this church and met this group of people looked around these brothers in the way they were dressed said man these are my brothers right here these are my brothers I hope nobody takes offenses but you know it's not fair a black man can dress to the nines and he can go preach in the hills of Kentucky and nobody says a thing but a white man no I gotta put on a white shirt just a basic jacket so I took the liberty this morning we're putting on that purple shirt and a gold tie so once again I I really appreciate the invite I know Sarah is out here my wife she's been getting her worship on brother Solomon she's been waiting for this truly love this church I fell in love with you guys the moment I got here and uh yes sir thank you musicians [Music] but uh yes if we could uh turn in our Bibles to Psalms 23 we're going to read one through six and I think this is probably very familiar to most of you most of you probably know this by heart Psalms 23 1-6 the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadeth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the path of righteousness for his name's sake yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou prepares the table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever let's pray dear heavenly father Lord as I stand here before this group of people father your group of people Lord Lord and I can feel your presence here father Lord here we are in this little little room here in a school father it doesn't matter if we're here if we were out in a field or if we were in the nicest Church in this nation father Lord the main thing is is that you are here Lord and you promised where two or three are gathered in your name you would be in the midst father so Lord I pray father that you would just take complete control of this service Lord I pray that everything that I say father would just be what you would have me say Lord Lord I pray that you would anoint me I pray that you would anoint your people father Lord let him hear what they would what you would have for him Lord let them open their hearts father and receive what you would have Lord Lord we thank you for all that you do for us Lord we love you with all of our hearts in Jesus name I pray amen you may be seated thank you so the name of my sermon is climbing higher and I read the the scriptures because they they fit so well with our journey through life I took the I took those scriptures and I wrote a little thing here just what they what that means to me he will feed Me Guide Me and protect me even though I walk through a valley of death I have nothing to fear because he is with me with his rod and his staff he will protect and guide me which comforts me because his goodness and mercy follow me I know that he loves me he loved me before I loved him and I will be in his presence all the days of my life I'm gonna tell you a little story here about what inspired this sermon so Sarah and I we like to hike I know that's hard to believe that this fat guy can actually hike but I can so we like to hike so we went to Colorado and Sarah picked out this hike that she wanted to do and it's called the the Manitou incline okay it's 2744 steps that go up the side of a mountain it's uh 2 000 feet up it's almost one mile up there was another one that we did in Gatlinburg Tennessee it's called the Ramsey Cascades it's 2200 square 2200 feet up in four miles now that one right there when we went in and we were talking to the guide and we were just telling him you know we wanted a you know just like a casual hike is what we were looking for and when he started explaining to me what it was I misunderstood what he said I I thought he was talking about the the grade but he was talking about how many feet up it was in four miles so on that one right there we went we were very unprepared okay so we had just I think we had two and a half bottles of water with us uh and I mean it was a it was a hike I mean it was rough I mean it was one of those hikes where you you started going up this and you I mean it was very tempting to turn around and say never mind it was a hike and the the higher you got the harder The Climb guy wow there's no markers on this Trail there was one it was a I think a mile and a half in it told us we had two and a half miles to go no markers anywhere you had no idea how much further you had to go because you couldn't see anything the turns and you know the trees and everything you can't see nothing you're just hiking hard but the one in Colorado it's steps there's markers periodically telling you what step you're on so it's marked a little differently so the view from from the start of each of these was was drastically different Colorado we're standing at the bottom of the steps and you're looking up and that day was it was a little rainy a little cloudy so I mean the stairs just literally disappeared into the clouds so but I mean but you could see what you were doing you know the one in Tennessee there's trees you're I mean you know we were in the the forest there's trees you can't you know you can see maybe you know 100 yards in front of you and then you can't see any further so you you know that's that's kind of what you know they look like at the beginning but you know before we even started these you know well more or less the one in Colorado we kind of got a plan together you know how are we gonna how are we gonna try to tackle this you know it's a lot of steps so there's a thought process of well you know maybe we'll do so many steps at a time and we'll take a break so we started getting a plan together for that one now the one for Gatlinburg as I mentioned no not so much of a plan just because me and not understanding what this guy was trying to tell me you know so we didn't have so much of a plan but as we started hiking on each of these we started you know you you notice different things some of them some some places where you get is dangerous as I was mentioning Colorado it was it was raining a little bit and you know these steps they're just wooden railroad ties I mean they get they get slippery you know and you're a long ways up you don't want to slip okay you know and then then in in uh Gatlinburg you know you get to uh you know places where the path Narrows and there's some sharp turns and the there's roots and rocks everywhere it's not good footing and I mean it wouldn't take nothing to misstep and fall off the the side you know so I mean it was dangerous it you know it was it was rough the terrain was rough and it was dangerous areas and in Colorado the further we got up the colder it was getting my hair started freezing up I was reaching down picking up these ice Pebbles off the ground which was the coolest thing I think I've ever seen they were like perfectly round all of them exactly the same size it was like God's ice machine you know it was just super cool you know um but um but the views the higher up we went the better the view got you know you get up those those stairs in Colorado you turn around and you look and you're you know you're looking down through the clouds you know just beautiful view you know in Tennessee it wasn't so much as looking out but just looking at the different things the stream that was running beside you the waterfalls you know just beautiful views but then there was one other thing that we noticed and that was the people there's many other people on these trails some of them were climbing faster some of them were climbing slower some of them were just kind of with us we stuck with a group for quite a while at one point we just kind of you know walked together up the the one in Colorado but you look around some of them they needed help some of them were there to help so of course this got me to thinking about our spiritual walk and that's what we want to talk about so let's talk about this spiritual climb that we're on so we are every one of us in this room amen we're all born the same way we were all born in sin yes shaped in iniquity came in this world speaking lies every one of us neither one of us was born indifferent he didn't take anybody and say I must start this one out a little bit ahead of this one or I'm gonna start this one out a little bit behind this we started out the same place so as you start this climb what are our expectations should we have expectations and should we be placing expectations on other people because I can tell you in this climb you will only climb as fast as he wants you to go you will only go as fast as he will allow you so it doesn't matter what this person's doing this person's doing or what this person's doing up here don't have an expectation of I'm moving too slow just allow him to lead you and guide you brother Brown said in 1961 we must be born again tell them all about yeah I'm sorry 61 we must be born again tell them all about this tonight you're a sinner tomorrow you're a manifested sons of God nonsense where do you get that in the word babies are not born men they're born babies right and grow them in so what should the expectation be according to brother Branham we all start as babies spiritually again we all start in the same the same place but as we come to these First Steps first part of this path we're all going to by human nature develop a plan as as Sarah and I did on the steps to Colorado so you start to develop a plan you know what this should look like maybe it's where are we going to go to church how often are we going to go to church how often are we going to read our Bible how often are we going to pray are we going to do devotions or not but you start to develop a plan right right I think human nature that you we do that because we want to see results you know I am person that I don't plan anything you can ask my wife it drives her absolutely crazy I don't plan nothing I go whatever whoever is doing what I'm good with that until it comes to food and then I might have something to say with that but I don't plan but you know she plans and and and that's great you know and it's because you know we we want to start off with a plan because even even when I I start to work on a project that you know there's a plan because even though I'm not a planner I still want to see results so on our Manitou climb in Colorado we you know before we do this we think you know let's start off doing 50 steps at a time let's see how that goes let's see if I can still breathe after 50 steps if I can hey let's increase it to 75 maybe we'll go to 100. but that was the plan the first few steps that you take will always typically be your easiest steps you start coming to church and it's like well maybe I'm only going to come once a month you know this is this is where where it's the easiest is right here but shortly after a few steps that's when your plan will start develop to develop because you will have a plan so that plan will start to develop and you will catch the eye of somebody because you're going to start making a little bit of movement maybe you go four or five steps maybe you get 10 15 Steps but you're going to catch the eye of somebody and that's somebody's name is Satan now Satan is going to look over there and he's thinking okay they're making a a few steps here no big deal I've got I got bigger problems with the people that are up here in front of them okay so maybe I'm just gonna throw a little I'm broke demon their way okay I'm broke like I can't go to McDonald's demon their way okay or maybe I'm gonna send a demon of you know a sickness demon that way not nothing in big you know I'm just gonna give them you know a bad back or something you know just you know now people when this comes and it's coming it is coming when this comes there are people that may say hey you know what I don't want no part of this you know before I was serving the lord I didn't have these problems I had plenty of money wasn't nothing wrong with my back let's let's back up here let's go backwards other people will freeze up maybe if I stand here and I don't move he'll leave me alone but then there's the few that it will Propel forward and it will propel them forward because they are developing a relationship with Christ and then those times come when he starts attacking they'll get to their knees and they'll start praying they'll start asking for help and it'll move them forward now in your physical in these physical climbs like as I was saying we had these different markers that we were we would come to like on the the man too we have the telling us where we're at there's spiritual climb is really no different as you're climbing you're going to hit different markers um as I said like in Colorado I don't know it was maybe every 200 steps there was a marker telling us where we were at now in Tennessee it was a little different we had one marker we did have a marker but it was only one so it was a lot of times again you're climbing you have no idea where you're at what's going on you know maybe there's and there was very few people on that trail so even trying to find somebody to ask for help was difficult but so as you're climbing you come to a marker I have just realized that Jesus Christ is alive and that he loves me and he died for me this is a marker that I've hit so I made it to a first marker now I really start exercising my plan I start climbing a little faster now the only way you're going to climb faster is by Revelation amen amen Revelation is found in our Bibles right it's found in our tapes tapes yes yes I'm gonna tell you guys a little story real quick brother like I said I don't I don't keep a timer so come take it if I'm too long okay so about two months ago I wake up I think it was about two o'clock in the morning I wake up my ribs over here hurting bad I had this pain in my back my like right here in my chest just I it was hard I didn't know if I was having a heart attack I wasn't sure what was going on wasn't no way I was letting my wife call a doctor is like Lord if it's my time take me home but so but the pain started getting worse and worse I'd never experienced anything like this before so I get up out of bed and I go down into another room of the house because I didn't want to wake her up but eventually she comes down there and I was in so much pain I was banging my head against the wall I've never been in that much pain in my life it's just my wife she Googles that's what she does so she starts Googling to see what you know these symptoms what's going on she comes up with them having a gallbladder attack so she puts in a prayer request on our our church thing which was amazing to see the response about three o'clock in the morning how many people started praying for me right then was unbelievable but a couple hours after that the pain goes away she's telling me that I've had a gallbladder attack I tell some you know some some of the people from the church were asking me about it and I said well it appears I had a gallbladder attack and there was many of them saying well that won't be the last one you're gonna have to have that gallbladder removed I was like well you don't know my God so I've always heard that peanuts nuts any kind of a nut will bring on a gallbladder attack so the next night I told my girls go up to Dairy Queen get me a Snickers blizzard with extra Snickers because I'm just stupid that way some people say man you're gonna poke the bear you know and I'm like you know what I'd rather poke him and see him coming from in front of me than him jump on my back so I get the blizzard I eat the blizzard no problems at all I'm claiming I'm Healed it's about six weeks later I think it was a Sunday night right after service and I mean right after service we had I haven't even left out of the church yet I started feeling that pain in my ribs like all right Satan here we go so we go and we meet some people at at a little restaurant and I'm sitting there and the pain is becoming more and more intense and I'm like well I'm not going to fight this sitting right here so I text my wife she was sitting at the other in the table I said I don't want you to ask me a single question because I ain't I'm not going to profess what what what Satan's trying to put on me so don't ask me nothing but we need to go home she said okay so we get in the car we go home I asked her I said you have a pain medicine any pain pills she's like yeah I I've had one gallbladder I don't even know if a pain pill will work I don't know so I I take the pain pill we get ready for bed I take the pain pill we lay down in bed she starts playing a tape just so happens to be on a prayer line I'd had a pill in me for five minutes okay brother Brandon prays for two people he says you're healed just like that the pain left not slowly it left like that is not a pain pill that did that it was because there is an anointing on those tapes there's an anointing on those tapes that is why I listened to tapes that is why we should be listening to tapes I have a pen that I normally wear and I forgot mine and I forgot brother Jack so when you come to Indiana I'll give you yours it says tape boy okay because I am a tape boy I've had people say I don't know how you can wear that pin and I'm thinking how do you not wear the pen are you a message believer do you listen to tapes I'm a tape boy I can't help that a group of people have tried to make that something it's not I am a tape boy and there's an anointing on those tapes we are message believers foreign Revelation comes from the word of God this is how you climb higher amen now in your earlier stages of climbing some things are going to start to develop one of the first ones that you will see develop is leadership what I mean by leadership in our physical climb when Sarah and I would hike anytime we hike now she walks faster than me in in 99 of the cases she walks faster than me okay I don't get I don't get in a hurry for much that's just me unless I'm at work you put me in Lowe's or Home Depot all of a sudden I become like Mr Speedy okay I don't know what it is but that's just how I am but so but when we go on a hike I will normally when that path like on that that hike in um Tennessee that path narrowed and it was single file well I got in front of her now I know I'm aggravating her because she's wanting to go faster than me but there's something inside of me as a man that I was born with I was born to want to protect I was born to want to provide and to lead okay that's how I was born I can't help but that's how I was born so when we hike I want to be the one in front because if something's going to go wrong I want to be the one that can that can protect my daughters will run off in front of us sometimes and I'm telling them slow down get back here you know because I want to protect them I want to lead them well in your spiritual walk there's this is no difference leadership will show when Sarah and I started coming back to church this has been a little over five years ago she had a question of why are you growing faster spiritually what was because headship was starting to develop there wasn't nothing that I did I didn't even know I didn't know how to answer her question I don't know I could see what she was saying yes I'm moving faster spiritually but why I don't know was because headship was starting to develop leadership headship same thing so I looked this up when you're when you're a professional rock climber the responsibility lies on that lead climber a lead climber he knows how to stack a rope so you don't get a nod in a rope he knows exactly how to do that he knows how to do what's called closing a system which is putting a knot in the right place so nobody slides off he knows how to attach quick draws and anchors for everyone as they're going up he knows how to properly clip bolts so no one Falls knowing uh uh to skip quick draws to ensure every step is done properly so he knows how to tie everybody off one of the most important things that I thought or I saw was the lead climber must always see and be able to identify fall potentials so as headship starts to develop and here we go Brothers so what does headship look like and why are why why or why not would it manifest headship is the order in which he from the beginning said this is how I want my family to look that is what headship is Ephesians 5 22-25 wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that scripture is headship yes I see men in message churches [Music] that walk around with that chest puffed out they want to be the leader in their house when it comes to how is my wife going to look whether she's going to look Holiness or not but how's she going to look is she going to work or not how submissive is my wife going to be where are my kids going to go to school are they going to school go to a public school home school are they going to play sports or not how involved are they going to be in sports when it comes to dating oh they're going to really have their their words in that yeah this is dictatorship there's a big difference between headship and dictatorship dictatorship is done without love it is done because I said you're going to do it because I said you're going to do it there's nothing biblically to back it up there's nothing that is dictatorship headship though these men when it comes to leading their their their their families spiritually they run and they hide like a coward because they do not want to be responsible to be as that lead climber they don't want that responsibility now the scenario that I'm talking about right now is typically My Generation or above okay but let's talk about the new generation that's coming up the ones that are below me these young men seem to be having a problem getting out of mommy and daddy's basement they're down there playing their playing their video games they're having problems here but like I mentioned before from the beginning of time men were born with something inside them something to lead to protect to provide that is how we were born now Society is doing everything they can do to tear headship down they are reaching in and they're pulling this out and they're saying to a young man no you are not allowed to do this because men and women are equal and so what do you get from the result of this you get a man that is in his mom and dad's basement because he doesn't know what to do he has a desire to do one thing but Society is telling you no you cannot do that amen but when the enemy comes in like a flood he will raise up a standard against it he's calling us Brothers to be that standard he wants us to be the standard for the world to be able to see what headship is supposed to look like [Applause] now I'm sure you guys have heard these statistics before and I use these a lot and I heard them from this man right here statistics Nationwide statistic this is not a message statistic this is Nationwide you have a family that's not going to church and a child decides to start going to church out of that family three and a half percent chance that the family will follow that child all right same family the wife mother decides to start going to church it's a 17 chance that that family will follow right but if the father of that same family starts going to church there's a 93 chance that that family is going to follow you so Brothers if you decide you're going to sit at home on Sunday if you decide you're not going to read your Bible you're not going to pray there's a 93 chance that family is going to follow that but if you decide you're going to go to church you're going to pray you're going to do devotions with your family there's a 93 chance that family is going to follow you my Lord amen so no matter how much Society is trying to say this is wrong those statistics don't lie that Gap is enormous on the difference between even the wife and the husband we're needing some men to stand up and say I will not bow down to this feminist demon I'm not gonna back off because it was not so from the beginning so if you're not leading your family in the way that you should I ask a question why is it because you've let something go on for too long you don't know how to Reign it back in or are you living a lifestyle that you don't want to change if it's that first one I urge you to get on your knees and ask him for help he will help if you try to tell me he won't you came too late when we started coming back to church I found myself in this exact situation my wife's closet my girl's closets were full of clothes that I bought them that were not appropriate how am I going to walk into that closet and clean it all out how am I going to tell them now you can't wear that fingernail polish how they didn't have any respect for me before that how are they going to respect me after that so what did I do I got on my knees and I said Lord I said you gave them to me and I did not do my job I need you to do it and I stood back and I watched as he started changing them the clothes started changing the way they were acting started changing it wasn't me I was doing my part I was trying to lead I was Lee I was following him and he just let them follow right on behind me so if you're in that situation don't tell me that prayer don't change things you came too late now if you're leading your family in a way just because of a lifestyle shame on you I urge you I beg you to start a relationship with him Because unless you change what's happening there's a 93 percent chance at follow that family will follow you straight to hell no pressure gentlemen but brother that's headship so I urge you grab your families lead them but lead them the way Christ leads you with love [Applause] let's get back to the markers here so headship has developed maybe the next one you receive the Holy Ghost it's a big marker right here how do I know I have the Holy Ghost well your fruits will show you'll have a desire to go to church you'll have a desire to fellowship with other believers I'm gonna tell you another story it was a few months after I received the Holy Ghost Sarah and I took a trip for our anniversary and we went to San Antonio Texas we were staying on the the Riverwalk the last night that we were there now I've never been a big drinker in my entire life but the last night we were there we stopped at this I think it was a British restaurant or something we're sitting outside the rivers literally I mean right here beside us beautiful night they sit down a menu I look down one of my favorite drinks I think it was a what was a passion fruit daiquiri oh man that looks good it's like you know what ain't nobody around here nobody knows me around here remember I said I had the Holy Ghost and I did I know when I received it because I can point back to that time I said I'm gonna order one I ordered that drink he set that drink down I looked at the drink I looked at my wife I looked at the drink I looked back over at her and I said I cannot believe the conviction that I'm feeling right now did that mean that I couldn't pick that drink up and drink it absolutely not but there was something inside of me saying don't do it my son don't do it now you might run straight through that and do it anyways but there's something inside there it's not up here it's not a thing saying mom and dad said don't do this or the preacher said don't do this or brother Branham said don't do this there's something in here saying son don't do this that is what the Holy Ghost is read you another quote 1960 hear ye him I want to sir I want to see the Church of God in deep sincerity I want to see the old-fashioned prayer meetings I want to see them times when they can't leave church they just stay all night and pray and fast and call out to God until God answers instead of that it seems like love has dwindled away from us the love of God just love why a real Christian can hardly wait when the bell rings he's at the front seat and they're ready with a song book in his hand but now we say oh my I don't know oh blessed be the tithe that binds our hearts in Christian love The Fellowship of Kindred Minds is like to that above when we Ascender apart it gives us inward pain but we shall still be joined in heart and hope to meet again that's the way real Christianity is a living experience Pentecost is not a denomination Pentecost is an experience that everybody can have if they wish to have it it's something you experience the Holy Spirit you want to know what the Holy Ghost is that's a real good place to start do you have a desire to go to church do you have a desire to fellowship with other believers and not my worldly friends so after you receive the Holy Ghost your plan might change because another good marker for the Holy Ghost you will develop a burden for your brothers and sisters it will come so I've received the Holy Ghost my plan changes a little bit and I'm gonna start exercising this plan but now you've really caught the eye of somebody Satan it's a famous heavyweight fighter by the name of Mike Tyson sure most of you know who that is my opinion one of not the but one of the greatest heavyweight champions of all time tremendous hands be tremendous power in his punches most of the fighters he fought were beat before they ever got in the ring because they were scared to death of him that's something to think about right there Mike Tyson was had was was had an opponent they asked his opponent how are you going to beat him what are you going to do the man said I've got a plan I know how I'm going to beat this man they go to Mike Tyson they say what do you think about this this man says he's got a plan Mike Tyson says Everybody's Got A Plan until they get hit you get the Holy Ghost he starts coming you're gonna get hit but stick to the plan keep moving forward hit another marker all sudden I realized man brother Jack I'm a Child of God this is big there's people that go a long time that they do this this Revelation does not hit them this is a revelation that'll make you want to swing from the rafters when you realize I am a child of God that is huge but again this is when Satan is really going to start coming who's the biggest man in this room I see somebody pointing brother Troy over here brother Smiley brother smiley where's brother Smiley at where is it oh he I don't think he's pointing at somebody else where give me a big guy some a big guy come up here there we go there we go hey get you stand right here so you start hitting these markers Satan starts seeing seeing this he starts seeing this movement he's coming now me standing here next to this my big brother here you know you would when you think about this which one would be Satan which one would be the child of God his brother Brown talks about this in a story as man had a dream every time he said boo the devil just kept getting smaller so we're gonna go with I'm Satan this is the child of God but as we're starting our journey okay you have your hands behind your back our hands are tied our feet are tied we're blinded this is our we don't know anything yet we are just starting our journey Satan comes to attack I mean this is easy I mean as big as this man is right here if he has a blindfold on his hands are tied and his feet are tied I like my odds okay I like my odds but you start that Journey you start taking a few steps John 16 13 how be it when the he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whosoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come so he starts reading some scripture he starts reading some Bible he starts moving a little bit and all of a sudden the blindfold comes off now you can see okay me being Satan I'm still as big as this man is his hands are still tied his feet are still tied I still like my odds against this guy he keeps going though John 8 32 and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free James 4 7 submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you so he starts getting more and more into the word all of a sudden his hands pop open his feet pop open all of a sudden he gets a sword in one hand anybody got a message book he gets a message book in the other one now he's got a sword and a shield now I'm Satan looking at this I don't like mods so much anymore I'm thinking I might be able to attack this man but he's got a sword shield he sees what's coming I may attack I might slow him down a little bit but he's gonna win this battle [Applause] amen [Applause] so now he's he's got this sword he's got this Shield he's got him up he's ready to fight here we go there we go he's ready to fight but when he gets comfortable he's got that sword he's got that Shield he's ready to fight but he gets comfortable and he starts relaxing a little bit he starts dropping it down a little bit letting that guard down thank you brother [Applause] so my brother starts to relax a little bit the guard starts to drop and Satan comes and he doesn't flee because that guard is down then what happens what happens like when he came to Jesus he said you're hungry there's rocks right here turn them into bread eat I know you're hungry but Christ said it is also written but what happens when you don't say it is also written what happens in those moments when you look at those rocks and you say I have the power to turn those into bread and I'm hungry and I turn them into bread and then I eat them what happens when your opponent in a fight knocks you to the ground they don't typically just turn around or walk away that's when they come that's when they're going to jump on you and they're really going to start beating on you so what do you do in that time because you're down because it was your fault that you're down you dropped the guard brother Branham said in 65 Christ is revealed in his own word I said remember Satan's got a Punch coming at you I don't care who you are he's got a right to that one punch he drops on down into that paragraph he's got a right to that open place now that's the spot you got to keep covered all the time but what happens when he hits you because you dropped your guard there's a man named Joshua that was going through a battle he was going through a trial he didn't know what to do so he dropped to his face and started to cry out Joshua 7 10 and the Lord said unto Joshua get thee up wherefore Elias thou up on thy face get thee up You Know Who You Are get up don't just lay there and let him beat you up I don't care what the reason is that you're down I don't care if it's because I Brothers I turned on the computer and I looked at something I shouldn't have looked at don't let him keep you there get up sisters I went to the store and I bought a skirt I knew it was inappropriate and I bought it anyways and then I wore it don't let him keep you there get back to your feet dust yourself off and keep moving forward [Applause] she had another marker you hit adoption the placement into the body of Christ it's another big moment now you're on fire man you are wanting to help people your plan changes again and of course that saying from Mike Tyson rears its ugly head again because he's going to keep coming just remember stick to the plan keep climbing even if it's just one little step at a time if you can go three or four steps at a time wonderful but if it's one step keep moving forward remember there's going to be other Climbers on this climb with you there's going to be ones that are moving slower if you can stop and encourage them do so this is what we should be doing for each other is encouraging each other if you can get down on your knees and reach down and help somebody up but never back up for somebody they will drag you down keep moving forward there's going to be ones that are moving faster I was just talking to brother Jack about this in my walk the ones that are moving fast I've wore brother Trevor Eamon out asking that man questions because I need help I've text Brother Jack brother Jack what do you think about this use those people that are in front of you don't be afraid of them use them the same will tell Satan's going to try to tell you no don't don't bother them they're they're too they're too holy for you no if they've got the Holy Ghost they're going to want to help you use that watch out for those ones that are falling as they're coming down they're trying to grab everybody that they can to take with them when you Google William Branham the voice of God or the Brenham Tabernacle that's not what's going to pop up it's going to be something on there about how you should you know leave the message and why you should leave the message because somebody has fallen and now they're trying to grab as many as they can to take with them watch out for them be careful those ones that might be a little bit ahead of you they get that self-righteous spirit I don't know that there is any a group of people that are more judgmental than right here in our message some reason we get a little bit of 15 Steps up and also we want to start judging everybody that's on that first step we all started on that first step remember that we all started in the same place that person needs help not judged yo I'm five years now a little over five years into my walk with the Lord if brother if if brother Jack would have me come preach on day one you guys would have thought he was crazy you probably would have voted him out as pastor and you should have but now five you know five and a half years in here I stand in in in and we've got a relationship you you've known me you've seen a little bit of my testimony when you look at somebody they might be on step one remember that above all be a blessing being be encouraging to others keep climbing keep moving forward I do believe that the end is closer than we think and I know there's some sitting here that are going I've heard that my whole life that the end is my dad heard that his whole life there were people in 77 that quit their jobs and everything because it was the end but yet here we are so I know there's some people that think I've got plenty of time but let me tell you there's Ripple effects to your life when you stop concentrating on where am I at my climb should I be moving forward staying where I'm at there's Ripple effects to the people around you you start living a lifestyle because I've got time to get right you start living a lifestyle maybe you're right maybe you do have time but what about this person over here that in the perfect will of the Lord you were supposed to witness to and now you're not living right and now this puts them off on some other thing now I'm not saying they won't make if they've got to see they're going to be there but did something you do just mess up them what about our kids they see a lifestyle that you are living those ripples just keep going if you don't stop it fast enough they're gonna marry someone what if they marry an unbeliever now you have grandchildren with one believer and one unbelieved parent what does that look like the ripples so I don't want to hear about I have time our walk impacts people around us and then of course brother Jonathan this climb is so hard Tell Me Something I Don't Know and I wished I could tell you that it gets easier but I can tell you just like on that trail that we were on in Gatlinburg the higher we climbed the harder it got Satan's gonna attack and he's going to keep coming and the higher you get the more he's gonna fight but the views get better and better the higher you get the more Revelation you receive the more you start saying I'm gonna lean into him because there's nothing I can do about it I ain't got no money in the bank I'm working there ain't nothing I can do about it Lord I need you Lord I'm sick I can't go to work I can't provide for my family there's there's nothing I can do about it Lord I need you the more you lean into him the more comfort you will get and my clothes was saying I'm sure there's some sitting here saying you don't know my past you don't know where I'm from you don't know the things that I've done and you're right most of you sitting here I don't know anything about you he does you're not sitting here by a coincidence don't ever let Satan tell you that you are here for a reason this reason was ordained before the foundation of the world if he's got you Satan has got you tied up and beat up and beat down with depression he said get thee up if you've got an addiction problem get the uh whatever the problem may be marital problems trying to get to closer to the Lord whatever those those times that come where you feel like he's not there he is there these trials that we go through I look back at them and I think Lord thank you thank you for each and every trial that you've given

again we love you with all we have Lord in Jesus name I pray amen [Music] [Applause] thank you [Music] praise the Lord um I just know that we all were fed here today man we appreciate brother Jonathan and uh I remember brother Smiley told me years ago when we started out in Ministry he says God will always use ministers to come in and vindicate the things that are being told everyone brother Jonathan went into Ephesians 5 and like oh Lord that's they number God it's a difference in dictatorship and headship and uh you know he spoke to both Generations the ones that were above and the ones that were beneath and we all could take something from amen what we heard here today and one of the things that kind of came back to my mind the brother Gonzalez had come on Wednesday night and uh in his sermon he began to preach about the the Chinese bamboo tree and he said this Chinese bamboo tree when you plant it um you have to order it every day and when you're walking out and you're watering this tree to the public eye you look absolutely insane because you're ordering something that is not showing any amen growth at all it doesn't show anything but you have to Faithfully go to this spot where you where you know that you planted it and when you show up there you take water and pour it in there again the next day and you keep going every day because you know what you planted they didn't go through all the digging and all the stuff that you did so you know what you put in the ground and I went to do some research and I found out that it actually takes five years before anything begins to show but in the five years you had to be faithful to watering it Hallelujah and as brother Jonathan said you know when I would have come here five years ago and you know and brother Jack having preached you know y'all probably voted brother Jack out but five years later said when that tree finally grew in five years they said it grew I think 90 feet in about five weeks but somebody had to be faithful to the process we can't give up on nobody when they've been planted come on somebody we know what's in there we know what God has done I I tell you what this weekend I heard from God both sermons I heard from Wednesday night Friday night Sunday morning I heard from God [Music] you know I I I I I'm I'm just I was blessed that's all I could say I was absolutely blessed I know this was this was from the Lord this this this was a word from the Lord amen it was just what spirit and Truth needed amen amen amen I thank God for just the differences in the gifts that God uses and and just how they come it produces growth I just I just feel like we're gonna see a difference in some people's lives after they heard the sermon today I just believe that I believe that some things you know you know even as Pastor something some angles you might miss right so God bring another minister in with a different angle and he just hit them like hey glory to God brother there ain't nothing but the truth right there but this morning and I know not just this morning but the whole weekend I heard from God um when you're on the journey you actually have to make a decision you got to put a plan together and your plan you have to decide how many times I'ma go to church what's in your plan y'all didn't hear that did you I heard it in your plan you have to decide you actually have to

spoke today thank you for brother Jonathan you're serving get themselves out of the way to speak what he spoke today only you could direct him down this path and only you could use him father to say the things that needed to be said as the prophet said when we go to church we leave Amen in one of two conditions either better or worse and I Proclaim that we are all leaving here better God if we need to readjust our plan we've excluded you in some places but we need to readjust our plan to include you in all that we do I pray that you would help us to hear the still small voice of our savior speaking to our hearts and that we Jesus would begin to make the adjustments if it's in my family life let us make the adjustments if it's in our personal life the friends that we are associating ourselves with let us make the adjustments God if it's in our attendance to church let us make the adjustments whatever the need is may we begin to make the adjustments it's not a word that just came and went in one ear and out the other but Lord this was a living word this was a fresh word this was a Heavenly word something that we all could draw from I pray God that you would help us bless your servant Lord we pray that you would use them amen once again tonight as it goes there to brother jeans I pray God that you would bless the service and God use them for your glory for your honor pray you watch over the Saints Lord that will be traveling next week going there to uh Indiana ready to meet us in a very special way there and God those that are not able to to make it service will still be going on right here and I pray that you would use the ministry that would come to preach the word of God father we just acts you would bless our going out as you've blessed our coming in it's in
