just prepare amen to receive brother Troy on tonight last week he started on this subject a man of influences from a another dimension as I just listened to his his teachings I just really felt in my heart saying I knew that he didn't finish the reason that he didn't finish is because he was very cognizant of you know just the time and things of that nature you know and I'm so appreciative of just how he was conducting the service while while we were absent but I wanted him to come back around tonight because I knew there was more there was more than the Lord wanted us to hear and and I want him just to you know I'm still you know don't worry won't be here for three or four hours but but I want the Lord just to kind of share more with us and I pray tonight then you always just enter in that you receive a man what God is trying to say you know that as he was he's gonna pull the chart up again but as he was just showing how we were coming down from that heavenly dimension we come from God that Bible said we come from God and we're going back to God but if we're coming down that heavily dementia we end up you know within that fourth dimension the first four dimensions we live within that but the fifth dimension if you notice is on the bottom and brother Branham you know laid it out that way he called it the underworld so when you look at the chart there and and there are a number of things that happened in that fifth dimension and all Satanists trying to do is pull us further down everything that he uses is in order to pull us further down but what God is trying to do is actually pull us up right so so I trust that tonight as you're just kind of looking and you're listening and what the Spirit is saying to you let God you know just have his way in your heart in your life I believe he wants to speak to us so I mean as we just welcome brother Troy amen tonight let's sing a few course of this song amen I want to say I have decided to follow Jesus but Christ is

and Jesus precious name I pray hey man it man oh my you love the Lord and man we're gonna read from Ephesians again Ephesians the sixth chapter amen starting at the fourteenth verse a man say man when you got it I see like one brother say but here - Russell it'll leave a man over to God a man and the reeds on this rise his stand I'm sorry we're gonna start from the eleven the eleventh verse of Ephesians chapter six put on the whole armour of God that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and against powers and against the rulers of darkness in this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take on take unto you the whole armour of God that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your lawns gird about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace Bauval take the shield of faith wherewith ye be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation in this water the spirit which is the word of God praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints and for me the utterance may be given unto me that I may open my mouth boldly to make known the mysteries of the gospel a man made all that the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his words you may be seated amen and just a quick recap if you put the Charter system hey man it would just briefly just kind of reach out what we were born over let me see her getting a pointer I got it brother huh Oh mom I gotta turn it on first I'm not very good I think okay alright alright a man so what we see here I'm a man we have this this chart a man that's just a real blessing and help us to be able to visualize what the Prophet was talking about and in looking at this we see you know that it's just so much here hey man you know the prophet of God was talking about that one day he said he went to an observatory and and and during that trip he said the Lord gave him a revelation because he began to understand that lights travel at so many thousands of miles per second and then he said if an angel started from the farthest star and coming here it would take him billions times billions a man of years to get here it started from if he started from Mars and come here flying at the speed of light and he said he began to just kind of meditate on that and and and and he said he said I can't believe that that there is a house way out yonder he said entry to see when the law said I go to prepare a place for you that where I am you may be also you may be also he was talking about a house he wasn't talking about a literal house he was talking about a body a man we live here thank you brother we here now understand that we are in this fleshly body amen but this body that we are in context this the region here of mortal beings now I want you to keep in mind notice here here now the the fourth dimension sort of just runs being the entire way here okay now the Prophet he was able to to to tap in I would say the Prophet but science education and those things are dwell here in this fourth dimension you see here radio television and the information super highway mine the information super highway okay the Prophet said that man amen took independent in the beginning of the Eden bit off from the nut tree of knowledge and good and evil and took off coal automobiles gunpowder things that cause death all in the name of education and progress amen realizing that I want to read this this quote here amen y'all pray for me that I can just get myself out of the way in God just have his way because I tell you what this is just so beautiful you can keep that up sister please keep that up just keep that up but we gonna be referring back back and forth to that throughout the night he says in the Garden of Eden there were two trees one of them was the knowledge was knowledge and the other was the Tree of Life and when man left the Tree of Life and took his first bite after tree of knowledge he separated himself from God and now he bit off this is her Gunpowder that destroys himself he bit off electricity pulling the coal from the earth and he says where underneath it is 8,000 miles of burning you know why do you think that it's going to cause we have the problems that we are having say over and California the fires and different things it's because man is tampering with the earth we have a situation now call they call global warming what is it man has has reached up and pulled off that tree of knowledge and good and evil and they have done things to destroy the very earth that we live on hey man that's going to cause the very destruction that that that we go through the Hurricanes are getting worse we see earthquakes all over the place ma'am and we have a testimonial or a prophecy from the Prophet that there will be a great earthquake what is it is all planted to the end of all things so planted to the coming of the Lord and then put you see man in his own wisdom it's trying to try to achieve things on his own where we will put in it for one reason to depend on our Heavenly Father we were here put here to do what they depend on him he said sir dear friends don't you know that worldly wisdom is the thing that destroys this world in the Garden of Eden there were two trees man eat from it from the tree and and and they live forever the other was the tree of knowledge now we look here this science and audience but I can only expect like that roots from that tree must have been over in this dimension we talk about trees but we're not talking about literal trees because the other ones the tree of life and man live forever I can only that had to be the the tree of life let me tell you something my brothers and sisters one of the things that the devil wanted to do is is is the title here that we're being influenced from another dimension we see can you can you take it up some system down here into this other dimension here the region of The Lofts we have here where all of the souls that that die without knowing Christ go to now we got some quotes on that it's a terrible place you don't want to go there he who came down to Calvary he came down from the top of Michener came all the way down dwelled in this dimension right here for a while with the Calvary he bore our sins in this dimension and then gave up the ghost to go down and sadistically in this dimension and Lanigan he what he did here he preached the bells oh that those those are patriots that that was hidden called paradise to deliver them from from because they had nowhere else to go but here because he he hadn't that the price hadn't been paid yet then he went down into this room amen in it and he went down into here and he took the keys from Satan and he came back up and he revealed themselves to the disciples and let them know that I'm going on that but I will leave you a comfortable but that comforter comes down he comes down here and what dwell in mortal bodies but that is here is where we are trying to get to where we tap into the blesses of God the region of the Blessed we're constantly being pulled up and motivated and full every time we go to church every time we word every time we read our Bible every time we pray we are being influenced from this dimension we used to sing a song haven't heard it in quite a while but it's not fear to pull a hair to call you are being pulled from one direction or another costly there's also a constant pull from this division a cosmic pool the perfect sail he said he would pray me said now be real Reverend no moving around no moving around be real revving and I just want to say my brothers and sisters even in our services when demons are being cast out the minister is praying for someone be real veteran because he said when when he spirits are cast out they immediately leave looking for somewhere else to live make no mistake about it this is not a game this is this is as real as it gets as real as it gets that when he says that that that spirit has nowhere to go and he is seeking for another home so he says be real Reverend not moving around no you get your kids under control no laughing giggling and playing and this that in the other they'll and cook you and you also can breed the Holy Spirit now your prophecy I want to go back to the testimony and I don't have that that that one give with him but I just want to talk about it he said that he was took his wife to JCPenney and he was sitting there while his wife was shopping and at that time I think he said he was around 55 years old and he said 40 years ago he had a vision hey man 40 years ago he had a vision and in that vision he she went to here he went here the Lord allowed him to see this place and he said that was the most hideous place though first thing he said he said it was full of beautiful women beautiful women he said they had them water head high haircuts they had that green eyeliner makeup on my eyes and windows blasted that made them look like cat eyes I see back then they had the glasses but my wife was just showing me on Instagram or one of them social media things as to the other day that there was some kind of transformation they can show how these young ladies are transforming themselves through the hair in the tracks and all of this kind of stuff you wouldn't even know if it's the same person the ability to transform themselves with the hair extensions and then the makeup and then it isn't in the eyelashes and then I've noticed that the way the women are doing the curling it often look like eyes where do you think that come from they're being influenced from another dimension why do you think that they're being influenced by because say they're just doing it for nothing he is trying to attract some Son of God my god he is trying to attract he is working hard over time because he know that this is Thomas coming to it in a man my brothers and sisters we in a time now word that you should come to church when you don't feel like coming to church pray when you don't feel like praying because that's when the devil ain't fighting you for nothing the tops you when you get in your body listen well I just I just don't fit well I got their head that's what the times when you need to press even harder my brothers and sisters we in a real battle we in a real war it's not something that we just talked about we're in a real battle that is a constant constant pull from this dimension that seeping over into this dimension through electronics and mechanically and it imagine the people that don't have the Holy Ghost and you have to wrap shoulders go to work run into him at the store you have to be able the prophets in in this room he said as the he said that does gaiety now look that word of us again t he said it is an unpleasant game spirit it is actually gay of akhmad people that's just living for the moment like that it isn't even a God living for the moment doing whatever they feel inspired to do no resistance whatsoever and these people we have to deal with on a daily basis he said every now and then he said I see a streak of light he said what is that that's the Saints those that are being inspired from this heavenly dimension but he said it's in this darkness in this darkness of lady or seal every now and then there's a streak of life every now and he he said one way they care meat from spoiling places where they don't have air condition and they don't have the means they hang the meat they have to take salt and they care to me he said we are keeping this earth from spoiling we have a salt that's keeping it from spoiling rotten it's already rotten to the core but we are the salt of the earth that's just keep holding it together when we are gold and take it away from here just into that other dimension this thing is going to fall apart I'm a recent things to you amen lord help me hey man I'm sorry I wanna get this anyway bear with me a man he says here in the message it's questioning answers number two if you want to do this 54 0-1-0-3 e paragraph 45 54 zero one zero three paragraph 45 Oh God go over to go there's now friend if you are a sinner and you ask this God be merciful to you yes sir you're not only under condemnation now not here no you'll prosper and go on and that's all through the mercies of God that's all through the mercies of God that you prosper and do what you do that's true but one of these days if you're a sinner and your soul slips out it'll go younger into judgment and will be condemned and then you'll be cast away and you'll be in torment until the day that you are brought back to this earth and you will receive an immortal body an immortal body that cannot die and will be cast away into outer darkness whether they'll be weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth you'll be cast into hell now what happens to meat when it rots worms he said well the worm never dies or fire is never quenched and you'll be tormented through all ages there is truth and there is to come jesus said that that's a black picture but it's what the Bible said if God so condemns sin that sin and he had he had it cost such a price that that it will be if those unjust spirits could ever be made loose again we'd have another thing like we have had the last six thousand years a man so into that out of darkness brothers and sisters we don't we don't we don't want if we don't want to go there we don't we don't want to go there by all means everything we have till I say he don't care how much you say that you from what you were being influenced by here he says that is where your representation up is he said you have a celestial body and this this area is his other thing in this air going to pass away he said heaven and earth will never pass away my word another pass away this area is more real than this area but you can't see it he gay he was talking about it he described it by the fish he said if you go down into the deepest deepest fathom of the sea down to where there's no light now here we have light so our eyes reflect light and we can see but down arrows fish those things that have no light so they have no eyes there's no need for eyes so they sort of go around with other senses but by him having eyes if he could lead that fish to food and to whatever they need because he can see how much greater if we're here in God with all of his Olympics and wisdom and the sight that he has been here is that is all we can do is surrender to Him and allow ourselves to be led by him his sight and revelation and understanding is far greater than ours because he let a greater lie and he's we're just like that he said multiply that example billions times billions he said if that fish ever came up to live to the surface have never got that light he'll never want to go back down to that darkness imagine how he sees us because he's so much higher he is that light and how his vision and how he see things here we think all we content just did it like matter in time here it is here from this earth these five senses only contact this area but in order for us to contact this area here it takes faith faith amen I want to show you something here a man if you will turn the light on brother but this is so I can see this thank you amen I want to read this article to you we're talking about being influenced from another dimension hey man this is an article called the undoing of families and I'd like to appreciate brother Matthew Barnes for this is it Matthew Barnes Matthew Watkins sorry Watkins a man of for this article a man it says here Naima cotta because it's a very lengthy reading but I think you'll find it very treating here there was a fifteen-year-old young girl who her parents noticed that her grades and things were dropping and she was having some problems so they decided to give us some limits on her cell phone okay they said something happened to got into a little shoving match and the girl ended up hitting her mom all because they took her phone says Kelly explained that uh he said that the police arrived that even and Kelly was so distraught he told the officer that she wanted to kill herself so an ambulance was called and the fifteen year old girl was strapped to a gurney taken to a psychiatric hospital and monitored for safety before being released days after days after being hospitalized Kelly was brought to my office with this is the psychologist by her parents who wanted great help for their trouble girl Kelly's parents spoke first and they said that their daughter's hospitalization was a a culmination of a year-long downward spiral spiral spurred by her phone obsession Kelly had been refusing to spend time with her family and focus on school instead she favored living her life through living her life on social media they previously had girl and a strong student Kelly had grown angry sullen and was now being in there and was now bringing home report cards with sinking grades Kelly's parents had tried many times and prior much to set limits on their daughter's phone use but she had become increasingly defiant and deceitful even sneaking on the phone at all hours of the night now who haven't had that problem you know I just want to start right there and I just want you to pay attention to what's going on here this is happening all over the world information superhighway see back in the day in the early times it was just radio then it became television and now information superhighway which does what goes down into this dimension and if you notice the gates from the bottomless pit and they come up and then they come into this this this dimension to influence you to influence mankind and I see they can't get up here but they here why because they can they have access to this flesh this flesh has to die now the the psychologist asked Kelly who was sitting in the core city in the corner Jason is to help me understand her perspective on that evening she didn't respond instead glared at her parents meanly but then surprising everyone in the room she cried she cried they took my phone attempting to engage Kelly in conversation I asked her that she liked of what was it that she liked about her phone and social media she said they made me happy intriguingly I'm sorry what none of these parents understand is that their children and teens destructive obsession with technology is a predictable consequence of a virtual unrecognized merger between the tech industry and psychology the alliance pairs the consumer tech industry immense wealth with the most sophisticated psychological research making it possible to develop social media video games phones with a drug like power to seduce young users I'm talking real stuff we're not just talking about now we have we have crossed from a spiritual deception into natural deceit see nestled in the unremarkable building on the stanford university campus in alto california is the stanford is the stanford persuasive technology lab notice the name persuasive technology founded in 1998 the labs created dr. BJ fall is a psychologist a psychologist and a neuroscience and a social science expert who used their knowledge of psychological vulnerabilities to device products that captures kids attention for the sake of Industry profit that these that these parents and most of the world has yet to grasp is this graph that psychology a discipline that we associate with healing is now being used as a weapon against children hey man I think I went back to something else okay let's see here persuasive technology a discipline in which digital machines and apps including smartphones social media video games are configured to alter human thoughts and behaviors as the labs website boldly proclaims machines designed to change humans fog speaks openly about the ability of to the use of smartphones and other digital media devices to change our ideas and actions we can now create machines that can change what people think and what people do and the machines can do it all so autonomously called the millionaire maker Fogg has groomed former students who have used his method to develop technologies that now consume kids lies as he recently taught in his on his personal website my students often do often through groundbreaking projects and they continue to have impact in the world after they leave Stanford for example Instagram has an influence the behavior of eight hundred million people and the co-founder was a student of mine while Fogg emphasizes persuasive design Sunday future is quite indifferent to the disturbing reality now the hidden influence techniques are being used by the tech industry to hook and exploit users for profit his enthusiastic vision also conveniently neglects to include how this generation of children and teens with their highly malleable minds are being manipulated and hurt by forces unseen if you haven't heard of persuasive technology that's no accident tech corporations would prefer that they remain in the shadows and most of us don't want to be don't want to be controlled or have special aversion to key is being manipulated for profit for profit persuasive technology also called called persuasive design works by deliberately creating digital environments that users feel fulfilled their basic human drives to be social or obtained goals better than real-world alternatives kids spend countless of hours in social media and video games environments in pursuit of likes and friends and gain points and levels because it's stimulating they believe that this makes them happy and successful and they find it easier than doing the difficult but developmentally important activities of childhood while persuasive techniques work well on adults they are particularly effective in influence to steel but showing mind of a teen brain video games better than anything else in our culture deliver rewards to people especially teenage boys teenage boys are wired to seek competency to master our world and get better at stuff video games and dishing out reward which can convey to people that their competency is grown you can get better at something second-by-second and it's persuasive design that helps convince this generation of boys that they're gaining competences and spending countless hours on game sites and the sad reality is that they're locked away in their room gaining ignoring school and developing the real world kind of competencies that colleges and employers demand a man so we seed my brothers and sisters there's further on in here it reads that lets me see this drug like powers so if we think about that and we see that there's people addicted to certain things a person that is a alcoholic what is an alcoholic a person that is possessed by a demon they need deliverance many times the Prophet pray for alcoholics he had to call the devil I a person that have a they would call it these days a addiction to some drug with methamphetamine or marijuana they have opened themselves up and they are possessed by a demon to the point to where they can't shake it they can't stop that demon has taken control what do you think drilled light tendencies is a demon coming up from this room taking a ride on the fourth dimension and influencing influencing mortal beings a man now disclaimer he said that they here and they took automobile van took from this tree of knowledge and good and evil and say automobiles they killed himself am i saying don't drive automobile no it's not what I'm saying so am i saying getting rid of your cell phones and things no what am I saying put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand a wise of these are the wiles of the devil take the shield of faith that you may be able to quench the fire it does a man my brothers and sisters we are he said which we can hear we like a palm tree which ever waved the tree lean and at that time when your time here on earth is up that's which way it's going to follow there's a constant pool there's a constant pool I want to read something here he says here now I'm just believing that you're going to pour out a blessing I'm in the expectation here and I don't have the paragraph number sister I'm gonna just hold it he says Lord I believe that you're going to pour out an expert expecting that things are moving right in and I'm expecting to see the exceeding abundantly now I'm expecting it and when you go you come down and say well let me let me let me read that again because I don't want to I don't want you to miss it Lord I'm just believing that you're going to pour out a blessing I'm expecting it now all things are moving right in and I'm expecting to see the exceeding and abundantly now I'm expecting them and when you go you come down and say well I don't know about that he says see you hurt the other person now you're setting by one of them and you say Oh Lord just tear him down I just turned the person down I'm just expecting great things see and that expectancy would get the unity among the people that's what happened on the day of Pentecost what brought the Holy Ghost in the first place they went up there and stayed ten days and ten nights and they were in they were until they were in one place and in one Accord blessing God from something that they did not have blessing God for something that they did not have now let me slow down and i'ma walk you through this man that's what happened on that day of Pentecost what brought the holy ghost in the first place they went up and stayed for ten days and ten nights not when they went up to the upper room they stayed for ten days and ten nights and I said until they were in one place what may already in one place when they went up to the upper room so what place was he talking about can you put the chart back over this place this place they had to get into the channel several times and I don't have all of the quotes right here with me but the Prophet is praying for people he said if you can just get into that dimension and accept your healing this is where it takes place this is where your faith thing this is where that $0.06 a so when you come here to worship you can God is a spirit you can't don't worship Him truly unless you worship Him in spirit you have to leave this and get into that channel to where you can be blessed by God why so many times we come to church and the devil fights our mind I mentioned this last week there's all kind of thoughts and think he's trying to keep you grounded here if you can ever let go and just let yourself get into this channel all in one place in one of court my god there's nothing that a stand cancel be healed every child of children be safe people will be filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost [Music] why because we're all in one place and God come down and fellowship his desire when he was fellowshipping in the Garden of Eden he came down any fellowship with Adam and Eve this is where he met them and in this place in the cool of the evening now here after everything had happened and then time started after the fall Adam walked out he had done don't run he slipped down Adam where you at he's lost fellowship lost fellowship cuz they didn't know how to get back up here but we know how to get my Amen so that we can have fellowship with our God again so that's why it's so important my brothers and sisters he said that we come people come we have expectancy have this expectation and you come and and all of a sudden doubt or suddenly you'll hardly say you pull the next person down that's why they all had to be in one place and in one Accord then the Holy Spirit can move freely there's no restrictions he can have his way Amen my brothers and sisters amen I tell you what there is there's just so much there's just so much so much to this Amen I'm gonna close the musicians come let us let us have a word of Prayer a man I hope it was a blessing to you a man like I was saying I didn't want to just just continue to just do all of that reading and reading but the undoing of the family amen it is about this design men mankind in their worldly wisdom reached off of that tree and they're continuing to pull off now they pulled off this social media the worldwide will now we carry our computers with us in our pocket being influenced 24/7 Oh got a message in church you know somebody like my posts sit here in I don't seen in church my brothers and sisters and then the man of God is preaching a couple of hi feed on this word if you can just get into that channel if you can just let go of this world if you can just let this flesh die it has to die the more it dies the more it is fleshed out or more you rise up because this what's keeping your grounded this is this is your great you you are your greatest enemy your flesh this pest house I got quotes on it maybe once we can get out of this pass house this flashback we move up into this into this realm brother branham say let me read this last hole I see I went all over the place that my notes is kind of all that so I'm gonna find it I got it he said he lives in that dimension I wonder if I brought it I may not have brought it or I may not have highlighted it a man but anyway the prophets say your doctor you go to your doctor and your doctor knows about your body he knows about your Anatomy he says but he says but I prophets speaking he says see I live in a whole nother dimension I see things doctor can't see he says it ain't even no sense in me trying to explain it to you he says I live in that dimension if our prophet can live in that dimension can we angry another place he said what happened why we can't sometime into that dimension amen Thank You sister that is and that he say our heart is not in tune he said that Christ come down through those dimensions through the region of angels and into the region of a bless he say sometimes you can't say your heart has to be in tune your heart has to be tuned in tuned with his so it's not just a pressing law but God is love it is the purest form the purest form of love that there is everything else is a perversion or a lesser form he says nothing to enter that but perfect love and it's going to take that perfect love that's how you tune in that's the man makes there's a tuner that will tune in and pick up television and radio waves but how do we tune in and pick up it's the heart in tune with his heart it's how you get on his level perfect love love for one another love for him sine cry for the people fulfill for mankind who are lost and knowing what they're gonna go through having that perfect love because that's what he has that's what he has he doesn't desire to see those things happen that he came and he bought us he bought a sin upon himself and paid the price that man might be saved and we have to have that same love and concern as we take on the mind of Christ as we get closer as we move into that dimension we we have that love we have that concern we pray one for another if you don't notice that he said if you don't feel like coming to church come to church just to pray your brother through well I don't feel or I'm I got somebody else gonna come to I need to be there to pull on the Lord pull over the word for them in one place and in one Accord love for one another that's what that's that's how you know that your Christ's disciples amen amen let us pray most gracious Heavenly Father Lord God how Lord we just thank you Lord God for this Lord this little study your father God that you've given us Lord Lord God may we take these things Lord God and just apply them Oh father God through our lives realizing Lord God that is such a deception in this age as such a deceptive deception and in this power Lord we just thank you Lord God for revealing to us the Satan's tactics and the tricks of the enemy the devices Oh Lord that we can stand against the wiles of that wicked one Oh father and we recognize his his schemes and his tricks Lord God Lord God help us to just law surrender ourselves Lord God as the prophesied Lord all we have to do is surrender and depend on you Lord God that's what me and made a mistake they depend they began to depend on themselves and left you out of the picture but Lord we going back Lord God to a people Oh father God that will totally and wholeheartedly depend on you O Father God our great creator Lord the provider of everything Oh Lord God we just trust you and depend on your Lord God feed also father God Lord God continue to draw oh so father God from this realm of father God into a heavenly places Oh Lord God that we be able to fellowship with you Lord God and see you even more Lord God anon our eyes with eyesalve Lord God that we may see Lord Lord God would bless us Lord God and we just thank you Lord God for all things in Jesus name I pray amen [Music] appreciate the Lord for brother Troy tonight let's give the Lord a hand the breeze I you know I just just really I think there's a there's a lot in that subject and I know it's something that all of us could identify with it's just just knowing how statements uselessness as if I could draw things reading that article and how the young lady is so attached to her phone it's like a drug and if we were honest with ourselves probably have to be honest with mom so I got a little game that I love to play on my on my phone and man I'm a is an addiction right it's an addiction I remember being in Seattle going out for a we're going for our cruise and we had to get some paperwork and everything together we left our passports here and so we went run around rushing around Seattle trying to get things done before we get on the boat and I ended up in a FedEx place or something like that so I'm sitting there you know trying to get everything together and did this young lady I see she's playing the game that I like to play so I say well you you you you any good at death yeah I'm pretty good I'm pretty good okay you're pretty good with less my name is dis and your name is death and I want to test obviously how good she was and you start doing that with all people all over the world and there's an addiction that begins to develop right and you're just trying to beat anybody all over the world and you know now he's just kind of going through that I've realized a member a demon spirit reaching up from another dimension trying to pull me into something that I probably shouldn't be into and if that's uh if that would happen to me I wonder about the whole church and and some of the other areas that Satan is using to come against us right and you know so we don't have a quote on the Internet we look there's no quote that brother Branham didn't say anything about the Internet it wasn't here at his time but it's the same spirit right the same spirit way he was crying out against television and crying out against radio it's the same spirit that's coming now through the internet and it just reminded me of of those seven visions that the prophets had before the coming of the Lord and the fourth vision the fourth vision was the one that showed great advances in science that would come after the Second World War and you know notice it's the fourth vision science operates at the fourth dimension right and it's the great advances and you know when you just think about I think about my mom and and you know just just maybe some of the other saints that what they've seen in a lifetime I mean you know you all cut when they was coming up everyone no such thing as nobody having us having a cell phone in the pulpit that was unheard of right but I mean you you realized what a phone was this rotary dial thing you know even even a telephone numbers that the stuff that it's unbelievable what they went through and they had what we call what they call it a party line right y'all y'all call it we call it nowadays you know we want to get three or four people on the phone so we might call it a third party or whatever but but a party line back there is we are the neighborhood has shared the telephone line the whole neighborhood Sheraton right and you know so to see and this is this is as kids they can hours I was in a place left all the color televisions that were costing six seven hundred dollars a color television and it was so slow and one nothing like what we see nowadays nothing like that right but but the advances in technology of what people are seeing in their lifetime is it's just the vision that brother Branham talked about is being fulfilled and what we have to do is be extremely careful that we don't allow the enemy to pull us into some of these the rim we bet we are being influenced by another dimension Facebook it's influenced by another dimension Instagram influenced by another dimension what some another was snapchat and fluence by another dimension halo and Florence by another dimension right what was some of the other ones out there Twitter influenced by another dimension some of us we can't wait to get out this church the check some stuff here we can't wait to get out when you let when you like that you influenced by another dimension there's an addiction it's an addiction and when you talk about the lights everybody know they posts to get likes right I mean I I put a script right there and I'll be trying to see how many people gonna like the scripture that's that's that's right yeah right get get 10 12 likes but I put a picture myself I got a hundred and something like no I want you to like the words right but we keep doing this in instead it's an addiction and once you get one you know you get some good like there you got to come up with something else for the next it's an addiction it's an addiction and you know and this right here as well as television television used to be our babysitter I ain't lyin get too many mans but it was the babysitter we we we sent the kids right down in front of it because we just didn't want to hear nothing from us so he put something on for them to watch and it became the babysitter now we got a telephone we got my path we got a cell phone we got all that that we're giving the kids and that becoming a babysitter and they've been influenced by another dimension god help us here tonight don't take these things lightly Church I think God for that I pray to be something to cause us all just to do a self-evaluation and you know and and and really I used to think fasting from things like this was really come on man people used to get up big plate now you just talk about giving up your cell phone you know we probably do need to do that I mean just you need to just go on a fast I'm not getting on no no social media no nothing and don't announce the people that you pass I'm disconnected but that's fine that's funny they'll be able to figure it out when you stop liking everything right but but just just fast sometime just put yourself on a fast put yourself on a fast and just disconnect some time from this we've been influenced by another dimension thank you brother Troy we appreciate appreciate that tonight god bless you god bless you god bless you let's have the brothers come let's prepare for tonight's offering and so good to have sister Dixon with us a man on tonight and certainly appreciates it uses god bless you ale and a man named man praise the Lord brothers you all could come and that's just that word of Prayer [Music] Father we we thank you Lord for your word that has that has come to us Lord ah we should all be challenged in this place tonight from what we've heard we should all be challenged and God my prayer is that we don't let this just go in one ear and out the other but Lord let it let it let it just continue to deal with our hearts let it just this continuous speak don't let us rest God as we just even leave this place going back into some of those places that we probably shouldn't be God Lord let let conviction settle in God that we really really think about these things you don't speak these things just because you have purpose of everything that you say you had you had a reason for allowing brother Troy just to see some of these things and and Lord just inspire him to want to bring it here to the church God is because you love us and Satan is doing everything he can to try to disrupt and pull us down we want to rise up that we can really be in one mind and one Accord in one place as it was brought out so beautifully tonight they were already sitting in the upper room they weren't in one place but Oh God you had you were talking about something a little higher and Lord when we're thinking some of the things that we think it's hard to get every heart every mind and one one Accord in one place so God we we got to come to a spot Lord where we're we're pushing these things to the side the Bible say we have to lay aside every sin and every weight that's so easily besets of some of these things are not sins but they are ways and they beset us god help us Lord Jesus to fly this father's we've just prepared a gift from our hearts tonight we pray to to it use this for the furthest of your kingdom may you receive all the glory all the honor and all the praise through our giving tonight in Jesus name we ask it man praise the Lord [Music] brother fro is just kind of sharing about that gaiety and living for the moment and I know that there is a saying a lot of people have this Yolo you only live once mentality and and they've just wrapped up in games you know and that that persuasive technology many of you all can certainly identify with that you can be in your car having a conversation and you ask a question in the car just a little question your phone picks up on your question and and then will actually try to give you an answer as soon as you go to you know as soon as you go to your phone pull up google it it's already hurt what you're saying these are things that's persuasive technology at its best right and and if it can influence you in any way that's exactly what they're trying to do I remember when I was in college they were talking about this persuasive technology I say no way you're my buddy no you no do not like that you you click on something a man just to search something on in there all of a sudden all the products that's in that line start showing up on your page right and you wonder why they got up it's persuasive technology and they're trying to force you into areas that you probably never want to go into search be careful this is the devil the devil is all over the place and you can't you can't stop using it you've got a need you're gonna need all these things you know in order to get through life but just watch the death right be careful watch the devil man he's he's so tricky some tricky so slash so man Iza Devils it's all I can say he's a devil Church he'll use anything to give a son of God down so y'all y'all or daughter Gaby be careful Church be be careful let me see those announcements a man and so Sunday don't forget we'll have communion of feet washing 5:30 never happen on Sunday no service on this Friday we'll be back on Sunday morning and the Okeechobee outreach that would be doing a back-to-school giveaway that'll be happening on Saturday August 11th and the giveaway will happen at 10:00 a.m. and not only there's back-to-school giveaway but we're also we we put some fliers out there just to let the parents know that we're coming out we want to pray over their children before they go back into school amen especially in the wake of all the school shootings and things of that nature we just want to pray over the kids pray a prayer protection over them and so we're asking the parents to bring the kids for that that'll be Sunday I'm Saturday that August 11th and then also that night at 6 o'clock in Okeechobee brother Remy would be ministering so keep that in mind also keep the services in mind that brother Simmons his 10th meeting starting on tomorrow brother Fred his meeting starting on tomorrow brother Simmons in Columbia South Carolina brother Fred in Florence South Carolina so keep those services in mind and know some of the things to be going up just attend the services to keep them in prayer as well and brother joel jean he down in miami this is a brother for mills son-in-law who actually has a church down they'll be having their back-to-school youth services that's happening also on the weekend of August 10th through 12th that's the next weekend that'll be occurring so we'll try to attend to him text him and told him and I'm gonna try to make it down on that Friday night but I told him already that we did have a conflict on that Saturday so you know hopefully they'll understand and you know we did everything we could to try to avoid that but it just didn't work out and you know but we'll go I'll go and try to support him on it man the 10th that's a Friday night amen so keep those things in mind and then as we approach the upcoming days amen let's have word of Prayer before we leave tonight father we pray O God then as we just prepare to leave this place that we go meditating on the words that we've heard so much Lord that Satan uses against us that comes from another dimension and often times we don't realize where it's coming from we don't realize where it's coming from but made a holy spirit Lord just point things out and God as you as you pointed out to us as individuals let us be quick to yield to your spirit to yield to your voice the Bible say today that you hear my voice harden not your heart let us not wreaths and these things out the Lord Jesus let us applied and and God as we apply as we apply we pray that you just continue and elevate us pull us up a little higher because we certainly Lord want to draw closer to you we want you say draw nigh unto me and I would throw now to use of God we want to draw closer to you I am I'm convinced that if we all it would begin to take this on we would see a difference in our services with the difference in ourselves lot wasted difference in everything so help us Lord to apply what we've heard we trust o God that you just continue to anoint and just touch brother Troy Lord just continue to speak to him and through him we just thank you well for him getting himself out of the way and allowing you to use them even though tonight and even on last week just appreciate what you're doing in our midst God we we really we really think you prated to it keep us until we're able to meet again different Saints that'll be traveling he's got going to the meetings be with them Oh God give him traveling mercies and as we just come back on Sunday Lord Jesus pray the Holy Spirit meet us here in a very special way we pray your blessings upon brother Simmons and and his speakers brother Fred and his speakers Lord Justice ministered to the people's Minister father words of deliverance and healing and strength Lord just do a mighty mighty work there in the South Carolina area is our prayer and those so many other churches here going up god bless them give them traveling mercies Lord and God is my prayer and I pray O God that you would just get all the glory and all the honor from everything that occurs is in Jesus name that we pray amen and amen God richly bless you and the brothers will come it is time to dismiss you [Music] [Music] you
