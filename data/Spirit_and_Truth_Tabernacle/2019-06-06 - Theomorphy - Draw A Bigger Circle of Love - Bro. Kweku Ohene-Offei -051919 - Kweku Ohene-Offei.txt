bless you in your name Jesus Christ we pray praise be to God shall we be seated the Lord is awesome amen I was listening to the testimonies and the songs and everything and I said it's just the epitome of God the Lord is wonderful amen you had a very epitome manifestation of Jesus Christ the same Jesus that walk in Nazareth healing the sick for giving sickness to in love and doing things the same Jesus Christ is in you amen the little friend since he pulled out his 16 element and pick your cysteine element pick your flesh body to manifest his glory amen and it's just wonderful when I was coming out said or that someone has been preached already at how did you preach but a solemn own and I think since I Michelle and the other sisters and their songs and the one who gives testimony who give the testimony I don't know or god bless you sister Vienna right I think I had in him right what a testimony the Lord is in our miss amen was it for the I was looking at the same one and I was looking at the title Lord what what do you want for the title what do you want to speak to a so I think I know how to pray and I open my notebook to steady and a lot already given me the title the first word on a blank spaces draw let me see draw a circle of bigger laughs draw a bigger sac circle of love amen draw a circle of bigger laughs no draw a bigger circle of laughs amen and a key word that I use is few Murphy few is Christ Murphy is chin expanding the territory amen so God like businessman expand the territory people do business and less ELISA from us or China and they grow their business and they realize that oh there's a market in South America so we can open branches in less in Mexico in Argentina the open branches they look at the globe and you know we can go to Asia China has got a won more than one point something billion population and we can market this product they go to India same than one point something plus billion and they expand their business God is the greatest businessman amen he has planned his laughs and his business of salvation amen if you didn't do so you could have remain in Adam and only Adam with nobody else but because he has planned his business and himself he brought Eve he brought a Seth he brought a a beau he brought the prophet the women Hanna Elizabeth you just named a Mary Mary Magdalene it brought about a Solomon he brought brother brother Troy he brought sister Michelle he brought all of you here amen - a Spanish territory because he's a businessman amen glory hallelujah to the Lord so we want to speak on a just go ahead and without taking your time and look at something shall we read a scripture I've got a lot of scriptures but I don't think we can read all of them so we're just gonna read a couple of scriptures here praise God hallelujah now a lot is good he's the same God I live seen lives in Jesus is in you so if the Spirit of the Lord is in you whatever he did in Jesus Christ he's doing the same thing in you know that he would do he is doing it now because it's a present tense god amen so let's go to Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 and 2 god bless you sisters and brothers for the songs and the musicians god bless for the other talents Genesis chapter 1 and 2 in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the of the deep and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters thus the heavens and the earth were finished and all the host of them amen shall we move to Genesis chapter 2 oh sorry that the other one I read was instructed to sojourn in chapter 2 verse 1 Genesis 2 verse 1 and 2 does the heavens does the heavens and the earth were finished and odd and all the host of them and on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made and rested on the seventh day from all his work which had made amen so we want to find out what is the seventh day God is a spirit so how does God rest he doesn't get tired as not a flesh is not a sitting element so he was Elohim what was the rest God was the King for he was looking for a place to dwell in amen he created the solar system the universe the moon the stars but he couldn't rest in the stars he couldn't rest in the trees he wouldn't live in the ocean he couldn't live in the fish but on the seventh day when it created a man a women then he rested jump into the women amen he form a body around himself and called Adam Adam is read earth you are read earth you've got blood flowing through your body so the earth doesn't have blood water runs through it by you've got earth which is the same earth lacking from this one but you've got blood read it Adam is read earth amen so God rested on the seventh day by dwelling in a man dwelling in a human flesh amen praise God hallelujah now Genesis 1 I'll call it DeLuca's Genesis 2 is the Rhema and Genesis 3 is the cosmos and we explain that so let's quickly read Genesis 3 then we take a seat Genesis 3 chapter 1 Genesis chapter 3 verse 1 Genesis chapter 3 verse 1 now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman ye hath God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden amen shall we be seated praise God hallelujah so now the topic is the movie I was part of a few movies it's not a word you won't find it in the dictionaries I made it up amen spoiled Co means God and a Greek word a morpheme is changing morphology to change to translate from one form to another so I put his true with you miss Elohim attend I got or it's a now feel funny I'll go into that then Murphy changing his attribute or expanding his territory amen so Theo Murphy T H yo mo r p hy few more feet draw a bigger circle of laughs amen so now God wanted to draw a span himself he wanted to bring more territory to himself we know that before the foundation of the world we were in Christ we're not in Christ like our children isn't us amen maybe my brother have children in him I have to renew me but you can't see my children right but now God children were not in that form gasps children were real they were in manifestation not of the terrestrial but when the celestial dimension amen so the Bible said that when Drew was going through afflictions and he forgot who he was he was crying and weeping and mourning the loss a Jew where were you when the sons and daughters of God shouted for joy they scream the victory jube was in Christ before the foundation of the world he had a celestial body caught few few few funny earth you'd call it a locust College the wet body call it a celestial body is the same thing amen but then jube forgot himself because God put us in this lower part of the earth to bring an attributes of redemption so if everything is perfect we're not going to need a redemption so it's part of God's manifestation so that we go through trials affliction so that the attributes in you will come out amen so Joe forgot himself and the Lord reminded him that you were part of me you a manifestation you were real you are not just a thought the thought of God is real so the thought of God is not like our thinking you think about a blueprint I'm gonna go to house do it this form two bedroom five bedroom no gas storage the house is already there amen so before you became flesh you were already I feel funny amen you were already in the Silesia you have the same brother Salim on December the Salamone but now in order to manifest here the Lord had to break himself down a man just like lectricity you can't go and plug your electricity one day on under under under station with a thousands of volts is going to Fred I mean a cuckoo Amen you get big good fried and everything else I can talk about but then when we step it down to maybe 110 volt or 220 volt in UK you can plug in and what get electricity use it to do stuff that we are doing same thing got a sweetie pie himself down amen so he broke himself into pieces begin to break himself into pieces getting lower and lower so that he could manifest so he formed a shadow of himself that we see called a human flesh amen so that shadow is God becoming as press in the 8th God expanding his territory amen one God created the universe he created the angels first they were worshipping him but I was not enough for God that made him God God means object of worship but it was a redeemer so he had to keep on breaking himself and expanding drawing a biggest like circle of love amen so all that is going on is the love of Christ the redemption coveri the Prophet is saying that songs going on is God expanding himself in a bigger territory now what he talked about the logos the logos is the word body the logos is Christ the logos is Elohim in fact before he became the wet body he was Elohim the Jewish or Hebrew word for the soft assistant one is called Elohim lla Elohim the one who is by himself with all the attributes in him all his sons and daughters in the celestial body so Elohim means God in the celestial body amen but any had an attribute of the Torah as well so he has to do certain things to bring himself down and express that Oratia so he begin to move himself in the logos the logos is called a wet body that was what brother Michael was way before the foundation of the world amen that's what's the status we where we before the foundation of the world and that is what you are all the time Amen that's Alicia baddha konasana that's Alicia but it doesn't no no defeats that Sailaja body is not afraid of demons the celestial body has no limitation when you go to sleep the /aa body doesn't sleep he's an angel he's all-powerful his antenna he has no beginning and he has no end amen and that is who you are amen we don't tell this thing's to swallow your mind but is the truth of the word of God that you are not just a flesh limited to this piece of meat by your antenna on the inside Amen so when a situation arise that this guy cannot hold it or this lady cannot hold it then the guy on the inside come out and take off situations amen glory hallelujah and that is the sons and daughters of God amen that is Christ that is a true you amen so all that God is trying to do is get to know for to help us to know who we are take a baby in the womb when the baby is in the womb he or she doesn't know what's going on but the mother knows what is going on amen the mother knows when the baby is kicking the kitchen hay and stuff like that the father knows that I need to bring this vitamin I need to make money to bring this food to provide this new trends to provide a right atmosphere for my wife and my baby to bone right so when you didn't know who you were that feel funny knew you amen when you didn't know who you were walking in sin you didn't even know you you did not think about Christianity you didn't know you have a father you didn't know you came from God you didn't know you are Christ you didn't know you are a tenor the tenor person the true you knew you amen when you had contamination that never condemned you to light you taught like I'm on my way to hell I'm already in hell when you on drugs when there was no hope for you when you were put in there it would put you at array they don't count you among people because you were useless he that is in you knew you amen before even you think about the Holy Ghost baptism to receive the Holy Ghost he was already there amen remember that's what I was saying he was there all that time he was there time so the Holy Ghost is just for you to make you to know that he was there all the time and you preach on three walls so you give him the free wall to marry you he comfort kill the old man the old devil they also the older sittin Lucifer then he took on true Italy preeminence in you and that bring you toward all the things that you lost all the things that you didn't know I mean easier you didn't know you came from God you never had that word on so you came to read just Shh until you somebody brought you to the church until you read the Bible on till you read William Rams message until you read a mystery so for then you got to know that in I came from God so I'm not a drug addict so begin to throw away the Monisha I came from God I'm not a prostitute I'm not a criminal it doesn't matter my criminal records that is not me you funny doesn't have criminal records Amen few funny doesn't have depth amen it doesn't matter how much you owe in the few funny doesn't own nothin not even a penny Amen because he's eaten ah he owes everything on this earth amen glory hallelujah now that is a few funny Elohim wanted to manifest himself so he created to begin to form himself but Brahm said the word the Greek word is kenosis kenosis like god vomiting himself up it doesn't mean like he's vomiting God is there that is where tuna tuna Tyrian get off the way they look at the Bible said that Jesus went to the father sat at the right hand of God right so in a human imagination the father is a big Almighty God here Jesus Christ is not a right right side here and the holy spirit like a dove no it's just one person Oh is right the Lord your God is one and we are supernatural is right we have only one God amen we don't have two guys one sitting in heaven one living in you wondering we are caused in the same Elohim manifesting himself amen so kenosis or God am orphan himself means he's changing his attributes just like you are dressed up for church when you get back to the sisters get back to home they change into the I want into the into their kitchen cloth to cook some food put on aprons right in the same sisters in the same system and establish our sister Tonya the same person he just only changed her dress from church clothes to kitchen clothes because she want to cook for her children and her family it's not a different person who jump into the clothes amen that's why I was the last people I Jack was preaching the preacher on a second Corinthians 5 when this earthly tabernacle is what is broken and dissolve is done away with you have another Tabernacle eternal in the heavens not made by man and women no not made in sin but it's eternal isn't it in the dimension right here and when this one is finished when it's closed when I finish my preaching and go home I just take this one and put in some way I'm not dead the robot I cook whistle on the inside the same thing that will feel funny the Holy Ghost the Christ in you he cannot die that's right Christians do not die because Christians are Christ they are not trying to be Christ but the Christ the did he made himself Christ Christ made them Christ amen Christ manifest in them so that was the the logos God bringing himself down from the selicia dimension and by the way / a dimension doesn't mean is in the planet is on top of Jupiter or moon no it's right here but it's a more faster dimension it's a more stronger dimension what is the strongest force on the planet love the love of Christ the strongest force is not hatred no the strongest force is not a u.s. army or their Russia bombs the strongest force is the love of Christ I don't want to divide but one time William Brown was walking in I think Siberia Finland some way and Russian soldiers and civilians suggest some of them they don't agree and they were fighting against each other and this man the whole ego see him walk around and he just put something to them and suggest we're at enemy put their arms around each other crying and singing or amazing bliss only belief what made a difference he didn't use weapon to third and I hate you guys should get together but somebody past there who was still funny who was Christ in him and a Christ in him influence the students were battling who didn't agree with each other he went to South Africa there were tribes who didn't agree with each other and now this tribe began to sink I don't know I think he's only believed on the streets when they saw the love of God healed thousands of people hospitals were emptied all the doctors lost a patient everybody's what they went home and the to to the street singing only belief all things are possible so the strongest laugh is the love of Christ in you amen is the love of Christ that causes the star to go m34 brought a prayer request when a friend or something like that had resisted for cancer and people pre the city where the one who had seed for cancer when if you want to if one got to hear your prayer put yourself in the passage shoe put yourself that you are the one who has got stood for cancer and your life you go to least three six or seven months you leave and when you pray the Holy Ghost in you cannot risk the Holy Ghost you come out and do the supernatural amen that is the love of God drawing a bigger psych circle of love amen spanning your territory amen not that about me I and mine but it's about my brother my sister and even my enemy MA Krystal's we don't have enemies somebody can hit you don't have any enemy my enemies myself the West enemies not since I know the worst enemy of mine is not the one who want to kill me by the West enemies myself if I do have one so if Christ can't catch me I don't have no enemy praise God hallelujah if Christ can catch me me is my enemy and if I'm conquered and I'm no longer my enemy I'm Christ so don't don't worry about somebody else let Christ take on true let him eat the control tower and you won't have no enemy the love of God will radiate from your heart amen so the locust is the way it is that few funny is the body of Christ when God begin to move himself into this earthly dimension yes the locust was not of the earth it's a celestial body is the pillar of fire is the lake of fire is the Holy Ghost we got different attributes and different names when is he brother Solomon we call it the Holy Ghost before he had the Holy Ghost he didn't he didn't know who he was so he has to quicken him so it was called the quickening power it's not a different person quickening means bringing to brother solomon's might bring it to my mind who I was before the foundation of the world before I was born through sin by my dad and mom Paul and Victoria I was feel funny I was Atena I was the lump of God I was Jesus Christ but for the sake of redemption has to come to the attribute of my dad and mom to be born in sin but when you are born again you change parents amen amen your father became the pillar of fire and your mother is the New Jerusalem the New Jerusalem the mother of us all both your dad and your mom is Jesus Christ amen glory hallelujah we still have our parents we love them but I've got a high appearance when my parents are no longer on this earth I've got my parents in me Jesus Christ the pillar of fire the mother my mother in Jerusalem who stood me up amen glory hallelujah who's the appearance when they were young but the pillow if I hold them Jesus Christ for them the Heavenly Father holds you amen so now that was Jesus Christ bringing himself down now he began to create in the web body the logos he wanted to dwell in a man now when it was in a man he became the Rhema the Rhema means the spoken word reminds RHD ma when Christ in dwells in a man then he moved from the locust locust but now the higher attribute is the Rhema the God whether was spoken in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth and God created everything buddy could you find rest God is a spirit what he doesn't work he doesn't go to they don't give him pitch a quagmire Monday through Friday or Saturday do extra hours and they give you some paycheck and extra bonuses no that is not it as well for nobody he said spirit but what race was God looking for to rest in a man to create this time assistant element to create Adam read F to dwell in so that he can manifest he can drink water he can smile he can laugh he can with his hands he could even cry who you can equip our children he could pad animals so that love was in him so he also draw a bigger circle beyond the locus beyond the Elohim to become the Rhema the spoken word insisting element of flesh amen praise God hallelujah let me know the time so now you lose record of the time oh praise God hallelujah the Lord is so enough for when the sister was given the testimony and after I look at the computer at the time was eleven eleven eleven is the strongest business of God it's a no more standing upright with God remember Jesus had 12 disciples but one was one of the wicked one the leavenworth true discipleship and as this one now we are now perfect perfectly disciple of Christ standing in array in line with the word of the Lord Amen god bless you sister for your testimony amen that is what the church that when they came from the Upper Room when the key for the Upper Room the sisters the brothers is a goddess one in Christ there's no Greeks there's no Gentiles there's no female there's no meal we are all Christ we are attended to be awed feel funny so they feel funny in brother Salomon but at Troy and it's funny Davina can do the same thing amen the same fee-funded up in their songs in sister Michelle and the sister dancing here the same Holy Ghost that inspired the preacher a simile goes that the little children and every son and daughter of God if you have the Holy Ghost is the same Christ amen and when you speak when you free Christ in you does the supernatural he does americo's glory hallelujah now if you means the invisible God God not made flesh he's in a celestial Ram funny means the invisible Elohim made flesh made earthly amen so few more famous few God change himself in another attributes moving from the silesia form to the tarisha form amen God moving from the Almighty God who covers all space or the planet to dwell in a body called Jesus Christ so that he could manifest here in earth now the supernatural being a morphing changing himself in different attribute of laughs the logos means thinking ordering something into sheep and giving it a form so the logos allow God to make himself in an earthly form because you want to just lightly tricity you want to make himself in a usable form if their life is this in the work station is in that sauce it's not usable if you try to use it he's going to break into pieces so now these logos is trying to break himself down into usable forms that you can use it to connect the computers the musical instruments and a cooking stove and different things so Christ's changing means off is the end morphine whew changing himself in our attributes in the sisters in the brothers in musicians in the preaches so that he can manifest himself expand his business and its territory the Laurie hallelujah praise be to God now there are this few funny means the semester at the Zoe the zoo is a Greek we are the well zoo what is rooh is where we keep animals right zoo means where we have botany life now the Zoe means the very life of God the very life of God is in you and that you cannot die the same way is for Lucas the same is the wet body the same is the few funny the same is the celestial body Spanish call it juice they pick it from from the Greek few do the same way the Rhema is the smoking weight ll Elohim the supernatural man this is dimension a person flesh and bone holy spirit the spirit man is this is the one you are amen so sometime when the Bible uses different terms Giovanni pillar of fire a lake of fire is not different things together is the same Almighty God is the same Christ amen any revelation any doctrine that is not centered or doesn't bring Christ does not exist forget about it it doesn't matter how sweet the sound if it's not Jesus Christ if it's not Christ it doesn't exist amen so it's a just a fairy tales but then the logos they feel funny is Christ Almighty God in different expression of himself when it's my brother we call it the Holy Ghost baptism one is judging the world when people who are given a chance to believe the Word of God they forsake the Word of God and then finally the Holy Ghost has to annihilate them in otherwise it will destroy them the body the flesh is the spoken word of God the sistine element just like asses the element who go back to the 8th bernard yeah spirit the wikis producted wickedness they never accepted christ they didn't repent and they died in their sins they finish their life on earth they cannot go to the presence of of the logos they cannot go to the presence of God so what does the Holy Ghost do it has to terminate their life how does he do it come in the form of the lake of fire it doesn't mean there's a lake somewhere big league somewhere I don't know the biggest lake in Mississippi or whatever lake then we've got big angels and they've got a book here they write your name ok you didn't do the right thing let's grab him and throw him to the lake no that's not that is a human imagination lake means Guardian super the earthly language to explain spiritual things of God just like Natura you swim in a lake you wash yourself the same thing the lake means is the fire of God that's what the League of fire what fire not a natural fire but a supernatural fire that consumes in that consume unbelief that consumes eNOS that consume politics that consume diseases that consume cancer that consume gossip that consume anger that consume frustration that comes from all evil and set gospel free so if it's working on a believer is the lake of fire if it's working a non-believer sorry if it's working on a believer is the pillar of fire if it's working a non-believer to consume is called a lake of fire it is sort of Almighty God amen is the same person Jesus Christ glory hallelujah it's not a different person God is one Elohim is one amen we are one people one faith one spirit one baptism Amen my brother is no different for me my sister is no different from me on earth he doesn't look like you he looks different it's got different parents the one on the inside amen that's why the professor a bride cannot prescribe right we all want one wife of Christ I'm a wife of Christ you are the wealth of Christ we are all one so I cannot take my hand and break my hand I'm killing my own self I cannot take my hat in my head and just take a machete or something like that and cut my head I'm destroying myself I cannot pluck my eyes out it's me amen so my sister my brother is me if I if I do something wrong I'm destroy my own self that's what the Bible said that love your neighbor as yourself the greatest commandment is love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy might with all thy strength without a substance with everything now the Lord Brooke himself a little down and he became my sister he became my brother he became my little brother's here he's me how do I appoint him he's my friend he's a little preacher so it's me if I touch him I'm touching myself but it's me so I see much expression as passion of me amen so you can love him like you are loving yourself if your brother doesn't have a coat and you have two you can take it and give it to him what's the one time there was a soldier I think one of the church leaders it was it was a French soldier and he was walking on the street he saw this poor man in freezing nobody just nobody just walk around and he was watching if somebody help you nobody walk who helped him so he took his military jacket took his knife cutting into two and wrap this beggar wrap him up what is it listen and he put on the high half and we're laughing at what's wrong with this guy who's crazy he went and done night he had a vision or a dream whatever you call it and he saw Jesus Christ were wrapped in the same half the cloth you give it to him if I do something to brother Michael I'm doing to Jesus Christ if I do something Sarika into Jesus Christ so you laugh when I laugh when we project that when it's coming from vertical right coming from above from God is what we call it a divine laugh the similar one is in my heart or when it's in your heart and you project it to sister Tanya is what brotherly or sisterly love Amen so it got a lot before before I can predict you about a troy have to have it in me face that's why the Bible says seek ye first the kingdom of God and all its righteousness see the Holy Ghost get to know who you are you have to have a battle with God Amen if you don't know that you have the Holy Ghost you have to get ahold of God Lord I need to know if I'm your daughter you have to work very fight in my life you have two places in my life that I'm a part of this family amen I'm true that I'm part of this family but I have to sit in my DNA amen I have to do a DNA test to see that I'm a father and son of such-and-such family I'm part of Jesus Christ mr. and mrs. Jesus Christ and then Jesus Christ who really chewed up my daughter my son you are mine amen I give back to you amen look at your DNA look at my DNA you're my spirit and your spirit is the same thing look at me and look at you I am the one living in you amen I'm the one who has been holding you all along your life when you were walking in when we were broken when you didn't have no hope when you were sick when you were nearly died I was the one who pick you up amen and you are me and I am you amen and that is what the Holy Ghost baptism and when you get to know who you are you just match to every enemy every devil every demon and tell him that hey now I Know Who I am I am the son of the president I'm the son of the world ruler I am mrs. Jesus Christ my husband is Jesus Christ and all that you took for me my joy my family my heritage give it to me back I need my hands back give it to me because you know who you are I need a bank account and it I know my signature I needed the money the billions of dollars is for from My Father and I'm the one who hated my father give it to me this my signature this might shake give it to me give me my son give me my daughter give me my husband give me my wife my uncle give me my friend he'll the cancer destroyed a demon set him free amen because you are Christ amen you know who you are by pretty there's a song we sing if I can remember is that I can see now who I am a child of my say via a child of his laughs it's a revelation by predestination of Who I am so it's a revelation to you by predestination before the foundation of the world that you is a daughter of God you are a daughter of God you a child of God nothing can separate you from God nothing can separate me for me I am me amen you can't do nothing to me I am me you can see people I try for my Latroy that is him amen the devil can't put you God company that they were to put bring a sickness it doesn't change you it can let you loose your job it doesn't change you you can let your children run on the street doesn't change you because you what you are Christ and by your faith by your revelation you bring them back to you amen so every blessing everything you are looking for is in you he who the seed of God dwells in does not Commission it a seed of God what is the seal of God the Holy Ghost the weight the weight is a seed sown into you they feel funny deplore fire the angel of the Covenant the Zoey of God is in you you can Austin you can make a mistake and it will patch you out just like our clothes do we wash our clothes yes they get daddy right we wash them so that you can get cranking your spirit but it doesn't make you a sinner the Holy goes through the quickening power will come in cooking you amen when you get sad and you get better let the Holy Ghost come forth and sweep through your heart when did I would try to infect you this period no this is know me how can I be bit against my brother my sister Lord take this route for me that is not me I want to love my sister I want to have my brother I want to love even destined on the streets I want to draw a bigger circle of love I want to expand my territory I want to share the gospel with even those who who attacked me those who don't love me up you prove on your knees praying for them the Lord forgive ya son don't put it against them Lord transform them I was once a sinner and they don't know what they are doing amen just like Jesus Christ when I was on a cross and they were calling for his blood demons were calling for his blood crucifying him Herod wanted to release him because couldn't find no sin in him he was innocent but then you said crucifying him who do I give it to you do I give it as sinners oh Jesus no crucify Jesus Christ and they took is what Barabbas or whatever the thief and the crucified Jesus Christ but look at what Jesus did it's a father people find me forgive them for they don't know what they are doing you are caught Christ in you don't kiss with your weight remember one time Elijah had a sort of Christ on him the other children made fun of him he was a bowed head and children called him old body they were making fun of him and you've got me sad himself we got mad and he said move obey he called it because he's a prophet this seems pretty seen you and at 42 children ate him alive but Ram said that it wasn't the will of God it was the angered a prophet and because we've got Christ in you somebody can make you mad even your children if you tell your child you never going to prosper you not amount to nothing you are casting your child your child can do something it can be a deviant but let the love of Christ free for him your child can abuse you insult you but forgive him or her your coworker can do something evil against you I can count whatever I've done against me but the love of Christ in you will bring that forgive them father and the loved one is projected just like the lady dad sister Vienna prayed for the church before she came said thank you and your church how did she know the church pray for her friend or her sister or whatever but the Holy Ghost let her know amen praise God hallelujah I'll tell you a story there was a little girl who was given a spell of Prayer that was a gift she was just a middle school girl or high school and she prayed that's what she does praise the Lord give a prayer that the Lord didn't give a big she wasn't a preacher of course she was a sister so one day she had a lot given a vision to see things so one day she went to bed and she was in his jet plane coming down she said a simple prayer and the Holy Ghost woke up get up I'm free so the more she pre she could see the plane moving up higher and gaining height and gaining altitude she didn't assign a dream and so she kept praying praying praying praying to the morning she slept a little bit I went to school when she was in school sudden officials came to her address where parent was and have an envelope for the moment that that there was somebody here a little girl here who was praying for us we could have crash as a crash right craft crashed but this girl was praying for us and the Holy Ghost let him know that there was this little girl in such-and-such a dress and they sent a package maybe Dallas a gift whatever certificate of appreciation to this little girl she wasn't a big woman she wasn't a pastor's wife she wasn't there he wasn't a preacher he wasn't a deacon it wasn't a trustee it was a little little girl but she knew who she was and she prayed and through her she saved maybe hundreds of a point a plane and they landed safely God could have said a plane without a little girl by in his program everyone is important before God not only the preachers not only that they can not only the sisters not only the mother's little children God has gotta work for each and every one amen when we pray things happen the Wicca's prayer of the weakest christian is omnipotent amen when the weakest prey are the one who does it in pretty more or I'm Wicca camp real like maybe but I try priests I'm struggling in my life when you go on your knees and pray just a little bit it does the supernatural because they similarly go Simba Detroit assembly goes in you and a little prayer that you pray make a difference amen so drawing a bigger cycle look at em let's say you have a brother but let me use make an example brother Michael right it's got some nice food delicious food you want to eat but his hands are so dead he he went to wake and he's got oil and a lot of stuff on his hands he doesn't have water and soap to wash so he's looking for wash what time soupy doesn't have it there's no water Pretenders know what I hear now I come from nowhere say but a mic this is my hanky just a ticket and wash it for me this water and soup it's all but a cuckoo I need to wash my own hands I can't wash your hanky I want to wash my hands that I can go and eat now if but but a mic he'll accept agree to wash my mind my handkerchief as he's washing with the soup he's inadvertently washing his hands is without knowing all the grease and the debt in a sense is coming off so that time you finished watching my handkerchief wash it it's got his hands clean so if you come to bed in bearer in the church you may have your own problem from the past started a little baby everyone has got a problem so but if you take out a people's problem upon yourself the least you can do is prayer you don't have to pay money to pray you don't have to put money on the credit card I need to pray for two minutes so I need to put maybe five dollars on my credit card no is for free Isaiah 55 come on to me you dad alibi and heavy-laden coming by for free so when you take brother Solomon's burden on your heart to free take it like your burden takes us an enormous burden on your heart to pray go on your knees sometime they don't have to tell you but if you preview add a spiritual person like a little girl that sheep read and a lot really to her that is a pretty plane jet plane I mean about to crash beginning free and sheep read the supernatural happened if you take that man on the street a homeless person on your way you meet him when you're going to work if you look at this madness oh don't condemn him or he's homeless he's on drugs he's wasted his money maybe he was a veteran he didn't use his money to feed his family now he went on dress and he's useless but if something touches you just like Jesus when he was walking in the Holy Ghost who touched him and you look at this person any pre God comes in and that's a supernatural just like Adam brother Jack Jack was preaching some time you don't have to pre just the love of Christ in your heart that's the does daily hence does a miracle was it Tuesday we're praying well as Simba brought a request regarding his brothers pepihuates passport something like that before we prayed it was a testimony we didn't have to pray it was already answered a lot as I did already because that before when you ask he knows it before you had a desire the Lord knows it and in you you have Christ the opening patatas in you it's not just for me I and mine but it's for sure ever one time in San Antonio one sister bought a house even a house was a Morocco she just desired that the Lord should give a house around his sister's house and her brother-in-law's house she didn't want to live far away she did she didn't preach just desired and the Lord in a meandering way give exactly what she needed so she wanted a believers to go and pray at when three and who eat food and so forth so we went and we're eating food and having fellowship and I'm somebody that I can see from behind I don't know how I do it but so not be walking I can see it's behind me and I saw the sister looking at me I mean we all fellowship in the house and she's looking at me and so I got Ripley's I said no I tend to look at a sister and I could see spirit of grief eyes were red I could see so deep sorrow in heart the husband was there eating normally but I could see that the sister wasn't happy she wasn't eating and deep sorrow in a hat so I guess at hey it was a so contact I was looking she was looking at directly at me she didn't say nothing to me I didn't go to pray for her I didn't ask her nothin but the Lord revealed it to me the problem that she's having immigration if live in us for 15 years or more they live in Texas they renew the Alliance's they've got a social and everything to wake but now Cesar tightens the law that if you want to renew your ID you have to bring your green card and so forth where's the green card they don't have it and nothing's I had on them they have a child Anita Reece and job is not they can wake because they don't have their IDs expired and I just look at her just like I'm looking at a salon now looking she was looking at me and that's we couldn't have I didn't pray I didn't say nothing but in my heart I could feel a burden and I think it was about two months three months the husband called me I was at work crying say brother thank you for their prayer you pray for me and my wife the Lord somehow give us a lawyer and we put in our kiss and we've got our paperwork's the Lord is gracious what is in the love of Christ in you can do what is projected some time I prefer Buddhist in the one I'm driving and before there's traffic and this condition I'll never meet this condition again Allah bless this review I don't know them I don't have to know them I don't know what they are going through but you may see on to somebody the Holy Ghost seen you can cry out even when you are sleeping you can't cry out your children you can't cry out your neighbors you can cry out to do Pastner you can cry for a change you can cry for the leadership for their mothers for their children for the schoolchildren you don't know what it is when you go to school the waters who is different you know you are adults you know your way out but I children are a strong influence the trees are them why do you wear dress why don't you wear pants why don't you have earrings why you braja might ýbrahim eat trees they go through things you don't know but the Holy Ghost in you can put yourself in their situation and pray for them like Lord lead your daughter's lead your science lead the four and the Lord would do things beyond you beyond your imagination god bless you brother Michael I mean I don't want you to take too long god bless you praise God hallelujah the Lord is awesome praise God praise God I want to read one scripture here John 13:34 2:35 John chapter 13 34 to 35 Jesus speaking through John he said a new commandment I give unto you that ye love one another as I have loved you that you also that you also love one another by this charmaine shall all men know that you are my disciples if you have love one to another amen does John sit and I want to read another scripture 1 Thessalonians Festus lunians chapter 4 verse 9 to 10 first thessalonians 4 9 to 10 1 thessalonians 4 9 to 10 it r is 1 thessalonians 4 9 9 and 10 but as touching brotherly love you need not you need not that I write unto you for yourself our thoughts of God to love one another and indeed you do it toward order brethren which are in all masses Macedonia but we beseech you brethren that you increase more and more amen Macedonia could be may be our little home Church our home our family or our local church or even new churches in South Florida but unless expand our laughs onto a brother/sister you made on to somebody that the enemy has taken him from the word of the Lord on somebody who is sitting at home somebody you doing we know believers in another countries people don't have their freedom you and I have people get persecuted in Arabic country the messages everywhere believe you miss in China is in Iran Afghanistan all those countries but they can hold Bible like you and I can who take your Bible and walk through the streets they will be killed do you say Sharia law to kill them and so forth they don't have but they are ghosts just like you yeah Christ so you have to expand your territory increase by praying for others by showing love on to others those who don't even deserve people who have done you wrong and you think they don't deserve your love love them anyway amen don't let any root of bitterness take ahold of your heart forgive easily let it go amen that is our Father Jesus Christ let it go he doesn't hold no grudge no just let it go and let the love of God strip through your heart when you see bitterness go on your knees lord this is not me that is not what you created me for I'm not a bit oppressed and take the bitterness from me I don't want grudges take it from me amen and let the love of God flow through me to my brother though you might be the right your brother will be wrong or somebody will be wrong free for them amen Freda you a Prius if you are the one who is guilty and a lotta Lord forgive them and you see the supernatural is the love of Christ in you amen and then what we do that we expand our territory the more we do that the more we seize Morocco's upon miracles upon a gift because that is the church God is looking for that is looking for a church that is softness that is want a wife that is selfless that will live for him and the vision that he give it to you amen the vision is not just about you what you weigh what the house is you build and so forth that is good you give it to you but expand your territory to others amen sometimes even you what you have you give it to others amen that is how our Father Jesus Christ lived that is our the fathers of the gospel from Abraham to Paul Peter James Branham Wesley they left they live they live a selfless life their life was not about accumulating everything for themselves but giving it on to people amen for example Liam Ramos a very poor man god bless him he had money and he used to read the messages and in future sometime people come from different part of the country they can afford Hotel said just let the Dickens know let me know our sister's rat us out before your motel because God has bless him he didn't want an empire he want to expand on to Addis amen the church has a need we need a church house you go on your knees Lord we know we have it already bring into manifestation touch their bankers touch whatever readers whatever in charge waking their hearts and a lot one site and shoot you that your prayer and said that request and said that burden amen three for the pasta sometime I think the pastor doesn't have a problem he's always happy and smiling no yes he's a human being amen he has family he has problem three for him good in your heart three for him pray for his family preface his finance previous economy preferred for the brita of the way pray for for the manifestation preferred the revelation pray for everything that you can pray for him and what he has to give it to you amen and sometimes things that you need God will use the pasta to say to answer it for you without even you going to tell him brother Jack maybe this and that but your prayer the Lord one side right here when is preaching that is how supernatural goddess and the Lord is not that is bringing as his brought us to that level that where the supernatural we let ourself go let go and let God let everything go just forget about him nothing you are nothing but let the Holy Ghost in you this Kluth he doesn't have control of me I can lift my hand I can wear it I can take it off when I want the same thing we share sofas clues that Jesus Christ is wearing lord whatever I want to do with this little piece of meat this is just one spoonful do whatever you want with this little piece of meat do whatever you want with my family do whatever you want with the blessing you giving to me do whatever you want with my money do whatever whatever I want with my hands do whatever I want with my foot if I have to lay before the lord lemon liver if after whatever I need to do let me do it and you see how God will bless you what a diva's on time praying for your needs the Lord will put it right there you and I'm talking from evidence amen the Lord does something that is beyond your imagination praise be to God hallelujah glory to God let's round off I wanted to read some quotes but I didn't read it yes yes it's okay do it next time praise God hallelujah so be sensitive our end with this being sensitive to the Holy Spirit being sensitive to Christ crisis in you but sometimes we get so caught up in the things of the world in our own personal life that we are not sensitive to him in our praise we offer the call is a man's prayer up ready before that's why I know it what is this man's prayer life sometimes you are late going through wagons oh lord I thank you for this day before even you finished and came you are ready in your car going that's called lazy man's prayer right when you come back from whom you are so tired and worn out you just Excel why you get something to eat oh lord I thank you for this day before you already snoring that's lazy man's prayer lazy ones prayer the prayer you don't win battles we do sprays you know how to be sincere to God God knows you're at a body doesn't win battles it doesn't do much it's just about you it's just about you you you are not drawing you are not drawing a bigger circle but do you might be tired but you still got on your knees and pray do the food is attracting you you so let the food go and you fast do you've got all the battles in your life use of other people's challenges and fight for them and when you do that you're gonna see supernatural in your life because you are the supernatural you is the supernatural and the Lord wants you to just want you to be away and surrender amen one day I was in San Antonio I was sleeping sometimes people my best on tomorrow sleep on I better have a little mattress and time I just I just go do is good for the back so I just lie on the on the mattress my favorite
