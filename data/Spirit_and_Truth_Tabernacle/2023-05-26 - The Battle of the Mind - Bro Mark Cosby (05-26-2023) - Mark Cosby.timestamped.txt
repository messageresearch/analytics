[32:15] amen this brother quinton's mom praise
[32:19] the Lord
[32:20] amen from Virginia
[32:23] amen she's here in Florida for a little
[32:25] bit and we just thank God Amen for for
[32:28] that amen been waiting for her for a
[32:30] long time amen but she's here in person
[32:33] so we we thank God for her amen amen
[32:37] well tonight uh we had been planning
[32:40] this amen for a little bit and
[32:44] um I I have a young brother that's gonna
[32:47] come and and Minister for us tonight and
[32:50] and uh I found out about him
[32:54] um kind of
[32:56] um almost unexpectedly
[32:59] and uh I was I was I was hearing about
[33:01] brother Mark having Bible studies and a
[33:04] man and just all these different people
[33:06] that would come and be a part of the
[33:07] Bible studies and Amen brother Jose and
[33:10] amen the family they start being a part
[33:12] of it because the way that we even got
[33:14] connected with brother Mark it was um
[33:16] almost uh I would just say it had to be
[33:19] divine because
[33:21] um you know we went to a Men's
[33:23] Conference there and I knew brother Mark
[33:25] before that but uh the other brothers
[33:27] didn't know him but we went to The Men's
[33:28] Conference and and I believe the person
[33:30] that was supposed to be in the room with
[33:31] brother Jose didn't show up to the Men's
[33:33] Conference and brother Mark comes in
[33:36] really late at night you know driving
[33:37] there and he gets there late at night
[33:39] and and uh and they uh so I think some
[33:41] kind of way brother Jose said he can
[33:43] just stay with me you know and they they
[33:45] got into the room together and I don't
[33:47] know how it happened but brother Josue
[33:49] had his clip was there gave her brother
[33:51] a haircut in his room and I mean they
[33:54] just had some real Fellowship they got
[33:56] connected you know at a pre pretty a
[34:00] powerful level there and you know they
[34:02] were just you know just some fellowship
[34:04] Brotherhood told me about the Bible says
[34:05] and say wow they would do it every
[34:06] Friday night and um you know or Friday
[34:09] nights I would say and then uh come to
[34:12] find out that as brother Mark was doing
[34:14] the the Bible study just different
[34:15] people joining from all over uh sister
[34:18] Abby was watching it and she said well
[34:20] you know what I can kind of help put
[34:22] your slides together to present you know
[34:26] the uh in the Bible study and I say uh
[34:29] sister I've been doing what she putting
[34:31] slides together presenting the Bible so
[34:32] I said well sister Abby can help us and
[34:35] you know in the church realize that she
[34:37] had a gift in that area right so uh
[34:40] that's why you see sister Abby over
[34:42] there behind amen the computer but
[34:45] here's the thing what blesses me is it's
[34:48] not what you come and do in public but
[34:51] it's what you're doing in private that
[34:52] God remembers amen and then he rewards
[34:55] you and puts you in public but you got
[34:57] to be doing the right things in Pride of
[34:59] it Hallelujah somebody amen so you know
[35:02] we we heard about that and I said you
[35:04] know what uh brother Marcus come down a
[35:07] couple times to visit us and you know
[35:08] I've been there to their Church once and
[35:10] I know the pastor my brother John A man
[35:13] also uh brother John's son-in-law his
[35:15] brother Aaron McGary amen so we there's
[35:19] you know just connections all over and
[35:22] uh so brother Mark was there and just
[35:24] faithful and and again I I I I like I
[35:28] I'll be honest with you I like finding
[35:30] brothers that's not looking to get in
[35:32] the pulpit
[35:35] amen I we like finding David's out there
[35:39] in the field playing their heart
[35:41] and don't nobody know about them
[35:43] but somehow Saul get wrapped up in some
[35:46] spirits
[35:48] and they need an anointed musician
[35:51] and then there's other people that tell
[35:54] us all about this guy that they know out
[35:56] there playing his heart so you need to
[35:58] get him to come in here because when he
[36:00] play you ought to see the animals just
[36:01] lay down
[36:04] but this fellow when he play he's
[36:06] anointed and they brought him out to
[36:09] play for Saul and you know it was God
[36:11] promoting David amen I love when God
[36:14] does that so uh we we all always want to
[36:17] try to create a platform where uh young
[36:20] ministers can go forth amen and and just
[36:23] Express their hearts to the Lord uh you
[36:26] know like I say uh I believe I believe
[36:28] it's strongly in the scripture a man's
[36:31] gift makes room for itself and brings
[36:34] them before great people you never have
[36:36] to push yourself into a Pulpit anytime I
[36:39] feel somebody pushing themselves I get I
[36:41] get a little weary of that but just wait
[36:44] for God to open up the door amen
[36:46] everywhere that I've gone and everywhere
[36:48] I'm scheduled to go is not me asking to
[36:51] go there
[36:52] but it's God opening up the door for me
[36:54] to go so I thank the Lord for it amen so
[36:57] it's hey man good to be here tonight and
[36:59] we want to a man just prepare our hearts
[37:01] to receive the word of the Lord uh

[40:01] it's the honor and a privilege to be in

[40:04] brothers and sisters I just thank
[40:06] brother Jack and the Lord for the
[40:07] opportunity to be here with you guys and
[40:09] thank you for all the prayers I
[40:11] appreciate it and um let's just break
[40:13] right open to the word of God we'll
[40:15] start in Mark chapter 10 verses 17
[40:17] through 30.
[40:19] evade from the scriptures
[40:28] say Amen when you get there I'd love to
[40:30] hear Bible's turn
[40:34] amen verse 17 and he was gone forth into
[40:38] the way there came one running into the
[40:41] way and kneeled to him asking him good
[40:44] Master what shall I do that I may
[40:46] inherit internal life and Jesus said
[40:49] unto him why call us thou me good is
[40:53] there none good but one that is God
[40:57] thou knowest the Commandments do not
[40:59] commit adultery do not kill do not steal
[41:01] do not bear false witness defraud not
[41:04] honor thy father and thy mother and the
[41:06] answer is saying to him master all these
[41:09] have I observed from my youth up this
[41:11] wasn't some Infidel but this is a man
[41:13] who who follow the Commandments of God
[41:15] who who lived a clean life so isn't this
[41:18] anybody off the street but somebody who
[41:20] was trained in his youth up verse 21
[41:22] then Jesus beholding him loved him and
[41:25] said unto him one thing that thou lack
[41:28] is this one thing he lacked not many
[41:30] things but one thing was stopping him
[41:32] from eternal life
[41:34] go thy way so whatsoever thou has and
[41:38] give to the poor and thou shall have
[41:39] treasure in heaven and come and take up
[41:42] the cross and follow me
[41:44] and he was sad at that saying and went
[41:46] away grieved we had great possessions
[41:49] verse 23 and Jesus looked around about
[41:52] and saith on his disciples how hardly
[41:55] shall they that have riches enter into
[41:57] the kingdom of God and the disciples
[41:59] were astonished at his words but Jesus
[42:02] answereth again and saith unto him the
[42:04] children how hard is it for them that
[42:06] trust enriches to enter into the kingdom
[42:09] of God it's easier for a camel to go
[42:12] through the eye of a needle than for a
[42:14] rich man to enter into the kingdom of
[42:16] God and they were astonished at the
[42:18] measure and saying amongst themselves
[42:19] who then can be saved and Jesus said
[42:22] unto them with men it is impossible with
[42:24] God
[42:25] but With God all things are possible
[42:27] amen just bow our heads in the word of
[42:30] Prayer
[42:31] dear heavenly father we just thank you
[42:33] for this glorious opportunity Lord Lord
[42:36] we've came here in your house Lord just
[42:38] to meet with you Lord I pray father you
[42:40] prepare our hearts Lord as that Parable
[42:43] you spoke of the good ground Lord let
[42:44] each heartless be such a good ground
[42:46] that we could receive the Word of Life
[42:48] from you lord lord to speak to each one
[42:51] of us personally Lord may we take what
[42:53] you speak to us Lord let's apply it to
[42:55] our lives remember Paul just spoke about
[42:57] this uh about taking the word not just
[43:00] being here but being a doer of the word
[43:01] Lord and father we've come here Lord and
[43:05] we're so thankful that you've guided our
[43:06] footsteps and brought us here safely
[43:08] Lord this move your unworthy servant out
[43:10] the way Lord I don't have anything for
[43:12] him but you do Lord just use these lips
[43:14] Lord and speak Words of Life to your
[43:16] people Lord Jesus Lord take this gift
[43:18] that you've given me Lord and just use
[43:20] it to glorify yourself Lord Jesus Lord I
[43:23] pray you bless these scripture that's
[43:25] read he's quote that will be read I pray
[43:26] you bring it to life Lord just write
[43:28] your word Upon Our Hearts and Upon Our
[43:30] Minds Lord
[43:31] you know we invite your presence to take
[43:33] preeminence take control Lord ask all
[43:35] these things in Jesus Christ and we pray
[43:37] amen may be seated so we see this this
[43:41] Rich wrong ruler
[43:43] he was so he something in his heart he
[43:45] was seeking for he was missing he had a
[43:47] missing void in his heart and he knew
[43:49] there was something different about
[43:50] Jesus he could tell by the way Jesus
[43:53] conducted himself the spirit that Jesus
[43:55] had and he wanted what Jesus had
[43:58] right but when Jesus gave him what he
[44:00] needed to give up it wasn't something I
[44:02] wasn't like do this and do that but it
[44:04] was just one thing and follow me but the
[44:07] reason why Jesus told him to do this
[44:09] thing because one thing that was an idol
[44:11] in his life because we noticed brother
[44:13] Branham said anything you put before God
[44:16] is an idol your work can be an idol your
[44:18] family can be an idol
[44:20] and so Jesus was trying to make known to
[44:23] him that this riches was in his way
[44:26] right because it's not bad it's not a
[44:28] bad thing to have riches but it's a bad
[44:30] Jesus said it's a bad thing to trust
[44:31] then right he knows what Solomon Solomon
[44:33] didn't ask God for riches he asked how
[44:36] he can help his people and then God
[44:38] blessed them with those riches so notice
[44:40] notice the difference between those two
[44:42] and I don't know if you have that
[44:44] picture if we can put up but then 25 is
[44:46] easier for a camel to go through the eye
[44:48] of a needle than for a rich man to enter
[44:50] the kingdom of God and when I was
[44:53] studying this a long time ago I remember
[44:54] trying to picture what that really meant
[44:56] and then come to find out is that so a
[44:59] camel has to go through this really
[45:00] small door and he has to unload
[45:03] everything exactly right so let me read
[45:04] this quote see what a curse money
[45:06] enriches is no wonder Jesus says
[45:08] scarcely a rich man can enter the Gates
[45:11] of Heaven like a camel going through the
[45:13] eye of a needle has to unload his
[45:16] burdens check this out and get on his
[45:18] knees and crawl under and he can get
[45:21] there but he has to unload first so we
[45:24] have to unload first especially being
[45:26] being youth you got to know get to know
[45:29] God at your youthful ages because as you
[45:32] get older it's going to be a lot harder
[45:34] because the devil has worked on you he
[45:36] is trying to mold something inside of
[45:38] you so get to know God at a young age
[45:41] unload now don't wait to unload then
[45:44] because I waited until I was 24 and I
[45:47] had so much baggage that I had I brought
[45:50] in so many scars unnecessary scars and
[45:53] God was calling me before but I didn't
[45:55] want to live that life and I had to pay
[45:57] the price right so I'm speaking for you
[45:59] guys don't pay the price that I had to
[46:02] pay amen I'm an example that you don't
[46:04] have to follow now follow the example
[46:05] I'm now leading follow me as I follow
[46:08] Christ
[46:09] amen
[46:10] so the thing is
[46:14] right now but the thing is we got so
[46:16] many influences we got social media
[46:19] everybody's trying to get that check
[46:20] mark everybody's trying to be famous but
[46:23] you don't know what that life has in
[46:26] store what they do behind closed doors
[46:28] you may see what they look like in a
[46:31] video but what they're doing behind
[46:32] closed doors you don't know about the
[46:33] stress the unnecessary things you have
[46:36] to go through
[46:37] so all these influences we got in the
[46:39] world this is one of the hardest days
[46:41] for a youthful person to live in it's
[46:43] the hardest I thought it was hard when I
[46:46] was growing up but now it's so much junk
[46:48] that the devil has just promoted things
[46:51] that used to be wrong are now right and
[46:54] this is craziness and so we got all
[46:57] these we got Hollywood trying to
[46:59] influence our youth with Fashions
[47:01] Hollywood trying to get in our homes
[47:04] right half people have Bibles nowadays
[47:07] then they kicked God out of schools and
[47:10] they wonder why there's there's gun
[47:12] shootings all the time because you kick
[47:13] the very person that can protect you
[47:15] from all these things
[47:18] praise God so as young people don't
[47:21] compromise because all those things Fame
[47:25] Fortune they're going to pass away one
[47:27] day but what's done for Christ won't
[47:29] pass away amen God is trying to call you
[47:32] now he has a certain path he wants to
[47:34] lead you but you got to let that door in
[47:37] your heart as he knocks on it open onto
[47:39] him let him have entrance he wants to
[47:42] his plans to prosper you to give you an
[47:45] expected end he wants to he won't not
[47:47] just bless you in the natural right but
[47:50] he wants you to Soul to Prosperity
[47:51] that's the most important thing to
[47:53] prosper is your soul because just
[47:56] because God has blessing us with all
[47:57] these Financial things and cars doesn't
[47:59] necessarily even mean that we have a
[48:01] strong walk with God but what indicates
[48:04] you have a strong walk with God each
[48:05] time you enter into these doors your
[48:07] nature is changing God is trying to
[48:10] change you from the inside out that's
[48:12] why it's so important as a young person
[48:13] to be born again receive that spirit
[48:16] because you receive that Spirit the
[48:18] devil can't get in if he would get in he
[48:20] had this go the same process that you
[48:22] would have to go through amen
[48:25] so everyone is following somebody how
[48:27] many believe that
[48:28] somebody somebody's influencing your
[48:30] life and that's why I say it's so
[48:31] important get off a social media I'm not
[48:33] saying you can't use social media but
[48:35] don't be trying to follow everybody you
[48:37] see
[48:38] we got all these bad influences that's
[48:40] right in this life that's right so be
[48:43] careful who you're following be careful
[48:45] who you're associating with because they
[48:48] might have a spirit on them that could
[48:49] catch upon you and you don't want that
[48:52] Spirit to catch upon you because Spirits
[48:55] are dangerous you see that man Legion he
[48:57] had over ten thousand Spirits think
[49:00] about that and he didn't even know what
[49:01] he was doing half the time amen so we
[49:04] can't compromise with the word of God
[49:07] we got to stay stand on the word of God
[49:10] it's the only this is the book that
[49:11] tells you where you came from and where
[49:13] you're going it's the only book that can
[49:15] change you but this book can't be read
[49:17] like an encyclopedia let God bring the
[49:20] word to life in front of your face Paul
[49:22] said the letter kills but the spirit
[49:24] bring it to life and I believe you're
[49:26] not too young to have a personal walk
[49:28] with God you're not too young to be
[49:30] filled with the Holy Ghost to seek God
[49:32] with all your heart with all your might
[49:34] and said in Jeremiah amen
[49:36] so at a young age the enemy is trying to
[49:39] gain control of your mind the prophet
[49:41] said the greatest battle ever fought is
[49:43] in your mind right and the title the
[49:45] title of this service is Battle of the
[49:47] Mind
[49:48] because every day we're in a battle
[49:50] whether you like it or not each day you
[49:52] wake up that's when the battle begins
[49:54] each day you wake up you can either hit
[49:56] your knees or not hit your knees but if
[49:58] you don't hit your knees you're going to
[50:00] lose the battle for the day
[50:02] so you get your strength from on your
[50:04] knees connecting with God the greatest
[50:06] thing a man and woman can do is get in
[50:08] connection with their creators to get to
[50:10] know them in a personal way because God
[50:13] is always moving he's always trying to
[50:16] speak to us but if we're not in that
[50:18] connection We're not gonna be able to
[50:19] hear what he has for our lives
[50:22] hey man
[50:23] so the tactic of the enemy is to get us
[50:26] to reason because I can't say that amen
[50:29] and the reason and the thing is like he
[50:32] likes to get our youth at such a young
[50:33] age because your mind is developing
[50:35] you're learning things but as you get
[50:38] older if he can get in there he can mold
[50:41] his agenda see the enemy has an agenda
[50:43] God has an agenda and the enemy has an
[50:45] agenda
[50:46] and the enemy likes to paint this
[50:48] picture that looks so good but he
[50:51] doesn't tell you the consequences that
[50:53] it has he didn't tell you the pain that
[50:55] it will bring in the future in the short
[50:57] term he doesn't tell you all these
[50:59] things he is like a get rich quick
[51:01] screen he doesn't tell you what's going
[51:03] to happen after you get rich amen so he
[51:07] wants to change your thinking to a
[51:08] certain pattern he's trying to plant
[51:10] Little Seeds which are his thoughts he
[51:13] has he's he's cunning he's crafty he's
[51:16] Sly let's go in the Book of Genesis 3.
[51:19] we'll see how he first
[51:21] taught
[51:23] this wicked serpent
[51:25] go to Genesis chapter 3 and we'll read
[51:28] verses one through eight
[51:38] amen now the serpent was more acceptable
[51:41] than any beast of the field which the
[51:44] Lord God had made
[51:45] and he said unto the woman yea had God
[51:48] said ye shall not eat of every tree of
[51:50] the garden so this this this devil asked
[51:53] this question to this woman and the
[51:55] woman said unto the serpent we may eat
[51:58] of the fruit of the Trees of the garden
[52:00] but the fruit of the tree which is in
[52:02] the midst of the garden God has said he
[52:04] should not eat of it neither shall you
[52:06] touch it lest ye die so far so good
[52:09] she's giving the word back what God Said
[52:12] but we want to see if she take if she
[52:14] stands on the word because anybody can
[52:16] mouth the word but it takes a lot to be
[52:19] able to stand in the word of God
[52:21] and the serpent said unto the woman ye
[52:24] shall not surely die notice he didn't
[52:26] change the whole thing he just changed
[52:28] point one percent of it right and that's
[52:30] how Sly and cunning he's not gonna come
[52:32] with pitchfork and fire but he's gonna
[52:35] come so slick and so Sly he's going to
[52:37] use 99 of the word but not all of it
[52:40] and if we're not sober and we're not
[52:42] Vigilant we're gonna miss it you got to
[52:44] know your word not just know it here but
[52:46] know it here brother Bram said I'd
[52:48] rather know the author than know the
[52:51] word because if you know the author
[52:52] you're going to know the word because
[52:53] God in his word are one you can't you
[52:56] can't separate him you can't
[52:58] forgot just knowing the day you eat
[53:01] thereof then your eyes shall be open he
[53:03] shall be as God's knowing good and evil
[53:05] see that Temptation that Satan gave her
[53:07] of fame or we could say being just like
[53:10] God
[53:11] and he painted this picture to her and
[53:14] she has a choice either to accept it or
[53:16] to reject it and we're going to see the
[53:18] decision she made and when the woman saw
[53:20] that the tree was good for food it was
[53:22] pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be
[53:24] desired to make one wise she took of the
[53:26] fruit thereof and did eat and gave also
[53:29] unto her husband with her and he did eat
[53:31] in the eyes of them both were open and
[53:34] they knew that they were naked and they
[53:36] sue fig leaves together and made
[53:38] themselves aprons so we see
[53:41] if we go down to we'll go to 11 verse
[53:45] 11. and he said who had told that thou
[53:48] was naked as out eating of the tree
[53:50] where for our community that should not
[53:52] eat and then one man said the woman whom
[53:54] thou gave is to me to be with she gave
[53:56] of the tree and I did eat see human
[53:59] nature is always trying to blame
[54:00] somebody else for their mistakes
[54:03] if they would have just took
[54:04] accountability for what they did
[54:07] she's trying to point fingers but in
[54:09] reality the devil can't make you do
[54:10] anything you you got to make the choice
[54:13] to say what you got to he what are you
[54:15] saying to you see the devil can fly over
[54:18] your head and put these thoughts but you
[54:20] gotta be willing to kick those thoughts
[54:22] out don't let the devil living in your
[54:25] land don't let the devil live in your
[54:27] mind you can take control of your mind
[54:28] casting on all imaginations and bringing
[54:31] every thought into the subjection of
[54:32] Jesus Christ
[54:34] amen and the man said the woman who thou
[54:36] gave us me to be was she gave me of the
[54:37] tree and I did eat and the Lord God said
[54:39] unto a woman what is that thou has done
[54:41] and the woman said the serpent begotten
[54:43] United eat and the Lord God said to his
[54:45] servant because thou has done this thou
[54:47] are cursed above all cattle and above
[54:48] every beast of the field and upon
[54:51] liability thou shall go in the dust thou
[54:53] she days of thy life so we see the
[54:55] the recompense of their decision right
[54:58] so we got to think about the decisions
[54:59] that we make right there's going to be
[55:01] consequences they can be good
[55:02] consequences or bad consequences in my
[55:05] life when I was young I made decisions
[55:07] and they had bad consequences it hurt me
[55:11] mentally physically things that I can't
[55:15] unsee that I've done and so I'm telling
[55:18] you guys don't get into those things
[55:20] that the devil is trying to tempt you
[55:22] because he'll take you further than you
[55:24] want to go you give the devil an end
[55:25] she'll take a mile all day and all night
[55:28] amen many are like Eve this is from a
[55:32] 1960 uh 12 11. many are like Eve Eve
[55:35] just stopped long enough to be deceived
[55:38] think about that she stopped long enough
[55:40] to begin to reason that's the Satan's
[55:43] main goal is to get you the reason he
[55:45] wants to stop you long enough you begin
[55:47] to think and we begin to think you kind
[55:49] of lay aside the word of God
[55:53] amen she hadn't stopped there there
[55:55] never been no deceiving but Eve stop so
[55:58] when Satan comes stand upon the word of
[56:00] God right Jesus showed us how to combat
[56:03] the devil he used the word young people
[56:05] use the word of God don't be scared to
[56:07] stand Upon Jesus name there's power in
[56:10] the name of Jesus
[56:12] amen
[56:13] amen do you instead of pressing on do
[56:17] you know you follow follow me closer now
[56:19] listen the reason Eve was deceived let's
[56:21] say it together
[56:22] so I'll be sure you get it the reason
[56:24] Eve was deceived she never kept the full
[56:28] word of God she kept some of the word of
[56:31] God but if you take some of the word if
[56:33] you take the sum you lose the power of
[56:35] it right you got to have if I have a car
[56:38] I can't just have all the bells and
[56:39] whistles not have an engine in it
[56:41] because you can look nice just sitting
[56:44] there posting up but if there's no
[56:45] engine in there that car doesn't have
[56:47] the power and so that when you need all
[56:49] the word of God to have the full power
[56:52] Haven amen hallelujah Satan quoted it to
[56:56] her but he never told her all the truth
[56:58] neither does the denomination but she
[57:00] stayed long enough to get part of the
[57:03] word and didn't take all the words
[57:05] and so we see decisions brother Graham
[57:07] says are made in the mind in the head
[57:10] there's where Satan meets you and
[57:12] decisions are because that God made a
[57:15] man that way so God made us to think God
[57:19] made us to use our mind but we got to
[57:21] use our mind the way he intended for us
[57:23] to use it because the word of God first
[57:25] has to travel into your head and then we
[57:28] either you accept it or reject it it
[57:30] could become Revelation if you truly
[57:32] accept it so when that word is coming
[57:34] you got to say Lord this is all for me
[57:36] don't say don't Pitchfork it and say
[57:37] this is for this person that person but
[57:39] you take that word in just rate that
[57:41] word in as young young people you can't
[57:44] pray too much you can't read the word of
[57:46] God too much you can't be in the message
[57:47] the hour too much because it's going to
[57:50] build a foundation in your life
[57:52] God is trying to build us into houses
[57:54] all right and the foundation has to be
[57:56] faith in him faith in his word so as
[57:59] young people stay in the word of God
[58:01] keep seeking the Lord on your knees say
[58:04] God I need to know you more than life
[58:06] itself I don't want what this world has
[58:09] I know what this world has is death you
[58:12] could have all the fame and all the
[58:13] money you want but the end of your life
[58:15] is going to lead to death and
[58:16] destruction and we see the consequences
[58:18] of what happened to Adam and Eve and
[58:20] Adam was made perfect but he still had
[58:22] three more agency and you have the same
[58:24] three more agency that all of us does
[58:26] right choose you this day whom you'll
[58:30] serve that's what Joshua told Joshua
[58:32] told us amen now I have if he was
[58:35] looking at my note here a little map
[58:36] drawn out here I had it not here long
[58:38] enough used on the board the human being
[58:40] is made up like a grain of wheat it's a
[58:43] seed and the human beings exceed
[58:45] physically you're the seed of your
[58:46] father and mother and the life come from
[58:48] the father then the pulp come from the
[58:50] mother so the two to two together the
[58:52] egg the blood comes together and the
[58:54] blood cell is life and there it begins
[58:56] amen developing the child now any seed
[58:59] has a shell on the outside the inside
[59:01] pulp amen let's go to 72. now if you sit
[59:03] down here you get home and draw the
[59:05] three little rings you'll find out that
[59:07] human being has five senses so these
[59:09] five senses weren't used to contact God
[59:12] because these five senses were used to
[59:14] contact our Earthly home and so there's
[59:17] a soul inside of us that each one of us
[59:19] has right and that's where the word of
[59:21] God has to go to it can't fall in the
[59:23] flesh it has to go deep down in here
[59:25] because in each one of us there's a
[59:27] thirsting inside of us for God you can
[59:29] either choose to fill it with the things
[59:31] of the world or the things of God it's a
[59:34] black dog and a white dog inside of you
[59:36] if you feed the white dog then God is
[59:39] going to be preeminent in your life you
[59:41] feed the black dog then Satan is going
[59:43] to be primitive in your life and each
[59:45] day you have a choice what dog that you
[59:47] feed yeah do you feed the black dog
[59:49] you're serving Satan for the day and
[59:51] maybe a harsh thing to say but it either
[59:53] serve God or Satan whoever you yield
[59:55] Your Vessel to
[59:57] e i remember I was in the world I
[59:58] yielded my vessel to Satan right I still
[1:00:01] said I believed in God but I wasn't
[1:00:03] living for God all right I was running
[1:00:05] away from God and I wonder why my life
[1:00:07] was in such turmoil and such destruction
[1:00:10] because I was running away from the very
[1:00:12] thing that could give me peace that I
[1:00:14] was looking for looking for peace and
[1:00:16] alcohol and all these other avenues and
[1:00:19] I could never find got a tattoo all
[1:00:21] these things I was trying to
[1:00:23] find peace in and every every time I'll
[1:00:26] go to it I just needed more or some this
[1:00:28] and that and that and that so I say
[1:00:30] young people go to God right now go to
[1:00:33] God right now it'll be the best decision
[1:00:35] you ever made in your life when I gave
[1:00:38] my heart to God when I was going to my
[1:00:40] second job in my car I just cried out to
[1:00:43] God and gave my heart to say Lord you
[1:00:45] know exactly where my life needs to go
[1:00:47] and when I made that decision my life
[1:00:49] was clear I had peace was life was life
[1:00:53] just easy you know I had my my twists
[1:00:55] and turns and hardships but I remember
[1:00:56] every time I'll be like in a situation
[1:00:58] I'll go back to that day and remember I
[1:01:00] met with God in that car and that's what
[1:01:03] anchored me ever since my life has not
[1:01:05] been the same I've had joy unspeakable
[1:01:07] and full of Glory
[1:01:10] see happiness is based on circumstances
[1:01:12] but joy doesn't look at circumstances
[1:01:15] Joy is looks at the word of God the joy
[1:01:17] of the Lord is my strength amen amen
[1:01:22] amen so inside of the body is a soul and
[1:01:24] that soul is controlled by imaginations
[1:01:26] conscience memories reasons affections
[1:01:30] that's the thing that controls the soul
[1:01:32] but the spirit has only one sense the
[1:01:35] spirit oh let's get in that Spirit has
[1:01:37] one sense and that sense is either
[1:01:39] dominated it's either Faith or doubt you
[1:01:41] can either believe this word is for you
[1:01:43] or you can doubt tonight this word is
[1:01:45] for you I pray that you believe that
[1:01:47] it's for you because if you believe it
[1:01:49] is for you then it can change you
[1:01:50] because that's all God wants to do is
[1:01:52] change us to mold us to shape us let the
[1:01:55] master Potter mold you young people let
[1:01:58] them mold you at a young age don't do
[1:02:00] what I did in my my youthful ages I
[1:02:03] wasted so much time I wish I would have
[1:02:06] gave my heart earlier to God I would
[1:02:08] have I wanted so much heartache I could
[1:02:10] have just left behind
[1:02:12] hey man amen you can accept the faith
[1:02:16] either when you went to work therefore
[1:02:18] Satan began at the principal part to
[1:02:21] cause the spirit of man to doubt God's
[1:02:23] word because Satan knows that there's
[1:02:24] power in the word of God he knows if
[1:02:26] you're not connected then you are
[1:02:28] powerless Jesus said power is given to
[1:02:31] me in heaven and in Earth so he knows if
[1:02:34] you connect to God then he can't do
[1:02:36] anything to you but he knows if he can
[1:02:38] get you to doubt one eye out of one
[1:02:40] punctuation one comma then he has you
[1:02:43] right there because I can't defeat the
[1:02:45] Devil you can't defeat the Devil by
[1:02:47] yourself because this flesh God didn't
[1:02:49] come to redeem this flesh he came to us
[1:02:52] to redeem us inside of you that's what
[1:02:54] he came that Soul that's inside of you
[1:02:56] that's what he saw he didn't care about
[1:02:58] this fleshly body because we have one
[1:02:59] waiting for us on the other side amen
[1:03:03] amen so I looked the word acceptable
[1:03:05] it's Sly Artful cunning and crafty so we
[1:03:09] get we get the enemy some credit because
[1:03:11] he's a worthy adversary
[1:03:13] we can't underestimate him because
[1:03:15] because Eve underestimated look what
[1:03:17] happened
[1:03:19] so he he's insinuating
[1:03:21] he's deceitful he's treacherous and he
[1:03:25] beguiled which means to delude to
[1:03:27] deceive to impose on by a certain crap
[1:03:30] so we got to recognize that the enemies
[1:03:32] are roaring lines seeking who he may
[1:03:34] devour but if we can be aware of that
[1:03:37] get to know your enemy get to know that
[1:03:40] his main goal is to get you to doubt
[1:03:42] that's right and if you can recognize
[1:03:43] when doubt comes in because Satan knows
[1:03:46] the word
[1:03:47] front and back he believes that there's
[1:03:49] one God all these people thinking
[1:03:50] there's three guys was even Satan
[1:03:52] believed there's one God and so we got
[1:03:55] to know this enemy and we got to be
[1:03:58] aware and vigilant amen let's go to
[1:04:01] First Peter 5.
[1:04:03] first Peter 5 first Peter first Peter 5.
[1:04:07] read a couple verses in there
[1:04:09] amen
[1:04:16] so reverse five five so likewise ye
[1:04:18] younger submit yourselves unto the Elder
[1:04:21] so it's very important
[1:04:23] to be submissive to the Elder your
[1:04:27] parents has been brother Bram said your
[1:04:30] Holy Ghost is your parents until you get
[1:04:31] it
[1:04:32] right and so how you treat others is how
[1:04:34] you treat God so if you're disrespectful
[1:04:35] to your parents then you're being
[1:04:37] disrespectful to God so such important
[1:04:41] at a young age when I was growing up I
[1:04:43] said what they're like what you say boy
[1:04:45] I mean yes yes ma'am yes Dad
[1:04:47] and so I know sometimes we say what to

[1:05:41] your own personal walk for you you got
[1:05:42] to seek it after your dad can't do it
[1:05:44] for you I can't do it for you but you
[1:05:46] got to meet with God everybody has to
[1:05:49] meet in the backside of the desert like

[1:06:08] that mama said let me smell your breath
[1:06:10] mama there's nothing wrong with me

[1:06:14] that first lie so let's talk about how
[1:06:17] important is we don't think oh I just
[1:06:19] lied a little bit but we're gonna see
[1:06:21] what that lie turned into this
[1:06:22] individual's life see a small little lie
[1:06:25] can lead into something so greater than
[1:06:27] what you realize
[1:06:30] a red light began to flash to tell her
[1:06:32] the truth be honest little boy mama
[1:06:35] taught you not to do that but you see

[1:07:48] when the warning come on and when you
[1:07:49] feel that buzzer down in your heart
[1:07:51] warning you then you better stop and
[1:07:53] take inventory

[1:07:59] drifting away from God when you hear the
[1:08:02] word of God come right back to truly the
[1:08:05] word of God there's a little buzzer
[1:08:07] Rings you better listen to it now don't

[1:08:11] further until you come right back where

[1:08:29] come right back to him before you left
[1:08:30] him again let me go to this next quote
[1:08:33] the LIE the LIE the liar you might take
[1:08:35] one said uh to a man one day I thought
[1:08:37] was telling jokes and he come to find
[1:08:39] out he told so many lies till he really
[1:08:42] believed them think about that himself
[1:08:44] and I said what makes you do that and I
[1:08:47] sit down and talk with him I said I want
[1:08:48] to ask you those stories are too wild
[1:08:50] for people to believe he said the first
[1:08:53] one I ever remember telling knows that
[1:08:54] the first one he ever been telling I was
[1:08:56] a little boy that was raised in a good
[1:08:59] home I believe you're all raised in good
[1:09:01] homes
[1:09:02] he said I went out and smoked a corn
[1:09:04] silk cigarette just to be smart I ate
[1:09:07] some coffee to take it off my breath and
[1:09:08] he said I've done it back behind the old
[1:09:11] chimney behind the house and he said
[1:09:13] I'll never forget when my mother caught
[1:09:15] up and said to me Sonny let me smell
[1:09:18] your breath and I blowed my breath into
[1:09:19] her face and she said you'd eat coffee
[1:09:22] to take something off your breath what
[1:09:23] have you been doing have you been
[1:09:25] smoking cigarettes and he said something
[1:09:27] told me see something told him to tell
[1:09:29] the truth notice that that's a little
[1:09:31] conviction that God gives us and I
[1:09:33] remember in a world when I had a little
[1:09:34] convictions and I was like I don't need
[1:09:36] to follow that right now and it took me
[1:09:38] further than I wanted to go it almost
[1:09:40] ruined my life completely almost
[1:09:43] destroyed me nobody knew the the diction
[1:09:45] that I had but it was destroying me from
[1:09:48] the inside out
[1:09:51] amen he said Something Told Me To Tell
[1:09:53] the Truth he said I said no ma'am I
[1:09:55] crossed my heart I have been smoking I
[1:09:57] haven't been smoking cigarettes he said
[1:09:59] from that time it started you know from
[1:10:01] that time it started
[1:10:03] we can all find something that begin at
[1:10:05] a certain time and from then on things
[1:10:07] will change
[1:10:09] and there's other worthy things that we
[1:10:11] could think of men with good intention
[1:10:12] has tried to start a things Anew to do
[1:10:14] certain things brother Bram said this
[1:10:17] other statement always tell the truth no
[1:10:19] matter what takes place so young people
[1:10:22] if you've done something wrong don't try
[1:10:24] to hide it you see this individual you
[1:10:27] try to hide it and he went back to that
[1:10:29] first lie he told and ruined his whole
[1:10:31] life
[1:10:32] so just be honest just be truthful
[1:10:35] because one lie he become to a liar
[1:10:39] that's habitually this lying lying lying
[1:10:41] lying lying lying
[1:10:43] and then nobody can tell you tell nobody
[1:10:45] knows what the truth is anymore
[1:10:47] let's go to First John chapter 2.
[1:10:55] first John chapter 2 verses 15 through
[1:10:58] 17.
[1:10:59] so we see
[1:11:01] the love love not the world neither the
[1:11:04] things that are in the world if any man
[1:11:06] love the world the love of the father is
[1:11:08] not in him so we go back to the Rich
[1:11:10] Young Ruler
[1:11:11] he loved the world he loved he loved
[1:11:14] riches more than he loved than when he
[1:11:16] wanted to serve God now I promise you I
[1:11:18] even guarantee you after Jesus left he
[1:11:20] still kept the Commandments he probably
[1:11:21] still did all these good things gave to
[1:11:23] the poor but those things didn't save
[1:11:26] him he he was face to face with eternal
[1:11:29] life
[1:11:30] maybe Jesus is calling you right now
[1:11:32] don't reject it it might be your last
[1:11:36] time I'm not saying it will but you
[1:11:37] never know tomorrow is never promised
[1:11:40] life is but a vapor I'm here I'll be 29
[1:11:43] this year
[1:11:44] been out of high school a decade
[1:11:47] you know a decade flew by
[1:11:50] and don't let your life just pass you by
[1:11:52] without giving all of yourself to Jesus
[1:11:55] Christ I promise you it's beneficial
[1:11:58] it's beneficial
[1:12:00] he'll give you the guidance leadership
[1:12:03] God honors faithfulness
[1:12:05] I prom I could I get a little testimony
[1:12:08] I remember
[1:12:10] almost two years ago I was uh kicked out
[1:12:12] my house for serving the lord and
[1:12:14] believing the message of the hour
[1:12:16] I'd say one thing I didn't turn back I
[1:12:18] kept going
[1:12:19] I kept going see God knows what to do
[1:12:21] how to rough ruffle some feathers
[1:12:22] sometimes to get you out of places and I
[1:12:25] just I just kept my eyes on Jesus Christ
[1:12:27] because I knew the pastor didn't call me
[1:12:30] but Jesus called me personally
[1:12:33] and I didn't have to ride on the pastor
[1:12:36] of the coach my pastor's coattails but
[1:12:38] the very thing that he preached
[1:12:41] I received the word that he preached I
[1:12:43] was receiving it and so anyways
[1:12:46] in that scripture I remember that
[1:12:48] scripture came to
[1:12:50] came to my mind Lord brought it when my
[1:12:52] dad kicked me out of my house how he
[1:12:53] didn't come to bring peace but he came
[1:12:55] to bring a sword said a man that
[1:12:56] variance with the the father or the son
[1:12:58] and that came to me I was like all right
[1:13:01] scripture being fulfilled in my life
[1:13:03] praise God let's go
[1:13:05] and so I kicked dollars over my grandma
[1:13:09] um it was July 4th like two years ago it
[1:13:11] was like July 5th got kicked out and I
[1:13:14] didn't know I wasn't worried I wasn't
[1:13:15] was scared I was looking for places to
[1:13:17] go and then I remember I kind of just
[1:13:19] stopped looking because I couldn't find
[1:13:20] anything and the sister in my church was
[1:13:22] driving by and she found this uh place
[1:13:25] for rent and she talked to the person
[1:13:27] see if it's open I called him and Todd
[1:13:30] his name is Todd and I got an interview
[1:13:32] and the application out he looked at my
[1:13:35] social media and said oh you're a
[1:13:36] Christian huh I was like yeah I was like
[1:13:38] huh he's like oh perfect so anyways I
[1:13:41] think three months goes by and during
[1:13:43] those three months I didn't know how I
[1:13:45] was gonna buy furniture I didn't know
[1:13:47] how I was gonna get a guest bed I didn't
[1:13:49] know how I was gonna get dishes pots and
[1:13:51] pans and I promise you
[1:13:53] like two months before I moved in the
[1:13:57] Lord furnished everything I have neither
[1:13:58] everything guest beds pots and pans
[1:14:02] everything and even to check this out
[1:14:05] like it's a two bedroom
[1:14:06] beautiful place peaceful 750 a month
[1:14:12] I don't even expecting
[1:14:20] and then somebody in my work there these
[1:14:22] two people were chipped in together and
[1:14:23] got me a ninja air fryer brand new
[1:14:26] literally brand new ninja air fryer and
[1:14:29] so just some more of the story
[1:14:31] God honors faithfulness be faithful to
[1:14:34] God he promised your barn is going to
[1:14:36] overflow all these things he promises
[1:14:38] just take God as his word taste and see
[1:14:40] if the Lord taste them see see if he's
[1:14:43] really real
[1:14:44] amen so verse 16 for all that is in the
[1:14:48] world the lust of the flesh the lust of
[1:14:50] the eyes and the pride of life is not of
[1:14:52] the father but is of the world so the
[1:14:54] same That's what Satan used that's his
[1:14:57] tactic that's his blueprint he uses with
[1:14:59] Eve with all of us all throughout the
[1:15:02] ages you can go from Adam all the way
[1:15:04] till now he uses the same thing to get
[1:15:06] you off the track see
[1:15:08] sin is beautiful
[1:15:11] but it's rotten to the core it may feel
[1:15:15] good see the flesh likes to feel good
[1:15:17] the flesh loves entertainment it loves
[1:15:19] to be entertained that's why you see all
[1:15:21] these mega churches not trying to talk
[1:15:22] against the mega churches but all these
[1:15:24] mega churches there's so many people
[1:15:25] because it appeals to the flesh
[1:15:27] entertainment lights smoke fog all these
[1:15:31] things Prosperity messages but God isn't
[1:15:34] isn't trying to give us a Prosperity
[1:15:36] message he wants to give us prosperity
[1:15:38] of the Soul that's what God is looking
[1:15:41] for
[1:15:42] and like I said if you're faithful to
[1:15:43] God he's going to bless you it's simple
[1:15:46] as that young people be faithful learn
[1:15:48] faithfulness because if God gave us his
[1:15:51] best we deserve to give God our best
[1:15:53] every day we can't be taking days off
[1:15:57] can't be taking days off got imagine if
[1:16:00] God took a day off on you how you feel
[1:16:02] maybe a car crash that you protects you
[1:16:04] from you getting a car crash because he
[1:16:06] didn't protect you
[1:16:07] but God he can't take days off he died
[1:16:10] he became you
[1:16:11] so you can become him think about that
[1:16:14] think about that love that was on the
[1:16:15] cross he could say it's finished
[1:16:18] and that finished part was giving you an
[1:16:21] Avenue that you can connect with him
[1:16:22] personally when you're in the hardest
[1:16:25] time the hardest trial of your life you
[1:16:27] can enter into that strong tower enter
[1:16:30] into that secret place he's a present
[1:16:31] help in the present time
[1:16:33] and I could say I've been there many
[1:16:35] times because the enemy knows just
[1:16:37] exactly what to how to just Crush you
[1:16:39] put that pressure
[1:16:41] but we have a place where we can go when
[1:16:43] that pressure comes then like when the
[1:16:45] enemy comes in like a Floodgate God
[1:16:47] raises the standard don't ever forget
[1:16:48] that amen and so in the world passes the
[1:16:52] way so we can get millions and millions
[1:16:53] of dollars we can replace that with God
[1:16:56] but at the end of the day you're gonna
[1:16:57] have to answer the account for that and
[1:17:00] so young people God is going to supply
[1:17:02] your needs Matthew 6 33 but seek ye
[1:17:06] first the kingdom of God and his
[1:17:10] righteousness and all these things will
[1:17:12] be added on to you he knows you need the
[1:17:14] bills paid he knows you need lights he
[1:17:16] knows you need a car he knows you need
[1:17:18] food just seek his face first put him
[1:17:21] first he's going to take care of you he
[1:17:23] promised to take care of you all you
[1:17:25] have to do is seek the perfect will that
[1:17:28] he has for your life he has a purpose
[1:17:30] for all of us you young people he has a
[1:17:32] purpose for your life
[1:17:33] just believe in that purpose
[1:17:36] he's going to lead you through he
[1:17:38] promised to leave he's I'll be with you
[1:17:39] and in you into the end of the world he
[1:17:42] said I won't leave you comfortless
[1:17:44] but you got to receive that comforter
[1:17:47] you got to you got you
[1:17:50] amen
[1:17:52] but in the Garden of Eden the devil
[1:17:54] chose the man's head God his heart now
[1:17:58] the Devil comes into intellectual and
[1:17:59] has brought his religion to the
[1:18:01] intellectual you'll never know God
[1:18:03] intellectually you've got to know him by
[1:18:06] a new birth
[1:18:07] being born again which comes from the
[1:18:09] heart and we see in Ezekiel he said a
[1:18:12] news a new heart I'll give you a heart
[1:18:14] of Flesh he said I'll give you a new
[1:18:15] spirit but a lot of people stop at that
[1:18:18] you got to go on to receive his spirit
[1:18:20] inside of you
[1:18:22] because you can you can be justified and
[1:18:24] Sanctified you could have been an
[1:18:27] alcoholic and God delivers you from that
[1:18:29] but if you never get that field
[1:18:32] then Devil's going to come back even
[1:18:34] with more yes so this sanctification
[1:18:37] isn't enough you gotta go into the
[1:18:38] baptism of the Holy Ghost and be sealed
[1:18:41] unto the day of your Redemption
[1:18:45] amen so the pride of life the lust of
[1:18:48] Flesh what the eye can see but when God
[1:18:50] comes in he gets into a man's heart and
[1:18:53] makes him believe things by faith that
[1:18:56] his eyes cannot see we don't serve God
[1:18:58] by his sight we serve God by his faith
[1:19:01] how many can testify when God was
[1:19:04] leading in Direction you know where he
[1:19:06] was going but you trusted him and he led
[1:19:08] you all the way through so you got to
[1:19:10] trust that God knows what he's doing let
[1:19:12] God be God in your life don't you try to
[1:19:14] be God in your life but let God be God
[1:19:16] in your life
[1:19:18] don't let him just be God in certain
[1:19:20] areas of your life but give him lordship
[1:19:22] over everything in your life because
[1:19:25] there's so many doors in our heart as
[1:19:26] the prophet told us we've got to be
[1:19:28] willing to open those doors you can't
[1:19:30] hide anything from God David tried to
[1:19:33] hide what he did
[1:19:35] in God's sight and look what happened
[1:19:37] when we talk about that we see what
[1:19:38] David did with Bathsheba and he thought
[1:19:40] he can hide it he thought that God
[1:19:42] didn't even know but I can just hide
[1:19:44] this thing I can
[1:19:45] get I can get uh Uriah to go here with
[1:19:49] his wife to make think it's his kid but
[1:19:51] Uriah didn't do that Uriah was faithful
[1:19:54] and then he sent this man to his death
[1:19:57] and and when he did that Nathan and the
[1:19:59] prophet came
[1:20:00] and he told him this little parable
[1:20:02] about this this rich man taking this
[1:20:04] Jeep they was like oh this man should
[1:20:05] die he's like David that was you you're
[1:20:08] the man
[1:20:09] and so just to go back look at the
[1:20:12] consequences the decision that he made
[1:20:15] his kingdom was taken from him his son
[1:20:17] was trying to kill them all because he
[1:20:19] was trying to hide something that lie
[1:20:21] that he tried to do it ruined his whole
[1:20:24] life he was still a man that forgot his
[1:20:25] own heart but his relationship was not
[1:20:27] the same he was running constantly so
[1:20:30] young people don't try to hide anything
[1:20:32] from God you can't this be oh if David
[1:20:35] was open and honest it would be a
[1:20:37] different story
[1:20:39] but he wasn't and he was still he was
[1:20:41] still growing with God and everything
[1:20:43] but he made that one mistake don't think
[1:20:45] when you get filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:20:47] and serving God that you can't make
[1:20:48] mistakes and you're just Untouchable
[1:20:51] you're not you got to repent every day
[1:20:54] it says be zealous therefore and repent
[1:20:56] because he's knocking at that door and
[1:20:59] he's called us to be Overcomers right
[1:21:01] right but it's not necessarily you doing
[1:21:04] the overcoming but is you getting out
[1:21:05] the way and surrendering so the
[1:21:07] Overcomer can overcome inside of you
[1:21:09] you gotta believe if he's called you
[1:21:11] he's predestinated he's called you he's
[1:21:13] equipped you he's equipped you with all
[1:21:16] the tools that you need which is him
[1:21:17] inside of you the god inside of you can
[1:21:19] handle any problem anywhere but you
[1:21:22] gotta let God
[1:21:23] do that we gotta stop trying to be God
[1:21:26] in our lives
[1:21:27] it just gives you stress it gives you
[1:21:29] worry it gives you grief and if you got
[1:21:32] all these things then you can't have
[1:21:34] your your eyes on God we see Peter is
[1:21:36] walking on the water
[1:21:38] as soon as he took his eyes off of
[1:21:39] Christ he began to sing the same thing
[1:21:41] with us as soon as you take your eyes
[1:21:43] off of Christ your life will sink
[1:21:47] we got to keep our eyes on the Creator
[1:21:50] that's where the power is that's where
[1:21:53] Deliverance is that's where peace is
[1:21:55] that's what Revelation is that's all
[1:21:57] these things that we have need of is in
[1:22:00] God but we try to go all these outside
[1:22:01] influences self-help classes
[1:22:04] motivational speaking all these things
[1:22:06] aren't going to help you these things
[1:22:09] are going to pass away
[1:22:10] but what God has given you
[1:22:13] is all you need
[1:22:14] all you need he wants to part the Red
[1:22:17] Sea in your life let him Park the Red
[1:22:18] Sea in your life
[1:22:20] God told Moses go forward speak don't
[1:22:23] cry speak
[1:22:24] amen
[1:22:26] amen
[1:22:27] so a quick look at those scriptures
[1:22:29] involving the Lord Jesus will bring the
[1:22:31] truth of the proposition in Matthew 4
[1:22:33] where Jesus is tempted of the devil he
[1:22:35] overcame personal Temptations of Satan
[1:22:38] by the word and by the word only
[1:22:41] so if you want to stop Temptations at
[1:22:44] right at the root word of God every time
[1:22:47] Amen in these three major trials they
[1:22:50] corresponded exactly to temptation of
[1:22:53] the Garden of Eden the lusts of the
[1:22:55] flesh the lust of the eye and the pride
[1:22:57] of life Jesus overcame by the word
[1:23:01] notice that that's the only way we can
[1:23:03] overcome is by the word
[1:23:06] they overcame by the blood and by the
[1:23:07] word of their testimony love not on
[1:23:10] their lives that love not their lives
[1:23:12] unto death
[1:23:13] amen lust of the flesh lust of the eye
[1:23:16] and the pride of life Jesus overcame by
[1:23:19] the word eve fell to personal Temptation
[1:23:22] Of Satan by failing to use the word Adam
[1:23:25] fell and direct Disobedience to the word
[1:23:28] but Jesus overcame by the word and right
[1:23:31] now let me say this the only way to
[1:23:33] being overcomer
[1:23:34] also is the only way you can know it if
[1:23:37] you're overcoming because the word that
[1:23:39] word Can't Fail notice that
[1:23:41] so the enemy job we said before is to
[1:23:44] try to get you to stop
[1:23:45] we get you to stop and think
[1:23:48] and reason then he has you right then
[1:23:50] and there
[1:23:51] and so the goal of the enemy is to
[1:23:54] destroy you
[1:23:56] but Jesus prayed for you he's giving he
[1:23:59] he gave himself for you so you didn't
[1:24:01] have to be destroyed by the enemy
[1:24:03] because he defeated the enemy don't let
[1:24:05] it defeat it creature defeat you I'ma
[1:24:08] say it again don't let it defeated
[1:24:09] creature defeat you because look in the
[1:24:13] back of the book we win so what do we
[1:24:15] have to fear let's go back to First
[1:24:17] Peter 5.
[1:24:20] finish that up amen
[1:24:23] so we see likewise ye younger submit
[1:24:25] yourselves unto the Elder yay notice
[1:24:27] this all you be subject one to another
[1:24:30] so we got to be subject one to another a
[1:24:33] body of the body of Christ has to be
[1:24:35] able to function together we're not all
[1:24:37] going to like the same things you might
[1:24:39] like basketball might like football you
[1:24:40] might like Miami Heat I might like the
[1:24:43] Lakers but we're not here to agree on
[1:24:45] these things we're here to agree in the
[1:24:46] word of God that's the most important
[1:24:48] thing is to agree in the word of God
[1:24:49] most important thing amen all of you be
[1:24:53] subject one to another nurse and be
[1:24:55] clothed with humility if you want to
[1:24:58] grow with God humility is your best
[1:25:00] friend a humble and contrite spirit and
[1:25:03] no wise will I despise amen humble
[1:25:07] yourselves therefore under the mighty
[1:25:09] hand of God that he may exalt you in due
[1:25:12] time verse 7 casting all your care upon
[1:25:15] him for he careth for you he cares for
[1:25:19] you he even knows when the tears that
[1:25:22] don't make a sound hit the ground
[1:25:24] he knows when he had the worst day of
[1:25:26] your life he knows all these things just
[1:25:29] release it on to him getting your knees
[1:25:31] and just seek him sometimes he ever pray
[1:25:33] you don't know what they even say
[1:25:36] he knows he knows he knows that's right
[1:25:40] amen casting all your care not just some
[1:25:43] of your care cast all your burdens
[1:25:46] be sober be vigilant because your
[1:25:49] adversary the devil as a roaring lion
[1:25:52] walketh about seeking whom he may devout
[1:25:55] so he's looking for he's he's looking
[1:25:57] for the weak he's looking for the ones
[1:26:00] who not trusting in God that's when he
[1:26:03] knows he can devour but he says brother
[1:26:05] Brown said the weakest Christian on his
[1:26:07] knees and the devil tremble think about
[1:26:09] that the weakest Christian on his knee
[1:26:11] so you got to fight your battles on your
[1:26:13] knees stop trying to fight your battles
[1:26:15] here bite them on here neology amen
[1:26:19] says whom resists steadfast in the faith
[1:26:22] knowing that the same afflictions are
[1:26:23] accomplished in your brethren that are
[1:26:25] in the world but the God of all Grace
[1:26:27] with called us unto his eternal no it's
[1:26:29] called us it's called each one of us in
[1:26:32] here all who's lived on a live stream
[1:26:34] he's called you by Christ Jesus after
[1:26:37] you have suffered a while to make you
[1:26:39] perfect so how many has ever been
[1:26:41] through a trial and this feels like the
[1:26:43] worst trial ever
[1:26:45] and you're like man like why am I in
[1:26:46] this trial like why but notice right
[1:26:48] here that you have suffered a while make
[1:26:50] you perfect
[1:26:51] established strengthen and settle you
[1:26:55] that's what these trials are here for
[1:26:56] they're more precious than gold
[1:26:59] you think about each trial you go
[1:27:01] through you complete that's one step
[1:27:03] closer to the rapture that's one step
[1:27:06] closer for your more growth so Paul said
[1:27:09] I glory in my infirmities think about
[1:27:11] that his persecutions because he wasn't
[1:27:14] looking at the trial himself but he was
[1:27:17] looking
[1:27:18] what God's goal was for that trial
[1:27:21] because trials aren't just here just to
[1:27:23] annoy you but they're here for a
[1:27:24] specific purpose
[1:27:26] they help you grow I've seen what the
[1:27:28] statement the devil was so deceived he
[1:27:31] doesn't realize that he's being used to
[1:27:33] point you closer to Christ think about
[1:27:35] that he's being used so you can have a
[1:27:38] closer walk with Christ and he doesn't
[1:27:39] even realize that's how deceived he is
[1:27:41] so he he's you see God had this master
[1:27:44] plan and Satan's falling right into it
[1:27:46] and doesn't even realize it
[1:27:48] Amen to be him be glory and Dominion
[1:27:50] forever amen
[1:27:52] so it's important we'll close here in
[1:27:55] the next couple of minutes it's
[1:27:56] important who you surround yourself with
[1:27:58] young people older people it's important
[1:28:01] who we surround ourselves with the
[1:28:04] friends that you have are either going
[1:28:05] to influence you or you're going to
[1:28:07] influence them it's no in between
[1:28:09] there's no down the middle
[1:28:12] you want to make sure first things first
[1:28:15] who they're serving that's are they
[1:28:17] serving God are they serving that that's
[1:28:18] the first thing you want to know because
[1:28:20] many people can say they serve God but
[1:28:23] the fruit of their life is going to
[1:28:25] really prove they're really serving God
[1:28:28] amen so you don't want somebody who's
[1:28:31] going to make you compromise on your
[1:28:33] beliefs or you're not even make you but
[1:28:35] influence you to even have that idea or
[1:28:38] thought to compromise on your beliefs
[1:28:40] Jim Rohn said this you are the average
[1:28:42] of The Five People You spend the most
[1:28:44] time with think about that
[1:28:47] and this is a quote from Sydney Poitier
[1:28:49] you might remember him he said this
[1:28:51] either he says when you walk with
[1:28:53] someone something unspoken happens
[1:28:56] either you match their Pace or they
[1:28:59] match yours so think about the people
[1:29:01] you're hanging around with are you
[1:29:03] influencing them are they influencing
[1:29:05] you that's the question because it's
[1:29:08] easy to get one another Spirits we don't
[1:29:10] want one another Spirits we want God's
[1:29:12] spirit
[1:29:13] amen so we want the cross it's from 1962
[1:29:17] 1013. we see the influence of another
[1:29:19] brother Brandon preached that so many
[1:29:21] times
[1:29:22] not just by coincidence but for a reason
[1:29:26] because the influence of another is so
[1:29:28] important so I suggest go back and
[1:29:30] listen to some of those
[1:29:32] so we want the cross we want Christ now
[1:29:35] while we can don't be influenced by men
[1:29:38] who may be consent more pores down don't
[1:29:40] be influenced
[1:29:42] with men with a better machine to ride
[1:29:45] in or better home to live in and sell
[1:29:47] your birth rights to Christ don't you do
[1:29:49] it watch what you're doing always follow
[1:29:52] the one who's influenced and is backed
[1:29:55] up by god notice the prophet giving us
[1:29:57] that precious Golden Nugget right there
[1:30:00] always follow those who are influenced
[1:30:03] and is backed up by God and that you
[1:30:05] know where God is with them don't follow
[1:30:07] the wrong influence yes all right let's
[1:30:10] go to Hebrews 12.
[1:30:16] so how many remember the story of Esau
[1:30:19] so he sold his Birthright think about
[1:30:22] that for a bowl of porridge
[1:30:26] and we're going to see
[1:30:28] the Bible talks about them again we'll
[1:30:30] go to verse 16 12 16. unless there be
[1:30:32] any fornicated or profane person as Esau
[1:30:35] who for one more so of meat sold his
[1:30:38] birth I think about that and look look
[1:30:40] what 17 says for you know how that
[1:30:43] afterward when he would have inherited
[1:30:45] the blessing he was rejected for it
[1:30:48] think about no place of repentance
[1:30:51] though he sought for it carefully with
[1:30:54] tears so don't miss the day of your
[1:30:56] visitation
[1:30:58] God has appointed day your visitation
[1:31:00] might be the last time that you've ever
[1:31:01] get that visitation and Esau missed his
[1:31:04] visitation he sold it he sold it for
[1:31:07] fame and fortune
[1:31:09] and then he tried to seek for it he
[1:31:11] tried to sought after it but it was
[1:31:13] closed
[1:31:14] so don't wait and don't say well wait
[1:31:16] till I'm 20 I want to experience the
[1:31:18] world a little bit I want to wait till
[1:31:19] I'm 18 I want to experience the world a
[1:31:20] little bit it might be too late then you
[1:31:23] might have went too far
[1:31:25] too far
[1:31:27] so don't take that chance
[1:31:29] I'm thankful that God gave me I remember
[1:31:31] the year I gave my heart to the Lord I
[1:31:33] remember he was just I just fell in my
[1:31:35] heart if I didn't answer that call it'll
[1:31:37] be the last time you would have called
[1:31:38] me
[1:31:39] so I was like you know Lord I'm gonna do
[1:31:40] the way you want me to do like I'm tired
[1:31:42] of doing it my way it's it's LED this
[1:31:45] this led to everything in my life that's
[1:31:47] going wrong and I get like I said I gave
[1:31:49] my life to him
[1:31:50] everything changed the way I thought
[1:31:53] the music I listened to I was trying to
[1:31:55] take those things away myself let God
[1:31:58] take those things away from you see see
[1:32:00] a lot of times imagine if God came to
[1:32:03] you brother Jack when you first gave
[1:32:04] your heart to him he told you everything
[1:32:05] you had to give up at one time
[1:32:08] imagine how overwhelmed you'll be but
[1:32:10] God knows
[1:32:12] when to say certain things like like my
[1:32:15] son my daughter I want you to give this
[1:32:17] up
[1:32:18] and once you just keep doing that it
[1:32:20] becomes easier and easier easier so let
[1:32:23] God just do what he needs to do
[1:32:26] yes he is he wants to lead and guide you
[1:32:28] into all truth
[1:32:31] amen
[1:32:32] let's go to Second Corinthians 6 14. how
[1:32:35] are we doing on time
[1:32:38] [Laughter]
[1:32:41] amen 6 14.
[1:32:44] it says be not unequally yoked together
[1:32:46] with unbelievers what Fellowship has
[1:32:48] righteousness one in righteousness so
[1:32:50] another our other Prophet Paul talking
[1:32:52] is the importance of not being unevenly
[1:32:54] yoked and I'll never forget just how
[1:32:58] many have lost friends when you give
[1:33:00] your heart to the Lord close friends
[1:33:02] it's a reason because it's a different
[1:33:04] spirit inside of you now in the spirit
[1:33:06] that's inside the other person
[1:33:08] you can't come together it's impossible
[1:33:10] that's why Paul said and he says and
[1:33:13] what Concord has Christ with real or
[1:33:15] what part hath he that believed with an
[1:33:18] Infidel and what agreement hath the
[1:33:20] temple of God with Idols for ye are the
[1:33:22] temple of God
[1:33:24] and he said I will dwell in them and
[1:33:26] walk in them
[1:33:27] and I will be their God I just love how
[1:33:30] God just claims us he said I will be
[1:33:32] their God and they shall be my people
[1:33:34] wherefore come out from among them and
[1:33:36] be separate God is calling us out he
[1:33:39] called us out he's still calling us
[1:33:40] closer
[1:33:41] and we can't let the world creep in
[1:33:44] the world that Satan knows how to just
[1:33:47] creep in
[1:33:48] and your biggest enemy is yourself
[1:33:51] not necessarily Satan Conway Satan can
[1:33:53] use
[1:33:54] this flesh if you yield it to him so you
[1:33:57] got to recognize the biggest enemy the
[1:33:58] race that you're running you're not
[1:34:00] running against brother Jack or you're
[1:34:01] not running against brother Joe but
[1:34:02] you're running against yourself the only
[1:34:04] person is going to stop you from making
[1:34:06] a Rapture is yourself
[1:34:08] so that's why Jesus you got to crucify
[1:34:10] yourself daily that's why that's why I
[1:34:12] get out get out when I wake up in the
[1:34:13] morning first thing I do is trying to
[1:34:15] hit my knees because I know my flesh
[1:34:17] does not want to serve God not one night
[1:34:19] older
[1:34:20] so getting your knees and just say Lord
[1:34:22] what do you want me to do today what is
[1:34:25] your will for my life today and I
[1:34:27] believe he'll tell you that if your
[1:34:28] honest and sincere he'll tell you what
[1:34:30] exactly what he wants you to do I
[1:34:32] believe it amen
[1:34:34] wherefore come out from among them and
[1:34:36] be separate saith the Lord and touch not
[1:34:38] the unclean thing and I will receive you
[1:34:40] I will be a father unto you and he shall
[1:34:43] be my sons and daughters saith the Lord
[1:34:46] Almighty look at that promise if we do
[1:34:48] these things God isn't asked God's hand
[1:34:50] in Simplicity he's not asking do all
[1:34:52] these things and jump on one foot and do
[1:34:55] a backflip he's just asking simply take
[1:34:57] me at your work take me at my word
[1:34:59] surrender to me
[1:35:01] make me Lord of your life not just
[1:35:03] savior but Lord and savior because
[1:35:05] anybody can make him save her Lord save
[1:35:07] me from my sins but I still want to live
[1:35:08] my own life
[1:35:10] but say Lord I'm here for you take my
[1:35:12] heart like brother Jerry was talking
[1:35:13] about Samson Samson gave God strength
[1:35:16] but never his heart
[1:35:18] and that's why he ended up the way he
[1:35:20] did he he didn't have to be that way
[1:35:22] but he gave the wrong he gave not
[1:35:24] everything off of God so don't let any
[1:35:27] don't let any woman or any any boy in
[1:35:29] your life destroy you
[1:35:31] don't do that
[1:35:33] amen
[1:35:35] close oh be conscious here's only one
[1:35:39] thing to be conscious of your your
[1:35:40] littleness you want to get somewhere
[1:35:42] with God make yourself real little
[1:35:46] don't make yourself big like uziah he
[1:35:48] got in there and said I'll do this
[1:35:50] anyhow whether you ain't got no business
[1:35:52] telling me see he should have humbled
[1:35:54] himself young people don't get I I know
[1:35:57] it all spirit
[1:35:59] trust me I had it my dad always always
[1:36:01] had to be right my dad used to always
[1:36:03] tell me boy you always got to be right
[1:36:04] huh always getting Arguments for no
[1:36:06] reason
[1:36:07] so don't thank you everything figured
[1:36:09] out because you don't you don't your
[1:36:11] parents have been around the block a
[1:36:13] couple times
[1:36:14] so this is trust they know what they're
[1:36:15] doing man don't say oh I know I know
[1:36:17] instead of saying I don't say I know
[1:36:18] they say yes sir yes ma'am thank you for
[1:36:21] teaching me this lesson because we
[1:36:23] always get some attitude or roll our
[1:36:25] eyes or pop our lips or something don't
[1:36:26] do that's disrespectful
[1:36:31] God has given your parents for a reason
[1:36:33] and he expects you to respect him
[1:36:34] because if you don't respect them you're
[1:36:36] not respecting God
[1:36:37] God demands reverence and respect and
[1:36:40] how are we treating our parents our
[1:36:42] elders in the church
[1:36:43] adults is going to really show our
[1:36:46] relationship with God it is it's a
[1:36:48] direct reflection relationship with God
[1:36:51] he should have made himself humble the
[1:36:53] Servants of Christ pardon me he never
[1:36:55] took leprosy
[1:36:57] no I know that's your job God called you
[1:36:59] that's your office yeah go ahead and do
[1:37:01] it sirs I'm very sorry backed off there
[1:37:03] had been a different thing written in
[1:37:05] this book but he was corrected and he
[1:37:06] got angry
[1:37:08] you correct people about something or
[1:37:10] tell them about their wrong doing
[1:37:11] they'll leave the church they'll go to
[1:37:13] somebody to to a woman they shouldn't
[1:37:15] wear short hair they'll go somewhere
[1:37:16] they can't wear it so I've been guilty
[1:37:19] that you know somebody may tell you
[1:37:21] something that you did wrong and you may
[1:37:22] not say it outwardly
[1:37:24] but Karen in release even more dangerous
[1:37:27] think about that even in release even
[1:37:29] more dangerous the Bible tells us do all
[1:37:31] things without murmuring and disputing
[1:37:34] because God is looking at the attitude
[1:37:37] your attitude is going to be a direct
[1:37:39] reflection of your walk growing
[1:37:41] God can't do anything with a bad
[1:37:43] attitude see what happened to your
[1:37:44] desire he had leprosy
[1:37:47] just that one decision he made
[1:37:50] no more King and he was leprosy to the
[1:37:53] day he died just based upon that one
[1:37:55] decision
[1:37:57] so you got to really take inventory
[1:38:00] of the thoughts you're thinking the
[1:38:02] decisions you're making see where your
[1:38:04] life is gravitating towards
[1:38:06] because wherever your life is
[1:38:07] gravitating towards you're going to
[1:38:08] prove if you're walking with Christ
[1:38:09] where your desires where your where your
[1:38:12] thoughts where your goals at are going
[1:38:14] to show you where you're going
[1:38:16] because David was a man of
[1:38:18] self-inventory he said search me oh God
[1:38:20] try me there be any wicked way in me
[1:38:24] because we got to realize our heart is
[1:38:25] deceitful only God knows the heart so
[1:38:28] don't say oh I know my heart you don't
[1:38:30] know in your heart the Bible tells us
[1:38:32] that so be open to honest with God every
[1:38:34] day take inventory Lord is there
[1:38:36] anything in my life that I shouldn't be
[1:38:38] holding on to anything in my life that
[1:38:40] is hindering me from walking with you in
[1:38:42] the fullness that you've called me to
[1:38:44] walk in
[1:38:45] if we're that honest that's how growth
[1:38:47] can happen
[1:38:48] we got to be we're coming too close the
[1:38:51] time is at hand we don't have much time
[1:38:53] we got to get right with God every day
[1:38:55] still plant your potatoes but live like
[1:38:57] he's coming today still because you
[1:38:59] never know it could be your last breath
[1:39:01] I could go out here be my last sermon I
[1:39:03] ever preached
[1:39:04] so that's all serious we got to take
[1:39:05] this life
[1:39:07] you see the prophet was taken off the
[1:39:08] scene
[1:39:09] nobody expected that nobody expected
[1:39:12] that
[1:39:13] so don't think it's any different for us
[1:39:15] we'll go to close in James five close
[1:39:28] so reverse or verse 13.
[1:39:31] so it says oh sorry James 4 verse 13.
[1:39:34] go to now you that say today or tomorrow
[1:39:36] we would go into such a city
[1:39:39] and continue there a year and buy and
[1:39:40] sell and get gains sometimes we like to
[1:39:42] plan our lives right down to a T
[1:39:45] and don't even include God in it
[1:39:48] and then then we get we wonder why we're
[1:39:50] all frustrated and flustered when it
[1:39:52] didn't go right
[1:39:54] is that what God wanted is that his will
[1:39:56] or your will
[1:39:57] cause it's a big difference between your
[1:39:58] will and God's will my thoughts are not
[1:40:00] your thoughts and my ways are not your
[1:40:02] ways simple as that
[1:40:04] go to verse 14 whereas you know that
[1:40:06] what should be in the morrow for what is
[1:40:08] your life it's even a vapor I can
[1:40:10] testify that I got gray hair I'm just
[1:40:12] like man where's my like is this is
[1:40:15] crazy how fast life just goes by
[1:40:18] like you you blink in high school goes
[1:40:21] to your almost 30. it's just crazy
[1:40:23] so it's even a vapor that appeared for a
[1:40:25] little time and then vanished it away
[1:40:27] but you ought to say if the Lord will we
[1:40:29] shall live and do this or that but now
[1:40:32] you're rejoicing your boastings all such
[1:40:34] rejoicing is evil therefore it's to him
[1:40:36] that knoweth to do good and do it to him
[1:40:38] and his sin so that's iniquity you
[1:40:41] knowing that you know when to do
[1:40:42] something and not doing it so in closing
[1:40:45] from the stage four let's just make a
[1:40:47] decoration to walk that much more closer
[1:40:49] to the guy every single day don't be
[1:40:51] satisfied I had a good prayer time
[1:40:52] yesterday or last week
[1:40:54] strive for a deeper more sincere and
[1:40:56] more intimate prayer time with God
[1:40:57] that's all God he wants you
[1:41:00] there's he doesn't necessarily want your
[1:41:02] money you can't replace that
[1:41:03] you can't say oh God just take my money
[1:41:05] and I'll just do my own thing because
[1:41:07] obedience is better than sacrifice I can
[1:41:09] sacrifice all day and all night but if
[1:41:11] I'm not doing what God has called me to
[1:41:12] do when we're closing
[1:41:15] so God is not obligated to give you any
[1:41:17] more light if you're not falling in the
[1:41:19] light he's already giving you think
[1:41:21] about that so we want this Revelation
[1:41:23] but are you following what God's already
[1:41:24] calling you to
[1:41:26] just be obedient man obedience is key
[1:41:28] you if you want to if you want to touch
[1:41:30] the heart of God be obedient to him
[1:41:32] simple as that King saw he would have
[1:41:36] his kingdom would have been forever but
[1:41:38] he decided to be disobedient to God
[1:41:40] and that's why David took over
[1:41:42] Amen to young people
[1:41:45] driving don't let the don't let the
[1:41:47] world get in don't let the world
[1:41:49] tempt you
[1:41:51] with its death because it may it may
[1:41:54] sound good it may be good may be good
[1:41:56] but it's not good it's not gonna be
[1:41:59] worth it I promise I can I can testify
[1:42:01] that person
[1:42:03] praise God I would like to write our
[1:42:05] precious brother jack up
[1:42:16] [Applause]
[1:42:25] amen
[1:42:27] we certainly appreciate uh the Lord to
[1:42:31] speaking to us there through
[1:42:34] brother brother Mark Cosby uh
[1:42:37] just a lot of nutrients I believe that
[1:42:40] was there in the uh in in the sermon and
[1:42:44] I think something that's very very
[1:42:46] helpful uh for not just the young people
[1:42:49] but for all of us amen so much so much
[1:42:52] that was said there and um
[1:42:55] I um I'm grateful I'm very grateful
[1:42:58] sometimes you get a chance to sit back
[1:43:00] and just look and see what God is doing
[1:43:03] in the next Generation
[1:43:05] Um it uh puts a big smile on your face
[1:43:08] you know somebody's holding on
[1:43:10] somebody's uh trying to do something
[1:43:12] just to kind of help their fellow man
[1:43:14] along the way and um and it's just you
[1:43:17] know just a blessing it's a real
[1:43:20] blessing so young people I hope y'all
[1:43:22] all taking something uh tonight amen and
[1:43:26] and
[1:43:27] um me I brought my notepad so I can just
[1:43:30] go back and look at some of the notes
[1:43:31] that I wrote but it was uh it was
[1:43:34] refreshing very very respect refreshing
[1:43:37] brother Mark we appreciate you
[1:43:39] and man the battle of the Mind
[1:43:44] my mind he was talking about that rich
[1:43:46] young ruler and you know and what he had
[1:43:48] to do was give up his uh give it riches
[1:43:53] but you have to ask this Chef the
[1:43:55] question tonight what is God asking you
[1:43:57] to give up
[1:43:58] and remember uh with the Rich Young
[1:44:00] Ruler it was only one thing
[1:44:03] only one thing that kept him from
[1:44:05] receiving eternal life so you have to
[1:44:08] ask yourself a question what is it that
[1:44:10] God is asking you to give up a man in
[1:44:13] your life and then I loved I love the
[1:44:16] the other statement he made about when
[1:44:18] you come to Christ it's not him telling
[1:44:21] you all these don't do this don't do
[1:44:22] don't don't don't don't don't don't
[1:44:23] don't don't I mean because everybody you
[1:44:26] know we when we we try to just pour all
[1:44:28] that on people as soon as they come to
[1:44:29] Christ just stop this stop just stop
[1:44:31] that let God take it from you
[1:44:36] because when God take it from you you
[1:44:38] won't go back to it
[1:44:40] Hallelujah when God takes it from you
[1:44:43] you won't go back to it Hallelujah so
[1:44:47] you just be obedient to the first step
[1:44:49] amen and just surrendering yourself out
[1:44:52] to him and um as he was talking his
[1:44:55] personal testimony of just being in a
[1:44:57] car and and
[1:44:59] um having a a moment where he just told
[1:45:03] God I just need you to take control of
[1:45:05] my life uh it took me back in my own
[1:45:08] mind as to uh just you know when I when
[1:45:11] I gave my heart to the Lord this one in
[1:45:14] church I was
[1:45:15] parking lot somewhere if some grocery
[1:45:17] store working that night and um I
[1:45:20] remember a elderly lady that must have
[1:45:21] been in the 80s that come to me and say
[1:45:23] son you ain't gotta wait till you get to
[1:45:25] church to give your heart to Jesus you
[1:45:27] can do it right here in this parking lot
[1:45:28] and she said you ready I say no ma'am
[1:45:31] I'm not ready
[1:45:32] but she planted a seed and that night I
[1:45:36] could not get away from what that lady
[1:45:37] said to me and uh and because that seed
[1:45:40] that she planted I went back out there
[1:45:42] act like I had to get some carts and one
[1:45:44] little carts in that parking lot but I
[1:45:46] act like I had to get a few of them I
[1:45:48] was going out to talk to my God
[1:45:50] I'll never forget the spot I'll never
[1:45:52] forget the place I'll never forget the
[1:45:54] moment but it was a moment where I came
[1:45:57] under complete surrender to the Lord now
[1:46:00] did I have trials after that I sure did
[1:46:02] and I still got them today but I'm still
[1:46:04] determined to serve God in the midst of
[1:46:07] all my trials everybody gonna go through
[1:46:09] something whether you saved or not saved
[1:46:12] you're still gonna go through something
[1:46:13] I'd just rather go through with God than
[1:46:17] going through without them
