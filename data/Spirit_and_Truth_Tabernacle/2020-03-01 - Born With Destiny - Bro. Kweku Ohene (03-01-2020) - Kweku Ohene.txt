brotherbrother short just on drop of the dime just step right in from Wednesday night and and I mean I heard the service was a blessing [Music] [Applause] blessing this captivating appreciated brother Troy man thank God for that and I understand Friday night brother Jerry Amen was also a blessing to the church though Jerry thank you so much and you know it means a lot to have help it means an awful lot you know you got trying to carry the load yourself and you know so when you have moments like this is good that you got dependable brothers a man that can step in and really be a blessing to the church we're very very thankful for that and and you know on Tuesday night hours as I was feeling the way I was feeling that reached out to brother quick who and I said well if you don't mind just being ready for Sunday I would really appreciate it you know I said I just don't want to overexert myself or just you know just just rest that's what I want to try to do it I know it has some things on my schedule you all heard about brother John la Fontaine passed away they did his memorial service on Friday pass and so I flew up to be a part of a man of that memorial service and we went in on supposed to go in on Thursday night but our flight got all messed up so we didn't get there to Friday right before a couple hours before the memorial service we got there did that and then we turned around yesterday and came back home so it was a whirlwind trip for us but we you know nonetheless it was a blessing us to be there a man and just support the family during their time of their loss just a la Fontaine's very very special everybody remembers something from the Laughing song and everywhere he went he just did that man y'all remember that one the joy of the Lord is livestream the joy is my street the joy of the Lord is my strength the joy of the Lord is mustering if you don't have those for you to laugh for it if you don't have that joy you ought to laugh for it the joy of the Lord is my speak and he did you think [Music] haha [Music] praise the Lord survive anybody got that joy this morning he used to sing that everywhere he went and and he just gave a choir of young young young children in the neighborhood and just y'all just start laughing with me he just laughs uncontrollably they had a little video they was showing how the kids just looking at him like he laughing like that and the kid just busts out laughing laughing at him you know but it was just you know just he had a way of impacting so many people and no just just through his impact his family has grown to impact the world with their ministry and God's good god is good God is good and God is God is good I'm just you know grateful that we had an opportunity just to be there with brother Paul and the rest of them and all of them talking about making a trip here in South Florida talking about sound sometimes talk about staying for weeks you know so I'm like okay praise the Lord Oh get it all figured out but you know this is a place to be specially Doorly during the winter months man it was so all over the place it was so cold I just couldn't understand how people of people could understand but but you know I guess when brothers say some people call to these places they got to go chase mission feels real I understand the Lord's call some some places call others other places on my circle it's long but we show thank God amen thank God I want to give you all a quick update on the building fund and [Music] you just get that light switch there for me just really really quickly here I didn't give you all I guess a date last month I think I just briefly told you that January we received two thousand eight hundred fifty three dollars and eighty seven and then February the Lord blessed us to receive $2,800 11 sin may man soul thus far a man Justin what's been given this five thousand six hundred fifty three dollars and ninety one safer this year amen five thousand [Applause] [Music] and we also have received an interest on hundred ninety two dollars eleven cents for this year so giving us a grand total the five thousand eight hundred forty six dollars and two seven and five eight five thousand eight hundred forty six dollars the other forty six dollars and two cents so I'm grateful for math so what law is doing they you can turn it on thank you brother Steven you know while I was there and in Toledo you know the the la Fontaine's Dave Dave going through a lot been going through my brother Paul and sister Rebecca have their very first grandchild I won't say December 31st of leave the the baby was born and so the baby born and then a we're at first papa la fontaine goes into the hospital and then when you know they dedicated the baby I think on January 20 1919 to dedicated the baby and then January 20th the Lord kome dad home and it's just been a a wave of emotions and there's so many things have been going through during this seat but God has a way of encouraging when you're going through to let you know he's still with you he promise never to leave you nor forsake you and one of the big things that the Lord did even during the season God has blessed him with a new church I had a chance to go by and see the building on yesterday and you know I walked inside and saying oh my oh this is nice it went through another door and opened up and it was a big fellowship hall I say thanks kitchen and everything as it ran that's nice then he took me through another door it was an the sanctuary I say Lord Jesus I mean I was just blown away by what God did you know and I just as I looked at but I didn't get jealous I rejoiced begin to thank God for less than my precious brother Nasir especially during the season with them going through so much but my faith got ignited say Lord I know you got some and when I looked at that I say now this is what I call exceeding oh we can ask a thing all right that's the type of lesson that I saw there in a sec or I thought you ain't got much just saving the planet just to be saving money that's not what this is all the time we didn't really walk into some you know I'm just we just gonna wait on God we don't kinky keep calling it here hey man keep speaking the Scriptures over it is amen you know I mean he say I rejoice o you do you do it hey plant you so you know you know he wants to plant enough Senate place right he go he don't rejoice all this - it's good give us something right so I'm under expectation and and I'm looking for God to do some some miraculous things [Music] a lot of churches out there God has done it for them so I'm just on the expectation for what you're gonna do for us soon and they a man a man a man you ain't in the right time to be a part of this miracle we all will be all in at the right time to be a part of this miracle a man I believe that I want to read a scripture before we call her the queen qu l get me Esther chapter four as we were just speaking in the dispensing that I don't even know how many years it's been now but typically we take as a church and what I like to call a corporate fast with us where everybody in the church gets involved in doing something as far as fasting for the next 21 days and we've been doing the Daniel Fast which is a just you can eat but you modify what you eat you actually don't eat it sweets no meat it's just more of vegetables and whole grains and things like that sister Erica can give you a lot more detail than I can on that but uh but it's it's kind of what Daniel and the Hebrew boys did you know they just ate a lot of pulse which was vegetables during that time for 21 days you know that they they didn't know if the toriel days but they did it for seven days but Daniel is waiting 21 days on a prayer to be answered so they they kind of to put them two together called the Daniel fast so I don't require that everybody do the Daniel fast if you want to do fasting the way that you fast that's fine you know there's something that might not be able to fast because of a health condition that's understandable I was telling my wife the waiter with the way she's feeling I didn't want her to try to take on a fast you know like that do something something else a little to find a different fast to do don't don't don't change too much when you when you're going through this much of your body don't do that and if anybody else is going through it what I know she's going through please use wisdom amen and what you're doing but just try to find something and technology is certainly something you can fast right technology if you're a TV watcher you can fast TV [Music] praise the Lord if you're a basketball you know March Madness person you go you're gonna get mad watch your basketball hey man get mad and get glance alright but whatever fine and I'd like to call it corporate because we all should fast individually everybody should do that that should be a normal part of the Christian routine to fast and pray that's no but we do corporately and that means everybody get involved in this scripture NESTA's where everybody got involved in a fast this is Esther chapter 4 and verse 10 [Music] and again as the speaking to talk and gave him commandment unto Mordecai all the king's servants people of the king's provinces do know that was that whosoever whether man and woman shall come unto the king into the inner court who is not called there who's my call there is one law of his to put him to death except such to whom the King shall hold out the golden scepter that he may live but I have not been called to come into the King these thirty days and they told to Mordecai Esther's words the Mordecai commanded to answer as to think not with thyself that thou shall escape in the king's house because there was an edict etic going out that they were going to destroy all the Jews and even though essa was in the king's court our acquaintance in the house she was still Jew and the law said she would have to die here it is think not with ourselves that thou shalt escape in the king's house more than all the Jews but if thou altogether holdest that peace at this time then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place but thou in thy father's house the but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed and who north whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this I love that then as the being then returned Mordechai disaster go gather together all the Jews and a president shushing and fast be for me and neither eat nor drink three days night no night or day I also my man fast likewise in the soul will I go in unto the king which is not according to the law and if I perish I perish so Mordechai went his way and did according to all that and that commanded him and what it was was a corporate fast but all of them got involved they had a need they had a need they were about to lose their lives amen and everybody had to get involved on this before fun for an ester to go before the king God gave a favour and the Jews were delivered during that time we may not be in a situation where we're going to lose our lives but we all have needs all have needs I want to see I want to see restoration I won't see deliverance I want to see freedom hey man I want to see God do some things and a magnet and I believe through fasting a pretty well seat and I wanna I'm watching the devil just slowly but surely slowly but surely I want to see God put a stop to the Devils Tracy I'm looking for God to do something I believe it started I believe something started here last week Amen I believe that you know it's we going into springtime typically in spring they have what they call spring cleaning holy goes did some spring cleaning with this brings along now you can do something with us right so so church we're entering into this time of fasting and prayer and we're just asking everybody as a church everybody get involved everybody get involved in some way somehow just these next 21 days and we're not telling you exactly how to do it however the Lord leads you to do it Amen we encourage you to do it but we want you to be involved as a men as a church in its time of fasting and prayer I will see God move will see God move will see God move let's stand to our feet quick who's gonna come and speak to our hearts and a man and I was just telling him in the office I'm so grateful that God has sent him to this church amen in this season such a time as this I'm very grateful Florida not only has God heard our prayer and sending help but God's raised enough to help right here in this church and I'm just I'm just so grateful and there's more to come there's more to come amen but let's sing this song in the presence of Jehovah amen as we welcome my brother to the full pin on this morning I know the Lord has something special in store for us [Music] in the presence of Jehovah Oh [Music] Oh [Music]

returned from school I said I was going to sleep a little bit and I just blacked out so when I woke up it was 8 o'clock and the first thought came to my mind very strong born with destiny and I said oh so I quickly wrote in my prayer book so what is this born with destiny and I remembered I had to preach us a lot is it a title of the 7 if it's it then make it magnify it show me more reveal it to me born with destiny it came to my mind yes we are bothered with purpose so destiny for eternal purpose of God so you are born with a destiny you are here with a destiny amen and without making much I do want to read a scripture Romans chapter 8 verse 22 31 if you can give us the King James Bible study is a new king james i wonder King James so the particular thou and they do so well my the other Bibles so give me been rejected if you want to reach read for us praise God Romans 8:28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us [Music] praise be to God amen if God be for you who can be against you in man shall we take our seat blessed be the name of the Lord so born with a destiny and what you've got gives you something and there's no scripture for it than that I don't think that it's from God but if you can't find in the scripture then you can be assured of it amen the promise that does we'll find my message God give me a thought and I go

we can't believe something just fifty years ago amen two thousand four thousand years ago we can't read The Book of Isaiah we can't believe Jesus Christ of Nazareth but we can believe Jesus Christ in the present tense we can't go back 2,000 years and believe years every Christian every normal nominal Christian even for my person can believe Jesus died on a cross but we can't believe that Jesus Christ came and manifest himself in a son of man we can't believe that Jesus Christ is in us he's the same yesterday today and forever more he may praise be to God never go back to my cell phone so now let's read something more is it as they said the serene church age is 1954 five four zero five one two paragraph two to one do you realize that you represent a star in heaven and every star in heaven represents you did you know God told Abraham that his seed would be like the stars of the heaven first they were the dust of the earth and then in the resurrection they were the stars of heaven innamorato did you realize that did you know that Jesus was that was a bright and Morning Star the greatest star of all the stars of heaven Oh hallelujah when I think of it my soul leaps for joy there he is there in Islam in his likeness in his presence we shall visited some day hallelujah when the things of this earth this earth has passed away Amen when you realize the resurrection not just resurrection 2000 years ago but when you reserved from your ashes when it was read from denomination when you read from the old person when that person you dies and Christ and you come scene take on true they see the new take on true then that is your real resurrection amen resurrection 2000 years ago was good it was historical that will give birth to your destiny now the new way that you live now amen and if you don't have the Holy Ghost baptism the new birth then your destiny has not released study then you are not fulfilling your destiny then you are under the captivity of the devil he's the one who rules your heart amen you can be in a church that are not to blow around you but if it doesn't kill the old person then you go outside a church and you can live the life that you had in a church but when that old man dies or old man dies and Christ Jesus himself resurrecting you then you are a new creation then you are a new person you are not the same old man again amen you are now who say God says ayah but a brass someone helped me how did he say the song I am who said God says I will wrestle America me find him how do you say I am I am who God says I am amen then you become I am who God says you are amen so let's go to Jesus Christ he was born for a purpose on earth let's read from the message of a Jireh Jawara paragraph 140 just to lay a little background before you going [Applause] let's read leverage a bit from paragraph 1 139 so now not in December as a Roman Church put it the Sun God's birthday put it with with his up on the 25th of the same body means Jesus wasn't born on 25th LEM skip it wouldn't have been born on December 25th why it is no bound mountains of the in Judea he was born like all lamps ah he was born in springtime and we are almost in spring and he has to be born under the RAM because he was around and a Ramos April exactly he was born under the RAM that is what he was he was goes around that was him up there that took Isaac's place amen do you see 1:41 there is he show here plainly the Roya see bride will not be caught by the she church the new nation she could sacrifice no but by him the manifested world of the round for his the world and the RAM then not caught he said not caught by her name but caught by his name a church without a head is a human church amen a church without Christ is just women because one is a church but if there's no hair there's no man to rule the church to control the church to prune the church to direct the church to be the king of the church to establish the church that is just one's name amen there's not Christ in the church they can clean Christ but is not Christ and I'm talking about individual amen we are a church if you claim to be a Christian you cannot femine a book when they ask you your religion what good some job or ask what religion religion you belong to or school I'm a Christian but if Christ is funny the French which is the woman then you are in the man's covenant you have a reason to the man's covenant amen so Jesus was as was a ram of God that was born for a purpose he had a destiny so forth destiny be born in April it wouldn't be won in any month he was ordained to be born as a tribe line of the tribe of Judah and it was around to be sacrificed for the world and for this purpose he has to come in April that's why they couldn't let him be born in in the e in the in is like a hotel or like a motel 6 some hotel when they wanted to go and lodge but God ordained him to be born among the RAM among the Sheep so God Himself put blacks in Mary and Joseph sweet they went to this Motel 6 they said no we can't let you guys in they want to motivate no if you want to pay even twice the price no way we don't want you here they went to a lot of plays no no we don't want you guys here because the Lord was little Mary and Joseph so that Jesus will be born as a ram emotion for your destiny and so certain things that you go through got a black you here you black you this way you move you here just leading you to the right place amen we are blessed reading them in the scriptures but when it was going going on they couldn't read in a screw so it was a trial it was a present a trial before Joseph and Mary why they have money to pay for it for the police why would they not accept it why were they not allowed in the inn because Jesus has to be born among sheep because he was around praise be to God amen glory hallelujah glory to God every one of us work was born under a certain month every Son of God every human being was born among one of the twelve month and I'm going to go through the month to see certain scriptures that God position for you and I to help you know your destiny Amen praise be to God glory now let's start from a blessed be the name of the Lord can I do you man the Lord is good it will help you to find your destiny your purpose on earth so that you can step as a son or daughter of God under your feet to circumstances under your feet no matter how they are amen two quarters into situation to spit into assistance amen because you are born with a destiny as we read from Romans 8 the destiny is actually from predestination sorry destinies from a destination you are destined to arrive at some way now when you go back behind out what is predestination preemies before so before the destiny you have been ordained free ordained to arrive in Miami to arrive in West Palm Beach to arrive in wherever you have been ordered to go so that is your destiny but now between your predestination and the destiny you have to go through certain processes and that's what got a jack read for us you have to be justified you have to be called and justified and sanctified and then glorified for the destination that it wouldn't be amen so before the foundation of the world a lot called your name called you by your name you gotta read some scriptures he knows you specifically sister he knows you he put to their family he put you in a certain tribe in a certain location he put your accessories for you to be born when you were born the Lord put your ancestries we go back behind the generations put your ancestry in certain way so that you'll be born on a particular time to receive the weight that God has ordained for you to receive amen glory hallelujah amen if maybe you have one in the White House you didn't come near the weight but we are born as a team for family not in maybe in a minute not even a marriage but God or tendency God is not looking at the picture of your wedding what is looking at is seeding you a man what is not looking at your fault Amen this we cannot see a man when he went to the well in Samaria this was a wonder those who she was despite she could even go among the young girls who were virgins - well fetch water she was an outcast but it says seed that was his seed inhale and Jesus was looking directly at the seed not that not a caricature not a shack in the shack that was a seed so you wanted to bring this it out and everything we take his pleas and so when the word caught the word the seeds come out and all the seven husbands they were done away with the success banner and you've got married to Jesus Christ the Son of God amen all your cents or your combinations God has a look at it is looking at this seed that is placing you and when you accept their way when you get obedient to their word and the word captivate your heart then the word trans from your heart and all that shock and not the atmosphere come under the suggestion of the way glory hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord amen glory to God so now we're going to start with a I am Aries Jesus was born in Aries which is April much improved there about actually if I remember exactly but ROM give at this that Jesus was born in December 12 if I remember there was one goods if you bring it to our time it will disable when Jesus was born of Ramos Bonnie sorry April 12 forgive me but I was born in April and sexy and Christ was born in April the 12 amen they were all under the sign of Iran when Jesus was born Trista's cross because there was a gift of God divine healing on to the eighth a Cecilia when he was born the devil knew this guy was Assyria because of him they killed thousands of children just to make sure that by statistics they could get rid of Jesus but in love the Lord took Mary and Joseph take the child and send it to Egypt when highly until I tell you so Jesus was peacefully kept in Egypt when they were slaughtering young boys in Judea amen so goddess L suppose for your life nothing can touch you because of their purpose because of the destiny that is encompassing your life that is enclosing you no demon can take your life no sickness can terminate your life because you have a destiny on this earth to fulfill blessed be the name of the Lord so after that Jesus was brought back to fulfill his destiny he was around and let's read a Exodus chapter 30 Exodus 3:14 Exodus 3:14 and God said unto Moses Moses was called by God and he wanted to find out everybody has got a name so if you send me to grant a brother jack tells me to go go run run an errand for him I have to get his name after knew his name so that I can go enter but I Kenny never a jack says well sue but if I don't know his name how about with you for for the commissioning so God called Moses said go to my people go to Pharaoh and tell him to loosen my people let my people go so he said lord if they ask me if he asked me what is your name what should I see it certain I am that I am wow you are who you are what kind of limits this you should have a name Moses was Martino garrison name but it wasn't a for the Lord to review so he just said that I am that I am he that created heaven and earth he that put bread in Pharaoh tell him that I am that I am sent you so he said and he say and God said unto Moses I am that I am and he said thou shalt thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel I am hath sent me unto you amen so but a jacket is sent himself Here I am send him on to you Amen God ordained your posture for you amen if I remember that Solomon probably last year he was sick if I remember he said he'd even to the family and he didn't want his wife to worry didn't want children to worry but he was going through some sickness issue and will move himself to come to church on Sunday he went to brother Jack's office said the moment he touched me pray for me the sickness would vanished amen I am that I am has sent you if you receive that one God has sent to you if you want to do the will of the Lord then we receive he who has sent unto you Amen if you reject he who he sent to you you have a refine difficult times on this earth but you receive His Word from the Hamas 7 of God the way is going to lead you into prosperity and blessing glory hallelujah Jonah so under I am John chapter 8 verse 24 I said the phone to you that ye shall die in your sins for except you believe that I am he he shall die in your sins so Jesus was when was on earth he was also used I am except you believe in me that I am the god of Moses I am Jehovah the same Jehovah has put on a skin you die in your sins because the people could not believe with your intellectual how can you tell us that way you annoy be fifty years old that you tell us before Abraham your way and let me say where you are what kind of what kind of language are you speaking this is not for my English if you send you away probably God we can try to find our correct but you said you are you are not fifty years old you've got a demon because they are reason from here that everyone know enter your mind and he's speaking from his heart amen light and darkness they don't be together amen glory hallelujah but he said I am and just a we didn't preach I am I am the son of God I am the son of David I am the son of man let's read let's read that is I am I use certain examples for you now in the olden days certain cities named their cities the fence before God roots that is the one God Himself root was the zodiac it wasn't a Bible that a man can tamper with it you can revise that Bible is what God made a man and the zodia is that is the universe is the Stars the moon the Sun the Sun represented Christ the Son of God su and s when the moon is the wife of Jesus Christ and all the stars as we read represents us and daughters of God in the various manifestation remember Jack was in a Hawkinson brothers live in a cold country it's comfortable here in West Palm Beach when everything's all green beautiful godliness different ways somebody can live in a good country Canada there's any place in Canada is so called Russia you want a hug they live over there some people can also live how do you live in the heat in Florida in such a steal how do you do that so God ordained each and every one in various manifestation to manifest himself amen I am that I am amen so God was a ram born in April as a savior to bleed to blood and lamps and don't they don't their life is making their life easily they are sacrificial animals they use them to sacrifice so Jesus as a sacrifice or their power to even called angels or speak for the world to even move out of existence to destroy those who came to crucify him but because it was around he willingly gave His life that you if I die you and I will have a place in the kingdom of God glory hallelujah amen so he called you by your name Amen he didn't call you by your good works you conned you and perfected you he called you and qualified you didn't call it because you qualified by you called you and I and qualified as as sons and daughters of God amen by the old faith none of us could claim sonship of God or in total shape of God but by the new bed by grits and predestination he wash all your sins he consumed the old person and Christ himself took over his house renovated the house watch all the census records diseases watch diabetes watch a cancer watch politician watch drunkenness or abortion watch crime watch criminal spirits consume all of them so that means of can't dwell in this Tabernacle to manifest himself amen blessed be the name of the Lord so for the round that is a sacrifice now let's go to another house Taurus Taurus is another means I have every Smith I am Taurus is I have let's read a scripture john 6:66 t 8 john 16 then Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom shall we go thou hast the words of eternal life I have Jesus had a waist of eternal life to give so Peter saw that we've been with this high priest for long the hours are just denominational ways we have been sacrificing lambs and bulls we don't see no supernatural we don't see divine healing but we saw this young man Jesus of Nazareth do the column demon they are the customer from among themselves but he lay her something when they are healed the West that come from his heart is healing to my heart how am I going to desert this man and go away go back to my old Pharisee church or go to the Sadducees who are full of crime hypocrisy I'm not going to go back our stick with Jesus do an honest adronis not all his weight though his words are mr. Collier mysterious but I could see Jehovah God in him man I'm gonna stick with him glory hallelujah now to loose a I have let's read a Jeremiah 29:11 to 13 11 for I know their thoughts that I think toward you I want to put in my way I know the thought that I have for you their thought not just thinking but I have is real substance for you says the Lord thought of peace and not of evil to give you an expert an end then shall ye call upon me and he shall go and pray unto me and now he came unto you and ye shall seek me and find me Anisha says for me with all your heart amen if you seek the Lord with all your heart you find him amen because it have you already in his hands you are not anywhere even in your sinful condition when we were running around when you didn't know nothing about godliness you were solely in the palm of his hands his love covered you he said an angel around you you could have been dead HIV could have killed you Karuna my virus would have infected you and have died of tuberculosis drowned adaboost live and they don't wake up but I am that I am amen covered around you because of the seed not because of your anything that you did but he was another seed in your heart and appointed time because he was good toward quitting the seat at the right time so when the right time came the way it touched away and there was a manifestation of a man glory be to the Lord amen I have now let's go to another house Sagittarius Sagittarius means I know amen Jeremiah 1:5 before I found thee in the belly I knew you and before the hour cometh out of the womb I sanctified thee and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations amen how many prophet priest kings queens wife of Jesus Christ I hear amen we are fed we are keys so properties Jeremiah Abraham yes we are prophet - you have a spell of Christ in you prophetess amen you have the Holy Ghost baptism in you my king amen you ran with Christ you ran in you he's living in your tabernacle you are missing Jesus Christ we are through the devil's wedding ring away and we'll be married to the Son of God Barham said I think not invisible Union invisible Union said the old Pilgrim Fathers they were thankful of the a new way of life because the way they came upon that English denomination and they were married to the new land the new message for the ADI so shall we be thankful to the Lord for the new anointed way for our day so when you are anointed with the word when we are married with the word we become the wife of Jesus Christ in a holy union with him amen the only cool squeaking you you have become mrs. Jesus Christ how do you become that because your flesh is the temple of Jesus Christ your flesh is the wife that run errands for Jesus Christ yo your flesh is the one that prepare food for Jesus Christ if Jesus want to preach he has to use their flesh over that better better a better job amen if you just want to testify at a web please he has to use the flesh of sistar sistar Brown yes use the flesh of sister Sarah just a base and all of you sisters amen the pricing you is the one that shines outwardly to see Amen is not your money it's not your beauty it's not how handsome you are it's not the clothes that you weigh but I said Christ in you your husband you he manifests himself outwardly for people to see that as a glory divine heavenly glory in your heart blessed be the name of the Lord I know Isaiah chapter 43 1 I know sagittario's but I but now that says the Lord that created thee O Jacob and he that from thee O Israel fear not for our freedom thee I have called thee by thy name thou art mine amen encoded by your name and you are his he knows you he knows your name he knows your circumstances and we go to an another house where he feels your conditions amen let's go to a another house and a little yak which is cancer because autumn I just want to run it through quickly and I will break it down cancer means I feel we will talk about it individually when we finish to talk about it dispositional cancer is a cross fish let's let's go to individual face amen so that don't get sidetracked it I feel Hebrews chapter 4 verse 15 for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities in other ways we have a high priest which can be touched with the feeling of our families they are put in a negative form two negatives make post positive so by the bad was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin so we have a high priest which we can trash by the oh who can touches by the feeling of your infirmities when you are sick if you he lives in you you know you are sick it's not time for him to take you away he's not going to let enemy that spirit of Delta Q are we has healed you already his Brizzy of faith to know that he lives in you he's taking care of all the sickness and all that trouble circumstances in their family in the jobless in school in a church wherever it might be he has already taken care of it Amen because he feels your infirmity glory hallelujah John eleventh John 11 33 to 36 when Jesus therefore saw her with him this was the death of Lazarus and the Jews also within which came to with her he groaned in the spirit and was troubled and said where have you led him they said unto Him Lord come and see jesus wept that was the only place if I remembers recorded that Jesus wept because it can be touched by the feeling of your infirmity then the Jews then said the Jews behold how he loved him even the Jews saw that he really loved Lazarus Mary and Martha because when he went they he wept as a human being he felt what Mary and Martha were going through the only brother maybe he was in the olden days is not like a time that women can work on their own if you have a parent the father died men you can even her even in America in about maybe 200 plus years ago if the father or husband died they should be a man to take off the family land or whatever because women cannot inherit you should have a husband or brother cousin somebody a near kinsman to take over the family affairs so Marian mother had the only brother perhaps and death has taken dear brother we they were mourning they were not going to see their brother because my mother had a revelation say Lord we know in the resurrection I will see but he didn't at the resurrection was standing right before him before her he said I am the resurrection and life if you believe in me you see the glory of God I am the life in the resurrection because the resurrection is not an event is a person that bring manifestation of Christ so he wept but then he came from the human side and then now he spoke he said Lazarus come from the grief because that was I am that I am yes we also do with but less most average prett let's not stain the weepies bench for too long come from there the Montes bench amen and wash yourself clean your face and now put on your clothes get your mantle it's because of Jesus Christ the man that Lord I'm your daughter you live in me I am mrs.

pressure apples away you can take your diabetic foods away it's your promise it's a benefit of eternal life God gave it to you because we did our half as well to be able to serve Him to manifest him I can't be treated if I'm sick on my bed so we need all their blessing Silesia and Teresa it's all embodied in you and the more you listen to the inner man the more you listen to the Holy Ghost in you so that the Holy Ghost will come from the pasta so I come from your brother sometimes come from within you sometimes through a sign you might be going through some situation and you see something and sign and he's speaking to you one time I was going through a situation I was in London I went to Ghana I was a military hospital working not working I was doing internship and then they were driven from the internship I said I came from London all the way to gun and they redefine the internship I'm going to the pharmacy Council and I saw a vehicle written that said real now the third puh and I saw right away I call it awareness okay I'll go I was I was working on my change so I said I'm good to is even giving more time so I use the two E's exactly two is they call me back and restore me to the internship death in real I know the Lord was speaking to me so it was it was on a vehicle so you have to open your eyes I said son of God if you can't get sensitive to the Holy Ghost because we are born for a destiny with for eternal purpose a lot of the problems to be done I would be silent and listen to the Annamma the lost speak from within out to you to us but many a times we don't listen many times what we hear here is good even what you hear from the pulpit when you go back when digested again when think tank or even blessed with a technology we can listen to sermons you know what are you rooted or not you can go and listen to it backward but I preach but a job preach and not absorb it in your hands and your hard to build your your your chest was swell would revolution business Christ because when trials comes it's not your power is the revelation of Christ in you that will become their trials is a revelation you now bring victory in your situation so the more you practice revelation in you the more they would understand Jesus was not a big magic giant who was able to fight the devil no you just about it was fasting all the time so he wasn't he was skinny person he didn't have too much flesh on him because my pattern your brain was on him but the authority there praise the fasten the word the revelation was in him so when the devil comes demons are attack him yes God Allah redeem us to attack him they tell you a devil you are you are even notice that a demon you are Beelzebub visible means king of all the devils look at the devil challenges us is a devil that's how the monster the most won't be exposed so they point to that you you you are the devil you are the one that troublemaker one time Elijah Kin Kin Kin and this was husband wasn't in a hub he was I mean blaming like Elijah then all the troubles in Israel Elijah you are the cause of it unless said I'm not a cause but your sense and it was of your wife disable that is causing the frozen Israel so that always quick to point fingers but when you know your position and when this is reached in your heart my sister it doesn't matter I don't have to be a brother you do have to be brother Jack to overcome your situation but but you cannot be at your way please you can be in your home you and your home you are new to school you're on the street you are driving a highway you have to have the Holy Ghost and you should be sensitive and tightened down when situation arise don't be quick to act don't be quick to judge calm down let it in a man talk to you and see what the inner man you see it's not everything you have to see something they are certain that the answer is silent and let it in a man wake him so far because in you in your situation when you quickly act you can act wrongly you could act not based on what Christ wanted to do but based on your flesh missing on your right America is what people's right you're gonna be a judge and your lawyer but let Jesus Christ represents you calm yourself down when you see one you think you are getting angry don't talk if you somebody's upsetting you don't talk whatever please home whatever relax let the Holy Ghost come down Jesus had all their power they accused him falsely it is nothing they pull his beard it is nothing he says when the Holy Ghost lead him to see you Lisa when they said when what what the king is that I can't set you free care responds then you don't have you can set me free what I'm going through the Lord God allowed me to go through the only who see me tell me if you don't have power over me and listen nothing no more because was anointed and led of the Spirit like a ram you just got a lie on site when it's time to use it to defeat the devil but you don't use the lie on that hey I'm a child of God how dare you touch me this really aren't this you're gonna act this on pride but not on their way and if a lot away situation would take out themselves at the situation the Holy Ghost knew take off situation somebody can slap in your face you know have to be good you are going to act pray for him or her and let the Holy Ghost think of the situation maybe didn't say where he kicked you in the face you prove god bless you that is more than punching back in the face because it's not normal for you to point somebody in America and the person tells you god bless you it doesn't happen so that is more of a punch than punching him back do you get it you get it my sister if I walk in and somebody says something against you a woman against me I'm gonna talk back no I'm mrs. Jesus Christ let my husband go to wake I represent eternity for the know for my Sigma for the sake of him I don't do this bliss my husband my husband is an honorable man he talks about me in the streets don't you see my wife Troy don't see my wife sister bears notice my wife Amanda no drama a Cessna cops don't you see my wife and Erica don't see my brother Garrett don't you see my wife Sarah sister Dixon's that all of you he's my wife he talks about you he boasts of you like in the book of Proverbs so that the honorable man boosts Avada the wife in the streets when it's among his friends

his wife you eyes elected he possesses you he loves you he knows you by your name you don't represent yourself you represent eternity so for the sake of eternity crichton down come down the wall is

glorious week and bless his father and bring us back in up when that time in Jesus Christ we pray amen god bless you [Applause] how we appreciate the Lord for they I've never heard a sermon like that and all my years I just loved the way that he set it up taking us through some quotes there and tying it back to the Zodiac brother brand under the random talked about he met me when amongst Pentecostals for the first time and he says there was a few preachers there but he said it was a older gentleman that got got the preaching they say he he said he went way up and brought him down the horizontal rainbow and just say he just preached and and he preached Christ said at a level is this he said just really you know you know talking about how job said where were you when the sons of God shouted for joy and Morningstar so sing sing together say he was way up there and you know we know that he talked the brother Braylon told us about the Bibles of the zodiac being the first Bible that got wrote and but I just never heard anybody just take the zodiac and put it in a script and he every every sign was identified everybody know who they are and if you were born under Sun then you should know what your destiny is oh come on right hey man I'm if you if you were cancer I feel that's gonna be part of your nature right if you were Sagittarius I know that's gonna be part of your nature right Taurus I have that's gonna be partyi nature Aries I am that's gonna be part of nature leo possess that's gonna be part of the nature man I tell you the truth that Scorpio penetrates right I've taken this distance just bless my heart not like I never heard nobody do that before just glad it happened that spirit and truth I just felt like a good foundation was being laid there right a good foundation and and and and I'm one that I believe that enemy is certainly getting us too busy where it's hard to hear the voice of God all right and so when we could just kind of slow down a little bit and get this there maybe it helps us in our journey you know I mean and like I said I don't know I'm I don't want to make light of you know different trials that we go through and and things like that but understand no matter what the trial is that the a name is bringing or being allowed to bring into your life that is an attack to try to get you off of the destiny that God has for you right and so so if you can't allow the trial to get you wrapped up in your emotion a man and you know just you just miss what God is doing because you because of the way you feel I feel I feel well what does the Bible say you know what does God's Word say about it right and at some point in time you got to come back to that and declare you stand based on the Word of God not based on how you feel a man a man a man you know I had a little something just come up here recently you know the Lord blessed the our business amen and we had some we had God given us some new clients and and I was like lord thank you for these clients but now I need people to work and and everybody I was calling nobody wanted the work what I'm supposed to doing and and then that I was looking at my wife cuz usually there's nobody work she'll do the work but I'm looking on say she can't go to work she can't she can't she I mean and I got to show up on Monday with something I said Lord I'm Aneesa I need I need some help but after I got myself calm if I was getting upset with everybody that didn't want to work well you feel like the application but uh but but I said no don't do that just Lord what do you want me to do God what do you want me to do what you want me to do just wait on the Lord wait on the Lord get quiet before God they say okay but you you're a doubt Craigslist's like you did last time okay I forgot about that Lord I put my ad out I say what I what my knees were all this and then call if you interested and while I'm flying back home yesterday I get a call the call came while I was on the plane so I couldn't answer it but I hear this message once I get to the airport and I'm going through the airport here this latest say I need that job I need this I need that and I want I want I want to I think within a five-minute conversation she responded and gave me everything I needed to put her to work on Monday God knows how to meet the need if there's a client here they need they need someone to take care of him God got the right person that he wants to feel that particular role and what we just wait for him to do it and let me tell you something about my god you don't do things halfway if you give him the client right then he's also giving you the work up glory God a man hallelujah amen whatever the need is God will supply you don't do things halfway that's not we serve right what we gotta learn how to do is just wait here is for it see it's a still small voice he'll speak but we get so wrapped up yeah we can't do that I think that thing it was very timely at the Lord just you know Burrell brothers thought about Martha and Mary to us because it's very easy to look at him in Scripture you know and I was in Tucson last week last Thursday when I preached there and I preached that sermon kami thinking of title right now step into the vision but I was preaching and then brother preacher to come behind me brother Darrell Ward he say oh look it's a script retook the scriptures but I add the priestess this this would into the scripture you say well I got a preach it anyway he know the Lord even to myself it just freed us it brother please please preach it and he preached to me took the same store Mary Martha and he said his title is gonna be Jesus go meet Jesus and you know when this between the trial come you got and you got one of two options you can either see sit and let's keep doing whatever you do right or you can get up and go meet Jesus Mary just kept sitting there but Martha got up and she went through Jesus we got to do it some poor Tommy we have to make a choice I hope getting up from whatever I'm feeling get enough from how I'm thinking praise God man give up go meet him go meet him he's only one turn the situation you know I tell you what a devil try to keep aside the church and things like I don't miss services like this I want to be a part of it this is hard for somebody to tell you you know you you know you missed it how do you explain this to everybody man you just got to be there hey man you got the beat here real quick oh god bless you from oversleep born born with destiny born with not just a despot born with destiny God know what he's doing god no what'd he do that's pray father we thank you for the word the Lord that has come to us today God your servant got himself on the way Lord Justice to be and Lord as we just he just went through each one of us were born underneath one of these signs everybody in here how he placed it right back in the word other boy have maybe take any size horoscopes they've done all kind of whirling things with it but God you're helping to see ourselves in Scripture who we are in you there's a purpose that you have us big born under that specific sign you don't make mistakes God we're thankful for that and we're just pray Lord that you would help us and to realize that uh God if we just yield ourselves to you that we will find our place in Christ it's not
