Saturday morning the service that I've reached just really really wonderful time there in Austin Texas taking us there in the rings back home on last night yes appreciated reason just as do many many wonderful things the pastor that's there and in Austin McAllen drew mine my heart tore some trying to do a weekend like this there's just started this work about three years ago and he was living and I was I was asking him about how did he get there to Austin he was living in Atlanta and and somehow he told me what happened was that he was looking for some equipment he wanted to purchase Craigslist some saw the website so people say we got this equipment that was selling [Music] give me the deal [Music] you contact them singing yeah yeah we'll have a great scene we got some other stuff too everybody sailing we want to just sum just come with a little extra money booth but would make a real good deal so he was excited about it we went to go buy this equipment big setup and what it was was these guys they knew exactly how much money you'd be bringing so when they got you to a place where they wanted to where they were supposedly the equipment was then they would rob you and many people were gone and be robbed and often times of being killed here at that location but for some reason it took all this money and they took his wallet and got his address on it but they didn't kill him they didn't kill him and and by not killing him then they start sticking out his house right they're coming to Southeast I gotta get out of Atlanta I gotta leave as fast as I can and didn't know where to go when somehow the Lord opened the door for him to go to Austin Texas and he ended up repulsive and the Lord has raised up by a working me and as I was just listening to his testimony and how protecting him from danger you know tremendous provision by God vadas struck my heart the sermon your purpose is your protection [Music] and I was listening to his Tesla Seth I feel like I'm supposed to preach that in Austin their purpose is your protection no matter what the devil has planned against you now what he's tried a man against you I mean you can be at gunpoint but if you got purpose with God it's gonna be your protection man God will turn the gun the guns away God will turn the cause away just trying to hit you somebody else should have died a long time ago he was in an accident and you should have died you you're not supposed to be here lifting your hands you not supposed to be here raising your voice but God protected - and your purpose hallelujah was your protection glory to God he may leave many many name thank you Jesus hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Lord and devil is still a liar [Music] devil is still alive hallelujah amen I believe that I believe God told the devil not today Satan today you can't do that today praise God a man many times in our life his purpose for us has been our protection you know we just I knew that the Lord at police that in my spirit to go to Austin with and I was there to see my lord I know one sermon opps wouldn't preach but I don't know the other sermon and we were sitting around talking and as we were talking I was just just listening to the conversation and then I said Lord oh I think I'm supposed to preach one of circumstances [Music] and as soon as I came to Amman that conclusion I got a telephone call and brother Trevor was telling me he said you know brother Jack my blessing in disguise that's all he said when he when he opened the conversation I'm looking for my blessing in disguise what you're talking about he's saying because I've had a lot of circumstances happen and you say it was a blessing in disguise and I've said all right I say you just gave me my compliment as to what I ought to preach tonight and gazebos he was on his way to sweeten I think he's there this morning and and somehow he got all held up in traffic and things like that it wasn't able to make the flight and and a text or email from the Airlines said you know what we got bad weather at this Airport and anybody that wanted to change their flight we're gonna waive all the fees so you can change it and not worry about it they say I say how you say brother god I said God you saw that to confirm my sermon so thank you very much you say but did God have to do it that way I say glory to God

into daylight here Lord father you know the nice Lord hearts of your people Lord you know the desires Lord Jesus Christ speaking on your word life into our peace my lord resurrected their father Lord God heal their sick Lord city captain free and for the movies higher chances price we want to have influence our with less operations brother as the family less of the price bless us as they slaughter our brothers Lord the children father you know the needs of everyone Lord Jesus them that as Mexican developers partisan father it is your promise the Lord you give it to as Muhammad said before even the endemic fish to swim you had a water for the fish law before the birth other wings to fly father you really had a father that their effort to fly before we had a desire you already in our hearts Lord Jesus Christ you are just making it manifest to us father we can in the sea bringing it to life Lord God in Jesus Christ we pray amen god bless you shall we take our Bible if you can hit on a little Scripture Romans chapter in verse 22 and I give a I don't know brother whose way was able to give the flash drive I want to read from Romans 8:1 to - I want to read from the King James and also the lamb salvation because I want to pick something from the lamb salvation so if you can if is if it's that it can protect it from if not I read from here Romans chapter 8 verse 1 - - I read from the irregular King James ok we have here the Lampson say that there's the therefore no condemnation to them who walk in the flesh after the spirit of Jesus Christ there is therefore no condemnation to them who walk in the flesh after the spirit of Jesus Christ for the law of the spirit of life which is in Jesus Christ has made you or me free from the law of sin and death that is a lamb sir then our reblog King James goes there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Jesus Christ who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death not the first verse if you look at it lumps out you might take your seat please be seated god bless you if you look at the lamps I loose contradictory lamps I said who walk in the flesh after the spirit then ki Jameson who walked in in the in the spirit not after the flesh now lambda was a Jewish person the bat was a Jewish Bible and so he was using in in we walk in the flesh this is the flesh system elementary carry but we know we don't walk after their cosmos the order of the flesh amen do we walk in this spirit my flesh is not broken taking away all my flesh I have my assistant element you have your head your foot you don't read so now he broke it more than that we walk in the flesh yes in this is the element but not after the cosmos of the world we walk after the ordinance of make ascetic of Jesus Christ the spirit in us he's the one who pulls the flesh along amen glory hallelujah but then the kingdom said that we walk not we work in Christ but not after the flesh in other words King James was using the flesh to type the cosmos the order of the world we don't walk after their ungodliness but we walk after Christ which is the symptom but then the lumps are making more cleanly because we work so in the flesh so the flesh is important to God amen when God calls you will die but it doesn't mean this flesh died you still have your flesh you shall have your system element the Lord rearranged and a lot transform it amen you don't throw your flesh sure we don't put your flesh in a casket you become a few funny made you soon need this flesh just like butter Jack say that so often eventually be living here but God save our flesh through a dangerous accident through an infection through a disease through a demonic attack through whatever witchcraft the lost in this flesh because the Lord has used for this flesh as well amen so we want to pick a subject be sensitive to the inner man be sensitive to the inner man let the flesh be sensitive to the inner man this someone the low place on my heart about from more than five months ago before I went to Mexico and a missionary with brother Josue and I keep praying about it and I keep praying about it and brother Jack came when I came back it's you know it's the women want us none be better when you are pregnant you cannot shake away from your pregnancy you can go to sleep so tell me when to wake up is it's a problem you have to tell yourself in a way your sleep probably is not normal maybe you cannot sleep on your stomach I'm not sure you mother's can tell me better so on so you deliver you are not really really free Amen when you are pregnant and when to look for something on your heart you are not free sometime I'm driving that someone come right before me when I get away from before it's just right something before me and it's just like Lord whatever your world lets someone be free that I'll be free and their brother Jack comes about two months ago when you did print prayer and answers on one Wednesday I think it should be about almost two months ago he just ran into hit boom boom boom boom boom said praise be to God even the scripture was good to use it use the same scripture lesson Thank You Lord it's a confirmation then I've got a new way to preach praise be to God when he told me about a month ago to to have today for service and I know Lord there's a time let it out that I'll be free amen praise be to God God cares about you amen even the continuity of the services shows that God thinks about you he cares about every situation you are in he cares about your flesh because a lot even the hair on your head God cares for it even your fingernails got his Cofield amen he cares about your water because about your finance your family your children your wife your husband I mean your job your school in whatever your clothes even the laundry God discs of it amen so motherly he's so fatherly he's so brotherly sisterly he's all in all amen he cares for everything but then he want us to be draw a little closer more sensitive to him praise be to God so today I'm not going to be just a pieces of advice that is what I'm going to do today if the loss or bias we just give something our blesses in the flesh be sensitive to the inner man the flesh is the one who should be sensitive to the inner man amen the inner man has a work has a purpose for this flesh God is done with you you wouldn't be here if got is done with me I wouldn't be here God is not done with you amen that's why you are still in your system element God was done with about Abraham so he Pakistan element to to the back to the earth and his few funny the holy go see him isn't glory now Amen god it was done with maybe some brothers and sisters they went to glory they are here in the celestial dimension but you can see them amen by you and I goddess has you and I here to continue their battle to shine to bring the attribute of Christ into an expression amen that's why you are here so God loves you he cares for you praise be to God amen I want to read something from okay let me just go go I will be sensitive to the spirit to the inner man now is the inner man the inner man is the Holy Ghost baptism is to subscribe self that is who you are that is a true you amen the flesh man or the flesh body is the gut is a clothing that you wear to manifest in this dimension you know gonna need this work on the other side but Abraham made these sins are here but we can see them there in a much much more better condition much more better body it doesn't get sick it doesn't grow old it doesn't have to pay bills it doesn't have to do laundry it doesn't have to wake up to go to wake it just glory glory hallelujah amen the sun-eater never as a song the Sun it will never go down in the city the Sun it will never good their flowers are blooming forever in this sunny to never go down so the Sun doesn't go down in the celestial body but here we live in the sunlight and darkness today you have sunlight tomorrow is darkness today all is Rotem or you lost your job you don't even have a dollar in your pocket that is where but why does the Lord does it that way he wants you toward be closer to be dependent on him amen so they'll God use a negative contrast to build a positive contrast in your life that is why himself came down to die God could have saved all mankind just by his thoughts he didn't need to become a human being to die to be strip naked to suffer but he wanted to be part of this creation amen so that you know what you are feeling what you are going through because he's been part of it amen so he learned experience by the things that he suffered so he's left something for you and I also to go through both our character for the glory land amen praise be to God the Lord has a purpose for every one of you what are you a young old you a brother sister you are it doesn't matter everybody the Lord has a purpose specific for you and that purpose is coded in your hearts amen it doesn't matter you a child goddess please something in you that you are sensitive that you are not like the other people you might be in school with them you might be in the neighborhood with them but a lot has made you different and you are separated you for a purpose I want to read a little quotes here Redemption comes with price I don't know if you have the slice or it's in the power of transformation can go down to Redemption comes with price if you have it is 1965 65 - 10 31 M power of redemption paragraph 78 it says our redemption wasn't a chip in our redemption wasn't a chieftain it was the son of God had to die for us see things of value come of great price things of value come comes with great price Amen you can go to a good wall and just go and get a maybe a share dress for me three dollars but then you can't go to missus and get a brand-new clothes with three dollars they will look in your face you can't do that it doesn't happen so if you want to let's say dress from Macy's then you gotta prepare got your purse or your wallet load it because you're gonna look into maybe eighty dollars fifty dollars something around our price or even more because it's got value amen goodwill somebody just donated to them somebody doesn't what is clothes I know you guys can take it and sell whatever you want to do with it so they can sell it for a dollar to five ten dollars but then if you go to Goodwill or if you want a designer clothes then you have to what plea the price for it so our redemption that is why God himself he wanted to show is that not that it could have serviced by barometer that you could have attended the light they want to preach by God ordained man that you raise from the cradle they went through all the suffering to preach the gospel Jesus could have serious without coming to diet but is something that has a value so he has to pay a price by coming to die amen so now he said our Redemption it's not cheap to bring the messin up around speaking paragraph 79 to bring the message it wasn't easy see I had to forsake everything that was dear to me even my own people everybody but you see the value of it is it is to do the will of God and to do that which knowing that something you mean when they used to say well there was going to put me away I lost my mind thought we thought I lost my mind baptizing in the name of Jesus Christ contrary to the church now it's not is nothing strange denomination people baptized in the name of Jesus Christ but at that time the thought is lost his mind how can you baptize in the name of Jesus Christ when everybody's baptized name of God the Father God the Son God the Holy Spirit where did you get his trained dog friends from and yes it's in the Bible but because over the years the devil has wiped the blinded people with a Trinitarian doctrine when the truth was presented to them they thought it was in the truth when you hear a lie continuously you perceived a lie as truth and when the truth come you think that is a lie because it's so foreign and strained to you Amen so that was the time said they said he's crazy but see no matter what they see there's something that's a purpose for vertebra ham so it doesn't matter how rejected he was he stood on his ground he stood on the Holy Ghost ground he was sensitive to the inner man the Holy Ghost in him amen so sometime not everybody's going to love you for being who you are for being a son or daughter of God but you have to be sensitive for your calling and your purpose on earth amen not everybody's going to say you are good you look good people make smack comments about you the way you dress especially our sisters are you going to change your lifestyle and begin to throw something on to make people happy are you going to stick to what the inner man is telling you amen there's an inner man telling you that dress cover yourself put your because you are sacred on to the Lord you are sacred on to your husband if an almighty gonna be sacred on to your husband something to cover yourself amen so you have to listen to what the inner man is telling you sometimes we have the Holy Ghost or what in a man do I have I remember by the Jackson one time he said when my daughters were young I was acting the Holy Ghost for them amen I was there holy goose amen so if you don't have the Holy Ghost we do have an understanding God has put a man of God as a Holy Ghost for you God has put your parents amen as it was for you goddess put their brother as they will it was for you God has put a modest sister say well it goes for you so he's the one that you can look up to for now on to the inner man takes his place amen so you might not have to understand everything you have to accept that yes you are my Holy Ghost praise God glory hallelujah God doesn't have to explain everything to us the preachers I don't have to explain everything to us but you know that is therefore your purpose is therefore your calling is there for you to bring you to where you are amen so that when you get in a man then you can connect the two that is price sticking through him is the same Jesus Christ sticking through me now blessed be the name of the Lord amen the Lord loves you he cares for you that's a song he said my god he loves me it's love on a vine he resting in my heart for my God loves me your Christ he loves you it's love whenever I here AC res he rest in your heart for Jesus he loves you so God loves you now sometimes we can get into trouble the way we present ourselves you know I'm talking about the flesh to say but I cook why don't you talk something spiritual we have talking about flesh it just like your clothes you can't no matter how you clean yourself you can't put on your DD clothes around you gotta wash your clothes amen so sometime the Lord the flesh guess about the flesh that's why you heal our sickness when we sick sometimes sudden sickness love cause you thousands of dollars maybe do we have insurance just by prayer from the pasta prayer for my sister the Lord he loses his you just like that because he cares for you amen but and the Lord wants you to give something back to him he loves you and want you to make a little sacrifice to him build a machine comes with price amen your redemption was in cheap God has to die amen so you're gonna give up certain habits setting characters setting niches you could not throw them away under the pulpit Lord cast it away from me bring it away from me I just present my old garment wash it take it naked me and put on me a garment of your white amen I'm talking about the Holy Ghost amen come as you are the law does the law doesn't he loves you just the way you are but present yourself or wash me and change me amen you want to see Christ in you that is the whole purpose of God that you form is image in you amen being sensitive to the Holy Ghost the insensitive to Christ I want our lifestyle our dressing counts a lot as Christian sometime God can use somebody you're dressing just about a Jackson since Amanda and I didn't know her no way but I saw her and I saw the light in her I saw there's something different in people aware I was going to school there were a lot of waitress because it's a religious school but then when I saw it she was different I've seen people that wear long long dress but she was different so God has put something in you as a reflector of himself amen and he wanted the natural that the physical also to reflect what the inner man is amen because if you confess one thing and your life portraits one thing that makes you a crew the crew has got is a bed is black and white is a hypocrite amen but we are no crews we are plain egos we are good in egos we are not just egos we are the good in ego you are the good an ego amen the good ego is one of the ego you cannot touch something that is rotten no it doesn't have the gut for it if something is rotten it cannot go near it it doesn't mean it's something that somebody has killed it has to be it has to be cured fresh he has to see it killed so the only way to do that is to for him or her to kill it then you know that yes this card is good this a chicken was killed is fresh amen so they'll not give us a fresh meat the loss and you have fresh meat from heaven through the Prophet trees past the trees ministers to give it a meat now put your body amen now body or Carta now put the nature of Jesus Christ in you now give you the rapture amen now give the resurrection now bring eternal life in your heart praise be to God glory to God when I was coming out in the a as a young brother my pastor said something that I'll in some time the way you portray yourself can put you in trouble in my country you so have a time where you had military leaders and I used to be coup d'etat so this guy who had true this person and so - you know about five young men went to lesser like Miami Accra to the stadium to watch a soccer we call it soccer football so then when I think it was Sunday Sunday or Saturday they went just to watch soccer the was there because he was a fan of soccer fan let go into Miami from one of the small towns to watch maybe Miami what Dolphins or whatever right so they were they and then there was somebody wanted to blow the president so there was a grenade blew it up bidding her the president's Willie started to wrap up before they got these guys who had this haircut when I was in high school so tada hey Cudi here curry here and then it's way up here so that is a haircut so they saw that is like these guys might be they're the guys who tried to predict in today they robbed them to them to jail and they put them in a basement with no light so the newspaper young people we are coming from a town which had leaders in in Ghana we have a political leaders we've got ships and keys so the king of diarrhea wrote a letter the parents went to see them that my kids they were not they have nothing to do with this grenade they just want to watch soccer so if you competition the president to release them to the petitioner president and they release them somewhere blind what some of them died a couple days they were not the same they were as innocent as innocent could be but a haircut give them a week just a haircut so God called you and I insipidus precipitate you for purpose amen just a haircut they were not criminals they didn't know about grenades they were not military people but the a haircut they thought they were these guys looks like a criminal praise be to God let me give an example here a brother this a brother I said Jimmy camp brother before he was converted you know dreadlocks I don't know how you call it the dreadlocks right the others dreadlocks and one day after work he was going to whom he was going to his home and you know how I young people put your paints you know we call it in gonna call it auto Fister so they put your pens you know you know it right so you had those kinda with the walk they walk like you know [Music] so this Rada was just you Colli Colli just going home after work you know with his goggles going in and all of a sudden the police cops came around they just run at him up what's going on said you Robin only there's an old lady going on you took her place I said I don't have a clue I don't know what you're talking about before you could say Jack they just put him took him to sell he didn't have no opportunity to defend himself they didn't give me a lawyer he looked like who should take that old lady spell you are you got dreadlocks you are black in other cities the most polarized country on the planet you know we are so polarized so you are black you've got red loss your your pants is this way and in the way you Kali who we declare now you should affirm man so this brother landed though he wasn't every wasn't a believer then but then the Lord sometimes is merciful he wrote a letter to his friend who was a believer that the church should pray for him and after his girl release he would come to church he said they'd give him a Bible he was innocent so he wasn't worried he was reading his Bible in jail he said about I don't know a couple months and then they left him he came to church got baptized cut off the dreadlocks he received Christ for himself so the Lord used it to bring him closer see how you're dressing for him he was he wasn't a no he wasn't a believer so the Lord used that occasion to draw him closer but for you you don't have to go down routes amen you do have to leave your beard put it in the ship it's not a dog train have a beard have whatever I want but don't let it grow wild because somebody will think you are something you are not a man because we are a polarized country it used to be on top in Lada was caught if you have a long beard leaving used to call it bin Laden because they thought bin Laden's doctrine people that believe in Balad and leave that long beard so you might be innocent walking around and the police has a crime the police who are black you are Hispanic you are this and of course you could not be amended when I arrest you and take you to jail it is real a man we don't talk about about Israel and now give you my testimony when I was in San Antonio some time I come from wake and I like to I'm not a singer but I like to sing and just have a little time just get time with the Lord walk around eat trees around my apartment so one midnight it was probably close to 12 to almost midnight I was walking around I was in a black pants and black no t-shirt black and a sweater it was getting cold so this police I saw these police behind me : I said probably Scully because of me that was my mind and I look back well I was still going around and singing so he came around me and my hands were in my pocket so I said what are you have in your pocket I said I have my keys to Kim's what I do yes I live in this apartment is where I live so I give him a the number they have all them all of them in a data system they work with the apartment so but what are you in black black black I said what is wrong with being in black black that what I address according to the weather is anything wrong said no it I mean don't you know it's not good please put on some something to me don't put on black black just put on some other colors because people who sell drugs people who do drugs they usually wear black black to to give a signal if you want to buy then you know that somebody said oh one didn't know okay so if that the case okay then now I'll try not to put on black black anymore because so now just wearing black and being black had cocaine or weed my one eye my pocket so he thought it's got a big fishy call for backup that he does I'm gonna use some ways forgive me there's this black dude here you know probably's got drags midnight there's nobody around call for a backup so I assure him what is my pocket was my key and it began to speak with me gently then so every your colour can can put in trouble the colour God give it to you but God has given us wisdom that you protect yourself Amen praise be to God let me give you one one with some of my own soul I said I'm going to advise you I'm not preaching don't train but I'm good give a piece of advice that we can all use it amen my last trip to Mexico when I was coming back I went through Miami but I was with him first and I went to another place before coming back I go to the airport and the guy asked me why are you coming from what I said Juarez what are you going to do I went to preach missionary ok why don't you go to priest in any other place without worries say well that's where the law sent me so do you know that place is a bad places yeah I know so why do you go there so why don't why don't why don't I have to go there so the guy said well I'm gonna do I'm going to separate you and you know we're gonna set you and do a say ok whatever I want to do if you don't find cocaine with me you're gonna release me right so no problem so these guys said why don't you what you spend what do you get your money from with your sponsor what work do you do and so you begin questioning well you go in Mexico and I told him sell to you oh that is another bad place so you call for the offices and to call my staff my two bags and everything separated me and one other guy we spend up like an hour to check my bag or ran through check everything scan everything went to their computers their x-rays ran everything there was no cocaine there was no weed Sookie you can go as I thank you god bless you so sudden things even going to do the work of God can you be between troubles and please let you go so God give us wisdom if it's for the gospel yes people pay with their life for the gospel if I think God put something you had to do you don't have to be afraid God God has your back amen if God sent you he's got your back amen you don't have to have a fear no he that is in you is greater than he that since the world but don't put yourself in a harm's way don't let you don't dress in a way that we should no doubt put three use as what you are not amen if we sister don't waste our ends kids that somebody you think you a call girl you know a cowgirl because you are not amen don't waste attend dress that portray certain areas that should be portrayed well that is not you Amen people who do that they do have to attract men by you that is not your motive so why do you have to do that praise be to God [Music] the Lord is good can I go a little further and then just give me a second the Lord is good praise be to God our our sisters dress them stay here for a while I don't know if the slide is working I had this one I had a tough time but who speak him to help me I'm not sure I wanted to show you certain things I got even advice like butter butter Jack preached the scriptures I was going to use Isaiah about the daughters of Zion about God talking about high heel I know the extreme and the Bible prophecies about it way back now let me show you something I don't know if I can the slide is working but then let me show you the side effect of where you are in high heels this just an advice is not a doctrine does issue when you wear high-heel you know the body look at the foot it's meant to the fullest we stand in a form of a pyramid as a human means when you slant you are like a parameter you have a broad base you can stretch so this foot is your balance this is where you it's your basic foundation foundation now if you wear a high heel to certain level now instead of putting the pressure on the foot you put a pressure in just in the front and the body has to make certain adjustment in your body there's an adjustment here adjustment here adjustment at the back and when you do it consistently you begin to develop back pains fractious let me read some of them for you lower back pain sore calves so muscle foot pain ankle sprains and falling you look like you are falling awkward spine a cave constrict blood vessel the blood vessel set modem are constricted so blood hasn't flow easily crooked your food can be crooked crooked feeds weakens ligaments Carlos is shortened what Achilles tendon lack of cushion and ingrown toenails those are salt a side effect when you consistently wear those hills because you put a body out of balance remember this flesh is just a muscles the one who put is the skeleton their bones so when you go this way you've seen that they position the natural position so you put some pressure on do pressure on your body and that can have a longtime effect on you so the Lord heed my not explaining like Dorchester splitted but he put in a Bible that don't even go there because it's not even good for you when hi he'll not take you to hell if we're child of God take a gun and shoot all the perp on the planet if an American was not American let me give an example if an American and let's say you go to Colombia you are the High Commissioner to Colombia all to Mexico and you go to selling cocaine and then they bring you back they make some propose I know these guys corrupt he's selling cocaine here they can sign you to channel because you're an American they'll send you back to the United States but maybe to take your passport from your diplomatic privileges you won't travel no more you can go outside the US because you disgrace a country the same way for a child of God kill all the poop on the planet it's not going to take you to hell you are so eternity but Allah to make you pay for every one of them here what we do the Lord make us to pay for it because when you go to the other side you don't have nothing to pay your slit to be clean so therefore that we do here the Lord give us time enough to pay for all the evils we do so that he was led to be clean when you go on the other side but you want to do that you want to spend your life paying for prizes or I want to spend your life do I find the Lord Jesus Christ amen [Music] you want to do something that will send you to jail now give you problems that will chase you all your life or you want to put your life obey the word of the Lord now bless you and bless your generation and bless the people around you praise be to God blessed be the name of the Lord I don't know if this is the pictures didn't come do you have the pictures okay good so this is a posture when you put on those Hills look at how their food the natural posture is different so you put those pressures on your body and a few more bodies already because of God design women to bring children bring life you already go through seven things they go through osteoporosis and certain ages at menopause Odell the Lord want you to prosper not only in the spirit but in the flesh as well now look is pressure now instead of the pressure being on their foot the pressure is now the second when the pressure come to the knee and then heat transferred to the hip to the backbone and acquires factor of spine so the Lord when the butter Jack preach about in your scriptures I'm no use in scriptures to use the scriptures already if we know here I think about Jack sir that is for charity only so it was a recorded if not listen to it face and you understand it some more much better so the Lord want to bless you you want to bless your health amen even setting food too much sugar diabetes so come on in in every way Suda so the students that we have here they don't use natural sugar cane they use sucrose artificial sugar and that sugar bring obesity diabetes blood pressure so it's just an advice like I said to them no it's just an advice don't drink to my soda don't drink soda every day I'm not saying I stay away from soda but don't make it a habit of every day I mean consuming about five liters of soda as you grow is gonna have effect on you because you don't want to do diabetes you don't want to do a blood pressure amen it's not even advisable to eat meat every day it's difficult for Africans Africans love meats but it's not good to eat meat every day because naturally God didn't creatures to be Cannavaro sitting critters to eat meat naturally was created to be happy for us it's plants and so forth but because of the fall we started killing so everybody is killing the lion is killing the cat is killing everybody we all started killing and killing cow good fish and everything so it's become part of our life I'm not saying that be a vegetarian but I mean be moderate because if you take meat every day is not good for the kidney because they saw the meat you don't need all of them so in poisons they're toxic to the kidney the liver but the Lord is living in this body amen the Lord want you to cross by in health and also prosper in the spirit it's miserable when you are sick when you have disease and you can't wake up you can't I mean use this but the way you use it so the Lord give us those advices to help us as Hebrews we are supernaturally bruised God has separated separated us from the things of the world and you want to bless even your flesh as well amen that's why I say be sensitive to the Spirit of the Lord praise be to God and I have a reference if you want to go and read further about the hams the high hills and the hubs they can cost you the body you can read about American Osteopathic Association organization even Simha bodies who do the best you can as much if you don't need it our advice that just leave it alone amen because God loves simplicity that is sin and simplicity the most simple you are the more easy easy easy life is for you amen we humans make things complicated faster but a lot is simple amen and this my advice to the young sisters and brothers those who are not married sometime when you begin to do certain things you put yourself in a certain category a nail polish and a mouth polish I don't know that term that is a manicure pedicure the sisters can help me pedicure manicure whatever it is help me I don't use them so those Polish new polish right fingernail polish yes you bread and no distance sometimes it can be effective and if we Sistani do that sometimes three or so away from your blessing so young sisters one on Marissa came for husband pray for husband is an advice just a tip stay away from be simple so that God can directed to the right man he has for you amen that a man can see can his mind he can throw his mind off something he knows us a brother or a sister but sentence can is the bread I've been born again is this brother born again if we're Bradley we conduct yourself that's the can say no before this what I was even born again I mean I'm not going to know I don't have a brother who's not born again but maybe you have the Holy Ghost but will you conduct yourself amen so those cylinders can impediment in our way amen because God want to bless you bless you spiritual you especially bless you i seed of Abraham Abraham was blessed one day God called Abraham said let's take a walk Abram was a friend of God it's a let's take a walk Abram went with God applause I went with him as I look into the sky count the Stars say Lord I cannot do it it's okay let's go to the seashore look at the sun sand a gravel count the rocks said I cannot count them says so will I bless you said I've got a cannot straight by any other the greatest himself said astray by myself in blessing will I bless you in multiply multiply you amen you are the seed of Abraham Abraham and the same covenant is with you if there is time God will bless you and you see thereafter and you have to make a stand for the Lord amen because the colon is not a cheap call that's why God separated you and left others amen your friends were not caught but you are being called your community not everybody was called but you are the one who was being called maybe in your house Lumino it might be the only believe on your household but God had you for purpose amen so God want to present yourself in a way they are not through your blessings away amen praise be to God and the brothers - sometimes our appearances can even through certain people I will because the there is a constant maybe you don't even have the Holy Ghost because the way you control you you you present yourself you don't look like a child of God you a child of your body dozens of inner winner I don't want to be good for a brother who doesn't have the Holy Ghost I don't want to mess my life probably a hundred but it goes by the way you present yourself so it's good to present ourself in a decent and moderate way that every blessing God asks for you will be yours amen praise be to God because God loves you remember he cares for everything of your life even the head he cares for it amen so nail polish mouth polish pedicure manicure whatever you call it don't let it be yourself you've got give you this finger color love it what you want to change the color you've got meet your hair black why don't why do you want to paint it yellow and green be who you are amen love what God has made you to be because you can be God couldn't have made you better than what is made you have made me better than what he has made me so if I change my color if I change my fingernails that means God didn't give me the right fingernails so I want to make it red or pink or yellow be who you are amen because you can't please everybody and I'll give an example when I was a kid I was born a left-handed in my country left-handed if I left-handed you can be a king it's kind of your UI inferior so left hand that is not even if you give on certain places you give an adult with your left hand let's say you want to give an adult you are disrespectful and adults you can't use your left hand to give something to an adult that's the culture so when I was a member after high school I played checkers some way and this would call me lefty because I'm dominant left and I didn't like it so I said you know what I have to find a way to like portray myself as right-handed person so I said I'm going to string my right hand and I wouldn't know I'm left-handed so I remember one time I was strung in my right tennis oh yes lefty come in as oh my it didn't work what's so I say no I'm gonna be myself does the record so it's European cannot change a skin and leopard cannot change your skin the way God made you be yourself so I started I know what I'm left-handed yes that's what a lot made me I don't want to be a king of Africa making of everything so that is good enough for me they made so you don't have to do things to please the world because you are not part of them you might try but in no time me what a part of them let me use what a bill oppose example but I believe Paul yes example YouTube testimony that he gifted young people he said when he was traveling with his deborah ham one day the devil you know they will gasp it through people the devil's who speak through people he can speak through your mind so the devil put upon its man you a young person you don't have no fun you don't have no life you just follow your dad to Africa and Europe and preach in you don't have no life you have noticed the world said it's just like a thought it came to his mind that everyone jetted I thought say I look like I'm loosing out so begin to tell us that is far as saw it in a vision before I even put into prancer I'm said Billy you can go all the way there's two route left and right you can go all the way to the left but remember God is waiting for you here the right way so he said well one one time he said it is you know they want to go and stay with his grandmother because he wanted to have his own way so Bram said well yes the house of God if you want to live in my house we serve the Lord you can't be doing things you're not supposed to do and he said okay I'll go and stay with my grandma he went with Grandma and had a liquid to do whatever I water to he got sick in a hop before even then he went to start gambling he went to where the gamble and the purpose what you know the bragging boy he said no I'm not you know the bragging boy because they know that no you are brown boy you are not supposed to be funny gambling week you're not part of us you're not part of the club what I do here what's your position here and he said before him to come with so I'm not I'm not Abraham boy but every wonder that you are there Brian boy for him to gamble he had to deny his father that he wasn't a Brahmin boy sometime we deny our Father above for us to be accepted by the world but we don't have to deny Jesus price we have to assert that God has made you who you are that is who you are amen when you accept yourself it's easy you don't care about what somebody think about you you are not pleasing that we are pleasing the inner man glory hallelujah today number two the Lord Jesus Christ so and there's prices to play when we go the wrong route amen because a child of God heaven is in your heart hell is not an option but a lot of make sure that we pay for whatever we do here blessed be the name of the Lord you might be a young person if I say what I don't have nothing to do for the Lord the Lord has put something in us silly new and as you are growing up get a lot is as you hear the word God is quickening the ceiling you is bringing the city to fruition and the more you are sensitive to the Holy Ghost even if you don't have the Holy Ghost you don't feel in him you have a pastor that preaches to you every every Sunday's Wednesdays and Fridays you have brothers and sisters you have parents you have a eldest you have deacons you have people that you can look up to the more that you become what you are you become what you eat if you eat on the word you're gonna become the word amen if you eat the world the cosmos you're gonna become the cosmos so it's better for you to make a choice now which path are you going into are you going to the right you want to go with the world the flow of the world or you want to stay with the Lord Jesus Christ praise be to God you have to accept who God has made you to be amen I remember one time in a college I used to those time I used to read message book I like to read so what I used to do was say I always have miss a book in my backpack so when I go to class the professor is not in i justá-- can read paragraph page then I check it the next time I keep reading so one time in class I remember biochemistry class and it was a small class about 28 students and some of the boys were laughing at the corner there where the guys were laughing and you know having some fun so I went as what's going on why you guys happy and they told me no go away we don't want to I mean it's not for you I said Tommy what's going on why you guys excited and I said I didn't know this guy doesn't know me he said you were pasta get out of this place we are talking about girls we are talking about girls and I came back and took my message but say you were pasta but this guy doesn't know me and I'm not a pasta so what is this guy talking about so people even see the gifting you before you recognize it and they are you accept who you are they're better amen if I serve what God has made you to be the better is this for you amen some of you God is going to use you wonderfully young and old the hand of the Lord is upon you and the more you give to the Ministry God has given to you you man understand everything but a jack preaches it might not make sense to you it might be like it might be roaming in your brain you just accept it where time is gonna make sense to you amen you might not understand what your parents tell you I mean with time it's gonna make sense to you so all that you have to do is what I said be sensitive to the inner man asserted Allah Jesus Christ what has made you to be the life would be much easier for you glory hallelujah praise be to God [Music] praise be to God the Lord is good and let's see I'll go back to go to well how the Lord use women as 10 I mean the Lord use setting women in a special way in the Bible amen sometime you might understand why even were born in their family sometimes you look around people have got freedom they can go out and come in whenever they want setting kids but you've got a parents who are always watching you I want to meet a sista in Ghana and as I said oh she's from French side Ivory Coast's this big friend said my dad is that is a message Minister passed I said it was too difficult for me when I was growing up everything you do matters if Rev remedy problem said said you were yours kids and that you come and say freb remedy Rev remedy whatever I do but Rob says my life is over promises I say since thank God for your father's in for everybody maybe your father didn't say for everybody you might have maybe half kiss that it implant for life would have been much difficult you sell a daughter of God but maybe life could have been much difficult for you but for us in February from Ramadi it has helped me to be who you are amen so sometimes growing up as a kid even understand what your friend is telling you what the elders are telling you about they have got experience they have water route and they know better so you just obey with time is gonna make sense to you praise be to God hallelujah being sensitive to the Holy Ghost when I finished high school amuse an experienced I finished high school I got a job just after high school graduate in a private school I was teaching there's a lot of kid just was happy teaching and a lot open a door for me I think I was just about a year or less than a year and the message I could preach with my students sing missus songs we did this like a church and it's a private school so the principal a school principal doesn't have problem as long as you teach is happy easy we have he was a Catholic but it was happy that you cannot put the student in that way one day I was teaching in an elderly person very old tall old man and he was kind of bent so he was with a cane and walking this way came to the window and as the student that call me your teacher and he said young man come and preach for me see I'm very old I have a church here use didn't know where the church is I can't reach no more come and preach for me and I was like it blows said I'm not a pastor how am I gonna do where's this coming from like I begin to bad I begin to become a battle for me so I was thinking said after school your student can very to wear my churches so Deborah Prince back him I was not sick influence said what did that old mentor what did he tell you and so I told me to come and pretty for him said forget about him don't don't don't don't pay attention to what the old man said and I didn't pay attention I didn't go I didn't do nothin in the course of time begin to hunt me so I asked my my pastor's brother he was a system pasta so what I said this happened to me I was sitting and an old man came and asked me to go preach for him but another pasta so I loved a lot I love to witness but I don't know he said oh don't you remember the message but Abraham Adam brought an evil he was a Methodist preacher and but I want to preach and the whole church was converted to the message and I didn't know better so when's demands well I even left a school and to add insult to injury and I'm tell you how to be be sensitive to the Holy Ghost to add insult to injury I begin to arch in my eye I had some time by the principal and I said you know I was going to leave this place because the principal was one of the leaders was telling me that the principal want to try to cheat others more than young ladies in the in the teaches edit among the teachers I said no no it is not this on my right this is only place for me I was a little bit legalistic so I left before I left I wrote a letter of resignation letter and went to the principal's office that I'm going to leave but I was still - you get another teacher so my class was like a church message preached do everything so my mind how am I
