[50:06] sounds just reflected this morning just
[50:08] all the great things that the Lord has
[50:10] done for us this year and
[50:13] and man God has proven himself ease yes
[50:17] showed up he has showed up
[50:21] and I'm here to a man restate that this
[50:25] has been the year of the incredible man
[50:28] this has been a year of incredible God
[50:40] my God made man in this morning we're so
[50:45] great for the Hat brother Joe I'm the
[50:48] with jr. and man with us man this
[50:51] precious wife sister Rebecca a man god
[50:54] bless you came into the office and say I
[51:01] got I got some surprise visitors for you
[51:06] today a surprise okay what praise the
[51:08] Lord
[51:08] and he told me brother ray insisted
[51:11] Bethenny came a man to be with us today
[51:13] so so good to see you all in the house
[51:16] of the Lord
[51:19] that's good I don't say I don't know
[51:22] what happiness is there's something on
[51:24] this side of the church is everybody
[51:25] drifted over here there's something over
[51:28] here that I'm missing I'm telling
[51:30] everybody drink
[51:31] [Music]
[51:33] oh you over their faces I just I just
[51:38] love the Lord amen but today I don't
[51:41] want to prolong the time I won't brother
[51:43] Joe just to come and I heard brother
[51:46] Solomon call sister Bethany to come
[51:48] singing and we certainly want her to do
[51:51] that but
[51:53] I know she probably needed brother Joe
[51:55] just to kind of tune it up for a little
[51:57] bit so a man hopeful she had a little
[51:59] time to think about what she wanted to
[52:01] do but a man as we just get ready to
[52:04] welcome him earlier this year
[52:07] brother Joe had come and supported some
[52:10] meetings that they drive roughly three
[52:12] and a half hours that come
[52:13] and I had come to support some meetings
[52:15] and and I was I said during those
[52:18] meetings I said brother before this year
[52:20] is out we gonna have you come and preach
[52:21] because I appreciate when ministers will
[52:25] support meetings when they're not
[52:27] reaching that said something to me when
[52:30] you go and you're not preaching you
[52:31] support and that mean a lot right so you
[52:34] know oftentimes it's very easy for
[52:37] ministers a man to to pull supportive
[52:41] who ain't preaching I ain't goin if I
[52:43] preach nine and I invite none of the
[52:45] people from my church so that lets the
[52:47] wrong spirit their own spirit right Amen
[52:50] so when I see when I see that and
[52:52] ministers are just something that draws
[52:54] me to that
[52:56] and I so I made a promise earlier early
[52:59] this year said brother we need to have
[53:01] you there was a time earlier this year
[53:02] we tried to get them and then some
[53:05] things changed if you had to go amen and
[53:07] preach for brother Westco and I think
[53:09] that all worked out just perfectly but
[53:11] God allowed it for him to come this time
[53:14] amen
[53:16] and I believe there's purpose a man for
[53:20] their being here at this time and we're
[53:22] under expectation for what the Lord has
[53:24] in store
[53:26] and so let's just let's welcome brother
[53:28] Joe hey man let's put our hands together
[53:29] let's welcome in this morning I would go
[53:35] into that but I'm not gonna I'm not
[53:36] gonna do that I want you to just come
[53:38] and I want you to take your liberty all
[53:40] right

[59:32] [Applause]
[59:35] and we're just so thankful for the work
[59:38] that God is doing there he's growing the
[59:41] chirps
[59:41] bringing in people and people are being
[59:44] baptized coming to believe this message
[59:47] and
[59:49] we're just so happy we're happy to be
[59:51] here and man don't don't mind me if I
[59:54] seem a little tired I'm not tired I have
[59:59] a lot of thoughts in my mind so I'm
[1:00:02] thinking we've been now this would be
[1:00:05] the third week in a row that we've been
[1:00:07] away from home on the weekend so we I've
[1:00:10] been having to speak different places
[1:00:13] and different things so this Wednesday
[1:00:15] night it was nice to be back in Ocala
[1:00:18] okay and the church there gave us a nice
[1:00:22] warm greeting me and sister Rebecca
[1:00:25] celebrated our seven year anniversary
[1:00:28] last night and also my sister and her
[1:00:36] husband celebrated their anniversary as
[1:00:38] well I suppose uh some of yall already
[1:00:44] know brother a brother a sister Bethany
[1:00:46] I'll just stand up for those who maybe
[1:00:49] don't know you there she told me not to
[1:00:55] do that you know I can't
[1:00:57] I can't help it but I'm so grateful that
[1:01:01] they're with us me and my sister we we
[1:01:04] have a close bond I don't think people
[1:01:05] are always realized but brothers and
[1:01:08] sisters obviously we grew up together so
[1:01:11] we share a very close-knit bond and now
[1:01:13] this year I think through everything
[1:01:15] that she and I both have gone through
[1:01:17] this year it's brought us closer
[1:01:19] together
[1:01:20] and she called me she knew we were going
[1:01:22] out of town weeks in advance but she
[1:01:24] called me I believe Friday Friday night
[1:01:27] and she said I want to go and support
[1:01:30] you know you and your wife sister
[1:01:32] Rebecca and I said ok ok and I talked it
[1:01:36] now on Saturday morning because you know
[1:01:37] we got on the road early and she was in
[1:01:40] bed and she's like y'all go ahead we we
[1:01:43] tired I said now we're gonna give y'all
[1:01:44] a hour to get ready so they got on up
[1:01:49] and came with us and again we just
[1:01:51] thankful that here this morning so many
[1:01:57] things God has been good you know I
[1:01:59] can't complain about anything I think
[1:02:04] that complaining first of all nobody is
[1:02:06] listening so you can you can complain
[1:02:11] about your problems all you want but
[1:02:13] it's not really gonna do you very very
[1:02:15] good but you know sometimes when you
[1:02:19] think about all the things you've gone
[1:02:20] through and what God brings you to you
[1:02:23] can't help but smile you can't help but
[1:02:26] be happy and I'm trying to contain my
[1:02:28] excitement this morning
[1:02:30] but I'll share with you why in a little
[1:02:33] while but I remember coming to the
[1:02:36] meetings we came to a couple of meetings
[1:02:38] this year here in February we came here
[1:02:42] I don't know the thing I know it was
[1:02:45] about love oh thank you thank you
[1:02:47] musician I'm sorry a little unorthodox
[1:02:49] today about if February we came here
[1:02:53] FEMA on love I can't remember exactly
[1:02:56] what it was but brother Dewayne was here
[1:02:59] and I believe it was brother Nathan
[1:03:01] Ericson was here and we were here had a
[1:03:04] good time and that is when I heard the
[1:03:07] theme of this churches year being the
[1:03:10] year of the incredible man and my what a
[1:03:15] time we had in those meetings I actually
[1:03:21] was able to hear both ministers preach
[1:03:23] and I remember there at the end of the
[1:03:27] service I came up and asked brother
[1:03:29] Dewayne to pray for me to receive a
[1:03:33] refilling of the Holy Ghost and may you
[1:03:36] know there's nothing wrong with asking
[1:03:37] for a refill another
[1:03:40] doesn't matter how old you get how much
[1:03:43] you think you know because every day you
[1:03:46] need the Holy Ghost every single day you
[1:03:51] know I'm not too proud to admit I need
[1:03:54] the Holy Ghost not a fact I needed this
[1:03:56] morning Lord amen and so I came up and I
[1:04:02] prayed and you know maybe some people
[1:04:05] thought it strange but I'm glad I
[1:04:07] received when I came up looking to
[1:04:10] receive and we came back again and in
[1:04:14] June but a jacket mentioned to me that
[1:04:17] he was having another brother Nathan
[1:04:20] Brian okay
[1:04:23] having him come down for a special
[1:04:26] service and I was telling them I was
[1:04:28] planning on coming down to speak for my
[1:04:31] grandfather and I thought it was you
[1:04:32] know a good time I say you know what
[1:04:34] i'ma go ahead and call my grandfather
[1:04:35] thing and see if that would be okay and
[1:04:38] when we can attend brother Jack's
[1:04:40] meetings and so my grandfather actually
[1:04:44] said to me we'll see we'll see
[1:04:47] so we I got in town and then we there
[1:04:52] was a brother from Ghana who was here
[1:04:56] visiting preparing leading up to the
[1:04:58] meeting so I think that was June 23rd
[1:05:00] and leading up to the meetings so my
[1:05:05] grandfather you know we were we had just
[1:05:08] got in town and we were sitting in the
[1:05:09] car brother Jack and he was helping
[1:05:12] get into the hotel there and he said oh
[1:05:14] you know what brother I have you speak
[1:05:16] on Sunday morning I said well honey I
[1:05:18] ain't speaking this weekend we're just
[1:05:20] going to brother Jack so we're just
[1:05:22] going to brother Jack's Church and then
[1:05:24] we'll attend my grandfather's Church
[1:05:25] that morning and of course by the time
[1:05:28] Sunday morning came my grandfather had a
[1:05:31] different leading so I did end up
[1:05:32] speaking at short notice I think you
[1:05:34] woke me up at 5 o'clock to let me know
[1:05:36] but while we were here and in the
[1:05:39] service here brother Nathan Bryant
[1:05:42] wonderful man of God hey man I begin to
[1:05:47] just kind of reminisce on some of the
[1:05:49] things that brother Jack had been
[1:05:51] telling me now I know y'all hear this
[1:05:52] noise I'm not gonna pretend like it's
[1:05:54] not there but we bout to make some noise
[1:05:59] in the brother brother Nathan he was
[1:06:06] telling me some testimonies and I
[1:06:08] believe brother Jack was telling me the
[1:06:10] testimony about sister time sister time
[1:06:12] you hear this morning okay then god
[1:06:15] bless your sister you get the scene this
[1:06:17] morning but brother trunk I saw you this
[1:06:20] morning so I you know he began to tell
[1:06:23] me this and man something begin to
[1:06:26] happen to me sister Rebekah couldn't
[1:06:29] make it
[1:06:29] wait no she made it this time she was
[1:06:32] able to make it she we were able to get
[1:06:33] her homework and stuff taking care of it
[1:06:35] something was just burning in me brother
[1:06:37] Jack it was burning heavy on me and I
[1:06:40] couldn't help myself
[1:06:41] he asked me to come up and sing a
[1:06:43] special something y'all were here and I
[1:06:45] just had to tell what I came to the
[1:06:46] service believe in the Lord for him I
[1:06:48] was believing God to bless us with a
[1:06:50] child and you know as soon as I did that
[1:06:54] now some of y'all sisters
[1:06:55] talking brother the Solomon yesterday
[1:06:56] and sister and Naomi and when I did that
[1:07:01] of course my wife wanted to shut down
[1:07:03] she ever me and she saw which she hadn't
[1:07:06] have done everybody and I gotta tell you
[1:07:14] outside of the church I recently told
[1:07:15] this to my sister
[1:07:16] I took some time away from the church
[1:07:20] there and you know Lord just kind of
[1:07:22] dealt with me on some things that I
[1:07:24] needed to deal with in my life
[1:07:26] and I came to realize something true
[1:07:28] y'all don't tell me nothing don't tell
[1:07:31] me nothing if you don't want me to tell
[1:07:32] nobody you don't want me to tell nobody
[1:07:37] don't tell me because if I feel if I got
[1:07:40] faith to believe God was on I'm gonna
[1:07:42] tell somebody you know I'm not ashamed
[1:07:45] you know I know some people you know I
[1:07:48] was reading a quote I'm not gonna pull
[1:07:50] it up just yet but I was reading a quote
[1:07:52] brother Branham he was in the service
[1:07:54] and he was saying how you know when you
[1:07:57] want God to do something for you got to
[1:07:59] respond quickly you know cuz he he he
[1:08:02] was talking about the sister named
[1:08:04] sister of Virginia and he was in the
[1:08:08] service and he said I'm he said he had
[1:08:10] his back turned and he was talking he
[1:08:13] said just like when the Lord came there
[1:08:16] in the tent with Abraham God had his
[1:08:18] back turned yeah but he could discern
[1:08:20] what was going on with Sarah that she
[1:08:22] was laughing and so brother Brennan
[1:08:24] turns his back and he said the same
[1:08:27] angel who was there in the tent is here
[1:08:29] now I'm gonna tell you something when I
[1:08:31] walk up to this pulpit I feel that way
[1:08:33] this morning
[1:08:34] the same angel who was in that tent is
[1:08:37] here this morning and I was reading a
[1:08:42] brother Brennan he turned his back and
[1:08:44] he said you sister over there in the
[1:08:45] corner he had his back turner and he
[1:08:48] said your name is a sister Virginia he
[1:08:52] said you have such an such condition he
[1:08:54] said do you believe God makes you well
[1:08:56] he said well then you receive it right
[1:08:58] now in the name of Jesus and then he
[1:08:59] said you mr. Anderson he said do you
[1:09:02] believe it he said Miss Emma saying you
[1:09:04] didn't respond quick enough so I moved
[1:09:07] away from you to the next person I hope
[1:09:13] we don't have any menaces I hope we're
[1:09:21] all sister Virginia no pun intended
[1:09:24] [Music]
[1:09:27] because that's our self on that night
[1:09:30] that I was here when I heard I heard
[1:09:32] enough testimony listen we didn't I did
[1:09:34] not need to hear brother Nathan speak I
[1:09:37] just needed to know what type of service
[1:09:39] it was gonna be and when I knew that I
[1:09:42] responded quickly
[1:09:44] I said listen soon as I get the mic I
[1:09:47] don't care what nobody think it's some
[1:09:49] time you got to come to church like that
[1:09:51] because if you try to be mr. Anderson be
[1:09:53] quiet keep it to yourself I don't want
[1:09:57] you're not gonna get it that way I don't
[1:10:01] want my name called you're not gonna hit
[1:10:03] it that way
[1:10:05] sometimes when God is moving you gotta
[1:10:08] jump in the pool listen you got if you
[1:10:14] don't move quick enough somebody jump in
[1:10:15] the pool for you there's somebody
[1:10:19] sitting beside you who I like winning I
[1:10:23] like winning when I was young I'm sorry
[1:10:28] I gotta take this Connelly lean into the
[1:10:32] message this morning when I was a kid I
[1:10:35] remember playing football I remember I
[1:10:38] played for a team brother Jack that was
[1:10:40] just losing every game and how was the
[1:10:43] running back and I hate losing I learned
[1:10:47] to hate losing while I played for that
[1:10:49] team and I remember they got to a point
[1:10:53] that the players just weren't motivated
[1:10:56] to play football no more and so the
[1:10:59] coach will only give me the ball every
[1:11:01] play the defense knew I was getting
[1:11:03] involved you know there's an unfair
[1:11:04] disadvantage because you know they they
[1:11:07] were just line up wherever they thought
[1:11:09] I was coming and I gotta tell you on
[1:11:12] something the devil he's lining up
[1:11:14] that's why he's got this music behind me
[1:11:17] and all this stuff going on he is trying
[1:11:20] to set up an unfair disadvantage because
[1:11:23] he know that there's somebody in this
[1:11:24] room who want to win
[1:11:26] I said that somebody in this room this
[1:11:28] morning who wants to win and somebody in
[1:11:32] this room is tired of losing they are
[1:11:35] determined to win I look at my folks
[1:11:39] when I was little blood I said coach I
[1:11:41] don't care if they all go here yeah I
[1:11:43] said I don't care if the team lose I
[1:11:46] said I'm gonna pack my stats if you
[1:11:50] listen to what I'm saying sure I said
[1:11:52] I'm gonna pack my sets you need the ball
[1:11:56] listen even though we lost I walked away
[1:11:58] with touchdown touchdown and listen I'm
[1:12:04] not trying to you know come off like I'm
[1:12:07] not a team player but this is not a
[1:12:10] group affair that we have in this
[1:12:11] morning if you don't want to win move
[1:12:16] out the way I kind of had my stats I've
[1:12:24] come to get my testimony and I will
[1:12:28] never forget I did not go out with the
[1:12:30] team to the bunch after the game because
[1:12:36] it was sad I know my dad took me and we
[1:12:39] celebrated what I did is I was gone I
[1:12:41] scored touchdown I scored three
[1:12:43] touchdowns scored I scored
[1:12:46] now for some people y'all thinking
[1:12:49] whoever Lajoie he's selfish I'm gonna
[1:12:54] tell you something when you get your
[1:12:56] blessing you'll owe me something
[1:12:57] [Applause]
[1:13:02] you're gonna get up and you're gonna
[1:13:04] tell it to so I'm gonna tell it I feel
[1:13:07] like telling it this morning but I want
[1:13:14] to share something with you all I wanna
[1:13:16] share survive that's all right y'all not
[1:13:17] tired are you
[1:13:18] I'm not tired get a lot of rest now
[1:13:21] during the week and so I get I'm
[1:13:23] energetic on the weekends and sometimes
[1:13:26] my wife gotta calm me down so I think it
[1:13:29] will be okay this morning but I want to
[1:13:30] share something with y'all brother Jack
[1:13:34] and that service there in June we came
[1:13:37] to the prayer line and you know we were
[1:13:41] already suffering some embarrassment
[1:13:43] there it felt like at least some but we
[1:13:47] pray with an eighth afraid over us and I
[1:13:49] don't know if you remember brother Jack
[1:13:50] Burke but the Nathan he said you know I
[1:13:53] believe that by this time next year you
[1:13:56] all will have children he said brother
[1:13:58] Jack when the child is born sending
[1:14:01] pictures of the baby so you got to make
[1:14:03] sure you do that
[1:14:07] [Applause]
[1:14:08] [Music]
[1:14:12] all right we left out of that service
[1:14:16] and when he said that you know my
[1:14:18] intellectual mind went into action and I
[1:14:21] wanted to tell each and every person
[1:14:23] here this morning when you ask God for
[1:14:26] something I actually said this one time
[1:14:28] I was preaching here don't expect God to
[1:14:30] give it to you the way that you asked
[1:14:32] for word because you don't ask God for a
[1:14:38] table when you give me a table God you
[1:14:42] ask God for a table he give you a tree
[1:14:47] [Applause]
[1:14:53] don't some people a they ask God for the
[1:14:57] see God had to deal with me on this
[1:14:59] brother Jack deeply God said to me so
[1:15:02] further to you know you're not a
[1:15:03] Christian this this kind of threw me
[1:15:05] hear what I'm saying this morning church
[1:15:07] he said Joe the pagans and the Bible the
[1:15:10] pagans identify them as Christians and
[1:15:13] that's where the phrase was corn
[1:15:14] christ-like and you continue to read the
[1:15:17] Bible you'll actually find that Jesus
[1:15:19] doesn't refer to us as Christians he
[1:15:21] calls us his sons and daughters source
[1:15:24] relational is not religious it's
[1:15:26] relationship and so he said Joe you're
[1:15:29] not just a Christian you know in the
[1:15:31] world they look at me they see Christian
[1:15:34] but he said Joe I'm your daddy
[1:15:37] you see daddy daddies are protective
[1:15:41] that is you know daddies would do
[1:15:44] anything for the truth now this is tough
[1:15:48] because when you think about there's
[1:15:50] some people who don't get to have their
[1:15:52] father figure present in their life but
[1:15:55] God he's a good father and I tell you
[1:15:59] something I begin to just think about
[1:16:02] daddy for a moment and I started to said
[1:16:06] man my dad you know if there was ever
[1:16:08] anything that was going on with me my
[1:16:11] dad would make sure that I was okay you
[1:16:13] know he'll be there you know maybe he
[1:16:16] wasn't there the way I would have liked
[1:16:18] because the parent knows what's best for
[1:16:20] the child
[1:16:21] so I begin to think about how a father
[1:16:25] should be towards his child and I begin
[1:16:27] to think about Adam and Eve in the
[1:16:29] garden and how God was a father to them
[1:16:31] and as I just begin thinking these
[1:16:35] thoughts in and going deep until he
[1:16:37] stopped God said to me he said son I
[1:16:39] want to give you what you want more than
[1:16:42] you want it he said well I'm your daddy
[1:16:45] so you got to ask me like I'm your daddy
[1:16:48] see some people pray to God like a
[1:16:51] Christian but they don't pray to God
[1:16:55] like he's their daddy man so you're
[1:17:02] praying you'll say God I need a new car
[1:17:06] listen there's another place in the
[1:17:08] Bible where God calls you an ambassador
[1:17:09] do you know ambassadors when they come
[1:17:11] to this country that they don't need a
[1:17:13] new car the country that they came from
[1:17:17] gives them the car already those are
[1:17:19] called additions those things come with
[1:17:22] the job we prank God give me a large
[1:17:26] house God give me a new car God give me
[1:17:30] that and God is saying listen that comes
[1:17:32] with the job why would I not give you
[1:17:35] that I'm your daddy I know you need that
[1:17:38] I'm going to give that to you so I had
[1:17:41] to change my looks I'm gonna tell you
[1:17:43] something it may be a little
[1:17:44] disappointing but when I came out that
[1:17:45] service brother Jack and I heard him say
[1:17:47] that I immediately thought god there's
[1:17:49] no way we're gonna have a baby that by
[1:17:51] this time next week because my thought
[1:17:54] process was take my monster bait there's
[1:18:00] 12 months in a year that mean I got
[1:18:03] three months to get this thing together
[1:18:06] and I was like man God I mean I need to
[1:18:09] be doing this going to the doctor doing
[1:18:12] this and talking to this person taking
[1:18:14] these supplements come on somebody and
[1:18:20] that's when God said to me I'm your
[1:18:22] daddy he said you gotta ask me like that
[1:18:24] so this is what I did I had been in
[1:18:27] communication with Bill Jack and I began
[1:18:30] to pray differently I I stopped asking
[1:18:33] God for a child and I say God let your
[1:18:37] kingdom come in my life and let your
[1:18:40] will be done that's how Jesus taught the
[1:18:43] disciples how to pray thy kingdom come
[1:18:45] thy will be done and then I said God
[1:18:49] help me to make my life match your word
[1:18:54] so that I can be raised
[1:18:57] when the addition coming because there's
[1:19:02] some people ask God for a car but
[1:19:04] they're not ready for the car you asking
[1:19:07] God for some people asking God for a
[1:19:09] house but you're not ready for a house
[1:19:12] you still in the apartment fees you
[1:19:15] ain't ready for a house yet you don't
[1:19:17] know how to you know why would God give
[1:19:20] you great responsibility you can't
[1:19:22] manage the small responsibility sees God
[1:19:25] in front of you so I started asking God
[1:19:30] I said God you give me the baptism of
[1:19:32] the Holy Ghost I get up and pray and I'd
[1:19:34] be crying out for the baptism of the
[1:19:36] Holy Ghost so I realized I'm not perfect
[1:19:39] and I realized that without the Holy
[1:19:41] Ghost or nothing so I would pray for
[1:19:44] this every single day even now still I
[1:19:47] keep that get up in the morning I pray
[1:19:49] like I don't have nothing and that god I
[1:19:52] need you to do everything for me I
[1:19:53] pretty like a desperate man and so I
[1:19:56] just was praying and praying and brother
[1:20:00] Jack and I we were keeping in
[1:20:02] communication I'll tell you y'all got a
[1:20:04] good pastor man I can come to the jacket
[1:20:10] almost any time of the day and as long
[1:20:12] as he's not out of the country he's
[1:20:14] calling back within an hour or he's
[1:20:16] answer right away I'm serious I actually
[1:20:20] tried 1 to 5 phone records to prove it
[1:20:22] God said this is impossible nobody can
[1:20:25] be it their phone like this all the time
[1:20:27] sometime I'm planning the voice message
[1:20:30] I'm about to leave but he still answers
[1:20:32] the phone and I'm like man forget the
[1:20:35] voice message let's talk and but I was
[1:20:39] talking with him and brother Jack him
[1:20:40] and I had to come top-1 one month in
[1:20:43] August and he said brother I want you to
[1:20:44] come and preach that was going to be the
[1:20:46] weekend of September 22nd and I was
[1:20:50] preparing to preach and right
[1:20:52] I was on my way here something came up
[1:20:55] and my grandfather needed me to preach
[1:20:57] at his church and this is what I didn't
[1:20:59] tell you that I thought I'd tell you the
[1:21:01] day really Zach so I got up and I
[1:21:06] preached and when I was done I sat down
[1:21:08] and I just stayed up on the pulpit for a
[1:21:11] moment and my grandfather called the
[1:21:14] ushers to come and to dismiss and when
[1:21:18] he did that the ushers came and then he
[1:21:20] told everybody wait a minute wait a
[1:21:22] minute he said everybody sit down
[1:21:24] and he said Joseph sister Rebecca y'all
[1:21:29] coming in he said I feel it pray for
[1:21:30] y'all right now so I said okay so I went
[1:21:34] I came up front and he said in the
[1:21:39] microphone he said church he said I'm
[1:21:43] believing for these two he said
[1:21:45] something just came on my heart it's on
[1:21:47] believin these two I want y'all to pray
[1:21:49] with me that God will give him a child
[1:21:51] right now he said before he said listen
[1:21:53] I know they've been pray for before he
[1:21:54] said but he's I just heard the Holy
[1:21:56] Spirit drop him me right now
[1:21:58] I'm soul sister Becca and she remembers
[1:22:01] we came up and we were prayed over and I
[1:22:06] brother Jack I got to tell you something
[1:22:09] sat different with me because I never
[1:22:11] seen brother let's go do this in the
[1:22:12] service before and after that I want to
[1:22:19] say about a week and a half later on
[1:22:21] October 3rd I got back home my wife was
[1:22:24] involved in a severe car accident she
[1:22:26] was hitting on her driver's side door
[1:22:28] and I was actually on the phone with her
[1:22:30] when it happened and my heart sank into
[1:22:33] my stomach
[1:22:34] I was so far away from home
[1:22:37] I didn't know what to do and she wasn't
[1:22:40] responding while I was on the phone and
[1:22:42] you know I started thinking about you
[1:22:44] know I lost my wife you know and so my
[1:22:47] heart was found I call my mom called my
[1:22:49] dad they were able to get there they
[1:22:51] were actually my mother was in the
[1:22:53] neighborhood where the car accident
[1:22:56] occurred and brother Jack I have
[1:22:59] pictures those you're who I want to see
[1:23:01] after the service I don't want to take
[1:23:03] up time showing that that this morning
[1:23:04] but she went on in between a stop sign a
[1:23:10] speed limit sign in the sewage drain and
[1:23:13] the car had just enough width to fit
[1:23:16] through there and then she stopped about
[1:23:19] less than five feet from somebody's
[1:23:21] front door in their yard and when I got
[1:23:25] to the scene and seen I said ain't no
[1:23:27] way I said that that was ordained by God
[1:23:31] that amount of space to happen that way
[1:23:34] and the fact that she got out the car
[1:23:37] and was able to walk we rushed we got
[1:23:49] over to the hospital and they asked us
[1:23:53] you know are you pregnant
[1:23:55] that's one of the first things that's
[1:23:56] what you know we've been tedious about
[1:23:59] these things no as far as we knew we
[1:24:02] were not pregnant and so of course they
[1:24:06] did their tests to make sure
[1:24:09] and they said nobody not pregnant they
[1:24:13] did the MRIs took the x-rays and after
[1:24:17] all that she was we went to an
[1:24:20] attorney's office they got us in touch
[1:24:21] with a chiropractor
[1:24:23] she has to see the chiropractor three
[1:24:25] times a week she's still seeing the
[1:24:27] chiropractor and they were doing these
[1:24:29] they called Tenzing electric shocks and
[1:24:33] things and because they thought you know
[1:24:35] we we're not pregnant
[1:24:37] the tests are showing negative but my
[1:24:41] wife sister Rebecca she woke me up on
[1:24:43] Friday October 25th and the way she woke
[1:24:47] me up I thought that something bad
[1:24:50] happened I really I did and she woke me
[1:24:54] up and I was in a panic
[1:24:55] she said so we're pregnant when she took
[1:25:09] the test I said let's take you some more
[1:25:12] times because I know what the doctor
[1:25:19] said in the hospital ain't no way I said
[1:25:24] come on we pregnant I brought that
[1:25:25] friend I was full of emotion because I
[1:25:28] was trying to figure it I said how can
[1:25:29] we go from not being pregnant to just
[1:25:31] all of a sudden being pregnant I don't
[1:25:33] know where when all this stuff that's
[1:25:34] going on so we went on our anniversary
[1:25:39] trip because that was coming up and
[1:25:42] before we went sister Rebecca lost her
[1:25:45] passport yes I said it
[1:25:47] I'm sorry I'll have to deal with that
[1:25:49] later she lost it a week before we were
[1:25:53] to fly out so we had to come to Miami
[1:25:56] and we drove through here and say what
[1:26:00] brother Westco in Miami got her passport
[1:26:02] we were driving back home we were
[1:26:04] passing Palm Beach actually right by the
[1:26:06] church and for the Westco called me
[1:26:12] Joseph I could just picture him kind of
[1:26:15] scratching he said listen this a couple
[1:26:21] years ago I had giving y'all some
[1:26:23] instructions to younger people careful
[1:26:26] how you interpret it don't get a hotel
[1:26:28] lock yourself in that get rid of the
[1:26:30] phones and the TV and don't come out
[1:26:32] until you have a baby
[1:26:35] yes I'll do that I said yeah we've done
[1:26:43] that a couple of times she said I want
[1:26:48] you to do it again
[1:26:49] I said grande he said keep doing it so I
[1:26:56] said all right I said all right he said
[1:26:59] I don't know he said I so I don't know
[1:27:00] what I did he said something made me
[1:27:03] call you and tell you this now we did
[1:27:07] not know we were pregnant at this time
[1:27:09] this was the Wednesday before the Friday
[1:27:11] Rebecca woke me up that he called and so
[1:27:16] when she woke me up that Friday I said
[1:27:18] granddaddy just called us two days ago
[1:27:22] and he said something made him call us
[1:27:26] and we didn't even know what that
[1:27:28] something was
[1:27:29] I believe that that's when life was
[1:27:32] taking place
[1:27:33] we were told before that no no no no no
[1:27:39] so they're not of course i'm bugling cuz
[1:27:42] you know you try not to you try to be
[1:27:45] calm because you know there's certain
[1:27:47] things you gotta make sure things are
[1:27:48] okay man i Rebecca let me call but Jack
[1:27:52] and the car brothers Jack I said just
[1:27:55] let me talk to him hey just wait I said
[1:27:58] well let me talk to my granddaddy let me
[1:28:00] talk wait how like we
[1:28:04] I said you know my favorite verse
[1:28:09] description but guys they're you know
[1:28:10] they that wait upon the Lord and they I
[1:28:12] am being impatient I'm like hey come on
[1:28:14] I said listen I said if it's there I'm
[1:28:16] certain that everything's gonna be fine
[1:28:19] she she said just wait alright I waited
[1:28:24] I waited I passed my test
[1:28:28] it was a test I finally I caught up with
[1:28:32] a jack and I shared the good news with
[1:28:33] brother Jack and we just we've been so
[1:28:38] excited our family there's been
[1:28:39] overwhelming emotions um because we were
[1:28:43] told certain things by doctors about how
[1:28:45] we possibly could not have had kids and
[1:28:47] so it doesn't really matter what the
[1:28:50] doctor says at this point because when
[1:28:53] and if some of y'all don't take this the
[1:28:54] wrong way but when Jesus say yes nobody
[1:28:59] can say no is that so if God says I'm
[1:29:06] gonna give it to you I don't care if
[1:29:07] everybody else say ain't no way we gonna
[1:29:09] get in the way we allow it to happen God
[1:29:11] say you gonna give it to you he's gonna
[1:29:12] give it to you rest assured now I went
[1:29:20] two weeks ago and preached for brother
[1:29:23] Wesco again we share our testimony there
[1:29:26] and at the end of the service sister
[1:29:32] Gabriella I don't know how many of y'all
[1:29:33] know her she's just graduated from very
[1:29:36] University with her master's degree and
[1:29:39] she was there and she was in the service
[1:29:42] that brother Wes Co I had everybody sit
[1:29:45] down so that he can pray for us and when
[1:29:47] I was telling a testimony at that time
[1:29:50] two weeks ago we were 10 weeks and three
[1:29:53] days pregnant sister Rebecca was I'm not
[1:29:56] pregnant
[1:29:59] how I get picked on because I look like
[1:30:02] I'm gaining weight but I reviewed and
[1:30:03] I'm Catherine huh huh she came to me and
[1:30:09] she said brother Joe when you said that
[1:30:10] she said something dropped in my spirit
[1:30:13] and the Lord told me to open my calendar
[1:30:15] and go back to when you were here the
[1:30:17] last time and she said I counted week to
[1:30:21] week to week and she said brother Joe
[1:30:23] that's the exact amount of time you've
[1:30:25] been pregnant says brother what's go
[1:30:27] pray for you she said brother Joe says I
[1:30:30] I believe that you actually conceived
[1:30:33] the moment after that prayer and when
[1:30:37] when I thought about it I said whoa I
[1:30:40] didn't even count all the way to the
[1:30:42] date all the way to the day and I this
[1:30:45] is what I told him back I said sir I
[1:30:48] appreciate you know that I said but I
[1:30:51] look at it like this God was testing our
[1:30:54] faith in February when we came to these
[1:30:56] meetings in June when we came here I I
[1:31:01] wasn't scared I wasn't ashamed my faith
[1:31:05] was put on the line even here and God
[1:31:09] needed to know right before I give this
[1:31:11] to you are you ready for this this
[1:31:14] morning that's kind of what my sermons
[1:31:16] gonna be about it I'm not gonna keep you
[1:31:17] longer I just kept you long enough in
[1:31:18] this testimony but when you ask God for
[1:31:23] something
[1:31:24] there's a timeline Abraham and Sarah
[1:31:27] wait a long time but the bottom line is
[1:31:32] they were patient and out of I'm sorry
[1:31:36] Abraham he he didn't stagger he stayed
[1:31:39] with the test no when he first heard the
[1:31:41] news he laughed you know like I like
[1:31:45] what I did when I was here I heard news
[1:31:47] oh my god - three I only got three
[1:31:51] months I figured out but that's not
[1:31:53] what's important what's important is
[1:31:56] being patient and being faithful to God
[1:31:59] stand with God's Word until the promise
[1:32:02] comes to pass and sometimes that's tough
[1:32:05] that's hard
[1:32:06] sometimes you got to cry there's many
[1:32:08] nights I watched my wife cry I several
[1:32:11] months I didn't know what I was gonna do
[1:32:13] but God gave us the strength and the
[1:32:17] courage keep believing keep believing
[1:32:20] only believe only believe am i my little
[1:32:23] sister she's a witness other stuff that
[1:32:25] we went through so only believe Church
[1:32:28] don't doubt just believe God can do
[1:32:32] anything if God can give Mary a child
[1:32:41] without a man even touching her and
[1:32:46] there's nothing impossible for God I
[1:32:50] don't care the doctors Ida told us that
[1:32:52] we couldn't have kids at all if God
[1:32:54] could give Mary a child without a man
[1:32:59] touching her I mean that that's the
[1:33:02] whole foundation of our faith today our
[1:33:06] faith can you believe that you are here
[1:33:09] because you believe that story

[1:39:57] it's not just by chance God but you know
[1:40:01] all things God are praying every heart
[1:40:06] this year Lord God if they have to

[1:40:15] that that's the word is going forth they

[1:40:20] give God me behind your cross but may
[1:40:25] you speak your words through me to your
[1:40:27] people once again we pray we ask it in
[1:40:29] Jesus name Amen and amen you can be
[1:40:33] seated this morning this morning I would
[1:40:37] like to use a thought
[1:40:40] God's manufactured product of success
[1:40:44] hey man God's manufactured product
[1:40:48] of success I want to say something this
[1:40:51] morning you are not a mistake every
[1:40:56] person that is born is born to fulfill a
[1:41:01] mission a mission is an important
[1:41:06] assignment that means that if you exist
[1:41:11] and if you're breathing this morning
[1:41:13] that God
[1:41:14] he needed you to fulfill an assignment a
[1:41:19] lot of times we go through life and
[1:41:22] we're floating through life trying to
[1:41:25] figure out God why am I here well what's
[1:41:30] my purpose for being here especially
[1:41:32] when things are kind of negative or it
[1:41:34] seems negatively you're like God why why
[1:41:38] didn't you put me here God said I put
[1:41:43] you here because I had a problem in
[1:41:45] order for there to be a mission in order
[1:41:48] for there to have been an assignment
[1:41:49] they had to have been a problem and God
[1:41:53] birthed you to solve the problem so you
[1:41:59] are not a mistake
[1:42:01] but the venom says now there's something
[1:42:05] that's wrong so he identifies that there
[1:42:08] is a problem he says and in the
[1:42:11] beginning God has created you to be the
[1:42:14] master of every circumstance that's the
[1:42:18] origin it's authentic that's God's word
[1:42:21] there was nothing nothing could happen
[1:42:25] unless you was the master of it that's
[1:42:31] what you were created for so everybody
[1:42:35] who's here this morning you will create
[1:42:38] it to master a problem oh that makes you
[1:42:44] that should make you feel different I
[1:42:46] don't feel like the biggest person in
[1:42:49] the room this morning but I feel like a
[1:42:51] master because there are situations that
[1:42:56] are going to come your way but you must
[1:43:00] understand that God created you to
[1:43:04] master those situations your problem is
[1:43:09] not my problem because I am not the
[1:43:12] master of your situation I'm not the
[1:43:16] master of your tense some of you all may
[1:43:19] be struggling with a test that is harder
[1:43:22] than my test maybe you feel like your
[1:43:25] problem is harder than mine and I come
[1:43:26] to tell you something this morning it is
[1:43:32] but your problem is not my problem and
[1:43:35] if I had to overcome your test I will
[1:43:39] fail
[1:43:42] if you have to overcome my test you will
[1:43:47] fail because you are not created to
[1:43:50] master my circumstance you were created
[1:43:55] to master your circumstance there are
[1:44:03] some people who will spend more time
[1:44:05] trying to solve other people's problems
[1:44:08] we got so many teachers therapists
[1:44:12] doctors trying to solve people's
[1:44:14] problems but I've come to tell you
[1:44:16] something this morning there's only one
[1:44:19] person who is created and designed to
[1:44:23] master the problem
[1:44:24] that is you you can either choose to
[1:44:28] believe it or you can choose to
[1:44:31] disbelieve it but if you choose to
[1:44:34] believe that you are the master then you
[1:44:36] have spoken word authority in you this
[1:44:39] morning Jesus on the boat with the
[1:44:42] disciples sight was going to say master
[1:44:44] you notice they didn't call him Jesus
[1:44:46] because they realized that this problem
[1:44:51] was not their problem
[1:44:56] Jesus told them let us go to the other
[1:45:00] side so if there is a problem that
[1:45:04] prevents us from going to the other side
[1:45:06] it is not the disciples problem so the
[1:45:10] disciples they go to Jesus and the first
[1:45:13] thing they say they say master a lot of
[1:45:19] people they take that to say you know
[1:45:20] what the disciples were just scary cats
[1:45:22] but I think that the disciples also had
[1:45:24] a little bit of revelation they said
[1:45:28] master do you care if we die now if they
[1:45:35] call him master there's got to be a
[1:45:37] master that responds Peter could not
[1:45:40] respond John could not respond to master
[1:45:45] James could not respond to master only
[1:45:48] the master could respond to the question
[1:45:52] that was being asked so Jesus he wakes
[1:45:54] up and he looks at them and he says o ye
[1:45:59] of little faith
[1:46:00] and the reason he says they have little
[1:46:02] faith is because they came to him
[1:46:05] doubting the situation that they would
[1:46:09] not be able to go to the other side
[1:46:11] because of the circumstance but they
[1:46:14] understood the circumstance was not
[1:46:16] their problem all they needed to do was
[1:46:18] our faith there are some people that are
[1:46:22] more concerned with what's going on in
[1:46:24] their life than the amount of faith that
[1:46:28] they have because they're comparing
[1:46:31] their situation to other people
[1:46:36] you say well this person has that so I
[1:46:41] should have that this person is doing
[1:46:45] that so I should be doing that and I
[1:46:46] come in I couldn't be transparent I used
[1:46:49] to do the same thing so maybe that's
[1:46:52] about a couple of months ago I used to
[1:46:53] say oh man
[1:46:54] that person is successful and I'm still
[1:46:57] over here doing this God said to me he
[1:47:00] said what is success success is not
[1:47:08] measured based upon what other people
[1:47:09] have and what you don't have success is
[1:47:19] how you are able to complete the mission
[1:47:23] that God gave to you I think God wanted
[1:47:37] something to fly so what did he do he
[1:47:39] created Birds God wanted something to
[1:47:42] swim so what did he do he didn't make
[1:47:45] you brother Solomon I don't know you
[1:47:47] might be an old case swimmer but that's
[1:47:49] not your purpose so brother if we put
[1:47:53] you in water and let you stay there
[1:47:55] under the water long enough you'll stop
[1:47:59] swimming
[1:48:02] because that is not your purpose but
[1:48:05] when God wanted someone to swim
[1:48:08] he created a fish and that fish its
[1:48:12] purpose is to swim that's why if you
[1:48:16] take that fish out of his element long
[1:48:19] enough and it can't fulfill its purpose
[1:48:23] it will die when you do not fulfill your
[1:48:27] purpose God will take your life I was
[1:48:35] reading a place where brother brandon
[1:48:36] was talking about this minister who was
[1:48:39] preaching and all of a sudden he said it
[1:48:40] seemed like the minister had backslidden
[1:48:42] and begin to go to the bars and things
[1:48:44] of that nature you all know what I'm
[1:48:46] talking about you study your message he
[1:48:49] said then something happened he lost his
[1:48:51] life and he thought god no that man was
[1:48:55] a minister God so for the relevee said I
[1:48:59] would rather take your life before you
[1:49:02] ruin it because you're trying to run
[1:49:05] away from your purpose I went in the
[1:49:07] scripture I looked at Jonah Jonah tried
[1:49:10] to run away from his purpose he was
[1:49:14] created for a purpose and that was to
[1:49:16] deliver a message and Jonah tried to run
[1:49:19] in the opposite direction from the
[1:49:21] message he was called to deliver and
[1:49:24] when he did that God had to come get him
[1:49:27] because he's too far out of his element
[1:49:29] and if he had a stayed out of his
[1:49:32] element for too long it would have cost
[1:49:34] him his life so God sometimes we look at
[1:49:38] situations and we say God why are you
[1:49:40] doing this to me anybody ever asked that
[1:49:43] question God why am i suffering with
[1:49:46] this condition God why am I going
[1:49:49] through this problem everybody else
[1:49:51] seems to be doing just fine but God you
[1:49:53] got this happening to me
[1:49:55] God saying because I created you with
[1:49:58] purpose
[1:50:00] there's a purpose in your suffering
[1:50:03] there's a purpose in your tests
[1:50:05] I recently defiled out something that
[1:50:10] I'm still studying but I think I'll
[1:50:12] share it with you if y'all don't mind
[1:50:14] this morning I recently discovered that
[1:50:16] God needs me to be successful I want to
[1:50:23] say something to you this morning God
[1:50:24] needs you
[1:50:26] oh man look at the person besides you
[1:50:29] really quit even if it's a little kid
[1:50:31] just look at them you might think
[1:50:33] they're just any old person you've been
[1:50:36] seeing these st. people Sunday after
[1:50:39] Sunday but the person you just looked at
[1:50:43] God needs them to be successful even you
[1:50:49] he needs you to be successful the reason
[1:50:57] God needs us to be successful is because
[1:50:59] success is built into the creation by
[1:51:03] every manufacturer I want to use a type
[1:51:07] here success is important to every
[1:51:10] manufacturer this morning I have my iPad
[1:51:11] up here some of y'all may have iPad or
[1:51:14] however you use devices or take notes
[1:51:16] but there's an image on this iPad some
[1:51:20] of y'all are familiar with it looks like
[1:51:21] a Apple has been bitten and that image
[1:51:24] is the image of the company now before
[1:51:27] that image is put on the device the
[1:51:30] company had to test that iPad before it
[1:51:34] left the factory
[1:51:35] now they had to make sure that
[1:51:38] everything necessary for that iPad
[1:51:41] success was built into that iPad the
[1:51:45] prophet of God said in 1962 perseverant
[1:51:48] he said that every Sun every child that
[1:51:52] comes to God has got to be tested
[1:51:54] that's a cool if you don't want to be
[1:51:58] tested you have
[1:51:59] permission to leave right now because if
[1:52:04] you say god I just want to be blessed
[1:52:06] but I don't want to be tested you're in
[1:52:07] the wrong place God is not in that
[1:52:09] business this morning God does not
[1:52:12] create prototypes on me
[1:52:14] all of God's prototypes must be tested
[1:52:19] so he says that every child that comes
[1:52:21] to God has got to be tested God will
[1:52:24] move down in a meeting and show great
[1:52:26] signs and wonders but you've got to be
[1:52:29] tested to see if you really believe it
[1:52:30] or not so we say you know I'm looking
[1:52:34] for God to do the incredible god I want
[1:52:37] I need incredible blessings in my life
[1:52:39] God I need an incredible next level move
[1:52:41] in my life well I Got News for you the
[1:52:44] more incredible you are looking for the
[1:52:47] greater the tests that you're asking for
[1:52:49] oh man I gave me the chills this morning
[1:52:55] because I think I've been married for
[1:52:58] seven years and never ever tried not to
[1:53:02] have kids but God said you want
[1:53:04] something incredible I got to create an
[1:53:06] incredible circumstance
[1:53:09] some people want God to bless them way
[1:53:12] up here but you don't want your tests
[1:53:13] way up there
[1:53:16] God is not in that kind of business so
[1:53:20] after the product is tested on who puts
[1:53:23] the iPad in a box then they put
[1:53:26] something very important inside of that
[1:53:29] box they cover it with a book so you
[1:53:33] can't see it the manufacturer hides the
[1:53:37] product underneath the book but it's for
[1:53:41] a reason
[1:53:42] yeah now the book is called the manual
[1:53:48] now I want to ask a quick question right
[1:53:51] here I'm not trying to pick on anybody
[1:53:52] how many of you all read that manual
[1:53:54] before you turn your device on raising
[1:53:57] hands don't lie cuz we're gonna find out
[1:53:59] the truth later the whole thing you read
[1:54:01] the whole manual for you take nobody
[1:54:04] right nobody don't worry I don't either
[1:54:06] so we're all in the same boat together
[1:54:09] I'll be honest with you I think that I
[1:54:11] know more about the product then they
[1:54:13] know sometimes I turn it on and start
[1:54:15] getting to work and then have you ever
[1:54:17] turned on that iPad you're working with
[1:54:19] all of a sudden you discovered a feature
[1:54:20] that you didn't know about and you're
[1:54:22] like oh now you go and tell somebody
[1:54:26] iPad got this on it but it's only a
[1:54:30] surprise to you it's not a surprise to
[1:54:31] the manufacturer
[1:54:33] because the manufacturer put that in the
[1:54:35] manual if you hadn't read the manual you
[1:54:41] would have known about the features you
[1:54:44] would have known about the promises you
[1:54:47] would have known about the product but
[1:54:49] you put this to the side because you
[1:54:51] wanted this and there's some people that
[1:54:56] do that with the message they say I
[1:55:00] don't need that book I don't need that
[1:55:01] sermon I don't need that quote we don't
[1:55:04] need any quotes I just need the product
[1:55:08] but how can you know anything about the
[1:55:10] product without the revelation of the
[1:55:13] manual now the word may was broken up
[1:55:19] into two parts
[1:55:20] you have menu and one menu means to make
[1:55:25] or to create wall means to think so
[1:55:30] manual simply means the makers mind so
[1:55:35] the manual in the box is the makers mind
[1:55:40] on paper this is what God says I know
[1:55:50] the thoughts anybody want to know the
[1:55:54] thoughts the only way to know the
[1:55:57] thoughts is to have to make his mind on
[1:56:03] paper when you open a box you don't see
[1:56:09] the iPad you see the manual you see the
[1:56:12] makers mind on paper the manual always
[1:56:15] says before opening this product please
[1:56:18] read it says it
[1:56:21] it tells you what to do before you turn
[1:56:26] it on how many people do what it says
[1:56:32] and no we don't we don't just this but
[1:56:37] it happens in our spirits of walk god
[1:56:39] says before you go to bed
[1:56:41] read this before you go to work play
[1:56:46] this with God I got to get to work I'm
[1:56:51] running late this morning and then we
[1:56:56] say oh but God I want you to do and God
[1:57:00] is not a sugar daddy
[1:57:04] God does not move when you say move
[1:57:08] God moves when he feels like moving and
[1:57:12] he's so smarter about how he moves
[1:57:14] because God he will wait sometimes until
[1:57:17] you end up in a situation similar to
[1:57:19] prison but so that he can get your
[1:57:22] attention I don't know why I'm saying
[1:57:24] this but God has a way of locking people
[1:57:26] up into sitting their situation where
[1:57:29] you can't go left
[1:57:30] you can't go right anybody felt like
[1:57:33] they couldn't go to their friends
[1:57:35] because the friends can't help them
[1:57:37] anybody ever thought I can't go to my
[1:57:40] family because in this situation family
[1:57:43] can't help me
[1:57:44] everybody anybody ever felt like I can't
[1:57:46] go to mama because mama can't help me I
[1:57:49] can't go to that God will lock you up
[1:57:52] some time just to get you to read the
[1:57:56] man everybody okay this morning alright
[1:58:07] y'all with me y'all with me now
[1:58:13] we don't read the book we don't read the
[1:58:17] book we don't know the mind of the
[1:58:19] manufacturer concerning the product
[1:58:22] Psalm chapter 139 and verse 17 and 18 it
[1:58:27] says how precious also are that thoughts
[1:58:29] unto me O God how great is the sum of
[1:58:33] them if I should count them they are
[1:58:35] more number than the sin when I awake
[1:58:38] I'm still with thee did you know that
[1:58:41] you're always on God's mind you can keep
[1:58:43] that up there did you know you're always
[1:58:45] on God's mind but how would you know
[1:58:49] this if you don't read the manual he is
[1:58:53] always thinking about you when I first
[1:58:57] started dating sister Rebecca I remember
[1:59:00] I could not get her out of my mind no
[1:59:03] matter what I was doing I was always
[1:59:04] thinking about the next time I would
[1:59:06] pick up the phone or the next time I
[1:59:09] would see sister Rebecca I was always
[1:59:11] saying as so much so that when my phone
[1:59:15] would ring I would actually answer
[1:59:16] because sometimes and if everybody in
[1:59:18] this church will be honest sometimes
[1:59:19] their phone rings but if it's not who
[1:59:21] they want to talk to they don't answer
[1:59:26] in that moment I'm not trying to talk
[1:59:29] bad about you but you might be in the
[1:59:31] middle of something or whatever like
[1:59:32] that and you see the phone ring and it
[1:59:34] says brother Smith Eli yeah I don't
[1:59:36] really feel like talking to brother
[1:59:37] Smith today so you don't answer the
[1:59:39] phone but I remember every time I saw
[1:59:43] Rebecca Allison pop up on my phone I was
[1:59:47] scramble I was running if I was in a
[1:59:49] room if I was at work whatever I was
[1:59:51] doing I go run out the back and go
[1:59:52] trying to answer that phone and do you
[1:59:55] know that God does that every time you
[1:59:57] call every time you call he ain't just
[2:00:02] looking at it and ignoring it God is not
[2:00:05] like as we think is we think that he's
[2:00:09] not answering because we did not get the
[2:00:11] answer we were looking for in that
[2:00:13] moment but God did give you an answer
[2:00:18] you just have to open the manual he said
[2:00:24] I giving you all the answers to every
[2:00:26] circumstance but just because you don't
[2:00:29] see something in front of you does not
[2:00:30] mean I did not give you the answer so
[2:00:34] you got to read the man I hope I'm
[2:00:36] encouraging you to open your Bibles this
[2:00:38] morning I hope I'm encouraging you to
[2:00:40] open those message books because you
[2:00:43] can't have one without the other because
[2:00:45] you got a manual other manual help us
[2:00:52] God you can't stop thinking about you
[2:00:55] because he you are his product and God
[2:00:58] is in love with you when you in love
[2:01:01] what a person that shows you just can't
[2:01:04] there's something in you just can't stop
[2:01:06] loving that person I you know I've had
[2:01:10] the opportunity to switch jobs here
[2:01:12] recently and I get a lot more free time
[2:01:15] and no matter how many homes are going
[2:01:19] to or how many people that I meet every
[2:01:22] time I am done I'm always thinking about
[2:01:24] sister Rebecca
[2:01:26] sister Rebeka sister Rebecca now I'm
[2:01:28] thinking about sister Rebecca and our
[2:01:30] child but I'm always thinking about
[2:01:32] sister Rebecca so much so that I have
[2:01:34] been embarrassing sister Rebecca here
[2:01:36] recently I pop up to her job flowers and
[2:01:40] food all the time she probably wishes I
[2:01:43] had a real full-time job but I'm always
[2:01:47] popping up and I'll tell the girl at the
[2:01:50] front desk not she knows you know we got
[2:01:52] this thing down now
[2:01:53] when I first came to have to be like I
[2:01:55] need you to call Ben you want me to tell
[2:01:56] her you're here I'm like no no don't
[2:01:57] tell her I'm here I'd be hiding behind
[2:01:59] the wall so this last time I came in
[2:02:01] there bring Zach and I had some
[2:02:03] watermelon and some roses and I walked
[2:02:06] in there she was like okay I'm not gonna
[2:02:08] tell you I'm not gonna tell you here so
[2:02:12] Rebecca comes out and of course oh my
[2:02:16] god you keep coming around I'm told I
[2:02:26] said I can't help it cuz I can't stop
[2:02:28] thinking about you because I love you
[2:02:31] that's how God feels about you Church
[2:02:34] God loves you
[2:02:37] somebody needs to hear that this morning
[2:02:40] God loves you and actually he loves you
[2:02:46] more than that he just got arenas menu
[2:02:49] and find out when you go to sleep David
[2:02:53] said he's still thinking about you when
[2:02:56] you wake up David said he's still
[2:02:58] thinking about you that's something but
[2:03:02] we don't read the book we don't know the
[2:03:04] mind of a manufacturer concerning his
[2:03:06] product the book is simply a book of
[2:03:10] promises and laws that's what this is
[2:03:13] promises and laws promises and laws
[2:03:16] promises and law when you take the
[2:03:19] manual out the first thing you'll see
[2:03:22] when you open it is a photograph of the
[2:03:25] product
[2:03:26] if the photograph of the product does
[2:03:29] not match what's in the box you have the
[2:03:31] wrong product sisters brothers if your
[2:03:37] image does not match this image it's the
[2:03:41] wrong product there's a defect in the
[2:03:43] product the product then must be sent
[2:03:46] back to the manufacturer so you'll see
[2:03:52] some promises if you keep looking in it
[2:03:55] the product will perform like this the
[2:03:57] product is guaranteed to do this that's
[2:03:59] what you see when you open it and they
[2:04:01] have a long list of promises but when
[2:04:03] you get to the next page then it says
[2:04:06] follow these instructions in other words
[2:04:09] obey these laws now I didn't know all
[2:04:13] this because I threw away my iPad menu
[2:04:16] on the first iPad I got when I got the
[2:04:19] next iPad there were things that I saw
[2:04:22] in the manual that I didn't even know
[2:04:25] about the iPad now after this service I
[2:04:29] know everybody from now on when you get
[2:04:31] a product I already know something y'all
[2:04:34] gonna say brother Joe you read the
[2:04:36] manual there are some things that you
[2:04:41] just don't know like I did not know that
[2:04:43] if you press the power button five times
[2:04:46] there SOS y'all knew that right but
[2:04:53] somebody told you that you didn't know
[2:04:54] it on your own don't do that to me don't
[2:04:56] do that to me everybody you're late you
[2:05:00] should've read the main
[2:05:04] you didn't know that unless somebody
[2:05:06] told you because you didn't read the
[2:05:08] manual right you're not better than me I
[2:05:10] know how it works I did not know that if
[2:05:16] you press the home button and the lock
[2:05:18] button at the same time add new screen
[2:05:20] so did you know that you knew that
[2:05:22] somebody told you right you read you
[2:05:28] accidentally came across hey that's okay
[2:05:34] as long as as long as you figure it out
[2:05:36] and then you know we'll work with that
[2:05:38] but you wouldn't had to either figure it
[2:05:40] out if you haven't just read the manual
[2:05:42] so these are there's instructions it
[2:05:44] tells you first I was looking at the
[2:05:46] instruct do not operate near open heat
[2:05:50] Jean oh that was in the manual do not
[2:05:53] operate in there open heat you take it
[2:05:55] out to that campfire meeting that you
[2:05:57] guys are having you pull your iPad out
[2:06:00] it tells you not to do that that's it in
[2:06:05] there do not operate under water did
[2:06:09] y'all know that yeah
[2:06:11] some of y'all said Joe that was common
[2:06:13] sense do not operate on the water
[2:06:17] I like this next one do not attempt to
[2:06:20] fix it yourself
[2:06:24] [Applause]
[2:06:28] you know how many times I've tried that
[2:06:30] one it's my screen you're stuck or
[2:06:33] button gets jammed I'm like and I'm
[2:06:35] gonna take this thing apart I'm gonna
[2:06:37] figure this thing out
[2:06:39] I'm gonna do that do not attempt to fix
[2:06:43] it yourself so you got some laws that
[2:06:47] tell you what not to do then the next
[2:06:49] page tells you what to do it tells you
[2:06:51] how to make sure that this product
[2:06:53] succeeds and then you get you know to
[2:06:57] the last few pages and you'll see
[2:06:59] something really strange that we're
[2:07:00] going to talk about but before that when
[2:07:03] it tells you how to use this product to
[2:07:05] make it succeed
[2:07:06] what it's telling you is it's telling
[2:07:08] you how to use the product in such a way
[2:07:11] I know this isn't business school which
[2:07:13] I'll bear with me
[2:07:14] it's telling you how to use the product
[2:07:16] in such a way that it successfully
[2:07:20] fulfills your mission now there's things
[2:07:28] that when you use it outside of these
[2:07:30] parameters that there's a possibility
[2:07:33] that the product is going to deteriorate
[2:07:37] anybody ever had something and then you
[2:07:39] had it for like two three years and then
[2:07:40] something's just not working with it and
[2:07:42] now you're like I'm gonna go toss it now
[2:07:44] and get up and get something else well
[2:07:46] my house I'm kind of picked on about
[2:07:49] this Bethany and probably tell y'all
[2:07:51] after surgery but I'm very meticulous I
[2:07:52] don't like people to touch my stuff I
[2:07:54] will buy you your own drink I will get
[2:07:57] you your own food I will get you your
[2:07:59] own iPhone your own iPad you cannot
[2:08:02] share my stuff because I use my stuff in
[2:08:06] such a way that it successfully fulfills
[2:08:10] the mission that I need it's like the
[2:08:13] computers at home you gotta be careful
[2:08:15] not to let your kids on it because then
[2:08:16] I do let your kids on it for too long
[2:08:17] what happened viruses malware and you
[2:08:22] know it can't be you because when you
[2:08:25] use it the only thing you do is go to
[2:08:26] the voice of God recording a website you
[2:08:29] go to Bible gateway com
[2:08:31] do your homework and go to bed there's
[2:08:33] no way there's no way that this virus
[2:08:36] was put here about you so when somebody
[2:08:39] else comes along and uses it differently
[2:08:42] for a different mission then all of a
[2:08:45] sudden you ever try to give people
[2:08:48] advice that work for you oh man I have I
[2:08:55] have people do this to me and I've done
[2:08:57] it to them and yet most cases it works a
[2:09:01] little bit but it never completely works
[2:09:03] the way it's playing you know why
[2:09:04] because there are no two situations
[2:09:06] exactly the same well when I was doing
[2:09:10] this we did this and this helped me that
[2:09:13] might work for you but I am NOT you so I
[2:09:19] can't necessarily I can heed your advice
[2:09:21] but I may not be able to use your advice
[2:09:23] to successfully complete this mission
[2:09:27] make sense let's say what I'm saying I
[2:09:30] hope y'all can understand that yeah so
[2:09:33] now and I'm going on I'm not being ready
[2:09:35] to be much longer I'm actually coming to
[2:09:37] a close this next part is kind of
[2:09:39] strange in these last few pages it gives
[2:09:42] you a warranty you all are familiar with
[2:09:45] warranty
[2:09:46] gives you a warranty and a guarantee the
[2:09:49] manufacturer guarantees that the product
[2:09:51] will perform exactly how they promised
[2:09:54] but then it gives you a warranty the
[2:09:57] warranty says if you obey the laws that
[2:10:00] are in this manual then we guarantee
[2:10:05] that this product is under warranty
[2:10:10] which means that they will personally
[2:10:13] protect it brother Branham says 1962
[2:10:16] convinced and concerned he says and God
[2:10:19] has got to keep his word to us so we
[2:10:22] must obey his word and when we obey his
[2:10:26] word and see him then vindicate what he
[2:10:29] said he would do then were convinced
[2:10:32] right that the word is right so when we
[2:10:35] obey God's Word then God is able to keep
[2:10:38] his word
[2:10:39] to us you can't ask God for something if
[2:10:44] you're not willing to obey Him when Eve
[2:10:48] ate from the tree of good and evil I'm
[2:10:52] sure he was sorry I'm sure she was sorry
[2:10:55] certainly he was sorry because she knew
[2:10:57] that she was taught not to do it right
[2:11:01] so she was sorry right
[2:11:04] but God has to keep his guarantees God
[2:11:08] said if you eat of this tree this is the
[2:11:14] consequence that will follow that some
[2:11:17] people want to eat from the tree but
[2:11:19] don't want the guarantee if you want
[2:11:24] God's blessings in your life you must be
[2:11:26] obedient to his word I heard I was at
[2:11:29] the barber shop
[2:11:30] I wonder barber said to me he said man I
[2:11:32] believe in God to open up the windows of
[2:11:35] heaven and pour me out blessings that I
[2:11:38] won't have room enough to receive so I
[2:11:41] said do you go to church it's an honor
[2:11:45] to I said do you do pay times
[2:11:52] he said not to do that I said with that
[2:11:56] burst on don't apply to you
[2:12:03] he shall so I told Rebecca about this
[2:12:07] story I said look
[2:12:09] listen man I said you can't say you
[2:12:13] won't got to do this when this has
[2:12:15] conditions to it that you don't want to
[2:12:17] meet I said before we even get to this
[2:12:21] what you must be doing is bringing all
[2:12:25] of the tithes and offering and to God
[2:12:27] storehouse now this particular scripture
[2:12:32] is very very interesting because while
[2:12:35] it yet gives you a promise it also tells
[2:12:37] you that if you don't do it see cuz
[2:12:43] people don't want they don't want to
[2:12:44] talk about that don't bring that up just
[2:12:46] talk about the blessings that's falling
[2:12:47] out of the the windows of heaven but if
[2:12:52] you don't do it then you robbing God now
[2:12:55] there's some people who are comfortable
[2:12:56] being a thief
[2:12:58] there are some people comfortable being
[2:13:00] a thief because they feel like they have
[2:13:01] not been caught so because I've not been
[2:13:04] caught now I'm comfortable well there's
[2:13:10] a couple that tried that it costed them
[2:13:17] the whole family they thought I'm a
[2:13:22] brain some stuff into God's storehouse
[2:13:24] but I'm not gonna bring all the times
[2:13:28] and the offering I'm gonna bring part of
[2:13:33] my times in our fam you know what's
[2:13:35] funny about that is that that we think
[2:13:39] that we're getting away with something
[2:13:40] when we're not cuz God will send
[2:13:41] somebody who can discern because God is
[2:13:45] the discerner of the thoughts and the
[2:13:47] intentions of the heart so he'll send
[2:13:49] somebody who can discern that and you're
[2:13:50] saying this is my year of incredible and
[2:13:52] God is saying that does not apply to you
[2:14:00] like John over there first John will
[2:14:04] tell you to go back to your first love
[2:14:06] in other words return this product back
[2:14:09] to the manufacturer because it has a
[2:14:11] defect if the manufacturer said that if
[2:14:17] you operate the product under water it
[2:14:19] may cause fatal injury do not operate
[2:14:22] the product under water oh but I tried
[2:14:24] it I use it under water and nothing
[2:14:25] happened to me you think that because
[2:14:29] you got away with something that it was
[2:14:32] okay but the longer you play with fire
[2:14:37] eventually you will get murdered it's
[2:14:41] better to obey than the sacrifice in
[2:14:52] this in this portion of the warranties
[2:14:57] and the guarantees a man who says if
[2:14:59] there is any defect in this product do
[2:15:02] not attempt to fix it yourself then it
[2:15:05] says submit it only to an authorized
[2:15:08] dealer authorized dealer you know
[2:15:13] there's a lot of dealers a lot of
[2:15:17] preachers preachers a lot of teachers
[2:15:20] teachers but they've not been authorized
[2:15:24] to handle or repair the product there's
[2:15:27] some people who will go to who they
[2:15:29] think is their favorite preacher or
[2:15:31] their favorite teachers for an answer to
[2:15:33] their problem but that preacher or
[2:15:36] teacher is not authorized to handle that
[2:15:40] product this is God's manufactured
[2:15:43] product what am I talking about I'm
[2:15:45] talking about you you are a special
[2:15:48] design nobody can just handle you any
[2:15:51] kind of way you require a special
[2:15:55] anointing because you're an eagle you
[2:15:59] require special food you require a
[2:16:02] special diet
[2:16:03] you cannot just eat anything you cannot
[2:16:06] just listen to anything you cannot just
[2:16:09] sit under any church you cannot just be
[2:16:12] in any place you cannot just work any
[2:16:15] job
[2:16:16] say that again you cannot work just any
[2:16:19] job
[2:16:20] there are some job sisters that will say
[2:16:22] you have to wear pants but you cannot
[2:16:24] just work any job because you are a
[2:16:27] special creation there are some people
[2:16:32] who don't realize how special they are
[2:16:34] Bible says you are beautifully and
[2:16:36] wonderfully made and fearfully made on
[2:16:39] top of that do you know that when the
[2:16:42] Bible says that you are an ambassador do
[2:16:45] you all know what an ambassador is an
[2:16:48] ambassador comes from a foreign country
[2:16:50] we were in Canada we were in Montreal
[2:16:53] going downtown Montreal brother Jack we
[2:16:56] were riding in an area of my
[2:16:57] brother-in-law he said I'm going to take
[2:16:59] you to Thailand today I said you're
[2:17:02] gonna take me to Thailand it's all know
[2:17:04] about that where I did I was gonna get
[2:17:06] the talent in this car in Canada and he
[2:17:10] drove he took me to Thailand he took me
[2:17:13] to Africa he took me to Brazil he took
[2:17:17] me to the United States in less than ten
[2:17:19] minutes because in Montreal there are
[2:17:23] these places called embassies and an
[2:17:27] ambassador before he goes or she goes
[2:17:30] into another country that country that
[2:17:33] they're representing will buy land in
[2:17:35] the country that they're about to sing
[2:17:37] that ambassador - and they buy that land
[2:17:41] and that land listen now belongs to the
[2:17:44] country that bought it it doesn't matter
[2:17:48] the location it belongs to that country
[2:17:51] so if you are a prisoner in Canada but
[2:17:54] you are from Nigeria and the Canadian
[2:17:57] government was after you but you made
[2:18:00] your way to the Nigerian embassy on that
[2:18:03] property
[2:18:03] do you know that the Canadian government
[2:18:05] cannot come on their embassy
[2:18:10] to arrest you they would have to write a
[2:18:13] special letter and turn it in to the
[2:18:16] embassy
[2:18:17] requesting that the embassy releases you
[2:18:20] because that is not their property wait
[2:18:24] a minute brother Joey you stay in the
[2:18:26] property that's in Montreal with a
[2:18:27] Nigerian flag is that that embassy does
[2:18:30] not belong to Montreal that's exactly
[2:18:32] what I said
[2:18:33] it's called asylum so it doesn't belong
[2:18:37] there so what happens they send the
[2:18:39] Ambassador before y'all all right
[2:18:42] they send the Ambassador into that
[2:18:44] country now the Ambassador comes and you
[2:18:46] know where they do all their business at
[2:18:48] the Embassy all right
[2:18:50] because this is a safe place it's the
[2:18:53] embassy now as an ambassador the
[2:18:58] Ambassador is a representative of the
[2:19:00] country that they came from so whatever
[2:19:02] they say it goes for the country that
[2:19:05] they came from whatever they say yeah do
[2:19:09] you know that you're an ambassador you
[2:19:12] are not from here
[2:19:14] you come from the mind of God God sent
[2:19:19] you here as an ambassador yeah
[2:19:21] but watch this you didn't just put you
[2:19:24] in West Palm Beach and call West Palm
[2:19:26] Beach your embassy the whole earth is
[2:19:30] your embassy he said I will give you
[2:19:33] dominion over the birds of the air the
[2:19:36] files are there Kerala filled every
[2:19:38] creeping thing you are an ambassador of
[2:19:40] the entire earth this is your kingdom
[2:19:43] I got surprise for everybody in the room
[2:19:45] heaven is not God's goal for you heaven
[2:19:50] is not God's goal for you restoration we
[2:19:55] look at the word restoration restoration
[2:19:57] means to restore back to its original
[2:19:59] position when it man fall from heaven or
[2:20:05] earth he fell from the earth
[2:20:08] Adam Satan fell from heaven man Adam you
[2:20:12] fell here in the earth so that's why
[2:20:14] when you read in the book of Revelation
[2:20:16] the earth is redeemed by fire you're
[2:20:19] coming back here heaven is not God's
[2:20:23] goal for you he wants you to have
[2:20:26] dominion over this this is your kingdom
[2:20:29] you are an ambassador here you are not a
[2:20:32] visitor I say it again you are not a
[2:20:35] visitor
[2:20:36] whatever you say here goes you have more
[2:20:41] power here than the angels in heaven
[2:20:46] Robert I said who has more power a son
[2:20:50] of God or an angel who has more power a
[2:20:55] son of God or an angel you have so much
[2:20:59] heart listen the Bible does not make a
[2:21:03] mistake and call you an ambassador
[2:21:04] instead of a president a president has
[2:21:07] the holes
[2:21:07] an ambassador has the country bachelor
[2:21:11] has the kingdom when a president is
[2:21:14] murdered we call it an assault when an
[2:21:19] ambassador is murdered we call it an
[2:21:21] international incident the whole world
[2:21:25] is in chaos
[2:21:26] when an ambassador is murdered you think
[2:21:29] the China cares the president Trump was
[2:21:31] to die today they wait for us to vote
[2:21:35] for a new president they wouldn't care
[2:21:38] one bit
[2:21:38] they wouldn't cry unless they like them
[2:21:41] which not many do no country will try to
[2:21:46] make a big to-do out of it other than
[2:21:48] announcing the US president is now dead
[2:21:49] they're not going to come to our aid and
[2:21:52] try to help us out and see if there's
[2:21:54] anything we need because he's just the
[2:21:56] president but kill the ambassador you
[2:22:00] kill the ambassador and we are going to
[2:22:02] war all of the countries we're going to
[2:22:06] war masters very important person what
[2:22:09] you trying to say with a joke this is
[2:22:11] why the devil can't touch you it's
[2:22:13] because if saintly trying to touch you
[2:22:15] sister calm all of the angels in heaven
[2:22:18] would draw their sword
[2:22:23] that was not even blunting you with a
[2:22:25] stick because he already knows he can't
[2:22:28] touch you Satan knows about the manual
[2:22:31] that you haven't opened yet he's ready
[2:22:35] already that's why he's so mad and
[2:22:39] that's why he's trying to keep you from
[2:22:41] reading and that is also why he's trying
[2:22:44] to keep you away from this message the
[2:22:47] devil knows about the revelation of this
[2:22:49] message the template works of
[2:22:52] destruction because if the true church
[2:22:54] will get a revelation and recognize who
[2:22:57] she is and understanding two spirits
[2:22:59] that operate within the framework of the
[2:23:02] church he knows that she already is an
[2:23:06] invincible army he knows that so what
[2:23:11] does he do he's not trying to hit you
[2:23:13] with a stick he's trying to keep you off
[2:23:15] of your knees he's trying to keep you
[2:23:18] from hearing that voice what does he do
[2:23:20] he'll make people leave and make you
[2:23:22] question that's how he's trying to do if
[2:23:30] he keeps you from reading the manual
[2:23:32] he's already warned the battle in your
[2:23:33] life he says you don't even know what
[2:23:36] this message is all about you've never
[2:23:37] read it before you don't know anything
[2:23:39] about it so if I come in your ear and
[2:23:41] tell you whatever you will believe it if
[2:23:44] I tell you you're defeated you will
[2:23:45] believe it if I tell you you won't come
[2:23:47] out of that situation you will believe
[2:23:49] it if I tell you that there's no hope
[2:23:51] you won't believe it
[2:23:54] and he's right because you haven't read
[2:23:57] the manual
[2:23:58] you haven't really gotten the revelation
[2:24:00] of the message into your heart yet so
[2:24:02] he's already winning but as an
[2:24:05] ambassador if he ever puts his hands on
[2:24:08] you all of heaven will stand up you will
[2:24:12] have a whole army come running to the
[2:24:14] listen Jesus you know when he was on
[2:24:20] trial to be crucified Jesus never spoke
[2:24:23] one word
[2:24:25] he's a sat there quietly then he came
[2:24:29] before Pilate
[2:24:31] and Pilate said listen man you know I
[2:24:34] had a power to crucify you or to let you
[2:24:37] go free Jesus having spoken on trial on
[2:24:41] sister Sarah
[2:24:42] but when Pilate said this Jesus has
[2:24:46] something to say because see now what
[2:24:51] Pilate didn't realize was he was talking
[2:24:52] about kingdom affairs and see he had no
[2:24:56] power because this is not his embassy so
[2:25:00] Jesus looks at Pilate and I could just
[2:25:04] imagine he looked at a real easy real
[2:25:06] cool and said My Kingdom is not of this
[2:25:08] world he said but even now if I give the
[2:25:14] signal tens thousands of legions of
[2:25:19] angels will come and wipe this whole
[2:25:21] place out you know I've read that verse
[2:25:25] several times in the scripture brother
[2:25:26] Jack and I noticed that Pilate actually
[2:25:28] gets silent right here it must have been
[2:25:31] some kind of harsh sweat that Jesus put
[2:25:33] on Pilate right there because Pilate
[2:25:35] told me you know you don't say much
[2:25:37] after that right there he washes his
[2:25:40] hands it seems like you don't want to
[2:25:42] have nothing to do with this kind of
[2:25:44] Kingdom business and this is what the
[2:25:47] devil will do if you recognize who you
[2:25:48] are if you look see him in the eye
[2:25:55] I know who you are and I know you got a
[2:25:56] job to do but I'm an ambassador and I
[2:25:59] also got a job to do I promise you the
[2:26:03] devil will wash his hands with you he'll
[2:26:05] say I will not touch me he'll do it why
[2:26:11] because if this product gets into the
[2:26:18] wrong hands let's say somebody gets it
[2:26:22] with the intent to destroy that product
[2:26:24] they think they've destroyed the product
[2:26:27] but manufacture it was a part of my
[2:26:29] title for a reason
[2:26:30] God's manufactured your God's
[2:26:35] manufacture product a manufactured
[2:26:38] product means that there's not just one
[2:26:39] of these
[2:26:42] that means that if Satan was to get a
[2:26:45] hold of a situation in your life and
[2:26:49] damage you you're not done
[2:26:53] because God can manufacture a new
[2:26:56] product just for you and it will operate
[2:27:00] the exact same way you said God why
[2:27:03] don't you let this situation in this way
[2:27:05] it seemed like no success came out of
[2:27:07] this for me and I said that's all right
[2:27:10] I got a new iPad for you just before you
[2:27:14] open it and start using it this time
[2:27:16] read the manual read the manual wanna
[2:27:23] read this last quote the closing brother
[2:27:29] Branham says this and questions and
[2:27:31] answers on Hebrews number three in 1957
[2:27:34] he says that when every talk of fear is
[2:27:37] vanished and the Holy Spirit is
[2:27:39] completely in control of the church then
[2:27:42] all fears are gone and that church has
[2:27:44] the power seat when they have everything
[2:27:47] that heaven owns behind them their
[2:27:50] ambassadors of the throne absolutely an
[2:27:52] ambassador of Christ has the authority
[2:27:55] and everything that Christ owns belongs
[2:27:58] to that ambassador and he said go ye
[2:28:02] into all the world you are my witnesses
[2:28:06] I wonder how many witnesses are here
[2:28:08] this morning you are my witnesses after
[2:28:12] the Holy Ghost has come on you and what
[2:28:15] is a witness is an ambassador is to come
[2:28:19] and witness something the whole powers
[2:28:22] of heaven is right in your hands I want
[2:28:30] to say something right here and close it
[2:28:32] actually I want you all to repeat this
[2:28:34] after me I am God's promised
[2:28:37] said again I am God's product I am God's
[2:28:41] masterpiece there is nothing wrong with
[2:28:44] me there is nothing wrong with me
[2:28:48] I am NOT a mistake I am NOT a mistake I
[2:28:54] am God's workmanship God is still
[2:28:58] working on me I am God's child God loves
[2:29:04] me God protects me God fights for me God
[2:29:10] speaks to me God is with me now I want
[2:29:16] you to believe that and you go back and
[2:29:19] you hear those things that you all said
[2:29:21] this morning you realize who you are you
[2:29:25] are God's masterpiece Satan has no
[2:29:28] authority over your body brother Brennan
[2:29:31] said that God created your body for you
[2:29:34] to live in so that when the devil tries
[2:29:37] to bring sickness on you God did not
[2:29:38] create your body for the devil to
[2:29:41] practice sick works on your body I'll
[2:29:45] say it again
[2:29:46] God did not perform your body for the
[2:29:49] devil to perform sick works on your body
[2:29:53] God did not perform your body for the
[2:29:56] devil to practice arthritis on you God
[2:30:01] did not create your body for the devil
[2:30:04] to practice high blood pressure on you
[2:30:07] that is not why your body was created
[2:30:11] God gave you this body of flesh to
[2:30:14] fulfill a mission of success your
[2:30:18] success is not determined by how
[2:30:20] successful somebody else is your success
[2:30:24] is determined by how successful you will
[2:30:26] complete the mission that God has for
[2:30:28] you you are God's product since birth
[2:30:32] you're God's masterpiece you are not
[2:30:35] still here for no reason God does not
[2:30:38] give you years without a purpose
[2:30:40] [Applause]
[2:30:41] God does not allow you to see old age
[2:30:44] for no reason
[2:30:46] you don't say God I'm in retirement no
[2:30:49] you're never in retirement you are a
[2:30:51] full-time ambassador if you say to this
[2:30:57] mountain be moved and don't doubt in
[2:31:02] your heart but believe that whatsoever
[2:31:06] things you say but believe make sure you
[2:31:12] read because you can't have faith
[2:31:14] without reading you can't have faith
[2:31:17] without hearing the spoken word faith
[2:31:19] cometh by hearing believe that what you
[2:31:22] say may you still have it
[2:31:26] now I'm not a hill or anything like that
[2:31:31] I don't believe that it takes
[2:31:36] necessarily prayer lines but God uses
[2:31:39] those things but I don't believe that
[2:31:42] it's gonna take all that this morning
[2:31:43] because I believe God has already able
[2:31:46] as the musicians come he's able to do
[2:31:49] exceedingly abundantly above all that we
[2:31:50] can ever ask or think and while there's
[2:31:54] still time on the clock with Laroy while
[2:31:56] there's still time on the clock anything
[2:31:59] is possible
[2:32:02] Caleb Caleb 80 something years old he
[2:32:08] goes to Joshua he says give me this
[2:32:10] mountain high we like to say give me my
[2:32:12] mountain but that is not what Caleb said
[2:32:15] Caleb said give me this mountain I was
[2:32:19] listening to brother whisper preach on
[2:32:20] this where the whispers say Kenda want
[2:32:23] to keep her on for a reason and he
[2:32:25] brought a lot of things happening here
[2:32:27] on well one thing that I remember he
[2:32:30] said happened in here on he said it was
[2:32:32] the first place that God says to Abraham
[2:32:35] is there anything too hard for me this
[2:32:42] morning we are in Hebron
[2:32:44] the same place where God asked the
[2:32:45] question is there anything too hard for
[2:32:47] me at church I want to ask you all the
[2:32:48] question this morning is there anything
[2:32:51] too hard for the Lord if you believe
[2:32:57] that stay with me on your feet this
[2:32:58] morning you are an ambassador of heaven
[2:33:07] the sons and daughters of God and God
[2:33:11] needs you to be successful if you don't
[2:33:14] succeed God fails why brother Joe

[2:33:29] it and then look at somebody else to

[2:44:02] failed search has ever failed the death

[2:44:46] because it's for me too
[2:44:48] cuz I'm not tired yet and I'm not done
[2:44:51] yet y'all keep us in prayer god bless
[2:44:52] you man I'll tell you what this has been
[2:45:10] an incredible year
[2:45:12] and I am just grateful to the Lord Jesus
[2:45:20] we were just felt led to do that prayer
[2:45:24] life service back in June and with
[2:45:26] brother Nathan and and brother Joe came
[2:45:30] and and you know just a Bethany came up
[2:45:35] and were free
[2:45:35] I'm sorry sister Rebecca or paint pray
[2:45:38] for him here the the results the end of
[2:45:43] this year that they're expecting and
[2:45:46] 2020 we know God did that thing and the
[2:46:01] brothers do I don't know a few if you
[2:46:03] realized but you were you were talking
[2:46:05] about Mary and how our Christian believe
[2:46:10] for us to be Christians we have to
[2:46:13] believe in miracles just to be a
[2:46:15] Christian you have to believe in a
[2:46:16] miracle because a virgin conceived and
[2:46:20] bore a child right and and if there was
[2:46:23] anything impossible that should have
[2:46:26] been impossible but God showed us that
[2:46:29] there's nothing impossible
[2:46:30] a man his word to get the job done and
[2:46:34] so that was our inspiration with stamina
[2:46:37] Mary you know last year this time we
[2:46:40] preached a couple sermons on Marian and
[2:46:43] it just took us right into the beginning
[2:46:46] of the year and and that's where we got
[2:46:48] inspiration from a man with the year the
[2:46:52] incredible because we thought about Mary
[2:46:53] and church I love that little thought
[2:46:56] that brother Joe gave us at the
[2:46:59] beginning there about the fourth quarter
[2:47:00] you know and in football they usually
[2:47:02] have 15 minutes a quarter
[2:47:05] [Music]
[2:47:07] and so you get you know the first
[2:47:09] quarter 15 minutes then another you know
[2:47:12] the second quarter another 15 minutes
[2:47:14] and third quarter 15 minutes in the
[2:47:16] fourth quarter 15 minutes and a man and
[2:47:19] when we make it there 15 minutes in that
[2:47:21] last quarter
[2:47:22] you know them guys know they have to
[2:47:23] turn everything on it and when he said
[2:47:25] that I realized today was the 15th day
[2:47:28] of December so 15 more days would really
[2:47:31] set us a man for this last quarter right
[2:47:34] hallelujah somebody look with all the
[2:47:40] things that we don't heard God do ain't
[2:47:41] no senses nobody leaving here down I
[2:47:45] believe brother Branham says it's time
[2:47:48] to doubt your doubts when the devil
[2:47:50] presented doubts you say I doubt that
[2:47:52] scene not that and how you know the
[2:47:54] double line every time he open his mouth
[2:47:58] you know he line race car man I'm
[2:48:03] leaving here in courage
[2:48:04] all right you know I will sit there just
[2:48:06] kind of thinking about it you know for
[2:48:08] some trials and things like that they've
[2:48:09] kind of come a little lately but you
[2:48:11] know sometimes a devil loved to give us
[2:48:13] focus on all the trials and and this
[2:48:17] happened that happened but you got to be
[2:48:19] able to turn things around on it I'm
[2:48:20] gonna start praising God for what I what
[2:48:22] are you all ready to indeed and I've
[2:48:25] said it before I'm gonna say it again if
[2:48:27] he don't do another thing he's done
[2:48:29] enough for me to praise on the rest of
[2:48:31] my days how are you you somebody
