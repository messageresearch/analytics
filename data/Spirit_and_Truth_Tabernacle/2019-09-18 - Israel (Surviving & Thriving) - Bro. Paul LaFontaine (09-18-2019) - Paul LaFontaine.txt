we are we see what Wednesday night is and we're mindful of your responsibilities and duties although I believe we've got some people here tonight that this is the priority of life when the word has been broken to us so everything else everything else this side showed to this and so but we appreciate you coming out to the house of the Lord tonight those have made an effort to come because when we make that sacrifice God has something for us I believe that but we just have a short little teaching for you tonight out of the word we won't be lengthy but we figured maybe if we come back and do a Sunday we'll take our time but we'll just have a short teaching in the Word of God and I want to I just want to just speak a little bit tonight and I talked a little bit about Israel and in the last she just had her birthday here last year seventy years and I want to talk about how they have prospered in just seventy years come from nothing and God's restored them to everything you know instils a type of our lives spiritually and so I'd like to talk about surviving and thrive and not just survive but thriving under the prophesy and under the Word of God praise the Lord so let's read a few places tonight and when we read these they might be a little different for you but they'll I believe they'll pull together as we speak of these things tonight Isaiah chapter 11 Isaiah chapter 11 and appreciate my wife being with us as well and just those times that we just leave the kids at home and come away ourselves Isaiah chapter 11 verse 11 and 12 and these things will come together as you we speak of it tonight but just want to get them in your your minds and it came to pass isaiah 11:11 it shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people which shall be left from Assyria and from Egypt and from Pathros and from cush and from Elim and from shanaar and from hamath and from the islands of the sea and he shall set up an in sign for the nations and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth Jesus referred to this in Matthew as well when he'll gather his elect from the four corners of the earth this is the scripture that speaks of them gathering and it mentions an in sign which brother Brandon referred to as being when Israel became a nation after so many years and then if you go under chapter 18 and verse 1 says woe to the land showering with wings which is beyond the rivers of the theö PIA that sinneth ambassadors by the sea even in vessels of bullrushes upon the water saying Gogi swift messengers to a nation scattered and peeled to a people terrible from their beginning hither to a nation meted out and trodden down whose land the rivers have spoiled all ye inhabitants of the world and was on the or sea when he lifted up an inside on the mountains and when he bloweth a trumpet hear ye and then another prophecy in Ezekiel 36 and I'm reading all prophecies for Israel whether it's the decline and the barrenness that comes to the land or the restoration there the Bible and the Old Testament is full of accounts of prophecies for Israel Ezekiel 36 Ezekiel 36 and verse 34 and the desolate land shall be tilled wherever it laid desolate in the sight of all that passed by and they shall say this land that was desolate is become like the Garden of Eden and the wastes and desolate and ruined cities are become fenced and are inhabited then the heathen that are left roundabout you shall know that I have I the Lord excuse either Lord build the ruined places and plant that that was desolate I the LORD have spoken it and I will do it so it's another place in Nehemiah that even the heathen after has to testify this work was wrought in God only God could do this to restore his people and he can take something desolate and prosper it caused it to survive and then caused it to thrive he's a God of restoration now I just started this just before I was coming in tonight Psalms chapter one so you related just a tad bit with it here Psalms chapter one I wanted to add this in blessing is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful now look where this believer is look where he's positioned now he's not taking the counsel from the in godly ungodly he's not standing the way sinners nor sitteth in the seat of corn so scornful but his delight is in the word his delight is in the law of the Lord and his law doth he meditate day and night he's living in a different position he's living under the Word of God and so then it goes on to say and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season know it's where he's planted in position it doesn't have anything to do with him as such it's because he's planted in the right place he's under the right word he's planted in the right place and look what happens he'll bring forth fruit news isn't his season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper now don't try to change that that's what it says it's God's promise I'll take a hold of it tonight you take a hold of it a believer position in the word not because of your personality not because of that your position in the right place you're not taking your counsel from Google can you say mine you're living under the prophecy of the Word of God and God says that man or woman whatever they do is gonna prosper the ungodly are not so but are like the chaff which the wind driveth the way there is no purpose for their life there is no prophecy over their life we're different than the ungodly therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous for the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of the ungodly Shall Perish two groups of people as those that are under the prophecy of the word and those that aren't but those that are everything she does will prosper she's gonna thrive not because of herself but because she's under the right word father bless your word tonight god we pray that you'll anchor something into the hearts of the believers this evening and Lord I pray your Holy Spirit would just take preeminence speak through the word and as we teach this tonight I pray you'll break open the word of life and Lord excite us not under just an emotion but something deeper than that Lord to recognize our place we thank you father in Jesus name Amen god bless you may [Music] change my direction just a little bit before the service this afternoon and I want to just look at this just a little bit and it was quite exciting last year when I was looking into some of the celebration that took place for Israel when she celebrated 70 years as a nation and on May 14th they celebrate 70 years as a nation and they celebrated becoming one of the greatest nations and countries among the world now now you got to remember that this is a nation that was no nation for many many thousands of years and had become desolate and here because of the word had said that they had become desolate and the people were scattered abroad as I read neither prophecy and and so now now we see in just seventy years which this astounds the people as they looked at it at the birthday it astounded them for a nation to become a nation and to advance and to prosper just in 70 years as like the number twenty last year was the number twenty nation of all the nations in the world economically agriculture in every way they've advanced in every way above a lot of the other nations and everybody's going how does this happen if you don't have a spiritual mind you don't know how it happens but you got a spiritual mind you know exactly how it happens they are a people in a nation under a prophecy they're carrying a word can you say man that's the difference they're a nation that's under a prophecy of the word and that word is going to come to pass a man I don't have time to preach this and apply to you very much tonight so I'll pray you apply to yourself because everything Israel comes to naturally as a nation comes to the individual as the bride of Jesus Christ so as you know your Bible then it brings out things and that they were a nation if you study it they were a nation before of course and when they were a nation before of Israel they were a thriving nation under Solomon they came to a millennium they came to a time that all the nations of the world regard is regarded Israel the the the the there was a woman that traveled all those all those countries and all those miles where the RAM talked about to come and see the greatness of Israel and so we've got all those references and then and it's because due to honour 28:1 says and it took come to vas if thou shall hearken diligently into the voice of the LORD thy God to observe it and do all his Commandments why commanding this day that the Lord thy God will set the on high above all nations of the earth so now even back then they begin to work off of a prophecy of a prophet that they actually advanced and became above all the nations of the earth 2,000 years ago Israel had become the mighty superpower of the entire world and acknowledged nation a nation that was just coveted can you say men everybody wanted to go see what was happening in Israel and so then exactly what had happened according to prophecy that happened but then just after that if you read in your Bible and tonight I'm just gonna I'm just gonna refer to these you can study him on your own then he says these words moreover the Lord will scatter you and this is in the same chapter Deuteronomy 28 the Lord will scatter you among all peoples from one end of the earth to the other so then he says you'll be blessed in this way but if you leave the Word of God then all these curses will come upon you and you'll be scattered and so now a nation that thread all of a sudden they're scattered everywhere the people are dispersed around the world but it wasn't just that the people were scattered he also added in there Deuteronomy 29 22 that the land itself would become a burning waste unsewn and unproductive and no grass growing in it now these are prophets this is the prophecy says also the stranger will come from a far land and look at it and see the sickness upon it the land would become filled with diseases and plagues and I got these in front of me where he refers to these not only scattering these things but then a curse comes on the actual geographical land of the area where it says the desolate land will be cultivated instead of being desolation let me just go back here and just read this just a second here I wanted you to catch yeah he says here and do it on between in the land self-will become a burning waste unsewn unproductive and no grass growing in it the curse would be so terrible that when foreigners came to vent to the land they would cry out why has the Lord done what has the Lord done to this land why this great outburst of anger that's in Deuteronomy 29 and the answer will be because they forsook the covenant of the Lord and the God of their fathers so this is all scriptural references and it all took place in a cycle where Israel got away from the Lord and then they're not only now listen now I want you to catch this not only were they scattered and come away from God and their land their home and but their land became dry their land become desolate everything in their life begin to dry up and and that geographical place of Israel wasn't groaning grass there wasn't any trees it was it was an actual mess that was taking place and then the Bible refers to strangers traveling from abroad remember I read that strangers being sent to go view the land that happened according to prophecy because in night 18 1855 an American medical doctor Jonathan Meese traveled to the Holy Land and published his recollections recollections in a book called a journey to Egypt in Palestine and this was his words when he looked at Palestine at present nearly three thousand years after David the country is a prey to the wild beasts and to the wire beat Bedouins and of the inhabitants eat plants just enough to satisfy his greatest bodily wants all surplus the Boyden takes over and what he leaves behind the ruling Turk will confiscate moving head in 1867 12 years later an American journalist Mark Twain made a trip to Palestine he published it in the innocence of abroad and he says that he said describe Palestine as a blistering naked treeless land 1884 another American tourist Henry field now this is prophecy because it says the stranger they'll say send the stranger abroad with ships can you say man how specific the word of God is because that's the way they traveled back then and there there even the unbeliever is working according to the Word of God they don't even know what they were doing when they got on a boat to come across there but they're walking in the vision praise the Lord and so he wrote about he says the country seemed deserted of human Abaddon habitations this is 1884 deserted of human habitations its appearance was made still more desolate by being without trees while riding among the hills I did not a sink see a single tree whether this be owing to the government tax on trees or the wastefulness of the people and cutting for fuel every young tree almost as soon as it grows its head above the ground I know not I only state the fact that the landscape was absolutely treeless goes on to say in 1912 he said another one describes it's practically tree list such hedges are exist are mostly prickly cactus the villages past are secret to looking clumps of flat and that goes on the city itself is the shadow of a rock and a weary land with the exception of a few pallet off olive trees a patch here and there of indefinite green and melancholy Cypress the errands of Jerusalem are dusty like a limestone waste I think that's enough to let you know I witnesses the scripture says send I witnesses what God said came to pass a thriving land a thirsting place under Solomon a flourishing place and then it becomes a desolation but God had another word for God had a word of restoration I remember a word of restoration coming up in Joel where he says the years that the cankerworm has taken the caterpillar of day and begins to eat that broad tree and broad roses it takes the fellowship it takes the doctrine it takes the bark off it drinks it down right to a stop and then sucks the very life out of it prophecy for the church chapter tool Joel says but I will restore save the Lord all the years everything that's didn't destroyed I'm gonna restore it all that's our God friends I don't know what you've lost here tonight but God says he restored back to you because he's a God of restoration I pray that's a blessing to you we can close the service and shout right now you're under a word restoration you're under a word of restoration this message is a message of restoration this this isn't a new denomination this isn't do's and don'ts this isn't just something with a dress code this is a prophecy this is a word to restore our lives back everything's lost will be recovered that's the message unless it be his name we're under a word of restoration so now when this desolation took place for Israel it culminated in Rome it's a little history here finishing them off in AD 70 until there was nothing less the temple was destroyed no nation it was cut off from Rouen 80 70 they were driven out from that point on the place become nothing for almost 1800 years no more flag or identity in the world people scattered all over the world Rome was used to do it the same thing happens the spiritual church Rome was used to take the spirit out of the church can you say man but I want you to see the miracle of where Israel is at today she has not only survived impossible odds to become a nation again just the odds to become a nation was supernatural that they can even be called a nation today have their own flag have their own nation it was a supernatural God there was no way possible for that to take place because they had no identity in the world and besides that Satan's persecution against them if that would been in charge they would have never been allowed to have a nation there's several and United Nations that want to dissolve her now they want to get rid of her there's enemies still of Israel can you say man whatever statistic I read the other than I can't remember how high it's risen even in the last five years the the the hatred towards the Jews anti-semitism raising that's the spirit of the age it's the persecution it's two thousand thousand demons against the spiritual elected seed natural seed the spiritual seed so you guys know you the message so i don't i just need refer to these things because i know you're picking up on it so now she has struck she has not only survived all odds but now she's not just survived to get into become a nation after seven years she's thriving as one of the top nations now we're talking about naturally now okay a lot of in israel aren't believers spiritually things I don't have the Holy Ghost but God deals with them as a nation as a nation the prophecy was fulfilled they're actually thriving is one of the greatest nations economically geographically our agricultural e they're leading the field in medicine they said they're only a few years to discovering the cure for cancer Israel thriving because the word says she will so she had no identity in the world secret people all over the world holding to the original word that Moses gave but now has become the most powerful military in the Middle East and an economy that's in the top five of the world she has risen in the most shaky times with much of the world against her from the start does that sound like anybody here tonight she has risen with much of the world against her against all odds all kinds of nations and people and governments against her become a nation against her prospering and despite what the devil could do militarily in every way she's risen to the top I'll tell you if you're under the Word of God there ain't nothin gonna stop you [Applause] you say well I don't feel very much like that tonight on this Wednesday night it doesn't matter how you feel it's the word that you're under it's what you're carrying can you say man it wasn't about Mary Mary it was about what she was carrying why God chose Mary wasn't about Mary it's who she was carrying a man so she's come through all this and the world's guest comes and there's only one reason there's a prophecy over them people spoken by the prophets of the Bible it's gonna come to pass it is coming to pass nothing can stand in the way of God's Word being fulfilled if you're living your life right now with just a little bit of Bible religion that's not enough but when you're living in obedience to the original Word of God under the word of prophets and the prophets word for this age it's gonna be fulfilled in you against all that's what this Bible is this is a Bible that's full of prophets spoke in the word of the Lord that's what your Bible is people are against Prophet sure it gets prophets the whole Bible is mostly prophets even in the New Testament that's how God brought his word and when he spoke that through the mouth of a prophet that's his word and it will come to pass should be his name so they live by the original word and Adam and Eve you know Adam and Eve didn't have a Bible but they live by the original spoken word of God and that was their life until the serpent injected other ideas Adam II need have no Bible they were living by the word spoken and they lived in an Eden just by living by the word spoken prospering so now at the end time when these wheels of prophecy for Israel begin to turn in the restoration now the the wheels of prophecy they go slow but then when they begin to turn now we see these prophecies for restoration begin to turn before 1948 when the United Nations recognized them as a nation before that time some strange things started to happen in the world events and we understand these things in events in the World War one and World War two because of the message we understand the spiritual meaning of why those things took place we had a prophet take world war two and bring an understanding to it that none of this world understands they don't know the purpose of those wars but in God's eyes that was a purpose I'll tell you the purpose his word had to be fulfilled that the people that he had scattered now there's a word says I'm gonna gather you all so now all these men are being held in the in the in the end the hand of God as they begin to fulfill these things and you see the focus of the war on the dictators side was mainly one thing the persecution and the extermination of a group of people so these men especially in World War two the when you look what's the perp was the purpose of war was that denominates the world be a dictator of the world you can read Hitler's focus you can read these dictators hooks and the main focus the the persecution and the was the person and the complete extermination of this group of people the Jews other wars had different agendas but this one was focused against God's elect there was always a hatred and jealousy against to use the Jews why because they're God's favor to people he gave the promises to those people they're always hated as they are still today it's incredible in a world that has such tolerance for everybody there's still a hatred for the Jews and for true Holy Ghost fill Christians in a world that tolerates the homosexuals and everybody still hold a hatred for the Jews let trump pass some laws and let trump move the the headquarters for our embassy to Jerusalem and let them make a few moves and it just it just erupts the hatred for that what's going on you're supposed to be tolerating you're supposed to allow everybody everybody supposed to have a part here not the Jews why it's a spiritual meeting its hatred in their heart towards God's elect he's a lord that's right I hope you've seen yourself in this tonight so always been hatred but it's God's favored people and so it's because you carry the word so now I got to move on here so I can be short like I said the low girl coming in sister Ellen's uh baby granddaughter there said she loves to come to church except when it's lone I love an honest girl like that I love it Kennedy thank you for being honest I feel the same way sometimes thank you so that was just a little hint to the preacher I love you honey good I like that I like you having a good time you have a good time okay she was having a good time too I just embarrassed her praise the Lord so now the hatred has always been there but just before the prophecies fulfilled that her inside will be lifted up there's a huge increase in the hatred to the extreme Hitler's agenda was not to be a world leader but Hitler's main agenda was to kill and exterminate God's people and I've got a reading there for someone with what it was head generals and he explains that perfect am i gonna read it tonight he explains it where this was Hitler's agenda this is what he wanted to do the Jews would be exterminated who put that spirit on him who did that what's he being motivated by it wasn't just a personal thing with Hitler something is happening prophecies getting ready to be fulfilled the Prophet pointed us to the scripture what's happening in seven trumpets he said that seven trumpets are for Israel is the same as a seventh seal for us and he speaks of it in the trumpets he says now notice the trumpets are speaking of as a call together for either a feast or for some person or some sacred day and you got the background of the seals in the church now we're going to go into the trumpet the trumpet sounded the trumpet denotes either war or feast day or what it means it's a gathering together the people God uses a war to gather his people if your life is having a bunch of war well he's getting you closer to he's bringing you closer to himself it's all war going on in your life it's a good thing you're being driven closer to the Lord you're being driven on your knees boy you should look around say boy there's war going on everywhere but I know what God's doing praise the Lord so this gathering the trumpet denotes words that gathering together God's people when the trumpet is an uncertain sound who can to prepare themselves for war for peace whatever he who knows you have to know what the trumpet sounds therefore when the trumpet sounds we see something in the earth today there's a great trouble somewhere everybody knows that everybody has become a neurotic the war whole world is an erotical world and we know there's something wrong the Pentagon everywhere we know there's something wrong it's the feeling before this thing happens so notice with all this after the war ended three years later she still gets to put up her in sign and become a nation three years later yeah a war that was to exterminate the Jews and just years later she has her own flag and becomes a nation how does that happen you're under a prophesy you're under the word my it's a wonderful thing so not only that shall prosper now this writer says an Israeli the Israelis have a lot to celebrate in seventy short years the nation has developed from a cultural and economic wasteland to a global powerhouse in agriculture cyber technology and medical innovation Israel's economy has grown from three billion in 1948 to a whopping 300 billion today 70 years what am i preaching to you they're not just they haven't just survived they're thriving they're thriving as a nation and Israel's economy has grown from 3 billion in 1940 to 300 billion today the population has ballooned from 800,000 in 1948 to 8 point 8 million in 2018 Israel has become a global technology technology hub called Silicon Wadi rivaling their American counterparts Silicon Valley and as both boosted tourism to an all-time high of 3.6 million visitors in 2017 out of the defensive neccessity its military ranks as one of the top five in the world praise the Lord blessed be his name for their entire history Jews have had to face constant danger and this may be the secret to their success as a nation they managed to turn adversity into an asset striving to survive they have thrived blessed be his name might mention this too to a land that had no water even up to ten years ago they had problems water with water they've turned the whole thing around until their whatever their envied by all the nations now how they fixed their water problem what they says now the country that is is is now a country that is 60% a country that was 60% desert and he was in population increased tenfold since 1948 not only has enough water for itself now but in fact has a surplus and even exports water to its neighbors in 1930s British economists predicted that all of Palestine including today's Gaza Israel in the West Bank had enough water to sustain 2 million people today the area is home to more than 12 million people a feat that psychoactive attributes to large part to Israel's first class water planning management the world's inven what have you all the places without what have you done and let me tell you something that's not because just the mentality a man that's not enough can you say men they're under a prophecy that the land that was desolate will be thriving and grow arrogation and grow trees that were no trees places the beautiful place brother Jack has been there it's a beautiful place the desert has blossomed my friend if your life has become a desert there's a word that can bring a blossom to your life it can thrive can you say man only God can take a desert and make it bloom with all the flowers and all the good things hallelujah blessed be his name you think it was the mentality the intellect of man that made the best water system in the world no they're under a prophesy can you say a man they're working under a prophesy God said I'll make that the best in the land again I'll give you water in the desert Oh blessed be his name blessed be his name and that wonderful so friends I wanted to tell you tonight I'm gonna I'm gonna be short I told you what I'm wrapping this up now because I think you got the thought listen we are God's we are God's elect spiritually speaking everything that's happened there has happened to the bride she become desolate spiritually when the church system took away the Spirit of God from the early church all the way after the Catholic Church first organized system all the way till until become the Dark Ages no Holy Spirit left in the church God says I will restore and that's not just as a people together because God deals with us in individuals he restores us as individuals everything that's lost what God will give back again even families even families Isaiah said the restoration of many generations so I'm jumping way ahead here to conclude for you tonight that you are God's people spiritually not just to restore now not just to restore the land of the Word of God because he's brought brought us back to his full promised land the word our inheritance in the word not just that though but he says that person in the position will prosper in everything that he does I'm gonna take a hold of that tonight and that of my motives are right and I'm under the right word despite my mistakes despite what I do intellectually that's failures if I'm under the right word and I'm believing it and I'm obeying it can you say man and I'm in that channel of the word and I'm doing my best to follow that word of God then that word is more powerful than my mistakes that word is going to lead and guide me blessed be his name I believe that with all my heart and I believe that do you that believers let me say it this way this is not in my notes this is the believer today under what God has given us through the restoration of the word the opening of the seals you are spiritual billionaires tonight in this shopping center at spirit and truth in this place with just 20 people here you are a spiritual billionaire [Applause] you are called to prosper first of all spiritually but not just spiritually cuz second John says I wish above all things that you prosper and be in health as your soul prospers it's talking about the bride it's not talking about the ungodly it's not talking about some person that's kind of a religion we're talking about God's Holy Ghost filled people my children I wish above all things that you prosper and be in health and this has nothing to do with what the TV preachers on a prosperity gospel they're only trying to take that and build up their own motive but they're not under the Word of God for this day they're not under the message but you are so those scriptures for prosperity it don't apply to some ungodly person it applies to you tonight yes yours [Applause] so if you if you do hear those TV preachers or you listen to those hear everything and they're going through all this process and using scriptures to do it you can sit there and say listen I'm one of the ones he's really talking about because I'm under the word that God's in in this hour praise be to God you're a spiritual billionaire tonight you're a spill choose your scripture billionaire you see if I was a TV preacher I'd preach that and then I'd take up an offering right now but I ain't gonna do it God takes care of me I don't even want an offering tonight I'm not here I can tell you I think the last time I told you don't give me any of our friend Owain offering it's too much fun to come here I don't want an offering for coming here it's too much enjoyment I know the laborer is worthy of his hire and he forces me to take it I don't come I come to preach the spiritual billionaires [Applause] now don't stop giving your offerings and tithes that's not what I'm preaching cuz that's one of the ways you tap into God's blessings but it's not just that you give your tithes and offerings it's because you have tapped into the word of life for this hour and that's why you'll prosper above all that's why whatever your hands fine to do call to a prospering the motives are right the spirits right the characters right everything's right the word is right you can't apply you can't apply those principles when you got all kinds of worldly things going on and you're disobedient to the rest of the word you can't apply those principles the people under this word they can apply these principles amen blessed be his name friends under this word were not called to just survive if you're just surviving tonight you're not living where you should be living if you just survive another just barely surviving God's called you

Isaiah chapter 54 verse 15 yes sir familiar scriptures behold they shall surely gathered together but not by me whosoever shall gathered together against thee shall fall for thy sake behold I've created the Smith that bloweth the coals in the fire and that bringeth for an instrument for his work musicians can come right now an instrument for his work and I have created the waster to destroy no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against the in judgment thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the servants of the Lord and their righteousness is of me saith the Lord let's give the Lord here amen blessed be his name I've enjoyed it tonight let's stand let's give the Lord glory let's praise him tonight you're not called just to survive

never that and you know they're just trying to prepare him you know for the worse and and and and brother Spencer looked at the doctors and said you know I appreciate all that but you just don't know who you're talking to like what see I'm a son of God you you don't know who you're talking to I'm a son of God and they say I understand what you're saying but I'm a son of God he he went into that

raise you up out of his condition and God touched brother Ron Spencer raised him up and they say he went back to work like the following Monday [Music] Church we got to know who we are in Christ we
