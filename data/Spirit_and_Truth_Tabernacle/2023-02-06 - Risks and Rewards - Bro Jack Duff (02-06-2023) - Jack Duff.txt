went to their own company and reported all that the chief priests and Elders has said unto them and when they heard that they lit and when they heard that they lifted up their voice to God with one Accord and said Lord Thou Art God which has made Heaven and Earth and the Sea and all that in them is who by the mouth of thy servant David has said why did the Heathen rage and the people imagine vain things the kings of the earth stood up and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against his Christ for other truth thy holy Child Jesus whom thou has anointed both Herod and Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles and the people of Israel will gather together for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy Council determined before to be done and now Lord behold their threatenings and Grant unto thy servants that with all boldness we may speak Thy Word by stretching forth thine hand to heal and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy Child Jesus and when they had

specials that went forth and the song Service as well um I just I love worshiping with y'all amen praise the Lord amen so um we have a dedication this morning that we we want to do and as we just make ready for that um brother a Christian sister Gabby will be bringing their children a man to be dedicated to the Lord uh on on this morning and so we make preparation just want to read a couple scriptures [Music] um Luke 18 verse 15 through 17 is is what we use amen when we're doing dedications the scripture says and they brought unto him also infants that he would touch them but when his disciples saw it they rebuked them but Jesus called them unto him and said suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not for if such is the kingdom of God verily I say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise into therein a man so as the prophet taught us we don't sprinkle babies I remember a friend of mine I mean I don't think he went to church one day in his life but when his child was born he um he said I'm going to church and they took the baby to the church to get sprinkled I'm like well why did they rush to that church to get that baby sprinkled like that what's going on come to find out that they were taught that if the child is sprinkled by the priests then um they automatically go to heaven I say what never repented not one time so now I don't know about that so I don't think that's gonna work you know they're gonna need a little bit more than some water to get them to Heaven amen they got to repent of their sins you know and um you know but we don't do that here but what we do is is we dedicate the babies back to the Lord amen we realize that the children came to us from God and we give them back to Lord and we accept the responsibility and we're giving them back to the Lord we accept responsibility we're going to be the ones to raise this child in the ways of God and we're going to teach them the ways of God and just make sure that they they understand who God is we're going to live before them the ways of God right this is what our dedication to the other children is all about so uh we uh we thank God this morning that we we have parents bringing their their children back to the Lord uh here uh the the prophet said this in the message to Paradox it says therefore we bring them and dedicate them any Mothers any church any Creed any color anything else we dedicate all little children to the Lord Jesus Christ amen another scripture I just want to read is out of Psalm 78 verse 1 through 7. it says give ear o my people to my law incline years to the words of my mouth I will open my mouth in a parable I will utter dark sayings of old which we have heard and known and our fathers have told us we will not hide them from their children showing to the generation to come the Praises of the Lord and his strength and his wonderful works that he have done for he established a testimony in Jacob and appointed a law in Israel which he commanded our fathers that they should make them known to their children that the generations that come might know them even the children which should be born who should arise and declare them to their children that they might set their hope in God and not forget the works of God but keep his Commandments Amen brother Christian sister Gabby if you all would come amen bring the the children amen will dedicate them amen let's sing this song bring them in Marine them in bring them in oh bring from the fields of sin oh bring [Music] a ring they're mean oh bring the little ones to Jesus [Music] us let's say praise the Lord for this wonderful family amen do all this thing right here how old is Hazel three okay all right let me pray for haze [Music] there we go praise the Lord let's pray father we come [Music] in the precious name of the Lord Jesus praying for our young Sister Hazel God as a parents have brought her back they've accepted the response accepted the responsibility to raise her in the ways of God Lord and as a church we're going to support them in every way we can God we pray that you would keep this wonderful young lady that you would Lord just bless a life that you would use it for your glory god we don't know what you'll call her to father but whatever it is may she be yielded to your perfect will and father we pray that she'd just be a blessing to her parents as her parents our blessing to her I pray that you meet every need in this home God that they'd be able to raise this child father in the ways that please you god father we dedicated her back to you today as you've given them given her to them Lord they give her back to you it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen [Music] um yeah let's pray father we hope Chris Jr Lord we thank you for him that you've given him to his parents watched over sister Gabby during this time of Lord or carrying the baby and even there I just remember Lord while she was in the hospital they called me I was in the Lord they were just having this little situation and God you brought them forth the devil could not stop him from coming forth and we thank you for giving them a life health and strength and Lord as they come this morning to bring the baby back to you God and we dedicate them Father For Your Glory and for your honor we actually do it use little Christopher we don't know what you have planned for his life but Lord as parents they're accepting responsibility to raise them the right way he told us to train a child in the way that they should go when they get old they want their part father and as a church we support them Lord and they're raising this child and we pray that you would use them for your glory father bless their home oh God meet every need that they would have Lord God that they'd be able to raise this this son Lord in a way that's pleasing to thee God we just give them back to you today as you gave them to them it's in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen praise the Lord [Music] [Music] thank you very much [Applause] thank you Lord from the fields I've seen oh bring [Music] them in bring them in oh bring the little ones to Jesus Jesus [Music] let's give the Lord another hand a praise appreciate uh you all um I do need to just have a um a meeting with the church after a service there um so if you all could just remain man uh there I just need to meet with you um I wanna just uh uh take a little thought here and we'll read our scripture out of Matthew 14. amen Matthew 14 and just stand with me if you don't mind amen see brother Nehemiah back there God bless you and man good to see you my brother praise the Lord Matthew 14. this whole chapter is good but I'm trying to shorten it but it's it's um it is really really good food amen when you studied a chapter you'll see at the beginning we lost a prophet uh the prophet John was murdered because of what he preached but he had to decrease so that Christ could increase and that was just the way God did things and uh immediately following you know in this chapter I don't know if that's the way it really happened in life but but in the chapters written after that tremendous seemed like defeat then we saw this great miracle of 5 000 people being fed with two fish and five loaves of bread lets us know how powerful our God is amen and um after that we could skip down here to verse 22 which is where I guess the most of my inspiration is coming from uh this section of Matthew 15 says and straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship to go before him unto the other side while he sent the multitudes away and when he had sent the multitudes away he went up into a mountain apart to pray and when the evening was come he was there alone but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves for the wind was contrary now I guess the the the the the the the first verse of our reading Jesus encouraged him to get in this boat and um the thing that I know about Jesus is he already knew that the winds was going to be contrary but yet he encouraged them get in the boat constrained them and just imagine what he was going through trying to push these fellas inside a boat don't worry about this don't worry about I got that I got I send the people away get in the boat get in the boat get in the boat right but look at this um the verse 25 says and in the Fourth Watch of the night Jesus went unto them walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear but straightway Jesus speak unto them saying be of good cheer it is I Be not Afraid what words and Peter answered him and said Lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the water but he thought he was challenging Jesus and he said come and when Peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to Jesus but when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried saying Lord save me and immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto him oh thou a little faith wherefore this thou doubt and when they were coming to the ship the wind ceased than they that were in the ship came and worshiped him saying of a truth Thou Art the Son of God Amen the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word let's just bow in a word of Prayer amen uh father we are again grateful for the privilege to read the scripture but we know it takes the Holy Ghost to make the scripture even live for our day so Lord I pray that it won't just be a Bible story but God will be able to apply this to right where we are right now you know what we all need to hear speak father we ask that you bless the Saints and minister to each and every heart Lord that is that is here today and those that are online uh see some of the saints were not able to make it out today God we execute look upon them and that you would strengthen them right where they are be glorified magnified exalted in this place in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you you can be seated amen uh we take for a title today risks and Rewards amen risks and rewards amen and um just um quickly I want to just kind of give you a little history as to where this this came from at Christmas time our family does a a little thing where we do gift sharing with extended family uh my my mother-in-law's sisters you know husbands and you know just kids and everybody get together and we kind of pulled names and um you know and everybody gets somebody in the family they got to buy a gift for so I had a one of the cousins got my name and and uh I always appreciate it when she get my name because she always get me something really really nice you know I really appreciate this year she she gave me you know two two gifts one of them was a calendar that has just different words on it words for the day a and she knows that I'm a I like to play Scrabble and so she she trying to just boost my vocabulary you know and I'm like okay I appreciate that some of them words I might not ever remember again but sometimes you never know something might hit you and you can you can play that word uh but the other other thing that she gave me was a devotion a a daily devotion for men uh and uh believes for you know all all days of the year and while I was going through this devotion there was three devotions that happened three days in a row that just kind of struck me and uh and as I read them I said wow you know this is something you know here and uh and the title of the devotion was risk risks and um that first slide there I believe um the this was the on January 14 2023 I got this it says and this is the devotion that I'm reading that morning says when God asks you to follow him he often doesn't give all the information about what is happening right away amen when you step out in faith he gives you guidance as you go I said wow he gives you guidance as you go Moses risks his life by approaching pharaoh and leading the Israelites out of captivity Mary risked her marriage her reputation and her future by becoming the mother of Jesus Amen and we we realize that she was yielding to the prophecy of a virgin shall conceive amen and there is a lot on the line for Mary being a man a uh engaged woman and having to go tell Joseph that she was pregnant by an Angel this was real this was a great you know step of Faith amen let's put it that way but it says this following God's will is not without risk the only thing more risky than trusting God is not trusting him I want you to think about that the only thing more risky than than trusting God is actually not trusting him the next when Amen on January 15th uh I go and I pick it up again and it has it says no great things happen without some risk no great things happen without some risk they say no arrest his his reputation by believing that God would flood the Earth as he as he said he would Abraham left his home and Country to go where God sent him those who walk close to God have evidence based on their past experiences that God is real and active in the lives of those who love him God loves to accomplish The Impossible in the lives of his people take him up on it man I start reading this I say well my goodness God loves to accomplish amen The Impossible and the lives of his people but you have to be willing to take him up on it if I could just borrow these words you have to be willing to take the rest amen amen now I'm not going to leave you at risk because I do believe that Christians operate at a different level than that risk level we'll get there in a little bit bear with me the next day January 16th amen that says this you should be ready to risk resources reputation and even some relationships in order to be faithful to God Joshua and Caleb unlike the other spies were willing to risk everything because they trusted God's promises more than their human fears God had already promised the Israelites the land all they had to do was take it amen amen hallelujah God had made many promises in his word for his people will you take the risk of moving ahead and claiming them or will you lose heart and miss the blessing God has in store for you I I I I I I I I I was pondering it you know as I was you know just just real I said man this is really something here you know just reading that and I said you know I Lord just kind of start dealing my heart and I just just kind of put some things together what this word risk means and I'm giving you multiple definitions but uh the first definition is to expose uh to Danger harm or loss a risk is to expose to uh uh to Danger harm or loss and they have different phrases that they they use the word risk and they say something is at risk that means it's exposed to harm or danger they'll also use something like it's not seen amen and for for by it by what by by Faith by it amen the elders obtained a good report Oh Glory to God through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear it goes on to say this in verse 4 by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it he by he being dead yet speaketh amen he says by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God Amen look at this verse 6 says this but without faith come on somebody amen it is impossible Amen to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him faith is a thing that moves God our faith in believing that he can do amen the supernatural for us amen I want to just uh catch a couple quotes here amen as we just kind of move on this first was coming out of the message a super sense I said you know when when the world looks at it it's a risk amen but as Christians we look at it it's a step of faith oh hallelujah it's a step of Faith amen and it take Faith to please God but here in the message of super sense brother random makes this statement and says and we are grateful to God that we have the five senses you know even when you're talking the term of risk sometimes that goes against your senses come on somebody amen I'm a re I don't know if I get to it today but I'm gonna get to it eventually but even uh when it comes to Investments right we make it we take a risk on the investment Hallelujah and sometimes it goes against your your senses amen but yet you're willing to kind of take a chance glory to God hallelujah and he and brother Brandon even give you advice that you should make investments glory to God Amen he said just put it in something solid though a company that can be trustworthy but you shouldn't make investments some and and everybody when they're making Investments everybody got different strategies some people want to make money right away amen they very aggressive with their strategy others are what we call moderates and others have little to no risks amen if they can make two percent that's fine they can put in a CD they'll put in a CD and be happy by making two percent I'm not one of them kind of people amen I want 20 I want 25 I want the most I can get out of my investment brother Brandon says that he says we are grateful to God that we have the five senses but by no means was these five senses given to you to guide you listen he says they were given to you for Earthly contact but there was given to giving you the sixth sense and that Sixth Sense is belongs only to the Christian let me just stop right there some people don't understand the decisions that you make because they have not been gifted with the sixth sense that you have see other people make their decisions on the five senses that the the seed The Taste the smell to hear you know they they make they make the uh the touch they they are they they make their decisions based on what they have but you got something extra and because you're a Christian God has given you that extra sense you make different decisions because you see different things I'm willing to take a step of faith I can trust my God Hallelujah says it only belongs belongs only to the Christian and you cannot have this sick since until you become a Christian it says it's the only way that you can ever have any more than the five natural senses for the natural person but the Sixth Sense is better known to the Christian as faith I like that it is the one that governs and guides you and is superior to all the other senses it's a superior to all of the senses the other five senses let's read faith is the substance glory to God I thank God that I got this this Sixth Sense and when I'm activating it I'm not taking a risk I'm actually just stepping out in faith hallelujah look at what the prophet says says uh and the message faith is the subject says all right now you see what faith is now look friends I know that all of you are at least know this this body is controlled by five senses is that right all right it's got five senses is everything that controls this human body now listen real close and give me your attention now these senses five senses is this right see taste feel smell here is that right then five senses control the entire human body it says is that true see taste spill smell and hear now there's none of them that declare faith none of them declare faith faith is the Sixth Sense known to some people as you want to as mental telepathy or whatever you want to call it see since he says whatever you want to call it I'ma call it risk that's what some people would call it's a risk no not for the Christian it's not a risk it's a step of faith and without faith it's impossible for me to please my God amen amen oh hallelujah amen whatever you want to call it many of them call it names but to me it's faith and that is that is in and above all five senses of the human body you see what I mean faith is the only direct and positive sense glory and it's the Sixth Sense faith is more than sight faith is more than feeling you do not feel Faith amen you don't taste faith you don't smell Faith come on Church you don't see faith but faith is the substance of things hoped for the Eminence of Things Not Seen it says here see this Bible now I want the Bible now I'm looking at it now I want it I mean you know just just just kind of uh imagine the prophet you know what he's saying here see this Bible say I want the Bible I'm looking at it I want it now Faith is a substance of things hoped for the evidence of things I do not see see what I mean it says now here in my pocket I think there's an old barley knife Barlow knife I've carried for years now I don't see that knife glory to God I do not feel that knife I do not taste that knife I do not smell that knife but I know that that knife is in there how do you know because I believe it's in there watch this now if it's not in there if it's not in there what you see won't put it in there what you feel won't put it in there what you hear won't put it in there what you tapes will not put it in there amen but your faith will put it in there if it's not there brother random say that chokes you that chokes you but that's true he says if you believe all things are possible you afraid to take God friends you're scared now I might have left that knife laying on the dresser where I changed clothes a while ago but just as sure if that knife is on the dresser right now if I believe if I believe with all believing with all my heart it'll be in my pocket how does it get from the dresser to my parking faith thank you [Music] Faith amen things are unlimited when you activate your faith you can do things you never thought you could do when you activate your faith come on somebody you got the most powerful thing you can have in your perception faith in the almighty God oh Hallelujah he says it'll be in my pocket that chokes you but God is able to put it there if you believe it you know I was just kind of thinking on this because it just it just blesses me you know we we we're reading there in the scripture with with Peter you know and uh when you when you like I told you go back and you read the story right after they had uh fed these these these 5 000 people with two fish and five loaves of bread now you gotta you know if you go back and we don't have time to read it all but you go back and you just look at that that story the disciples were coming to Jesus and tell them saying now look you're gonna need to send the people away they uh it's getting late they don't have nothing to eat the Shop's gonna be closed by the time they get there so you have to cut your sermon short Jesus and send the people away and Jesus Jesus already knew what he was getting ready to do can I tell you that amen uh just encourage you whatever you're going through right now the Lord already knows what he's gonna do and in his mind it's already done we just trying to figure it out right but but Jesus already knew what he was going to get ready so he just kept preaching he kept preaching and the disciples maybe if I can just imagine Peter being the one like Jesus we we told you to send these people away Jesus said now go out and find what we got out there what kind of what food we got say now Jesus ain't no shops opening you know he said just go find what we got they come back from you know 5 000 people in the camp five thousand and and I love to just put it this way because they went to one person say you got anything that you can share that we can feed the people with I ain't got nothing went to the next one you got anything we can share we can see to be with I ain't got nothing went to the next one you got anything we can you can share we can feed the people with I ain't got nothing now every time they hurt I ain't got nothing they got more and more discouraged Hallelujah and here's the here's the sad part they went through four thousand nine hundred 99 people and found nothing nobody had nothing but there was a little boy say well you know what I did bring my lunch I got two fish and five loaves of bread said well he told us to ask so if that's all you got we'll take that back to him and he'll compete I can it's just in my imagination Jesus you told us to go through all these people guess without a 5 000 people only one person has something that we can work with only one and you want to know what he got two fish and five loaves of bread Jesus did not tell you that you should have sent the people home earlier Jesus why did you do it like this say Peter just relaxed calm down give me the two fish in the five loaves of bread and they took the two fish and the five loaves of bread and then he broke it he blessed it he broke it and then he said now you give it out to the people and as they begin to give it up to the people praise God they take one fish out of the basket and one loaf of bread and give it here and they look back in the basket it was another fish and some bread and Not only was it fish it was cooked fish it all and it bypass processes hey we serve them we serve a God that's concerned about every need he wants serving raw fish it was cooked fish and I can imagine the disciples saying you wanted baked or you want to boil what kind of fish you want because we got it right here every time they reached in there was something there amen amen but they had to take a step of faith and just follow what Jesus was telling them and after this great miracle powerful miracle Jesus finally tells him now y'all y'all y'all go on get in the ship I'll get the people out I'll get them back to their place but y'all going and getting the ship and the Bible say he constrained them just imagine what he was going through to get them fellas in the ship and imagine maybe they said no no we ain't going nowhere we just saw them fishing in bread we ain't going nowhere we gonna stay right here and watch for the next Miracle but they didn't realize where the next Miracle is going to be happening amen Jesus is already a couple steps ahead he knew what the next miracle was but in order for you to see the next Miracle you got to be in the right place at the right time amen go get him the boat fellas go get in the boat go get in the boat oh all right Jesus can you handle it you can handle all them as 5 000 of them now can you I got them I got him go go get in the boat go get in the boat all right they're sitting there in that building and they just they just you know just probably rejoicing over you know the uh the miracle that just happened and all of them would partake us of that Miracle they all were giving out Fish and Loaves everybody had some Jesus told them to give it out to the people so all the disciples were partaking in this miracle now they're on the boat just maybe having a testimony service and you know sometimes things can be happening you can be talking about the Lord and you don't even realize the dangers that's around you amen the devil don't like King your conversation so that's why he surrounds you with danger but here they are on the boat and a storm just presents itself out of nowhere and I just love the way the Bible uh reads because Jesus knew that that storm would be there and in here you know as we read and let's go back and just kind of pick it up here in Scripture amen back in uh uh Matthew 15. verse 24 it says but the ship was now in the midst of the sea toss with waves for the wind was contrary a man and in the Fourth Watch of the night Jesus went unto them walking on the sea my God and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled now here's here's the thing that I get then I I here's the thing that just kind of gets me when I read this they weren't troubled at the uh at the sea in the conditions of the sea but they were troubled by Jesus coming to walk to them Hallelujah somebody glory to God Amen they were in trouble by the conditions they were men of the sea so they understood that and they knew they could probably work work through that but what they got troubled by is when Jesus came walking to them Lisa is saying it is a spirit that cried out for fear can you see these men on the boat crying out because Jesus is walking to him look he says but straightway Jesus spoke unto them saying be of good cheer in his eyes be not afraid I think right when they heard them words that just dropped everything that dropped that level of fear once they heard from the word of God it drops the level of fear anytime you hear from the word of God it will drop your level of fear and I just love this next statement Peter answered and say Lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the water and he said come now now let's let's just get on the scene and imagine what is going on here amen Peter actually thought he was going to challenge Jesus Peter says if it really be you because I think this is a spirit but if it be you then speak back to me and tell me to come out there Oh Glory to God now now when we use the term risk this is a risky move you know I heard my daughter recently say there's no way that I'm gonna jump I'm gonna jump out of a perfectly good airplane you know people go uh uh pair uh skydiving in there I think the parent Paris something Pierce that man said but it's a it's a I'm in a in a I got a parachute on my back I'm in a good airplane and I'm just gonna jump out of it she says no way I'm gonna jump out of a perfectly good airplane now if the airplane going down that's another story I might jump out I'm gonna take that risk but if the airplane is in good shape ain't nothing wrong with it I'm not getting out the plane parachute or no parachute I'm not taking that risk same thing about Peter this is a perfectly good boat I know that there's a storm out here but it's still a good boat we ain't taking no damage yet and you invite me to get out of this good boat to come walking on the sea but the problem is Peter you put out a challenge [Applause] it came out of your mouth Peter you the one said if it be you then bid me come and Jesus ain't gonna explain it Jesus ain't gonna give no paragraphs he ain't gonna give no sentences he can't even show you what somebody did this before you this is the very first time this has ever happened oh my and I I like this because as I was pondering this and thinking on it you know Jesus could have told Peter no Peter you can't come this ain't for you you weren't born like I was born I was a virgin boy Son of God Amen and see I got I got a I'm God Almighty In the Flesh and you know I realize I got control over this so Peter you can't do that that's not what Jesus said Jesus said come there is an invitation for you to experience the supernatural Peter Peter took a great risk but there was great reward because Peter is the only man That Ever Walked the water just like Jesus did never was recorded before and never was recorded after there was great reward because he was able to take a step of faith but when you read the scripture the Bible says he said come and notice the very next thing and when Peter was come down how long do you think it took Peter to get down out the boat for me I don't think Peter just just jumped out that boat I think Peter's really thinking about it now wait a minute I know I see him and he and now he just invited me to come I told him if it was him then beat me coming he just invited me to come like oh come say it again Jesus say it like you mean to Jesus say with some authority Jesus please I can't do this come and I can see Peter just working maybe working to get off one side of the boat maybe and ain't like oh Lord ain't no way I'm gonna be oh this is this is I'm not I'm impossible unheard of no way I know about the fishing lows I fed them yes I did do that but now I walk on water come and I can see Peter just taking his time getting out that boat because I I think Peter's a little bit like me and I'd be a little afraid to jump out a perfectly good boat and try to I be reasoning all in my mind see Jesus you can do that because you Jesus but you talk about me I'm a failure I'm this I'm that ain't no way the water gonna hold me like that come oh I don't want to hear your excuses I don't hear you're failures I don't want to hear none of that come I can see Peter just just oh maybe looking at the boys he told you to come Peter you asked you got it Peter go not there don't push me don't push me don't push me and I can see Peter take a a just a small step of Faith he put one foot on the water one foot in the boat and he kept this one in the boat because he's like hey if this don't work I got something to hold on to but then he put a little weight in the water Brothers Brothers is just as strong on the water as it is in the boat Brothers I I ain't never felt nothing like this but since he bit me to come I'm coming Peter got out there begin to walk on water but the Bible say he began to look at the winds you weren't looking at that before why are you gonna look at that now you already walking you might as well keep on walking guess what you already done took a step of Faith just keep walking by faith not by sight [Applause] man Peter was walking next thing they saw them boisterous wins and he's saying you know what this is impossible this is impossible and I just love the way the scripture let's let's says but when he saw divorces wins he was afraid to begin seeking he cried Lord save me this is the thing that I really like about it just I just you know it's a it's a story that we we've heard many times amen but it's just so refreshing different different seasons of your life you know I was just saying to say uh even though Peter fell he walked and all another thing in that is that he was walking with the right person [Applause] because Jesus was still there that when he cried out for salvation Lord save me he had somebody that could lift him up even in his Fallen condition he had somebody can lift him up he was already there he knew that Peter was going to walk he knew that Peter was going to fall he knew that he has to lift Peter up but you can't take Peter's testimony from him he walked on water hey man and the reason Peter could do that is because he was willing to take a risk and I like to use this where he was willing to step out on faith and I set my time a little shorter today and I want to just share 10 things with you and I'ma leave and I'll come back and pick this up but there's I was reading you know that that that uh the these devotions on risk and it just kind of led me I was thinking about Peter I got a lot of other people in Scripture that I can talk about but uh for time's sake I'm not going to do it today but um it took me I went and and just kind of did a quick search on uh on wrists and um 10 inspiring quotes about the rewards of taking risks and these are business people that say this and I just want to just give you this the first one came from Martin Luther King Jr he said take the first step in faith you don't have to see the whole staircase just take the first step the next one comes from Sarah Parish she says living with fear stops us from taking risks and if you don't go out on the branch you're never going to get the best fruit next one comes from Paula uh Coelho says pitiful is the person who's afraid of taking risks perhaps this person will never be disappointed or this a disillusion perhaps she won't suffer the way people do do when they have a dream to follow but when the person looks back she will hear her heart I like that right I mean you know when you know when you're afraid to take a risk you know you probably never experience any disappointments because life will always stay the same you'll never be disillusioned yeah you'll never you'll never experience any of those highs and lows but but but but but but when you are willing to take that risk you'll look back and you'll realize I gave everything I had the next one says 20 years from now you would be more disappointed by the things you didn't do no matter ones you did so throw off the bow lines sail away from the Safe Harbor catch the trade winds in your cells explore dream discover Mark Twain the number five number the fifth one comes from a person by the name of yvetta uh turn of the mark it says only those who play win only those who risk when history favors Risk Takers it forgets the tenant everything else is commentary and just think about the different ones in scripture you know I mean uh I I didn't I didn't tell you that John got out the boat I didn't tell you amen that that that uh uh Andrew got out the boat you know Thaddeus I I ain't tell you no no other disciple that got a Peter is the one that got out the boat because Peter was willing to take a step of faith that's true oh Jesus here the number six one says I always did something I was little not ready to do I was a little not ready to do I think that's how you grow when there's that moment of wow I'm really not sure I can do this and you push through those moments that's when you have a breakthrough you I mean you ain't got nothing else but I all I can do is go full for it that's when you have a breakthrough and I I always I make this statement say when you get to a point of a breakthrough you can have two it's one of two breaks either break through or break down I ain't breaking down for nothing I'm going through glory to God look at this number seven if you are not willing to risk the unusual you will have to settle for the ordinary from Jimmy Ron if you're not willing to risk the unusual you'll have to settle for the UN for the for the ordinary number eight the biggest risks is not taking any risk in a world that is changing really quickly the only strategy that is guaranteed to fail is not taking risks that's mark Zuckerberg it should have been a g I messed up on that one I'm sorry number nine do the thing you fear most and the death of fear is certain anybody want to kill fear fear you're no longer welcome here Papa's here praise God hey Mark Twain said that do the thing you feel the most and the death of fear is certain like I told you all one time people that were afraid of spiders one of the ways to overcome you know being afraid of a spider they said just run through a spider web run through it just run through it run through it run don't walk through it run through it run through it you break that fear glory to God glory to God here the last one create a risk taken is essential to success in any goal where the stakes are high faultless risks also are destructive of course but perhaps even more wasteful is thoughtless caution which prompts inaction and promotes failure to seize opportunity Gary Ryan Blair see it takes something to take a step of faith and and here's the thing we have a sense that others don't have and that's why I can I can go through the scriptures I mean I'll call out some amen amram and yoshibed amen David right uh when he faced Goliath I mean different ones uh that that's in the scripture so so many others that we can just kind of go down and and for they took a risk the Hebrew voice Daniel and the Lion's Den I mean all of these people took a risk at some point in time but the reason that they're recording scriptures because they was willing to take that step of faith when I read Hebrews 11. sir and I see here in in the Bible it has all these different Risk Takers if I can if I can just call them that way amen if I can just calling away but but you know you you read There by faith uh Moses by faith come on Amen Abraham uh let me start at the beginning by faith Abel by faith Enoch amen by faith Noah by faith Abraham Risk Takers come on y'all amen uh uh look at this by faith Sarah glory to God also we have we have here glory to God by faith Isaac by faith Jacob by faith Joseph by faith Moses by faith Joshua I mean we can go through all these stories I just don't have time by faith rehab come on church amen by faith Barack jephthah amen David Samuel uh they got all these different ones that are here in the Bible about faith by Faith by faith but I didn't want to just leave it to the people in the Bible amen I want to put our names in there is that okay we're gonna put our names and I'm getting ready to I'm I'm closing real early today but we're gonna put our names in the scripture amen because we're also a man able to step out on faith now I can't call all your names but I'ma Point At You you say your name by faith Jack by faith by faith by Faith by faith by faith by Faith by Faith by faith by faith by faith by faith by Faith by faith by Faith by Faith by Faith by Faith by faith

Faith by Faith by Faith by faith [Applause] you're very willing to step up by faith and I'm going to tell you one thing everyone that we read here in Scripture that moved out by faith they were rewarded for their faith there's great rewards when we use our faith God bless your church [Applause] let's pray father we thank you Lord um for your word we thank you for your truth God we can look at uh different ones in the scripture realize they weren't moved they weren't just moved by risk taking they had a sixth sense on the inside that caused them to ex to to accept the challenge that you would present Lord sometimes they were not able to read stories about other people that had done some of the things that they did but yet oh God uh they they took that step of faith and you produce great things Lord these are testimonies we can go back and read and get strength and encouragement we look at Peter stepping out of that boat mine Lord that was just something that that um had never been done before they had never seen it but when they saw you walking on Warden and I'm so glad that Peter he probably didn't even think about it but he said it before he could think he says if it be you then then bit me come he didn't realize what he said but he had to operate on come father we're operating on that today by faith we accept whatever you've placed before us and father we know that we'll be rewarded because you are rewarder of those that diligently seek you God is in Jesus name that we pray amen amen praise the Lord for the Solomon you can just take it from here just for a
