you can be seated man let me just get uh the announcements there for tonight well it's good to be back in the house of the Lord um once more and uh I was contemplating whether we would have the service tonight after such a weekend uh but uh when I was talking to brother Lee and realized that he didn't fly home until tomorrow and I'm like well my if he's going to be here that long we need to have a service and we need to have brother Lee preach for us uh his first time uh in the US and uh he came for um these um the meetings the um uh his wife precious wife two daughters some of the Saints from the church uh you know came along with them and we're so happy to have you all with us Amen on tonight amen uh so I won't take too much time I'll just go through the announcements and that way we'll have brother Lee come uh shortly uh so Sunday don't forget we'll have uh prayer from 9: to 10 and then the service will start at 10:30 uh Sunday school um from 9:30 10 uh for our youth and young adults and our streaming continues through Twitter Facebook and our church website I wanted to make mention that um so we we streamed the night of worship um and the service on Sunday and that is currently on you can find it on on our Facebook Channel sat Tabernacle however over the weekend we will be um kind of taking it down temporarily the the brothers want to make some edits to the video in order to improve uh just the quality of it and uh you know so they ask that we just kind of take it down so you'll see it go away for a few weeks so I I would I would suggest that if you want to see it relive The Experience try to do it over the next couple days because it will go down temporarily until we get the edits done uh so keep that in mind also uh we have the combined service coming up uh in Miami September 29th that's going to be at Eagles temple with uh brother Bernard so uh keep that that service in mind as well um and our giving is uh online Zale cash app or PayPal zel is the preferred giving method s simply because cash app and PayPal takes fees uh from the giving so we ask that everyone if you have zel use that uh if you need cash app or PayPal uh we just ask that you email the trustees they'll give you the information that you need to to use cash app or PayPal if you want to mail something in that's the address at the bottom of screen and those that are inside the sanctuary our giving is done we have a box in the very back of the church as you're going out you can use that box uh to do your giving amen praise the Lord all right I think that's all I need to announce so good to see uh everybody I see sister Jessica back there amen it's good to have her uh in service um and it's going to be I'm going have to call her doctor sister Jessica soon amen but we thank God for her amen we really really appreciate her and I see sister Lon amen God bless you Sister Lon uh good to have you with us tonight and uh brother um brother Stephen and sister Rachel as well we thank God Amen to have them with us tonight praise the Lord all right so let's uh let's just prepare our hearts to receive leave uh brother Lee uh tonight I I I'm trusting that God's going to use him to drop something on purpose just for us tonight amen a very uh uh special brother to me and like I like I said he's the pastor that usually hosts when I go over to uh Australia we've been a couple times and and have uh plans to go a little later this year for some meetings there as well and um and and looking forward to you know our time that we always enjoy ourselves there something about the Saints in Australia uh they know how to have church amen they know they're not going to sit and look at you they're going to pull on the word and yes amen come on preach it now I mean you're going to get all that from Australia so uh uh but we thank God for them so let's stand amen let's sing a course of Amazing Grace amen as brother Lee comes tonight amen Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound that saved a rich like me I once was lost but now I'm found was blind but now I see let's sing it again oh thank you amen let see the rich like [Music] me was lost now was blind but now I see amen God bless you brothers and sisters [Applause] amen God bless you so good to be in the United States and it's my first trip outside of Australia as a minister of the gospel and it's always challenging and it's always nervous that's why I don't like to travel when I see a elder or senior that comes down H I take full advantage of it and um you know you don't know how precious brother Jack is I um you may have your seats I take Liberty th this evening um because how I got to know brother Jack was for a sister that we had seen and we were just overwhelmed on her product Propet of God said you let the product sell itself and so when Brenda Lewis I was looking up on YouTube I saw Mahalia Jackson arita Franklin and then I saw this little lady all right on a record cover Brenda Lewis yeah well I hadn't heard of Brenda Lewis so I just tapped it on and lo and behold I heard the song it's already done and I I knew Cloverdale had sung that song I Knew Cloverdale I said nah that's Cloverdale so I got a little bit more no nosy so I saw Jack's mom you know say Thumbs Up Click on so I clicked on roses yeah and and from there I saw brother Wesco now brother Wesco was in the service and they were having some meetings and I believe you were all there because brother Jack was there and so when brother Jack sung the song speak into the app that was my favorite song at that time and I said no they can't be right I I'm hearing something that you know I'm not accustomed to because back home we grew up on you know the traditional gospel singers and there's nothing wrong with them but that's how we grew up on and I showed brother Molly and brother mly goes you sure I said well there's a tall brother and there's brother brother Brandon they're a message Church they have to be a message church and um so we we this and I say this this is the only time we said I wish and brother M and I said I wish we could have him over here and lo and behold Joseph chosi yeah started the ball running that's right but Brenda Lewis put the seed in and even beyond the grave she put the seed in and that's why I always encourage and I always say to our young ones you learn from your elders right you learn the trade from the elders because the elders have set the path for each and every one of us and sometimes we disrespect them because they say they're oldfashioned all right but brother Bram said it's the oldtime Holy Spirit and the devil won't go near it that's why he fears it but for us we don't fear anything of God because we are all the Hallelujah so when we hear that same song and we hear that same message we can't help but say Amen to every time we hear because it's a part of our DNA so when we gather together as Believers and understand that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever it can never change it don't matter if you're in New Zealand it don't matter if you're in America it don't matter if you're in Zimbabwe the same God is still the same yesterday today and [Applause] forever now that's the sister that sung a song All Right singing heals amen singing protects you we're afraid to sing because we're afraid of what might happen in our lives it might get exposed all right all right yes sir Prophet said you leap as high as you love all right there too many leapers that ain't living the right life but you don't have to stay in that condition you don't have to stay in that same place all you need is the Holy Ghost and Fire and it'll keep you alive Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday 7 day week praise God he ain't a dead God Amen he's a living God yes he is yes so when we heard and brother chosi brother Wesco came yes now we call him Papa Wesco all right so that's the reason partly why we're here cuz his boy that's right he said he told me he isn't too well now they didn't give me too much information but I don't need that I just said is he well yeah he said he's well and so we came and and we that's why we're here and the girls said why don't we go with the concert brother Jack left Australia his last favorite words in 2019 double double you know when he said that double double Melbourne went down for two years under Co oh so they came over and we had the concert and I'd have to say that was that was something that was [Applause] something I like to say God bless you young men and it's good to see you and when I stream and sometimes I have a peeky poo and have a look at brother Jack and you know I sometimes hear how brother Jack say you know when young ministers want to come they ring him up they want to preach here you know how brother Jack feels I said praise God I might get under that radar and I got a shock when he rung me up but I always see the young man you know it's going to take the young men yes sir amen and and you you keep pressing on it does it gives me joy one soul and when brother Jack La left last year we we had three marri marriages straight after it and you know these were young men young men that were that weren't Christians they don't have a family Christian background these are three men that were born under Catholic in influence one young man is a Chinese but straight after the service one of the brothers said I need to get married I said wow that that's good that's good he felt a conviction amen he wanted to get married and I and I always encourage young people if you you get married don't leave it too long so one the first brother he didn't take too long he took one month gave me one month to prepare my God now his brother was no better he gave me one day wow and then when brother Gabriel he gave me two weeks God so I gave a warning I said Brothers give me time to be able to prepare myself so you know when you have a Revival yes and the prophet God said you need a killing to have a Revival that's what he said now these boys had a killing they at the meeting they said those was the best meetings they've ever gone to the best meetings they have ever gone to in their whole life and they're just young menow and straight away the first thing they want to do is getting married wow wow and two sisters Three Sisters had been there had been waiting and they got married so this is the marriage amen there's going to be a marriage supper of the land sir but you got to be married right here hallelujah don't let no nothing discourage you my God don't let uh other things discourage you and getting married all right because natural types are spiritual and when the church is in married and Christ Hallelujah she can't wait amen amen she's under expectation that she's to see her husband Hallelujah and when they get over Yonder Hallelujah I said to the brothers in the and brother West Coast Church it's going to be the biggest and greatest youth meeting ever we won't be old anymore we'll be young again Hallelujah no more gray hair Hallelujah no more bald head anymore sisters you're going to have some nice long hair hallelujah amen he's a good God yes in the good time and in the bad time he's a good God hallelujah Glory you love him tonight amen let's rise and stand before I forget to say scripture this morning praise the lord it's good to be in the fellowship where you feel at home amen so our trip to Australia has not been from Australia to America has been 13 hours but our trip here has been a blessing praise God because for us it's it's different for me I've never been outside and and it's been a blessing even though you know Florida's got their things but the people yeah the Saints yes the cream of the crop Hallelujah that's my highlight amen let us pray dearly father Lord we certainly come to you in this precious time and knowing that everything Lord that you said that have it in order and God and you're a God of order you're a God of Holiness and we thank you for the little Fellowship that you have here and we're expecting big things from you for the fellowship and one of these days that she will have a building and that she would gather together Lord you've seen the sacrifices you've seen the many blessings that the fellowship have uh laid before others Lord and we thank you for the examples we thank you for your dedication for brother Jack Lord not only is he a pastor not only is he a father a grandfather but he's our brother in Christ Lord and we certainly thank you for him and opening his sacred desk for me this evening Lord I would rather as my children said they said Daddy we hear you all the time we want to hear Brother Jack and I and I pray that Lord whatever I may say may it touch someone tonight Lord and I ask that very sincerely this evening we pray and ask amen praise the Lord let us enter our scripture to Psalms 103 all right GL to God and we'll read was I was going to read to 1 to 17 but I just feel to read from 1 to three it says he bless the Lord oh my soul and all that is within me bless His holy name bless the Lord all my soul forget and forget not all his benefits yes sir who forgiveth all thy iniquities and health all thy diseases you may have your seats turn your brother and sister and say God bless you and welcome one another again amen God bless amen Lord hallelujah amen the scripture says here bless the Lord oh my soul and I I certainly believe that sometimes we feel like that as Brother David did you know to bless the Lord all my soul and his and he's a holy God and and we should never ever forget all his benefits that he bestows upon us and many times we we do forget because we as we've had Co for two years and one Minister say we we shouldn't be afraid of Co the thing that we should be afraid of is TB and TB is we too busy amen and and sometimes I say to the church don't be a CEO of a church that's a Christmas Easter only Christian so we should be always a Believer all the time and we not we should never ever forget God's goodness and his grace and mercy that is shared upon us and you know you could have had tonight you could have had a nice peaceful night and you wouldn't have to listen to me but you chose to come here tonight because you wanted to be in church you know with a deer cth unto the he he's calling this a deer calleth unto the water Brooks so my soul is calling unto thee and that's our expectation daily that God that we should live as though he's coming right now Hallelujah we don't want to look to the the future we see the politics and certainly the whole world is looking at America but you know we should be looking to Israel because she is our time piece Hallelujah and if she's our time pieace Hallelujah it should put something in us tonight that we should be into battle with the devil Hallelujah we shouldn't make peace with the devil we shouldn't put things in place with the devil we should be able to say devil you have no preeminence and devil you don't have no preeminence in my life right now even though you may come in my family attack my children attack the my wife my father or whoever it may be but rest assure he is my benefits Hallelujah he has the resources for me this message is the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah he forgiveth all your iniquities yes there is nothing that God cannot forgive you right now that's right but we put doubt we put fear we put things in front of our heavenly father but yet he's done everything for us praise God Amen yes we know that the Lord executes righteous in judgment yes sir but God is also merciful that's right God is also gracious God is also slow to Ang God yes amen that's right and he's plenteous in Mercy amen he's plenteous in Mercy hallelujah we're not asking for judgment we're asking for Mercy we're ask asking Mercy for my child for my backsliding children we're asking God God of the impossible right now Hallelujah when the Lord is merciful amen for those that seek him you got to be seeking that's right you can't rely on brother Jack all the time that's right amen oo that's right we say amen amen you got to do your homework you got to get the after preacher the after preacher after the main after brother Jack's preach the main preacher comes on my God you go home and study your word study your inheritance see who you really are amen amen you know we all drive vehicles we all got cars you know prophet of God said it there's a dynamic amen there's the mechanics and the Dynamics yes sir how many times he says you need the gasoline to turn on the car amen all right praise the Lord amen you got the wheels that have to function you got the engine got to function you got the gearbox to function right but then in that inner place where there's at holies of holies where at Sanctuary you got a battery and that battery needs a negative and a positive you can't separate them don't matter how much gasoline you got if you got the key but if you don't have the spark Glory that's caused by the battery yes sir batter's got a positive right that's right batter's got a negative right my brother you got to put them together amen you can't separate them when you have problems Rejoice Hallelujah see what the Lord can do when things go wrong rejoice praise God we don't want to Rejoice oh we want people to feel heartbreak come on we're human amen there's a season all right there's a time but there's a blessing am blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled not a if not a but not a maybe he's a all oh God right amen he's not part-time half time amen there's no time out in this game brothers and sisters it's all the way amen David expresses the blessings of the Lord who is able amen who is able the one that dwells within you amen the one that's inside of you all right the one that always tells you to do the right and when you would rather do the wrong in the easy way he's the one that's in that in the century he's got your negative he's got your positive I know you don't want the negative for brothers and sisters to get the car moving you need a positive and a negative and they have to be connected in that secret place he is your Hiding Place Hallelujah that's where he dwells brothers and sisters and he's there to bless the Bible says blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom amen of Heaven blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted is he a comforter amen he comforts you Hallelujah rest the show we're confident that God at this moment at this time that God has got brother Wesco in his hands Hallelujah we don't have to worry we don't have to Fright we have to say Lord make me stand in that position that thy brother has stood for me Hallelujah we went to the fellowship we sat in the church I said to the church brothers and sisters if I don't get to see brother Westco this is the next best thing seeing the reflection of the body seeing the examples of the body Hallelujah I know brother Wesco may not be able but there are ones that are able there are ones that are able to take the fire there are ones that are there that are going to lay the path for the younger ones amen don't put it under a buoro yes let your light shine sir don't don't say oh I don't want to I don't want to show this to my friends at work my God the question was answered me a question was asked me when I was working I was a Christian young Christian young family and a young man came up to me and he said Lee the reason why you go to church cuz you don't want to drink you don't want to go smoking you only go to church cuz that's your protection we can we can say that yeah yeah all right yeah I like that be honest yeah amen I said no come on come on the only reason why you're not like the way you are because you go to church and if you don't go to church you fall just like me I said no oh my no he said I do the I don't do these things because I go to church but you should you should keep it standing you should love holy you should love righteous you don't come to church to be a disgrace you come to church to be a light so somebody else can say I'm one of them I say to him nope I go to church I praise my God and I don't do all these things because I choose not to do it that's right that's right you've got the right prop of God said you have a choice you're on free moral agency but it's a dog you feed it's the one you feed the most will bring the result and brother Baron said when you create an atmosphere glory to God when you get on your knees to pray that brings results amen you got to be desperate Hallelujah who loves being desperate praise God Amen who loves free benefits oh Hallelujah I'm one of them amen I'm one of them Hallelujah I'm one of them brothers and sisters I was saying to the church on Sunday brother Jack we were traveling with my my daughter and you know baggage you remember when you came you had to unload you had to unload your bag put everything in your jacket all right to ease up the load in his baggage that's Australia yeah amen so they come through and while we were about to hop on the plane they brought the the way and they stood in front of our terminal and they were weighing everybody's baggage and I said to Claudia Claudia what's my baggage is this 10kg she said no Dad it's seven I said I'm pretty sure you said 10 you know sometimes you go deatha so we're the last ones on the plane because we're the first front seats I said Claudia you know where I get my finances I don't justify by by using my finance because I made a mistake I'm being honest all right now cuz God sees how you spend your finances amen he's the bookkeeper amen the book of book The Rock of the ages the Bible means basic instruction before you leave Earth so I said to claudon I said claudon come on she said don't worry dad and I preach it every Sunday don't worry don't doubt God is rich in Mercy and here I am so they come up and every person that was coming through was getting checked and the airline said you have to pay and I so we came through so they checked my bag and it's supposed to be 7 kg mine came at 9. seven and I went and Claudia was pretty good she came at n uh 7.4 then the lady said take your bag off weighed that as well that ended up to 8.4 so we were both overweight brother Jack you're boarding your plane and all these things are coming through your mind but you know there was one thing that did come into my mind and that's why I say about listen to Elders brother kaidra digs he brought a message he says he's sometimes impatient when he's at the the plane terminal and sometimes he kind of f fusses with them because they haven't done it quickly enough and then he said maybe God wants me to go in first class but because I'm too busy fussing with them come on brother you see I I remembered that and straight away she gets her notebook or her her calculator cuz she's she's booked to everyone brothers and sisters seeing everybody pulling out their wallets and pulling out their credit cards and man I was but at that point at that very moment my mind went totally blank totally Blank Brother Jack I wasn't going to fight it I wasn't going to justify it I wasn't going to fight for my rights right my rights so I just stayed there now she got her calculator and remember Church she has booked every person that's come on that's overweight so she gets her calculator and she starts going through it she looks at me she pushes it again she looks at me again now she's moving a little bit uncomfortable and while she's trying to get on to line she turns to me sir I think we have a [Music] [Applause] glitch brothers and sisters he is The Great I Am he's The Great I Am yes he is I've got a glitch I can't get through brothers and sisters I said I was inside like a big baby I was a man like this but inside I was going oh praise God hallelujah I'm your son and you've never left me you n for second me in a time of I receive your benefits he gives you benefits and then she says to me you can go in sir and we're walking in like this brother Jack and choria turned around see [Music] [Applause] dead he's rich and Mercy we don't want judgment we want Mercy Mercy re my life Hallelujah he's given us away and we got to tap into brother Wesco he had preached it yes sir tap into those resources 224 that same message still applies right now amen yes don't go back and say well brother Wesco said that brother Jack said that I can't believe what they say my God try them test themen confess amen speak into the atmosphere we don't confess enough that's exactly right cuz when we confess we Rejoice Glory we Rejoice we come to church rejoicing we come Rejoice say Lord thank you for everything that you've done for me am Hallelujah is he rich in Mercy he is he blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain Mercy amen sometimes when I somebody when we say we want true love real love God's going to test you on that love he's going to test you if the benefits of working amen like I say he's the book officer amen he comes and checks up if you're merciful when somebody steps on your foot my my my Florida Miami oh yeah you know what I'm talking about no indicating cutting three lanes across oh and if you're too slow beep beep yes brother brothers and sisters that made me feel at home cuz Australia is exactly the same hallelu the same devil that's here is the same devil in Australia but I'm blessed assured Jesus is M cuz I know the same Jesus is here is the same Jesus in New in New Zealand and Australia amen glory amen glory so if you want Mercy you have to be merciful just test yourself your children are the best examples of testing your your character that's why I always say to young people you enjoy your single life you do have some responsibilities you do have certain things that you have to be responsible that's right giving to God 100% but when you become married and you have children that's when the challenges stop amen all right and sometimes God's got to put you through things that you don't want to go through but God's got to have a perfect bride he's got to have a perfect prde without spot or wrinkle so we come to the understanding that David would pour out his heart he would say th you are my Hiding Place amen amen he's got to be The Hiding Place amen praise God hallelujah amen says here I've heard in Matthew it says you've heard that it have been said Thou shalt Love Thy Neighbor hate thy enemy but I say unto you love your enemies amen right bless them amen that curse you amen that's hard when somebody is giving you a one finger salute on the freeway Brothers what do we do do we ch the cheek or do we Chase up and say I want to have a talk with him or do we say God bless you all right now all right they may do one we do five all right that's Grace Hallelujah the more you do it the better you become Hallelujah because the devil knows that when you go to service like tonight I apologize for being late we were just on time just then we went to the petrol station pet pump didn't work on this pump went to the other pump was difficult working the pumps my God and two weeks ago I said to the church when you're when you're wed to come to church and you're so blessed during the week you're so calm he puts the slowest driver in front of you and when you pass him there's another one there's another one there's another one praise God that was just like that tonight I didn't I know how many people were slow drivers but they were slow but I said to the church God is working his patience in you and I so he's got to use somebody for you to overcome he's going to use your brother and sister that's right they might step on your toe and say I ain't coming back to church he stepped on my toe but proper of God said the church is your protection he says when you come to church that's your protection now brother Ben also says Church don't save you but if there's something inside of you you can't wait for the doors to open that's what he's talking about he's talking about that in the man that dwells within you you can't help but come to church you can't help but praise God you can't help but lift your mouth and say Lord I'm dead to the world and as soon as you walk out that door the devil's going to say okay I'm going to prove it he tries the brothers first yeah come on soon as the brothers all go out he going to cut you off he going to put people in front of you he going to rob your joy yes and when he robs your joy your wife can't even make you happy anymore all right now come on all right that's how the devil Works he he he only knows one thing he knows how to bring heartache he knows how to bring pain but when there is pain and heart there's joy in the morning my my my my my there's joy in the morning it's easy to love those that love you but when those that hate you and you might say that brother Lee how do you know in the last 50 minutes going to say this this a personal testimony you say to me how do I know there's a young man in our church this young man he'd come to a camp in Florida in 2018 he was with a Pentecostal girl they were just friends since the age of 14 there was another sister in the church by the name of Naomi now she liked this young man but this young man when he was trying to make his acquaintance people around him would say discouraging things she's not he's not your type he's too chubby you can get somebody better I said to the young sisters if you have a holy ghost filled man that's good enough for you don't matter what he looks like he'll look after you he'll pray for you but don't discourage anything all right now that may be happening because there might be something that God ordains and you might put your foot in it and draw some conclusion so 2018 they come to Camp brother Jack meets this young man this girl is ringing him up in Australia she's complaining to him where are you I'm at a church came no you're not he's one foot in the camp one foot on the out God that's what happens when you [Music] compromise now he tells the Lord when I go back lord if we break up Lord I know it's the will of God he had enough sense to say that enough sense to say that wow so he comes back from 2018 from Camp they break up they break up when they break up he's he's heartbroken it's his first love yes sir so he breaks up with her but he's still FRS now you know the worldly girls you know worldly girls they probably discard him but they still want to keep in communication so she keeps oh how are you I'm so sad how we I got a new boyfriend but he's not really new we've been dating for over a year and your mind goes who you see that's what the world does to believers they manipulate them they try to strip them of every Integrity they have as a human being that's exactly right but it can happen in the church true so the church can also be guilty of the same thing but God knows the beginning from the end brothers and sisters he knows what's good for you even though sometimes you may feel oh I don't feel it Lord but that's your benefits God so what happens and I'll cut the story short because it drives a situation has driven him back into his her arms and that's a personal bit now you may ask what happened people weren't happy with just being friends I understand that but when he's a 24 year old he's an adult he's no longer a child he's an adult he has a right to make his decisions as much as we love to beat our children or smake or dis plan come on we like to keep them here but they end up being there all right sister brandham said that to brother brandham when Rebecca wanted to play some Boogie wogie Blues yeah and she slammed the door and and what did sister Brown said she needs a weapon some of the mothers would have said that too yes sir but brother Brandon knew that he wasn't fighting it flesh and blood huj he was fighting against demon Spirits amen God knows what's best for you so he goes back into a situation that he the Lord told him remember what I said he he made a promise God hears the promise brother Jack counseled me on this bit he said you know brother Lee he has been given a chance and God had broken it up now he's going back to the fire he will have to deal with God it's a what is it in the Bible it says it's a horrible thing to be in the hand of an Angry God so he goes back but she's still got a boyfriend he's just a friend don't you hate that young man I like you as a brother but I don't like you as a boyfriend all right all right come on I I'm saying something that's really personal here so on Easter 2020 he gets a phone call from this Pentecostal girl who they have been staying in the same house remember what you said brother Jack he will have to deal with God that's the coin that's a the uh that's the that's the trouble with young people when God gives you a clear Direction you refuse to listen to God and we ask God he's rich in Mercy but when Mercy's there we want judgment when God when brother said we fight our way to hell when God has given us Mercy my God so he goes back he gets a me message he's heartbroken brother Jack and this is the reason why I wanted to come and talk about this particular subject to brother Jack because brother Jack was a was a part of that 2018 when this young boy met brother Jack he was Star Struck you ever a pray sister should be proud of your son when young men can get Star Struck and he said he said you know when I saw Jack brother Jack I was lost for words I said that's good that's good enough for me so when Jack gave me the counsel and I knew what I was up against so in Easter of 2020 just before is it 2022 what year was it honey 21 he goes and he makes a a nuisance of himself he goes and Facebook and he writes a message on Facebook he said Mom Dad I'm sorry that I'm not the son that you want me to be his father's a me his grandfather is a pastor his grandfather is a deacon so he has a good plant for him but brothers and sisters it doesn't matter if you've been in the message 30 40 years until you have a personal experience right that's right then it's just another church it's just another fellowship so at this point he takes off and then the message is relay to the family that he's going to do something fairly stupid CU at the end of his message he says I just want to sleep I've wasted my life see when we realize when it's all is said and done when we come to the end of it what really matter matters is Jesus Christ that's what really matters and he came to the realization that since the age of 14 now he's 24 he's 10 years he's wasted all his life and he just wants to end it so the mother when she receives the message as you all mothers know that's something that you cannot bear your firstborn your firstborn the love of your life the the first born you try to get somebody to try to talk you out of his wrongs that that ain't going to work because mothers know beneath the heart lies a little child so she's crying and wailing and then the husband turns you know the husband doesn't know what to say but the only thing he can say the lord giveth the lord taketh blessed be the name of the Lord because you never now in a situation cuz now he's in God's hands and if he's elected seed if either he repents either he comes back to Christ with repentance if he doesn't and resist it God will take him off so there's no other Comfort but by by Jesus Christ so he he relays it she cries she hollers there's nothing she can do they're traveling 3 hours to go see him they get to his destination brother Jack he's nowhere to be found so we they ring the police officers the police officers there's nothing they can do after 72 hours unless we unless they sign a a document of insanity but he said he's not insane but while this is all happening it's an uncertain battle cuz you just don't know which way it's going to go but that is the that is the most sweetest time when you can go to Heavenly father that's the time you can say Lord I've proved you in the small things this is a giant if you can be with David you can be with this young man but you just got to keep swinging it and you got to let it Loose brothers and sisters it's no good going around the same message over and over and over again you got to let it Loose you got to let the word work Glory when it works by faith praise God so when they had it go and then they pinged them off you know how police taking they can find you and you think you can run away from them they hide in places where you don't think they're hiding they give you tickets where you least expected but they just have a way of finding somebody so they said we don't know where he is he said give me a cell number I'll text you know police detectiv he's answering they pinged him off the towers they find his position now this young man when he was young now he's in a weight of60 kgs depression weight he goes out of this vehicle brother Jack and while he's going out in this vehicle he puts a rope around around his head that was a blessing in disguise cuz sisters he broke the branch at the time he he didn't tell us but when he had calmed down he told us Yeah I broke the branch so he ends up going back to the car and he's sitting in the front seat with a knife in his lap and at that moment the police turn up God will use the authorities for you amen amen like I said there's a glitch there's a glitch praise God so when he came back they escorted him to the the the hospital brother Jack they got him there and he didn't want to go home brother Jackie said I ain't going home the police said yes you are he was forced back home oh literally and I tell you you know when the child is had some things from the world they pick up bad habits bad habits brother Jack and you want to do the Holy Ghost and Fire thing that's what One Pastor said to me he said brother I know you want to do the quick way but you got to let God do it you got to let God do it sometimes he would be in the back room and we would we would preach on Sunday brother Jack you may run but you cannot hide if you're an elected seed God will work on you God will strip you God will bring you to the end of yourself because his word said so am hallelujah amen so he comes to a place I'm winding it up now brother Jack no I'm winding it up he comes to a place brothers and sisters he's coming to church he's sitting in church that's all he's doing he's sitting in church you know some people do sit like that in church they do sit like that in church but the spirit of prayer one day there's going to be a change one day in the atmosphere there's going to be a change he used to come to choir practice brother Evans would have choir practice he would call the young man up and he would go you see this young man can sing he'd been singing in the church since the age of four he'd sung in front of many many great pastors that have come through but it doesn't matter unless you have a personal experience you can be naturally gifted but if you don't let that gift under God's hands so he sits there and the sister Taps him on on the shoulder sister he comes up to him and says Michael that's his name the Lord told me you got to sing this Sunday you sing on this Sunday and he looks he comes back and that person is my son comes back home says Daddy I can't sing at church I said why son said I got Unholy hands I said make them holy get them back into church he said I can't do that Dad I said son if God told me to do something I would do it but Dad I said don't but me if God told me and brother he didn't want to sing he didn't feel like singing but he got up and sung and he sung the prodical son song what happened next the ministry the preaching the washing of the word glory to God Amen did the word am hallelujah hallelujah it did the work not only did he come up to the front that Sunday that he sung came up and gave his heart to the Lord he repented and he's never been the same brothers and sisters he said I wish I'd learned earlier I wish I do you know Dad I I I wish I'd seen Jack I seen I wish I'd seen I said you done a lot of wishing he said I know I should have gone to the and seen brother Jack now I feel so bad I don't want to see him but he did he did praise God and not only that brothers and sisters Michael gave his heart back to the Lord and the sister that I spoke about the benefits said 2011 sister Naomi it struck him should have seen him brother Jackie she was singing uh what was the song At The Cross she was just sitting there singing at the cross and me and the mother were going oh oh oh look at him look at him a you're son and daughter of God God don't hate you God loves you amen that's why he's got benefits for you that's why he's got his mercies and Grace for you so sisters his jaw was way down here and he go Star Struck sister Naomi kept singing and he just kept looking he comes to his mother and I and says to me and her and says Dad don't tell anybody I said I want you know me I keep my mouth quiet I wanted to share it with brother Jack cuz he's been a part of my family sister the counsel that he gave me held me you should be proud of you [Applause] Pastor so Michael comes home say something happened something struck me dad I don't know what it is it's a funny feeling I'm a afraid whereas once he used to be very confident now when something starts to work in your life you start to become humble you're not so quick to lose your temper you're always asking God first so I keep it quiet cuz I know scripture is he's in a a sweet small still voice but Mom oh my I got to tell sister I got to tell somebody sisters yep she went told some sisters and Michael got window of it and he me and he and you know he CU he said he was afraid because he was looking at his life and he was saying to me would she forgive me for everything that I done if you know Naomi she came to my over here she came here she was polite she was sisterly to the girl that he was with not once was she jealous but yet that was her future husband man I I tipped my hat to her and M goes I know that I'm sorry I'm I for I I wish I never said those things so he so he he's he's nervous and brother Jack comes to our meetings preaches beautifully you know he's sitting it out of the park and just whacking it out and I'm just going he said just like he did on on the on the concert man I I say to the church at brother whis go wow that's all I had to say so he's hitting it up and he's so happy but you know what happens in conventions there are other boys that turn up God is rich in Mercy other boys are hanging around sister Naomi Naomi is a very friendly sister she's not flirty she's very friendly she's shaking their hands and Michael's on the other side looking after the convention he said dad I'm going to ask brother mly I said what happened before he said I know but I saw the boys and I like to say in finishing here we have free mark moral agency can we say amen amen I want to say a quote here let us and before I finish people say I I can stay at home be just a good Christian as I can be at church you can't the Bible says not forsaking our assembly of ourselves together that much more as we see the time coming we need each other brothers and sisters without the prayers of the your fellowship brother Westco brother uh um brother um no um Israel po they were there at our meetings a lot of people had prayed for Michael because when he came to Florida he really enjoyed himself because he was around the Believers and so what happened he shifted into gear brother Jack and now in October 26 he's he's going to be married to Sister Naomi [Applause] Naomi means Pleasant m means gift of God and to us it's a pleasant gift of God brother bradam said if you're a Christian you long to go where other Christians are that's in the message of thirsting for Life en closing the fellowship with others Christians so you cannot stay away from church you see he could have stayed home but he couldn't there's a deep call to the deep and if there's a call a deep calling this got to be a response you can't do it because it's he says here I'm hungry but I'll never go to the table I'll never I'll I'll never eat I'll just keep going to it you've got to go and feed on the word of God Amen when you feed you put push out amen when you drink you push out now can you tell can you say do I know this message works I know it works firsthand I know it works my son said to me many many months after everything had died down he said Dad I know not to kill myself I know that because the Bible says it and brother brandom also gives us that Blessed Assurance but Dad I just wanted the pain to go he's our prison help in time and need he's our hiding place and that's why I encourage church if you're struggling just remember one thing he never fails he abides with us and thank you so much tonight thank you so much brother Jack and for us being here and you know I I've certainly been a privilege to be here and just to share this little testimony as well as a little of encouragement what brother Jack asking brother Wesco you know brother Wesco he took the children to to Disney World he drove them up to Disney World I tell you when he B them in the house the children go man it's a mansion this is so flash Michael loved it when Michael was a little bit short of cash brother wisco was there and so the first thing that brother Michael said to me how's brother Wesco I said he's good you just keep praying for him so this October we're going back to do a wedding for Michael and this is why we came to share that testimony but most of all to encourage he's still the same God same God that parted the Red Sea he's still the same God right now Hallelujah whatever your need whatever the problem there is nothing too hard for our Lord amen hallelujah God bless you God bless you amen [Applause] Hallelujah Lord thank you Lord bless you thank you so much amen my God God bless you amen praise the Lord amen appreciate brother Lee on tonight um I was I I knew a portion of his testimony and uh and knowing the family and just remembering back in 2018 when we first met the Saints from Australia they came here to brother West go services and everybody's trying to figure out who them people on the second Road and sisters that is just so on fire and uh a couple Brothers showed up and I believe Mike was playing the guitar you know and and and everything but um I knew that um when I went to um Australia and he wasn't serving the lord at the time time and we're just trying to encourage the pastor um you know you just you say things but you know you're going through yourself while while you're trying to encourage somebody else and uh but when I when I see how the season change and and and if you all don't know Sister Naomi once you meet her you'll never forget her right when she shake your hand when sister Naomi Shake Your Hand and she she give you a good handshake and uh but but you know uh precious saints that are just I mean there's so much encouragement that we can get from there and I I love this because uh even though brother Michael went through this season his life when he comes back and he surrenders everything to the Lord the scripture applies forget not all his benefits there are benefits in serving God yeah benefits and and and the first thing God wants from us is is just a a surrendered and dedicated life uh because see unless you're dedicated to God it's going to be hard for you to be dedicated to a spouse right right uh whether that's husband or wife you have to be dedicated to God first before you can actually you know be able to serve somebody else so uh but there there there's so much even you know uh the spirit of suicide has been busted here tonight amen um just uh the love of God where everybody was telling you know the sister he's too heavy you know and you don't want a guy like that he well the heaviness is what saved his life so God God specifically designed him with the weight that he had because God knew he was going to go through through a trial and then when he start going through that trial he he didn't want to tell nobody but I broke the branch and for us we say praise God you broke the branch cuz had you not broke the branch it' be a different story right but the the very thing that he was criticized over is the thing that saved his life there's a lot said here tonight there's a lot said here tonight and and and as brother um Lee was sharing when when Michael came back to church and he wasn't just still wasn't there he showed you how he was sitting down but when the sister walked up to him in church and said the Lord told me that you are supposed to sing the prodigal son this this week this Sunday and he said he looked at that with the life he was Liv say ain't no way the Lord told you that I went home said no I got and he tried to get get out of it by telling his daddy you know that you know Dad I I got unclean hands I'm not CU unclean hands don't supposed to be doing nothing right but uh but the Lord said it yeah and uh he still was trying to get out of it and when he um when he finally got up there and did it it caused him to break and and I I remember um uh my brother used to say that when he would when he wasn't serving the lord Lord and they would come into the house of the Lord it would he said the devil would fight him don't you lift your hand in this atmosphere don't don't lift your hand in this atmosphere and he would sit there just fighting and keep that hand down no I ain't going no I'm not going to enter in and the music just just moving all on the inside like no no I cannot enter in I got to be tough in an environment like this before you know it uh just a and sometime you get it down here like this you know just just a little bit and nobody can see it but God see it and before you know it's it's all the way up and and whatever that devil was that was trying to keep you from praising your God that devil just has to loose you and let you go he said there something about getting into that atmosphere and oh my god thank God I'm I'm so happy to hear this this beautiful testimony I was you know one one of the uh beautiful things from the weekend is that uh my son-in-law and my daughter were there on um on Saturday night and my son-in-law was absolutely blessed prise uh he was blessed and and since he won little drawing they they caught him on camera yeah with a little shout and so he gonna go all over the world it's recorded you know and and if God on Judgment Day have to play it back remember what you was doing that shout you know but but I just believe that was the beginning that's it of something that God is getting ready to do Amen in my in my family and I see what God has done in brother Lee family I'm claiming it for my family and if you you got somebody in your family you want to claim don't let tonight just go by claim it claim it amen it it's it it's yours speak into the atmosphere and lay claims on the promise that God gave you glory to God yeah I believe lives will change this weekend uh a a worship service and and just one and I just brother brother Israel I I can't say of when you see your name in the book what what it will do for you and I think there was some people that began to see their name in the bookall amen praise the Lord amen we thank the Lord let's have a word of prayer amen uh before we would just depart tonight father we thank you for just allowing your service V to pass this way God the the beautiful thought on Lord just not forgetting the benefits and it pays to serve you we realize that and God how um this testimony of his a son getting married to Precious sister that's just been holding on right um I just I pray I pray give strength and encouragement to the others that are holding on holding their testimony High just waiting for you Lord to send uh the right brother or the right brother could be present but for him to recognize uh what you have placed in his path Lord and just even listening to the testimony how uh at a meeting he the the he began to recognize there's some other brothers around here and he had to make some decisions God I believe there there are other young men we heard that even at the banquet it's time Lord many of them can make these decisions and and that they could Lord uh not be afraid to take that next step in life you will meet them you will you will you will show them that you are a provider amen that uh you you know how to meet needs uh that you are the same yesterday today and forever and maybe they they haven't experienced you in that manner but they can if they're willing to just let go so Lord I just pray that you would just continue to strengthen all our youth and Lord Lord uh that you would just bless them uh our sisters bless them for their their stance Lord and uh just just keep them God is our prayer and Trust oh God that you would uh give traveling mercies to the Saints as they prepare to return home on tomorrow uh go before them thank you for your favor uh when the when the luggage was overweight God you provided amen you you just you you're concerned about every detail of our life you are an awesome God a mighty God and God we could never never thank you enough so we pray for your Divine uh Mercy Lord as they travel uh many the other Saints oh God as they leave this place we ask that you would bless them and keep them until we're able to return back again on Sunday and may the spirit of God just meet us in a very very special way God it's our prayer it's in Jesus name we ask it amen amen praise the [Applause] Lord so I I know typically we would have um the floor open for uh testimonies and uh things of that nature and I know there's a lot of testimonies from uh the weekend but tonight I wanted to give brother Lee just the time to uh share you know his heart with us and and we'll be holding to this and I was specifically praying that he would get into that testimony because I knew it would do good tonight so uh so we just want to give that space to him and you all whole your testimonies amen we'll be back next Wednesday and we'll be looking forward to hearing amen all that the Lord has done amen God God is good God is good amen we'll have um The Brothers come at this time to dismiss us the Lord bless you and keep you amen until we meet again God bless you e for
