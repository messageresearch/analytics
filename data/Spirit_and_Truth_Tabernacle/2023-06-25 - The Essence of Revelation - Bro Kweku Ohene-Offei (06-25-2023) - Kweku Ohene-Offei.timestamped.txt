[46:11] where we are with a few things uh in our
[46:14] project but
[46:16] um
[46:16] um one of the things that I wanna
[46:19] have prayer over is
[46:22] um
[46:23] we had a sister that called this morning
[46:26] and she solicited praying for my church
[46:28] just some things that she's going
[46:31] through spiritually and just looking for
[46:33] God just to help her through this time
[46:36] and um uh so we we want to just take her
[46:40] before
[46:42] the Lord God knows her name amen and and
[46:46] uh but we want to take it before the
[46:47] Lord she asks our church to pray so
[46:49] we're gonna do that amen and we want to
[46:52] just remember uh her in prayer
[46:55] um the two other things that I want to
[46:58] make mention of brother Solomon didn't
[47:00] mention about brother brother Robles and
[47:02] I wanted the church to realize that this
[47:04] is a very serious uh situation that our
[47:09] brother uh is in I had a chance to visit
[47:13] him and visit with the family
[47:15] at the moment there is a machine that is
[47:19] keeping him breathing and so we need a
[47:24] miracle because at some point in time
[47:26] they'll have to take them off the
[47:27] machine and we know God is the one that
[47:30] is the he's the one that started breath
[47:32] he breathed and just the breath of life
[47:34] and it's going to take God not the
[47:37] machine God is the one that has to do it
[47:39] so we want you to please remember this
[47:42] family in prayer sister Robles the
[47:45] children are starting to come I believe
[47:48] we picked up Rosanna from the airport on
[47:52] Friday and then I believe Erica is going
[47:56] to come today with her family and his
[47:58] son Daniel will be here tomorrow so just
[48:00] be in prayer for the family during this
[48:03] time we need God
[48:06] we really need God a man to move on our
[48:09] brother's behalf another just praise
[48:12] report I got a telephone call on
[48:14] yesterday
[48:15] and a sister left me three messages and
[48:19] um and she was telling me
[48:22] that I guess it was last year sometime
[48:25] she knew about the um the US you know
[48:28] trying to get into a church and she
[48:30] wanted to bring a building fund offering
[48:33] and she came here to the school she
[48:36] never actually made it into the
[48:38] sanctuary but she was just outside and
[48:41] she came just to bring her building fund
[48:43] um
[48:44] offering and she said I just want to I
[48:47] want y'all to use this for you know for
[48:49] that for the for the building and as she
[48:51] was going back to the car she was so
[48:53] weak and just really going through so
[48:54] much of the body she didn't tell anybody
[48:56] but she said brother Troy recognized uh
[49:00] that something was going wrong and uh
[49:02] and he grabbed one of the other brothers
[49:04] and they went outside and they prayed
[49:06] for their sister at her car and uh when
[49:09] they prayed for her she said that um
[49:12] something was going on where she was
[49:14] losing feeling in her foot
[49:16] and you know the doctors were trying to
[49:19] get the doctors like how did you let it
[49:21] get this bad I mean you couldn't feel
[49:23] that like no I don't know what's going
[49:24] on and she knows she suffered from
[49:26] diabetes there but she just couldn't
[49:28] understand what was happening and the
[49:30] doctors were just saying we don't know
[49:31] how bad this is but uh you're gonna
[49:34] really need a miracle so you should come
[49:36] here and she dropped off her building
[49:38] fund and then the brothers prayed for
[49:41] her and when they prayed for her she
[49:43] went back to the doctor and everything
[49:45] that they saw begin to reverse
[49:49] Hallelujah
[49:58] you can't tell us
[50:01] that God is Not A Healer
[50:05] she say she heard brother Smiley
[50:07] preaching inside and and brother Troy
[50:09] was out there praying and I don't know
[50:11] who else went out with him but they just
[50:12] laid hands on and prayed for and got
[50:14] reversed that thing oh yeah yeah
[50:22] so I was I was just very happy you know
[50:25] just to hear uh that testimony you know
[50:28] from her and she said she had been
[50:29] meaning to let us know about this for a
[50:32] while but she just so happened to call
[50:34] at the right time just to encourage our
[50:37] faith amen just to encourage our faith

[1:00:32] in prayer amen amen amen

[1:00:39] shall we take our seat for now
[1:00:42] the Lord is good
[1:00:44] we thank you for his goodness and mercy
[1:00:46] I don't know where to start from where
[1:00:48] to go and how to end but the Lord knows
[1:00:51] amen
[1:00:53] someone to preach and I have a testimony
[1:00:56] from Mexico the trip almost three weeks
[1:00:59] trip but then we see how the Lord will
[1:01:01] help us to infuse some of the
[1:01:03] testimonies some of the reports in the
[1:01:06] sermon so we want to speak on the
[1:01:09] essence of Revelation if you can give me
[1:01:11] my slide
[1:01:13] and the essence of Revelation
[1:01:16] amen how important Revelation is to us
[1:01:19] and I try to look at the word essence
[1:01:22] essence is indispensable quality
[1:01:26] something that you cannot do without
[1:01:28] right and then the other meaning is
[1:01:30] absolute necessity because it's
[1:01:33] independable it's an absolute that you
[1:01:35] need just like the oxygen that we
[1:01:37] breathe for you to be able to live on
[1:01:40] this side you need to breathe oxygen in
[1:01:42] your lungs to carry on some of the
[1:01:44] metabolic processes in the body and the
[1:01:46] natural is a type of the spiritual that
[1:01:49] we need the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:01:51] which is the supernatural oxygen to be
[1:01:54] able to live in this life and why do we
[1:01:56] need those Revelations we want to find
[1:01:58] out let's go to the next slide
[1:02:00] we need to recognize that we have
[1:02:02] eternal life which was placing us before
[1:02:04] the foundation of the world without
[1:02:06] being revealed to you you even know
[1:02:09] eternal life you might not even think
[1:02:10] about it eternal life because you don't
[1:02:13] know it but then when the Lord revisits
[1:02:15] you that you are part of him you existed
[1:02:19] before the foundation of the world you
[1:02:21] have life eternal in you and you are the
[1:02:24] son of the Living God and you've got all
[1:02:26] the attributes and qualities of your
[1:02:28] father the Lord Jesus Christ in you amen
[1:02:31] and also it helps us to express
[1:02:34] Eternal attributes and the characters
[1:02:35] that the Lord placed in us before the
[1:02:37] foundation of the world and as we walk
[1:02:39] on this Earth definitely nobody is
[1:02:40] spared everybody has his challenges and
[1:02:43] trials even the children the first day
[1:02:45] they are born they begin to cry who cry
[1:02:48] when this is happy
[1:02:49] you cry when there's something wrong so
[1:02:52] even children have their challenges so
[1:02:54] now the revelation will help you to
[1:02:56] surmount those challenges and God
[1:02:58] placing you Ministries calling talents
[1:03:02] gifts for the body of Christ for you
[1:03:05] yourself and the god the people that God
[1:03:07] has called you for amen I don't think
[1:03:10] brother Jack just came from heaven and
[1:03:12] dropped here as a pastor his Precious
[1:03:14] mom is here he went through thick and
[1:03:17] thin mother knows what he went through
[1:03:19] with his son and even when the Lord
[1:03:21] called him he give his testimony how it
[1:03:24] wasn't he didn't want to go but the Lord
[1:03:25] even his professors were telling him
[1:03:27] that you a preacher wherever he go there
[1:03:30] a preacher he will preacher so he
[1:03:32] couldn't do nothing else because that
[1:03:34] was what God ordained for him to do
[1:03:36] and I think last week you heard about
[1:03:38] that Troy talking about his grandmother
[1:03:39] praying for him when he was a young boy
[1:03:41] watching the grandmother praying and
[1:03:43] bombarding prayers in his own eardrum so
[1:03:46] that prayer has become a manifestation
[1:03:48] so the Lord has to reveal those things
[1:03:50] to you to know your purpose on Earth
[1:03:52] amen people are going through life they
[1:03:55] don't know why they are here they think
[1:03:57] they are here because of money they
[1:03:59] think they are here because of Fame they
[1:04:01] think they are because of things of this
[1:04:03] world but things of this world begin and
[1:04:05] they will end but life eternal
[1:04:07] revelation of Jesus Christ is a tenor
[1:04:09] amen and also to overcome trials and
[1:04:13] facilitate the growth we need to grow
[1:04:15] from Grace to Grace from glory to glory
[1:04:17] from Mercy onto Mercy from Christ unto
[1:04:21] Christ amen from one understanding to
[1:04:23] another and it's all come by Revelation
[1:04:25] and then for your calling God puts you
[1:04:28] not just for yourself we are the word of
[1:04:30] selfie I me and mine that is what the
[1:04:35] world is about that is the cosmos world
[1:04:37] but the logos is about eternal life
[1:04:40] living for others
[1:04:42] so for you to live for others guide us
[1:04:44] to express that life from within you
[1:04:46] unto the others you are living for so
[1:04:48] that you can Excel your family your
[1:04:50] people around you your community your
[1:04:52] church whatever your job whatever the
[1:04:55] Lord places you that is what the Lord
[1:04:56] has called you for so that is what
[1:04:58] Revelation does for us amen
[1:05:01] Glory Hallelujah and we want to look at
[1:05:03] our scripture uh let's go to the
[1:05:06] scripture read the scripture and then I
[1:05:09] will
[1:05:09] we have some video get a video ready for
[1:05:13] me slide five after the scripture I will
[1:05:15] try to look at that video
[1:05:18] Mark chapter 12 verse 18 to 27 and we
[1:05:22] have the same scriptures in Matthew go
[1:05:23] to the next slide Matthew 22
[1:05:26] 23-33 it was what Jesus spoke about and
[1:05:30] then his disciples Mark and Matthew they
[1:05:33] scripted they were scribes they wrote
[1:05:35] what Jesus was saying so let's read from
[1:05:37] Mark
[1:05:39] um
[1:05:40] let me see what are you from yeah let's
[1:05:42] read from Mark chapter 12 18 to 27 Mark
[1:05:45] 12. let's go to the the previous slide
[1:05:47] Mark 12 18-27 shall we if you can be on
[1:05:51] our feet let's stand to hear the word of
[1:05:54] the Lord
[1:05:56] he said then came unto him that the
[1:05:57] Sadducees sad to see means sad you see
[1:06:01] farazim is far you see because always
[1:06:05] look to the past they don't see the
[1:06:07] person and the Pharisee looks so far
[1:06:09] whilst the Lord Jesus Christ was with
[1:06:12] them they didn't see him but we don't
[1:06:14] want to be like them we want to be the
[1:06:15] present-day God Amen so he said which
[1:06:19] then came unto him the Sadducees which
[1:06:22] says there is no Resurrection
[1:06:25] there is no Resurrection
[1:06:27] they didn't say there will be no but
[1:06:29] there's no they don't believe in the
[1:06:30] present they somehow believe in
[1:06:32] Resurrection but not in the present
[1:06:33] tense so and they ask him saying Master
[1:06:36] Moses wrote unto us if a man's brother
[1:06:39] died and if a man's okay if a man's
[1:06:42] brother died and leave his wife behind
[1:06:45] him and leave no children that his
[1:06:47] brother should take his wife and raise
[1:06:49] up seed unto his brother that's an Old
[1:06:51] Testament law now there were seven
[1:06:54] Brethren and the first took a wife dying
[1:06:56] left no seed and the second took her and
[1:06:59] died neither left he any seed and they
[1:07:02] fed likewise and the Seven had her and
[1:07:05] left no seed lasso for the woman died
[1:07:07] also in the resurrection therefore when
[1:07:09] they shall rise whose wife shall be of
[1:07:13] them
[1:07:13] for the seven had to wife and Jesus
[1:07:16] answering said unto them thee not
[1:07:19] therefore in other words you make
[1:07:21] mistake you make an error because you
[1:07:23] don't know the scriptures neither the
[1:07:25] power of God because they don't know
[1:07:28] that Revelation they don't know their
[1:07:29] scriptures they read but they don't have
[1:07:31] the revelation of faith and so the the
[1:07:34] air 25 for when they shall rise from the
[1:07:37] dead they neither marry nor are given in
[1:07:40] marriage but as Angels which are in
[1:07:42] heaven you are still funny amen as
[1:07:46] touching the dead that they rise have
[1:07:48] you never have he not read
[1:07:50] in the book of Moses how in the bush God
[1:07:53] spoke unto him saying I am the god of
[1:07:56] Abraham
[1:07:57] and God of Isaac and God of Jacob he is
[1:08:01] not the god of the dead but the god of
[1:08:03] the living He therefore do greatly Heir
[1:08:06] shall we take our seed
[1:08:16] glory to the Lord amen now the Pharisees
[1:08:19] and they said this is where they were
[1:08:21] not people who were ungodly people they
[1:08:23] were if our time we call them Christians
[1:08:25] they could be you can call them by any
[1:08:27] name any sector
[1:08:29] they were Christians but then they
[1:08:31] couldn't accept the word of God for
[1:08:33] their day
[1:08:34] they accepted the word of God previously
[1:08:36] because they told Jesus that we are
[1:08:38] Moses disciples this is what Moses wrote
[1:08:40] that if a man marries and doesn't have
[1:08:42] children with his wife when he dies then
[1:08:44] his brother should marry the woman and
[1:08:46] then raise children for the name of the
[1:08:48] of the brother some people had a wife
[1:08:50] have this woman neither of them had
[1:08:52] children so in the resurrection in other
[1:08:55] words when we reset they believe there's
[1:08:57] no they say there's no Resurrection but
[1:08:59] now here they say that in their
[1:09:00] Resurrection
[1:09:01] whose wife is gonna be so they believe
[1:09:04] in Resurrection but not in the present
[1:09:06] tense form
[1:09:07] they believe in future Resurrection they
[1:09:09] believe Moses but not in a present tense
[1:09:11] form amen and want to extrapolate this
[1:09:14] scripture to our day how do we believe
[1:09:17] Resurrection how do we believe the word
[1:09:19] of God for our day are we also like the
[1:09:21] Francis and the Sadducees that look
[1:09:24] behind see we are far but what the Lord
[1:09:27] is doing right now we don't see it amen
[1:09:30] Abraham said that the the Jews of that
[1:09:34] time in Jesus time they were not ungodly
[1:09:36] people they were high priests they were
[1:09:38] not drunkards they were not fornicators
[1:09:40] but they were people that lead holy life
[1:09:42] but they were able to see God of
[1:09:44] yesterday right Hebrews 13 8 says Jesus
[1:09:48] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:09:51] forever so they recognize God did
[1:09:52] something in Moses time and they held on
[1:09:55] to it and they know God is going to do
[1:09:57] something in the future but what God was
[1:09:59] doing at their time
[1:10:01] they were oblivious of it they were
[1:10:04] blinded to it they didn't want to see it
[1:10:06] they couldn't recognize Jesus was their
[1:10:09] son spoken word of God so for that they
[1:10:11] crucified the our own Messiah
[1:10:13] and when did Chris Van they said we
[1:10:15] don't crucify for healing our children
[1:10:16] for healing our wives and husbands but
[1:10:19] for you a man
[1:10:21] we don't even know how you were born
[1:10:24] and in their mind he was he was the son
[1:10:26] of Joseph he was born in in fornication
[1:10:30] claiming you are the king of Israel you
[1:10:33] are the Son of God in other words you
[1:10:35] are the almighty God from heaven we
[1:10:37] can't chew that
[1:10:39] we can't masticate that we can't swallow
[1:10:41] that and for that
[1:10:43] they ask who do we release to you
[1:10:46] the thieves Barabas or Jesus the king of
[1:10:50] the Jesus no he's not the king of the
[1:10:51] Jews don't even call him King of the
[1:10:52] Jews
[1:10:54] and they crucify him
[1:10:55] but the scripture said that he was a
[1:10:57] king
[1:10:58] but for the foundation of the world
[1:11:00] when he was born he was a king and wise
[1:11:03] men presented gifts gold man and incense
[1:11:06] because he was born a king even at a
[1:11:08] baby he was a king amen
[1:11:11] but the Jews couldn't see and as such
[1:11:15] they killed their own Messiah they've
[1:11:17] been praying for years their fathers
[1:11:18] have been praying they couldn't see and
[1:11:20] want to see how it relates in our time
[1:11:22] that how we see God is it God of
[1:11:25] yesterday is he got off in the time of
[1:11:27] only Paul God of William Abraham you see
[1:11:30] brother Solomon's God is he brother
[1:11:32] Joseph's God is he my God is he in you
[1:11:35] amen
[1:11:37] the only way you can claim it when it's
[1:11:38] in in your life
[1:11:40] if it's not in your life you can profess
[1:11:42] him but you don't possess him
[1:11:45] you can be in Christ by Christ you're
[1:11:47] not being you
[1:11:48] you can have the setting of a church of
[1:11:51] Christendom of Christianity you can firm
[1:11:54] it on your documents Christian religion
[1:11:57] but that doesn't make you Christ
[1:11:59] what makes you Christ is Christ in you
[1:12:01] the Holy Ghost baptism Glory Hallelujah
[1:12:05] to the Lord I want us to before I go
[1:12:07] into the preaching itself I want us to
[1:12:09] look at the testimony of a young lady
[1:12:11] that graduated from high school recently
[1:12:13] and had testimony her mom passed just
[1:12:16] around two years before she graduated if
[1:12:18] uh stabby can you get a video for me
[1:12:20] it's in YouTube if you can copy the link
[1:12:22] and
[1:12:23] copy the link and I want us to hear from
[1:12:25] from from her Amen to see how as young
[1:12:29] people this is the position for the
[1:12:30] young people and for adults I was
[1:12:32] inspired for somebody who could stand
[1:12:34] for the Lord
[1:12:35] just a teenager
[1:12:37] and let's see how do we stand for God do
[1:12:39] we compromise because of the pressure
[1:12:41] from the world
[1:12:42] or we can stand for God even in school
[1:12:44] even wherever we are amen
[1:12:47] Glory Hallelujah to the Lord
[1:12:52] if you can copy it then put it in a
[1:12:56] in Google or something like that it will
[1:12:58] come up but let's let's continue as they
[1:13:00] are trying to get us there
[1:13:02] the Lord he's good
[1:13:05] praise the Lord hallelujah
[1:13:07] okay we are there
[1:13:12] okay listen
[1:13:13] just about five six minutes but I
[1:13:15] believe to be a blessing
[1:13:17] for you and I
[1:13:22] there you go
[1:13:29] give it some volume
[1:13:34] can you start is it a starting
[1:13:37] okay great
[1:13:52] at Beaumont High School in the three
[1:13:54] minutes each oh and shares how her
[1:13:56] decades
[1:13:57] long says was redirected two years ago
[1:14:04] can tragedy struck my life it was not my
[1:14:07] prayers nor my accomplishments that
[1:14:09] helped me navigate that loss
[1:14:11] when everything else in my lifelong
[1:14:13] certainly the only
[1:14:16] is Jesus always says her mom was her
[1:14:19] biggest inspiration or she always pushed
[1:14:21] me with me invited so she only
[1:14:23] encouraged me last week
[1:14:25] um
[1:14:27] she would be available to me of how to
[1:14:29] be a Godly woman and how to love people
[1:14:31] intentionally but it wasn't always easy
[1:14:34] I got really into like a hard place
[1:14:36] where I was really doubting God and just
[1:14:39] like what he's praying for me was I
[1:14:40] didn't understand how
[1:14:53] and just said you know I don't really
[1:14:55] know where we go from here
[1:14:59] to do it together also just remembering
[1:15:01] that's what my mom wanted me to do is
[1:15:06] keep going encouraging those around her
[1:15:09] despite the hardships life brings you
[1:15:12] don't have to worry about whether or not
[1:15:13] your music
[1:15:15] his grace is sufficient for us and that
[1:15:17] his power is made perfect in our
[1:15:19] weaknesses
[1:15:23] I asked Lydia what it was like hearing
[1:15:25] the Roaring Applause from her peers okay
[1:15:28] like this this was the moment that God
[1:15:30] wanted like my what happened with my mom
[1:15:32] two years for
[1:15:34] um it was really difficult and it was
[1:15:36] really scary but I got a very
[1:15:38] overwhelming positive feedback I
[1:15:40] definitely did have some people tell me
[1:15:41] that like oh I needed to talk about
[1:15:43] Jesus but like that's gonna happen no
[1:15:44] matter what you say I was small like a
[1:15:46] baby I obviously there's a lot of joy
[1:15:50] and pride there but likewise knowing
[1:15:52] that her mom wasn't there to
[1:15:55] hurt but I also take recognition of the
[1:15:58] fact that I know that she was looking
[1:16:00] down and she was definitely smiling
[1:16:02] I don't want anyone to say well Lydia
[1:16:04] you did a great job like you were the
[1:16:06] one that said all those words that
[1:16:07] wasn't me speaking against I said the
[1:16:09] words around speaking through me
[1:16:12] Olivia says being a graduate doesn't
[1:16:14] quite feel real just yet but in the fall
[1:16:17] she's actually going to be attending
[1:16:18] Anderson University majoring in
[1:16:21] elementary education so we wish you the
[1:16:23] best amen glory
[1:16:27] look at this young lady a man just about
[1:16:30] 18 at most 18 years maybe 16 17. and she
[1:16:34] was she wasn't shy or proclaiming the
[1:16:37] Christ in her
[1:16:39] she didn't succumb to the pressures
[1:16:40] around
[1:16:42] she didn't succumbed to the school
[1:16:43] system
[1:16:45] who has lost her mother
[1:16:47] she had challenges she said she was
[1:16:49] almost about to how can God
[1:16:51] you know take my mom away and that
[1:16:53] become your testimony but when the Lord
[1:16:55] revealed it to her
[1:16:57] on her graduating ceremony she was able
[1:17:00] to stand before thousands of people
[1:17:03] and speak about her where her strength
[1:17:06] coming from her friend didn't come from
[1:17:08] a great didn't come from the family
[1:17:10] wealth from the riches but from Jesus
[1:17:13] and Jesus alone
[1:17:15] even when you listen for what's one of
[1:17:18] the we didn't finish but he said the
[1:17:20] things of this world is tempera
[1:17:23] regardless of whether you fail or you
[1:17:25] succeed it's still gonna it's not gonna
[1:17:27] last
[1:17:27] but what will last is your Jesus
[1:17:31] and and I was encouraged even me a
[1:17:34] preacher that if a little girl can stand
[1:17:36] for God like this
[1:17:38] why can't we stand for the Lord
[1:17:40] young and old
[1:17:42] why do we want to compromise let the
[1:17:44] word recognize it don't let the world
[1:17:46] Define you when you let the cosmos
[1:17:49] Define you it's going to destroy you
[1:17:51] because the Bible said that the devil
[1:17:52] come to what he comes to kill to steal
[1:17:55] and to destroy but Jesus Christ comes to
[1:17:58] give life and give it abundantly
[1:18:00] remember my sermon on the sweet 16 some
[1:18:03] months ago it wasn't too long I think it
[1:18:06] was April 25th 2023 there was a young
[1:18:10] lady celebrating her sweet 16 and had a
[1:18:13] party
[1:18:14] and then somehow some adults 18 year
[1:18:17] olds came around so the mom went to tell
[1:18:19] them that you know if you are more than
[1:18:21] I think 16 or somewhere just leave
[1:18:23] so she kicked them out but there was a
[1:18:26] gang related issue so those young men
[1:18:28] came back with gun
[1:18:30] and blew the people and I think one of
[1:18:31] the if I remember the story one young
[1:18:33] man he said he skipped and he remembered
[1:18:35] that her sister was there so she went
[1:18:38] wrapped herself around her sister drop
[1:18:40] her on the floor and she received a
[1:18:43] bullet for for the sister she died but
[1:18:45] the sister made it you see how the Holy
[1:18:48] Ghost can save you certain atmosphere
[1:18:50] you don't even have to be there
[1:18:52] going to Club
[1:18:53] where these these people can shoot at
[1:18:56] any time
[1:18:57] that is not your place
[1:18:59] it doesn't matter the the security
[1:19:01] somebody can just take a bullet AK-47
[1:19:04] and spray you
[1:19:06] look at the country where AK-47 can kill
[1:19:09] 200 people within a short time
[1:19:11] it's like a nation at war with itself
[1:19:14] why do we possess AK-47 are we at war
[1:19:17] with somebody
[1:19:18] and people mad people intoxicated people
[1:19:21] people with hatred with Richard hatred
[1:19:24] can tick and kill people but with the
[1:19:27] Holy Ghost
[1:19:28] with decision for the Lord you won't
[1:19:30] find yourself at those places
[1:19:33] Club is not your place
[1:19:35] the dancing Hall is not your place if
[1:19:37] you want to dance You Can Dance for the
[1:19:39] Lord amen
[1:19:42] when I was in Mexico oh my I hadn't done
[1:19:45] slide up in a long time
[1:19:47] their songs will just lift you up and I
[1:19:51] was I was on the floor I charged and I

[1:21:59] for you amen never compromise for the
[1:22:02] high school program don't compromise for

[1:22:08] girl you're a girl you're a boy you're a
[1:22:10] boy you are not confused about who you
[1:22:12] are amen
[1:22:14] your biological you can see brother
[1:22:15] Solomon and you can realize his name is
[1:22:18] a man you can see his wife sister uh
[1:22:20] knowing me and she's a woman even if
[1:22:22] they close your eyes let me show you
[1:22:24] something and a woman come close to
[1:22:27] certain circumference you can feel in
[1:22:29] your spirit thus there's a woman around
[1:22:31] you if you're a woman and you'll close
[1:22:33] it blind for you and they bring a man at
[1:22:36] certain point your spirit can detect
[1:22:38] that there's a man close to you
[1:22:40] so you don't have to have struggle to
[1:22:43] know you're a man or a woman but if you
[1:22:45] made that choice
[1:22:46] you're gonna live with it people made
[1:22:48] that choice and later they repent but
[1:22:51] they are destroyed their physical body
[1:22:52] they are destroy their biology and you
[1:22:55] can't bring their biology back
[1:22:57] it's a aggressive spirit that is moving
[1:22:59] all over the world
[1:23:01] is starting here it's moving all over
[1:23:02] Europe even they want to permit in
[1:23:04] Africa

[1:23:41] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:23:43] let's go to some of our quotes I've got
[1:23:46] a bunch of something things to say so
[1:23:49] what I'm going to do is I'm going to run
[1:23:50] through quickly
[1:23:51] and then from there we can hit on the
[1:23:54] Highlight so let's go to the the next
[1:23:56] coats
[1:23:58] right
[1:24:00] just give me a second to get water
[1:24:08] glory to the Lord
[1:24:09] I want to look at Auntie Jemima
[1:24:12] one more time and I we have preaching
[1:24:15] today has preached her some of the time
[1:24:18] how her faith stopped Jet Plane
[1:24:21] which was scheduled to fly from
[1:24:24] I think from a somewhere in um I don't
[1:24:28] remember this I don't remember it keep
[1:24:30] going go to Memphis Alabama right
[1:24:32] Memphis Alabama Tennessee thank you
[1:24:34] Memphis Tennessee to wherever he was
[1:24:37] going to she had grounded a plane
[1:24:40] but today we're not going to talk about
[1:24:41] her faith we're going to talking about
[1:24:44] how she knew who she was
[1:24:47] revelation of Who You Are
[1:24:50] it's good to know who Jesus is by you
[1:24:52] have to know who you are amen a lot of
[1:24:56] Christians in the world know who Jesus
[1:24:58] is they can tell Jesus the son of God is
[1:25:00] God in flesh but they do not know who
[1:25:02] they are and the most important thing is
[1:25:04] not just knowing who Jesus is but
[1:25:06] knowing that you are Jesus walking on
[1:25:08] two feet amen
[1:25:10] so let's go to I'm going to do a little
[1:25:13] bit of reading let's go to the next one
[1:25:15] because of for the sake of time I don't
[1:25:17] want to read go to the next one
[1:25:20] Bingo okay this is uh anti-jamima she
[1:25:24] declares her position
[1:25:25] now babram was at the airport
[1:25:28] he didn't really know the Lord was
[1:25:30] telling me to leave the airport plane is
[1:25:32] about to fly
[1:25:33] and to just walk
[1:25:36] he was walking on the street singing
[1:25:37] only believe not knowing exactly what
[1:25:39] the Lord had in mind for him but he kept
[1:25:43] walking and they kept walking and the
[1:25:45] Lord kept telling go this way go that
[1:25:46] way you think God doesn't speak God has
[1:25:49] a voice
[1:25:50] God speak amen he speaks and then he met
[1:25:54] Auntie Jemima he didn't God didn't re
[1:25:56] review that part about Abraham the only
[1:25:58] sad he revealed to him is you just take
[1:26:00] a walk okay let's keep going pass this
[1:26:03] route turn left turn right he didn't
[1:26:06] know what was in store and she made this
[1:26:09] uh Khalid lady called Auntie Jemima and
[1:26:12] she said let's see where to read from
[1:26:14] okay
[1:26:19] a typical Aunt Jemima is she had a man's
[1:26:24] what a man's tied around her head
[1:26:26] she was looking over the gate I come
[1:26:29] walking by going maybe probably it was
[1:26:32] the son's church that she taught her
[1:26:34] around her head
[1:26:35] because the son she would tell a story
[1:26:37] let's keep going he said she looking
[1:26:39] tears over her big fat cheeks she said
[1:26:43] good morning person I said how do you do
[1:26:46] Auntie it caught me that's what the
[1:26:49] prophet began to have a revelation this

[1:27:24] said it went so long on him we didn't
[1:27:27] suspect it parents thought he was a
[1:27:29] Christian boy
[1:27:30] maybe he goes to church on Sunday with
[1:27:32] Dad and Mom
[1:27:33] but then after high school when school

[1:27:39] to live with women thinking he was

[1:27:43] know he was deceiving himself

[1:29:25] that was brother I'm talking about the

[1:29:31] and she patted him he was laying there
[1:29:33] with blanket on his uh in his hand and
[1:29:36] it was
[1:29:37] um and he was saying mommy it's so dark
[1:29:40] when you get to the end of the road
[1:29:43] the choices you make
[1:29:45] it be like a video recording it will
[1:29:48] come right back to you it will not come
[1:29:50] to your dad it won't come to your pastor
[1:29:52] it will come to your mom it will come to
[1:29:54] you yourself
[1:29:55] if you truly Jesus Christ You're Gonna
[1:29:57] See the Light you're gonna sing Glory
[1:30:00] you're gonna meet Jesus Christ himself
[1:30:01] but he chose the things of the world
[1:30:05] the darkness will be upon you he said
[1:30:08] it's so dark what did I get to it's so
[1:30:11] dark and said do you know Mommy you you
[1:30:14] know you know your name he didn't seem
[1:30:16] like he recognized her he couldn't even
[1:30:18] recognize her mom mommy going on he was
[1:30:20] unconscious condition said can we pray
[1:30:22] person I said yes ma'am let's go to the
[1:30:24] next one
[1:30:27] okay
[1:30:28] is going to jump in the red he said
[1:30:30] Mommy it's getting light okay after they
[1:30:32] prayed said mommy is getting lied in a
[1:30:34] few moments he was up and on his feet
[1:30:37] I passed through there a few months he
[1:30:40] met me at the Abbey station said brother
[1:30:41] Abraham I'm perfectly normal and it's
[1:30:44] all gone from me
[1:30:45] the love of her mother
[1:30:47] a mother who knows her position
[1:30:50] and that is important why we need a
[1:30:52] revelation personally for ourselves
[1:30:54] your neighbor cannot have it for you
[1:30:57] he can pray for you can enjoy his
[1:30:59] anointing you can enjoy the anointing of
[1:31:01] the church you can enjoy the anointing
[1:31:03] of your family your parents but you need
[1:31:05] to have your own Holy Ghost for yourself
[1:31:07] amen the Lord has to reveal himself to
[1:31:10] you personally
[1:31:11] glory to God let's go to the next slide
[1:31:22] go to the next
[1:31:24] go to the next
[1:31:27] rice so now I want us to ask a question
[1:31:29] Auntie Jimmy my knew her position do we
[1:31:32] know our position in the Lord as not as
[1:31:34] a church as individual
[1:31:37] because you have to know Christ for
[1:31:38] yourself and I think the question we
[1:31:40] should ask ourselves is do I have Christ
[1:31:43] in me
[1:31:44] do I have the Holy Ghost In Me
[1:31:46] regardless of how the world will look
[1:31:48] fanciful to you one day you're gonna
[1:31:50] drop this flesh it came from the earth
[1:31:52] it will go back to the Earth
[1:31:54] the only thing you're going to take with
[1:31:55] you not your money not your riches not
[1:31:58] your house the only thing you can take
[1:32:00] with you is the Lord Jesus Christ in you
[1:32:03] the revelation of him in your life amen
[1:32:06] now I want us to look at this scripture
[1:32:08] Revelation 10 8-11 if you can read uh
[1:32:11] it's three full scriptures Revelation 10
[1:32:14] 1-6 is the Lord Jesus Christ himself the
[1:32:17] mighty Angel who descended put one foot
[1:32:20] on the ground one foot on land and one
[1:32:22] foot on the sea and then when you read
[1:32:24] Revelation is called the book of symbols
[1:32:27] it's not talking about a big huge might
[1:32:29] Mighty Angel come in and put one foot on
[1:32:32] West Palm Beach beach and one foot on
[1:32:34] some land no is the baptism of the Holy
[1:32:37] Spirit
[1:32:38] Landings to represent people
[1:32:40] when the Lord put his life in you human
[1:32:43] being is made up of about 85 percent
[1:32:45] water or even more liquid and the rest
[1:32:48] is just dust it's just one spoonful of
[1:32:50] dust take a big old fella if you die and
[1:32:54] in India where they increment people
[1:32:55] it's just one one spoonful
[1:32:58] the rest is just a fluid and the gases
[1:33:00] that we make that is all we amount to
[1:33:04] so but when the mighty Angel the Lord
[1:33:05] himself by the holy ghost power buy for
[1:33:09] the nation he quickened the seed in you
[1:33:11] that is claiming you footprint is
[1:33:13] possession
[1:33:14] so when you put one foot on the land
[1:33:16] your land and one foot on they see your
[1:33:18] body you have become the possession of
[1:33:20] the Lord Jesus Christ you become a
[1:33:22] temple of the Living God and if the Lord
[1:33:24] is with you who can be against you
[1:33:28] let all the demons come against you
[1:33:31] the Lord will stand for you amen
[1:33:34] and so we need to seek one thing
[1:33:36] Revelation so what I want to read
[1:33:37] Revelation 6 sorry 10 one to six is the
[1:33:41] lord lord Jesus himself and then seven
[1:33:43] is his prophet
[1:33:46] Elijah and the seventh angel messenger
[1:33:49] that was his ministry the Lord has
[1:33:51] fulfilled his path William has done his
[1:33:54] part but this scripture is for you and I
[1:33:57] to fulfill
[1:33:58] and he said and a voice which I heard
[1:34:00] from Heaven speak unto me saying and
[1:34:02] said go enter the little book which is
[1:34:04] open in the hand of the Angel which
[1:34:05] stand upon the sea and upon the Earth
[1:34:08] what is the little book for is the
[1:34:10] gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ is the
[1:34:12] message of the hour when you eat a
[1:34:14] message it will make you who you are it
[1:34:17] will give you in your ministry it will
[1:34:19] help you to surmount the challenges of
[1:34:21] life
[1:34:21] and I went and and on I went to the
[1:34:24] angel and said unto him give me the
[1:34:25] little book and he said unto me take it
[1:34:27] and eat it up it shall make that thy
[1:34:29] belly bitter but it shall be in their
[1:34:31] mouth sweet as honey when you receive
[1:34:34] the Gospel it doesn't mean everything is
[1:34:35] going to be cozy and roses flowers
[1:34:38] even gonna have more trials but that
[1:34:41] trial is growth that trial is blessing
[1:34:44] that that trial is character building
[1:34:46] right that trailer will make you become
[1:34:49] the spoken word of the Living God that
[1:34:52] when you speak your word is eternal when
[1:34:55] you speak Angels come to your disposal
[1:34:57] because you are speaking as what as
[1:34:59] Elohim
[1:35:01] and verse 10 and I took a little book
[1:35:03] out of the okay I think I've read up at
[1:35:04] verse 11 and he said unto me thou must
[1:35:07] prophesy again before many peoples
[1:35:09] Nations tongues and Kings amen now when
[1:35:13] you take the book it's going to change
[1:35:15] your mind it's going to change your
[1:35:17] heart it's going to change your thinking
[1:35:19] but then when after eating it going
[1:35:21] through all the trials and affliction
[1:35:23] and when the Lord is formed in you when
[1:35:26] it sees a reflection in you he send you
[1:35:28] out there
[1:35:29] my son Solomon my son
[1:35:33] my daughter hadasha go there and
[1:35:36] manifest me whatever he'll put you in
[1:35:39] your school in your in your neighborhood
[1:35:41] in your job in your ministry when you
[1:35:44] speak when you speak is not you the
[1:35:47] flesh speaking the sound is the flesh
[1:35:49] but they say being on the inside of you
[1:35:51] speaking and your word can bring healing
[1:35:54] your word can bring Resurrection your
[1:35:57] words can raise the dead your words can
[1:36:00] transform lives that is the power of the
[1:36:02] spoken word and this scripture is what
[1:36:05] is for us at this moment amen
[1:36:07] Revelation 10 7 Ram has finished his
[1:36:10] part yeah yeah like John the Baptist he
[1:36:12] said I must decrease that he might
[1:36:14] increase
[1:36:15] John came and John we didn't he had only
[1:36:18] a minister of six months he was
[1:36:19] preaching God was going to bring the
[1:36:21] Messiah he was going to come then it
[1:36:23] wasn't too long he changed his sermon he
[1:36:25] said behold the lamp of God
[1:36:28] that takes away the sin of men
[1:36:30] when it was revealed to him that Jesus
[1:36:31] Christ is the messiah
[1:36:34] and within Sixth Man John finished his
[1:36:35] ministry he said I should decrease I'm
[1:36:37] not even worthy to untie the list of his
[1:36:41] shoes and John faded he was put in
[1:36:44] prison the character said killed him and
[1:36:46] now Jesus Christ came under sin William
[1:36:49] Brown was a type of John the Baptist he
[1:36:51] came as well finished his ministry
[1:36:54] I mean brought all that the Lord
[1:36:55] ordained him to bring and then he left
[1:36:57] the sin now you can't claim William
[1:36:59] Abraham yes we can go back and refer to
[1:37:01] him he said type for you and I to
[1:37:04] fulfill our ministry what the Lord did
[1:37:06] in him the Lord can do the same thing in
[1:37:08] you amen
[1:37:10] it doesn't have to do all of them
[1:37:12] if your daughter is sick if you've got a
[1:37:14] wayward son
[1:37:16] the same holy ghost that was in William
[1:37:17] Abraham that was Auntie Jemima the same
[1:37:20] oligos is in you and you buy your token
[1:37:23] can place your token on your son or your
[1:37:25] daughter
[1:37:26] can place your talking on your loved
[1:37:28] ones and claim them back to Redemption
[1:37:31] because you've got their power you've
[1:37:33] got the authority the absolute Authority
[1:37:36] and you have an absolute necessity and
[1:37:38] so the supernatural authority of God has
[1:37:41] to display in your life amen
[1:37:45] babram said that the most important
[1:37:46] thing in the believer's life is what
[1:37:48] money is that right
[1:37:50] it's our houses and buildings
[1:37:52] is your family
[1:37:54] but it's a revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:37:57] because with that you can do all things
[1:38:00] because God created the world by his
[1:38:03] word by his faith do you know God has to
[1:38:07] believe his own word
[1:38:09] when he spoke if you put it in time it
[1:38:11] could be billions and trillions of years
[1:38:14] but he has to sit back lay back and
[1:38:15] believe that his word that has gone out
[1:38:18] of him will never come back void the
[1:38:21] word will accomplish what is meant for
[1:38:23] and so when you speak When you pray you
[1:38:26] believe your prayer that the prayer that
[1:38:28] you prayed will never come to your Void
[1:38:30] it will go around and around and around
[1:38:33] and work and work and work and it will
[1:38:36] bring your desire to pass amen
[1:38:38] do you know God has a Feeling
[1:38:41] oh God doesn't have feeling we imagine
[1:38:43] God has some abstract object somewhere
[1:38:45] but it's a being
[1:38:48] he has feeling like you the Bible said
[1:38:50] that we have a high priest who can be
[1:38:52] touched by the feeling of our
[1:38:54] infirmities
[1:38:56] so God has feeling you know God
[1:38:58] expresses love
[1:38:59] and he also want to receive love
[1:39:03] do you know you have confidence in God
[1:39:04] God wants to have confidence in you and
[1:39:07] he has confidence in you amen
[1:39:10] when you stand as a Son of God as a
[1:39:12] daughter of God God is proud of you
[1:39:15] when you can manifest his glory amen
[1:39:17] that's why he'll book Moses when Moses
[1:39:20] was crying become a crying baby and the
[1:39:22] Red Sea he said Moses why cry speak and
[1:39:25] go forward because he had made Moses god
[1:39:28] unto the people
[1:39:29] the Lord has made you God in your family
[1:39:32] he has made you God in your job
[1:39:35] he has made you God in your church
[1:39:38] he has made you God in the community
[1:39:40] that you shine reflect me amen and be
[1:39:45] like Auntie Jemima know who you are and
[1:39:48] stand on your grounds that this is me
[1:39:50] I'm a China might woman and I need my
[1:39:53] son to be raised up I need the
[1:39:55] resurrection of my daughter I need my
[1:39:57] wayward children to come back to me Lord
[1:39:59] I claim them by my token the devil has
[1:40:02] no control over my children I speak them
[1:40:04] into creation I spit a new birth into
[1:40:06] their lives it doesn't matter their
[1:40:08] circumstance I see only your promise and
[1:40:11] the manifestation of those promises in
[1:40:13] my life Glory Hallelujah to the Lord
[1:40:16] blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:40:19] Christ
[1:40:20] the Lord put gifts in you
[1:40:22] and as you go along you might not
[1:40:24] understand everything but the things the
[1:40:26] Lord is doing in your life a lot of
[1:40:27] children coming to church with your
[1:40:29] parents
[1:40:30] sometimes it could be bothersome to you
[1:40:32] other kids are going to play football
[1:40:34] they're going to play basketball on
[1:40:36] Sunday but you have to come with your
[1:40:37] parents don't let it be a bothersome
[1:40:39] something to you but let it be a
[1:40:41] blessing that the Lord is forming your
[1:40:44] life for your ministry for your calling
[1:40:47] on Earth
[1:40:48] amen just like a Esther Esther
[1:40:52] experience were taken to Heaven while
[1:40:54] she was young but the Lord wanted to
[1:40:56] form a character of prayer and fasting
[1:40:58] because she was going to be a queen she
[1:41:01] was going to be a savior she was going
[1:41:02] to be the Lord Jesus Christ to the
[1:41:04] people of Israel and deliver her people
[1:41:06] as a queen as a daughter of God and so
[1:41:09] the Lord formed that character in Esther
[1:41:11] Carter burden was it wasn't an easy one
[1:41:13] we are not made to enjoy trials no not
[1:41:17] even Jesus
[1:41:19] he was 100 human being and 100 said
[1:41:22] Elohim as a human being he cried I said
[1:41:25] he wanted to Swerve the cross he even
[1:41:28] prayed that if it's Thy word let his
[1:41:30] cross
[1:41:31] over me but that was the purpose on
[1:41:34] Earth
[1:41:35] if he didn't go you wouldn't be sitting
[1:41:36] here
[1:41:39] and the Holy Ghost in him sent Angels
[1:41:42] brought Moses and Elijah brought through
[1:41:45] furnace to strength him Lord go to
[1:41:48] Calvary if you don't go the whole
[1:41:49] generation the whole human race is
[1:41:51] condemned
[1:41:53] and the Lord rose up and went to Calvary
[1:41:55] for us and now he's done his part and
[1:41:58] he's put his confidence in you and I
[1:42:00] that is your turn you are not supposed
[1:42:02] to die but you're supposed to manifest
[1:42:04] him right here on Earth
[1:42:05] Glory Hallelujah to the Lord
[1:42:08] blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:42:10] Christ let's go to the next slide please
[1:42:22] now this is a marriage certificate I
[1:42:24] want to dwell here a little bit
[1:42:26] how can you have a marriage certificate
[1:42:27] when you are not married
[1:42:29] take a let's say you have a son or a
[1:42:31] daughter
[1:42:31] and your son comes back to Mom I found a
[1:42:34] girl a beautiful girl I want to marry
[1:42:35] okay that's great
[1:42:37] and then introduce this lady to you then
[1:42:39] he comes back a couple of weeks or
[1:42:40] months and said Mom the lady is asking
[1:42:42] me to wall my house my properties the
[1:42:46] land you give it to me the business to
[1:42:48] her you're gonna son he said he's a gold
[1:42:50] digger
[1:42:52] you are not even going to the courthouse
[1:42:54] you have not come to church and now this
[1:42:56] girl is asking you to wall your houses
[1:42:59] and properties no run away from her
[1:43:03] because as a bride you can't claim
[1:43:06] what the man has
[1:43:08] you have to be married to the man before
[1:43:10] you can make a claim
[1:43:11] the same way we can't remain bright and
[1:43:14] claim all the Eternal blessings of the
[1:43:16] Lord you have to marry to him as Jesus
[1:43:18] as as personally by the Holy Ghost
[1:43:20] baptism and as a generation the Lord
[1:43:23] married us to the Son of God Barbara
[1:43:25] married us to the Son of God let's do a
[1:43:28] little reading here invisible union he
[1:43:30] said well you separated from the your
[1:43:32] first Union by spiritual death when you
[1:43:35] get the Holy Ghost you don't die
[1:43:36] naturally but Supernatural you die
[1:43:38] now you are born again or remarried to
[1:43:41] the new spiritual union of not your
[1:43:43] natural life of the things of the world
[1:43:45] but of eternal life that gem that was in
[1:43:48] you at the beginning found you now your
[1:43:50] old book is gone your old book is the
[1:43:52] character the nature with your old union
[1:43:54] now your name is in your in your old the
[1:43:56] name in the in your old has been
[1:43:58] transferred do you mean to tell me my
[1:44:00] old book God put in the sea of his
[1:44:03] forgetfulness all your sins all the
[1:44:06] atrocities that you committed the Lord
[1:44:07] deleted them they don't exist no more
[1:44:09] you stand perfectly before God now your
[1:44:12] name is now in the new book not the Book
[1:44:15] of Life not the natural life but the
[1:44:17] Lamb's Book of Life which is eternal
[1:44:19] which is with the lamb redeem not the
[1:44:21] old book of your natural Union by by
[1:44:23] your new but your new bride Hallelujah
[1:44:27] your name is now your name sorry your
[1:44:31] new life is in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:44:33] your marriage certificate Hallelujah
[1:44:36] where your true Eternal gem from the
[1:44:38] beginning takes hold amen and look at
[1:44:41] when the prophet prayed this message
[1:44:42] November 25th 1965 just before a month a
[1:44:47] couple of months he passed away onto the
[1:44:49] other side the prophet gave a marriage
[1:44:51] certificate
[1:44:52] for us because as as a generation we
[1:44:55] were married to Jesus Christ
[1:44:57] I'm not talking about the term time will
[1:44:59] not save you I'm not talking about
[1:45:01] jargons whether you call yourself bride
[1:45:03] wife Queen Jesus Christ if it's only
[1:45:06] temps and jargons and movement my
[1:45:08] brother my sister there's no power in it
[1:45:09] but I'm talking about your position in
[1:45:11] the Lord what the Lord has done for you
[1:45:14] we are not going to physically be
[1:45:15] married to Jesus Christ in the physical
[1:45:17] sense like the way we marry our wives no
[1:45:19] but we're talking about marriage in the
[1:45:21] Supernatural sense that we are in the
[1:45:23] age where like just like John the
[1:45:25] Baptist he came to look for a bride for
[1:45:27] Christ in his generation the Lord has
[1:45:29] seven churches Paul came to look for a
[1:45:31] bride Arenas Luther math and Columba
[1:45:35] Wesley Martin Luther and after all of
[1:45:37] them married the bride to Christ at that
[1:45:40] time by receiving the word of the day
[1:45:42] the Holy Ghost marries you to Christ
[1:45:44] amen don't look at God is going to come
[1:45:47] in millions of Christians you know women
[1:45:49] are jealous men are jealous too
[1:45:52] So Adam is going to say hey I opened it
[1:45:55] I opened a Redemption story I'm the one
[1:45:56] should claim the Lord
[1:45:58] and then Sarah will say no it's me
[1:46:01] and who is going to marry to Jesus
[1:46:02] Christ if it's a natural sense it's not
[1:46:05] a natural marriage the natural is a type
[1:46:07] of the spiritual so the Lord uses
[1:46:09] natural things to tie the spiritual but
[1:46:10] the marriage itself is the word the
[1:46:13] supernatural they feel funny the Lord
[1:46:15] himself taking your flesh and uniting
[1:46:18] your flesh with the spirit that's the
[1:46:21] invisible Union of the bride of Christ
[1:46:22] which is the wife of Christ at this hour
[1:46:25] that will become a wife and because
[1:46:27] you're a wife you can claim everything
[1:46:29] that the husband has
[1:46:31] Glory Hallelujah you're not just a bride
[1:46:33] that someday is going to marry you
[1:46:34] that's why Jesus told the people that
[1:46:36] you don't know the scriptures on the
[1:46:38] other side we don't marry you with your
[1:46:41] family where my brother made his wife he
[1:46:42] said he's going to call me sweet he
[1:46:43] didn't call him sweet I said my brother
[1:46:46] so on the other side in the Ethiopian
[1:46:49] the natural side is meant to to
[1:46:50] procreate children here the theophany
[1:46:53] speaks into existence the sufani doesn't
[1:46:56] have to marry a physical wife so the
[1:46:58] marriage is going on right now amen not
[1:47:02] at the other side amen the marriage of
[1:47:04] Christ is going on right now it's been
[1:47:07] going on since creation
[1:47:10] anybody that has the Holy Ghost baptism
[1:47:11] is married to Jesus Christ
[1:47:14] you are missing Jesus Christ you are the
[1:47:16] Queen of Heaven that is living in this
[1:47:18] earth
[1:47:18] Glory Hallelujah let's go to the next
[1:47:20] slide
[1:47:29] now this is another concept of the Bible
[1:47:31] that we only look at the future and look
[1:47:33] at the past
[1:47:34] almost every message believer will tell
[1:47:35] you that yes they've been what is this
[1:47:37] six raptures which you can talk about
[1:47:38] Enoch talk about Elijah talk about Jesus
[1:47:41] talk about a couple more others
[1:47:44] but what is going on even in the church
[1:47:45] ages let's look at what the Rapture you
[1:47:47] know the concert of the Bible if you
[1:47:50] look at it linearly you get stuck
[1:47:52] God moves in cycles and in circles God
[1:47:56] doesn't move in linear because we are
[1:47:57] human beings he let us understand things
[1:47:59] linearly but when God is moving he moves
[1:48:02] in a circle and I'll explain a little
[1:48:03] bit is that to be to be sure Christ The
[1:48:06] Mystery of God revealed the whole
[1:48:07] Rapture now Luther was a part
[1:48:10] Wesley was a part the prophet was a part
[1:48:13] How can there be a part
[1:48:15] I think we are waiting for Rapture are
[1:48:17] we not waiting for rapture
[1:48:18] but here's the professor that there was
[1:48:21] a part
[1:48:22] not even that now but they said they was
[1:48:24] so the churches were rapture but we
[1:48:27] didn't see nobody flying anybody jumping
[1:48:30] and flying in the skies
[1:48:31] what are you talking about let's go on
[1:48:33] he said well he said it's uh if they are
[1:48:37] if they aren't a part just in the
[1:48:38] Revelation that they was making up their
[1:48:40] body feet toes arms and so forth until
[1:48:43] the head which we get into that a few
[1:48:45] minutes that makes the entire rapture
[1:48:48] so the Rapture is parts
[1:48:50] it's a circle
[1:48:53] it's a body of the word which is Christ
[1:48:55] so the Rapture is Christ
[1:48:58] it's nothing it's strange
[1:49:00] the things that will imagine our human
[1:49:02] mind that's not the way the word the
[1:49:04] Lord does it it's so simple that's one
[1:49:07] time it will pass on top of our head
[1:49:10] and that that's what Israel did Israel
[1:49:12] read Isaiah 55 and all the books they
[1:49:15] were read it and they would take the
[1:49:17] scroll and read it every day in India
[1:49:19] synagogues but when the Lord Jesus
[1:49:21] Christ came a virgin birth they said no
[1:49:23] that's not him he didn't come in the
[1:49:25] house of kaiaphas you should have come
[1:49:27] in the land of Iran it didn't come in
[1:49:29] the land of Moses he came in Judah
[1:49:32] but did you know he said he's a trap
[1:49:33] line of the Trap of Judah and so now we
[1:49:36] think so high we think the things of the
[1:49:38] Lord Rapture you are if you have got the
[1:49:40] Holy Ghost you've been raptured
[1:49:45] it might sound like a big nugget if I've
[1:49:47] got Christ in you you've been raptured
[1:49:50] and you're still being raptured each
[1:49:52] time you the Lord strike a revelation in
[1:49:54] your heart it elevates you bring you up
[1:49:57] higher and higher and higher so is that
[1:50:00] it's a path that means the body the body
[1:50:02] of the word outside of that you are lost
[1:50:03] so the Rapture people even in the
[1:50:06] churches were raptured already
[1:50:09] how can it be those are the things that
[1:50:12] we when we the Lord reveal it to us it
[1:50:14] empowers you
[1:50:16] the essence of the power of Revelation
[1:50:18] when you know who you are
[1:50:20] you don't get scared am I going to be
[1:50:22] the Rapture am I not going to make it is
[1:50:23] my son going to make is my father going
[1:50:25] to make it gonna make it because we're a
[1:50:27] human being but when the Lord reveals to
[1:50:30] you that you have been raptured
[1:50:32] the Rapture is in you
[1:50:34] and the end result will come out amen
[1:50:38] there's more there's the resurrection is
[1:50:40] in you even resurrected and you still
[1:50:42] resurrect because the Bible says Jesus
[1:50:44] Christ Hebrews 13 8 same yesterday today
[1:50:47] and forevermore he's done it already
[1:50:49] he's doing it and he was still doing it
[1:50:51] because he break one cycle in your life
[1:50:53] and manifest something in your life
[1:50:55] break another cycle and manifest in your
[1:50:57] life even in our own personal lives we
[1:50:59] see certain Cycles manifesting Our Lives
[1:51:02] amen Glory Hallelujah let's go to the
[1:51:05] next one
[1:51:10] the Feast of the trumpet
[1:51:12] the Holy Ghost was bound two thousand
[1:51:14] years how can Holy Ghost be bound
[1:51:17] can you even entertain the idea of
[1:51:18] somebody binding almighty God
[1:51:22] but then if Christ is in Sister Jemima
[1:51:24] and we offices you are burning the Holy
[1:51:27] Ghost
[1:51:28] if you refuse Christ in brother Jack you
[1:51:31] are binding the Holy Ghost because
[1:51:32] Christ cannot impact your life
[1:51:35] if you refuse Christ in Sister verse you
[1:51:38] are binding the Holy Ghost
[1:51:41] so that is the way we bound the Holy
[1:51:43] Ghost not like somebody has a chain the
[1:51:45] devil chain God Almighty then the sea
[1:51:48] will come and flood the whole world and
[1:51:50] kill other human beings because there
[1:51:52] must be somebody on the throne to order
[1:51:54] the universe
[1:51:56] but if God is in his people
[1:51:58] and you have what you call it you you
[1:52:00] you you discard them
[1:52:02] you refuse them you have bound the Holy
[1:52:05] Ghost
[1:52:07] if you receive brother Smiley brother
[1:52:09] Troy
[1:52:11] sister Brown sisterica
[1:52:13] sister Virginia
[1:52:16] you have refused the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:52:21] so in the church ages when God sent Paul
[1:52:24] they kill them they become martyrs
[1:52:27] and they bound God gave them the spirit
[1:52:29] of a lion to stand
[1:52:31] they gave their lives women they rip
[1:52:34] their stomach take their belly children
[1:52:36] from their belly and they will soon ever
[1:52:38] deny Christ
[1:52:39] they will tell you that if you want us
[1:52:40] to spare your wife denounce Christ both
[1:52:44] there and their wife and their children
[1:52:45] they'll go through death
[1:52:47] the Lord give them a spirit of a lion to
[1:52:49] stand and they were murdered thousands
[1:52:52] and millions of them
[1:52:55] that's how they bound the Holy Ghost but
[1:52:57] the Lord was reflecting through a star
[1:53:00] in the night time that's when we see
[1:53:02] stars so all the seven churches were
[1:53:04] night time when the church was in
[1:53:06] darkness but God sent Messengers to
[1:53:08] reflect their light unto them amen but
[1:53:11] after seven churches Brown preached at
[1:53:13] someone it is the rising of the sun we
[1:53:16] are no longer in the night time but the
[1:53:18] Lord has come the Lord himself came 1963
[1:53:20] Abraham talked about the picture of
[1:53:22] Jesus with his white wig how can you see
[1:53:26] since uh somebody's awake without not
[1:53:28] seeing her
[1:53:29] how can I see but but Solomon Wayne he
[1:53:32] sued
[1:53:33] and then Solomon is not in the suit
[1:53:36] that was Jesus even describe his beard
[1:53:38] Black Beard describe his face you have
[1:53:41] pictures features but he didn't show his
[1:53:43] body
[1:53:44] why didn't he show his body
[1:53:46] the body was already on Earth
[1:53:48] that was a marriage that was the wedding
[1:53:51] that's invisible to the world but it's
[1:53:54] made visible to you
[1:53:58] to marry us as a generation
[1:54:00] to the Lord Jesus Christ so now the Lord
[1:54:03] is dealing with dealing with you
[1:54:04] directly
[1:54:05] amen that's why he's done with the uh
[1:54:07] what they call it the serving messenger
[1:54:09] he's finished with them but it's giving
[1:54:10] you the fifo ministry
[1:54:13] the five is the outermost part this uh
[1:54:15] fingers
[1:54:16] that's where the Lord is touching you
[1:54:19] the faithful Ministry perfecting you the
[1:54:21] pastor the prophet the Evangelist the
[1:54:25] teachers and the apostles that is the
[1:54:28] Lord himself
[1:54:29] perfecting you through his faithful
[1:54:31] Ministry Glory let's go to the next one
[1:54:34] let me just run through quickly
[1:54:37] the seven trumpet
[1:54:39] now Abram wanted to preach the seven
[1:54:41] trumpets and he thought it was going to
[1:54:43] break just like the seven seasons were
[1:54:44] broken and the Seven chair changes but
[1:54:47] each time you try to preach there was
[1:54:48] something hindering him David had a
[1:54:51] air-conditioned room with Billy Paul and
[1:54:53] everything ready but there was something
[1:54:54] pressing him
[1:54:55] and let's see let's go to read okay yeah
[1:54:59] let's read read a little bit let's read
[1:55:01] a lot and said when I went into prayer I
[1:55:03] told the wife I'm going in and sincerely
[1:55:06] I knelt down before God to pray and he
[1:55:08] revealed to me that them seven trumpets
[1:55:10] sounded under the Sixth Seal I have done
[1:55:13] preached super naturally
[1:55:16] how can reject preach at someone he
[1:55:18] doesn't know he prayed a sermon
[1:55:20] but a Troy you a preacher how can you
[1:55:22] preach and you don't know that I
[1:55:23] preached someone how can kwaku preacher
[1:55:25] someone how can brother Solomon lead a
[1:55:27] song and
[1:55:29] how can it be
[1:55:31] when you sang this song you sang an
[1:55:33] amazing belief you sang Only beliefs
[1:55:36] Lord are this sing only believer I sang
[1:55:37] Amazing Grace he said the only belief
[1:55:40] sounded under your Amazing Grace when
[1:55:42] you sign
[1:55:44] that is the supernatural manifestation
[1:55:46] of the word
[1:55:48] and so the prophet didn't have to preach
[1:55:50] the seven trumpet they preach the Feast
[1:55:51] of the trumpet it's now a feast it's a
[1:55:54] party and join the blessings of the
[1:55:56] trumpet
[1:55:57] because he's been preached
[1:55:59] supernaturally pertain to Israel so now
[1:56:01] let's rejoice
[1:56:04] the wife of the lamp is what the major
[1:56:06] the lamp is ready and his wife is ready
[1:56:09] so let's have a feast and enjoy the
[1:56:12] marriage of the lamp the atonement has
[1:56:14] already been attuned for us your sins
[1:56:16] have been atoned The Mercy Seat is
[1:56:18] already cleared for you the Lord has
[1:56:20] already taken your sin individual people
[1:56:22] come at their time but as as the work of
[1:56:24] God God has already finished the work
[1:56:26] amen Glory Hallelujah let's go to the
[1:56:29] next one
[1:56:30] I think I read it right let's go
[1:56:33] and yes if you want to and remember in
[1:56:35] the 60 the same thing let's go to the
[1:56:36] next one yes I want to be our Bible
[1:56:38] student so I want to just highlight this
[1:56:40] so that we can go back and and study now
[1:56:43] God never sent two major prophet on
[1:56:46] Earth at the same time
[1:56:48] we talk about Revelation 11 Moses and
[1:56:50] Elijah did Moses and Elijah the two the
[1:56:52] two Olive plants now most and larger is
[1:56:55] going to come now the prophet said in
[1:56:57] numerous standards God never never his
[1:56:59] contrary to his his ambition program to
[1:57:02] send to major prophet now Moses a major
[1:57:04] prophet and Elijah is a major prophet so
[1:57:07] how are they going to bring them at the
[1:57:09] same time
[1:57:10] we're going to find out how they come
[1:57:11] because God didn't make people the same
[1:57:13] the same Holy Ghost is in brother
[1:57:15] Solomon the same only goes his brother
[1:57:17] brother Marquis but when you go to their
[1:57:19] home they run their home differently
[1:57:21] they may eat different dinners they made
[1:57:24] different their wives can cook different
[1:57:25] food so no two human meats are exactly
[1:57:28] the same
[1:57:29] God made this one differently put this
[1:57:31] material in him give him this
[1:57:33] understanding and God uses him this way
[1:57:35] he made the other minister this one put
[1:57:38] his understanding him and uses him
[1:57:39] differently he made this sister put his
[1:57:42] gift in her or this understanding in her
[1:57:45] and he uses this sister differently he
[1:57:47] put this gift in this person so there's
[1:57:49] no two people they will have the same
[1:57:52] Holy Ghost the same almighty God in them
[1:57:55] they have the same fundamental Doctrine
[1:57:57] but the understanding the way of doing
[1:57:59] things are different because the
[1:58:00] almighty is trying to achieve something
[1:58:02] with brother Solomon and he's trying to
[1:58:04] achieve something else with brother
[1:58:05] Marquis
[1:58:06] so you can't compare brother solomona
[1:58:08] quiz neither can you compare but a
[1:58:10] Solomon because God made them
[1:58:12] differently to achieve his purpose you
[1:58:15] can't compare to brother brother smiley
[1:58:19] how am I going how is somebody going to
[1:58:21] wear my shirt
[1:58:22] he's going to rip off his skin
[1:58:24] and the forgive him but a Smiley's suit
[1:58:26] they're going to say could you borrow
[1:58:28] from somebody everybody's gonna know I
[1:58:30] borrowed it God says you to just
[1:58:31] probably go to it will be halfway here
[1:58:33] I'm going to look like look like a
[1:58:35] southern preacher with their long suit
[1:58:37] here
[1:58:38] but the Lord brother brother brother
[1:58:39] brother Smiley the way he is for a
[1:58:42] Divine Purpose and if I try to be better
[1:58:45] Smiley I'll Crush I can't I can't reach
[1:58:47] his height
[1:58:49] he made me the way he is and I have can
[1:58:51] be who I am God has made me
[1:58:53] and brother Smiley can be who is the
[1:58:55] Lord has made him
[1:58:57] and the business find out what Lord what
[1:58:59] have you made me to be
[1:59:01] and when you show you won't imitate
[1:59:03] somebody
[1:59:04] copycat your brother you won't try to be
[1:59:07] somewhere where you don't belong to
[1:59:10] it's so sweet when you are in the
[1:59:11] perfect will of the Lord
[1:59:12] when the Lord placed you here it might
[1:59:14] be the littlest the minutest but it's
[1:59:17] the best in the side of the Lord
[1:59:19] and you can do their best when you find
[1:59:21] yourself that way amen
[1:59:23] let's go okay I didn't read it so now
[1:59:26] God always is a prophet a man if you use
[1:59:28] a bunch of men you get different ideas
[1:59:29] see each man never did he have two major
[1:59:31] prophet on Earth at one time he takes
[1:59:34] one so that the other one can take his
[1:59:35] place for another another message he
[1:59:38] never has to he has one at a time let's
[1:59:40] go to the next one
[1:59:43] praise be to the Lord
[1:59:45] and never this another message and uh I
[1:59:48] never too major prophet on Earth at the
[1:59:50] same time let's go to the next one okay
[1:59:52] let me let me finish then every man is
[1:59:54] different he's got a different makeup if
[1:59:55] God could get one person that's all he
[1:59:58] has to have right in his hand he can do
[2:00:00] what he wants he just have to have one
[2:00:03] in the days of Noah this of Elijah this
[2:00:05] of Moses so God just need only you and
[2:00:08] he can do a whole lot
[2:00:10] let's go to let's go to to the next
[2:00:15] amen now let's see how the prophet
[2:00:17] taught us the 64. how much and Elijah
[2:00:20] Ministry is going to be because that he
[2:00:23] never God bring two major prophet but
[2:00:25] the same God said is going to send
[2:00:26] Muslim Elijah let's see future homes I
[2:00:29] remember God took Elijah after the
[2:00:30] Rapture and translated or transplanted
[2:00:33] him back among his people to take the
[2:00:35] place as a prophet among his people
[2:00:37] pretty soon he'll do that so he's going
[2:00:39] to transplant them just like he did
[2:00:42] and he has kept him alive these 2500
[2:00:45] years he's to appear again notice his
[2:00:48] race Moses from the dead where is his
[2:00:50] grave can anybody find it read a book of
[2:00:52] Jude the Archangel disputing with the
[2:00:54] Archangel Satan the Lord rebuke you
[2:00:56] disputing over the body of Moses and
[2:00:58] here Peter James and John were standing
[2:01:01] there looking at him on Mount
[2:01:02] Transfiguration
[2:01:03] Prophet don't die Christians don't die
[2:01:08] dropping your body on this flesh you're
[2:01:11] still alive let's go a little bit
[2:01:13] further
[2:01:14] so right in the land where the mountain
[2:01:16] is to be raised we have we have
[2:01:18] supernatural beings standing here but
[2:01:21] this ice is not ordained to see them
[2:01:23] it takes the supernatural eyes of Faith
[2:01:26] to see them let's let's go to the next
[2:01:28] one
[2:01:33] right so another church age he said
[2:01:36] there'll be some standing here which
[2:01:38] shall not his death to they see the son
[2:01:40] of man coming in his kingdom and the
[2:01:42] three Apostles just see that the order
[2:01:44] of his second coming they saw him
[2:01:46] transfigured there on my on the mountain
[2:01:48] top his Remnant was Blazing white and
[2:01:50] his face Shone like the Sun at its
[2:01:52] Zenith and they and there as he appeared
[2:01:55] stood Moses and Elijah on either side
[2:01:57] are we waiting for Muslim Elijah to to
[2:01:59] raise from their dead they are not dead
[2:02:03] we're gonna see Moses spirit of Moses
[2:02:05] and Elijah ministered in brother I think
[2:02:07] brother Jack must change in Shreveport
[2:02:09] Louisiana
[2:02:11] amen and we are in raja's church right
[2:02:14] now here
[2:02:17] let's let's go to the next slide
[2:02:20] let's go to the next slide
[2:02:23] most and Elijah let me see where am I
[2:02:26] oh I think I've done finished with this
[2:02:28] one haven't I oh no okay
[2:02:31] okay great great is where I want to be
[2:02:32] so now they have to taste it that's
[2:02:35] right after their Ministry is finished
[2:02:36] why the seventh Angels Ministry the
[2:02:39] seventh Angels Ministry Elijah's
[2:02:41] Ministry to the seventh angel
[2:02:42] not why don't why could you not rather
[2:02:46] I'm trying to say the seventh Angels
[2:02:48] Ministry then be by Moses if it's
[2:02:51] Immortal the same as it could be by
[2:02:53] Elijah why don't they why didn't God
[2:02:56] just send Elijah you've done your work
[2:02:58] hard now Brian was time to say that the
[2:03:00] seventh he was the seventh angel
[2:03:01] Ministry let's go back to even Malachi
[2:03:03] four five and six if you go to Malachi
[2:03:05] four
[2:03:07] three he said let's read a little bit if
[2:03:09] you can give me the scripture
[2:03:11] quickly
[2:03:13] just to show that Baba exhibited those
[2:03:15] two Ministries he was Moses and Was
[2:03:17] Elijah I said behold I'll send you the
[2:03:20] the scripture before behold I'll send
[2:03:22] you Elijah the prophet
[2:03:25] can brother Solomon you're going to help
[2:03:27] me let me see
[2:03:29] Moses
[2:03:34] right here okay
[2:03:36] you want four or three yeah three okay
[2:03:41] and you shall tread down the wicked for
[2:03:43] they shall be ashes under the soles of
[2:03:45] your feet in the day that I shall do
[2:03:47] this saith the Lord of hosts remember ye
[2:03:50] the law of Moses my servant which I
[2:03:51] commanded unto him
[2:03:55] remember ye the law of Moses my servant
[2:03:58] which I commanded unto him and hub for
[2:04:00] all Israel
[2:04:01] with the statues and judgments
[2:04:07] go to the next one behold I will send
[2:04:10] you Elijah the prophet before the coming
[2:04:12] of the great and Dreadful day of the
[2:04:14] Lord and he shall turn the heart of the
[2:04:16] fathers to the children and the Heart of
[2:04:18] the children to their fathers lest I
[2:04:20] come and smite the Earth with a curse
[2:04:25] now it's a behold remember the love
[2:04:28] Moses and Brahma was a law Giver unto
[2:04:31] you and I
[2:04:32] he was also a prophet to the Pentecost
[2:04:34] house
[2:04:36] so he had the ministry into two and
[2:04:37] let's go to the next slide stabby
[2:04:40] that one person let's see a prophecy
[2:04:43] that went forth that within three months
[2:04:45] there'll be a the spirit of Moses and
[2:04:48] Elijah ministering and the spirit of
[2:04:50] Jesus we are ministering in Jack Moore's
[2:04:52] Church
[2:04:54] spoke the word of the Lord Nancy this is
[2:04:57] very profound
[2:04:58] and then when I got to Shreveport
[2:04:59] Louisiana a woman who is a gifted woman
[2:05:02] her name is Mrs Schrader many years ago
[2:05:05] when the angel of the Lord met me down
[2:05:07] here at the river the first time and
[2:05:09] appeared in the light the words that he
[2:05:11] spoke there 11 years later
[2:05:15] God uses our women too
[2:05:18] 11 years later
[2:05:20] 11 is a number of perfect discipleship
[2:05:22] when I walk into a meeting this little
[2:05:25] woman Rose and spoke in tongues and
[2:05:26] interpreted it was word
[2:05:29] for word the same thing that the angel
[2:05:33] said
[2:05:35] the woman wasn't there when the angel of
[2:05:36] the Lord spoke to Abraham
[2:05:38] but the same angel that spoke to about
[2:05:40] Abraham
[2:05:41] was in the woman
[2:05:42] and spoke to the woman Abraham to
[2:05:46] confirm something from Abraham and this
[2:05:48] same little woman I work in Tabernacle
[2:05:49] or the place at Shreveport that will end
[2:05:52] the live Tabernacle the Holy Spirit move
[2:05:54] on that woman and said word for word
[2:05:56] what he said to me up there on the hill
[2:05:58] the spirit began to move and give
[2:06:00] interpretation for telling Revelation by
[2:06:03] prophecy and things like that
[2:06:05] so now this is things that problem the
[2:06:08] Lord told him when he called him at the
[2:06:10] cave
[2:06:11] praying and a woman has put the same
[2:06:13] thing brother from Louisiana from
[2:06:16] Brother Life Tabernacle Shreveport
[2:06:18] Louisiana
[2:06:19] the same Holy Ghost
[2:06:21] doesn't have limitation
[2:06:24] let's go to the next slide
[2:06:26] just wanted to
[2:06:27] wrap up the revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:06:29] okay he said now before a little man
[2:06:32] stood up a Baptist woman come over not
[2:06:34] knowing what she could do she was
[2:06:36] standing in the midst of the meeting and
[2:06:37] the Holy Spirit fell on her and she
[2:06:39] began to speak with tongues a Baptist
[2:06:41] woman from the First Baptist Church of
[2:06:42] Shreveport and then she didn't know what
[2:06:44] she had did and then before she could
[2:06:47] say anything the Holy Spirit the Holy
[2:06:48] Spirit gave the interpretation and said
[2:06:50] thus says the Lord within three months
[2:06:52] there will be the spirit of Moses Elijah
[2:06:55] and Christ ministering in this
[2:06:57] Tabernacle there it happened perfectly
[2:07:02] but we are still waiting for Musa and
[2:07:04] Elijah our entry
[2:07:07] was ministering in brother Jack's Church
[2:07:10] Jack Moore's Church
[2:07:12] when the prophet went there
[2:07:14] how
[2:07:16] how did it happen
[2:07:18] the spirit of moose and Elijah was right
[2:07:21] there into Tabernacle
[2:07:23] prophecies fulfilled and we are looking
[2:07:25] it way ahead and some somehow well
[2:07:28] behind but the Lord is doing the right
[2:07:30] thing right here and as we are in
[2:07:32] brother Jack daft's Church
[2:07:35] I have no doubt the spirit of Moses
[2:07:37] Elijah and Jesus Christ is ministering
[2:07:40] to you and I right now
[2:07:42] amen if you can believe it
[2:07:45] the Lord is here God bless you Sister
[2:07:47] Dixon she's Struck it amen Glory

[2:07:59] the Lord is here let's go to the next
[2:08:01] one
[2:08:03] Glory Hallelujah
[2:08:07] is that an okay a Baptist a man from
[2:08:10] Meriden Mississippi started to lay his
[2:08:12] hand on his refrigerator to get
[2:08:14] something out of the refrigerator and
[2:08:16] the spirit of the Lord came upon him he
[2:08:18] spoke in tongues not knowing what he was
[2:08:20] doing you know Baptist is really don't
[2:08:21] speak in tongues
[2:08:27] baptism if you get baptized and they
[2:08:29] have that Revelation strong you can
[2:08:31] never take it from Baptist but they
[2:08:33] don't speak in tongues sometimes they
[2:08:35] don't drown if I'm right and things like
[2:08:37] that
[2:08:38] and he spoke in terms not knowing what
[2:08:39] he was doing and before he could
[2:08:41] understand what he was doing the Holy
[2:08:43] Spirit spoke back and said go to
[2:08:44] Shreveport Louisiana my servant will
[2:08:47] tell you what to do and he came there
[2:08:49] and said I don't understand this never
[2:08:50] happened before Oh My we are living in
[2:08:53] the last day just before the coming of
[2:08:54] the Lord amen

[2:09:52] help you even little sister little
[2:09:54] brothers that you might not know what
[2:09:55] God is doing you might not understand
[2:09:56] just like the woman that spoke in
[2:09:58] tongues they didn't even know that the
[2:10:00] Lord is fulfilling scriptures in their
[2:10:01] lives
[2:10:03] when I was just a new quiet let's say
[2:10:05] five years in the message
[2:10:06] there was a time a pastor was traveling
[2:10:10] and then he was going to Belgium through
[2:10:12] the pastor at the Belgium church has
[2:10:13] died and then he was going to help them
[2:10:16] raise a pastor and also baptize not
[2:10:19] baptize dedicate a baby
[2:10:21] so I took care of his house and we went
[2:10:24] for a youth meeting on Saturday just an
[2:10:27] informal meeting pray and fasting
[2:10:29] and after that I remember that they can
[2:10:30] pick me up from there we went pray had
[2:10:33] they just used prayer and fasting pray
[2:10:35] and fasting and I came back in the night
[2:10:37] and I had a dream
[2:10:39] in the dream somebody told me this is
[2:10:41] Paul Paul and Paul was one of my heroes
[2:10:44] before I even got the message I really
[2:10:46] love I read about Paul I did in my high
[2:10:48] school we had what they call Bible
[2:10:50] knowledge so I took that course for for
[2:10:52] three years and I know almost everything
[2:10:54] in the book of Acts Paul's genius I just
[2:10:58] can recite it to you verbatim
[2:11:00] so Paul was one of my will I say my
[2:11:03] mentors my heroes in the Bible and I
[2:11:04] said Paul I will show light to see Paul
[2:11:07] and there was a fire if I you know we
[2:11:09] use natural things to understand
[2:11:11] spiritual things not the physical fire
[2:11:13] burning but the glory of the Lord he was
[2:11:16] wearing a green smoke and the glory of
[2:11:18] the Lord around him I said that is Paul
[2:11:21] everything about him and the dream left
[2:11:24] I didn't understand I was just I wrote
[2:11:26] in my little dream book
[2:11:27] but later in years
[2:11:30] when I was a kid at the age of about
[2:11:31] maybe 6 10 12 the Lord revealed to me
[2:11:34] that I was spent part of my life in the
[2:11:36] United States I knew that one always in
[2:11:38] my heart but I never knew I would go to
[2:11:40] Latin America I never had a clue I never
[2:11:43] knew nothing was mean so later in years
[2:11:47] that dream became oh I see just like the
[2:11:50] the the Auntie Jemima
[2:11:53] I knew that God has a purpose for this
[2:11:55] dream letting me see Paul because part
[2:11:58] of Paul is not poor as a human being but
[2:12:01] I also be doing what Paul is doing my
[2:12:03] calling part of it looks like Paul's
[2:12:05] Ministry and I said Lord that's why
[2:12:07] there was a sister we had an
[2:12:09] international meeting and pastor's wife
[2:12:10] one person's wife said brother the Lord
[2:12:13] showed me a dream or for the seven
[2:12:15] Church ages
[2:12:19] from Paul to Wesley and I didn't see by
[2:12:23] the brown said Lord where's my prophet
[2:12:25] I didn't see my prophet and so the Dream
[2:12:27] came back again and he showed me from
[2:12:29] the first one Paul and I saw about
[2:12:31] Abraham and I said I had a desire a need
[2:12:34] and said Abraham would the Lord do this
[2:12:36] for me there's a desire on my heart
[2:12:38] would the Lord did this for me he said
[2:12:41] brother if I if I know how to draw I
[2:12:43] could draw the face of all the seven
[2:12:45] churches Messengers I I said I have a
[2:12:48] place Crystal clay only I'm not an
[2:12:51] artist I can't I can't put it in in
[2:12:53] drawing
[2:12:54] God loves his people
[2:12:57] and then that ComEd their heart to the
[2:12:59] Lord
[2:12:59] sometimes we look at things in a big
[2:13:01] fanciful way but the Lord that is so
[2:13:03] simple
[2:13:04] that if you are not careful to pass on
[2:13:07] top of you
[2:13:08] the Lord is doing things right here
[2:13:10] the Lord has you right at the right
[2:13:12] place
[2:13:13] young sisters young Brothers I'm glad
[2:13:15] some of you have found your ministry
[2:13:16] hold on to it don't let nothing of the
[2:13:19] world attract you but hold on to what
[2:13:22] the Lord is teaching you under the
[2:13:24] ministry of brother Jack

[2:17:23] David did what with the slingshot kill a
[2:17:25] bear a lion and even go out with a

[2:17:31] to you make use of it amen and a man
[2:17:34] when you serve the Lord God blesses your
[2:17:35] generation
[2:17:36] I believe the man I never met a man but
[2:17:39] I saw his children his grandchildren
[2:17:41] great grandchildren his
[2:17:42] daughters-in-laws and I saw this man
[2:17:45] serve the Lord he was a Visionary he
[2:17:47] bought a land
[2:17:48] outside the city city center about just
[2:17:51] about less than 15 minutes and it was
[2:17:53] cheaper a case of land he put his little
[2:17:56] church over there and now his children
[2:17:58] grandchildren they all have learned to
[2:18:00] put put their burdens over there so all
[2:18:02] of them leave the children were telling
[2:18:03] they used to live in the city but they
[2:18:05] come back to the to the town just about
[2:18:07] 12 minutes from the city
[2:18:10] and mangoes were everywhere
[2:18:12] those Place mangoes were like wildlife
[2:18:15] every house has gone mangoes in the
[2:18:18] woods
[2:18:19] eating language like that natural mango
[2:18:22] not a hybrid type everywhere they pack
[2:18:26] like half suitcase of mango to take you
[2:18:28] to the next station I didn't know next
[2:18:30] time I'll go there and fly directly to
[2:18:32] the US because I had went to another
[2:18:34] place to preacher I gave all the mangoes
[2:18:36] to to the person's wife over there
[2:18:39] laughs
[2:18:43] they live just natural and you could see
[2:18:45] the blessing of the of the brother
[2:18:47] Lazaro and his family
[2:18:49] when you serve the Lord some of you
[2:18:50] sisters the decisions you take now is
[2:18:53] going to affect your generation
[2:18:55] the blessings of your fathers
[2:18:57] grandmothers grandparents your pastors

[2:19:01] when you say the Lord you might be the
[2:19:03] first person in your generation to
[2:19:04] receive the word of God this way but God
[2:19:06] is using you for a purpose and a
[2:19:09] blessing that is given to you you might
[2:19:11] not even manifest everything by your
[2:19:13] children your children children who
[2:19:15] manifest those blessing and the people

[2:21:23] and then from there I went to Mexico and
[2:21:25] went to Mexico City the capital we had
[2:21:28] three services over there and one
[2:21:29] brother gave you a testimony he said
[2:21:31] brother his son is a minister I have a
[2:21:33] little uh online prayer group and we
[2:21:36] preach ministers young ministers old

[2:21:39] Carlos is his father said brother I have
[2:21:41] a testimony for you remember you sent a
[2:21:43] recorded prayer I said I don't even
[2:21:45] quite remember say I was sick and you
[2:21:48] send that prayer to my son Carlos he
[2:21:50] said the doctor declared me that I was
[2:21:52] going to die in a couple of days so I
[2:21:54] should do my documents because they
[2:21:56] didn't have any hope for me and then my
[2:21:58] son brought that
[2:22:00] um that prayer prayer that you prayed in
[2:22:03] Spanish at the hospital and I believe it
[2:22:05] that I'm going to be healed
[2:22:08] and I didn't prepare no documents
[2:22:09] because I knew I wasn't going to leave
[2:22:11] my wife and my children
[2:22:13] and said I listened to it and the Lord
[2:22:15] brought my life back
[2:22:17] I didn't die because I said I was from
[2:22:19] foot to this week was gone
[2:22:22] and the daughter said there's no way
[2:22:24] you're going to be vegetable because you
[2:22:26] are you're gone so just if you have a
[2:22:28] document do it before you finally give
[2:22:30] in and he said I didn't give in but I
[2:22:33] believe the Lord and the prayers that
[2:22:35] you pray for me and the Lord brought my
[2:22:36] life back
[2:22:38] you wouldn't know what God will use you
[2:22:40] for
[2:22:41] unless you surrender yourself to the
[2:22:42] Lord
[2:22:45] from there I went to another church
[2:22:47] to preach and I preach in Spanish I had
[2:22:50] one young brother who was going to
[2:22:52] interpret for me but he was so nervous I
[2:22:54] said brother don't worry we're gonna be
[2:22:56] fine so I'm preached in Spanish if I
[2:22:58] miss something I don't know the past
[2:23:00] tense too much but if I miss something
[2:23:02] the brother will help me the next I
[2:23:04] preach Wednesday and Friday and Friday I
[2:23:07] preach totally in Spanish and if I did
[2:23:09] told me that they prefer me to preach in
[2:23:10] Spanish the church in Veracruz one of
[2:23:12] them the the pastor and the family said
[2:23:15] brother preaching Spanish I said my past
[2:23:17] tense is not good I need the translator
[2:23:19] so they've got their brother from
[2:23:20] Phoenix Arizona but I was it's called
[2:23:22] Jose and then he when I preach it goes
[2:23:25] into the system he picks it up and then
[2:23:27] translated in a speaker and they hear it
[2:23:30] so some of them I just move on as a
[2:23:33] brother move on move on and I kept
[2:23:35] moving on kept moving but I said I'm
[2:23:37] enjoying myself keep keep on going we

[2:23:40] we understand 95 and I said my past
[2:23:43] tense is not good I'm selling the past
[2:23:45] and so I need a translator and then I
[2:23:48] did it but you don't need the translator
[2:23:49] just just keep going and so the Lord did
[2:23:52] something marvelous I preached 11
[2:23:54] sermons

[2:30:13] amen
[2:30:16] amen oh so good uh for us to recognize a
[2:30:21] man what God is doing in our midst right
[2:30:23] now uh it's um he was it started off by
[2:30:27] saying how the Sadducees and the
[2:30:29] Pharisees Pharisees looking way off
[2:30:31] Saturday's failing to see what was
[2:30:33] happening right there before them and uh
[2:30:35] and it's very easy for us to get into
[2:30:37] the same type of spirit today we miss
[2:30:39] what God is doing right in our midst uh
[2:30:42] always look into some future work and
[2:30:44] you know as he was even just going
[2:30:45] through the Rapture and how you know
[2:30:47] there's uh this raptor is going to be
[2:30:48] made of of Believers of every age right
[2:30:51] you know and I believe the scripture
[2:30:53] tells us the first would be last and
[2:30:55] last will be first so you know those
[2:30:57] that went down a man that went down
[2:30:59] before us in this latest in age they'll
[2:31:02] be the first ones to rise up you know
[2:31:04] and then just work back to the other
[2:31:05] ages but we we know that it's going to
[2:31:08] be a part of this this body amen it's
[2:31:10] made up of Believers from every age
[2:31:12] every age we're just so happy to be a
[2:31:14] part of this age so we we thank God for
[2:31:17] that 11 services and I don't know how
[2:31:19] many days that's a lot of preaching I
[2:31:21] tell you uh we thank the Lord for using
[2:31:23] our brother amen there in uh in South
[2:31:26] America and pray that God will just open
[2:31:28] up the door for him to go back and to be
[2:31:31] used again but that that's uh it's just
[2:31:33] wonderful to see uh people leaving this
[2:31:37] pulpit and going into all the all the
[2:31:39] places in the world and just taking the
[2:31:41] Gospel of Jesus Christ that is the the
[2:31:44] uh the Great Commission that the Lord
[2:31:46] Jesus has called us to go into all the
[2:31:48] world and preach the gospel and it's
[2:31:50] happening right here at Spirit and Truth
[2:31:52] Tabernacle so we thank the Lord amen I'm
[2:31:55] not going to delay the time we'll have a
[2:31:56] word of prayer and uh and then quickly
[2:31:59] uh I just want to just give you all a
[2:32:01] quick update as to where we are with
[2:32:03] some things and uh and then we'll go
[2:32:04] from there all right so let's just pray
[2:32:06] father we thank you for uh the this
[2:32:09] wonderful service you gave us here on
[2:32:10] today thank you for uh your servant
[2:32:13] brother quick who just get themselves
[2:32:14] out of the way and just sharing the word
[2:32:17] with us Lord how just little examples
[2:32:22] that he was just sharing along the way
[2:32:24] how it's so easy to miss what God is
[2:32:26] doing even just how the prophet was
[2:32:28] trying to go and preach the trumpets and
[2:32:31] you had to show him it's already been
[2:32:33] preached it was supernaturally preached
[2:32:35] and and gone after you showed it to him
[2:32:37] he began to realize what had already
[2:32:39] happened God opened our eyes open our
[2:32:42] understanding we can see the things that
[2:32:44] you're doing even right now the prophet
[2:32:47] told us that uh man is always thinking
[2:32:50] for what you did and they always thank
[2:32:52] you for what you're going to do but they
[2:32:54] fail to thank you for what you're doing
[2:32:55] right now so father we just asked that
[2:32:58] you Lord Jesus amen will continue to
[2:33:01] open up our understanding and give us
[2:33:02] Revelation that we might draw closer to
[2:33:05] you blessed Lord the people as they
[2:33:07] prepare to leave this place but not your
[2:33:09] presence give traveling mercies to each
[2:33:10] and every one and uh we again want to
[2:33:13] remember brother Robles that she would
[2:33:15] touch him God raise Them Up For Your
[2:33:17] Glory fathers our prayer we commit them
[2:33:19] down to your hands it's in Jesus name we
[2:33:21] pray amen amen praise the Lord you can
[2:33:25] be seated Amen in the presence of the
[2:33:27] Lord amen
