You're summoning us [music] to come and stand in your presence, Lord, to offer praise and thanksgiving, Lord, oh Father, and to bless and praise your holy name and to hear your word as you would speak, Father.

Strengthen his grandfather, Lord Jesus, and strengthen Brother Maris and the family, Lord God, and comfort them as only you can, Father. You are the living God, Lord, that he's leaning upon, Father. Sister Amanda is leaning upon you as well, Father. She has need of comfort, Lord. Father, help her during this time. Help her family, Lord Jesus. Oh, Father, move throughout the families, Lord God, to if it's just one soul, Lord, you're seeking to save, Lord. Do the work, Lord Jesus. We're trusting you and we're committing [music] these families into your hands, Lord. Father, we pray [clears throat] for Sister Michelle's mother, Lord Jesus. Father, she had a fall, Lord Jesus, and she's getting up there, Lord Jesus, and she needs a touch from you. Father, if you can touch Sarah's body, Lord Jesus, you can touch Sister [music] Michelle's mother's body, Lord. Father, we know you are the healer, Lord Jesus. And Father, we put all of our confidence in you that the work is already done. So, we place our faith along with Sister [music] Michelle's, Lord, believing for her mother, Lord, that she'll receive a complete healing, Father.

There was so much on my mind. searching for that peace, the peace I could not find. But then I kneel down to pray, praying, "Help me, please." He said, "Don't have to cry cuz I'll supply all your needs soon as I stop worrying. worrying how the story ends. When I let go and I let God, I let God have his way. That's when things start happening. And I stopped looking at back then. I let go and I let go. I let God have his way. I let go and let God. I let go and I let God. I let go. And I let God. I let go.

[singing] It's not my battle to fight. I have to know if I put it in your hands, everything [screaming] will be all right. As soon as I stop worrying, worrying [screaming] how the story ends, I let go and I let God. I let God have it.

But it's just kind of becoming my anthem. you know, a song that you kind of got to sing to yourself when you when you're a little down in the spirit and and you you're looking around and you know, you don't you don't want to you don't want to, you know, uh uh op try to operate, you know, in in those types of conditions. You know, the devil beat you down, boy. We know the greatest battle that's ever fought is in the mind. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; It won't always be like this.

We appreciate the Lord this morning. Hallelujah. Amen. Let's get our Bibles out this morning. Y'all just continue to pray for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. I got to definitely try to get some of this dust off my voice. Man, &gt;&gt; I used to could hit some notes, but I don't I you know, they say you don't use it, you lose it. &gt;&gt; But, uh, I'm going try not to lose it. I done lost a lot of stuff, but I don't want to lose. Let us look at a couple of places in the scripture. Let's remember the saints u in Australia. [snorts] It look like they was having a good time. I I saw a little clip. It was brother Larry was singing and had all the fellas in the back. They like to do that, you know, all get together and they just be up there having a good time. The Saints was jumping all up and down. Even even had uh brother Quint. I see they they put and he you know he ain't have a whole lot of he it don't look like he got a whole lot of rhythm and stuff and he was like WELL EVERYBODY LET ME TRY TO GET me a little something and I just so I was so tickled. I say, "Bro, brother," uh, Quinn said, "Well, Y'ALL GET ALL THIS BY Y'ALL. I'mma get me a little sub of this here." Romans chapter 8. Um, I got a place in there. This these scriptures ain't going to really make sense probably to y'all until I start talking. But, uh, we want to read Romans 8 and 14. It says as for as many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God. And then one place in in first Peter chapter uh five. Oh my. 1 Peter 5 and8 it says be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour. Uh whom resist steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplish in your brethren that [snorts] are in the world. But the God of all grace, whom has called us into an eternal glory by Jesus Christ, after that ye have suffered a while, make your uh make you perfect uh establish, strengthen, and settle you. Let us bow our heads for a word of prayer. Gracious Father, we just come this morning to just give thanks and praise for just allowing us this opportunity to uh be in the service of the living God uh this morning. We just pray that, Father, that you'd have your way uh in the service, Lord. Take control of our our lips, Lord Jesus. And we just trust that we could be edifying in Jesus Christ's wonderful name. Amen. Amen. You may be seated. uh this morning from the scriptures like I said it'll take a minute uh cuz you know when I was looking at the scriptures I was like well praise the Lord we just have to comment and hopefully uh we could make some sense this morning y'all y'all pray for me also this morning it's been a it's been a while since we've kind of exercised the gift so it it may take a few minutes to get out of the way but um we want to talk on a little subject, true connection. Um, just maybe uh the early part of the week, I was I was just kind of in prayer. I was totally studying something totally totally different. I I wanted to uh uh preach on earnestly content for the faith. But you know, I was I was praying and and uh just the word connection just in prayer just kind of came to our heart and uh you know it got it got so strong that I had to get off my knees and write it down before I forget. And I picked up my pen and started trying to uh uh uh write some notes and different things. And so y'all y'all y'all pray for us this morning. Like we say um uh I I have an objective this morning. Uh there's something in my heart. You know, always when I'm preaching, I I I have an objective. is not to uh belittle anybody or anything, but it's to try to transform uh just the the way that we we think as as individuals. Is that right? Um, it it takes I'm I'm realizing this more and more as as I go along and live life. Um, as as as a servant of God, as a Christian, as as an individual, uh, I realize how how much I need transformation in the way that I think, &gt;&gt; in the way that uh, I approach things. Is that right? it be because you know th this thing is it's it's all about it's it's all about being being productive being overcomers. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Uh and and just learning how to think right. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Right. Because you know the Bible say there's there's there's a a a just a way that that seem right. And a lot of times sometimes those things aren't right &gt;&gt; because because we have no basis for those things. &gt;&gt; And and you know I always want us to keep in mind YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE IN A BATTLE CHURCH. Is that right? &gt;&gt; We're we're we're in a battle. This is not a picnic. you know, the scripture, we we got to keep certain uh uh THINGS IN OUR MINDS as as we're going along and and we're walking this this this Christian life which uh consists of A NATURAL PART AND A SPIRITUAL PART. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. AND AND YOU GOT TO KNOW HOW TO APPROACH BOTH. &gt;&gt; Is that right? in in in order to keep from to keep from um being deceived CUZ THE SCRIPTURE SAYS, "SEE THAT NO MAN deceives us." &gt;&gt; So we we we WE DON'T WANT TO BE WE DON'T WANT TO BE THROWN OFF. WE DON'T WANT TO BE OUT here on on an island and and you know just don't know where we're going. We don't want know know what we're doing. Is that right? YOU KNOW, FOR ME, I WISH I wish I COULD HAVE BEEN A part of a ministry, you know, especially as as a young person uh uh where where UH MY THINKING WAS CHALLENGED. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; AND AND I WAS GIVEN INFORMATION to teach ME HOW TO THINK. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. Come on, preach with me, church. I know we missing a lot of folk, but y'all, we come to have church, &gt;&gt; you know, TO TEACH ME HOW TO THINK. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AND AND WHAT'S MY APPROACH TO THOUGHT? &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. AND AND WHAT AM I BASING MY THINKING UPON? Is that right? WHEN WHEN WHEN WE LOOK BACK TO THE BOOK OF GENESIS, uh I always go back there because brother Brandham teaches us that sir, &gt;&gt; you always got to go back to the beginning to do to get the uh fullest and truth perspective of a thing. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Outside of that, uh uh you you just don't really get the full picture of it. The first the first place where we see true connection is in the book of Genesis, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Uh y'all pray for me. I got a little quote I want to read. Um it's is in Genesis, right? With with you know Adam and Eve and God. THAT WAS THE truest connection, right, that we'll find anywhere. The truest connection. Is that right? A a perfect connection based upon uh uh um eternal principles. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; UH BECAUSE THEY HAD THEY [screaming] HAD, YOU KNOW, THE THE PERFECT INTERPRETATION of the word. Is that right? SEE CHURCH, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I I'VE LEARNED, you know, in studying the message, YOU YOU GOT TO HAVE THE [screaming] RIGHT BASIS, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; RIGHT. YOU YOU GOT TO HAVE THE RIGHT BASIS uh uh uh for connection &gt;&gt; or fellowship. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; If if it's GOING TO BE A TRUE CONNECTION, IT'S GOT TO BE BASED UPON SOMETHING, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? YOU KNOW, I YOU KNOW, GROWING UP, I I WAS I HAD A lot of different connections, but you know, when when I LOOK AT IT NOW, I CAN SEE it really wasn't based on anything that could be longlasting, &gt;&gt; anything that could be productive. It wasn't nothing that that I could it could have elevated me &gt;&gt; to to the spots that I desired [screaming] &gt;&gt; right to be. IS THAT RIGHT? &gt;&gt; THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT. &gt;&gt; ONE ONE THING I'LL TELL Y'ALL CHURCH, I DON'T FOOL WITH EVERYBODY. &gt;&gt; I just hate to say it like that, but you know, I've I've kind of grown up. you know, I'm I'm I'm a lot older, but you know, uh I just I'm just a funny type of person that I am who I am, but but I'M NOT A KID ANYMORE. &gt;&gt; I'm not I'm really not a kid anymore. So, if if if in my approach to things, if if certain things aren't there, then you're not going to really find me kind of there, &gt;&gt; right? Come on, preach with me, church. Y'all real quiet. &gt;&gt; I know I ain't preached in a while, but you know, I'm like, brother Wes, I think I'm preaching real good. &gt;&gt; See, be be because, YOU KNOW, IN MY APPROACH THIS MORNING, YOU KNOW, WE JUST WANT TO CHALLENGE THE WAY that that that you you look at things. You look at life, &gt;&gt; you you look at uh uh connections and people that you come in contact with and things of that nature. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Cuz you know, Eve and Adam AND GOD, THEY HAD [screaming] THEY HAD THE RIGHT KIND OF CONNECTION. They had the truest uh uh uh connection. &gt;&gt; Right. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But then I WANT TO SHOW US SOMETHING. Watch the connection that that Eve had with the serpent, &gt;&gt; right? The the Watch something here, Brother Brandham said. And And IT'S WEIRD BECAUSE SHE HAD EVERYTHING. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; Every everything was in divine order. &gt;&gt; I mean, everything was in oneness. Everything was in agreement. IT COULDN'T GET NO BETTER, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? BUT THE PROPHET OF GOD MAKES A STATEMENT. HE SAY Eve lusted. &gt;&gt; She lusted &gt;&gt; to be smart. &gt;&gt; She lusted. Now, y'all can pull it up if you want to for a PhD. Now, I I ain't got a I ain't got all the quotes with me, but I know it's in there cuz I read them already the early part of the week. Amen. &gt;&gt; She she lusted, &gt;&gt; right, to be smart. Uh she had more information right from the beginning than she knew what to do with &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; You know, it's and it's weird BECAUSE YOU YOU WATCH PEOPLE AND AND I'VE WATCHED people from my position, right? YOU KNOW, YOU REALIZE THAT PEOPLE have been given more information than they've ever had. Amen. IN THEIR ENTIRE [screaming] LIVES AS CHRISTIANS. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. AS CHRISTIANS HAVE BEEN GIVEN MORE. LISTEN, CHURCH. BECAUSE WE HAVE AN OPEN [screaming] BOOK, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? WE'RE NOT PREACHING FROM A CLOSED BOOK. &gt;&gt; WE WE HAVE THE MIND [screaming] OF GOD. RIGHT? &gt;&gt; THE INTELLIGENCE OF GOD, &gt;&gt; ALL OF WHAT GOD [screaming] THOUGHT ABOUT US, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? GLORY TO GOD. I MEAN, WE WE HAVE A A YOU KNOW, A THINKING MAN'S FILTER. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; THAT THAT WE CAN RUN ALL OF [screaming] OUR THOUGHTS THROUGH. AND THAT'S IMPORTANT. &gt;&gt; That's a powerful message, I tell you. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. BUT YET AND [screaming] STILL FOR A LOT OF people &gt;&gt; is not enough. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; AND AND NO MATTER WHAT LEVEL WE'VE WE'VE PREACHED AND WE'VE HEARD THE WORD PREACH FOR A lot of people. And I'm talking about people who have shouted. &gt;&gt; Come on church. &gt;&gt; People that have screamed. People that have run around the church and everything else. But you know THEY THEY STILL WASN'T SETTLED, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; And see, you know, without the baptism of the Holy Ghost, you you you're not going to be settled, &gt;&gt; right? Cuz you're not really understanding. &gt;&gt; It's emotional and maybe intellectual. It take the baptism of the Holy Ghost TO GIVE REVELATION. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. like like Peter, who do you say that I the son of man am? &gt;&gt; RIGHT? THAT THAT DIDN'T COME FROM HUMAN INSTRUMENTALITY, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? UH THAT RE BECAUSE THE OTHER BRETHREN AROUND HIM COULDN'T SPEAK UP. THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT SPOKE from within Peter. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS A REVELATION COMING TO HIM FROM GOD. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And see, you know, the prophet says revelation, you know, means more to us than we could imagine. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; I I enjoy coming to church. I enjoy the excitement of it. But but what means more to me uh uh is the revelation of the word striking my heart. BE BECAUSE I REALIZE THAT'S THE THING THAT'S GOING TO KEEP me when the enemy TRYING TO BRING SADNESS DOWN UPON ME. &gt;&gt; Oppression and depression and things of that nature. THAT'S THE THING THAT ELEVATES ME. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Glory to God. See, and and here here's the thing, church, you know, um when when people when people are are are looking for for things and lusting for things that's contrary to biblical principles, A LOT OF TIMES THEY'RE THEY'RE MOST VULNERABLE. &gt;&gt; Come on, T. They're they're most vulnerable, right? See, it means to be susceptible to physical and emotional attack, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. A LOT OF TIMES, YOU KNOW, you you watch people and you you see how susceptible people are to the attacks of the enemy, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? GLORY TO GOD. PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ARE VULNERABLE &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; TO THE ATTACKS OF THE ENEMY. YOU NEVER WILL BE ABLE TO WITHSTAND THE ATTACKS OF THE ENEMY APART FROM THE WORD. &gt;&gt; AND SEE, I'MMA TELL Y'ALL SOMETHING, CHURCH. YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHY [screaming] GOD GIVES US SHEPHERDS. SEE, &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SOMETIMES WE WALK AROUND WE WE WALK AROUND WE ARROGANT AND WE PUFFED UP AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE AND YOU DON'T EVEN REALIZE APART FROM YOU KNOW THE GOD [screaming] ANOINTING THE SHEPHERD GIVING US SOMETHING to uh help us to elevate AND TO HELP US TO THINK A DIFFERENT WAY and approach a THING FROM A DIFFERENT STANDPOINT, WE'D be in trouble. We'd all be wiped out. &gt;&gt; You and me both. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Now, now we've been DOING THIS A LITTLE WHILE AND AND I'VE WATCHED CHURCH AND I WATCH PEOPLE AND I'M NOT SAYING THIS TO SAY THAT I KNOW IT ALL BECAUSE I GOT MY ISSUES AND EVERYTHING TOO, BUT YOU KNOW, I GOT A GIFT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND THE SPIRIT OF GOD WORKING WITHIN ME, RIGHT? AND THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THAT I COULD SEE YOU. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. APART FROM THAT, THEN YOU DON'T YOU DON'T REALLY SEE. YOU SAY, "AH, NO, MAN. I not me, brother Smiley." &gt;&gt; Yes, you. &gt;&gt; A LOT OF TIMES THE PEOPLE WHO FEEL LIKE THEY KNOW IT ALL are the people who know the less, &gt;&gt; right? Are the people who the are the most vulnerable. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Amen. &gt;&gt; SEE, THINK ABOUT WHAT I JUST SAID. Eve was lusting for something, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; She she WAS SHE WAS LUSTING FOR something and and and the the ENEMY CAME IN BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE GOT TO ALWAYS KEEP IN MIND EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT HE'S TRYING TO STEAL, KILL, AND DESTROY. &gt;&gt; HE HE'S TRYING TO ONE UP. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. HE'S ALWAYS [screaming] TRYING TO ONE UP THE CHURCH, ONE UP THE INDIVIDUAL. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; But we got his number this morning. &gt;&gt; SEE, LIKE THE PROPHET OF GOD SAY, [screaming] WE GOT TO STRIP HIM DOWN BY THE SCRIPTURE. &gt;&gt; YOU YOU GOT TO SEE THESE THINGS BY THE SCRIPTURE. YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. WE'LL BACK UP. THE TRUEST CONNECTION, &gt;&gt; THE TRUEST BOND [screaming] THAT THERE WAS WAS IN THE BEGINNING IN GENESIS, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; THEN THEN WATCH THEN WATCH EVE. AND WE AIN'T women bashing. We ain't no bashing. &gt;&gt; I'm just trying to give information and truth. And now y'all do with it what you want when I get done. &gt;&gt; You can throw it in the trash, &gt;&gt; right? But think on it. Ponder it. SHE SHE GOT on a connection, right, with with the serpent, right? Glory to God. Uh without THE RIGHT KIND OF THOUGHT PROCESS, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; Cuz let let me let me just read this this right quick and then we'll we'll try to move on. Uh y'all right this morning? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Now uh in the message led by the spirit it says and and and let me make sure and how one of the most wonderful things of God and the con is the connection of the fellowship between God and the Christian is that uh they are son sons of God and are led by the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Let me read that again because that's that's a powerful powerful statement, right? He says uh one of the most wonderful things of God and the Christian, he says the connection of the fellowship between God and the Christian is that they are sons of God led by the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; And and and I got some some things later on. LISTEN, OUR FELLOWSHIP HAS GOT TO BE BASED upon something. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; It's it's it's got to be based upon something. I've been toiling with this thought all week long. I ain't been able to sleep hardly. I might be able to get me some rest tonight. bec because you you realize it it be so it be so much material. Yes. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says here, he says, "Now, now fellowship comes by love." &gt;&gt; See, LISTEN, CHURCH, THERE'S GOT TO BE A BASIS, RIGHT? There there's got to be a basis for for these different things, right? &gt;&gt; Uh because IF NOT, YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PART OF. And see, see for me, &gt;&gt; if if I have a connection, &gt;&gt; man, I want I want to know what I'M A PART OF, &gt;&gt; WHAT WHAT DOES THIS THING ENTAILS, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; WHAT WHAT WHAT IS IT ROOTED and grounded in? &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. I got I gota I got there, you know, uh I'll get back to that in a second. I'm I'm over the all over the place.

And and we don't have any questions. We're not satisfied. And we we just in these things happy golucky. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; AND AND NOT REALIZING THE DETRIMENT, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. THE THE detriment of of these DIFFERENT THINGS BECAUSE WE GO IN AND AND WE'RE NOT BEING LED BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD BECAUSE THE SPIRIT OF GOD LEADS YOU BY THE WORD. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; ALWAYS. ALWAYS. Whether it's uh UH OR UH BUSINESS OR WHETHER it's it's you know you want to be CONNECTED WITH A GIRL OR A BOY, GOD IS GOING TO LEAD YOU INTO THESE THINGS BY THE WORD. &gt;&gt; IT'S GOT TO BE A BASIS FOR THESE THINGS, A FOUNDATION FOR YOU TO BUILD UPON. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. GLORY TO GOD. AND IN ANYTHING, WATCH GOD. GOD [screaming] ALWAYS BUILD A THING ON ON SOMETHING SOLID. AND THE ONLY SOLID THING THAT THERE IS IS THE [screaming] WORD.

This thing has got to be on Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; See, even even in our approach to church, right? THIS THING IS FOR ME.

RIGHT. I WAS KIND OF, YOU KNOW, WISHYWASHY. &gt;&gt; SEE, THIS THIS IS THE THING WITH PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, THEY WISHY-WASHY. THEY IN AND OUT. They &gt;&gt; is because they don't even know the questions to ask. &gt;&gt; Right? Look, you look at the Queen of Sheba in um 2 Chronicles uh chapter nine. Let's let's kind of read that. Y'all could pull that up for me if y'all don't mind. Maybe I got it biblically. Right. When I I I was reading this, it this this shows you this shows you the maturity of of this lady cuz she SHE WAS MAKING A BIG SACRIFICE, &gt;&gt; SIR. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. Come on. She was going through the desert with all of this stuff and you know she would had been hearing about a certain you know re movement revival and and and she she wasn't willing to make full uh commitment TO THE THING WITHOUT ASKING QUESTIONS. And just an analogy that had been whirling around in in in my head. It's almost like, you know, you're in a hotel room and I don't know for you, I don't trust folk. So, I I latch that bottom lock and then I I like to latch that other one that you know, you slide that that's you know, uh you you could open it, but it ain't nobody could still get access to your room &gt;&gt; CUZ IT SLIDES just enough so you could peep out of it and talk. Yeah. May I help you? Who are you? Glory to God. See, I ain't THE TYPE TO JUST OPEN THE DOOR AND NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. I'm tell I don't cuz I don't want you to HAVE ACCESS TO ME BECAUSE I don't really fully know who you are. &gt;&gt; YOU YOU ONLY GET ACCESS &gt;&gt; UPON CERTAIN [screaming] GROUNDS, &gt;&gt; UPON CERTAIN BASES. Y'ALL BETTER LISTEN TO ME, CHURCH. &gt;&gt; PREACHER.

She cute. She may not always be. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. D glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. COME ON. WATCH THE QUEEN OF SHEBA. The first verse uh in chapter nine, she says, "And when the Queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; TO PROVE SOLOMON WITH HARD QUESTIONS AT JERUSALEM." &gt;&gt; SEE, we don't do that. &gt;&gt; See, we're we're not inquisitive. WE DON'T INQUIRE. We we we we go we go into these places and different things um gullible. &gt;&gt; Come on, preach with me, church. &gt;&gt; Gullible. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. Be &gt;&gt; because you know we're we're we're we're LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO SATISFY us &gt;&gt; or or fill [snorts] us or fulfill us, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? SO, SO AUTOMATICALLY [screaming] WE'RE WE'RE WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO THINK A LOT OF TIMES. &gt;&gt; AND SO WE'RE WE'RE GULLIBLE TO START WITH, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? Come on. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And and IF AND IF YOU'RE IN THAT STATE, THEY THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT'LL GRIND you up &gt;&gt; like Swiss cheese, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? IF IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE, YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU STAND. GLORY TO GOD. &gt;&gt; TRUE. &gt;&gt; I'M TELLING YOU, PEOPLE THAT YOU THINK YOUR FRIENDS AREN'T REALLY A LOT OF TIMES, &gt;&gt; AMEN. AREN'T YOUR FRIENDS. WHEN BECAUSE WHEN YOU YOU'LL START [screaming] SEEING WHEN YOU START ASKING QUESTIONS, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? BUT IF YOU GO IN THERE GULLIBLE AND NAIVE AND ALL OF THAT KIND OF STUFF and and you you YOU KNOW YOUR MIND IS NOT moving at the SOUND OF LIGHT. YOUR THOUGHTS AREN'T MOVING. YOU'RE NOT ASKING yourself the questions, &gt;&gt; man. You'll be tow up. &gt;&gt; You find yourself so messed up and you don't even know how. &gt;&gt; But this this this wasn't the Queen of Sheba. See, she heard of THE FAME OF SOLOMON. She came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; With a a a very great company and camels that bore spices and gold and abundance. She was she was come TO SOLOMON. SHE COMMUNED WITH HIM, RIGHT? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; OF ALL THAT WAS IN HER HEART.

Glory to God. You know, you know, like I say, y'all kind of know a little bit about about my my story.

A bu bunch of disloyal people, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And and here and here's the thing. AND THE REASON WHY YOU you're in this connection because you WAS GULLIBLE TO START WITH, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; BECAUSE most people most young men and women in gangs are in gangs because uh they're looking for something &gt;&gt; to fill a void. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; To fill a hole, &gt;&gt; right? But they making connections with the wrong kind of connections. See, but this Queen of Sheba, you know, in the SECOND VERSE, AND SOLOMON TOLD HER ALL THAT, all her questions, and there was nothing here from Solomon which he uh told her, um, and when the Queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and watch this, and the house that he had built, &gt;&gt; and the meat of his table, &gt;&gt; and the sitting of his servants and the abundance of his min ministers and their apparel, &gt;&gt; right?

YOU YOU CAN'T ALLOW our feelings and our emotions and &gt;&gt; our even our thinking, &gt;&gt; right, TO GET IN THE WAY OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD'S leading of you, &gt;&gt; right? Because in the THE LEADING OF GOD, HE'S LEADING YOU. I'VE HEARD A LOT OF PEOPLE, WELL, PASTOR, I feel led. Give me one scripture to support your leading. &gt;&gt; I ain't got to have none. &gt;&gt; Lies. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Lies.

Is Jane a Christian? Come on &gt;&gt; now. This the PARENT IS THIS PARTY GOING TO BE? I DON'T CARE IF IT'S family members, buddy. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Well, y'all listen. I probably was considered a cruel dad with the way that I raised my children. And I know my family members thought that I was very odd. You don't let them kids do nothing, you know. And my my my friends, well, you don't let them kids, man. Y'all kids. I'm like, bro, kids find a way to get the wrong information. Don't kid yourself. I don't care how but you take them to church. &gt;&gt; Huh? Cuz that cuz there's there's connections, COUSINS AND ALL SORTS of folk, right? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And then you get and then right there, brothers and sisters sometimes too because some of them ain't even saved. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Some of them in your own, you know, out of your kids, they got different mindsets. You know, &gt;&gt; glory to God. &gt;&gt; And and you trying to and you trying to lead them a certain way &gt;&gt; and there's a lot I could preach on this morning, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Glory to God. But see, he says, uh uh you got to know what you're looking for. What will our connections be based upon? Right? Come on. IF I'M A PART OF THIS, what is the basis? Cuz because I'm a Christian, right? I'm a I'm a Christian and and it I WANTED our connection to be 100% uh biblically based, &gt;&gt; right? NOT JUST GOOD DEEDS, &gt;&gt; we got to go further than that, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? BECAUSE IF I WANT TO BE A CONNECTED WITH SOMETHING THAT'S MAYBE good deeds, at least I want to make sure, you know, the on the foundation is uh Christianbased, right? &gt;&gt; RIGHT. BUT I I DON'T WANT I don't WANT IT TO BE SECULARLY BASED. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; And then and then AS YOU GO UP, it's like there's there's nothing there's nothing for me to really base this connection upon. This is just all this is all just just worldly and worldly influence and and and and there's there's a disconnect here, &gt;&gt; right? GLORY TO GOD. SEE, I REALIZE THERE'S BEEN A MAN THAT TURNED ON THE LIGHTS FOR ME. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. WHEN WHEN THE LIGHTS IS TURNED DOWN OFF, then you scream. [screaming] &gt;&gt; If y'all know the story, &gt;&gt; right? The little girl, she was fine as long as she could see light. &gt;&gt; She could walk in the light. Y'all ought to talk to me, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? BUT ONCE THAT MAN TURNED THEM LIGHTS OFF, &gt;&gt; RIGHT, she realized I could no longer Oh, y'all ought to talk to me. &gt;&gt; I I COULD I COULD NO LONGER FORGE FORWARD, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? [screaming] BECAUSE THERE THERE'S BEEN A DISCONNECT SOMEWHERE. BECAUSE TO TURN ON LIGHTS, I AIN'T NO REAL ELECTRICIAN, but there's got to be a connection when you flip that switch to turn them on or turn them off, &gt;&gt; bro. Troy know what I'm talking about, right? Troy, electrician. Somewhere when you hit, there's a connection that turns these off. And when you pull that thing down, there's a disconnect to turn them off. &gt;&gt; Right. It shows that boy, ain't no power running through there somewhere. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. And she realized, boy, I can't move forward. Amen. Down here cuz it's dark. &gt;&gt; And and what brought the darkness was the disconnect. &gt;&gt; Come on, CHURCH. &gt;&gt; THE DISCONNECT [screaming] in this switch. &gt;&gt; But thank God, you know, she had A BROTHER WHO WATCHED SAY, "UH, don't fear little sister. There's a man that can turn on the light." &gt;&gt; Amen. See, I I I'M determined to walk in the light because he IS LIGHT &gt;&gt; IN HIM. AIN'T NO DARKNESS, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; AIN'T NO AIN'T NO HIGH BREATHING IN HERE. You know, it ain't that. &gt;&gt; IT'S IT'S IT'S ALL [screaming] LIGHT AND LIFE &gt;&gt; IN JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. IT'S IT'S ALL LIFE. SEE, this this this connection, right? Uh uh UH IT'S ALL LIFE AND LIGHT. Glory to God. Glory to God. It's it's no it's no it's no darkness, right? A lot of times people just refuse light to walk in darkness. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And and to me that don't make sense if if we're Christians, &gt;&gt; right? You know, when when we didn't know no better, it was it was it was kind of easier because you just didn't have the knowledge, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? SEE, BUT NOW THAT NOW THAT YOU KNOW, now that you know, IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT. &gt;&gt; SEE, IT IT'LL MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR ME TO, you know, WALK IN SOME OF THESE AREAS BECAUSE THE SWITCH HAS BEEN turned on &gt;&gt; AND I'M MOVING AROUND AND I'M MOVING AROUND in light. &gt;&gt; See? And like say don't go there. &gt;&gt; Light say don't go here. &gt;&gt; Light say you can't fellowship there. &gt;&gt; Right? Because because THE THE INFLUENCE INFLUENCE IS A REAL THING, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? and the people that you you come in contact with. You know, I've just never even before I had this understanding, I just never been the type of person that, you know, I walked in a group amongst a group of people and I just felt like, you know, everybody loves me and this and that. And it's like, man, I got my gods up. &gt;&gt; I always have my gods up. I do not put them down. &gt;&gt; I put my guards down one time. I'll never do it again. Brother Troy know what I'm talking about. Where in church now, when I was a young convert, I was a little gullible &gt;&gt; because I felt like certain things didn't happen around the message. &gt;&gt; Just the message. Just Yeah. But the devil is still a devil. He's still going to and fro seeking to whom he made THE VOW &gt;&gt; MALE, FEMALE, FAMILY, AND EVERYTHING ELSE. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. [snorts] &gt;&gt; All right. So, so from that time, you know, I turned right back on that switch. And from then on, it's like, man, if it walk like a duck, it quiet like a duck is a duck. &gt;&gt; I ain't playing with it. If I see what I see, I see what I see. &gt;&gt; AND I MAY NOT BOTHER THE PERSON, YOU KNOW, ABOUT WHAT I see. But I'm just, you know, I ain't I ain't going to close the blind like brother Brandham says. You know, people go in the basement AND REJECT TRUE CONNECTION. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. THEY'LL GO DOWN AND AND REFUSE THE WORD. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. Glory to God. Glory to God. This is THE ONLY THING THAT SATISFY. &gt;&gt; YES SIR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SEE THIS IS THIS IS WHY I WILL NEVER BECOME A PART of any of these sorority [screaming] type of things. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; WHY? BE BECAUSE ON THE FOUNDATION WHAT IS IT? RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AND AND IT MIGHT IT [screaming] MIGHT SEEM LIKE, YOU KNOW, IN SOME OF THESE INST AND YOU SEE THIS A LOT OF TIMES IN, you know, more of Methodists and Baptists and AM and, you know, uh where where you know they they got the Masons and and the you know the the Eastern Stars. Y'all have helped me preach and all of this kind of stuff. There's no way that I could get involved. You know, in in in um college, they they have all of this stuff, these sororities and all of that. At the core, those things are demon inspired. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, give me a scripture. Jesus to the Satan told Jesus, "If you bow down and worship me, man, I'll give you all of this." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Cuz everything, RIGHT, EVEN THE DAUGHTERS, EVERYTHING IS INSPIRED BY THE DEVIL. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; THAT'S OUTSIDE OF AMEN. THE WORD. &gt;&gt; TRUE. &gt;&gt; Satan controls, RIGHT? THAT'S WHY WE GOT TO PROTECT OUR MINDS, &gt;&gt; PROTECT OUR THOUGHTS, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? HAVE, YOU KNOW, THE PROPHET TAUGHT US, YOU GOT TO HAVE THE RIGHT APPROACH TO THINGS. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. YOU, you can't approach things just kind of halfhazardly, &gt;&gt; right? Because like we say, you know, uh uh in our our connections like the Queen of Sheba, right? You know, she she had to have a settling in her spirit. This is the right place. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I I'll make a broader statement. WHEN I FIRST GOT uh converted to uh the message, right, we was in another group amongst another group of people, right? And it was just something that was not settling in my spirit. &gt;&gt; I KNEW THAT THE WORD THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT I FELT LIKE AND I DIDN'T HAVE THE UNDERSTANDING, BUT I IN MY HEART I KNEW THAT THE WORD WAS RIGHT. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. BUT EVERYTHING ELSE I COULDN'T PUT TOGETHER, RIGHT? AND AND THE FOLKS THAT WAS AROUND ME JUMPING AND SHOUTING AND SCREAMING, THEY COULDN'T HELP ME CUZ THEY COULDN'T ANSWER THE QUESTIONS NEITHER. &gt;&gt; Y'all don't preach. &gt;&gt; Huh? Sh, brother. &gt;&gt; Really, man? I I need something, you know, and and and see from my PERSPECTIVE AND WHERE I CAME FROM, I didn't want to go back. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. SO SO THERE WAS A HUNGER. THERE WAS A hunger for for true connection. &gt;&gt; Right. And eventually, you know, I I changed churches, &gt;&gt; right? because I was more I was more satisfied at the time. But even in that, &gt;&gt; we were still being hoodwanked. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; BE BECAUSE YOU don't think brother Jack was using it. You got to know them that labor amongst you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; See, CUZ YOU COULD COME IN AND TAKE ON A SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.

WE WERE GULLIBLE. &gt;&gt; WE were susceptible to anything &gt;&gt; and the man were playing games with us &gt;&gt; all in the name of reading quotes and all of that.

At I'll take it a little further. At 25, I didn't I didn't know how to navigate. &gt;&gt; Right. I'll take it further. In my 30s and 40s, &gt;&gt; right?

I didn't really know how to approach connections. But but you know in this season I realize in anything that I'm involved in it's got to be 100% Bible. It's got to be biblically based. It it it cannot be, [music] you know, just something and, you know, some club and and different things going on around and, you know, alcohol and secularisms and cuz I'm a Christian and and I can't walk with that, you know. I I I can't even begin to reason that. But Lord, I I I've come to this conclusion based upon scripture, the word, and what I see in the word. I just want to be uh a partaker of the word. I want my fellowship to be wordbased. Lord, I thank you this morning. We just want to pray for the saints. pray their uh traveling mercies, Lord, as you know, they wind up their services and prepare to make their way back homes, [music] Lord.

He don't want [music] you to know who you are. When he came to Eve in the beginning, he said, "You'll be like God." And she already [music] knew that she was already like God. But he wants to get you out of a place. You are a son and daughter of God. You [music] must know who you are. He came to Jesus if thou be [music] always. He want to make you question who you are. But God said, "You are my sons and daughters. You are Christians. Wherever you go, you are a Christian. Don't let Satan get [music] you off that. Stand on that word. Every relationship is the word." Amen. I'm so grateful Brother Willie said what he said. God only made one brother Willie. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's the best brother Willie I ever seen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing this little song together [music] and trust as we sing this, you'll realize the connection that we have is something precious in the sight of God. Every need be supplied.

Father, it's a word that we all need, [music] Father. Whether it's in relationship or if it's in business, Lord, or whatever it may be, we need to make the right connections. [music] Father, we can all agree that we made the right connections, Lord, being a part, Lord, [music] of this brother and sisterhood that we have here at Spirit and Truth Tabernacle. Lord, Father, we come from so many different [music] places, being led of the spirit, Lord, that we may sojourn together. And father, I pray for my brothers and my sisters, Lord, [music] that you would be with each one, that you'll continue to direct their minds and their hearts, Lord, as we continue to try and navigate, Lord, while we're souljouring here in this earth, Lord. Father, this is the greatest hour, Lord. It's the hour that [music] your coming is in, Lord. And I'm so grateful, Lord, to be standing with brothers and sisters of like, precious faith that believe and trust you. So, Father, we just ask almighty God that you'll grant to us more revelation, Lord, more wisdom and understanding. [music] Enlarge our minds and our hearts that we can know you more perfectly, Lord God, to believe you for the impossible. [music] Father, like brother Willie said, we want our minds transformed, Lord Jesus. [music] If we knew back then what we knew now, Lord God, how much further down the road we would be. Father, we want to help this next generation, Lord, [music] to go to higher heights and deeper depths in you, Lord. Father, to be able to [music] live in the upper springs and the Nether Springs, have them both, Lord Jesus, while in this life. So, Father, [music] we pray your blessings upon your people. We pray for Brother Willie, Lord, all that he put out, Lord. God, may you strengthen our brother, restore, Lord, his strength, Lord. And Father, just bless [music] him in every aspect of his life, Lord. May you grant him his heart, his eye, and meet every need, Lord, along with this [music] congregation, Father. There are many of us that could not make it, Lord, for whatever reason, Lord, [music] we pray. Be with our brothers and sisters where they are, Lord. No doubt their hearts are [music] with us, Lord, and they enjoyed the service as well. Father, be with us all as we go to our respective homes. bring us all back at the appointed time. Bless our [music] brothers and sisters in Australia as they travel back again, Lord. Keep them safe and out of harm's way, oh Father, and bless them, Lord, for every effort that they put into the service. Bless our brothers and sisters with brother Lee and Gian Tabernacle that hosted them, Lord. Everything that they put out, Lord God, may you restore. We love you, Father. Thank you for being God. We commit all things to you now in Jesus Christ's precious and holy name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. You may have your seats and our brothers will come [music] dismiss you at this time. God bless you. [music] [music] Heat. [music] Heat. &gt;&gt; [music]
