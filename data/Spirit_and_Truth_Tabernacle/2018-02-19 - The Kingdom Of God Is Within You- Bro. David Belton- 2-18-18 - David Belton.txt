praise blessed I read in your words in the name of Jesus Christ we pray and we thank you amen they may not have you standing too long let us go right into the word of the Lord in amen the Book of Luke 16 Luke 16 Luke 16 beginning at verse 16 Luke 16 and then Luke 17 Luke 16 it says verse 16 the law and the prophets were until John since that time the kingdom of God is preached and every man presses into it they meant at the seventeenth chapter verse 20 and when he was demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come he answered them and said the kingdom of God cometh not with observation neither shall they say lo here or lo there for behold the kingdom of God is within you and he said under disciples the days will come when you said his are to see one of the days of the Son of Man and you should not see it and they should say to you see here or see there go not after them nor follow them for a lightning that shine it out of the one part under heaven China than to the other part under heaven so she also the Son of Man be in his day but first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this generation and as it was in the days of Noah so it certainly be also in the days of the son of man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered in it all and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thou shall it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed a man made a lot of the blessing today remember his words you may be seated amen so we are we have a subject here I don't I don't think I ever preached this here but it's a subject the kingdom of God is within you the kingdom of God is within you amen and we see as as Luke tells us here the law and the prophets weren't to John from that time the kingdom of God is preached and every man presses into it it is it don't come easy it is not on a silver platter it's not with a silver spoon but there's a press you got in other words you have to be diligent you have to be persistent amen you a minister even the Prophet went beyond the time things are told him pressed Avada keep on pressing hallelujah and then they begin to tell us whatever you do get perfect of no one will enter without it and we know that perfect love faith worketh by love you know we were sharing back home of few subjects perfect relationship and perfect fellowship perfect faith perfect love we share in perfection and we see that we're in the age of perfection we're an age where every seed is bringing forth of his kind we're in our age where is time up for anything that's fake amen it's time to be real many play church many claim to be Christians but God is looking at the heart and their life amen it must be a manifested life and that hidden life must be in Christ now here as we see they demanded unto the Lord Jesus Christ when the kingdom of God shall come and he began to tell them the kingdom of God cometh not with observation in other words is not an outlet chill Amen praise the Lord in other words it is no output out with manifestation it's not revealed to the public praise the Lord his hidden head man oh praise the Living God it reminds me of Sam you first said that the Bible said in daisa Sam Nia there was no open vision right it was not revealed to the public but now we see we must understand this reason now now now keep in mind about was that without a vision the people perish now in other words without a redemptive revelation or without a prophetic message to people perish and that word perish it means also means they run Wow it also means they are naked so without or a dipped of Revelation the people run Wow they are naked that's the Word of God they are wandering the Bible say a wandering spirit is like one that worship among the dead you know that's what the Bible said but Jesus come to tell you then you'll say lo here or lo there lo he's in the mountain you know sunset sunset mountain go to sunset to get this he said it they say he's in the mountain believe it not they say well he's in the desert oh you got to go to Sabino Canyon I'm not criticising we being real here he's a go not there then I said when he's in a secret chamber go to greens a meal the secret chamber no he's not there well go to the grave Jefferson beer but he's not there hey man where is he the kingdom of God is within you burn man praise the Living God that's what is all about the prophets and my ministers to declare that he's here who Christ is here and Christ is the theme of the whole ba ba the principal theme hey man I'm afraid they're getting two people to church but not to Christ but we must be in Christ so where we get them to the message but together to get them to Christ the messages show that you can read but Christ was being you amen not just learning about him amen amen I hope you okay now now I believe the message with all my heart Mimi said it believing that we're there today mini run they run well we're there today but you have to make sure you know where crises we go around saying I have to ah the devas answer well what's this costing you ever thought of that what's this question so I'll help the devil's out the boys his question his question is where's Christ see Satan is looking for Christ - and you know whether you have Christ but he always trying to tell you that you don't have it but if you realize and know you don't have him you got to get amen praise the Lord so let us you know is so much to say but I want to say this you know we were we were doing a subject on relationship in fellowship that's a very good subject because it's not only show your relationship with Christ but even a spouse your relationship to toward each other s family your relationship toward your family on your job we're in every relationship once you get that first one right first the kingdom of God and His righteousness had to bring everything else in order he had to put him first seek ye first the kingdom of God and the kingdom of God the Bible said is not meat and drink but it's righteousness is joy its peace in the Holy Ghost so the kingdom of God is righteousness joy and peace in the Holy Ghost hey man are you happy do you have peace hey man do you have joy hallelujah do you have righteousness is the Russians of God by the shed blood of Jesus Christ hey man that's what the kingdom of God is I don't believe in people saying they're Christians and they walk around sad you know I wrote down some things here I'll say I appreciate for the West go anytime I called him how are you brother too blessed to be stressed too anointed to be disappointed too victorious to be defeated he's a to heal to heal to be sick you know so I want to add to that I saw when I add to that I got it some win here God elected and God protected amen praise the Lord - glad to be sad - happy to be snappy amen - rich to be poor amen the praises go up the blessings come down hey man we got to create that atmosphere that's broader language I said that's language for the bride man we should never be disappointed or depressed you know what I'm saying we should never be depressed they give them some go to getting medicine for depression you know the medicine is proven that it makes them more depressed if they get worse and worse and worse but the Bible said arise shine that light is come and the glow of God is little upon you Hyman arise out of depression a rather than a sadness ain't Christ is here to give you life hey man that's what time it is is broad time right now we're in ever-present water from the rock you believe that praise the Lord hey man you know some people think every family is the waltons family but the jetsons family I think they got one called a fabulous four is that a family - I don't know I don't know it's all kind of things The Brady Bunch Little House on the Prairie The Cosby family all those families some want a pattern after those families I hope none no para pattern after the Addams Family you know I'm going way back because my daddy didn't let us watch too much television growing up but we in God's family by one Spirit we are baptized in that body you know so we have to create the right atmosphere you know um you ask people sometime and these worldly people say in this well how are you doing today they said another day in paradise now they say if it is a holiday every meal is a feasts how you feeling they say feel any better I couldn't stand it these people that don't claim to be Christians are saying these things I want to show something some say it's good to be alive but we can say I added some more brother Jack I have too much love to have any hate I have too much peace to augur God as a Naga neither does his children amen I have too much forgiveness to have ups I have too much joy to be bored see that's how Christians should Leah it's a life once you recognize if you haven't recognized the kingdom of God is within you head man oh praise the Living God let's look at this kingdom amen are you glad I'm glad to be a part of crisis a part of him before the foundation of the world you know uh you know as the Prophet taught us he so we are now worshiping under the Feast of Tabernacles and we will get in a nap that after a while because we remember the woman when Jesus went to the woman at the well that's his turn now let's read some you are telling either God want to show you what we had we're in the seventh age where we are worshipping under the feast of tabernacle no we will finish it up in the Millennium but now we're worshipping now under the Feast of Tabernacles we should be in worship I love the worship in the singing worship is not just sing you know worship to God is really a life a dedicated life to Him and and they said the word worship is the greatest function it's the greatest function that any creature can perform the greatest function that any creature not just us but any creature that animals have their way of worship amen hallelujah [Applause] talking about bhakti amen a restoring has begun amen first Joan excuse me Saint John for st. John for let's just start at verse 21 Jesus hasn't had a woman believe it's me now I will cometh when we should neither ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the father ye worship you know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews but they are cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth that's what we're trying to say the kingdom of God is within you now now remember Israel made their greatest mistake because they what they chose law over grace he chose law for grace that's the worst mistake that they had made but here we as a people for what God has given us we should be on fire for God that's what we see I'm on fire there's a farm you know Jeremiah said a water Lord is like fire shut up in my bones you should never let the spirit revived or die hey man you should always be revived praise the Lord it should never be a dull moment because of what Christ has done Amen I'm not here to rebuke you anything like that but I'm speaking as a whole as we move on together are you happy we can move on together in Christ because we have a greater witness we have a greater cloud of witnesses all those Saints are waiting on us they're waiting on us because why they without us cannot be made perfect so we must come to it we shall come to it our full recognition in Christ knowing who you are nor what we have amen and see what it is that the devil don't want you to see and if you see it praise the Lord as the Bible said happy are you because we must move on what what are we saying God here by the preaching of the gospel he's building a powerhouse you as an individual he's building a powerhouse you as an individual walking the Prophet said my ministry is to build the individual so you as an individual one of you becoming a walking powerhouse why because in you you're possessing the kingdom of God amen so ever all you go you should have big Terry hey man hey man we're talking about our God on the scene now he's really a man you believe that you know Paul said I haven't happened it yet but one thing I do and forgetting all the negative things all the things that are behind because I see the vision and I'm pressing toward the mom a man when you see it you got you got to make haste praise the Lord now man I just love to celebrate Jesus Christ don't you we have a celebration time you know we always talk about Ezra Nehemiah Ezra was a man of heart near mom was a man of action on a man of Prayer he always gave God the glory there was at a time that then they was at a time of the Feast of Tabernacles they were worshipping under that feast they went around and told them it is not time to be sad why are you weeping it's time to rejoice and our Lord says a holy convocation heydman we're next day praise the Lord that's what he was saying Alleluia so they took the lemonade they took the lamb and he took wine and he they think they ate wine and drink wine and and serve the lamb that's what we're doing evening we're eating the lamb the revealed word we're drinking the wine the stimulation from the revelation of the word what are we doing we're celebrating Jesus why because we are free hallelujah are you free this morning you know I want to tell you something the devil is more afraid of you than what you realize because say he's he's afraid of that blood and that word I said that Deborah is afraid of you that word in that blood but he's he's always trying to make you be afraid but I want to tell you as often said the devil is on probation tell your neighbor I'm gonna tell you why he's limited he have power but he's limited why because he committed a crime a serious crime ittan started here he came against Michael in heaven he wanted a better Kingdom he thought he could have a better Kingdom he said I will sit in the sides of the north I will be worshipped as God it was the I will I will I will but he was brought down but Christ in the garden he said father not my will but thy will hallelujah why because he knew he possessed the kingdom of God hallelujah amen when you recognize who you are it a humble you he was humble even obedient to the death of the Cross because why he knew what power we had he could have called 12 leaders that more than trouble easily anger then changed the whole scene but he knew what he came to do o praise the Living God what do we see what do we see let's move on now here we know there are two powers to powers in the whole universe the power of God and the power of the devil they're cooked two kingdoms the power of God the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the devil and we see Lucifer was once in heaven the light bringer but he was cast at Earth so his name was changed from Lucifer to Satan you know you don't like that name cuz Satan shows his defeat it changed him from from the bringer of light unto the father of darkness oh what a mighty God we serve I'm glad to be on the winter side I'm glad to be on the water side so here Satan is limited back in the day when he committed certain crimes and we're on probation they use what they call a leavin worth as a prison ball-and-chain made of cast iron they drug it around everywhere is about 18 pounds today they have an ankle bracelet bracelet whatever it is I don't know all I know he it makes him limited he can only go certain places hello yeah and I want to tell you safety cannot do anything to you unless God allowed Satan is limited by men but God is unlimited and God haha amen that's what he want he wants you the inner there huh boss faith there's enough power when you already you know that as a born-again believer there's enough power in you to create a heaven and earth you know yeah look at this it's not just it's not just brothers it's not just preachers it's every son and daughter of God God want to make each and every one of you know Superman or superwoman of super Tao that's the Word of God that's what Christ came to do that's why he's hid this message why one is already going on the Prophet is already raised up he was a Superman among people anyway with God gave him victory and brother Jack greater than this old Clark Kent that was just a perversion we know Jesus wanted us to Pat enough to him why we are little massage ads praise the Lord you know God wanted to be now don't don't look down the road you know what's deceiving a lot of people they fail to call Jesus Christ on the scene right now the Lord Jesus told them he said the kingdom of God is nigh unto thee they didn't understand him so you as an individual he was recognized where is the kingdom you know the kingdom of God is potentially here now we're in the hearts of the Saints praise the Lord hey man oh he's so mighty he's the mighty God I'm trying to get some notes if at all I don't know where to go here I'm just trusting or there's just so much but just so much coming at one time so much coming so pray for me they made an enemy he don't like these areas but we love Him because this is building us from faith to faith from glory to glory amen from grace to grace by the Spirit of the Living God he said it's not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord so God is is bringing us to where we need to be praise the Lord and see why because God is raising up our army we sung the song I believe we sung the song God is raising up a mighty army to destroy the works of Satan Haman you believe that I'm one of them are you one of them I said God is raising up a mighty army hey man that's what he's doing right now by the preaching of the gospel I'm glad I got an army in due time aren't you I'm glad I'm a marching Houma Christian soldier a soldier the cross even I just want to lift up the Lord Jesus Christ I just want to brag on him that's what I want to do this brag on him because we we are we are coming to our recognition knowing who we are you know I was reminded of uh you know you say we always have to create the right atmosphere I'm reminded of one time there was a visitor came in a service they had a foot disease for about six months radda nning of the of defeat and he came in his service center came in a service for the first time sit down that day he walked out healed the foot disease left hey man later we went over there hop home and about 25 of us and prayed and applied the blood to that home request it from his parents he was 27 we joined together we we applied the blood we read Exodus 12 and we applied the blood to that home actually this happened before he was healed and he came and testified and said he was in his room when we were praying for him he joined the circuit prayed with his parents he came and testified he said demons start leaving him as we were praying and then he he he wrote different poetry and poems poems and he denounced Islam I said what a mighty God we serve hey man they meant praise the Lord one sister came in service with a cyst on her hand not the size of a nickel you see it already do it the two darkness first one doctor in a specialist station we got to do surgery so she didn't want surgery she came to service and she said doing it medicine had a word she said she looked in her hand it was gone she said disappeared and she told her her husband a man prays alone that same sister walked in service with a cane two different times because I'd asked about that then she told me what happened with the cane way anyway a voice spoke to her and said you don't need that cane she threw the cane away praise the Lord God is able you been the kingdom of God is within you Amen I believe that you know we want it it should be where at all time so we've been living on our privilege too long if it's not for anyone else I'm may be saying it for me maybe one preach it to myself but you understand me we're talking about a bride that's moving on we're talking about claiming all of our rights you know see the enemy he he don't want you to come to your position but see we have to come to like Enoch as I've said I have an opportunity yeah but I'm pressing Enoch had a testimony the Bible said before his translation so you got to get it on this side adoption on this side now I'm not talking about the adoption of your body in in Romans 8 but we're talking talking about it seasons you been adopted it's coming to your place your position on this side you doing the greater works on this side hey man praise the Lord you coming the resting you decide recognizing your data's message recognizing who you are recognizing you kanuda greater works recognizing what silver you say rest in ours and what system is a part is impossible in the youth right is right not just with God all things are possible but God put it back on you with you nothing should be impossible that's the barbary man why because the kingdom of God is within you hold man so you don't have to be afraid take the Word of God and use it home and drive it in our heart of the enemy but this kind of faith worketh by love and this kind of faith the foundation of it is forgiveness you can't have any arms see not we're not talking about a fate see sinners have a fate they'll come in and be healed and go out and live they kind of life and never come to Christ so they have a fate but we're not talking about a faith we're talking about perfect faith what's perfect faith you think it's some for fence somewhere but perfect faith is pressing God praying and asking God to do something for you and going away but even if he's will work it out that's perfect faith you mean is that simple that's perfect faith praise the Lord amen so what do we see what do we see I want to stir up your pure Minds by where amendments you know how I have my watch here because I don't see I can't see that he always the latest gadget and he screws me on a lot of lot of those electronic gadgets because we need them I have I have a lot of different gadgets myself and don't know how to use him like him mine just yeah but anyway praise the Lord I said man you older than me but I'm always good you not gonna praise the Lord but you know I said here we must recognize the supernatural it's right among us we have to what are you saying taking God at His Word he said the angels of God and camp around them that fear Him what do you mean they pitch a tent they camp out where will you go angels of God camp out around you hey man my mother ought to make a lutheran child hey man my mama you have so much Authority more than the angels of God in his presence you have more authority as a sinner saved by grace you as a son and daughter of God have more authority my remember now is really the greatest mistake they made they chose law over grace God was to make them a kingdom of priests a Kingdom priests but according to revelation 1 in 6 and revelation 5 and 10 I've made you unto those unto God by the blood I've made you kings and priests that word Kings mean Kingdom priests I've made your kingdom a priest according to 1st Peter 2 and a royal priesthood a holy priesthood or all priesthood that's what God is doing why because of the shed blood of Jesus Christ because of the perfect sacrifice he made us kings and priests because of the precious shed blood of Jesus Christ now his life can come back and live in the believer why is the kingdom hallelujah h-him the kingdom crossing you hallelujah it just does something it brings a certain character and remember character is what I can't hear you it's a victory it's not a gift it's a victim and recognizing what you're possessing knowing what you're possessing and not only knowing what you possess and moving in action putting it in action it's got to be faith in action show me your works faith without your works and I will show you my faith by my works because faith without works is dead but what's its faith Express hey man praise the Living God in and that's what God is calling us to I'm pressing toward the mark hey man are you pressing toward the mark you got the press every battle it's not easy but to get the press every battle saying this regime but you got to press every batter because while Satan is defeated I said that there was already conquered heaven we have victory you know I'm not the argue with Satan he's already defeated praise the Living God amen with you and we the powers already here the power of God is here but what we need faith to operate the power because we need power to operate the gifts that are in us but we need faith to operate the power and we wisdom how to use this power and authority what are you saying - remember me Elijah Elijah they criticized him they called him ball head What did he say what did he do he cursed the 42 children and he calls to she-bears to go and kill them he had power he had authority but he used it wrong he used that anger when Jesus was rejected in Nazareth John and James said let us call on far from heaven like a lodging and destroy them up Jesus here you know you don't know what's appearing here so once you recognize what's what you have in you what you're packing hallelujah you're packing the kingdom of God hey man you have to pack up a pistol hey man you have something greater than a pistol just a man hey man oh praise the Living God I tell you Satan kingdom is coming down brother I should say that Satan Kingdom is coming down I mean tell your neighbor Satan Kingdom is coming down amen what the song said sit on we're gonna tell you Kingdom down oh say are we gonna tell you Kingdom down you've been builded your kingdom all over this land sit on we're gonna tell you kingdom down hey man he's trimming you know he's trimming right the Bible said Satan he trembles he believes though but he trimmers why why does he trouble you look that word up it means he's afraid I'm telling you he's afraid of you saints of God oh praise the Lord walk in power walk with assurance lift up your head that hang down Oh recognize who you are that you have a kingdom hey man you know got what was happening or his 14 has begun that's what has happened amen heaven and earth have kissed God and man has been reconciled I'm holding future home amen God and man has been reconciled oh praise the Living God so God has sent his anointing he sent this he has sin for the spirit of adoption why to bring us to adoption praise the Lord so the anointing is not emotions the anointing is supreme power in control knowing exactly what and how that's what's here don't look for that the road is here now he's the ever-present water from the rock there's enough power as a born-again Christian there's enough power in you to creators to create words but there's a law of faith oh praise the heart oh if Einstein will ahead of spirituali keishon of what he had in the natural he could have told us something he saw that power out there he said you're tapping in the center you could create Earth's he tapped into a power he met on a blackboard he's a man Einstein theory hallelujah oh it's so powerful equals MC squared what is it energy God God is energy they call it energy it's God he see is light oh the light is here M is matter but what God is doing the light Christ our theophany has come not theophanies here with us you believe that he saw the world with you and shall be in you is so much happening why the world is going on into sin deeper and deeper notice the daisen or they were married they were given in marry they were living it up building planting living it up but no actually was a type the tribulation Saints going over but before nor there was Xena right lot was that board a time believer but before that there was Abraham so she ever be in this day because the sauna man has been revealed through a prophet God's high as order but now the son of man is being revealed to the individuals by the same Holy Ghost you believe that that's the Word of God I'm moving fast moving fast we got to claim our nail of the rights that's what time it is why because we we receiving an eternal Kingdom because everything this earth or perish you know they are thought about something I said they have all these things see we're going to a faith civilization but it starts here in the heart see for God so loved the world what would this world know for God so loved the world the world of the ungodly the world before the fall that's the word that he was in love with why would he tell us to love not this world and he loved it he understand me hey men I said why would he tell us to love this world and he don't love it he said I prayed not for the world remember st. John 17 but he said I pray for you mighty glad Jesus pray for you he pray for you that you become one with him amen he prayed for your oneness he pray for your fellowship head man has what he prayed for in Saint John 17 I'll pray not for the world but I'll pray for my the thighs giving me that I in the world you in the world but not of the world for love not the world none of the things of the world always in the world less that I lust of the flesh the proud of life he loves the world the love of the father's not in him he overcame those things in all points he was tempted right he was tipping in all points what points lusted I lust of the flesh pride of life dipped in all points yet without sin but he took on sin for you and I just like Adam who knew no sin but Adam took on sin but Adam soul loved his wife and for Jesus Christ so loved his wife hey men are you Brad I'll call you no more church but I call you bride amen and this and here come down from heaven as a bride adorned for her husband and a Baba said the bride the Lambs life aren't you glad you're the Lambs life his wife has made herself ready to her was granted granted as he may be a pro than fine linen and the fine linen is the righteousness of sites so the Holy Ghost the kingdom of God is is the righteousness joy and peace you know Paula said his joy unspeakable Peter says joy unspeakable full of glory this fifty said his peace pass finding out oh praise the Living God what a mighty God we serve oh joy righteousness peace not on righteousness but the righteousness of of God which is by faith for Abraham sought it not by whoops but it was by faith and it was counted on him for righteousness I'm so glad a you a seed or Abraham are you glad to be a seed of Abraham I'm glad to be a seed of Abraham but Abraham call those things that were not as though they were and what happened God tore him to walked out before me and be thou perfect he was gonna make him perfect airshed I was on the scene oh-ho-ho God Jesus it'd be all so perfect even your heavenly Father is perfect what do you come to do he come to make you perfect is it Wow how can it be perfect means mature it means full grown it means complete in the days that of us in a separate area when he shall begin the sound it should be complete they miss you God should be finished it will be complete we are complete in who in Christ all praise the Lord what is it the seven spirits of God what is the completion oh is all over the baba winners last age win a age where the bride is recognizing her king and her kingdom because you're the queen remember revelation 10 is for the Jews but Christ stopped in to get his bride the car is clean that is sad hey man oh I'm so glad my mama of greater than Esther's here upgraded and Ruth is here are graded and Sarah is here or greater than Rebecca's here is the bride of Jesus Christ is mrs. grace his mrs. Jesus Christ lady hey man I'm so glad a man I know who I am I'm thankful for the grace of God it's not a boast in myself but I'll give God the praise for giving me the recognition showing me who I am it may show me that I'll have to take junk off the devil show me that I can claim my addicted rights hey man oh praise the Lord you ought to claim your rights you shouldn't be a feeble one among us I'm telling you it shouldn't be a fever one among us if God under the sacrifice of booze and goats on it alone could cause them to walk 40 years and it was not a people on among them what about now what about now even for God call one of his Saints home did she go home healed you understand me that's how it should be you believe that that's how it should be now praise the Lord because because we're talking about an atmosphere that God want us to create and to live in you know you know that's why the scripture said make a joyful noise unto the Lord all you lands serve the Lord with gladness don't don't don't let the pastor after plead with you to come to church we not getting mentioned prayer service that's a that's an unpopular service sometimes a Cray only my wife and I be there brother Charles Anderson he's a former pastor but we will have prayer one time I think they had about 20 people there but most the time we had about 10 of us so it's unpoppable something we needed more and more together together together even a more as we see the Day approaching you talking about a powerhouse a church coming together in prayer look what happened in the book of Acts we said where the book of Acts now it features first of all now this message is producing another Ephesians right if heathens had church for two days solid everyday search the Scriptures for two days saw that every day they had Church in fellowship my momma you know when we first come in we fellowship every day we were digging in that scripture a man you're amending in it in the eighties and nineties in it every day we were we worked at everything else but yet we had time to fellowship we it's like we wasn't him tired right then we go into home two and three o'clock let him tired now in the world now they're going club all not have to be to work seven o'clock in the club the six o'clock in the world and go out on the work now when you create that kind of atmosphere God comes in he inhabited in their praises of his people so make a joyful noise unto the Lord all ye lands serve God with gladness come before his presence with singing see so he's serving with gladness you know there's a curse not a certain with gladness according to Deuteronomy Deuteronomy 28 but if you serve Him with gladness he says blessings were overtakes you [Music] don't you want his blessings to overtake you I want his blessings to overtake me you know it's the Prophet taught us the greatest thing you can say to someone and all the human diet is what God bless you do you really know what you say it means you tell someone that now you're blessed the Bible said you're highly favored you're fortunate to be ended that's what blessing means to be invented the devil envy you because you're blessed now I said I want to dig in it as work bless even more it means having a sacred nature blessed it means connect it with God blessed it means very welcome present or appreciated aren't you glad when God appreciate you don't you want God to appreciate you hey man ah bless it means held in reverence it means honor in worship don't you want God to honor your worship the songs you sing and then the prayers you pray don't you want God to honor it bless it mean bringing pleasure it means enjoying happiness are you enjoying happiness you notice how to put on you happy yes you know I'm not trying to clown but you know what I'm saying people say they're happy and they're not happy but this is real God wants you to be happy he want to see about you come now let us reason together let's let us talk things over whatever it is if if there's unconfessed sins or whatever it is let's talk things over cuz I want you to have this that's what he that's what he tell us though your sins be as scarlet I'll make them white as snow though they be red like crimson I'll make them white like war that's the Word of God it's all you have to do come let's talk about it let's talk things over God understands God wants you to enjoy life even though his loving-kindness is better than this life but God wants you to enjoy this life praise the Lord it's so much that God is having store for us and want us to have and you know some have power you know in Luke 22:24 he gave them power to cast out unclean spirits and that word powers exuse you which means authority got some scholars in here got some students that a word but it didn't stop there because some were casting out Devils didn't even follow him they didn't mean they possessed the kingdom of God now Luke 24:00 Luke 10 was the power he gave them there but Luke 24 after the Holy Ghost is come upon you you see receive the promise of my father from on high and x1 and eight that power is Dunamis that's the Holy Ghost that's different in Luke 10 so many have politic s that unclean spirits exuse you but they don't have Dunamis that's the power within you see the kingdom of God is within you once there's a healing of the soul you could not be lost no more than God Himself could be lost because keep in mind it's like potentially once the German the egg meets in the fellow below fallopian tube the pregnant takes place potentially potentially the baby is present here but not born and by the holy ghost we are pregnant by God's Spirit but we must grow thereby didn't you have this power a coordinator fees is 121 which means which the Greek word on that is Kratos which means Dominion a king hath dominion Dominion is what a kingdom so God want us to have all three of those powers power and authority the Holy Ghost virtue power for service and power Dominion we're talking about you knowing knowing what you really have knowing that their leaders are angels to protect you minutes and spirits sent forth to assist you to deliver you God have angels haters angels of deliverance angels of healing different ages we look at angels s Michael the Archangel and Gabriel and wormwood who Gaber who God used for Israel wormwood who who was their new and eluvian agent controlled the waters but then what about and then Michael is Christ in angelic realm you notice that because you know Satan he didn't go the Gaber he didn't go to wormwood he went to Moses disputing Michael disputing of Moses body thank you the Archangel but God help different angels so what are you saying you got to look into the unseen around we know there's a heavenly kingdom there's coming on out of heaven the New Jerusalem but what we're sharing is for you to see this other Kingdom because their meat we receive a kingdom an eternal king who is the eternal word who has eternal life by his eternal word to his eternal people who has eternal life and partakers of this the Bible said in in first Timothy 1:17 the king eternal he's the king eternal jesus said my kingdom is not from here if this was my kingdom I will allow my service to fight and I will fight but my kingdom is not from here we have a kingdom that cannot be removed amen that's why he started in you Christ in you the hope of glory that's the kingdom that'll never be moved I'm so glad to be a part of that Kingdom aren't you praise the Lord Amen I'm coming down to the end here coming down to the end amen I have I have some few things here you know one thing about the Lord he don't change he never changes did you know this civilization changes they went from walking the horse and buggy to automobile to airplane now they have gems but it's only a type of what's in the spirit and and I was thinking I said you notice they may whom and already prophesy of the car amen and one of the prophets prophesy of the airplane I said they have mechanical chariots and horses the autumn will be an airplane mechanical but God had already designed the bird they just they just copied everything and made it mechanical and then they got in electronics and they begin to not we got what we call wireless but we can't live in all of that we have to look to the invisible God because that while it's gonna fail when that wild as you can go on area and have no connection right but with God you can always have a connection a man here never faded some people switched from Horizon to AT&T Straight Talk and all these others back and forward and they still missing calls and missing sickness and missing connections but once you connect it with him hey man only sinking separate you but he wants you to stay connected and once you're connected with him you become a Superman or superwoman a super child why because in you dressed the powers of heaven and earth in other words heaven and earth is backing you up mine I tell you what it is a joy being a Christian God has sent so much word in the US revealed by prophet to show us who we are and you know they have television or television now now television it is it's what the devil has has put on it it could have been used for a great purpose of God so not against television but it's what they got on it all the field is so much field but I'm glad for that other vision God told Moses visions he told Paul visions he told all his prophet visions and all this is written by vision amen the full Word of God you have all these things I could go on and on and on live let me just a narrow down I thought about today even the robots I went in Sam's Club a few weeks ago I don't like well my I apologize but I don't the customer service is poor very poor man he found a copy Costco but it's very poor but I went in there and I seen about 18 registers or 12 of them were self checkout and only two people with there with about 20 customers that's terrible I apologize they replace in humans and robots and then now they're doing you know they did darling you remember dolly they won't they want to try to bypass god they're trying to bring these animals that can avoid death can't avoid death that way is only one way to heart death hey man he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live because he that believeth liveth and believeth in me shall never die that's the only way to avoid death amen Christian's don't die they go to sleep amen the Lord Himself said is sin from heaven with a shout a message amen and the voice of an archangel the dead in Christ shall rise first and we were to live and remain to be caught up to meet him in here the Bible said they which are sleep will God bring with him Amen O Lord Oh y'all trouble not the master she's dead trouble not the master jesus said let's go wake her well Lord if she if she sleeping she do it well then he had to speak their language she's dead but let's go wake her so he that liveth him and leave her than me shall never die though he were dead yet shall he live you know we're looking you know you go back thirty years you know just about everybody was around you go back twenty years some of our loved ones is going on you go back ten years we begin to miss a lot of our loved ones who has set an example and as going on but you know what we'll see them again we will see them again why because they were part of their they are a part of this kingdom and I'm glad to be a part of this kingdom a man I'm so glad so glad I'm yours alone so glad your mercy has found me so the POW was here is all in Christ is all in Christ as much as your faith will be released that's how much power you can have what are you saying I'm really narrowing down give me about ten minutes as much as your faith will be released that's how much power you can have because in you dwells the power to make heaven and earth God within you and your sons and daughters of God do you believe that according to your faith be it unto you if thou canst believe all things are possible that's what he wants you to live in that omnipotence power that's exactly what he want you to live in and you can't there's no way to be a person said I've talked to a minister 30 years among the message he see never had a supernatural experience with God now there's no way you can be in contact with God and not have a supernatural experience there's something wrong there's something wrong because it does something to you it changes you from the inside out hey man Jeremiah said is like fire shut up in my bones I cannot hold my peace you recognize who you are amen you glad he called you the bombers you blessed because he called you that he chosen you so those who he called his justified he calls you before the foundation the war those who he called he justified those he justified he had already glorified you believe that the same God before the foundation of the world calls your name wrote it in the Lamb's Book alive from the foundation of the world he has already made a place in glory for you it was this earth a new Tabernacle be dissolved this earthly house see the tabernacle of God is with men the kingdom of God is within you that's what the Lord Jesus was saying he could have he could have say that the tabernacle of God is with you because why your body is a temple of the Holy Ghost so while you're worried about what are you going along looking sad for lift up your heads the fever need let the hands raise up that once hung down let it let them this week say I'm strong that means let the weak say I'm a warrior not only Christ was slain to take away sin but your name was written in the Lamb's of the life before the foundation a Torah God wrote your name associated with his before the foundation of the world now Satan make you get scared or try to get you to doubt but before the war ever begun God called your name you Christians are you glad to be one of them I'm glad to be one of them and we are enjoying the blessings and resting and waiting upon the coming of the Lord waiting for it I'm waiting I'm looking I'm trusting because why I know that it won't be long so you as an individual is not what you had done 10 years ago or an experience back there but God want you to see him ever liveth as far as a ever-present the same today you're right now God that's what he was trying to tell them the kingdom of God is is among you right now well lord the kingdom this in the kingdom that the kingdom of God is right now among you he told him is nigh and I believe that he was telling them that what he was possessing when a person receive the Holy Ghost it's like a little white button like a light in us in that person do you know that even scientists proven when someone pray for the sick and evangelist that's anointed they're sincere when he pray for an individual with a sickness they actually trapped light and so like leaving that evangelist body Internet of that person what is it God wants you to look into the unseen I'm closing my Bible say God wants you to look into the unseen because that's how to devil Roth you when you don't look into the unseen he Rob's you see and many never go on to get Christ they never go on to get the Holy Ghost that's how keeping power if the Holy Ghost will leave us we all fail so I thank God for the Holy Ghost he's not keeping power that's why that's why we must have it it's the only way he'll keep us we pray Lord that kingdom come thy will be done in earth not deserve here but in earth there will be done in earth as it is in heaven see the pattern must be according to heaven Moses build the tabernacle according to the pattern we are Tabernacles pray to the God within you you know what happened during the time in the old testament you had singers they were commanded to sing in the tabernacle continually several were pointed and all they did was some several pointed that was their job they played music some were appointed to stand at the door some were appointed to burn incense but it was continual worship all the time that was their occupation but Paul came over and said rejoice always making melody in our hearts always I'll continue worship that's where Paul and Silas they were in jail they worshiped they sung they praise God it creates a certain atmosphere instead of complaining sometime sing a song call back our song love remembers maybe when you first got saved if the enemy try to bring discouragement I try to get you to doubt or try to go down memory lane you know you take memory and make you sad if you lean too much you get sad you have to say wait a minute I don't need to be sad he does that some music you hear at times it makes you say you got to get away from it it's the truth you know but atmosphere is what makes the difference don't forget that's why often times the Lord kept reminding them I want to remind you who you are remind you that I'm with you remind you that I'll never leave you nor forsake you you want to remind you at all times that's how we walk in victory never defeated never lose ibadah walking on obedience that was the difference he Saul got in with disobedience and the kingdom was rented from him and he began to worship a winch but David as he walked in obedience God gave him victory before he went and that's how we must walk as long as we walk in obedience we have victory but when we get off the Word of God that's when we lose but you don't want to be a loser you want to be a winner don't you want to be a winner I'm glad to be a winner so keep in mind the power of God is within you keep on pressing god bless you richly I know you're tired but don't allow whenever you come to church don't allow to be defeated by the God of Morpheus now sleep God because he always tried to find you to sleep defend you to sleep you know I never seen someone try to eat any sleep you said there may be favored Mir before Matt the table
