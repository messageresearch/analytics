[29:37] sorry
[29:40] um
[29:40] I don't even know where to begin but God
[29:44] has done so many things in my life
[29:48] um
[29:49] but this one it was it's big
[29:56] um five years ago
[29:58] I I was working at a preschool and uh
[30:03] one of the there was I was a
[30:04] two-year-old teacher
[30:06] and I was with another young lady it was
[30:10] 22 two-year-olds in the two of us in the
[30:13] classroom
[30:14] and the classroom was very very uh
[30:18] intense it was it was crazy because we
[30:20] had kids that was autistic we had kids
[30:23] that just was
[30:26] we didn't know how to deal with but it
[30:28] was just the two of us so
[30:31] uh we we instead of getting frustrated
[30:35] at because we had the directors coming
[30:37] to us and telling us that we need to get
[30:39] the classroom under control but we
[30:41] couldn't put the customer under control
[30:42] because she was one of the young ladies
[30:45] that was very
[30:47] um oh they can't learn two-year-olds
[30:49] don't learn and I was born like okay I'm
[30:51] a mother so two-year-olds can't learn so
[30:55] it was just we just kept bumping heads
[30:57] to a point where it was so bad
[30:59] uh it let led me be going to the
[31:03] hospital multiple times with panic
[31:05] attacks and everything because I did not
[31:07] know how to
[31:09] you know get through to her to help like
[31:12] to help her because I was her assistant
[31:13] and
[31:15] um
[31:16] issues to it needless to say it's a long
[31:19] testimony but let me break it short
[31:21] I let we we both left off one day was we
[31:25] just had enough we
[31:27] I walked out of the classroom and said I
[31:30] couldn't work with her anymore so I went
[31:31] to the director to let them know but but
[31:33] prior to that we had so many meetings
[31:35] with the director because it was so bad
[31:37] the classroom was chaotic and she when I
[31:42] walked out of the classroom she went I
[31:45] was talking to them I was I was sitting
[31:46] up front and now I seen her
[31:49] walk from the side from my side the
[31:53] corner of my eyes I seen her she grabbed
[31:55] her son and her son was one years old at
[31:56] the time grabbed her son and she walked
[31:58] out of the building so we both I went to
[32:01] go tell them that I quit and she walked
[32:03] out and quit
[32:05] that same day so both of us end up
[32:07] actually quitting so the lady was like
[32:10] well Jimmy but she walked out you can't
[32:12] quit and I was like okay so this was
[32:16] five years ago but that situation was so
[32:19] bad to where I didn't even know
[32:21] if we could even speak if I would see
[32:24] her again how would it be well two years
[32:27] before that two years ago I ran into her
[32:30] at Walmart and it was another co-worker
[32:33] of Minds that we work we all three work
[32:36] together
[32:37] exactly what I thought how she would
[32:39] handle she walked past me said Hey to
[32:42] the young lady that was standing there I
[32:43] was talking to and walked past me and I
[32:46] said hey Chantel she didn't even respond
[32:48] she just kept walking and I was like Wow
[32:50] exactly so I was like praying I'm like
[32:53] Lord
[32:54] I know I was supposed to be the
[32:56] Christian in this situation and I did
[32:59] not handle this very well it was so bad
[33:03] that I was kept having panic attacks did
[33:06] not know how to handle the situation and
[33:09] um I didn't even know if I would see her
[33:11] again I was so scared if I would see her
[33:13] again how would she handle it again so
[33:17] um Wednesday what it was Wednesday but
[33:20] mind you keep in mind that I've been
[33:22] praying because I said I had to make
[33:24] this right I cannot let it's been a
[33:26] burden on my heart for five years that I
[33:29] had to make it right with this young
[33:30] lady I don't know how but I had to and
[33:34] um
[33:35] Wednesday I believe this week I
[33:38] um God been waking me up this whole week
[33:40] at four o'clock in the morning I don't
[33:43] know why but I just been every time you
[33:45] wake me up I just get up and pray but my
[33:47] alarm don't go off until six o'clock in
[33:49] the morning to get ready for the day and
[33:53] um I was after I finished praying I was
[33:55] reading my Bible and after I was done I
[33:57] went out I didn't never have Facebook
[33:59] app on my phone but I prior to that I
[34:02] downloaded and I was going through
[34:04] Facebook and I ran across to her page
[34:07] and my hand accidentally requested her
[34:11] as a friend and I was like oh man I
[34:14] can't no so I hurry up and cancel the
[34:17] friend request and I'm like man Lord I
[34:19] hope she did not see that because I
[34:21] don't even know how to explain that part
[34:23] maybe I didn't want to feel like I was
[34:25] stalking the girl but it just happened
[34:27] to you know how Facebook will always
[34:29] Show you people that you know so I hurry
[34:32] up and cancel it well that was Wednesday
[34:34] no that was Thursday morning
[34:37] I believe it was Thursday or Friday but
[34:39] that afternoon God has been showing me
[34:42] like a lot of things that he's been
[34:43] doing on my job that and just on my way
[34:48] home after talking to my husband I was
[34:50] just praying and just like have my music
[34:52] on blast and just worshiping all the way
[34:54] up until I got home into the parking lot
[34:57] of my house so I got there and then I um
[35:00] seen that I had a couple of messages
[35:02] when one of the messages was from her
[35:06] she messaged me and she was like why did
[35:08] you unsend your friend request
[35:11] and I was like well
[35:13] um oh my goodness it was an accident I
[35:16] didn't I I've been wanting to apologize
[35:19] to you for five years I did not know how
[35:22] to apologize and I just wanted to ask
[35:24] for your forgiveness because in that
[35:27] situation
[35:28] I was not a Christian in that situation
[35:30] it was just so much going on that I
[35:33] don't even know what happened so she

[35:40] five years as well and I wanted to
[35:44] forgive you and I was asking you for
[35:46] forgiveness as well

[50:45] going to be coming to see us today so
[50:46] good to have you on Amen with us on
[50:48] today God bless you amen so uh
[50:51] appreciate the testimony there from
[50:53] Sister Jamila
[50:55] um I think it was very needful you know
[50:57] years ago we used to hear things like
[50:59] that quite often uh unfortunately we
[51:02] done got to this point we got to be
[51:04] careful because there there is a spirit
[51:05] in the land uh and the spirit that comes
[51:08] in the land is that the love of many wax
[51:10] is cold
[51:11] right and when when the love uh when
[51:13] your love begins to wax cold then you
[51:16] never apologize you never even feel bad
[51:19] about anything or you just go right over
[51:21] the top of but when the Holy Spirit is
[51:23] there to kind of mold us and make us and
[51:25] things are not right we go try to make
[51:27] it right amen we don't want nothing to
[51:30] hinder us from making a Rapture amen so
[51:33] I I appreciate that sis and I just think
[51:36] it's something we all need to kind of
[51:38] pay attention to if there's anything if
[51:40] there's something keeping you out of
[51:42] church make that thing right
[51:45] don't give a devil any any space don't
[51:49] give them any space but that devil that
[51:51] was a he's a crew fella and let me tell
[51:54] you something
[51:55] um sometimes you got to pressure into
[51:58] the house Lord
[51:59] when the devil start getting you to just
[52:01] miss one service you're like okay I'm
[52:03] okay missing this one then I missed the
[52:05] next I feel okay mixing the next and
[52:07] then that third one I feel okay missing
[52:09] that you don't realize you're being put
[52:11] in a pot
[52:13] it's it's it's and they say the way that
[52:15] you uh kill a frog
[52:18] or you boil a frog is that you have to
[52:21] put them in the pot and you slowly turn
[52:24] up the heat you don't put them in a hot
[52:26] boiling water right away because if if
[52:28] if if if you put them in a hot bowl and
[52:30] water that frog would jump out of there
[52:32] remember man you gonna kill me in here
[52:34] jump out he gone but what you got to do
[52:37] is slowly turn up the heat get them
[52:40] comfortable
[52:41] get them comfortable don't let the devil
[52:43] get you comfortable missing Church
[52:46] amen don't get comfortable like that but
[52:48] you gotta press your weight this going
[52:50] into the Rapture is not gonna be easy
[52:52] we're gonna have to fight our way into
[52:54] the Rapture just like the children
[52:56] visitor had to fight the way into the
[52:57] promised land amen but we're going to
[53:00] make it by the grace of God so I
[53:01] encourage you take uh take take what was
[53:03] said here today take that testimony
[53:05] there's anything hindering you make it
[53:07] right if it's between husband and wife
[53:09] make it right it'll be a uh parents and
[53:12] kids make it right if it's between
[53:13] people in the church make it right
[53:15] people on your job make it right

[54:03] singing so one is traveling and I'm not
[54:05] sure about the other but but thank you
[54:07] sis for just being a man ready and
[54:09] available God got everything under
[54:11] control right amen amen you don't
[54:14] thought this thing out you don't throw
[54:16] it out all right
[54:18] if y'all just staying with me I'll read
[54:20] a scripture and then we will just kind
[54:22] of get started here uh uh what was the
[54:25] first song they started with
[54:29] I know it was a blood or
[54:32] okay yeah
[54:34] um when the blood that Jesus shared me
[54:37] it reaches the highest mountain that one
[54:38] okay it flows okay uh but as as they
[54:42] were starting that I said well my I
[54:43] don't know if they knew what my title
[54:45] was today amen but uh but I'm preaching
[54:48] them brought back by the blood
[54:51] amen brought back by the blood so
[54:54] sometimes God allows certain things to
[54:57] happen and search just to bring a little
[54:58] confirmation that this is exactly where
[55:00] he wants us to be so we thank the Lord
[55:03] I'm I'm asking you to turn with me to
[55:04] Ephesians chapter two amen uh there is
[55:08] so much in this chapter and and I will
[55:12] I'm going to read just a few verses but
[55:14] I think I'm gonna go back uh and just
[55:16] read the others I'm gonna let you be
[55:17] seated uh when I read the others but but
[55:20] it's just it's just a beautiful chapter
[55:22] but verse 13 is where I want to start
[55:25] um for for right now
[55:27] and it says um but now
[55:31] in Christ Jesus
[55:33] Ephesians 2 verse 13.
[55:37] um
[55:38] says but now
[55:40] in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were
[55:45] far off are made nigh by the blood of
[55:48] Christ
[55:49] for he is our peace who have made both
[55:54] one and have broken down the middle wall
[55:56] of partition between us
[55:58] having abolished in his flesh the enmity
[56:03] even the law of Commandments contained
[56:07] in ordinances for the making himself of
[56:10] Twain one new man so making peace
[56:14] and that he might reconcile both unto
[56:17] God in one body by the cross have been
[56:21] slain the enmity
[56:23] thereby amen let's just have a word of
[56:26] Prayer father we are so appreciative of
[56:31] the ability to read scripture but we
[56:34] know it takes the Holy Ghost to help us
[56:36] to be able to apply what we read Lord
[56:38] and make it present tense We Trust o God
[56:42] that you would just take complete
[56:43] control over this portion of service
[56:46] thank you for what we've uh felt thus
[56:48] far the anointing the power of the
[56:50] spirit here and uh Lord we just thank
[56:52] you for the saints that we're able to
[56:54] make it today and Lord we we know you
[56:56] have something in store for each one
[56:58] there's some that couldn't make it they
[57:00] had various things that were going on
[57:02] that they they need to attend to and we
[57:04] understand just pray that you bless them
[57:05] Lord those that travel bless them those
[57:08] that we haven't even heard from God we
[57:10] pray that you would bless them and that
[57:11] you would strengthen them encourage them
[57:12] strength help them with God through this
[57:15] time of whatever it is that they might
[57:16] be facing what I just pray that you'd be
[57:18] with them help us to keep our focus on
[57:20] you God because you have so much in
[57:22] store for us the enemy trying to block
[57:23] us and keep us from these things but
[57:25] Lord we know that if we just uh remain
[57:28] faithful hold on persevere God will
[57:30] press through and we'll make to make it
[57:32] through whatever it is whatever the
[57:34] storm is that the enemy is trying to
[57:35] bring acts that you just take control of
[57:37] our thoughts Lord even right now in
[57:39] Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless
[57:42] you you can uh be seated let me uh like
[57:45] I said I want to uh uh teaching on this
[57:49] brought back by the blood amen that is
[57:53] our thought here for today brought back
[57:55] by the blood amen
[58:00] um recently I was just listening to a
[58:02] sermon from Brother Branham and you know
[58:06] he made a statement in the sermon that
[58:08] just kind of my just brought me a little
[58:11] inspiration and just really uh
[58:14] strengthened me and and I would just say
[58:16] just you know just I'm like wow just I
[58:18] just begin to really reflect and think
[58:20] about uh the blood of the Lord Jesus and
[58:22] just what it means to us you know what
[58:24] what it means
[58:27] um I'm I'm I'm grateful for the blood
[58:30] amen I'm grateful for the blood uh and
[58:34] and I wanted to just kind of uh you know
[58:37] just kind of start us off here I'm gonna
[58:38] go to this first sermon that I want to
[58:40] read from his actual Redemption my power
[58:42] might be the second when it's in the
[58:44] list uh but I wanna I wanna read from
[58:46] there just to kind of talk a little bit
[58:48] about the blood amen we've been brought
[58:50] back by the blood amen hallelujah
[58:54] hallelujah hallelujah we can never talk
[58:57] about the blood enough amen amen but
[59:00] this little uh statement brother Brandon
[59:02] makes in in the sermon
[59:04] um
[59:05] uh Redemption by power he says here a
[59:08] few years ago all the religions of the
[59:11] world met amen I believe it was in
[59:14] London England or somewhere I don't
[59:16] remember exactly says but when they was
[59:19] all speaking for different churches the
[59:21] muhammadans uh the Buddhists and
[59:24] everything says a fellow that
[59:25] represented the American Holiness Church
[59:27] John Witt I believe was his name so then
[59:31] when he got up his time to speak all the
[59:34] religions represented uh in this great
[59:36] Gathering he told the story of lady
[59:39] Maccabee right it says uh how how low
[59:44] she was amen uh got arrested in Oklahoma
[59:48] with a sick on her mouth now imagine
[59:50] that this lady got arrested for having a
[59:53] cigar in her mouth she was going to jail
[59:56] because a woman was smoking a cigar
[59:59] oh my it shows how far we've come right
[1:00:02] uh nobody'd be arrested for anything
[1:00:04] like that today but back in those times
[1:00:06] this lady was arrested because she had a
[1:00:08] cigar in her mouth amen look at this it
[1:00:11] says um and that was really bad you know
[1:00:13] to the people when they looked at that
[1:00:15] so it says uh it says um uh with a stick
[1:00:18] on her mouth driving or breaking the
[1:00:21] speed long going through the streets
[1:00:23] with the stage coaching what this is
[1:00:24] it's a it's just a a couple horses
[1:00:27] that's driving a buggy amen this is the
[1:00:30] stagecoach it says she had done so many
[1:00:32] murders my god a woman putting people
[1:00:35] killing people and so filthy and so
[1:00:38] ornery uh until when they went to Tar
[1:00:41] and feather her they wouldn't put their
[1:00:44] hands on her afraid that they would be
[1:00:47] polluted all right look at this and when
[1:00:50] it got the story told in such a dramatic
[1:00:52] way to uh to every listener was sitting
[1:00:56] on the end of their seats he said
[1:00:58] gentlemen of the religions of this world
[1:01:01] has your religion got anything that
[1:01:05] would clean the hands of Lady Maccabee
[1:01:08] and as uh as he got to that question uh
[1:01:11] he said nobody said a word and and when
[1:01:13] he when he realized he had everybody
[1:01:15] right where he wanted him say the
[1:01:16] preacher jumped up in the air kicked his
[1:01:19] heels together and slapped his hands he
[1:01:21] said the blood of Jesus Christ won't
[1:01:25] only clean her hands but it'll clean her
[1:01:28] heart amen that's right and and I like
[1:01:32] that the blood has the ability of
[1:01:35] changing any situation I don't care how
[1:01:38] far you've gone away from God the blood
[1:01:41] is the answer for you today
[1:01:43] blessed be the name of the Lord if the
[1:01:46] blood could clean lady Maccabee the
[1:01:48] blood can clean us Amen brother random
[1:01:51] goes on to say this Amen in the message
[1:01:53] uh possessing all things a man
[1:01:55] possessing all things he says oh isn't
[1:01:58] it wonderful now now not with our
[1:02:01] confession our belief our confession of
[1:02:04] our sins believing that all of our sins
[1:02:07] is in the sea of forgetfulness and I I
[1:02:10] believe that all of our sins is in the
[1:02:13] sea of forgetfulness amen he says he
[1:02:16] that will confess his sins God is just
[1:02:19] to Omit them see they're in the sea of
[1:02:23] the blood of Jesus Christ amen never to
[1:02:26] be remembered no more how many of you
[1:02:29] women know what bleach is look at this
[1:02:31] now how many women know what bleach is
[1:02:33] it says all of you now let's just take a
[1:02:35] great big wash full tub of Clorox says
[1:02:39] that's one bleach Clorox is just one
[1:02:42] bleach it says it says a great Big Tub
[1:02:44] full of Clorox and then you're going to
[1:02:47] take a little eye dropper and you got
[1:02:49] one drop of Black Ink in that eye
[1:02:52] dropper that's your sins stand right up
[1:02:56] over the tub and squeeze it down take
[1:02:59] your eyedropper squeeze that that that
[1:03:01] black ink into the Clorox it says
[1:03:04] squeeze it down then look down in the
[1:03:06] tub and find the Black Ink my god look
[1:03:10] down in the tub and find it what become
[1:03:13] of it what become of the ink when it
[1:03:15] struck that bleach it was so powerful it
[1:03:18] just took the coloring right out of it
[1:03:20] it can never be no more what is it it's
[1:03:23] gone it's eternally lost this is so
[1:03:27] important amen when the ink struck the
[1:03:29] bleach it was eternally lost look at
[1:03:31] what he says here it says what is it the
[1:03:33] ink itself becomes Clorox
[1:03:40] the ink itself becomes Clorox he says
[1:03:45] that's the blood of Jesus Christ to
[1:03:48] every confessed sin what is it it's
[1:03:51] forgotten
[1:03:53] oh I'm telling you I thank God for the
[1:03:56] blood there is nothing that the devil
[1:03:58] can bring against me or you this morning
[1:04:01] once something has been convinced amen
[1:04:05] he says it's forgotten it's done it's
[1:04:08] finished it's omitted it's divorce
[1:04:12] my God is put away it can never be
[1:04:15] remembered against you no more thank God
[1:04:18] for the blood
[1:04:20] you know the devil's always accusing us
[1:04:23] of this and accusing us of that and you
[1:04:25] didn't do this and you but I confessed
[1:04:27] it when you can tell the devil you
[1:04:29] confess that God does not remember it
[1:04:31] anymore the only one trying to remember
[1:04:33] it is the devil you don't have to
[1:04:35] receive any accusation that the devil
[1:04:37] brings in your life not one not one I
[1:04:41] like the statement that the prophet said
[1:04:42] here the ink itself becomes the Clorox
[1:04:46] the ink becomes the Clorox so it's just
[1:04:49] that powerful a man that once the ink
[1:04:52] goes into the cold rocks it
[1:04:54] disintegrates and the ink becomes the
[1:04:56] Clorox
[1:04:58] as our sins being washed in the blood of
[1:05:00] the Lord Jesus and I wanna I wanna say
[1:05:02] it like this when when uh when we've
[1:05:05] been washed in the blood
[1:05:07] you become a representative of that
[1:05:10] blood
[1:05:11] when you've been washed in the blood you
[1:05:14] become a representative of that blood
[1:05:17] amen amen amen amen all right just stay
[1:05:21] with me here we uh I got some things
[1:05:24] that I I know we're gonna you know we'll
[1:05:26] get into here in in a little bit but uh
[1:05:29] just you know when brother Brandon make
[1:05:31] these just little statements to me it
[1:05:34] just it kind of takes
[1:05:36] um our understanding the blood and
[1:05:38] there's many that preach on it you know
[1:05:39] they talk about it and and we thank God
[1:05:41] for all the sermons on it but uh our
[1:05:45] life is a part of this
[1:05:47] amen
[1:05:49] um uh like I said you become a
[1:05:51] representative of that blood that's why
[1:05:53] the sister had for five years she just
[1:05:55] couldn't couldn't couldn't let that
[1:05:57] thing settle I gotta make this thing
[1:05:58] right I become I was a different person
[1:06:01] back then can you imagine that I'm going
[1:06:04] back to something I did before I became
[1:06:06] a Christian and I want I want to now
[1:06:08] apologize for something I did way back
[1:06:10] then because you know what I'm a
[1:06:12] representative of the blood
[1:06:14] Hallelujah it means so much the ink
[1:06:17] itself becomes Clorox now there's a
[1:06:20] statement that I'm gonna get to a little
[1:06:21] bit later on but uh you know brother
[1:06:24] random say the the church or the bride
[1:06:27] by the spirit is the blood of the Lord
[1:06:30] Jesus
[1:06:32] the blood of the Lord Jesus by the
[1:06:34] spirit you
[1:06:40] you got my God we're going to get into
[1:06:42] that in a little bit but by the spirit
[1:06:44] you are the blood
[1:06:45] amen amen look at what brother Brandon
[1:06:48] says in the message adoption
[1:06:50] it says um but a real Spirit-filled
[1:06:54] church
[1:06:55] full of the power of God
[1:06:57] sitting together in Heavenly places
[1:07:00] offering spiritual sacrifices Praises of
[1:07:03] God the Holy Spirit moving among them
[1:07:06] Discerning sin and calling out things
[1:07:09] that's among them that's wrong
[1:07:11] straightening out and making the place
[1:07:13] level that's what's going on God is
[1:07:16] making the place level because why
[1:07:18] always in the presence of God is that
[1:07:21] Bloody sacrifice now remember we went
[1:07:23] through it in the sports says you wasn't
[1:07:25] saved by the blood you're kept saved by
[1:07:29] the blood but you were saved by grace
[1:07:31] through faith believing it you are kept
[1:07:35] saved by the blood my God my God I mean
[1:07:38] you know uh I'm gonna come back this
[1:07:40] quote but sometimes enough and you know
[1:07:43] as we're going through the devil sin of
[1:07:45] Mind battle and uh and he wants you he
[1:07:47] might might want you to get off on this
[1:07:48] I might want you to get off on that
[1:07:50] maybe even if you're just sitting there
[1:07:52] uh um watching YouTube and uh as you
[1:07:56] watch on YouTube all of a sudden because
[1:07:57] of artificial intelligence they just
[1:08:00] start throwing different things at you
[1:08:01] if you are on Facebook if you're on uh
[1:08:05] any social media they automatically
[1:08:07] start throwing things at you you never
[1:08:09] intended to go into those areas but why
[1:08:10] they start uh showing you all this
[1:08:12] advertisement like this right it's
[1:08:14] saying and the devil's trying to lure
[1:08:16] you into something that you don't need
[1:08:17] to be in and then even if you don't you
[1:08:19] don't take the bait even if you don't
[1:08:21] fall for the trick of the enemy he still
[1:08:23] plants a seed in your mind and now you
[1:08:26] got to deal with the Mind battle behind
[1:08:28] that thing hallelujah amen it wasn't the
[1:08:30] blood that save you but it's the blood
[1:08:32] that keeps you it's the blood that say
[1:08:34] no I'm not going to that website no I'm
[1:08:36] not going to watch that show no I'm not
[1:08:39] going to do this no I'm not it's the
[1:08:40] blood that is keeping you
[1:08:44] it's the blood say no I'm not going to
[1:08:46] talk to my co-worker like that no I'm
[1:08:47] not going to handle the sister it's the
[1:08:49] blood that's stopping you from doing
[1:08:51] that
[1:08:52] thank God for the blood
[1:08:55] it says it's the it's a blood it says
[1:08:58] you wasn't saved by the blood you kept
[1:09:00] saved by the blood but you were saved by
[1:09:02] grace through faith believing it God
[1:09:05] knocked at your heart because he
[1:09:07] predestinated you you looked up and
[1:09:09] believed it accepted it now the blood
[1:09:11] makes an atonement for your sins
[1:09:13] remember I said God does not condemn a
[1:09:15] center for sinning he's a sinner to
[1:09:17] begin with he condemns he condemns a
[1:09:20] Christian for sinning he says and then
[1:09:22] because uh because uh because he has
[1:09:25] condemned him Christ took our
[1:09:27] condemnation so there's no condemnation
[1:09:30] to them which are in Christ Jesus that
[1:09:32] walked not after the flesh but after the
[1:09:34] spirit and if you do anything wrong it
[1:09:37] isn't willfully you don't sin willfully
[1:09:40] a man that says willfully goes out on
[1:09:41] whipless since never come into that
[1:09:44] blood yet but a man that's once in there
[1:09:47] he's dead and his life is hidden God
[1:09:48] through Christ sealed by the Holy Ghost
[1:09:51] and the devil can't even find him I like
[1:09:53] that the devil can't even find him he's
[1:09:56] so far back in there he'll have to come
[1:09:59] out of there before the devil can can
[1:10:01] ever get him for your dead now when
[1:10:03] you're washed in the blood you get so
[1:10:06] deep in there that the devil can't even
[1:10:08] find you
[1:10:09] you get the do you get so deep that the
[1:10:12] devil can't find you and the only way
[1:10:13] that you're going to fall to the devil
[1:10:15] you got to come from outside of that
[1:10:16] blood but if you just stay underneath
[1:10:19] the blood
[1:10:21] you got protection
[1:10:23] oh my my I have some scriptures here
[1:10:27] that I want to just kind of accept the
[1:10:29] scriptures I want to bring in I'm just
[1:10:31] kind of talking about what what impact
[1:10:33] the blood has on us Ephesians 1 7
[1:10:37] a man uh it says this my God in whom we
[1:10:42] have Redemption see the blood brings us
[1:10:44] Redemption Amen in whom we have
[1:10:47] Redemption through his blood
[1:10:49] the Forgiveness of sins it's the blood
[1:10:51] brings Redemption as also the blood is
[1:10:53] what gives us forgiveness amen of our
[1:10:55] sins according to the riches of his
[1:10:59] grace oh my uh I was reminded as I was
[1:11:03] reading that scripture uh you know we we
[1:11:05] had a little a little Fellowship just
[1:11:08] amongst the the Ministers of the church

[1:11:12] y'all to forgive me we're supposed to
[1:11:14] have a youth service on Friday night and
[1:11:15] I completely forgot about uh announcing
[1:11:18] it and and and getting prepared for it I
[1:11:20] really I'm sorry about that so we'll
[1:11:21] have to make that up to our young people
[1:11:23] but uh but you know we took the time and
[1:11:25] just took the ministers and we all went
[1:11:26] out to eat a little bit and and
[1:11:28] something just kind of come up in the
[1:11:29] conversation just a real real blessing
[1:11:32] uh we were just kind of talking about
[1:11:34] some things and and I was reminded of of
[1:11:36] a story where brother Brandon you know
[1:11:38] especially with the scripture the blood
[1:11:41] um it's we get Redemption through the
[1:11:42] blood the Forgiveness of sins according
[1:11:44] to the riches of his grace and I was
[1:11:46] reminded of this of the story that

[1:11:51] people need to hear about the blood oh
[1:11:53] hallelujah amen people people you need
[1:11:56] to know the power of the blood people
[1:11:59] need to know that their sins can be
[1:12:00] forgiven because of the blood right and
[1:12:03] and I was reminded of the story brother
[1:12:04] Branham told how he went into a
[1:12:06] restaurant a man and when he went into
[1:12:09] the restaurant uh he noticed a police
[1:12:11] officer doing one thing with with
[1:12:13] somebody was not his wife and he noticed
[1:12:15] this other lady amen an older lady
[1:12:17] sitting there with two gentlemen and and
[1:12:19] uh and you know and carrying herself in
[1:12:21] a way that just really ungodly and uh it
[1:12:24] just started noticing all these things
[1:12:25] in the restaurant he just he said Lord
[1:12:27] do my children have to grow up and be a
[1:12:30] part of something like this he said do
[1:12:31] they have to live in a world like he
[1:12:33] says why would you just destroy this
[1:12:34] place God why can't you just sit here I
[1:12:36] mean look at the sin just destroy this
[1:12:38] place God said come here I need to talk
[1:12:40] to you just for a minute and brother
[1:12:42] Brandon was called behind the door and
[1:12:44] when he got there behind the door Amen
[1:12:46] in the restaurant uh he got he saw world
[1:12:49] just turned into spinning and as the
[1:12:51] world was spinning he noticed amen that
[1:12:53] Jesus was a man was on the cross and and
[1:12:56] he says uh uh he saw these little black
[1:12:58] spots leaving the Earth and as they were
[1:13:00] leaving Earth they would hit Jesus and
[1:13:03] Jesus was like a bumper over the world
[1:13:04] his blood was a bumper for the city it
[1:13:07] would hit Jesus then it would bounce
[1:13:08] back but he would just see the pain in
[1:13:10] Jesus face as it was he says he's saying
[1:13:13] Lord is that what these people sin is
[1:13:15] doing to you causing you to feel all
[1:13:17] that pain he said no no it's not what
[1:13:19] their sin is doing to me it says it's
[1:13:21] what your sin is doing to me he said he
[1:13:24] said oh my so every little black spot he
[1:13:26] saw leaving the Earth it was his own sin
[1:13:28] that was causing Jesus amen to wince and
[1:13:31] pain
[1:13:32] he says he said he says now what I need
[1:13:35] to tell you is that I forgiven you for
[1:13:37] your sins amen but uh but but you want
[1:13:41] to condemn everybody in the restaurant
[1:13:42] for their sins especially this lady
[1:13:44] right here you want to condemn it for
[1:13:45] our sins but I've forgiven you for your
[1:13:47] sins oh my mama he said he he say he
[1:13:50] says now if I forgiven you why don't you
[1:13:52] have a little Mercy for her we need to
[1:13:54] learn how to learn to have mercy for
[1:13:56] other people when we've been washed in
[1:13:57] the blood we got to give them an
[1:13:59] opportunity to get watched in that same
[1:14:01] blood
[1:14:03] now let me tell you something life won't
[1:14:04] change until they come in contact with
[1:14:06] the blood

[1:14:20] realize I was doing that to you and and
[1:14:22] here he is as the prophet as the prophet

[1:14:27] the brothers God needed to take the
[1:14:30] prophet to that through that experience
[1:14:31] because that lady that he was getting
[1:14:34] ready to tell is this experience too
[1:14:36] that lady was in a condition where she
[1:14:39] thought a man that uh she had gone past

[1:15:41] God should come down and Destroy This
[1:15:43] Place
[1:15:44] and he and uh and they just began to
[1:15:46] talk and and uh and brother Bradham
[1:15:49] explained this what the vision had just
[1:15:51] occurred to her and she said she says
[1:15:53] you know are you the preacher that's
[1:15:54] down there preaching are you brother
[1:15:55] Brandon she said he said yes he says I
[1:15:58] say I'm embarrassed to be here in front
[1:16:00] of you like this I'm so embarrassed she
[1:16:02] said would you pray for me say I want to
[1:16:03] tell you my story my husband now and one
[1:16:06] one quote she said her husband another
[1:16:08] quote said it was my father but somehow
[1:16:10] she was related to a preacher I said my
[1:16:13] husband or was her father was she was
[1:16:15] she was she was raised up in a house or
[1:16:17] lived in the house where preaching was
[1:16:19] was was was was happening and somehow
[1:16:22] after this person died she got
[1:16:23] disconnected from God
[1:16:25] and uh and she started moving into a
[1:16:27] life that she should have never moved
[1:16:29] into but yet this woman used to be a
[1:16:31] Christian and she thought to herself I
[1:16:33] am beyond the blood so when brother
[1:16:35] Branham told me say no the world was
[1:16:37] spinning and then there was a uh Jesus
[1:16:39] was whistling in pain but every time a
[1:16:41] black spot would go he would be would
[1:16:43] push it back away from the presence of
[1:16:44] God so he said if that black streak
[1:16:46] would have made him to the present of
[1:16:47] God I would have been wiped out he says
[1:16:49] but he told me he forgave me and I was
[1:16:51] he said he said and you want to condemn
[1:16:53] her what I need to let you know remember
[1:16:55] is that there's still Blood on the cross
[1:16:57] for you amen there's still room at the
[1:16:59] cross for you and amen and I don't care
[1:17:02] what you've done I might be looking at
[1:17:04] you in some some kind of way here in
[1:17:06] this restaurant but there is blood a man
[1:17:08] on The Mercy Seat just for you ma'am
[1:17:12] say they change that whole environment
[1:17:14] once the lady got a revelation
[1:17:17] that there was still blood for her
[1:17:20] it changed the whole environment in the
[1:17:22] restaurant
[1:17:23] somebody needs to hear
[1:17:25] about the power of the blood
[1:17:29] here Colossians 1 verse 13 through 14.
[1:17:33] who have delivered us
[1:17:35] from the power of Darkness
[1:17:37] and have translated us into the kingdom
[1:17:39] of his dear son in whom we have
[1:17:42] Redemption
[1:17:44] through his blood even the Forgiveness
[1:17:47] of sins amen place it under the blood
[1:17:51] amen Revelation 12 and 11 and brother
[1:17:54] Troy quoted this one early in the
[1:17:56] service and they overcame him if you're
[1:17:58] going to overcome the devil my God if
[1:18:01] you're going to overcome the devil you
[1:18:02] have to do it by the blood of lamb and
[1:18:04] you know just stay under the blood if
[1:18:07] you stay under the blood the devil can't
[1:18:09] even find you
[1:18:11] so that's how you overcome don't come
[1:18:14] from underneath that blood stay under
[1:18:17] the blood
[1:18:19] they overcame him by the blood of the
[1:18:21] lamb and by the word of their testimony
[1:18:23] oh I just love this and they love not
[1:18:25] their lives unto death if you were just
[1:18:27] the worry of testimony amen should be
[1:18:30] what has the blood done for you
[1:18:32] has the blood change you has the
[1:18:35] blood-free Jew has the blood amen uh
[1:18:37] delivered you if the blood has done
[1:18:39] something for you let I mean continue to
[1:18:41] share that testimony of what God has
[1:18:43] already done forget about what the devil
[1:18:45] trying to do tell them what God has
[1:18:46] already done through his blood for you
[1:18:49] glory to God they overcame him by the
[1:18:54] blood of the Lamb my God I tell you the
[1:18:56] truth I mean sometimes you get into
[1:18:58] something like this it's just little
[1:19:00] things that people need to give them the
[1:19:03] victory
[1:19:04] sometimes we want something so great so
[1:19:06] big no God want to give you something
[1:19:07] real small this right here would give
[1:19:10] you the victory over the devil every day
[1:19:12] in your life
[1:19:13] stay under the blood
[1:19:19] and they overcame him by the blood of
[1:19:21] the lamb and by the word of their
[1:19:23] testimony they loved not their lives
[1:19:25] unto death
[1:19:26] Hebrews chapter 13 verse 12-13 amen it
[1:19:31] says this
[1:19:32] says wherefore uh Jesus also that he
[1:19:36] might sanctify the people
[1:19:40] with his own blood so the blood brings
[1:19:42] us sanctification and what
[1:19:44] sanctification is is clean it cleans us
[1:19:47] and it sets us aside for service amen
[1:19:50] wherefore Jesus also that he might
[1:19:52] sanctify the people with his own blood
[1:19:54] Suffer Without the gate and then it goes
[1:19:57] on Paul says let us go forth therefore
[1:19:59] unto him without the camp bearing his
[1:20:02] reproach also Hebrews 10 and 14. my God
[1:20:07] I love a man where the blood has done
[1:20:09] for me uh Paul says this for by one

[1:26:14] Amen in the message condemnation by
[1:26:16] representation now
[1:26:19] you know uh
[1:26:21] as we're getting this quote prepared
[1:26:23] this is the sermon that I was listening
[1:26:25] to this week where you know brother
[1:26:27] Branham uh was just making some
[1:26:29] statements and I said my just what a
[1:26:31] what a blessing Amen to uh
[1:26:34] uh
[1:26:36] uh you know just to hear this
[1:26:38] in this message and I want I'm gonna
[1:26:41] just say this you know before we get to
[1:26:43] it but in this message if you would go
[1:26:45] back and listen to it brother Brandon
[1:26:47] was inspired by you know just different
[1:26:49] things he was seeing in and he began to
[1:26:51] talk about hybrids and how high breeding
[1:26:54] was just it's wrong you know I mean it
[1:26:58] was looking at corn and it's like look
[1:26:59] at this corn and and and and how they
[1:27:01] how they how they uh producing the corn
[1:27:03] but it's hybrid corn it says this corn
[1:27:06] with you know if you if you took the
[1:27:08] took it and tried to Resort again and
[1:27:10] have it replant again it wouldn't grow
[1:27:12] anything
[1:27:13] see hybrid and it can't grow again I
[1:27:15] mean it's just it's not the original
[1:27:17] hallelujah amen it's not the original so
[1:27:20] you know he started talking about high
[1:27:22] breeding and talked about in so many
[1:27:23] different areas and and I want you to
[1:27:25] understand you know even like when you
[1:27:27] see a mule my God a mule is a hybrid
[1:27:31] animal
[1:27:31] right amen uh you know and and uh it's a
[1:27:35] horse and a donkey come together and
[1:27:36] produce this meal and it could work like
[1:27:38] crazy it said but at the end of working
[1:27:41] like crazy it'll kick you
[1:27:43] right he said say the mule is just it's
[1:27:46] just something he said but you can never
[1:27:47] immune can't reproduce yourself you got
[1:27:49] to bring two animals together to try to
[1:27:51] produce that mule Hallelujah you know he
[1:27:54] talked about it even in fruit trees amen
[1:27:57] and how hybrid and took place and
[1:27:59] sometimes a a Vine that's connected amen
[1:28:02] like you could have a lemon tree
[1:28:03] connected to Orange Vine amen uh the
[1:28:06] root of an orange tree he says he says
[1:28:08] it would produce life it would produce
[1:28:10] lemon because that's what's in the
[1:28:12] branch he says but but it's it's it's
[1:28:14] getting a life from a man from from
[1:28:16] another source my God it's hybrid amen
[1:28:20] it says when you see these things even
[1:28:21] like you know some of the oranges that
[1:28:23] they give us and you know you you go to
[1:28:25] the store you pick up something if that
[1:28:26] thing ain't got no seed in it it can't
[1:28:29] reproduce itself
[1:28:31] and it may tastes good but it's really
[1:28:33] not good for you high breeding amen it's
[1:28:35] not good he said even in people we got
[1:28:37] to watch this High breeding
[1:28:39] it says you got to watch that amen go
[1:28:41] back and just listen to the tape you'll
[1:28:43] see uh uh you know that you know even
[1:28:45] when we start talking about that I know
[1:28:46] sometimes I get very very delicate
[1:28:49] because you know of um mixed marriages
[1:28:51] and everything we understand that say it
[1:28:53] and I just wanna I wanna make this clear
[1:28:55] if there was a couple that was mixed
[1:28:57] marriage I have no problem with them
[1:28:59] coming to church they can there they can
[1:29:01] fellowship at Spirit and Truth
[1:29:02] Tabernacle I don't want nobody to feel
[1:29:04] like a people that somebody's mixed
[1:29:06] marriage King Fellowship here in church
[1:29:07] yes they can
[1:29:09] yes they can the blood still washes all
[1:29:12] that too
[1:29:13] the only thing is is brother Brandon
[1:29:15] teaches us that you know uh sometimes we
[1:29:17] find ourselves in situations teach your
[1:29:19] children not to do certain things
[1:29:22] so our job is just to teach our kids if
[1:29:24] brother brother bam said just watch that
[1:29:26] High breathing don't do things like that
[1:29:28] amen watch this now now
[1:29:31] um uh uh uh in this in this sermon here
[1:29:34] and and um uh condronation by
[1:29:37] representation it says this it says so
[1:29:40] when they see the inspirator of his wife
[1:29:44] it says uh Eve when he come to meet
[1:29:47] Jesus and said oh yes it is written that
[1:29:50] he'll give the Angels charge overly lest
[1:29:52] any time thou dast thy foot against the
[1:29:54] stone they'll bear it up yes it's also
[1:29:57] written he wouldn't cross him up he was
[1:29:59] God made flesh he was my savior and my
[1:30:02] God he couldn't cross him up what he
[1:30:04] what'd he do then he embraced the cross
[1:30:06] and on the cross he died for me and for
[1:30:08] you and for the world that he might
[1:30:10] restore back again to God what sons and
[1:30:13] daughters like in the Garden of Eden
[1:30:14] before they got crossed up in theology
[1:30:16] now this is important to me the sons of
[1:30:18] God Sons in the Garden of Eden they got
[1:30:21] crossed up in their theology
[1:30:23] you know and the blood actually bring us
[1:30:26] back to a correct theology watch this
[1:30:30] and then it says uh
[1:30:32] amen uh uh embrace the cross on the
[1:30:34] cross he died for me and you and for the
[1:30:35] world that he might restore me again
[1:30:37] God's again to God what sons and
[1:30:39] daughters like in the Garden of Eden
[1:30:40] before they got crossed up in theology
[1:30:42] oh God if people can only see that if I
[1:30:45] could only profound that into the people
[1:30:47] Jesus died that he might take away from
[1:30:51] this hybrid Church stuff that he might
[1:30:54] bring your minds and Faith away from
[1:30:56] what man has said back to what God Said
[1:30:59] not a hybrid Faith well maybe the days
[1:31:02] of Miracles has passed maybe maybe that
[1:31:04] won't happen oh brother God said it
[1:31:06] happens in that settles it that's for
[1:31:08] always God said so look he says Jesus
[1:31:12] died that he might breed back and see
[1:31:15] that's where I'm getting my inspiration
[1:31:17] brought back by the blood Jesus died
[1:31:20] that he might breathe back oh Hallelujah
[1:31:23] only the blood can do that only through
[1:31:26] the chemistry of the blood of Jesus
[1:31:28] Christ can breathe back again a person
[1:31:31] that won't vary one word from what God
[1:31:34] Said only the blood can bring a person
[1:31:37] back to a place where they won't vary
[1:31:39] from one word God said only the blood
[1:31:42] could bring us back Even Adam they vary
[1:31:45] from what the word of God said but only
[1:31:47] the blood could bring us back
[1:31:50] oh Hallelujah hey this this yes it
[1:31:54] certainly reaches the highest mountain
[1:31:55] and flows through the Lord's Valley I
[1:31:56] want you to get this the blood is
[1:31:58] bringing us back where we believe the
[1:32:00] word
[1:32:01] I'ma say that again the blood is
[1:32:04] bringing us back where we believe the
[1:32:07] word where we're not crossed up in our
[1:32:09] theology Jesus went to the cross the
[1:32:12] street in our theology
[1:32:17] [Applause]
[1:32:20] he went to the cross the street in our
[1:32:22] theology all these different
[1:32:24] denominations that was not his will he
[1:32:27] went to the cross the street and all
[1:32:28] that stuff out the blood brings it back
[1:32:33] hallelujah hallelujah look at this he
[1:32:36] says Jesus Christ he says uh Jesus died
[1:32:39] that he might breathe back oh Hallelujah
[1:32:41] only the blood can do that only through
[1:32:43] the chemistry of the blood of Jesus
[1:32:45] Christ can breathe back again a person
[1:32:47] that won't vary one word from what God
[1:32:49] Said Eve showed her weakness
[1:32:52] the church show what she did she said
[1:32:55] well maybe you maybe you're right maybe
[1:32:57] God wouldn't hold me responsible because
[1:32:59] I just well if uh what difference does
[1:33:02] it make as long as I'm baptized see you
[1:33:04] know people reasoning
[1:33:05] what difference does it make as long as
[1:33:07] I oh so that shows you need another
[1:33:09] breeding that shows that something's got
[1:33:12] to come back to you to bring you to a
[1:33:14] faith that what God Said not one jot or
[1:33:18] one Tittle shall pass from God's word
[1:33:20] till it's all fulfilled let every man's
[1:33:23] word be alive but and his be true Christ
[1:33:26] came that he might breathe back by the
[1:33:29] Holy Spirit I'ma say I just like that
[1:33:31] brought back by the blood Christ came
[1:33:34] that he might breed back by the holy
[1:33:37] spirit let me keep reading it says oh
[1:33:39] brother as we sit together now in
[1:33:42] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus the Holy
[1:33:44] Spirit breathing upon us like we are now
[1:33:46] breeding back look at the look at what
[1:33:49] the statements say breathing back taking
[1:33:51] away the rubbish of theology
[1:33:57] so the blood
[1:33:58] that cleanses us from our sins
[1:34:01] can I talk about the blood
[1:34:04] the blood that that brings forgiveness
[1:34:07] the blood that brings Redemption the
[1:34:10] blood that makes us Kings and Priests
[1:34:12] until God is the same blood that's
[1:34:15] breathing away
[1:34:17] the rubbish theology
[1:34:26] can we get that yeah I mean everybody
[1:34:28] can see Christ down on the cross
[1:34:30] everybody can see him Rising again on
[1:34:33] the third day but but when he died when
[1:34:35] he rose again the very purpose of that
[1:34:38] he had a greater plan in mind
[1:34:41] amen his blood was to breed back the
[1:34:45] rubbish of theology
[1:34:49] the blood is supposed to watch you not
[1:34:51] only from your sins the blood washes you
[1:34:54] from false theology
[1:34:57] all right
[1:35:02] brought back by the blood
[1:35:08] I'll tell you I'll tell you I I don't
[1:35:11] even see it the way I should see it
[1:35:13] but I'm seeing enough of her just to
[1:35:15] bring it to your attention the blood is
[1:35:17] what washes you from Bad theology
[1:35:21] the blood will keep you
[1:35:25] the blood will fix you the blood will
[1:35:27] straighten some things out the blood
[1:35:29] will do it
[1:35:30] the blood of Jesus will do this
[1:35:35] breathing back taking away the rubbish
[1:35:37] of theology
[1:35:39] take him amen uh taking away the rubbish
[1:35:42] of the world
[1:35:43] man-made doctrines having forms of
[1:35:46] governments denying the power thereof
[1:35:48] breed it back into an unadulterated
[1:35:52] faith in God Jesus saves it oh I know
[1:35:55] it's written but you uh but you know
[1:35:57] what said thou shall eat Jesus said and
[1:35:59] it's also written it's also written yes
[1:36:02] it's written that he'll do this and
[1:36:03] you'll you'll you shall turn these but
[1:36:05] if you are the Son of God you can
[1:36:07] perform a miracle here before me and
[1:36:09] turn these songs and bread let me see
[1:36:10] you do it he be he be minding Satan see
[1:36:13] the shrewdness of God there it's written
[1:36:15] man should not live by bread alone see
[1:36:17] him right with the word he defeated
[1:36:20] Satan every time right on the word he
[1:36:23] stayed with the word and if he came to
[1:36:25] breed us back to sons and doors of God
[1:36:27] like we was at the beginning how can we
[1:36:30] get away from the word then how can we
[1:36:33] ever get anywhere till we get back to
[1:36:36] the word the blood is what brings us
[1:36:39] back to the word
[1:36:43] you know as I was just thinking about
[1:36:46] this breeding back
[1:36:48] for me I'm not uh
[1:36:50] I'm not into uh uh animals and things
[1:36:54] like that and not even into the farming
[1:36:58] and I mean I don't even know too much
[1:36:59] about season planting nothing and
[1:37:01] getting it to grow if you if you gave it
[1:37:02] to me and wanted me to get in the garage
[1:37:04] all I can do is pray for it
[1:37:07] but get out there and water it out I
[1:37:09] don't know what I'm doing I just stayed
[1:37:11] that's not my Lane I know how to stay in
[1:37:13] my Lane
[1:37:14] amen right but uh but you know um
[1:37:19] um so a lot of times when when brother
[1:37:21] Brandon used this this type of language
[1:37:23] because you know him being a hunter and
[1:37:25] he's a man of the Wilderness and all
[1:37:27] this so he uses a lot of terms amen kind
[1:37:30] of like uh what John the Baptist used
[1:37:32] later acts at the root of the tree what
[1:37:33] you talking about John
[1:37:35] you know they said get rid of get rid of
[1:37:37] that sin problem right at the root
[1:37:38] that's what he's trying to tell you but
[1:37:40] brother Brandon would also use a man uh
[1:37:42] uh types and and and shadows and things
[1:37:45] like that from nature so when he uses
[1:37:47] the term that that Jesus blood was to
[1:37:49] breed back
[1:37:51] I said well let me go look at what this
[1:37:53] word breeding and everything is all
[1:37:55] about so when I go when I go and I start
[1:37:56] searching that I always go to a kid's
[1:37:59] website
[1:38:01] not even I try not to go to adult
[1:38:03] websites because I can't understand
[1:38:05] these people saying so I go put it down
[1:38:08] in children's terms for me Glory I got a
[1:38:11] master's degree but I understand and
[1:38:13] think things in children's terms
[1:38:15] that's the way I think hallelujah amen
[1:38:18] sorry I go to this children's uh science
[1:38:21] website and and I just looked up you
[1:38:23] know breeding and it says
[1:38:24] whatever the name living things
[1:38:28] reproduce to create Offspring or babies
[1:38:32] of the same kind
[1:38:34] this process is known as breeding right
[1:38:38] and it's responsible for the creation of
[1:38:40] new life from existing life amen so
[1:38:44] breathing is when we're bringing in New
[1:38:46] Life Hallelujah no matter what the
[1:38:48] speech is amen humans when another a
[1:38:51] child I mean we got a granddaughter
[1:38:52] gonna be born any minute now amen the
[1:38:55] parents amen have bread and they're
[1:38:57] bringing forth New Life
[1:38:58] hallelujah amen when dogs get together
[1:39:01] they bring forth new life amen and at my
[1:39:04] house we have a uh
[1:39:06] um
[1:39:08] uh what's the shutters and uh you know
[1:39:11] right above our door and you know we're
[1:39:13] none of us knew none of us knew this we
[1:39:16] just we just got the shutters up there
[1:39:17] next day you know there was a you know
[1:39:19] uh uh maybe uh uh just not what would
[1:39:23] you just a
[1:39:25] I don't like Bush kind of like a little
[1:39:27] piece of bush
[1:39:29] Twigs there's one twig there okay
[1:39:32] nothing maybe the wind blew it up there
[1:39:33] another twig there oh maybe the wind
[1:39:36] blow that up there because we had some
[1:39:37] strong winds another twig now and next
[1:39:39] thing you know we look up it has a bird
[1:39:41] sitting there
[1:39:42] and every time we come out the house
[1:39:44] that bird is looking at us and then
[1:39:46] sometimes my son-in-law's been there and
[1:39:48] there's another bird coming attack my
[1:39:49] son-in-law say now don't you touch that
[1:39:51] bird up there and that what it is it's a
[1:39:53] mother watching over her babies now I
[1:39:56] could have knocked the thing down but
[1:39:57] they breathing
[1:40:00] and we want to see them babies come
[1:40:01] forth Hallelujah glory to God right say
[1:40:05] something but anytime amen whatever the
[1:40:07] species either get together and another
[1:40:09] of that species have been born breathing
[1:40:11] has taken place
[1:40:13] look at this now look at this look at
[1:40:15] this uh because brother random is using
[1:40:17] the term breed back right breed back the
[1:40:21] blood has it's breathing us back from a
[1:40:24] man theology rubbish the rubbish of
[1:40:27] theology the blood is bringing us back
[1:40:29] to the the pure word of God the the
[1:40:32] blood is what does that and let me tell
[1:40:34] you once you get back Hallelujah once
[1:40:38] you get back to the pure understanding
[1:40:40] of what God meant in his word then you
[1:40:42] gotta stay behind the blood
[1:40:46] once you get back
[1:40:48] hallelujaha this message is blood
[1:40:54] this message is blood
[1:40:57] look at this look at this so so they
[1:40:59] have they have um this uh this term
[1:41:01] called selective breathing
[1:41:05] amen and and what selective breeding is
[1:41:07] it's a name as its name suggests
[1:41:10] selective breeding is when specific
[1:41:13] living things are selected to breed in
[1:41:18] order to bring out certain traits
[1:41:21] my God my God you know in order to bring
[1:41:25] out certain traits do we want to bring
[1:41:26] these two animals together and we want
[1:41:28] them to breed they do it but they back
[1:41:31] in the slavery days they did it with
[1:41:32] humans if they wanted a bigger and
[1:41:34] stronger slave they got a big woman a
[1:41:36] big man and put them together
[1:41:38] they were selective breathing they
[1:41:40] weren't even married but they were
[1:41:42] forced to do this thing it was selective
[1:41:44] breathing and even in uh with animals
[1:41:47] that that people that do these type of
[1:41:49] things it's selective in their breeding
[1:41:51] they want to bring out certain traits
[1:41:53] they say for example racehorses that
[1:41:55] have strong well-developed legs may be
[1:41:57] bred together to create Stronger Faster
[1:41:59] Horses I mean brother brother Jose is
[1:42:02] into the horse business and sometimes he
[1:42:04] has to uh he was telling me a little
[1:42:06] situation where there was a horse
[1:42:08] that um uh somebody was coming to buy
[1:42:12] but that horse somehow hurt his foot
[1:42:14] and uh and they knew that the the people
[1:42:16] were coming to buy the horse and these
[1:42:18] are this you know this ain't no cheap
[1:42:20] horse
[1:42:21] I mean this is a lot of money so so they
[1:42:24] call brother those who said we need you
[1:42:25] here right now uh we getting ready to
[1:42:27] sell this horse and this horse is you
[1:42:29] know looking to serve where they knew if
[1:42:30] that horse would have walked that out
[1:42:31] there like that they could forget about
[1:42:33] it the sale was over I mean they
[1:42:35] wouldn't get they won't get nothing so
[1:42:37] they called Brotherhood said we need you
[1:42:38] could you please fix this shoe fix them
[1:42:40] do something for this horse and brother
[1:42:42] Jose he said I come he got out there
[1:42:44] when he got there to the horse he looked
[1:42:46] and said Lord I don't know what I'm
[1:42:47] gonna do
[1:42:48] so he just prayed
[1:42:52] so he prayed he prayed for the horse
[1:42:54] amen and when he prayed for the horse
[1:42:56] the horse began to walk the walk the
[1:42:58] right way need to walk now I don't know
[1:43:00] how much he got but them people got a
[1:43:01] lot more over his prayer
[1:43:07] but they they knew that they wanted to
[1:43:09] sell that horse because of selective
[1:43:11] breathing sometimes
[1:43:13] when they want a fast a strong horse I
[1:43:15] mean you know these horses that run in
[1:43:17] in the in the Kentucky Derby they breed
[1:43:19] these horses to be able to do that and
[1:43:22] sometimes they get them they run fast
[1:43:23] and and then next they know they put
[1:43:25] them to the side come on trying to find
[1:43:26] something else
[1:43:29] is selective breeding let me go a little
[1:43:31] further because this selective breeding
[1:43:33] is exactly amen what what brother
[1:43:35] Branham is talking about here because
[1:43:37] when I looked up the word breed back
[1:43:39] it's breeding of domestic but not
[1:43:42] exclusively animals in an attempt to
[1:43:45] achieve an animal breed with a phenotype
[1:43:48] see these are words that I don't
[1:43:49] understand amen uh in an attempt to
[1:43:52] achieve an animal breed of a with a
[1:43:54] phenotype that resembles a wild type and
[1:43:57] ancestor usually one that has gone
[1:43:59] extinct can I read that again breed back
[1:44:02] as breeding of domestic but not
[1:44:05] exclusively animals in an attempt to
[1:44:09] achieve an animal breed with a phenotype
[1:44:12] that resembles a wild-type ancestor
[1:44:15] usually one that's gone extinct
[1:44:20] now what the word phenotype is it's a
[1:44:22] set of observable characteristics or
[1:44:24] traits of an organization so they're
[1:44:26] trying to get certain traits to come out
[1:44:28] so we selectively breathe we put these
[1:44:30] two atoms together and we're trying to
[1:44:31] get certain traits to come out
[1:44:32] Hallelujah
[1:44:34] we're trying to get certain traits to
[1:44:36] come out if we can just get them
[1:44:37] together and when brother random say
[1:44:40] that the blood
[1:44:41] amen it breeds us back away from the
[1:44:45] rubbish of theology what God has done is
[1:44:48] through his word amen tried to get
[1:44:50] connected with a certain type of person
[1:44:52] and once he gets connected through the
[1:44:54] blood and through the Revelation where
[1:44:56] he can bring back the certain the same
[1:44:58] attributes that was in Adam and Eve
[1:45:02] hey the blood is what brings us back I'm
[1:45:05] brought back by the blood
[1:45:13] see science has to breathe back to
[1:45:15] create a stronger animal and study the
[1:45:17] traits of an ex of an extinct animal
[1:45:21] God is breeding back through the
[1:45:23] revealed word to bring it bring man back
[1:45:25] to where he fell from In the Garden of
[1:45:27] Eden
[1:45:28] and see when when it seems to so now
[1:45:30] when I look at the blood and I look at
[1:45:32] breeding back then I see the whole
[1:45:34] purpose of restoration
[1:45:37] let's go to Restoration Laboratory
[1:45:40] this is a form that's breeding back is a
[1:45:43] form of restoration
[1:45:45] oh blessed be the name of the Lord I
[1:45:49] thank God for the blood the blood the
[1:45:51] blood the blood
[1:45:54] here uh it says to restore means to
[1:45:57] bring back
[1:45:59] to restore a claim can be enforced now
[1:46:02] to bring anything back to its right for
[1:46:04] owner where it belongs
[1:46:07] therefore some way it went away from its
[1:46:09] right for owner and can wander around
[1:46:11] anywhere but to restore is to bring back
[1:46:14] to who really owns it
[1:46:16] or to bring it back to its natural
[1:46:19] estate
[1:46:21] amen where it was at the first time
[1:46:23] bring it back into its natural condition
[1:46:25] and in order to do this we have a right
[1:46:28] to enforce if there's a law to enforce
[1:46:32] this rightful condition of restoration
[1:46:33] to restore like if somebody stole some
[1:46:36] property and they're holding the
[1:46:38] property captive then you can take the
[1:46:41] law and go to this person and the law
[1:46:43] forces and forces this person to restore
[1:46:45] this property back to its natural owner
[1:46:47] into its prior or First Estate
[1:46:49] enforcement oh what a text how I like to
[1:46:53] have two days on that end Force see we
[1:46:57] could take a sermon right there enforce
[1:46:59] now brother Neville preach for us I'm
[1:47:01] just going to talk to you teach a Sunday
[1:47:03] school lesson so that it'll uh it'll get
[1:47:06] uh to continue on I hope with what we
[1:47:08] had what he had he says enforce then we
[1:47:12] are we have the privilege to enforce
[1:47:14] upon Satan the claims that God give us
[1:47:18] for God has a law and his word is is the
[1:47:22] law see brother brother Smiley hit that
[1:47:23] on last week that you know when they
[1:47:25] found a diamond it was against the law
[1:47:27] if it wasn't cut
[1:47:29] it was against off it wasn't because it
[1:47:31] had to be cut God has a law he says in
[1:47:34] the word the his word is the law and God
[1:47:37] in the word made certain claims to the
[1:47:39] church therefore we have a right
[1:47:43] my my my we have a right to force these
[1:47:47] claims upon Satan and say give it back
[1:47:54] you can tell the devil right now give it
[1:47:57] back
[1:47:58] give back my son give back my daughter
[1:48:01] get back my husband get back my wife
[1:48:04] give back my uncle my auntie give back
[1:48:06] my health give it back
[1:48:11] and look at this when you when now you
[1:48:13] you got to be the one to open your mouth
[1:48:14] and say it give it back Satan
[1:48:17] look at this look at this and he has to
[1:48:20] do it
[1:48:21] because we can take God's agent the Holy
[1:48:24] Spirit go right down on our knees say
[1:48:26] it's thus says the Lord he's got to give
[1:48:28] it up that's all because the holy
[1:48:30] spirit's dead I make him to it
[1:48:33] you not the one making the devil do it
[1:48:35] the Holy Ghost is there to make the
[1:48:38] devil give it back
[1:48:42] I love this the law of the land is the
[1:48:44] force it's by the land for the land by
[1:48:47] the law but but the law of the spirit of
[1:48:48] God is the force Satan to give up that
[1:48:51] which he is unrightfully
[1:48:53] deceitfully taken from God Souls of men
[1:48:57] my he took uh took from God Souls of
[1:49:00] women children sickness of the body he
[1:49:02] placed upon people where God Made Them
[1:49:04] In His Image to be like him and the
[1:49:06] church is given the rightful legal
[1:49:08] rights by the Bible to take the Holy
[1:49:10] Spirit and enforce this upon them amen I
[1:49:14] I I just say it give it back Satan
[1:49:17] give give back my health
[1:49:19] get back my child amen get get give it
[1:49:23] back praise God give back my family give
[1:49:27] back my niece give back my nephew
[1:49:32] give give it back they don't belong to
[1:49:35] you give it back
[1:49:39] the blood breeds these things back we're
[1:49:42] brought back by the blood
[1:49:45] I love this
[1:49:47] Hallelujah I told you I was going to get
[1:49:50] to this amen
[1:49:51] uh
[1:49:53] uh and I want to read this one out of uh
[1:49:55] out of Crisis the mystery of God
[1:49:56] revealed now when uh the prophet
[1:49:59] preached Christ is the Minister of God
[1:50:01] revealed he said you know I just I
[1:50:04] when you listen to a prophet speak and
[1:50:07] and this is this is different let me
[1:50:08] just kind of clear clarify because um
[1:50:11] you know the church has
[1:50:14] the church has gone off and just kind of
[1:50:16] focused on just uh maybe one element of
[1:50:19] a prophet and uh and that element is
[1:50:22] just somebody that would rise up and say
[1:50:23] thus saith the Lord and typically that
[1:50:25] thus saith the Lord is always you're
[1:50:27] going to get a blessing
[1:50:29] you're going to get a house you're gonna
[1:50:31] get a car you're gonna get a
[1:50:32] breakthrough you I mean you're gonna get
[1:50:34] this when you look in scripture meaning
[1:50:36] in prophets say thus say Lord You're
[1:50:37] Gonna Die
[1:50:39] dog's gonna lick your blood
[1:50:41] dog's gonna lick your wife blood
[1:50:44] it was a different type of Prophecy I
[1:50:46] mean now if somebody rolls up in the
[1:50:48] church and said that today people be
[1:50:49] running out of church false prophet Was
[1:50:52] Elijah false prophet no he's he told me
[1:50:54] yeah Ahab dog's gonna lick your blood
[1:50:57] right amen and the dogs licked his blood
[1:51:00] I mean so so you know we we we we we
[1:51:03] don't we don't sometimes the church
[1:51:04] world just don't understand really what
[1:51:06] a real Prophet is
[1:51:08] amen but uh but you know God sent us a
[1:51:10] prophet in this day and we and we have
[1:51:12] the word that has come from him one of
[1:51:14] the things that you know I'll tell you
[1:51:15] another thing about a prophet a a
[1:51:18] prophet is able to give us the word
[1:51:22] and tell us things that we would have
[1:51:23] never saw had God not elevated him to a
[1:51:27] certain height to be able to see these
[1:51:29] things now my example of this is when
[1:51:31] you pick up your Bible and you read
[1:51:34] Genesis
[1:51:36] God gave the word to a prophet
[1:51:40] the prophet Moses told us everything
[1:51:42] that happened in Genesis I mean with the
[1:51:46] with the with the first day of creation
[1:51:48] Moses went all the way back to the first
[1:51:50] day of creation he was not there
[1:51:56] how how could he write about what
[1:51:58] happened on the first Recreation when he
[1:52:00] was not there
[1:52:02] see that's what that's that's the
[1:52:03] ability of a prophet to go into areas
[1:52:06] that you'd never be able to go to now
[1:52:07] when brother Branham preached Christ as
[1:52:09] the mystery of God revealed he went all
[1:52:11] the way in the mind of God and said God
[1:52:12] had three things in his mind
[1:52:15] and he told us that these are three
[1:52:16] things God had in his mind from the
[1:52:18] beginning of time God wanted to have
[1:52:20] amen he says he wanted to have the
[1:52:21] preeminence in his people
[1:52:24] uh he said he said he wanted to reveal
[1:52:26] himself to his people he always wanted
[1:52:28] to reveal himself to his people he
[1:52:29] wanted to have the preeminist in his
[1:52:31] people the ability to be able to lead
[1:52:33] and guide his people and then he also
[1:52:35] said he wanted to restore his people
[1:52:37] back to eat in conditions again
[1:52:42] the same way Moses had the ability to go
[1:52:44] up and see the mind of God God use the
[1:52:46] prophet today go all the way back in the
[1:52:48] mind of God and tell us these three
[1:52:50] things God was looking for to do it
[1:52:51] restoring people back to eating
[1:52:54] conditions again can I can't yeah I
[1:52:56] don't know if we realize what Adam and
[1:52:57] Eve had
[1:52:59] Adam could if if you know here in
[1:53:02] Florida be so hot
[1:53:04] Adam could be sitting there maybe the
[1:53:06] son just just beating down I'm saying I
[1:53:08] just I don't feel like being in the sun
[1:53:10] right now tree move
[1:53:14] bring me some shade
[1:53:17] he don't feel like walking to go get no
[1:53:19] water
[1:53:20] stream come run right here let me just
[1:53:23] get some water from right here whatever
[1:53:25] I mean Adam was so powerful in the
[1:53:28] garden that when God got created the
[1:53:31] animals you know who named them
[1:53:36] the every name that we that we and and
[1:53:39] here's a good thing when Adam called it
[1:53:42] by his name that is still his name today
[1:53:46] God never went behind Adam said no no I
[1:53:48] don't want to call it that Adam it's
[1:53:49] going to be called it no whatever Adam
[1:53:51] said God honored God wants to take you
[1:53:55] back to that place that whatever you say
[1:54:01] that's why he told us in this world if
[1:54:04] you say to the mountain be thou removed
[1:54:08] and and cast into this to the Sea don't
[1:54:10] doubt in your heart you can have what
[1:54:13] you say the second Adam was restoring us
[1:54:17] through his blood back to the place that
[1:54:20] the first Adam lost
[1:54:22] we've been brought back
[1:54:26] by the blood
[1:54:29] and I'm telling I'm not waiting for
[1:54:31] something to happen before I start
[1:54:33] operating like that
[1:54:35] I start operating right now when I have
[1:54:37] need yesterday when that brother called
[1:54:39] that knee that's no we're gonna pray
[1:54:40] right now and pray with authority
[1:54:44] God we need a Red Sea to open now
[1:54:47] we're not taking No for a financial no
[1:54:50] we need something to happen now
[1:54:52] and God moved on the scene right then
[1:54:55] and man I love it when the Saints begin
[1:54:56] to pray
[1:54:59] here brother Brandon makes a statement
[1:55:01] here in the crisis the mystery of God
[1:55:02] revealed
[1:55:03] and I know that I I may have to I'm be
[1:55:06] coming to the close here but I have to
[1:55:08] pick this up because you know I'm gonna
[1:55:10] I'm gonna I'm Gonna Leave You a man with
[1:55:13] a very powerful thought
[1:55:15] but in order to leave you there I got to
[1:55:17] show you where brother Randall's
[1:55:18] bringing these things out of the
[1:55:19] scripture
[1:55:21] so here watch this I told you earlier
[1:55:23] you know the the the the the the
[1:55:25] ink when when when your sin is dropped
[1:55:28] into the Clorox it's like a drop of ink
[1:55:31] going into the Clorox it disintegrates
[1:55:33] never to be found again he says the ink
[1:55:37] becomes
[1:55:38] the Clorox
[1:55:41] he says the same way what happens when
[1:55:42] our sin is washed in the blood of Jesus
[1:55:44] and I said I said you become a
[1:55:46] representative of the blood when you've
[1:55:48] been washed by the blood of Jesus now
[1:55:50] watch this statement in Christ is the
[1:55:51] mystery of God revealed
[1:55:54] it says notice
[1:55:56] making it known
[1:55:57] now my there's just so much here
[1:56:00] we can just keep on going notice the
[1:56:03] tree of Christ the body in the garden
[1:56:05] making making this mystery known to this
[1:56:08] brought tree watch Redeemed by Christ
[1:56:09] the second Adam
[1:56:11] you believe he was going back home to
[1:56:13] Eden with his Fallen wife
[1:56:15] redeemed back home again so so like I
[1:56:19] said the blood brings us back to these
[1:56:22] places that place where Adam and Eve was
[1:56:24] at the very beginning before sin the he
[1:56:26] says going back uh
[1:56:28] oh let me let me uh just drop something
[1:56:31] let me hold me right there
[1:56:34] I mentioned to you all
[1:56:36] in this definition
[1:56:41] of breeding back it's breeding of
[1:56:43] domestic but not exclusively animals in
[1:56:45] an attempt to achieve an animal breed
[1:56:47] with a phenotype that resembles a
[1:56:49] wild-type ancestor usually one that has
[1:56:51] gone extinct now you know uh they they
[1:56:54] do a lot of studying of animals that
[1:56:56] have gone extinct just you know over
[1:56:58] time and um
[1:57:00] uh as I was just thinking about this
[1:57:03] this this this subject
[1:57:05] there is one animal
[1:57:07] that has gone extinct
[1:57:10] that they will never
[1:57:12] be able to breathe back
[1:57:19] never be able to breathe back now they
[1:57:22] tried this and they try that but they'll
[1:57:24] never be able to breed it back
[1:57:27] because what happened to this animal
[1:57:31] y'all not gonna let me preach but
[1:57:35] but what happened to this animal in the
[1:57:38] very beginning
[1:57:40] this animal is in the Garden of Eden and
[1:57:43] uh and this animal had the ability to
[1:57:45] reason this animal could talk just like
[1:57:48] humans could talk
[1:57:49] Hallelujah Satan knew that this animal
[1:57:52] had this capability so Satan got inside
[1:57:55] this animal and began to have a
[1:57:57] conversation with Eve now this was not
[1:57:59] the first day Eve and the serpent had a
[1:58:01] conversation they talked all the time
[1:58:04] hallelujah it's just like any adulterous
[1:58:07] act that happens you just don't fall in
[1:58:09] adultery you always having conversations
[1:58:11] with people before you get there
[1:58:13] amen but here here you know whether
[1:58:16] somebody you met online you still had a
[1:58:18] conversation with him you didn't just
[1:58:19] meet nobody in the parking lot somewhere
[1:58:20] and just no you don't do things like
[1:58:22] that it's a conversation that happens
[1:58:24] come on somebody but by here you know
[1:58:27] this animal called The Serpent amen is
[1:58:30] there in the garden in its original
[1:58:32] condition Hallelujah now evidently this
[1:58:36] serpent was standing on two feet just
[1:58:39] like human beings and it was the only
[1:58:41] animal in the garden that could mate
[1:58:42] with the human and have a human child
[1:58:44] hallelujah amen or meet with his own
[1:58:48] Serpent and have a serpent it was the
[1:58:50] only animal that was able to do that but
[1:58:52] through the curse of what happened in
[1:58:54] the Garden of Eden God took that animal
[1:58:57] and put it on his belly
[1:58:59] so they'll never be able to breed it
[1:59:01] back it looks like a snake today but one
[1:59:04] day it stood on two feet
[1:59:08] so so so really when we talk about what
[1:59:11] happened to Garden Eaton and people look
[1:59:13] here let me tell you something what God
[1:59:15] is doing is trying to breathe through
[1:59:17] the blood breed his people back away
[1:59:19] from the rubbish
[1:59:22] of theology
[1:59:26] because we got caught up in this rubbish
[1:59:29] they told us that it was an apple that
[1:59:32] Eve ate how did the apple how could the
[1:59:35] lady eat an apple and get pregnant
[1:59:37] how could that happen because if if if
[1:59:40] if people are not eating apples then
[1:59:42] getting pregnant that ain't what
[1:59:42] happened back then
[1:59:45] Hallelujah I mean we know we know how
[1:59:47] people get pregnant
[1:59:50] if the way people get pregnant today it
[1:59:52] was the same way they got pregnant back
[1:59:54] then
[1:59:55] come on somebody
[1:59:56] but what it was amen and even we know in
[1:59:59] the scripture that uh that this had to
[2:00:01] be uh the The Serpent and Eve got
[2:00:04] together there was an adulterous act
[2:00:05] that was the original sin that happened
[2:00:08] in the garden and adulterers act with
[2:00:10] the serpent
[2:00:11] Satan used a serpent hello somebody now
[2:00:14] now let me tell you something the Bible
[2:00:16] actually tells us very clearly that uh
[2:00:19] that that Cain was of that Wicked one
[2:00:26] Cain was not Adam's son the Bible said
[2:00:29] Cain was of that Wicked word and that's
[2:00:31] the scripture you find in the New
[2:00:32] Testament
[2:00:33] now how was it that the Believers in the
[2:00:35] New Testament had that Revelation but
[2:00:37] somehow we lost it
[2:00:39] God gotta breed us back from the rubbish
[2:00:42] of theology
[2:00:44] here here you know uh
[2:00:47] the Bible said came was on that weekend
[2:00:48] when you look through the genealogies in
[2:00:50] the scripture you'll see that Cain's
[2:00:52] name was never mentioned in Adam's
[2:00:54] genealogy
[2:00:55] come on somebody
[2:00:57] Abel's name was never mentioned the
[2:00:59] reason Abel's name was never mentioned
[2:01:00] because he never had children
[2:01:02] Cain killed him before he had children
[2:01:04] Hallelujah somebody right so so we see
[2:01:07] Adam Seth
[2:01:09] but we never see Kings and even when you
[2:01:11] go back to Genesis why do you see two
[2:01:13] different lines of of lineages
[2:01:15] they start from Cain they start from
[2:01:17] Adam
[2:01:18] come on somebody
[2:01:20] see it's something it's something
[2:01:22] greater we have to be we have to be
[2:01:23] brought back through the blood
[2:01:26] through the blood we brought back
[2:01:29] from the rubbish of theology
[2:01:35] I mean let me just say it like this if
[2:01:37] we can't get Genesis right I'm talking
[2:01:39] about the first two chapters
[2:01:41] how are we going to get the rest of the
[2:01:42] Bible right
[2:01:45] and even in the Book of Proverbs Solomon
[2:01:48] picked it up picked up the thought he'd
[2:01:49] say why does a a woman
[2:01:52] um
[2:01:53] commit an adulterous act and then wipe
[2:01:55] her mouth and say I ain't ate nothing
[2:01:59] why Solomon put them through what does
[2:02:01] what does what does does having a a
[2:02:03] commitment adultery have with eaten
[2:02:08] why Solomon put them two together
[2:02:11] amen hello somebody
[2:02:14] I I got I don't I I don't have the quote
[2:02:16] here uh I I I
[2:02:20] somebody asked brother random question
[2:02:21] now if the Bible Clearly say that Eve
[2:02:24] had a man from the Lord
[2:02:26] so how you say this was Satan's son you
[2:02:29] know but the Bible also say it was of
[2:02:31] that Wicked one
[2:02:33] so how you say that but the Bible says a
[2:02:35] man really said every person every
[2:02:37] person born in this world came from the
[2:02:39] Lord
[2:02:40] he said Adolf Hitler came from the Lord
[2:02:45] I got a direct quote every person no
[2:02:47] matter Pharaoh came from the Lord
[2:02:51] you want to know why because it takes a
[2:02:52] miracle for a child to be born on this
[2:02:54] Earth if God is not involved in the
[2:02:55] process of a birth
[2:02:58] we're gonna have a big problem
[2:03:02] you know when the woman's body goes into
[2:03:04] uh
[2:03:06] she just expands 10 centimeters that and
[2:03:09] it happens just for the child to be born
[2:03:11] then it goes back just like that who did
[2:03:14] that
[2:03:15] who did that
[2:03:18] ain't no pill she ain't nothing God does
[2:03:21] that to the woman's body so every every
[2:03:24] child has to come from God evil or good
[2:03:27] they still got to come from God
[2:03:34] the blood the blood the blood the blood
[2:03:36] the blood the blood is breeding us back
[2:03:37] I'm telling y'all the blood bringing us
[2:03:39] back
[2:03:40] amen amen from the rubbish of theology
[2:03:46] let me let me read this quote I'm I'm
[2:03:48] going to end here but I'll come back and
[2:03:50] pick this up
[2:03:52] I got good news and bad news
[2:03:55] good news I'm gonna pick it up and
[2:03:57] preach it again bad news it won't be
[2:03:59] next Sunday
[2:04:07] notice make it known now my there's just
[2:04:10] so much here we could just keep on going
[2:04:12] notice the tree of Christ the body in
[2:04:14] the garden make it now making this
[2:04:16] mystery known to this Bright Tree watch
[2:04:18] Redeemed by Christ
[2:04:19] the second Adam you believe he was going
[2:04:22] back home to Eden with his Fallen wife
[2:04:25] redeem back home again that's Christ and
[2:04:28] the church today taking his wife back
[2:04:32] see the threefold mystery now God
[2:04:34] manifested in Christ Christ manifested
[2:04:37] in the church all together to bring back
[2:04:40] the original Adam and Eve again man and
[2:04:43] woman which are one made out of the same
[2:04:46] blood and Same Spirit and everything
[2:04:48] else look at this watch this now the
[2:04:51] church
[2:04:53] is the blood of Christ
[2:04:56] by the spirit
[2:05:00] because the life is in the blood
[2:05:03] I want you to think about that now now I
[2:05:06] want you to just leave that there so you
[2:05:08] can just just meditate on that when
[2:05:10] brother Branham is writing his notes
[2:05:11] these are little things that he would
[2:05:13] jot down these just little notes and he
[2:05:15] just be preaching needs to be preaching
[2:05:16] then he just make this point then they
[2:05:18] keep on going but these are his little
[2:05:19] notes and when he makes that statement
[2:05:21] this is a note that the Holy Spirit
[2:05:22] inspired him to say the church is
[2:05:27] the blood of Christ by the spirit
[2:05:31] because the life is in the blood
[2:05:34] that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:05:36] that baptizes us into his body that
[2:05:38] recognizes only his body his flesh his
[2:05:40] word denomination won't ever touch that
[2:05:42] it's a revelation
[2:05:44] she knows it so did Eve know it but she
[2:05:46] failed but this one knows it and
[2:05:51] won't fall
[2:05:55] you want to know why we won't fall
[2:05:57] because we stay underneath
[2:06:00] the blood
[2:06:02] we don't come out from the blood we stay
[2:06:04] underneath the blood we realize what the
[2:06:06] blood has done for us
[2:06:08] she won't fall she's ordained Hallelujah
[2:06:12] she's ordained not to not fall she won't
[2:06:17] fall she's predestinated to it
[2:06:20] blessed is the man who God will not
[2:06:22] impute sin you ministers know what I'm
[2:06:24] uh what what I'm speaking of a couple
[2:06:26] doesn't you sitting sitting here see
[2:06:28] bless is the man who God will not impute
[2:06:30] sin David says know this redeeming back
[2:06:33] with him going home back to eternal life
[2:06:36] in a human body eating drinking living
[2:06:39] forever Isaiah said they building houses
[2:06:41] and inhabit them plant Vineyards and eat
[2:06:43] the fruit they'll not build in another
[2:06:45] take it
[2:06:47] the children won't take it but they'll
[2:06:48] be there with their offspring
[2:06:51] my God amen amen what what we got to
[2:06:54] look forward to he'll he'll built it and
[2:06:56] stay there amen amen he don't build in
[2:06:59] another eat he builds and eats himself

[2:07:10] the crops I mean he done watched over he
[2:07:12] done water he doesn't kept all the weeds
[2:07:15] out and then all of a sudden when it's
[2:07:17] time to get fruit out the field he'll
[2:07:19] come to Phyllis I mean these these uh I
[2:07:21] think it was the Philistines they would
[2:07:22] come and just take everything from him

[2:08:15] original Adam and Eve again for death is

[2:08:22] that death has been paid and now by
[2:08:24] faith we're resurrected with him sitting
[2:08:25] in Heavenly places right now looking
[2:08:27] back to what redeemed us waiting for the
[2:08:29] husband to come to march on home with
[2:08:31] him
[2:08:32] three-fold purpose of God manifested in
[2:08:34] Adam and Eve and every prophet and down
[2:08:37] Through the Ages and he that has become
[2:08:39] he that was he which is and he which is
