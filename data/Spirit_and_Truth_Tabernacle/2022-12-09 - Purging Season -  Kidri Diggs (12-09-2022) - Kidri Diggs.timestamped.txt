[14:17] at the end of the night maybe like
[14:18] around 10 o'clock when we're coming out
[14:22] I actually saw like
[14:24] like kind of by the canal but I thought
[14:27] it was like a flashlight or something I
[14:29] turned I started driving like a minute
[14:31] after I was driving
[14:33] um Joseph is like Pops that was a car
[14:36] that was on the side of the of the canal
[14:40] and I saw two lights I was like it's not
[14:42] playing like stop playing and we're like
[14:46] you know what if you saw that I have to
[14:49] turn around just just in case and if you
[14:51] turn if I turn around and there was no
[14:53] car unit Falls
[14:54] that's literally what we said you know
[14:57] um he's like well I saw a car
[14:59] let me be a false prophet so we turned
[15:03] around and like like he saw we get there
[15:06] and there's a guy inside the car I only
[15:09] by God's grace that
[15:12] um the the truck did not go all the way
[15:15] to the canal it was on the side hanging
[15:18] by the tires we get there the guy is
[15:21] he to me he was a little under the
[15:24] influence not super drunk but he was on
[15:26] the phone and not paying attention
[15:28] talking to his girlfriend and that's how
[15:30] he lost control so I went in there and I
[15:33] pulled him out he couldn't barely get
[15:35] him out but I pulled him out and we
[15:37] called 9-1-1 and when I called number
[15:39] one Joseph put the window down he said
[15:42] he said pops can I just go out there and
[15:45] pray for him and and and and and
[15:49] um and thank the Lord and I was like
[15:53] I I wasn't thinking of praying for him I
[15:56] wanted to get this guy like out so I
[15:58] just I was like well that's what you
[16:00] want to do man you you come out here and
[16:03] you pray and this is what and as he
[16:06] started there was something that was
[16:07] something was missed but when he started

[16:45] people that they get the card left or
[16:48] latched on right without it falling into

[16:56] vehicle to this man father God and Lord

[18:32] um just
[18:33] um it was unexpected brother Jose for
[18:36] you all to travel there and see that man
[18:38] uh Hanging On The Edge there but uh just
[18:42] the way all that worked out I'm just
[18:44] wondering you know that that I know he
[18:46] might not have been also but my God see
[18:48] a young man like that praying
[18:52] a fight I think I think it did something
[18:54] for the man when he went home
[18:57] I think it did something for him when he
[18:59] went home and just appreciate Brother
[19:02] Joseph being sensitive you know to the
[19:04] spirit of the Lord and and uh just
[19:07] praying from his heart you know for the
[19:09] gentleman and you know and if we could
[19:11] just touch a life uh then our living is
[19:14] not in vain amen so I was just blessed
[19:18] by that testimony what but what a
[19:20] wonderful testimony may never see y'all
[19:22] again but that was enough to cause him
[19:26] to think on his ways
[19:28] amen praise the Lord
[19:30] amen Let's uh uh have tonight's uh
[19:35] announcements and um and then we will

[20:37] to do that but also we want to encourage
[20:39] you have your young people bring

[31:12] chapter
[31:21] you know I I just I just want to express
[31:23] to you all amen good to see some South
[31:25] Carolina people in the house now y'all
[31:28] from Florida but you stay in South
[31:29] Carolina you know so good to see South
[31:31] Carolina in the house
[31:33] laughs
[31:35] amen
[31:37] amen praise the Lord but you know church
[31:40] one thing I'm realizing more and more if
[31:42] when you when you're going through
[31:44] things
[31:45] the place of strength is in the word
[31:48] because the word cannot change
[31:51] it cannot fail it cannot be altered so
[31:54] if you can find yourself in the word you
[31:57] can receive that strength
[31:59] amen so let's just go to Deuteronomy the
[32:02] 8th chapter verse let's just start it uh
[32:05] verse one
[32:06] the Bible says
[32:09] all the Commandments which are
[32:11] commandedly this day shall ye observe to
[32:14] do that ye may live and multiply
[32:18] and go in and possess the land which the
[32:21] Lord swear unto your fathers and thou
[32:24] shall remember all the way which the
[32:27] Lord thy God LED thee these 40 years in
[32:32] the wilderness to Humble thee and to
[32:36] prove thee to know what was in thine
[32:39] heart
[32:40] whether thou wouldest keep his
[32:44] Commandments
[32:46] now if I could add something in there
[32:48] just for Spirit of the truth to make the
[32:51] Writ go up to leave the building and be
[32:54] out of school
[32:57] to see what was in thy heart
[33:01] whether you would continue or not
[33:07] and listen what he said he said and he
[33:10] humble thee and suffered thee to hunger
[33:14] and fairly with Manna which thou knowest
[33:17] not neither did the fathers know that he
[33:21] made that he might make thee know that
[33:24] man do not live by bread alone but by
[33:28] every word that proceedeth out of the
[33:30] mouth of the Lord those Man live
[33:34] hey man let's go to
[33:35] um Saint John chapter 15.
[33:45] St John chapter 15.
[33:49] we're also going to start at verse 1.
[33:55] the Bible says I am the True Vine and my
[34:00] father is the husbandman every branch in
[34:02] me that beareth not fruit he taketh away
[34:06] and every branch that bearth fruit he
[34:09] purges it that it may bring forth more
[34:12] fruit
[34:13] [Music]
[34:14] now you are clean through the word which
[34:18] I have spoken unto you abide in me and I
[34:20] in you as the branch cannot bear fruit
[34:23] of itself except it abide in the vine
[34:26] nor more can ye accept ye abide in me
[34:31] may the lord of the Blessed reason of
[34:33] his word you can have your seats
[34:38] Amen to tonight if I if I can use for
[34:40] assault
[34:42] I'll call us tonight purging season
[34:46] purging season
[34:48] and you know uh one thing about what's
[34:51] going on Church
[34:53] um there's not a lack of word we have
[34:56] plenty of word
[34:57] there's nothing wrong with the message
[34:59] the message is still the same you know
[35:02] there's nothing wrong with God he's
[35:04] still God
[35:05] but what's happening is the trials are
[35:07] getting more intense
[35:09] and along with our trials in this season
[35:14] we're in God has not giving us an
[35:17] explanation
[35:18] we're just going through it
[35:20] and you know in scenes we're going
[35:22] through we're not even ready for it
[35:24] Hallelujah and you know we have to go
[35:27] through these things but at the same
[35:29] time what God is doing he's checking our
[35:32] attitudes
[35:33] and you know a lot of times what we what
[35:35] we do uh and I know if I could speak
[35:38] personally what we do we when we go
[35:41] through things the first thing we do is
[35:43] we zero everything in on that ain't
[35:46] nothing but the devil all right
[35:48] but let's go back to what the scripture
[35:50] says the Bible says remember how I led
[35:54] you
[35:55] these 40 years so the devil wasn't the
[35:59] one in control of the journey God was
[36:01] and church we're no different amen God
[36:04] is in control of our journey so even
[36:07] though things it doesn't look like it's
[36:09] things that a Christian should go to
[36:11] Let's realize this we're on a Proving
[36:14] Ground
[36:15] and we have to be proved by God
[36:18] hallelujah but a lot of times the
[36:20] proving by God first must start it must
[36:24] go through the realm of humility
[36:28] Hallelujah and humility starts with
[36:31] being stripped
[36:34] Hallelujah I know what I'm talking about
[36:35] hallelujah hallelujah humility deals
[36:39] with Hallelujah people looking at you in
[36:41] a different light even when you ain't in
[36:44] nothing wrong
[36:46] you ain't even got no explanation for
[36:48] what you're going through you feel like
[36:51] defending yourself but what God is doing
[36:53] is humbling you
[36:55] [Applause]
[36:55] [Music]
[36:56] Hallelujah but not only is he humbling
[36:59] you he's purging you at the same time
[37:02] because it's that trial that's going to
[37:05] bring things out of you that been in
[37:08] there that nobody could see even though
[37:11] you're a born again Christian
[37:18] see I think I think we we forgot about
[37:22] that part all right that there is a
[37:25] purging for the believer
[37:27] Paul said Hallelujah even the prophet of
[37:29] God said in the church age book that
[37:31] there is a measure of suffering for the
[37:34] bride
[37:35] but what we do amen we we want flowers
[37:38] all the time we want candy not just any
[37:41] kind of candy candy with peanuts in it
[37:45] candy with caramel I mean something
[37:47] that's real real sweet amen because
[37:50] we're in a time right now where you're
[37:52] gonna have to believe what you say you
[37:54] believe
[37:55] Hallelujah and you're gonna have to live
[37:57] by what you say you believe amen and
[38:00] church as we look in the Bible amen and
[38:02] you know we read Deuteronomy amen let's
[38:05] go back there real quick you know as we
[38:07] look Church you know we think about it
[38:10] why did God take 400 years
[38:14] he could have easily brought them into
[38:15] the promised land God has a purpose you
[38:19] know church he he he God allows things
[38:22] to happen at an appointed time because
[38:25] certain people have to be in position
[38:27] Hallelujah so we want it quickly we want
[38:30] it right now but that might not be
[38:32] somebody who ain't here who's supposed
[38:35] to be here
[38:38] somebody here who's not supposed to be
[38:41] here so what God will do God allows
[38:44] things to happen so people's perspective
[38:47] can change
[38:53] you say it like this church we know God
[38:55] is real
[38:56] Hallelujah this man didn't see God do
[38:59] miraculous things the sister different
[39:01] ones all of you you've seen God do
[39:04] miraculous things so what's going on
[39:06] right now what's going on why we ain't
[39:08] in the place that we've been praying
[39:10] about what's happening there's a Persian
[39:12] going on
[39:14] Hallelujah because one thing I want you
[39:16] to understand if I could speak
[39:18] personally if I could speak like I'm a
[39:20] part of the family the burden of a new
[39:22] building is not his burden
[39:27] it's supposed to be the burden of the
[39:29] people
[39:30] [Applause]
[39:33] but what we're doing we're sitting back
[39:35] we live I want that brother Jack uh
[39:37] about the building yet I wonder if he
[39:39] went by this place I wonder if he went
[39:40] by why don't you go
[39:43] oh please
[39:45] why don't you ask God to lead you
[39:48] see Church the Wilderness holy the whole
[39:51] thing about the Wilderness it was
[39:53] weeding out who was real believers
[39:56] it was weeding out who really stood with
[39:59] the message of Moses because when they
[40:01] gave out when they came out everybody
[40:03] was like I'm a Believer
[40:06] to those trials started to come right
[40:08] now all right all right what church you
[40:12] go to Spirit and true
[40:13] the experience you had to almost revert
[40:16] back to his humble beginnings
[40:18] I was there I know what I'm talking
[40:20] about
[40:21] Hallelujah we look like we had just
[40:23] started that's what it looked like right
[40:25] now look like we're back down in Lantana
[40:27] at least the lantana hallelujah look
[40:29] like we're back down there in a
[40:31] storefront Hollywood but what is God
[40:33] doing God is proving the money
[40:36] and he's hungry he's letting people
[40:38] hallelujah prove what's really in their
[40:41] heart
[40:42] by bringing it back down to simplicity
[40:45] can you serve God Hallelujah in a simple
[40:49] manner
[40:51] yeah bro Jack right now I'll tell you
[40:52] right now if God will move this thing
[40:54] into a big old building Harley you'll
[40:56] get more members than you can have
[40:58] cause they want to be a part of
[41:01] something big but let's be a part of
[41:02] something small first
[41:04] Hallelujah let's be a part of the
[41:06] foundation
[41:07] let's be a part of things Hallelujah
[41:09] that's building it up so when it gets
[41:12] shaky it can't fall
[41:13] Hallelujah
[41:18] but Hallelujah when I look at this and I
[41:20] think about a person the Bible says
[41:22] hallelujah in Hebrews that uh wants to
[41:25] worship us Purge there should be no more
[41:28] sacrifice for sin Hallelujah there
[41:30] should be no more conscience of sin amen
[41:32] no more desire of sin what's your Purge
[41:35] amen but I want to take it a little bit
[41:37] deeper than that because a lot of times
[41:39] when we look at that scripture right
[41:41] there we're talking about only our
[41:42] desire the purging of wanting and
[41:45] sanctification but let's go a little bit
[41:47] deeper amen I want to tell you just like
[41:50] God had to tell me that there are some
[41:52] things inside of you that only a child
[41:54] can break out
[41:59] [Music]
[42:01] okay if we start with the children of
[42:03] Israel let's go down the journey
[42:06] God begins to deliver them with signs
[42:08] and wonders don't we have that in the
[42:10] church
[42:11] sign the ones you just you just heard
[42:12] the testimony amen
[42:14] turning around and praying over a man
[42:17] and pretty much saving his life
[42:19] we come back with the testimony Harley
[42:21] we know God is with us amen but what
[42:24] about in the times when you don't feel
[42:26] like it
[42:27] is he still God
[42:29] is your church still the place you want
[42:31] to be how do you still love everybody
[42:33] Hallelujah
[42:35] but Turf when we look at the purging
[42:37] amen what was God doing as soon as God
[42:40] began to deliver God began to show signs
[42:43] and wonders everybody even some of the
[42:46] Egyptians are saying I'm a Believer
[42:49] I'm out of here let's go
[42:51] they even start going to pharaoh and say
[42:53] how long you gonna try to fight against
[42:55] their God
[42:56] we didn't lost everything let's get
[42:59] about it let them people go
[43:01] holy church and even Hallelujah the
[43:05] Egyptians started to give them some of
[43:07] their blessings some of their materials
[43:09] now if I can let's go into the scripture
[43:12] Hallelujah the Bible said let's tap
[43:14] ourselves into the word the Bible said
[43:16] Moses begin to how do you tell the
[43:18] people to give but then when was the
[43:20] last time your pastor said the words of
[43:22] Moses
[43:23] the needs have been met don't nobody
[43:25] give no more
[43:27] oh
[43:31] it's in the Bible am I in the book
[43:34] Moses said the knees have been met we
[43:37] don't need you to give no more we don't
[43:39] live in that day because we got closer
[43:41] brother Brown oh don't take up no don't
[43:44] call for money and don't just don't do
[43:45] this is that not a cause
[43:51] but we selectively Hallelujah give
[43:54] according to how we want to give
[43:57] Church you know what we could really
[43:59] shake this thing and make things happen
[44:01] if we really want to Hallelujah and I'll
[44:04] be the first one to say hallelujah I've
[44:06] learned to give more Hallelujah because
[44:09] honey is a twofold purpose in that
[44:11] scripture it says give and what it shall
[44:13] be given unto you Hallelujah but a lot
[44:17] of times when we look at is what we're
[44:18] giving what you give it ain't nearly
[44:20] what you can receive
[44:22] when it comes to God what you give and
[44:24] don't even measure up what God has for
[44:27] you
[44:30] but what I look at and I see amen that
[44:32] God
[44:34] in in in a season of purge and what it
[44:36] does is
[44:37] whoever you are and whatever you are is
[44:41] gonna just come out of you
[44:45] as the trial is coming forth
[44:48] whatever's in you is going to come out
[44:51] you remember brother Brandon said he
[44:53] wanted to take his daughters and and
[44:54] move him up on the Indian Reservation
[44:56] he said but then God began to deal with
[44:58] him and tell him said whatever's in that
[45:01] child it's gonna come out whether it's
[45:03] on the Indian Reservation whether it's
[45:05] down in the Gated Community or wherever
[45:07] they at whatever's in him it's gonna
[45:09] come out
[45:10] and you know that's what we're afraid of
[45:11] we're afraid to turn it loose and let
[45:14] God have it Hallelujah you know we're
[45:17] afraid to just say yeah that's my child
[45:19] but I'm praying for it
[45:21] yeah that's my child but I'm praying for
[45:23] him we're afraid how people gonna look
[45:25] at us and you know what's happening it
[45:27] ain't just your child going through it's
[45:29] you being purged
[45:34] oh cause you got an image to uphold
[45:40] I'm a Believer
[45:41] that I can't have my child I hear my
[45:44] child you know my child gotta let him go
[45:46] through it holy just to Humble you
[45:49] so you can show them what Real Love Is
[45:53] see real love is to be able to love
[45:55] somebody when you don't agree with what
[45:57] they doing
[45:57] [Music]
[45:58] [Applause]
[46:04] you gotta have something within you to
[46:06] do that
[46:07] [Music]
[46:09] but look first things first God began to
[46:11] deliver to people with many signs and
[46:13] wonders and after it was all over you
[46:15] know no more signs and wonders they just
[46:17] had to walk with God and as they began
[46:19] to walk with God what's starting to stir
[46:22] up their past
[46:23] they started to think about where they
[46:25] came from first things first what was in
[46:27] them it started to come out complaining
[46:30] oh we had melons in Egypt all we had
[46:33] just oh we had that what happened that
[46:35] trial brought out that they were an
[46:37] ungrateful people wow
[46:40] amen amen amen
[46:42] and as they went along they murmured
[46:44] about this they mummered about that they
[46:46] mumbled and mummered and mummered and
[46:47] even to the place that God told Moses
[46:49] Moses move aside
[46:51] I kill all of them but God had a man in
[46:55] place Hallelujah that would intercede
[46:57] for the people in the purgencies
[47:01] and I said even right now God has a
[47:03] Ministry in place that will intercede
[47:05] for the people in the purging season
[47:07] when you get mad at skip church when you
[47:09] get mad at the ministers don't shake
[47:11] their hand God will see the word
[47:13] hallelujah that'll keep the plague off
[47:15] of you amen he'll see no word he'll have
[47:18] the ministry standing between the people
[47:20] hallelujah and death amen just like you
[47:23] did in the scripture oh my but when you
[47:27] think about being purged God will hold
[47:29] you purging the children of Israel and
[47:32] we look at it and we say man
[47:34] that wasn't nothing but the doubt
[47:36] or what
[47:38] it was the leading of the Lord because
[47:41] what God was doing sister Brown he was
[47:43] cleaning the church out he was showing
[47:45] all that cried to be Abraham see when
[47:47] Abraham's seed
[47:49] and the more intense the trial got the
[47:53] more people showed who they were
[47:56] oh
[47:57] see it breaks me to job and we know the
[48:00] story of Job
[48:02] you know what we can preach on Joe for
[48:04] hours and hours but what about when it
[48:05] comes to your house
[48:07] let me tell you something amen I know
[48:09] personally you will go through things
[48:11] simply because it's a bit
[48:14] between God and the devil
[48:17] [Applause]
[48:21] you ain't doing nothing wrong
[48:23] you ain't talked about nobody
[48:26] you praying you paying your tithes
[48:28] you're coming to church but simply
[48:30] because the devil challenged God about
[48:32] you
[48:34] a simple bet
[48:37] a week
[48:41] when God has already told the devil
[48:45] I want to go ahead and try this one try
[48:48] this one but what I want you to realize
[48:50] Hallelujah God has a way that he looks
[48:52] at you before you even go through it go
[48:55] back and read it amen before they eat
[48:57] job even went through the trial God
[49:00] testified over job to the devil
[49:04] God told the Devil he's perfect
[49:09] now if I'm going through a battle in God
[49:11] and already told the devil I'm perfect
[49:13] how can I lose
[49:14] [Applause]
[49:18] oh my I'm being purged unto perfection
[49:23] oh my that word perfect means complete
[49:27] without fault without error hey man and
[49:30] if God comes and tells the devil simply
[49:33] on a bet that there's none like him in
[49:35] all the Earth
[49:39] and we go through it and we complain and
[49:41] complain and complain law oil and this
[49:44] and we didn't prayed about this we
[49:45] didn't fast and we didn't do this let me
[49:47] tell you if it ain't been 25 years shut
[49:49] up and keep praying foreign
[49:57] look at the whole purpose of it what was
[49:59] he doing one he was proven to the devil
[50:02] Hallelujah that you can't curse what I
[50:04] blessed even though they going through
[50:06] something amen just because you're going
[50:08] through it that doesn't mean there's a
[50:10] curse on your life amen going through it
[50:12] means that you're being strengthened and
[50:14] Hallelujah
[50:15] Hallelujah because the Bible says amen
[50:18] even when you're bringing Full fruit
[50:21] she will bring you for fruit we're
[50:24] serving the lord we're in we're in a
[50:26] Heavenly atmosphere we're here people
[50:28] are being struggling in the Lord even
[50:30] when you're in your purpose
[50:32] God said that he'll Purge you that you
[50:35] bring forth more fruit holy what does
[50:38] purging means let's look at it Church
[50:42] think about a man filled with the Holy
[50:44] Ghost still has to be purged
[50:46] a sister filled with the Holy Ghost
[50:48] still has to be purged now I know that's
[50:51] probably against the way some of y'all
[50:52] think
[50:55] everything good ain't nothing wrong with
[50:58] me you want to bet
[51:00] you want a you don't you don't
[51:03] fight until you get the whole thing
[51:08] because without the Holy Ghost you will
[51:10] lie down and accept whatever comes your
[51:12] way but it's the holy ghost that allows
[51:14] you to get back up and say no I'm not
[51:16] going to stay in this condition
[51:17] Hallelujah
[51:20] [Applause]
[51:21] oh you look at Persian Church the word
[51:23] Purge it means to cleanse or rid of
[51:27] impurities
[51:28] so you mean to tell me Hallelujah that
[51:31] the Bible says even when I'm bringing
[51:33] for fruit I got impurities in me
[51:39] and you know amen is on that one huh
[51:44] we are striving for Perfection
[51:47] we are trying to get back to everything
[51:50] Adam lost and I'm here to say that it's
[51:53] here but we got to have the right
[51:55] attitude to possess it
[51:57] amen Church look at how we did
[52:00] throughout all the scriptures everybody
[52:01] look uh Moses was ordained to be a
[52:05] prophet amen but how did he get in his
[52:08] position he had to be purged
[52:12] the gift of Deliverance was already in
[52:14] him everything he needed was already
[52:16] there but God had to put him in a
[52:19] position that he could be humble enough
[52:21] to be used
[52:24] every Power he would need every spoken
[52:27] word Authority he would need
[52:30] people naturally he would need was
[52:33] already in him the thing God wanted was
[52:36] all of it to operate under humility
[52:39] so he had to bring him through a purging
[52:42] first Hallelujah so what did he do amen
[52:44] he let him start real high in the palace
[52:47] house
[52:52] he let him get the best of the best
[52:54] purse the best food the best clothing
[52:57] the best women the best service
[52:59] everything you could offer was the best
[53:01] Hallelujah did his mama come to him and
[53:04] brought him real down low and say you
[53:05] know you're one of us
[53:07] [Applause]
[53:11] purging started right there
[53:16] But Not only was a purging it was now
[53:19] approving
[53:20] because what his mama was saying to him
[53:23] God was going to prove it to him that
[53:24] she was lying
[53:27] but it had to start on the inside first
[53:29] Hallelujah and now you think about Moses
[53:32] Moses had the best of the best he was he
[53:34] was throw his military man he could
[53:36] fight he could do all these things and
[53:38] then his mama come in and shake his
[53:40] world
[53:41] this woman ain't your mama I'm your mom
[53:46] I know you think I'm just a servant
[53:48] taking care of you but no you came from
[53:50] me you're one of us and probably pull
[53:52] out of Israelite garlic
[53:54] [Music]
[53:57] Hallelujah and there was something
[54:00] inside of Moses that could identify with
[54:03] what she was saying he didn't even know
[54:05] where it was coming from but he felt the
[54:07] connection Hallelujah church that just
[54:09] like you and me amen we could have
[54:11] followed Billy Graham we could have
[54:13] followed all rivals but what are we
[54:15] follow we're following the voice of a
[54:17] man some of us have never seen
[54:20] oh my God yes what is it it's a walk of
[54:24] humility
[54:29] because most of the things the prophet
[54:31] talk about in his own personal Journey
[54:33] we can't prove it we have to take it by
[54:35] faith that's not exactly right
[54:37] and the only way you could do that is it
[54:40] is is you walk through the Walk of
[54:42] humility
[54:43] trust me I haven't been there on the
[54:45] mountain and looking for Eagles rocking
[54:46] all these things and all the stuff all
[54:48] the pictures you got and then you get
[54:50] there you say
[54:52] my picture don't look like this
[54:57] y'all haven't been there to Speedo
[54:59] Canyon
[55:00] pictures we got with eagles rocking all
[55:02] that stuff you get there ain't none of
[55:03] it is gone
[55:04] and the first thing the devil did do I
[55:07] don't know about y'all was the first
[55:08] thing he ever did to me
[55:12] hmm
[55:13] I wonder if it's true
[55:16] I wonder if any of is true
[55:19] but where's your hope your hope and your
[55:21] strength is in the word don't never let
[55:24] the devil have the word the last word
[55:25] Satan will speak but if you're a
[55:28] Believer God will always follow every
[55:30] trial with the word
[55:31] and then church at that moment I'm up on
[55:33] I'm up on the mountain amen it was me
[55:36] brother Israel and another brother named
[55:37] Samuel amen it was Israel the nation
[55:40] Hallelujah Samuel the prophet and me the
[55:42] bride Hallelujah
[55:44] and we were all on top of the mountain
[55:45] they said here it is brother Jesus I say
[55:47] ain't nothing on that rock that's just a
[55:48] plain Rock he said it was red dead he
[55:51] said but the fanatical people didn't
[55:52] carved it out oh man now I just got to
[55:56] believe in something that I've always
[55:59] seen but I can't prove it
[56:04] how do you prove this message
[56:06] by your life
[56:08] you don't prove it by your pictures
[56:12] you don't prove it by your quotes
[56:15] you prove it by your life
[56:17] that's why I don't care what they say
[56:19] brother Brandon this brother Brandon he
[56:20] had this he did this ain't happened that
[56:22] ain't happen I can tell you what get
[56:23] happened I was changed
[56:26] Hallelujah I can tell you what did
[56:28] happen the places I used to go I don't
[56:30] go no more the thoughts I used to think
[56:32] I don't think no more the stuff I used
[56:34] to say I don't say no more you know why
[56:36] cause I've been purged
[56:39] Hallelujah and I'm in a season amen
[56:41] where God is still cleaning
[56:46] and you know what I was coming down the
[56:48] mountain brother jagging and the devil's
[56:50] a c uh-huh all these years and now you
[56:52] get there ain't nothing there to it
[56:55] then God says
[56:57] blessed is he who believe and have not
[56:59] seen
[57:02] y'all want to talk about a praise dance
[57:06] Hallelujah
[57:08] because God began to show me amen some
[57:11] things you got to get it like Paul got
[57:12] earlier he wasn't there with the
[57:15] disciples but he got the same
[57:16] Revelations once he contacted the
[57:18] Messiah
[57:19] [Applause]
[57:21] Patricia we could just look at the
[57:22] purging for a minute it says to cleanse
[57:25] or rid of impurities to cleanse a rid of
[57:28] impurities foreign matter
[57:31] wow some of y'all got foreign
[57:44] first thing you do when you're preparing
[57:46] a dish
[57:47] you want a clean pot
[57:50] you want a clean pot cause you no doubt
[57:52] you're gonna make it dirty But first you
[57:55] gotta start with something clean Harley
[57:57] you start adding your ingredients and
[57:59] mixing and everything and doing this and
[58:01] doing that and once you get that dish
[58:03] complete hallelujah what do you do
[58:06] if you're gonna use it again it has to
[58:09] be purged
[58:11] it has to be clean it has to be washed
[58:13] it has to be made fit for the use of
[58:16] something else to go further with what
[58:17] you desire
[58:19] and that's what God does hallelujah he
[58:22] will allow us to get in situations he'll
[58:25] allow us to go through trials because
[58:27] there's things in us that need to be
[58:29] purged out
[58:31] Hallelujah
[58:33] none of us knew that Abraham was a liar
[58:36] but God did foreign
[58:42] didn't know it Hallelujah all of his
[58:44] service Hallelujah they didn't know it
[58:46] but God did
[58:48] holy so what did God do earlier God put
[58:51] him in a situation Hallelujah well what
[58:54] was in him that nobody else see could be
[58:56] purged out
[58:58] what was it it was a child man came in
[59:00] to say I want your wife
[59:05] and the thought of him losing his wife
[59:07] made him tell a lie
[59:12] but first of all he lied because he was
[59:15] protecting himself
[59:17] that's not humility yeah
[59:22] that's not humility is protecting
[59:24] himself
[59:25] so what God did God put him in the place
[59:27] Hallelujah well he felt like he was
[59:29] inferior amen even though he was the
[59:32] father of Nations
[59:34] now this is what I want to challenge you
[59:36] with where are you getting those
[59:38] thoughts of fear from ain't coming from
[59:40] God
[59:43] they're not even a part of your journey
[59:48] you create
[59:50] your own situations of fear
[59:53] because God is not giving us the spirit
[59:56] of fear so where is it coming from your
[59:59] imagination
[1:00:10] church if we look we this is the reason
[1:00:12] why we have to be Purge
[1:00:15] because fear takes over our journey and
[1:00:18] we start to do things that doesn't
[1:00:19] reflect the character of God
[1:00:22] if you look Church Adam and Eve were
[1:00:24] created what in the image of God Adam
[1:00:27] was created in the image of God the
[1:00:29] likeness of God hallelujah and nothing
[1:00:32] could stop him nothing could challenge
[1:00:34] him until he didn't look at himself like
[1:00:37] God looked at him anymore
[1:00:40] and as Adam you know God had no reason
[1:00:44] to purge him because he was just like
[1:00:46] him our life he felt like him everything
[1:00:49] else uh God did he could do it through
[1:00:52] Adam
[1:00:53] it wasn't until Hallelujah Adam began to
[1:00:57] think different that he had to become
[1:00:59] purged
[1:01:01] and what caused the purging Hollywood
[1:01:04] him listening to something that God
[1:01:06] didn't say
[1:01:08] [Applause]
[1:01:10] and when we listen to things that God
[1:01:13] didn't say hallelujah we're really
[1:01:16] operating under a measure of fear
[1:01:20] because you look Church Hallelujah God
[1:01:23] comes down in the cooler today like he
[1:01:25] always did Adam and Eve had seen what
[1:01:28] was the first thing they did they ran
[1:01:29] from God
[1:01:30] that Comfort they never read from God
[1:01:32] before now all of a sudden they running
[1:01:34] from God what was it amen things had
[1:01:37] changed Hallelujah church I'll tell you
[1:01:40] right now if you look over your life
[1:01:41] Hallelujah what's stopping your progress
[1:01:43] spiritually is the spirit of fear
[1:01:47] praise the Lord because fear is the
[1:01:50] first attribute of sin after the fall
[1:01:54] my God
[1:01:58] yeah the original attribute was adultery
[1:02:01] Hallelujah but after adultery man began
[1:02:04] to operate in fear
[1:02:06] and everything he did was fear
[1:02:08] everything he talked about Was Fear all
[1:02:11] of his situation was products of fear
[1:02:15] because man never knew fear
[1:02:17] and what I love about God God always
[1:02:20] challenges our fear
[1:02:23] amen he always challenged your fear
[1:02:25] that's why you go through the trials you
[1:02:26] go through
[1:02:27] Church let's let's understand this
[1:02:29] you're not going through the things that
[1:02:31] you don't have a problem with
[1:02:36] it that's not a test
[1:02:40] amen
[1:02:42] if you never smoke you never drink God
[1:02:44] ain't gonna take it he'll sit you in a
[1:02:46] room put that on the table you look at
[1:02:48] it like like it's a thing of Kool-Aid it
[1:02:50] don't even bother you
[1:02:52] but if you the person who used to smoke
[1:02:54] out
[1:02:55] use a person who used to take it down
[1:02:58] God allow you Hallelujah
[1:03:01] to get in a situation where you got to
[1:03:04] know what you're supposed to know about
[1:03:06] yourself
[1:03:10] and let me say this fear will have you
[1:03:12] running from your deliverance
[1:03:49] wow all right we don't
[1:03:51] praise God
[1:03:52] church one thing about it
[1:03:55] Satan he wants you to run from your
[1:03:58] deliverances
[1:04:00] I remember one time I I like telling his
[1:04:03] testimony because it's funny to me
[1:04:05] I mean one time I went out with a
[1:04:06] brother I was preaching for him he took
[1:04:08] me to the restaurant
[1:04:10] you know the restaurant had music
[1:04:11] playing in the bar
[1:04:13] and you know how we as believers
[1:04:16] they got a bar in there right all right
[1:04:19] you going there to drink or you going to
[1:04:21] eat
[1:04:22] foreign
[1:04:24] I don't know about you when I go to
[1:04:26] Applebee's I ain't going to drink
[1:04:28] I'm going to eat
[1:04:30] I got ribs and chicken on my mind
[1:04:33] Hallelujah but for somebody who doesn't
[1:04:37] appreciate or who's confident in their
[1:04:39] Deliverance
[1:04:41] they run from me
[1:04:44] it's not supposed to have power for you
[1:04:47] you're supposed to have power over it
[1:04:48] see you're not supposed to fear what you
[1:04:51] were delivered of holy I'm not saying
[1:04:54] amen hallelujah you want to be at the
[1:04:56] club shaking and doing it and dancing
[1:04:58] and throwing it around you know you want
[1:05:01] to be doing that what I'm saying if you
[1:05:04] find yourself around that certain thing
[1:05:06] you're not afraid
[1:05:07] because you know what God did huh
[1:05:10] but me and his brother was in the
[1:05:12] restaurant and the day was playing some
[1:05:13] rock and roll music
[1:05:15] and you know they had that good that
[1:05:16] good talk whistling like princess
[1:05:18] playing
[1:05:20] baby
[1:05:23] he's old bro Jesus I'm so sorry about
[1:05:25] the music
[1:05:31] we fellowship and talking and eating
[1:05:33] music
[1:05:37] oh bro Jesus I'm so sorry about the
[1:05:38] music
[1:05:40] I said bro I'm good
[1:05:42] I can't be
[1:05:43] I came here to eat
[1:05:45] music wasn't bothering me but what was
[1:05:47] happening was he was having about it
[1:05:51] and he tried to make me a part of his
[1:05:53] battle
[1:05:54] yeah
[1:05:55] if you don't have full Deliverance don't
[1:05:58] bring somebody else in Hallelujah just
[1:06:01] ask God for mercy and Grace and keep it
[1:06:03] pushing earlier but don't try to make me
[1:06:05] weak with your weakness don't try to
[1:06:08] make me identify with your struggle holy
[1:06:10] God has delivered me from those things
[1:06:13] holy and he's like brother these I'm
[1:06:15] sorry I'm sorry I finally I said look
[1:06:17] bro this ain't bothering me this ain't
[1:06:20] bother me I ain't grew up with no rock
[1:06:21] and roll this ain't bothering me now if
[1:06:23] it was some rap it'll be something
[1:06:24] different
[1:06:30] I have no struggle with this you do
[1:06:37] yeah and you know a lot of times in the
[1:06:39] church the things that we have struggles
[1:06:41] with we try to put it on somebody else
[1:06:44] tell the past about Jack you know so and
[1:06:46] so did someone so dressed this way and I
[1:06:48] can't pay attention to church my sister
[1:06:49] so and so
[1:06:51] yeah it ain't so the sword sword that
[1:06:53] lust demon you got on it
[1:07:00] see it's the purging God will put things
[1:07:02] right in front of your face
[1:07:04] just so you can see you in as hole as
[1:07:06] you thought you was
[1:07:07] but what he'll do he'll have that thing
[1:07:09] that they'd be buried way down in it but
[1:07:11] that trial arriving on up
[1:07:13] see let's understand church I ain't
[1:07:15] calling you a devil what I'm saying to
[1:07:17] you tonight your goal your deity and
[1:07:19] deity has to be what beat on
[1:07:21] goal has to be Beto he has to be purged
[1:07:24] he has to get all the drops and filth
[1:07:26] out of it why because God knows it's
[1:07:29] real go
[1:07:32] oh and let's understand something about
[1:07:34] real gold real gold is not found in the
[1:07:37] palace it's found in a dirty Dark Places
[1:07:40] maybe a cave or a minoring
[1:07:43] but it takes somebody Hallelujah who
[1:07:45] knows his value to get down there and
[1:07:48] dig it out
[1:07:49] Hallelujah and that's what we have we
[1:07:52] have a five-fold Ministry who knows the
[1:07:54] value of the deity inside the church and
[1:07:57] they're getting there and preaching dig
[1:07:58] it out
[1:07:59] Hallelujah it'll talk about your
[1:08:01] household it'll talk about your children
[1:08:03] it'll talk about your marriage it'll
[1:08:04] talk about your job it'll talk about
[1:08:06] your absentee it'll talk about your
[1:08:08] finances what is it doing it's digging
[1:08:10] out all the places you are afraid of
[1:08:15] where to go
[1:08:17] Hallelujah
[1:08:21] but it's gold
[1:08:23] and to get the real value out of gold it
[1:08:26] has to be beat on
[1:08:28] but first things first you got to be
[1:08:30] heated up
[1:08:33] and right now it's getting hot in here
[1:08:37] come on I don't know about your life but
[1:08:39] I'm on fire
[1:08:40] [Laughter]
[1:08:41] I'm on fire I'm like Lord Kenny bird can
[1:08:44] this thing get any hotter yes
[1:08:47] glory and God speak back and say yeah I
[1:08:50] want you to be a flame
[1:08:52] I want you to be a flame and Fire I want
[1:08:55] you to be so on fire for me that it
[1:08:57] won't be red it'll be blue
[1:08:59] now that's when you know it's hot boy
[1:09:01] you see a blue fire you afraid to put
[1:09:03] your that's something to use the whale
[1:09:05] with
[1:09:08] that kind of fire cut things
[1:09:10] that gotta find a separate thing
[1:09:12] Hallelujah and God will let the trial
[1:09:15] get so hot
[1:09:16] to begin to separate all those things
[1:09:18] that you got going on the inside
[1:09:20] and it was that trial Hallelujah that
[1:09:23] God allowed Abraham to go through the
[1:09:25] Persian to get that line out of him and
[1:09:28] you can correct me if I'm wrong but from
[1:09:30] that place he never lied again wow
[1:09:33] because he never had a reason to fear
[1:09:36] anybody after that
[1:09:38] because God came and God dealt with him
[1:09:40] Hallelujah
[1:09:42] God dealt with him and even in all of
[1:09:44] his lack holy a god fought his battle
[1:09:47] and you know out by the time God was
[1:09:49] fierce with Abraham God told me to say
[1:09:51] look here said I hide anything from my
[1:09:53] servant Abraham
[1:10:00] when you want to get to that place

[1:15:35] somebody need to say that that's all
[1:15:37] defeat
[1:15:40] pictures
[1:15:42] what we have to realize that life
[1:15:46] our lives are preordained by God
[1:15:49] there's nothing happening right now that
[1:15:52] God doesn't know about
[1:15:54] but when I think about Persian I think
[1:15:56] about pruning
[1:15:58] and you know a tree has to be pruned
[1:16:00] and when it's not because the tree is a
[1:16:03] bad tree
[1:16:04] it's because Hallelujah there might be
[1:16:07] something in a way that's stopping other
[1:16:08] branches from growing
[1:16:10] Hallelujah so that branch that they've
[1:16:12] been producing and they were supposed to
[1:16:14] do it got to be trimmed down
[1:16:16] because there's more life around it
[1:16:18] hallelujah amen don't worry about people
[1:16:21] that you don't see no more they still
[1:16:22] might be bribe but they just had to be
[1:16:24] trimmed down
[1:16:26] Hallelujah they might have to be trimmed
[1:16:28] down why so you can rise to your spot
[1:16:31] [Applause]
[1:16:35] Hallelujah
[1:16:37] I don't get into the bitters of who
[1:16:38] brought and who ain't bride ain't my
[1:16:40] business

[1:16:42] oh boy they didn't supposed to get some
[1:16:44] message they didn't do this that ain't
[1:16:45] that the only one that can forgive them
[1:16:46] the only one that can take them in is
[1:16:48] God
[1:16:51] [Music]
[1:16:53] and we have to remember that Hallelujah
[1:16:55] not only in our Prophet but also in King
[1:16:58] David he said leave him alone maybe the
[1:17:00] Lord told him to say that
[1:17:05] it's sad oh they said
[1:17:07] I got something I say to my gym people

[1:17:57] your head but I can't control who I am
[1:18:01] Hallelujah
[1:18:04] Church in this life Hallelujah when you

[1:18:08] between God and the devil over over job

[1:18:16] Satan can ever show up in your life that
[1:18:19] God doesn't see him
[1:18:22] God sees him church he said the sons of
[1:18:26] God wouldn't present themselves before
[1:18:27] the Lord and the Bible says and the
[1:18:29] devil came also and what does God say
[1:18:31] the first thing he says when is coming
[1:18:33] down Satan see he saw him he knew he was
[1:18:36] there church there's not anything you go

[1:18:49] and better yet he allows it
[1:18:53] say I don't know about you
[1:18:55] but my life
[1:18:57] spiritual Casino
[1:19:02] every table in my life is rigged

[1:19:36] every table in your life is rigged by
[1:19:38] God
[1:19:40] so let's Satan throw his best out let
[1:19:43] him go in chalice God and God is saying
[1:19:45] go hey I already know that everybody you
[1:19:48] see is a part of the Winner's Circle
[1:19:50] anything
[1:19:51] Glory
[1:19:54] Hallelujah
[1:19:59] Church a lot of times while holes of the
[1:20:01] blessing is our attitudes
[1:20:03] while we're being purged
[1:20:05] amen and the thing about being purged as
[1:20:07] a three-cut method
[1:20:09] when you're cutting that tree there's a
[1:20:11] three-cut method three cut step on it
[1:20:14] you don't just go cut the branches
[1:20:20] there's a method to it there's a science
[1:20:22] too yeah right because the branches
[1:20:25] weighted a certain way in season
[1:20:27] so you go straight to the arm of it and
[1:20:30] cut it
[1:20:31] it's so heavy it'll rip down the tree
[1:20:34] and it'll tear areas that don't need to
[1:20:37] be torn
[1:20:39] see that's what some of y'all want to
[1:20:40] see
[1:20:41] you want to see the pastor preach on
[1:20:43] people in church when things go I don't
[1:20:45] know I better check it out let this
[1:20:47] brother come preach on this and that
[1:20:48] I'll let us know that's a three-cup
[1:20:51] message
[1:20:53] when you're pruning amen there's a
[1:20:54] Precision to it first thing you do
[1:20:57] Hallelujah when you're when you're when
[1:20:58] you're when you're pruning a tree and
[1:21:00] when you're cutting what you don't do
[1:21:01] you just go right to the problem and cut
[1:21:03] no you come out some
[1:21:06] you come out some and then the cut is
[1:21:09] not visible you cut under the bottom
[1:21:10] where nobody can't see it
[1:21:12] [Music]
[1:21:17] other than that the word is dealing with
[1:21:19] that person
[1:21:20] and they're being cut hardly in a way
[1:21:22] that you can't see it maybe the bouncers
[1:21:24] having confidence with them in ways
[1:21:26] where you don't see it hurry but what's
[1:21:28] happening that tree is being pruned
[1:21:31] hallelujah what we want to see a lot of
[1:21:33] times things done openly no
[1:21:37] things got to be done in private a lot
[1:21:40] [Music]
[1:21:43] if I learned a long time ago
[1:21:45] when I thought I was John the Baptist
[1:21:50] God's not gonna give me the satisfaction
[1:21:52] of seeing somebody rebuke because I
[1:21:53] think they're wrong
[1:21:55] [Music]
[1:22:00] so what God will do he allowed things to
[1:22:02] happen so you can get humbled
[1:22:06] they begin to show me the difference
[1:22:08] between a pastor and evangelist and I'd
[1:22:10] be sitting there thinking my brother has
[1:22:12] a dude I said boy now
[1:22:14] I lay a lot of lean to that thing I lean
[1:22:18] until I lean to him the wife the kids
[1:22:21] the cousins everybody involved
[1:22:26] I'll lay into everything
[1:22:29] and God said see that's why you're not a
[1:22:31] pastor
[1:22:34] because pastors ain't built like that
[1:22:36] honey
[1:22:37] amen they're built to deal with the
[1:22:40] problem Hallelujah and save as many
[1:22:42] people as they can while they deal with
[1:22:44] the problem
[1:22:48] and the worst person you could be is
[1:22:50] somebody that want to see somebody hurt
[1:22:56] God will allowing to go on just to
[1:22:59] Humble you
[1:23:03] oh my speaking from experienced Church
[1:23:07] listen what else is this word purging
[1:23:09] means
[1:23:10] Persia also means undesirable elements
[1:23:16] now don't raise your hand
[1:23:18] but I know right now
[1:23:20] in this church while I'm preaching all
[1:23:24] of us got things about ourselves that
[1:23:26] are undesirable to us
[1:23:28] [Music]
[1:23:31] that we pray about
[1:23:33] things that we say
[1:23:38] I almost turned to a bloodhound just now
[1:23:44] all of us got things that we take to the
[1:23:46] Lord in prayer and say Lord help me in
[1:23:48] this area
[1:23:50] those are situations and things that
[1:23:52] need to be purged
[1:23:55] amen undesirable elements
[1:23:58] to clear and this is the one I want you
[1:24:00] to catch hardly a purge means to cleanse
[1:24:03] of guilt
[1:24:05] how many people on their Christian
[1:24:07] journey and been saved for years still
[1:24:10] walk around with guilt
[1:24:16] and think about where they came from and
[1:24:20] can't even enjoy where they are
[1:24:25] because they're living with guilt
[1:24:28] that's why God takes us through things
[1:24:30] to purge all that out of us
[1:24:32] Hallelujah and you may not even realize
[1:24:35] what what I love about God hallelujah
[1:24:37] God's a visionary
[1:24:39] he can see things in you that you don't
[1:24:42] even know you're a part of
[1:24:45] you're going to react holy before you
[1:24:47] even get
[1:24:48] even get so God
[1:24:50] sometimes you can look in the mirror
[1:24:55] four four I switch gears a little bit
[1:24:58] let's talk about
[1:25:00] Hallelujah being purged
[1:25:02] in your position filled with the Holy
[1:25:05] Ghost being used by God right still got
[1:25:08] to be
[1:25:11] you like me I don't know about that bro
[1:25:13] d That's
[1:25:15] well let's take it straight out the
[1:25:17] message
[1:25:19] brother Brandon had to be purged
[1:25:22] he had a lying spirit in them
[1:25:29] that Spirit was always there
[1:25:33] it was just way down in there
[1:25:37] and what God did God put him in a
[1:25:39] situation
[1:25:41] where that lie had to be told
[1:25:47] listen
[1:25:48] I think it's in the third seal
[1:25:51] where the Prophet talks about Jesus
[1:25:53] meeting the woman at the well he said
[1:25:55] what he did was shine light on her past
[1:25:57] and showed it to her
[1:25:59] just so he could deliver her from it
[1:26:01] amen amen because once he showed her her
[1:26:06] past and her mistake having so many hugs
[1:26:09] and this and that then the light came on
[1:26:12] and you say well God will do God will
[1:26:14] show you a mistake just so he can bring
[1:26:16] you to your deliverance
[1:26:18] and what happened church he put the
[1:26:20] prophet now listen what I started out
[1:26:22] with holy purging Hallelujah you be in
[1:26:25] situations you be in Hallelujah things
[1:26:27] will happen that you have no explanation
[1:26:29] for
[1:26:31] that's how the purging comes that's why
[1:26:33] I say it's purging season look
[1:26:35] hallelujah look at the prophet fighting
[1:26:37] the taxes he didn't do anything wrong
[1:26:42] hey he had proof he was putting the
[1:26:45] money in the right places
[1:26:46] he was doing the right thing with the
[1:26:48] money he was signed it over to the
[1:26:50] decided over to the church and doing the
[1:26:52] right thing and all this and that didn't
[1:26:53] tax people come back and say you owed us
[1:26:57] and they put some serious pressure
[1:27:00] and it kept coming kept coming you know
[1:27:02] he had maybe two or three different
[1:27:03] phones they could get all lines
[1:27:07] amen because remember he had a line that
[1:27:10] he didn't want to be bothered on
[1:27:12] and I believe it was that line that day
[1:27:14] the taxi collect the call he was in the
[1:27:15] house
[1:27:18] the bat line
[1:27:21] and the phone began to ring
[1:27:25] in a profit
[1:27:27] his wife says bill
[1:27:30] it's that tax man
[1:27:35] tell him I'm not in here
[1:27:38] God put him in that situation
[1:27:42] because there were more people involved
[1:27:44] than just him and me
[1:27:46] and sometimes God will deal with your
[1:27:48] person to bring somebody else closer to
[1:27:50] God
[1:27:53] so now he he walks at the house comes
[1:27:56] back in and she says now bill you know
[1:27:57] that just wasn't quite right
[1:27:59] and he was like well you know I really
[1:28:01] technically technically
[1:28:03] you know how we do when your kids you
[1:28:06] ask your kids something they don't
[1:28:07] really want to lie so they go all the
[1:28:09] way around the mountain but they still
[1:28:10] lying
[1:28:12] yeah in church he said it will take me I
[1:28:15] wasn't in the house I bought it out blah
[1:28:16] blah blah you know Bill you know that
[1:28:17] ain't quite right y'all know the story
[1:28:19] so he goes on about his business being a
[1:28:21] prophet
[1:28:23] got a call to go pray for somebody
[1:28:25] ain't thinking nothing about what he
[1:28:26] just did but God was
[1:28:29] now he gets operating in his Commission
[1:28:34] what God calls him to be
[1:28:36] Hallelujah pray for the sick and now
[1:28:38] he's dead praying feeling praying God
[1:28:40] said you ain't fit to pray for that
[1:28:41] person
[1:28:42] you just told a lie
[1:28:45] and that thing struck him anyway
[1:28:48] what did he do it humbled him
[1:28:51] man
[1:28:53] amen humbled him to prove him it humbled
[1:28:57] him and he says God tells him gonna make
[1:29:00] it right and he goes go find the um tax
[1:29:03] man the lawyer whoever he was go to his
[1:29:05] office and confesses to him say look
[1:29:08] when you called I was there
[1:29:09] but I walked out and I'm sorry I lied to
[1:29:12] you and that man says
[1:29:15] I always have respectfully
[1:29:18] and now I got greater respect
[1:29:22] see him humbling in himself brought that
[1:29:24] man closer to the vision
[1:29:27] so sometimes you just being purged
[1:29:30] allows the other branches to get some of
[1:29:32] that light
[1:29:36] oh
[1:29:38] and it don't feel good being purged
[1:29:44] but the end the end of the whole thing
[1:29:48] is that the tree continues to live
[1:29:51] earlier and live and produce a well let
[1:29:54] me ask some what stops a tree from
[1:29:56] producing apples
[1:29:59] you say time no it ain't time
[1:30:01] it's supposed to continue
[1:30:03] as long as it's a tree it's supposed to
[1:30:05] continue what stops it from producing
[1:30:07] apple somewhere into the tree got a
[1:30:09] sickness
[1:30:12] still look like an apple tree you know
[1:30:13] it's an apple tree but it's not
[1:30:15] producing Apple's number what's stopping
[1:30:16] it it's still an apple tree
[1:30:19] some kind of way the mechanics in it
[1:30:21] it's gotten off the Dynamics of the tree
[1:30:24] has gotten off it's still supposed to
[1:30:26] produce
[1:30:28] and let me say ladies if you're not
[1:30:30] producing something that's gotten off
[1:30:32] he said even when you're bringing for a
[1:30:34] fruit you're Purge it that you bring
[1:30:35] forth more fruit for one more year no we
[1:30:39] don't put a time limit on it
[1:30:46] for our clothes I'm gonna read you
[1:30:47] something
[1:30:49] oh my
[1:30:50] God and you know
[1:30:52] what the Lord has done for me he's
[1:30:54] allowed me to look at my trials
[1:30:56] From a Different Light
[1:30:59] now I laugh at the Devil
[1:31:01] we like
[1:31:03] well you know what to do
[1:31:08] might not look like it but that's what
[1:31:10] he's doing
[1:31:12] 100 years ago I was down here
[1:31:17] I think it was Hurricane Dennis
[1:31:20] hurricane dinner yeah it was have you
[1:31:22] beat that brother West Coast
[1:31:25] Bill Westco
[1:31:26] a hurricane coming hurricane was in
[1:31:28] Miami and it was coming up it was
[1:31:31] blowing I'll shoot
[1:31:33] [Music]
[1:31:36] and I'm looking around Jack I'm gonna
[1:31:38] Smiley y'all Church
[1:31:42] and they look at me like yeah why not
[1:31:49] she had never been in this that kind of
[1:31:51] atmosphere before so they've been there
[1:31:53] before bro we brought up our house but
[1:31:55] we're gonna do and we just keep it
[1:31:56] pushing ain't it wasn't lying people
[1:31:58] still out in the street getting gas
[1:32:00] buying food and everything don't they
[1:32:01] realize a hurricane
[1:32:06] but somebody like me I was operating in
[1:32:09] fear they was operating in we gonna come
[1:32:11] through this
[1:32:12] we didn't been through this before
[1:32:14] so we ain't worried about this we gonna
[1:32:17] come right on through it but for me I
[1:32:19] was like oh no
[1:32:21] it's time to go
[1:32:24] but just being in things like that
[1:32:26] Hallelujah it lets you see what you're
[1:32:28] making out and what you're making it out
[1:32:30] to be somebody else is already
[1:32:31] overcoming
[1:32:33] and they ain't looking at it the way you
[1:32:35] look at it
[1:32:36] I say this before I close be careful
[1:32:39] that your imagination doesn't lead you
[1:32:44] because your imagination can be a
[1:32:46] product of fear
[1:32:49] you take you take a young lady who's
[1:32:51] been waiting to get married she's been
[1:32:53] waiting a long time and then she's like
[1:32:54] ain't no boys ain't never gonna get mad
[1:32:56] I'm listening that's your imagination
[1:33:00] and you let your imagination lead you
[1:33:03] out of the Earth from Under the Umbrella
[1:33:04] of the word
[1:33:07] and it happens like that with a lot of
[1:33:10] things we do listen
[1:33:11] he says oh the fire the fire only Waters
[1:33:14] it
[1:33:15] it only gives us New Hope
[1:33:18] it only strengthens it every trial
[1:33:21] testing every time a wind hits a tree it
[1:33:25] shoves it back and forth and back and
[1:33:27] forth it only loses the roots so it can
[1:33:30] grow deeper
[1:33:34] you mean to tell me right now
[1:33:37] whatever we're going through is making
[1:33:40] us better
[1:33:42] making us stronger yeah if you looking
[1:33:46] at it through the eyes of God
[1:33:49] he said
[1:33:50] he said it's getting a better hold every
[1:33:53] time sickness strikes your home every
[1:33:55] time trial strikes your home every time
[1:33:58] the neighbors say something bad about
[1:34:00] you it only shaking you loosening you up
[1:34:04] so you can get down and get a better
[1:34:07] hold on Eternal Rock of God unmovable
[1:34:11] word
[1:34:12] so church that's what I'll attest in our
[1:34:14] trials and different situations are
[1:34:16] doing what they're doing they're making
[1:34:19] us stronger if you're not being led by
[1:34:21] your imagination
[1:34:22] if you're being led by the promise of
[1:34:24] God's word you have something to grab
[1:34:26] hold to and get a better grip
[1:34:29] Hallelujah
[1:34:31] cause when it's all said and done
[1:34:34] when you look back on the purging and
[1:34:36] and God cleaning us up after that
[1:34:39] Goldsmith beats that goal and beats that
[1:34:42] goal he flips it and beats that goal and
[1:34:43] beats that goal and flips it beats it
[1:34:46] and he doesn't stop beating it until
[1:34:47] when
[1:34:49] sees this reflection
[1:34:52] and that's all God wants from us yeah
[1:34:55] if you want us back to the place
[1:34:58] where he looks at us he sees Adam
[1:35:01] is very likeness and image again
[1:35:04] and only we're going to get there
[1:35:06] is through a purging
[1:35:09] because we got so much stuff in us to
[1:35:12] have to come out
[1:35:14] you know sometimes you'll you'll you'll
[1:35:16] you'll be riding in your car and
[1:35:18] somebody just cut in front of you
[1:35:21] because there's a reaction that God want
[1:35:23] to get out
[1:35:28] so you can repent of that thing
[1:35:31] and I do it again
[1:35:36] that's what God does
[1:35:39] Church
[1:35:40] listen
[1:35:43] the purging of the spirit
[1:35:46] I was reading how Paul
[1:35:48] I'm about to close
[1:35:50] he says he wanted Deliverance
[1:35:54] and Paul was like Lord I remember salt
[1:35:56] you three times about this thing and you
[1:35:58] know you still hadn't delivered me and
[1:36:00] God had a purpose for it
[1:36:02] God was like Paul there's an abundance
[1:36:04] of Revelation in you
[1:36:06] so I send a messenger
[1:36:14] it wasn't a spirit that was going to
[1:36:15] stay with him
[1:36:16] he was a messenger to Buffet him for
[1:36:19] that situation
[1:36:21] and then he said the prophet of God said
[1:36:23] what does buffered me buffered me blow
[1:36:25] after blow
[1:36:26] so he said it is the journey to get
[1:36:28] better and God let the messenger come
[1:36:30] again boom the journey get better he let
[1:36:33] the message come again boom let the
[1:36:36] journey get better Mr come boom what was
[1:36:38] he doing keeping Paul humble
[1:36:41] right Hallelujah why so he could use
[1:36:43] them and continue to use them and church
[1:36:46] look at oh what did all of his trials do
[1:36:49] his trials help us get where we are
[1:36:54] Hallelujah he let him go through all of
[1:36:56] those things because I love Sanders he
[1:36:58] let him go through all that you know why
[1:37:00] because he had the book of Romans in him
[1:37:02] he had the book of Corinthians in him he
[1:37:04] had the book of uh Philippians the book
[1:37:07] of uh Ephesus the book of Galatians her
[1:37:09] first and second Corinthians was inside
[1:37:11] of him and what brought that out trials
[1:37:14] Church half of those books he wrote
[1:37:16] where was he in jail
[1:37:22] because remember what he ended he ended
[1:37:25] the book by saying and by the way bring
[1:37:27] me a coat
[1:37:30] yeah
[1:37:33] the Bible says a night and day in the
[1:37:35] sea Holly went with 40 Stripes at least
[1:37:38] five times been by a Bible Church he was
[1:37:41] even Stone
[1:37:44] why so we could get half of the New
[1:37:46] Testament
[1:37:49] why so if God can continue to bring that
[1:37:52] word out of them
[1:37:57] now what's your child bringing out of
[1:37:59] you it's supposed to be bringing
[1:38:01] something out of you
[1:38:03] amen there's supposed to be some kind of
[1:38:05] Victory Church look at it Viper buys
[1:38:08] them on his head he just shakes it off
[1:38:09] that don't even get fear didn't even
[1:38:11] have any place in his journey
[1:38:15] the prophet God said when fear is gone
[1:38:19] faith is made perfect
[1:38:22] Hallelujah
[1:38:23] that's why Paul could look at her
[1:38:25] gripping faster than say for this
[1:38:26] purpose I came
[1:38:28] I'm going wrong
[1:38:30] Hallelujah
[1:38:31] detergent it wasn't just him but God
[1:38:33] always purged the saints of God I mean
[1:38:36] like I started with Moses Moses purged
[1:38:38] Abraham purse you know who else had to
[1:38:40] be purged like nobody else had to be
[1:38:42] purged King David
[1:38:45] amen amen
[1:38:51] if I don't know
[1:38:53] crisp
[1:38:56] I love the story of David and Bathsheba
[1:39:00] because the parallel of it is
[1:39:02] David was taking a rest that day
[1:39:06] but God didn't call him the rest God
[1:39:08] call him the fight
[1:39:10] so the day he decided to rest was the
[1:39:12] day he fought his greatest battle
[1:39:17] don't get in your mind I've arrived I'm
[1:39:19] good we yeah this is it
[1:39:22] you setting yourself up for a major
[1:39:24] trial
[1:39:26] and David
[1:39:28] goes and she sees Bathsheba the prophet
[1:39:31] God said she knew he'd come out there
[1:39:32] and sit there
[1:39:34] it was all planned out
[1:39:37] and now David Hallelujah he sees better
[1:39:40] see what we know the story he takes best
[1:39:41] she would take the man wife now let's
[1:39:43] look at all the stuff that's gonna come
[1:39:45] out of King Day
[1:39:47] all the stuff that was already in him
[1:39:50] but now it's gonna come out in a
[1:39:52] perverted way
[1:39:54] yes brother we knew he was a warrior we
[1:39:57] knew he was a killer but now it's going
[1:39:59] to be perverted
[1:40:00] Hallelujah not sure he's looking he look
[1:40:03] at that uriah's I mean I got to get rid
[1:40:04] of this man
[1:40:06] this baby I know the baby mine but I
[1:40:09] want the baby to be his
[1:40:11] and he plotting he's scheming and he
[1:40:13] lying he cheating he's doing all kind of
[1:40:15] stuff and you know what church a lot of
[1:40:17] times Hallelujah we get blinded by our
[1:40:20] own trial
[1:40:21] he was doing all this stuff and he
[1:40:23] didn't even see how guilty he was
[1:40:26] it's purging season
[1:40:29] oh
[1:40:31] now Uriah is dead I'm fast forward y'all
[1:40:34] know the story
[1:40:35] uriah's dad and David
[1:40:40] whoo
[1:40:42] well I got out an album
[1:40:44] oh come on girl let's get mad
[1:40:49] Here Comes Nathan
[1:40:53] Nathan started to talk to David
[1:40:55] start telling David a parable about a
[1:40:58] man who had one sheep his other man had
[1:41:00] plenty sheep he said he takes the man
[1:41:03] one sheep and this and that and do all
[1:41:05] the stuff and they and David say I'ma
[1:41:07] kill him
[1:41:10] how dare you
[1:41:11] a head person I'm a cat
[1:41:14] and your eyes like David you want to
[1:41:16] kill yourself
[1:41:18] that's what you need to kill kill
[1:41:19] yourself
[1:41:21] and David was like
[1:41:25] but the heart of a true Son of God
[1:41:30] don't try to find a way out of
[1:41:32] repentance
[1:41:33] don't try to find a way of being hardly
[1:41:36] a putting on humility but they operate
[1:41:39] it
[1:41:40] even though he was a king Harley that
[1:41:42] David fell on his knees and said Lord I
[1:41:44] have sinned earlier that was the
[1:41:47] difference between him and Saul Saul
[1:41:48] said it was the people
[1:41:51] David say I have seen
[1:41:53] David fell on his knees and then God
[1:41:55] came back and God said
[1:41:57] David you ain't gonna die
[1:41:59] why because he made it right he accepted
[1:42:01] he accepted The Purge
[1:42:03] holy why because God had to give us
[1:42:06] something out of that
[1:42:08] and out of that trial what do we get
[1:42:10] Psalms 51.
[1:42:13] creating me a clean heart
[1:42:15] oh yeah oh Lord
[1:42:18] restore unto me the joy of thy salvation
[1:42:20] take 99 Holy Spirit from me Hallelujah
[1:42:24] David began to cry out song Hallelujah
[1:42:27] and now we've seen that song of the ages
[1:42:31] but all of that came from a Persian
[1:42:34] but it was child of the child Purge at
[1:42:36] The Purge why so that we could get those
[1:42:39] Mighty songs God would take David into
[1:42:42] battle so David began to operate in the
[1:42:44] Lord is my shepherd
[1:42:50] somebody else's child could be your
[1:42:53] victory
[1:42:54] so don't cast them down don't talk about
[1:42:56] them hard it could be something that'll
[1:42:57] make the church better
[1:43:01] Hallelujah
[1:43:04] Church
[1:43:05] before I close let me read you this come
[1:43:07] on musician I'm closing
[1:43:09] that's what he said he said and here was
[1:43:11] Moses mother in the conflict of the
[1:43:14] testing of her faith
[1:43:17] and every child every son that coming to
[1:43:19] God first must be what tried
[1:43:23] God test your faith now look now this is
[1:43:27] what I love about this quote right here
[1:43:29] he says now look
[1:43:31] like God could just simply bypass the
[1:43:34] whole thing can't get amen
[1:43:37] I'm sure we've all asked that question
[1:43:39] say Lord Lord I didn't pray that fast
[1:43:43] yeah I'm sure we lord we don't have to
[1:43:46] go this route
[1:43:48] foreign
[1:43:49] just simply bypassed the whole thing
[1:43:57] he said and don't have any appropriate
[1:43:59] way and just cut the thing off
[1:44:02] but he said but it's better
[1:44:04] that he gives you a test
[1:44:07] and then comes to you when you're in the
[1:44:09] test
[1:44:12] I'm gonna say like the Pentecostal
[1:44:14] preacher y'all don't hear me
[1:44:18] I said God we'll give you a test
[1:44:22] I say God will give you a test
[1:44:27] so he can come to you in the test
[1:44:32] so the test is to bring forth a greater
[1:44:35] awareness of God in your life
[1:44:39] a greater appreciation of his presence
[1:44:42] in your life
[1:44:43] anybody being tested
[1:44:46] I hope you looking for God
[1:44:48] Hallelujah I hope you're looking for God
[1:44:51] because the whole reason why you're
[1:44:52] being tested is show that he could show
[1:44:54] himself in a clear light to you
[1:44:57] amen amen amen so so before you like uh
[1:45:01] I'm sick of this I'm sick of all this
[1:45:03] child don't be sick of it

[1:52:49] and you are good old
[1:52:54] Lord your worthy
[1:52:58] and you are good
[1:53:05] oh somebody give the Lord Praise in this
[1:53:08] place tonight
[1:53:10] my
[1:53:13] um certainly appreciate the word of the
[1:53:16] Lord
[1:53:17] from our precious
[1:53:20] brother Diggs
[1:53:22] I think I've probably read that
[1:53:24] scripture Deuteronomy I don't know how
[1:53:25] many times but just completely missed uh
[1:53:29] what the Lord was really trying to say
[1:53:32] especially I think God has a word for
[1:53:34] you in every season of your life and
[1:53:38] um I don't know I guess it just means
[1:53:40] more to me when um when somebody kind of
[1:53:43] has been with you along the journey and
[1:53:46] uh I I love that part I seen him do it
[1:53:50] all these things that we've done seen
[1:53:52] God do we we know what he's capable of
[1:53:55] doing amen he does the exceeding the
[1:53:58] abundance above all we can ask and
[1:54:00] thinking but we have to go we have to be
[1:54:02] willing to go through this purging
[1:54:03] season and I'm gonna tell you something
[1:54:06] amen even after
[1:54:09] we step into our new building you all
[1:54:13] have need to be aware that there might
[1:54:14] be another season of purging even during
[1:54:17] that time now the good thing about
[1:54:20] urgency not just anytime anybody
[1:54:23] preached from John 15 they just they
[1:54:26] preaching my life story because that's
[1:54:29] that's how this church got started amen
[1:54:31] based on John 15 and what God spoke to
[1:54:33] me through that scripture
[1:54:36] um but when you when you go through
[1:54:37] urgency the beautiful thing about
[1:54:39] purging amen is that it always brings
[1:54:42] forth more fruit
[1:54:45] it always does that and uh so you have
[1:54:48] to look to the other side of the process
[1:54:50] not just what you're going through but
[1:54:51] what God is doing inside of you amen
[1:54:54] through the midst of this so I just
[1:54:56] thank God I just appreciate that I'm
[1:54:58] happy I came to church tonight
[1:55:00] praise God
[1:55:04] I God bless you God bless you brother
[1:55:07] Diggs thank you so much brother just for
[1:55:09] delivering your heart to us tonight
[1:55:11] amen amen amen amen well let's have a
[1:55:15] word of prayer and man we'll prepare to
[1:55:17] dismiss a man on tonight father we just
[1:55:19] thank you for the word that has come uh
[1:55:22] to us how strengthened we are and

[1:55:31] you for the Saints pressing away out
[1:55:32] Lord to come and hear the word tonight
[1:55:34] and I pray Lord that as we leave here
[1:55:36] we'll go meditating and thinking on the
[1:55:38] things that you've spoken to us may
[1:55:41] change take place in our life oh God and
[1:55:43] may we be warned in the spirit father we
[1:55:47] don't want our imagination leading us we
[1:55:50] want the Holy Spirit to lead us the
[1:55:52] scripture says those that are led by the
[1:55:54] spirit of God they are the sons of God
[1:55:57] so Lord I pray that we would take time

[1:56:03] trust God that you would just get glory
[1:56:05] and on out of our lives and help us to
[1:56:07] realize that whatever we're going
[1:56:09] through is it didn't catch you by
[1:56:11] surprise God you knew all about it
[1:56:13] before it even got started so Lord uh
[1:56:16] whatever it is that you want to take out
[1:56:17] of us if you want to Humble us Lord and
[1:56:20] and help us Lord to realize how much
[1:56:22] more we need you God we're willing to go

[1:56:26] songwriter said whatever it takes for my
[1:56:29] will to break that's what I'm willing to
[1:56:33] do so Lord I pray that you just continue
