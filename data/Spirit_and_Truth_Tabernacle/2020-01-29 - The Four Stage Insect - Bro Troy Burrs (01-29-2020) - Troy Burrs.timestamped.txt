[4:03] asked you to bless those that have an
[4:05] arrival father God is still fighting the
[4:07] dangers hi where's the father God give
[4:09] them traveling mercies and fun and it's
[4:11] good to be with us or God Jesus you may
[4:21] be seated
[4:23] I'm not gonna be real before you too
[4:27] long I like what you did grab your
[4:29] Bibles we're gonna start a man at Joelle
[4:36] chapter 2 and we're gonna kind of teach
[4:48] on the loose subject on those that
[4:55] four-stage insect a man that uh Joelle
[5:02] talked about there in chapter 2 I start
[5:07] will read starting from verse 1 amen the
[5:13] word of the Lord that game to Joe well
[5:16] son of Bethuel hear this ye old man and
[5:22] give ear all ye inhabitants of the land
[5:26] have this been in your day or even in
[5:30] the days of your father's tell you
[5:33] you're children of it and let your
[5:36] children tell their children and their
[5:39] children another generation for that
[5:43] which the palmer worm has left hath the
[5:48] locusts eaten and that which the locusts
[5:52] have left has the cankerworm eaten and
[5:57] that which the canker has left the
[6:02] caterpillar has eaten amen the Lord had
[6:07] a blessing to the reading of the word we
[6:08] just want to look a man where we're
[6:10] going to be going to kind of stay
[6:11] right keep our Bibles closed because we
[6:13] gonna continue to look at a few things a
[6:16] man in need in the message restoration
[6:21] of the Briah tree the Prophet brought
[6:22] out that four-stage beast that forced
[6:27] agency and how that insect sort of just
[6:33] ate away in the church and I want you to
[6:35] realize and understand that the same way
[6:37] he eats away at the churches the same
[6:40] way he destroys the individual because
[6:44] he is constructed the same way God
[6:46] doesn't change his mind he built the
[6:48] church the same way he builds the
[6:50] individual a man so we want to take a
[6:53] first look at this pama worm but before
[6:57] we do that let's let's go over to mark
[7:00] the fourth chapter mark the fourth
[7:06] chapter
[7:16] to make sure that that's what I want to
[7:18] see
[7:27] yes mark the fourth chapter unless we're
[7:32] going to we're gonna read that and then
[7:35] we're going to do something just a
[7:36] little bit different
[7:41] we'll start at verse verse three here
[7:46] behold there went out a sword to sew and
[7:49] it came to pass as a soul some fell by
[7:53] the way side and the fowls of the air
[7:55] came and devoured it up some fell on
[8:01] stony ground where it had not much earth
[8:06] and immediately it sprang up but it had
[8:11] no depth of earth but when the Sun was
[8:16] up it was scorched a man and because it
[8:22] had no root it withered away some fell
[8:27] among thorns and and the thorns grew up
[8:33] and choked it out and it yielded no
[8:36] fruit and other fell on good ground and
[8:41] did yield fruit it some fell on Good
[8:47] Friday did yield fruit and sprang up and
[8:50] increased and brought forth some 30 some
[8:55] 60 and some hundredfold and he said unto
[8:58] them he that hath an ear let him hear he
[9:02] that hath ears to hear let him hear a
[9:06] man and he says and when he was alone
[9:11] where about him with the twelve they
[9:15] asked him when he was alone they that
[9:19] were about him with the twelve axed of
[9:23] him the parable and he said unto them
[9:26] unto you it is given to know the mystery
[9:30] of the kingdom of God but unto that are
[9:35] without all things all these things are
[9:39] done
[9:39] in parables that seeing they may see and
[9:42] not perceive and hearing they may hear
[9:45] and not understand lest any time they
[9:49] should be converted and their sins
[9:52] should be forgiven right so I want you
[9:55] to look at something very important here
[9:57] Jesus were preaching and he and he gave
[10:00] this this this in a parable but here in
[10:06] verse 10 what was it was it was
[10:08] important here was when the disciples
[10:12] got him alone they asked him they asked
[10:19] him what does this mean and he said unto
[10:24] you a man I give to you to know the
[10:27] mystery now the point that I'm trying to
[10:29] bring out in inverse T and alone that if
[10:33] you have a question all you have to do
[10:37] is ask him it's his good will to give
[10:41] you the understanding and the revelation
[10:43] but the problem that a lot of people
[10:46] have is they'll hear something that
[10:47] don't sound quite familiar to them or
[10:50] hear something that they've never heard
[10:53] before and not being able to go into the
[10:57] presence of the Lord when they're alone
[11:00] here's something preached from the
[11:02] platform here's something and
[11:04] immediately what they do I've never
[11:06] heard that before so they discard it but
[11:09] instead going to your secret place where
[11:12] you are alone with God and just ask him
[11:16] to give you the mystery amen and that's
[11:20] what these men did and he said unto you
[11:23] but look at it he said I proceeded into
[11:26] those people them seen they may see and
[11:29] not proceed hearing they may hear see
[11:32] because this is the way he hide the
[11:34] things from the wise and the prudent and
[11:36] revealed it to babes such as would learn
[11:37] amen and he goes on and say les at any
[11:42] time they be converted Amen convert it
[11:46] means that they're changed their ways
[11:47] amen they they turn 100
[11:52] native degrees and begin to travel in
[11:54] another direction and begin to ask him
[11:57] and their sins are forgiven then he'll
[11:59] give them the note of mistress but we
[12:02] see so many people they hear something
[12:04] new here something that they've acquired
[12:05] on't understand and what they do or
[12:08] immediately discard it because it's
[12:11] foreign to them instead of going to
[12:13] Christ
[12:13] going down on their knees asking the
[12:16] Lord to reveal it to them because we'll
[12:19] give into that a little bit more but
[12:20] we're going to start here with this
[12:21] palmer worm a man and what i want to do
[12:25] is i'm going to take these same
[12:26] scriptures here from chapter 4 starting
[12:30] here at the eighth verse and we're gonna
[12:32] kind of take each verse we're gonna take
[12:34] it but we're gonna go backwards hey man
[12:37] we're gonna go backwards a little bit so
[12:39] we start here at first he says some seed
[12:42] fell on good ground amen when the seed
[12:46] fell on good ground it grew up a menace
[12:49] started at a seed and and it grew up to
[12:52] a young tree and this tree was a healthy
[12:55] tree amen
[12:57] like David said we shall be like a tree
[12:59] planted by the rivers of running water
[13:02] amen our lives are not wizzard a man so
[13:05] it grown up to be a healthy tree and
[13:08] free it'd be bad if you turn over to
[13:12] Galatians two fifth chapter
[13:21] let's look at Galatians the fifth
[13:24] chapter
[13:38] at the 22nd first starting at the 22nd
[13:44] verse he tells us what the fruit is on
[13:47] the tree but the fruit let's look at it
[13:52] here the first fruit but the fruit of
[13:54] the Spirit is love joy peace
[13:58] long-suffering gentleness goodness faith
[14:01] meekness temperance against such there
[14:06] is no law
[14:08] now the first fruit on the tree Amen we
[14:12] see it's love okay we see is love and
[14:15] that parler one if we go to the message
[14:20] restoration of the pariah tree a man
[14:24] we're going to start at paragraph that I
[14:29] believe is 200 amen well hold that
[14:38] sister hold that because it's actually
[14:41] at another place and I did mark down the
[14:42] paragraph on that one right there but
[14:44] what I want you to see here is the in
[14:48] the in the message here the process say
[14:50] the first fruit that that Pawar began to
[14:54] eat a man is love that's the first fruit
[15:00] on the tree so Apollo worm Apollo worm
[15:06] is like a flying insect sort of like a
[15:11] moth it is a very small insect and III
[15:18] googled it and I wish I had the ability
[15:20] to computer-savvy mister baby to have it
[15:25] up there so you can see the picture of
[15:26] it but it's like a Moulton just like the
[15:29] Prophet said it has two horns like two
[15:32] horns there but it's a flying insect but
[15:35] it's very fragile very very you know how
[15:40] am off if you ever kill them off it's
[15:42] like nothing to it it's it's not like
[15:44] dust and but that's what is since eight
[15:48] beers so this little innocent
[15:51] small insect comes in and he begins to
[15:56] eat away at the fruit he starts with
[16:01] love he begins to eat away at the fruit
[16:04] for the love of your brother and sister
[16:07] he begins to eat away at the fruit for
[16:11] your love of the gospel he begins to eat
[16:14] at the fruit for your love for the word
[16:18] for your love that's general amen
[16:22] he begins to eat at that fruit the next
[16:25] fruit on the tree amen
[16:27] in Galatians there what did you have it
[16:31] there I've got to go back and forth from
[16:32] my Bible
[16:33] keep your Bible saying I wish I can hold
[16:35] both sections at one time and I might be
[16:39] able to figure that out I got some
[16:40] tassels or something here's someone the
[16:44] next fruit on the tree is what is it a
[16:47] man the next threw that on the tree he'd
[16:50] go after his joy take away the joy of
[16:55] your salvation now not now not now I can
[17:03] attest to these things it is so subtle
[17:06] it is so subtle because when when the
[17:10] devil is attacking you he has a plan he
[17:16] has a methodology of attack and he began
[17:20] to slowly eat away at these fruit that
[17:25] this healthy tree it's been love the joy
[17:33] he takes away the joy of your salvation
[17:38] you begin you begin to well if I make it
[17:44] the church fine
[17:46] if I don't make it it's all good he
[17:51] began to eat away at you joy he is
[17:56] wearing you down little by little and
[17:59] see the keen bang of the devil is that
[18:01] he he's not going to
[18:04] I'll let you all at one time and just
[18:06] try to say no the Prophet told a story
[18:09] about the Frog they put him in lukewarm
[18:12] water and then slowly raised the
[18:15] temperature hey man now I want you to
[18:18] understand another thing here in the in
[18:20] the message I have it there our sister
[18:22] the greatest battle ever fought
[18:23] paragraph 68 he says when the great
[18:27] battle started on earth there had to be
[18:29] a mutual meeting place there had to be a
[18:32] mission of clinic meeting place selected
[18:35] for the battle and for the battle to
[18:38] rage and that battle ground begins in
[18:41] the human mind so these things that that
[18:47] the devil that needs this pond the worm
[18:49] this little flying insects so to speak
[18:53] it's the devil who rose like a rolling
[18:57] lion but he come as this little four
[19:01] stage bug this flying insect which is
[19:07] nothing if we attack him as an insect
[19:12] we just shoo them away we start feeling
[19:17] those negative feelings I'm losing the
[19:19] love what the prophet said how do we
[19:23] keep the love for Allah for the word the
[19:25] law for follow for fulfill for God read
[19:29] the word and pray every day it's just
[19:35] like any relationship you have to
[19:39] nurture that relationship through
[19:43] communication amen and communication as
[19:47] I say before goes both ways
[19:49] you can't just come to church and hear
[19:52] God speak to you and you had no time
[19:55] talk to him okay so that's how this
[20:00] little book this little insect this
[20:02] little cuny most type in say begins to
[20:06] just eat away at the fruit then II the
[20:09] next one I believe is peace is it in
[20:12] Galatians their take away your peace of
[20:15] mind
[20:17] you begin to get frustrated with things
[20:21] that's going on you begin to start
[20:25] picking out things he's pointing out
[20:28] things to you but I don't like this I
[20:33] don't like that and you began to get
[20:37] spiritually frustrated you may go and
[20:40] you say I don't feel I'm getting fear no
[20:43] more that's up to you
[20:48] you know you begin to get frustrated
[20:53] with everything you can seem to find no
[20:55] peace here frustrates you at every turn
[20:59] what is it that mall when you begin to
[21:04] feel these things oh just don't feel the
[21:08] love like I used to I just don't have
[21:12] the joy like I used to
[21:13] it's a little more tight bug eating away
[21:18] at the fruit now they're always gonna be
[21:21] there probably said we're gonna fight
[21:23] till we get out of here
[21:24] so what moth is always gonna be there
[21:28] but all it takes is shoo shoo get away I
[21:34] rebuke you in Jesus name I'm not gonna
[21:37] feel that way it's a mind battle it's
[21:41] just in the mind it's not your fault
[21:44] it's the devil planning that soul in
[21:47] your mind if you reason with it you'll
[21:51] go to the next stage amen
[21:54] now let's let's let's move on we're
[21:57] still here we're gonna we're gonna
[21:58] continue from Martin amen
[22:04] yeah I got it here now we started with
[22:09] this healthy tree here
[22:11] amen amen and eight now we're gonna go
[22:18] backwards and we're gonna go to and some
[22:20] fell on thorns and the thorns grew up
[22:25] and choked it and it yielded no fruit
[22:31] and I see now this this this stage of
[22:33] the tree ain't even no fruit on it hey
[22:37] man because it didn't get to that point
[22:40] to where it begin to yield fruit let's
[22:45] go to a man that next beef that next
[22:53] insect or the next stage of that insect
[22:59] go to restoration of the Briah tree
[23:03] paragraph 22 amen the next stage of that
[23:12] insect was the locust hey man now the
[23:17] prophecy what does the locust do the
[23:20] locust eats away at the leaves of this
[23:25] tree eats away at believes he takes away
[23:28] the leaves now what does it look
[23:30] destroys the leaves he destroys divine
[23:34] fellowship he says one of the leaves do
[23:37] he said it makes it cool where the birds
[23:39] can fly up front of the leaves and cool
[23:42] off there was a there was that tree
[23:45] again now I want you to notice that when
[23:49] in in the beginning when Adam and Eve
[23:51] where would they meet God under the tree
[23:55] in the coolness of the evening under the
[23:58] shade of a tree go to the message what
[24:02] here starry larger 5906 oh nine twelve
[24:12] pair paragraph 12 bring that up amen
[24:22] what here sterilizer 5906 Oh nein okay
[24:29] can you move down go go up stop right
[24:33] there
[24:34] I think you went too far no no other way
[24:36] I'm sorry
[24:37] stop right now I can go forever but it
[24:40] goes to show that when God's doing
[24:41] something Satan is always present to
[24:44] block it or to tear it down
[24:46] amen or do what he can to interrupt it
[24:50] now it's this fourth day fees and so
[24:54] it's an insect but we know this is the
[24:56] deal okay
[24:57] he was worn out talking about Elijah
[25:00] worn out his nerves all on edge all on
[25:05] edge and just like people today we need
[25:09] a juniper tree a man he preached he was
[25:14] tired and nervous and people pray
[25:16] they're so nervous and it's all nervous
[25:18] and neurotic and upset the world right
[25:21] now we're living in everybody
[25:24] just on edge as to say or to speak like
[25:29] it's just any little thing so upsets
[25:32] them God's people is that way the world
[25:37] of the world is that way we all need a
[25:42] juniper tree a place to rest a trust
[25:46] that the convention will be a juniper
[25:51] tree I like that trust that the
[25:54] convention will be a juniper tree a man
[25:59] we have meetings coming up I trust that
[26:02] few tired and you're weary and and and
[26:08] you need a little rest that you find
[26:11] rest up under the juniper tree that
[26:13] Christ that tree a man of of life amen
[26:17] amen can you can can get up under that
[26:21] tree and cool off and he can like he did
[26:24] Elijah there just speak to you under the
[26:27] juniper tree give you strength to go on
[26:31] under the juniper tree but what is dude
[26:36] locus he comes to eat away at the
[26:37] fellowship and when I like how he's
[26:40] talking about there he's talking about
[26:42] the convention manager to Petrine but he
[26:45] takes away your fellowship you don't
[26:47] even come that's you Joan up a tree the
[26:52] leaves the widest locust is eating away
[26:55] at believes taken away your fellowship
[26:57] you have no fellowship with Christ you
[27:01] have no fellowship with God you have no
[27:03] fellowship with your brothers and
[27:05] sisters why because that first stage
[27:07] visas ain't away at the love the joy and
[27:11] the peace now he's taking my way to
[27:13] fellowship you see how this goes again
[27:20] in your mind that's where the battle
[27:23] begins in the mind amen
[27:26] now he goes on well we'll continue here
[27:29] in the restoration of the bride tree
[27:34] makes it cool the birds fly up under now
[27:37] I'll move on where people could come and
[27:39] sat down under the fellowship of the
[27:40] holy spirit of cool off the bit where
[27:43] all the frustration and don't know what
[27:49] happened and whether you die or whether
[27:52] you're saved or not you don't know
[27:55] whether this church is right
[27:57] well that church is right just come down
[28:00] under the tree that's got some leaves on
[28:04] it sit down there while let the winds
[28:07] from heaven blow like the mighty rushing
[28:10] wind through the leaves and begin to
[28:13] cool you off a little bit
[28:15] amen see that beast begins to take away
[28:19] a man the leaves of fellowship the
[28:25] locust has done Amen the locust has
[28:28] eaten his name was Satan in heavenly
[28:31] places what is it
[28:32] coolness comfort feeling at home I like
[28:36] we was in prayer last night and I guess
[28:40] my brother Quentin he volunteers at the
[28:41] hospital then I guess he had a chance to
[28:44] hold his little baby and he was talking
[28:47] about it just last night in his
[28:50] and that baby felt comfortable
[28:54] he said he held a baby for hours and
[28:57] that baby just fell asleep as he's
[28:59] holding that baby that baby felt safe
[29:02] that baby felt protected that baby felt
[29:07] that he was he was comfortable a man
[29:10] just kind of resting in in my brother's
[29:13] arms there and I and it must have did
[29:15] something to him
[29:16] a man has had done something that
[29:18] paper and that baby was able to just
[29:20] rest that's where we should be under the
[29:24] juniper tree the leaves of fellowship
[29:27] find comfort peace where were able to
[29:31] just rest under the Shekinah glory be
[29:33] fair daugther the beau juniper tree rest
[29:36] in the arms of God but you see that that
[29:39] BC wants to eat away at that fellowship
[29:41] wants to keep you out of church wants to
[29:44] keep you away the Prophet was saying
[29:46] that was the mistake that that rich
[29:48] young ruler me he said he was had so
[29:52] many earthly Goods that he felt like
[29:55] Jesus asked him to cut sell all your
[29:58] stuff and come follow me but no doubt
[30:02] that he was a was a part of a great
[30:04] businessman association and he didn't
[30:07] want to lose his fellowship see they'd
[30:11] ever give you an another fellowship that
[30:14] does nothing for you
[30:17] amen so we got to watch that beast my
[30:20] brothers and sisters so when you begin
[30:21] to feel that way in you in the mind that
[30:24] doubles telling you you know what it is
[30:27] you know exactly what it is and you
[30:31] rebuke that devil then move on the next
[30:33] stage he says this little ol cankerworm
[30:39] this can't go wrong and what does the
[30:41] cankerworm do the cankerworm goes after
[30:46] the bark of that tree let's go and look
[30:50] at this again here we're in mark for
[30:54] this locust
[30:57] it says here and others fell on good
[30:59] ground and did I'm sorry go back to 7
[31:03] and some fell on amongst thorns and
[31:05] thistles and they grew up and choked it
[31:07] out and they producing no fruit not sick
[31:09] but when the Sun come up its scorched it
[31:12] because the root and it wizzard away and
[31:17] some fell on stony ground and not had
[31:20] much earth I'm reading this backwards
[31:22] stone the ground and not had much earth
[31:24] and immediately it spring up because it
[31:27] had no depth of earth but when the Sun
[31:30] come up it was scorched and because it
[31:33] had no root it withered away now the
[31:36] next stage of that beast we see we're
[31:38] eating away at this tree God planted
[31:41] this tree and you should be see how some
[31:44] know the seeds fell here somebody sees
[31:46] Fred there but we started from a healthy
[31:47] tree and we see how he's taking it all
[31:50] the way down hey man
[31:52] now some didn't make it to a healthy
[31:54] tree some didn't make it to a healthy
[31:57] tree these stages here are you see where
[32:00] some grew up but they they kind of got
[32:02] stalled in their development because
[32:05] they were not claimed it in the right
[32:06] place they didn't fall on good ground
[32:12] remember he said I have to shoe to know
[32:15] the mysteries amen nobody understood
[32:20] what he was talking about when he said
[32:22] this parable not even the disciples but
[32:26] because they came to him and simply
[32:29] asked he said unto you because you asked
[32:36] I'll show you that's the good ground
[32:43] because it wouldn't have grew up in them
[32:45] if they hadn't asked you see what I'm
[32:49] saying
[32:50] if they hadn't asked they wouldn't know
[32:52] but because they asked he showed them
[32:56] the mystery of what each stage is amen
[33:02] now this cankerworm it's a way at the
[33:06] bar
[33:07] what is the bark the bark of that tree
[33:10] is the
[33:11] the ring of that tree one the most
[33:14] important organ we have on our body is
[33:16] our skin because it protects us from
[33:19] what infection if you have a wound or
[33:24] open wound you are susceptible to it
[33:27] getting infected and anything entering
[33:29] into your body through that open wound
[33:32] so that covering on that tree that Bart
[33:36] is its protection oh my or here comes
[33:40] that can't go on what is a little
[33:44] protection my brothers and sisters the
[33:46] blood of Jesus the blood of Jesus so
[33:51] this tree that he eats away it
[33:54] we're wrapped when he when Adam and Eve
[33:58] fail they think they went and got fig
[34:02] leaves no that ain't gonna protect you
[34:09] those leaves desitin whoo the
[34:12] denominational covering it won't protect
[34:15] you what they had to have blood up
[34:18] against the skin so he sacrificed a lamb
[34:23] bloody wool through it they put that on
[34:26] the process said in the cruelty of sin
[34:29] and the blood just streaming down their
[34:32] body oh my we're washed in the blood of
[34:36] the word that is our protection
[34:40] that is our covering but what is this
[34:44] kanker worm do begin to interject
[34:48] Cree's dogmas and false doctrine to take
[34:53] away your covering because that ain't
[34:57] before give you a fig leaf give you a
[35:02] fig leaf covering take away your
[35:06] protection because we protect it by the
[35:10] blood of the word amen so we see that
[35:16] cankerworm now not not now you probably
[35:19] can see in
[35:22] times were maybe different ones they
[35:27] begin myself I see how this knot is
[35:31] worse as it happened you don't realize
[35:36] that it's fine setting that beat you in
[35:37] the mind it takes away all of these
[35:39] different things and loved your piece
[35:41] and you don't want to go to church
[35:43] anymore
[35:43] so struggle to get the church when you
[35:46] start feeling that way you get down on
[35:48] your knees and you rebuked that devil
[35:51] because he's eating away at the
[35:53] fellowship and what's next he can get
[35:56] you to stop coming to church now you
[35:59] start accepting false doctrine see it
[36:03] all the time you see it you begin to
[36:08] start accepting false doctrine what is
[36:10] it you infected infected with the
[36:15] disease infected with the devil you're
[36:19] restarting the accept this fig leaf it
[36:23] won't protect you all that thing is
[36:27] gonna protect you is the bleeding
[36:29] bloody dripping Word of God for your day
[36:36] amen
[36:37] but that's what this cankerworm does
[36:40] amen
[36:42] eats away and we see here it came to
[36:45] pass that the soil some fell by the way
[36:47] side and the fowls of the air choked it
[36:49] out they never grew up never grew up
[36:55] that can't make that one got in there
[36:57] right from the beginning because it
[36:59] didn't fall on good ground it didn't
[37:02] have the nutrient Wow
[37:03] again I say because they just didn't ask
[37:07] they didn't man even as a small tree now
[37:10] when that seed is planted into the
[37:14] ground and it's starting to come up they
[37:18] don't have no a respective person there
[37:20] take a full-grown tree just like that
[37:22] those stay for stayed bisa eat a small
[37:24] tree cut it off because it was not
[37:29] planning in good ground good ground
[37:33] you're gonna have
[37:34] protection good ground you're gonna have
[37:38] that until it grows into a statue of a
[37:40] perfect man come on that and it has
[37:44] these defenses and it has the knowledge
[37:47] within itself to protect itself to
[37:51] strive amen now we see the next stage of
[37:55] this four stage beasts a man is the
[37:58] caterpillar now we want to look at
[38:00] something here I want you to go back to
[38:02] mark the third chapter and we're going
[38:06] to read from the 28th verse we're going
[38:13] to read from the 28th verse
[38:22] I'm a man 28th verse it says verily I
[38:27] say unto you all sins shall be forgiven
[38:30] unto the son of man and blasphemous
[38:34] wherewith soever they shall blaspheme
[38:39] but he that shall blaspheme against the
[38:42] Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness but is
[38:47] in danger of eternal damnation now what
[38:54] does that caterpillar do prophets say
[38:57] that caterpillar is a he's a sucker and
[39:01] he sucks the very life out of the root
[39:07] of that tree sucks the very life out of
[39:12] it
[39:13] what doesn't then you wouldn't if he
[39:15] sucks the life out of a tree I mean the
[39:18] tree is day it now let me say something
[39:25] you may be dead why you living dead why
[39:33] you living death means eternally
[39:38] separated from God that's what that
[39:42] caterpillar is trying to do he's trying
[39:46] to get you to a point he sucked the very
[39:49] life out of you I don't don't mean that
[39:53] don't mean you in the in the ground that
[39:57] you're bought you're not living flesh
[40:00] wise but spiritually you did hold on I
[40:05] and you could be going to church every
[40:07] Sunday and going through all of the
[40:12] motions but spiritually dead and has
[40:19] then verse 29 verse 29 and eternally
[40:28] separated from God I want to say this
[40:30] watch what you say about this mess
[40:34] because it's not a man this is what that
[40:39] caterpillar is trying to do suck the
[40:43] very life out of you this four stage
[40:50] bees but thank me to God
[40:53] thank be to God turn to Joelle chapter
[40:57] twenty five a man Joelle twenty five
[41:18] Chuck I'm sorry chocolate ooh 25th
[41:21] birthday man 225 and the Lord said I
[41:33] will restore to you the years that the
[41:40] locust has eaten the cankerworm and the
[41:45] caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great
[41:48] army which I sent unto you and ye shall
[41:51] eat in plenty and be satisfied and
[41:55] praise the name of the Lord your God
[41:57] that hath dealt with you wondrously with
[42:01] you and my people shall never be ashamed
[42:06] amen
[42:07] so we see that the devil is already
[42:11] defeated when did he do the restaurant
[42:14] at Calvary the restoration began at
[42:21] Calvary what do we have to do let go and
[42:27] let God but even in these subject right
[42:31] here in this message that the Prophet
[42:34] brought in restoration of the bride tree
[42:38] what is it my brothers and sisters I
[42:40] have you to know the mysteries of this
[42:44] forest agency in the message the
[42:48] greatest battle ever fought the Prophet
[42:51] said you have to know how to fight if
[42:53] you know how he's coming you know how to
[42:56] bow sort of meaning this moss this
[43:02] flying insect come and land on your
[43:05] fruit and begin to eat away at your love
[43:09] begin to eat away at your joy begin to
[43:13] eat away at your peace begin to eat away
[43:16] at your meeting this but can you eat up
[43:18] where the fruits of the spirit you shoot
[43:21] a devil away you shoot a devil Oy
[43:27] say no you're not gonna get my first you
[43:31] can't have my fruit devil I bind you in
[43:33] the name of Jesus get thee behind me
[43:35] Satan
[43:36] I love my brothers and sisters I love
[43:39] this word of God you get down on your
[43:41] knees and you rebuke that though you
[43:44] don't continue to think on it
[43:49] continue to think on it and allow it's a
[43:54] festive and select CCC backpack that
[43:58] that insect can't grow if he don't eat
[44:01] he's just an insect and he flies away
[44:04] but if you allow him to eat he grow into
[44:08] the locust now you go from the front row
[44:12] to the back room and the next place is
[44:16] out the dope see it every time okay and
[44:23] then after you get out the dough what he
[44:25] eats away at the bar you wearing makeup
[44:28] you're not cut you half you're wearing
[44:31] pants and brother you wear shorts he
[44:34] takes a winter doctrine I didn't give in
[44:36] to that but it's in there right there
[44:39] and Mark say when Jesus came and he he
[44:42] went into the synagogue and he preached
[44:46] and today was astounded by his doctrine
[44:50] they was astounded by his doctor then he
[44:54] preached this doctrine and they say well
[44:57] what manacled out is priests in the
[44:59] synagogue well that wait a minute man
[45:01] you says we propose we know the Bible we
[45:05] know we know we know to buy booster and
[45:07] the process say they knew it knew it
[45:09] well by letter but not by spirit why
[45:13] because they didn't go into the presence
[45:16] of Jesus and say what meanest thou
[45:23] that's a good message
[45:25] what meanest out is what meanest out is
[45:29] and he say oh you ask I'm glad you asked
[45:33] so I'll show you the mystery amen
[45:37] what meanest out is
[45:40] the meaning of this is she will wait at
[45:44] first beasts that first insect so simple
[45:47] now that morph is light you don't even
[45:49] know we do
[45:50] he's a very small insect very light very
[45:55] sneaky gets into your mind and begins to
[46:00] eat away the fruit shoot I don't Louie
[46:03] then he goes after the leaves you
[46:06] fellowship in your doctrine Amy huh get
[46:10] you talking about the word talking about
[46:12] the myth get you against a word I'm
