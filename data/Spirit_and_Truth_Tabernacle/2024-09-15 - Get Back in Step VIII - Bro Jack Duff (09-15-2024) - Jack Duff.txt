that and and uh they would that's how the churches would fellowship and um they always want you to bring choir and uh and often times the choir didn't want to go but my uncle was one that he would show up and and uh and represent the church I'm talking about when I was just a uh I mean young probably Brother Joseph age maybe even younger than that and we would have to walk uh up and down the the city we walk to the church and walk back home and so back in those days um um Kentucky Fried Chicken used to have these fries and I I mean ain't nobody had fries like that since and even KFC don't

days and and my uncle would always sing that song um amazing grace shall be my song of praise and and just as a as a young lad that just stayed with me you know and even when I when I see him today because the Lord has blessed him uh he had a a wonderful military career amen and making it to a three star general and then from there uh becoming the president of uh Hampton University but you know people see him in that role but I see him as that little boy following him to church and uh realizing how faithful he was back then and to see how God has blessed him Amen in his latter years so young

his brothers and sisters here to the service and um and um I I I I for one I appreciate that I I'm I'm very grateful and um you know but we we realize he has some other responsibilities amen but he he sees this also as a responsibility and uh he he makes it happen so God bless you uh brother brother Nehemiah God richly bless you amen I'm a I'm going read uh a couple scriptures and uh I'll ask that you stand with me as we read read the word of the Lord um um going back to the Book of Joel amen uh chapter 1 and verse 4 and then also Joel two we'll read from there as well but we um we thank the Lord for this little journey that he has us on our theme for this year is get back in step and um and and there this this goes in so many many uh uh uh places uh but uh what we're focusing on this uh morning is is this uh third part of the restoration which was the restoration of the gifts amen into the church and um uh so we want to continue our journey that we started on last week so Joel 1 4 says this that which the palmerworm ha left ha the Locust eaten and that which the Locust ha left uh hath the korm eaten and that which uh the korm had left hath a caterpillar eaten and uh over into chapter two we just kind of pick up uh I'll start at verse 25 amen uh for today just to kind of shorten the reading it says I will restore to you the years that the Locust ha eaten the the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm palmerworm my great Army which I sent among you and ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people should never be ashamed and ye shall know that I am uh in the midst of Israel that I am the Lord your God and none else and my people should never be ashame it should come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon and All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also upon uh the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out of my spirit and I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth blood and fire and pillars of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the Great and the terrible day of the Lord come and it should come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name name of the Lord shall be delivered from Mount Zion and in Jerusalem uh shall be Deliverance as the Lord has said and in the remnant whom the Lord shall call amen Lord at a blessing to the reading of his word let's just quickly pray father we thank you for uh the ability to read the scripture but we know it takes the Holy Ghost to make the word live uh for the day in which we are living so speak to our hearts God in only way that you can minister to every need I may have notes I may have a thought that I'm I feel you've given me to present to the people but Lord you know the needs of the people so God I ask that you Minister ter heart uh those present those online speak father only words that you can in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you uh you can be seated amen praise the Lord so we will continue our journey here with get back in step and again the theme uh is I will restore saith the Lord um I was um throughout this this this whole uh study or this time of uh just just this series there was a there's a sermon that was ministered by a God's prophet and and I want you to kind of try to get the the um um just how God does things brother Brandon was sitting in church one um one day I don't know if it was a Sunday morning or what it was but he was sitting in church listening to brother Neville preach brother Neville was actually um really he was the pastor uh there at the church because brother Brandon was gone so much on the field that he um he he had a brother that started out as a deacon uh well no no no no I'm sorry not brother Neville it's another brother but uh brother Neville uh came over as a pastor another church and he started pastoring there at brandom Tabernacle and as he preached that morning uh brother brandham sat there and heard a statement about restoration from Brother Neville and from that the Holy Spirit gave him inspiration uh to preach the message the restoration of the Bride tree and he preached the uh probably about a twoh hour or so sermon uh from a statement that was made through brother Neville now there's there's so many things that I can say right there and I might as well say it um um brother brandom got his inspiration from a man preaching live Amen in the in the church and now we've come to a spot where people want to take the preachers out of the church and just put uh tapes in only praise the Lord and uh and I want to just tell you uh we we don't want to do that the the tapes don't replace the live preaching amen the tapes are there to encourage us and to strengthen us and you know give us direct I mean often times I listen to a tape and I get inspired by I was listening to Restoration Bri tree and I got inspired to bring this sermon right this whole series so uh nothing wrong with that but that's not to replace the preaching amen God don't order ordained tape recorders to preach the gospel amen that's not what God do God ordained men to preach the gospel so uh if you ever run into something like that no we don't stand for that here we we we believe that men should be preaching the gospel amen and uh so in in this sermon um brother brandom begins to kind of he he has this inspiration of um of our restore and and the way he gets the inspiration is from a situation that happened in the church there was a brother that lost uh he was at church and while he's sitting in church somebody comes up and steals this man car and um and so you know when when when the car was stolen after church you know they they go outside and the man's done drove for hours to get to church and now his car and everything in the car is gone suitcases everything gone so they begin to you know the brothers got a little worried and concern and they knew there was a little ring going on with they were taking cars and repainting them and changing the plates and doing all kind of stuff then reselling it and they like brother your car probably gone they probably got it they did this and said well let's just pray about it and uh they got brother brandom and they prayed about it and then God gave him uh a scripture that he been uh uh meditating on if you abide in me praise God and my words abide in you amen hallelujah the Bible says you can ask what you will now there is there's a there's an important part before you ask anything of God the first part is you have to be abiding you can't be coming in and going out and coming in and going out you got to be abiding in him if you want to see that type of power in your life you got to be abiding if you abide in me and then my word has to abide in you then you can ask what you will brother and sisters I'm just telling youall we've been abiding in this for a long time and we know this word been abiding us for a long time I believe we've entered into the season where we can ask what we will and not just ask it'll be done after we ask can I tell you something don't be afraid to ask if you've been Abiding and his word abiding you don't be afraid to ask God got something for you but but but that inspiration struck him so then he just be they they begin to pray underneath that inspiration and a vision came in the prayer the car is coming back is going to come back with half half a tank of gas it's going to be waiting for you over in this area you'll find it right over there told him exactly where to go and get the car now I'm I'm just I'm going to be honest with you I don't think that God died when brother random left here I don't think that God died we we supposed to see Visions we supposed to have dreams according to what I just read in the scripture this is supposed to happen in the church but like I said we done preached it so far out of the church amen that we don't see it no more but God said our will restore sayith the Lord not say brother Jack sayith the Lord somebody got to catch the inspiration of what God is saying in his word and begin to preach that back to the church as we preach the promises we'll see the promises made manifest so there uh the the whole our store also came from the story of Sarah in scripture and um Abraham took off down there because of a famine in the land and he took off down there to I believe it was gar aimc was the king and I and I've I've shared with you all many times how AMC was just praying that God would send him a wife he wanted to have some children and uh and he was praying that God was send him a wife and here comes Abraham with a 90y old woman amen a 9y old woman walking into this this city and this man began to ask questions like he he looked at Sarah at 90 now now you already know something Supernatural must have happened to Sarah for this man to desire her to be his wife wife not only be his wife but be his wife to have kids by can I can I can I say something else this man had no idea Sarah was actually Barren that man didn't even know Sarah was a barren woman but yet when he saw her he's like and and and God had changed her uh from the inside to reflect on the outside and when God changed this man say I got to take her as my wife you say she your sister yeah that's my sister this is your brother yeah that's my brother well you know what thank God for that because I needed a new wife took on down there to the house and and as he's thanking God for this new wife uh God comes to him in a dream and say don't you touch that man's wife he said wife so wait a minute I thought the man said that's my sister she said brother I know what they said but that's his wife and you better not touch her and then he used this term I want to go to Genesis 20 and 7 I want to go to Genesis 20 and 7 because there's a little bit more in this story that I need to read for today praise the Lord he uses this term therefore restore the man his wife Glory this is where I I will restore sayth the Lord oh I I I I like I just love the word of God I like reading that restore the man his wife and I'm I'm saying that to the devil restore the man his wife give her back that's pretty much what God is saying give that man's wife back and he didn't have this man I mean AMC didn't have no um no choice in this all he could do is exactly what God say because he said now therefore restore the man his wife amen for he is a prophet not a liar he is a prophet amen and then he said says this um uh uh and and he shall pray for thee and thou shalt live and if thou restore her not know thou that thou shalt surely die thou and all that are thine my my my my my my my let's keep going here I want to read a little bit more therefore aimc Rose early in the morning and called all his servants and told all these things in their ears and the men were so afraid after they heard what the dream that he had and what happened in the dream and then he says then ailec called Abraham and said unto him what hast thou done unto us and what have and what have I offended thee that thou has brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin thou has done Deeds unto me that ought not to be done right and then aimc said unto Abraham what sawest thou that thou has done this thing why you lied to me like that right well that thou has done this thing he says and Abraham said because I thought now this where a lot of us get in trouble with because of what we think because I thought surely the fear of God is not in this place and they will slay me for my wife's sake he says and yet indeed she is my sister she is the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother and she became my wife he let that part he left that part out right he says and it came to pass when God caused me to wander from my father's house that I said unto her this is thy kindness which thou shal so show unto me at every place whether we shall come save me he is my brother look and ailec took sheep now this is the part that I want you to catch because God told him say now let that man pray for you rece Resto that man's wife now he didn't just restore the man's wife he gave some gifts to Abraham so in the season of restoration amen we should see gifts being given back watch this now look look look at verse 14 it says AMC took sheep and oxen and men's servants and women's servants and gave them unto Abraham and restored him Sarah his wife glory to God and aimc said behold my land is before thee dwell where it pleaseth thee wherever you want to wherever you want to live you can have it right he say he says and unto s said behold I have given thy brother oh my my my a thousand pieces of silver gifts I've given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver behold he is to thee a covering of the eyes amen unto all that are with thee and with all others thus thus she was prooved and I want you to get this Abraham never asked for this Hallelujah but because he had favor with God God gave him this amen God gave Abraham gifts in the restoration oh my and this is a part of the restoration the gifts are part of the restoration that's all I'm trying to tell you this morning amen let me go on a little further it says um uh verse 17 but so Abraham prayed unto God and God healed ailec and and and here here's another one here's another one and his wife and his maid servants and uh and his mid servants and they bear children now I want you to understand what happened is that when Sarah came into the house oo Lord have mercy Sarah was a barren woman but because he had the wrong woman in his house barness struck the whole house but the way baress was taken away is when Abraham prayed for ailec so a priest or a prophet or amen someone like that can pray for you and your baress can be taken away a minister can take it away if you got faith in what he's saying oh my church church amen for the Lord had fast closed up all the woms of the house of ailec because of Sarah Abraham's wife baress was taken away I I just li like I like this gifts were given barness was taken away I mean and and if I could just put it this way Abraham had the the gift of healing just through his prayer the gift of healing took place let's go on a little further let's read let's read something from the restoration of the BR tree I I I know where I'm standing at this morning now now there is uh I'm giving you the natural I've just given you the natural type and um but I want to now bring in the spiritual type you know I I might not have updated this on you all's list but if you all would put in your table app search Sarah a type of the church Sarah a type of the church I'm going to be reading from restoration of the Bri tree um brother brandom now takes this this this this natural type that I just shared and now we're going to switch it and bring it over to the spirit because when you look at a woman in the scripture anytime you read you know about a woman a woman in scripture you have to think of the church amen because the woman represents the church in the Bible amen just don't you know Sarah say no no no no I mean they represent us as a church so so look at it a little deeper now watch this he makes this statement it says Sarah a type of the church Church the true church the Free Church the free woman amen uh Hagar would have been the Bond woman and and when Sarah tried to use Hagar to bring forth a child it just created problems she told Abraham now I don't think that her thought was I don't I don't think God G to use me to be able to bring forth this child I ain't had no children all these years I don't think it's going to happen now I'm I'm too old to have a child so but you can take hagga her thought was to take hagga and you can have a child by her and then I I'll raise that child the problem was it it it just never worked so then when when when when when Sarah comes up with this idea Abraham goes along with it and they get a child ishmail is born and it just create problems in that household it was so so it was so bad that Sarah told Abraham I know I told you to go to Hagar but now I'm coming back to you you going have to tell Hagar and her son to leave that's how bad it was in that house right and Abraham said you know mama I got to cast my own son out you have to him and his mama got to go and here you know Abraham cast him out God took care of them but you know um all the problems that we have in the Middle East comes from that it stems from that right there it it it's the the children of Israel are the children from Isaac right the promised son that that's the natural flow of the seed line from Isaac but the other ones amen that surround them cuz if you ever go to Israel let me tell you something you wouldn't be able to tell the difference I I I went to the Gaza Strip and it just a wall that was separating it's like Rivier Beach and West Palm Beach and and just a little wall in between and we went down to Gaza Strip Gaza Strip is where Bethlehem was and Bethlehem is where Jesus was born but you they had signs up say no Israelites better come past this wall that's right but but but I couldn't tell you know I I I I I couldn't tell who was Israelite and who wasn't I I had know but they know yeah all right they know and they and and and and um I just remember you know just kind of being down in there and my God some rough things that happened but but but what what we find is that the those people they are the sons of ishmail and they've always had a problem with the promised seat amen so this suggestion that Sarah had actually created a bigger problem problem not just for that they household but for many households they got a big problem nowadays all right let me keep reading look it says Sarah type of the Church the true church the Free Church the free woman with a free child type of the Holy the the Born Again Church with the promise let them say whatever they want to call it Holy Roller fanaticism they've tried to stop it since Pentecost and they'll never do it oh my God now these statements are very important they've tried to stop the gifts in the church amen since Pentecost they called it fanaticism they called it out of order they called it uh uh you and your flesh they called it all kind of things and they called you a Holy Roller right I mean they they said all kind of stuff about in order to try to stop those gifts from going forth in the church let me go on a little further now it says they've tried to stop it since Pentecost and they'll never do it they'll never do it he says no sir it it says just keep your hands off of it so so watch this now it says that's all God's going to uh that's all that's all God is going to take that and do something with it just as certain as I'm standing here I'm coming right down through the age of it now in a few minutes God help me I'll prove it to you where we're where we're at right they're never going to destroy it cannot be destroyed let me just let me just make sure we got that if God is giving your gift can't nobody take it from you I'm going tell you this right now they can never destroy what God has ordained to happen nobody can preach it out because God ordained it to be here I will read you promises out of the scripture hallelujah amen I I before I even get there I'll just tell God promised in the book of Isaiah that with stammering lips will I speak to them now when Isaiah wrote that I'm sure people thought this man is really crazy what is a stammering lip what's a Stam lip but yet it was there in the scripture and it had to be made manifest and on the day of Pentecost it was made manifest hallelujah hallelujah but God didn't just stop at the day of Pentecost he's the same yesterday today and forever and he's still moving on in the same manner can I tell y'all God used his stammering lips to speak to his people right all right let me keep reading let me keep reading um it says they they're never going to destroy it can't be destroyed that's right and look at what he just said look at watch this next statement take your hands off of her the church oh I told y'all Sarah represent the church now he's speaking to the church and now he's telling the devil take your hands off of her you've been stifling her for years years you've been uh suppressing her depressing her oppressing her but take your hands off of her oh my God my God take your hands off of her why there come the natural seed the natural seed had to come says uh if Sarah would have been married this other man the natural seed would would would have never been born he's talking about ailec it had God not intervene and stop aimc amen from this desire to want to have children through Sarah he would have messed up God's program I'mma oh Lord have mercy Jesus God was not uh I I I want to I I I have to say kind of watch How I say this yes he was protecting Abraham but actually he was protecting something greater than Abraham he was protecting his promise and Abraham just happened to be the one to get the promise but God was protecting his promise God could not let his word fall to the ground and return void and if God could not do that in the days of Abraham and Sarah God can't do that today if he said your sons and your daughters going to prophesy then it's got to happen some kind of way it ain't up to us to do this we ain't got to manufacture this this is God's promise and he watch over his word to perform [Applause] it take your hands offer High loose her and let her go she's a free woman not a bond bound woman free in the spirit Hallelujah hey the word is what sets you free when you recognize your position in the word no I ain't going to be bound no more I refuse to be [Applause] bound oh my God my God that's why brother brandham say this take your hands off of her SAT take your hands off and people have used the word to try to bind the church brother brandom say the Holy Ghost been bound by denominational Rivers for for over 2,000 years but this is the season where it's got to be released and when Abraham when Abraham and Sarah were restored restor that man his wife then they gave gifts to Abraham things he didn't even ask for and some of y'all ain't even ask for the gift of knowledge and wisdom and speaking in tongues but you'll get it anyway because every church every local church is supposed to have the non-spiritual gifts flowing in it right I'm I'm I'm I'm going keep on reading but I know where I'm standing Hallelujah I know what I'm looking for and and and and and and the other thing I want to make it clear we want gifts with a life don't don't be living like a devil and then trying to manifest in gifts that's what throw people off but I'm talking about the gift with the life you know this person been living right you don't seen him for years living right uh the word abiding in them and them abiding in the word no them the ones that we want manifesting and we realize when God begin to move you're going to have all kind of stuff if you see somebody with a a a a gift being manifested in your life and they ain't living nothing just praise God God bless you he you know why and and rain falling just and unjust and and that mean everybody going to get rain weeds get rain and weat get rain the grass get rain and the weeds get rain and then you know what you know what Jesus say when you see uh uh the the these tears growing with the wheat no no no you know what y'all do y'all get out there y'all start picking the tears Jesus said let it alone because if you start picking the tears the way it's wrapped around the wheat you actually hurt the wheat so that's why Jesus said just leave it alone let it grow together it said because at the end in the end time I'm going to take care of that problem so I'mma tell you something makees sure you are weak all right let me go on Hallelujah take your hands off of her why there come the natural seed the natural seed had to come uh if it would if Sarah would have married this other man the natural seed would have never been born so God had to protect uh his word right the promise that he say Sarah your wife going to have a son and he could not let this man touch Sarah amen because it would have messed up his promise so he had to make the man give give that man back his wife I know he lied to you but give that man back his wife because I got a I got a plan here and you messing up my plan glory to God give her back oh my my my my my can I if God had a plan for Sarah she represent you God has a plan for you and God will go through great extremes oh y'all ain't hearing me this morning God will go through great extrems he'll give a man a dream and come talk to him in his dream and say no no not her not him don't do that to him don't do that oh my God will go through great extremes to make sure he protects you and to protect the promise that he gave you he'll pull your children from out of out don't know where the pits of hell because he made you a promise and he said the promise is unto you and to your children and those that are far off as many as the Lord God shall call so whatever God got to do to bring his word to pass he will do it brother brandom say if God had to bankrupt heaven in order to fulfill one of your needs then he'll just bankrupt Heaven you got a financial need God will bankrupt Heaven on your behalf I don't care what bank told you no I don't care about the bank telling you know God will bankrupt [Applause] Heaven they beat done wrote a check and don't even know why they wrote the check and before they can figure it out the check will be [Applause] cash he says this uh if God so protected the the the course of the natural seed how much more for the spiritual Royal seed has he protected that's us Satan give them back turn them loose and now watch this now I'mma tell y'all something I know i' be reading quotes but if y'all could ever get to the spot where you can see this is actually being spoken to you in your situation right right now you will start repeating these words watch this one y'all y'all just say this after me Satan Satan give them back give them back turn them loose turn them loose now let me read the rest of it to you you're not smothering them out there in them organizations and things so when I read that I'm thinking wait a minute I got some family that know this message and that done turned and went to organization But as Sarah could not be kept in AMC's house as Sarah could not be kept or held captive in a BC's house my god brother brandom just said Satan turn them loose give them back turn them loose I'm speaking that over every one of my loved ones if they in the world turn them loose if they're in a denominational system turn them loose amen give them back my my that's what the restoration is all about but the restoration happens when we release it turn them loose and give them back look at what he says about them oh my my my my them organ organization and things that's the world things are the the world it says they are free people and you let them alone yeah turn them loose the Royal seed and I and I and I speak that over every every every one of your loved ones too turn them loose their Royal I don't care what they involved in turn them Loos turn them loose glory to God give them back give them back hey I'm looking for the restoration I'm under expectation for the restoration let me go on a little further I I I'm trying to move into something here let let's go on uh I'm I'm I'm continue reading here restoration of the Bri tree says now God talking of restoring now here in Joel he's talking about it I preached one on this before and now when I read the scripture in Joel chapter uh one and chapter two initially when I started this journey I I gave you all um um a uh definition from um theologian theologians got together they read this scripture and when they looked at it they said themselves we don't know what this means it's it's uncertain that's what the the people that studied the Bible for years and they run into that scripture and then they say this is uncertain we don't know what to mean so the average Church would pick up that scripture and say well we don't really know what to say here but in the message because we had a prophet I can take a whole series out of just that scripture that they're uncertain about and preach through the entire year from this one from this scripture that they're uncertain about that's the beauty of the message because a prophet begins to show you wait a minute this means this this means that this see if it if can I can I can I can I can I just make it real simple Joel was a prophet Isaiah was a Prophet Jeremiah was a prophet Moses was a prophet uh there's different ones in the scripture uh I I know I'm going miss some names here all these prophets that wrote the word Old Testament prophets that wrote the word if a Old Testament Prophet would write it wouldn't it take a prophet to reveal it again like I told you how is how do people going to understand what stammering lips mean actually when it just even even Isaiah when he say thus sayth the Lord a virgin going to conceive you can imagine the people that day like now look man uh really they you can imagine what they speaking at at dinner did and everybody the elephant in the room nobody want to talk about the elephant in the room and they just go oh yeah then we have a wonderful service today yeah it was a good service yeah it was [Music] great silent pauses silent PA pause it silent pause it then somebody maybe maybe one little boy in the in the house that don't know no better daddy did you hear the prophet he said a virgin was G to con oh boy just don't say things like that I don't know what to say about the prophet I really don't know what to say about him I just I think he's getting older see in their minds they thought and and and action like that and brother said there were some people that believed it during that time so you had girls walking around acting like they was pregnant virgins but that's not how God was manifesting his word that Prophet is going to come come years later oh my see so so um if it took prophets to write these things it take Prophet a prophet to understand what was written and give it back to us so let's pick up what he's saying to us now God talking of restoring now here in Joel he's talking about I preached on this once before and took it in another angle he says never thought never never thoroughly went through it as I intend to today and won't have time to do uh uh to do it where it ought to be done but God is speaking here in Joel God is speaking of his fruit tree amen that he planted God planted a fruit tree he planted it on the day of Pentecost hello y'all I want to just this is important God planted a fruit tree on the day of Pentecost and when God planted this fruit tree on the day of Pentecost he expected it to always give fruit it didn't just stop on the day of Pentecost but even for every generation after that they're supposed to get the fruit from this tree oh my I'm going to tell y'all what's on the tree in a second you do you want some fruit my my mama my my daddy put a fruit tree many fruit trees in his backyard now my daddy want just planting trees just to say his backyard look pretty but my daddy put them trees there for a purpose if they're fruit trees I want them to bear fruit if if if I'm putting a mango tree in the ground I want some mangoes i i i i and and and don't just give me any I want them haens [Music] don't know nothing about no mangoes my neighbor got this fruit tree like we don't know about these mangoes he got he got two different kind of mango trees the Hayden in the backyard but them turpentine in the front yard and uh and and like we don't know and we see them going around getting them hating they the big purple ones they like meat when you cut through them like meat like come on church I mean you get full off a hating you can make a real fruit salad with that but then he said then you know we see them over there getting all them haens and then uh that you know they want to be nice to us and they come and gave us a box of turpentine and I felt like now you going to have to keep these we want them and and look we know the difference we've been raised on these things we know the these little drinking mangoes getting you can't do nothing with this but the hating when you plant a fruit tree you want fruit God planted a fruit tree the prophet tell us God planted something on the day of Pentecost watch this now it says um God is speaking of his of his fruit of his fruit tree that he planted God planted a fruit tree he planted it on the day of Pentecost and he and he brought that tree there for a purpose he wanted it to bear his fruit word God's word he wanted a church that would keep his word and now now now watch this all down through the a so not just at Pentecost God wanted a church that was going to keep this all the way down Through the Ages right he says uh Eve had failed to keep it the Jews had failed to keep it the law had fail all had failed so God planted him a tree a tree now remember there was two trees in the Garden of Eden we know that you call you call them whatever you want I have my idea but anyhow one of them was a defile tree now now he now he he didn't go into great de detail here but you know I might as well just mention it while I'm here he planted two trees the tree of knowledge good and evil and the tree of life now um the the the the God's children were told you can eat from any Tree in this Garden but don't eat from the Tree of knowledge good evil don't eat from that tree and um Satan got into the serpent and and see this serpent that was in the garden actually stood on two feet like a man this animal that was in the garden he stood on two feet just like a man and he was the only animal in the garden that could actually have a conversation with the man he was the only one that could have it he just didn't have a soul inside of him right but but but but here he here here he is standing there and he's having conversations and you know Adam and Eve they have they have Fellowship all the time Adam was the one that named all these animals right so here this one day the serpent comes not and Eve not recognizing that the serpent had been anointed by the devil y'all don't believe Satan getting animals what happened to them pigs at in gadera why they jumped off a cliff the they was grazing eating and then the devil got into pigs and caused them to jump off off a cliff amen the devil gets into animals that dog you've been running from use the power in your mouth and tell Satan I bind you in the name of Jesus Satan can get inside of an animal when brother Brandon was crossing that path and that killer bull was there and that killer bull he need he just looked at him and and and and when he when he looked at him he just started doing like this brother brandom knew what that meant and he actually went looking for his gun but didn't have no gun now now what you think he was going to do if he looking for his gun I'mma have to shoot this bull because he knew a few weeks later that bull saw a brother walk by and did the same thing ran right over well when when brother brandom sees this and know get what's going happen he say uh I'm going to pray for one of God's sick people you go back and lay down in the name of Jesus he said that bull was doing this and got so far and just turned around and went back and laid down that's the power that we have not just he had we got that kind of power so you use your power but Satan get in animals and and what Satan did he got into he got into the serpent and he began to have this conversation he saying now now you know uh yeah God told us that we're not supposed to we can eat from any tree but not that tree uh you know the tree of knowledge could even in the one in the midst of the garden we're not supposed to eat that one said no no no you he say the day we eat that of thereof we going to die uh said now you won't surely die that's not really what was being said that that's not I mean ain't no death in God he's an eternal being there ain't no death in God so you won't surely die no God said you're gonna die Eve partook of the fruit and then she went and gave it to Adam now we know it was not a natural fruit tree that Eve ate from because the Bible begins to tell us that after she partook of this fruit fruit she got pregnant so we know automatically it's not an apple tree that she ate from it's not an apricot tree it's not a banana tree if she got pregnant from eating fruit now how people get pregnant today by eating fruit no there's a fruit in the midst of the garden and your body is the garden there's a fruit in the the midst of the garden and when you get them two fruit trees coming together we get problems if that's how children are born today that's how children were born back then amen and the only time God want them trees coming together CU we back in sanctification right only time God want them trees coming together is under the bonds of marriage am if you ain't married and you you you you intertwining your fruits and I'm trying to be is trying to clean it up a little bit but you got your your fruit all mixed up amen then you out of God's will way out of his will now I'm I'm going just tell you the reason that God can bless it in marriage is because God designed Adam and Eve and he gave them reproductive organs and brother Brandon say it it might have been God's will for Eve to have children that way it might have been God's will but but but they they actually didn't wait on the will of God they got ahead of God and it's created all these problems so it was no physical fruit tree just like when I just said that God planted a tree at the day of Pentecost that was not a physical fruit tree it was a spiritual tree but it got fruit on it and it's planted for a reason and I want to partake of these fruit I'm coming to tell you what's on the tree now just give me a second give me a second I'mma tell you what's on God's tree and it was planted at Pentecost look at this now now remember there was two trees in the Garden of Eden we know that you call them whatever you want to I have my idea but anyhow one of them was a defiled tree it got defiled and the other one wasn't defiled that tree of life come from God out of Heaven he said your fathers eat man and are dead but this tree you eat and you you live forever and the angel guarded that tree of life from the Garden of Eden kept it in Eden that tree of life is in Eden now spiritually speaking now notice now when this tree that God planted it was to Bear nine different kinds of fruit nine different kinds which means nine spiritual nine fruits of the spirit to go with the nine spiritual gifts that was God's tree he planted it in the Earth on the day of Pentecost oh my my my my my let me go a little further and then at Pentecost house where the church for the bride tree I'm sorry actually I got to stop there because I'm skipping down to another Another Part let's just read here really quick these fruit go to 1 Corinthians 12 he just told us what was on the tree he said it was nine spiritual gifts First Corinthians 12 it was planted at Pentecost and if it was planted at Pentecost you tell me when did God uproot this tree so if the tree is still planted it should still be bearing fruit you know when the children of Israel got into a little trouble one time they got on a little journey and they um they went for battle when they got there on battle went seven days with all the animals and they could find no water at all now you know people die if they if they if they don't have water certain amount of time so they got desperate and they knew that there if we try to turn around and go back seven days journey that's going to be 14 days with no water and some of us the animals ain't going to make it and some of us ain't going to make it they had nothing so they begin to uh like hey is there a Prophet or somebody we can go to and try to get an answer from God they said yeah yeah yeah there's a prophet here and and when they they went Elisha was there and they say um please we need a word from the Lord like um he says go to your false gods and and get a word from the Lord don't come to me to get no word from the Lord you don't need serve God you don't abide in me and my words abide in you don't come over here to me just go find your he say it was only because the presence of Jehoshaphat he says you know what I I I I say give me a minstral give me a I need an anointed musician somebody that can bring the presence of the Lord down they got a clean life that the spirit of God can flow through them and they say said give me one of them minrs and and and say okay they start playing some music next thing you know he got into the spirit music got him in the spirit and the man be to prophesy he says go go dig some ditches he says because you ain't G you ain't G to hear no wind you ain't GNA you ain't GNA feel no rain but dig the ditches dig them as deep as you can because there's going to be water in the ditch so we ain't going be no wind and ain't going to be no rain ain't gonna be no this and and but it's going to be one what and so so brother brand say where the water came from where the water come from he says because the he said the water came from the spiritual Rock which was Christ that was following them that same Rock is following us today brother sister their rock is not like our Rock they got water from a desperate situation we're going to get gifts out of a desperate situation where were the gifts they were always there oh my God my God let me keep on reading I'm here in in 1 Corinthians 12 I want to start at verse four now there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit and there are differences of administrations but the same Lord now this is very important that we understand this in scripture uh because when when it comes to gifts in a church somebody be like well God don't use me as much as he used so and so and God don't do this and go no no no no no no don't don't compare yourself with anybody don't don't do that God use you where he wants to use you and you got to learn to be satisfied with what he does through you all us are made different I got I got six other preachers in this church you know everybody preach different and and I've always said this if um if uh if if a 100% of us were alike then 99% of us would not be needed if 100% of us were alike then 99% of us would not be needed so let's appreciate our differences amen we all preach different we all approach the word different and and we learn to appreciate that I I'm not trying to be nobody and I I don't want nobody trying to be me be yourself just give us the word that's all just give us the way God use you to give the word give us the word even even when it come to singers you know uh there are certain songs go for certain singers musicians are different I I'm just sitting there thinking about the song that brother brother caper song I mean uh that's what I came up on but what are what are the musicians coming up on today and the kids in church sitting what songs are they hearing that's going to carry them 30 40 years from now if the Lord ter what is it it's going to be different but it's okay that is different long as it got the word in it that's what matters the most cuz the word is what's going to keep you but we all different the musicians play their styles are different singers sing different I mean uh there are certain songs but you just give it to sister Tina you know one of them give it to sister Tina don't don't give it to me I can't do nothing with it but that's not my that's just not me but then there's other like praise and worship songs get that one to me I'll take that I got that amen we all different we all made different it's okay it's okay and and we all got different administrations certain notes that some people can hit I can't hit and ain't no sense to me trying to do that hello don't don't don't get jealous of somebody else gift this is this is what has messed up the church sometime this person God always speaking this person I I don't hear from God at all first thing another thing I'm going to tell you I'm going just I'm going tell you this now you might not you might not know this but you're G to know it today God don't speak as much as people say he speak 1 Corinthians 12 let me what verse my you going to realize that one day cuz everybody's ready say the Lord told me just what you got to learn how to do is like Jeremiah Jeremiah went to church one day and he heard a man say the Lord said and Jeremiah know the Lord told him something different you know what Jeremiah said have he heard that man prophesy amen then later on he got them to himself because you got these people all worked up like that you're going to die before you see a manifestation just sometimes just learn amen just move on don't make nothing out of Amen but you ain't got that that don't mean you re receiving it y'all know how y'all give me y amen sometime all right let me keep reading amen preach fastor preach n no I can feel right through that all right 1 Corinthians 12 these are the fruit that's on this tree and God got fruit that we want to partake of brother br said God planted this on the day of Pentecost and I I want these fruit I I got to have them man don't give me them turpentine haens I know what a hating is I know what I I know what it tastes like glory to God all right look at this verse five and there are differences of administrations but the same Lord and there are differences I'm sorry and and there are diversities of operations but is the same God which worketh all in all so it's diversity of operations they operate differently everybody operate differently it's okay but it's the same God in control of it all watch this now am I reading the Bible and it says this it says and there are diversities of operations but it is the same God which worketh all in all look at this but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all we all get benefit from this for to one is given by the spirit who gave it spirit the word of wisdom we were in prayer on on um Tuesday night and brother Solomon made a statement in his prayer that just stuck with me it's like Lord we see the gift of wisdom in our church it says when we were going through the co protocols that was wisdom speaking to us amen and and and and and sometime we don't even recognize what God is doing in our midst and and and and let me tell you something I I ain't got time to read all of this but but I'm going give you some homework read 1 Corinthians 12 when you go home because other thing that tell that start telling us that you know the gifts are like parts of the body your natural body your your hand can't say I don't need the feet and and and and the ears don't need this and and and and heart saying I don't need the liver I you can't be saying things like that no no and like and even like like this all these four fingers sitting together but the fifth one the way over here these these can't talk to the thumb and say we don't need you even when you try to come close to us look at how you stand next to us we don't need you we don't need you I can't even hold this microphone it I can try but it has no support and in the slightest move I might drop it but what locks it what locks it is when I bring that thumb around now I feel secure and God designed the body that way every piece of the body is needed even my little toe you let me stump my little toe my my my my mother-in-law did that last week she she hit a sidewalk or something like that with that little to the whole body felt it the whole body was wrecking with pain just from hitting the toe so look we we not we not trying to demeanor or minimize any gift that's in the body we want to encourage every gift that is in the body it's different administrations it's different operations and this is important to understand because it might look different on a different person I mean everybody different so this gift might look different on this person than it does on that one so don't don't try to gauge it B it should do no no it's the Holy Ghost The Same Spirit but it's different administrations different operations it's diversities that's the way God is let me go on I'm reading on this is what's on the tree this is on the tree that God planted at Pentecost what verse am I on verse eight okay for one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom that's the first gift first fruit on the tree the to another the word of knowledge and that's that's important sometimes knowledge can come in different forms uh let me just I'm just I'm all over the place now knowledge some sometimes just come in this General conversation that we having and somebody might have learned something from a prior experience that they can share with you so you can avoid a future mistake knowledge amen and sometime you know what it could come through you know the I don't know why I felt led to tell you this but the Lord just keep impressing me for to just tell you this and I don't know why he telling me to tell you this you don't know what that person going through at the time and that word of knowledge is coming forth now let me kind of stop there because there's another side to this you done heard something that somebody done told you and now you feel led to tell me something it's sometimes it's hard to receive that as a word of knowledge right amen but I tell you what when when it's somebody that don't know me and don't know nothing about me and the Lord just keep telling me to tell you this knowledge oh my let me keep going um to another the word of knowledge by The Same Spirit to another Faith now what is this if you don't know what this is I I I I wish that you would had the opportunity to be raised underneath the ministry of darl Wesco we all got faith but this is a gift of faith I'mma tell you how I know you got faith I'mma tell you you you I ain't got faith yes you do you got it you don't even know it you want to know how you got faith you actually came in here saw that chair and you sat down it take Faith to sit down in that chair and believe that that chair going to hold you none of y'all came in and you didn't do none of that your faith just said so everybody got that and if you can just apply that type of Faith to God you might go somewhere you ain't checking this out how you going to do this Lord how you going to do that you got to explain this to me you say that to the chair if you just apply that to God you might go somewhere but this gift of faith just seemed like no matter what come up in your life it's even hard to see brother West go sick because he just he never went to the hospital I mean it seemed like any time the devil showed up at his house that the devil was leaving with bandages amen you talking about a gift of faith and you know I mean he sh him and sister Wesco just Shar so many how did this happen I can't I I like when he when he when he said the Lord told him to go full-time in Ministry and he had a good job good benefits working for the police department and and he he went and told the boss said I going just take a sabatical cuz you know the man said no we not giving no sabatical no not this year he said oh Lord this man said no to sabatical I'm I'm going just have to quit when went in and say I'm giving my twoe resignation the man said what you what what you got a great job why would you do that he says the Lord called me to preach you leaving to go preach and he did this without talking to his wife now this is Faith how many of y'all brothers going to quit your' job and then go home and talk to your wife after you quit most of y'all brothers gonna be like no I ain't gonna do that I'mma talk to her first before we got to be on the same page before we cuz there's going to be some problems at the house he go home and sister Wesco he say he say sit down sister Wesco say uh yeah um I got something to tell you what is it say um I just quit my job I gave him two weeks notice she said okay now you sit down she say the Lord told me a word of knowledge a word of knowledge God told me that you was going to leave your job we going to be all right [Applause] that's faith and when you when you have people like that in your life that can encourage you when you're going through something you want to lean up against them to another Faith by The Same Spirit to another the gifts of healing by The Same Spirit can I tell y'all something these gifts is for the entire body I know a sister that was diagnosed with cancer and the Lord healed her of cancer and when she got healed of cancer she developed a um a desire to want to pray for other people that had cancer her Ministry was to go from room to room in the hospital and talk the people about their situation and then if they would want prayer she would pray for them her and her husband would pray for them but she would share her testimony with those people see God had to take her through that in order for her to have a uh uh uh in order for that desire to be awakened in her now God gave her a Ministry of healing yes a sister can have that brother brandom was at a meeting at the meeting Oh my he was giv to have a prayer line and there was a lady sitting on the front row and she saw a mother come in the mother baby just crying up something she saw the mother with a prayer C she said you know what I'll just give that mother my seat but there was something pressing I said no no no pray for that baby and she said no I see the mama got a prayer C I ain't going to pray for the baby brother Brandon GNA pray for the baby and brother brand said said like that got something to do with it he said the holy spirit said no you pray for that baby she's like no I'll just give her my seat so she got up ma'am I see you got a baby I don't have a baby you have this seat you you take my seat and uh she said oh thank you I really appreciate she went and stood and she just kept feeling that that that urge go pray for that baby go pray for that baby go pray for that baby she said ma'am I am so sorry to bother you I know you got a prayer card and I know the baby gonna be prayed for but just to get this thing off my heart could I just pray for your baby sure you can pray for the baby pray for the baby laid hands real quick went and sat in the balcony after she got to the balcony brother brandom comes out prayer line starts happening and uh and here comes his mother with the baby with the pr up brother man said oh your baby already healed my baby already healed said yeah your baby got healed early in the service oh he said what happened there was a lady that gave you a seat God showed him a vision she she gave you a seat she went up into the balcony to pray and had that lady not prayed for your baby God would have called her out to rebuke her that woman had a gift of healing now notice when she prayed for the baby did y'all catch it she prayed before the service started she didn't jump in the prayer line with the prophet I got a gift Hallelujah can I my auntie was in the hospital with a sister while she was having a baby the umbilical Court wrapped around that baby's neck at the time of birth and my auntie did not have time to call the pastor say but you got to get up here right now no no no no my auntie took things took matters in on and she prayed and the baby was delivered successfully no problem the gift of healing isn't it's in you it just need to be activated sometime all right I'm I'm going on I'm going on I'm going on these are fruit that I'm looking for right in spirit and Truth Tabernacle all nine spiritual gifts the tree was planted and it need to bear fruit you know even in the in the in the um in the Book of Revelation there would be fruit trees along the River of Life and they're going to bear fruit every month I'mma say that again fruit trees will be planted along the River of Life and they're going to bear fruit every month so why can't we see these gifts being manifested every month all right I'm going on did I uh n n another Gifts of healing by The Same Spirit verse 10 to another the working of Miracles to another prophecy to another Discerning of spirits to another diverse kinds of tongues to another and and and and that diverse kinds of tongues I was looking at a a definition in my uner Bible dictionary it says uncontrollable utterance that's what Tong is it's an uncontrollable utterance I told y'all how uh brother brother brother Smiley was we were just sitting there praying over over my bed we we just went me brother Smiley brother Troy brother quu we went to pray over her and and brother Smiley just sitting there he did not go there with that in his mind that he just gonna start speaking in tongues but it was an uncontrollable utterance it was just coming up like a whale just coming up out of him just coming up just coming up just before you know it he just took off in tongues I said my God I I don't know about you but I would love for God to strike me with an uncontrollable utterance I'm moving on diverse kinds of tongues to another their interpretation of tongues but all these worketh that one and the self- Same Spirit divide into every man sever as will now what happened with the church at Pentecost not not the church at Pentecost but the Pentecostal organization I talked about them last week they took that seventh I mean the eighth gift the gift of tongues and they made a Doctrine out of it and say let you ain't got the Holy Ghost unless you speak with tongues but there's nine gifts on the tree nine not just one there's nine we want all nine Pentecost made took one and just stopped right there and and then then they they forgot about the interpretation of Tong we want all that if God give a tongue we now we know you speaking in tongues but we need to know what God is saying to us so we need the interpretation of that and then the Bible tell you say now if you speak in tonu pray that you interpret we got it we back in the scripture y'all we back in the scripture and with us being back in the scripture now we know what to look for we know how this is how this is supposed to operate in the church this tree was planted at Pentecost this is what it produce and if Jesus Christ not if I'm going just tell you like this he is the same yesterday it in forever let's see all that he had manifested back then let's see it manifested now I got so much more but I'm stopping there God bless you [Applause] Church let's have a word of prayer uh brother quu I'm going to have you
