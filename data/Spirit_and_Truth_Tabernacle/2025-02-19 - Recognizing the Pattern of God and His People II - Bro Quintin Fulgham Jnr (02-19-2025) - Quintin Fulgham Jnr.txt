just coming to church on a Wednesday or a Sunday as as something to do oh Lord Jesus Christ Lord your Prophet said when Adam and Eve were in the garden oh Lord and the cool of the evening would come oh Lord God it said Lord your spirit just came came down oh Lord Jesus it flowed through the trees it flowed through the animals oh Lord God it flowed to Adam and Eve oh Lord God they knew it was time to talk with you oh Lord God they knew it was time to commune with you oh Lord God they wanted to hear your voice oh Lord God lord it was such a joy oh Lord God I could see the maybe the Goosebumps and chills come over them when you begun to step down into the garden oh Lord and talk with your children oh Lord God Lord this isn't just another event oh Lord Jesus Christ Lord you're trying to restore your church back to you oh Lord God Lord you're trying to restore us back to the time oh Lord God where it wasn't any preaching oh Lord God it wasn't any it wasn't necessarily any praying or fasting oh Lord God lord we could walk right up to your presence oh Lord Jesus Christ no fear oh Lord God no sin oh Lord Jesus Christ nothing to hide oh Lord Jesus Christ we could walk right up to your presence and enjoy you fully oh Lord God Lord we thank you for this opportunity that you've given us oh Lord God lord right now you see your people oh lord they're in need oh Lord God lord they need a healing touch from you Lord they need a word from you they need something oh Lord God you know their hearts oh Lord Jesus Christ I'm just a man oh Lord God but I prayed oh Lord that you will use these lips oh Lord God to speak a word of Hope to them oh Lord God speak a word of faith oh Lord God give them something that they can cling onto oh Lord God for we know oh Lord God this word is more than life oh Lord God lord you said in your word man shall not live by bread alone oh Lord God but by every word oh Lord Jesus Christ is more to us than just physical food oh Lord God lord it's something we really can hold on to and cling on to and digest oh Lord and let it become a part of who we are oh Lord Jesus Christ so Lord I ask that you speak the words of healing oh Lord speak the words of blessing and overflow over your people oh Lord God so they'll know Lord God that you the the the love you have for us oh Lord God oh God the love you the the love and the uh the joy that you have to see us gathered here once again just as it was in the beginning oh Lord God be with us in this message oh Lord God and in this service oh Lord God and the precious name of Jesus Christ amen amen so we're going to get started right into this um right into the service um so this will be uh the title that the Lord had given me last time uh recognizing the pattern of God and his people this is part two with the subtitle of overflow after the stand right so now we're going to read Joel uh chapter 2 uh veres 23- 26 before you're seated so we'll wait for her to pull it up to get started in this journey thank you Jesus and it reads here it says be glad then ye children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he hath given you the former Reign moderately and he he will cause to come down on you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floor shall be full of Wheat and the vat shall overflow with wine and oil and I will restore to you the years that the Locust have eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the Palmer wor my great Army which I sent among you and ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that have dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed may the Lord add a blessing to his word as you uh take your seats so we're now in this we're now in this transition where in the first part of the message we wanted to make sure that we were Christians first that we were identified to be what a Christian was so we can confirm that it's who it's who we are in this life right um so when when you become a Christian which means that you've been changed back you've been changed back into the image of God now God can have trust in you right God can only trust his word God doesn't trust your feelings that God doesn't trust what you say but when he can see his word reflecting inside of you now God can trust you with some stuff right and in order for God to bless you on this side of Earth he has to test you he can't just hand it to you right and so when you become a Christian right it gives the new birth actually helps you to stand a test so that's why God you know you don't worry don't worry about overflow and if you this is if you're not a if you haven't received a baptism Holy Spirit uh on the line or wherever you are don't worry about blessings first that's where people get things wrong they want a blessings they want an increase they want more money they want a better job they want their health restore don't even worry about those things first make sure you're a Christian on the inside because God can only give you things as you pass a test right so before we begin this journey we want to kind of flesh out what we talked about last time I started a little bit of it and we're going to kind of get into it some more to kind of see um uh the depthness of it and it's the difference between a blessing and an increase because this is the area where a lot of people tend to get things wrong and make a lot of um decisions that can be very detrimental right so we want to see why we want the word first which is why I love how brother Jack has been preaching uh this overflow is not just a physical overflow but a spiritual overflow first so we're going to turn to Luke chapter 17 uh we're going to read uh verses uh 11-9 and it says and it came to pass as he went to Jerusalem that he passed through the midst of Sam uh Samaria and Galilee and as he entered into a certain Village there met he 10 men that were lepers which stood afar and they lifted up their voices and said Jesus Master have mercy on us so all of these 10 lepers right all these 10 lepers right here they had faith and they recognized that Jesus was a master this was out of their own mouths verse 14 says and when we and when he saw them he said unto them go show yourselves unto the priests and it came to pass that as they went they were cleansed and one of them when he heard when he saw that he was healed turned back and with a loud voice glorify God and fell down on his fell down on his face at his feet giving him thanks and he was a Samaritan and Jesus answered and said where there are not 10 cleans cleansed but where are the nine there are not found that return to give glory to God Save The Stranger and he said unto him arise go thy way thy faith has made thee whole so we're going to turn to the message who is this preached in 59 uh paragraph 78 and we're going to kind of see exactly what the prophet's thoughts were about this group of people the prophet says and he and as he come writing in lots of the people say he's a Healer oh we seen him Open the Eyes of the blind we seen him make the crippled man to walk we seen him offer prayer and a fever left the child but then those type and I want you to realize he said type so he's he's classifying this group into a type of people he said those type were only following him for the Loaves and the fishes and that's the way the Crowds Are today many if there's a Healer while they they follow him and he's just he's just in Oasis if they get sick they run say oh will you please pray for me that the Lord Jesus will make me well and as soon as they come out of the hospital or the sick bed right back into the world they go like a dog to its vomit or a hog to its wallow as the scripture said just follow him for what they can get out of him they use them just for a totem pole or something that that they can get from him and don't expect to serve him that crowd still goes on today so those Spirits are still here today and we want to make sure that we're not identified with this group right which means we have to we have to make choices that are different from what they've done we have to we have to we have to think about blessing in a different light than what these guys thought about it verse 80 says there were nine lepers healed and one returned to give him praise or was it 10 they one of them one of them returned to give him praise and the rest of them went ahead ungrateful now the Bible says they were healed though yes sir and the prophet here says that they walked around and he called him ungrateful wow so they had a healing they had a blessing but it was something negative to it the prophet couldn't fully uh fully accept this thing so that's why I say we have to realize there is a difference between blessing and increase right there is a difference between a blessing and increase and so now they all received it increase right and that was an increase of Health right but only one of them that I can see in my eyes that's why I kind of stand behind what the prophet says I can only see one of them really got a blessing right and there was that one Le leopard that came back to consider the word the source of where he received this blessing right and uh the Bible says that um he was made whole and I like that word wholeness because whenever the word says hold that means god is completely satisfied with this situation so if you don't if if you don't if you don't receive a wholeness with your increase that means that there's something wrong right there's a question in God's mind and you have to ask you have to you try you have to try to identify what is wrong with this situation this situation right and so blessing is actually the easy part A lot of people don't realize that blessings are actually the easy part and you know I believe I'm looking at some millionaires right now in this church right now amen amen come on brother I believe I'm looking at some CEOs that are that have successful businesses to God right there is nothing too hard for God Amen God wants to bless you more than you want to be blessed amen you ever had like you ever notice a kid um like you know a kid will want to go and be successful but their parents when when a when when you have a good father and a good mother and your kid wants to be your kid wants to go do something your parents will go overboard just to see you successful right and when they see you competing in the sports they'll be the loudest ones in the stand when you graduate your family they're the loudest one your family would do they want to do so much more extra than what you really want and that's just how God is with his children God wants to see you more successful than you want to be successful right so blessings that's that's that's the easy part and and the thing about it is we've already been shown by the gifts in this church that God is with us God has already stated he with us not some other church and their gifts not what God has done in the past not what God has done at Brenham Tabernacle or some other great church but what God is doing in this very Church which means it's got to be personal to you hallelujah amen yes sir so we want to continue on this journey now because we want to make sure that we don't end up like this group of people that were the prophet said was ungrateful so we're going to turn to Luke chap 16 and we're going to read verses um 19- 21 just to uh identify these types because it's always good the um the one of the themes of the message is patterns and you want to make sure that you're following a good pattern so that means you got to be able to identify the bad patterns of what not to follow so Luke 16:19 says there was a certain rich man which was clothed in purple and fine linen and fared sumptuously every day and there was a certain beggar named Lazarus which was laid at his gate full of sores and 21 verse 21 says and Desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table moreover the dogs came and licked his sores right so we the prophet told us that this rich young fellow right here was a very religious guy we we uh the prophet typed him in the Bible to the guy that came up to Christ and Christ told him to sell all his riches and he was just that was just too hard for him to do when he rejected the word but he was very religious Christ identified that he lived a certain life according to the word right when he said have done all of these things and of course uh Jesus Christ being a prophet could perceive that he was telling the truth right but religion just won't do it you need something more than religion all right now I can say that he got increase after this the Bible said his barns exploded that's exactly right right I mean he was successful I mean his bank account was never never never zero but I can't call it a blessing there something I can't identify now the next thing to kind of look into this Bible verse is we have Lazarus out here now Lazarus was a real genuine Christian amen everybody knows Lazarus was a real genuine Christian and we can tell that because of his end right so that meant that Lazarus was a representation of the word Jesus said that if you stand for me on this Earth on that day I'll stand for you so here was Lazarus a representation of a word of what a Christian uh was to be and so we can say that the word was hidden behind these swords and begging in Lazarus on the outside of the rich man you ruler's house right so the when the Bible says he was a beggar it says that he needed help help so the word needs help right God needs help sometimes and notice uh when the rich rich when the Lazarus was asking for something to eat you know he wasn't asking for you know a plate Fresh Off The Grill or the stove he wasn't asking for no crab cakes or king crab legs or nothing like that he wasn't asking for caviar or none of the finest thing the Bible just said he just wanted a crumb all he wanted was just a chome and I want to and it's important for us to realize that that God never ask us for much God never ask you for much right you know so it's funny to find that you know sometimes people have it's it's it becomes a problem when people pay their ties or when people play their offering and it's like God only ask for 10% of what you got not half not 70% not 90% he only wants the crumbs of what you got wow and so and so it's hard so it's hard for God to say you want a million and you're getting $2,000 a month and you struggle paying ties and offering on that and God's only asking for a little piece of it and you want him to give you more Lord see this is why God has to test us before he gives us these things because he wants to be able to trust us right some people find it hard to come to church on Sunday you know the churches be packed on Easter Sunday or any kind of conventions or if we have like you know we have the night of worship which is which is really really good and everyone wants to come out on the big events but when it's a Sunday service on a regular Sunday or a Wednesday service ain't no one to be found all right and when you think about it services on Sunday last about two hours and brother Jack make sure that everyone gets a time limit right so it's not much Wednesday service is about 2 hours so that's about 4 hours out of your week God just wants the crumbs of your time God just wants the Crums of your time right and that's a problem for some people though right so this Bible in the Bible it says that Lazarus was at the Gate of the Rich Young Ruler he wasn't somewhere that was far away right meaning the word was still close to this Rich Young Ruler right and he had the opportunity to help it the Rich Young Ruler probably passed the gate a million times and saw Lazarus out there and not once acknowledged Lazarus it was only when he was it was too late that he wanted to reach out for Lazarus that's the only time he acknowledged him but then it was too late so even with this increase of wealth that he had and he told Jesus oh you know I obeyed my parents I do this I did that even with all the religion that he had not one time could he help out this fellow believer which was a real Christian in his time of need couldn't even get him a crumb right though he was religious and have plenty to help with so you can't say that oh I'm going to you know if God gives me a million dollars I'm just going to help out the church if with $2,000 you're struggling with that God knows it's a lie right God can't God can't God can't bless some God can't bless somebody with an attitude like that now we want to contrast because we're looking at patterns we want to contrast to another rich young fellow in the Bible and we're actually going to turn to dedication the message dedication preached in 62 and this is uh paragraph um 30 yep so the prophet says here now David under desire and Revelation thought in his heart a very Gallant thing when David being a fair man and well loved with the people and God had blessed him in so many ways and he said now is it right that I set here in a nice home that the Lord has given me and the Ark of the Covenant of God out there under curtains now the Arc of the Covenant represents the word so this is go this is this is David's attitude towards the word right that was a very Gallant thing it was a revelation for David to know this because it wasn't it wasn't just right for him to have such a lovely place under the house of made of cedar which is a very expensive place and said then the Ark of the Covenant my God who gave me all these things still out there under tents so even in this overflow that God cuz God took David from a mighty long way he was out there uh shepher and sheep which was a job that was looked down upon and didn't even have the respect of his own father and the confidence of his own father so this God had then exalted David up into the palace and the prophet says here that he was living in Cedar that's what the Bible he's he's referencing the Bible verse of what David David said so it was an expensive place I mean he had the best horses he had had the best clothes his wives had the best clothes they had silk linen anything that they could ask for but in David's heart when he went out there and he saw the word of the Lord under a tent there was a problem with him see that's who God's looking for God's looking for somebody that if no matter how much He blesses you no matter how much he increases you and exalts you what you're always considering the word right there's something inside your heart that's always considering well what about the word I can't be all the way up here word all the way down there David said no we got to bring the word up too that's when you know you have a blessing right that's when you know when you have a blessing when you considering uh the Lord first and so what we could say is that if we were to switch the positions of these young rich people and last and the Rich Young Ruler would have been in David's spot you know the kingdom would have been in shambles he wouldn't have done nothing for the kingdom he would have done nothing for the people he would have walked past the ark and not even bad at the eye because he did the the same thing with Lazarus now if David would have been put into his position I could we if we could dramatize I could see David one day coming outside uh going to his room and open up his blinds and looking outside and seeing Lazarus out there and going to a service saying hey who's this man oh his name is Lazarus he's a Believer he's really going through some hard time and David is like no not not not not in my house bring him in here clean up his Source give him some food give him one of my robes I can't have no believer out there just struggling while we up in here uh uh eating good right so that's that's the uh that's the kind of uh that's the kind of spirit God can bless the prophet said that when you actually go down God exalts you more God can give you more when you go down going down means to consider the word right and so what we want to look at next right because we want to be identified with the right group so uh the amazing thing as we said before the amazing thing about blessings from God is that um God already has them prepared it's not something you have to work for it's not something you necessarily have to do a lot of planning for God has it already uh prepared for you so in the beginning as I love to go back to uh Genesis 1 uh when God um and I'm just going to paraphrase when God created uh uh the Earth you know before he brought Adam onto the scene he created the sun he created the moon he created the stars and the the sky and the water and the animals and the fish and the uh the fruit and everything this Garden was just a big blessing and it was already prepared before Adam came onto the scene right so when God created Adam in Genesis 1 uh when the Bible says it created him it was a spiritual man right it was a man and a female was made out the image of God and God is a God is a spirit right and then God had to then provide him a body in order for him to enjoy the blessings so the next thing he did was he came and he created a body Out of the Dust and he put a spirit inside of there and God and the thing I love about God is when God has your blessings lined up for you he makes sure everything is in line he makes sure everything is is laid out he doesn't cut Corners he doesn't you don't got to go into your blessing wondering well what about this or what about that God takes care of every single step he's concerned about his kids yes sir right so this is where you know God um prep and we're going to read later on in the uh in in the Bible in in in a second how God prepared the garden for Adam and his wife first before he put him in now this is the part where people get things tricked up and this is why we need a prophet of the day to tell us what time we're in and where we're at because God just those blessings that God had for Adam he just gave it to him Adam didn't have to prove anything in order to get his Blessing God Adam didn't have to go through any tests because like we said before he was already perfect he was already in a perfect stage but we know now according to the prophet and the prophet always brings this up we know now that we are imperfect beings as far as the flesh so we have to fight for every blessing God's not just going to drop it into your hands but a lot of times we get that mindset where we want to be like Adam and we just want God just to drop it in our lap you know we want some healing we want God just to he right then there you know we want to be a millionaires we want God just to drop the money right then the there we want we want God to help us with this and that we want God to do it just right quick just like he did with Adam but we are not living during that time right now we're in a time where we have to fight for every single blessing right praise God so going to Genesis 2 uh and we're going to be we're going to read just a little bit some of of these verses from 7 to 15 go on to Genesis 2 we want to kind of see how God had all of this uh laid out um for Adam in verse 7 it says and the Lord God formed Man Out of the Dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and a Man became a living Soul so now he's in a body and the Lord God planted a garden East Eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he formed and out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is Pleasant to the sight and good for food and the life of of uh the tree of of life also in the midst of garden and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil verse 10 says and a river went out of Eden to water the garden so here is God now he created the uh he created the world and now he's preparing the garden now he's preparing he's making sure everything is in order just before Adam comes to take this thing over and this is and and that's why I say we're identifying patterns so whatever need that you have God is already arranging stuff God is already opening doors God already has every single resource in place and what that does it actually gives us Faith while we're going through a trial that we don't got to worry about anything because God has it already uh uh uh already available for us right it says verse 10 says and a river went out to Eden to water the garden and from then it was parted and became into foreheads verse 11 says the name of the first is Pyon that is which compasses the whole land of havala where there is gold and the gold of that land is good there is bellium and the Onyx I mean God had all the resources for Adam ad I mean it's Adam didn't have to Adam didn't have to pay property tax he didn't have to take out he didn't have to take out a mortgage right he didn't have to ask God well you know my credit score is looking a little bit low I don't know if I can live up north uh in in the north side of the garden right there were no ho8 Fe right he didn't have to pray for the land and fast for the land they didn't have to fight over the gold God just provided it for them God had it all laid out before them uh for them to enjoy it right and God provided a a physical body uh and with attributes for him to be able to enjoy those blessings right so your overflow even though we have to fight in this time and this time and age uh if you remember the children of Israel God had the land for them right the land was already set and Not only was the land already set but the way to the land was set as well all they had to do was just follow the light amen it and when they got to the land they saw so many enemies inside of there but Joshua because he stayed behind the light of the age knew we got to fight for this right everyone that didn't stand behind Moses didn't catch the light and they thought God was just going to give it to him so God just left them behind so it's important to follow your life for your age because it'll give you the spirit you need in order uh to overcome that right and so your your your your overflow is already there you might have some amorites and all of these unbelievers on your land but that doesn't make a difference to the believer it doesn't make a difference to the believer who's on your land right God said it's mine I'm going to get it amen right so you know you say you know you might you might need some healing in your body and you say your body is just so broken down down right some people are some people deal with chronic pain uh which can be very very devastating to the mental and it the mental faculties and all that kind of stuff but when God gives a word of healing God has to provide a way for that right so you may say that the doctors well the doctor said that you know this is incurable there's currently no cure for this thing but a Believer looks at the word right it's not the job of a doctor to prepare the way it's the job of God to prepare the way for your healing right um and healing was a blessing that was in the garden uh that Adam and Eve enjoyed they they enjoyed this blessing as long as they stayed on on the word and so I'm thankful that the uh that God you know so mindful of us in our time that when he sent the prophet he gave the prophet some hard cases of healing right there were people that were missing limbs they were people that had limbs shorter than other ones and they came before The Prophet I'm so thankful that brother Brandon was able to identify the word right to Showcase God's absolute power right because no matter the circumstance when God said you were healed and you needed a limb God had to provide you with a new limb I ain't never seen any denomination preach anything like that or I a't seen no Miracles like that where people that were missing arms or missing legs and God snaap the leg right back on the person because they stood with the word right so God has your he God has your blessing for you no matter how hard it may look God already has everything provided for you right so we want to kind of go into the next part of this uh of this message where you know before you receive the blessing as we said we're in a different time age there's got to be a stand you have to make a stand because we are because we're headed back to Perfection God has to make sure that we are solid in our experience God doesn't want us to end up like the Rich Young Ruler where we have blessings but then at the end of the day you know we lose our soul right and that's why God loves to send test because it ensures that not only do we get an increase but we get an increase going in the right direction which is up right and so one of the uh people that I could uh that I think of in the Bible as far as uh as far as the increase or someone that took a stand for that blessing you have to talk about Abraham you got to talk about Abraham right he was he is the uh he is God's template for what a Christian is supposed to be today taking God at his word right so now God had came to Abraham after he called him out and God had confirmed to him in the spiritual that he would have a son right and Abraham the first time God came to Abraham and he said he would have the son Abraham said amen the Bible says it was counted to him righteousness next time he came around the Bible says Abraham laugh right um and he was trying to say well make ishmail the one God said no I said through you and Sarah I'm going to raise up Isaac and that's going to be the one and I love that I love that you know God allows these people to go through human things right because a lot of times you think about Abraham and he just stood and it is the truth he did stood but sometimes when God says things it can seem impossible right it can seem like it just can't happen like can you imagine if you're missing an arm and God says well you're going to get a new arm you're like well how's that going to happen like you know and they were living during a time where a technological advancement they didn't have the means for all of those kind of things so it can it can it can it can seem hard to believe uh but the but the beautiful thing about Abraham is that he still believed even against all of that and so now God came down in the flesh we know the story how God came into a body and came into come to fellowship with Abraham and Abraham believed what God had said so we're going to turn to gen uh uh Genesis 18 to kind of see how this played out verse uh 16 to kind of see how this uh thing played out and it says here and the men and the men rose up from then he's talking about God and the angels the group that was with them and looked toward Sodom and Abraham went with him to bring them on the way and the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do seeing that Abraham sh shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the Earth shall be blessed in him for I know him that he will commit command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the the Lord to do justice and judgment that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken and I love this thing because when you're going through a trial when God has made you a promise and you're going through a hard time and you're praising the lord it's not easy and sometimes it can feel like you know you're alone in this thing but I love how this encouragement where God had come into flesh right and he had come to Abraham and now he's confirming the word to Abraham not just through spiritual but just through flesh now right to show to help uh uh Abraham and and and the way that he's speaking these things is he's talking as if it's already happened and I want to let you know that when you're going through your trial God will find a way to get a word to you when you're going through if he's got to find some kind of Flesh on the earth to inspire somebody to say something when you're going through a great trial and God will give a word to you in order for you to be encouraged so that you can stand on the word as well amen and so you know um and so God was confirming this word to him and the other thing that I like about this thing is um before but the verses before that God had instituted the um um the circumcision to uh Abraham and the circumcision was a sign of the baptism holy spirit because Abraham also got a new name as well right so Abraham was a different man now and so I like how when God um and this is the reason why when you receive the baptism in the Holy Spirit God wants to do more more for you than you wanted than what you want from him and so when the Lord was standing there next to Abraham and he looked at Abraham and he had a new name and he had a body change you know when he said these word he said um he said the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham the thing which I do meaning that God can't keep nothing from you when you receive the baptism the Holy Spirit God can't keep nothing from you whether that's a spiritual blessing whether that's Revelation whether that's overflowing blessings God himself can't keep it from you right and so I like how it's a it's a spiritual overflow for Abraham here as God tells Abraham is plans right because he hasn't talked to anyone else and he's talking to Abraham because Abraham had a new status you know he could because he received the word he could receive the fullness of the word as God was laying out right and this gave and this what what it what this did because the the the key thing that we want to remember is that when you have a blessing as I said before you're always looking what for what you can do for other people the prophet said salvation is doing what is living for others that's what salvation is is when you live for others so when God told Abraham this great thing and he's having spiritual Revelation because he knows he's safe in his heart he's thinking about a lot in his heart he was thinking about a lot in his family when he heard these things right and I like how it says here in verse we're going to turn we're going to go down to uh uh verse 22 just one simple verse to kind of feed upon upon this for a little bit and in verse 22 it says and the men turned their faces from then and went toward Sodom so God was going to go down to handle deal with Sodom and it doesn't say anything about him thinking about lot so what I want to say is make sure you get the baptism the Holy Spirit don't depend on other people to be there to help you to save you and pray for you you make sure you get the baptism of the Holy Spirit yourself don't depend on your mom's experience or your dad's experience or anybody else that you know that is in Christ make sure you have a word for yourself right and so it says it went toward Sodom but Abraham stood yet before the Lord and I love that because it's a sign of intercession so now Abraham is in a position because he realizes who he is that he can talk with God and then we see how he kind of goes through and says Lord if there's any righteous in the city would you spare him God knows in his heart that he's talking about a lot and when you talk about uh when you talk about an overflow right for you to be able to hear from God that no I won't go down there and destroy the city for for 50 righteous or 30 righteous or 10 righteous so you can just see the Overflow that Abraham is getting because he's getting a son he's getting his Grand he's getting his nephew back yes he's restored back to the word he can talk face to face with God just like Adam did in the beginning this man is just old this man just has such an overflow going on in his life but we have to remember though that Abraham still had to stand right so when God gave him the word the Bible says Abraham waited 25 years for his promise God said he was going to receive God said he was going to receive the and Abraham really wanted a son him and his wife really wanted a away wanted a child and they had to wait 25 years and I say in this microwave age that we live in today a lot of us probably would have given up right a lot of us probably would have just forgot about it on year five or year 11 and just you know but the Bible says Abraham staggered not at the promise of God so we're going to read Jehovah Gyra and uh preached in 57 and we're going to uh read paragraphs 24 through 2 to see what the prophet said about this says now we find then a little later on as he began to move on and there come a separation time that he had to separate himself from his Kindred his father died as long as the old man was along he never did bless him but after all was separated God appeared to him lotad took his choice went down to Sodom as long as as long as lot hung along his argument and as long as you stick around with the unbelievers you'll find the same trouble and what God is saying is you have to separate yourself right you don't have to mingle with your loved ones that are not saved in order to redeem them you don't have to mingle with them you don't have to walk with them you don't have to uh do the things that they do you don't have to have the same conversations that that they have in order to save them right Abraham said hold on you going on a lot you you going down to Sodom and gomorra you can go on right there I'm going stay right here but he could still reach lot amen because he's stood on the word God right Hallelujah and if you have a wayward son or daughter or whoever I'm telling you now if you've had the baptism the Holy Spirit you can go Before the Throne of God and say Lord what about me God is a god of pattern which means if he did it for Abraham and he says no for to you it would mean that he wouldn't be God that's right so it means that he has to say yes in order to be the same amen amen as we continue reading but when Abraham was 90 99 years old 99 that made Sarah 88 could you can you imagine Abraham could you imagine when Abraham went and told Sarah's wife saying sweetheart you know we've always longed to have children oh yes Abraham well bless God we're going to have a baby watch Sarah say Abraham I don't understand neither do I well how do you know we're going to have a baby God said so that settles it God said so he's going to do it ver in paragraph 25 says well after the first few days maybe the first month while he come to Sarah and he said Sarah how you feeling honey he said not a bit of difference Abraham are you sure he said glory to God we're going to have it anyhow sure he says how do you know Abraham God said so the second month passed Sarah how you feel anything happening not a bit of difference glory to God we're going to have it anyhow how do you know God said so the first year past a lot of people would have given up not Abraham the first year past Sarah you still are you still are going to have those diapers and things ready yes have you felt any different not a bit but hallelujah we're going to have it anyhow God said so keep my thoughts on them they'll be all right see all right when 25 years pass 25 years pass Sarah how do you feel no different glory to God we're going to have it anyhow there you are he didn't look at circumstances he looked at what God said he was looking at the word praise God Amen and so I kind of want to just get into this thing just to kind of flesh out these details because can you imagine Abraham and Sarah they're very old very very old people uh and God could have gave them a kid when they were fertile but he waited until the time where they were at a point where there looked like there was no hope and it's like why would you wait that long but you see we're in a testing time we're in a testing period and God's got to test our faith right and it's amazing how God told Abraham at this age where his whole physical nature was against him you know his his his feelings his sight his touch uh his reasoning and thinking everything was against him right so when you saw a when you saw the prophet saying Abraham was saying amen we're going to have it anyway that was the spirit man not the flesh man because the flesh man wants to give up and I I remember a time where uh I would uh when I was living with my grandpa you know I would try to teach him some new things and you know how when you're older you want to hear any of that kind of stuff you're just you're too you're too tired that time and I remember my my my grandpa used to say you can't teach a old dog new tricks all right so Abraham was at a stage where it was hard for him to even just think about things like that his whole nature whole body was was was against him and now let's look at Abraham's wife because that's just half of the equation right so in verse 11 uh going back to Genesis uh yeah verse 11 I'm going back to Genesis 18 it says now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken and aged and over here it says and it cease to be with Sarah after the manner of women and we got to kind of flesh out what that means after the the uh the manner of women so and and all you sisters correct me you know if if if I'm wrong because I've I've I've done my research and I don't want to be wrong so so I did my research and I found online that there are four stages that are associated with a woman as far as conceiving one is puberty and that's when she starts the menstruation age that's when she's able to uh start producing eggs which now a seed can go into egg and produce life and then she has a reproductive stage where she's able to have a have a have a child and then there's a stage called the per minipa stage which is the Prem minipa stage and then you have the Mena stage which is the sign after that is done it's a sign that a woman can no longer produce a child well she's no longer fertile anymore to produce a child right so this was the stage that Abraham's wife was in her own body was confessing to her you can't have a child so you could see how it was hard for Sarah to believe something because when you are fertile there are certain things that happen in a woman's life where you can feel that you know you are fertile and Sarah couldn't feel not one of these things wow Sarah couldn't feel any of it right so there's no evidence that life could come to her but they still still don't know word the and the the prophet says that um the prophet said that God had to provide them with a new body in order for the baby to come so as they're going through their life as they're going through life and believing on the word all of a sudden Abra wakes up one morning and you know how some older people you know they look got look real close and stuff Abraham was looking close to the paper like hold on a second I don't even need to squint to see this all right and looked over at Sarah and said whoa woke up and Sarah woke up and looked at Abraham and said oh my goodness Abraham that's something different going on here amen the Bible says that when they went before Abraham took his wife before King the the the Bible says and the the prophet tells us that the king desired to have her as a wife and he ain't going to have no old woman as a wife no Sarah was a young beautiful sister right so God had to change their bodies back in order for them to uh uh conceive Isaac and of course we know that after this time had come that Isaac finally was born right and they could enjoy their blessing right and you you would think that it would stop there you think that it would stop there all is over the story is over but no God wanted to give Abraham a overflow come on God wanted to give Abraham a overflow not just not just what he was dealing with now so Abraham had his promise right he had Isaac in his hands he woke up every morning and he heard Isaac and it just brought so much joy after he waited 25 years and he waited so long and now the house was filled with a child's laughter and he went to the breakfast table and Isaac came running into the room and sat down jumping on his lap and Isaac had his son Isaac had his promise Isaac had his pride and his Joy right but there's just something about God he just loves to test every single bit of you right he just loves to test and and it's to let and and that's why I want to let you guys know you got to put it in your soul standing is a big part of the Christian experience you can't just enjoy life it's good to enjoy blessings but you got to learn to stand at all times so we're going to turn to Genesis 22 uh and verses we're going to read verses one and two and it says and it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham and said unto him Abraham and he said behold here I am and he said take now thy son thy only son Isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of Moore and offer him there to for a burnt offering unto one of the mountains which I will tell of thee so now you can imagine how Abraham is at this point where he had just got his son and maybe and and the Bible says that that he could Isaac could talk at this time so he was probably you know nine or something he was at an age where he could communic and understand what his daddy understood what a sacrifice was and so he had been with Isaac for a long a lot of birthdays and so for him to hear these words that God said take your son I know that you love him and offer it to him right God now Abraham has at a time where it's a testing time and that it's a standing time for him to uh to stand on the word of the Lord right and so we're going to read verses 11 and God has to set the scene God has Abraham has took his son up there he's prepared him onto the altar to sacrifice his son and he's going and he's choosing to believe the word of God and Trust in the word of God and we'll we'll we'll later find out why but it says here as he's about to it says we we'll start in verse 10 so verse 10 says and Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son because he believed God he believed God Abraham believed God and you want sometimes you wonder why God makes you go through trials that are so hard or so long and you're sitting here well why I got to wait 25 years for a son there's always a harder trial after what you've gone through God's not just looking for what you're getting right now but God's looking for every single step of the way that you're going through and God has to prepare you to take a stand there so when Abraham was all them years of praising the Lord and thanking to God for them 25 years when it came to sacrifice his son there was no hesitation he had complete total control and belief in God because God had trained him to be that way right verse 11 says and the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven and said Abraham Abraham and he said here I am verse 12 says and he said lay not thy hand upon the lad neither do thou anything unto him for now I know that thou fearest God seeing that thou Hast not withheld thy son thy only son from me and we're going to skip down to uh verse 15 and because Abraham had done this thing he had gone through this trial he had gone through this test and passed the test let's see what the uh what the Lord says to Abraham and and the angel of the Lord called into Abraham Out of Heaven the second time verse 16 and said by myself have I sworn save the Lord for because thou Hast done this thing and H has not withheld thy son thy only son that in blessing I Will Bless thee and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the shore and thy seed shall possess the gates of his enemy talk about overflow is not only did God allow Abraham to keep his son but he was looking at a spiritual seat to Abraham he was looking at a spiritual Sons and Daughters of Abraham and I believe I'm looking at the I'm looking at the spiritual Abraham seeds right now talk about a overflow of sons and daughters for Abraham Through The Years you can read through the Bible and you can read David you can read Jesus you can read Moses and all of the Saints and those are all tied back to Abraham because he stood on the word amen right so it's and and that's what I'm saying Saints we're in a good spot how could we not believe in the Overflow of ourselves when we are the manifestation of one we are the walking manifestation of an overflow so how can we not believe in an overflow for ourselves how can God not give us a overflow when we are the definition of it by spiritual birth amen amen praise God and so we want to we want to finish off with um the last person because you because whenever you talk about overflow and blessing and over and overcoming standing you can't you you always got to you always have to talk about Jesus you always got to have talk about Jesus Christ right he is the one worthy of all the praise now how many knows that God himself was given an overflow wow how many knows that God himself knew that he was going to get a overflow right Jesus knew that he was going to rule and I can imagine as a uh Christ as a kid because when Christ was young he read the word right he had to read the word in order because when he was tempted he fought the enemy with the word so as a kid he read the word and if we could kind of dramatize what Christ read and the impact it had on his life right cuz it's one thing to read the word and to be able to identify yourself in it it's a good feeling right so if we turn to Psalms 2 Psalms 2 6-9 it says here uh yeah 6 to9 so yet have I set my king upon my Holy Hill of Zion I will declare the decree the Lord ha said unto me thou art my son this day have I begotten thee ask of me and I shall give Thee the Heathen for thine inheritance in the uttermost parts of the earth of thy possession Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron Thou shalt Dash them in pieces like a Potter's vessel and let's turn to uh Isaiah 6 uh 6 through 7 I can read through it so that you don't have to turn through um it says then flew um hold on Isaiah wait no not Isaiah 6 hold on uh let's turn to actual Daniel Daniel 7-13 uh verse 13 13- 14 there we go and it says I saw in the night visions and behold one like the son of man came with the clouds of heaven and came to the Ancients of days and they brought him near before him and there was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom that all all people Nations and languages should serve him his Dominion is an everlasting Dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed and if we could kind of draw Iz this young Jesus Christ when he read those verses it popped in his head that's me wow that's the the this scripture is talking about me and he could identify that hey I'm going to come to some power right I'm going to be you know I'm going to be Lord of All I'm going to have dominion of all my name is a I'mma have a kingdom that can't never uh uh be p uh be taken away but like with all children even with Christ God had to test them God's got to test them you ain't no different don't think that God's going to allow you to take a blessing or overflow without going through a stand if God didn't spare his own son trust me he's not going to have a different opinion about you that's all right brother right so Jesus Christ knew he was going to come into total power right and you're going to have to take a stand in order to get your overflow uh uh of your of uh of your blessing and the Bible said that the Bible says that Jesus Christ learned obedience through the things he suffered that's right so that was the first one God saw Jesus he obeyed his parents his parents said do this he went and did it his mom said do this he went and did this the elders said hey you do this he did this he was completely obedient and God was up in heaven like okay this guy he's looking like he's he's he's he's ready to rule right he's it's just the baby steps right it showed that he was fit to rule by his life it showed he was fit to uh he was fit to rule right and so how can you it's and and this is you know for the young ones uh you know how can you want a household how can you say you want a household right and you a young man and you want to be the head of your household and you can't listen to your parents you see it doesn't work out that way you know you'll go you'll go get your own household because you make your own choices but your kingdom will be in shambles your kingdom will be in shambles your family will be in shambles everything will be in shambles so when God gives you a Godly parent and he sees that you then can obey that then he's like okay now I can trust him with his own Kingdom right it's just patterns that you find and God deals with all of us the same right the Bible says he was also tempted if we turn to uh Matthew uh chapter um chapter 4 right he had to go through Temptations just like me and you go through ations in verses 8 and it says again the the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain and show showeth him all the kingdoms of the world in the glory of them and said unto him all these things will I give thee if thou will fall down and worship me then Jesus said unto him get thee hence Satan for it is written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and and him only shalt thy serve so Satan was trying to give him an increase but because he was the word he was be he was able to differentiate said n this ain't this ain't the right thing and you have to be able to differentiate that too as well you might get a good job but if they say you got to work on Sunday you got to have something inside that says like n this ain't no blessing you can keep that right you got to have something inside of you that you can stand the test of time and God always gives you more because the enemy was trying to shorthand him as we'll see later he wasn't just going to be given to the means of the Earth right he knew his position in the word and Hebrews uh the message Hebrews chapter 4 4 preached in 57 um and it says paragraphs or we'll do paragraphs 110 I believe and the prophet said and Jesus went straight to the word and rebuked him talking about the enemy 11 11 says took him up on the mountain and showed him the United States and Germany and Switzerland and all the nations of the world that would ever be the prophet said he showed them all that was going to come and was trying to offer them said they're all mine I do with them whatever I want no wonder we got Wars and troubles said I do with them no wonder women dress and get by with it by the law they're all governed by the devil that's what the Bible says Satan said they're mine I do with them whatever I want said if you'll worship me I'll make you King like I am one verse 12 said Jesus said it's written thou sht Worship the Lord thy God only shalt thy serve get thee behind me Satan why Jesus knew that he would fall air to them in this great Millennium when his kingdom will come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven so Jesus knew he was already going to fall air so he didn't have to go a different way in order to get it and I'm telling you you don't have to go through Shortcuts To Get Your Blessing a lot of times people think they got to cut corners and I got to kind of you you know I got to accelerate this thing in order for me to get a blessing you don't got to do any of that all you got to do is just stand on the word God will bring the blessings to you so Christ knew he would come into power and we're closing in a minute so all through Christ life he was tested in order to prove that he was fit to rule when he stood on the mountain he showed that he wasn't willing to compromise with the word when he became a ruler the way he handled the sin he handled them with compassion well just like the lady that was uh found in adultery he handled it with compassion and God said that's someone that I could put in charge right he uh the way he handled the uh the the unbelievers and the make Believers when the Pharisees tried to come and trip them up with the word he knew just exactly what to say and God said this is someone that can lead and then the final test come on Calvary right and the foundation was set when the world recognized he was innocent the church recognized he was innocent and they still wanted to do away with him and God wanted to see what his reaction was going to be God wanted to see well how you going to react when people do you wrong and you know that you're innocent how are you going to respond to this God is looking for someone fit the rule God is looking for someone that knows how to give compassion God is looking for someone that can turn other cheek God is someone that can God is looking for someone that can show love even when they hate you guts right so he was putting him through a test um and I'm going to read out of the message living dying uh and buried um uh this paragraph 26 um says here then as I said a few moments ago he become we become we were goats he became he became goat for us being he become sin for us that's the reason he had to be punished the way he was because all of our sins were plac upon him and there he had to Bear them away in his own body to Calvary a reproach or disgrace sinfully hanging there naked stripped bleeding bleeding when he rolled his precious head away the bloody locks dripping from his shoulders I believe it was Billy suay said there was an angel setting in every tree there that means he had a whole Army of people looking to help him out just saying just pull pull your hands loose from the cross and just motion your finger will change the scene he had the option the Jews paid him the greatest compliment could be paid not knowing what they were doing they they said he saved others himself he can't save sure not he he if he saved himself he could not save others but he gave himself that we might be saved that's the story so the reason why he went through he did the reason why show he was worthy the reason why God said this is the person that be could be in charge was he was thinking about me and you he was thinking about me and you he had had the option to just turn the scene around and just get rid of all of Rome and all of the Jews that were causing him all this pain because he was innocent right but he was thinking about me and you which was the final test like I said before you got to be careful between a blessing and an increase blessings always consider the word and think about other people right blessings always consider the word and think about uh uh other people and in closing when Jesus Christ died on the cross the Prophet says that he descended down into hell and the enemy that thought he got him but he lived the word so now he could fall air to this blessing or this overflow that God wanted to give him and so he walked right up to the enemy The Prophet says that he ripped the keys of death Hell In The Grave right and then he led the captivities so God kind of God had to come down and bring his hand down there because the Bible says he wouldn't suffer his holy one uh to stay in hell so God brought his hand down Jesus stepped into it he rose him above hell he said look at it he said all of it's yours all of the all of the Demons lying Spirits uh stealing Spirits uh homosexual Spirit God has dominion over all of them I'm telling you you come in contact with Christ if you try to fight your sin yourself you're going to fall they know you don't have dominion over them but when you put Christ into a Believer all sins stop New Management so God then took captivity he took them all the way up God Rose them up above the Earth and said look at the Earth and he saw all the kingdoms he saw the United States He Saw Germany he saw Rome he saw Brazil he saw Africa God said all of it's yours amen then he rose Christ up a little bit more into this uh sixth Dimension to drop the Saints off uh and you know you had Abraham cuz because they couldn't I believe that they brother Jack had preached that there was Paradise and they couldn't go into the they couldn't go into Heaven until the blood was shed so now now we're going up into the sixth Dimension and we know that through a vision brother brandham when God showed him the uh God he said he wanted to see God took him up to the sixth Dimension and he saw all of the Saints there right and he said yeah I see my my my my wife is here my kid is here all of the saints were sitting there but he asked a question though he said where's Jesus yeah so on that day when Christ was God was raising him up and he came up to the sixth Dimension he dropped all the saints off of the sixth Dimension said all right Christ everyone off okay he rose God up even higher than all of the other Saints and placed him on the throne talk about an overflow talk about a overflow of of dominion and power right and I want you to know that there's something special about this realm that Jesus is in because when you're in the sixth realm if you look to the right you'll see Saints you look to the left you'll see Saints but in the seventh Dimension where Jesus is at he looks to his right there's nobody he looked to his left there's nobody to signify there was no one equal right he was in a realm and a place all on his own he looked below his feet he saw time time is a dimension he saw the radio waves that's a dimension he saw the Earth where we're living in that's a dimension he saw hell he saw the spirits that's the dimension he saw all the saints below him to show he had Di overall and then he tried to lift his head up there's something special about this seventh realm he tried to lift his head up and he couldn't do it he couldn't do it because there was no one greater in all the other dimensions you can lift your head up and and see things but when Christ tried to lift his head up it it must have came to his heart whatever you're thinking that is so whatever you say it'll come to pass however you feel about a situation it will have to happen there is no debate there's no one greater that Christ has to look up to and we have to kind of end this uh and I'm going to give a quote because the thing about a blessing is the thing that I love about a blessing is that it always looks at others blessings always look at others and we're going to read out of the message what was the Holy Ghost given for and preached in 59 and it's paragraph 20 and God Jesus Christ have been given all this power and his dominion and everything and we're going to see how he we're going to see what he what he did with with it and I'll just start reading it says now we know what the holy spirit is we found out last night that it's God now when we think of God the father as Jesus spoke here his father God the son as Jesus God the Holy Spirit as what we call it today now that does not mean that there is three individual distinct Gods it means there is one God and three offices may we say it like this all that God was he poured into Christ so all the power Dominion all of that God when when Christ came on Earth and he conquered all and he had dominion over all right God poured himself in Christ he was God because he emptied himself and poured it into Christ which was why he was able to overcome and and then did Christ just keep it to himself though when you have a blessing man you always got to share it with others that's that's a sign that you really been blessed is when you're thinking about other people right and it says here and C it says here he emptied himself and poured it into Christ and Christ was the fullness of the godhead bodily all that Jehovah was he poured it into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into the church right into you all Dominion is not it it all Dominion is in you right your word means something you can take a stand you can speak the word you can receive a overflow you have power over all Spirits you have power over all the Earth you have power over all time right it says not until just one individual God don't have favorites when anyone goes through when when you're when you're going to go through a overflow God don't got any favorites he'll test every single one the same but into the entire body there we come together in unity we have power all that was in all that God was was in Christ and all that Christ was is in you amen let us pray Lord Jesus Christ we've fellowshipped around your word oh Lord God God you oh Lord God are such a considerate God lord Jesus you know the Dominion and power oh God that you have oh Lord God you know the authority that you have oh Lord Jesus Christ but Lord you in your mercy and your love and your your your your great understanding oh lord of how you've put things together Lord you are always thinking of us oh Lord God even when you came on to the earth oh Lord God you put yourself into a body to be tempted to understand what we go through Lord there was a time when your it says one of your friends had died oh Lord God and you came onto the scene and everybody thought it was over oh Lord God and you looked around and everybody was crying and weeping oh Lord Jesus Christ and Lord you could have just spoke the word oh Lord God but it says that you wept too oh Lord God to signify that you understand what we're going through oh Lord Jesus Jesus Christ and that we're not alone oh Lord Jesus Christ even in the midst of our crying and struggling oh Lord God and uh trying to find a way oh Lord God you are with there with us and not just not just with the uh with not just with the word which is what we need but with a understanding of what we're actually going through oh Lord Jesus Christ which makes a world a difference oh Lord God lord when you Rose up on high oh Lord God and God gave you all the Dominion oh Lord God lord your prophecy said you poured that into US oh Lord Jesus Christ Lord we're not just regular people just walking around oh Lord Jesus Christ Lord when we say our words oh Lord God are not just words they don't just fall to the ground oh Lord Jesus Christ but Lord you want to honor our word just as you did with Christ oh Lord

brother Maris has a a friend by the name of Roosevelt whose father's been committed to hospice God we uh know that as long as there's life in his body there's there's a a chance and opportunity for you to bring healing to his body so we ask that you would just move on the scene on behalf of Roosevelt and behalf of his father uh we uh trust Lord that um that you would Lord just lay your nail scar hands on them and bring uh just give them a supernatural touch you're the same God that raised up Lazarus from being 4 days gone so we know there's nothing too hard for you and God we just ask that you move by your spirit um Brother Joseph asks for prayer for his mom and and for his brothers look God they're all just suffering something right now the enemy attacking them in their bodies so we come against you Satan in the name of Jesus and we adure you command you to loose uh those children loose the mom God that they would all be restored to health and that whatever it is that's trying to pass through the household will stop it will cease Lord even right now it will dry up just like the fig tree dried up oh God that no one else will be affected by whatever is passing through so we re we rebuke you now in Jesus name and father we want to give you uh we want to just uh ask also Lord for this neighbor that it uh has um Lord has a brain tumor and father just ask that you moved by your
