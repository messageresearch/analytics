wanted to just quickly update where we were with our pledges all I can see is God is good god is god is good we are we believe in God for a new church and a new school we believe in God for that and they meant our faith is on the line and we have begun to make pledges a man on this there are a couple numbers that are increasing on this every time I'm showing this to you all one number that has remained the same as this is our goal amen for this year for the next few years we are trying to raise one hundred and five thousand dollars every year in order to get the place that we want and we're asking that the church would just pledge towards that and then since laughs since last month this number actually rose somebody else pledged and we thank God for that a man so we thank God but that's actually moving to catch up with this so if you haven't pledged you can get in on this it's don't miss your blessing hey man they only come every once in awhile so if you want a pledge to help us get to this this level of it man we have a little form out there on the on that you're going out you can pledge and put it in a little box and we will certainly receive it as a vote right now we have received twenty nine thousand three hundred forty six dollars and four cents on our on our goal praise the Lord I'm excited about that I mean I just see the Lord just working in our midst and it's moving we've never had a season like this state man in our church and and I know that it's a hand of the Lord that is that is blessing his people a man and rather y'all keep it in your pocket y'all giving it back to the Lord and God God keep on blessing you right so we thank you for that and you know so that's so far we have $29,000 towards that and early in a year we had a four hundred dollar transfer that we pull out of this balance we pulled out because we had to pay our rent amen and we mentioned to the church that we don't want to do that that number should never be there and since that time the church has stepped up and you all have you know just helped me the need every month and I'm grateful for that and so I met a man on this is twenty eight thousand nine hundred forty six even though we received twenty nine thousand we had to take four hundred out so our net is twenty eight thousand is that right I might be looking at something you have 28,000 946 so just we thank God for that so we're still making progress we're moving in the right direction and all over on Friday night my brother branham made a statement that just kind of hit me he said he received a check for a million dollars in the other tables I received a check for a million dollars now he was saying it was somebody wrote him a check that was signed in the name of Jesus or something like that but when he said I'm like no I'm taking that literally if God can send somebody with a check for a thousand dollars Kenny says somebody with a check for a million dollars praise God so I say I'm receiving that man and I'm looking forward to one day y'all gonna see me come up y'all go see the number there to jump from 29,000 to 1 million my brother Jack what happened God did it God seen it God did it so I'm money expectation ain't man and and I'm looking forward to seeing what God gonna do with this a man y'all know if y'all just give it to him he'll bless it when we gave it a Jesus he's able to multiply it right and y'all just watch what he does with that I'm I'm on the expectation a man I'm under expectation y'all y'all be in prayer there's churches popping up on the market every week every week and I'm going looking at them to look at one this weekend amen they said they wanted three million that's a lot that's a lot of money coming here brother branham staff just got a million dollar check I said okay there ain't a lot of money Dawkins in it God consider well that wasn't whatever you know I just believe God I'm trusting God all the way through so they managed it's not our project as here's we just want to do what we can in the midst of it so Matt let's give God preached what he's done he stayed man with this number say 29 but I'm I'm a rounded up to 30,000 thank God for this $30,000 that he's giving us a man this is this is a real blessing a real blessing hey man I just appreciate the Lord musicians thank y'all so much appreciate you want a man I needed to also just quickly announce the next Sunday well two things I need to mention that week we got for you all came here we got new neighbors amen and we thank God for the neighbors in the school that the Lord gave us when we shut it down a church moved in and they say they like to praise the Lord I was telling the pastor come by to see me one night I was here and they come by to see me say you say pastor I just wanted to make sure that we were you know neighborly with us they it's it's alright so I rather have a church next door then they have a bar and and and we've gone through that before Amen here the church we had a body was playing a music and my god we couldn't get no cooperation with him but uh but you know he was telling me just want to be cordial and they said well we'll we'll just you know listen and see what what happens and and if we need adjust something on our side of y'all need to just something on your side then we'll make the adjustments and we'll go from there but for now we just praise the Lord that we got somebody a man next door that uh that we can we can get along with hey man it's so I need to also ask that when we're leaving church as you know that they have Church so we probably can't stand right outside of their door and you know hold conversations we want to give them room to be able to get out of their door and everything like that so let's just kind of do what we can to make sure that everybody a man is neighborly and and then on top of that this may be the Seas and that the Lord is moving us forward and sometimes he has to make things uncomfortable makes a little uncomfortable in order to you know launch you're out of it so Amen so we thank God for all things and everything we give him thanks so what so just keep that in mind and on next Sunday I got a text from a precious friend of mine he said he was coming down for a cruise he and his wife are gonna be coming down for a cruise out of Fort Lauderdale and say we gonna be in church on next unless it oh is that right I say well if would you pray about speaking for us since you're gonna be here and I said sure I'll pray about it and I heard back from over yesterday say I'll be glad to do it brother Ivonne carry on a man from New York City will be here brother Yvonne is actually the former pastor of brother insisted Robles they met before they came down this way and oftentimes when he comes to Florida he just slip in on a Wednesday night and just sit in the audience and just slip out but this time he let me know ahead of time what his plan was so we're gonna use him amen on next week and I'm just looking forward to the Lord just blessing us a man in that service and and and the other thing that that's gonna be happening for me I'll be here next Sunday morning but I have a flight that I have to catch on Sunday afternoon I'll be ministering in Jamaica for they have a meeting of Monday next Monday so I'll be there they may go on to minister in that meeting and you know so just keep me in prayer I'll be back home on Tuesday but I'm just going to going over to Jamaica to minister in the meeting there for their Monday service a man and know it's gonna be a Sunday night and Monday so I'll get there in time I think for the Sunday night service but uh but I'll be kind of slipping right out right after services try to go catch the catch the flame so please keep me in prayer a man regarding that praise the Lord Amen so amen I have to think that's all that I need to announce right now for up to you thank you Jesus I feel like they got a glad I got Jesus going on ya know about ready to get in today the mine no wrong with it go ahead and praise Him go ahead and praise Him one thing I will tell you is that God has purpose for everything he does the the pastor you

our sisters to look like them sisters so you know you have a testimony and everything that everything that happens right God God don't make no mistake God don't make no mistake so you know from I understand this church has been around for about 12 13 years and they were down the street and kind of think I had to move out because of some things that change they're looking for a new faces and they got this face and you know so you know to be good to you know just sit god bless you sometimes you just never know you just never know so we just be spirit of truth a man but we just thank God for all things so we don't we don't we don't preach babe man and y'all just y'all just try to block it Amen but it's all gülen's Amen because it's all God's and they might they might hit one of you

them over to work but that's alright you know if you're shouting over that song that's fine hey man but we we just praise we just appreciate the Lord I am I want to invite you to stand to your feet we want to we want to read the scripture amen for today I was that sermon on phone Friday night brother branham I just I was my lord I wouldn't expect the next and it just really really blessed me if you all get a chance go back and listen to the sermon the power of the devil the power of the devil and and I'm kind of I'm taken from some things that he said there on Friday night and we're building our thought for today and I trust that it'll be a blessing to you a man I want praise the Lord I want to have you turn to Exodus 1 and the the title today is the end of Satan's Dominion a man that is our title today the end of Satan's Dominion praise the Lord a man turn with me to Exodus chapter 1 a man how they lujah and I'm starting here verse 12 Amen in Exodus chapter 1 it says but the more they afflicted them the more they multiplied and grew and they were grieved because of the children of Israel and Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigor and they made their lives bitter with hard bondage and mortar and in brick and in all manner of service in the field all their service wherein they made them serve was with rigor and the king of Egypt speak to the Hebrews the Hebrew midwives of which the name of the one was Chiffre in the name of the other and he said when you do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew woman and see them upon the stools if it be a son then you shall kill him but if it be a daughter then she shall live but the midwives feared God and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them but saved the men children alive and the king of Egypt called for the midwives and said unto them why have you done this thing and have saved the men children alive and the midwives said unto Pharaoh because the Hebrew women are not as Egyptian women for they are lively and I'll deliver ere the midwives come in unto them pretty much before we get there they already had the children right so it's verse 21 says and it came to pass I'm sorry is that right verse 20 now therefore God dealt well with the midwives and the people multiplied and waxed very mighty and it came to pass because the midwives feared God that he made them this amen because they fear at God he made them houses and Ferrell charged all his people saying every son that is born ye shall cast every son that is born he shall cast it into the river and every daughter ye shall save alive amen the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word let's just bow and a quick word of Prayer a man father we thank you for the ability to read the word of the Lord but we know it takes the Holy Spirit to bring things clearer to us so we pray God that you would just help us to hear what the the Spirit wants to stay here on today be glorified and magnified in this place and God we want to also just thank you for this church that you have blessed with a location where they can worship you and praise you and thank you God the same way that you provided for them and yes it was you that provided for them because the Prophet told us that you are responding that they're your responsibility the church natural and the church spiritual is still your responsibility so the same way that you provide it for them is the same way that you have provided for us and will provide for us so we we actually react we actually thank you for the doors that you are already opening and and Lord every we're gonna walk into something we were believing you for a new church in a new school and and God we've given you amen thus far thirty thousand dollars for you to multiply a man and we're not afraid of any any number that they might throw before if it's if it's for us then there's no number that can stop us from getting it praise God so father you are you are God that you provide thousands and you provide millions and God's or whatever the need is we know that you'll provide we thank you in advance and we give you glory we give you honor we give you praise this in Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you can be seated [Music] man so again our title here is the end of Satan's Dominion and as we that the scripture the very last verse here Nexus 1 says in Pharaoh charge all his people saying every son that is born he shall cast into the river and every daughter ye shall save alive a man every every daughter ye shall save alive every son was to be cast into the river but every daughter was to be saved alive now the Prophet just kind of gives us a man a few things that we want to start out with here and this will read a quote out of the message the power of the devil a man here in paragraph 24 it says look at him he says look at him as soon as we find the first chapter almost in Exodus the book of Redemption that we find the devil there to cut off the very program of God he says the first thing was was this issue made by Pharaoh that they would throw all the children melters and born of the Hebrews in the river and drowned them think of it that same lizard eyed devil a man how that back there in the beginning look at Abel as soon as Satan seen that through through that righteous seed through Abel was going to come out the Redeemer quickly he went to work to destroy the very thing the very chosen tool that God was going to use he went right straight to destroy it's a man and you know I was we were hitting something in Sunday school a couple weeks ago brother branham a the statement says what God has set his heart home Satan is bound to destroy right what God has set his heart on is bound to try to destroy and and if you could just kind of think back in your old life the various times where you about this close to death amen the various times I mean I can go back and I remember almost being drowned when I was a young man I remember being in a car accident when I was a you know the young young young adult a man just various times in my life where the devil tried to wipe me out right but and it's because when God has set his heart on something Satan is bound to try to destroy what God has said it's hard on they may enter hallelujah Amen here in this particular passage we'll see God has set his heart on Moses Amen and Moses is going to be the deliverer for the children of Israel but my saying don't know which one of these boys gonna be the deliverer so Satan's plan is to kill all the boys amen and hallelujah I want to say this real quick Satan could not amen be successful in his plan to kill Moses and he also will not be his successful and his plan to kill you hallelujah the same time that made away from Moses is the same God that is making a way for you oh yeah amen I was thinking about this you know see you know when we look at this the description was telling us that the more they were afflicted and these are conditions of of an exodus right these are the things that happened during the exodus when and and and here they were going out of each have been going into a promised land amen Egypt represents the world and we are leaving each of today going into a promised land which is the rapture amen that's what we're on the expectation for but during the accidents there are certain conditions that you'll see there and here we see the more they were afflicted the more they multiplied I like that Amen because if we were to be honest everybody in here got some type of trial that they're going through everybody in here got got something that our Amen it's like man I never saw that coming but but the more that the devil afflicts you amen the other side to that this is my brother I don't say when all hell break loose huh amen don't don't just don't just give the devil credits right when all hell break loose the other family I promise that all heaven will also break loose so the more they afflicted him the more they multiplied amen the greater the trial the greater the blessings the greater the tests the greater the testimony the more they afflicted them the more they multiplied and what a flick mean is to cause pain amen or distress so sometimes the devil does things that cause pain as well as the called distress the Bible also says that they had to serve the Egyptians with rigor amen and what that were rigor means is harshness they had to serve Amen under harsh terms and harsh conditions they had to serve with rigor sometimes when you're going through your job it seems like you're going through with rigor but that's the condition of the Exodus and the other thing the Bible said it made their lives bitter with hard bondage not just bondage but hard bondage may their lives bitter with hard bondage and and and the other thing I like about this is that was in verse 14 exits 1:14 since when they made their lives bitter with hard bondage in mortar amen and in brick and an awl man of service in the field all their service where they made them serve was with rigor and when you look at that everything they did everything everything they tried to do amen the devil's right there to make it very difficult for them hallelujah it's the same thing with us everything we try to do that Devils right there to try to make it difficult for us but he's a defeated foe hallelujah because that's just the first chapter but by the time you get to the end of Exodus they were delivered from Amen their bondage so no matter how hard the devil makes it three of deliverance hallelujah I believe that church let's go on here a little further amen the other thing that we find there in Scripture this condition of the Exodus a man the king one of the Hebrew midwives to kill all the male children but because they fear God more than they fear the King or the words of the king they're loud the male children to leave I mean to live and because they did that because they honor God then God bless them and I want to tell you something if you honor God today God will bless you in the midst of your trial I regardless if you honor God God will bless you I love this Satan tried to stop Moses but God used the same place of destruction for the little babies because it was a river right God used the same place of destruction for the little babies to become the place of deliverance for Moses right amen the same river where Satan was trying to kill him God use that same river amen to bring him into Pharaoh's Palace hallelujah God know how to turn things around on the devil the same plane said that's that Saints say I'm gonna pick him up right here God say no I'm gonna take him to right here Saints not Moses but God use the same place of destruction for the little babies to become the delivers for Moses and the tune of Israel the devil Clinton stopped Moses the children of Israel did not see and I wanted to just kind of bring this in here because you know and hear what brother Branham was telling us let me let me just kind of slow this down because he said he made a comment here that it was the river go to paragraph 26 on the power of the devil amen look at this he said something about this she says how he tried to do it and succeeded in Matthew 27 he succeeded of doing it but here's what what I like Satan can only his minion only reigns down to the river his Dominion only reigns down to the river river means death for separation that's all the father Satan that seems Dominican come it stops within God he can't let me go says what beautiful type what a beautiful huh to know that everything every one of the believers when they stand by the grave weeping over their children over their loved ones Saint can stand rock in the midst and look I'm them shadows yonder to a God of resurrection from the dead for what a picture this beautiful book lays out to us here in parables teaching us by those things back there what's going to do and confirmed every word of it in Christ Jesus our Lord the perfect Redeemer then he goes on to say this he says how that going to the river they take the little ones and throw them into the river and then notice that's the end of Satan's Dominion that's our title right there to end the sings Dominion that's the end of things Dominion is the man canal from that farm to the liver and then its power is cut off it is that Satan has the power death but thanks be to the Living God who has a power of Resurrection beyond the shadows of death let's go a little further what a marvelous thing it is he says I want you to look at it study for a minute every one of us under the remain of Satan here in this world which is which is his he walked in the fire brimstone before there was a creature on it it belongs to him he's a ruler of it tonight and every government every politic he's a ruler that's the way that's have wars and rumors of wars and troubles but don't think some glorious day it's took Jesus up on the top of the mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world that's all it was or would be that's mine I'll deal with him whenever I want to and I'll give to you if you'll fall down and worship me jesus knew that he was going to fall heir to those things anyhow in the Millennium so he said get behind me Satan it's written thou shalt worship the Lord and him only shall help him only show you serve so as brother Branham just kind of bringing out Satan had a limitation you have power but he had a limitation and he had to stop at the river a man that's where his domain stop was at the river and I just wanted to count according to Scripture amen we see it happening here where Moses was to live but you know there come a time and Moses life when he was bringing the chill of Israel out of Egypt hallelujah amen and as he was leaving them out of Egypt Pharaoh was very upset that all the slaves were fevers a man it not only did they leave but they left with a wealth of things they had an abundance of things as they were leaving they they did not leave Egypt for how can I say that again they did not leave Egypt for and this rapid if they didn't leave Egypt for we not gonna leave in the rapture for a man that's why I believe I see that handle our blessing because the more they're flicked the more God blesses right so we're not gonna leave here poor and I mean when we look at all the to the visitor they were I mean the children I mean shouldn't mister I said we're leaving Egypt Pharaoh was so upset with them leaving and if so so disappointed could not stop the god of Moses and all the plates that were dropped down in Egypt at that time even to the losing of his firstborn son there I was very upset well we met when he finally tell mothers two people leave Egypt and just get out of here well Moses got my people name s hallelujah but Pharaoh Amen the devil nor to him and got upset he say we going back after them each I mean I've after lets his rights we're bringing them back under bondage we should have never let him go hallelujah but he got him down to the Red Sea when Moses didn't know what to do he stretched out his rod in front of the Red Sea and God began to partner on I'm a partner waters now Moses made a statement that God didn't tell him to make but Moses said these ships is that you have seen today you will see them no more forever Moses did not know how God was gonna bring that word to pass but he spoke it by faith amen and before you knew it because the end of Satan's Dominion was have to ever remember that it was at the river so when they came to the Red Sea and Moses in the Chilam Israel with evil Red Sea but fairness honor came behind him a men to follow Moses in the children of Israel no God were making away for their foot for the armies of Pharaoh God was making away for his people and as they fall they got crown because that's where Satan's Dominion had come to an end and the Egyptians they had seen that day they were gonna see no more forever there's an end to this thing you know we're gonna have some trials but eventually we gonna be we gonna have no more trials right it's got it's gonna come to an end and I'm looking forward to that a man I put this titular Israel did not see the Egyptians anymore after their experience at the Red Sea and let me tell you something the devil could stop Moses when he was born the devil could not stop the tiller Israel from leaving Egypt and making it to the promised land amen and the delica stopped him the devil could stop Moses the devil also can't stop you Oh hallelujah glory to God I was looking at this because when we look at this scripture in Exodus we see a very clear title to the days of Jesus because here when when Satan was trying to destroy Moses and and he got in Pharaoh and said kill all the the little ones amen two years old and under get them and then kill him and a man especially out of little boys make sure you get them they did they tried that same trick when Jesus was born right here Satan got into the leader oh my y'all gotta watch these things because it's just a political wreath or where the pressure might come from right it was a political arena in Moses day it was a political arena in Jesus day in a beautiful little Katrina today right but by here here's a here's a good thing when when Harriet Amen saw that he was tricked by the wise men that they met didn't come back and tell him where the child was so he could come and worship them amen went went went when I when when Herod saw that did inherit came up with a commandment kill all the babies two years old and under hallelujah but this is a good part about it when it came up with that law Jesus was already gone when he came up with this plan Jesus was not even in lay in the lane and I was feeling as I said before the fullness of the tribulation sets in the bride will already be come before son of must destroy what make believer amen was already go and if God could watch over a lot like that what you think he gonna do for his bride so before the pressure get too too difficult will already be gone I believe that with all of my heart amen let's go on here a little further amen I'm going to paragraph e 25 in this and the power of the devil a man Satan's the end of his Dominion is at that river it's at that river we found it with a man with the children of Israel as they were going it meant over to the promised land then we gypsies ain't saw no more because they got drowned in that Red Sea hallelujah look at this now glory to God he says look at it in the time of Joseph when God was making manifest son of God Jesus Christ through Joseph look how Satan come about the 27th chapter a man Genesis Genesis there that Satan come to destroy Joseph and would have done it but there see the very tool that God was going to use he says over in chronicles about the 22nd chapter the royal seed how he's how he tried to destroy that and on over and and and matthew the second chapter look how quickly that satan was on the job when he threw it was about the time for the redeemer to be born he got into the political leaders and sent forth an issue and destroyed all the young children from two years old down uh-oh down in order to kill the Lord Jesus now I was on I was impressed you know by by by this when brother Branham said over in Chronicles about the 22nd chapter and he's talking about how Amen the the royal seed they were trying to destroy the royal seat so I kind of went back over there into the second chronicles twitting 22 and and I looked at a couple of things that were there Amen this particular chapter speaks of a man a half's daughter her name is a failure amen and for those of you that might not know the story what a failure did one time was she raised up and she she took control of the kingdom this was a woman that was not supposed to be leave him but she became the leader amen at a time because she had all the royal seat kill at least she thought she did she had all she was trying to kill all the lawyers seats so she could actually take control of the kingdom and this lady reigned for six years a man the issue was is that when it when she when she put out the heat it to kill all the king's sons all the rightful heirs there was one person Amen that got the baby his name was Joe Ash and then here joash away so that she could finally she couldn't kill him oh my god I like this he was the only one left of the Kings seed that can actually take the throne he was legally the heir to the throne I want you to follow this Amen with me amen this morning he was legally the heir to the thumb joash happened to be Amen the great-grandson of Jehoshaphat glory to God now I want you to watch a couple things here with me because Jehoshaphat he was a righteous King remember the Prophet could not even prophesy when they came like Shakira prophesied he said all these are all these other guys coming to try to get me to give a word my god he can prophesy til he got somebody to start playing some anointed music and when they begin to play that not to music Guinea got into the spirit Issei I wouldn't even do this if the AUSA fact wasn't even standing here with y'all he had respect for Jehoshaphat's so here is joash was a a great-grandson of Jehoshaphat now some key things everyone that's kind of found out here I'll tell you tried to kill them all and I believe was at the age of seven that they finally brought joash out of temple and they they they can't let him up on the pedestal Nate they begin to anoint him as King and when a failure heard what was going on she ran into the courts and and now there was a by the name of Johanna I believe at that time and that priest and he had put a plan in place that soon as a failure coming y'all make sure y'all get her and kill her not only that but anybody that's following her killed them too hallelujah and they got rid of a failure out of land and it gave this guy so asked the opportunity to start raining without a man without a failure interfere and I'll tell you remember what's a half story born of Jezebel now watch this God protected a man the seed because it was through this lineage that Jesus Christ was actually coming Oh hallelujah but I want you to watch something here glory to God look at this a man joash was responsible for helping to repair the house of God you find that in second chronicles 2:24 amen also I want to call joy since he was a great grandson of Jehoshaphat I want to call him a fourth-generation believer now stay with me I won't have time to go into all of that today but there's a sermon that's in my heart where I want to talk about things that happen in the fourth generation because we're at that time again hallelujah okay now I'll just share a little bit I'm seeing things Amen in the fourth generation of believers that I don't think I ever seen raise the Lord I might as well just say these things while I'm here right in my generation and man there would have been no dancing at my wedding in the generation before me no dancing at no wedding but in the pro generation I'm seeing some stuff I never thought I would see in the message see things happen in that full generation until God likes to fire a can and that's what we are expectations for God to light the fire again in the four generations this man Joe Ashe is a part of the fourth generations right stay with me here glory to God now see he was I want to call fourth generation amen Israelite coming from the hosta fact all right here's a problem Amen whip whip whip whip on joash because when you go back and you read it story there in the Book of Chronicles second chronicles 22 23 24 so on and then when you go back to read it you'll find out with him being a fourth-generation believer oh my god what happened is that he only served God as long as your Haider was living Johanna was the police and he only served God as long as so hard of living as soon as you're hired this man turns idolatry not only turn idolatry but the man killed so hiring a son for rebuking him I want you to watch this I want you to watch this you know I told you that that this this man was a part of the lineage of Jesus Christ but when you go back to you read the scripture in Matthew a man chapter 1 verse 8 you see that his name was out of the lineage hallelujah and I'm sure I'm sure that you know they said it was intentional because he turned the people to idol worship even though he was a part of it but he turned the people to idol worship that they didn't even mention his name now he did some good things but it was the end that mattered most and in the beginning he restored the altar he repaired the house of God he did a lot of things like that but amen in the end he's killing the priest son because of man rebuked him watch this I picked up here July 2 died he turned out after July 2 died Joe has turned to idolatry amen also joash ended up dying on the sick man after his service conspired to kill him and when you just start looking at all these things that's meant being a part of fourth generation I wanna I want a war in the fourth generation I want to warn the fourth generation the Devils after y'all like like none other before he's after the fourth generation amen and see what I wasn't what I mean by that I'm brother Branham would be that first generation my parents would have been that second generation right and they're here I would have been a part of that third generation but my kids I'm fourth generation and look at what has happened in the fourth generation it was only when the fourth generation came along that people separated from the message ah this is this is a spirit that has been released in the land to come against the fourth generation but God wants to light the fire gift I wanna I want to show you something here brother random told us that you know there was Satan after a men joash he was after he was after Joseph he was after joash she was after moot he was after Jesus that same Devils after you but he can only go so far and the other thing I want you to notice that the devil can't stop you he couldn't stop Joey she couldn't stop Jesus he couldn't stop Moses he couldn't stop the children of Israel the devil can't stop you either I don't care if he does decide to use the same tricks they will not work Oh hallelujah they will not he used the same same trick on Moses it didn't work he came back around his same trick on Jesus it didn't work and he's trying to use the same trick on you today it will not work I love that look at this the profit goes on to say this in the pal the devil I'm going to paragraph he I think I might have already ready he said his Dominion only reigns down to the river his Dominion only reigns down to the river glory to God glory to God I want to a man make a little turn a man if I can on this thought here today here's the million only reigns down to the river glory to God I want to turn a corner Satan wanted to use the river to destroy God's deliverance Moses God's deliver Satan want to use the river to destroy God's deliver but I want to show you in scripture how God uses the river to vindicate his delivery Satan wanna use the river to destroy Gosselaar he want to destroy Moses right but God used that same river to bring Moses through but it wasn't only at that time I want to go to a scripture in Luke 7 I'm turning a corner a man Luke chapter 7 thank you Jesus hallelujah and we're starting here verse 19 bear with me glory to God Satan wanted to use the river to destroy God's deliver but God uses the river to vindicate his delivery hey man look at this Luke 7 verse 19 and John calling unto his unto him two of his disciples sitting them to Jesus saying art thou he that should come for look we for another now hear what brother branham tells us about John being a man a prophet of God here John gets to a situation where brother Adam says eagle I got filmed over a man and what what aloud is evil I to get filmed over is the trial that he was going through Amen that the distress that he was going through causes Eagle Eye to become filmed over now look notice what now he's and he's in prison he's calling for the disciples disciples have come he's telling the disciples now you know this guy Jesus I won't try to go following his ministry and and try to get an audience with him and then ask him art thou he that should come or look we for another look at it when the men were come unto him they said John the Baptist I'm in verse 20 John the Baptist's have sent us unto thee saying art thou he that should come or look we for another verse 21 and in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues and of evil spirits and unto many that were blind he gave sight look since then Jesus answering a man said unto them go your way and tell John I never answered their question exactly or directly they had to catch up on Revelation look then jesus answered ascended him go your way and tell John what things you have seen and heard how that the blind see the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the Deaf hear the data raised to the poor the gospel is preached it says and then he leaves a statement says blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me now I want to just kind of I wanna I want us to kind of meditate on this just for a little bit because I said how God Amen I say we use the river to try to destroy God's deliver but God will use the river to vindicate his deliverer now we know God did that in the days of Moses when when when when they tried to kill all the babies they did not get in Moses God allowed Moses to make it right down in the Pharaohs house and be raised up as a deliverer in Pharaoh's house God know how to turn the situation around right so here what seemed was trying to destroy it God was using it to vindicate now here in this particular passage of Scripture John got to a spot where is his his prophetic I got filmed all over his prophetic eye a man he would say he was kind of looking at things a little a lot a little different because of the trial that he was in and maybe maybe John was thinking to himself I mean if he really is the Christ if he really is who I thought he was then maybe he would get me out of the situation that I'm in Oh hallelujah and then maybe he would come down and deliver me from this prison right but but that was not Jesus intention remember John spoke the words he must increase and I must decrease this was time for trying to go out the scene but he didn't think he'd be going off like Oh hallelujah and the reason I say that God uses derivative indicates let's turn back over to John chapter 1 now over amen John chapter 1 look at this a man God uses derivative indicates hallelujah John had a question because of his trial amen amen amen but to trial does not change who your God is glory glory glory your trial does not change who your God is and the reason I say John should not have this question because look at John 1 and then verse 26 it says John answered them saying i baptize with water but their standeth one among you whom you know not he it is who coming after me is preferred before me whose shoe lachen i am not worthy to unloose these things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan where John was baptizing listen the next day John seeth Jesus coming up to him and said behold the lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world this is he of whom I said after me comes a man which is before before me for he was before me listen and I knew him not but that he should be made manifest to Israel therefore am i clumb baptized it with water john is identifying who jesus is son knows by revelation who cheetah says verse 32 begins to give us a little clearer picture here and john bear record saying amen I saw the Spirit descended from heaven like a dove and then a boat upon him and I knew him not but but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same as he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost now when I when I thought about that John had this experience at the river as a River Jordan where he was baptizing God was vindicating that Jesus was amen the deliverer Jesus was the Lamb of God Shawn code the revelation at deliver and what he caught at the river should have sustained him it should have satisfied him but when he got in trouble when he got while he's beginning to doubt what happened oh I like this you know why because you know not not only did God Amen identify who Christ was John John said it's Saints a now the one that he showed me because it's a didn't know who he was but it's a the one that he told me to say when I see the spirit this sin and I am remaining and I love this part right here I love this part right here verse 33 it says I know I'm not but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me unto whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same as he was baptized with the Holy Ghost and I just thought on now say you know John it was he was very excited about being able to baptize the people in water but when you going to be baptized in water you just going to a man hallelujah but John was preaching something higher they've been baptized in water just a that's coming one Amen that can baptize you with the Holy Ghost in another thing another statement it says with the Holy Ghost and with fire fire is to burn out everything in your life that is not like God we don't want to be satisfied just going to a man amen to be baptized in water we need Jesus Christ the man to baptize with the Holy Ghost hair with fire Oh glory to God totally satisfied just getting to the man get to the man Jesus Christ that's when you've accomplished something Oh hallelujah John is constantly porting themselves so when John was going through his trial John should have reflected back on this particular time because God showed him clearly that this was the man when you see the Spirit of God amen descending and remaining on him you know this is the one that you came to introduce but John because of the trial begin to to take that main name in and begin to lose heart got a little faint there's a man in it and I just I want to just kind of bring this around if I could do you not believe this message do you not believe because it wasn't only with John that God proved that this is my deliverer see God also did the same thing with his prophet in this hour where did he vindicate him at the river the Ohio River he vindicated Jesus at the Jordan River even John they were coming to John John was vindicated and the river huh the same way that the devil's trying to take the river to take people out right God is using the river to vindicate but before this this sermon is over I'm gonna show you how to devil himself will be destroyed at the river the end of his domain it happening forever glory to God glory to God God vindicated moses khan vindicated john god vindicated jesus god vindicated brother branham hallelujah let me just read this out of do you now believe he says now if any man be in Christ he be a new creature says then God has set in the church different things now man can testify of anything but until God confirms that and says it's so it isn't so you got you got a right to disbelieve it and time till God vindication see I mean you got a right to disbelieve it until guns got vindicates that it's the truth then you have no more right to disbelieve not I like that you got a right to disbelieve it if it's not vindicated you got a right to walk away from it if it's not vindicated but if it's vindicated you don't have any more likes you understand that church you have normal right if it's vindicated and yes it's been vindicated time and time again watch this amen it says once God's been the kids at his truth him you have no more right to disbelieve God it's that right now it was a while some time ago I knew nothing about two people when I was born this light see you know there was a statement and I missed it literally I should have said it brother Branham hitting on winsome for Friday night in the sermon he was saying how there come a time where Moses mom and I'm beginning to hide him because they knew he was a proper child right right and even brother batter up said he he said I hope you catch it and he just kept going now now when when he said that I'm like oh my he can identify himself in Scripture maybe in maybe in a Baba don't see this don't say this but I'm just gonna say maybe maybe the way that the parents knew that this was a proper child maybe at Moses verse something happened in the room because when brother Branham was born that light came into the room and the dog was flying around I mean they knew there was something special about the South did that happen when you were born right God got a way of identifying who his person is right amen and all you gotta do is just follow the vindication gotta take care of rest of it right but maybe maybe Moses parents saw something special when it's born that's why they can identify him as a proper trial hallelujah let's go on here the brother Branham goes on to say this he says says I I knew nothing about you people when I was born this light angel Lord which they have the picture of it I'm sorry we don't have any tonight we haven't had them for some time their copyright is so tight we have to pay the same price to get them that you that you would get them usually we just tell you where to go get them you can ask at the desk and they'll tell you where it's a it's copyrighted yonder the American photographer Association has it the VI the everything all the scientists has chased it through the very best we have George J Lacey and there's his signed statement that it's the first time in all the world's history that it could be scientifically scientifically proven that there was a supernatural being that same angel of God that's right here you see nightly moving there it is on pictures mr. lacy said the mechanical eye of this camera Reverend random won't take psychology he said the light struck the limbs and it's a leaping flaming emerald fire of burning many times it comes right into the meeting you can see it thousands times thousands have seen at a time since recently when I was baptizing on the river at Jeffersonville when all the local newspapers packed it two o'clock in the afternoon when I was praying here it come right down out of the heavens right at two o'clock in the evening June or in an afternoon rather and June about the middle joon-hyung right over there hour and a voice from it saying ask John the Baptist what's it to warn the people of the first coming of Christ so is this message to warn the people of the second coming right back up into the heavens when the people scream fainted what is it gone get in the church ready you don't need no new doctrine you don't need no new theories you need real true hearts to Almighty God to believe on God and his son Christ Jesus have fellowship with everybody all the Christians by the Holy Spirit amen on that river when when when the pillar fire come down and not just come down but spoke y'all know God speaks and he spoke and he said as John the Baptist for ran the first coming and and and I want you to understand something John the Baptist did full run that first coming and and John the Baptist saw the Spirit of God settled on Jesus but when he went through his trial he began to question whether Jesus was the one or should we look for nothing y'all know what brother Branham had a complex and in it's complex and standing in the gap you know he was thinking about just you know leaving the field going to be a bum and you know and God had to kind of show him a little something saying I've you if you want to be a bum I saw a man in the restaurant they say and it's in a sense and it like you and his brother here for a Fletcher he say he didn't want to look like that and he said but he forgot the feeling of the people he had lost the feeling of people said when he lost the feeling other people he said that he began a development company said they won't listen to anything I got to say Lord so he just he said I want to just go to the wilderness and when you give me a word I go out and say and then I'm coming back to the wilderness well brother many when he got into that complex that feature the Lord met him in the car and began to talk to him say he'd say pretty much he told them remember how you know say say he'd say remember how Moses had a complex he'd say also remember let me see if I can just find this really quick I'm gonna just bring the scene I'm going to standing standing in the gap just bear with me here you got this complex on oh my god a man a man a man a man thank you Jesus I don't think I might have yes yes paragraph 124 standing the gap I want you to just kind of catch this because here God had to take just like John the Baptist had to go back a man maybe to the river experience of where God vindicated Jesus God had to take brother Branham back to the Ohio River experience hallelujah and I think it's time for God to take some other people back so what happened at the river oh my god and man we're looking at a bridge and we can't see because Google doesn't tell us that people fell off the bridge we don't believe Google no no prophet said they fell off they fell off hey man and if you say you can't believe a prophet tell me something like that then you can't believe Genesis you can't believe well I just Genesis I put it that way you can't believe Genesis you want to know why cuz Moses wrote Genesis and Moses was not there him being a prophet God showed him what happened in the Garden of Eden and brought it all the way up to Exodus Moses was not born until Exodus amen all right so you gotta believe you gonna believe a prophet believe a prophet all right listen but here he says this that's that Billy he was sound asleep I said Billy was that you and he didn't even wake up and I thought Lord God I flipped my car down what does it mean I said Billy Billy said what do you want I said I said you're talking to me a wife says and I said I want to tell you something I dreamed a dream not long ago you remember seeing that guy that looked like me and fletched asked mother when you get back to Tucson I told her his told her this dream and Billy there's something that's happening it's going on now something was talking to me I thought it was you he looked at me kind of strange and waited a little bit we was driving on so a few minutes we went back to sleep again and I was driving along thinking about what could that mean drive along right and right in the road and all at once hear them talking again and it's that return did not I tell you in the beginning to do the work of an evangelist when I call you down on the river not I say as John the Baptist was sent to set forth to full run the first coming wasn't John more than a prophet Jesus says so himself what you go out to see a prophet more than a prophet so here God had to take the Prophet back to his experience on the Ohio River to shake him out of his conflicts hallelujah see God has to vindicate his just like famous trying to wipe I'm out at the river God takes it to the river to vindicate them there hallelujah can't return one more corner Amen and I will bring it home today I just love I just love this I love this Oh glory to God there's a couple statements that I want to make and I'm gonna read another a couple of quotes in scriptures amen brother Branham made a statement I won't read this quote he just made the statement out of Gabriel's instructions the dangers that Satan the once possessor because of the fall at the garden is bound and cast into the lake of fire his days are finished another one here let's let's look at this in the breech let's read this out of the breech between the seven churches and seven seals look at this it says notice here he comes leaves are thrown as an intercessor as a slain lamb to become a lion king to bring the whole world into judgment that's rejected our kinsman redeemer then is king over all why he's got the title deed of redemption in all lays within his hand I'm glad I know him then claims his inheritance that's the church the pride he claims it what does he do then I love this he disposes of his contestant see what I mean saying I'll come to an end he disposes of his contestant Satan he throws him into a lake of fire with all those who has inspired who was inspired by Satan to reject his word of redemption I like that he throws him into what I'm so glad the scripture calls it a lake of fire the same way that devil tried to wipe out Moses at a river Amen that same devil gonna be wiped out at a lake Oh hallelujah hallelujah I love that let's read this Amen in Revelation 20 hallelujah hallelujah revelation 20 that same devil that tried to wipe out Moses way back in Exodus now we see his end Oh glory to God glory to God glory to God here in Revelation 20 starting at verse 1 since this says and I saw an angel come down from heaven having a key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand and see that bottomless pit is that this these are revelations that are thoughts that come from Hell that cannot be substantiated by Scripture but yet the church is holding on to it right the Satan is behind a man the the inspiration that comes from the bottomless pit so look it says I saw an angel come down from heaven have him the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand and he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and Satan and bound him a thousand years Oh ain't this something can you imagine the devil being bound can you imagine some of the things that he is taking you through and look now this is not a physical change this is what we call a chain of circumstance right hey man can you imagine the same devil that had you bound now he's in bondage I'm telling you this I can't wait to see that 1,000 years I mean everything you gave me now fall back on you 1,000 years of bondage so you can see how it feels hey man thousand years of bondage look at this it says and cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up instead of fill up on him that he should deceive the nation's No More till the thousand years should be fulfilled after that he must be loosed a little season listen and I saw Thrones and they said upon them and judgment was given unto them and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus and for the word of God and which had not worshipped the Beast neither His image neither had received his mark upon their foreheads or in their hands and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years it goes on but the rest of the Dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection amen on such the second death hath no power but they shall be priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years and when the thousand years are expired Satan shall be loosed out of his prison and she'll go to deceive the nation's that were in the four quarters of the earth Gog and Magog to gather them together to battle a number of whom is as the sand of the sea and and they went up on the breadth of the earth and compassed the camp of the saints about and the beloved city he just won't stop trying hey man amen out here I can pass compassed the camp of the saints about end of love city and fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured them and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire oh I love that that same devil that try to destroy Moses by casting them in the river will find his hand in the lake of fire amen this is the end of Satan's Dominion right it said it's that say that and that and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are and shall be tormented day and night forever and ever now we know it's no such thing as the eternal health but there is a forever and forever we're gonna find the end of Satan's Dominion in this lake of fire he was trying to use water to destroy but he gonna be destroyed in the lake of fire god no how to turn things around let me just finish this by reading this last quote out of the revelation of Jesus Christ God know how to turn things around bless it be the name of the Lord so let me show you another reason why Satan hates this book of the revelation of Jesus Christ in the church he knows that Jesus Christ is yesterday today and forever and he changes not he knows that a whole lot more than do 90% of the theologians he knows that since God is immutable in his nature then he is just as immutable in his ways that Satan knows assuredly that the original church at Pentecost with the power of God marked 16 in action is to church that Jesus claims as its own all else is false it has to be now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the book of Revelation shows how the Antichrist spirit will come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm for men powerless it exposes Satan revealing his works attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's Word right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire I want to tell you something this gonna be a battle until he's cast into the lake of fire y'all ready to fight there's gonna be a battle listen he fights that he cannot stand it and he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she's danced for and that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the Christian Church and by God's Spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist spirit you understand that's what we're doing amen it's only two spirits that work what is the Spirit of God when it's the spirit of the devil and we got a list and the Antichrist spirit amen listen so what's an antichrist spirit Satan will be powerless before her he will be as definitely Florida today as when Christ was stood him withstood as every effort to gain power him in the desert yes Satan hates revelation but we love it we're true revelation in our lives ain't this something with true revelation in our lives the gates of Hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them now you know brother Rams brother Brandon brought out that scripture about the case of a ICC say it didn't say the gates of Hell wouldn't come against us but it did say it won't prevail and what they'll prevail means is to wrestle with and overcome hallelujah Church I'm telling I'm showing you the end of Satan's Dominion and I tell you you know when you look at you look at these things in Scripture and just just follow him right through the message with the prophet and everything here he was trying to white-white I'm sorry I got one more one more quote this is I've a seizure possess the gates of his enemy he was trying to white white Moses out white wipe all the kids out wipe em all out he tried to stop Moses he couldn't stop them he tried to stop Jesus couldn't stop him I mean you name them all he tried to stop the Hebrew boys couldn't stop them he tried to stop Daniel couldn't stop him right he tried to stop joash couldn't stop it Amen yeah I mean you just go right down Samson all I'm trying to stop them all and if they were not stopped Church we won't be stopped I believe that I believe that this is a quote out of that seat shop possess the gates of his enemy he says what are we afraid about he says the gates we have God's promise we have his word we have his holy spirit the angels are encamped about everything's in order every every wall can be took down it's already took down the son of God goes before us his banners are waving and there's nothing can stand in the way of a saint going to meet the promise of God death can't stop it the grave can't stop it the devil can't stop it we are more than conquerors snick is conquer for you friends depth is conquer for you unbelieva want to receive our habits has been conquered for you temptations been conquered you say I got a temper I can't get over its conquered he's already conquered it the great final seed of Abraham there's no more conquering to do now he conquer for us now we by His grace through his promise just believe in hold on that's all we do it's already finished our sickness our transgressions he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him with His stripes we were healed and I just love the way he said that death can't stop it the grave can't stop it the devil can't stop it this is we've seen the end of his Dominion and it's certainly coming to an end amen by the grace of Almighty God is it certainly yes thank God for victory Church thank God for victory man let's bow in a word of Prayer father God we just stepped whew Lord for your word and Lord just how your prophet just kind of brought these things to our attention when he preached the sermon that how the devil and just showing God how how he was always at work always trying to do something to Lord just destroy the seed anything that you set your heart on the devil was right there to try to destroy and against the question would be how do we know that you set your heart on it I think the answer is found in what we heard last week about Joe there was a discussion in heaven and that discussion you begin to ask and Lord just come you begin to speak with the the scripture say the sons of God which were the angels but as Satan was passing through you Aksum have you considered Jove a man my faithful servant have you considered him and so yeah but you got this big hedge and I guarantee if you take their heads from around them he'll curse you and oh god he told him you can do it but you gave him a boundary that he could not touch Joe's life and God if Satan had a boundary with job that he also has a boundary with us and there's nothing he can do no more than what you allow him to do so in the midst of whatever he's doing help us to keep our eyes on you to realize that he did not stop amen anyone in Scripture and if they were not defeated then we also will not be defeated thank you God in advance for the victory thank you God for the power to overcome thank you God that we have flipped the devil under our feet and Oh God we can see his M we can see it his hand is in that lake of fire God his his Dominion comes to an end right there God we can see it so help us to press through Amen the persevere to move forward God regardless amen and in spite of let it be our testimony that we have overcome by the blood of the Lamb amen and by the words of our testimony it's in the name of Jesus that we pray amen and amen can we give the Lord another hand of praise hallelujah traumatic current Madison you a conqueror may your victorious a man speed it in heavenly places with him help me sing it oh the kingdom of God is
