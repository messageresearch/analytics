Church Say Amen amen man I want to speak on a little subject tonight amen real pleasure to be having the opportunity to stand before you amen with standing the effects of a changing culture withstanding the effects of a changing culture look here and we're going to take our reading from the word here tonight on James 4. amen James the fourth chapter beginning at the first verse amen James the fourth chapter beginning at the first verse we'll read down down to the seventh verse amen I'm still here to say the wrestling of the Marbury trees amen I can hear the wrestling at a mulberry trees amen we still like to hear the rustler the mulberry trees as technology has got to throw a face now we don't even get a Russell little mulberry trees no more hey man but that's all right amen first verse from Once come Wars and fightings among you come they not hence even of your lusts that war in your members ye lust and have not he killed and desire to have and cannot obtain ye fight in war yet ye have not because ye ask not he asked and receive not because ye asked amiss that ye may consume it upon your lust he adulterers and adulteresses know ye not that the Friendship of the world is enmity with God whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God do you think that the scripture saith in vain the spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy but he giveth more grace wherefore he saith God resisteth the proud but giveth Grace unto the humble submit yourselves therefore to God and the devil will flee and resist the devil and he will flee from you amen now if we just go back here a little bit and just want to dissect this this little section of reading a little bit we've made amen the the the the lust here that he's he's speaking of is uh speaking up there in John 1 the second chapter the 16th verse where he says uh for all that is in the world the lust of the eye the lust of the Flesh and the pride of life is not of the father but of this world amen so he's he's talking about a fleshly lust but it's a lust amen for the things of the world that James here is mainly speaking of he says here that ye ask and received not because you ask amits sometimes we ask for things uh out of a lust to satisfy our own lust it's not that it's something that that we should have something that would do us good we ask because uh the Joneses may have one we ask out of a out of a worldly desire see I will our desire should be his will what is your fear what if it's anything that's going to take me further away from you or hinder me I don't want it amen see sometimes we ask amiss we have to make sure amen that our motive and objectives is Right amen so uh he goes on here and he talked about yeah adulterers adulteresses spiritual adulterer spiritual adulteresses ye know that friendship of the world is enmity to God now that word friendship is talking about Fellowship amen fellowship with the world now we're talking here that the title of this message is withstanding the changing culture see withstanding the effects of a changing culture we have to be able to recognize a man that some everything is not of God and because that we're here and culture is is is is is is is constantly changing amen that we have to be careful to to withstand the effects of it amen because see there's a fact all of these different um um um things that just the world may think it's okay the world may believe that world there's nothing wrong with this but we have to be able to recognize how it's affecting us amen uh uh uh he said enmity of the world now this word here world is talking about the Greek word a man the world Cosmos and in defining that we're talking about that it says the arrangement or the Constitution order government the system of man's order amen the headship of man without the need of God that's this world Cosmos that we live in we recognize that we live in this lady of CN age amen where Pete the way that where they are rich and have need of nothing amen they feel that they are are quite wise and and they don't need a God anymore amen there's no hunger we we got this we can do this for ourselves amen um that's this this the attitude of this lady you're seeing age here but and and and they come up with all kind of inventions and ideas and different things of that nature and these things sometimes affects us let me let me let me let um talk about this a little bit there's a thing called osmosis now much of the way that we conduct our everyday lives comes from a force of habit that was already been uh uh uh uh how should I say into us by representation it has been an influence from someone or someone in our lives or about our habitation around us amen now here the prophet in the message uh God being misunderstood uh section 20 if you get it says that's appreciated but if not that's okay he says he said Christian brother sister now most times when you find people that's got a stubborn spirits it's usually a complex that causes this either they have inherited it from a mother a father and Uncle an aunt or a grandmother or a grandfather somebody like that if you trace back down through your life you find now I've taken this by experience under discernment because I have had met cases on the platform thousands of those that had that spirit and the first thing you know I traced that Spirit right back by discernment and find that there was a granddaddy there was a grandmother there was somebody else back there that you inherited at from by Nature see it was your culture it was how you what you was raised up in amen that that allowed that Spirit of stubbornness a man to be pressed into you by what you saw around you the things that you experienced in your upbringing and in your everyday life but Church me must be able to withstand the effects of this culture amen it's it's it's it's sort of like this oh my if we were to another definition before I get ahead of myself let me talk about this osmosis osmosis is is a a the example is a a pressurized Submachine or submarine go down into the water amen and down it designed to go down in that water so it has to be pressurized to be able to withstand that atmosphere or the water will seep into it so what they have to do is they have to make sure that the pressure on the inside of the submarine is greater than the pressure on the outside amen so see that's the same thing here on us we are surrounded amen uh here uh by a changing culture we're surrounded here by things amen of this Kingdom but this is not our home amen we are not from here amen we have to uh be able to stand depression amen we have to have something down on the inside that is a greater pressure than the outside or what will happen is the outside forces would begin to seep in amen the prophet of God here uh he preached on this and he preached a message uh what was the message here countdown in the message countdown he says get in my brother's sister you must get pressurized the pressure won't hurt you when you get on the ends when you get it on the inside and get pressurized Christ and you won't care what the world says they can't never hit you anyhow you're safe you're tucked in amen see because you're pressurized Jesus Christ is our great and glorious astronaut to that we will be in he's the great and glorious astronaut too that will be in that will Propel Us by the Holy Ghost power and fire when she begins to fly out amen one of these mornings the Holy Ghost Fire hit the earth like that and when they do the church will be lifted up and all the nations will stand and they won't need a television they'll see him every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess as she propels her way into Yonder into the Glorious rim of Heaven to be married to her bridegroom but amen my brothers and sisters to go there you must be pressurized you must be pressurized in him amen amen so we see here that uh uh we the only way Amen to be pressurized amen is through Christ here now osmosis is is the the fact a man of of something being pressed into you amen that that that about this culture this lifestyle amen this lady you're seeing weighs and different things being pressed into you it's constant amen the prophet says here that he says much of our learning is done unconsciously amen it's not a conscious learning and this is how the osmosis and things of this of of this life is unconscious amen it's something that's that that takes place down in our subconscious realm we take on these things the gradual part takes the gradual part one part to another from a membrane but the same word osmosis is also used for the process which ideas and information are absorbed without conscious effort it is the way it is the way in which ideas and information gradually spread between people amen you pick up the ways and culture subconsciously just by being surrounded by it all the time amen amen the prophet said here in the uh the message future home with the Heavenly bridegroom the Earthly bride he said it's like a man crossing the sea the man goes across the sea the real man that's driving the ship he never sees where he's going he's down in the bowels of the ship he's the engineer the man setting up here in the deck he gives him orders from that man into the Crow's Nest so you have three men you have a man in the Crow's Nest you have a man on deck and you have the engineer down in in the bowels of the ship the man in the powers of the ship really drives the boat he gives it Power to Go amen he in order for uh uh the rudder the man on the deck turns the the wheel and it's a little Rudder in the back of the ship that turned but what really turns to ship is that engineer because he give this engine more power give this engine less power and and cause the ship to turn it's so the man in the Crow's Nest is basically the eyes he's look out and he see something ahead and he'll uh phone down to the guy on the deck um to tell the the guy on the deck uh uh or what's coming up and he'll say well whether we got to turn so many degrees this way or so many degrees that way and then he'll send the message down to the guy and engineer see so all of these things must be in harmony amen because if the guy on the deck tells the guy in the in the bows of the ship to do something and he does something different well you now you got chaos see now you got chaos so the the man in the bowels of the ship he can't just run them up amen but if if if if if if if if we're trying to keep the ship afloat we're trying to keep this thing from taking on water that is supposed to be on the outside amen because if something goes wrong and this thing begins to take on water what's going to happen there's a chance there that everyone could perish see we have to be able to amen how we withstand the effects of this culture that's on the outside see we're in a culture of water amen and we're in the ship and but we have a certain culture on the inside of the ship so we have to be in unity of the spirit amen to keep that culture on the outside of the ship or we would perish amen so we have to have that Unity of of of of of of of of information amen the the the mental must agree with the heart amen and the Heart must agree with the soul amen because see we're constantly going to get thoughts let me let you look at this real quick here I have here amen a article um it's by a lady named Kelly uh baladu that's the best I can uh her name there it's called managing intrusive thoughts now this is science this is a Harvard study disturbing thoughts that pop into your mind unbidden may make you feel uneasy but they are common and there are strategies strategies you can use to manage them thoughts now let me read some of this here it seems to come out of nowhere a strange disturbing thought or a troubling image that pops into your mind it might be violent or sexual or a reoccurring fear that you'll do something inappropriate or embarrassing whatever the content it's often unsettling it may and may bring on a feeling of worry or shame now I heard somewhere else that a thought if you think on a thought for more than 30 seconds it becomes a Feeling and once it becomes a feeling it's harder to get rid of the feeling than it is the thought amen so this is what James was talking about he said you must resist the devil and he will flee from you let's look at what the prophet said about it here amen in that same quote there God being misunderstood he said stubbornness is not of God and now the only way you get away from that is you have to have faith to overcome it you are a Christian you are a son or daughter of God whichever you may be and you'll never be able to stand and rebuke it and rebuke it and rebuke it just like a tantalizing a rattlesnake laying there ready to bite you why are you tantalizing this rattlesnake he says if you just ignore him and walk away from him he can't hurt you amen it's a thought the thought comes along why do you continue to worry about that thought and think on that thought and think on that thought and think on that thought cast that thing out and move on cast it down and move on don't even think about it anymore you get a pain the devil's gonna tell you oh it's this oh it's that cast that thought down right away and move on amen so when you feel that you got that stubborn Spirit lay that thing on the Altar and believe God that that thing is dead and you'll never have no more and go on and don't even pay attention to it anymore and that thing will leave you resist the devil and he will flee flee means he will run from you get away quick so that would be my advice on how to overcome from the prophet amen so we see amen that these thoughts let me go back to this article here oh these intrusive thoughts they'll bring on if you continue to think on them long enough it'll bring on a Feeling amen intrusive thoughts are these are called a thought to us our thought to affect some six million Americans according to the anxiety and depression Association of America now see that's another thing that it'll cause we know them as spirits amen it will you think on these things it can bring that feeling it can bring anxiety and depression sometimes intrusive thoughts are associated with mental disorders such as obsessive compulsive disorder where thoughts become so bothersome that they prompt repetitive behaviors or compulsions to try to prevent them see a lot of times it's the people a lot of people say I'm hearing voices these are the thoughts nothing but the devil these are the thoughts that keep coming to their mind and they and trying to get rid of them they'll do certain things they'll act out in certain ways trying to get rid of the thought but we know that's just being a a tormented by an evil spirit amen they are also common in post-traumatic stress disorder which can be triggered by a life-threatening or extremely stressful event such as an accident a violent attack but many people who experience these thoughts don't have mental disorders amen intrusive thoughts are often triggered by stress or anxiety they may also be short-term problems brought on by by biological factors such as the hormone ship a woman having a baby menopause a child reaching puberty amen a man going through what we call midlife crisis these things make a person hormonal shifts make a person vulnerable to these kind of things because you're at that point at a weaken State this is why we need a man to be pressurized amen pressurized to be able to withstand Amen to your cup the effects of this changing culture to recognize what it is Amen to recognize that uh I see exactly where you're at there but I see exactly what you're doing I rebuke you and I resist you in the name of Jesus Christ and move on amen don't accept that thing amen uh the prophet was talking here amen and um says now in the future home says now you think you've got faith and he says here the first thing you have to uh have is a base for faith that God's word well the man goes to school and learns theology he reads it said God said so yes I believe it he believes in here in his mind but it's got to be a subconscious also and that subconscious disagrees with this because when he starts to do it he's a little bit scared it won't happen amen so our we have to we we we we live in this world and and and and by what we see in the in in the culture that we live in but we must submerse ourselves in the cultures of the word so see everything of this world that man is being pressed Upon Us subconsciously so we must have to allow the word of God to be oppressed into us also subconsciously because it's gonna I don't have to think about sitting in this chair it's just a subconscious reaction I see I see the chair there I sit there and I sit down I don't have to Lord God I don't have to pray to sit down I just do it because I know it's going to be there I have faith that the chair is going to be there brother that's the points we got to get to amen it has to be something down on the inside that when somethings takes place amen and it strikes you that faith kicks in amen not no mental face but that subconscious face kicks in and says everything is going to be all right why because I have a promise and the Bible says so amen and I'm withstanding the effects of this culture amen so we we go on here Amen in the message expectation amen uh let me see here the prophet says uh now we're in the Holy Ghost age now you're sons of God now we're seated together in Heavenly places not we will be we are now this afternoon right here now Sons and Daughters of God seated together in Heavenly places with Christ Jesus see all things are possible when those little shackles and Dark Shadows get broke away then the Holy Spirit can come in and perform miracles amen he goes on to say that we don't have to wait amen until the Millennium we won't need it then amen we need those things now amen we don't need it then in the Millennium now is the time for for us to have a man Express a man who God is now is the time for us to have that Faith Amen to believe all of God's word I tell you what my brothers and sisters we're coming to a time where there's no longer just going to be words on paper there's going to be a real need for it amen they're talking about how now we have covert what's coming next amen they're talking about now in the next on coming years that all kind of things are going to be happening the world is afraid we see what's going on over in China and the different places and people are leaving everywhere our borders are are in a turmoil people trying to get in people are scared they're looking for somewhere to that's going to keep them somewhere that's going to give them some kind of shelter and protection from the oncoming storm because they sense it they sense that this thing is going to collapse this thing is going to fall apart so now what you have you have the Republicans fighting against the Democrats and you have this party fighting against that party that's what fighting against that well why everyone's afraid everyone's afraid because they don't know what's going to happen they don't know what to do amen but see we are something on the inside to able to withstand the effects of this changing culture amen the prophet was talking about how this this time here let me let me read what he said here and the lady you'll see in church age he said yes this boast of tremendous stories now let me read the whole thing here because this was just beautiful he said uh endure let's see here where I want to start at how strange in this age of plenty in this age of progress in this age of abundance How can there be trials the prophet here was talking about the word and this age that there will be wretched amen so he took that word wretchy say the Greek word which means to endure a trial and it has nothing to do with the trials that come come to a true Christian because because the Bible described these trials as blessed and his and isn't then his attitude is one of joy whereas the description in this phrase it is wretched and miserable describing this time that we're living in that these people are wretched and miserable amen and he says this word wretched in the Greek means to endure a trial they have trials coming amen I feel for those people in Buffalo amen who lost their lives just because of this snowstorm government couldn't save them these people they both know ambulance no fire truck nobody could come and dig them out who are you going to turn to I'm glad to know Jesus Church we're going to have to know Jesus in this hour we are living in perilous times all over the world is is corrupt there's no place I don't care everybody running to the United States looking for something little do they know this place told her both right now back in 1955. and it's just as corrupt as where you leaving but people are nervous people are scared amen they have to they're they're they're they're they're they're they're they're enduring this trial he says how strange in this in this age of plenty in this age of progress in this age of abundance How can there be trials he says well now it is strange put this age of plenty and age but this age of Plenty and opportunity when everyone has so much and there is so much more to be had that with all the inventions to do our work and with so many things to give us pleasure suddenly we find mental illness taking such a toll as to alarm the nation hey man we just we just described how that happens one way that happens amen but they don't know this kind of stuff when everybody ought to be happy they really nothing millions are taking sedatives at night pep pills in the morning rushing to the doctor entering institutions to try to drown out unknown fears by alcohol you see yes this age boasts of tremendous stars of worldly Goods but the people are less happy than ever this age boasts of spiritual attainments but the people are less sure of themselves than ever this world boasts of moral values and it is the most corrupt than any age since the flood it talks about its knowledge and science but it is fighting a losing battle in all fields the human mind and soul and spirit cannot comprehend or keep abreast with all the changes that has come upon the Earth in one generation we have gone all the way from a horse and buggy Amen to the Space Age we are proud boastful about it but inside is dark Ford Cavern that is crying out in torment without a known reason men's hearts are failing for fear and the world is so dark that this age could well be called the age of neurotics it boasts but it cannot back it up it cries for peace and there is no peace it cries for a great amplitude of things but it keeps burning with desire like an unsatisfied fire there is no peace saith God to the wicked the only way to have peace my brothers and sisters is have the peace Giver to have that person of peace amen and he'll bring that peace amen which passeth all understanding people just don't understand why aren't you worried about I I have uh people I try to talk to on my job I I get to a point I just can't talk to you because everything is I say y'all think Trump gonna be your savior and let me go on further neither it's Biden this thing is correct this thing is finished America has prophecy laying over her head it is over amen back when they took prayer out of schools man it's finished but you're leaning on you people are nervous and they they're looking for some Superman that's going to right the ship you had your Superman hey man but you we're gonna you're rejecting them amen he goes on to say that they are miserable by this word miserable foreign he says that means an object to be pitied see when you are talking with someone don't get angry and get into a back and forth with them they're miserable I pity you I have compassion pack for you I can't one of the things that the law of dealing with me you know I can't help a person unless I love them it goes on to talk about how can I I can't I can't um have an attitude God came and he died for whosoever will come now by four knowledge he knew who would come he knew who would receive his word but he came and died for whosoever will so if a person out there don't know him I can't be upset or angry with you that I can't I can't approach you with an attitude if I'm better than you I can't win you until I love you I can't preach to you until I love you see that's what the Bible is talking about hearing James he say he must have that same Spirit on the inside of you you must be pressurized you have to have that love for that person if I have that love for you back if I'm not going to argue back and forth with you I'm just gonna wait because obviously you're not ready to receive it if I keep pushing it all it's doing is making you angry so I I'll just wait I'll leave you alone I say God bless you we'll just agree to disagree and talk about something else because I don't want to make you I don't want to get you to a point to where you say something blasphemy against God see God that's not my objective my objectives would be is to be an agent of change in your life but I have to display love for you and just because you don't see it the way you don't see it right away I have to I have to handle you with kick gloves because you you you you're not where I'm at you don't have the strength and you don't have the fortitude this is new to you I understand that so I can't just force it down your throat I can't make you eat something you're unfamiliar with if a person or a baby I can't just uh I don't know [Music] I'm unfamiliar with that taste so they're going to give you rejection at the beginning they're going to give you a little pushback but see what you have to do is you have to let God open the door you have to kind of stay kind of carboniface just close enough to you a man to develop some kind of rapport with you amen and maybe through my life you might ask a question reminded of the Prophet was talking about his old friend now uh The Obedience fellow that uh wanted to kill the the mother though he did not go hunting with him because he was a cruel person you let's go hunting let's go but he knew that something is going to give me opportunity you're going to see something and I want to be there give me that opportunity to lead you to Christ now that's different from having fellowship with sin now you don't have fellowship with sin that's different you get away from that you flee from that especially because sometimes the spirit is greater than your spirit they'll pull you to their side but you would remain prayerful amen you you remember you remain open to the to the move of the god sensitive to his spirit you don't say that back and forth man I never y'all y'all get into this knock down argument now he mad you mad both of y'all in the wrong spirit can't you can't win nobody to guard that way the prophet says they're to be pitied they scorn pity they are full of pride they want what they have but with but what they have will not stand the test of time they have built upon quicksand rather than a rock of Revelation of God's word soon cometh the earthquake soon there will come the storms of the wrath of God in judgment then come sudden destruction and in spite of all their carnal preparation they will be still they will still be unprepared for what comes upon the Earth they have they are those who in spite of all their worldly efforts are actually opposing themselves and don't know it objects of pity are they indeed pity the poor people who are in this last day ecumenical move for they call it the move of God when it is of Satan pity those who do not know the curse of organizations pity those who have so many beautiful churches such as parsonages such grandly trained choirs such as show of wealth and such a a sedate and Reverend reverent form of worship pity those don't envy pity them amen the prophet in another uh area here if I can find it he talks about amen those people amen let's see if I can find it here amen the pity those amen ones a man who are miserable they're wretched and they're miserable oh my God I can't seem to find that section right now that sort of bounced all over the place here amen amen but anyway the prophet was was talking about how amen you can't amen make a person see you can't make that person seeing it says many come the father has to draw the father has a drum you can't make a person even our loved ones amen we pray for them and we and we want them to see this thing but we can't force it it has to be God it has to be him that does something so I said Lord I turn them over to you but you remain close enough Amen to be that Agent of Change Lord I'm standing at the post to do the waiting for my orders when to move just waiting for my orders but I'm staying close they move over here I'm staying close why that man keep following me I'm just waiting for something to strike you so that I can come in and be that Agent of Change hey man I'm not going to push you away I'm not going to run you off hey man I'm going to try to keep the right Spirit between us Amen in hopes that when that thing strike you you'll come back and say what you come back you're looking for somebody to answer some questions he said I know who I can go to I can go I can go to that neighbor across the street I can go to that that that that that person on my job because I know they hold up a standard amen they don't want to go to anybody amen when they're really in trouble hey man when when when when when when when there's a crisis oh no people know who to go to people know who to go to I need your prayers I need your prayers I need I mean I'm desperate but something has been troubling me amen I need I need answers Amen to be that Agent of Change amen my brothers and sisters we see that uh uh uh here the prophet was talking about how they that they're not able to uh uh keep up with the changes just he said that they went we went from the horse and buggy to the astronaut age amen the horse and buggy ages started in the late 1800s probably about 18 I believe it was 1887 somewhere along those lines the automobile age started in say 1927 19 something early the Early turn of the century and then from there from that time we went to Automobiles and then spaceship that movement was just so fast and then we look at how during that time different things came along how the fashion changed how just the general attitude of people we came through a different different movements uh we came through segregation and civil rights all of these things look good on paper oh we're getting better oh we're getting better oh we're all together now and oh we're free we're free we're free we free we can go and live in this community now I always said why do I want to live over there in that Community I left a community that was like that couldn't wait to get up out of there because they didn't want me there they did not want me there amen but you know it's it's sometimes we we have to oh my God not always want but the Joneses have called A Jones is a miserable because of that thing Lord I don't want to ask amiss I want to be in your will Lord move me I want to live where you want me to how where can I be most effective not just Satisfy My Flesh Oh see now I'm gonna be under pressure to have uh the high society over and they ain't going to want to you know we'll have their little wine and different things of that nature uh-uh and then in the hood you got to be careful with them too my neighbors know no that ain't what they about why because they see me they see me they see when I'm leaving they see the old that man over there going to church I see them they dressed up when he just got home from work they know when I get home work out the loudest truck in the neighborhood they know when I get home from work and they look outside they say man you but you got a phone booth in there then came my child up cleaned up dressed up suited up and I'm gone and he's still walking the dog foreign you just got home and I'm just leaving see we invited them over you know they had they had their little things over there and different things they play their music and different things

thirst again sit down and have a conversation with you invite you to church show you something different show you a culture that's going to pressurize you for the upcoming storm amen we have to be able to withstand the effects of this changing culture amen we see that a lot of things are coming in now we're in another uh uh uh age of information killing folks information why because people can't decipher good and bad information you have to take that thing through the filter of the word and if you don't if you don't take that information I I we get we all bombarded we see all bombarded with information and and we got this thing now Facebook Tick Tock in so many different different things like that and not just information information voices voices voices voices voices voices voices till it's hard to hear the voice of Lord hard to delineate what's true and what's not true until I feel for our young people because they're the ones being sucked into this most why because it is a part of their early culture it's a part of their early culture you know when I was coming up we didn't have things like this so I believe my pastor now they go back and fact check the pastor and don't and don't know how to do it and try to come tell him he wrong think they smarter ain't been through nothing see everything don't come through knowledge some things come by experience sometimes you learn things by experience say oh now I see what James was talking about because see I don't been through something see now and I could take I could take the scriptures and now they connect and it becomes real to me because I've been through it it's real ain't been through nothing but they can fact check the pastor everybody has a place see in this culture there is an order there is an order see there is an order in the worldly culture there is an order to it and if that order gets out of place you have chaos that's why we have it now people that you have the president and you have this uh uh uh Senate House of Representatives and all of that stuff now I'm not no sociology or whatever you call it Majors but there's an order to it and we see what this Society is all out of whack you know why because they don't have respect for the leader even if you don't agree with him respect the office and they finna have a civil war around here tout everything tell the whole thing eyebrow they talking about this democracy Burn It Down I had a man talked to me one time I was in the store he said it's gonna take bloodshed y'all said y'all blood item right I already had somebody shed his blood for me I'm good I ain't got ain't yeah I ain't got the shed no blood y'all go all the blood y'all want man let me go to church he folk crazy and stay close to Jesus they're thinking to come loose at the city boys gonna take Bloodshed they they mounting up yeah but you know them little bullets and guns y'all have ain't gonna do you no good when that atomic bomb hit this place you gonna be running around here trying to find somewhere to hide ain't gonna be nowhere to hide I'm talking real to you now he's coming it's coming why we have to withstand the effects of this culture because see we have to have the culture on the inside see the Bible declares that the kingdom of God is within us and have to have that culture we don't take on the culture of this world but we be transformed be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind amen this is not the culture this culture is going to fade away let me read one thing in closing amen amen here let me read this I think I missed it here he says now once this isn't a message Fellowship by Redemption now man once was made Even in our polluted condition that we are today man was made to serve God that his that was his full Duty here the great wise man Solomon and all the rest of them speaking in Ecclesiastes he said let's hear the conclusion of the matter fear and keep his Commandments for this is the full duty of man that's the full duty of man we wonder why we're uh running along here men women why we wear clothes and have to strive and the animals don't God feeds his little old birds and take care of everything else but we have to shift for ourselves it's because sin separated us from our maker that's what did it now man has been moving along you don't see the animals in bettering himself he can't embedded himself if he's any better treatment it's got to come from some other source he's he doesn't build himself a better house he doesn't make himself fry his meat where he used to eat it raw it has to be done because it has to be done because he there's nothing in him to give him a soul a animal doesn't have a soul but man has a soul and therefore the soul is part of God and even in its Fallen state yet it's the most greatest species of all species on the earth is the man and then get him connected back with his maker he becomes a Superman almost because he's the son of God he becomes acquainted with his maker the creator of all things and then when this man there acquainted with his maker becomes a part of his maker he becomes back into fellowship with his maker every Divine word becomes a living reality to him and he believes amen may the Lord add a blessing Amen to this word I hope amen that uh something was said Amen to strike your heart amen uh remember um that we have to be able to withstand the effects of this changing culture amen things are changing fast and we're here amen and there's pressure amen there's peer pressure even adults are under

from the beginning it wasn't like that but see the devil has got in and and changed our fashion changed our way of dress changed our attitudes changed so much and things like that and subconsciously because we're under that pressure we gain to take on some of that the only way not to take on that is to have a greater pressure on the inside so that thing can't seep in amen let us down to our feet
