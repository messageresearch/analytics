[9:42] go to games we didn't do all that we
[9:44] went to church
[9:48] we enjoyed ourselves in the church and
[9:50] I'm gonna tell you what made it special
[9:51] is when you saw all your brothers and
[9:53] sisters coming and even when we were
[9:55] younger we didn't have a big youth group
[9:57] we didn't have a huge youth group like
[10:00] not like some of the other churches that
[10:01] we fellowship with man they had big
[10:03] groups but one thing about our group is
[10:05] we was tight
[10:07] we were close
[10:09] right and uh I mean it might have been
[10:11] just a few families but man we we was
[10:14] the young people
[10:15] when we was a young people glory to God
[10:18] and and I can tell you something else
[10:20] about that youth group the majority of
[10:22] that youth group
[10:24] is still holding on
[10:28] [Music]
[10:30] but I but our past
[10:32] or for us where we could we could we
[10:34] could just grow closer to the Lord
[10:35] through things like that so in an after
[10:38] service we go out and fellowship and all
[10:40] that and you know we just we just
[10:41] enjoyed ourselves I I still remember we

[22:48] but now I
[22:54] as we welcome brother Quentin Jr to the
[22:57] pulpit
[22:59] I made
[23:01] [Music]
[23:07] foreign
[23:12] [Music]
[23:34] [Applause]
[23:37] [Music]
[23:51] amen amen
[23:53] [Music]
[24:07] oh a lot of musicians are playing
[24:09] softball that's about our heads for
[24:12] a word of prayer talk to our God
[24:15] Lord Jesus we come before you bow down
[24:18] oh god
[24:19] um on this Friday O Lord God you see
[24:21] your people have sacrificed their time
[24:23] while we were God to hear from you O
[24:26] Lord Jesus Christ so we ask O Lord that
[24:28] you take control of the atmosphere oh
[24:29] Lord God you anoint all of us O Lord God
[24:32] to to say and to receive O Lord God
[24:35] something that they can take into their
[24:37] hearts O Lord Jesus Christ and and give
[24:39] them Victory O Lord Jesus Christ oh Lord
[24:42] we ask O Lord that you're beautiful so
[24:44] Lord God and bless us all in the name of
[24:46] Jesus Christ amen
[24:49] amen all right thank you musicians
[24:53] all right God bless every single one of
[24:55] y'all
[24:57] um I want to get right into the message
[24:59] because I know it is a little late
[25:03] um if we could pull up the first slide
[25:08] that I have
[25:16] there we go there it is there it is all
[25:19] right so the message that I have for
[25:21] today is called uh
[25:23] key foundations for the young believer
[25:27] I wish I would have had some of these
[25:30] things growing up
[25:32] um
[25:33] I realized I was in a a difficult
[25:37] situation where my parents weren't
[25:39] together and we were between my my mom
[25:42] and my dad and uh my uh dad is there
[25:46] something wrong the noise the sound
[25:53] um
[25:55] but I was in the uh interesting position
[25:57] where I had a believing father uh and my
[26:01] mom was not in the message so going in
[26:04] between two households uh you get mixed
[26:07] messages and that's never good for a
[26:09] young kid you got to have some kind of
[26:11] foundation to that that'll keep you uh
[26:14] and keep you from making uh mistakes
[26:16] there we go and but I am thankful I will
[26:19] say this I am thankful for my mother for
[26:22] some of the decisions she made in my
[26:24] life uh because
[26:26] um I feel I still feel god
[26:30] um can touch people uh
[26:33] uh whether they're in the message or not
[26:35] in the message if you have a heart of
[26:37] reception God can touch you and they can
[26:39] make decisions that can benefit your
[26:41] child amen all right all right so this I
[26:46] have a little uh little work little uh
[26:48] thought right there that I want the
[26:49] young ones to kind of meditate on as I'm
[26:51] going through the message uh it is
[26:54] possible to be young and a Believer uh
[26:57] it's very very important to uh to have
[27:01] that Foundation because you're going to
[27:03] be challenged you're going to be uh it's
[27:06] going to be influences while you're
[27:08] going through school uh and it's going
[27:11] to challenge your faith uh but I want to
[27:13] reassure you that
[27:14] it has to come in order for God to get
[27:17] Glory because uh God is a champion but
[27:21] he needs an opponent and he needs to use
[27:23] somebody in order to show his word amen
[27:25] so I will we can turn to uh
[27:29] Luke Chapter 2
[27:32] uh we're going to read the verses 39
[27:35] through 52 but we'll just read 39
[27:37] through 40. and I'll let you be seated
[27:42] and you can also turn to the next slide
[27:45] um
[27:46] uh so we can look at these foundations
[27:48] so I want to I want I want us to take a
[27:50] look at these foundations as we're going
[27:53] through this journey of Luke 2 uh so you
[27:56] have resolve
[27:58] right you have a resolve you have
[28:00] attitude
[28:02] uh and then you have parents and this
[28:05] parents is going to be kind of wrapped
[28:06] into the attitude part
[28:09] um very very important
[28:12] alrighty so Luke 2. 39 through 40. so it
[28:18] says and when they had perform all
[28:20] things according to the law of the Lord
[28:22] they returned into Galilee to their own
[28:24] uh City Nazareth uh this is where Jesus
[28:28] was from him and his his parents and it
[28:31] says and the child grew and whacked
[28:33] strong in spirit filled with wisdom and
[28:36] the grace of God was upon him and you
[28:38] may take your seats um and it's it's
[28:41] it's really it's really good to look at
[28:43] this verse 40 where it says the child
[28:45] grew and whack strong in spirit right
[28:48] filled with wisdom and the grace of God
[28:51] was upon him so we had a change going on
[28:54] in the inside as a child right
[28:57] right
[28:58] uh and that's that that's very important
[29:00] so we're going to kind of go on this
[29:01] journey and read on and uh I was gonna
[29:04] uh I wanted to see little Joseph is he
[29:07] here
[29:08] he's coming okay yeah I wanted to have
[29:10] Joseph step up here because as we're
[29:12] reading through this this these uh Bible
[29:14] verses I kind of want to uh I won't have
[29:17] like I want to have a visual and brother
[29:19] Branham did the same kind of thing so
[29:21] we'll look at Josiah for now uh
[29:24] right
[29:26] as to see you know this was how this is
[29:30] around the age Jesus was during this
[29:32] time
[29:33] right
[29:34] um so it says now his parents went to
[29:36] Jerusalem every year the Feast of the
[29:38] Passover
[29:39] and when he was 12 years old they went
[29:41] up to Jerusalem after the custom of the
[29:43] feast so 12 years old and he was
[29:46] considered a child
[29:47] and when they have fulfilled the days as
[29:49] they returned the Child Jesus tarried
[29:52] behind in Jerusalem and Joseph and his
[29:54] mother knew not of it so Jesus as a
[29:57] child stayed behind and his parents went
[30:00] on his parents ain't know anything about
[30:02] it they know what he was doing but later
[30:03] we're going to find out what he stayed
[30:06] behind for right
[30:08] but they supposing him to have been in
[30:10] the company on a Day's Journey instead
[30:13] of traveling uh back home and they
[30:15] sought him among their kin spoke and
[30:17] acquaintances so they thought that he
[30:18] had went to go back home to family he
[30:21] went back to his acquaintances hanging
[30:22] with his friends or or anything like
[30:24] that and in 45 it says and when they
[30:27] found him not they turned back again to
[30:29] Jerusalem seeking him so a day journey
[30:31] in and now they're coming back
[30:33] and it came to pass that after three
[30:36] days they found him in the temple so he
[30:39] found his 12 year old boy in church
[30:41] right so that was a Day's Journey and a
[30:44] Day's Journey back three days almost a
[30:47] week and he's in church yeah
[30:50] as a 12 year old all right
[30:53] I used to think when I was a kid I was
[30:55] like you know how can are you mature
[30:58] enough to serve God is it is it cool to
[31:00] serve God isn't like and here is Jesus
[31:03] and and I could imagine how big
[31:06] Jerusalem was all right and this kid
[31:08] ain't go to the arcade he can go to the
[31:12] skate ring or nothing like that he went
[31:13] straight to church and stayed in church
[31:15] no parents
[31:18] no parents
[31:19] yeah so I want y'all to remember those
[31:22] uh remember those foundations uh what a
[31:24] resolve that you know what I'm going to
[31:27] church
[31:29] um so let's keep on reading and it and
[31:31] it came to pass that after three days
[31:32] they found him in the temple sitting in
[31:34] the midst of the doctors and I like that
[31:37] where it's sitting in the middle I
[31:39] remember we and uh my brother uh brother
[31:41] Troy who was setting up church and
[31:43] brother uh Troy was talking about going
[31:45] to the front of the church all right and
[31:48] here you have Jesus sitting in the midst
[31:50] of the doctors both hearing them and
[31:52] asking them questions right
[31:55] and all they heard him were astonished
[31:57] at his understanding and answers so Not
[31:59] only was he in church but he had a
[32:01] revelation about some things he wasn't
[32:04] just going there with his parents he
[32:05] wasn't going there because his parents
[32:07] convinced her nothing but he had a
[32:08] revelation of what it meant to be in
[32:10] church as a 12 year old right
[32:14] I feel ashamed like when I look back at
[32:18] my youth and like
[32:20] wasted time all right
[32:23] and when they saw him they were amazed
[32:26] and his mother said unto him son why has
[32:28] thou dealt with us Behold thy father and
[32:31] I sought these these Sovereign so you
[32:33] can imagine how his parents must have
[32:35] felt uh not seeing their kid for almost
[32:38] a week uh and having lost their kid and
[32:41] And the emotions going through and we're
[32:43] going to see later on uh how um Jesus
[32:47] handled those emotions uh when we read
[32:49] uh a section from the prophet
[32:53] but this is what Jesus said and he said
[32:55] unto them how is it that ye sought me
[32:59] um what a revelation uh we we don't go
[33:02] looking for Jesus Jesus comes looking
[33:05] for us
[33:06] all right uh what a revelation of
[33:08] knowing who he was
[33:11] amen right uh he said wish not that I
[33:14] must be about my father's business
[33:17] what a resolve that he knew why he was
[33:20] going to church not just to be there
[33:21] with his mother and father but he says I
[33:23] have a purpose he had a he was resolved
[33:27] to serve the Lord
[33:29] and the next statement we have here is
[33:32] um
[33:32] let's see and they understood not the
[33:34] saying what she spake unto them that's
[33:36] important right
[33:38] because it shows the reason for him
[33:41] being there ain't come from his parents
[33:44] they didn't come from his parents and I
[33:45] know a lot of us have grown up in church
[33:47] and when we come to church because we're
[33:49] coming with our parents and our parents
[33:51] we want us to you know get your clothes
[33:53] on I can't remember my dad having to
[33:55] force me to iron my pants and get up and
[33:58] get your breakfast it's time to go it's
[34:00] because there was a desire in him for me
[34:03] to go to church but not a Desiring me to
[34:06] want to go to church right and so here
[34:09] we have this this child our Lord and
[34:12] savior at 12 years old in church almost
[34:15] a week no one told him to do it there
[34:17] was a desire on the inside he was
[34:20] resolved to be in the house of the Lord
[34:22] not just to be there sitting but he
[34:25] wanted to be active in it
[34:27] amen
[34:30] and 51 it says and he went down with
[34:34] them and came to Nazareth and here's
[34:36] some more key statements here uh and was
[34:38] subject unto them
[34:40] right they were his parents uh so that
[34:43] we got a rap attitude in there right
[34:46] uh but and then the other key um the key
[34:50] Foundation I had up on there on the
[34:51] slide you don't have to turn to it was
[34:52] parents but look look at this part but
[34:55] his mother kept all these sayings in her
[34:57] heart she recognized there was something
[34:59] special
[35:00] man so she had a job to do and raising
[35:04] this kid all right so
[35:07] being a youth is not you can't do it on
[35:10] your own as a youth and God's depending
[35:13] on you as parents
[35:15] to be there for your kids
[35:18] amen all righty uh so we want to turn to
[35:21] the quote the identification of Christ
[35:23] in all ages
[35:25] um
[35:27] uh it is paragraph It's a
[35:30] 650409 paragraph 120 through 126.
[35:40] writing
[35:44] wait a minute for her to get to there
[35:51] I can start reading while she's yeah
[35:53] okay so 120 we're going to start we're
[35:56] going to start reading this so it says
[35:57] let's see what Jesus was when he come he
[36:00] was the word he was absolutely the word
[36:03] and the word is always corrective so I
[36:05] want you to I want to I want you to
[36:07] recognize that when Jesus told Mary this
[36:10] thing it was not a disrespect he wasn't
[36:13] trying to be mean to her he wasn't
[36:14] trying to embarrass in her but he was
[36:16] the word and the prophet says and the
[36:18] word is always corrective amen it
[36:21] corrects the error although the era
[36:23] don't believe it sometime but the word
[36:26] corrects the air so I can even imagine
[36:27] Jesus and just just for dramatization he
[36:31] sees his mother and he's like The Human
[36:34] Side is that's my mother but there was a
[36:36] word on the inside of him and said hey
[36:38] this is the word all right
[36:40] all right all right so it has to be
[36:41] something on the inside of you so let's
[36:44] let's continue reading so it says look
[36:46] at Jesus at just 12 years old a little
[36:48] boy about this about like this fellow
[36:50] sitting here asleep uh Josiah's not
[36:52] asleep so that's good with the braces on
[36:56] his legs Jesus was a little boy about 12
[36:58] years old no record where he ever went
[37:01] to school but they went up to the Feast
[37:03] of the Passover and when they or the
[37:05] Feast of Pentecost rather and they went
[37:08] up to the feast Joseph and Mary and all
[37:09] the congregation from down in the city
[37:11] they went to Jerusalem in a three days
[37:12] journey uh presuming he was around with
[37:15] the people some of his kin folk as we
[37:16] read but they missed him they went
[37:18] looking and he wasn't there they went
[37:20] back to Jerusalem and found him in the
[37:21] Temple and so the prophet says that not
[37:24] only uh he was in the temple he was
[37:26] disputing with the priests he was
[37:28] disputing with those men those men so he
[37:31] was he was in the temple uh correcting
[37:34] right he was in the temple defending the
[37:38] faith right they don't mean that you
[37:40] know you have some more some more uh
[37:43] Minister say something Jesus like no no
[37:45] it doesn't mean that
[37:47] uh brother Branham has said he was
[37:49] breaking up their denominations so this
[37:53] child had a resolution on the inside of
[37:55] him that my purpose is to see the word
[37:59] of God fulfilled and what y'all are
[38:01] doing ain't right
[38:03] at 12 years old right amen
[38:06] all right notice here not to hurt you
[38:09] Catholic people but you who take who who
[38:10] take Mary for a goddess or intercessor
[38:13] looky here
[38:14] she gave a testimony right so right so
[38:17] um so Jesus was not doing this uh like
[38:20] he was not doing this to be uh
[38:22] disrespectful attitude with his mother
[38:24] nothing she gave a testimony watch her
[38:26] watch her condemn her own testimony she
[38:29] said your father and I have sought you
[38:31] with tears right feelings look what she
[38:35] did she condemned her own testimony she
[38:37] caught she was calling Joseph his father
[38:39] but watch just a kid just a little boy
[38:43] and and this is what I was saying before
[38:45] as I can imagine Jesus just looking up
[38:47] at his mother and him seeing his mother
[38:49] and you know as a kid you give respect
[38:51] to your parents there's always some
[38:52] there always be something inside you
[38:53] that is like this is my parents so you
[38:55] should be careful about what you say
[38:57] right he said just a kid just a little
[38:59] boy but the word always corrects the air
[39:03] there was something inside him that said
[39:05] hold on this isn't right and he valued
[39:08] that word over his mother's feelings
[39:10] as a child
[39:13] what resolve said know you not that I
[39:15] must be about my father's business the
[39:18] word spontaneously see corrected the
[39:20] error
[39:21] she said your father and I Joseph and
[39:24] we're reading to 126 okay your father
[39:27] and I Joseph right before those priests
[39:29] who she had already told that she was
[39:31] conceived by the Holy Ghost and here she
[39:33] had testified and identified Joseph
[39:35] being his father condemning her own
[39:36] testimony so Jesus was actually there to
[39:39] help her to say hold on a second that
[39:41] wasn't your testimony that wasn't the
[39:43] faith God gave you
[39:46] amen your child can help you
[39:49] but watch the word pick it up he was the
[39:52] word in the beginning he was the word
[39:53] and the Word was with God and the Word
[39:55] was God and the Word was made flesh into
[39:57] other Among Us the word picked it up and
[39:58] corrected the error right and so we're
[40:01] going to finish reading uh this last
[40:03] verse
[40:05] um and we see through all of these
[40:07] things we see Jesus having resolve going
[40:10] to church wanting to be around God's
[40:12] people and stand for the truth uh uh and
[40:15] then and the Bible says that he went
[40:18] back to Jerusalem as was subject into
[40:19] his parents right and it says and Jesus
[40:22] increased in wisdom
[40:24] and stature and in favor with God and
[40:27] man
[40:28] and I know you young ones you know you
[40:31] want to have a future you want to have a
[40:32] career you want to have money you want
[40:33] to have goals uh
[40:36] but there's a path to get there
[40:41] right there's a path to get there uh and
[40:43] it says here that Jesus increased
[40:45] because of those things that he did
[40:48] all right so we're going to go to my
[40:50] next slide which should be uh the next
[40:55] slide let's see here
[40:58] um
[41:02] it's gonna uh it's gonna say conviction
[41:04] but that's that's incorrect
[41:09] yeah so the next slide basically I have
[41:11] a resolve
[41:13] and we want to look at the definition
[41:15] for this thing and the Oxford language
[41:17] it says resolve set is uh means decide
[41:20] firmly on a course of action
[41:23] or firm determination to do something
[41:27] Jesus as a child as a 12 year old kid
[41:30] was so determined to do the work of the
[41:32] father that he left his parents for
[41:34] almost a week ain't worried about what
[41:36] he was going to eat ain't worried about
[41:38] it taking a shower you know as some kids
[41:40] you know you expect your kid your mom
[41:42] and dad to fix you something to eat to
[41:43] get you ready get your clothes ready and
[41:45] all this thing he wasn't worried about
[41:46] none of that he was so resolved to go
[41:49] into the house of the Lord to fulfill
[41:50] the word of God uh and uh that that
[41:54] resolve is something that each one of us
[41:57] have to have and as you young ones are
[42:00] starting out you are blessed to be in a
[42:01] position where uh you can increase in
[42:05] wisdom and actually not having not have
[42:08] to deal with many problems as the older
[42:10] ones have had to deal with you are in a
[42:12] very very blessed position
[42:14] amen all right so
[42:18] um our resolve as we're going to stay on
[42:20] this one right here and now it says
[42:21] conviction but resolve is the word uh
[42:24] the foundation that we're going to touch
[42:25] upon right now so our resolve uh should
[42:28] be the same as Jesus he was an example
[42:31] from us all from birth to death from
[42:33] predestination to Restoration and if we
[42:36] follow that path we'll have the same
[42:38] exact results you don't have to do you
[42:40] don't have to think of anything you
[42:41] don't have to think of a new way you
[42:43] don't have to do anything new you just
[42:44] got to follow Jesus right and the result
[42:47] in the resolve of a young believer if we
[42:49] want to follow Jesus the resolve of a
[42:51] young believer should be to be about
[42:53] your father's business not your physical
[42:55] father but your heavenly father right
[42:57] that means you should want to be in
[42:59] church
[43:00] and if you don't like to be in church
[43:02] you need to pray to God Lord give me a
[43:05] desire to want to be in church
[43:07] all right because that's how Jesus was
[43:09] as a child
[43:11] right
[43:12] um
[43:13] you should have a desire to talk about
[43:15] the things of God uh Jesus as a 12 year
[43:18] old as a 12 year old child was talking
[43:21] talking to doctors people of High esteem
[43:24] and wasn't afraid right and that's also
[43:27] a challenge for us older ones uh we
[43:30] should want to the youth to talk to us
[43:32] about things a lot of times we can uh
[43:35] for uh we can brush them off you hear
[43:38] them you hear them say something and
[43:39] like they don't know what they're
[43:40] talking about
[43:41] be careful because that may be God right
[43:44] speaking
[43:46] through a child
[43:47] amen
[43:49] so you know we shouldn't we shouldn't
[43:51] say uh uh talking about God and I
[43:54] experienced these experiencing things as
[43:55] I was a youth about you know talking
[43:57] about God as born and my dad would try
[44:00] to get us to wake up um and do like
[44:03] devotions and you're tired and you know
[44:05] it's all boring to you uh but don't
[44:08] allow Satan to put that into your mind
[44:09] it's never boring to talk about your
[44:12] creator right because you didn't get
[44:14] here on your own and you're going to
[44:16] need him when you leave right
[44:19] all right yes
[44:22] amen all right so this Foundation cannot
[44:24] be stressed enough having a resolve and
[44:27] the thing about having a resolve is it's
[44:30] got to come from God it can't come from
[44:32] your family it can't come from your mom
[44:34] it can't come from your dad it can't
[44:36] come from your friend it can't come from
[44:38] the pastor it's got to come from God
[44:41] right uh and this is one of the
[44:44] foundations that a lot of Youth in
[44:46] church fall from uh you know when you're
[44:49] raised in church uh and and your parents
[44:51] are earnestly wanting you to see this
[44:53] truth right and a lot of uh you for uh
[44:56] will fall from this thing uh in their
[44:59] teenage years or in their adult years I
[45:01] can say that um I was one that fell or
[45:04] was in and out because of my situations
[45:06] and I'm sure a lot of uh other older
[45:09] Saints can uh say that they may have not
[45:11] stayed the course
[45:13] um but if we want if we turn to the next
[45:15] slide
[45:17] here and it says reasons why people uh
[45:21] but young believers will fall from their
[45:23] resolve
[45:25] you got peer pressure
[45:27] you've got knowledge and the reason I
[45:29] put knowledge here and I said or the
[45:31] increase in knowledge is because when
[45:33] you're young your knowledge will
[45:35] increase and it's a great blessing but
[45:38] it can be a great curse if you don't
[45:40] know how to use it
[45:42] amen
[45:43] and then we got the third one which is
[45:45] worldly fun and the reason I put worldly
[45:48] on there is because there's nothing
[45:49] wrong with having fun but it's got to be
[45:51] sanctified
[45:53] amen
[45:55] amen
[45:57] Hallelujah all right so let's we're
[46:00] going to tackle this first point uh peer
[46:02] pressure uh and peer pressure is so big
[46:05] now with all the social media even I
[46:08] didn't have this much social media
[46:09] growing up as a kid where you're you're
[46:12] seeing lives and you're seeing a
[46:15] projection of lives and stuff and it's
[46:17] enticing to want to be the same even
[46:19] from the Christian worlds you know you
[46:20] have a lot of these artists uh singing
[46:24] um and brother Jack had preached about
[46:26] it one time you have a lot of these
[46:27] Christian artists singing with tattoos
[46:30] and brother Branham called it like
[46:31] sensationalism
[46:34] not even worshiping God
[46:36] that's a scary thing to be in because
[46:38] you can see they're doing it with all
[46:39] their heart
[46:40] it's not like they're not wanting to
[46:42] worship God because it takes some sort
[46:44] of resolve and conviction uh to stand
[46:46] for God but you want a full resolve
[46:50] D not partial right
[46:52] all righty all right so
[46:55] um now we're going to uh let's let's
[46:56] attack this peer pressure uh and to
[46:59] battle peer pressure uh one of your
[47:01] resolves is you have to you have to ask
[47:03] yourself who do you want to be
[47:05] associated with who do you want in your
[47:07] circle right if you cherish your friends
[47:10] in the world uh you're gonna fall right
[47:13] you can't serve two Gods at the same
[47:15] time uh and the reason being is because
[47:19] um God wants to help you with every
[47:21] single step of your of your Christian
[47:23] walk not just your Christian walk but
[47:25] your spiritual walk and God wants to
[47:27] help you and give you strength but if
[47:28] you hold it on to two Gods God can't
[47:30] give you his full strength
[47:33] so there's going to be a fight and
[47:35] because he can't give you his full
[47:37] strength you don't know if you're going
[47:39] to come out
[47:40] amen
[47:43] right so you have to have a resolve to
[47:45] figure out where you want who you want
[47:47] to be associated with in your circle and
[47:49] if our example is Jesus when he was 12
[47:52] years old he wanted to be associated
[47:54] with the Saints in church that's where
[47:56] he went to when he was in the city when
[47:57] he got lost he didn't go hang out with
[47:59] friends his parents thought he was with
[48:01] family but he had a resolve that says no
[48:03] I want to be with the Saints in church
[48:06] as a 12 year old no peer pressure could
[48:09] come to him right right you have to have
[48:12] a firms you also have to have a Firm
[48:14] Stance on who you want to impress and
[48:17] look up to right so if you want to look
[48:19] up to people in the world if you want to
[48:21] look up to the worldly Idols uh you're
[48:23] going to have a hard time uh battling
[48:25] peer pressure trying to be a believer
[48:27] because God doesn't look up to those
[48:29] people all right amen
[48:31] amen and so uh uh and Jesus himself he
[48:34] looked up uh even though he went to
[48:37] church and he was uh battling those
[48:39] peoples uh people I believe he still had
[48:41] a respect uh because he was there right
[48:45] right and your resolve has to be about
[48:47] your father uh then you would want to be
[48:50] around his people it's a natural desire
[48:53] amen and that is one way to battle uh
[48:56] combat peer pressure because when you
[48:58] are resolved and you affirming your
[49:00] belief that I want to be about the
[49:02] father's business uh God will put the
[49:05] desire inside of you to want to be
[49:06] around his people until you wouldn't
[49:08] want to be around anybody else
[49:10] amen
[49:12] now all peer pressure isn't bad
[49:16] um it's just pressure but it depends on
[49:19] where that pressure is coming from uh
[49:21] Now esther uh we uh the pastor's been
[49:24] preaching about Esther and Esther is a
[49:26] good example of good peer pressure so
[49:29] she had just become Queen and here comes
[49:31] Mordecai pressuring her hey you got to
[49:35] take some action right
[49:37] and depending on how you look at that as
[49:41] a young believer you may you may receive
[49:43] pressure from your pastor you may
[49:45] receive pressure from you from your uh
[49:47] from your uh families in church your
[49:50] church family or your own family and you
[49:52] have to ask yourself why is the pressure
[49:54] coming so when Esther uh uh received
[49:58] that pressure from Mordecai the reason
[49:59] that Mordecai is pressuring her was to
[50:02] save God's people wow right so she was
[50:05] pressured accepted the pressure and in
[50:08] that she became a type of Christ
[50:10] yes so not all peer Pro all peer
[50:14] pressure is bad it just depends on what
[50:16] are they pressuring you to do and when
[50:18] you receive that pressure it's okay to
[50:20] question Bible says to try the spirit
[50:22] see if it be of God when you receiving
[50:24] pressure ask yourself what does the
[50:27] Bible say about this
[50:29] right if someone's pressuring you to
[50:31] drink what does the Bible say about
[50:32] drinking
[50:34] if someone's pressuring you to smoke
[50:35] what does the Bible say about these
[50:37] things and then your question is
[50:39] answered
[50:40] no more pressure you can ignore it amen
[50:45] oh yeah uh and even uh an example that I
[50:49] gave before with Jesus receiving
[50:51] pressure even from his mom when his mom
[50:53] his own mother uh was telling him uh hey
[50:57] me and your father we were worried about
[50:59] you uh the respect that he had from his
[51:01] mother but the word inside of him as the
[51:03] prophet said he was the word he had to
[51:05] say hold on a second that's not right
[51:07] right so you even press even the Press
[51:10] you received from your parents has got
[51:12] to be from God
[51:14] you got to make sure that it's from God
[51:15] and if it's not from God you can choose
[51:19] God and it's not no it's no longer an
[51:22] attitude or disrespect you're standing
[51:25] for God and God's Gonna Stand For You
[51:28] amen
[51:30] so let's uh let's turn to uh there's a
[51:33] um there's a quote in the message of uh
[51:36] respects
[51:38] 61 paragraph 65 to 68.
[51:43] let's pull this up
[51:46] all right I can just start reading it
[51:50] and then the prophet says
[51:52] strange after they had seen all those
[51:56] signs happen and then they come to the
[51:58] Red Sea and found out that the very God
[52:00] that it performed all those signs here
[52:02] at the Red Sea doubted God the very
[52:05] first thing that he was able to make a
[52:08] way of Escape he had showed them that he
[52:11] was able to make a wave Escape through
[52:13] this great Victory not only not only the
[52:16] victory at the Red Sea at the Red Sea
[52:18] but he also swallowed up uh the army of
[52:22] the Egyptians which was the most
[52:23] powerful Nation at that time as we can
[52:27] think of the United States or Russia
[52:29] that's how they viewed Egypt and they
[52:31] had seen this with their very own eyes
[52:34] now there's where we make our mistake I
[52:37] want a little sickness
[52:40] right they had seen this big thing but
[52:42] when a little sickness strikes us when a
[52:44] little disaster or a little trouble
[52:46] strikes somewhere in a way then we go
[52:48] Falling Away
[52:50] and here he says a young convert
[52:52] somebody will make fun of him say Well
[52:54] you ain't nothing but a Holy Roller no
[52:57] they don't say holy roller now today
[52:59] they don't say holy roller now today but
[53:01] it's not cool to be a Christian
[53:04] all right it's not cool to be a
[53:06] Christian
[53:07] and see the attitude of this other this
[53:09] of this believer well I hate to be
[53:11] called a Holy Roller you see you see
[53:14] there you are you get that doubt
[53:17] right so when you have a resolution that
[53:20] is giving you given to you by God when
[53:22] you believe that you can't make it
[53:24] you're doubting God
[53:27] you're doubting God that God can take
[53:29] you through the peer pressure
[53:31] you're doubting him that God Can Make A
[53:33] Way of Escape so that you can continue
[53:36] to stand Victorious and that's one thing
[53:39] that God doesn't like God doesn't like
[53:41] cowards because then it makes him look
[53:43] weak
[53:45] and he's not weak it's not in his
[53:47] character
[53:49] amen
[53:50] alrighty so let's um
[53:53] all right so and all right so now we
[53:56] have the next thing on here uh and
[53:59] that's peer pressure now we have the
[54:00] next thing which is knowledge or the
[54:02] increase in knowledge
[54:04] um and the prophet had described this as
[54:08] uh when you gain knowledge you're
[54:10] climbing up the tree of knowledge uh and
[54:13] all of us older ones know what the tree
[54:14] of knowledge is and who it is
[54:16] so you have to be careful when you're
[54:19] climbing up this tree you have to have
[54:21] spiritual guidance right when you're
[54:23] climbing up the tree because when you
[54:25] don't have spiritual guidance it's what
[54:27] we call a life gamble you're flipping a
[54:30] coin on the choices of your
[54:32] relationships of your job of your of the
[54:35] direction you want to take you're taking
[54:36] a life Gamble
[54:37] right all right so an example is
[54:41] um of a young one and only reason I say
[54:44] these things to y'all is because I did
[54:45] them too all right so I'm guilty of them
[54:48] too but an example we hear is uh that's
[54:51] how y'all got that's how y'all guys did
[54:52] it when you were young or it's different
[54:54] in our day right you're taking on
[54:57] knowledge and trying to uh uh um create
[55:01] a path uh now those statements are not
[55:04] they're not they're not all they're not
[55:06] all false right there's some truth to it
[55:08] all right but when you're climbing up
[55:10] the tree of knowledge and you're looking
[55:11] for truth as a Believer you don't want
[55:13] some truth some truth will still get you
[55:16] in trouble right
[55:17] you want all truth all Truth uh will
[55:21] have you have will leave you to a
[55:23] Victorious Life and even when you get in
[55:24] hard times like job you'll still come
[55:27] out on top better than you did before so
[55:29] you don't want some truth
[55:31] all right and that's why you need a
[55:33] spiritual guide to climb this tree uh
[55:36] and there's the Paradox in this thing uh
[55:39] when you're making decisions and using
[55:41] this knowledge that you're that you're
[55:42] gaining uh there's a paradox in that uh
[55:45] uh good and evil is so close
[55:48] the decision you're making is so close
[55:51] yet it's night and day
[55:53] uh you know if you would take for an
[55:56] example a coin let's say you uh you have
[55:58] a coin right uh and this coin had to say
[56:01] head represents good and Tails
[56:03] represents evil right and just one flip
[56:06] you can land on either side when it's
[56:08] you trying to use your knowledge and
[56:09] make decisions all right and uh the
[56:13] thing about the coin uh and it's amazing
[56:15] how God has designed things in our world
[56:18] is that in order to see one for one to
[56:21] fully see one side you gotta cover up
[56:23] the other one
[56:24] right
[56:26] so if you want God to make decisions for
[56:29] your life like a lot of Believers want
[56:31] to you have to cover up fully cover up
[56:34] the side uh God is not a god of in
[56:37] between amen he didn't design for a coin
[56:39] to be flipped in land
[56:41] on in between a decision no it's got to
[56:45] fall one way
[56:46] and if you want God to be your spiritual
[56:49] God as you're gaining knowledge and it
[56:51] increases it means you have to check
[56:53] back with him it what do you think about
[56:56] this Lord what do you think about this
[56:59] friend what do you think about this job
[57:01] what do you think about this church
[57:03] Lord I see that car what do you think
[57:05] about me getting that car a lot of times
[57:08] we make decisions from our head
[57:10] but God looks at the heart amen amen he
[57:13] ain't looking at just what you see and
[57:14] what your imaginations imaginations get
[57:16] you in trouble it's one of the reasons
[57:18] why the fall came amen but God is
[57:20] looking at your heart to see if you have
[57:23] this thing what's going to happen in the
[57:25] future right
[57:27] so to further illustrate this thing of
[57:30] this concept of uh you're flipping the
[57:33] coin you're making the decision and
[57:34] right or wrong are so close let's say
[57:36] God blesses a brother in the church uh
[57:39] what a mansion it gives them a Olympic
[57:42] pool big yard nice cars everything and
[57:45] God has blessed them and you usually can
[57:47] tell God has blessed someone when they
[57:49] give back right so now he's inviting all
[57:52] the people in church over to his house
[57:54] for a meetings or whatever and then as
[57:56] one brother comes up and he's just
[57:58] admiring right he's just admiring how
[58:00] God has blessed them and there's nothing
[58:02] wrong with admiring things right there's
[58:04] nothing wrong with admiring things uh
[58:06] then he comes over again and he's doing
[58:08] some more admiring and he's like you
[58:10] know I wish I wish I had that house
[58:12] comes back over again you know I wish I
[58:14] had that pool comes back over again I
[58:16] wish I had that long
[58:17] uh and now he's late home to his wife
[58:20] and this is just a story just to
[58:21] dramatize right now he's coming home
[58:24] late to his wife and his wife's like
[58:25] honey why why are you 10 minutes late
[58:27] from home you know she's going to know
[58:28] and he he's like you know just taking
[58:31] another route and what he's doing he's
[58:32] going by the brother's house
[58:34] so you see something's happening inside
[58:36] of his heart but he's in his head yeah
[58:39] and he's looking at this brother's house
[58:40] he's like you know what I could take out
[58:42] a loan and get a house just like that
[58:44] brother
[58:46] amen so now he's using knowledge
[58:48] but he ain't consult God because if he
[58:51] would have turned to God God said you
[58:53] don't need none of that you got some
[58:54] Envy you're jealous of your brother
[58:57] wow right
[58:59] but in his mind he thinks he's making a
[59:01] good decision because he can take out a
[59:03] loan he can go and get this house I can
[59:05] get these things I can obtain these
[59:07] things but he's not looking at the
[59:08] decision from his heart
[59:10] right
[59:12] Let's uh another another uh important
[59:14] one uh sacrifice and compromise uh so
[59:19] what we just talked about was at
[59:21] admiring which is on one side of the
[59:23] coin uh in Envy which is on the other
[59:25] side of the coin and now we're going to
[59:28] look at sacrifice and compromise and
[59:30] let's say you have a sister in church
[59:32] and she's interested in a brother and
[59:34] she comes to her pastor hey interested
[59:36] in this guy right and pastor's asking
[59:39] some questions and like yeah what is
[59:40] what is this church situation well he
[59:42] goes to church on Sunday but he don't go
[59:43] on Wednesday and in a good pastor will
[59:46] be like
[59:47] um what's going on here is it is it uh a
[59:51] job is he working it's like no he just
[59:55] don't like to go to church on Wednesday
[59:57] all right uh and a good pastor a good
[1:00:01] spiritual guy will be like I don't know
[1:00:03] about that one right but in her mind
[1:00:06] she's in love
[1:00:07] and she's read online that sometimes you
[1:00:10] gotta sacrifice for things
[1:00:15] right online
[1:00:18] read online
[1:00:20] you see that knowledge is increasing for
[1:00:22] her to be able to go
[1:00:24] and try to make a decision on her own
[1:00:28] you got to be careful about that
[1:00:29] knowledge it'll challenge your resolve
[1:00:33] amen and so because she's in love right
[1:00:36] she's in love she thinks she's in love
[1:00:38] She's going to sacrifice uh not knowing
[1:00:41] uh that yeah it's true you sacrifice in
[1:00:44] relationships but there's a difference
[1:00:46] between sacrifice and compromise
[1:00:48] you don't compromise your beliefs for
[1:00:51] anybody right
[1:00:53] and if he if he needs any kind of
[1:00:55] sacrifice uh there was one provided on
[1:00:57] the cross two thousand years ago
[1:01:02] tell them brother tell the brother
[1:01:06] there's a sacrifice there and then he'll
[1:01:08] know exactly what you're talking about
[1:01:09] then he'll be worthy to be a husband all
[1:01:13] right but you see you have to be careful
[1:01:15] about those decisions that you make
[1:01:18] right because you'll be flipping a coin
[1:01:20] if she had listened to her pastor her
[1:01:22] spiritual God and of course the pastor a
[1:01:24] true God called Pastor is looking out
[1:01:27] for your best interests so the first
[1:01:29] thing he's going to do he's going to
[1:01:31] think about it and then he's going to go
[1:01:32] on his knees and God's gonna say hey on
[1:01:34] tell her that's not the one
[1:01:36] I've been trying to tell her tell her
[1:01:38] that's not the one
[1:01:41] and then it's up to you to listen
[1:01:44] amen it's up to you to listen
[1:01:48] amen
[1:01:50] so the next thing that we have here uh
[1:01:52] is worldly fun right uh and just to give
[1:01:56] some definitions of fun uh you have
[1:01:58] enjoyment Amusement light-hearted
[1:02:01] pleasure amusing entertaining enjoyable
[1:02:04] uh and then uh you have the world's
[1:02:06] definitions of parties drinking drugs uh
[1:02:10] romantic Affairs which is sin it's not
[1:02:13] fun that's why it's important to get
[1:02:15] your uh your definitions
[1:02:18] right lined up with the word amen it's
[1:02:21] important to get your emotions lined up
[1:02:23] with the word
[1:02:24] and I don't and I say this as a way to
[1:02:27] to not to frighten you or nothing like
[1:02:29] that because I made a lot I made some
[1:02:32] decisions I made choices where you're
[1:02:34] going to know you're going to parties
[1:02:35] and it's like what's the point of it uh
[1:02:38] there's no point in it
[1:02:39] all right
[1:02:41] um all right so and then you then you
[1:02:43] have what I call the tree and knowledge
[1:02:45] fund uh which is like going to a
[1:02:47] basketball game playing Uno uh treating
[1:02:51] knowledge fun or it ain't bad
[1:02:54] depending on
[1:02:56] what's in your heart right and I know
[1:03:00] um brother Jack had been preaching about
[1:03:01] this thing uh he has said there ain't
[1:03:03] gonna be no golf in heaven
[1:03:06] and I thought about that thing and it's
[1:03:08] like oh yeah it's true
[1:03:10] we have to get back to the original
[1:03:12] definition no I'm not saying playing Uno
[1:03:14] or basketball is a sin I'm not saying
[1:03:16] none of that is a sin is fine to do
[1:03:18] those things but what I want to do or
[1:03:20] what I want to place in your heart is
[1:03:22] what God's original definition of fun is
[1:03:25] because that's what's going to last all
[1:03:28] right so let's go to some Bible verses
[1:03:31] here we have Genesis uh chapter 2
[1:03:34] verse 8 through 15.
[1:03:38] all righty
[1:03:43] and I'll start reading while she pulls
[1:03:45] it up
[1:03:46] wait for everyone to get to there
[1:03:51] so we want to look for the definition of
[1:03:53] fun uh in God's word
[1:03:56] and it says here in the Lord God planted
[1:03:58] a garden Eastward in Eden and there he
[1:04:01] put the man whom he formed
[1:04:04] that's fun
[1:04:07] a garden
[1:04:08] [Laughter]
[1:04:10] God said it so it's fun
[1:04:13] amen it ain't say he planted a
[1:04:16] basketball court
[1:04:18] or anything like that a garden and there
[1:04:22] he put man who he formed
[1:04:24] let's keep on reading and out of the
[1:04:26] ground made the Lord God to grow every
[1:04:28] tree that is Pleasant in the sight and
[1:04:30] good for food the tree of life also in
[1:04:32] the midst of the garden and the tree of
[1:04:33] knowledge of Good and Evil and a river
[1:04:35] went out of eat into the water to water
[1:04:38] the garden and from then so his party
[1:04:39] became the four heads the the name of
[1:04:42] the first one is pyson uh there which
[1:04:44] encompassed the land of havilah where
[1:04:47] there is gold and the gold of that land
[1:04:50] is good you ain't got to buy it
[1:04:53] you don't gotta save up for it you don't
[1:04:55] gotta put it in a chain or anything like
[1:04:57] that it was there for you
[1:04:59] uh there is uh the Liam and the Onyx
[1:05:02] Stone and the name of the second river
[1:05:04] is gihon the same as that Compass of the
[1:05:07] whole land of Ethiopia so this is a
[1:05:09] pretty big Garden
[1:05:10] pretty big garden and the name of the
[1:05:13] third river is hideko that is which goes
[1:05:16] toward the east of Assyria and the
[1:05:18] fourth river is Euphrates and the Lord
[1:05:20] God took the man put him in the Garden
[1:05:22] of Eden to dress it and keep it that's
[1:05:26] fun
[1:05:27] that's what God's definitions are fun
[1:05:30] and and I'm not saying don't play
[1:05:33] basketball I ain't trying to turn it
[1:05:35] into a doctor nothing like that but the
[1:05:38] purpose of God is for restoration
[1:05:42] that means I was always a gardener
[1:05:45] I ain't I ain't like to play basketball
[1:05:47] I ain't used to like to play basketball
[1:05:49] I liked being in the garden
[1:05:51] amen
[1:05:53] [Laughter]
[1:05:55] alrighty and so we have a quote here
[1:05:57] just to kind of reiterate that uh in
[1:05:59] Revelations chapter uh it's a it's in
[1:06:02] Revelation chapter five number two
[1:06:05] uh paragraph 243
[1:06:08] alrighty now just
[1:06:11] start reading this watch she pulls it up
[1:06:13] um uh the prophet says but we have an
[1:06:16] Incorruptible inheritance
[1:06:19] meaning that it ain't going anywhere
[1:06:24] meaning that no one can take it away
[1:06:26] from us it's Everlasting and everlasting
[1:06:28] and everlasting and everlasting
[1:06:30] Everlasting all right that is salvation
[1:06:33] Redemption go back to the Garden of Eden
[1:06:37] go back that was our fun an
[1:06:40] Incorruptible fun
[1:06:42] think of it Lord think of it Lord who
[1:06:45] wouldn't want to go back to like Adam
[1:06:47] and Eve and live back there our food
[1:06:49] provided each day
[1:06:53] every single day
[1:06:55] a heavenly father and and think about
[1:06:57] this one a heavenly father always along
[1:07:00] the trail talking to us see that great
[1:07:03] light walking before us the lion and the
[1:07:06] Wolf feeding together Bullock eating his
[1:07:07] straw the lion eating with them and now
[1:07:10] they eat one another or the lions eat
[1:07:13] the Bullock and the wolves eat the eat
[1:07:14] the Bullock and just think about that
[1:07:16] and I know that you're that you're young
[1:07:18] and you're going to mature but as you
[1:07:20] begin to mature I want to place things
[1:07:21] in your heart so that you think about
[1:07:23] these things as you grow in your
[1:07:25] Christian walk so that they'll latch on
[1:07:27] uh you think about man these wolves out
[1:07:29] here and lions out here killing sheep
[1:07:31] and stuff like that while we playing
[1:07:33] basketball
[1:07:34] but in the beginning where there was no
[1:07:37] basketball
[1:07:38] uh they were having fun with each other
[1:07:40] right
[1:07:42] but them days it won't be that way the
[1:07:45] Beautiful the great beautiful birds
[1:07:47] flying there'll be no no sorrow there'll
[1:07:50] never be a marker that we passed over
[1:07:51] our hopes down along the trail there we
[1:07:53] see our children our loved ones oh God
[1:07:55] what a day what a day no matter what we
[1:07:58] receive here on Earth it's it's all
[1:07:59] going to fade away
[1:08:02] but that won't fade away
[1:08:05] so I just want to put it into your
[1:08:07] hearts uh uh the original definition of
[1:08:10] fun and there's nothing wrong with doing
[1:08:12] those things like playing you know and
[1:08:14] stuff like that but there is an original
[1:08:15] but those things uh uh it's almost
[1:08:18] insatiable or it's almost uh it's it's
[1:08:21] never it you got to come back and play
[1:08:23] you got to come back and play there's
[1:08:24] there's no uh um contentment or in it
[1:08:28] but man was in a garden
[1:08:30] planting trees
[1:08:32] and was content
[1:08:35] amen
[1:08:36] amen so the pressures uh
[1:08:39] so just to kind of go over these three
[1:08:41] uh points now the pressures you receive
[1:08:44] from your peers are going to challenge
[1:08:46] your resolve uh the knowledge you gain
[1:08:48] as you get older is going to challenge
[1:08:51] your result you can't trust yourself
[1:08:54] The Temptations of the world definition
[1:08:56] of fun are all going to challenge your
[1:08:58] resolve but thankfully we have an
[1:09:01] example in the Bible of Jesus Christ as
[1:09:04] a 12 year old overcoming that all so
[1:09:07] that we can have somewhere to point back
[1:09:10] to in our time of trouble when we're
[1:09:12] dealing with these things and say Lord
[1:09:14] here I'm standing you did it before now
[1:09:17] you have to do it again
[1:09:19] and uh there's one thing that God will
[1:09:22] always do he'll always come and back his
[1:09:23] word it's it's one of the things he
[1:09:25] always rushes to come do so you can
[1:09:27] trust trust God in that one
[1:09:30] all righty so we're gonna go to the next
[1:09:32] the next point
[1:09:34] uh in the next slide
[1:09:37] um so resolve uh is something that you
[1:09:40] have to get from God this has to be
[1:09:42] something you can't come from your
[1:09:44] parents can't come from your pastor this
[1:09:45] is all you that's all you you and your
[1:09:48] Revelation with God uh the next one here
[1:09:51] is your attitude right
[1:09:53] uh attitude is the one that needs a lot
[1:09:56] a lot of work even older folks I can I
[1:10:00] believe a lot of older people can say
[1:10:01] you know a lot of times we say oh kids
[1:10:04] man they just got all these attitudes
[1:10:06] man you get older you still have
[1:10:08] attitude it's still there
[1:10:11] learn to tackle it when you're young
[1:10:14] so when you're older you don't get
[1:10:16] yourself in trouble
[1:10:18] all right uh and so
[1:10:21] um I just want to get the definition of
[1:10:23] attitude and I like this definition of
[1:10:25] attitude that I found online
[1:10:27] um
[1:10:28] let me see uh right here it says a
[1:10:33] subtle way of thinking or feeling about
[1:10:36] someone or something typically one that
[1:10:39] is reflected in a person's Behavior so
[1:10:43] your attitude directly affects your
[1:10:45] actions right
[1:10:47] we can say attitude is a good indicator
[1:10:50] of where you're headed in life you can
[1:10:53] tell uh uh uh the path someone is on by
[1:10:57] their attitude about things uh one of
[1:10:59] the things about me is
[1:11:01] um and dad that'll tell you this my dad
[1:11:04] will tell you this when I was in church
[1:11:05] and didn't want to be in church you
[1:11:08] could see the attitude
[1:11:10] and you can see this Brothers ain't
[1:11:12] headed around a good direction
[1:11:14] but then when I gave my life to God now
[1:11:17] I'm singing and rejoicing in God you can
[1:11:19] see the attitude of the person and say
[1:11:20] oh wow I can see
[1:11:22] they headed in the right direction
[1:11:25] right so your attitude is a good
[1:11:27] indicator of where you're heading in
[1:11:29] life and and like I said when you follow
[1:11:32] these principles for God not only does
[1:11:35] it affect your spiritual life but it
[1:11:37] affects uh your physical life and you'll
[1:11:40] find yourself in positions where uh um
[1:11:43] you may be in a uh in a negative or in a
[1:11:46] down position but because of your
[1:11:48] attitude people are more willing to help
[1:11:50] you
[1:11:51] get ahead just because your attitude not
[1:11:54] because you're qualified not because of
[1:11:56] how smart you are uh but because of your
[1:11:59] attitude there's something on the inside
[1:12:01] of them that they reach out to and
[1:12:03] that's why I believe God your attitude
[1:12:06] in God I believe he he checks that thing
[1:12:08] that's one of the things he checks with
[1:12:10] his children
[1:12:12] all right so and what do I mean by
[1:12:14] attitude and there's two statements up
[1:12:16] here you have attitude towards
[1:12:18] instruction and guidance
[1:12:22] attitude towards instruction and
[1:12:24] guidance
[1:12:25] and in attitude and circumstances
[1:12:29] very very very important all right your
[1:12:32] attitude towards instruction and
[1:12:34] guidance uh the Bible says that we are
[1:12:37] Gods right and we've brother Jack has
[1:12:39] been preaching that thing uh it's
[1:12:42] important to make sure that you look at
[1:12:44] the the words though and it's a little G
[1:12:46] right there's a little G there for a
[1:12:48] reason right yes it's because that
[1:12:51] little G is a signification that we are
[1:12:53] in a position to receive instruction and
[1:12:57] guidance
[1:12:59] scripturally we were designed to receive
[1:13:02] instruction and guidance even though we
[1:13:04] are God hallelujah God now when you're
[1:13:07] Big G you don't need any instruction or
[1:13:09] guidance
[1:13:11] because you're above it before there was
[1:13:15] instruction and guidance God was
[1:13:18] amen amen amen amen so there's a
[1:13:20] hierarchy of order right there's a
[1:13:22] hierarchy of order uh and we have to go
[1:13:25] through that we have to go through this
[1:13:26] life uh um in it and that order is uh uh
[1:13:30] obedience and subjection
[1:13:32] all right uh it's not a bad thing
[1:13:35] I was talking with his brother today uh
[1:13:38] at the barbershop and he was saying uh
[1:13:41] uh in order to get the power of God you
[1:13:43] have to give up your will
[1:13:45] so obeying
[1:13:47] and following guidance and instruction
[1:13:49] is actually not weakness you actually
[1:13:52] receive strength
[1:13:54] you actually get strength
[1:13:56] uh to go through any situation that
[1:13:59] you're dealing with if you find yourself
[1:14:01] struggling with something ask what is my
[1:14:05] attitude what am I obeying am I obeying
[1:14:09] something am I not obeying something or
[1:14:11] I am not subject to something if you
[1:14:13] find yourself going from job to job
[1:14:15] losing job ask yourself if I'm not
[1:14:18] subjecting myself all right to my boss
[1:14:21] all right if you find yourself going
[1:14:23] from teacher to teacher to teacher you
[1:14:25] got to ask yourself am I not obeying
[1:14:27] something am I subjecting myself to
[1:14:29] something
[1:14:31] amen yeah uh and and and like I was
[1:14:35] saying God God doesn't want to rule over
[1:14:37] your life just for the fun of it just to
[1:14:40] pick on you just to show that he's God
[1:14:42] that's not the way God thinks that's how
[1:14:44] man tries to rule which is a false uh a
[1:14:48] false ruling false type of ruling right
[1:14:50] because it's for selfishness uh there's
[1:14:53] a purpose between behind God wanting you
[1:14:55] to subject yourself and
[1:14:58] um uh and to be and to be obedient and
[1:15:01] we can see it in the life of Jesus uh I
[1:15:03] believe a quote I think brother jackass
[1:15:05] said a quote uh where um or it was a
[1:15:08] message that I heard where uh brother
[1:15:10] Branham said that Jesus could have had a
[1:15:12] wife
[1:15:12] and he had a desire to have a wife and a
[1:15:15] family
[1:15:16] so he had this desire as a human being
[1:15:18] to want to have a wife to want to have
[1:15:21] someone to love to be in love
[1:15:24] and God wanted him to give that up
[1:15:27] and it was a hard thing for God to do
[1:15:29] because when it came to the time of the
[1:15:31] cross it said that when he prayed he he
[1:15:32] bled he wanted to live it was a sign
[1:15:35] that he wanted to live it's not always
[1:15:37] easy giving up your will but he gave up
[1:15:40] his will nonetheless not only did God
[1:15:43] get uh give him a bride he gave him a
[1:15:45] mini bride
[1:15:47] he gave him many the prophet said uh God
[1:15:51] God took him up in a vision and he went
[1:15:53] up into the heavens and he said is Paul
[1:15:55] here is Peter here he said yep he said I
[1:15:57] know I'll be here and uh there were
[1:16:00] Millions upon millions that said we're
[1:16:02] resting on that
[1:16:04] not only did God give my wife he gave
[1:16:06] him many a wife not only did God give
[1:16:08] him a family he gave him a big family
[1:16:10] because he laid his will down it's
[1:16:13] always a blessing to knowing your will
[1:16:15] down God wants to give you something
[1:16:17] better
[1:16:18] God
[1:16:19] Amen right and an any Godly parent will
[1:16:23] want to be the exact same and giving
[1:16:25] your uh on your child something better
[1:16:27] so I was wearing this shirt that says
[1:16:29] Rad a really awesome dad and a lot of
[1:16:32] people uh picking on me for that uh but
[1:16:34] I was telling them by faith I'm going to
[1:16:37] be a really awesome dad
[1:16:39] and I began to think about that thing
[1:16:40] because it's like you know what that's
[1:16:42] exactly how God was in in the beginning
[1:16:45] or before the foundation of the world
[1:16:48] before anything uh God had a desire to
[1:16:51] be a father
[1:16:52] not only did he have a desire to be a
[1:16:54] father he said I'm going to be a good
[1:16:55] father I'm going to be a great father to
[1:16:58] my kids I'm going to take care of them
[1:17:00] and uh and it's a type of us right
[1:17:03] because my kids are in me
[1:17:06] right now
[1:17:07] right my kid or if she's a daughter if
[1:17:10] she if she's my son his strength is
[1:17:12] inside of me if he's a smart kid or if
[1:17:14] she's a musician right if she's a
[1:17:17] musician she's already inside of me
[1:17:19] right uh not only that but her attitude
[1:17:21] is inside of me uh her downfalls inside
[1:17:24] of me
[1:17:25] and she's still my child
[1:17:27] [Music]
[1:17:31] it don't matter about the negative she's
[1:17:32] still my child so as a parent uh
[1:17:36] sometimes uh you don't you don't ever
[1:17:38] look and a lot of parents fail this and
[1:17:40] I know I'm out of place in saying this
[1:17:41] because I don't have a kid but a lot of
[1:17:45] parents do fail because I do watch
[1:17:46] videos about you got this thing called
[1:17:49] free-range parents or just let their
[1:17:51] kids do anything and it just don't sit
[1:17:54] well with me right uh because a lot of
[1:17:57] times you have to not want to be your
[1:18:00] friend be a friend to your kid
[1:18:03] because they're your child uh there's
[1:18:05] more love in being a child because the
[1:18:08] Bible says uh we were born in sin
[1:18:11] shaping iniquity come to the world
[1:18:13] speaking lies the prophet said we were
[1:18:15] an enemy of God not a friend but we were
[1:18:18] still a child
[1:18:21] still a child so sometimes you can't be
[1:18:23] a friend of your to your kid you got to
[1:18:26] be a father which means you got to love
[1:18:28] them through whatever they're dealing
[1:18:30] with to whether do the rough times the
[1:18:32] bad times the attitudes you gotta love
[1:18:34] them through it gotta love them through
[1:18:36] it to show uh God's love right all right
[1:18:39] so let's turn to Ephesians it's a lot of
[1:18:42] Bible verses but it's good
[1:18:45] go to Ephesians 6 1.
[1:18:48] I'll be closing in a little
[1:18:55] Fusion six all right we're going to read
[1:18:57] from verses one to four to kind of go
[1:19:00] over what we just what I just spoke
[1:19:02] about so children obey your parents in
[1:19:04] the Lord for this is right
[1:19:07] honor thy father and mother which is the
[1:19:10] first commandment with promise a
[1:19:13] commandment with promise we talked about
[1:19:15] paying tithes and how God would bless
[1:19:17] you and rebuke the Devourer this
[1:19:20] commandment over here of honoring thy
[1:19:21] father and mother comes with the promise
[1:19:23] as well
[1:19:24] that promise is that it may be well with
[1:19:27] the
[1:19:28] and thou mayest live long on the earth I
[1:19:33] was meditating about this thing and uh
[1:19:34] the prophet has said something so
[1:19:36] profound he said outside of Salvation
[1:19:39] the greatest thing that you could get uh
[1:19:41] is a wife or a husband
[1:19:44] and not to start a Doctrine or anything
[1:19:45] like that but I would say if there's
[1:19:47] anything greater outside of a wife it's
[1:19:50] to honor your father and mother because
[1:19:52] this promise that you have is directly
[1:19:55] tied to life and Earth and the natural
[1:19:59] types of spiritual so there's an eternal
[1:20:01] life and then there's a physical life
[1:20:04] and This Promise is Type To Life
[1:20:07] and it's one where it's very very
[1:20:10] important because what I feel what I
[1:20:12] believe is as children obey your parents
[1:20:14] it says parents in the Lord
[1:20:18] so parents you got to be in the Lord all
[1:20:20] right
[1:20:21] don't make it hard
[1:20:23] right
[1:20:24] don't make it hard all right
[1:20:27] but it's what it says children obey your
[1:20:30] parents in the Lord here God is typing
[1:20:33] your parents to God
[1:20:36] because if it's in the Lord It's of God
[1:20:38] and it was always of God
[1:20:40] so and there's a Bible verse that says
[1:20:43] uh how can you love your brother how can
[1:20:45] you God say how can you love me who
[1:20:48] you've not seen and not love your
[1:20:50] brother
[1:20:51] who you have seen so how can you say you
[1:20:53] love God and you respect God and you
[1:20:55] honor God and you don't honor your
[1:20:57] father and your mother
[1:21:00] it's a type
[1:21:02] right it's a type uh and you have to be
[1:21:05] careful uh uh about your attitudes
[1:21:08] towards types uh uh systemita
[1:21:12] um there was an issue of uh they were
[1:21:15] having with I think little Joseph where
[1:21:16] he had did something wrong and systemita
[1:21:19] brother Branham came home and she was
[1:21:21] like Bill tear him up tear him up and
[1:21:24] the prophet of being the kind of man
[1:21:26] that he was was like don't nah don't
[1:21:28] just leave him alone he done beat
[1:21:30] himself up he beat himself up he's
[1:21:31] crying right now he doesn't beat himself
[1:21:33] up he don't need nothing else and she
[1:21:35] got all upset at him and had an attitude
[1:21:37] so this is for old people too
[1:21:40] and God saw the attitude and said hold
[1:21:43] on a second
[1:21:43] there's a there's a type here
[1:21:46] and you gotta respect it you can't say
[1:21:48] you love God and disrespect his type
[1:21:52] you can't say you love God and
[1:21:53] disrespect his types uh in fact people
[1:21:56] receive
[1:21:58] eternal life by the respect of God's
[1:22:00] type the Bible said if you give one of
[1:22:03] these little ones a drink of water
[1:22:05] I save you uh and it's they didn't know
[1:22:08] who it was but because it was a type
[1:22:11] that type had a promise to it
[1:22:14] amen
[1:22:15] all right
[1:22:17] um you know so you got to be careful
[1:22:19] about uh uh your attitude towards types
[1:22:21] and your parents is a type your pastor
[1:22:23] is also a type A a type of God as the
[1:22:27] head of the church right so you have to
[1:22:29] be careful about your attitude towards
[1:22:31] your pastor all right uh uh there were
[1:22:34] two people that had a um and it looks
[1:22:36] like there's always family problems
[1:22:37] because uh the prophet uh
[1:22:40] Jesus said a prophet is not respected in
[1:22:42] his own uh town and then you had another
[1:22:45] Prophet who has some more family members
[1:22:47] and they were accusing them of who he
[1:22:49] married and stuff like that and God told
[1:22:51] them he said tell Marion Aaron to come
[1:22:53] to my tent and he said hey I talked to
[1:22:55] Moses from mouth to ear
[1:22:58] right any and he punished them because
[1:23:01] of their attitude towards Moses they
[1:23:03] thought they were looking at just their
[1:23:05] brother
[1:23:07] right they thought they were just
[1:23:08] looking at their brother amen and a lot
[1:23:10] of times even me even me now a lot of
[1:23:13] times we think we're just looking at our
[1:23:14] parents
[1:23:15] right but if it's in the Lord
[1:23:18] it's a god there's God hid in the vessel
[1:23:22] and you disrespect The Vessel you're
[1:23:24] disrespecting God you got to be careful
[1:23:26] you have to be careful um
[1:23:29] just to get kind of give another example
[1:23:32] of uh your attitude uh towards
[1:23:34] instruction guidance and like I said
[1:23:36] none of this is just to punish you or or
[1:23:38] to tell you it's to bring you down it's
[1:23:42] to bless you right
[1:23:43] um a parent in the Lord is going to
[1:23:47] ensure the success for your life
[1:23:49] they'll ensure the success for your life
[1:23:51] they're they were put there as a guide
[1:23:53] and God gave them that commission uh
[1:23:56] when he fills them with the spirit to be
[1:23:57] a good parent because that's who he is
[1:23:59] right
[1:24:01] so and I wanted to kind of give an
[1:24:03] example illustrate this thing
[1:24:05] um you know
[1:24:06] um
[1:24:07] I remember I had this girlfriend that I
[1:24:09] had when I was young and you know and I
[1:24:13] thought I was just so in love with her
[1:24:14] right and I was believing the message
[1:24:17] and everything and I told my dad about
[1:24:19] it and my dad just ain't have no
[1:24:21] reaction and I knew he didn't approve of
[1:24:25] it and that made me upset
[1:24:29] that made me upset
[1:24:31] uh but what I did not see was the god
[1:24:34] behind him
[1:24:36] and what God was looking at
[1:24:38] amen and so a lot of times you can be
[1:24:40] arguing with your parents your parents
[1:24:41] tells you say hey don't be some guy
[1:24:44] flirting with your uh flirting with one
[1:24:46] of the one of our young sisters your
[1:24:47] parents like hey don't hang around him
[1:24:49] don't hang around him and you have an
[1:24:51] argument uh and you think that you're uh
[1:24:54] arguing with your parents uh but the
[1:24:56] Bible says uh we don't wrestle with
[1:24:58] flesh and blood but with spiritual
[1:25:00] wickedness so you got to be careful
[1:25:02] about your attitude and your arguments
[1:25:04] at where they're being directed because
[1:25:06] it could be a spiritual battle that
[1:25:08] you're having on the inside and you got
[1:25:10] to redirect that attitude
[1:25:12] right amen I would and I want to give a
[1:25:16] a a testimony about my mom
[1:25:19] um even though she wasn't fully in the
[1:25:22] message uh she loves God and I can say
[1:25:26] um
[1:25:27] as uh growing up she was strict I mean
[1:25:31] she was strict we used to live in this
[1:25:34] uh neighborhood which was really really
[1:25:36] bad neighborhood and I was hanging out
[1:25:39] with a friend next door and my mom had
[1:25:41] no issue with it as soon as she found
[1:25:43] out that he was uh dealing with drugs
[1:25:45] she ain't let me hang out with him no
[1:25:46] more
[1:25:47] and you get upset you know you're a kid
[1:25:49] you get upset and it got to the point
[1:25:51] where she ain't let us go outside
[1:25:52] anymore and you just feel like you just
[1:25:55] stuck in this house and you're just
[1:25:58] doing the same things over and over and
[1:25:59] over again uh not knowing that it's
[1:26:02] protection
[1:26:05] not knowing that it's protection
[1:26:08] because you don't understand something
[1:26:09] so when you try to climb that tree of
[1:26:11] knowledge it'll fool you in thinking
[1:26:13] that you're okay
[1:26:15] and so my mom continued that she ain't
[1:26:17] really let us go outside she ain't let
[1:26:19] me go to parties uh and as all and I was
[1:26:23] so ready to get out of the house so
[1:26:25] ready to get out of the house uh but I
[1:26:27] can stand and say now and I tell her
[1:26:29] this all the time I'm like Mom thank you
[1:26:31] when I see people uh that I grew up with
[1:26:35] and the situations that they're in and
[1:26:37] the relationships that they're in uh uh
[1:26:40] not good relationships I can look back
[1:26:43] and say Mom thank you thank you for that
[1:26:47] thank you for that
[1:26:50] amen
[1:26:52] my mom my mom had had enough of God in
[1:26:56] her heart
[1:26:57] to project that kind of love
[1:26:59] right
[1:27:01] so we want to also continue reading uh
[1:27:05] this fourth verse I'll just go ahead and
[1:27:06] read this uh in Ephesians 1 6 1 4 and
[1:27:09] it's any fathers provoke not your
[1:27:12] children
[1:27:13] to Wrath
[1:27:16] but bring them up in a nurture an
[1:27:19] admonition of the Lord I just had to say
[1:27:21] that one
[1:27:22] I just had to say that one because
[1:27:24] [Laughter]
[1:27:29] I want the youth to know I'm not on any
[1:27:30] sides
[1:27:32] I feel like I'm in a good position I'm
[1:27:35] 31 years old I've been under subjection
[1:27:37] of parents and I don't have children yet
[1:27:41] because I feel like you know when you're
[1:27:43] a chill your child your team you tend to
[1:27:46] lean toward that direction and when
[1:27:48] you're a parent you tend to lean towards
[1:27:50] that direction but there's a balance in
[1:27:52] these things and that's why we have to
[1:27:54] read the word and let God come through
[1:27:57] and make the decisions right so you
[1:27:59] don't want to provoke your child to
[1:28:01] wrath uh uh it says but to bring them up
[1:28:04] and nurture and admonition of the Lord
[1:28:07] and we want to just look up those
[1:28:08] definitions of nurture real quick uh
[1:28:11] uh and nurture I just have it on here uh
[1:28:14] and nurture means uh care for and
[1:28:18] encourage the growth or development of
[1:28:21] um that one's very very important and
[1:28:24] it's and I'm glad I bought that shirt
[1:28:26] and I was just thinking in my head by
[1:28:28] faith I'm gonna have a kid uh and it's a
[1:28:30] challenge for me right uh because before
[1:28:34] and for some of you that are married and
[1:28:36] not have kids yet or you have baby kids
[1:28:38] this one will be really good for you
[1:28:39] when you think about God having his own
[1:28:42] kids he didn't just pop them out
[1:28:46] first he spoke light and then he had to
[1:28:49] wait
[1:28:50] and he had to wait and he had to wait
[1:28:52] and he had to wait but in his whole mind
[1:28:54] and his weight and he's like I got kids
[1:28:56] coming
[1:28:57] I got kids coming
[1:28:59] I got kids coming I don't know maybe I
[1:29:01] gotta develop some patience
[1:29:03] because I see them going through a red
[1:29:05] sea and they're going to be complaining
[1:29:06] I'm gonna need it
[1:29:08] so just all right cut him off
[1:29:11] hey man
[1:29:13] right and the next thing you know he
[1:29:15] created a earth
[1:29:16] he created animals he provided food the
[1:29:19] Bible says they ate the prophet said
[1:29:21] they ate daily right he had gold
[1:29:25] for his kids all right so he had things
[1:29:28] for them uh he prepared these things
[1:29:30] before they came
[1:29:33] before they came
[1:29:34] right so I feel as a parent uh in order
[1:29:37] for you to uh to care for or nurture
[1:29:40] someone you got to be prepared to do it
[1:29:42] or it's going to be a struggle
[1:29:45] right
[1:29:46] so for the ones that just have kids or
[1:29:50] you don't have kids and you're waiting
[1:29:52] be patient and prepare yourself for when
[1:29:54] they come
[1:29:56] right because uh it's and it's good to
[1:30:00] look at things from a scriptural
[1:30:01] standpoint and from God's eyes uh
[1:30:03] because as we see in the life of Jesus
[1:30:06] uh and I believe even Mary kind of took
[1:30:08] is that she took that to his heart when
[1:30:10] he said that thing to recognize that
[1:30:13] wasn't her property
[1:30:15] that child wasn't her property it was
[1:30:17] God's Property and so she had a role in
[1:30:21] raising it up the Bible said he was
[1:30:23] subject unto them and Jesus being the
[1:30:25] word you knew they had to be Godly
[1:30:27] Parents because the word can only be
[1:30:29] subject to the word not just any kind of
[1:30:32] parents
[1:30:33] they had to be Godly Parents
[1:30:36] and he was subject onto them and look at
[1:30:38] the success in his life
[1:30:40] amen
[1:30:42] all right and so the next point the last
[1:30:44] one before closing uh is your attitude
[1:30:46] and circumstances uh this one is very
[1:30:49] very uh very very important
[1:30:53] um I just give a little example of
[1:30:56] before I close
[1:30:57] um
[1:30:58] I know some people have been in this
[1:31:00] situation where uh and not everyone is
[1:31:03] blessed to have Godly Parents uh some
[1:31:05] youth on the internet uh you may be in a
[1:31:08] position where you're believing and your
[1:31:10] parents are not believing uh but I would
[1:31:12] encourage you to have a good attitude in
[1:31:14] those circumstances
[1:31:16] um I it's it it's good intentions you
[1:31:20] can't have a bad attitude and good
[1:31:22] intentions uh a good intention a bad
[1:31:26] attitude tends to spoil those good
[1:31:28] intentions and so I you know I would I
[1:31:30] would think you know about my mom
[1:31:32] growing up and you know you make
[1:31:34] mistakes and a lot of Youth out here uh
[1:31:37] older youth may may say this thing where
[1:31:39] you think you know you know what I'm
[1:31:40] gonna do that better than what my mom
[1:31:42] did it's not a good attitude to have uh
[1:31:45] the right attitude to have the correct
[1:31:47] attitude to have is you know she's
[1:31:48] trying her best you know I'm going to
[1:31:50] love her anyways I may not agree with
[1:31:52] this thing what that does is it builds
[1:31:55] character and character inside of you to
[1:31:57] be able to use it later
[1:31:59] but if you have an attitude and you
[1:32:01] don't build nothing and all sudden your
[1:32:03] kids come along you don't have nothing
[1:32:05] to give them and you'll be the same
[1:32:07] exact way and that's why you have these
[1:32:09] Cycles repeat repeat repeat repeat
[1:32:12] and then it's just a child I'm gonna be
[1:32:14] better than you bad attitude the child
[1:32:16] comes out I'm gonna be better than you
[1:32:18] bad attitude and it takes God to come in
[1:32:20] and say hold on a second let's check
[1:32:22] this attitude right love them regardless
[1:32:25] so that you're building something for
[1:32:27] yourself
[1:32:28] so that is that that is a very very very
[1:32:31] very important point
[1:32:33] alrighty and I want to um
[1:32:36] in closing I want to pull up uh yeah
[1:32:40] it's getting late
[1:32:41] um
[1:32:42] in closing I want to pull up a
[1:32:47] uh it's a a quote from water from the
[1:32:51] rock right
[1:32:53] um uh 55 uh and it's I think paragraph I
[1:32:57] think I wrote 143.
[1:33:01] 143 to 145. uh and this is for you this
[1:33:06] is really this is a youth meeting this
[1:33:08] is for the Youth I want you to be
[1:33:10] encouraged
[1:33:11] I want you to uh to realize uh that you
[1:33:15] don't have to do things by yourself
[1:33:17] uh uh God is more willing to help you
[1:33:21] than you want to be helped and and one
[1:33:23] of the things that I um I remember some
[1:33:25] a pastor's wife had said something to me
[1:33:28] and I believed it for a while until I
[1:33:30] kind of read this quote and kind of
[1:33:32] meditated on meditated about it in my
[1:33:34] heart about you know you got to be
[1:33:36] mature enough to receive the Holy Spirit
[1:33:38] at a certain age I don't think that's
[1:33:40] right right
[1:33:43] because that signifies you doing
[1:33:45] something
[1:33:47] that signifies you gaining knowledge to
[1:33:49] do something about it uh uh Salvation is
[1:33:53] a free gift from God
[1:33:56] he don't care how old you are you don't
[1:33:58] care how much you know or what you don't
[1:33:59] know you don't care how much you have or
[1:34:01] what you don't have but if you have a
[1:34:03] desire in your heart and you ask God
[1:34:05] what regardless of how old you are God
[1:34:08] will uh uh God will save you
[1:34:11] God will save you and will strengthen
[1:34:13] you in wisdom right and in stature uh uh
[1:34:18] and and you'll have favor of God and man
[1:34:21] from a young age is a blessing
[1:34:24] so let's uh read this quote in closing
[1:34:26] uh God bless you Sister
[1:34:28] back there to my right
[1:34:30] you now have received everlasting life
[1:34:33] and perishable life so this is the
[1:34:35] prophet you know God uh using
[1:34:37] discernment and he's seeing these things
[1:34:39] uh God come to your heart knocked at
[1:34:41] your door said if you let me in I'll
[1:34:44] give you life you raised your hand to
[1:34:46] him saying here you are Lord he can't
[1:34:48] cast you away
[1:34:49] this is important he'd have to repudiate
[1:34:52] his word he'd have to say something that
[1:34:53] wasn't right he can't he's God he has to
[1:34:56] keep his word all right
[1:34:57] and this is the key part oh I see two
[1:35:01] more God bless you there children Jesus
[1:35:04] sees your hand
[1:35:06] not your maturity not how much you know
[1:35:08] in the word uh uh uh not how much you
[1:35:12] understand or how much you know or what
[1:35:14] you don't know it just said I see two
[1:35:16] more God bless you children Jesus sees
[1:35:18] your hand God bless your little hearts
[1:35:21] little boys about 12 years old
[1:35:24] and you say well does he see that child
[1:35:26] yes and over to my left I see the little
[1:35:30] hand over in there I believe a little
[1:35:31] Mexican girls God bless you honey he
[1:35:34] gives you everlasting life right now
[1:35:38] foreign
[1:35:41] you have life as sure as I'm a minister
[1:35:44] behind the pulpit
[1:35:46] amen
[1:35:49] so uh going back to our original thought
[1:35:53] is it possible to be young and a
[1:35:56] believer
[1:35:57] it is possible
[1:35:59] not only is it possible you can flourish
[1:36:03] you can grow in wisdom you can grow in
[1:36:05] stature you can be filled with his
[1:36:07] spirit
[1:36:09] you can be anointed for service for work
[1:36:12] as a child
[1:36:15] amen so um as we kind of uh kind of
[1:36:18] close the service uh it's kind of a bow
[1:36:21] our heads and a word of prayer real
[1:36:24] quick
[1:36:27] Lord Jesus you've used these uh
[1:36:30] clay lips oh Lord to speak to your
[1:36:32] people Lord God lord you see the youth
[1:36:35] inside of here O Lord God they're the
[1:36:37] same youth that we're sitting in the uh
[1:36:39] in the message that the prophet just

[1:37:02] praying for these little ones oh Lord if
[1:37:04] there's a spark of life oh Lord God in

[1:37:28] pitfalls in the way they may not be
[1:37:30] mature enough to understand all of

[1:37:34] does not stop you from coming in oh Lord

[1:37:50] in the life of Jesus you've been with me
[1:37:52] from the start
[1:37:54] yeah there will be mistakes made oh Lord
[1:37:56] Jesus Christ but if you're the same
[1:37:57] yesterday and forever oh Lord just as
