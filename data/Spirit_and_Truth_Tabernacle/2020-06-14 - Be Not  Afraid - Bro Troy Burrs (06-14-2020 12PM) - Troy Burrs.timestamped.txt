[16:45] her 20s and she also has some of the
[16:46] symptoms and they're both were leaving
[16:49] comas in the hospital so we just want to
[16:51] pray a man for people and just pray that
[16:53] God continued to be a covering a man
[16:55] around us during this season just
[16:58] trusting God to bring us through all of
[17:00] this amen

[17:15] look for a Spirit of Truth Tabernacle
[17:17] also as a reference to our giving a man
[17:21] I wanted to just make mention that we
[17:25] are we made a change here with our the
[17:31] way that we produced the periscope video
[17:34] in the way that we do Facebook we've
[17:37] been able to bring everything into one
[17:39] platform and running off this new
[17:40] computer that was donated to the church
[17:43] and grateful for those that came
[17:44] together and put running together just
[17:46] to buy the computer but we've been able
[17:48] to just kind of bring these things
[17:50] together and we no longer have to use
[17:52] the iPad that we use set up set up here
[17:54] in the middle of the of the floor but
[17:57] we're bringing all together and just
[17:58] trying to improve the experience for
[18:00] those that are online and you know the
[18:03] brothers just kind of brought to my
[18:04] attention a brother Jack there's some
[18:05] things we just need to upgrade and we
[18:07] need to do in order to really make it
[18:09] special and you know we have we have put

[18:17] also there's a piece of equipment that
[18:21] we have purchased that we want to put in
[18:23] place
[18:25] as the stream is going out because kind

[18:42] just kind of tamper all of that down it
[18:44] will compress that and just make the
[18:46] experience just just real good just kind
[18:49] of balances all of that so it's like a
[18:51] compressor so we have to invest some
[18:53] money into the and to the equipment that
[18:56] we have in order to just keep up with
[18:59] the demands that are out there and and

[40:31] quick who was not gonna be here you know
[40:35] I had something that that was already
[40:38] prepared I just
[40:49] I told with it and I just trust and
[40:54] believe that the Lord has led me down
[40:56] this path Amen just trust that it bring
[41:00] comfort to your soul amen I will begin
[41:04] reading our said 27th we'll start from
[41:06] the 22nd verse Amen of Matthew the 14th
[41:12] chapter Amen and straightway Jesus
[41:17] constrained his disciples to get into
[41:21] his ship and to go before him unto the
[41:25] other side and while he sent the
[41:29] multitude away
[41:31] and when he had sent the multitude away
[41:34] he went up into a mountain apart to pray
[41:38] and when the evening was come he was
[41:43] there alone but the ship was now in the
[41:47] midst of the sea tossed with ways for
[41:52] the wind was contrary and in the fourth
[41:56] watch of the night Jesus went unto them
[41:59] walking on the sea and when the
[42:02] disciples saw him walking on the sea
[42:04] they were trouble saying it is a spirit
[42:08] and they cried out for fear but
[42:12] straightway Jesus spoke unto them saying
[42:14] be of good cheer it is I be not afraid
[42:18] and if I can title this message just
[42:22] have to know what I will title it be not
[42:25] afraid and Peter answered and said unto
[42:28] the Lord if it be thou bid me to come
[42:33] unto thee on the water and he said come
[42:37] and when Peter was come down out of the
[42:43] ship he walked on water to go to Jesus
[42:47] but when he saw the wind the boisterous
[42:51] he was afraid and began to sink and he
[42:55] cried saying lord save me and
[42:58] immediately Jesus stretched forth his
[43:02] hand and called him and said unto Him
[43:05] old thou of little faith wherefore
[43:09] wherefore didst thou doubt and when they
[43:15] were come into the ship the wind ceased
[43:19] then they were in the ship came and
[43:23] worshiped him saying of a truth thou art
[43:27] the son of God amen let us pray most
[43:31] gracious God we ask you O Father causes
[43:33] we have the ability to read these words
[43:36] law but only you can make them live Lord
[43:38] we ask you to let us take full control
[43:40] of father God and speak to the heart
[43:42] share people in Jesus name
[43:43] pray amen amen and as we said we want to
[43:46] take this little thought I'm sorry you
[43:50] may be seated
[43:51] take this little thought be not afraid
[43:54] a man we see so much is going on around
[44:00] us so much is happening across the
[44:06] landscape in every aspect of our life
[44:12] and I see I look at the same and and I
[44:20] say what's really going on because it
[44:25] has always an underlying thought here
[44:29] underlying a trick the devil always has
[44:34] and and and I begin to look at some
[44:36] things I begin to look back into the UH
[44:40] until a different movement of similar to
[44:43] this you know when the civil rights
[44:45] movement and and I begin to compare
[44:48] compare some of the key events and and
[44:55] and we looked at the civil rights and
[45:00] and started that with Truman and he put
[45:03] out a building it was just around the
[45:05] time when the Prophet ministry was
[45:08] beginning to gain steam and there we had
[45:11] year-old immaterial and the different
[45:13] things that started to give the the
[45:15] movement a little bit of momentum and
[45:19] all this if you take it no idea who
[45:23] completely compact have it all prepared
[45:25] why can can can take you from date the
[45:28] date I was working on it but I felt that
[45:30] was a little premature but I just want
[45:32] to give you just a basis of it as these
[45:36] things were happening everybody's
[45:39] attention was on or what's going on over
[45:43] here and what's going on over here this
[45:47] movement going on and people protesting
[45:50] and me locking arms in there marching
[45:52] and they're doing all of these
[45:54] things but they fail to see that God had
[46:00] sent a prophet amen the Savior was
[46:06] already coming they were looking for a
[46:11] savior they were looking for a man or
[46:17] someone that would give him a man what
[46:21] they had neither they were looking for
[46:24] someone that was able to give him the
[46:28] blessings a man that they had desire
[46:31] they wanted to be equal but what would
[46:35] they fail to see and we had a minister a
[46:40] man that that no doubt good man but he
[46:47] failed to see the prophets he failed to
[46:54] see what God was really doing there was
[46:59] a savior already here to lead the back
[47:05] the people back to work now
[47:08] after all of the work all of the the the
[47:13] marching all of the protest what did we
[47:19] gain we're here now we're here right now
[47:26] so so what did it what was it really
[47:31] their prophet preached the message what
[47:34] is the attraction on the mouth
[47:37] what is it that CCC when government when
[47:41] God beginning to move what the devil's
[47:43] job is the to to cause a distraction to
[47:48] take your focus away from what God is
[47:51] doing not since I've been alive I've
[47:56] never seen a greater distraction in the
[47:58] day so what I see what's going on today
[48:02] it gives me any
[48:03] cries maybe say well what is God is
[48:05] doing Oh Advent you to say hold on hold
[48:13] on big things are happening we see the
[48:19] Bible says when the devil when Satan
[48:22] comes in like a flood the Spirit of the
[48:24] Lord raises up a standard against it hey
[48:27] man so we see what this is seeing this
[48:31] is evil
[48:33] Oh both sides because this God Jesus was
[48:42] here there was stains but he had nothing
[48:44] to do with those things because he was
[48:48] sick here that wasn't the purpose he was
[48:51] seen here
[48:52] he stayed focused on what his job was he
[48:56] staying focused on the reason that God
[48:59] sent him here to redeem fallen man amen
[49:04] you can't start prophecy
[49:07] you can't protest stop seeing you can't
[49:12] protest morality it takes the Holy Ghost
[49:15] amen
[49:18] it takes the Word of God to change the
[49:20] heart of me I don't care how about how
[49:24] long you March huh you forgot everything
[49:27] don't worry that will be a protesters go
[49:29] burn you go clean it up you make sure
[49:37] you in the Ark if the people would just
[49:42] look to Jesus we see here in the
[49:45] scripture that I read that Peter and the
[49:48] disciples they were in the same type of
[49:51] condition amen
[49:54] they were out on the sea and the one
[50:00] thing that could save them they was
[50:04] afraid of and I want you to tell you
[50:07] that their whole reason amen why people
[50:10] are so tossed about it's all being fear
[50:15] driven
[50:18] this group is afraid this group is
[50:22] afraid everybody is being led by fear
[50:31] but we know God is not the author fear
[50:35] so where is it coming from this is a
[50:39] concerted plot scheme of the enemy to
[50:43] get your mind and your hop what happened
[50:45] he beat Peter to come say blood if you
[50:47] bid me to come now come Peter stepped
[50:52] out in the boat and what happened it was
[50:55] a supernatural thing he failed to
[51:01] recognize oh man if he just kept desires
[51:05] oh Jesus
[51:08] but he took his eyes off Jesus and began
[51:11] to look at the world problems get his
[51:17] mind on the world's problem that's we
[51:22] are in this world but we are not of this
[51:26] world
[51:27] we are not of this world
[51:30] you can't not see believe me I tried and
[51:35] it's horrible I see it things every day
[51:41] every day is something something just
[51:43] our Lord Jesus I can't even go horrible
[51:47] horrible things everybody in an uproar
[51:52] everybody's emotionally worked up
[51:55] emotionally worked up fear both sides
[52:01] from the highest office to the lowest
[52:05] fear so and they ever say that on the
[52:14] scripture here we look at this and it
[52:16] says uh Peter walked on water
[52:20] now the ship was waterlogged the sail
[52:25] was broken the Oz was gone
[52:30] they were holding on to each other
[52:33] screaming the ship was what alone our
[52:43] jobs are in jeopardy
[52:47] we got the pandemic and uh I don't even
[52:52] know what you call this other thing they
[52:55] call it up another pandemic going on at
[52:58] the same time all it takes now is a
[53:03] natural catastrophe we on the brink
[53:08] right on the brink where what we're
[53:14] going to have to at this time is
[53:17] imperative to keep our eyes straight on
[53:22] the world this is the time we've been
[53:26] preparing for to be sure footed to be
[53:32] steadfast amen abounding in the world
[53:37] staying fortified because it is the only
[53:40] thing that's going to hold we said here
[53:43] the ship was water long they're very
[53:46] scenic they were selling it was seeking
[53:48] the very economy that we had hope in and
[53:54] the jobs and our what we call it this
[53:57] deep my Chrissy it's sinking amen
[54:06] the sale was toward amen they had no
[54:11] direction they had no way to steer the
[54:15] ship amen no way to cut no compass
[54:26] tossed about with every wind Amen
[54:32] tossed about amen
[54:35] Oh like a ship without a sail no rudder
[54:41] they had no direction
[54:42] they had no way hey man the oars were
[54:50] gone so in in in in and a ship the sail
[54:55] gives you and if the Salomon now you got
[54:59] but those were gone they will act the
[55:02] complete mercy of the situation the only
[55:08] one that could save them was Jesus the
[55:12] only one that could save them was the
[55:15] Word of God was the only thing a man
[55:20] that they could find some sort of
[55:22] comfort but when it came when Jesus came
[55:29] amen walking on water they feared him
[55:35] they feared him what is it Peter say is
[55:41] that you if that shoe Lord beat me to
[55:44] come and I'll say to you this morning
[55:47] the Lord is beating you to come I say to
[55:52] you this morning those of you that are
[55:54] online
[55:54] the Lord is beating you to come the ship
[56:00] is sinking all hope is gone economy is
[56:08] in trouble
[56:09] politics is done over with amen the
[56:16] Prophet preached a message all this in
[56:19] 55 indictment well he indicted this
[56:24] nation for rejecting the Word of God for
[56:29] rejecting the Word of God it began and I
[56:33] believe it was in oh I can't remember
[56:37] the date now buddy preached invasion of
[56:39] the USA he said through Hollywood amen
[56:45] there was a great invasion decaying the
[56:49] moral fiber of this country
[56:56] it was stunned and he said it was not
[56:58] something from the outside but is the
[57:00] worm at the core the Apple that was
[57:02] going to destroy and you can see now
[57:04] that we're destroying from the is it's
[57:07] not the enemy out there it's our own
[57:10] immorality that's destroying amen now we
[57:19] see here the only hope that we have the
[57:24] only hope and they were afraid of the
[57:29] only thing that could save them a man
[57:33] the prophecy here is that in a true
[57:35] picture of the day say a man they
[57:39] thought it was spooky
[57:41] you know they cried out in fear it's a
[57:44] spirit but you just do like they did
[57:50] when they cry out they heard the voice
[57:53] and the voice said fear not now he was
[58:00] talking to an Alexa
[58:03] you're not I told you to go to the other
[58:07] side I told you to go to the other side
[58:11] fear not be not afraid
[58:15] amen but you just we see that that if
[58:22] you just watch the word of promise for
[58:25] this eight prophecy you'll hear the same
[58:29] voice speaking through his word it's me
[58:35] fear not be not afraid to hit a word of
[58:40] this thing he says I promised to do this
[58:46] in the last days fear not don't be
[58:49] scared
[58:49] put your trust in me the son of God amen
[58:55] if you turn to sister why we are so
[59:02] tossed about 56 Oh 101 paragraphs
[59:09] ix Amen paragraph 79 why we're so tossed
[59:19] about a man if there was ever you know
[59:29] people talk about the Bible days if
[59:33] these in the Bible days I don't know
[59:36] what he if there was another generation
[59:40] another behind this one they were and if
[59:43] they were read this oh my this would be
[59:45] some good reading this would be some
[59:49] good reading going on here amen
[59:52] why we're so talked about 79 now I've
[59:56] noticed many Christians in my life
[1:00:01] to be up and down I wondered about that
[1:00:05] and without preaching such a text as
[1:00:10] this out of the other churches to where
[1:00:14] I go I thought best to deliver this to
[1:00:17] my people here at the Tabernacle he says
[1:00:21] why people are so tossed about you find
[1:00:26] them people who seem to be very
[1:00:30] religious seem to have such a deep
[1:00:33] desire and daily they search and hunt
[1:00:36] and seek for God and never come to any
[1:00:40] settlement of any kind to where they
[1:00:43] could ever be settled and anchored in
[1:00:47] Christ and this I have learned to be in
[1:00:51] the experience that it is people of
[1:00:55] intellectuals amen people of
[1:01:02] intellectuals now speaking this there
[1:01:05] are two different types of Christianity
[1:01:08] seems strange but I would say to you
[1:01:13] different types I'll say different
[1:01:16] phases would be better word to use - not
[1:01:21] two types but two different
[1:01:23] is the same Christianity but two phases
[1:01:26] of it and one of them is an intellectual
[1:01:30] or mental conception and the other of
[1:01:34] what God has said in his word and of
[1:01:37] what Jesus Christ by the way and by the
[1:01:41] way of knowledge okay and the other is
[1:01:46] an experimental experience that God has
[1:01:53] given the man in his heart
[1:01:58] see not staying with me next night not
[1:02:01] not hold that one is an intellectual
[1:02:05] conception the other is an experience
[1:02:11] that God has that God has give the man
[1:02:14] in his heart a man now the one
[1:02:20] intellectually is hollering he is
[1:02:24] feasting on God but his feasts doesn't
[1:02:31] hold out a man the other one seems to
[1:02:36] have victory all the time nothing
[1:02:40] bothers him there's just a solid anchor
[1:02:44] and they can they can be no trials no
[1:02:51] stones that bother him at all
[1:02:54] but they seem to have something about
[1:02:57] them that people who are Christians and
[1:03:00] trying to live for God admire that type
[1:03:04] of Christian a man and I've often
[1:03:08] wondered Lord what is it that these
[1:03:12] people has that the others crave so much
[1:03:16] for and yet seem to fail to get it amen
[1:03:22] now now to see this hovering
[1:03:32] yeah the probably went into something
[1:03:34] else and that's a real good thing there
[1:03:35] he was talking about I'll go ahead and
[1:03:37] do it he was talking about here I was
[1:03:38] speaking to this yesterday to a little
[1:03:41] old colored man who told me of of a
[1:03:44] minister walking back and tearing up his
[1:03:48] preaching papers and throw them into the
[1:03:51] trash and said I'm through with it and
[1:03:55] the following Sunday he got a case of
[1:04:00] beer he said I'm done I quit the father

[1:05:35] place and drank it a couple of weeks
[1:05:38] after that he lay dying on the bed
[1:05:43] he said if I prophesied man if I had
[1:05:46] time I'd explain that but I'd be getting
[1:05:50] off on to another subject how that Satan
[1:05:54] come in and took the person God had to
[1:06:00] take his child home that's all there was
[1:06:05] that's all that could happen he had to
[1:06:11] take his child home amen
[1:06:15] never let go there's gonna be things
[1:06:20] that come up there's gonna be situations
[1:06:23] that come up and and and the devil is
[1:06:26] always gonna be trying to just just quit
[1:06:29] just give up never let go a man never
[1:06:36] let go now we go on not to see this
[1:06:41] hungry for people and yet not able to
[1:06:45] reach it's this place that they wanna
[1:06:48] play that they desire to be in and many
[1:06:52] of our teachers and schools have brought
[1:06:54] in much theology telling the people well
[1:06:57] it's because you didn't show well it's
[1:07:00] because you didn't speak in tongues well
[1:07:04] it's because you didn't get slained in
[1:07:06] the spirit telling them all of these
[1:07:09] different things the Prophet brought out
[1:07:13] he said when they were crossing the Red
[1:07:14] Sea and they come over to the promised
[1:07:15] land each night it rained down manna
[1:07:17] from heaven amen the people were going
[1:07:22] to take the manna and they make it the
[1:07:24] bread into bread and cakes and something
[1:07:27] and they would eat this bread which
[1:07:30] sustained them for the life's journey
[1:07:32] and when they found out many times they
[1:07:35] had left the manor
[1:07:37] laid just a little bit too long on the
[1:07:39] ground and it would melt away and run
[1:07:42] like the Frost something on the ground
[1:07:45] run like a frost or something on the
[1:07:48] ground and it didn't hold now stay with
[1:07:51] me here now we see that the same thing
[1:07:54] is happening in Christianity many
[1:07:57] people before 9 o'clock get hungry and
[1:07:59] have you have a lot of what they call
[1:08:04] campground well what would I say
[1:08:07] campground stores amen many people go to
[1:08:11] the services and rejoice and they shout
[1:08:14] and they praise the Lord while the
[1:08:17] Spirit of God is falling all
[1:08:19] condemnation has left their heart and as
[1:08:23] soon as the day as soon as a day of soul
[1:08:27] or two after the revival they find
[1:08:29] themselves right back to the old grind
[1:08:32] again yet they were eaten matter they
[1:08:38] were eaten manna the Bible says here st.
[1:08:43] John the fifth
[1:08:44] chapter xxi he that hears my word man
[1:08:49] hears my word and believeth on him that
[1:08:52] sent me hath everlasting life and shall
[1:08:57] never come into judgment but has already
[1:09:00] passed from death unto life now we look
[1:09:05] at that Scripture he that heareth my
[1:09:07] word and I thank God this morning
[1:09:08] the pastor read a quote that was just so
[1:09:11] wonderful I had to go and jot it down
[1:09:13] amen
[1:09:15] what do we have to do we have to believe
[1:09:21] first we have to hear hear bleep now
[1:09:29] like to get into something here jesus
[1:09:32] said the word he that hears my words
[1:09:39] believeth on him that sent me hath
[1:09:42] eternal and never ending always existing
[1:09:48] life he says isn't that marvelous
[1:09:53] ever existing life and shall never
[1:09:58] perish but have already passed from
[1:10:02] death unto life has passed from
[1:10:05] separation or to everlasting presence
[1:10:11] everlasting presence you passed from
[1:10:15] death unto life from darkness today from
[1:10:20] mortality to immortality from corruption
[1:10:24] to incorruption from weary to joy from
[1:10:31] death to life from rest and resting
[1:10:36] fully in thus saith the Lord not upon
[1:10:43] feelings not upon mental emotion theory
[1:10:50] or theory apart not upon some unknown
[1:10:55] something that somebody has said to you
[1:10:58] that has no basis a lot of times we get
[1:11:04] caught up in emotion we get caught up in
[1:11:08] mental conception a man we caught up in
[1:11:14] theories a man in all of this is based
[1:11:18] on what some body told us that has no
[1:11:23] scriptural basis and we wonder why our
[1:11:29] anchors not holding it won't hold him
[1:11:33] man a man now four things faith cometh
[1:11:42] by hearing hearing the word and
[1:11:45] believing and applying and then resting
[1:11:48] there's four things hearing believing
[1:11:54] applying and resting a man since then if
[1:12:01] you will turn to take your size with
[1:12:06] Jesus
[1:12:07] 62 Oh 601 paragraph 67 a man taking
[1:12:18] sides with Jesus paragraph 67
[1:12:22] a man now Sancerre no I want you to go
[1:12:32] go down something go go go up you up my
[1:12:36] down whatever hold on hold on slow down
[1:12:39] go down I want to get well we'll just
[1:12:43] read it in the house of Cornelius I
[1:12:45] don't know which way you win she went up
[1:12:49] God is no respected person we see a
[1:12:51] person deeply and sincere he can be
[1:12:55] sincerely wrong but if he is sincerely a
[1:13:02] man second line oh I got you sincerely
[1:13:08] God would lead him to the light
[1:13:11] somewhere he'll come to it amen
[1:13:15] got a leader to the light somewhere
[1:13:17] he'll come to it if he sincerely because
[1:13:21] God is obligated to do that and we think
[1:13:25] about the coming of the Lord being such
[1:13:28] a great thing and the message no more
[1:13:31] than its wint remember there's a
[1:13:37] predestinated group to be here when the
[1:13:42] Lord returns and it might not be over a
[1:13:47] dozen Amy it might not be over a dozen
[1:13:52] see we don't know it might be a hundred
[1:13:56] million might be ten thousand but if the
[1:13:59] predestinated will hear the message now
[1:14:02] listen now the predestinated will hear
[1:14:08] hear what the message and believe and
[1:14:15] believe now I said there's four things
[1:14:17] here believe apply and rest amen he said
[1:14:27] here the predestinated we're here the
[1:14:30] message and believe
[1:14:34] first you got it here faith cometh by
[1:14:37] hearing hearing the Word of God amen and
[1:14:44] then there comes the hope now if you
[1:14:49] will turn to that the message the
[1:14:54] darkest hour then the darkest hour then
[1:15:00] Jesus came 55:11 14 5511 14 paragraph 26
[1:15:10] 37 I say I gotta go to paragraph 26
[1:15:21] let's see here this came to me later I
[1:15:24] didn't have I would have had it all
[1:15:26] printed out but the Lord gave me this at
[1:15:27] the lad at the twelfth hour and he
[1:15:30] looked around
[1:15:31] okay parents going to see
[1:15:41] yeah okay good okay he's he's seen a
[1:15:45] woman how he did it that's a secret but
[1:15:51] he found her he said the little woman
[1:15:54] with the blood issue said your faith has
[1:15:59] saved you that faith has saved me he
[1:16:04] says now watch the same word there is
[1:16:09] the Greek word Sozo Souls o means
[1:16:14] applying to salvation of the soul or
[1:16:20] body faith he says that faith has saved
[1:16:25] me physically amen
[1:16:28] that faith has saved thee physically
[1:16:31] just the same as my faith saved thee
[1:16:34] spiritually the same Greek word Sozo
[1:16:38] is that right all right see the same
[1:16:44] word thy faith hath saved thee amen go
[1:16:47] down to paragraph 35 35 amen
[1:17:00] amen I think that's a man all right
[1:17:07] paragraph 35 we're talking about
[1:17:10] applying he said the Greek works souls
[1:17:14] old means applying so as far as we hear
[1:17:16] believe now we have to apply the word
[1:17:19] how do we apply the word how do we do
[1:17:23] that preach it
[1:17:24] see go down a little bit go up a little
[1:17:28] bit because I got here thirty five
[1:17:29] thirty no go to thirty seven I told you
[1:17:32] wrong
[1:17:32] thirty-seven keep going you're doing
[1:17:35] good okay keep going I know but I said I
[1:17:41] got here thirty seven point five okay
[1:17:45] stop see the Bible is written I want to
[1:17:50] make sure I don't miss it see the Bible
[1:17:54] is written on words but the Bible is a
[1:17:57] love story to the church okay he says
[1:18:01] when I preach here not long ago a few
[1:18:04] years ago on Abraham and Sarah turning
[1:18:07] back to be a young boy and girl again
[1:18:11] from when they was a hundred years old
[1:18:15] and preacher laughed at me and said word
[1:18:20] that the same preacher wrote a book on
[1:18:23] it not long ago and passed it out across
[1:18:28] the country God did turn Abraham and
[1:18:31] Sarah back to young boy and girl and
[1:18:34] came to prove that gonna okay but you
[1:18:41] see the Bible you'll never learn it in a
[1:18:44] seminary he says I don't care
[1:18:49] that might sound awfully flat but the
[1:18:52] Bible said God said that he has hid
[1:18:55] these things from the eyes of the wise
[1:18:58] and the prudent and we reveal it to
[1:19:01] babes such as would learn is that right
[1:19:07] you see he revealed it to babes you
[1:19:11] don't have to be smart to understand
[1:19:13] in the Bible you have to have a humble
[1:19:17] heart keep going
[1:19:19] the Bible is God's love story to the
[1:19:22] church that's hid a may from all of the
[1:19:26] scholars in the world and only note by
[1:19:31] the scholar by one scholarship that's
[1:19:34] through me
[1:19:36] I love gee he does know about one
[1:19:41] scholarship Amen through the great
[1:19:44] School of Theology it ever had any of it
[1:19:50] do you know what I mean down on your
[1:19:54] knees not a Bible here a man is you have
[1:20:02] to read between the lines make it right
[1:20:08] now and then it goes into my wife but
[1:20:10] you can take that down so earlier he was
[1:20:13] talking about souls oh and they asked
[1:20:15] the question how do you apply first you
[1:20:20] hear you hear did you believe the third
[1:20:27] thing is to apply it how do you apply
[1:20:31] the word down on your bended knees it's
[1:20:39] how you apply the word to your life down
[1:20:45] on your knees
[1:20:47] Lord I don't understand it how how do I
[1:20:50] become the question was asked earlier
[1:20:53] and while some total he said there were
[1:20:56] two phases some are here and believe but
[1:21:04] there's a physical and a mental
[1:21:05] conception today but when you get down
[1:21:09] on your knees and began to plead to God
[1:21:16] begin to talk to God amen to the things
[1:21:22] that you hear I believe in law but I
[1:21:25] don't understand
[1:21:26] he said he's obligated to give you the
[1:21:30] revelation there what it goes from here
[1:21:36] down into here and it becomes a
[1:21:41] relationship right but applying happens
[1:21:46] on your knees the next is resting amen
[1:21:54] the next is resting we're gonna move on
[1:21:57] I have another quote there for resting
[1:22:00] amen
[1:22:01] so we got the four things here believing
[1:22:05] applying and resting on the Word of God
[1:22:09] resting on what the word has taught us
[1:22:11] told you not being tossed about we see
[1:22:15] the trouble to the rawness we see the
[1:22:18] calamity and everything but if we hear
[1:22:21] the word we believe the word we've
[1:22:24] applied the word why do we got to worry
[1:22:26] about
[1:22:28] Amen we got nothing to worry about
[1:22:32] much like Peter and the disciples on the
[1:22:35] boat and everything was going wrong but
[1:22:39] they had a word jesus said go to the
[1:22:42] other side he said go to the other side
[1:22:48] Danny turned around and made him to come
[1:22:50] let him know that I'm with you I'm with
[1:22:53] you whatever the situation is be of good
[1:22:56] courage be not afraid
[1:23:01] amen see what's going on riding and all
[1:23:07] of these things if I could stand that on
[1:23:13] the caller ID right it be not afraid
[1:23:17] they have no hope they're fearful
[1:23:22] throwing rocks and burning down places
[1:23:27] and acting a fool go home
[1:23:33] get on your knees and tuck the garden a
[1:23:42] ShowMe law what's going on what's really
[1:23:46] happening cuz we seen the last time we
[1:23:50] had uproar like this in this country a
[1:23:52] prophet was on the scene there's another
[1:23:57] distraction so what's really going on
[1:24:00] what if that devil is trying to keep you
[1:24:02] from what is it that he's trying to keep
[1:24:05] you from the little church in the corner
[1:24:08] and it ain't about that little Church in
[1:24:10] the corner
[1:24:11] believe me this churches all over the
[1:24:12] world God are getting ready to take his
[1:24:14] people home God is preparing amen
[1:24:19] so we look at these things and we can't
[1:24:22] get sidetracked that's later you see a
[1:24:26] problem I'm not a lady to see you ladies
[1:24:32] see of me people's rights everybody got
[1:24:34] it right the dog got a right right

[1:25:06] it for your glory
[1:25:07] I'm not buck fight I'm just coming
[1:25:11] humbly to the throne of grace lead me
[1:25:17] great Shepherd leave me great Shepherd
[1:25:21] keep your eyes on the ship the Prophet
[1:25:25] was talking about how the great Shepherd
[1:25:28] was leading the Sheep amen and he led
[1:25:32] the Sheep down through the city right
[1:25:35] through the market right through the
[1:25:36] middle of market they were food on this
[1:25:39] side food on that side now once she got
[1:25:42] out of line
[1:25:43] they all stayed right there in a
[1:25:45] single-file line keeping their eyes on
[1:25:47] the ship keep that and he led them a
[1:25:50] good grazing land good grazing land they
[1:25:56] didn't have to we know the shepherd own
[1:25:59] feeders okay what's going on

[1:26:56] better far but I tell you what right now
[1:26:58] it is time to make sure Amen that it's
[1:27:05] gonna be on our in too late and the word
[1:27:09] is sinking them to our heart we have to
[1:27:12] apply to work on your knees on your
[1:27:20] knees
[1:27:21] amen not gonna keep you much longer
[1:27:28] he says here you passed from death unto
[1:27:35] life from darkness today for mortality
[1:27:38] to immortality from corruption to
[1:27:40] incorruption from weary to joy from
[1:27:45] death unto life and resting upon thus
[1:27:51] saying see that's what we put our
[1:27:56] amen cuz see that ain't gonna sing and I
[1:28:00] don't dust saith the Lord not a punk
[1:28:03] feelings mental emotion theory upon what
[1:28:08] somebody else says that has no basis but
[1:28:11] upon the Word of God the human soul
[1:28:14] rests solidly God said so that settles
[1:28:21] it
[1:28:22] that makes it real amen
[1:28:26] he says what makes these people go out
[1:28:30] on the ground and eat the matter and did
[1:28:34] before nightfall many of them go hungry
[1:28:39] many of them go to church and they hear
[1:28:41] the word of God I hear the sermon and
[1:28:43] they rejoice but is that the thing that
[1:28:45] comes in and but but what is that thing
[1:28:48] that comes in and take it away from them
[1:28:52] the first difficulty that rise truly if
[1:28:57] you are hearing the word and your soul
[1:29:00] is rejoicing in the word it's the Holy
[1:29:03] Spirit and you are eating amen
[1:29:05] I believe that you believe unto
[1:29:08] everlasting life I believe that you
[1:29:10] accept the word of Jesus Christ of Jesus
[1:29:14] Christ gives you everlasting eternal
[1:29:15] life when you believe I believe by one
[1:29:19] spirit that you are baptized into the
[1:29:21] body of believers see your face anchors
[1:29:25] you in Christ amen that's that's
[1:29:31] intellectual you believe it you accept
[1:29:35] it you say that's right you recognize it
[1:29:40] to be truth and you're a Christian and
[1:29:42] you've got everlasting life by believing
[1:29:46] it you've entered into God you're on the
[1:29:50] campground manna is falling and you're
[1:29:54] eating and did you notice the strength
[1:29:57] thing that went that there was a mixed
[1:30:01] multitude eating the same manner a man a
[1:30:06] mixed multitude eating the same manner
[1:30:09] people who are sinners who do not accept
[1:30:12] the Lord Jesus can still enjoy seeing
[1:30:15] the moving of the miracles of God heal
[1:30:18] another city came rejoicing the people
[1:30:20] doing right can open their hearts and
[1:30:23] rejoice in a sermon that's preached
[1:30:26] under the anointing and that's the same
[1:30:29] type of manner that Christians are
[1:30:31] eating amen the same type of manner then
[1:30:36] you always remember my doctrine here at
[1:30:39] the Tabernacle you have to follow God in
[1:30:42] threes because he's perfected and free a
[1:30:45] man he says now we wonder why and we
[1:30:51] find out that this manner would vanish
[1:30:54] and it would come on the ground and
[1:30:56] vanish then come again and vanish every
[1:31:00] day some of it we're by 9 o'clock it's
[1:31:03] gone
[1:31:04] he said I've met people stand in church
[1:31:08] and see and just rejoice and see them go
[1:31:13] outside the church and maybe Monday or
[1:31:16] Tuesday or just living on behaving
[1:31:21] becoming too Christian and the man or
[1:31:25] woman who ever it may be would turn and
[1:31:28] shake your hand and say I don't want to
[1:31:32] do these things you feel sorry for them
[1:31:35] a man you've seen people accept divine
[1:31:40] healing and say oh yes I see I see it
[1:31:42] it's the word oh thank you lord thank
[1:31:45] you lord I believe it and they go right
[1:31:47] out in a few days
[1:31:49] first little storm strikes their back
[1:31:51] they go again amen
[1:31:56] you've noticed it it's true and the
[1:31:59] people can't help it so what is it all
[1:32:03] about what causes these things to happen
[1:32:06] he said now let's notice now we notice
[1:32:09] the matter when it failed God sending it
[1:32:12] down to provide life for the children of
[1:32:15] Israel in their journey then God told
[1:32:18] Moses Angie don't make
[1:32:20] golden puck and to fill it a man full of
[1:32:25] mana and put it in the holiest of the
[1:32:28] holiest of holy places by the ark this
[1:32:33] manner was to be set by the ark and
[1:32:37] there's no and there it never failed it
[1:32:43] would never go oh it never lost its
[1:32:46] weakness it was always inside there
[1:32:50] amen he said that you ever meet a person
[1:32:54] that's been in there and has tasted and
[1:32:58] on the living manner you can meet him on
[1:33:03] Monday and on Tuesday and on Wednesday
[1:33:07] and on Thursday and on Friday Saturday
[1:33:13] Sunday cloudy day bright day gloomy day

[1:40:36] you see that the one thing that Moses I
[1:40:39] mean I said Moses jo-jo fear the most
[1:40:56] wonder one thing that he feared the most
[1:40:58] is what happened to him
[1:40:59] Amen I had to hear in my notes but I'm
[1:41:01] just gonna forgo that I'll probably find
[1:41:04] as soon as I get out the pool okay
[1:41:05] amen praise the Lord the book of Joel he
[1:41:16] says here Joe what he feared it actually
[1:41:22] happened what brought it the musicians
[1:41:25] come his fear that's what made it happen
[1:41:31] his faith could have kept him from it
[1:41:35] but his fear brought him brought him to
[1:41:39] brought it to him he was scared it was
[1:41:43] going to happen and it did happen
[1:41:46] perfect faith perfect faith 63 mmm-hmm a
[1:41:53] man brought a his fear and that's what
[1:41:57] made it happen
[1:41:58] his faith would have kept him from it
[1:42:01] but his fear brought him brought it to
[1:42:06] him he was scared of it going to happen
[1:42:09] and it did happen now it been he know it
[1:42:15] would happen it wouldn't happen see what
[1:42:20] I mean
[1:42:21] I'm gonna read that again he was scared
[1:42:25] it was going to happen and it did happen
[1:42:29] now
[1:42:32] if been he knowed it wouldn't happen it
[1:42:35] wouldn't have happened
[1:42:37] see what I mean if you're afraid when
[1:42:40] you come by the prayer line maybe I just
[1:42:45] maybe I just haven't got the faith
[1:42:48] sufficient it'll never happen
[1:42:51] don't worry see but if you if you know
[1:42:55] it's going to happen it'll happen it's a
[1:43:00] substance of something job had a fear
[1:43:04] that these things would come upon him
[1:43:07] and they did if you have fear that your
[1:43:13] disease is going to leave you're going
[1:43:17] to leave you or won't leave you it won't
[1:43:20] if you have faith that it will and it
[1:43:25] will a man you ask any medical doctor
[1:43:29] the first thing they try to do they try
[1:43:32] to get you to do is to have confidence
[1:43:35] in the medicine he's giving you if you
[1:43:39] haven't got confidence in it you better
[1:43:44] leave it alone
[1:43:45] see sure what is it it's faith that does
[1:43:51] that does the healing it's faith that
[1:43:54] does it all the time so I see my
[1:44:00] brothers and sisters don't be afraid
[1:44:03] don't be afraid by the covert or
[1:44:09] political oppress or national chaos all
[1:44:15] of the things that's going on around us

[1:51:25] through with one thing and then
[1:51:26] something else rise up and something
[1:51:28] rise up but in the midst of all of that
