[8:45] amen amen amen i well pick up what we
[8:52] left off I won't have you standing long
[8:55] a man will read a scripture here from
[8:59] Deuteronomy the fourth chapter and I'll
[9:06] let you have your seat so long I'll take
[9:10] our time see I'm just having
[10:57] even that's better hey man look sorry
[11:01] Deuteronomy a man the fourth chapter in
[11:05] the fourteenth verse a man we're
[11:07] speaking on and just studying looking
[11:10] into worship and we titled it a worship
[11:16] service and just kind of looking at how
[11:19] we were in in this in this age and all
[11:23] throughout time you know the devil's
[11:26] primary objective is to exalt himself
[11:30] above the throne of God and to be
[11:33] worshipped by man he desired to be
[11:37] worshipped and if you're not careful if
[11:40] you're not careful in this hour without
[11:42] the reveal word without a revelation you
[11:46] will find yourself worshiping Satan and
[11:50] not knowing it amen and these are the
[11:53] things that we just kind of want to
[11:54] bring out Amen because mankind was
[11:57] created to worship amen we regardless of
[12:02] whether we go to church or regardless of
[12:05] what we do man I'm going to just going
[12:07] to find something to worship see because
[12:10] we're sheep and we must follow something
[12:13] amen if we if we not following the right
[12:16] thing we'll follow the wrong thing amen
[12:19] Deuteronomy the fourth chapter and the
[12:21] fourteenth first and the LORD commanded
[12:24] me at the time to teach you statutes and
[12:29] judgments that you might do them in the
[12:33] land whether you go over to possess take
[12:37] you there for good heed unto yourselves
[12:40] for ye saw no manner of similar to on
[12:44] the day that the Lord spake unto you in
[12:48] harab out of the midst of the fire lest
[12:53] ye corrupt yourselves and make you a
[12:56] graven image the similar tool of any
[13:01] figure the likeness of male or female
[13:05] the likeness of any beast that is on the
[13:09] earth
[13:09] likeness of any winged fowl that flies
[13:12] in the air the likeness of anything that
[13:15] creepeth on the ground the likeness of
[13:17] any fish is in the water or beneath the
[13:20] earth and less thou lift up that an
[13:23] island to heaven and when now since the
[13:26] Sun in the moon and the stars even all
[13:30] the host of heaven should be driven to
[13:33] worship worship them and to serve them
[13:37] which the LORD thy God has divided unto
[13:40] the nations under the whole heaven made
[13:43] a lord at a blessing to the reading of
[13:45] his word amen you may be seated
[13:49] amen we see here that you know one of
[13:53] the first commandments that the Lord
[13:57] gave the children of Israel that he said
[14:01] that he'll have no other God before a
[14:04] man because we see that that in the
[14:09] beginning Satan from the beginning met
[14:15] him there in the Garden of Eden God had
[14:18] already had laid things out he took six
[14:24] thousand years and and he and he laid
[14:26] out the garden just the way he wanted to
[14:28] and he gave Adam dominion over
[14:31] everything in the garden and he gave
[14:34] them a wife and and and and everything
[14:37] was good there but what he did was Satan
[14:41] came in and did just what he do he
[14:44] perverted what God had already done and
[14:47] he started with the seed because the
[14:50] Word of God is the original seed so if
[14:54] he can just get in there and corrupt
[14:56] that see he gave Eve a hybrid word see
[15:02] the God's Word is pure and it must stay
[15:07] peer so the devil came in and he gave
[15:10] her pot truth he gave her a little bit
[15:14] of truth mix with the life the
[15:18] definition of
[15:20] section is the truth misrepresented so
[15:25] he is a deceiver and so he was able to
[15:28] slide in and and and and and give her a
[15:31] part of the word and didn't slip his own
[15:34] agenda and right on the end there which
[15:38] calls her to go off amen and message god
[15:44] of this evil age he pointed out how at
[15:46] that time it took God six thousand years
[15:50] a man to create his Garden of Eden and
[15:53] it's his taking they devil six thousand
[15:55] years to create his Garden of Eden and
[15:57] we're living right smack dab in the
[15:59] middle of it now this is Satan's Eden
[16:03] amen but there shall be light in the
[16:07] evening time amen
[16:09] we see here that uh in Isaiah he says I
[16:13] will ascend upon the heights of the
[16:15] clouds and will be like the Most High
[16:18] we're going to just kind of just go back
[16:20] a little bit then we're going to get
[16:22] into some things amen
[16:25] Cain and Abel they both worship they
[16:29] both was was did with the church they
[16:36] both was justified Amen man they both
[16:41] was sanctified they both did everything
[16:45] that they did but the only difference
[16:47] between Cain and Abel was Abel had a
[16:52] revelation that it was blood
[16:56] Cain still believe that Oh lied I
[17:01] believe that it was fruit in the garden
[17:05] and they've been telling that lie since
[17:07] - since then that it was an apple so he
[17:12] went and planted a garden amen and
[17:15] presented amen the fruits of his labor a
[17:20] man of his labor of the things saying
[17:23] well this is what I did Lord look at
[17:26] what I did this is what I did but see
[17:30] you have to understand
[17:32] that that was Kane's service to the Lord
[17:35] he go out and he would he would check
[17:38] his garden and he would turn to the to
[17:42] the fruiting and the different things
[17:44] and he'd leave them across the altar in
[17:46] incense seal service to God but she let
[17:52] me tell you something you have to you
[17:54] have to be in God's will to do him a
[17:58] service you can be sincere in your
[18:02] efforts and me but if you're not in the
[18:05] will of God your service is not accepted
[18:09] if you're not in the revelation of the
[18:12] truth for the hour in which you're
[18:14] living in your worship is not accepted
[18:18] we look now and in today's time many
[18:23] people don't search doors every Sunday
[18:27] and good people see we have to
[18:31] understand that it's not the people but
[18:34] it's the church system it's the system
[18:38] we we we go back and we looked at that
[18:41] that uh the Prophet brought out that
[18:43] Babylon he said it was the system the
[18:49] system of idol worship and that that's
[18:53] that that concept has been spread
[18:56] throughout the entire world
[18:58] Amen we'll see how Nimrod had brought
[19:01] together all of the nations they may
[19:04] have brought together all of the nations
[19:05] and he introduced this idol worship one
[19:09] of the main things men this worship of
[19:12] three gods a man with the father
[19:17] the woman and the child the Prophet
[19:20] brought out in the church ages how he
[19:23] didn't in that time they put the woman
[19:27] over the Child Jesus it was the father
[19:32] in heaven the end Oh mother and damned -
[19:37] ah and this three gossip placing the
[19:42] woman as a go matter
[19:45] pressure brought up in the message
[19:48] flashing red lights are becoming like
[19:51] this nation amen you see now that the
[19:55] woman has become her God amen and she's
[20:00] been a tool in the hand of the Satan
[20:03] every since the beginning the Bible said
[20:06] that the sons of God that looked on the
[20:08] daughters of men and saw that they were
[20:10] found a man and then it took a partner
[20:14] wives amen he's always been dangling a
[20:18] woman using a woman to achieve his
[20:21] agenda amen we go back and we look here
[20:26] we see that that number odd had three
[20:30] main objectives his first objective was
[20:34] a man for every to create a man I'm
[20:42] sorry hello his first objective was to
[20:45] create a name for himself he wanted to
[20:50] make a name for himself his objective
[20:55] was not a man for Christ or God to be
[20:59] glorified he it was all about him amen
[21:04] and the second objective was to start
[21:08] his own religion we see how was one
[21:13] religion that was a way the gods way but
[21:16] he wanted to propagate his own way to
[21:21] get to glory his third thing was to
[21:25] build a strong nation amen and so we see
[21:30] that the only nation that people that
[21:33] God called as a nation was the Jews and
[21:37] other than that God calls individuals he
[21:42] never called anyone else as a nation so
[21:47] we see that that when he was talking
[21:50] about a nation the Prophet brought that
[21:53] out as he wanted to build a denomination
[21:59] and seeing that that well was the seat
[22:02] where he would draw people up under this
[22:05] system of idolatry amen and blinding the
[22:11] people under the deception and started a
[22:14] polytheism form of worship amen and not
[22:19] that that concept just kind of just kind
[22:22] of when it went across the world there
[22:24] and and we see all across in different
[22:27] societies and different sects where the
[22:30] same thing we see a Buddha they have
[22:33] it's an image of three Buddhist priests
[22:37] amen and they worship and over in India
[22:40] they have something similar to that and
[22:42] here amen we see the concept of the
[22:46] Father Son and the Holy Ghost and we'll
[22:49] get into that just a little bit later
[22:51] now we found today a man that people you
[22:58] ask people about Christianity and and
[23:03] they say they tend to tell you that
[23:07] they'd all they have to do is be a good
[23:09] person speaking to people you find that
[23:13] today it seems that people whatever they
[23:16] choose God would just accept anything on
[23:21] the basis of the sincerity of their
[23:24] heart but no it has to be God's provided
[23:29] wait you can't just be like Nimrod come
[23:34] up with your own idea you can't be like
[23:38] him and just say well well well well I'm
[23:40] not gonna really search the scripture to
[23:43] see how we get back to to glory I'm
[23:46] having everybody believe well one day
[23:48] there's a rapture in there when we die
[23:50] we all just go to help but no one is
[23:53] looking to see well where what is the
[23:56] way that is a door there is a way
[24:01] there's a provided wait amen
[24:04] let's look at Deuteronomy the sixteenth
[24:07] chapter a man that were to run him at a
[24:11] sixteenth chapter
[24:12] amen we're gonna look into that a little
[24:15] bit a man what is God's provided place
[24:23] of worship a man it's a very important
[24:32] the Prophet preached this message in
[24:35] 1965 three times a man in each time his
[24:41] revelation on the subject seemed to have
[24:44] just gotten greater and greater he also
[24:47] went between he preached trying to do
[24:50] God a service without it being his will
[24:52] and also right and then he preached
[24:55] spiritual food and due season and right
[24:58] behind that I think he preached it is
[25:00] the horizon of the Sun amen and all of
[25:04] these things when you really look at him
[25:05] and you really begin to dig into it they
[25:07] all could met he was trying to get us to
[25:09] see something Amen that be careful a man
[25:14] of you must worship God in spirit and in
[25:19] truth
[25:20] amen we come to church and we worship we
[25:25] worship God and we say thank you we've
[25:27] some time like I said last week and we
[25:31] praise God the scriptures say we praise
[25:35] their moaning allow some but praise them
[25:36] on the high Sun but let everything that
[25:38] has breath praise the Lord now that's
[25:42] that synonymous with worship is
[25:43] definitely a part of worship but worship
[25:47] goes just a little bit farther than that
[25:50] and we'll dig into that just a little
[25:52] bit
[25:52] amen worship is the lifestyle that you
[25:55] live a man a worship is a condition of
[26:00] your heart amen
[26:03] you can praise the Lord but if your
[26:05] heart is not in the right place it's
[26:08] just empty noise amen it's just empty
[26:14] noise
[26:15] thank you brother amen Deuteronomy 16 we
[26:21] read from the first verse to observed a
[26:22] month of abiud and keep the past
[26:26] over unto the Lord thy God for in the
[26:31] month of Abib the LORD thy God brought
[26:35] thee forth out of Egypt by night and we
[26:40] know that Egypt types denominational
[26:43] bondage a man thou shalt therefore
[26:48] sacrifice the Passover unto the Lord thy
[26:52] God of the flock and the herd in the
[26:56] place which the Lord shall choose to
[27:00] place his name there thou shalt eat no
[27:05] leaven bread with it seven days shalt
[27:11] thou eat unleavened bread there with
[27:15] even the bread of affliction for thou
[27:18] camest forth out of the land of Egypt in
[27:21] haste and thou mayst remember the day
[27:24] when thou camest forth out of the land
[27:26] of Egypt all the days of their life and
[27:30] there shall be no leavened bread seen
[27:35] with Whitney and all the coasts within
[27:39] all the coasts seven days neither shall
[27:42] there anything of the flesh which thou
[27:49] sacrificed the first day at even remain
[27:55] all night until the morning
[27:58] thou mayst not sacrifice the Passover
[28:02] within any of thy gates which the LORD
[28:07] thy God giveth thee but in the place
[28:10] with the LORD thy God shall choose to
[28:14] place his name in thou shalt sacrifice
[28:19] the Passover and even at even the going
[28:25] down of the Sun at this at the season
[28:33] that thou camest forth out of Egypt and
[28:36] thou shall roast and eat it
[28:40] in the place which the LORD thy God
[28:42] shall choose and thou shall turn in the
[28:45] morning and go into the tenth six days
[28:48] thou shalt eat unleavened bread and the
[28:51] seventh day thou shalt be a solemn
[28:54] assembly to the Lord thy God and thou
[28:57] shalt do work there in seven days thou
[29:02] shalt number unto the unto thee being
[29:05] the number seven weeks from such time as
[29:10] the beginning to put the sickle in the
[29:12] corn and thou shalt keep the feast weeks
[29:16] unto the Lord thy God and tribute the
[29:19] freewill offering unto thine hand and
[29:21] shout down unto the Lord thy God
[29:23] according to the LORD thy God bless thee
[29:28] amen amen and we see basically this is
[29:33] going on the show that only in the Gates
[29:37] Worth where God shows the place his name
[29:42] is the only print only place Amen what
[29:46] he is going to accept worship the place
[29:50] where he chose to place his name amen
[29:55] bear with me Church we're going to see
[29:58] that that turn to turn here to of
[30:02] revelations amen let's look at
[30:06] revelations the 12th chapter
[30:15] revelation 12
[30:26] the seventh verse there's one provided
[30:30] place the place where he chose to place
[30:34] his name there amen before we do that
[30:43] lets go to the revelations thirteen
[30:47] revelations thirteen the eighth verse
[30:51] any read on this word says that and all
[30:57] that dwell upon the earth shall worship
[31:02] Him whose names are not written in the
[31:09] Lamb's Book of Life slain from the
[31:12] foundation of the world
[31:15] o that dwell upon the earth shall
[31:19] worship Him now how he's gonna see see
[31:24] everybody's gonna worship something
[31:28] everybody's gonna worship now what we
[31:30] want to do is make sure that we're not
[31:32] in this group because all whose name is
[31:36] not written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[31:39] will worship Him who was him now let's
[31:45] look at revelation 12 amen the seven he
[31:50] says and there was a war in heaven
[31:53] Michael and his angels fought against
[31:56] the Dragon and the dragon fought and his
[31:59] angels and prevailed not neither was
[32:04] there found place any more in heaven and
[32:08] the Great Dragon was cast out that old
[32:11] serpent called the devil and Satan which
[32:16] deceiveth the whole world I want you to
[32:21] pay attention to that right this which
[32:23] deceiveth the whole world now if it'll
[32:30] be so close that it'll deceive the very
[32:33] elect if it's possible
[32:37] it's not gonna be outside of religion
[32:43] Satan knows he looked back and he
[32:46] watched God and he wants to be like him
[32:51] so he's not trying to he's not trying to
[32:55] get people into the barroom he's not
[32:59] goal is not to get you all of the doing
[33:04] all kind of divine things it's just to
[33:07] get you off the word if he could just
[33:12] get you off the word because see it in
[33:15] heaven if it's not pure if it's not pure
[33:19] word then it's off the word because you
[33:22] can't divide God up and mix it with
[33:24] anything else it made me do the word is
[33:28] a CD and it is in its purity to produce
[33:31] a hybrid God would not produce after
[33:34] itself
[33:35] anything that's hybrid would not produce
[33:38] itself again it must remain pure the
[33:42] original water seed of God is the spoken
[33:46] word amen
[33:47] so we see here that isn't that the devil
[33:51] Satan which deceiveth the whole world
[33:54] this is how he's going to get these
[33:56] people here that all that dwell upon the
[33:59] earth shall worship Him whose names are
[34:02] not written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[34:04] why through the deception through
[34:09] misrepresenting the truth of the gospel
[34:11] you know and I say just so many people
[34:14] just believe that you could make it just
[34:17] be good we can just live a good life or
[34:20] we can just come to church and garden
[34:22] we'll just ask God once we get there
[34:25] no you won't get there you can't just
[34:29] what you better have you ever have a
[34:31] thirst of the hunger for a man for truth
[34:33] acknowledge now amen he who hunger and
[34:38] thirst after righteousness shall be fed
[34:42] amen if you love him you you you desire
[34:46] to know him amen he stole
[34:50] representation of it not just a good
[34:53] fluffy storybook type message to know
[34:57] him in a pal in the revelation that is
[35:04] what's going to produce the life in you
[35:10] Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive and
[35:16] he that word was that word was inspired
[35:20] but once it was inspired and he spoke it
[35:24] it was written and it laid there for
[35:27] hundreds of years as words on paper this
[35:32] Bible we have here is words on paper
[35:38] it's words on paper but it takes the
[35:43] inspiration of Almighty God to make
[35:47] these words live Isaiah said a virgin
[35:53] shall conceive and two thousand years
[35:57] later a man the anointing fell on those
[36:01] words amen and an angel came to a virgin
[36:05] and said you have been highly favored
[36:08] what was it this day those scriptures
[36:11] was being fulfilled and the penis of
[36:14] that word what did it do created a life
[36:17] in the womb of Mary the very word that
[36:22] was spoken by the Prophet 2,000 years
[36:25] ago became life at that point because
[36:30] his word was not saw it will produce
[36:35] amen glory to God now we see that uh the
[36:43] phagon was cast on that serpent called
[36:45] the devil Satan wish to see the whole
[36:48] world he was cast out of the earth cast
[36:53] out into the earth and his angels was
[36:56] cast with him amen you know
[37:04] in the message there how can I overcome
[37:09] the Prophet said that this is the
[37:14] greatest age of deception there was you
[37:20] see because like I spoke earlier that
[37:23] that there's been two hundred thousand
[37:28] thousand demons loose from the river
[37:30] Euphrates
[37:31] that's all congestion in this one time
[37:35] with fighting all kind of demonic
[37:38] spirits amen that's why out of all of
[37:42] the light of the gospel that we have in
[37:46] this age amen there is a maturing of
[37:49] every see a man with there's a maturing
[37:53] of the faucet see we see what happened
[37:58] in in the beginning when when when Cain
[38:02] couldn't give his way the Bible said
[38:04] that he became Ross in his spirit amen
[38:07] and he slew his brother amen and we look
[38:11] at the same spirit that came down when
[38:16] Jesus amen they they chose they chose a
[38:22] thief and a robber over Christ Jesus
[38:27] what happened they became that priest
[38:30] said they became Roth in a spirit insult
[38:33] to kill the word same spirit let me tell
[38:38] you something my brothers and sisters
[38:40] there's an ecumenical council amen
[38:45] that hates the bride why because our
[38:49] very presence and of our very stance on
[38:52] the word they look at us like we're the
[38:55] problem they are wrong in their spirit
[38:59] but see they come in in such a soft
[39:05] raiment
[39:06] I'll give you an example they say well
[39:09] well we're supposed to just love
[39:13] everybody
[39:14] love everybody and then they allow
[39:19] homosexual marriages in the churches and
[39:23] call it Christian love they allow women
[39:30] and different things to be priests and
[39:33] leaders in it and call it Christian
[39:36] don't want to offend nobody but you our
[39:40] faith in God
[39:41] where is your love for him that evil
[39:47] over here because that's not who you
[39:49] worship you are standing during the
[39:54] pulpit of Satan Amen why she is actually
[39:58] being watched and people go and don't
[40:00] realize it sit and take part of it and I
[40:07] all got this church that uses at the end
[40:10] of the service they would get down and
[40:11] they would put out to chat and say the
[40:13] doors of the church is now but it's not
[40:18] about the doors of the church is being
[40:21] opened what about the door of your heart
[40:25] being open the door of your heart and
[40:29] it's not about you joining the church
[40:31] but letting Christ into your heart and
[40:34] your life you become a member of the
[40:37] body through a verse you can't join the
[40:42] church you have to be born into it but
[40:45] they tell people that all you gotta do
[40:48] just come come sitting and chatting
[40:51] different ones and the mother letter
[40:53] churching the elders and one they come
[40:56] and shake your hand and put your name on
[40:58] the roll and send you out to go and tell
[41:01] you now just keep coming to church and
[41:03] you'll be all right
[41:08] shame on all in the name of Christianity
[41:11] that God is not getting no worship from
[41:15] that not one iota
[41:19] but it's Scott's us so many are the
[41:24] scene by right hand fellowship
[41:28] and coming there and blow these Creed's
[41:30] and dogmas but denying the power of the
[41:35] word the revelations of the truth in
[41:38] this hour
[41:39] a man god of this evil age the prophet
[41:43] says the devil's unholy spirit is
[41:46] calling his church by the error of
[41:49] perversion the devil's unholy spirit is
[41:56] calling his church worship it is an
[42:06] attitude of the heart towards God's Word
[42:13] outside of that there is no worship
[42:18] there is going through the motions but
[42:21] your worship is empty your worship is
[42:26] yes you going through just just the
[42:30] scriptures say you worship me or with
[42:35] your lips but your heart is far from me
[42:37] a man
[42:46] Bible say there in John the second
[42:50] chapter 15 verse love not the world
[42:53] neither the things of the world If any
[42:56] man love the world and the love of the
[42:59] father is not in it for all that is of
[43:03] the world the luster yard lust of the
[43:05] flesh and the pride of life is not of
[43:08] the Father but of the world and the
[43:14] world passeth away and the lust thereof
[43:18] see the Prophet told us we won't have
[43:20] those things to worry about when we get
[43:21] on the other side because those emotions
[43:25] of those glands won't be there a man and
[43:28] his wife was I said well he who you're
[43:31] gonna love the most me just a first wife
[43:36] or the second wife
[43:37] he said well you won't have that problem
[43:39] because those those we won't have them
[43:41] to just be perfect love there'll be no
[43:44] more lust that stuff is gonna burn up
[43:47] here it'll be over with we'll have
[43:50] different bodies you don't have to worry
[43:52] about those kind of things a man and the
[43:57] world passes away in the lust thereof
[43:59] but he that doeth the will of God
[44:03] abideth for ever you see he that doeth
[44:08] his will so we found that the service of
[44:13] the Lord must be done in his will and
[44:18] his will is in the truth of the gospel
[44:23] now I'm not talking about as the Prophet
[44:27] said in trying to do God a service and
[44:29] and I'm I won't get into it because I'm
[44:33] saving that there's five things that you
[44:38] must have to do God's will the first he
[44:42] said it must be in his time and season
[44:47] he said imagine if Moses started
[44:51] building a boat saying I'm a goin get
[44:54] the children be German and sell them
[44:56] down the Nile are we gonna sail to
[44:58] freedom
[44:59] no it was not time for that that was
[45:03] Noah's day imagine it must be the word
[45:12] must be the word for that day he said it
[45:17] must be in his time and his season I
[45:20] mean that's why I brought out not long
[45:22] after that he he preached a message
[45:24] spiritual food and due season man the
[45:28] price it was isn't something my
[45:29] brother's assistance to see how all of
[45:31] these measures fell together one behind
[45:33] the other and the next thing was it must
[45:39] be according to his word
[45:42] it must be according to his word amen I
[45:46] didn't I didn't I didn't write them all
[45:48] down here but it's following we'll get
[45:50] into it we're getting to it sometime but
[45:52] it's five months amen
[45:54] that when you're doing saying one of the
[45:56] main things that must be his will you
[45:58] can't do something you you can have be
[46:01] sincere we see David was sincere in
[46:04] trying to bring the Ark of the Covenant
[46:05] back to the camp but he consulted the
[46:08] wrong people he consulted the host of
[46:11] the army and the different was but he
[46:13] never consulted the process never
[46:17] consulted the prophet and it cost a man
[46:19] his life she going outside of the will
[46:22] of God doing the service you could cause
[46:24] no damage then then then good amen
[46:32] the message choosing God's provided
[46:37] place of worship
[46:38] amen 1965 February 20th paragraph 38
[46:51] page 8 I've been wanting to say that
[46:56] a man
[47:06] he says here then we see by the very
[47:12] creature CH denomination is left far
[47:17] behind let me let me go back let me go
[47:21] back a little bit now all the feasts and
[47:23] holidays of the holidays all the
[47:25] Tabernacles all the wood everything in
[47:29] the tabernacle everything typed Christ
[47:31] all the offerings and the laws that
[47:33] everything was in tight of Christ we've
[47:38] been through it time after time here at
[47:41] the Tabernacle he says then we see by
[47:45] these that every Creed church and
[47:48] denomination is left far behind it's not
[47:52] even in the race at all every Creed
[47:55] every church every denomination is
[47:58] completely left out there is no place
[48:02] for them at all nothing is typed in the
[48:05] Old Testament or anywhere in the Bible
[48:08] that the church but the forced unity of
[48:14] the babbles tower that that's the only
[48:18] thing that types the unity because it
[48:22] was by Nimrod a wicked man who went out
[48:26] and forced all the little countries to
[48:33] become into one place and the end and in
[48:36] this great tower it was a religious
[48:40] worship of course but not considered in
[48:44] the Word of God so there were you see
[48:50] denominational religion typed in the
[48:52] Tower of Babel in the Old Testament
[48:56] which this religion is certainly a
[48:59] religion but not the religion of the
[49:03] Word of God God has not chose to put his
[49:06] name in any denomination he wanted us he
[49:12] says I want in the scripture for it if
[49:16] it is I know that I know
[49:20] they claim he has but he hasn't he has
[49:25] not put his name in many places because
[49:29] he said he put his name in one place and
[49:34] that one place each one of our
[49:39] denominations want to say that there
[49:42] that place but it's contrary but where
[49:47] did he put his name now he now and he
[49:53] what is his name first of all we have
[49:56] the name we find that God's name is
[50:00] before we can find what he were he
[50:04] putting it in place now we find out that
[50:10] he had many titles he's called the
[50:15] Father which is a title he's called the
[50:20] son which is a title he's called the
[50:24] Holy Ghost which is a title he's called
[50:27] the Rose of Sharon which is a title he's
[50:32] called the lily of the valley which is a
[50:34] title he's called the morning star
[50:38] he's called Jehovah Jireh Jehovah Rapha
[50:43] it's the seven different compound names
[50:46] of redemption names of all that they are
[50:50] all titles amen none of them were names
[50:57] but he has a name and when mote when he
[51:02] met Moses he had not the name yet but he
[51:07] told Moses I am that I am and when we
[51:13] see Jesus on earth speaking in Hebrews
[51:17] the six chapters I'm sorry I beg your
[51:19] pardon John the six chapters he said I
[51:22] am that I am they said why your man not
[51:29] over 50 years old and say that you seen
[51:34] Abraham he said before Abraham was I am
[51:38] that I am see the one the burning bush
[51:43] in the pillar of fire that was the
[51:46] burning bush back there in the days of
[51:48] Moses I am that I am and now we find out
[51:54] that Jesus said also I come in my
[51:58] father's name and you received me not
[52:01] then the name of the father must be
[52:04] Jesus that write the name of the father
[52:07] is Jesus because Jesus says so I carry
[52:10] my father's name I come in my father's
[52:15] name and they received me not and Jesus
[52:20] and he said Gabriel called him Jesus and
[52:28] the prophets called him Jesus and he was
[52:34] absolutely Jesus before his birth even
[52:38] the holy prophet called him name
[52:41] Emmanuel which means God with us and we
[52:46] see that when marry a man like Gabriel
[52:51] came and told Mary that she was highly
[52:56] favored it was the angel that told him
[53:01] you would call him Jesus you're not
[53:06] going to just pick the name you were
[53:07] Joseph get together and just pick a name
[53:09] I'm gonna tell you what his name is and
[53:13] and and what was it it was that work he
[53:16] had chosen already before the foundation
[53:20] of the world a man but he who had chosen
[53:22] already the place his place of worship
[53:26] amen the place where they could it's
[53:31] going to be in that name of Jesus amen
[53:34] and to prove it that when when when Mary
[53:37] went to Elizabeth's and told her like
[53:40] the angel and everything had came true
[53:42] and told her that the neck the child's
[53:45] name would be Jesus
[53:48] amen that prophet that was in the belly
[53:51] of Elizabeth leap for joy amen why cuz
[53:56] he recognized that name even being a
[53:59] child not even going you recognize that
[54:03] name why because it was the lamb slain
[54:06] before the foundation of the world
[54:08] knowing that the redemption is drawing
[54:11] man see it was altogether dead even even
[54:15] then before they was even breathed the
[54:19] breath of air they were still just cells
[54:22] in the in the in the window in the wombs
[54:25] of these two women they came together
[54:27] the word came to the prophet and the
[54:31] Prophet received the Holy Ghost right in
[54:33] the womb recognizing that that name
[54:36] there is a name to worship that name
[54:39] above everything
[54:41] amen and we see even today even in our
[54:46] denominational churches even anything
[54:48] what was it it was the word for that
[54:51] date being manifest now they'll say well
[54:55] it's just Jesus and we're worshipping
[54:58] Jesus but the same thing is happening
[55:00] today my brothers and sisters amen we've
[55:04] had a prophet in this hour
[55:06] amen of stop that have came Amen just
[55:10] like John the Baptist to show you the
[55:12] father's appearing to show you that he's
[55:14] come again and you're doing the same
[55:16] thing you're recognizing not but you say
[55:21] we're worshiping Jesus you're worshiping
[55:24] that historical event you're worshiping
[55:27] me Satan has deceived you once again
[55:33] amen but it's not possible a man for the
[55:38] bride to be deceived
[55:40] amen to him that hath an ear cuz they
[55:43] have something he said my sheep know my
[55:46] voice any man we're talking about
[55:49] worship where do we worship how do we
[55:53] worship how do we serve the Lord there's
[55:56] a certain place that we have to worship
[55:59] we can't worship in any gate
[56:01] we can't worship it is a condition of
[56:04] the heart that he receives our worship
[56:08] amen
[56:09] may the Lord at a blessing hey man we're
[56:11] gonna stop right there
[56:13] amen and that hopefully another time
[56:16] that we can come back and there's more
[56:18] to it a man because when you when you go
[56:21] back and you look at the birth we're
[56:25] talking about there when we're married
[56:28] but we go back and we continue to the
[56:30] the journey of Mary a man and when she
[56:34] went into Bethlehem the place of God
[56:40] place of bread amen and and and and and
[56:44] into a manger how those three wise men
[56:46] what did they follow they followed a
[56:50] star that star was a reflection of the
[56:53] Sun amen and we had a star coming this
[56:58] day a man that is leading us what back
[57:02] to that to Christ again leading us
[57:06] leading us to the revealed Word amen
[57:11] amen the knows that star shine amen and
[57:15] in the manger the Prophet brought out he
[57:17] says not a manger is in your heart
[57:22] I was speaking earlier about that the
[57:25] doors are the church being opening they
[57:27] know there's a let him be born if
[57:29] there's no room in the end there's no
[57:32] room for him in the denominational
[57:34] churches they have too many programs and
[57:37] I you know I talk to certain people and
[57:40] they say well I'm going to this church
[57:41] because I like B programs I like the
[57:44] program where they got things for the
[57:46] kids and and maybe they got things on
[57:50] the holidays little programs and things
[57:52] like that is it no no room for Christ in
[57:55] the end because you got too many
[57:58] programs but open up your heart since
[58:03] there's no room in the end opened up the
[58:05] manger of your heart and let Christ be
[58:07] birthday within your heart

[58:23] stand we're gonna we're gonna stop it
[58:26] right there we don't want to go past our
[58:29] time I see keep going on that because
[58:33] it's just so much with when we go from
[58:36] there talking about a true worship and
[58:41] the true service and and and look at the
[58:45] the the events that when the Prophet was
[58:50] bringing these things out and all of the
[58:52] messages that sort of lined up and what
[58:54] they were really saying my god it's just
[58:59] something a man Church we're getting
[59:01] ready to go home amen we're living in
[59:04] Satan's Eden amen but God amen is
