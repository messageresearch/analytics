hallelujah blessed be his holy name bless it be his holy name amen you can be seated amen in the house of the lord amen it's good to be here in the house of the lord on today and man we thank god for all things uh i know that we have a couple of announcements that i will make mention of um [Music] and then so we have a service on wednesday night and just just so i don't forget to tell you all [Music] for this month of december we have been given our regular service times on sundays and wednesdays but we we're not going to be able to do our new year's eve service that we typically do every year so i want to just encourage um that maybe we can go to one of the other churches in the area maybe brother west goes or something like that for the new year's eve service but we won't be able to have it here at the school so amen the lord knows all things amen and uh but wednesdays and fridays wednesdays and fridays will be our normal schedule amen um during this week the week of new year's i'm sorry christmas and new year's typically they have nobody here at the school and so anybody that has to come has to come from somewhere to be here and uh and i know us you know um i know it might be a little challenge to try to get somebody to come 10 o'clock at night to be here for us amen uh as we're going to new year so it's it's quite all right it's perfectly fine god knows all things and amen and this is just a season amen it's just a season so uh just want to just make mention that before i forget but wednesday we'll be here at 7 30. uh we continue to stream via twitter and facebook and one of the new things that just happened thank god for brother quinton jr a working on this but he had we have a setup now where we can stream right from the church website so if you don't have twitter and if you don't have facebook which is quite all right that you don't have it you can go right to the church website and still see the service on wednesdays and fridays just go spirit and truth tabernacle.org and you'll see the live stream link there so thank god for that thank god for that amen i was telling the brothers that um a friend of mine she i used to work with her years ago and i right now it's got to be over 10 years maybe i can't remember somewhere in that that that that that range but uh i remember um she'd um come to my desk one day while i was in the office and she says um she say uh jack um talk to me about tithing talk to me about tithing say where where you where are you supposed to pay your tithes to i say okay well my understanding you pay your tithes where you get fed that's where you pay your time wherever you're getting fed at that's where you pay your times she say okay all right i appreciate that she came back about a week later with an envelope in her hand she said jack i'm bringing my times i say uh you supposed to pay where you get fish you say i get fed every time i sit here and talk to you so i'm bringing my ties and from that day to this day that sister has been paying tives and um and recently she i was talking to us to say i don't have facebook and i don't have um all the social media and uh she said but you know i was watching y'all service tonight you know i can't see it anymore since things change i say you know what we're going to get this thing back up and running because if it's just for one person if it's just for one person we'll we'll go through great extremes just to try to get to that one and uh so i appreciate amen uh brother clinton uh working on that and and um i mean if if this one soul makes it into the kingdom you know god will give credit to brother quinton [Music] you know that so everything that uh the brothers do everything that the sisters do it means so much and i'm i'm very uh those brothers know i'm very very particular about you know make sure the camera here make sure it's there because uh people watching and sometimes anointing be here you want them to capture every part of the service who that's screaming put the camera on on that screaming person who jumping and shouting like that put the camera we got to see what's going on in the church man when i'm at home streaming i say man what's going on cameraman camera man give me something please and i said i say always try to keep the preacher and the quote in order to keep it all together because we want to see it all not just part of let us see it all right so everything means something brothers and amen and our sisters amen that do the words all of that means so much it means so much so we thank god uh uh for this so um let me also just mention so virtual prayer this tuesday night sisters will be um attending virtual prayer um and if you would like to be a part of that just see sister erica you know she'll make sure that you uh can get in to to be a part of the virtual prayer um there is an event that's coming up and i will um i just want to make mention of this and i want to start now because uh this is something you have to register for but their brother stacy goodbread is doing a marriage conference uh they call it a time to reconnect and they're doing that in orlando on the week of the weekend of march 4th and march 5th and you know he had mentioned it to me i saw him earlier um earlier this year we were in um i can't think uh we're at the the men's meeting and he told me about this conference i say he said when i said when you gonna do it brother he said march i say brother what time in march and uh and he said he told me the weekend said brother i can't be there i can't be there my daughter is getting married and so he actually changed the dates to march 4th and march 5th so it would not conflict and and my prayer is that some of us from this church will be able to go and

this morning amen it's good to see everybody let's just get our bibles out this morning amen i tell you what we we've been hearing some some good word these last couple of weeks and uh i i tell i told jack yesterday about troy troy hill like to miss nothing and he called me after i got home i just got home and bro how was how was everything i said bro you you just missed it i said bro jack broke bread up in that place i've i've been i've been doing funnels with brother jack for a little minute we kind of sometimes he's there with me and sometimes i'm there with him uh and uh i tell you what he put together one and my wife was was on the piano and he got to a point and she started playing i said what almighty god we serve amen you know it's it was one of those times especially being in a baptist church you could have took out your handkerchief and just said preach doc just just help yourself maybe y'all don't know nothing about that but uh i'm a little older than everybody else you know and uh you know growing up growing up in the baptist church uh when things would get real anointed and the preacher get to preaching you might see his mother swinging her hanky and somebody run up and i tell you what but uh amen it was really it was really wonderful amen and i you know i just appreciate uh the season that we're in and and we're going to be looking at psalms 11 and psalms 112. um and uh just being i identified with with brothers that's that understands the gift is the ability to get yourself out of the way brother capers used to always say this uh in okeechobee you know the holy ghost wants to preach all right and uh he can't preach if you in the way you know uh you trying to be impressive and all of that you know uh if you get out of the way uh he can he can say some things that that'll really help people and and i'm not i'm not polished i'm not polished my grandma's not that good and i don't i don't put on ass don't don't get the suit mistaken you know uh i'm i am who i am i have some ebonics and and sands and things of that nature but i just hope the holy spirit uh can take the things that we're attempting to say and and and bring it and and open it up to our hearts is that all right amen psalms 1 11 we want to start at the maybe the ninth verse he says he sent redemption unto his people he has commanded his covenant forever holy and reverent is his name the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom a good understanding have all they that do his commandments his praise and doeth forever let's go to psalms 112 it says praise you the lord blessed is the man that feareth the lord that delighteth greatly in his commandments his seed shall be mighty upon the earth the generation of the upright shall be blessed wealth and riches shall be in his house and his righteousness endureth forever until the upright there writes light in the darkness uh he is gracious and full of compassion and righteousness a good man sure favor and lendeth he will guide his affairs with discretion gracious father we just come this morning to give thanks and praise for just allowing us this opportunity to be here this morning and uh we we just trust that you help us to say uh the things that you desire to be said and close our mouth to the things that you don't want said and uh we're just here to try to uh bless your people encourage us lift us up anchor us in the things of god we just appreciate you we appreciate this ministry we appreciate uh brother jack and his just his stan and just the the officers of the church lord we just thank you oh god for all things because we know that you're a provider and we just keep before you the promises that you've made us lord in jesus christ's name amen amen you may be seated we um we this morning we want to preach on the generation of the upright part three right um there's some other things that uh we we i guess we have on our heart to preach but i just felt led to just continue on with uh what we've been uh ministering on because for me i think it's uh it's been a blessing to me and trusting that it's been a blessing to to all of us um because you know um it's it's righteousness versus unrighteousness you know there's there's always uh what people don't understand is always a law contrast in every age there's been a law of contrast when when jesus was on the scene uh there was a law of contrast down through the history of the scriptures from from the sea chapter of the bible there's been a a long contrast and uh man we we and i'm not sure how far i'm gonna get but um i'm just gonna go until my time is up but there's a lot of things that we we want to just kind of kind of deal with because you know we we've we had a prophet on the scene and i think we're still up under the son of man ministry under this eagle anointing and there's a lot of things that's been preached and and i just like brother brother jack's um last couple of messages just trying to um get us to a place that uh if we don't understand we're gonna understand glory right i remember the first time i ever heard that quote uh i heard that back in the thunder in a thunder meet with brother coleman brother coleman read that quote and i was a real young convert and and i i just i just couldn't really fully grasp it but but as i i started ministering over the years you know i would always say that you're go you're gonna understand it but watch this if you're predestinated all right because everybody's not going to understand it everybody's not ordained to understand it is that right but the predestinator those that were in the mind of god before the foundation of the world amen uh they're gonna understand it amen is that right right because they were they were a part of god they come from god and they're gonna go back to god right right amen so so you know whether we we want certain people to get it especially in ministry you'd be wanting folks to get it right and sometimes folks just don't get it right that's right right that's right but the elect is going to get it amen that right because it's it's here for us uh in in our first couple of segments we we was trying to help us to you know identify ourselves see see where we where we where we are sometimes we don't realize certain uh uh ideologies and things carry spirits amen right things things carry spirits and in the wrong kind of spirits that right i want to be up under the right umbrella the the right thing is that right amen i don't know about you right regardless of what the wall is doing see one of the things i realized i come out of the world right right amen i come out of the world and and bro god brought me into something that i believe is pure right i believe the the the opening of the word the revealing of christ is pure the understanding that's been revealed is pure all right now now man has tainted it but it's things that i hold on to the brother man he he said man he he was going on for for some time and and and the thing never denominated one thing i realized you cannot denominate the word brother jack been talking about this the word cannot and will not be denominated amen people may try to but there's a people that's ordained of god for this hour not to be denominated [Applause] see not to come under a denominational spirit not to have a denominational attitude we even have to be careful because of what we have that we don't have this this attitude glory because we do we walk around with it with an attitude like we feel like we it's not that right we just thank god that we're chosen right we're chosen by god to live in this hour and and be the light of the age well i don't want to get ahead of myself let me put my glasses back on so i can read the bible a little bit because i i tell you what i feel good this morning with all this anointing up in here it'll make a man that ain't called to preach me preach all right [Music] glory oh my but but but let us just kind of uh get a handle on some things this morning um here here we we kind of left off right here and and this one we want to start out in in psalms uh 111 and uh because he he talked about we were talking about the works of of of god and all of the things that he'd done but but he says in the ninth verse he said he sent redemption unto his people thank god for that right amen right thank god for redemption because if it wasn't for that we'd still be like john on the out of patmos crying right right if nobody stepped step forward we we we'd be in a mess is that right when the angel called john john looked and he didn't see anybody worthy the bible said he wept yeah that didn't last long thank you jesus for that a lamb came forward aren't you glad about it boy that didn't feel good i'm gonna say that again aren't you glad about it i'm gonna say that again aren't you glad about it i don't know about you i'm tickled to death to be redeemed [Music] i have i have no desire amen to to want to live in the world and do the things that i did before christ i i thought in the beginning those things were were fun and entertaining but i realized you know what that's just like the enemy right things start out subtle you know you might still little weed here and a little sip here next time you know you find yourself out there prostituting and everything else oh glory to his wonderful name so i'm glad for redemption this morning he sent redemption unto his people he has commanded his covenant forever holy and reverend is his name now now this is part we we really want to start out uh it says the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom a good understanding have uh have all they that do his commandments his praises and do endures uh forever now you can't advance forward without a starting point right you cannot advance forward without a starting point and our starting point is is reverence all right to almighty god that's that's the it's because it's the beginning it's the starting point you can forget going on to adoption and all these other things if you do not respect god and god is his word see we we try to we try to divide things is that right he and his word is the same right see he and his word is the same you can't love him without loving his word you cannot separate him from his word right right amen so he says the it's the reverence of the law is the beginning that's the starting point that's that might be the reason why people don't go that far and go right because a lot of times we try to attribute it to a man all right man is only god's agent right he's just the instrument that god chose amen to to use as a channel to express a uh what was in his mind amen that right he could have chose to win he could have chosen duncan duncan spoke one time is that right a ducky did speak so god could have chose that but he chose man to identify with man is that right glory to god but but we we gotta have reverence amen man i'm gonna tell you something we're living in a gener amongst a generation because i'm a part of the generation upright but we're living a part i'm a generation that has no reverence that that has no respect they have their own ideas and their own way of thinking about things and and i'm i'm real i'm old school but but old school is new school because the scripture says he required that which is past and and i realized that you know uh uh uh the true starting point is to go back to the bible back to the beginning and see what god started the thing out with yeah see because we we we got so many i i maybe i'll get to it this morning because we we have so many so many things and so so many uh uh uh outlets that that people are using but people are causing a lot of damage doing a lot of damage right and and in every setting you got to be careful uh uh with what you hear because people spew out their their their their ideologies and their opinions and things of that nature that amen i find a lot of times that's contrary to the word of god come on come on it's the truth anyhow and you know i know uh i said blogs last time but y'all know what i'm talking about podcast right i mean right amen uh uh we we're using these things but we're using these things out of context all right out out of out of order i hope i can get to where i want to go this morning because because one one thing you know in studying i realized everything falls up under a man an umbrella and an order and things that we cannot get away from we can't bypass we can't go around right is that right but this is the thing that we find but this is why we got chaos if could you imagine god's heavenly host right getting out of order all right it'll be it'll be oh chaos yeah yeah that's right right it'll be chaos that's right if the moon decided he didn't want to do his job if the sun decided he wouldn't want to if the stars start you know falling and we got chaos it's mass chaos and see this is what we have today we have mass chaos because every everything and everybody's moving out of amen it's intended position right worry the from that from the men to the women to the children everybody's out of position and this is why we got amen gross darkness but thank god this is why we ought to thank god that we had the voice of god to summon thank angel to come and to line up things amen uh based upon the word the thoughts in the mind of god not his opinions not his feelings i'm so tired of people's opinion opinion and feelings and and all of that you know i'm a pretty easygoing guy for the most part i i shirt things off some a lot of times but i'd be like man you're not pulling that over on me right that's that's not you know that's that's foolishness we we want to be in in in the will and word of god right we want to understand what god's for perspective is in all things uh let us let us maybe read the scripture or so and uh we'll we'll try to pick up some more speed right like i say uh i'm not uh brother jews you should say he was a helicopter but i'm not a helicopter psalms 119 verse one it says blessed are the undefiled in the way who walketh in the law of the lord blessed are they that keep his testimonies right right these things mean something to god and that seek him with their whole heart glory to god see the problem that a lot of folk have is that we we we we want the world and we want we want we we just want a little bit of church to make us feel good all right we don't want anybody calling us up on the phone and i just wonder when a person gets the baptism on the holy ghost they can't hardly work to the church door's open it's just something about going to church man it's like boy i can't hardly sleep i don't know how people lay in the bed on a sunday morning i can't do it my god my eyes has been so trained to pop open at a certain time and if i try to lay down would be miserable i just got to get up put on my clothing and hit the road yeah is that right sometimes folk just have all kind of excuses why they not going all right glory well oh i look back come on you better be hurting all week long but you go to work y'all don't talk to me you you start you start thinking about missing that money out your check you get up that's right get up i've been like that i've been like that my my whole working life boy when you build your check up to a certain amount you don't want to see 200 out of your check that's right that's right 150 200 300 man i'm going i'm hardly making it well y'all ought to see me on monday jesus thank god for advils and leaves a lot couldn't make it huh once they kick in i feel like i'm 20 years old but when they start wearing off oh love but we do that all week long and sunday morning all right i know sometimes when you're sick and can't make it you just can't make it i ain't saying that yeah but let's not give god okay let me let me keep moving uh he said uh uh third verse you say uh they also do iniquity they walk in this way he says uh thou has commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently that's commandment by god it's it's not something that we we throw to the side right amen he said oh that my ways were directed to keep his statues what a powerful statement come on because a lot of times people wait see we we got to realize uh the generation that we're living in uh did and i think me and brother troy was talking about this in this hour that we're living in here's the bad part we have had a mouthpiece we have had a prophet but people are doing what's pleasing in their own sight though right right like we've not had a prophet watch watch the spirit that's moving amongst the church because when i got saved back in 88 you know uh uh i was i'm a little bit older than brother jack and brother troy and uh we we we had a reverence and a respect to our pastor they trump brother troy was mad by the time you know i met him and brother jack wasn't married and i wasn't married and but i was older i was an adult i had kind of grew up the rough side of the mountain kind of raised myself and and but when brother westco called for the young people i was identified with them right whether whether i knew what was going on or not when he said young people brother smiley had to go all right and and knowing that you know what uh i'm you know of this mind that man who this man is the name man he'll tell me who what to do and where to go and what to do for all that all right you know you know i had that was my my mentality at first but then when the holy ghost drops in your heart you humble yourself amen to authority this is the problem we had the problem we're having in the home this is the problem we have in the church we're having this problem in the school we having this problem everywhere right everybody's doing what's pleasing and and nobody wants to be under the authority but that scripture that scripture come on you know the women in this day say well you know uh all we want is to take your name but we want to wear what we want to wear we want to do what we want to do we want to be our own head we want to be our own boss because now we make our own money and we strong uh african-american women all right and we strong caucasian women not too right and and we strongly and we educated and we got our own credit cards and we got uh and and we're smarter than you and all that you might be intellectually most smarter but that don't mean you smart all right all right cause you got see sometimes here's the problem we have even in church as lay members relate to to pastors because you think you intellectually smart you think you're smarter than the man all right right come on right now pastor for 23 years and i know because people feel like they can use bigger words than i can that that they're smarter than that than me all right not so all right see because i have experience i have a gift and i have the holy ghost revealing all right i have a here's the crazy thing people that you teach feel like hey man they're smarter than you all right and you there because you've been the instrument that have taught them and that have brought them to the place that they had right people come to church with their lives in a wreck messed up and everything else and god by inspiration using the tools transform your life transform relationships transform marriages and then we get to a place we get puffed up and we feel like man we no more he's like really wow i remember you when you first came in the door just how jacked up you was yes how messed up amen we were in our mind in our thinking is that right because amen we had a worldly way of thinking a kind of way of thinking and and that thinking was was was uh built because of our environments and because of uh you know our traditions and i'm i'm jamaican and i'm haitian and i'm american and that's nonsense you got to lay those things down i don't care if you come from the other side of the world you got to lay those things down because there has no place in the gospel amen well praise the lord amen well i might have to have a part 4 and 5 before i get finished with this but but i'm just built a little bit different i just i have a lot of stuff but i go get to it when i get to it but it's a lot to be said amen brother branham preached the god of this evil age he preached satan eating what for what reason to identify for us amen to spirits right glory to god satan is the god of this evil age and and and we have to be careful we see this why i thank god that he came down with an open book handed it to his mouthpiece and he handed it to the ministry and it's constantly being unfolded to us amen uh sister lewis used to say in this song uh beat us strong and little by little and the bible says it's here a little there a little line upon line preach up upon precept is that right right glory to god amen hallelujah yes all right i'm uh i'm a leader and see if i can get back over here okay y'all all right amen glory to god i'm gonna talk fast cause i talk fast when i get get anointed but y'all go back and listen again i have i have to do it myself hallelujah okay so he says the fear the lord is the beginning of wisdom a good understanding have have all they that do his commandments see when when you find people not doing the word it shows they lack spiritual understanding all right all right all right and this be this be i i the battle of the ministry right and like brother brothers jack and i realized you know this is tying in with brother jack's previous two messages right yeah you're going to understand it right see it like like raising children the first thing that they ask you because they lack spiritual understanding or they just like understanding it is why right come on church y'all like like y'all ain't had no ain't got no children some of y'all may not but y'all with children and y'all ask y'all mama why why can't i why can't i go over to you know jimmy's house and why can't i do this and why can't i wear this and why why why why the reason why you ask why is because you lack understanding when when our understanding becomes fruitful you stop asking why you you understand i understand why my dad does not want me to go here why he does not want me to go there why he does not want me to deal with this person right why my mama won't let me do this why she want to keep me away from there right right but but when we like understanding like you know you know for me it's things that i fought in raising my children it's things that i did not let them do and i was constantly constantly under the microscopes and you know my family members and i got five boys huh and and and you know what i don't boys playing sports you know it's a hard thing to tell a sports oriented family that you'll find boys especially knowing that i played sports all right right and possibly could have gone somewhere uh because of sports that i'm not allowing my kids to play sports i did not allow christina to play sports you say well why because i saw the spirit the spirit right because the all of these things carry a spirit and when people don't think nothing up we take our little you know uh doll out there and we get we got out there playing ball yes he can shake and bake and all that huh yeah see she's crossed over a man into a masculine people don't know nothing people they cross over into masculine domain you take on masculine spirit and so instead of you liking boys you start liking girls watch the percentage what's the percentage of women athletes and who they date [Music] [Applause] [Music] y'all don't talk to him up in here don't get cried on me today huh i understood these things see i wasn't trying to produce idols you know i looked at my boys anyway and i saw boy ain't nothing boys justin was flat-footed you could out walk him running his fastest feet going like this oh he ain't no athlete when he you know i remember when he was about on about two years old i took him to i i had moved back to the old neighborhood and uh we had a park up the street from my house i lived in our old house for two years and uh i took justin up to the park and man he fooled me he was up there he was you know i said well maybe that boy might have lost i'm sorry man as he got older i realized boy justin ain't no no he ain't gonna make no athlete i think the only two athletes i really had uh is william and nathan maybe cat maybe kevin but but nate see i understand my children i understand what i'm dealing with right right i know who's who i know justin is the intellectual i knew i didn't even realize i was prophesying over him when the day that he was born when he came out you know i was my wife was talking to me about you know what if you have a girl i was like okay yeah what if we have a girl you know that's fine that's right as soon as what she said is they say it's a boy preacher [Applause] i had already my wife looked at me she was like i thought you said yeah i know i did say that but when i said when i saw the boy you know automatically and i watched him i watched him grow in the church as a little boy right his whole life he sat on the front row two years old sitting on the front row and would fight with you amen because he wanted to wear a suit he didn't care how it looked the tire could be one thing the past could be one thing the jacket he just wanted to make sure that yeah huh sitting there with his little sippy cup huh justin never sat in the back of no church never and he you know his older kids and he gravitated towards the older kids and and and the musicians and man he started playing music he just had a gift i watched him yesterday at the funeral while gina was struggling i had called him up because i seen him standing in the back i told him going up here and uh he came up and i know i should probably shocked him like you you're my son i don't care where you go what you do those things don't matter you're going to be my son till the day i die right amen and so i called him up and and my wife she was struggling on that piano and i said go help your momma he just walked down there it won by two minutes he that was it he was riding with it and mama was looking at him i'm like yeah yeah he's a little more elevated because he listened to more stuff it's normally my normally my wife you know when she was playing all the time she don't play as much as she probably used to she would give her a second she got you sang whether it's country you know blue y'all know everybody don't say the same she got you but you you you know you you just kind of have to have this understanding right they couldn't understand what i was doing right it's a lot of things that that i kept them away from they couldn't understand it but i understood that you know what i have to follow the precepts and the commandments of god right amen right amen see there's a reproach that goes along with serving god there's a reproach that goes along with me and and no matter how much i preach it's it's everybody families in the church their sons playing sports but i knew the first time amen i would allow one of mine to play that's it that's it i remember i remember a brother told me that he said brother man i'ma tell you somebody said you ain't telling me nothing i don't already know i've been doing this for a little while i already know but i had got to a a point where i was kind of pressured and trying to hold everything together i i i had to make a decision i can't say today was the right decision but i had to make a decision to try to try to keep my family together amen right i i made a decision you know because i could have really been dog and then you know i would make statements right like i know i'm allowing it something to happen that i don't fully agree with but but i'm at a point and i'm i'm a man as much as the holy ghost is in me maybe i'm making this decision uh from from my manly standpoint by being a man by being a father from the word i don't think i'm making the right decision but i'm trying to hold together i'm trying to hold the church together see i made decisions and choices that the church folk didn't know that i was making it wasn't just for me it was for them too sometimes the shepherd got to do things amen for the sake of the people sometimes you got to be be looked at amen and take the wrong knowing you right right for the sake of the gospel right sometimes you just you just can't say something about everything there's times you you you make decisions and you do things and and you know people don't understand right right and and they they get to looking at yourself righteous and they say how could you be self-righteous at me and all y'all got all y'all children flipping on their head running track playing ball doing all of this but then i'm criticized the moment one of my children do anything right i gave you all the word y'all made a choice but the moment i tried to make a choice for all of us i got criticized i'm gonna leave that alone all right but i'm saying this just to kind of show us show us something how how folk lack spiritual understanding right amen for some things there's i mean we we got a manual right yeah we we got a manual um um um but you know you read and and you get the put put uh both so and so and a so-and-so and you got to find that boat and you got to find a saw and so in order to put that boat in there right because you you're building something you're building something see glory to god you got the manual but but you slowly just kind of so see see i'm saying something this morning as as people let's not be so critical let's not be so self-righteous right amen you know we we all ain't at the same place right we we we're not we're we're not we're not we're all still growing in all my years i'm still growing i've been growing up under brother jack and hearing brother cuico and brother troy and them and trusted after a while behind by we'll hear more brother jerry but but but i'm i'm growing i'm i'm sitting back you know you have to be a crazy person to get to a point where you stop learning you stop growing you can't this is inexhaustible right and and i'm gonna tell you something you know you you grow as a as a minister cause some things that i would have hammered when i first started that that you know you you get a little bit more easy i i i got friends that said why brothers i blasted them and i kind of cringe sometimes i say no i'm not trying to just blast people i'm trying to help i'm trying to help people grow they think different look at look at things from a more biblical yeah complete standpoint out of work right i'm just going to say this because i feel led to say this this morning right quick and i was going to try to bring it in a certain point but but something that i heard yesterday right uh as as it relates to to young people and you know i i say i was saying to myself uh if you say something to me i might not say nothing back to you about it but don't think you pass something over by me because it's very i it's just a lot that i just don't miss i may not say anything about a lot of things i'll laugh with you and have a good time and and just let you going on thank you fooled me with that but you know i was listening to the fella and uh i'm gonna try to just do it discreetly and just some of the comments i was like no i don't know some of that sounds good but when you look at that thing through uh the eyes of the word it's not good stop parenting your children what that's not scriptural that ain't scripture that's not scriptural that's right we've been we've been we've been called if i can i don't know how much time i get we've we've been we've been called to train up a child and the way it should go right i think sometimes the worst the worst mistake that my mother did she did the best that she could and i'm not i'm not condemning her for what she did was giving us so much leeway right i remember i i spoke to an old friend of mine uh maybe a few months back and he was saying he was saying will he said man man my daddy my daddy didn't let didn't let us do all of the things that y'all got a chance to do right i said he was a smart man he was a smart man for not allowing you not allowing amen you guys to do the things that we were doing because we were doing things at a young age that we should not have been doing i shouldn't have been smoking weed at no 11 years old come on come on i shouldn't have been gambling and all of this kind of stuff as a teenager right but but but because i had so much leeway right as a kid right you ain't even developed enough to make the right decisions for yourself praise god right most of the decisions that young people make ain't right the truth glory to god glory to god most of the decisions and and the people that are associated with bad choices right bad choices see so so think about this if i would have had a man there right a man there right with my mother that was spiritual that had good understanding let me let me just get right here right quick i'm gonna jump i'm gonna skip over right let's go to uh psalms 112. it says praise you the lord uh blessed is the man that feareth the lord that delighteth greatly in his commandments okay all right watch this blessed is the man notice this ain't no word play that's there's a reason why it said just like that right because there's an order to god amen that you can't get around see as as men we we got to realize we've been given uh a tremendous responsibility right i'm telling you church we've as as a man you know we have to make decisions and and we we got to be looked at funny and and all of that that right see brother browner makes a statement he says you know what uh i want y'all to understand it at that day you're gonna be hell responsible for her not her responsible for you amen well praise the lord i'm i'm right where i want to be at now amen right see everything else has to come up under this umbrella in order to be right it matters right the mark had a quote by lord help me help me if i have to do a part for i will right see as the man we've been given a position and a place in the economy of god in the perspective of god right see god had a perspective way back before let there yes sir be see when we look at genesis we see the expression of fatherhood come on we see the expression of fatherhood we see a man creating an environment right amen a place of protection right all all of this takes place when he was saying let there be this let there be that let there be this and then placing his children in a positioning place that wasn't for naught all right all right right amen god had had a plan in his mind god had thoughts god god he wanted to be a father right he wanted to express himself from fatherhood under understanding real true manhood and real true fatherhood you know watch something right as a man as a father he gave his children commandments right when they broke those commandments he come and he judged them yes yes right glory to god as a that's manhood right right brother branham talks about it in shalom he said these things are being broken down right it's in there i got the quotes but i know what's on here right all of these things is being broken down women want to be man man want to be women come on yeah right right and and sometimes like and i ain't even talking about uh uh where the man trying to dress like a woman and this and that the other and the woman taking off the skirt not even in that right we talk about domineering spirits being dominant being controlling right didn't i tell you i know i'm a clam up you what lord jesus help me oh lord i need you to help me help me on my journey [Music] help me on my way yeah you did not do that right i i get the sup get the moving in me like lord jesus that's that man part right right you you see it's kind of a role reversal and then we we we we put it on we make excuses and and i know it's a lot of it's a lot of women raising their children without a man a lot of that your fault well because see if if we were to stay with this commandment marriage is honorable and the bad is undefiled it'll be a whole lot of women married all right instead of all this you you you got to watch spirits and terminology baby daddy [Music] and baby mama man we had that foolishness when i was coming up so much uh uh i think brother capers never could testify to this they probably the oldest folk up in here uh it's just addiction them you had a you got pregnant at a young age you went up missing where dorothea oh she down south they don't sent you to the country somewhere where ain't nobody knows you why you was with child and then they ease you back back to town sometime without that baby well come on now it's a badge of honor huh well we we got our own money now we don't need a man you know we can we can adopt or we can have surrogates and we can do all of this kind of stuff and look at look how messed up this stuff is right men and men and women and women and all kind of foolishness and and then they could bypass the order of god the commandments of god and say we could be parents and then they they bring these kids up in this environment and they twist it [Music] they twist it see but but the scripture says the man that reverenced the lord is blessed and then he starts speaking right he starts speaking about uh his offsprings and things but he starts out why it's a reason it's the reason he didn't say the woman right because the woman is supposed to be under the hat ship of the man look at the scripture study the old testament it was the father that transferred the hat ship yes come on when when when when my niece get married brother jack will be glad right to stand up there and transfer hatshep right say buddy buddy uh uh uh i i raised her up a certain way and everything brother let me tell you something you got a real responsibility now when i when we change hand when they say who give this this bride to be your mother his mother and i buddy that's serious you can giggle and all that while y'all in white you're gonna giggle and play and cry when she coming down the island oh she looks so beautiful buddy that ain't the pressure all right huh you go on the honeymoon and you're taking selfies and and all of that and you feel like now i can kiss and all that uh-huh yeah you

next time uh uh and this is why when when i heard that i was like see you can't leave them to their own devices right you can't leave them to figure it out on their own right see that that's why god allows you to go through what you go through so when you have children see i never wanted my children to get high and do drugs and sell drugs and all of that they never saw me do that they've only heard me talk about it they've never heard me cuss i've never cussed out their mama i've never argued they never me and since gina been together we've been married 28 years been together 30 years they have never you say well it might have been times i might have felt like it but i didn't right because i heard so much of that when i was a young fella and i said brian growing up fussing and arguing and screaming and hollering and throwing pots and pans and knives and all of that see i saw my daddy throw a knife at my mama when i was about five years old it traumatized me i was waking up and i could see still see his hand today coming through the door he stepped through the door throw the knife in mister she left him see i didn't want to traumatize my my daddy always in there argue with my

use your words you're an intelligent man you can talk intelligent right you can be intelligent maybe this for somebody on the video huh you can be intelligent you can talk you you don't have to be screaming and hollering the neighbors coming all out the house and calling the popo and and all of that come on that's that's crazy right you acting out so bad and and now your kids growing up nervous because they don't know what you gonna do right they see you screaming and hollering at you you looking like you listen you borderline insane you one step from being legion come on now you one step from being somewhere in the graveyard cutting yourself right well y'all screaming and hollering and all of that kind of stuff you bought a line insane right then and then come on see i i just learned i learned i'm not overly intellectual but i'm i have a certain amount of intelligence and i use that if i feel like i cannot get my point across it's fine if you're not hearing me fine i'm not but i'm not going to wrestle with anybody about nothing right when i hear when i feel like you know people aren't hearing me i stopped talking come on because because we're not we're it shows you lack understanding you like understanding of my position right and you lack understanding of your position not preaching church all right come on all right y'all see y'all sister when i'm educated i'm this i'm that all right all right you ain't under the umbrella of god i tell you that when you do that there's there's a place because because a man is not going to use a woman as a doormat right but but as a man he wants to be respected if you can't respect me we we do have free problems that's for sure that's for sure we we do have a little problem i won't magnify no problems right as a man but we do have an issue because in my at any time amen it's just the same thing with god come on if you're not hearing god if you're not respecting this word i got to bring it back to the bible because y'all y'all quitting come on right glory to god any time you get to the place god says okay i'll stop talking to you ready to listen when you're ready to listen then we'll talk all right all right well he ain't saying that no because i know when that when i say something you're not hearing me you're not hearing me you you already got your own perspective you you got your mind made up and then no no no no no we don't we don't have to wrestle with things right god you think god gonna wrestle with me over his word huh no god said okay you ain't ready yet for this when you get ready when you can humble yourself then we'll talk about this thing right then i'll reveal this thing to you right come on church i got a few more minutes yes sir glory to god i i had it all laid out i'm sorry i had it all laid out but i'm a different kind of preacher all right all right y'all just i hope y'all just learned to bear with me right but but i just feel i just feel inspired right when i came out i already i wrote it down i already knew my inspiration i wrote it down somewhere right god inspires you it's things that god won't say because the age that we're living in right the age that we're we're not we're supposed to be the generation of the upright right but look at the influences and what's around us right and and all the young people you know they say where you don't parent amen yes no no that's foolishness that's foolishness that's foolishness yesterday when he got up and said ah yeah you know y'all paying i got something else to say don't don't parent that's nonsense that ain't biblical it's not biblical i would tell them today i say you know brother branham one time at the choosing over brad he was talking about going about cattle with with this fella and he said he was wondering why why he was always looking the cattle in the eye he said boy you got a lot to learn fella got a lot to learn he said because if he said listen here's the thing if it's a female and and it got that cow got that wild stare scary ripped out of look in her eyes he said she will not make a good mother to a calves right glory to god amen he said i'm gonna teach you something boy she will not he said the reason she fat she in a pen huh see sometimes you got to keep them in the pen to keep them from being undefiled i know what i'm talking about the hardest thing that has been is letting my children have a choice because they growed up that's been the hardest thing for me that's been the hardest thing for me i got one daughter one daughter and it takes everything in daddy see but but i realize she's an adult she's got to make her own decision i don't like him i don't like him she know i don't like him but i love her i love her as a daddy but i don't like him huh i don't as a daddy but i love her i got to let her make a decision i got to let her make her the choices but a lot of things i don't like my boys this thing i don't like i don't fuss with them about them i ain't trying to hurt them or nothing like that they already know they grew up under me so they know you know uh i do not like them but they do it anyway right they do it anyway it was it was hard letting christina go off the the university of miami see that that you want them to get an education and and all of that and and those things look good some of that i don't be even looking at right i'm looking at scripture i'm looking at what the word says in the mind of god and and all that and i know we got promises for our children and all of that [Music] yeah i know all of that but but i i you know i also look at the fact that you know i did marry my wife and she didn't go that far she could have went to yale she didn't right glory to god it's so it's it's things that you look at you'll be like you know you'll be like lord i'm gonna leave it alone jesus right help me to be at peace with the decisions as a parent that's all you can do help me to be at peace with this decisions you know i talk to my son one of my sons i talk to him a lot we we talk a lot now you know and i'll be just trying to share different things because he's trying to navigate amen himself through life and and and and and you know young ladies and all of that and you know i'd be like here's the crazy thing and i'm finna go cause y'all don't got quiet on me i ain't even getting amen no but but listen listen here's the thing you know it is crazy to me all these young sisters that looking for husbands and they out there getting mistreated by some worldly something those things just drive me nuts they do i'm telling you i'm telling you and and and you know so he'd be everywhere and these random people and all of that and i'd be like lord all i can say lord keep it lord it's it's i ain't even got no hair now glory to his one he's like lord just just these random people in these different places and all of that and i'll be like all you you got to do is come under the umbrella of the word right amen that that's an order that's a blessing i'ma say this for every young child up in here that daddy saved in this building there's a blessing associated with following your daddy and his leadership i'm gonna tell you something i salute my nieces right amen sarah i salute you you um salute you stay true i know he might be hard he a lot like me i'm a little old darling softened up a little bit huh becca i salute her right glory to god really fi follow under the leadership amen of of of the man oh you male chauvinist i'm biblical i'm biblical all this other stuff is crazy nonsense that's why families broke up and everything else right hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah see because for me if you take on if you if you cross over into a man's domain you got to be a man come on come on and see one thing about me it can't be two men in my house either i'm gonna be the man or you're gonna be the man if you take the position that you're leading yourself then you the man come on church i'm preaching now i know i said i got to go let the musicians come so i get on that uh right come on church y'all sisters listen to me good right this ain't skim milk all right right it cannot be two men in the house right somebody got to be subservient to the other there's a position in a place right if you cross over that right and you take on the hat ship you got to do all the things that a man is supposed to be doing i mean you got to pay your bills you got it's all that goes along with it come on let me bring you back to the bible because it's supposed to be the sweat of his bra i i know things has changed now right that was not the sweat of his bro was not given the eve come on now society and the devil did that god did not do that right god put on the home making babies being a help me i know we can't change that right i'm just talking about god come on now god did that god say you buddy right by the sweat of your bra you go to work you bring home the bacon she'll fry but when you when you want to take take his spot all right i'm gonna back up you got it now come on church y'all say boy brother smile you cruel all right i'm biblical that's what the problem is with people we don't want to hear the word we get so caught up in feelings and all that no no no no no no no no no when you cut see what's malachi 4 coming back is to line us up with the word i ain't i ain't the type of priest to tell y'all sisters don't work that's between you and your husbands and all that but i will say this i don't care if you make more money than him okay how much money you make huh glory to god i just thank god god has always blessed me right i'm not overly educated i don't have a high school diploma but god has always made a way for me is that right but but i tell you what i will not come subject to a woman i'm not doing i ain't built like that you want to be the man not be the man don't don't be the man and when it ain't convenient you want me to no now if you come in line up with the word now i'm talking sisters right i'm talking right if if if you want to come and line up with your the word i'll take my position and i'll do what i supposed to do come on come on but if but if you want to lead yourself then then we got problems it's going to be hard for me to do what i need to do right but but if you line up with the word and i become amen your your your head then by god's grace everything that i supposed to do as a man will get done it will get done not by power no by might but by spirit somehow some way we'll make it but as long as long as you want to lead come on we all right see
