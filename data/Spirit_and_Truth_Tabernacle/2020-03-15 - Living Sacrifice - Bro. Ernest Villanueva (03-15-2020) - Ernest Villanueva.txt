renew the rice every lose right spirit within me come on create in me a clean heart [Music] [Music] the right spirit [Music] [Music] [Music] ha [Music] [Music] thank God for that creative the right spirit for we start at one three ingredients from our assembly floor down brother invidual brother it is a venturi message he met brother Brent when he was just a little boy he was that many of his meetings he's so much of the supernatural then when he started the minister he was uh he was up north when there and so he invited the red to come down go that began a relationship and spanned over decades and brother many times to speak at his churches he traveled with and into wilderness many wonderful stories this is when Angela took place intended services so he has been a wealth of information and inspiration to me and he's 85 years old now and he's he just had open-heart surgery a couple of years ago and he's walking a little bit slower but the mind is still razor sharp he wanted to bring greetings to you and I want to say this has been a wonderful weekend and I feel like I don't know brother Jack and I have not met or said that to be as a mystery I've heard so much about it over the years and I said I can't believe Florida traveled in Florida many of the brothers are Florida but somehow I've never been down here thank you brother for this wonderful supernatural hospitality and met many ministers yesterday in the ministers meeting I didn't know and assemble was there with us we had a wonderful time so I'm gonna have you just be seated for just a moment I want to just give you a short testimony very very short and my testimony is that I am involved in a divine spiritual supernatural romance with our Lord Jesus Christ there has been a divine incarnation that has taken place in my life and has taken me on a mystical journey filled with drama intrigue mysteries and every day I wake up I know that were one day closer to being with our Lord Jesus Christ at the wedding supper and anything that we go through down here it's going to pale compared to the rewards that are waiting for real children god I think about the Apostle Paul many times in Paul he was beaten with 39 lashes he got that five times three times he was beaten with rods he was shipwrecked and he was stoned and left for dead right and he picked himself up and he brushed himself off and he said okay where's the next meeting and he headed to the next meeting and much of his time is spent in jail and then Paul he says this light affliction all right worketh for me a far greater reward and war now when we compare our life and whatever trivial trials and challenges that we go through when we compare that to the prophet of God for that first church age we we don't have any problem in fact we know we're the spiritual rich get rich kids in this generation and we've got technology on our side we've got the word on our side we've got the message on our side we've got brothers and sisters we would we are we are in such a state of intrigue and I want to say this message to me it has energized and supercharged and electrified and illuminated it has stimulated activated motivated revelry to me I cannot even begin to imagine and God has allowed me to be on the religious merry-go-round I spoke on Friday night I was in the Catholic Church the Baptist Church Assembly of God focus or businessman Bible School UPC so so I have got a real clear understanding of the religious world my friends I can tell you the religious world has taken an invasion of insanity into the religious life into our political world and the business world into the music world into the sports world it is insanity on steroids No Satan Satan his desire in the beginning he wanted to be worshipped yeah and today he has that same desire and he does not care where he gets his worship from if he gets its worship in the Catholic Church or the Baptist Church or the Mormon Church or the Moonies or Jehovah Witnesses if he gets worship and people who are atheists agnostics if he gets worship from the music world that gets worship from the sports I does not care where he gets his worship from as long as he can keep you from thus saith the Lord and we need to every day make sure our priorities are right it's gotta be God first then then family and work and the things that we have to do we all have responsibilities I know that word responsibility it's a compound word it's response-ability so responsibility is having the ability to respond and do you have the ability to respond to what God has done in this thing do you have the ability to respond to the fact that in this building there are supernatural beings in this building that in this building everything that we've ever said or done or thought and every thought that we've ever had the motive the objective everything has been recorded and it was recorded and known before the foundation I work by foreknowledge in predestination and God puts us here today on free moral agency the greatest power that God puts into our hands is the power of choice we decide we decided what we're going to do and we have a myriad of choices you made thousands of choices every day you wake up what time we gonna wake up and you start preparing yourself and you get on the highway and you're on the road am I gonna slow down am I gonna move over and you're aware and your mind is racing at a million miles a minute you don't but it's scanning scanning scanning scanning they say the average person has about 10,000 thoughts and they go through their mind but the problem is 9,000 of those 10,000 thoughts are the same thoughts they had yesterday and this is the rehash in a rehash in a rehash and or we have of the news you know and who are the celebrities in the world and work work things family thing but God gives us the opportunity to have fresh thoughts every day he's put us he's given us the opiate of his word and I am super intoxicated know the world they are intoxicated in many areas of life but I am intoxicated with reality I do not live in a fantasy world I deny the fantasy world so that's just a little testimony Who I am what I believe I was telling brothers brother Jack that the Bride of Christ she has a very delicate balancing act all right we have to be holy and happy right and humble right and for me sometimes people misunderstand me because I'm so happy and I'm so excited and this message reverberates in me and when I go to church I'm right at the front room I want to be at the spot where the glory comes up and a whole group of young people now that are coming down because they want to be on Ernie's room you know listen in May I'm going to be 70 years old I still feel I still it's impossible to understand how did I get the 70 years old but I don't feel any different I still have excitement I still have enthusiasm I still have energy and I know that energy comes from a supernatural force and you know if you have a light here and and the light might look good I have a beautiful shape might have a beautiful design but until that light is plugged in to the source is not going to be any light come in and the Bride of Christ you have been plugged into a supernatural divine source with awesome results yeah Bride of Christ on display he is a walking talking supernatural encyclopedia walking down the road good things that you know the things that you see the things that you understand you are the divine spiritual supernatural aristocracy of God they might think they're the royal family over there and in here and they've got the kings and the queens and the princes of the pre all make-believe frogs and you the the revelation is for us to believe what God said we are I better get to the word let's stay let's stand to our feet all right I just pray that someday I'll be able to come back and be able to spend some time with you and get to know you and also brother Quentin thank you so much for the hospitality and be able to stay in your home and if sometimes when you meet somebody sometimes you don't really know who they are but when you when I heard brother Quentin pray today I said that there's there's a man he's so humble when I came to his house you know he didn't talk much and sometimes when I go to a meeting after a meeting I go out and I kind of sit down and and some fifo said well well brother Ernie something rise and no one he said well you're not saying much I said well I already know what I know I want to find out what you know so it helped sometime to be a good listener but when I heard brother Quentin pray I said there's a man that's elevated in my on every part of the body of Jesus Christ every part is a gift every person is a revelation to when I meet them when I feed off their spirit and I feel that atmosphere because we're creatives and when we create the atmosphere I want to create a Holy Ghost happiness if we can open our Bibles I'd like to invite you to look into the Book of Leviticus and we're going to read in chapter 2 and verse 1 before we read let's let's talk to the Lord father once again we thank you for the privilege of coming together the privilege of being able to read your word to be able to read between the lines of what you have revealed to us I prayed today father that you would that you would help each one here myself the ones that are that are here to here help us father to hear exactly what you want us to hear and then give us the faith to be able to manifest what you make real to us today we ask all this and your precious and holy and wonderful and awesome name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen you know in many churches today most of them don't even go to the Old Testament because that's the Old Testament where in the New Testament that's law were under three and they miss the majesty and the beauty of the types and the shadows that are lying here so in Leviticus chapter two verse one and when any will offer a meat offering unto the Lord his offering shall be a fine flour and he shall pour oil upon it and put frankincense thereon and he shall bring it to Aaron's sons to priests and he shall take their out as handful of the flour thereof and of the oil thereof with all the frankincense thereof and the priests shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar to be an offering made by fire of a sweet savour unto the lord god bless you you can have your seats now I would encourage you sometime in the near future I would encourage you to sit down and read or listen to brother Branham speaking about Elijah and the meal offering and I trust today that maybe you'll be able to see some things and read between the lines because this this subject I have studied it intensely I have been like a supernatural detective I wanted to I wanted to glean every nugget out of what was being said here so first of all when the offering is said we're not going to read the whole chapter but I'll just give you the highlights when the meal offering had to come first of all had to be fine flour now brother random talks about a device they had back there he he called it a verb bu RR and brother branham mentions at 28 times and a burr they could take that meal and they could grind that meal and every piece of meal came out exactly the same size so it had to be fine flour then the oil had to be put on it oil is nourishing and then there had to be frankincense added to it a little further on in the chapter we're told don't burn any leaven in there and don't burn any honey in there and make sure you add the salt into that offering so the fine flour the oil no leaven no honey frankincense and salt and so that this is this is laying out a pattern it's laying out something that's going to take place in the future you know Genesis it's a gene chapter everything that started in Genesis it's coming to harvest right here in Revelation and God has privileged you and I to live in the most exciting times a son or daughter of God has ever lived on this planet and the other thing is I can tell you right now with absolute certainty it is later than it has ever been before brother Branham said when he was here was three minutes to midnight I wonder how many seconds to midnight it might be so again we're laying down the pattern of that meal offering the fine flour the oil no eleven no honey frankincense and so now we can turn over to the book of first kings we're going to start reading at verse 16 [Music] first came 16 and we're going to start reading and find out a little bit about what happened just before Elijah showed up all right in chapter 16 verse 29 and in the 38 year as the king of Judah began they have the son only to reign over in Israel and they have the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria 20 and two years know first thing is this was an Israeli king not a pagan King but an Israeli King the king of Israel the king of God's people and they have the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the Lord above all that word before him that's sinking a have did evil in the sight of the Lord above all right that were before him and he came to pass as if it had been a light thing just a little thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat that he took to wife Jezebel of pagan right uh even the daughter of F Bale king of the cydonia --nz and went and served bail and worship you have a king of history of going marrying a pagan white and going to serve her pagan gods and he reared up an altar prevail in the House of bail and he built it in Samaria and a have made a grove and a have did more to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him so that lays a little foundation of what happened just before first King seventeen and Elijah the Tishbite who was in the happiness of Gilead said unto Ahab as the Lord God of Israel liveth before whom I stand there shall not be do nor rain these years but according to my word now we don't have a lot of history about Elijah he just showed up it just comes on the scene why because of sin because God's people were worshipping pagan idols and Elijah comes on the scene and he says as the Lord God liveth there's not going to be rain until I come now when when there's no rain friends there is a drought where there is a drought there is a famine where this famine there is hunger where there is hunger there starts coming insanity in the world we're seeing a little bit little traces friends of mine send me pictures of what's taking place in New York when their governor declared a state of emergency and said you might be out of work for six months you know what that did to people they headed out for the nearest door they emptied the chef's they were fighting in the streets the police had to be called people will walk you with their shopping baskets and other people are coming and grabbing things out of their shopping basket because of the fear of of no food and the word of the Lord came unto him saying get thee hence and turned the eastward and hide thyself by the brook Cherith that is before Jordan this is the quietest place in the whole country now you have to put on your spiritual thinking cap now I'll say your supernatural thinking cap to believe this next part all right and it shall be that thou shall drink of the brook and I have commanded the Ravens the birds write defeat thee and so he went and did according unto the word of the Lord for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith did before Jordan and the Ravens brought a breaded flesh in the morning and bread and flesh and the evening and he drank of the brook now let me ask you friends what bakery did the birds get that bread from where'd they get the flesh and Elijah he's got room service every morning the birds show up with his breakfast everything the birds show up with the supper and for three years and six months Elijah is up there just having fellowship with God for the random sin God wanted three and a half years of constant fellowship with his God now in the meantime down in a halfs land famine is starting to strike and there is all points bulletin out for Elijah the king said you find that man find out where he's at everything was going fine in the country until that guy showed up get the military get the police get the SWAT team get everybody out there find that man and bring him here and so they're out there and they're looking and they're walking and no doubt with a lot not a lot of water and food their electrolytes maybe start going down and maybe they start moving a little bit slow and then they come they come to the play they come to the mountain there we're in the brook Cherith is up there and they know that's the driest place in the land there hasn't been any rain for three years there can't be anything out there and we're not going to take our energy and our strength we're not gonna waste it going up there and here's Elijah just having its revival just him and gun yeah driest place in the land why it is place in the land and Elijah and his god just haven't finished [Music] so he went and did according unto the word of the Lord where he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith then the before Jordan and the Ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning and bread and flesh in the evening and he drank of the proof and now it came to pass that the brook dried up because there had been no rain in the land and the word of the Lord came unto him saying arise get this error path which belongeth in Sidon and dwell there behold I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee now at this time do you think the widow woman knew what was going to take place in her immediate future the answer is no she did not know so he arose and went to Sarah path and when he came to the city the gate of the city behold the widow woman was there gathering of sticks now like I told you I encourage you to read that message about Elijah and so I want to describe to you what was taking place there bubbles out there and it's discovering galaxies and it keeps on going it keeps on going it keeps on going but God has given to us a prophet scope and that prophet scope God can take that prophet scope and he could turn him back he could turn him sideways he can turn him whatever way he wants and we have confidence in that prophecy and so here's here's his his vision he went there and he saw this woman he said she was weary unable to sleep all night she was tossed about because of this great tragedy big tears dripping from her eyes this is not just a man's thoughts friends for many weeks she had only one meal every three or four days think about for many weeks one meal every three or four days her husband had been lost in the battle for the Horde he trusted God and gave his life for the cause of Israel her ragged nightgown was just about gone her sleeves were all ragged and her arms sticking out of them she lived decent and honorable and met all of God's requirements but still the Lord remains silent her shoulders were stupid as she sat in her rocking chair shedding big tears and looking at her starving baby her cheek bones sticking out her arms frail and she sat ringing her bony hands her bones were dwindling away as the flesh goes from them she knew that only a handful of meals stood between her and death and then he drops the sin she wasn't going to eat of the case she was going to make she was going to feed her little boy and put him in her arms and die all the while friends there is a prophecy out there that she's being prepared the day care of Elijah that when he comes now here's a little boy the little boy was three or four years old he was unable to sleep over twenty minutes at a time because of his hunger he had on a ragged nightshirt he had sinking cheeks his eyes were turning yellow and a prophet of God going there and looking and see seeing that and coming back to this to take the Bible and make the word live to us his eyes were turning yellow and he was holding his stomach as he asked his mother if she was ready to cook a little cake no this is not all in one message friends this is good brother branham love telling about elijah in this blue so it's wolf and all throughout the message then he talks about the conditions in the land the whole nation was starving and in a terrible condition the people in the city of centre path were starving to death screaming for water it was a reflection of sin and immorality as the woman looked down the street she heard the people cursing and carrying on I believe there's a lot of that going on right here in our time and think of what's going on in China and in France and Italy in Spain and all the countries that are being shut down you did the only thing open at some of those stores is the supermarket's and the pharmacies everything else restaurants closed bars closed thankful for that but every stores closed everything is shut down and the people are locked in they can't go out of their country nobody can come in their country it never felt or experienced anything like that before so now the the widow woman [Music] the widow woman now she's there and she's got a couple of states that she is prepared and when he goes there he sees her carrying the sticks he says to her when he comes to her he says hey thanks me a drink of water I'm gonna go quick we just just hit that fetch me a drink of water yes now think about this water is the most precious commodity in that land and here a perfect stranger shows up Elijah walks into the vision he sees what God had showed him maybe he sees defense the house he said this is a place here's that widow woman and if she walks over give me a drink and the Bible says as she was going to fetch think of she was ready to obey the first part of the message and she was going and then he said Oh bake me a cake in my hand and bring it to me and that stopped her she said well I've only got a little bit of meal and a little bit of oil and I'm here gathering two sticks - six not three six not five six - six no she's gathering the two sticks that I may go in and prepare it for my son and die hopeless no future nothing since she had no ability to think of survival she knew she was at the end of her Road Eli just says bait me that came first right and thus saith the Lord your meal will never run out your oil will never now and she went and did it and she and her and her household didn't eat many day for the meal the oil never run out you know that first cake that she built I want you to lock this down in your heart front after that first cake that she baked and gave to Elijah every single cake after that it was a miracle cake everyone a miracle cake a miracle cake a miracle she knew there was nothing there she knew and she was ready to die God has saved us 1200 plus miracle case every message it's a miracle cake I've never read one of them that is not a masterpiece brother Brad spoke about Jesus in perfect faith he said but Jesus lived in a world that no one known about he was an odd person he lived in a world of perfect faith that a perfect God of which he was if we lived in a perfect faith of a Christian in what we are we'd be a mystic to the world the people wouldn't understand you you'd walk in the spirit what the spirit said you would do what he forbid you'd not do and if people began to say you'd be a mystic I'd encourage you to go into the dictionary look up the word mystic identified myself the definition of a mystic is one who seeks after and attains direct intercourse with God now there's many around the world they think their mistakes in India in Africa in the Caribbean you got a lot of mystics you go around to some of these some of these gypsies over there and they hang out there come here we'll tell you a fortune they all think they're mystics and people are deluded by that you're a mystic for you're here for a purpose of the Bride of Christ is naturally spiritual normally supernatural you're super-sensitive to the supernatural that's a real world and God has given you entrance into that world brother have said no man seeks after God but once God finds us then he says now diligently search after me searching my word search for my life search for me and let my character be transformed into you let a metamorphose take place in your life right now in Luke chapter 4 or 14 we'll start reading about Jesus actually in verse 13 and when the devil had ended all the temptation he departed from him for a season four season and Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit unto Galilee and there went out a fame of him to all the regions above him they'd heard about the miracle they'd heard about him confounding the wise of all the religious leaders it was the buzz going on there everybody wanted to know everybody heard about this guy named Jesus verse 18 and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up home boy makes good home boy comes home all the natives have heard about him they watched him grow up they watched them they knew him and has this custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up to read write and when there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it is written he went to the specific verse he didn't read the whole book of Isaiah he wasn't he wasn't unsure he went right to this scripture the Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and the recovering of sight to the blind and set at liberty them that are not to preach the acceptable year of the Lord glorious worth wonderful words I'm sure those people especially the rabba they were very familiar with the scripture and and young Jesus comes there goes to the synagogue stands up and he reads it right now try to put yourself in this picture this great drama that's going on and he closed the book and he gave it to the minister and he sat down and the eyes of all a ll all them that were at the synagogue were fastened on him [Music] that's what we've heard about and now now he's here yeah expectation anticipation and he reads description right and then he says this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears Messiah the one the one that hundreds of prophecies has been spoken about by Isaiah and Ezra in Ezekiel and Jeremiah hundreds of prophecy they're all saying Messiah is coming Messiah is coming Messiah is coming Messiah is coming and here he shows up and all there have witnessed and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth and they said is not this Joseph's son what's the answer no was it Joseph's son it was God's Son that's right and he said unto them you will surely send to me this proverb physician heal thyself whatsoever he had heard done in Capernaum do also hear in my country in other words he says you're waiting for a miracle you want to see some signs don't you he said verily I say unto you no prophet is accepted in his own country did America receive her prophet no millions followed brother Brendan great man has risen up a month since we've heard about him flocked to the meeting flocked to the stadium flocked to the racetracks around the world but then 1958 he preaches the seed of the serpent and identified many serpents and the Serpent's went away they all walked away brother Ram said don't try to feed Pentecostal baby up with denominational babies don't try to feed them supernatural things it's too rich for them it makes them sick at their stomach and this is what happened in Jesus day but I tell you the truth many widows were in Israel now he comes right - he picks from Leviticus then he goes to first kings and a little with a woman many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias when the heaven was shut up three years and six months we know exactly how long there was no rain and a great famine was throughout all the land all right but unto none of them was Elias sent unto Sarepta a city of Sidon unto a woman that was a widow right her husband was dead he is served in the army he was a Gentile warrior he died and now a widow is left then he finishes and many lepers were in Israel in the time of Elias to profit and them was cleansed saving naman the Syrian right now what's what's the response and all whatever you see all think about all all they in the synagogue which when they heard these words were filled with wrath Oh anger outraged who does he think he is taking the holy book of Isaiah and say that that scripture has been fulfilled right here in our synagogue and they rose up and they thrust him out of the city and led him under the brow of the hill where in their city was built that they might cast him down headlong that's how they reacted when the prophet Jesus showed up they wanted to kill him but he passing through the midst of them went his way he just walked past them bye-bye they didn't know what happened to him but I'm sure that they were angry and full of wrath and outrage for long time after that so then we can turn over to Matthew we're going to read Matthew I love the word when it comes alive and our brother Bram says do you like to read between the lines between the lines do you know this message the message that we know come from God out of the 6.7 billion going on to seven pretty well eight billion in the next probably 20 years 99.99% of the people in the world have never heard this message and I could I could probably add another nine on that but I don't want to over estimate you say oh how can that be well in China 1.5 billion people Christian it just regular Christianity it's just a minut percentage of the population not talking about message Christianity in India 1.5 billion people Christianity a little tiny group of Christians the rest of our Hindus and Buddhists and Muslims so we said well brother a 99.99 I don't believe it that that this is that doesn't sound possible yeah it's true you take the six billion people in the world and 99.99% have never heard this message and you know talk about responsibility I know that I may be the only son or daughter of God that many people ever come eyeball-to-eyeball with you may be the only opportunity that person has to hear about this great supernatural opportunity that God has placed in front of us so Matthew 27 in verse 26 I'm gonna read this real quick you know I can read fast I came from Providence which is right between Boston and New York I know how to read fast and I want to preserve time so they released he Barabbas unto them and when he had scourged him he delivered him to be crucified so the first thing they do is they they scourge him they get 39 lashes and those people Roman soldiers they were masters of torture they had to be they called them a Lichter and it was a strap with LED balls at the end of it and little shops Radz and they would take that whip and they'd crack that whip and they would pull it back and the flesh and the blood it would just pour out of these people so the first thing they did was they gave them 39 lashes then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common Hall and gathered unto them here's another word the whole band of soldiers not just one not a couple the whole band of soldiers surround Jesus and they stripped them and put on a scarlet robe and when they had planted a crown of thorns they put it upon his head and the reed in his right hand and they bowed the knee before him and mocked him saying hail King of the Jews and they spit upon him and it took the reed and smote him in the head and after they had mocked him they took the robe off from him and put on his own garment to him and led him away to crucify in other words they tortured him they beat him they spit upon him they ripped his beard out of his faith they kicked them put that rag around his head and walked around sucker-punched him okay bang tell us who that bang who hits you that time bang the whole band of soldiers they were going to make an example out of this man Rome was going to make an example of anybody that would come against Rome the Jews were going to make an example he was going to be brutalized tortured beyond anything that we can imagine even Herod and Pilate that hated each other they came together around the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and then of course Simon of Cyrene comes and and when they had come under place called Golgotha that is to say the place skull they gave him vinegar to drink and mingle with golf and when he had tasted thereof he would not drink there they crucified him and part of his garments casting Lots that it might be filled which was spoken in the word they parted my garments among them and upon my vesture did they cast lots and sitting down they watched him there you know like I said these these Roman soldiers they would desensitize to torture and brutality it was an everyday thing for them crucifixion public execution they did it all the time when they took the murderers and the robbers and they took them there no doubt many of them demon-possessed you know demon-possessed people they possessed sometimes four or five the normal strength of a human being and these people are getting ready to be killed knowing the torture that's ahead of them no doubt they're screaming picture in your mind how they're mocking and cursing and begging and pleading you know to be spared from death nobody wants to die especially that way and those soldiers maybe had to have three or four of them pulled down the arm until they dealt with that arm and hold down the other arm and hold the feet down all the while it's like a nightmare experience is going on for this person that's getting ready to be crucified the Roman soldiers didn't care they didn't laughed about it it was exercise they enjoyed it these people they were crucified they were lower than dogs they were like the exterminator the Orkin man going out there and just exterminating all these people so now they never saw one like Jesus Jesus in Leviticus we had to have the fine flour Jesus was the bread of life that came down from heaven and the oil the anointing of God was on this vessel so he had the word and the spirit and you mix the word and the spirit and then no leaven jesus said beware the of the pharisee don't put any leaven in here and maybe you've got some leaven that maybe needs to be purged out of your life maybe maybe the leaven of sports or music or business or some kind of a habit or any anything that's less anything that you've got above your priority with God it is Lenin and the Bible says no leaven strip out the leaven and don't put any honey in there because when he is applied to honey it gets sour and so we don't want to be honey Christian we don't want to walk around well you know praise the Lord glory to God yeah everything's fine you don't want to be one of those people Jesus was a real man of God you need to be a real son or daughter of God with a revelation in your heart happy holy humble serious nothing artificial in you nothing phony nothin put-on no no make-believe friends God's given to us you need stand you can stand knowing that you are a supernatural entity here on this earth with a mission from God there has been a divine incarnation in the life of a real believer in this message I hope that's you I hope what's happened already if it hasn't happened I pray that it will happen so now no leaven and no honey and there had to be salt because salt was a preservative it made sure that at the meal it didn't go bad now Jesus he's the bread of life that comes down from heaven the oil is upon him he said no leaven no honey and salt salt as a preservative and Jesus had the preservative he could fulfill his mission the crucifixion that was the crowning glory of Jesus life public execution that was the squeeze for him even in the garden of gethsemane he felt that squeeze yeah if it's possible let this depart from me but nevertheless not my will but thine be done so the salt was there that preservative was there and then like the little water woman gathering the two sticks when Jesus went there he laid on the cross and he stretched out his hands and he waited for the nails to come those soldiers had never seen anything like that before they never saw a lamb come to the club and just lay down and surrender his life and then they crucified him now in Leviticus were told there's four ways that you can prepare this meal offering number one on the altar number two in the oven number three in the frying pan or number four in the pan now sometimes you go through a trial it's known only to you and God that's like an altar experience you go through something just you and God you deal with then sometimes it goes like it gets a little bit hotter and the of it's like an oven experience and you know maybe against you maybe your family maybe a pastor maybe only a few know this Greek trial maybe in your body maybe in your finances maybe in your family but it's an oven experience and you couldn't see you couldn't see the effects of the heat and the other night then but the effect of the heat it was having an effect on that meal then it can go to the pan now in the pan you can pretty much see you know that thing it's starting to get heat up so maybe your trial is not a halter trial or other trials maybe you're in the pen but Jesus was in the frying pan experience it's like a piece of bacon you put a piece of bacon on the frying pan and put the heat up and it starts bubbling you can see the effects that he's having on that piece of meat down there and Jesus he was in the frying pan experience he was the meal offering anointing with oil no leaven no honey and he had the salt to preserve him the other ingredient the meal offering it was frankincense frankincense was the most costly and the most fragrant perfume they had in those days and the secret of frankincense it did not release its aroma until he was a bride and so Jesus had he was frankincense the hotter his trial gut the sweeter the sweet of the aroma came and he just he just there but before the world the Lamb of God slain for all those who had lived and died before that that were in God's mind all those that were in the future it was a finished work now now the Bible said there were two thieves crucified with him they were thieves they were getting what they deserve and some people think well there was a good thief and a bad teeth don't they were both these I just want to read that to you and when they had come into the place called Golgotha that is the place of a skull they gave him vinegar to drink mingle with oil where he had tasted thereof you would not drink and they crucified Him and part of this garments casting Lots then it might be filled which was spoken of by the Prophet so even on the cross prophecy is being fulfilled on the cross and sitting down they watched him think of the scene people sitting around looking at somebody in agony could hardly even her he was so brutalized the body was so wounded and beaten and cut blue probably swollen face swollen black and blue and they put over his head as accusation worse this is Jesus cannon Jews then were the two thieves crucified with him one on the right and one on the left and they that passed by reviled him wagging their head so it was like a it was like a a circus it was just there and the people walking by them know it's wagging their heads here's their own God and saying thou that destroys the temple and buildest it in three days save thyself so they're putting the the misconception of what Jesus said they're casting that oh you said you can build a temple and three day go ahead if thou be the Son of God come down from the cross likewise also the chief priest the chief priests mocking him right there at the cross high priest all decked out beards just right robes just wrapped around them walking around holy man so call looking at their Messiah the thieves also which were crucified with him cast the same in his teeth both of them cursing mocking at their fellow one that was being crucified with them both of them but something happened friends I but this is my own thought now he runner by brother Jack I believe that thief on the right was the first one that experienced the third pull of Jesus ministry he never saw sign he never saw miracle he never saw all the all as he saw was this man suffering next to him being executed ready to die and something happened to that thief and he said he said remember me when you come into your kingdom remember he was mocking he was mocking and he was transformed on the cross by the life that he saw and the atmosphere and the anointing and revelation came and Jesus said this day you will be with me in paradise never got baptized never went through the sanctification never went through all that but he was there in paradise here you are getting two now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour and about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice saying Eli Eli lama sabachthani that is to say my God my God why has thou forsaken me some of them that stood there when they heard that saying this man called for Elias and straightaway one of them ran and took a sponge and filled it with vinegar and put it on a reed and gave him the drink the rest said let be areas screaming let me don't give him any relief let us see whether Elias will come to save him and Jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice yielded up the ghost he died from grief died from a broken heart yes here's something you'll never get the true revelation of a prophet of God's insight and behold the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom and the earth did quake and the rocks rent over at the temple that veil that was there at the holy place that God supernaturally split that thing at a time of Jesus crucifixion you know what they did they just went replaced it see they got a new one or they sewed it up that had no idea why that happened no dumb desensitizing frozen immobilized paralysed the truth sitting right in front being crucified right in front of them and the grace were open you'll never hear this one friends and many bodies of the saints which slept arose the Old Testament Saints arose and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared on the many now taking out my profits coke now my profits cope said that when those Old Testament Saints came up Abraham and Sarah walked over there and they said well Lord would it be okay if we took a whistle-stop tour around Jerusalem and see how how things have changed since we've been there and she goes no it's okay we're gonna be here for 40 days you just go ahead so Abraham and Sarah they just walking around Jerusalem revealed walking around and they could appear and disappear just like Jesus so Jesus fulfilled it started in Leviticus fine flour the oil no leaven no honey salt frankincense two sticks Jesus comes he's the bread of life come down from heaven anointed with the Holy Ghost strip out all the unbelief strip out all the leather don't be in make believe it don't be a put on don't put any honey in there and make sure this salt Colossians says let your speech be always with grace seasoned with salt that you may know how to answer every man and then while Jesus was was being sacrificed not on the altar not in the oven not in the pan but on the frying pan there hotter that trial gut the more brutality the more those people cast it in his teeth the sweeter that frankincense God that he brought it up and that frankincense has been a balm that has for 2,000 years has been the anointing and the sweetness of the Holy Ghost being made manifest in real sons and daughters of God so now I'm coming down to you and me right here right here this is my meal right here your body your body that's your meal and Hebrews 13:8 said Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and so our lives have got to be patterned after that your body your life and that body has got to be anointed with the oil of the Holy Ghost it comes in and then the stripping comes I call it the stripping before the equipping and there's gotta be it's gotta be that leaven is gonna come out o all the popularity all the beauty all the stars all the heroes by everything in your life that you put before God it's gotta be riff die and you become a real son of God no honey in there and then the salt has got to be applied unfortunately friends there's many that we have known through the years I've known many of them walked in this message for 30 years and they did not have the salt he that endures until the end the same shall be saved and they don't lack the salt and they went out and are fighting against God fighting against truth trampling the blood of Jesus Christ under their feet and not even know it as I said Friday night when the revelation this message comes it comes supernaturally and I seen it leave and when it leaves somebody at least supernaturally the man that I used to know the man that I heard preached for thirty years he's not there anymore not there all the knowledge all the experience all the so-called revelation and all the messages he create all the places he went all all the power and influence he had over people it's gone it's gone brother Branham said in the last things and things have Ananias and Sapphira would return and I don't doubt we're gonna have people drop over dead but when I look at these people I have a look right in their eyes and God spoke to me you are looking at Ananias right now dead dead while he's walking dead while he's talk we're just going back to Jesus we're just going back to the Bible well three is enough ever been you we just got a love everybody blind miserable wretched that's right poor and naked so now you identify here here your life into the meal offering Romans twelve says I beseech you therefore by the mercies of God that you present your body a living sacrifice a living center a lively sacrifice energized supercharged Electrify preach and sometimes I feel like I'm in the Land of Nod I would hate to say it but sometimes it feels like I'm speaking to the chosen frozen so now how about your trial now because every son and daughter of God is gonna be tested and maybe right now maybe right now you are in a alter experience a challenge in your life ultra challenge and maybe just you and God maybe you're wrestling it out just you in the Lord and sometimes it gets a little bit hotter and it gets a little bit bigger maybe your body gets challenged or your family get anything that happens and the trial gets bigger that's the oven oven trial and then maybe it gets real bad maybe some of your children maybe you backslide maybe your children back sir maybe they get in trouble with the law something bad happens and that's like a pain experience everybody in the church knows about your whole family knows about keeps coming then sometimes your trial gets to the frying pan and you don't know how you're going to handle it and you're there on that frying pan and your body having a real good pity party for me what was me nobody's got it so rough as the one you forgot about Paul you forgot about Paul five times scourge three times beaten shipwrecked stoned most of most of his writing was in jail can't stand I better get one of those service dogs brother Jack I better get me one of those little dogs keep me calm and then let me on the plane if I need to go somewhere I can take him on the plane now I can even get a little horse a minute I can bring my little anybody see that the miniature horse show but you did you saw that two of them one of them was all they had all dressed up sitting in four headed by a first-class seat for the dog we're living brother grant said this is a neurotic age you're seeing it today right in front of your ID there were neurosis neurotic fear and striking the people hundreds of times the Bible says fear not I'm not giving you a spirit of fear power so much network power comes from the Greek word Dunamis you shall receive power dynamite the message came to take the fear off for the people here you are me and the frying-pan and everybody knows everybody's wrong maybe you're sick baby cancer struck maybe a heart attack maybe your true somebody dies and everybody's there and you're going through that trouble you just feel like your boiler question when you say somebody I'll pray for you do you really do it do you write it down for so pray for brother Donny ray it plain to me here we've got Saints over in China that have been arrested for taking the gospel to their people our pastor was arrested a bunch of people from our church in China all arrested for taking the gospel to the communist nation so now you're in that trial that frying pan experience hotter than you've ever had it before and what has to happen you're a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God and the frankincense kicks in all the heart of that tribe yes the closer you draw to God the more you depend upon him the more takes you listen to you the more you pray the more you're encouraged by the other people Saints here you are boiling away the frankincense comes out the sweetness sweetness of the Holy Ghost comes out you're in the inner inner chamber in the Holy of Holies brothers do you like to be with somebody who's been in that holy of holies and they come and there's just something about it I appreciate brother Jack for giving me the ability to stay home on a Saturday night and study because a lot of times I've been dragged out all day Saturday and they want to show me this attraction and dismounted and this old they want to drag me up my brother Jack man of God understand I stay home on Saturday raised a little brother-brother bread said a man should dwell alone before they come to this point find a thing that final thing I want to drop that I want to reach something to you we have oftentimes thought about Mary and little girl 15 years old an innocent humble country girl a virgin and the angel kinder all right and the angel tells her of God's plan she said be done to me according to thy word does she received it you know that little innocent 15 year old humble country girl she had to go to her fiance yeah she had to say Joseph I still love you all right I still want to marry you but I'm gonna have a baby right and it's not gonna be your baby now Joseph did the Bible says being a good man he wanted to put her away Friday and the angel comes to Joseph and tells dose of the plan and Joseph's on board so we thought about those things many I encourage you to think about those things deeply and think about how Mary had to go to her mom said mom guess what you know I'm gonna get married but I'm already with child yeah think about how mom and dad received anybody here had a daughter 15 years old you could imagine you had three of them could you imagine one of the 15 years old say daddy I gotta tell you something no you better you better sit down for this you might better take anti-anxiety pill keep your clothes fine because I'm gonna drop it on a bomb and Joseph he had to tell his mom and dad they were you know we're getting married and you're looking forward to one day being grandparents and a babies on the way but it's not mine what there's a real people it was a real little girl and a real man and a real mom and dad and maybe they had brothers and sisters and aunts and uncles and cousins and they had all the people and everybody they bore the scandal Joseph and Mary were scandalized the rest of the world didn't understand that's too supernatural for them and when Jesus came he was scandalized he had the bear that we proved everywhere that family was there they are there's that girl probably impregnated by some Roman changer he's an illegitimate child back in those days of you or illegitimate child that was a scar on your life and the people around pretty heavy-duty isms that God would come to a virgin and she would conceive supernaturally and her husband had to have angel come to him and they bore the shame the scandal the reproach their whole life and Jesus became that sin offer he became the meat offering but now here's where I want to finish speaking about the word I kind of read something to you a gift that God gave to me I want to share it with you but here's the bottle for you for this day the very thing thing that happened to Mary happen to me has happened to brother Jack has happened to all the brothers and sisters here that believe this message you have been supernaturally impregnated with God see you bury the work you'll walk me around you've got a higher form of the word in you you're not a regulated word thus saith the Lord you've got a vindicating word you're getting ready to walk into eternity and you must be the living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God for this day that scripture 1st Thessalonians 4 1st Thessalonians 4 remember what happened when Jesus was on the cross and he cried with a loud voice and yielded up to go and the dead came out of the graves after his resurrection Paul speaking this is this is your body Paul says but I would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that ye sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them which are asleep in Jesus will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain under the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall rise descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord so shall we ever be with the Lord and if Paul drops us in wherefore comfort one another with these words when Jesus when the meal offering that on the cross became the sacrifice that's when the dead in Christ came out in this day when the Bride of Christ becomes that living sacrifice the widow woman's secret to her success was her willingness to sustain Elijah to sustain the word and her meal never ran out her oil never ran out and so tonight you and I we are that little widow woman yeah talk about that when a woman had problems before I came to this message I hope you don't mind this but I was a walking talking spiritual skeleton walking down the road I had no meat on my bones I didn't have any muscle I had a I was a Catholic I had Baptist at PCL UPC assembly at all it was nourishing it didn't put any revelation on but God allowed that light to keep on coming and keep on coming and keep on coming and keep on coming and moving and when that came it changed everything here here's what had happened to me I can I can nail it right down to the day and the hour it happened to me I was listening to a discernment line and I said brother Jack one of her brothers are used to work for me he went all through the message they put together about seven hours of discernment just brother Brennan in the discernment line telling people who what when where why I'm sitting there and brother Branham said now sister I don't know you and you don't know me but there is one here who does know you and he does know me said now when he and his spirit comes in me and my spirit goes away and he gives me a temporarily resurrection by my spirit and he wants to use my body and I'm so happy to load it [Applause] I understood then hey son of man revealing the son of man I never got my eyes on a man I love the Prophet I love the office of a problem I love what he brought I love him with all my heart but it was Jesus Christ that was the continual fixation of my life and it was Jesus Christ speaking through a prophet in this day like he did with Moses like he did with Isaiah like he did with the season and no generation has ever had the voice of their prophet recorded recorded they couldn't even read back in those days brother Jack they had they stand there and the high priest wouldn't read it to him they said for our they sit there couldn't read illiterate this is my electronic highway to heaven I'm never bored I'm never lonely I am being supernaturally entertained [Music] [Applause] on the officer said many people will use this it will be their electronic highway to hell talk about the gift of God you know I'm all done all done preaching with me a gift God gave to me when I was traveling one time and a lot of times you're traveling and on the road and sometimes you go to these you travel the plates into 24 hours from the time you wake up to the time you get the next bed so you get a lot of time on your hand and run the brown room he had a little truck you might have seen it so I decided to do that and I was thinking if it wasn't for this message and I hope this locks down on you if it wasn't for this message and I wrote down how would I know that was my topic so here's all the things that I wanted to know except

meditate for a moment maybe the musicians can come just meditate on a moment of who you are where God has brought you from where he's brought you to and your eternal destination the streets of gold travel like a thought never be bored not for one iota of an instant of time because there'll be no time you'll never be born eternity is a long time friends you don't want to miss that that's for you knowing that we're dying creatures speaking to dying creatures in Dorne the world has the world and we see words come from we see you spoke to John on the Isle of Patmos and you spoke about that little beast that would come up out of the earth look like a lamb but it was the American Buffalo America has always been pregnant with being a hat we've had George Washington's Abraham Lincoln good men but now we have come to a place where brother instead of time would it go on for 50 years the whole world would be in total insanity father we know this for your words you spoke these words to your prophet your prophets golden and you knew there would be a people right here in West Palm Beach this day you knew that that myself and brother Jack would come in contact and I'd be invited to meet his people and everything is in perfect order nothing takes you by surprise Lord we bring today for those that are in divine attendance that they would seriously consider making themselves that living sacrifice in ways perhaps they haven't done up to now maybe getting rid of the leaven in their lives maybe committing themselves to a personal intimate supernatural fellowship an intimate relationship with you if that's your preference brother Branham said perfect faith you can receive salvation right in your seats you receive healing your seats we don't have to make a big display of this good would perhaps where the JAF might have people come to the altar but I just want you right now consider your soul consider consider eternity we're here on the in the closing moments of time this is the homestretch for a terminal generation and yet your ride is here in the most wicked in the most perverted age like that little widow woman was a famine causing insanity yet you sent Elijah to that little widow woman and our meal has never gone up our oil has never gone out that message is just as fresh today as it was to me the first time I read it and I trust it is to you so my eyes are closed and I'm just going to ask you just between you and God if you say father that's my desire I am sick and tired of being sick and tired I want to I want to replace my wishbone with a spiritual backbone I want to stand up I want to be counted I want you to know that I know how you think of me that you see me justified sanctified you want to fill us with your Holy Spirit and walk

brother waiver and just taking us through that wheel offering from Leviticus right through Kings all the way to the life of the Lord Jesus to brought it up to us just a beautiful beautiful beautiful sermon I just love the way they Illustrated Mary Joseph I don't think ever looked at it all the other people who are identifying telling their parents and brothers and sisters and everybody else to ever have to go along with that testimony it really means something right you know you know but but they did it they were stood and the Lord and Savior he became the ultimate me long Amen everything tied up in him just just so grateful he he withstood the frying brandings frying pan experience and church whatever it wherever you are Amen God will give you strength to make it through the trial that you're going through right now a man used to have a song say this trial won't last too long God won't let it last too long you're not in this thing alone you can make any man you get making glory to God God bless you god bless you just a couple of announcements a man before we leave on today there is and you all are very aware that all the churches that over is so so many in the assembly they are there asking them not to meet we don't know when those numbers might drop and they might not allow us to come here to the house of God but I hope you're getting enough from you to keep you a man you have resources that you can go back to brother already told us about 1200 messages at the Prophet preached we can go back and listen to it a man and be fed so the church we don't know brother Branham told us that there come a time then they'll put padlocks on the door right and we won't be able to come into worship in and we don't know this to me it's just a precursor we were talking about this amen this is what people gotta go through an attributive [Music] this we can't have the week of it but three and a half years of this you don't want to miss the rapture so why are you coming man in coming to church don't play games with this let's get right with God and let's get ready to go home hey man there's one day you won't be able to come and you won't be able to call and text the seals here who's not here hey man wondered who why nobody takes me back you gotta live like that hey man you can be you can be on the other side ain't man on your way home to glory so hey man just let's let's let's listen me this mate let's make it count any manners would come to the house of the Lord and amen I just want to encourage you to do that a couple of things that I just need to mention real quick that our neighbors here the a catering company that came to us and they had this big old thing that they did to fix food for somebody and it got cancelled I don't know if it was because of coronavirus or not I don't know folk was afraid to gather but they cooked all this food and couldn't take it to where they were going to so guess guess what they gave it to they all fasted but we do have containers to go and I know everybody not doing the damn you're fast subduing different fastest fast endure three o'clock and then they he you know so whatever happened whatever fast use and we're not limiting it to the data fast for whatever faster doing is fine but they did they were big brought this to us and we're grateful they considered us and so after service to having table set up police take something and take it home put it in the refrigerator put it in the freezer do whatever you need to do amen just to preserve it by the police please take what they brought to you brought to us also sister Tina found out some information the school district of Palm Beach County they're distributing boxes of food to all of the school district families however there are designated schools that would be open from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. on Tuesday and Thursday of this week of next week this week the children must be with the parents 18 another breakfast and lunch they are distributing to the families and we have on the board here just some information and some of the items that will be there so you can you can you can just see what that is on the board and then on top of that to know where it's going to be you have to go to the school district website to find out what's going to be and so thank God that they're trying to do something just to help the people now now you know if we do go out there and we're in sunny situations Church go prayed up because a folk of just doing some really strange things told us that people are insane and when you're going to famine type conditions and like this you know people get hungry you know grabbing groceries out of people's carts and you just get all kind of stuff we don't want to see on the news that one of our saints got in a fight right then you now we got a frying pan experience going on do you understand what I'm saying hey man I would say some be out there like that if somebody come and take your you take something from you pray for don't sit there and fuss and fight with people just you know I mean I remember the Brandon he had his clothes stolen one time out of it was they were driving through a neighborhood and and somebody in the suitcase fell out the car and he thought the clothes was stolen it was going on so brother Graham say you know what that's fine where we got it maybe they needed it more than ideas so just have that type of spirit right maybe they needed it more than I did you can have it it's fine provide for me God got a raise it that'll bring me groceries you understand glory to God Gaga got a bird room service do you think do you think Amazon got something dark out raisin hallelujah buddy but as saints we don't want to be out there acting like that so soak up rate up it matters understand that you have a lot of people that are just desperate and they just don't have to hope that you have so don't fuss and argue and fight don't do it let people see Jesus the same Jesus that was on the cross that just didn't create us victim then they'll say a word just let him do whatever they need to do that's the way we want to act them during this season so you know these things we'll go we'll go to the store and all kind of stuff but you'll have the opportunity to be a light in the midst of all this darkness and I encourage you to take advantage of the opportunity to have a man but uh but we don't want frying-pan experiences because when our Saints lost a cool you know we talk better than this we're trying to subscribe to be the statue of a perfect man perfect woman and God that's what God has called us to so amen we encourage everybody to apply those principles so just remember those two things a man as we leave tonight brother Ernie will be preaching in Boynton Beach brother James Church so keep him in prayer made man and like he said earlier there's some brothers there in China that have been arrested because they were distributing Bibles and we want to keep those brothers in prayer brother Donny Reagan we pray for him a little remember to keep him in prayer as well and just just just Saints although we need our prayer and you all just remain prayerful during this season don't let the devil draw you into anything that a man don't let him throw you into fear whatever you do it may God is in control God is in control and so whatever happens is gonna happen and and there's things that we we can't control but I want to just read the Word of God Psalms 91 is your protection psalm 46 and brother Jimmy first Psalm 125 this morning yeah I mean you could just do all through the Book of Psalms and find things and just just keep keeping my head and I was just I was looking at that as brother Ernie was you know God was sustaining not only the profit but sustaining the widow everybody else was going through the famine that you represented in that story everybody else could be going through the God will sustain you Donald did he do it with the widow a man in the Prophet but he also did it in the days of amen the to love Israel when they were in Goshen right he sustained them no Lakes front of them hallelujah man they were safe down there in Goshen if you're in Christ you're okay if you're not in Christ you better get there real quick praise the Lord your safeties for Jesus amen god bless you let's have a word
