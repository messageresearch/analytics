these beautiful faces I love you guys so much I brother Jack asked me to share a little bit of what happened over there I tried to put a slide together I tried to get from my mind what I thought was more important and the Lord shut it all down he did not allow me to do that and I said Lord and what is this why I believe in my heart that he's the one that wants to tell you guys what happened over there because if I tell you from my mind or what is what I thought that was the best thing that's just something coming for me and I believe that I'm standing right here and I guess I said Lord then you tell me what to tell them so they can see that it wasn't about me it wasn't about brother Kwaku it was something that God ordained to happen and I was able to see God working before we even left so it wasn't just the trip but it was what God had intended to do and what he wanted to do in this trip whether it was by using me by using brother Quaker by using brother Jack and first of all I would like to thank all of you for your support for your prayers for the giving that you did you didn't have to do that that was just praying for God to provide not only that there was some brothers that when we were actually praying in the feet washing brother Jack prayed and he said that for this sacrifice may God just bless them and may God grant them whatever they need and and in that part I can say that while the time that I was gone over there I tried to leave everything here with the business set up and I did not get no calls of nothing wrong but I did get some cause of some new people looking for me so I can just see how God was fighting while I was gone God was increasing my business over here so I wanted to put that because that was all him and you guys as we went over there we I felt I'm not gonna speak for brother quick but I felt that you guys were praying then you guys I felt like big because I felt that I had with us in this and was helping us was praying for us and we greeted all them in your name we told I they were they have so many questions about you guys spoke up to them about many of you guys and and that that plane pretty much takes care of that the I guess I'll just highlight a couple of things because if I wanted to tell you guys the whole trip we will literally be here all day because there's so much that happened but as we I was we were leaving and we got to the airport we got dropped off we get to the we get checked in and you know we were really exhausted because all the days we're getting stuff ready and preparing things and barely no sleep got up real early doing everything and we really talked so me and brother quake who had planned to get in the air airplane and we were gonna sleep for those three hours because we had a big when we got to Mexico City we were gonna have to do some crazy stuff and we weren't gonna get no sleep so our plan was to sleep those three hours we already spoke about it we get to the check-in and we sit down and we kind of sat down next to a little charging port place so we can get everything charged up and ready to go and I told brother quick go go grab us some coffee and some water I'll be back so I went and did that when I come back brother quake was sitting in that corner there's a young lady sitting where I was sitting and I'm like oh my god brother quake walk he went to work already so basically I go over there he's talking to this lady she actually needed it's a big testimony because that's how everything starting sometimes on a missionary trip which I'm new to this and I it's a lot of things I was learning it's not so much just about when we get to the church and the preaching that's going there and the people at the church this missionary trips have I believe with what I saw they have is more than just at the church it's like the the going the people that we need the people that we see the people that we get to talk to so this young lady sitting there and I get over there and brother quake who is she's Mexican doesn't speak too much English brother quake was there with his bro before I say this I want all you guys to I just spoke to brother quake uu the place where he's at right now he's preaching this morning they could not find a translator and he's about to preach in Spanish so keep him in prayer because he's going through that and so he's talking to her and he introduced me to her she actually needed to charge your phone so she was kind of plugged in right there and he's talking to her and and he introduced me and he's sharing some word to her and he's talking to her and he couldn't really do it in Spanish so that's where the translating already started so he starts talking to her and and he he basically told me he's like he's throwing something he's like give it to her and expand a little bit so you know I start talking explaining to her that he talks and then he tells her something and then I'm talking to her then all of a sudden his phone rang and he had to go take that cross bike started I was sitting there and talking to the young lady there's so many things that were just popping up and it was in like like just just talking to her you know and I'm gonna tell you why it was so so important that we spoke to her well we were talking about so many things and one of the things that really was like a big highlight that I see God how I was working I was I went to Fort Myers to shoot some hearts and Abby asked me to go with me and I took her with me and we were riding and she's like well you know I was in school and this girl asked me about my hair why I don't cut my hair and and now she's like well I just I just I just told her I was like well in first Corinthians 11:15 or 13 this is this is what it says so like I was like oh say that again so I recorded hit and I don't even know why I send it to brother Jack that it was just amazing how she didn't tell her like it was because I go to church she hit her with Scripture so I didn't think nothing other had the video whatever so I'm talking to the girl and I'm telling her so many things and I was explaining to her about how it has to until you have an experience for yourself and you can find yourself in the word if you're just going by other people experience it's not it's not gonna work you know I have to find that and believe that and hold on to scriptures the only thing that's gonna carry you so I was I was I thought about the video I was like actually I got to show you something so I showed the video of I be saying that and when she saw that I kind of like change something because I was like you see that like I'm not telling her that she has to do this she found something for herself and she's holding on to that so that in that part I just wanted to say that because it kind of like shows how she just said that and I recorded and I have that video like it was like things were just happening so the the girl that she was her her step that is a is a switch prophet he's not just doing witchcraft he is like a lord of that kind of like an example of brother Reginald so when she told me that came to my brother Ridge and I said you know what i-i've heard of somebody that went through something like you went through and I told her that I was gonna find that video where he preached here so I can send that that to her and she can kind of like a testimony to see well I she was just going through so many things in her life and she I needed to hear the word so basically I can say here and tell you all about the conversations not about that I want to kind of expand a little bit well when we're sitting there talking for about an hour before our flight was gonna leave and they call our flight and they say start boarding and she's like oh my god she didn't want to stop hearing while we were talking about she said what seat are you sitting on I said I'm we're sitting on c25 she's like I'm gonna see 14 I needed to hear what you had to him I said look if the Lord has a word for you you're gonna he's gonna make a way for you to sit right next to us and she's like my god anyways we get in the plane we sit down everybody gets in the in the seats they're about to take off nobody sits on the last see that we were of me brother Quaker MTC so I said brother quick well I told him what happened because he was in there he said go get her I got up I said Lord wants to speak to you she came and sat down I have videos I have pictures I wasn't able to put it all together because I'm not as good as brother Jack with all that stuff but if anybody has any question he wants to see some of this stuff I have it all in pictures and we can fellowship and I can show you guys and so anyways we got in the plane for three hours it felt like it was ten minutes went up we got in that plane we did not sleep the whole time we were talking to her we were sharing with her we we even went to acts 2:38 we're explaining that to her she was just if I show you the pictures how she was just listening and she just wanted to hear what we had to say to her anyways we got to the point where she wanted prayer we start praying for this lady for this young lady and the lady that's behind she bangs on my seat she said do you guys think you're alone in this plane like she was literally upset because we were sitting there quietly praying for her she I guess she was overhearing what we were saying her so I can just see how the devil is trying to stop God's plan and what was happening anyways we get to the airport down there rather quickly says we're gonna go we were all talking and we couldn't stop talking and we're gonna get the bags we we were two hours late the people that were picking us up were waiting for us for about two and a half hours okay now her bag wouldn't come out in and our bags we already have them so she said you know why you guys are waiting just go ahead I said rather quickly she said it's good you know go ahead and brother quickly said no we're gonna wait for her to get her back and then we're gonna go wait so we waited like another 20 minutes there and then finally she got her back now while we were waiting there she starts talking to me and she starts telling me what happened to her Miami this is what how God works and how God will get somebody and put him in a position to make you go through something for you to receive the world when it's time to receive it she had a business that she was partnering with somebody and they were gonna put half in half and the person didn't have the money yet and she put the whole money down and the person one day before they were coming were supposed to put the money in her bank account so she got to Miami and she had in her bank account five pesos five pesos is about seven cents all right because like or maybe like 15 cents cuz 18 pesos is $1 for us so she that's all that she had and she got to Miami she was gonna be here for four days because she was doing a like it was like a convention for haired she's like a hairdressing she's going to school she got to Miami had nobody here no money she's in the airport she didn't have no food no money no money for the hotel she's stranded she was for four days in Miami with no food well she got some food because she started calling people trying to get some money she was able to get enough money to get the hotel now when she got the hotel all the hotel would give her was breakfast so all she was having was breakfast she had no water she had no transportation to get to the place she had to walk to the place where the convention was that and she was saying that she had brought some little cute skirts some mini skirts that I heard I got into that and I was showing to her how God intends us to dress in care self same way and it's all to protect us and so everything that she was bringing was kind of like just letting her know how God wants to help you he's not saying those things to go against he's going against that nature that we are born with all right so it kind of helped to be able to tell that but she was walking with her little mini skirts that she had and she said that the guys were she was going down Biscayne guys were stopping trying to pick her up uh like like she went through those four days and she could not like no food no water only the hotel like she winning she got enough money to get an uber one time in the uber driver she got in the car she was hungry and the uber driver started like hitting on her and he was like do you need food like you see how bring in exactly what she needed you need food I buy you food you want to go get something then he asked him for her phone number and she was afraid to give him the wrong number because he if he would call it or something so she gave it a random the guy was harassing her like she went through all this stuff and she was devastated when she got to the airport she was just thinking about like this is over and she was hurting she didn't know she couldn't believe she went through this and there she sits down and here's the world of comforting word telling how much Jesus loves her telling how much God the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by God this is what she's gonna get and she was in a position when she was telling me this outside brother quick ooh I see what she wants to look what God did so she can hear that was the first thing that happen then after we walk away or my phone wasn't working where the quake whose phone wasn't working this Mexico City is the second largest city in the world this Airport is miles and miles that's how I look maybe it wasn't miles we could not call the people that we're waiting for us we didn't know where they were they didn't know where they were at we didn't know how they look they didn't know how we looked so we're walking away and we're lost in this Airport and we didn't know where to go in brother quick was right let's just go back inside we're gonna pray God is gonna do something when we walk back in the girl that we waited for at the back place was walking right by there and we found we connected with her again and she was able to connect connect with the people call them and we found the people so I was waiting for her then God we out of our heart even though people are waiting for then God made a way for us right that this is just like I mean just touching stuff I wanted to also tell you guys that this the the church that we were at if I show you guys the picture the floor was there there was dirt and rocks where the pulpit is that the people there just serve God because they love God the ones that are Silla I saw the people that were serving God and the people that were going to church it's two different two different types of conversation with those people the people were truly serving God they were just happy to be in the presence of the Lord the people that were going to church has some something to complain about they had some kind of some kind of this wasn't good this wasn't good like pointing out the bad things and I just want to let you guys know that this is happening everywhere those that brother Branham says these three kind of people in every church they have that everywhere over there there's very we have a lot of young people here the young people over there are running like crazy there was no young people in the church when we did the prayer line the people were coming up and most of the things that they were asking about was feeling of the Holy Ghost a lot of people seeking for the Holy Ghost a lot of people seeking for the Holy Ghost but that's that's good but in another way it's like so many people in this place are seeking for the Holy Ghost you know that that's that's a good thing but a lot of people are not filled with the Holy Ghost so they're a lot of people are seeking for the Holy Ghost and a lot of the mother she's crying out for the children like that was the biggest thing in the prayer lines was that the first message that we sir pre the brother Quaker preached was the transformation power of prayer that just like it was they needed that it was like they needed of it I was at first I was like you know such a simple you know message that you preach I was talking about the Quaker about his life we didn't come here to confuse the people with all this revelation we came here to get them in the right track where they need to be and they need to start praying they need to start asking for the Holy Ghost they need to start seeking God really you know so so basically we had a wonderful time there we had only three services at the place we got to pray we got to go to the house to a hospital and pray for a brother we got to go and pray for a couple of other people and the the people over there are just like really really sweet and they really love God and it's not because they have a fancy church or like we'd like this is fancy I'm telling you guys like this church if they had a church like this that would be like you guys have to see the pictures you know so brother quake ooh after I came back by the quake ooo went to to another another place and he's been over there he's had a couple services he's preaching today and he's coming back on Monday morning and also I wanted to let you guys know on the way back the people that picked us up which was some believers uncle and Auntie they're not message believers they just picked us up they picked some when we got then they picked us up on the way back and when we got there we were sitting in the car and they were taking us to their house and the guy starts asking me so kinda what is it that you guys really do what you what he said that you guys are preaching and all this so I start talking him a little bit about what what we do and stuff and what we're doing and they start asking some questions now these kind of questions that they're asking sometimes you have people in the world and they're asking questions because they want to prove God wrong see that when you have those kind of questions then that's somebody that's trying to prove God wrong that's they're not looking for God but the questions that they were asking were questions about like why is this why like that for example why was Lucifer if he was the angel that God had made how did he have evil you know so we kind of took him to like I say a 45 how God made good and he may lie in darkness and we showed him that and we showed him so many other things and it was it was such a blessing because they kind of were asking certain questions that where I can actually make the difference between their going to serve God or not you know so that was another time that we had off the church that we had to share the room we spent many many hours with them like five hours in three of those hours speaking to them so we got to minister to them and and basically that I don't know what else to say I mean there's so many other things that I can go into details but I just want to let you know that the trip was a success we were able to bring the Word of God we were able to see the people that God wanted us to see we went to another church and it's a small little congregation that the pastor with his such a blessing because he has a daughter that's nine year old a Sunday okay son that is eight years old and a little daughter that's seven years old and it was it was wonderful it was like I can see how how the love of God was in that little church because that his family was the one that were actually praising God more than the actually congregation that was there so we were able to see the love of God over there we were we had a wonderful time and I just if any of you want to see some other pictures so you can see how that what the church looked like and what the church that we have it was amazing and I just want to thank you guys for your prayers your support and hopefully we'll get to share more about the whole trip with detail god bless you praise the Lord Amen god bless you brother Josue God richly bless you and brother quaint COO for your

strategies patience war strategies godliness right war strategies brotherly kindness and then we'll have to cap it off with cherry hey man so it's a little journey we don't take it before a little time here cuz we'll be having some different people coming in and out over these next few weeks so just ministering to a start with brother Nathan on next week and I forgot to mention the last Friday of this month I'd like to do a questions and answers a man's session for the church so I'm asking that if if you got some spiritual questions a man things regarding the word or the message the Bible or the message just drop them and then write it down on a sheet of paper and put it in the box give me some time to study it so I'll be prepared for that night because I wouldn't want you to just kind of pop it up on that night I got a question yeah put it in the box hey man we'll get to it cuz if it's not in that box we might not get to it but I do want to want to take time to try to answer some of your questions if we can praise the Lord let so let's read a man a couple scriptures I do think I want to start with Judges chapter 7 and then also a 2nd Peter a 1 is also where we'll read from 2 today as well judges chapter 7 a man starting here with verse 1 a man you all just bear with me Amen it says then jerubbaal which is Gideon and all the people that were with him rose up early and pitched beside the well of Herot so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them by the hill of Moreh in the valley and the Lord said in a giddy and the people that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands less Israel bought themselves against me saying my own hand have saved me now therefore go to proclaim in the ears of the people saying whose service fearful and afraid let him return and depart early from Mount Gilead and they returned of the people 20 and 2000 and there remained ten thousand and the Lord said unto Gideon the people are yet to many bring them down into the water and I will try them for the their and it shall be that of whom I say unto thee this shall go with thee the same shall go with the end of whomsoever I say unto thee this shall not go with thee the same shall not go so he brought down the people unto the water and Lord said unto Gideon everyone that Lapith of the water with his tongue as a dog Lapith him shalt thou set by himself likewise everyone that bow down upon his need to drink and the number of them that lapped putting their hand to their mouth were three hundred men but all the rest of the people bow down upon their knees to drink water the Lord said in a gideon by the three hundred men that lapped will I save you and deliver the Midianites into thine hand and let all the other people go every man unto his place Amen so we'll just turn over here to second Peter chapter one as well and we'll read from there praise the Lord 2nd Peter chapter 1 a man a man God is good a man second Peter chapter one hallelujah a man who says this in 2nd Peter 1 Simon Peter a servant an apostille of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity so if these things be in you Amen remember it's an inside job alright so if these things be you and not only in you but abound and you and abound they make you that you should neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ and that's a powerful statement all right man you you don't be in the Bride of Christ you don't want to be barren and unfruitful I understand a man in you know in Old Testament days it was taboo to be bearing it unfruitful right when you got married that was the purpose of getting married to bring forth children praise the Lord that that's the way it was and women prayed to God that they would have babies right and it still you know today you know we have some of the same situation but nowadays people don't want kids they want dogs and cats and hallelujah amen and maybe they dress the dog up and put them in a stroller and hallelujah somebody a man but you yourself not supposed to be barren or unfruitful right Amen in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you should never fall that's pretty quickly father we thank you for a man the ability to read the word but we know it takes the Holy Spirit to help us see what it is that we're reading God you have allowed us to embark upon a little journey here talking about war strategies and we pray that the Holy Spirit would make things clear to us bless our gathering Lord be glorified and magnified here in this place today bless the Saints that are not able to be here God for whatever the reason we trust Lord that you would just speak to them as well right where they are father's in Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you can be seated another scripture that I just want to read real quickly a man is coming from numbers 21 verse 14 I was [Music] I had this little thought that I've been you know just sitting on and and just waiting on how the Lord was just gonna bring it and so many different things that I was thinking about and I got a little text I want to say me it could have been about a month ago I'm not exactly sure but I got a little something and brother brother Nathan had sent this this scripture over to me and when he sent the script I said well hey hey that that that uh you know that that's kind of touching a little thought that I had on war strategies and and and then as we kept fellowship and around you know this that little thought it began to just kind of develop where I knew I would need to take the statue of a perfect man and bring this together but but here in numbers 21 14 it just makes this comment says wherefore it is said in the book of the Wars of the Lord what he did in the Red Sea and in the books of Arnon and you know there's many books that people look at when they get war strategies and things that nature different different military leaders that they go back and and they look at but I think the greatest military leaders a man that we've ever had is our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ a man and and and here the scriptures say that in the book of the Wars of the Lord so we want to look at some different war strategies that God has used you know our God is a military genius a man and he's one that ain't never lost a battle praise God don't matter who he got on the battlefield he won't lose the battle a man because he's the one that's in charge he's the one leading this army a man in church I don't know about you but I'm glad to be a soldier in the army of the Lord hey man I got my war clothes on me man I know that I'm in a battle I know that that I can't be defeated the same God that gave David Protection hallelujah in his battles the same God that gives us protection and not battle no matter how big the giant is a man we're still gonna be victorious they say the bigger they are the harder they fall right hey man so if you got big problems this morning your big car gonna take care of your big problem and whatever strategy you have to use to give you victory then we just follow that strategy oh praise God a man a man a man so just bear with me on today we want to just kind of get get get started down this but like I said I want to use a man for a background here the statue of a perfect man and I want to encourage you if you can maybe over the next few weeks just start listening to that sermon and a man just listen and keep listening God will speak to you in it but I want to start here by reading Amen a couple of things from this particular sermon the the Prophet says this it says Peter is saying here how that we must be partakers of his divine nature a man Peter is saying that as we're reading there in 2nd Peter 1 Peter said we must be partakers of his divine nature he says now each one of us are trying to grow into the Statue of God now your whole purpose for coming to church your whole purpose a man for being called to this word is so that you could grow into the stature of God amen God didn't call you just to be a church member a man God wants to ax reflect himself in you so that you won't be barren or unfruitful a man God is trying to do something special just for you glory to God amen that the whole purpose Amen it's not just going to church thank God for that but no it's so that we can grow into the stature of God hallelujah amen when he brings a word to us sometimes it corrects us it meant that that word in correctness is to grow us into his stature their things owners that God got to cut off of us amen and we got it just like a sheep we got to be willing to be sheared a man willing to let these things go because we want to be like Jesus huh to be like Jesus how we longed to be like him so meet so humbly man we want to be like Christ and then he goes on I'm skipping down to paragraph 61 man in this in that same quote he says last Sunday I preached glory to God says last Sunday night I preached on the key in the kiyose faith the faith faith holds the key hallelujah faith holds the key and the key is the scripture a man faith holds the key but the key is scripture now stay stay with me here since and Christ is the door see so faith takes the little hinges of the scripture and unlocks the glories and good of God I'm looking for that to a man be unlocked this morning faithful that takes the little hinges of the scripture and unlocks the glorious and good of God out to his people Oh hallelujah see so it's faith holds the key that unlocks Christ to the people unlocks it reveals him now let me just inject something there you know why we're talking here you know about faith and everything on today there was a brother one time a man he was he had a he had an apartment I believe it something like that and and and he lost the key to the apartment and I just could not find it and he had a arrange for us some guests to come to his house and and and here he you know the guests are only way to the house and he can't find the keep it looking for four days a man can't find the key to get into the apartment because faith I mean a kid I mean the kids needed to gain access I love your faith is your key that's gonna allow you to gain access to the glories of God hallelujah so so so this this brother could not find the key and and what he decided to do he say he just picked up the phone and he called the Prophet he called brother branham he said brother branham where is the key anything just acting like that where's the key brother branham and i and i the prophet just said a word of Prayer and through that God revealed where the key was who told her brother this is where the key is and it didn't breath didn't brother branham said now now now for some people you know they may have a little problem with me saying have a brother call me up to say where's the key he said but now I understand he said in Scripture when when the muse were lost hallelujah amen when Saul had lost his animals his daddy lost the animals amen we want to call them mules but you'll see a different word and amen when you read the scripture but these animals were lost hallelujah and so so had a servant that was with me say in this city is a prophet any say we go to the Prophet now they can go to anybody else but if they got to that prophet they knew that the Prophet would be able to tell them where the animals were hallelujah and if God could do that for Saul about some news a man God can use this prophet today about a key praise God and I want to tell you even though the Prophet might hear God is still here and if you have an e god I show you right wait a sec please [Music] God has got it but you got to come with the key of faith it will unlock the glories of God God can show you in a dream exactly where something that you just you just sitting there and you like man I've been looking for this thing for days but you pray and just ask God Lord showed me how to hide where this thing at God I'll show you in a dream right I remember you know one time sister Tina lost a thumb driver is very important to her lost that thumb drive and actually prayed and you know just Lord I don't know where where this thing actually prayed and somehow Ange brought it and put it a man right there [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] glory to God I believe that search a man a man faithful faith will unlock this faith well unlock this we got to have faith hey man let's go on and just kind of keep going here he says faith holds the key unlocks Christ to the people unlocks it reveals it so today we're gonna try to take that same key to your locked away to become a virtuous Christian right so we're trying to take the key of faith amen and remember now the scripture here glory to God faith holds the key but the key is scripture right so he's saying so now we're gonna try to take that and that take that same key and unlocked a way to become a virtuous Christian amen in the Statue of God and to be a living tabernacle for a living God to dwell in he says remember God reveals himself in three ways the first time he revealed himself himself in a pillar of fire that was called the Fatherhood a man in the pillar fire that was called the Fatherhood then that same God made manifested in Jesus Christ which he built a body made this party alright so he was dwelling in Christ amen as the Sun hallelujah but listen now thirdly through the deaths of that body he says he sanctified a church that he can dwell in it was God above us amen God with us when he came in Jesus but now in the form of the Holy Spirit a man huh it is now God in us and it's the same God all the time hallelujah so we understand what we are I was God above us God with us now is God in us he said that's the reason it was called Father Son Holy Spirit not three gods but three offices of one God they have only thought of that at the Nicene council we wouldn't have we have we wouldn't have been all messed up would we it may say that's right not three gods that people couldn't understand how Jesus talked to the Father and he and the father are one it says well there then the whole thing is sure just unfolds it certainly see it's not three gods it's three offices now you know anytime I look at that scripture because you know I believe it's the Lord our God is one that's what the Bible said right so so when we see Father Son and Holy Ghost says not three gods there's one God and three different offices hallelujah and there's so many ways that we can explain that but I wanted to use just for an example just for that today you know there are certain movies that people watch and an actor a man is actually performing multiple roles hallelujah Amen depending on the scene he changes who he is or she changes who she is depending on the scene but but if you are you know I mean you know being that you're a person that kind of a man you can kind of detect it's not a different person this is the same guy maybe all they did was kind of taking him and they put some some gray hair on his head huh make him look like a grandfather amen then he takes the gray hair off and now he looks like the father glory to God amen and they just keep working with the same character amen I mean it's the same actor he's actually performing different characters in the same movie on the same plane amen and this is nothing but a big play of life same God different times when it's lights action camera when it's cold on the scene you begin to act father then he acted as God whipped us in Jesus and now he's God in us as a Holy Spirit it's the same God I hope we get that the same God that was above us that created all of this that we have the same God that walked in Jesus it's the same God that's walking in us hallelujah not a different God he's the same God so to think the things that we saw in Jesus we now should see in us let's go on a little further sense what is it what is it says God condescending to his creation God wants to be worshipped the word God means object of worship and it's God trying to condition his people so he can get from them what he created them for I wanna I want to make sure we get that God is trying to condition his people so he can get from them what he created them for he never made you to be something else besides a son and daughter of God if you have missed that of being a son and a daughter of God you have missed the mark your whole purpose a man for being here is so that you could be a son or a daughter of God and if you miss that then you've missed the mark he says and miss the word sin si en means to miss the mark mr. mark then if I'm shooting at a target Drive attack at 50 yards and I shoot take my gun down and shoot and I miss it four or five inches what's that what's that what happens what's happened my gun needs tuning up oh I love that statement see ya last week we brought our guns here they got tuned up a man because we were missing the mark right so he said he said he sentenced I I'm one that believe God don't just give thoughts just to give thoughts God always know what he's talking about I might not know what I'm talking about but God I always know what he's talking about and God will come and say something because you need to be tuned up oh I love that a man I remember a man brother Troy made a comment about a guitar a man and how you have to take the string on the guitar and you have to tune it up hallelujah and and when you're actually tuning up the string on the guitar you actually adding stress to it you're tightening that string because it too loose do came do nothing with it come on if your life is too loose you live in any kind of way God can't do nothing with that so what do you have to do is put a little stress on it and he tighten it up and and you hear that thing go ping ping ping ping okay now we ready to do something now we can play and brother I say the guitar string is designed to be able to handle the stress can I say something you love a guitar string and God has designed to where you can handle the stress please God you've been made to him to live glory to God we destinated to handle it alright now come on church let's go on a little further it man it says I miss it four or five inches what's after my gun nice tool enough there's something wrong and if I miss faith in God I miss being a Christian says God puts you here to be a Christian if you're off to one side I love these quotes if you're off to one side come back and get tuned up if you're off to one side that's I say go back and listen to this sermon play this in your house right because God is speaking something through the Prophet to us if you're off to one side oh my come back and get tuned up they meant and there's only one thing can tune you up I like that only one thinking to you that's the scripture listen the Holy Spirit in the scripture tune you brings you directly on to the target again that's right I say amen to that I believe I believe that you know and see I just kind of felt last week you know we needed a little tuning you know you know if you are the Lord just kind of kept dealing with me that went on that thought and and you know me and brother Quinton was just kind of fellowship and around it and and the Lord just kind of brought back to my attention you know it's a it's an inside job these virtues and things that's going to be on the inside you can't go to the grocery store and buy a pound of faith hey give me a quart a man of virtue no you can't do that this thing got to be burst on the inside of you and if it's been birthed inside of you then it's got to manifest itself on the outside right you know and you know we were just kind of talking and fellowship and I just begin to think on the a couple different things amen you all remember brother Branham talked about the revival that struck a man I believe was Lake Michigan and he talked about that revival a man that was on the water and he said he said it wasn't that it was new water add it to the lake he said it was the same water all the time but what happened is that inside the lake Amen it began to wash the trash that was on the inside people that don't come along and drop trash into the water the water say I can't do nothing with this Amen I'm not taking this in so the water begins to have its own personal revival and it takes that trash and throws it up onto the shore amen the river happened on the inside of the water and what we needed to revolve and I happened on the inside of us to take the trash out of our life and wash it onto the shore oh yeah that's what God's trying to do hey man you know I just began to think also you know how my god you see her a butterfly amen but before that beautiful butterfly took them colors he had to go through a process hey man that butterfly started out as a caterpillar amen that caterpillar had to going through a go through a cocoon process or glory and I want to tell you some aside in the cocoon right now amen we're in a cocoon but that's okay you stay right there brother better say now don't cut them out of that cocoon if you cut the caterpillar out the cocoon he will not develop properly so you have to allow the butterfly to were smaller tools that we got ten curvature is the law because in the process you're gonna get some beautiful wings as the after that caterpillar come through this cocoon process it's a transformation that is taking place it's no longer caterpillar it's a big beautiful butterfly hallelujah but all that happened we're inside the cocoon it's an inside job all right let me go oh oh I feel good just giving a couple quotes here from this sermon I'm not I won't read these a man we won't put them up on the screen but I just want to just just a little highlights that I'm pulling up from the same message here statue of a perfect man the profits that the church is now supposed to be taking the place with Christ carrying on his ministry he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also yet a little while in the world see it's me no more yet you shall see me for I a man shall be with you even in you to the end of the world see there it is carrying on his work so the church is now supposed to be taking the place of Christ a man he also says this my god it says but so many of us now we understand that we're supposed to be taking the place of Christ but it's a so many of us try to do the works of Christ before the reflection of Christ is in us so many of us try to do the works of Christ before the reflection of Christ is in us he say now there's the trouble he says we find those things happening he says you know I know it we see these stumbles along the road we find the scrap heap of ministers of Christians piled along the road because they didn't go into it right my love I love that statement see you know we got to approach this thing the right way make sure it's an inside job don't do this from the outside you know I'm gonna just kind of skip around a little bit but you talk about how a sheep a man is not axed to manufacture wool a man a sheet actually bears wool right he said now if a goat a goat get trying to manufacture it he said but he'll never a man no matter how much he tried to manufacture it he'll never be a sheep just like a bus that could never be a duck no matter how much that bus it would take dove feathers and stick it in itself and say now now now look I'm a dog it's probably and say he his shape is not like the tough right we know I don't care how much you got white pebbles oh your don't look like a dog you don't have nothing inside that acclaims you the way we don't tell whether you're both of the dogs let's put some dead carcass down and you might have white feathers but when the dead carcass comes on the scene amen then that buzzer would go and find a smorgasbords amen the dog won't have nothin to do with it but it's something about the nature of the Buzzard that everything to do with it huh what we needed to have our nature change and the nature is on the inside God is doing that he's doing that even right now listen he goes on to say so many ins to try to do the works of Christ before the reflection of Christ is in us that's the trouble with finding those things happening you know it I know it we see these stumbles along the road we find scrap he of ministers of Christians piled along the road because they didn't go into it right I want to make sure we're approaching this thing right he said a blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us it changes our nature that's what the blood supposed to do the blood of Jesus Christ will cleanse us and change our nature by sending upon us the Holy Spirit then we becoming to the divine nature of God then we become a dwelling place for God it's only after the Holy Spirit has to come upon you and change your nature then you become a dwelling place for God he goes on to say this he says and when you're a Christian you just bear the fruit of the Spirit you don't manufacture it you don't try to make it up you just bear it just like that that seeped in just bear wolf amen when you're truly a Christian you just bear these things you bear the fruit of the Spirit it says now don't make yourself something that you're not because you know and in this message he talks about how some people have a natural day just born with a natural patience they born with their nature and just just they born with certain things they they just do this they don't even profess Christianity but they still do certain things oh my y'all y'all ever seen folk that don't even profess to be Christians but live a better life sometimes than we live y'all ever seen that and I don't mean they're gonna make it a heaven but what I think God does allow that to happen to kind of show us where we need to kind of come up we call ourselves Christians let's be Christians all right now hallelujah glory to God amen I come at the light when something happened the Christians are blowing the horn yeah somebody do something is to Christians that's jumping like that car the first and you know I'm gonna tell you now you don't tell me why the Christians got to do that and then you got you got you got all the other unbelievers I'm say folk just looking at you with the hair about I can't believe they just said that now you use a curse word you use curse word but your actions does not does not reflect Christ can you see Jesus fussing them out like that come on somebody hey man I just had a conversation and then somebody say well Jesus didn't go to the temple and beat him I I said one time how many times you doing it glory to God all right I'm going on Church a man a man a man a man hallelujah he goes on to say this he says don't don't make yourself something that you're not you just become what you're supposed to be and then it takes care of itself says you must be born again and what that means that means you got to be changed you must be changed there's got to be a change you can't be born again without having faith alright I'm going a little further here a couple scriptures that I want to just read to you a man Hebrews 11 and six and also Hebrews 11 and one this says but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him a man without faith it's impossible to please God it's impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him Hebrews 11:1 it says this now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen and the Prophet makes this statement he says the foundation of Christianity it's faith in the Word of God that's our very foundation hallelujah and sitting out when you're trying to build a house you know the Lord blessed you by the land and you go out and you uh you get your the people to work on it and when the first thing they got their do they get the land prepared and then they put a foundation now and what happens with we as Christians we see the foundation and we're like oh my is finished no the house is not finished the house is just getting started hey man all you got is the foundation now I want you to take that spiritually amen you got baptized that's great that's just a foundation amen but God wants to take you further than your baptism God wants to take you further than your repentance God wants to take you to a place where it's him manifesting himself in you it used to be God above us Denham was got with us now it is God in us hallelujah and if it's God innocent has got to be the same God of the Bible if you're worried what we see if his characteristics and Scripture and what we see when we read that is what we got to see in our lives today hallelujah live we got things lined up appropriately faith is your foundation faith is your foundation to Christianity but after that and this is why Peter said add to your faith virtue and to your virtue knowledge to knowledge temperance temperance godliness brotherly kindness and so on and so forth you got to add these things after you have faith after you have your foundation we still got to put some walls up we got to put a roof on a man we got we got a we got it we got to put some flooring again we got we got it we got to put some furniture in we got to make this thing a house hallelujah amen God wants you to be his house and when I'm thinking I was thinking about this you know what your purpose for getting a house a man is so that if people want to send you a mail you something you can have an address to give them come on somebody a man you not just give them the the post-office box that's that the post-office box is not your address that's a borrow mail box a man that's a borrowed mailbox but when you get your own house amen then they can send you mail Amazon can drop it off on your on your front porch when you have your own house hallelujah amen God wants to know what is his residence what's his address hey man can you say Lord I'm your address you can live right here you can deliver mail here you can deliver inspiration here you can deliver scripture here whatever you need to deliver here a man I'm ready to take a card God meet an address Amen hallelujah Amen he wants to live at your address inside of you amen let's look at this glory scripture that will just bring in to support that acts 7 verse 47 through 49 and then I got a few more things I just want to hit and we'll move on we're talking about war strategies faith a man today a solemn of Solomon built him a house Solomon Solomon built him a house howbeit the Most High who dwelleth not in temples made with hands as says the prophet since heaven is my throne and earth is my footstool what house will you build me sayeth the Lord or what is the place of my rests God need an address what's the place of my rest and and what we're telling Lord I mean Lord I'm the place of your rest amen come do this thing on the inside of me change me from the inside so I can be the place of your rest God needs some hams God needs some feet amen he wants to use your hands he wants to use your feet glory to God let me go on but just a few statements about what faith is oh my my lord my lord this is coming up from a sermon faith is our victory a man the Prophet makes this statement says now faith is a conqueror faith is an overcomer glory to God faith is a conqueror faith is an overcomer it just isn't a peacemaker it overcomes faith is the victory that overcomes the world what does it do what is faith what is the Conqueror a conquer and victory is the same to conquer it means to beat down so your faith has got to beat down your doubt have you ever let your doubt get a beat down sometimes we build up doubt but let you down actually get a beat down hallelujah amen and when it when it's got the beat down don't even try to help them up keep your foot on this neck I'm gonna keep you tattled anytime a man you've been praying for something in and expecting God to do something and then finally when God come through your face get elevated and your doubt should be doubted a man your doubt should experience a beat-down huh you need to shout when that happen you need to give God glory and praise when that happened I don't know about you but I like to tell the devil didn't I tell you so I told you I was gonna do it with you but didn't I tell you he was gonna come through he did exactly what I was expecting a man he meant he may not come when you want him but he's always on time amen that I mean he say he say faith glory to God to conquer it means to beat down I love that to override to handcuff to throw into prison it means that the sin that once ruled you you rule it now don't give me that kind of faith Amen the sin that once rule you the mind battles that once rule you you read them now listen it means that you have overcome you flipped it you're greater than it is oh I love that they say oh I feel religious right now I feel the same way which was first a sinner or savior a savior for saviors more powerful than a sin which was first the healer or sickness it couldn't be it couldn't be a healer unless it was over the sickness it is a healer it could conquer the sickness and faith is the victory that overcomes every curse of the devil faith is the victory all right let me go on a little bit more why Christ speak a man hallelujah now now and and and and as we're talking about war strategy because you know you're in a you're in a war right now a man and and in this war you might need you've been gonna need one of these strategies to overcome it meant some some Wars it's gonna require your faith just to be activated in order to overcome and some wars that might be virtue you're just gonna need a little strength a manpower for service some you're gonna need some temperance some you're gonna need patience other wars you're gonna need godliness hallelujah some brotherly kindness oh my goodness others charity and you know when charities display charity doesn't charity is not imma love you because you love me imma love you because you did something for me charity say imma love you regardless of what you did to me the Bible say love covers or what multitude of faults of sins love covers it and see this is the love of God that we got to have one for the other a man I I I mean III know we have to speak these things because this is the this is the objective this is the gold this is what we're reaching for a man all right he says this and why cry speak for you see faith sees what God wants done hallelujah oh I hope this goes in faith doesn't look at the present time I'm I tell you what I just I gotta tell the devil I'm not looking at what you're doing I don't care nothing about what you're doing I'm seeing well beyond this I see this church and revival I see the gifts released I see that the the power of the Holy Ghost just move in I mean I brought a scripture last week in Exodus 40 but what I what I forgot to give y'all if y'all if y'all went home and read the rest of Exodus 40 what it actually did after they got everything in place Moses worked from the inside out and he built the the the the most holy place did he built the inner Court then he built that out of court after they had everything established in the glory of the Lord came down and feel where the minister could not even stand the minister and when I saw that in the Bible I said Lord once this thing is set up right from the inside I'm expecting first I have a service where the preacher won't even be able to preach hallelujah and I'm not talking about something that just get on your flesh I'm talk about something that go in and begin to work out something that just don't give you a bubble - but something that actually takes out the meanness takes out that hatred they meant something that heals to hurt come on somebody something that changes you from the inside don't tell me God can't do it I see them do it Amen I had our heart that was indifferent but one day I walked into the right service Amen with my indifferent heart and the Holy Ghost came down at the end of the service remember what the preacher preached but I remember the experience a matter where God took that thing out my heart Amen I couldn't go but hug my brothers and hug my sisters and show the love of God it really made it from the inside I'm looking for God to do that again I'm looking for him to do that again so I'm not moved by what I see the devil do it now that's a scarecrow to try to keep me away from what God has planned for this church hallelujah the devil didn't started so he can't stop it glory they used to sing a song destroy half the world did not give it to me and since the world didn't give it the world came take it away my this peace I have this love I have everything I got God gave it to me and I ain't letting no devil take it hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God amen amen my daddy told me since it's Father's Day my daddy told me you just keep hitting the rock and one day the rock gonna break sometimes you come to church you feel like you're just hitting the rock but then I'm gonna keep hitting and it's gonna break amen and I'm crazy enough to believe that it's water in the rock so I'm gonna hit the rock expecting water to come out hey man we need we need a nice Amen Gousha all right Holy Ghost Kusha right we did we just need a real nice oh my god God do some some great things here I'm under expectation but that's what I'm praying for I'm believing God for a man we need it we need it we need it we need it we need it we needed a man you know I'm talk about our Holy Ghost that won't let you bypass your brother when you go outside mmm that's the Holy Ghost sometime but not the one that no you may make sure that head turn and you dotnet going the other way I'm talking about our Holy Ghost I said no no I'm going to hug my brother I'm going to hug my sister amen hallelujah you are my brother you're my brother you're my sister so take me by the hand huh we're gonna do this thing together there's a real Holy Ghost y'all a Holy Ghost that keep things together while the devil trying to break it apart but there's a Holy Ghost that can keep it together they've didn't brother branham talked about the woman with the Rockbox dream amen and say say that as the water was covered the streams was coming down five Street he say he say they was gonna look at certainly thought the box might break a man with this water flowing through say they say the Box gonna break say no no not this box it's not gonna break he say because the honey sticks amen it doesn't break the honey keeps it together the love of God keeps it together it won't break let me prophesy glory to God when the enemy comes in like a flood search among the expectation for the thermocouple race if you didn't know i'ma tell you right now the devil is still a liar hallelujah Amen he will not he will not will not will not have any victory because faith is our victory all right Church let me try to stay with this I've just I feel like I'm battling up here this is a war going on it's a what but I got a war strategy now I got a war strap me a war strategy we're gonna overcome the day with faith faith in what God said all right look look he says this amen faith doesn't look at it at the present time faith don't see this here faith looks to see what God wants and it works accordingly that's what faith does it sees what God wants and what God wants done and faith operates through that says faith is a long-range vision some of us got a short-range vision we need long-range vision we got to see we got to see further than a situation we got to see further than the circumstance we got to see further than what's in front of us do you know what's in front of you can change amen you have the power to change that your actions reactions has the power to change what's in front of you hallelujah faith is long-range vision it don't lower its sights a man it holds to the target amen any good shooter knows that that's the long range it's a telescope it's a binocular that you don't look around you don't look around here you don't use binoculars to look to see what time it is you got your watch here you can see exactly you don't take binoculars out looking at somebody think something's wrong with you you put binoculars on to see something that's way out and when you get it in the scope do you realize what's way out becomes present you understand that once that thing is in scope and I can see it if I can see it then I know it's there no matter if the person next to me say I can't see it it ain't not neck you don't have the binoculars but when I got it in school whether I get my sights set on this thing I live with an expectation how do I go to bed with an expectation because I'm seeing something that others cannot see my face is bringing that thing I'm getting closer and closer to my manifestation that's best that's only for a couple of y'all but I'm gonna take it I'm getting closer and closer to my manifestation thank you Jesus amen any day 9 my manifestation to be here amen I already started my shower I got my dance I got we all start see y'all ready no I'm just saying he's been so good to me I can't tell it all oh my mind all right let's see listen it's a bit knocking that you don't look around here you don't use we're not going to look to see what time it is see you don't use that but use your binoculars to look away off and faith to us that faith picks up gospel Occulus both of them both sides the new and Old Testament and sees every promise that he made and faith sees it out yonder and faith chooses that regardless of what the present tense says here y'all y'all not reading with me you needed faith it's a choice oh my god you you make the choice that are you gonna see this day and how you gonna respond to this thing but faith chooses that regardless of what the present tense says here he looks at the end he don't drop his sights down to look this away he looks out yonder he keeps the crosshair dead center on the word that's what faith does that's the faith that's in a man that does those things you know the Prophet was talking about faith leaders talk about the man that that came and said you know I'm not worried that it should come underneath my roof say but if you speak the word only then my serving to be made whole and and and what the man was was trying to get Jesus to see is that I'm a man of an under Authority and if I say this and I tell this when the go he'd go I tell this from the car me come he say the same way I had that authority I see you as a man of authority and you can tell spirits to leave you can tell them to come you can tell them to go you have that same type of third Jesus I never found faith like this in Israel he said you say this faith moved him and he says say he say he pretty much said you know he say if you just speak the word only I know my sertanejo Jesus poking the man was made whole right and brother branham said what that was was to show that distance made no difference distance does not make a difference if you got faith in God I handle it where it need to be handled this this makes no difference oh I wish I could get something out of there you don't need to know about sin the water face send the prayer face the Bible say he sent his word to heal if you would just open up your mouth and decree some page it's the same guy living inside of you and if he brought light didn't bring healing now whatever got it it's all based on your faith don't limit God you know and I just love this you know because I think about even in healing God used different strategies to bring healing and this man it was speak the word only and the woman with the issue of blood is if I could touch His garment but at the same time while a woman with the issue of blood trying to touch His garment you had Cyrus trying to get him to come to his house his faith was I don't want to touch the garment I want to at my house you had another man that said you just dropped me down in his presence I know I'll be made hope response a everybody's faith but it still reaches God and it still produces a result whatever your faith is just release it in God's hands whatever your battery is activate your faith and watch what God do a man I look at this war because this is not Gideon's war this is God's war hallelujah when we read the scripture you know there's there's been many a man that we can look at in Scripture that God used faith a man in order to bring a victory and you know let me just just you know Hebrews 11 30 says by faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they were compassed about seven days just just thinking about that you know the by faith the wall Jericho fell down here they had this this strategy that God gave them was just to march around the walls one time per day for seven days and then on the seventh day March seven times right this was the strategy amen and when they used this particular strategy it did exactly what God said and Joshua tone said now don't shout until I tell you to shout don't don't do anything don't let any secrets out a man don't do anything until we beat you to do it and on that seventh day at the seventh time God I mean Josh to say now it's time to shout and when they shouted all the walls came down except the part where rehabs house was Amen and it was their faith in God strategy they never even lifted up a weapon Oh hallelujah Amen they never lifted up a spear all they did was march around the way God told and some things you have to do because God told you to do Amen hallelujah glory the same way they did not lift up a spear you don't need to lift up your voice no I hope you get me a man that they didn't have to shoot a cannon in this battle this strategy was keep your mouth closed are you with me the in this matter it was keep your mouth closed hallelujah don't say nothing till it's time to say something so so y'all is facing a battle where you gonna have to keep your mouth closed and just smile as you're going through inside you gonna be brining up ready to say something but this is a battle for seven days [Music] for seven days they couldn't say nothing seven days of silence hallelujah seven days and don't say nothing to nobody I don't shout till I tell you to shout and when they followed that strategy then they had a victory some of y'all need to follow that strategy and you'll get a victory you can actually have your victory in seven days your situation can change and 17 limiters if you follow that strategy not only will your situation change thank you you will change as well what would I be doing perfecting that patients that temperance that colonists early kindness oh we got a journey here I'm loving this already oh my God my God my God but that was the strategy that God used and it took faith to to hold to what God said and do exactly the way he said didn't they saw the walls come down we all we all know about David fighting Goliath what a strategy a rock in a sling with a man that's that's that's a man that's been on the battlefield for all his life pretty much he was raised to do battle right this man was a he's an insult to say this man has been a warrior all his days and you were nothing but a youth say how you gonna go out here with a with a rock and see say look look look when when the lion came against the sheep like can you imagine David out that little ol itty bit of fella a big old lion and big old bear coming and take the sheep and and I think scripture say lion had it in his mouth they say so he - thought now that might that might actually cause David to go look crazy he see blood right you got my daddy's sheep and and he left all the other ones to go after this one he told the lion no you ain't taking it you and you will not have my daddy sheep hallelujah glory I'm coming I said whatever I gotta do and David didn't have no spear David didn't have did he didn't have anything say so what David had was just Rock and he took the rock and he hit the lion with it I don't know where he hid the lion that but wherever he hid him the lion let go to seep then when the lion rose up against David David said he grabbed him by his spirit and he slew the lion adrenaline was flowing this man go up against the lion not most of the lion can have it you know he hungry most us ain't got that like that Amen but but when when you when you kind of sick and tired of the devil taking anything and everything you you set up against yourself against lions and bears and everything else hurry up you say no to the devil he said no the lion could have him bear can have him he say in this uncircumcised Philistine God a god I got to give him to me just like he gave me the lion and the bear it say what's wrong with that type of faith you going out then you face and imagine this ball was 17 years old and the entire nation of Israel was resting on him being able to defeat Goliath even so they said I got confidence in and you know you could see the faith that day that David was exemplifying was contagious the rest of the armor was getting a little man this guy can do something right say so so when David went out there the sorcerer says I'm gonna let you go but not just take my armor just kind of protect yourself David put on the armor way too big for him and then he just before he went running out he threw it all off he said look I ain't tested none of this I fought in no battles with this armor some y'all trying to fight y'all battles with somebody else armor in your war strategy you can use somebody else armor can I tell you what you need to use use what God gave you Hey some of y'all God gave you a song in the missio battle use your song sorry y'all the prayer warriors use your prayer to intercede and get in touch with God huh whatever it is that God gave you use it some y'all are encouragers he meant something better you just got encourage somebody as you encouraged other people you yourself you get encouragement whatever God has given you use what you got come on touch the neighbors say use what you got whatever God's given you use that for his glory he's a war strategies amen and I want to bring it home here with Gideon cuz my god Gideon what was something that it took faith forgetting to do what he did it took faith now as I was reading I could not necessarily find this a man in particular but I did a little search on how big the army was the Midianite army because you know we all know Gideon went to battle here with only 300 men and now the army was stripped down Gideon had 32,000 men for battle but the Midianites had a hundred and thirty-five thousand men I want you to think about this with 32,000 men for the battle the odds were for Midianites to one Israelite that's bad odds I'm one man I gotta go against full huh that seemed pretty bad oh my but God tell Gideon Gideon first thing in the morning the ones that are scaredy-cats ask him if they're scared say whoever scared let them go on amen back to the house and getting it makes this grand announcement and you're lucky this man say now any y'all boys afraid that going this battle with me if you're afraid do you just get your stuff you go and I can see what I'm look and he probably telling its partner we were just talking about this last night God just made a way if you ain't going I'm going back you can stay if you want to say I ain't staying here I'm going and I can see one pick up his stuff in his suitcase and eat sorry for us I'm done before you know it another would follow in another twenty two thousand twenty two thousand scaredy-cats he only had 30 mm nah he's down to ten thousand me the odds were four to one with 20 to 30 mm now I got ten thousand the odds just with thirteen point five to one I got to take out thirteen and a Half Men because my brothers were scared and you know what God told Givens they say you're the numbers you're 32,000 you're 32,000 if y'all win the battle y'all gonna think y'all did this and y'all on strip even though the odds were against them they still would have thought they did in the old strip seven y'all in some battles where y'all thinking y'all doing this on your own this battle is not yours it's God's and God gotta get you to a place where you realize that he alone deserves glory so i'ma tell you in the process of getting you to the place where he alone deserves glory he has to strip you down can I tell you something if you are in a process right now in your life where you feel like your resources are being stripped from you anybody feel that way get ready for a miracle I heard her brother preach this a few weeks ago just preaching about getting I said oh yeah that's me I got it I gotta take that brother get ready for a miracle if you go through I mean I had 32,000 now I'm down the 10,000 and ain't it it's going to be another pull God tell Gideon say now your numbers are still too high for me huh y'all still don't think y'all did this in y'all ultra with ten thousand against 135 thousand so gotta strip things down to get rid of that pride gosh I'll tell you what I need you to do is call them in down to the water and all I'm gonna get gonna drink this water thirsty they're gonna drink this water but if something I'm gonna approach it one way and another is gonna approach it a different way it said now as they approach to these two different ways I want you to kind of separate them the ones that kind of you know get it like like dogs not now understand they want a dog where the dog is drinking water even even my cat do this when they drink they always watching where they drinking right so this one just you know they when they got they get the water cup it and and and and drink it why the eyes are still on the enemy the other ones just fall prostrate on their face drinking water just facing and you can see some of the hairs just baptized in the water he said get them fellows put them to the side and 9700 over here 300 over there and God to Gideon send the 9700 you tabata gods whose ways are higher than our ways and whose thoughts are higher than our thoughts you you you you you got to know who my God is say say now just takes in the 9700 home and give me 300 now look the odds with a 300 man army going against 135,000 meant that it would be 450 men to 1 y'all Satan but the Bible says one of you shall chase wanna chase a thousand and two of it ten thousand to a flight Oh God needed some warriors that I show up in the battle and he'll take care of the rest of it and when Gideon went down there where there's 300 God took the army out now I need you I need you just I need to just give you something here I was just a little note that was in my BOB I was just blessed by this Gideon strange battle strategy that's what they say Gideon strange battle strategy Carol it on the elements of surprise the elements of confusion the elements of the enemy's mistaken assumption amen when deadwood god can catch the devil off surprise oh my y'all know y'all got y'all y'all know many out on big cut off a surprise here you're going through and then you know everything that's so good just all of a sudden some just happen maybe a car something where that light come from how did that like come on I just had this thing service right and here you know this happened and then you get that fixed flat tire then you go home and it's hot AC not working huh hallelujah you such a problem after problem after problem and you had this night spits big cushion in the bank huh but then it start getting depleted because of all the problems Oh somebody but in the midst of your batter you keep holding on because gotta put it back and the way that God puts things back can I tell you how he do it for you that's the goal that you serve so be patient in your trial so temperance in your trial I don't care about what the devil's bringing to you just keep demonstrating the love of God double-double he liked to do that he liked to do that he liked to do that it says the Gideon strange battle strategy on the elements are surprised and I love when God like to surprise the devil he thought he had me boy boy God gotta throw a surprise on him it meant confusion y'all want to know how y'all confuse the devil by walk in here and praising God even though you're going through it you know what I'm gonna let me put it this way if I ain't got nothing else but a priest that's what i'ma give God the devil may take this the devil may take that but one thing you can take is my priests coming here I got the heart I got the loudest hallelujah man brother Jack Muscat victory no I'm going through but I'm praising God for the victory y'all gotta learn how to learn how to worship before you break through you worship it based on what you see in your binoculars you already see that thing over now come on somebody and brother brother when Scott used to tell us say don't you know we don't tell us going through we smell the smoke don't tell us that we see it all over you no no you don't ever want people to make it seem like good you think they start feeling sorry for you don't feel sorry for me feel sorry but if you want you can feel sorry for the devil if you want to but I don't even feel sorry for him hey man glory to God Gideon strange battle strategy counted all counted on the elements of surprise confusion and I love this - enemies mistaken assumption you know the devil can make some mistakes - he always talking to you about mistakes but he can he can have the wrong assumption it was a mistaken assumption and this is the the Midianites the Mennonites had a mistaken assumption that they had fallen prey to an innumerable attacking force God gave the man a dream and he saw Gideon just coming into the cabinet he tell him and dream in the man and other man need to talk to game interpretation that's the Swart of Gideon and they had an assumption that Gideon had this great army and then realized Gideon had 300 men and we're getting this divided or 300 men of it's a chess follow me say now we're gonna make a lot of noise right we're gonna be banging pitches and carrying lights what kind of strategy is this the pictures come on get up out of here 300 men just making a little noise banging on pitches and carrying carrying light lights lamps lights the sward of God and the sword of Gideon he put God first now that's why he said it the Swart of God and of Gideon because this was not Gideon's battle this was God's battle he just needed Gideon show up oh I love God I love God let me just read a quote here to try to finish this off this is coming from if God be with us then where's all this miracles and I'll just go right to paragraph 117 Oh actually no I got to read this state stay right there that that's 55 just stay with me here now I'll close out we read the scripture here we're Gideon scared out by the winepress threshing out enough wheat before the Phylis times that of Midianites found him him and his daddy out there getting a little grub for their winners food thrashing it out secretly so they couldn't find them because they just come in like grasshoppers and took all they had look at this that's the way the devil does we get a little church started everything going fine yeah I'm gonna tell you something I just read this same quote a few weeks ago in Bible study and I'm bringing it back around cuz I read it before now I'm reading it after all right amen I read it before I left to go to Zimbabwe not reading it after and look at what the prophecy that's the way the devil does we get a little church started everything going fine how many preachers don't know this to be the truth since just about the time everything's going along fine some of them pasta will come right amongst that group and tear it to pieces that imposters the devil will come right amongst that group and tear it to pieces that's right snatch the church right from a man if he can do it and I love the part that says that mean he can do that now you gonna try can I just be out of the job he gonna try to just disrupt all kind of stuff this is why I say you need a war strategy what some is gonna be faith and like I just using in a Joshua's situation it was actually just don't see nothing that was a strategy they overcame with not saying nothing some of y'all gonna have to leave here and don't say nothing halleluyah came out seven days nothing burning up you just old imposter come right amongst that group and tear to pieces that's right snatch the church right for many if he can do it see that's the devil come in like grasshoppers and take out what's been given says Gideon certainly certainly was a scripture man when the angel Lord said to him and if you notice it wasn't the angel of the Lord here it said and the Lord capital L Ord it was not an angel it was God it was a theophany in a man in the form of God like appeared to Abraham back in the wilderness and and look like a man so therefore being a messenger he was the angel of the Lord and he appeared to him and he said thou mighty man of Valor and he's going to make him and deliver Israel by him I'm skipping down to paragraph 117 in that same message and he says this it says now Gideon and those people there before they could see or can ever go see these miracles of God there was a condition that had to be met unlike that a man before they could see a man or ever go see the miracles of God there was a condition that had to be met to meet to see the power of miracles they had to believe to see the power of miracles they had to believe that sustained condition that we have to meet today if we want to see the power of miracles then we have to believe they also had to believe and obey the prophets word glory to God if they want to see miracles they had to believe because getting actually if the Lord is with us then we're all his miracles well God showed him a miracle amen when he stripped down his army two times and sent him out there were 300 men God showed him a miracle right he says but but to meet to see the power of miracles they had to believe they also had to believe and obey the prophets word see the miracles of God now remember before that they could see the miracles they had to obey what the Prophet sent and before we can see the miracles of God we've got to obey what the prophets said the Bible is the Prophet to us that's right thank God war strategies just trying to anoint your faith today amen same way Gideon went out there by faith you can approach whatever it is that you got by faith same way David went out by faith you can approach whatever it is you got by faith your Goliath will go down by faith amen Joshua and the children of Israel when they went to Jericho they walk by faith around them walls they came down each one no strategist God brought a victory and we approach God this morning with the same type of faith I guarantee you have a victory in your situation amen let's pray father how grateful we are for your word I would thank you Lord Jesus for the ability father just go back and look at these things in Scripture but Oh God our hearts are encouraged because in the midst of what we see in these stories we also see a deeper picture and that is that you are trying to bring us into the image to the stature of a perfect man God you want to display yourself in us and all God how we have to fight and wrestle with the enemy we see his his hand we see him and how he moves Lord but we also see you moving in our myths thank you for encouraging us thank you for helping us Lord and in God we don't want to be like the Buzzard trying to stick feathers in it and call ourselves Christians but God we really want this to be an inside job that every virtue will be birth in us and it be manifested Lord that that is our very purpose Lord this is what your your prophet said god this is this is why we're here this is why we come to church Oh God so that we might come to this place that you have called us to as Christians who add to our faith virtue we have the foundation of faith but we got to add and we're determined Lord she gives us to add we're determined to be all that you have called us to be Jesus we surrender our thoughts we surrender our ideas we surrender our life to you God we follow you Jesus wherever you lead God we go home pray in Jesus name amen amen the Lord bless you Church let's give the Lord a hand of praise and I'll turn the service
