a friend by the name of josh taylor he's going through depression and uh just uh suicidal thoughts he says i pray that god will give him hope to keep going on so let's pray for josh taylor even at this time he's not here but we'll send the word of god to where he is amen and pray over him let's pray father we come before your presence lord josh has been brought before the throne of god uh lord it touched the heart of brother nehemiah and if it touched the heart of brother nehemiah that he put in this request we know it also touches your heart so father we're sending the word to josh taylor and we're rebuking this enemy of suicide and depression lord that is coming against him satan we command you loose the mind of josh taylor hallelujah lose his thoughts and god may he begin to think on things that are just and things that are pure things that are lovely and things that of good rapport the bible says if there be any virtue if there be any praise then we should think on these things so father we send the word even right now to where josh taylor is and may you give him victory over this situation may he have an opportunity amen to talk with brother nehemiah and begin to share how things begin to change and may brother nehemiah also share how we prayed for them oh god and lord and how things change after prayer lord if he does not know you in the partner sin may he come to know

musicians thank you all so much i certainly appreciate you all and uh we will uh just turn a man to scripture here this morning and um uh we'll get into the word of the lord oh my my mind i just accident if you if you can stand amen please stand for the reading of the word uh when um when we're going to the court uh the the judge walks into the courtroom and they usually make a statement all rise all rise we got something greater than any judge in the land we got the word of god and so we all rise amen for the word of god acts chapter 1 verse 2 through 8 is what i want to read and then also from zechariah 4 and 6 we will take a thought today amen uh our title is the seed word is energized by the spirit amen the seed word is energized by the spirit amen uh here in acts chapter 1 verse 2 it says until the day in which he was taken up after that he uh after that he through the holy ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen to whom also he showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs being seen of them 40 days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of god and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father which saith he ye have heard of me for john truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence amen uh when they therefore were come together they acts of him saying lord without at this time restore again the kingdom of the kingdom to israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father that which the father hath put in his own power but ye shall receive power amen after that the holy ghost has come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and in all judea and and in samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth amen also uh i want to read from zachariah um four and six hallelujah scripture says then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the lord unto zerubbabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts amen the lord had a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated amen in the presence of the lord uh as i mentioned we want to take our title today of the c word is energized by the spirit amen the c word is energized by the spirit amen so uh just want to start us off here with a quote out of it it is the rising of the sun praise the lord uh the prophet um is just dealing with a particular uh statement here that we're gonna kind of try to use to draw a little inspiration um and just so you know i'm still in the channel of stepping to the vision and um you know we're still in that channel we're still pulling from that there's a quote that i read last week and and i'm reading the exact same quote again but bringing it from a different angle uh but uh let's um let's um uh just start with this you say well now wait a minute brother branham i know a church that well i do too see it says but now for instance if we're going to go back to tucson this afternoon now and each one of us was going to go in a big cadillac brand new and all of the seats were made out of dole skin softness of the leather uh soft and easy to sit in and the floor floorboards were plush the steering wheel were nickel nickel plated and had diamond studs all over it and the engine was mechanically tested to be exactly the right engine and the wheels uh all had bearings and greased up and the tires were all puncture proof and blew out free and all been tested scientifically they have been pushed off the assembly line both of them and both of them filled up with gasoline uh that's the running power glory the gasoline is the running power he says that's the running power the gasoline because it uh because in it is a octane but now when you're going to start them although both of them look just alike but there's one of them don't have any spark hallelujah glory any firing power amen they can look alike but one amen if it doesn't have spark or firing power amen the car you the car will do you no good praise the lord who want to who want to buy car and just sit in a driveway trying to look good hey man you buy the car so you can go around town a little bit amen and and show people how the lord bless you come on somebody amen you have a purpose for having the car not just to sit in your driveway and look good come on somebody hey man he said so he said so but there's one of them don't have any spark any fire power when you say the power is in the gasoline brother branham but i don't care how much power is in the gasoline unless there's a spark there to manifest that power unless there's a power there to confirm that it's gasoline it just might as well be water hallelujah glory to god let's i'm going to keep reading here because he's going to drop draw us to a little point says no matter how much theologians claim how well you got your church set how much education you got how much like the bible until that wave sheath until the holy spirit comes upon that person to quit him that word look at this he says that gasoline represents the word it's the truth but without the spirit hallelujah oh my god without the spirit it won't move so brother we're not here just trying to bring you quote after quote in scripture after scripture we want to see the spirit of god come and strike the word of god hallelujah amen he says we have put too much stress on the mechanics amen and nothing on the dynamics it needs the dynamic power of god the resurrection power of jesus christ upon the church to manifest and to bring to pass that this is gasoline so this morning i want to i want to stress some dynamics if we can amen he's saying we put too much stress on the mechanics but he said we need to we need he says it's not enough on the dynamic power so we want to stress some dynamics if we can just stay with me here glory to god it says it might be in a gasoline cam could still be water see but the only proof of it is put this life on it and it'll prove whether it's gasoline or not all right so i i i'm starting us off here and we're talking about the seed word is energized by the spirit amen and you know we got to understand some things about the uh you know the c word glory let me uh just kind of skip around here i was just um reading there in uh in the book of mark amen also in the book of luke this peril is told amen about how a sower goes out and sow seed amen uh that soul comes out and and he's just sprinkling seeds on the ground now you gotta understand when it's in seat form it's not in full manifestation praise the lord amen in order for it to get to full manifestation you got to wait amen you have to go through a process of waiting you got to go through a process of getting your ground prepared you got to go through a process of watering that seed hallelujah and i want to tell you something the way that you water the seed of god the way that you water amen the word of god is with your amens glory hallelujah as the word of god comes to you say amen to the word of god amen respond to god if you want god to respond to you can i say that again i say respond to god if you want god to respond to you hallelujah brother when when uh uh blind bartimaeus amen he needed a response he didn't he didn't know that that was going to be the last time jesus was passing that way but brother when he heard my god when he heard that jesus was passing he said what's the commotion about what's all the noise about why is everybody around city doing he said jesus is in town and they knew wherever jesus went there was gonna be something happening so blind by the man said now i'm not gonna let this opportunity pass me by that's the way you gotta come to church i'm not gonna let this service pass me by i don't know what the preacher gonna preach but i'm not gonna let god pass me back i'm coming here to get something from god hallelujah now with this great crowd amen there are surrounding jesus and blind bottom has heard that it was jesus passing by he had to do something in order to get a response from jesus blind buttermilk had to do something and blind by the mans begin to say jesus hallelujah the son of david don't pass me by and one of his one of his friends came up saying now you know he can't hear you you might as well stop calling amen on jesus the the the crowd is too big for him to hear you he said you don't think you can hear me jesus and as you begin to cry louder and louder now you need to understand it wasn't that jesus heard his voice jesus heard his faith and the lord wants to hear your faith praise god don't confess your problem confess your faith yes amen as as blind bottom as begin to do something he got a response from god and i want to encourage you just amen say amen to the word respond to the word of god you'll get the response that you're looking for from god this jesus told the parable of these uh the sower that went out amen to sow seed and as i said when seed is being sown you don't uh you don't see the manifestation of what you sowed immediately you don't see that even even when you saw a seed of maybe giving an offering amen some of us give and we expect to go right to the mailbox and get something no no god want to test your faith you don't wrote a check you're going to call at the church and say uh don't cast that check god testing your faith huh glory to god we got faith inside the church but when we get out no god want to test right what your faith is like outside are you gonna hold to your confession praise god no matter how you feel are you going to hold to your confession glory to god so so so so when this when the soul went forth to sow seeds and the scripture plainly tells us that the seed was the word of god amen as the soul was sowing seed the seed itself was the word of god that was being sown now uh the problem is jesus gave us a man these four different atmospheres that the word of god could fall in hallelujah one of them was called the wayside hallelujah amen he says and people that are operating in a wayside atmosphere are people that hear the word oh glory but immediately after they leave church satan comes and takes what they heard away from them now that's that that's that's something when the devil can just walk up to you and take whatever you got you in bad shape because the devil's supposed to be under your feet right amen the devil ain't gonna take nothing that god gave me let me announce it again i ain't gonna let the devil take nothing that god gave me if he gave me help i'm keeping my health if he gave me children i'm keeping my children if he gave me money i'm keeping my money i ain't gonna let the devil take nothing [Applause] glory to god i'm not a wayside believer i'm a real believer hallelujah somebody amen wayside believers they hear the word but satan takes it from them immediately then you got rocker stony crown believers amen and these are believers that say amen to the words they got a big smile on their face as the word is coming forth man they responded with everything they got if you don't watch them they'll be running around the church in no time hallelujah glory to god but because the word is not rooted amen amen these are rocker stoney type believers because the word is not rooted they felt the presence of god they heard the voice of god but because the word is not rooted what happens to them they are offended with amen when when persecution and affliction arises they get offended because the word was on rocky or stony ground i want to just talk about this just for a little bit before i give you these other two groups you know um when you plant these seeds hey man you you have to you have to wait and for for things to to become what you envision for it to be you know and uh while you wait and other things happen you know recently we went through a little uh change of landscape amen uh they're in our front yard and you know we had a certain way that we wanted things to be and you know we got somebody to come in and and say take this out and plant this in and man this is what we want this is what we're looking for we and we realize we gotta buy it in various uh the smaller portions of it and let it grow into what we want it to be and it might take it might take a little time that's okay we're willing to wait but what i found is that uh there are other things that get planted that i didn't plant weeds just come out of nowhere i mean i didn't put that there how did the weed get there come on somebody y'all work with me today i didn't plant that i didn't buy weeds i understand i didn't go spend my money on weeds but somehow we got next to what i planted and what i found about weeds is that if you're not careful they will take over what you actually planted the weed is starting some way off distance place and then it just starts weaving its way right next to the thing that you planted come on somebody and you got to go rip it out brother josue you gotta get it at the root pull that thing out but when it's next to the thing that you planted you got to be careful because you might destroy the thing that you planted as well [Applause] but nonetheless you got to get the weeds out i believe the holy ghost is here to get the weeds out the church we could be planting the word seed but every once in a while a reader come in there the holy ghost will take care of that wheat amen we're gonna keep what we planted god gonna keep what he planted but he gonna get rid of your weeds can i tell you something weeds are there to destroy the sea but god ain't gonna let no weed take care take take over his seeds all right so we got wayside believers we got rock of stony ground believers amen then we also got these beliefs we call thorns glory to gods amen these thorns according to the scripture they hear the words amen they rejoice in the words hallelujah but by what the bible tells us in luke i mean it's our mark 4 19 amen the bible gives us some something here says uh they hear the word but the cares of this world can you pull up that mark 4 19. i want you to just see this glory to god what what happens to this thorny group watch this now and the cares of this world and look at this and the deceitfulness see i see as a believer we talked about this last week it's impossible for me to be deceived but there's authority group hallelujah they rejoice when the word comes forth they also run around the church they slob and they cry and can i preach to y'all this morning they jump they shout man they they do all kinds of things but but the cares of this world and notice this the deceitfulness of riches [Applause] you got to watch that now you gotta i mean try you we can preach a sermon from these three things cares of this world deceitfulness of riches lust of other things that's a sermon by itself deceitfulness of riches the devil will always have you chasing after money you will compromise your position on sunday in order to get some more money the deceitfulness of riches as soon as you compromise your position to go get that extra job to go get that extra money amen something's gonna happen when your car gonna break down you're gonna need stuff inside your house all everything broke down so the money that you thought you got just got spit just like that because you compromised for the deceitfulness of riches i'm talking about thorny people you you think thorny people a little sticky you can't get around them no you can get around them but it's their actions that help you realize what they are first the cares of this world you start making decisions based on the cares of this world not based on what the word of god says but because of the cares of this world the deceitfulness of riches and then if if you ain't if you ain't uh if you maybe you got those two under your belt but then the bible say and the lust of other things can i ask you a question this morning what's your lusting after [Music] i can go back to that song brother stop saying ah i'm desperate for you i'm lusting for you jesus right i'm longing for you jesus uh and i i might as well just tell you i'm i'm a witness of this amen you ain't gonna get what you want to get until you actually give god your oh i'ma say it again you ain't gonna get what you want to get until you give god your all i'm a living witness all right so you got goals that you set and it's okay to be ambitious but keep god in the middle of your ambition right amen that's it brother seek first the kingdom of god and all of his righteousness everything else will be added to you not now you know how you know what the devil don't told some of y'all when you serve god things are going to get subtracted how many have heard that lie if i give god this this gonna get taken away and that's gonna get taken away no no the bible said if you seek first the kingdom of god and all is righteousness amen everything else will be added not subtracted we serve a god that does not subtract or divide but our god will add and multiply glory amen hallelujah amen so we understand this group amen this thornton group that cares in this world the deceitfulness of riches and the lusts of other things enter in choke the world the word took the word choke the word and it becometh unfruitful now could let me go to luke 8 15 because this is the group that i'm calling y'all all a part of y'all good ground believers amen hey man i'm talking i'm talking to some good ground believers because the word of god is falling on it's in four different atmospheres but this is the good ground atmosphere and now now these amen they hear the word as well and and what happens to them says that uh but that on the good ground are they which in an honest and good heart so if y'all first your heart got to be honest and good glory amen and an honest and good heart amen having heard the word so these people here promise you know what they do with it they keep it i'm talking about when the devil coming against you and everything he got what do you do with the word of god amen you keep confessing the same thing god promised me this you're not looking at your bank account you're looking at your promise you're not looking at your body you're looking at your promise you're not looking at the doctor's report you're looking at your promise praise god you're not looking how hard the situation is you're looking at god's promise [Applause] after i hear the word i'm gonna keep it and then there's another thing you have to do you have to bring for fruit it's not going to happen overnight but i can tell you this much it will happen hallelujah amen only the devil trying to sell us get rich quick schemes amen don't buy one of those schemes from the devil that that's that's that's a that's a trick of the enemy to get you out of the will of god bring forth fruit with patience good ground people are able to bring forth fruit with patience all right let me go back now i just had to drop those things in there so now let's go forward this is something we read last week actually i didn't i didn't uh i didn't read it out of uh i'm gonna read programming in church h but uh i read it from smoking words original seed part two but i want to read it from pergaming church agent we'll pick up this and just try to go forward just a little bit more oh god help us amen uh this this is out of the the vision where the angel told the prophet pick up your pen and write he said now this message that we're writing amen it's for uh the the this this is for the church or for the bribe this is for the bride this was a future word that was coming for us amen god's prophet picked up his pen in the 60s and wrote this and here it is it's us we're manifesting this we're living some of y'all might not realize that you have stepped into a vision glory the same vision that that the angel gave the prophet you don't realize by you stepping into spirit and truth tabernacle you have stepped into a vision can i just just just just back up just a little bit on last sunday i shared with y'all a man a dream amen a dream correctly interpreted is it's a vision amen hallelujah please try to just stay with me here i know we we're talking spiritual things here glory to god but but but a dream correctly interpreted is a vision and in the dream i told you all how brother carlos amen all the way in in honduras is that right amen in honduras amen has this dream about our church and brother carlos was here back in january god god sent him here right amen just for a few weeks and and uh and brother carlos was here and and uh and uh he was you know he we didn't know he was a singer but once we found out man we let him sing let him do whatever he do brother brother josue have to interpret for him but hear the man don't really even speak english as a first language amen but but here he goes back home to honduras and god gives him a dream and says in a dream i saw myself amen picking up a guitar and they gave me the guitar and told me to play the song but i couldn't catch the rhythm it says i couldn't catch the rhythm i don't i don't know why i couldn't catch the rhythm it says uh it says but then the pastor's mother he didn't know a name he said the pastor's mother went to the piano and start playing after i couldn't catch the rhythm she start playing the piano now you know when i first heard it i'm like uh my mama don't play no piano right but you you can't apply natural thinking to spiritual things we were just waiting so you know brother quaker had shattered with me and and we were just praying over it and and just waiting to see what the lord would do hallelujah and then uh we watched some things unfold and and brother josue told uh a family saying now i don't invite people to my church now y'all thought that was a strange thing that he said but no that was ordained of god for him to say it just like that i don't invite people to my church now now now and and brother said now why i wonder why he'll invite people to his church he's saying now what if i want to come to your church can i come he say yes if you want to come you can come but i don't invite people to my church now he knew what he was saying because brother jose knew this was a word church if you're not serious about the word you'll leave i just gave you them four groups i'm putting you back in the word now i'm we not playing games we trying to get people ready for rapture if you want to play games in church there's many of them out here that play games but if you want the truth because the bible say ye shall know the truth and the truth will make you free free from your bondage free from your addictions free from anything that the devil might have in your path brother so i say i don't i don't invite people to my church now but if you want to come you're welcome to come well we want to come family showed up and we were just having church and the brothers was preaching was going through this whole uh pandemic and we added the two services and you know and and the family just come and just enjoy and i remember when the brother said i just love it when the brother talked about we got these nuggets brother troy used terms like that we got nuggets here university i just like them nuggets i'm i'm trying to bring it all together for y'all he said i love i love them terms i love that i love that i said just i never heard things like that we got these nuggets that we polishing up and we give them it's just revelation from the word of god that's what we're talking about when we say nuggets hallelujah so you know we're going on we're going on and and and just because we the way that we were doing the services the services that they would come i would never be preaching never it just worked out and i would try to tell them i'm gonna preach on such and such a day you might want to come that day and i already knew i knew the series that i was in i knew the quotes that were coming i knew that now i had a choice either to bypass the quote right or say what god say if the angel wrote it then i'm going to say what the angel said praise the lord oh hallelujah right so so so uh you know as a family's coming and then i i come and i came with a hard sermon that day i'm telling everybody i'm warning you warning you i will preach what the word of god say i i will not shun to declare the whole council of god now i might not do it every sunday but if you sit here long enough this word gonna find you where you at and we're gonna find out what kind of ground you are now the ones that you see been sitting here for a long time under that type of reaching you know their good ground amen because who the lord loves he chases and he corrects them if you ain't never been corrected by the word of god you can't claim that god loves you all right i i i might not get back to my subject but i'ma go as far as i can i want to show how the c word is energized by the spirits right but i got to get these things so that the church understand where we're at hey man we're not here just kind of going through motions right but god is doing something god has assembled this group here god has done that right amen so so so you know uh that's something i preach and my lord i knew and i i mean i might as well be oh yeah i might as well say i i i i i made a statement i went right back to deuteronomy 22 and 5. if y'all if i i can read it for you i went right back to the bible now i know some people say oh that's old testament well what happened in the garden of eden is also old testament thou shall not kill its old testament thou shall not commit adultery is old testament huh thou shall not you know bear false witness that's old testament there's a lot of things in the old testament that amen even even the promise of uh uh uh he was wounded for my transgressions and bruce when i iniquited chastising my pieces upon him with his stripes i'm here you shall over that but that's old testament [Applause] no weapon formed against me will prosper and every tongue that rides against me thou will be condemned you shout over that but that's old testament [Music] amen i'm the lord that healeth all my diseases you shot over that [Music] amen that's old testament he's gonna walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou ripped me thy rods my staff they comfort me now prepares a table before me in the presence of my enemies surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever you shout over that but that's old testament see what we got here is a problem the problem is some people just want certain parts of the scripture but not all parts of the scripture but here at spirit and truth tabernacle we're going to give you old testament and new testament because it's a double bear shotgun [Applause] we're going to take the devil out with these promises if god wrote it in the old testament it's still applicable today amen jesus did not come to do away with the law he actually magnified it how how how did he do that brother jack because he said you have heard that thou shalt not commit adultery you have heard that means it was written in the old testament you have heard he says but i say i say unto you he that looketh upon a woman and lusteth in his heart has committed adultery already he never even touched her he only looked at her and it was committed it was called adultery in jesus eyes so he didn't do away with the old testament he magnified it that's why the sisters shouldn't dress a certain way that's why we preached uh deuteronomy 22 5 that a woman not supposed to wear garments pertaining to a man and notice the bible say as pertaining to a man woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man if a man would wear it a woman not supposed to wear it amen look at this and neither shall a man put on a woman's garment and y'all know that's coming out news all the time men wearing women's underwear and all kind of nasty filthy things going on all over the world you know it's the truth amen amen hallelujah it still looks strange for me to see a man walking down the street with a skirt on as soon as i see a man with a skirt i know now there's some cultures maybe one or two well they do that but they don't do it all the time maybe at a parade or something they'll do it and that's part of their culture and some people have been able to accept that but you know you don't find others just running out there doing that and i might as well call his name because you know they got this thing say his name right say they name it y'all follow that praise god in the in any how i'ma say his name from a different perspective though and y'all follow this dwayne wade fella [Applause] [Music] dwyane wade trying to support his son now now it's one thing to love your son in the midst of their sin i understand that but you're going way too far he want to walk around with skirts on and stuff like this now too and in support of his son praise the lord i said his name and i'm not saying that ain't nothing on the internet it's right there i mean he walking around with skirts on i think russell westbrook i think might have did it too one time i mean these guys these these basketball uh mega stars that we trying to be like they come out dressed any kind of way a homosexual garment song hallelujah we just be watching them all right the woman shall not wear that which pertains unto a man neither shall a man put it on a woman's garment for all that do so are abomination unto the lord god now also over in the book of revelation it said that those that commit abomination will not inherit the kingdom of god i'm not i'm not i'm not here writing scripture i'm here quoting scripture and i'm here living scripture amen and i set you up real good all them other old testament scriptures that people quote in church but then when it comes to things like that oh that's old testament what you talking you can't you can't hack up the word of god and pick and choose what you want we either take it all uh or none of it and let me tell you that when you take all this work it will become bitter to the belly but you got to keep it down and uh and when i start dressing the way that i'm supposed to the way the word of god tells me to dress when i start dressing that way you know you're going to go through some offenses people are going to come against you people are going to say you don't lost your mind but i just read to you about them four groups man that that that that good ground they're gonna endure it the word gonna be tried they're gonna keep it they're gonna keep it and they're gonna bring forth fruit and patience all right where was i oh thank you so this this string i had to preach that i read that scripture that that sunday and that's it and i had to preach it that's what was in the vision and so you know here you know i preached it and and and that day it's like oh lord uh you know i didn't know but it was what it was sister came to church with pants on that day i didn't know she was sitting down i didn't know but let me act let me just tell you something just because you come like that don't mean i got to change my message i still got to say what god told me to say right i didn't know i but i do i'm a little older than a lot of people in here i do remember a time that people did not go to church and pants not even for choir rehearsal not even for choir hustle [Music] before they went into the house of god i know churches have let down the bars y'all ain't gonna let me talk in here when i was coming up my grandma church women did not wear pants i'm talking about pentecost did not wear pants and that was the only place you could find them baptists had gave up a long time ago but pentecost no no what happened is that the pentecostal skirts start getting a little shorter shorter the next thing you know they start wearing pants in a pentecostal church prophesying in pants peace speaking in tongues in pants things that the holy ghost used to condemn amen i'm talking about my day nah it's just so accepted but you know and and granted if somebody were to walk in here it's not like i'm gonna just come up here and just go out off on them like that i'm not gonna do that i'm gonna be gracious i will read that scripture at some point in time praise the lord just so you know where we stand when you when you start looking how come none of these sisters wear their pants around here i'm showing you why it's in the bible that's why we don't do it so we did that you know i preached that and and and boy that was that was that was a it was i knew it was rough but you know the good thing about after i preached that because some you know i'm gonna tell you what most people would do after i preach a sermon like that you would not want to talk to me no more you wouldn't want to see me no more i ain't never going back to church anymore but you know what that family did they invited me for dinner after i preached such a hard sermon they invited me to dinner i went straight to the house in the middle of a pandemic to go have dinner and we just begin to share lord god i don't know i'm saying all this and i don't know if i'm supposed to be saying it but i i just this is a part of a vision i even shared the vision with them that night and as as as i shared the vision i said you know this is what happened this is what happened and you know we were just still just fellowshipping and working with them because i still believe god didn't let him come here for nothing so i still pray for that family religiously it's just god gotta open people's eyes flesh and blood can't do it god got to do it so i pray for revelation i pray that you'll run run so ragged trying to find a church that you realize ain't but one place to go amen so we went through that and why was sister birds in the dream playing the piano mrs birds called me up a couple weeks later and said i just had this remarkable conversation with two co-workers of mine we had three hours of conversation i just began to share with them my journey of how i came to the message of the hour walked them through baptists walked them through pentecost walking through how did i get to where i am right now and she began to share with them to say they was on a zoom called zoom cut the call off now sometimes zoom will let you go past your time but this time zoom cut it off they started another zoom call zoom cut that one off they started another one cut that they say we still want to hear let me let us just call you on the telephone got it i threw away going and mama just breaking this down breaking that down breaking this down bro and she just she was just i mean she was elated with just the freedom that god gave her to be able to share the truth and she had prayed that god would give her an open door god gave her that open door and both of these ladies was just receiving the word i mean got into talking about serpent seed on the phone one of the sisters she said um she said um uh you know that serpent sees like you know and and and for y'all that don't know i'm just i'm have to i'm give you the fast version the fast version eve did not eat an apple eve did not eat an apricot eve did not eat a natural fruit to get pregnant eve committed adultery now there was only two humans in the garden so who who could she commit adultery with adam and eve was only two humans who could eve commit adultery with it's very easy it's in the bible because god came down saying now who told y'all y'all was naked now now why would they eat a fruit come on y'all just y'all i'm all over it if they would eat a fruit and they found out there was naked the bible say that when they when they covered their nakeds they covet the midsection not their mouth so that if you cover your midsection something unhappened down there y'all ain't gonna talk to me yet [Music] and when god began to give out the punishments he said adam what happened because adam didn't show up to church one day everybody knows something wrong when you ain't coming to church no matter how much you shout everybody knows something wrong when you don't come to church come on somebody right so so so so god god said adam adam what happened here say this woman you gave me i ain't asked for her you gave it to me she brought this thing to me brought me you know this is it's her fault then god looked at eve say what happened say the serpent beguiled me i said it was only two humans adam and eve well what was this serpent then because we found out something in scripture go back and read your bible i'ma say it again if churches can't get genesis right they ain't gonna get nothing else right but what happened in the bible this serpent was cursed now before the curse how did he stand because after the curse he went on his belly but before the curse he stood on two feet now don't get don't get don't get don't let that bother you like that don't let that bother you you got to understand what a prophet's job is how many got a bible in here how many got a bible how many got a bible you got a bible the first five books of your bible was written by who how did moses know what happened in the garden of eden he went there because god showed him as a prophet what happened in the garden of eden you believe moses now you know moses actually did not write he just told us that the serpent got cursed but he didn't tell us that he stood on two feet it took another prophet a prophet that's supposed to restore all things according to what jesus said that prophet tells you what happened in the garden of eden just like moses said it it says he stood on two feet and they got cursed and put on his belly now i went through church for years trying to figure out what happened in the garden and when i heard a prophet say that something on the inside struck i'm like glory to god i need you to know something the word was already in you before you even heard this the reason that you could say a man to it is because it was already inside of you you had questions that never got answered you done been to so many bible studies ain't nobody never said nothing like this but when you heard truth you connected with that but now you need the spirit to come and quicken what was on the inside of you and the seed words will be energized by the spirit [Music] sister birds told that that dream and next thing you know i'd say i say invite both of those co-workers to church she invited them one that said i watch online the other say i i'm coming to church and who walked in spanish family why did god use a spanish brother in honduras to have this dream because god was trying to tell us something see what i'm going to tell you this and i said this before this is not a i'm going to use a term like this this is not a ethnic church i'ma go a little further this is not a black church this is a christian church [Music] and we've all no matter what our origin i mean our uh uh culture or ethnicity is we got a greater ethnicity than what they have defined us as it's greater than skin color this goes back to us being in the mind of god and coming as thoughts of god to fellowship in this place so here you'll see everything i'm telling you're going to see it all because that's what we are yeah and and we will not allow anybody to make somebody else feel less and when we have we have a big eat we eat praise the lord your culture you know we don't eat no no no no no not here not here we eat praise the lord glory glory glory i eat rice and beans i eat collard greens praise the lord amen i eat vegan but i'll eat well i just like putting the devil on the run i hate him i hate him i i i don't want nobody to leave here thinking it's a black church no it's not it's a christian church amen hallelujah so we saw that these things all they were doing just stepping into a vision and here we are we find ourselves kind of stepping into this vision i i want to um i had some other things here to say let me just read this quote because this seed word is energized by the spirit pyramid church age is where i'm at and let me just see if i can try to find a way to get get us home now i'ma just what i try to do is preach about an hour and 15 minutes that's that's really what i try to do i set a timer for myself now most churches you can go to and get a get a message in about 20 minutes and they'll be gone that's good that's what i call fast food service and sometimes i eat fast food sometimes but it ain't good for me we're not here trying to get people in and out as fast as they can we're trying to get people closer to god i'm not going to try to keep you here all day amen and i'm not going to try to make nothing happen either just let god come and do what he want to do so let me just give it just give me a few more minutes just to make a you know look according to my my clock i got 26 more minutes all right praise the lord and that's only if i started on time if i started late then praise the lord forgive me fr per game church age is where i want to read from i read this last week now um we got to understand that uh there is a false church and a true church they're both growing at the same time amen this is why let me take that down just for a second uh from the days of uh cain and abel worship has been involved praise the lord where satan has been involved in the midst of it i read last week how he came down out of heaven and he wanted to exalt himself of other stars of god right but but satan has been involved from the days of of cain and abel kane was of that wicked one that's what the bible said cain was not adam's son but cain was eve's son so let me finish that thought because maybe that's why the lord brought it back eve had a relationship with the serpent because the serpent stood on two feet like a man before his curse that's what a prophet shared with us the serpent stood on two feet like a man before he got cursed and put on his belly so the serpent could actually have relations with a serpent and bring forth a serpent or the serpent could have relations with a human and bring something something mixed up it won't be full human it'll be half human half animal that's what cain was hallelujah that's what kane was he was half human half animal and i and i i got another thing to share with you too here in that condition he was a twin he was a twin amen because eve actually got pregnant by the serpent and by adam at the same time and brought forth twins one named kane one named abel and eve when she got her name notice what the bible says i think it's genesis 4 15 it says eve was the mother of all living but it did not say adam was the father of all living you got to watch this bible you had to watch this bible pray everything means something in the scripture right but eve been the mother of all living right and when you look at that adam knew his wife and the second time adam knew his wife was when when they brought forth seth so there was twins that were born hallelujah but here god gives them some instruction and and you know and they wanted to worship god so cain goes and gets all the fruit of the ground and all this stuff he's like man i'm going i'm going to worship god in this beautiful place i'm sent me a little alt up and and and i'm gonna give god my best he actually thought it was his best able to say you know what i'm gonna give myself a lamb and i'm gonna slay that thing and and i'm gonna take the blood and take it up there to god and see if god gonna take this and he brings his lamb i mean first cain come up with all this beautiful stuff and god gosh that's not what i'm calling for and then here come abel with his lamb and all this blood all over the altar just looked like a mess cain looked and said why would you do something like this son why would you do this to to i mean in the presence of god and god said this is exactly what i was looking for this bloody mess and then he told cain and say if you give me the same thing your brother just gave me i will accept it but rather than cain give god what he asked for cain decided i'm gonna kill my brother where you think murder came from his daddy hallelujah so we see these things in scripture and we have to just you know we gotta understand that they're at those two altars these two spirits there was a false church represented there was a true church represented there was something god was accepting and there was something god was rejecting all the way down to today there's there's a worship that god is accepting and there's a worship that god's rejecting and i can tell you the one that he's accepting i can tell you what he's looking for i can tell you what he's seeking amen the hour cometh and now is when true worshipers the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and truth for the father seeketh such to worship him when i go to rapture and faith tabernacle i'm worshiping in spirit and truth when i go to miami believers i'm worshiping in spirit and in truth when i go to bride of christ tabernacle i'm worshiping in spirit and in truth when i go to eagle's temple i am worshiping in spirit and in truth when i go to bible truth tabernacle i am worshiping in spirit and in truth when i go to victory tabernacle i am worshiping in spirit and in truth when i go to fellowship with the saints in sarasota i'm worshiping in spirit and in truth and when i come to spirit and truth tabernacle [Applause] i am worshiping in spirit and in truth so this quote says in programming church age how can you tell the spirit's part because there's two there's a false and a real false and a real but how can you tell the spirit's part the prophet gives us the answer he says just give them the word test that's how you know where they are if they can't take the word then you already know something wrong with them i'm talking about genesis and revelation they got to be able to take the word says just give them the word test if they don't speak that word they are of the evil one as the evil one deceived the first two bribes as that was adam's bride was deceived jehovah's bride which was israel was deceived they got off the word when they desire a king rather than be led by a prophet oh y'all don't get i hope y'all get it rather than be led by a prophet they want to be led by a king and guess what today people want to be led by a bishop rather than a prophet can i go a little further just pull that down for me just for a second people want to be led by bishop rather than a prophet the bible says that the bishop must be husband the bible says the bishop must be husband of one wife now i got i must say a couple things here so if we have a bishop that's been married multiple times and his wife has not died according to the bible he cannot be bishop can i say something else there is no woman according to the bible can be bishop why because the bible said that the bishop must be husband to one wife can i go further if we have a woman in the pool pit calling herself bishop who is she married to because if she's a woman and she got a wife if she's a woman and she got a wife we got a a real problem we got spiritual homosexuality taking place in the church now i'm gonna tell you when you got spiritual homosexuality in a church you can't get rid of natural homosexuality that's why the homosexual spirit has taken over the church because they got spiritual homosexuality taking place you come here and you see all these brothers in place that's the way the bible had it go back to the old testament was there ever a woman priestess in the priesthood find one woman priest maybe a prophetess there's nothing wrong with a woman prophesying but not preaching oh i told y'all y'all i'm say these things sometime when i come amen i'm just trying to get us back to the word of god and i'm gonna tell you this and as i as i as i sow these seeds we find out what ground people got i'm trying to read this quote i got 16 minutes y'all know i got to cut off here soon thank you brother joseph glory hallelujah how can you tell the spirits apart just give them the word test i just gave you the word i gave you the word that was a word test right there what i just gave you right to see how you respond to the word amen just give them the word test if they don't speak that word they are of the evil one as the evil one to see the first two brides he will try to deceive the bride of this last day by trying to get her to hybridize herself through creeds now this is what the angel spoke to the prophet that this was gonna happen amen says uh trying to hybridize herself through chris or just plainly turning from the word oh my people don't even use the bible anymore to justify what they're doing i felt you felt what you know the devil can give you a feeling right you you know you know you know when mo i'm talking moses a prophet did when he felt he missed the promised land god said god said go out there and speak to that rock moses oh you they want water they want water boom hit the rock no water he got mad boom water came out the rock well he was okay i showed him i got water god said okay come see me moses we need to have a conference we need to have a talk moses i need to talk to what is it we saw water come out to rock you saw people heal you saw this you saw signs of wonder you saw that but i told you to do it a specific way and because you didn't do it my way see this ain't burger king this ain't burgundy we're dealing with this gospel we talk about burger king amen you can't have it your way you have to do this god's way amen so so god said god said no no say moses i need to speak to you say okay you will not be going into this promised land that i told you is going to take the people too the reason you're not because you exalted yourself above my word even a prophet can't do that says i'ma let you go see the land but you ain't going over into it climb up in this mountain look over here look over there you can see exactly what i told them they're gonna have and they come into it but you not not and god didn't even would not even accept sorry don't get yourself in that position where god won't even accept your sorry i'm going on as he wanted to see the first two brides he would try to see the bride the last day by trying to get her to hypertize her self-decrees are just plainly turning from the word to any sign that suits her but god never plays signs ahead of the word signs follow the word i was just i was thinking on this quote when sister tina came up here and said how the devil's been attacking her said see seing followed the word she was obedient she was obedient to what the spirit of god was telling her to get up here and sing and and and through obedience god blesses i mean i'm expecting for that thing to be dissolved before the doctors even see it i got a quote that i want to read before i leave here today but uh but look he said he say this uh it says um a science follower as when elijah told a woman to bake a cake for him first according to the word of the lord when she did as the word said the proper sign came right come to the word first and then watch the miracle and look notice this statement the c word is energized by the spirit now i want to just kind of i'm have to cut my sermon here there's a different way that i i had planned to go but god said otherwise what does energize me energize means to enliven to liven up to animate to vitalize invigorate perk up excite electrify stimulate stir up fire up rouse motivate so so when brother caleb is out there talbot let's get motivated he's actually bringing energy he uses various things to try to get you a man some energy hallelujah see when your phone is about to die you got to get it plugged into a source in order to get some energy in order to get recharged hallelujah your phone is mechanic but when you plug into the source you getting dynamics come on somebody we put too much emphasis or stress on the mechanics but we need dynamics we need to be plugged into the spirit of god we need the anointing flowing through the church again we need the power of god moving again we need dynamics we need lives changed again [Applause] brother i'm not talking about experience from 25 years ago we need a fresh experience today if my phone died yesterday i gotta plug it in tonight if it dies tomorrow i gotta plug it again the next night i gotta keep plugging it in and keep getting a charge and what we need is refilling after refilling after refilling after refilling we cannot be satisfied amen we're just a letter we need the spirit of god moving in the church the the same word got to be energized motivated by the spirit this uh statement here out of being led by the holy spirit and i'm gonna try to bring this to a close if i can this uh statement that the prophet makes it says now one more little thing let's talk about divine healing and i want you to just try to pocket this uh look at this from uh various angles not just divine healing but maybe just in your life just where you at right now spiritually you need to be quicken you you need you need the you need you need the word of god to jumpstart you right you you need you need you need a shot in the arm another definition to be turbocharged come on somebody glory to god you you need to pick me up amen amen you you like samson was as i preached last week samson was all bound and and delilah's lap kept giving away secrets got close and closer till he finally told her the secret of his heart and so if you cut my happy just like any other man and he thought that after he gave it a secret that he was going to rise up amen and just go go at it that i gave you a type that was the same way there was uh uh samson was bound three times amen three times and and that's the way the church was the church the the the spiritual church jesus church went free on the day of pentecost it was a great thing after you receive amen uh you shall receive power after the holy ghost come upon you shall receive energy after the holy ghost come upon you right so so so when the holy ghost came down they got power to live right power to right right they know to walk right they talked they spoke in tongues they healed they did all kind of things they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ they were in the word of god to tea god did great things in that church but over years they got they got bound just like samson got bound in delilah's lap the church got bound because they went into catholicism organized religion and when the pentecost see the first time samson got bound that represented luther luther came out but went right back into the same catholicism he was bound that's that represents samson going into delilah's lap giving the first thing just give me tie me up with green whis he broke free from that hallelujah said but then he went back into a lap and and laid down again and she said just give me some new ropes hallelujah right and that was wesley amen wesley come out and and start preaching amen uh he went a little further than uh the justice lived by faith he was talking about sanctification how you had to live right glory to god amen but but they kept playing around with that catholicism went right back into denominational organization all over again oh hallelujah say that was wesley with the with the ropes but then uh here comes pentecost that come i'm talking about church history now but here come the pentecostal church they broke free from delilah's lap which represented the catholic church they broke free but this time saying now you know what samsung a lot to me these three these two two times what where just said just put a put a uh a weave my hair put a bean we weave my hair with a b he said he said she did it samson philistine saying he broke free but this time you say uh you cut my hair this fourth time after the pentecostal revival the church went into the nomination again hallelujah that's why different things came back into the church the organization brought back a lot of stuff when they were free from all of that they didn't have those problems but when they got back into organized religion they start acting like the baptist they start acting like the method they start acting like this is this is the spiritual thing as to what happened with the church yes they had the power but when they got when they when they when they gave up the secrets they went into bondage this time they got their eyes put out what happened when their eyes got put out they can't see the word no more can't see the word but i want you to know something while samson representing the church in that condition god has some hair growing back god was bringing his glory back god was bringing his anointing back in his bondage he was being restored and the bible said i will restore saith the lord i'm telling you the church was being restored even in the midst of it there was some undergrowth happening and i need to let you know you're a part of that undergrowth [Music] but you won't go back into bondage again and that's why samson could pray to prayer god once more lord let me die with these philistines see when sasha prayed that prayer he slayed more philistines in his death than he did while he was living let me tell you something when we die to the way our old church taught us when we die to the way we used to hear things we will slay more philistines in death and let me tell you the scriptures saying lest a quarter week go in the ground and die in about us alone but if it dies it'll bring forth much fruit amen that's where we're at lord give me these five minutes here lord being led by the spirit being led by the holy spirit now one more little thing i want to teach you coming back we have many things to talk of and let's just take for instance a growth say i want your sister tina this for you and anybody else that got something in the devil trying to attack you with a growth something that isn't he says uh that it's something that that isn't a growth for instance a deaf ear now he's using that as an example for instance a deaf ear if a man is deaf the bible said win the deaf spirit so whatever growth it is it's a spirit it says when the death spirit went out of the man the deaf spirit now if a man's death there's one thing to do the sensible thing to do is go to your doctor now how many of y'all don't believe in doctors the prophet said a sensible thing to do go to the doctor hallelujah amen let him examine you he'll look all over it well he'll perhaps say and tell you why you're deaf maybe something has slipped and it's cutting off the energy to the nerve maybe something has slipped and it's cutting off the energy to the nerve maybe in your life something has slipped and it's cutting off the energy and that's why you're in the condition you're in something has cut off your energy i'm trying to get you motivated look at this then if he can operate and pull that slip back it'll be energized and when you're energized you'll hear again for instance sometimes when the teeth is out causes to pull down and it makes you hard of hearing your teeth affect your hearing a prophet is telling you this right amen it says because it makes you hard of hearing many things like that are natural things but what if the doctor said i don't see why you're deaf why you're dumb and can't speak why you're blind and can't see say now if it's a cataract it's a germ of life and it's growing a body and it's covering over the sight but what if it's not a cataract what if the doctor says the nerve is dead well what kill the nerve it's not supposed to be not supposed to be that way god didn't want it that way just so much of the nerve died well why didn't all the nerve die see they just give you all kind of excuses because they don't know then why didn't all the nerve die just in the eye it says it's because a blind spirit it's because of blind spirit amen uh uh jesus called it that no matter how old-fashioned it seems it's still the truth the bible said so now if there's an unseen something that the doctor can't see neither can he feel he can't touch it no way but the nerve is dead it's a blind spirit shutting off stopping shutting off the energy to the eye or to the ear now see this is a spirit that's causing a lump in our sister's throat so she can't sing y'all know god done blessed up with the ability to be able to sing for the glory of god teachings just how she how she make a living but singing is what she was born for amen come on somebody i think murphy said praise is what i do see the rest of it is just part of my my make a living but this is what i do this is why i was born amen sometimes sister tina can sing or something and it'll shift the atmosphere at a funeral in a shifty atmosphere in church or shift the atmosphere so you think the devil gonna try to get it to sit on that it see it opens up the it opens up the floor for the anointing to come it's a it's it's a spirit trying to cut that off glory to god look at this he says uh uh uh like there uh it says shut off the energy to the eye to the ear like if there was a transparent band around my arm you can't see it you can't see it you couldn't you couldn't feel it but my hands getting dead well there's no need of uh uh there's no need of putting hallelujah this thing okay stop oh glory to god said there's no need of putting self out here you've got to deal with it here after a while if you don't move it it'll become completely dead if you don't use it it'll become completely bad if you don't do something with it then the devil will wipe it out wipe you out the devil wants you to feel sorry for yourself amen but he's trying to hinder that gift from going forward you got to snap out of that thing you got to be energized by the spirit of god [Applause] amen look at this he says uh uh uh it'll be completely dead you'll lose the use of it now what does divine healing do divine healing prayer to god faith cuts that loose takes away that spirit i love this statement faith cuts that loose takes away that spirit then what happens energy begins to come in can i just i want to i just want to say see when when the devil i mean the doctor can go and he can cut this and cut that you know exactly what he's done through the cuts you've got scars that show that the doctor benedict cut but when it comes to the spirit of god it goes without a cut hallelujah and it just kind of gets right into that little spot where where you know you needed god to come in and do something for you and he began he begins to amen take away the spirit that's actually trying to cut you off he's taking away the spirit that's giving you the mind battles he's taking away the spirit that makes you walk in condemnation he's taking away the spirit that makes you think like nobody loves you he's taking away the spirit and when he takes away the spirit your nerve your spiritual man is being energized the c word will be energized by the spirit now i'm going to tell you something when you talk about divine healing oftentimes people can't feel when they got healed x is a tiny body she never knew when the cancer dropped off but something cut the spirit a prayer of faith cut the spirit it was at a deeper level than what was on the outside the prayer of faith went on the inside and cut the cut the source off and when the source would come out the nerve or the the inside of her body begin to get energized and i'm gonna tell you something about god when he's giving you energy your situation can change in 24 hours [Music] you ain't got to wait no longer if you can just accept the energy coming from the holy ghost amen the word has been planted in you let that seed work that you've been given be energized energy begins to come in and the person begins to see better they might not see perfect at once but they're going to start seeing better because a c word is energized by the spirit let's pray father we need the spirit we've been given this example father of these different grounds that the word of god can fall on the word is a seed that the soil souls and it falls on these various grounds this wayside rocks and thorns also good ground we want to be good ground today father that we could take the word and not allow the enemy to come after we leave here and just begin to take these things out of us we got to fight to keep what you've given us lord i pray that you would just do a mighty work and as i just read this this last quote a doctor might not be able to diagnose and see what's causing the problem he can see the problem but it can't figure out what's causing it but as jesus said it's this is the spirit went out of a man and that's what we're dealing with things at a spiritual level i pray that as the word of god has been preached that the spirits would leave the people that thus even those that are at home hearing the word of god may spirits begin to leave the people may they be set free from the inside god that it would manifest itself on the outside and we realized god the word the the promise that we've been holding onto and we've been quoting over ourselves that seed word is energized it receives its strength it receives its motivation it receives everything from the spirit of god it's not by might it's known by power it's going to be by the spirit of almighty god so the word has been sown god now let let the operations take place that the people might go free lord only you can do it jesus father we committed lord into your hands and we just thank you father for what you have already done thank you for your word it's in jesus name we pray amen amen let's give the lord a hand of praise for the solomon i'll turn the service back over to you amen the seed word is energized by the spirit i was thinking to myself you know that energizer bunny praise god you know he ain't nothing until he get a power source he's just a bunny a dead bunny but when he get a power source he can go all day long they put them energized abundance in there and that fella's going all day long but i'll tell you what the holy spirit is what energizes the church we don't get no batteries we get we get a touch from the holy ghost and that's what energizes the church hallelujah let's come under expectations saying amen to the word of god and expect god to give us some energy let's come get our our batters recharged when we come to the house of god amen god bless you church god bless you brother solomon will take it from here praise the lord praise the lord praise the lord god bless you will you stand to your feet [Music] [Music] same holiness holiness is what you want for me come on listen let's take it from the top oh say holiness holiness is

speaking to our hearts this morning father just thinking as our pastor was preaching lord we ask you to be who you are we were expecting to see the supernatural and then lord god to hear the words from brother luke i give my life to you and i receive my healing father one of the greatest supernatural supernatural miracles that we can see is a soul saved lord god father we ask for the supernatural lord god and you cause a prayer line to break forth lord at the beginning of the service lord bodies are healed lord god because you are here father your word came forth lord to transform our lives lord lord to break the chains lord father we shall know the truth and the truth shall make us free father not just set us free if we are set free we can be captured again but when we are
