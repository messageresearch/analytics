[14:02] amen you may be seated thank
[14:11] you so my uh my title
[14:16] tonight is and the Darkness comprehended
[14:19] it
[14:21] not and I want to kind of hone in on
[14:25] that word
[14:26] comprehended I looked the the definition
[14:29] of this word up in the Webster
[14:32] dictionary the meaning is to grasp the
[14:35] nature of significance or meaning of on
[14:41] dictionary.com definition to understand
[14:44] the nature or meaning of grasp with the
[14:48] Mind
[14:51] perceive so this
[14:54] sermon you all just bear with me because
[14:56] we could feel like we're going all over
[14:58] the place
[15:00] but uh with the help of the Lord we'll
[15:03] pray everything ties together at the
[15:05] end so before I even get started I want
[15:08] to tell you guys a
[15:09] story and uh I think most everybody here
[15:13] has heard my testimony heard our our our
[15:16] my my my family's background and you
[15:20] know how we were we were born we were
[15:22] raised in the message me and my wife got
[15:25] married had a couple couple young ladies
[15:29] um
[15:31] we went 19 years in our marriage before
[15:34] we were about to to to give it up and
[15:37] the Lord intervened and and brought us
[15:39] back in into the fellowship and and got
[15:44] us back into church and um that's been
[15:47] about seven years ago now and uh so I
[15:51] had known I'm sure I'm pretty sure
[15:53] everybody here knows brother Trevor Ean
[15:56] and I met brother Trevor Eman in 199 97
[16:00] and uh me and him remained good friends
[16:03] um from then on we just really hit it
[16:05] off and uh so when we came back to
[16:08] church and brother Trevor played a big
[16:10] part in us coming back to church um I
[16:14] leaned on brother Trevor a lot uh
[16:17] through our our first year first couple
[16:21] years and uh just asking him I I would
[16:24] take we would go out to lunch after a
[16:27] Sunday morning every single week we
[16:30] would go out to lunch and I would just
[16:31] wear him out with questions I mean we're
[16:34] talking about two hour lunches here you
[16:36] know I mean I would just wear him out
[16:39] and uh I remember sitting one time and
[16:43] uh this we' probably been coming back to
[16:45] church now for uh maybe about six months
[16:49] and uh we went out to lunch and we get
[16:52] on the subject of the Holy
[16:54] Ghost and uh brother Trevor took the
[16:57] opportunity and he looked at me and he
[16:59] said uh so do you have the Holy
[17:03] Ghost now we'd been back in church about
[17:07] six
[17:08] months my lifestyle I was probably
[17:11] sitting at that luncheon with my shorts
[17:15] on my lifestyle looked
[17:18] like we came to church on Sunday morning
[17:22] that was
[17:24] it Sunday evening I had a tea time right
[17:29] that's what I did that's what that's
[17:31] what our church life looked like okay
[17:34] Sunday morning we came to church Sunday
[17:37] evening I was playing
[17:39] golf he looks at me he says do you have
[17:41] the Holy
[17:43] Ghost I say yes sir I
[17:45] do because I had had an experience in
[17:52] 1997 and I thought I had received the
[17:54] Holy
[17:56] Ghost now that experience in 199 97 it
[17:58] was in Pennsylvania brother Billy Paul
[18:00] brownon was having some meetings there
[18:03] and I went up for
[18:05] prayer and when I went up for prayer I
[18:08] told Brother Billy when he before he
[18:10] prayed I need the Holy Ghost so bad is
[18:13] exactly how I I put it and I remember
[18:16] his prayer and I'll I'll remember his
[18:19] prayer the rest of my
[18:21] life and it got very
[18:25] emotional and there
[18:27] was crawling to the altar basically
[18:30] after he got done praying and I was
[18:33] there just crying there was a lot of
[18:36] emotion
[18:37] there and I thought that I had received
[18:40] the Holy
[18:41] Ghost but as my life started
[18:46] going you could see something wasn't
[18:48] right all right now I couldn't see this
[18:52] but you could see something wasn't
[18:55] right so I told brother Trevor
[18:59] yes I have the Holy Ghost cuz and then
[19:02] then what what's brother Trevor going to
[19:03] say back to me okay you know what do you
[19:06] what do you say to somebody that's
[19:09] living a
[19:10] lifestyle and they're and but they're
[19:12] claiming to have the Holy Ghost what do
[19:15] you say to
[19:17] him we
[19:20] live in the Leo Dean age Amen brother
[19:24] the prophet in 63 The Sermon Just One
[19:27] More Time Lord
[19:28] he said the Bible said the rich Leo deia
[19:31] Church age would have need of nothing
[19:34] and not know that she was naked blind
[19:38] miserable and don't even know
[19:42] it that was the condition I was sitting
[19:45] in right there when brother Brandon made
[19:49] these
[19:49] statements back in between 47 and 65 sir
[19:54] I don't believe that he was making these
[19:56] statements for Pentecostal or Baptist
[19:58] people believe he was making that
[20:00] statement for message Believers right
[20:05] now that's right have need of nothing
[20:08] I've got the Holy Ghost I'm going to a
[20:11] message church I don't need anything I'm
[20:15] good to go come on brother but there I
[20:18] sat having lunch with brother Trevor yes
[20:22] sir I've got the Holy
[20:26] Ghost fast fast forward
[20:31] 2019 I did receive the Holy
[20:33] Ghost this was a couple years after we
[20:36] had been back in
[20:37] church I can still
[20:40] remember that
[20:44] time because I can I I remember brother
[20:46] Brown talking about from that
[20:49] time and I can still say from that time
[20:54] then I saw a change in my
[20:57] life
[20:59] brother Aaron Oglesby was preaching we
[21:01] were having some special meetings there
[21:03] was a prayer line going there's people
[21:06] going through the prayer line I didn't
[21:08] go through the prayer line I was just
[21:10] sitting there in my Pew
[21:15] praying I can't say there was a whole
[21:17] lot of emotion going
[21:19] on I knew he was there amen amen had a
[21:24] tear maybe run down my
[21:26] cheek I'm not even going to necess
[21:28] necessarily say I knew what had happened
[21:30] in that moment but I do think back to
[21:33] that and think brother Jack I wonder if
[21:36] brother brandham would have been
[21:38] standing there having that prayer line
[21:40] wow would he have looked
[21:42] out would he have said the brother
[21:45] sitting on the end of that
[21:47] row Hallelujah you just got what you
[21:50] were looking for Glory yes
[21:55] amen so I received the Holy Ghost
[22:00] then when I received the Holy
[22:03] Ghost undoubtedly the first
[22:07] thing that changed for me was my desire
[22:11] to go to
[22:13] church I didn't care if it was Sunday
[22:16] morning Sunday night Wednesday night
[22:20] special meetings somebody else's Church
[22:23] my home Church my desire to go to
[22:26] church
[22:29] astronomically
[22:32] changed I didn't just want to go to
[22:34] church I wanted to get there early Amen
[22:37] to church
[22:42] amen was about a year after me receiving
[22:45] the Holy Ghost brother Nathan Bryant
[22:47] which is the pastor of our
[22:49] church he he allowed me a Sunday night
[22:52] to give my
[22:54] testimony right before I gave my
[22:56] testimony I I had my youngest daughter I
[22:59] had her sing a
[23:01] song you guys might know this song it's
[23:04] it's called
[23:06] church and I find that even this was
[23:09] back in
[23:11] 2020 but I looked back at this song and
[23:14] it was just so relevant to even now and
[23:18] just this this is where I was at so I'm
[23:21] just going to read I'm I'm going to read
[23:22] a verse of it and and then and then the
[23:25] course so the the first
[23:28] verse is oh more than an
[23:34] obligation an
[23:36] obligation he's talking about going to
[23:38] church yes sir it's more than an
[23:41] obligation
[23:43] amen now brother Jack will tell you you
[23:45] need to come to church the Bible tells
[23:48] you you need to come to church brother
[23:52] brandom was very adamant about going to
[23:55] church see that's the obligation
[23:58] that we have but it's more than an
[24:02] obligation see something happened inside
[24:05] of here that made me want to come to
[24:08] church which made it more than an
[24:10] obligation to me it wasn't an obligation
[24:13] I wanted to come to
[24:15] church
[24:17] amen so more than an
[24:19] obligation it's our
[24:23] foundation this is where we build a
[24:26] foundation
[24:30] under the voice I don't care if it's a
[24:33] tape I don't care if it's a holy ghost
[24:35] filled Minister amen but your foundation
[24:38] is built right here amen when the tough
[24:41] times
[24:43] come the foundation you build here is
[24:46] what holds you through that getting that
[24:49] Holy Ghost in you will get you through
[24:52] those times right
[24:55] amen the family of God
[24:58] I know it's hard but we need each other
[25:02] we're sisters and
[25:04] brothers this is my family right here
[25:07] praise God right
[25:12] here we need each other
[25:14] amen and we all know
[25:18] there's always Things Between Brothers
[25:20] and Sisters right think brother Rand
[25:23] said we fight in the backyard we unite
[25:25] in the front you know
[25:28] we're going to have troubles it's hard
[25:30] this is hard this is a big family it's
[25:32] hard but we need each other we get
[25:36] strength from each other Hallelujah it
[25:38] is important to be in
[25:42] church take me back to the place that
[25:45] feels like
[25:47] home my family here at home amen the
[25:51] people I can depend
[25:53] on the faith that's in my bones I love
[25:57] that
[25:58] it's in my
[26:00] bones if I'm a Christian now or if I'm a
[26:03] if I'm a Child of God now I was always a
[26:05] child of God it was in my bones that's
[26:08] right take me back to a preacher in a
[26:12] verse maybe a prophet in a quote
[26:15] right where they've seen me at my worst
[26:19] to the love I had at first oh I want to
[26:22] go to church all right all
[26:26] right that song was so me when I first
[26:30] got the Holy Ghost it still is me but
[26:33] that was the first thing that hit me I
[26:35] want to go to church
[26:38] amen while we're thinking on
[26:42] that let's turn to John 4 we're going to
[26:46] read
[26:54] 16-9 very very familiar brother random
[26:57] talk talks about this story I think more
[26:59] than any other story in the
[27:02] Bible Jesus saith unto her go call thy
[27:05] husband and come hither the woman
[27:08] answered and said I have no husband
[27:10] Jesus said unto her thou Hast well said
[27:13] I have no husband for thou Hast had five
[27:15] husbands and he whom thou now Hast is
[27:19] not thy husband in that sayest thou
[27:21] truly the woman saith unto him sir I
[27:25] perceive interesting perceive
[27:29] comprehend if I remember we just read
[27:30] the definition of comprehend I perceive
[27:33] that thou art a
[27:35] prophet so my question is what happened
[27:39] here this woman which was a sinner which
[27:44] was living a
[27:46] lifestyle that she had no business
[27:48] living yes sir she wasn't living right
[27:51] this this woman was not in fact brother
[27:53] Bri talks about she had to come to this
[27:55] well at a particular time of the day
[27:57] because the other sisters did not want
[28:00] to associate with her brother she was
[28:02] not a good person morally I she was not
[28:06] good right but what happened right here
[28:09] in this
[28:10] moment sir I perceive that thou art a
[28:15] prophet she comprehended something right
[28:18] there now this was a conversation that
[28:21] took over just a few minutes of time
[28:23] this didn't take days or weeks this
[28:25] wasn't her coming to church year after
[28:28] year this took place in just a few
[28:33] minutes what was it that would change
[28:36] This Woman's life
[28:39] forever in just a few minutes of
[28:43] time what was
[28:46] that 180 Dee turn this woman made she
[28:50] was heading this way in just a few
[28:52] minutes she's heading the other
[28:56] way
[28:58] while you're thinking about that I'm
[29:00] going to tell you another
[29:04] story so when I came back to
[29:08] church I've always been a big fan of
[29:12] sports
[29:15] so Super
[29:17] Bowl I love the Super
[29:20] Bowl Super Bowl lands on Sunday right
[29:23] come on
[29:24] brother I'm a big fan of golf
[29:27] all right brother Jack I know you know
[29:30] what the riter cup is for those who
[29:33] don't know what the Ryder Cup is this is
[29:35] a golf tournament but it only happens
[29:37] once every other year and it's when the
[29:40] USA plays the
[29:42] Europeans love this tournament it's like
[29:45] no other everybody always you know
[29:47] talking about golf how they just barely
[29:49] clap their hands everybody's real quiet
[29:51] not in this tournament uh-uh it's on I
[29:55] mean you got people screaming USA USA
[29:58] and if you're in Europe and you know
[29:59] takes place here one year and then two
[30:01] years later it's in Europe and I mean
[30:02] these people get crazy into this
[30:05] tournament it is a really cool
[30:07] tournament but see the problem
[30:10] is is the final day is on Sunday all
[30:14] right so as I'm coming back to
[30:17] church I got to make a choice
[30:20] here because I know the Super Bowl's
[30:22] coming up I know the Ridder Cup's coming
[30:25] up but see
[30:27] there's a difference in me something
[30:29] happened to
[30:31] me I received the Holy Ghost amen so
[30:35] when the Super Bowl came up said no I
[30:38] can record that because I want to go to
[30:41] church
[30:43] right when the writer cup came up no I
[30:48] want to go to church I can watch this
[30:52] later I found something better than the
[30:55] Super Bowl amen and actually let me
[30:58] rephrase that something found me that
[31:02] was better than the Super Bowl he came
[31:04] looking for me I didn't go looking for
[31:07] him he found me yes
[31:11] amen
[31:14] hallelujah anybody getting any confused
[31:16] at all as to where we're going with
[31:18] this I hope so may have you right where
[31:21] I want
[31:22] you let's turn to acts nine we're going
[31:25] to read 1 to six
[31:46] and Saul yet breathing out threatenings
[31:49] and Slaughter against the Disciples of
[31:51] the Lord went unto the high priest and
[31:53] desired of him letters to Damascus to
[31:55] the synagogue synagogues that if he
[31:58] found any of this way whether they were
[32:02] men or women he might bring them bound
[32:04] unto Jerusalem and as he journeyed he
[32:08] came near Damascus and suddenly there
[32:10] shined round him round about him a light
[32:13] from heaven and he fell to the Earth and
[32:16] heard a voice saying unto him Saul Saul
[32:19] why persecutest thou me and he said who
[32:23] art thou Lord and the Lord said I am
[32:26] Jesus whom whom thou persecutest it is
[32:28] hard for thee to kick against the Pricks
[32:31] and he trembling and astonished said
[32:34] Lord what will thou have me do and the
[32:37] Lord said unto him arise and go into go
[32:40] into the City and it shall be told thee
[32:43] what thou must
[32:44] do we're all very familiar with this
[32:48] story this is Paul at this point the
[32:52] name is Saul name gets changed to Paul
[32:57] this man
[32:59] was
[33:02] raised in a church yes
[33:05] sir maybe it was considered a message
[33:08] church I don't
[33:10] know but he was raised to know the Bible
[33:14] he knew the scripture he knew him
[33:17] frontwards and
[33:19] backwards this man was
[33:21] persecuting the church the the church
[33:24] the real Church he was coming after any
[33:30] anyone because he thought he was doing
[33:33] God a service this man wasn't doing this
[33:35] to be evil he thought he was doing God a
[33:38] service I mean this man was you know
[33:41] taught under Gia which was supposed to
[33:43] be one of I mean the the the best
[33:45] teachers there were I mean Paul knew his
[33:49] stuff and he was persecuting the church
[33:53] he had lived his life like his entire
[33:56] life yeah is how he
[33:59] lived and then in a
[34:02] moment something happens to
[34:06] him my question is what happened to
[34:10] him what would take do you know how hard
[34:13] it is to reach somebody in this
[34:15] condition right
[34:16] here when they know it all right when
[34:20] they know everything now we're going
[34:22] back to I don't need anything because
[34:24] I've got it all I know everything this
[34:28] is like the hardest person that brother
[34:31] Jack will ever have to reach this is the
[34:35] hardest person that any of you trying to
[34:37] testify to somebody these are the
[34:39] hardest people to reach because they
[34:40] know it they're already in the message
[34:43] Church they know everything they don't
[34:45] need anything that's right
[34:48] brother but what happened to him because
[34:51] this was in a moment same thing woman at
[34:54] the well in a moment yes 180 degree turn
[35:01] yes so the quick easy answer to this is
[35:06] they met Christ
[35:10] right is that the
[35:14] answer brother Mark is that the
[35:18] answer seems like it would be the answer
[35:21] sorry I'm picking on brother Mark I
[35:22] don't have anybody else to pick
[35:24] on it seems like that would be right all
[35:27] right that they just came in contact
[35:29] with
[35:34] Christ while we're thinking about that
[35:37] let me tell you another
[35:41] story so after I had re received the
[35:43] Holy the Holy Ghost I believe it was a
[35:46] couple years after this me and my wife
[35:49] decided we're going to take a uh trip
[35:51] for our anniversary so we tra we take a
[35:54] trip to San
[35:55] Antonio and we get a a hotel on the the
[35:59] the Riverwalk it's beautiful we have a
[36:02] really good time there um really pretty
[36:05] city if you've never been and uh last
[36:09] night we're
[36:10] there we decide that we're going to go
[36:13] to a restaurant right on the river so as
[36:16] we're walking down the river trying to
[36:18] decide which one we come to this um I
[36:22] think it was like an Irish some sort of
[36:24] restaurant restaurant we're reading the
[36:26] menu hey this looks pretty good so we'll
[36:28] you know we get tell them hey we're
[36:29] going to eat two table for two outside
[36:32] man the the guy sets us I mean I'm
[36:34] sitting if we're if the table's here I
[36:36] mean the river is right there I mean it
[36:38] it's just it's a beautiful spot we sit
[36:41] down and I look down and there's a drink
[36:45] menu now my wife can attest to I have
[36:49] never been a big drinker even when we
[36:51] were out in the world doing our thing
[36:53] that was just not my thing drinking
[36:55] there was a couple drinks that I kind of
[36:57] liked
[36:58] though I look down at the menu and on
[37:01] the menu is one of my favorite
[37:04] drinks favorite I'm
[37:08] thinking San Antonio Texas there's
[37:10] nobody around here that's going to know
[37:12] who I
[37:13] am this isn't going to get me drunk or
[37:16] anything just a tiny bit of alcohol in
[37:19] this drink what's the big deal so order
[37:23] the
[37:24] drink waiter comes he sets it down
[37:30] I'm just being transparent with you
[37:33] all he sets a drink down I look at the
[37:36] drink I look at my wife I look back at
[37:39] the drink I look over at her and I say I
[37:44] cannot
[37:45] believe the conviction that I'm feeling
[37:48] right
[37:49] now over one little
[37:55] drink
[37:58] now I'm going to be really transparent
[38:00] and I'm going to tell you the rest of
[38:01] this story I drank the
[38:05] drink even though there was something
[38:08] inside of
[38:10] here that was asking it was begging
[38:13] don't do
[38:16] this don't do
[38:18] it my flesh overrode
[38:23] that now there will be people that will
[38:27] tell you there was no way in the world
[38:28] that I had the holy
[38:30] ghost that it's not even possible How
[38:34] could a holy ghost filled Christian be
[38:37] sitting at a table order an a drink of
[38:40] alcohol and drink it and then claim I
[38:43] had the Holy Ghost I was just sitting
[38:45] with Trevor a few years ago in my shorts
[38:48] playing golf Sunday morning I was
[38:49] telling him the same thing yeah I've got
[38:51] the Holy Ghost but see there was a
[38:54] difference when I was playing golf on
[38:57] Sunday when I was sitting there talking
[38:58] to brother Trevor in my shorts there was
[39:00] nothing there nothing there when I
[39:04] ordered that drink I could tell with
[39:06] everything in me I looked at her and
[39:08] said the
[39:10] conviction something was inside of there
[39:12] that was making this different it was
[39:15] begging me don't do this doesn't matter
[39:19] if somebody's standing around watching
[39:21] you you know this is not right all right
[39:25] Jesus
[39:27] Jes there's a difference in a child of
[39:30] God walking into a trap that Satan sets
[39:34] and slipping and
[39:37] falling you've got the Holy Ghost you're
[39:39] going to get back up but there's a
[39:42] difference between slipping and falling
[39:44] and living a
[39:46] lifestyle I took that drink and I have
[39:49] never taken a drink s because I remember
[39:53] how it felt in here I remember the
[39:57] feeling I had towards him I love him I
[40:02] don't want to disappoint him I know what
[40:05] he's done for
[40:08] me
[40:10] Hallelujah I didn't go back to the bar
[40:13] the next week and order another drink
[40:15] and again and again that is a
[40:19] lifestyle I slipped I fell and then by
[40:23] his grace I got back up and started
[40:26] moving forward
[40:28] [Applause]
[40:31] again now there will be ministers that
[40:34] will tell you there's no way I had the
[40:36] Holy Ghost there's no way somebody with
[40:38] the Holy Ghost would do something like
[40:41] that
[40:43] 1961 you must be born
[40:46] again yes sir brother God is getting
[40:49] manifested Sons right now manifesting
[40:51] tell them all about this tonight you're
[40:53] a sinner tomorrow you're man manifested
[40:56] sons of God nonsense the prophet says
[41:01] with an explanation point
[41:04] nonsense where you get that in the word
[41:07] babies are not born men they're born
[41:10] babies and grow to
[41:13] men I was a baby I was growing you've
[41:18] got to give the person the opportunity
[41:21] to grow this is a progression now you
[41:24] should see progression
[41:26] we shouldn't be going backwards we
[41:28] should be constantly moving forward you
[41:31] slip you fall you get up and move
[41:33] forward not
[41:36] backwards but you got to have an
[41:38] opportunity to grow
[41:45] Hallelujah but that wasn't the person
[41:48] sitting
[41:50] there that was saying don't take that
[41:53] drink that wasn't me
[41:56] I obviously wanted the drink or I
[41:58] wouldn't have ordered the drink right
[42:00] this flesh wanted that drink but there
[42:03] was something more there there was
[42:05] something down inside that was saying
[42:08] don't do that
[42:12] Hallelujah let's go to numbers
[42:15] 13 we're going to go 30 through
[42:25] 33
[42:29] and Caleb stilled the people before
[42:30] Moses and said let us go up at once and
[42:34] possess it for we are well able to
[42:37] overcome come it but the men that went
[42:41] up with him said we be not able to go up
[42:44] against the people for they are stronger
[42:46] than we and they brought up an evil
[42:48] report of the land which they had
[42:51] searched unto the children of Israel
[42:54] saying the land
[42:56] through which we have gone to search it
[42:59] is a land that that eateth up the
[43:02] inhabitants thereof and all the people
[43:04] that we saw in it are men of a great
[43:07] stature and there was and there we saw
[43:10] the Giants the sons of anak which come
[43:13] of the Giants and we are we were in our
[43:16] own sight as Grasshoppers and so were we
[43:19] in their
[43:20] sight brother briam talks about this
[43:22] moment right here he talks about Caleb
[43:27] telling the telling the people we can do
[43:30] this Joshua bouncing up and down banging
[43:33] his chest saying come on we can do this
[43:37] people we can do this we can take this
[43:40] he promised that land to
[43:43] us but these other men came back said no
[43:47] we can't we can't do
[43:52] this two million
[43:55] people that came out of
[43:58] Egypt come to this point right
[44:02] here and only two of them out of two
[44:07] million said we can take this
[44:11] land what happened to the
[44:15] other
[44:17] 1,998
[44:19] people what was the
[44:21] difference they'd walked the same
[44:24] Journey that Caleb and Jos had walked
[44:27] right they'd seen the same Miracles the
[44:29] same signs and wonders they were sitting
[44:31] under the same
[44:34] Prophet what
[44:36] happened to cause
[44:43] this I wonder if
[44:46] those two
[44:50] million I wonder what they thought about
[44:52] their
[44:54] prophit I wonder how well they knew
[44:57] their
[44:59] Prophet I wonder if they
[45:01] knew his favorite
[45:05] gun I wonder if they knew the the name
[45:08] of his favorite dog
[45:11] right maybe his favorite
[45:14] horse how well did they
[45:16] know that
[45:19] prophet and maybe some of them were like
[45:23] no no that's not us we don't we don't
[45:25] have that deity spirit on
[45:27] us I wonder how well they knew their
[45:32] Pastor wonder if they could have told
[45:34] you like what size pants he
[45:37] wore what size shoe he
[45:43] wore I'm not saying that there's
[45:45] absolutely anything wrong with buying
[45:46] brother Jack a pair of
[45:49] pants but if you can do it and you don't
[45:52] have to ask sister Erica what size pants
[45:54] he wears there could be a
[45:57] problem you might want to check on
[46:01] that but what was it that
[46:05] separated these two
[46:07] men from the
[46:10] others while you think about that I'm
[46:14] GNA tell you another
[46:18] story
[46:20] so before I came back to church as I
[46:24] forem mentioned I love golf love to play
[46:31] golf and me and a group of guys we would
[46:35] go out and to make it a little bit
[46:38] interesting brother Mark we throw a
[46:41] little bit of money on
[46:42] it we get a game going wasn't nothing
[46:46] big if you did really
[46:49] good I would have paid for my round
[46:52] yesterday nothing big nothing major
[46:57] but see after I received the Holy Ghost
[47:01] my buddy calls me up he says hey we're
[47:03] going to go play Friday morning you
[47:05] going to play sure I'll be
[47:09] there and then I started
[47:11] thinking on the way to the golf course
[47:14] these guys are going to ask me what are
[47:16] we
[47:20] playing and something in
[47:22] here starts telling me you can't do do
[47:26] this now we're not talking about a lot
[47:29] of
[47:30] money and I remember I'd been thinking
[47:33] about this and I had remembered that
[47:36] brother Nathan had just played a tape in
[47:38] our church not too long before this
[47:39] moment and I remember brother brandom
[47:42] saying not even for a
[47:46] nickel it's not
[47:48] right so something in
[47:51] here starts telling me you can't do this
[47:57] so I get to the golf course we get to
[47:59] the first tea box and I still remember
[48:02] this moment I remember standing there
[48:05] with my club in my
[48:07] hand the guys were behind me talking
[48:10] about what game they're going to
[48:13] play and I'm just swinging the
[48:16] club back and
[48:19] forth because Jonathan
[48:22] halin wanted to gamble
[48:27] because the
[48:28] only when you're standing over a birdie
[48:31] Putt and that heart starts pounding a
[48:33] little
[48:34] bit put some money on
[48:37] it then that heart really starts
[48:40] pounding it just makes it a little bit
[48:42] more interesting but it's not right it
[48:45] wasn't right so I'm standing there and I
[48:48] know they're getting ready to ask me and
[48:50] here comes a moment for me right
[48:53] here same moment brother Mark is
[48:55] ordering that
[48:56] drink it's
[48:58] coming and I know it's coming I know
[49:01] Satan has set this moment up right here
[49:04] for me what am I going to
[49:09] do hey Jonathan what game you want to
[49:13] play not today
[49:16] guys not
[49:18] today because there was something inside
[49:21] of here that was saying don't do it
[49:25] Jonathan howchin the Flesh of Jonathan
[49:27] hch everything in me wanted to do it but
[49:32] there was something else in here that
[49:35] was saying don't do it son
[49:39] amen
[49:41] amen praise God John
[49:45] 6
[49:54] 56-61
[50:01] he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my
[50:05] blood dwelleth in me and I in
[50:09] him as the living father has sent me and
[50:12] I live by the father so he that eateth
[50:15] me even he shall live by me this is that
[50:18] bread which come down from heaven not as
[50:21] your fathers did eat mana and are dead
[50:24] he that eateth of this bread shall live
[50:27] forever these things said he in the
[50:29] synagogue as he taught in capernium
[50:32] many therefore of his disciples when
[50:35] they had heard this said this is an hard
[50:38] saying who can hear it when Jesus knew
[50:41] in himself that his disciples murmured
[50:44] it at it he said unto them doth this
[50:48] offend you we're going to drop down to
[50:51] 64 but there are some of you that
[50:54] believe not for Jesus knew from the
[50:56] beginning who they were that believed
[50:58] not and who should betray him and he
[51:01] said therefore said I unto you that no
[51:04] man can come unto me except it were
[51:06] given unto him of my father from that
[51:10] time many of his disciples went back and
[51:14] walked no more with
[51:16] him now this moment right
[51:20] here was shortly after Jesus had just
[51:24] fed 5,000
[51:26] people he' crossed over the
[51:30] sea and he's talking
[51:33] primarily to his original 12 disciples
[51:37] and the
[51:38] 70 disciples that he ordained to go out
[51:42] and preach the
[51:45] gospel brother brandham said it was in
[51:48] this moment right here that all 70 of
[51:52] those men walked away right here
[51:56] yes Jesus Christ has just said you have
[51:59] to eat my flesh and drink my blood and
[52:03] he gave absolutely no explanation for
[52:06] this whatsoever
[52:08] right what would you have
[52:13] done 70 men that were ordained by Jesus
[52:18] Christ
[52:19] himself they were taught by Jesus Christ
[52:23] they walked with Jesus
[52:25] Christ just turned and walked
[52:32] away but I thought Mark just a few
[52:34] minutes ago we said it's all about
[52:37] coming in contact with Christ that's
[52:39] what we said
[52:41] right all right it's coming in contact
[52:43] with
[52:45] Christ these
[52:47] men had walked with him they' ate with
[52:52] him they knew him
[52:55] yes
[52:59] yes why you think about that I'm going
[53:03] tell you another
[53:07] story so me and my
[53:10] family every year for about I'm going
[53:14] say somewhere somewhere around 15 years
[53:17] when we weren't living right we took a
[53:20] trip just south of here to uh Fort
[53:24] Lauderdale this was one of our favorite
[53:26] vacation spots there a resort
[53:29] there we love the resort we love the
[53:32] layout got a bunch of swimming pools
[53:35] beaches right
[53:36] there perfect we love we found all of
[53:40] our favorite
[53:41] restaurants every single year sometimes
[53:43] twice a
[53:45] year we'd come down here for
[53:50] vacation so I received the Holy
[53:53] Ghost okay we can still go on vacation
[53:56] right it's not wrong to go on
[53:59] vacation tell my wife what we'll do got
[54:02] this good plan we're going to go down
[54:04] there we're going to go to the beach and
[54:06] we're either going to look way down to
[54:07] the left or we're going to look way down
[54:09] to the right and we're going to see
[54:10] where there's no people and that's where
[54:12] we'll go if somebody's walking by we'll
[54:15] just cover up no big deal we can do
[54:19] this so we get
[54:21] there Lord have mercy I have never seen
[54:24] so much seaweed e in all my
[54:28] life it was everywhere like there was no
[54:31] way we were getting in this water you
[54:33] couldn't even hardly get to the water
[54:35] because of the
[54:36] seaweed never seen anything like this so
[54:40] where do we end up at well obviously the
[54:47] pool Satan has a way of setting these
[54:51] up so as we're sitting here at the
[54:54] pool
[54:55] and I'm looking around of course there's
[54:58] no other message people there so we can
[55:00] all imagine how they're
[55:02] dressed I'm looking at myself guess what
[55:06] I'm back in a pair of shorts
[55:10] again my girls and my wife looked a
[55:13] whole lot better but they sure didn't
[55:15] look
[55:16] Holiness and I'm sitting
[55:18] there and I'm thinking about
[55:23] this and something starts talking to
[55:26] me this isn't
[55:28] right this isn't right it doesn't matter
[55:31] if there's no members from Brother
[55:33] Jack's church
[55:35] here doesn't matter if there's no other
[55:37] message people here it doesn't matter if
[55:40] none of these people here even know that
[55:42] you're a Christian because they sure
[55:43] couldn't tell we were right then and
[55:45] something starts talking to
[55:49] me this is
[55:51] wrong you shouldn't be doing this son
[55:54] amen
[55:56] now all we were doing was wanting to go
[55:58] to the
[55:59] beach Lord knows I love the
[56:01] beach hopefully that doesn't kick me out
[56:05] brother I'm not a mountain man I don't
[56:08] hunt I like the
[56:13] beach all we were doing was going to the
[56:15] beach that was
[56:17] it we didn't even bring our vacation
[56:22] clothes about it that's a big one guys
[56:25] all right talk about cuz I tell you
[56:28] years past even going to church we' have
[56:31] went there those clothes that we' had in
[56:33] our luggage would have looked a whole
[56:35] lot different than those clothes we'
[56:36] have been wearing at home right those
[56:39] are our vacation clothes all
[56:44] right but something was telling me this
[56:48] is wrong you shouldn't be doing this son
[56:51] and as I looked
[56:53] around the thing that probably got me
[56:55] the most was not only the fact there was
[56:58] a voice inside of me saying don't do
[57:00] this but I'm looking at three ladies
[57:02] that are looking at me to be the
[57:05] example
[57:07] Brothers they're looking at you that's
[57:09] right to be the example that's right
[57:12] that's right and that moment it was
[57:14] killing
[57:15] me and I was literally thinking Lord I'm
[57:20] sorry I'm sorry Lord Satan not again
[57:25] this will be the last time right here
[57:27] and that was the last time we sat at a
[57:29] swimming pool because something inside
[57:34] here was telling me this isn't wrong I
[57:36] didn't need brother Jack to tell me this
[57:38] wasn't wrong I didn't need Nathan Bryant
[57:41] to tell me I didn't need brother brandom
[57:42] to tell me there was something inside
[57:45] there saying son this isn't right my God
[57:50] praise
[57:53] God we just talked about about four
[57:55] stories out of the
[57:57] Bible and I thought that brother Mark
[58:00] had just said that this was all about
[58:03] coming in contact with Jesus
[58:06] Christ and again I'm just picking on
[58:08] brother Mark
[58:09] here right now I know some of you guys
[58:12] might be sitting there thinking well you
[58:13] know the children of Israel they didn't
[58:14] actually come in contact with Christ
[58:17] but the prophet of God
[58:19] said he came as a pillar of fire to the
[58:23] children of Israel yes that same Pillar
[58:25] of Fire was manifested in the body of
[58:28] Jesus Christ and then it went back to
[58:31] the pillar of fire and that's who Paul
[58:34] met on the road to Damascus in fact the
[58:36] light even said I am Jesus they met the
[58:42] same person right that the woman at the
[58:44] well met the 70 that walked away met
[58:49] right yes they met the same one that's
[58:52] right the woman at the well same person
[58:54] right right
[58:56] amen amen what
[59:03] happened I'm getting ready to make a
[59:05] statement here it's got to be more than
[59:08] just coming in contact with Jesus Christ
[59:12] there's got to be more to it than just
[59:16] that every one of us know right now he
[59:19] promised he's here right now he is in
[59:23] this room with us right two or three
[59:25] gathered I will be there that's his
[59:28] promise he's here right
[59:31] now it's got to be more than just coming
[59:33] in contact with
[59:35] him 63 a
[59:38] prisoner Prophet says what a thing it
[59:41] must have been for Paul see all that he
[59:44] had been trained to do was vice versa so
[59:48] now with all the education he had it
[59:51] would become not to him now he knew that
[59:54] that he had an experience he knew I'm
[59:57] going to read that again now he knew he
[59:59] had an experience so here's another good
[1:00:02] lesson for us the experience alone isn't
[1:00:07] enough explanation point experience
[1:00:09] alone it's got to be an experience
[1:00:12] according to the word of the
[1:00:15] Lord according to the word of the Lord
[1:00:18] amen what's an experience according to
[1:00:22] the word of the Lord
[1:00:26] well let's think about this for a
[1:00:31] minute when the spirit
[1:00:34] falls falls on the just and it falls on
[1:00:36] the
[1:00:38] unjust when the when the when the when
[1:00:40] the rain falls the weeds rise up praise
[1:00:43] the Lord I needed
[1:00:46] water the wheat raises up praise the
[1:00:50] Lord I needed
[1:00:53] water he's here every
[1:00:56] service and yet the darkness
[1:00:59] comprehended it
[1:01:01] not amen it's got to be more than just
[1:01:04] coming in contact with him what's the
[1:01:06] difference between the wheat and the
[1:01:10] weeds the wheat has something in
[1:01:15] here that's leading and
[1:01:18] guiding that something in there will
[1:01:20] lead you into all truth amen that we
[1:01:25] will stand up and say give me a
[1:01:28] slingshot CU I've got this giant out
[1:01:31] here that's making threats and I'll be
[1:01:33] back I'm going to go take his head
[1:01:35] off that's
[1:01:41] right the wheat has something that the
[1:01:44] weed can never get that's exactly right
[1:01:53] brother
[1:01:57] sorry you
[1:02:01] Jesus the
[1:02:03] wheat when it comes to that moment when
[1:02:06] Caleb says we can take the land the
[1:02:09] wheat will rise up and say we can take
[1:02:12] the
[1:02:13] land when that wheat comes
[1:02:16] into a a trap that Satan has set there's
[1:02:20] something inside the wheat saying don't
[1:02:23] do this
[1:02:25] there's something there that is that
[1:02:27] something that will hold you right there
[1:02:29] when the storms come that's the
[1:02:32] something that will hold you
[1:02:35] amen we've all heard the prophet say
[1:02:37] many
[1:02:38] times there's a man here that can turn
[1:02:41] on the lights well I can testify to that
[1:02:44] man is here right now that can turn on
[1:02:48] the lights there is a moment though he
[1:02:51] actually does have to turn on the lights
[1:02:54] yes we've heard the prophet many times
[1:02:57] say there's a greater than Solomon here
[1:03:01] I can tell you right now there is a
[1:03:03] greater than Solomon he's here in this
[1:03:06] building right now yes
[1:03:10] sir there's got to be a moment though
[1:03:13] that you
[1:03:14] realize there is a greater than Solomon
[1:03:17] here you got to realize there is a
[1:03:20] greater than Jonathan howchin here
[1:03:22] there's a greater than brother Jack Duff
[1:03:25] here there's a greater than brother
[1:03:28] brandham here amen and he's here right
[1:03:32] now
[1:03:35] amen why am I telling you all these
[1:03:37] stories about
[1:03:41] myself why am I pouring my heart out to
[1:03:44] you
[1:03:45] guys these are nothing this this this
[1:03:48] stuff is nothing that I'm proud about
[1:03:50] I'm sitting here telling you I wanted to
[1:03:52] gamble I wanted wanted to go to the
[1:03:55] beach I wanted to take a
[1:03:59] drink why am I telling you this is I'm
[1:04:02] trying my best to point out to you what
[1:04:06] the Holy Ghost looks
[1:04:09] like he's given me a
[1:04:12] testimony that's what he's equipped me
[1:04:14] with to be able to stand here and say I
[1:04:16] have been on both sides of this brothers
[1:04:19] and sisters I know what this looks like
[1:04:21] I've got experience in this yes I know
[1:04:25] what it was like before doing all these
[1:04:28] things and not feeling a
[1:04:30] thing if if I felt anything it was
[1:04:32] because brother Jack Duff said don't do
[1:04:34] this right well brother Jack said don't
[1:04:36] do it maybe I shouldn't do it that's all
[1:04:38] that was it that was all it was get the
[1:04:40] Holy Ghost and then all of a sudden it's
[1:04:42] don't do it and it's coming from more
[1:04:44] than just brother Jack
[1:04:47] Duff yes amen that's
[1:04:51] it we've been coming to church now
[1:04:55] for six years and in the six years that
[1:04:57] I've been
[1:04:58] coming I'm just being blunt I'm seeing
[1:05:02] people go
[1:05:03] backwards they're going backwards and
[1:05:05] they're claiming that they got the H
[1:05:06] that's not the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost
[1:05:09] will not back up Glory that's not the
[1:05:12] Holy Ghost that's right amen people get
[1:05:14] so
[1:05:16] mad people get so mad when you preach
[1:05:18] Holiness come on brother they don't want
[1:05:21] to hear Holiness they don't want to hear
[1:05:23] how they shouldn't take that little

[1:05:27] they don't want to hear how they
[1:05:28] shouldn't wear vacation clothes they
[1:05:30] don't want to hear this stuff they just
[1:05:32] want to be content with blind miserable
[1:05:35] naked and don't know it they've got the
[1:05:38] Holy Ghost they don't need to hear any
[1:05:41] law and I will tell you that that has
[1:05:44] been passed on even to our message
[1:05:47] preachers that's right they stand in the
[1:05:49] pool pit and they take this message and
[1:05:51] they take this Bible and they water it

[1:15:06] comes from it because the reward is that
[1:15:08] people go free uh in their Spirit uh
[1:15:12] others are delivered amen because of uh
[1:15:15] what he shares and and just all how he
[1:15:18] just kind of took us through his life
[1:15:19] there and just you know I I I I just
[1:15:22] recall brother Brandon making a
[1:15:24] statement that the Holy Ghost won't
[1:15:26] misbehave itself in one person and then
[1:15:30] behave itself in another person and uh
[1:15:33] the reason that he felt the conviction
[1:15:36] is because amen here the the flesh is
[1:15:38] trying to misbehave but the Holy Ghost
[1:15:41] said no no no no no that that you can't
[1:15:43] do that no more you're you're not that
[1:15:45] guy anymore there's another person
[1:15:48] taking residence Amen in in this home
[1:15:51] and um and and and if we have not come
[1:15:54] to that experience and that's that's
[1:15:55] what we that's what we're looking for I
[1:15:57] have seen many people have an
[1:16:01] intellectual
[1:16:03] um um they've received the Holy Ghost
[1:16:06] intellectually let's put it that way
[1:16:09] they they received it intellectually we
[1:16:11] know how to act when we around the
[1:16:13] Saints we know how to we we got this we
[1:16:16] got this thing just just just perfectly
[1:16:17] down but God is not looking at what you
[1:16:19] do here it's what you do when you get
[1:16:21] out of there when you get to San Antonio
[1:16:24] sir when you get to Las
[1:16:26] Vegas hello somebody am man when you are
[1:16:30] on the other side of the world and ain't
[1:16:32] nobody there how how you living
[1:16:34] then praise God God God God you you I
[1:16:38] mean they say you got to you got to
[1:16:39] carry the Holy Ghost to
[1:16:41] kalamazo amen it'll live right in
[1:16:44] kalamazo it'll live right in the jungles
[1:16:46] of South uh South America the Holy Ghost
[1:16:49] can keep you wherever you are right and
[1:16:52] uh and this is this is the genuine holy
[1:16:54] ghost that we're looking for and I I
[1:16:55] just love the way he you know he brought
[1:16:57] that out cuz we would think that all he
[1:16:59] had to do is come in contact with Christ
[1:17:01] well the 70 came in contact with Christ
[1:17:05] but what did they have
[1:17:07] nothing is going to take a real
[1:17:09] experience with God Amen not just

[1:20:52] turn basically tur him into a fake
[1:20:54] Christian the way that it was operating
[1:20:56] and I felt like my brother said I felt
[1:20:58] convicted like God I can't keep to the
[1:21:01] point where I just I let the emotion
