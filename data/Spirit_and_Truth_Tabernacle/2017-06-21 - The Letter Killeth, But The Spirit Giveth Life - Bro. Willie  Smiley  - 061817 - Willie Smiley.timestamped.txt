[42:28] here but I'm so grateful we just want to
[42:32] as you get your Bibles out this morning
[42:36] just say Happy Father's Day to all and
[42:39] fathers I do not have I'm not a
[42:42] traditionalist I don't do things by
[42:44] tradition I don't have a Father's Day
[42:46] message for you this morning
[42:49] unfortunately not not that I couldn't
[42:51] prepare one there's a lot of things I
[42:55] understand about fatherhood and I could
[42:57] have preached out a Father's Day message
[42:59] but it wasn't on my heart none this week
[43:01] I do that at home sometimes we have
[43:04] those special days Easter and all of
[43:07] that and I just do not unless I'm
[43:09] directly inspired I don't do it but we
[43:13] have to preach
[43:15] godly men and on sometimes brothers you
[43:18] know maybe not even godly men but good
[43:21] men and good fathers that that goes a
[43:24] long way out and so we appreciate you
[43:27] guys this morning we salute you we trust
[43:30] that the wife and the children treat you
[43:33] well go the extra mile I see it's a lot
[43:36] of emphasis this morning I you know I

[43:40] praise the light I know yeah I got no
[43:43] members in this well y'all look quite on
[43:47] y'all a little quiet on me already now

[44:07] I'm not your past I'm just here standing
[44:10] in for him amen
[44:12] on special occasions and if sometimes
[44:16] you can't get here carving bra bra that
[44:19] you can stand in love me it's hard to
[44:21] tell brother Jack no like man I got my
[44:25] own touch the past is new so it's a hot
[44:28] you know one of those days when you get
[44:31] selfish we wanna passionately but I
[44:34] sometimes I like the opportunity to get
[44:36] away from from my church and and and
[44:38] don't bring nobody where I could just
[44:40] check out I don't have to worry about
[44:43] what I say you know how to dull it down
[44:47] I can say let's turn to the book of
[44:49] second Corinthians so so if I feel like
[44:54] I'm a crazy man after a while don't
[44:56] worry about it I'm just I'm just blowing
[44:59] off a little steam but we just got a
[45:01] little thought this morning and it's
[45:03] good to see everybody it's good to see
[45:05] my classmate Linda Amen and I just want
[45:09] to keep her in prayer it been also
[45:11] husband not too long ago but we trusted
[45:15] God continue to give us strength second
[45:19] Corinthians chapter 3
[45:22] now y'all pray for me because I kind of
[45:25] I've kind of been on a Bible series and
[45:29] I'm in 2nd Corinthians and we want to
[45:33] maybe just read one verse to 6 verse and
[45:35] I have you be seated
[45:37] I says who also has made us able
[45:41] ministers of the New Testament not of
[45:43] the letter but of the spirit for the
[45:46] letter kills but the Spirit given for
[45:49] life made a lot of the blessing to the
[45:51] reading of his words you may be seen
[45:52] this morning I we want to use that as a
[45:56] topic the letter killeth but the Spirit
[45:59] give it for life but I want to maybe for
[46:01] a few seconds background this scripture
[46:05] for a moment I like to say we've been on
[46:09] a little I don't think I'm a serious
[46:12] preacher but we've kind of been working
[46:14] through the Bible and trying to help
[46:17] folk to understand the scriptures I
[46:21] don't think it's just enough to be in
[46:23] church to be identified with the church
[46:27] and not really have a understanding of
[46:31] why you're here and and what's actually
[46:33] going on and what's actually taking
[46:36] place I don't think that that's enough I
[46:39] don't think God called us just to be
[46:41] good church members but I think that God
[46:46] called us to equip us to be able to go
[46:52] out and express him to the world that
[46:56] right I'm just touch this real briefly
[46:59] and imma get into our thought and then
[47:01] we're going to get out of here we
[47:03] started out in 2nd Corinthians chapter 1
[47:08] where the believing Church they kind of
[47:13] had a little issue with Paul because
[47:15] they they felt like he he was a little
[47:19] fickle and somebody that wasn't faithful
[47:24] he wasn't a man of his word
[47:26] and we took that as a topic and and you
[47:29] know I think when we look at the
[47:31] scriptures every you know everything in
[47:34] the Bible has a
[47:36] season and I think that you know God God
[47:41] allowed Paul because what was actually
[47:43] taking place was that Paul told the
[47:46] believers that he was he was going to
[47:48] come and then he was going to go to
[47:50] Macedonia and then he was going to come
[47:51] back through on his way back right but
[47:55] he following the leadership of the Holy
[47:58] Spirit he didn't come back that way and
[48:01] that's three sermons that I'd have to
[48:03] preach but I just want to touch this
[48:05] little point right quick and the thing
[48:08] of the thing of it was they felt like
[48:10] Paul Paul wasn't a man of his word and
[48:15] and I think it's so important for us as
[48:20] believers to be faithful and to meet I
[48:26] think that's important to be if nothing
[48:29] else be faithful be men and women of
[48:31] your word you you are your word your
[48:35] word I remember when I was growing up in
[48:38] New Jersey and we I was kind of young
[48:40] and we should kind of just throw things
[48:42] out there word is born and we could be
[48:45] lied but word is born with a straight
[48:49] face word is born brother word is
[48:51] Belling know you like with your fingers
[48:54] crossed behind your back word is born
[48:55] man put you're lying but we what we did
[48:59] not know that the depths of that you you
[49:03] you're no better than your word huh
[49:08] you're no better than your word I
[49:11] believe that God requires faithfulness
[49:17] faithful people I think that that that
[49:20] we're living in a time now where um
[49:24] people aren't as faithful as they used
[49:28] to be we we don't we don't see the
[49:32] gospel for what it really truly is in
[49:35] this hour what we're finding is people
[49:39] are making a whole lot of excuses but
[49:43] God requires faithfulness
[49:46] right and let me tell you something even
[49:49] as a body as a church body uh you should
[49:54] require that right that should be the
[49:58] standard of the church that we be
[50:01] faithful from the way your head such the
[50:05] way your head right that because there's
[50:10] a standard that's got to be a hold in
[50:12] the Church of the Living God and I think
[50:15] that that we all have a part in it I
[50:19] don't care if you younger all to make
[50:21] sure that people are being faithful
[50:23] faithful to God faithful to smell people
[50:27] to relationships faithful apparently all
[50:31] glory to his wonderful name how many
[50:33] believe that this morning hey man they
[50:37] they they were they were a little upset
[50:40] with with Paul but they didn't really
[50:44] understand some other message I'm gonna
[50:45] move on from that but I just want to
[50:47] drop that on right quick because I think
[50:50] when when we first became Christians
[50:53] brother Troy you know we were faithful
[50:56] now I'm not changed but I'm just friends
[51:00] folk have changed I have not changed
[51:03] I've been faithful for 28 years are you
[51:07] perfect both smile I didn't say that I
[51:09] just say I'm faithful I'm faithful you
[51:14] can get a hold of me I'll be in church
[51:18] when the church doors open I'll be there
[51:21] huh you hope you won't find me if I'm
[51:25] going on vacation I'm gonna find me
[51:27] somewhere where I can go on working
[51:29] because I feel funny when I can't go
[51:31] give God praise one day out the week at
[51:34] least well huh well I'm on vacation how
[51:42] can you ever go on vacation from God huh
[51:47] we get we get so caught up in worldly
[51:49] ism that we forget that we're serving a
[51:52] risen Savior
[51:53] hmm be faithful let's let's not make
[51:59] excuse well see you know I forget all
[52:03] about that see God God allows things
[52:07] that happen to try you anyway to try to
[52:10] try you to see where you are a man uh in
[52:14] your Christian walk that right um just
[52:19] this morning we we're preaching on the
[52:22] letter kills but the spirit giveth life
[52:25] and and you know if this is something my
[52:28] prints to sermons on this at home and I
[52:32] thought that this would be appropriate
[52:33] for this morning to try to help us to
[52:37] see what the gospel really is and how
[52:40] important this understanding is for us
[52:44] I just shouting I enjoy good singing
[52:49] like sister Tina sixteen was walking
[52:52] with I'm like wow sometimes if you want
[52:55] I give me just a little bit of the
[52:56] microphone pass off you know like
[52:59] running a race let me get my porch in
[53:01] the inner voice the voice was acting up
[53:04] when I walked up but that's I but I just
[53:08] I just I just like anything that
[53:10] pertains to church but but I think it's
[53:15] important for us to really understand
[53:17] the the fullness of the gospel and and
[53:20] and and what we have and how we're
[53:23] supposed to be operating
[53:24] amen as believers right like I say we
[53:29] shouted we scream we rolled on the flo
[53:33] we've not it we've done all of that
[53:36] right and that's wonderful but but you
[53:40] know that don't get you that far apart
[53:42] from understanding see if because if you
[53:46] don't understand that still the world
[53:49] can still have a we're gonna pull it
[53:52] anyway right but but you have no
[53:56] resistance apart from your understanding
[53:59] Amen why why he with the Corrine died
[54:02] for you he um
[54:07] I want to just strike something because
[54:10] I think that you know it's real funny
[54:14] that that and I've been around a little
[54:17] while and I might accept sometimes you
[54:21] you have to change the way that people
[54:23] look at things and the way that people
[54:25] approach thing a lot of times our
[54:28] mindset when we come to church we come
[54:31] to church uh just looking for some great
[54:34] swelling something some some great some
[54:40] great mystery that's been broken by the
[54:43] walk I'd say boy that was a deep that
[54:47] was aa you know how we do oh brother
[54:51] ah did you hear that did you hear that
[54:54] sermon did you see how he taught those
[54:57] quotes together he taught in Scripture
[55:00] with this quote with this oh my and then
[55:03] a lot of times you actually but what did
[55:05] he really actually free the world that's
[55:07] another story right and I believe in
[55:14] sermons and I believe in sunders we got
[55:17] to have Furman's we got to have good
[55:19] teaching because those are the things
[55:22] that that anchor us right but but but
[55:27] Paul is going to bring us up into
[55:29] something that I think is important for
[55:32] us right because he's talking about
[55:37] ministry right if you go back and really
[55:41] do some research and studying even in
[55:44] your footnotes if you've got a Scofield
[55:46] Bible us a part of the outline is
[55:50] dealing with ministry and I think people
[55:53] don't don't really understand ministry
[55:57] but I will help you this morning right
[56:00] and y'all don't quit angle be long if
[56:05] you if you don't quit I won't be low but
[56:09] if y'all start getting tired I'm gonna
[56:11] just preach for y'all no good why - our
[56:13] message
[56:15] now I ain't got two hours in me I've
[56:17] been going all weekend oh now watch this
[56:21] this this statement the property makes
[56:23] him and speak to the rock he says so
[56:27] that we can understand the gospel in its
[56:31] entirety you say the gospel it's not all
[56:36] together the word right amen
[56:42] sometimes you know it's like the word
[56:45] way it's more to it than just the way
[56:48] right
[56:49] Amen he says now the gospel is not all
[56:53] to get a little word he said now this is
[56:57] the Word of God and all things must be
[57:00] based upon the world right
[57:03] all things must be based upon and see
[57:06] this is where I think people
[57:09] misunderstand the Ministry of Malachi
[57:12] for right a part of what his ministry
[57:17] was all about is to base all of our
[57:21] understanding on something because you
[57:25] can't really have faith you really don't
[57:30] have faith unless you can have you'll it
[57:34] based upon something but faith has got
[57:39] to be based on something right I'm
[57:42] coming here has got to be based on
[57:45] something it's not you've gotta be able
[57:48] to base your entire Amen existed
[57:53] somewhere - something I see I'm here
[57:58] because of description but I come to
[58:03] church because of this scripture I'm
[58:08] saved because of these scriptures see I
[58:14] got somewhere to base the soul so that
[58:17] when people come you know are and kind
[58:22] of criticize and downplay you know wait
[58:25] a minute wait a minute wait a minute
[58:28] let me take you right here let me take
[58:31] you right here let me take you right
[58:33] here let me take you right here see my
[58:36] my understanding is based on something
[58:40] right
[58:41] faith has got to be based upon the Word
[58:45] of God what you believe has got to be
[58:48] based upon the Word of God it's not
[58:51] destined emotions emotions don't dukkha
[58:54] will always feel emotional but we got to
[58:58] have somewhere to base coming to church
[59:01] and what we believe in our stand if you
[59:03] don't you're not going to a man make it
[59:06] right Amen but that ain't in it
[59:09] all alone in itself right that's not the
[59:12] complete gospel but that's important
[59:17] how many can say amen to that see you
[59:21] can you can you you can be emotional you
[59:24] could come to the altar you could scream
[59:26] it's not singing all of that sometimes
[59:28] these things were in me they worried me
[59:31] when I see people get up get off the
[59:34] altar from screaming and howling and
[59:36] snarling all of this and then the other
[59:38] and then you don't see them no more
[59:41] we work in the church we do different
[59:43] things in the church and things of that
[59:45] makes it in next thing you know we
[59:46] disappear we leave we better than
[59:48] Houdini this right and I think the
[59:54] reason why is because it's just emotions
[59:58] it's just meant to with pursuing and we
[1:00:02] haven't found any place to base all of
[1:00:05] this home see and then if you don't
[1:00:09] you're still searching you're still
[1:00:13] seeking it and then you think it's out
[1:00:15] dance not out there I'm a living witness
[1:00:18] to that it's not out there that's dead
[1:00:22] the wages of sin is still dead but
[1:00:28] there's a true gift that's been given us
[1:00:31] eternal life
[1:00:33] right and note that no matter how how
[1:00:37] much you seek it out there you're not
[1:00:39] going to find it
[1:00:41] see because God places our thirst is us
[1:00:44] and only God can quench the thirst ah
[1:00:47] you know we could go along with let me
[1:00:50] get up I want nobody say bugs finally
[1:00:55] coming to beat us up today but but you
[1:00:59] know you want people to be sure see and
[1:01:03] then 20 some years of ministry and a
[1:01:06] being around a different types of
[1:01:09] meetings and seeing people and crying
[1:01:12] this and that knowledge of that and and
[1:01:14] then you don't see them right then you
[1:01:20] see people in church you know for a good
[1:01:23] little minute and then all of a sudden
[1:01:24] they disappear why because it was
[1:01:28] emotional it was sensation but they
[1:01:32] don't have any place to base that on
[1:01:34] not that that it's not here if the fist
[1:01:39] is it's the job of the ministry to take
[1:01:43] the Word of God and try to anchor so
[1:01:45] it's something that's beyond just
[1:01:48] emotional sensation and this is the
[1:01:51] thing that I preach to my church all the
[1:01:53] time because we see people at my brother
[1:01:57] Westco meetings
[1:01:58] getting ready to come and buy focus and
[1:02:03] we get all worked up for July hmm we we
[1:02:09] can't serve God to Jew like um well we
[1:02:14] can't be happy about church to Jew like
[1:02:17] uh-huh
[1:02:19] we can't give God praise we can't Amen
[1:02:22] the pastor to Jew like you know when do
[1:02:26] not get getting ready to roll around you
[1:02:29] know folks are you know halfway willing
[1:02:32] to give God praise uh we get we get this
[1:02:36] you know I want to be in the in the
[1:02:39] cloud nine
[1:02:40] we can't hardly hear you when just the
[1:02:43] regular song service but now
[1:02:45] we want to be in the quad all glory to
[1:02:48] God somebody say priests brush smiling
[1:02:51] uh but what are you doing the rest of
[1:02:55] the year this you know what that's a
[1:03:00] sacrifice
[1:03:02] huh that's fat to be able to serve God
[1:03:06] one weekend out of the year to kill god
[1:03:10] oh oh
[1:03:11] one weekend out of the year that's a
[1:03:13] shame
[1:03:15] that's a second uh man I want to serve
[1:03:19] God every time I walk through the door
[1:03:22] you know sister Bernie sing a song I can
[1:03:25] hardly wait to the church doors open to
[1:03:30] the singing in the shouting the praising
[1:03:32] begin you know that night know what I'm
[1:03:36] going to church the next day man I get
[1:03:39] restless brother through I came just to
[1:03:41] say I don't know where you go preach but
[1:03:44] but I'm not I can't wait to get down it
[1:03:48] used to be a time I'm sure you know when
[1:03:50] we should go back go to those meetings
[1:03:52] brunch artena you know we're young
[1:03:55] people back then now we we the
[1:03:58] grandparents and all that kind of stuff
[1:04:00] but back then we were the young people
[1:04:03] you know and you go to the meetings and
[1:04:07] man it's like soon as you start here
[1:04:11] people you could feel it in the in the
[1:04:14] other term you could just feel it and
[1:04:16] why when the music the music stop
[1:04:19] playing man I can't even contain myself
[1:04:23] they clear homes at the park no they
[1:04:26] stop loving it big time it didn't I
[1:04:30] taken it in a song he says now we're
[1:04:32] gonna keep you staying home now
[1:04:35] hey man man you know you you got a
[1:04:39] publican pious and all be that alone oh
[1:04:42] no I ain't gonna come to proof that
[1:04:47] that's the way that give me that all
[1:04:50] time cup see see see see see
[1:04:55] y'all have been with me y'all suppose
[1:04:57] that been with me huh glory to God that
[1:05:04] Achilles I'll be keep moving I I take a
[1:05:07] side ball you in a minute
[1:05:09] I you know I'm an inspirational preacher
[1:05:14] I just go where he lead me where he
[1:05:17] leads me that's where I'll go but he
[1:05:19] says now the Gospels not all again
[1:05:21] little world so this is the word I'm
[1:05:25] going to believe that and all things
[1:05:28] must be based upon the word if it isn't
[1:05:31] it isn't true right no matter what you
[1:05:37] know no matter how much we come here if
[1:05:40] we don't have a word based to what we
[1:05:44] believe it don't mean nothing right
[1:05:48] y'all don't quit on me right see so
[1:05:54] that's why it's important that when
[1:05:56] brother Jack is preaching bastard on the
[1:05:59] right that stepped out you go back and
[1:06:01] study it yourself you prayer with those
[1:06:03] different things you just don't want to
[1:06:04] take for granted you know that you're
[1:06:08] part of something that that meant not be
[1:06:10] true hmm but if you if you could find it
[1:06:16] in the Word of God if you could find it
[1:06:20] in the Word of God you know you got
[1:06:24] yourself something right you know you've
[1:06:27] got yourself something and like I was
[1:06:29] saying I think that that that was a part
[1:06:32] of what the Ministry of Malakoff war was
[1:06:35] all about the turning of the heart was
[1:06:38] to get us away from the traditions right
[1:06:43] and denominationalism which you cannot
[1:06:47] base on the word
[1:06:50] right you cannot tie denominationalism
[1:06:55] back to the word come on you cannot do
[1:07:00] it right
[1:07:03] god never started a denomination man
[1:07:08] every denomination was started by man if
[1:07:12] you go back to the book of Acts uh they
[1:07:16] were just given the name of Christians
[1:07:19] right after the people in that
[1:07:23] surrounding saw the life of Christ on
[1:07:27] display right amen but it wasn't low
[1:07:33] denomination it was no Baptists no
[1:07:36] method is no perfect Aryan no this
[1:07:38] though that God never started that right
[1:07:42] amen
[1:07:44] God just established word abiding
[1:07:48] believers he established a church based
[1:07:51] upon the principles of the word what he
[1:07:54] had given to them right amen
[1:07:58] but denominationalism he never spied see
[1:08:03] and so this is this is why we needed a
[1:08:08] seer to help us to see the era not the
[1:08:15] really dis Christian Isis but to show us
[1:08:18] if we're true believers will come to the
[1:08:21] world as we see that the light will walk
[1:08:25] therein see amen
[1:08:29] but it wasn't that he was trying to
[1:08:31] dismiss Christian either but to give us
[1:08:35] a basis for what we say we believe right
[1:08:41] amen
[1:08:42] you go here why hmm
[1:08:47] you over here why huh God is feeding me
[1:08:52] okay show me and it can't be emotion
[1:08:57] right it's got they stood on the Word of
[1:09:00] God John leading
[1:09:02] hmm right cuz all things I just read it
[1:09:06] has got to be based upon the Word of God
[1:09:09] yo stands what you believe why you go to
[1:09:12] a certain place why you do certain
[1:09:16] things why you act the way that you a
[1:09:18] right you gotta be able to base it upon
[1:09:21] the scripture what I hope I get the way
[1:09:24] I want to go you got to be you got to be
[1:09:29] able to base it upon the scripture now
[1:09:31] you talk to me I can base my what I
[1:09:33] believe in wife and write on the Word of
[1:09:36] God I don't have no problems with that
[1:09:39] but see we don't want you to have any
[1:09:42] problems with that because we're no
[1:09:46] different than any of the age right when
[1:09:50] when Paul and Peter preached they said
[1:09:53] you know Grievous wolves would raise up
[1:09:56] you you would have these false anointed
[1:10:00] ones and things of that nature that will
[1:10:02] rise up and influence right influence
[1:10:09] not the true believer because the true
[1:10:13] believers has basis stand upon the word
[1:10:16] and what he believes on the Word of God
[1:10:19] right it can't just be intellectual
[1:10:23] conception hmm well I believe in Jesus
[1:10:29] why the devil do too in trouble well
[1:10:36] praise the Lord I'm trying to letter
[1:10:38] killeth but the spear to give it a life
[1:10:40] in that man I tell you what after the
[1:10:42] day you just get to give you something
[1:10:45] to think about right that's that's just
[1:10:49] beyond just a sermon and just preaching
[1:10:53] because we've had that long enough just
[1:10:57] that nut road that we need that right
[1:11:00] but I'm trying to take us somewhere
[1:11:02] right to help us when we come to church
[1:11:07] and and and we we hear sermons we hear
[1:11:11] scriptural principles that's being
[1:11:14] related to
[1:11:17] we have to have another mindset right
[1:11:22] but I'm still working I think y'all
[1:11:26] gonna work me good today all right but
[1:11:32] he says but Jesus says go into the world
[1:11:34] and preach the gospel to every creature
[1:11:36] and I didn't say peach
[1:11:40] he did say teach in one place but what
[1:11:43] he's actually alluding to is to
[1:11:45] demonstrate right because because we I
[1:11:50] think what we've done we've placed so
[1:11:53] much emphasis on a great sermon and why
[1:11:59] wasn't that deep but not realizing
[1:12:02] that's not the full thing right see and
[1:12:09] see Paul says he says I didn't come to
[1:12:13] you our excellent lead of speech right
[1:12:18] because Paul realized the full gospel
[1:12:22] and only exists when it it's the word
[1:12:28] and the manifestation of the world one
[1:12:34] can't our one doesn't work to the
[1:12:38] exclusion of the other
[1:12:42] right amen but one is is what is in
[1:12:47] completely they work as they come
[1:12:50] together right but the word in the
[1:12:55] manifestation of the word they work as
[1:12:58] they come together and see I think we've
[1:13:02] been so carried away and and and and we
[1:13:06] so become so ritualistic that man I was
[1:13:11] deep and he was shallow and he was des
[1:13:14] and he ain't that and we're missing the
[1:13:18] God and this is why people eyes are
[1:13:22] wrecked up because we when we come to
[1:13:26] church we don't really realize sometimes
[1:13:28] what
[1:13:29] what we were supposed to be looking for
[1:13:32] when we come right in so it's good to
[1:13:37] hear sermon
[1:13:38] he's supposed to come to hear a sermon I
[1:13:42] made I made a reference I was using the
[1:13:45] statement the Prophet make and he was
[1:13:48] talking about we come to church to find
[1:13:50] out our faults we come to church to find
[1:13:52] out our faults and you know we was
[1:13:55] having a little study and somebody
[1:13:56] raised their hand say fellas fine that's
[1:14:00] confusion I understand my fault not
[1:14:06] fully it couldn't tell you something
[1:14:10] sure y'all fully know y'all you said
[1:14:14] what how can that be God knows you
[1:14:16] better than you know yourself huh God
[1:14:21] can take you deeper deeper to your
[1:14:27] understanding of yourself right because
[1:14:32] we have you know sometimes issues and
[1:14:34] things that we go through God can take
[1:14:38] you so deep and really open that thing
[1:14:41] up to you is such a way under the
[1:14:43] inspiration of the Holy Spirit to set
[1:14:46] you free
[1:14:50] well I know Lee and I this and I did you
[1:14:55] do for God knows you better than you
[1:14:57] know yourself how many believe that God
[1:15:00] knows the very intimate details right
[1:15:05] and God also knows how to set you free
[1:15:07] from the things a man that's got folk
[1:15:10] down do y'all believe that that I
[1:15:14] believe that so so when we say well we
[1:15:18] come to church to to find out our faults
[1:15:22] I believe that because because God you
[1:15:27] know I take for instance there was a
[1:15:29] time where the prophet of God was
[1:15:32] working with a lady who had a nervous
[1:15:34] condition right and went to doctors and
[1:15:39] didn't realize what you know how she
[1:15:42] to be in this condition right she knows
[1:15:47] she had a problem but it took God to
[1:15:51] come down on the scene and said you know
[1:15:53] what you nervous because the dog got
[1:15:55] actually when you was young y'all ought
[1:15:58] to talk to me something just that simple
[1:16:02] adult chase you when you were young you
[1:16:05] running from a dog calls you to be
[1:16:07] nervous as an adult huh
[1:16:11] she couldn't go deep enough to find the
[1:16:14] calls for God could and expose it in
[1:16:19] order to set us free he set me free set
[1:16:23] me free
[1:16:24] God can go deeper than we can in our
[1:16:28] intellectual conception of quick eyes
[1:16:30] individuals right Oh glory to his name I
[1:16:35] hope y'all are right this morning y'all
[1:16:37] just play with them but i'ma go as far
[1:16:40] as I can give me about 20 minutes and
[1:16:42] I'm let's go this morning but but we're
[1:16:45] talking about the letter killeth right
[1:16:47] and see uh the gospel is not all
[1:16:52] together the word now hold of your
[1:16:55] thoughts right amen see look we were
[1:16:59] just saying so the gospel could system
[1:17:02] more then teaching the word Wow
[1:17:07] it's more to it than that
[1:17:09] yes it's mo to ingest teaching the
[1:17:14] workbook right for Paul confirming says
[1:17:19] that gospel came not to us not in word
[1:17:22] only right not in I think sometimes
[1:17:27] people come to church too just to hear a
[1:17:29] sermon in Gwaltney I write with just
[1:17:33] discernment but right there all right
[1:17:35] for just discernment see the sermon has
[1:17:39] got to become a reality and if the sum
[1:17:45] is don't become a reality then God is
[1:17:48] not God and it's not the gospel
[1:17:51] it is fullness cut right
[1:17:56] the gospel is not in word only see and
[1:18:02] in it and if we don't if we don't have
[1:18:05] our minds altered then we gonna be in
[1:18:09] trouble right cuz we'll come in here
[1:18:13] sermon and go alright go right out
[1:18:15] brother Jack please preach a wonderful
[1:18:18] sermon he started a motion making things
[1:18:21] so I can have y'all shouting in the next
[1:18:23] 5 minute right

[1:18:29] humanistic part of humanity but I ain't

[1:24:15] raise them a certain way in there but a
[1:24:18] real father standing the gap for seeing
[1:24:21] real you know what a real father knows
[1:24:24] where he's based is
[1:24:26] in C he's been given a promise right a
[1:24:31] man and see this is why the gospel is
[1:24:35] not in just word only but in in
[1:24:38] demonstration in power right you got
[1:24:42] somewhere to base Sitapur
[1:24:44] yeah they doing this but but the wife
[1:24:48] says and that that's why I'm standing in
[1:24:54] I'm standing with the word save I got a
[1:24:56] promise from the children huh well I say
[1:25:03] what
[1:25:04] well we just got a good word today but
[1:25:08] did you really get a good word today
[1:25:10] I just see it something all right
[1:25:15] you could get a good word today and
[1:25:17] leave out of here you ain't really got
[1:25:19] nothin cuz you heard it but you didn't
[1:25:22] hear it y'all don't believe that you can
[1:25:27] hear it and not hear it right because
[1:25:32] you know you don't get the results see I
[1:25:34] want the results right I want the
[1:25:38] results from the sermon if I don't get
[1:25:42] the result from the sermon then it's not
[1:25:44] the gospel because they work as they
[1:25:48] come together see but the I think I
[1:25:53] think we watch this he says in order to
[1:25:56] preach the gospel before you can make it
[1:25:58] the gospel preach then you've got to
[1:26:00] have the power and demonstration of the
[1:26:03] Holy Ghost to prove the gospel Wow see
[1:26:08] I'm gonna keep going he's had a fella
[1:26:11] killer thing in the spirit make it to
[1:26:13] life so it's just not a ritualistic
[1:26:17] affair and and I'm kind of convinced
[1:26:20] that we've made this thing a ritualistic
[1:26:23] of half hmm we've got our low rituals
[1:26:29] howl things that we do yeah y'all don't
[1:26:35] quit on me now
[1:26:37] we we got this little ritual
[1:26:40] everything's just ritual right we come
[1:26:44] to church we sit in off the same seat I
[1:26:47] paint little areas huh everything about
[1:26:52] it you know we come up and we sing songs
[1:26:54] and and and 30 minutes I know you got to
[1:26:58] have order but I'm just saying how we
[1:27:01] could make this thing ritualistic and
[1:27:05] not inspiring well I got to sing I got
[1:27:09] to sing - 30 minutes and then I gotta
[1:27:12] bring the preacher huh well what if God
[1:27:18] want to come 40 minutes
[1:27:22] cook custom eater don't bring me up an
[1:27:25] OD atmosphere if you take 45 minutes
[1:27:31] sang another tip I'd be sometimes even
[1:27:34] at home I'd be like love somebody gets
[1:27:37] up out of night to do something you know
[1:27:41] so that when I walk up there I can walk
[1:27:43] up in an atmosphere but you know
[1:27:46] sometimes it's like we've made it so
[1:27:49] ritualistic it's like time to make the
[1:27:52] doughnuts we got how we come to church
[1:27:57] time to make the doughnuts
[1:27:59] we like brother Jack I'm here is the
[1:28:03] Lord hallelujah so you have to wonder
[1:28:05] man come on man you need to go back out
[1:28:08] to do hmm
[1:28:11] huh with people y'all don't believe that
[1:28:15] we can make church corner ritualistic
[1:28:18] affair where's in Sunday's by the
[1:28:23] ritualistic we know we don't have this
[1:28:25] ritualistic with with no real sign no
[1:28:29] real joy no real conviction no real
[1:28:33] attention ritual time to make the donuts
[1:28:38] I've been behind you know how people in
[1:28:40] BA been working on this job for 20 year

[1:28:52] principal last week at our family family
[1:28:56] reunion thing they had a white family
[1:28:58] and uh she was saying that you know she
[1:29:01] was a principal and she was 30 minutes
[1:29:05] cry before she got to go to work in 30
[1:29:07] minutes cry on the way home I said
[1:29:11] that's bad
[1:29:13] what you got to stop and cry for 30
[1:29:16] minutes ho you walk in the building this
[1:29:21] is and then on your way home you got to
[1:29:23] stop fighting minutes to get it out
[1:29:26] that's right you know lost all the joy
[1:29:31] the joy of it see that's got to be a
[1:29:35] giant coming to church see if it get
[1:29:40] ritualistic you're gonna start dreading
[1:29:43] coming to spirit through tabernacle you

[1:30:25] so carefree and ritualistic and and it
[1:30:29] don't mean anything and then when

[1:44:04] devil is trying to white people out and
[1:44:08] people don't understand that people they
[1:44:12] see your emotions and everything and not
[1:44:14] realizing you want
[1:44:16] Amen on their behalf cuz you see what
[1:44:22] the enemy is trying to doing sometimes
[1:44:24] they think you know we think that a
[1:44:26] pastor somebody that's supposed to be
[1:44:28] some passive is somebody that just go
[1:44:31] let us do what we want to do in that
[1:44:34] whole prayer car that ain't no pass
[1:44:36] tonight oh man they love you oh man I
[1:44:40] really love you you saying go go that

[1:44:47] in the street and get struck down by a
[1:44:49] cop telling love me come on we don't got
[1:44:53] it jacked up in this hour but a real man
[1:44:57] of God was standing behind the pulpit if
[1:44:59] it has hot up and preach you to
[1:45:02] unsearchable riches of Jesus Christ
[1:45:08] that's what that's a real man but the
[1:45:12] real Full Gospel is not a word only but
[1:45:16] his demonstration in power where when
[1:45:21] the word is preached watching God I'm a
[1:45:27] closed watching God come behind that and
[1:45:31] confirm his word making making that
[1:45:35] preach word a living reality that's the
[1:45:40] gospel not I don't give me the sermon
[1:45:44] but after the sermon I want to see God
[1:45:48] if in the family says he'll have a
[1:45:51] church without spot or wrinkle or any
[1:45:54] such thing I want to be identified with
[1:45:57] that and I want to see that come to pass
[1:46:00] if it don't it ain't the gospel if God
[1:46:04] says Amen that ah he's a healer if I
[1:46:09] could said I want to see God come on the
[1:46:12] scene and confirm his word make that a
[1:46:14] living reality if not this not the Full
[1:46:19] Gospel right if God has spoken
[1:46:23] concerning a body change in a rapture
[1:46:26] and he don't do it he ain't God
[1:46:30] he's like God huh
[1:46:34] but I've got it sadi and he said it he's
[1:46:39] got to be true to his word he it's got
[1:46:43] to be a living reality God the
[1:46:47] supernatural power of God coming on the
[1:46:52] scene see we've we've made it we've made
[1:46:55] it intellectual right and this is why
[1:46:59] people aren't getting control II
[1:47:00] converted huh because we've made the
[1:47:05] Gospel intellectual hmm and used to go
[1:47:10] back and study that the history of
[1:47:13] revivals when the Pentecostal revival
[1:47:16] started amen in 1906 back at Azusa
[1:47:20] Street man people were a man getting
[1:47:23] truly sane transform change free the
[1:47:31] revival has not stopped huh I'm in a
[1:47:37] revival and see my expectation in your
[1:47:43] expectation should be seeing people walk
[1:47:47] through those doors and be changed you
[1:47:51] witness for somebody you washed up the
[1:47:55] power of influence right your human
[1:47:59] testimony you'll miss your middle life
[1:48:03] because you're Ricky Pistols reading on
[1:48:06] it of all men p-people watch a little
[1:48:10] like weaving her sermons huh we're
[1:48:14] homeless
[1:48:16] but we want to see the effects if we're
[1:48:21] not seeing the effects of the surgeons
[1:48:22] we need to stop preaching huh cuz it's
[1:48:26] because all we got is didn't matter
[1:48:28] right and people are dying for every
[1:48:35] sermon we should be under expectation
[1:48:40] if within a sermon the things that we
[1:48:44] graph the promises has been spoken we
[1:48:47] should be under expectations for the
[1:48:50] manifestation of the sermons the
[1:48:53] supernatural power of God moving in to
[1:48:56] confirm his word because he says where I
[1:48:59] won't return to avoid but then in
[1:49:02] accomplish not just an editor letter
[1:49:05] killeth see the letter kill it but amen
[1:49:13] but the Spirit we want the Spirit of God
[1:49:16] moving in on the work to confirm the
[1:49:18] word if not we just got dead ritualistic
[1:49:22] sermons and no changes no changes in the
[1:49:29] life let me tell you something search
[1:49:31] you just come here all you want to and
[1:49:33] if God's not changing your life you are
