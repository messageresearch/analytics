lie he is a liar and we just condemned all of his tactics a man every every every every every everything that he designs we can't so a man just believed God from total them let's just pray father we come on behalf of our precious system the enemy has come to attack earth right here in this place and as believers we we know that we've been told that if we buy the script to say whatever we bind on earth shall be bound in heaven so whatever this condition is we might not know the name of it but whatever it is we find it now in the name of Jesus Christ and we loose your healing power to flow from the crown of a head to the soles of her feet and that she would be able to enjoy the remainder of this service you're the same God that touched Peters mother-in-law she was down with the flu in and got when you touched her you went into the house and touched her within the self-same hour she's back up doing the things that she normally did so Satan we come against you amen Lee and as a with the authority of sons and daughters of God we come against you and whatever attack this is we come against it in the name of the Lord Jesus and we declare her freedom even right now in Jesus name we pray amen amen [Music] hail and praise the Lord but we're just so grateful a man to God Amen on today for all that he's doing in our midst we just appreciate a man his spirit and I thank God for a precious brother and sister from Vancouver a man good to have you visited they've been with us on today a man always a blessing and we just just a quick a couple of things I need to take care of before we actually go into the word of the Lord on Friday night a couple of things happen for those that weren't here a man we just want to bring you up to speed but we had our annual a church feeding on Friday night and there were some things that were voted on that we want all the members to be aware of one of them Amen that we voted on was we voted on brother Troy becoming a deacon a man in our church and praise the Lord thank the Lord there was believe about 26 votes and 23 of them 26 voted for him to become Deaconess is what the church decided the other were either you know lower just no vote at all but about 23 of the 26 which shows that it was a tremendous majority Amen that that it wanted that so we want to a man acknowledge that but we want to do things according to the scripture and I want to just turn your Bibles to the first Timothy chapter 3 a man I mentioned on on Friday night that we would just pray over him today but what we'll do is there's something here in Scripture that we need to do and we want to follow that first Timothy three says verse eight says likewise must the Deacons be grave not double tongue not given to much wine not greedy and filthy lucre now holding the mystery of the faith and a pure conscience and let these also first be proved alright so this is what the scripture tells us that they have to be proved my brother Troy has been a deacon and a couple other churches before the Lord called him to be a part of this ministry and we know that he served in that capacity but just based on Scripture based on some of the things that the Prophet teach what we want to do this is a new congregation a man that he's becoming deacon apart began to be a deacon and so we want to make sure we go through the process of proving and proving time is where he gets a chance to kind of know the people the people get a chance to know him and and then there comes a time where we kind of take him off for that where the church has the opportunity to vote on that but but we've entered into that phase of him proving himself as a deacon here spirit and truth tabernacle and we're doing that a man as of today just letting everybody know let these also first be proved let then let them use the office of a deacon being found blameless even so must their wives be grave not slanderers sober faithful all things that the deacon be the husband of one wife ruling their children in their own house as well for they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves at that degree and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus so again what we voted on and what the church voted on was to have brother Troy began to Amen serve here at spirit of truth Tabernacle was certainly happy amen to have him amen in that capacity he'll be going through a time of proving a manner that will bring it back around to the church to vote once the proving has has completed but as of today he'll certainly be acting Amen in that capacity Amen a deacon based on what the church's vote was from Friday night so I just want everybody to understand that and we understand that the deacon is a police village church one of the most strict offices in the church so if brother Troy is asking you know you to do something he's been given the authority by the church to ask you to do that so Amen we we certainly so grateful for that we had brother for the Robles here and and the Lord I put it in brother Oh blessed heart to relocate back to Dominican Republic and and as God was taking brother Robles out God was bringing you no other help in and we're so grateful for what the Lord has done so we just we just appreciate we appreciate that and we want you all to certainly be cooperative Amen with our precious brother a man also there was one other thing that was voted on and we need to just talk about that really quick we will prepare for offering a manna extra the Solomon not to do the offering I wanted to do that today itself on the on the table out there we have a couple of things we have this pledge forms and and then we also have this letter and that's on the table as you're going out one of the things that was voted on on Friday night we just kind of took the church through our financial picture showed them you know the money that's coming in the money is going out certainly grateful that God has allowed us to stay establish this ministry for another year and we're always happy every time God opens doors and makes ways for us we're happy for that but we just kind of cast vision that we we need to start making preparation to move into our own space not just keep renting you know year after year and all the money that we pay in rent but we want to move into our own space and be able to own it you know ourselves so we're moving into about 16 years of ministry now and we want to start making preparation for for something else so we voted on a one-year plan a three-year plan or a five-year plan and contributing you know towards our building fun we've talked about time and we talked about offering three levels of giving tithing offering and then building funds and and we got a we made a we voted on building fund and how much we said 35 people giving so much money a man over one year period three year period a five year period what you know we show what the numbers would be I think if if if 35 people I don't have my my notes here but I think it was a if we were trying to raise $300,000 and 35 people gave $8,600 one time we would you know be over at about three hundred and one thousand I believe then we had a three year plan if you gave three thousand dollars per year for the next three years we have about three hundred and fifteen thousand of the same thirty-five people committed to three thousand dollars per year for the next three years then we had a five-year plan if thirty-five people commit to seventeen hundred and fifty dollars per year for the next five years then we would raise roughly three hundred and six thousand or something like that so we put that to a vote we had four people that wanted to do the $8,600 one time we had nine people that was a one-year plan for what four people voted for that nine people voted for the five-year plan and thirteen people voted for the three-year plan so the thirteen a man says thirteen you know more we have more people voting for that we greed as a church to enter into a three-year plan pledging $33,000 per year amen in order to move us towards ownership to give us money to put down and things of that nature so that is something that uh that we voted for and when I asked a man all the members to do just take one of these forms you'll have that on the outside I mean just there on the table make sure you take one of these forms sign your name to the pledge and now there might be some that say you know pastor I know we voted for that but I don't have that what I'm asking you to do is just make a commitment on everybody to be a part of this I know God gonna make a way I know God gonna do some things that we just never imagined but I think we all have to be a part of it somehow someway and you know the scripture says I put a script in there Isaiah 54 and - it says enlarge the place of that tent and let them stretch forth the curtains of their habitation spare not lengthen my cords and strengthen our states and and as we're moving into this season it will be a task it would be a challenge amen you know on us to give but I know that there's a blessing on the other side of the giving a man so I'm asking everyone somehow find a way just to get involved in this I know for sure we got 13 that say they want to give $3,000 right and we and those that wanted to give you know just one year if you I mean really what it ends up 3,000 dollars per year for three years equals a $9,000 pledge so if you want to say I want to give my 9,000 right now you can do that right now right that's totally that's totally after you but we want everybody to try to meet what the church voted on but if you can't do that please just do the best you can but make sure it's stretching yeah but don't take your bill money now don't take your bill money and do that these are things that uh you know you have to start praying acts and God just to bless you to be able to be able to do that and I'm sure he'll make a way man if you desire to do that so we're asking everyone all the members of the church to do that now that's that's one side this is the the church form a man for the members of the church but you know I didn't know that the vote would actually happen and go that way where everybody would do the three-year plan but I written this letter before the meeting a man and this is a letter you'll have it you can take some and just give it out to different people but on the letter as you would read it you'll see that the Lord put in my spirit just to ask people to join us with a three thousand dollar pledge towards our building fund and I had no idea that that was gonna be the one selected so I believe God was vindicating a man that that's what he wanted us to do and so these forms are just for friends and family people that you think a man that would be able to just help us raise the money that we want to raise in order to move towards on the ship so please take some and when we run out we'll put some more out there but try to find that but but the other thing is don't don't take this and find a bunch of people to give but you yourself don't give don't do it that way you have to be a part of this aid man I believe that's where you're gonna get your blessing when you actually enter in so some of you have your forms a man today and we want to actually the brothers that come we're gonna take this morning times and often if you do just fold your form up put it inside the offering and then those that did not get it just make sure you get one a man before you leave today and and put that amen either in the offering or in the basket there it's a man praising one let's just pray over this man before we before we partake of the offering father we are just coming in the name of Jesus thank you Lord for the church coming together in and God just voting on on how we want to move towards ownership the Lord I know it'll be a stretch for many of us but God I know that if you've placed us for force and somehow you'll make a way you open up doors that we can't see and you'll provide you are Jehovah Jireh we've seen you do it many times before so we know that you're capable of doing it all over again my prayer is that everyone that would take the forms and that they would sign them God my prayer is that you would open doors to it make ways for them to fulfill the pledge that they have Lord used us for your glory use this for your honor we trust lorda to return back to the people a hundredfold as they give from their hearts today Jesus name we pray amen the brothers will amen take today's Tassin offering [Music] works in ways we cannot see he will make a way for me he will be my kind draw me closely to him strength for each new day he will make a way he will make way God will make a way where there seems to be no way works and ways we cannot see he will make way for me and he will be my god draw me closely to his side the love and strength for each new day he will make way he will make away God will God with God will come on stick it again oho God will make a way where there seems to be no way he works in ways we cannot see me remain for me and he will be my guide try me closely to his son love and strength for each new day he will make way he will make her way come on give the Lord a hand the place I know he'll make a way man I read this on Friday night and I just wanted to read it over the church I should have did this at the first of the year but since we're still in the first month I read this over you this was something the Prophet said in Revelation chapter 4 just 1966 so so Harmon is glad and happy the Lord spared you through another year and then here we are coming up to the end of the road and pray that God will forgive us of all of our sins and our shortcomings now I want to say this before I start I wish to each one of you all the most successful and bless full and healthy New Year's that I can wish to you god be with you may you grow both physically and spiritually financially and materially everything that God can bring upon you I pray that he'll do it a man so as we prepare to enter into this we're asking God's blessings upon each and every one that got what bless you in such a way that you've never even imagined and and I pray that you'll receive that I saw some of y'all received that last year and I saw God do more for you last year than ever been done before but he's giving a ticket to another level and I believe that with all my heart so god bless your church thank you so much amen for all you have done to make spirit of truth what it is and we look forward to what God has for us amen in the future thank you musicians god bless you thank you so much appreciate you all freeze the Lord I heard the specials that we're done and I'm certainly appreciative for that too so god bless you all a man for all and thank God for brother Solomon devil attacked them but he didn't give the devil no credit a man he got right on up impressed right through what he was going through appreciate you brother Solomon may God bless you a man blessed be the name of the Lord amen if we could just stand to our feet we'll read a scripture here and we will enter into our thought for today a man to praise the name of the Lord I want to turn to the book of James again we were here last week and we want to just go forward in our thought unwanted circumstances a man unwanted circumstances so here in James amen James chapter 1 verse 2 this is my brother encountered all joy when you fall into divers temptations just many tests and trials and my god and and and if I were completely honest after preaching the sermon last week man we failed in too many tests and trials but the Bible tells us to count it all joy just keep smiling right just keep smiling don't even don't even pay it no tension just just keep smiling right so my brother encountered all joy when you fall into into divers temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have a perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing if interview lack wisdom let him ask of God that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not and it shall be given him but let him ask in faith nothing wavering for he that waiteth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed you're not gonna make it very far if you're wavering and God right you have to be establish fixed establish for permanency right it says for for let not that man think that he should receive anything of the Lord a double minded man is unstable in all his ways a man let's just pray over the word of the Lord father we thank you for the ability to read the Word of God but we pray the Holy Spirit would make things clear to us today as we begin to and enter into this though I bless every heart that will hear the word of God and and I've caught father may we just draw closer to you through your word is in Jesus name we pray amen god bless you could be seated amen so again our our title today is unwarranted circumstances unwarranted circumstances I would like to just kind of start with a quote here at the mighty Conqueror you know in everybody everybody's life you have these what we call unwanted circumstances there are things that happen to you and notice the title says circumstance tense not circumstance right because you'll go from one trial to the next trial a man you go from one distress to the next distress but in the midst of that God is actually strengthening you God is goddess goddess preparing you actually for the next thing that you're about to face a man is it's bringing you to a place of perfection in him glory to God so we don't we don't run from our trials it's like David David didn't run from Goliath he actually went to face Goliath a man so whatever whatever situation is actually coming your way understand the first thing that you need to understand is God will never give you more than you can bear a man he'll never put more on you than you can bear so you have to you have to face it with joy and and I love the way James puts that because brother branham even tells us the right mental attitude right towards any divine promise will bring the thing to pass so before you even get started a trial you gotta have the right attitude in the midst of it glory to God don't I mean when you're going through nobody should be able to know Amen now some things people it's just gotta be known like if you lose a loved one or something like that those things are gonna be known and people understand that but but there's other little things they man that happened in our life nobody should be able to tell that you had a bad day on the job come on church right even if you lost your job the Bible say bless the Lord at all times right even if you lost your job you got to learn how to praise God in the midst of losing your job thanking him for the next job that is get rid or take you into a mess but don't come to church with a sad face you know you cannot come into the presence of a king with the sad face did you know that was Scripture right Amen I'm here mind if they could not go into the presence of the king with a sad countenance and when you coming into the presence of the King of Kings you can't have that sad countenance you change the atmosphere within the kingdom when you come like that so you gotta come with joy and see joy is different from happiness happiness occurs because something happened but joy is there when nothing happens I got joy in the good times I got joy in the bad time I got joy at all times that's the way you act when you a question when you got a revelation of who you are in Christ amen come on church lorry to God I was blessed you know this week we had that I heard brother solomon sharing testimony but we had that the brothers text going back and forth an brothers brother Silas sent out you know the devil tacking me with laryngitis or something like that and within about five minutes the brothers had done bronchitis that the bronchi landed within about five minutes the Devils on the run right I mean you know them brother the brothers fight back with encouraging words and all kind of things like that brother next thing you know brother some say I'm healed in Jesus name the whole thing changed just like that when you're going through is your attitude in the midst of it you know there's some you know some people when they're going through and they they let people know they want the pity party you enjoy a pity party you I mean people enjoy just talking about negative stuff they enjoy that right but but you got to be a personal no no I don't want to be around nobody's gonna talk negative because you know that that type of stuff is contagious right you need somebody's gonna talk to work gonna talk faith a man sometimes gonna help elevate you not bring you down praise the Lord so we're talking about this I'm one of circumstances we all have them a man we all we all have them I was you know before I hit this this quote if every parent in here a man with with children you have experienced a man laboring over the stove a man preparing a really nice meal and you know and modest the best broccoli you ever cooked in all your life hallelujah and and you know you lay that down on the plate and you know and I mean you just eaten and you just enjoying it but all of sudden that kid look at something green on the plate and and they they begin to frown up they begin to look a little different you know at that and and and and those those words that come out of their mouth that just hurt every parent is and after you done did everything you could to feed them and you get I don't want it right when you hear that I don't want it a man that that's the kid is saying that they've great they got something on their plate that's unwanted it's an unwanted circumstance with them I'll take the fries right and I'll take all the stuff that's bad for me but but that green stuff I don't want it it's unwanted to them right amen but but the green stuff is what's really good for them and sometimes in life we get some some green stuff some trials and tribulations some distress it but that's the good stuff for you you can't tell the Lord I don't want that no that's good for you see the Prophet talked about you know his his his his mama giving him castor oil you know y'all remember that and say you know he would get that that caste or and say he say you know it was just it was just so hard to take that he say he want he wanted to tell Mama's just gonna make me it's gonna make me gag mama I can't take that it then he say the Castro actually make me sick when I take the castor oil I get worse mama but if I'm gonna say anything that don't make you sick it won't do you no good [Music] hallelujah so anything sometimes your trials come and they make you sick but when you get sick it calls you to pray a little bit more it make you want to come to church and hear the word of God that's what happened when you get sick but Amen I want you to get sin sick Halloween or somebody Amen and God uses our trials to try you to a place where you'll serve him think man we just love the Lord so your trial you're looking at just you know remember as we mentioned last week you looking at it Amen that's that's just angry clouds but it's not angry Klaus it's angel's wings beating together it's not angry clouds this angel's wings that are beating together now look at this of what the Prophet said in the mighty Conqueror it says this and after Constantine come over and liberated them from under the Roman persecution and United the church and state together there's where we got Catholic to begin with and we and when they did the church lost more grounds in 10 years then it had gained all through the persecution he says if there is anything that makes Christians lazy it's when they're on a flowery flowered bed of ease you all know when people start giving up and quitting church when they get some money in their pocket when they get it when they you know you know my we couldn't we they was calling everybody trying to get the church when they didn't have a ride but as soon as God with a car they forgot about coming to church if there's anything that makes a Christian lazy it's when they're on a flowered bed of ease listen we don't have it persecution enough now your brother said now I'm going through enough as it is they say you don't even have it bad enough yet vodka say we don't we don't have it persecution of we don't have that hard enough always at the chain is the strongest at its weakest link he says that a man under pressure is what he is when he's under pressure so oftentimes you go through these trials God putting you under pressure we've seen what you really made a man I'm too precious what he is under pressure his real true characteristics will show when he some depression get him all riled up then you'll see the real man come out if he's got a temper it'll show itself if he's meek and gentle it'll show itself put him under pressure once and God puts all his children I like that statement not just some of his children I need you to understand if you not going through anything right now give it a little time you will be going through something see every son that comes to God must be tried glory to God don't run from the trials a man listened said God puts all the student under test to see whether they're there any flaws in them and I just want to say I want to say this don't run from you no distress I know you know sometimes people people tell others when they um you know they want to think about being a Christian man it's not it's not easy being a Christian it's not easy it's gonna be hard and you know and they hear that me thinking a lot if it's gonna be hard you know maybe I'll just stay where I'm at no no no you misunderstand it you mistime stem it's hard for everybody listen even without Christ people have frowns without price they have trials you know but I rather face but I'm facing with Christ then without Christ because at the end of it all even if I have to face death I want to face death with Christ not without Christ because I the end of all I'm like I certain promises that lay on the other side of death right so I mean it's gonna be trials no matter what but you know what I choose it I'm I'm going to suffer the affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season praise the Lord Amen but Christians if you want to get lazy be on a flower bed of ease that's why God is gaga grbac gonna answer them kind of fresh they've kind of prayers that sets you up real good and stop you from praying you know what I'm saying the ones that stop you from praying God answering them he got he just give you a little bit out of time get you out of this and then you got to get back on your knees and then he'll get you out of this and then you got to get back on your knees and then he'll get you he's gonna keep hearing you otherwise you'll stop talking to them he got to keep you in church and the way to get you that just a little pressure oh you don't understand when you have the pressure what brother branham Kota is the tender hand of Jehovah it's actually moving you right to where he wanted you all the time the pressure is used to do that so count it all joy all right let's go on here's here's one thing I won't read this out of Exodus 112 just read this with me because the children of Israel were actually put under pressure when they were inside of Israel they're before you know they got that before they reached their point of deliverance amen they were they were placed under pressure Moses had come back in and man when they first heard that Moses was there the children of Israel the Bible say they believed and they just begin to worship because they knew God has sent them a prophet I love that at one time they believed that God sent them a prophet and they worshipped but later on because of some of the unwanted circumstances of the wilderness they start complaining about the Prophet amen don't let your componet your circumstances change your faith hallelujah can I say that again don't let your circumstances change your faith but let your faith change your circumstance hallelujah somebody glory to God but because of the unwanted circumstances of the wilderness their faith changed and they begin to complain against God's prophet but there was a time in Exodus 4 it said that they believed that God sent them a prophet and not only did they believe they begin the worship God and thank God for sending them a prophet but they aren't wanted circumstances is what change what's wait them don't let that be a situation I remember I remember Jeremiah had a circumstance I'm coming to this in a second but Jeremiah because he had testified him because he prophesied one time you know the king said now I'm gonna give you a chance to kind of take that back you say no I can't God told me saying I'm gonna say okay we have to let you down inside this pit and they put him pitting and Jeremiah begin to sink in the muck and the mire he just began and they were starving them to death and just it's just a terrible situation but but before you know it there was a man called Abimelech that come along again and got some old ropes and put them down there and gave it to Jeremiah to lift the life out of that situation and after you come out they say are you gonna change your testimony no I'm gonna keep saying exactly what God told me to say he did not let his trial change his testimony and that's the way you got to be as a Christian don't let whatever you're going through don't let it change your testimony look at what happened with the children of Israel and Exodus 1:12 look at this they were they the Bible says but the more they afflicted them the more they multiplied and grew what I'm trying to get to this is that no matter so so when the devil sends the great trial upon you it's a great blessing on the other side of it the more I am afflicted the more I'm gonna multiply Oh hallelujah the more you attack my finances the more God gonna bless me ha the more you attack my body amen the more health I'm gonna receive amen whatever you do Satan God gonna do more it says but the more they afflicted them the more they multiplied and grew and they were grieved because of the children of Israel but the more they afflicted them amen they were agree because of two misery so I wanted to just get that the more that you afflicted the more you're gonna prosper all those unwanted circumstances just gonna produce a blessing in your life hallelujah III mean some of y'all can look back even now and look at you know just many of the things that you suffered through things that you suffered through church things that you suffered through financially things that you suffered through physically but God has brought you out into a wealthy place that's the way God does us God God does not give us something to make us a man decrease but it's actually to increase oh I'm just I'm just so grateful listen to this amen let's read another quote here this is out of the message of the resurrection of Lazarus the Prophet says this Lazarus took sick theologians believe he died with hemorrhages of the lungs that I don't know that the Bible don't say nothing some of the writer said it was all right he got sick and sometimes God tries your faith do you believe that ever every son that come coming to come up to God must be trying kit not strange that fiery trials come because it's only done to perfect your faith to draw you closer though they're worth more than the than gold to you your trial is worth more than gold to you oh I love that if you got all these people on the side of the road talk about we buy gold but how many would stand out there with the science that we want more trials the trials are actually worth more than gold to you let think about it it says so they're worth more than gold to you alright then when these things begin to take place Mary Martha and said have Jesus coming come come back and pray for him and Jesus just ignored their call he went to another city further away well then they sent again and he still ignored their call sometimes you would go through prayer a man and just believing that the Lord gum just kind of make a wave real quick for you and I hate to say this we just we in this microwave age mentality that we say a prayer and as soon as we say the prayer we want an answer no it's not going to work that where you got the weight on that answer sometimes you got to wait years but as a Christian you got to continue to maintain your testimony in the midst of your waiting look at this just read this scripture out of Luke 23 verse 39 through 43 look at this Luke 23 verse 39 and one of the male factors which were which were hanged railed on him saying if thou be Christ save thyself enough verse 40 Luke 23 but the others but the other answering rebuked him saying does not thou fear God seeing thou art in the same condemnation and we indeed justly for we receive the due reward for our deeds but this man hath done nothing amiss and I want to I want to dwell there for a little bit you know let me just finish read this but I want to come back that statement this man has done nothing to miss first 42 says and he said unto Jesus Lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom and Jesus said in him very last entity today thou shalt be with me in paradise now verse 41 says that we receive the due reward for our deaths but this man have done nothing amiss here this justice this up thief on the cross is actually standing up for the Lord Jesus and he makes a statement saying it didn't do nothing wrong Jesus never did anything wrong but yet he was suffering oh my god I want you to get this you gonna go through some things in life where you actually did nothing wrong but yet you're still suffering now that does not mean that God does not love you right that don't mean that God doesn't love you cut I mean you gotta have the same type of faith that that that charm we knew he's done nothing wrong but yet he was suffering Joe said though he slay me yet will I trust him well I might be going through but I'm not giving up on God I am NOT throwing in the towel I am not quitting I'm still gonna be in church though he slay me yet will I trust him say though the skin words eat up my flesh you say yeah in my flesh I know I shall see God I feel by myself is not another you gotta have a revelation in the midst of your trial of the god that's dwell on the inside that try with you and greater is He that is in you than he that's in the midst of that trial look at this Jesus was rejected of his own he did nothing wrong he did nothing amiss he was rejected of his own he was lying upon by false witnesses he prayed that God was allowed a bitter cup to pass so many of us have been in that same situation when we pray that God to just let this thing pass Jesus was crucified on the capital punishment and died the most cruel death amen with those nails in his hands and in his feet the most cruel death that any person could die and he never did anything wrong but he's also raised on the third day in power and he sits on the right hand of the Father right now you know and and and brother Branham said he got raised so high that he has to look down now this is the very earth that would not receive him not he looking down on that earth right Church I'll tell you what when God uses a man these trials to exalt us don't run from it count it all joy counted all joy hallelujah hallelujah I told you how Joseph went through so much but everything he was going through God was exalting him he couldn't see the exaltations he couldn't see what God had in the end but but God had things prepared for Joseph you got to understand God got something prepared for you so don't don't run from the trial run to the trial listen I was thinking on another person that has some unwanted circumstances in their life Esther man she has some unwanted circumstance I mean just my god she would not that nobody would choose their trials you know we often times a man we see what there's a story that this man you know that this man had a cross that he was carrying and as he was carrying the cross he got the complaint said Lord this cross was just way too big I can't carry this cross Lord I came to it I can't do it so what's it look at tell you what bring your cross and and put it in this room sit but now everybody got to have a cross to bear everybody got got a care across it say okay no problem or but I I just I just can't carry this and say okay no just be put in this room come in and still put in this room and then I want you to walk out the door and then come into this other room and you find yourself across the net I picked up and there it say okay what I'll do it so he looked over say and he saw some huge cross say oh look at that constant man I don't know how anybody can carry that that's right no no no I ain't gonna take that one no they ain't taking that with me that's a pretty good man that's that's pretty bad so he started eating meat across in the corner he say yes Lord I found me a cross and when it got the cross picked it up he said Lord I got one Lord you say we got a care one I got one he said yes and that's the very one you just put down God knows exactly what you can bear hallelujah stop complaining and start praising look at this Esther once one of the unwanted circumstances that she lost both of her parents at a very early age and and and and when something like that happens it's very easy for a person to get themselves in a man just in a spirit of depression right Amen it's very easy to get get down on yourself and why did this happen to me and you get that why me spirit it's the unwanted circumstance that's all it is right you know but God had purpose went went when Esther a man got got lost both her parents then it forced her to be raised by her uncle Mordecai hallelujah now you might you know when I look at that God there might have been certain standards in Mordecai's house that might not have been in her parents house in order to get asked the way he wanted s to the P he had to make a certain way put up under a certain roof to bring certain qualities out of ha oh my god you don't realize that sometimes God does things in your life in order to get the best out of you he does that it's an unwonted circumstance but you gotta know that God is in control he put her in an uncle Mordecai Skinner and you know and I don't know maybe Mordecai was a pretty strict fella and when King a hat service had an unwanted circumstance right it may his I want a circumstance that he wanted his wife Queen Vashti become a man and show her beauty off to all all of his guests and now he was just so proud of his wife right and when he called for that you say I'm coming no way I got my own party going over here ain't coming nowhere and he say uh-huh I'm the King say what we didn't know what to do with vastra so somebody comes in and I look King I'm gonna tell you you got the kind of get rid of her and get yourself another Queen because if everybody sees how - she just did you all the other ladies in the kingdom gonna do the same thing to their husbands they say we're we're gonna have to bring out to take care of this and and this unwanted circumstance in and King a hasret's life created an opportunity it was a blessing in disguise meant for Esther oh my god so here comes after long and you know but but Esther being raised in Mordecai's house he has some very strict standards in how you know maybe she couldn't go out like the other girls come on somebody I got to work with me today no you ain't gonna take that boy you ain't gonna go out run around like the other girl she's gonna stay right here in the house and she knows maybe she thought that man my mama okay just so tight my uncle's so hot come on somebody my father my uncle was preparing ha and she had no idea what she'll be but therefore circumstances produced the Queen I wanted circumstances produced great this here Mordecai maybe he'll and the law down so you know you ain't gonna do this and you can't do that and you can't do this and you can't do that but then when it come time for hasturs to have it I'm one of circumstances that connected and now they looking for a new queen but this Queen had to have certain qualifications that they meant see has she been allowed to run around she might not have met the qualifications but because I um could kept her so tight and then he had that he had the release of one day so now now look mister Enoch is is they they wanna they want to see all the virgins in the land oh my god and night-night now maybe in the land that might not have been that many virgins the Bible don't tell us how many it was right so it might not have been that many virgins but here she come up because of underneath her uncle's care she was kept now she's a virgin and and when they're looking for it they lookin front they looking at a version of land here she comes out this this beautiful young lady and maybe it may be her uncle also had rules that you can't wear makeup you can wear this you can't wear that and you can't do this and he came through that and when she walked out they looked at the mind what what is this and they just like the natural beauty say she beautiful all by herself she don't need no help here after standing there and that I mean a hatchery say III III found my queen I found my replacement to Vashti it might it was an unwonted circumstance but I got somebody look a little bit better but Uncle say also now don't reveal your identity don't tell them who you are don't tell them who your people are just just keep it to yourself and you can just see Esther when you read the book of Esther how she just man man I'm grateful I'm glad that you're not my uncle my uncle did this him you know in heat and I'm glad he raised me the way he raised me and and look at me I'm promoted to queen and you know and look at all this you know but I mean maybe she just kind of just got to get lost in her new position but there was some pressure that came because a man gonna be what he is I'm the pressure see I mean when you get on the pressure that's when your true character gonna begin the show hallelujah somebody and when the pressure came motor casting out now Esther you need to go an out you need to go talk to keep saying that now wait uncle Mordecai you know you're not supposed to go to the king unless you've been called Mordecai say don't forget why you're really in the kingdom Esther don't forget why you then don't forget what God done done for us they don't don't don't you forget about all that yeah you don't made it to certain steps but remember God gave you that status he said maybe maybe maybe maybe your whole purpose not just to be queen but maybe God brought you to the kingdom for such a time as this Esther so y'all pray three days of fasting and praying and after we after we fast and pray I'm gonna go in and I'm gonna see the king and Esther took it upon herself she say if I die if I perish let me perish but I am going in to see this and when she went before a hazard say what do you want you know you whatever you need you can have it he just began to you know invited him to dinner and invite you know hang them to dinner and often say Haman Haman Haman had an unwonted circumstance you know his I don't want a circumstance he hated Mordecai because Mordecai would not battle now how is it that Mordecai would not bow but Mordecai raised a young lady that became queen can you imagine all the dynamics that was going on in more to Kyle's house and maybe understand you not my dad anyway oh come on somebody oh all the pressure but God was actually preparing them something so much green man aw and when you just go back and read the story in how our Haman had that plan I'm one on one that circumstance he was gonna hang his unwanted circumstance because they had the wrong heart the same gallows that he'd built for Mordecai are the same gallows he ended up hanging from be careful when you're digging a ditch for somebody you just might fall in yourself all right thank God that Esther was raised and she was able to spare her people even after she went through all the all the unwanted circumstances when the pressure was actually put on Esther Esther then the revelation came out as to who she really was thank God thank God for that first Peter four and twelve says beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happen unto you think it not strange and I want to just read a quote here from Smyrna in church age glory to God the Prophet tells us says thinking that strange concerning the fiery trials that aren't to try to you that is what Peter said is it is a strange that God wants us to develop a christ-like character that comes through suffering no sir and we all have trials we all are tried and chasing their sons not one but goes through that the church that is not suffering and it's not being tried isn't of God my god the church that is not suffering and it's not being tried isn't of God you're not of God if you're not going through something hallelujah that's why you got a counter off George soon as the devil unleash an attack praise God I was telling somebody this week and I want I remember somebody telling me this people do not throw rocks bottles sticks at trees with no fruit on it so if you get hit with a rock a bottle or a stick is because you producing some fruit come on somebody that's the only reason they throw it because they see fruit you ain't got to be jealous so the fruit just get planted and you will start going glory to God listen Hebrews 12:6 for who the Lord loveth he chases and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth but if he be without chastisement where's our where all our partakers then are you bastards and not sons it goes on to say this aid man says now this special condition of Smyrna must be applied to every age there is no age free from it it says there is no true believer free from it this is of God's this is the will of God it is needful we need the Lord to teach us the truth that we are to suffer I love this we are to suffer and be christ-like in doing it love suffereth long and is kind love suffers long and is kind Matthew 5 verse 11 through 12 says blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you shall say all manner of evil against you falsely see Jesus did nothing amiss so when people do you the same way they did Jesus just know you you must be doing something right when people say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake rejoice and be exceeding glad what a scripture it didn't say it didn't say come to church with a sour look on your face and I'll talk about what you're going through your job I'm told I'm talking I'm talking when evil is just you know just all-around wickedness all around but the Bible say rejoice and be exceeding glad look at that rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you see it's all about the attitude let's go on this is this is one of my favorite cool so I'm going to keep I'm still in that same quote this is one of my favorite quotes where the Prophet says this the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of God's disapproval they hear that the cloudy skies of just right down beneath it the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of God's disapproval neither are bright skies a man neither bright skies and steel waters glory to God signs of his love and approval his approval of any of us is in the beloved his love is elective oh my god which he had for us before the foundation of the world does he love us ah yes but how shall we know we shall know oh you know some of us think some of us think that God's love is proven in our material blessings Oh so you gotta understand that even if even if you don't have material blessings he still loves you he still went to the cross and died listen he says he says but how should we know we shall know because he said so and manifested that he did love us he brought us to himself and gave us of his spirit raising us as sons and how shall I prove my love to him not just with your lip service it says by believing what he said and this is the good part and by conducting myself with joy this is how you prove your love for God by conducting myself with joy mr. trials that he in his wisdom allows to come to pass so that's why I say I'm gonna come I'm a counted all joy and oh now you know I must have some fruit on me they throwing rocks at many throwing bottles that I must have some fruit I must be doing something pretty good if they if they throwing all this at me and let me tell you something if he if God is for you who can be against you it might throw at you they might hit you but you're gonna fall you're gonna keep standing right in the midst of whatever they throw at you hallelujah Oh glory to God how am I gonna prove my love is it's by conducting myself with joy in the middle of my trials Amen I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna prove that I love God Oh hallelujah I just love the Lord search Amen I want it you know there's these unwanted circumstances that happen to us all just I want to read another quote here and then I want to get into Jacob my now this this quote is going to come from the sermon the angel of God and something happened on platform which would have been an unwanted circumstance something was revealed on platform that's that's why I wanted you don't want to be embarrassed in front of everybody but sometimes what that produces is a blessing listen look at this the angel of God the Prophet says this says but on the platform I have to watch I'm just opening up my heart I feel that I'm before friends tonight I have to be careful what I do did you did you know divine gifts could cause you to lose your soul so you have to watch what you do with that with divine gifts my heart goes I look here and see this little water head baby land before me now you don't know how my heart goes out for that baby wish I could see what a wish wish I could see what would take place how I believe to say that little mother there oh Jesus Christ has healed you baby your prayers are answered wish I could say that but I can't till he tells me I have to be careful it says now may be the privilege of giving that person before me maybe there's something causing that well if I get it maybe when standing before the person or this lady sitting here you or interview it might it might see the reason now now you noticed I'm very particular how I rebuked a spirit out there I'm there particular on how our rebuking spirit out there because you have to watch sometimes God use this sickness for chastisement for the people did you know that I wanted circumstance of sickness is used as trust chastisement for the people I'm gonna next week I think I'll hit this but Miriam got sick and it was chastisement for her she developed leprosy because she spoke against God's prophet oh my god now I need to tell you all that when a person developed leprosy there was a particular way that they had to go through to have it cleansed let me also go a little further one of the other things that they had to do was put the person outside to camp I can't preach my sermon next weekend I'm gonna let that go no i'ma let that go that's coming to my sermon next week but let me let me just say this when you recognize leprosy they had to take it to the priests not to psychiatrists not to a doctor it had to go to the priests and there are some people that have a problem with the preacher or the priest being in their business but according to Old Testament scripture you supposed to take it to the priest and the priest is the one that announces or pronounces whether you clean or not clean and if the priest said you were unclean you know I had to happen you had to separate for seven days a week oh god I'm gonna actually how to do something sometimes you get leprosy in they can have it in the forehead you have it in the forehead right right here and the priest would have to examine the forehead and they'd have to see you know or if they got in their head or anywhere just you know any anywhere in the skin and maybe if it was developed some kind of way in the face you had to you know deal with it can I tell y'all something this from leprosy and Facebook and it would be real nice if you disconnect it for about seven days its leprosy in the face and some of the things that you actually I'll come through your eyes and you read and you don't realize you getting sick so I'm an axon just as a priest disconnect for at least seven days now I know some of y'all run business and you got to do business I thought the personal stuff disconnect from the personal stuff for seven days Facebook that's next week's sermon but I have to let me keep going I wanted circumstance now that might to some y'all that that might be an unwanted circumstance but I've talked about leprosy in half go back and read Leviticus 13 and 14 you'll understand how these things got to be handled glory to God alright do you want to stop the leprosy disconnect all right let me keep reading where was I was reading a quote here either angel so let me keep going here a man and and trust me next week come back next week I got I got more on that a man all right where was I in that quote here oh yeah sometimes God uses sickness for chastisement for the people did you know that sometimes it's brought a pump them for a whip to bring them back to God and what if God has permitted something there and I buy a divine gift taken off without repentance of that person did you notice the man here that told me a couple of nights ago something another that was standing here on the platform he professed to be a Christian oh Lord see a lot of people profess to be Christians but they finished demonstrate that they're not Christians listen he belonged to a modern church and everything and he had some trouble wrong with him and I looked and I kept seeing it turned dark and I kept watching I've seen him standing on a corner with the sick guy on his mouth smoking like that blowing the smoke I said sir you have a habit and that's what standing between you and God if you're ready to lay down those cigars God's ready to heal you now say in front of everybody but he was professing to be a Christian but cometh oh that pillar of fire and a had it called die what was really going on this life don't don't be embarrassed by God get to life right right God he says God's ready to hear you now see and he goes we'll stay here not long ago there was a woman come across the platform very saintly looking woman and she walked up on the platform she had one ear death I just detected a deaf spirit and I tried to rebuke it in a state with the woman and while looking at her I've seen a young lady stepping in front of me about 14 years old and she took the road that's wrong I began to tell I told a woman she had a baby before she was before she was even married and then she married a man she left him and but that was some religious cult calls her to marry some other man she didn't love him she left him I said you're living with her husband now that you're having all kinds of trouble and the woman fainted on the platform and when she rose up from there she screamed God have mercy on me and when she did God open up her ear give her the baptism of the Holy Spirit standing on the platform right there it was our mourning circumstance to there's in front of all those people but when the saying got clear the lady received the baptism of the Holy Ghost God uses sunburnt circumstances to draw us closer to him oh my god I want to pick up the story of Jacob man he had so many unwanted circumstances that occurred in his life and let's just turn here to Genesis 31 and we'll read this praise the Lord we all have it we all have unwanted circumstances but God can use those those circumstances amen a draws closer to him closer to him count it all joy well already got Genesis 30:1 starting at verse 1 now as we as we read this to understand you know there are some other things that happen in Jacob's life before he got to this part and some of those things that happened a man Jacob there born in the house with his parents and man his mama loved him but his daddy loved his brother Esau the Jacob got you know he fixed some good porridge and got a blessing you know a birthright you know from his from his brother so you know look if you you want if you his brother come from hunting and also you want you want you want some food you got to give me your birthright say I don't care about my birthright you can have it so I'm about to die you can have it just gave him a little porridge some lentils you know for my understanding and he sold out for that you know Esau slowed down and then when it come time for a blessing if I thought he was about to die and it says it's except since of Esau at the field give me some good savory meat let me eat that at your hand before I die and I want to bless you well the the wife Rebekah heard this and she calls Jacob to going she said what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go and get an animal I'm gonna make it just the way your daddy like it and when I make you the way your daddy like it then I want you to go in and and get that blessing from your daddy now now you got to understand I look at this lady everything she was doing she was manipulating behind the scenes and nobody knew she had done all that Jacob knew she done it right Jacob knew she done it but you know even when it comes to time that Jacob left home because Esau was gonna kill him Esau lived all their years not knowing his mama was the one that set him up that's that's that's that's something that I mean this play they had a spirit on her where she was I mean she was trying to help God out God had told gave a promise about the older was serving the younger but she didn't have to help God out that way she created her own problems in her own household but with her actions these stories I'm half in the scripture just to happen we got to learn how to just let God be God otherwise we create unwarranted circumstances in our house we treat one child different than we cheek to treat the other one don't do that as parents treat them all the same man when I bought my daughter's cause if y'all noticed they all had the same car they all had this all them end up with Hyundai Sonata treat them all the same they've got different colors but they got the same car now when it's time for them to buy their own cars they can choose whatever they want to choose but they can't say daddy love the other one but no no no daddy didn't dare to treat you all the same all right praise the Lord but when we look at you know we look at the story amen here Rebecca is behind the scenes and she's manipulating and doing all kind of things and and and when went when they when they go on their trick you know Isaac and I mean here she's tricking her husband here she's also tricking her son I mean here she's just creating all kinds of problems in order to get this blessing for one boy right so when when Jacob goes in he gets this blessing and and the scripture talks about how you know as I said you know it's that guy I can I can feel the hair you know you know because II thought was a hairy man right and and Jacob was not a hair and I said now you don't put this this this this skin on your on your face and you make yourself your hair so now it feels like Esau's body but it sounds like jacobs voice you said now wait a minute say something writers Betty went on and ate and they smelled at me said you know what all right you must son I'm gonna take it because his eyes was going dim I want circumvent that this man was going blind right so he said he say uh he said I'm gonna take it I'm go ahead and bless me bless Jacob Jacob got that blessing and got out of there and then here come East off running as a dad I got the meat for you daddy I got it I'm you know I'm ready ready for my blessed they say son who's that just left him who just left here so Jess guy said he said son I just blessed somebody already whoever will just just here just got the blessing say my brother Jacob them did it to me again well athlete say daddy you got to have at least one blessing for me at least one more he gave him a blessing and said man daddy when he didn't tell his dad but in the start said once my daddy dies I'm gonna kill my brother Jenkin I'm gonna kill him I'm gonna kill me them took my birthright ain't gonna took my blessing I'm gonna kill him well the mama say well send them on back to my brother Laban because his brothers pretty furious with him he gonna get him and and and and we need to just get him out of here for right and I get Jacob out of here and she used another story to get him out of there Oh Lord Jesus her story was you know how two wives of East all Oh God you can bring the wrong wife home and actually create unwanted unwanted circumstance by bringing the wrong wife or bringing her own husband home and they said she say these ladies just grieved me I just I don't know what to do with these these lady please send my boy don't let him get married to one these ladies right here send them back home and let him get my brother Laban and let him find a wife down there most months of people so she sent Jacob away and we picked this story up and I was I was glad as Jacob when it went on his own you'll go back here you can read this but as he went on his own there come a time Jacob got so tired he just couldn't take another step and he laid down on the ground and when he laid down on the ground he saw a ladder going up you know to heaven he saw angels ascending and descending but the very spot that he felt tired Oh God God allowed him to get tired say the very spot to show him this lamb I have given you and I've given it to your seat after you the very spot that he felt like he couldn't go no further that's where he got a promise from Almighty God today you might feel like you cannot go any further but God got a promise for you that he's gonna turn a man that that that that that what looks like a a man looks like a cloud of situation gotta make that a blessing in disguise meant for you you can't go in there first but God got a blessing waiting for you if you keep pressing through it Jacob finally makes it to Laban that unwanted circumstance that caused him to leave home the blessing that he received he got a wife the love of his life Rachel was waiting for him on the other side of his trial he got Rachel well it didn't stop there because when he married Rachel he served seven years oh can I just I'll just bear with me just for a little bit here I'm coming out see honey sister sweetheart you want a man that will go to work you want a man that'll go to work not a man that you working for you came short in the Bible where there was a mr. dad or mr. mom it that that's not in the Bible a man that don't work and supposed to eat that's what the Bible say right you want yourself a man that'll go to work and when Jacob saw Rachel he said I work seven years for us and he worked so many years for her just getting just getting herself together you know couldn't come wait for his wedding night and he said he'd say like they went by so fast because he was so in love with her well seven years got me go to work there's no finishes working late okay I'm ready to give marriage his wedding night can I give you another piece of advice don't get married at night you better get married in the daytime you got another Bible if you understand what I just said man he got married and there's his wedding night this veil over his wife and man he just my god finally I got I got Rachel I'm with Rachel the one I love and he went to sleep that night and he woke up the next morning and the veil was taken off and he looked over Leah this is not Rachel I did not work for Leah I work for Rachel he went straight to the father-in-law why would you treat me like this let me tell you something see all them tricks that he played in his past they caught up with him all them wanted circumstances that he created now he got some but you don't marry tonight you can't you can't get rid of it so the daddy say I tell you what you just fulfill how weak and then you work another seven years and I give you Rachel now now it didn't it wasn't that he worked another seven years to get Rachel he only had to wait seven days to get Rachel but during the time of him waiting seven days ago I mean by also getting Rachel he had to also fulfill another seven years so he was there for 14 years now and got his two wives a lot of different things come up a lot of different trials come up a lot of unwanted circumstances and we pick up a time for Rachel I mean for Jacob to take his wives and it's time for him to go back home to his his daddy that's what we picked up and let me let me tell you something there's gonna come a time in your life God gonna create some unwanted circumstances and it's gonna drive you back to where you come from oh I just said something God will create some unwanted circumstances in your life and it will drive you back to where you come from I remember the slalom he came from Florida I had to come back to Florida I wanted circumstances will drive you right back to where God wanted you to be all along so in the midst of it count it all joy let me just pick up these notes he had to run for his life from his brother Esau after taking the birthright of the blessing sometimes things occur in a family that might generate a need for separation but during the separation God has to do a work on both ends in order to bring the two parties back together again I hope you get that during the time of separation God has to work on both ends in order to bring the two parties back together again Joseph's brothers had they still had the same spirit on them when they came back the story would not an end it the same way and had Joseph not change himself the store would not have ended that way but God had did a work on both of them while they were separated in order to bring the two parties back together again where you can see reconciliation while on the run Jacob encountered God he saw the angels descending Amen ascending and descending to heaven he was tired of walking but the very places he was laying words ordained by God to be his and to be an inheritance for his children he worked seven years of Mary Rachel tricked on his wedding night and was given Leah worked in additional seven years a man to finally get Rachel a man he worked seven days but then he had to work another seven years amen as he as he agreed to with Laban and order to have both Leah and Rachel now we picked up something here in Genesis 31 let's read verse 1 through 7 and then we'll call it a closed today he said they heard the words of labour this is the time where Jacob is being driven back home says inherit the words of Laban latest on sin Jacob have taken away all that was our fathers and of that which are which was our fathers have he gotten all this glory and a cat beheld the countenance of Laban and behold it was not toward him as before and the Lord said unto Jacob return unto the land of our fathers and to their kindred and I will be with thee see see now God is speaking that it's time to go and there's some things that's happened throughout this time of him being with Laban and God allowed these things happen in order to push hiccup to the place where he didn't feel comfortable where he was it's time to go back home now glory to God don't worry about us one day and dad is one day the children gonna have to come back home just wait on the unwanted circumstances God has a way it's some time it might take 20 years just like it took for Jacob but 20 years later here that aren't what that circumstance coming they coming back home listen and Jacob said and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock and said unto Him I see your father's countenance is that it is not toward me as before but the God of my father has been with me and you know that with all my power I have served your father and this is what I like here and your father hath deceived me and changed my wages ten times but God suffered him not to hurt me so he worked for them 20 years and he's changed his wages ten times now we thought we thought we thought we saw two of them work seven years and you can have Leah I mean Rachel well then it comes that well okay another one you work you just fulfill how weak and then you can get you know Rachel but then you have to work another 70 years that Jacob has been in this journey for 20 years with Laban and ten times his wages has been changed he's had trial after trial after trial with Leoben I want you to understand something here cuz you got trial at the trial with your personal even whoever that is might be your boss a man it might be somebody in your family but whoever that is you got your trial but here here here's here's the thing I want you to understand he says he said your father have to see me and change my wages ten times but look at this but God suffer him not to hurt me and when I'm telling you going through some trials you're going through some tribulations you're going through some de-stresses but it could be worse and what what Jacob was saying but God suffered him not to hurt me yeah he might have changed my might change my wages but he couldn't touch my life and what you need to learn how to do is find something to give God praise for why are you in the midst of whatever you're going through find something that you can just worship Him and just glorify his name and stop complaining all the time see this is how you have joy in the midst of your trial I like that he said he found something to give God thanks for and he was finally blessed to return home to his father and to his mother but it took Jacob a number of years to get to this point but God will allow unwanted circumstance to drive a person right back to where he wanted them to be all alone god knows what he's doing we believe that praise the Lord amen let me finish up just read a quote here for you Oh glory to God I want to just Tarrant turn just a quick page and we're gonna call it a date you know there's unwanted circumstances I'm gonna be recognizing your day in its message that'll be a friend of quote but even even here in our land their unwanted circumstances that occur and and and sometimes laws and leaders and all kind of things God creates God a lot not creaks but he allows these things to be created in order to put us in a place where we need to be the Prophet makes a statement here and recognizing your day in its message see we don't have to get too involved in all the political conversations don't don't don't don't don't allow yourself to get wrapped up in that type of stuff God knows who's gonna be who Amen God already knows that praise the Lord whether they cheat it to get in or what God knew that they were gonna get in listen like Israel back in the promised land she don't know how she got back there she was just automatically put back there why master of force put her in her place now I'm gonna say something national force put Israel in her homeland national force will put the church in the World Council of Churches that's that's national force that's government right he says but the power of God will put the people in the bride's the world forces this way and the world forces that way but God forces upward unwanted circumstances will produce a rapture Kevin oh joy church glory to God say the Spirit of God which is the word of God my word and spirit in life will put the bride in her place because she'll recognize her position in the word then she's in Christ we'll put her in her place no national force will do it but the national force did drive Israel to the homeland the National forces of the Council of Churches will drive every organization into it but the power of God will raise the bride into glory out of it old people recognize their day as Jesus warned you the sign of Sodom and the church's condition of this thing we got a lot of unwanted circumstances spiritually but God is using every one of them to draw us closer to him I counted joy I counted joy hallelujah praise the Lord let's have a word of Prayer Church thank you Jesus glory to God father help us Lord to recognize all of these little things that are happening to us Lord it's just a little minor trials they're not even not even we can't even account them worried into the glory that's going to be revealed in us we can't even compare it Lord to that so help us Lord to just embrace what you have allowed to happen it's preparing us for something much greater we Lord we can see all the little of natural things but God it starts moving to the spiritual side Lord how the prophetess brings in these national national forces listen doing that Lana unwanted circumstances even even in the past administration some of the laws that were passed unwanted circumstances but it's moving us closer to you Jesus help us to understand that God you'll never leave us nor forsake us so help us God so discount it joy no matter what it is that we're facing help us to count it joy we need that heart and God I don't know what what different ones are going through but I know God that you have a plan for everything that we're going through everything that you sent jacob through god your hand was orchestrating the whole thing everything you said joseph

certainly the Lord is here with us amen appreciate a message you know we are certainly going to go through some things amen and in this Christian of all but uh you know this is for our own good he's in control he's in control of everything you know strengthen us a man who prepares for what we gonna go through you know and I'm truly y'all I'm a witness of that you know one of the things Jack gave me the space of time to to address you in this role as and Lord gave me a couple of things if they're Whitney I wanna find them real quick if you keep glasses that help take the fresh off me [Music] many of you know me and I've known for a long time this is not something that I [Music] stumbled into you know it's not something that often and I'll tell you this you know don't apologize for that I can't be nobody else but Who I am been through a lot of things you know I'm your brother man just like like everybody else and in this walton is gospel that we go through there's been some trying times I can certainly say there's been some trying times you know but uh God is faithful my wife and I I went through some real difficult trials in my life but uh you know I'm gonna serve the Lord with all I got you know they probably made a statement here in the message super sign very poignant there's 31 years ago I dedicated my life he said and I died the over the Brenham and give myself a service to respect and to take the filth off of the name of Jesus Christ and to put the Word of God back into the church he says I'm 31 years in service I turned 50 years old this year [Music] and Tina can attest it's just a brand it's just a car touch over 31 years that we've been in this message it's been a touch over 31 years that we we all remember what we went through when we first was introduced and came into this faces we all understood not not realizing that we'll be here at this time for sure that the rapture would have been taking place but here we are [Music] remember here in a lot of time that even at that time when we were young teenagers you guys age or younger there's some young men will take this message and take it across in sis I have the camera before I had been looking forward we would hear that and we wouldn't think for that would be yes we figured the rap should be done took place fun manner but like I say here we are and my grandmother passed few years back she was matriarch truly a woman that I've never heard that I look to as an example of a Christian a true Christian and the Lord took her home and it it did something to me in not long after that he took me father and I told the Lord that from my age that I was and when I was born my grandmother was around fifty years old I've never known her not to serve God with everything she had and I made a vow to God I promise that my children are my grandchildren from this day forward I never know me not serving the Lord regardless of where I'm and regardless of circumstance I'd go through I'm fully committed to serving God nothing will stop me [Music] we come a long way become a mighty long way and I believe what I see that God is doing that uh it's the hand of Lord yeah I remember back when we were in the other church and you know we had the meetings coming up brother Westco and la Fontaine's getting ready to uh they don't talk la Fontaine's were touring before Bobby Troup started touring and I found taste out of torment from watching the truth we we took it on the road first man sister Luis we would get a bus and we hit the road having church to church spreading God's Word brother James was our past and would preach and since the Lois was saying and the words spread the gossip rated was it was just wonderful but they tend to handle Jehovah my circumstance is unwanted brought us here and to finish this quote says 31 years of service God helped me to live and to see the day when I can see the hearts of Christians beating as one and the filth of women and mien and churches and their Creed's things drop away and the truth unadulterated Church of the Living God stands in the beauty of Christ to receive him when he come and I everything in my power to achieve them and that's my desire of my heart I realized what was so close we had to eat God is coming back for the church not only a church but a church church body and a church assembly without a spot or wrinkle we want the church well God have Liberty among us so everything has to be second order I said I'm reminded of the the young woman and the Bible there that approached Jesus as a Gentile and said I was on a date she didn't he just like like he didn't even hear because she approached him incorrectly she approached him incorrectly so when everything is in order we're in lockstep and we're all on one Accord
