that a man on tonight we ought to be encouraged this is a season to be encouraged not discouraged God is moving God is moving anybody else want to share a quick testimony before we go into the Word of God right praise the Lord all right well god bless you man we'll uh we'll take our Bibles and just read it a couple scriptures here tonight a man and we'll go from there oh just love the way the Lord does things a man mighty god mighty god I want to read really from two passage of scripture John 15:7 and then also Matthew eight maybe I'll just read John 15 and let you be seated man John 15:7 praise the Lord Bible it says here if ye abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall asks what you will and it shall be done unto you that's all we want to read let's just pray over them their God we thank you for your word and we just trust Lord Jesus that you would just come in quick in this little thought to our hearts tonight thank you for well your presence just being here and what a blessing is to come to the house of the Lord on a Friday night and feel refreshed to go on through a long weekend different trials and tribulations but we can come back to the house of God a man and just feel your presence it's so it's so good my father we just pray tonight that you would just take control over this portion of the servicemen you receive all the glory all the honor and all the praise some Jesus name we pray amen amen you can be seated I got another scripture that will read in a little bit but just for a little tough topic tonight a man send the word a man sin the word praise the Lord a man we we want to just kind of talk about that I'll just start by reading a man a little quote here from the Prophet either the message the endtime sign seat he's making a comment here and it says when we see God heal a man here a few days ago in our church I give out I was going to preach there on a Sunday last Sunday a week it is now a week from last Sunday says they brought a little girl and they're on a stretcher and they called me in the night on the road and see if the girl cannot live the caster was so bad about 17 years old she can't even get there right she's going to die before she gets there it says it was a pitiful case a lovely little child of seventeen years old to prove something to my church I love what the Prophet says here to prove something to my church I never touched the child at all never laid hands on her right never touch the child at all says I never asked as much as touched her I walked in laying on a stretcher of course there was other sick people but I was concerned about the child to catch her spirit when I spoke to her and she seemed like a very fine little girl I see no reason why that child should feel a premature grief and that has to be the devil trying to take her life he goes home since so I'll never touch the child at all went right to the pulpit with the word and stayed right with the word and the word healed her so instantly until she got up and walked away never even prayed for I never even touched them just preach the word and the girl got up and walked away now before she heard the word they were saying that the girl couldn't make it to the service hallelujah so it's the environment that we said right that creates all the problems that people have they maybe they had an environment of doubt but when they got into an atmosphere where the word was being preached and presented the girl called faith in the Word of God and got up and walked out hallelujah he goes home said as he said sorry I said instantly until she got up and walked away is all right now living like anybody else can't find the trace of it anywhere never even touch touch touch touch touch that touched her see the word went for and she believes the word and the word is God's life and God's power was and the word is what does it are we understanding that hey you don't need nobody to touch me the word is gonna do this if God made a promise amen then that promise has got to come to pass hallelujah oh my gotta be careful when I say things like this think man I mean we thank God for the doctor we think God for every profession but if God give me a promise in this world I'm expecting the world to do what needs to be done somebody the word has the power the word has the anointing and imma just i'ma just say this imma get out ahead of myself you know we keep sending the word it's just like sending Jesus himself oh come on somebody Amen I got a little statement brother Graham say he say God and His Word is the self-same being God and His Word is the self-same P and when I heard that I say well the word is a being the word is a person amen in the beginning was the word and the Word was God and the Word was with God and the word became flesh and dwelt among us over you sinan the world you sit in a person the person of the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah in any time Jesus is present things are gonna change situations are gonna it cannot stay the same with the word is present whatever situation you're [Applause] [Applause] promised so much a man never give you problem give the devil a promise to that situation the line is the power the line is the anointing the word is the difference glory to God amen amen amen hallelujah man I just you know I'm just listening to this you know so for the brand I'm speaking about this is just bless my heart I just want to give you a couple of things here cuz I want to read a little bit but I'm inspired we don't realize the power that we have when we send the word it's the word that's gonna change it even when you pray put the word in your friend and then put the word for quote a scripture at the beginning of your brand remind god of what he said no matter what it is that you're facing if it's a sickness of the box and your body got you sing you are the Lord my God that healeth all my diseases that's what you say and if you said that I know your word can't fail glory hallelujah somebody send the words alright alright alright let me just read a little bit here a man ain't man this is coming out of the message questions and answers on the Holy Ghost glory to God the Prophet makes a statement says now look if I want to go back to Ephesians the first chapter first chapter the pop preacher now the Corinthians each one had a tongue and a song you noticed the other churches didn't have that trouble he never said nothing about it he did he did he ever mentioned tongues anywhere in the Ephesian Church the Roman Church know they had tongues and everything just like the Corinthians did but they had it set in order it says the Corinthians just couldn't get get it in order to see but Paul went down there and set the church in order I believe it's all Robert says God's a good car don't you believe that and you say well what about the Pentecostals with the tongues then brother Brad I think they got the Holy Ghost sure they did all right why look you believe he's a good god Thomas said one time you know Lord all that arrested him believed him said oh we know we know he's real Oh Thomas said no no I don't believe it the only way I believe it I'll have to have some evidence I'll have to stick my fingers in his side and in the prints of the nails in his hand he's a good car now before I go further than that you know oftentimes we want to wait until the thing has happened before we testify right amen what we supposed to do as believers has testified beforehand oh my god right we we bake cakes first before we see miracles believe us that's what we do the Prophet come to town and it may say you bring me a cake first before you do anything else yes this is a family condition if this lady she's already told a prophet that is what I'm gonna do is do this and that and meet my son we're gonna eat this ring on that it's just already total profit and maybe she's thinking that she'll get some sympathy hallelujah and then because that's what we look for sometime God not in the business of giving sympathy right God is in the business of changing your sympathy smile on your face you remember the winner's name she was she was uh she was going through a rough time but we see the apps across the eyes of the world it changed her situation hallelujah it's so so here man maybe this is what a woman is given you know that's it you know we don't do this we go down maybe looking for some simple saying look I'll tell you what you do you make me a cake first and then go feed your son and I guarantee you that's a barrel empty and you my word about you that's what you we sitting word if you abide in me if you do it exactly what God is calling you to do and what excites you to do you can send the word on your behalf Oh hallelujah let's do over here his book the Prophet goes on says I have to stick my fingers in a silent in the prints of the nails in his hands he's a good guy he said come on Thomas here you are says Oh Oh Thomas said now I believe he said yes Thomas after you sing me and fill me and put your hand in my side you believe he says but how much greater is their reward who had never seen and yet believe glory he's a good god he gives you the desire of your heart of course let's just believe him that's the death stroke to Satan oh thank God for that yo yo yo yo your belief your faith is it could give devil of death stroke hallelujah amen that's the desktop to Satan when a man tensed God at His Word brother that'll kill Satan every time anybody interested in and killing the devil let's have a little further careful please God and the way we're gonna do that is by taking God at His Word that's a test talk to the devil when somebody gets set up and say the Bible says the Word of God see I'm not looking at my circumstance I'm not talking about how I feel I'm talking about what the Word of God says glory glory glory he says say that better kills thing every time that's the hardest-hit that thing can get when a man will take God at His Word yes sir says like as I said next and I live I live alone Jesus the other night but every word that proceedeth out of the mouth say man I love that just take God at His Word that will that'll produce that death stroke to the demo hey man let me go on with a couple more here Amen this is out of the message wisdom verses faith a man wisdom verses faith I tell you would probably be dropping nuggets all over the place yes hey man we just sit there and just listen like what did you just see just nuggets all over the place look at this he says now what started he's talked about in the Garden of Eden here it was all Eve had to do is just hold to the word God had give him the word all she had to do is hold to the word but she began to reason with the word and that's where that's where you know you say you say wisdom is really coming from the devil hallelujah amen wisdom really coming from the devil wisdom goes against your faith hallelujah and as he was breaking that down I say uh-huh because you know we will take the wisdom of the doctor they've been in school for so many years and we take the wisdom over the top of the doctor over what the Word of God says we'll take the wisdom of some professional person over what God's mercy and God don't want us to be that way and then we can appreciate them but you know their knowledge only goes so far their wisdom only goes so far but the wisdom of God is unsearchable right and all God wants to do it just take him at his word so I want to tell you tonight send the word whatever problems you got send the word send the word a man a man a man that is the word went to Port st. Lucie it's the word going to Marilee it's a word going to abjure right it's the word going to Portland are you with me here the word go to Haiti [Music] the word of go places where you can't go the world will give into situations that you can't get into come on sucks all you've got to do it's in the world I got so I got I gotta read I got a ring you know my momma taste something about this when you send the word if there's something there inside of them for the word to connect to it's like a hitch in too if you got if you got this hits on the back of your truck that you can tow anything how low you can pull posts you can pull campus but you gotta have something to hit it to before you can pull it and if that's the native seat in the heart of your child when you sit the way I don't care where they go they gonna be toting that water with them wherever they go [Music] [Applause] Jeff's in the Word of God he sent His Word to heal us in answers that's what that's what the Bible said he sent his word to him we might not be able to give in to the situation because when we talk people misunderstand what we're trying to say but if I can send the promised Word of God I gotta we're turning a single rock chefs in the word send the word send the word send the word freeze cogs look at this and whistle versus face the Prophet says now what started it reasoning see faith has no reason you know reason at all you believe he says when you pray for and accept God's Word for healing don't reason with your feelings don't reason with nothing else don't even don't even sit down and have a conversation with your feelings don't even talk to your feelings I mean tell your feelings their life man hey man tell your test results you bang what the word say praise God it may be these numbers got to come back down get back into a normal area I don't know I don't know what I don't know what's doing this but the words am supposed to be healed praise God not gonna accept this hallelujah glory glory glory glory oh Jesus Lori to God you know I was in a little something today a man a little lunch and learn thing and the man made a comment you know he was a pharmacist he was talking about how people get they met at medications on mixed up right and because they got so many medications it's easy to get them mixed up and they say a lot of times what happens is that a doctor if you ever seen a doctor's writing you can't understand that most of the time you saying that if you can't understand it how you think me as the pharmacist understand what he wrote you call your doctor right you can't get in touch with them I call your doctor I can't get in touch with him so what I'm gonna do is take a stance I'm gonna assume if you tell me you got these symptoms this is what you need any say say there's you know sometime they write things up and and you know one person went to the pharmacy just to get cough medicine and she ended up with some other type of medicine because it was just misunderstood things was that if I take this I'm gonna get back right why don't just pick on it it's work because then say better there is a high probability that somebody gonna get something wrong with this medication yes man they said they had a thing they got this thing now that they do they got a test at their door people and they call it the placebo and what they do the placebo they'll tell you say now we're gonna do this test with you you might have genuine medication and you might not now maintain it the placebo looks just like the real medication but there is nothing inside of it that will actually make you better the placebo they find people taking the placebo actually getting better and they trying to figure out how did the person get [Applause] [Applause] the Word of God and watching it bring our bodies and to the police God ordained for to be hallelujah we don't have to take the placebo take the words [Applause] we got a baby they still trying things out we got something that works hey man a man all right let me let me let me let me let me let me all right this is good this is your let me read this let me you say you say y'all don't reason it all and you believe when you pray for and accept God's word for healing don't reason with your feelings don't reason with nothing else there's no reasoning to it God said so in that settles it this oh how I like to stop in a few minutes and rest on that and take a text out of it can't do it and preach these about 40 and 50 texts I got ripped down here but reason he said he says when the Lord gives a vision sometimes just to tell you my own little infant ways the Lord gives a vision something is going to happen well I don't care what is contrary to it and remember everything that can be presented contrary Satan will do it amen he'll try the reason you can't do it look at this he say for instance that what I just caught a few moments ago about going now this was kind of off the beaten path just before my mother with and the Lord knew I was going to I was gonna I wasn't going to be able to keep those appointments with those brethren about going hunting and vision and sent me all the way into British Columbia it says and when we got there the guy said I've never see what they're using words like that that that's reasoning let's get ready to settle in when they say I've never seen a silver tip my brother Brandon I'm told my god God got me never total of inches and everything and this man said I know you up in this area but all the years I've been here I've never seen a silver tip I've lived here all my life and the sides we're going plumb up into sheep country on horses there's no silver tips you ain't gonna get enough up there you see see trying to move away reason the guide is telling them these things now the beach and say go but when you get better God say mochila chips up in oh I wanna take some wink God is giving you something that whether it's by vision weathers fine direct inspiration from the Word of God no matter what nobody say you stay with the word of God if God had to create a path then God would created because the bitchin said it was gonna be glory he says he says we got there the guy said I've never seen it says from the beware he says st. said to me you just misunderstood the vision worried the devil some crafty fellow said but I didn't it's gonna be sad the Lord and when the caribou came up we got that which was in a vision as you all know it says did he say the guy said to me very fine brother to be with him now and a few weeks young Christian said brother branham my brother had the absolute epilepsy and you rolled up on that horse that day and told me a certain thing to do my brothers ever epilepsy it was ceased he said when I did exactly what the Holy Spirit told you to tell me say he's never had a spell from that thing now this man testifying but look at him saying I said now here we are on top of this mountain and for three miles right down there there's not even a bush four inches high nothing but careful knobs a few blueberries and they only get 2 or 3 inches high set caribou blue bears plumb to the Timberline and I'm out horses where it hits in the Timberline and now according to what you told me before we come here that's somewhere between here and where that boy is standing with that checkered shirt off you're gonna kill a 9-foot Silvertip grizzly bear ain't no weight it's gonna happen but God told me and since God told me I'm standing on this promise word look at me say that I said the Lord see it says what was it Satan trying to get me to disbelieve that since we started down the mountain clothes we got he kept saying brother Brennan we're only about a mile from it now reasoning he says is I said are you doubting but are you daddy but he said he says not at all we got within about a half a mile II said we're only a mile now I said that's right said just think it's how you respond to this pain it's how you react to this thing just think about it i'ma get my silver tip grizzly [Applause] think about it this Sunday my child is coming just please calm this send me my child I said your child is coming this Sunday we said in the world applying the token to their life God is gonna bring it to pass Laurie glory glory ICI successfully says are you down buses not long we got within I about a half a mile said we're only a half mile now I said that's right said just think and a half mile casting down reasoning we got a cat anytime reason come this Casa de don't even talk about I know I'm not supposed to say this not if you know you're not supposed to say it don't say it don't let that come up to mouth don't let the devil use your mouth glory to God casting down reasons he said look we can see everything right before us there's nothing out there but I said that God who gave me the word can't create one thing don't reason just believe it don't pay attention any attention to reasons that has nothing to do with it just believe what he said that's all I was standing there looked up on the hills everywhere just yellow Campbell my mouse Sun going down hills beautiful you can see any little spot anywhere for three miles up the mountain right above me when I turned to look about two miles ahead of me or mile and a half or two miles stood a 9-foot Silvertip grizzly how he got there I don't know but he was there see and he goes on I'm just stopping this sentence here don't reason believe no matter what the just tell you they would say no matter what the circumstances don't don't reason don't reason believe no matter what the circumstances don't pay no attention to circumstances believe man it just reminds me you know brother Wescoe when he went to the first house Teddy ball and I'm gonna stop right there in that quote you can get Matthew 8 from me in a second I want to read that but the first house that he bought I remember you know we just remember our passes of standing and an apartment most of the years that we know he was in an apartment and and you know he had this house that he he got and took some of the Saints over to see the house and and when we got there he was just telling us how you know the loan officer saying sir I'm sorry we're not gonna be able make this happen we're not gonna be able to make this happen and fresco said he said they say well you know you keep doing what you're doing and I'm gonna keep - hum do what is what she's doing say I'm praying all right I'm praying and say you just keep working on it and God gonna turn this thing around and God gave brother Westco of Scripture and he took that script to me help them to the heart of the king is in God's hands right and they say in the heart of the king can be turned whatever wait got one attorney right so so so so so if the heart of the King now remember King is the final state song amen in any Kingdom hallelujah so I mean even if the the the guy on the mortgage company is saying no his heart is in God's hands and God got a way of turning things around right so you think so so so brother wife no just can't confess in that scripture every time the men say we can't do nothing with you I mean confess that scripture before you know the man come back say sir we found Malone and they got their first house amen end up living in that house for so long and then God bless them with enough and y'all hurt brother let's go ahead and give a testimony it's winning nine thousand dollars to clothes on the house didn't even have it the demon foreclosing didn't have it but God made a wing right don't reads it with anything glory to God Church no matter what the circumstances just keep on believing Oh hallelujah hallelujah hey man let me just look at this description I'm gonna bring it on home Matthew 8 let's look at verse 5 glory to God this is a wonderful story since when Jesus was entered into Capernaum there were there came up to him a Centurion beseeching him a man and saying Lord my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy grievously tormented look at this man jesus saith unto him I will come and heal him so you know I'm gonna take care of see when Jesus gets involved things about to change yeah I guarantee when Jesus get to your house your your servant will no longer have that same testimony oh come on Church and I'll tell you Jesus is getting involved in your situations when you send the word it just like sending him lowering to God a man the word is of the purse so when you send the words your sittings you actually release in Jesus to do something about it don't seems you'll doubt don't send your complaints in the word Jesus said unto him I will come and heal him not know maybe about it I'm gonna take care of it I will come and heal him go on he says the Centurion said lord I am not worthy that thou should have come under my roof I look at this man look at this but Speak the word only not what I said send the word only Jesus I got so much confidence in you that if your word go is just like you come hallelujah Speak the word only and my servant shall be healed those are the six but I am a man under Authority having soldiers under me and I say to this man go and he goeth and to another come and he comes and to my servant do this and he doeth it when Jesus heard it he marvelled and said to them that followed fairly I said to you I have not found so great faith no not in Israel Jesus was even stumped by this man Spain right I mean just think about it but the man had confidence that if Jesus would speak is just as good as Jesus going yes I want to leave that with you tonight if you found the promise in comfort if you just take you his work that's just as good as him being there himself you already know if Jesus showed up in your situation if he was your lawyer in the courtroom do you already know you weren't gonna lose if he was your doctor you know that sickness is gone right in a situation that Jesus is involved in you already know about the chain but it's time for us to recognize the power of the word of God that we have in our midst however the word is having cheese ice Nixon heard the voice let's say he is here and he is here he is here right now his word is rich hallelujah glory let's go on he saves all and I stand to you that ministers come from the east of west and shall sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness there shall be weeping and getting gnashing of teeth this is the last woman jesus said unto the Centurion go thy way and asked our house believed so be it done unto thee again never touch this distance this town never touch this service brother Branham never touched that young lady never touched him her he's the word deity say any surgery was healed in the selfsame hour now just look at this jesus said unto the Centurion go thy way and ask that has believed so be it done unto thee Jesus even say a prayer for the circles why who brought healing it was a man's confession in the word and so you say if you send your words say if you speak the word only I know my servant will be made old it was a man's faith in that confession that probably healing where's your faith in tonight if you got faith in what God said in his word it'll bring it'll interchange any situation to fix them tonight I got I got I got I got I got something else to share with you hold on says believe it so be it done unto thee if this servant was healed in the stuff same our Jesus never prayed for him maybe even you know said it in my lane just find not alone according to your faith you're gonna find the way you believe that we got to know how the power that's lying even in us let me read a testimony here Oh God I'm going back to wisdom versus faith now I don't know if I'm an I'm gonna just share it with you so no I need to have this neat I need to see this paragraph 335 from wisdom versus fear this is a testimony about the brother Evans who lost his car your remember his car Vince though not now now the car was stolen because brother Evans left his keys in the car my back in them times you probably could do that and it was you know kind of be okay nowadays you better not leave no keys in the car you you might be in some serious trouble right but uh but the man left the keys in the car and Salina come along in stolen I've another evidence was a brother that was traveling I believe almost like a thousand miles to come to church can you imagine that how many of us would do that a thousand miles to come to church one way brother Ramage said it cost him about $75 just to come to church back in that time that was a lot of money brother Evans get there to the city just to go to service leave his keys with call somebody to take the car and so they would just all say safe brother Evans was really down like I don't know what I'm gonna do I got all these kids I can't get back coma I don't have my car and brother Brown you know just made a statement he says Oh Lord let me just make sure I got this right yeah he says I was talking I was talking to brother Evans back there not long ago he come up here he dropped so far lost his car said over there at midlist left the key in it somebody come along and stole it yeah everything he he had everything he had in it you come up him and brother Fred and brother Tom and selling them come up to the house and said we well he looked like a little kid had his candy taken away from them just saw whipped out you can adjust imagine what man looking like coming up a brother right now just slow down try to looking for some sympathy hallelujah amen he says he says and I know there's times where certainly sympathy is appropriate but other times we got to know the power that is in us right he says he says he willing to look like a little kid and it's tender taken away from him just all whipped out you know so he said I just don't know what I'm gonna do hallelujah I said well now what is it now they're coming what's the first thing - the word ask the Father if you invited me and my wording you asked what you will now this is a scripture that brother Branham uses to pray over this man's if you abide in me my word are you this man is faithfully coming to church this man is a faithful type pair this man is you know I just just he's a regular they're driving for miles just to get the church and they say sitting out now he say if you abide in me my words of my view actually - it says what stay with the word just stay right with the word now look at look at this look at this so as I said let's pray we got down on the floor and got started praying and while there we were praying I said father I come to thee in the name of the Lord Jesus put that on the front end of your prayer I come to thee in the name of the Lord Jesus here is a brother that spins and works just a few days a week his hands on beat up from fixing on wrecked cars and and and and and things like that to get enough money to drive 14 and 15 hundred miles every Sunday to come into the meetings got a bunch of children defeat a customer around 50 or $75 a week to make that trip just to come to church see right he come up here trying to hear the word as we're trying to endeavour to contend for and I said some evil person has stole his car what is it I said now Lord I pray thee give him back his in the name of Jesus Christ he says what did I do I place that word that promise before God stilled it with the name of Jesus I want to I want to teach you how to preach tonight when you pray brand God one of its promises God you said this amen take that presenting that to God and then steal it like you send them an envelope of mail fill it with the name of the Lord Jesus somebody look at what happened here look at what happened say he says place that word that promise before God sealed it with the name of Jesus and sit bump the word glory right down the road it went we went down the road to get the car [Applause] situation you face it will work an arrest it the water can turn it around send the word in the name of Jesus look at what it say here now write down the road it went way out there found the place where it started like a hound on a rabbit trail see here he come right down the road Holland got down there just about halfway to Bowling Green Kentucky what broke forth he says the word found him the word found him I gotta keep going in this just him a vision flew back I seen a man yellow looking shirt on driving a young fella once been a Christian see by him once being a Christian he had a tow package [Applause] and the work is just it's old honey do you have any children that was Christians they got a tow package and the rock and hits home praise God similar young fellow once been a Christian the word struck him [Applause] he's a thief but because he once was a Christian he knew he wants both of you live in Atlanta and the word struck him you're doing wrong the word caught him he sent forth his mercy and caught him you're going to get caught in this someday and the law is going to get you for doing this turn around and take it back see it was working on his conscience can't sleep something working on the conscience you put in the word glory to God hey man amen amen amen amen I've heard people say I mean they think they gave a false prophecy yeah i'ma tell y'all a false prophecy you know what they say I will never step foot in the spirit of truth again that's a false prophecy I mean because the father's looking for them to worship Him the father seeketh folks that will worship Him we're in spirit and in truth Church was based on the words it's not somebody with an idea this was the word that did this oh my god my god hallelujah he says he says turn around and take it back the word got him he had once been a Christian I seen him bring it up here set it on the side of the street I said my brother just take right out a certain way here you'll find your car wait here while though till you till he gets it back now you had a full tank of gasoline yes he said said won't be anything bothered but their behalf that gasoline cuz it take half of it to run it says he was about halfway to Bowling Green about a hundred miles of it run out when he found it found it that's the way it was setting right exactly what was it the word went and got him now I can't read the rest of this because it's quite lengthy but but I do want to share this brother branham broke into another testimony and he's talking about a man let's see who was the brother day he was he was uh praying for brother I believe this brother it might have been brother and brother Evans again for the Welch Evans I think brother Evans was selling cars and he sold the car to a man for $400 and somehow the man got off the lot without paying brother Evans his $400 took off left pretty much stole a car and brother Bradley said this man was of a different spirit he said so this man he said they would they would accident man about going to church and you know he would make comments about well we're not going to church I'm just looking for the pretty blondes in the church so it showed that he had a different spirit at different anointing on him and with a different anointing on him he said when you sin the word to him there was nothing to latch on to there was nothing to latch on to this fella but the first fella used to be a Christian so when you send the work to him there was something that to get us you know stopped him right in his tracks but this other fella there was nothing for the word to actually laugh tone to he was gonna keep all going with that money and never pay it back because there was nothing to latch onto he said but we sit the word anyway and and and and and and and what brother Graham said the word kept an eye on this me it's out on the court I got to hurry say the word just kept an eye on the fellow now the word came back some sort of make a bring the money back but the word nowhere you act the word is watching everything you do hallelujah glory to God so so so so so this man even though he needn't have said word was washed out today praying about it and they released it sit I mean if you ask anything in my name you can have it if you're bothered me and my words about you you can have what you win right they just seal those promises over this silly the new name of Jesus just let the word watch over I was I was I was moved by this because you know the Lord told me send me I'll hold some money from some people and they done went five years without doing it giving you money tonight we don't send the word tonight we're gonna send the word I don't know why they trying to hold up your money why did Dodger you why they running from you while you're doing all these things but tonight we gonna send the word I'm not just preaching this just the priestess but the Lord put this in my spirit you know say say when I heard that quote I said okay Lord okay but some of y'all been waiting for years I mean this may have $400 some of y'all might be a lot more than $400 but it's time for the devil to release it and the way we gonna get it you ain't gotta fight with them we sit in the word now if there's something there for it to latch on to they'll bring it back themselves they'll bring it back if it's something to latch on but if it's nothing to latch on the word gonna watch over what we say tonight brother branch say the word kept an eye on this fella and what happened it says lemon kidnappers read that part go to paragraph 3 47 paragraph 3 47 says what did the word do kept kept it kept him in I see just on brother Welch just kept holding all of the set it'll be alright it'll be alright some of y'all had the same testimony it would be alright it's gonna work out hallelujah the word went after him if you abide in me and my word and you asked what you will see the word got after him says the first thing you know one of his boys was driving alone down here on the road and there it was he's seen the man in the cop got his number turn turned in to brother woods they called it found I find out where it was he was in Bowling Green God and heaven knows I never heard one word about it no nothing about it last Sunday it was a week ago afternoon when we when we when we got through preaching here went up there and changed my clothes and got ready to go to Florida Oh down brother Welch for the meeting

it and resolve it they just just any ruler knew nothing it was about uh $200 that uh discharged me for North agreed and I thought it was very wrong then they went as far as me and not make away for them reimburse me or refund the money so I was a little down so hard all day brother Jack say that formation because God just gave me a piece it would be all right and I know that God is gonna sing his word as we declare that tonight that people haven't changed in their hearts there was some way somehow and by two years ago actually there was a gentleman that I I bit my tongue it was about $400
