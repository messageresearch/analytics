[54:54] from Ghana last time I was there they
[54:57] had a debate for the youth like a youth
[54:59] debate and and we want to do that and I
[55:02] believe they have a sign-up sheet if you
[55:04] interested and being on on with the
[55:09] debate since the Erika's gonna have a
[55:11] sign-up sheet and we're gonna kind of

[1:00:50] stand and read a scripture amen on today
[1:00:54] and and then from there we will begin to
[1:00:59] take our fault a man and just bear with
[1:01:03] me you know what sometimes you get to
[1:01:07] looking at something in the Word of God
[1:01:08] and sometimes this thing like it's just
[1:01:11] a common right
[1:01:15] um but then you know you just start
[1:01:17] meditating on a God just being just open
[1:01:20] up you know you're you understand and
[1:01:22] just just cause you just kind of just
[1:01:24] look at that look look closer you know
[1:01:26] and and that's what we're kind of doing
[1:01:28] with the scripture here we took a
[1:01:30] thought last week and then we're going
[1:01:31] to come back remember a little bit more
[1:01:33] this weekend also a little bit more next
[1:01:35] week a man until God just releases us
[1:01:38] but let's not let's look at this out of
[1:01:40] first Peter chapter 2 a man praise the
[1:01:45] Lord
[1:01:47] verse 1 amen reads as follows says
[1:01:51] wherefore laying aside all malice and
[1:01:58] all guile and hypocrisy and envies and
[1:02:02] all evil speakings and you know I make
[1:02:06] comments about that last week but I tell
[1:02:08] you if you go back home and you really
[1:02:11] take a dictionary and really begin to
[1:02:13] look at what those words what what
[1:02:16] Peter's saying it'll it'll mean
[1:02:18] something to you
[1:02:19] right but it says all evil speakings
[1:02:23] as as newborn babes desire the sincere
[1:02:28] milk of the word that you may grow
[1:02:31] thereby
[1:02:33] if so be EF tasted that the Lord is
[1:02:36] gracious to whom coming as unto a living
[1:02:41] stone disallowed indeed of men but
[1:02:44] chosen of God and not only are you
[1:02:47] chosen of God but your and precious you
[1:02:51] ought to just tell the devil I'm
[1:02:54] precious
[1:02:58] when something precious you handled it
[1:03:00] differently all right you treat it
[1:03:04] differently yeah y'all remember the the
[1:03:07] living rooms the living room that was
[1:03:14] all white with plastic on top of the
[1:03:17] furniture and you couldn't go inside
[1:03:19] that room the room was pretty verse 5 ye
[1:03:32] also as lively stones are built up a
[1:03:36] spiritual house a holy priesthood to
[1:03:41] offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable
[1:03:44] to God by Jesus Christ well I'm not
[1:03:49] gonna go there that'll be for next week
[1:03:51] but that's that's that's rich
[1:03:54] yo that's very rich I'm leaving imma
[1:03:57] leave it where for also it is contained
[1:04:00] in the scripture the whole I lay in Zion
[1:04:04] a chief Cornerstone elect precious and
[1:04:09] he that believeth on him shall not be
[1:04:12] confounded unto you therefore which
[1:04:15] believe he is precious but unto them
[1:04:20] which be disobedient the stone which the
[1:04:22] builders disallowed the same as made the
[1:04:25] head of the corner and a stone of
[1:04:27] stumbling and a rock of offense and you
[1:04:32] know if I could just borrow just a
[1:04:34] couple words because we know rock being
[1:04:35] revelation there's some revelations that
[1:04:37] people are finding offensive a stone of
[1:04:44] stumbling and the rock of offense even
[1:04:46] to them which stumble at the word being
[1:04:52] disobedient where until also they were
[1:04:56] that mean they had to do it okay they
[1:05:01] were appointed but ye that's the but is
[1:05:06] a good word that's the what they call
[1:05:08] that
[1:05:09] conjunction that means something about
[1:05:11] the change every when I was a little boy
[1:05:14] he had that little cartoon conjunction
[1:05:16] junction what's your function and when
[1:05:24] you see a consumption something changing
[1:05:27] that mean he ain't he not talking to me
[1:05:29] in verse eight cuz I'm not one of the
[1:05:31] disobedient I'm not wanting to dissipate
[1:05:35] it but I am chosen generation a royal
[1:05:40] priesthood a holy nation a peculiar
[1:05:47] people I'm describing you this morning
[1:05:51] right that ye should show forth the
[1:05:54] praises of him who have called you it's
[1:05:57] what he did for you he called you out of
[1:06:00] darkness into his marvelous light which
[1:06:04] in time past were not a people but are
[1:06:08] now the people of God which had not
[1:06:11] obtained mercy but now have obtained
[1:06:14] mercy the Lord at a blessing to the
[1:06:18] reading of its word shall we pray over
[1:06:21] the scriptures that we've read father
[1:06:24] it only takes individual that has
[1:06:27] learned to read to be able to pick up
[1:06:30] the Bible and read the things that we
[1:06:33] have read but it takes the Holy Spirit
[1:06:37] to make it clear to us the things that
[1:06:41] we have read that our hearts and our
[1:06:44] spirits would understand what it is that
[1:06:46] you have called us to We Trust Oh God
[1:06:49] that you would now come amen and take
[1:06:53] control over this portion of the service
[1:06:55] as we enter into the word we pray father
[1:06:58] that you would give strength through
[1:07:00] your word that you would give correction
[1:07:01] through your word that you would give
[1:07:02] help through your word whatever it is
[1:07:04] that we need may you grant it today
[1:07:07] fathers in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:07:09] Christ that we pray amen and amen god
[1:07:14] bless you you can be seated
[1:07:16] amen our title today is a royal pre
[1:07:23] to a man a royal priesthood and just so
[1:07:34] that you know as I was going through my
[1:07:37] notes on this I ended up with about
[1:07:40] sixteen pages of notes and when it got
[1:07:44] that that that much of notes that said
[1:07:47] there's no way I can preach this in one
[1:07:49] sermon a man so we're going to break
[1:07:53] this up a man on today and next week and
[1:07:57] try to deal with this royal priesthood
[1:07:59] last week we talked about chosen
[1:08:01] generation a man and just bringing us up
[1:08:06] a little bit here when I look at Peter
[1:08:10] writing such words as this I start
[1:08:15] reflecting on the life of Peter and just
[1:08:17] some of the things that Peter had gone
[1:08:19] through Peter was a man that actually
[1:08:23] experienced firsthand the first coming
[1:08:26] of the Lord there it was a man with
[1:08:29] Jesus seeing so many things experiencing
[1:08:32] him feeding 5,000 a man and feeding a
[1:08:37] man a 4,000 you know seeing blinded eyes
[1:08:41] come open I mean just so many mighty
[1:08:45] things that he saw Jesus do you would
[1:08:48] have thought that Peter with a wrote
[1:08:50] that he was the chosen generation but
[1:08:54] even Peter haven't experienced that's
[1:08:56] the only man that was born like us but
[1:08:59] he took a walk one day on water a man
[1:09:02] and and and when he did that it showed
[1:09:05] us praise the Lord it showed us
[1:09:08] something that we can't just leave it in
[1:09:10] Jesus lap that that we actually have the
[1:09:14] the potential within us to be able to do
[1:09:19] things like this right because Peter did
[1:09:21] it we know he know he did sing but he
[1:09:25] won't write and that you might fail in
[1:09:29] some areas of your life amen but but you
[1:09:31] can always go back into there but I did
[1:09:34] with it
[1:09:35] I did overcome that and I did overcome
[1:09:38] this yes you might have got me there but
[1:09:40] when I called on Jesus alright I might
[1:09:46] have started sinking a little bit but he
[1:09:48] raised me up when I caught on Jesus
[1:09:50] right Amen so so Church we can look the
[1:09:53] devil 9 we don't we don't necessarily
[1:09:54] have to just you know knuckle down
[1:09:56] everything that he accuses the thumb we
[1:09:59] feel a chosen generation a man so when
[1:10:02] you really when you really just begin to
[1:10:04] look at Peters life and and all the
[1:10:07] things that he experienced in 60 years
[1:10:09] after the death of Christ Peter
[1:10:11] experienced amen
[1:10:13] the resurrection right Peter I mean
[1:10:16] because because Peter was the one that
[1:10:18] it was told they go you know Peter Peter
[1:10:21] Peter denied him and and all these other
[1:10:23] things like that nothing he denied him
[1:10:25] you know then it was told they go tell
[1:10:28] my disciples go tell my disciples and
[1:10:34] you know and another conjunction right
[1:10:37] don't tell my disciples and Peter that I
[1:10:40] risen again he made sure he didn't leave
[1:10:43] Peter out and I'm here to let you know
[1:10:45] this morning he made sure that he did
[1:10:48] not leave you out no matter what you
[1:10:52] don't do you can't be left I see I mean
[1:10:58] we put Peter thing but you gotta put
[1:11:00] your name down all my failures and all
[1:11:04] my mistakes go down go tell my disciples
[1:11:06] and Jack
[1:11:12] huh go tell my defense good see y'all
[1:11:16] disable charlie never done that around
[1:11:18] y'all so holy you ain't never done that
[1:11:22] all but the other day you hazardous
[1:11:25] purpose go tell my disciples and Jack
[1:11:31] tell them to meet me in Galilee I got
[1:11:36] something wrong when they get the
[1:11:38] Galilee see you know and Peter
[1:11:41] experienced all these great things but
[1:11:44] yet Peter would write 60 years later it
[1:11:48] says ye are chosen generation rather
[1:11:51] than I am a chosen generation but it
[1:11:54] says ye and the reason that Peter could
[1:11:57] say ye is that Peter also had a he had a
[1:12:01] glimpse of the second coming of the Lord
[1:12:04] and they knew that the second come to be
[1:12:06] even greater than the first coming and
[1:12:10] it's always looking at the people that
[1:12:12] are living in the earth amen at the time
[1:12:15] of the second coming of Lord and it says
[1:12:17] ye are a chosen generation glory to God
[1:12:22] I tell you I say amen to that
[1:12:26] I am a chosen generation let me just
[1:12:30] read a couple things here amen and then
[1:12:34] we will slip on into this thought of
[1:12:36] royal priesthood here in the message
[1:12:39] Salome the Prophet says that she says
[1:12:44] the hour is here says I'm sort of the
[1:12:48] last one on the last page it says the
[1:12:51] hours here if I could have been back
[1:12:55] there before the days that the world was
[1:12:58] created and looked down and seeing the
[1:13:01] whole thing it says when the father had
[1:13:04] said to me what day would you want to
[1:13:08] live I would say now right now think
[1:13:14] about that I'm not not doing the first
[1:13:16] coming of the Lord but I want to live
[1:13:18] now right now since this is the hour
[1:13:21] this is the greatest hour that the
[1:13:24] church has ever move
[1:13:26] into just before the coming of the
[1:13:29] bridegroom you are living in the
[1:13:32] greatest day that could ever be lived in
[1:13:34] oh my I want to tell you something your
[1:13:40] your attitude today towards the word of
[1:13:43] the Lord
[1:13:44] demonstrates what your attitude would
[1:13:46] have been had you lived back in those
[1:13:49] days Oh imma say something
[1:13:53] i'ma say something you know I mean
[1:13:58] Church we got it we got to recognize the
[1:14:00] devil and everything that he's trying to
[1:14:03] do to us because it's only the devil
[1:14:05] that that that brings division only the
[1:14:09] devil do that God don't do that you know
[1:14:12] at a hospital if a person is sick
[1:14:15] they'll take a man let me let me let me
[1:14:19] let me let me put it this way y'all just
[1:14:21] take that down just for a second if
[1:14:24] there was a gang-related shooting
[1:14:29] gang-related
[1:14:30] that means this gang is going against
[1:14:33] that gang and bullets begin to fly and
[1:14:35] people get hit on both gangs do you
[1:14:39] realize when the ambulance come they
[1:14:42] will pick up those that are hurt and
[1:14:44] they will take them to the same hospital
[1:14:51] say one you might be in different rooms
[1:14:54] but you don't go to the it's the closest
[1:14:57] one we're going to take because you're
[1:15:00] hurt we're going to take you to the
[1:15:03] closest hospital they not looking to go
[1:15:06] 50 miles down the road I mean we talk
[1:15:08] about life or death right now I want you
[1:15:11] to stay with me right because it's life
[1:15:14] or death we got to get you to the
[1:15:16] closest hospital and when you realize
[1:15:18] people are spiritually dying
[1:15:21] what you want to do is get them to the
[1:15:23] closest hospital spiritual hospital to
[1:15:27] church no matter what the condition is
[1:15:30] you got to get them to the church and if
[1:15:33] the natural hospital will accept them
[1:15:40] right and then you you have the bottom
[1:15:43] going to natural hospital and get help
[1:15:45] why can't they come to the spiritual
[1:15:47] hospital we don't we don't need we don't
[1:15:53] need the love of Jesus this is where we
[1:15:58] had it too dis dis message that we
[1:16:00] preach and got produce the love of Jesus
[1:16:03] Jesus love is so strong that even when
[1:16:06] people did I'm wrong it's prayer it's
[1:16:12] prayer
[1:16:13] I'm in you Bob I'm quoting your Bible
[1:16:16] well what do you say his prayer was
[1:16:18] Father forgive them for they know not
[1:16:22] what they do
[1:16:23] while he on the cross dine all right I
[1:16:29] just just trying to make sure we
[1:16:31] understand you know when we talk about
[1:16:33] this message you know not being an
[1:16:35] alternative to denomination that stuff
[1:16:38] now you know that's not what we're here
[1:16:39] to produce Christ right again we gonna
[1:16:42] produce Christ
[1:16:43] all right let's let's go on let's go on
[1:16:46] Amen let's go
[1:16:47] ain't got nowhere I just on the first
[1:16:49] quote I'm on the first quote so this is
[1:16:53] the alwah this is the greatest power
[1:16:56] that the church has ever moved to do
[1:16:58] just before the coming of the Lord oh
[1:16:59] the real Church of the Living Living God
[1:17:02] ought to be on fire burning with the
[1:17:09] light of the gospel what being dedicated
[1:17:12] among them
[1:17:14] rise and shine for the light has come to
[1:17:17] you the light of this day Isaiah was the
[1:17:19] light of his day Noah was the light of
[1:17:23] his day why he happened work Malatesta
[1:17:28] and the gospel the Bible words for this
[1:17:31] day is the light of the day what a
[1:17:33] glorious time that we're living I can
[1:17:36] just keep on saying he say I there was
[1:17:38] the light of his day nor was the light
[1:17:41] of his team
[1:17:43] Jeremiah was the light of his team John
[1:17:46] the Baptist was a light of his day Jesus
[1:17:50] payments
[1:17:50] so John the Baptist left us and he
[1:17:53] became the light of that day and every
[1:17:55] day but after Jesus died and a man rose
[1:17:59] again he turned over to the disciples
[1:18:01] they became the light of their day Paul
[1:18:04] became the light of his day Iranians
[1:18:07] retained the light of his day Martin
[1:18:09] Columba Luther Wesley the light of did a
[1:18:12] brother parables the light of his day
[1:18:16] but none of those people are here now
[1:18:24] while we still in church what is our
[1:18:28] purpose for being here come on now well
[1:18:32] you need to understand who you are and
[1:18:35] the reason you are call here does God
[1:18:37] want you shining the light under a
[1:18:39] bushel you got to let it shine because
[1:18:43] you have become a light of this thing
[1:18:53] ain't man church all right I'm going on
[1:18:57] hallelujah let's look at adoption part
[1:19:00] for y'all just stay with them just this
[1:19:02] is the foundation that is being laid now
[1:19:06] there's a there's a part of this sermon
[1:19:08] where I have to put emphasis because I
[1:19:11] was told by the Prophet to put emphasis
[1:19:13] so I'm going to put but let me just get
[1:19:20] there right adoption part four let's
[1:19:23] look at what they say first Paul takes
[1:19:24] all the scare out of it so now if your
[1:19:28] call if you're not just worked up in
[1:19:30] your mind by some kind of theology if
[1:19:33] you're really born to the spirit then
[1:19:36] God predestinated you before the
[1:19:39] foundation of the world put your name on
[1:19:41] the Lamb's Book of Life and now we come
[1:19:45] together to set in heavenly places in
[1:19:46] Christ Jesus a holy people a holy nation
[1:19:51] a peculiar people you know if you if you
[1:19:57] people on your job don't see nothing
[1:19:59] different about you
[1:20:02] if they don't see nothing different
[1:20:04] about you something's wrong if you
[1:20:07] looking like them you're not a peculiar
[1:20:09] person and we got we got folk nowadays
[1:20:12] walking around with orange hair and blue
[1:20:15] hair and green hair they don't mind
[1:20:17] being peculiar what I buy what about
[1:20:21] ashamed of being peculiar all right
[1:20:27] listen
[1:20:28] it says the holy people holy nation a
[1:20:30] peculiar people royal priesthood
[1:20:32] offering spiritual sacrifices unto God
[1:20:34] that is the fruits of our lips giving
[1:20:36] praise to his name people come in and
[1:20:39] say them people are crazy sure they are
[1:20:42] sure they are the wisdom of God is
[1:20:44] foolish to men to man in the wisdom of
[1:20:46] man is foolish to God they're contrary
[1:20:48] one to the other
[1:20:49] all right we're going to keep on going
[1:20:51] it says but the spirit a real spirit
[1:20:53] filled Church full of packed full of
[1:20:55] power of God set together in heavenly
[1:20:57] places offering spiritual sacrifices
[1:20:58] praise of God the Holy Spirit moving
[1:21:01] among them discerning sin and calling
[1:21:05] out the things that's among them that's
[1:21:08] wrong straighten out and make it a flat
[1:21:10] and level all right because why always
[1:21:14] in the presence of God in that bloody
[1:21:16] sacrifice I remember we went through it
[1:21:18] this morning you wasn't saved by the
[1:21:21] blood you're kept seized by the blood
[1:21:25] let me say it again you wasn't saved by
[1:21:28] the blood but you're kept safe by the
[1:21:31] blood you were saved by grace through
[1:21:36] faith believing it and then God not that
[1:21:41] your heart because he predestinated you
[1:21:44] you looked up and believed it accept it
[1:21:47] now the blood makes an atonement for
[1:21:49] your sins
[1:21:51] come on I thank God for the blood I
[1:21:54] thank God for the blood a man a man I
[1:21:58] went was sometimes all you need to do
[1:22:00] just get a good glimpse of the blood and
[1:22:02] that'll just keep the devil at bay in
[1:22:04] your life listen listen remember that
[1:22:06] God does not condemn a sinner for
[1:22:09] sinning he's the center to begin with he
[1:22:12] condemns a Christian
[1:22:15] for sinning right and there because he
[1:22:19] had condemned him Christ took our
[1:22:21] condemnation so there's no condemnation
[1:22:23] to them which are in Christ Jesus that
[1:22:26] what not after the flesh but after the
[1:22:28] spirit and if you do anything wrong
[1:22:32] it isn't willfully oh this is just I
[1:22:38] want to just soak in if you do anything
[1:22:40] wrong it isn't willfully you don't sin
[1:22:44] willfully sometime - double trap you
[1:22:46] into that and that's why God bring you
[1:22:49] out of it and when they bring you out of
[1:22:51] it he wants you to stay out of it you
[1:22:55] don't sin willfully a man that says
[1:22:57] willfully goes out and willfully says
[1:22:59] never come into the body yet but a man
[1:23:02] that's once in there he's dead as life
[1:23:04] is hidden God through Christ sealed by
[1:23:06] the Holy Ghost - the devil can't even
[1:23:08] find him
[1:23:08] I like that I want to be in that place
[1:23:12] where the devil can't find me he
[1:23:15] couldn't find Moses is wondering where
[1:23:18] his body was and he argued where is most
[1:23:23] I mean I know that I wear his clothes I
[1:23:27] don't even worry about it I want the
[1:23:29] devil I mean he can't find me I'm so
[1:23:32] wrapped up tied up tangled up in Jesus
[1:23:35] that the devil can't find me he's so far
[1:23:39] back in there he would have to come out
[1:23:41] of there before the devil can ever get
[1:23:43] in but you were dead I'm talking about
[1:23:46] you this morning all right let me uh
[1:23:49] there was a little situation here Oh My
[1:23:54] yes yes yes give me just one yes
[1:24:01] give me just let me go this message here
[1:24:03] ye him and then we'll keep moving on let
[1:24:07] me just stay stay with this a little bit
[1:24:10] here here you have the profits that this
[1:24:12] the Galatians one now and I want to just
[1:24:15] I hope your you understand what I'm
[1:24:20] about to say Galatians one don't say
[1:24:23] what I'm reading this quote the
[1:24:24] Galatians 1 don't say what he said it
[1:24:27] said I think he meant
[1:24:28] why right I don't mean I'm trying to
[1:24:31] change the words of prophet I'm just
[1:24:33] just being honest with your Galatians
[1:24:35] one don't say that
[1:24:36] Ephesians one does see that don't make
[1:24:39] it not the Prophet just make them a man
[1:24:43] that that that's what it does it makes
[1:24:46] them a man you understand some people
[1:24:50] want you to read it like it saying I
[1:24:52] will read it but I got some people that
[1:24:55] will go back and look at Galatians 1
[1:24:57] they realized that was it and then
[1:24:59] they'll get confused I thought you said
[1:25:01] he said yeah I'm just telling you I
[1:25:03] think he meant Ephesians and I think if
[1:25:06] he were here and we had a conversation
[1:25:08] with him he would tell me I meant
[1:25:12] Ephesians does that deduce it it
[1:25:16] properly
[1:25:17] all right ok listen if so if y'all don't
[1:25:21] mind if I say Ephesians 1 tells us that
[1:25:27] we were protectin ated to the adoption
[1:25:30] of sons by Jesus Christ predestinated of
[1:25:33] God though many are called but few are
[1:25:36] chosen the chosen was chose at the
[1:25:39] beginning now but we are predestinated
[1:25:42] to the adoption of the children of God
[1:25:44] by Jesus Christ in other words to you
[1:25:47] Bible scholars what I'm trying to say is
[1:25:50] a placing of a son listen the son was
[1:25:53] positioning place and today the church
[1:25:56] has gone on for year after year after
[1:25:59] year and when we see God calling man out
[1:26:02] one of his sons and positionally places
[1:26:04] him and makes him amen his son and
[1:26:07] recognizes it before the public then we
[1:26:10] turn that son down and say he's a divine
[1:26:12] healer or holy ruler don't you see or
[1:26:15] where the church I don't know what the
[1:26:17] remedy is I don't know how to ever get
[1:26:20] back to this place but that's the way
[1:26:22] our attitudes are towards that person if
[1:26:25] the ministries of God God will vindicate
[1:26:27] that ministry if it isn't of God then
[1:26:29] God will have nothing to do with it
[1:26:33] alright praise the Lord what I'm trying
[1:26:35] to get to this is that we were chosen at
[1:26:37] the beginning to be predestinated unto
[1:26:39] the adoption of children we would chose
[1:26:42] to receive
[1:26:42] a place in Christ right you were not
[1:26:46] chosen just to be a church member right
[1:26:51] but you were chosen to receive a place
[1:26:53] in Christ and that place gives you
[1:26:56] authority oh my god
[1:27:00] it gives you it gives you a man
[1:27:04] it gives you a position where you don't
[1:27:06] just have to accept anything the devil
[1:27:08] puts in your direction you don't have to
[1:27:11] be defeated you don't have to be it's up
[1:27:15] to you whether you choose that or not
[1:27:16] but but but God
[1:27:17] I mean God has raised us up to a level
[1:27:19] in Christ right and we can only get here
[1:27:21] through the blood of Christ right I mean
[1:27:23] only through that blood we've been
[1:27:25] raised to level where we don't have to
[1:27:27] accept defeat and in i'ma tell you
[1:27:30] something I've been finding in my own
[1:27:33] person like that God has been allowing
[1:27:35] certain situations to come into my life
[1:27:37] and when in situations get there at 5:52
[1:27:41] speak the word it actually forces me I
[1:27:47] don't know nothing else to do I can't
[1:27:50] cry God don't want me to cry so I'm
[1:27:54] forced to actually speak and then after
[1:27:56] I speak I gotta move forward whether I
[1:28:00] feel it whether I see it or not I still
[1:28:04] got to speak it in the same way God said
[1:28:06] let there be light and there was like
[1:28:09] that I'm sure let there be this and let
[1:28:11] there be that and then it comes to pass
[1:28:15] I'm finding that in my own life if
[1:28:18] you'll even notice that even some of the
[1:28:20] sermons that God has allowing us to hear
[1:28:23] sermons that challenged us to kind of
[1:28:25] raise us up another level the octave is
[1:28:28] being raised in the believers right it's
[1:28:32] being raised in believers but you know
[1:28:34] as we start looking at this you know I
[1:28:36] was said I was just taking on this book
[1:28:38] quote here I won't pull it up but you
[1:28:40] know brother Branham was was given a
[1:28:42] Tory you know this man I had a dream say
[1:28:46] in his dream you know he had come in
[1:28:48] contact with the devil and you know you
[1:28:50] might have dreams where you'll come in
[1:28:51] contact with the devil and you got to
[1:28:53] know how to defeat them right if not
[1:28:56] not what you are going to have to
[1:28:59] overcome is how you're going to have to
[1:29:01] overcome right
[1:29:02] I mean all of us got have tests all of
[1:29:04] us going to have trials but we have to
[1:29:06] use the word of God to overcome the
[1:29:08] devil and whatever it is that he
[1:29:09] presents right so this man had this
[1:29:11] dream and in the dream and then here
[1:29:13] come the devil a cup come up to him and
[1:29:16] brother bantam say the man said in the
[1:29:17] dream that the devil yahoo and then just

[1:29:38] what to fight with I have no idea what
[1:29:41] to use to fight this devil Sam I'm
[1:29:43] facing something I never faced before

[1:29:47] dream all he saw but it was a little

[1:31:43] room not enough to receive church I'm
[1:31:54] just telling me we got to use this word
[1:31:55] and F sons and daughters of God we have
[1:31:59] the authority to use the word if we take
[1:32:04] it we use it at our disposal right we
[1:32:07] any time the devil comes you got to have
[1:32:08] something it you got to have a scripture
[1:32:10] that you can go back to say no this is
[1:32:12] what God saying I heard what you say but
[1:32:14] this is what God saying and I believe
[1:32:16] the report of the Lord all right okay
[1:32:20] Church I'm just trying to get us up to
[1:32:23] another level here just just bear with
[1:32:26] me just a little bit longer glory to God
[1:32:30] a man if you just just bear with me now
[1:32:35] when when we look at this bit chosen you
[1:32:39] know at the beginning we predict that
[1:32:42] into the adoption children again you
[1:32:44] find that in Ephesians 1 verse 1 through
[1:32:46] 14 you'll see that when brother Branham
[1:32:49] talks about the adoption a son could be
[1:32:51] born into a family and yes he was a son
[1:32:54] in that family but what needed to happen
[1:32:57] is that that boy had to mature and as he
[1:33:00] matured he got to a place where he can
[1:33:02] take on his father's business my brother
[1:33:06] Brandon would share stories like that
[1:33:07] with us and and how how Paul was just
[1:33:10] right about God has predestinated us
[1:33:12] unto the adoption or the placing of
[1:33:16] children that mean God has put us in
[1:33:18] position we're on this earth that we can
[1:33:20] one day take over the daddy's business
[1:33:24] our fathers God he has a business he
[1:33:28] wants us to take over the business that
[1:33:34] that's why you hear your daddy put you
[1:33:36] here because he wants you to take over
[1:33:39] the dismiss that that's your whole
[1:33:43] existence we're so interested in taking
[1:33:46] over from some man-made business but I'm
[1:33:50] talking about God business Lord when we
[1:33:56] get this I saved on change I think oh my
[1:33:59] god so so so listen when we talk about
[1:34:03] this choosing you know you think about
[1:34:05] somebody like David David was what we
[1:34:07] would consider chosen but when you
[1:34:09] really looked at David a man in his life
[1:34:11] nobody else thought that David was
[1:34:14] chosen said a didn't even think he was
[1:34:17] chosen his brothers didn't think that he
[1:34:20] was chosen but God had a thought about
[1:34:23] David that nobody else had oh my god I
[1:34:27] don't care how much people put you down
[1:34:30] it's not what they think is what God
[1:34:33] thinks about you Oh help us look but but
[1:34:38] when we're going to realize you know I
[1:34:40] mean David David there are watched over
[1:34:42] the Sheep in and out there with
[1:34:44] instruments and just playing music and
[1:34:46] writing the songs and doing everything
[1:34:47] that they need to do just faithfully
[1:34:49] serving the God serving God the way that
[1:34:51] he was you know the way it was in his
[1:34:53] heart and David did that was when God
[1:34:55] rejected Saul as the king he say I got
[1:34:58] me another King don't work do you stock
[1:34:59] to say Sam just stop crying over Saul I
[1:35:01] got another King already already
[1:35:03] prepared them well where is he
[1:35:05] so go down around suggester you'll find
[1:35:07] them down there so here send me
[1:35:08] encourage and I'm going to take your oil
[1:35:10] go down there and what you're gonna find
[1:35:12] the next king in Jesse's house you get
[1:35:14] down there and he starts pouring oh say
[1:35:16] say when the Prophet came here people
[1:35:19] was uh you know they were like when they
[1:35:23] saw the Prophet right they might not
[1:35:27] know what you here for you are you here
[1:35:32] for peace what why you know what what's
[1:35:36] the what's the purpose of
[1:35:37] of the profits showing up because they
[1:35:40] knew when the profit sure that people
[1:35:42] are sort of justice to the fun and games
[1:35:46] it wasn't for a picnic right I mean if
[1:35:51] this was serious distance that he was on
[1:35:55] the King's business the King of Kings so
[1:35:59] when that possibly show up and he's
[1:36:01] right what you want what you say where I
[1:36:04] come to your house doubt say the next
[1:36:06] King is here my house all right let's
[1:36:08] give us a meal together let's get the
[1:36:10] profit all fed and this is okay all
[1:36:12] right we're gonna do all that sir but
[1:36:13] but I need to see your sons say well
[1:36:16] Casey you know this is a king in my
[1:36:17] house I know it's going to be this boy
[1:36:19] right here
[1:36:20] this boy he got kingly attributes it's
[1:36:25] something about this boy I always knew
[1:36:27] it was something about this boy and
[1:36:32] profit you just coming to confirm what
[1:36:35] was in my heart you coming to confirm
[1:36:39] what was in my heart about this this boy
[1:36:44] and what I'm not here to confirm it but
[1:36:47] God is bring the boy took his oil out in
[1:36:53] the horn and start pulling nothing came
[1:36:58] out and then just you can see him maybe
[1:37:01] take some tools out start looking at the
[1:37:04] horn a little bit maybe something jammed
[1:37:06] up and hear stopping the oil from
[1:37:07] flowing nothing they push them to the
[1:37:12] side said well it must be something in
[1:37:14] his life that ain't talked to me back
[1:37:16] here come the next boy and they start
[1:37:20] pulling nothing they porn nothing six or
[1:37:24] seven boys coming and nothing so the
[1:37:29] prophecy like I know God told me to come
[1:37:31] to this house
[1:37:32] Jesse do you have any other sons why he
[1:37:37] had never introduced David didn't even
[1:37:43] consider
[1:37:46] David just like some people and
[1:37:50] introduce you yet and then considered
[1:37:53] you think they haven't considered sure
[1:37:59] they have they haven't given any thought
[1:38:01] as to who you are and here you work with
[1:38:05] them every day
[1:38:09] all right Church I'm going there and
[1:38:14] here he was you know just finished lay
[1:38:16] where I do got one more son well where
[1:38:19] is it go get him he out there watching
[1:38:22] sheep the lowest job in the house he had
[1:38:26] and here he is out there watch the cheek
[1:38:29] just doing what what he normally does
[1:38:31] and here's the right of cutting I get
[1:38:33] daddy said come home just get yourself
[1:38:34] all cleaned up and come on home I mean
[1:38:36] with you wasting everybody to just get
[1:38:37] on home what am i coming from you know
[1:38:47] just that they trying to find a king
[1:38:50] everybody already know you not the king
[1:38:53] but we're gonna appease the Prophet
[1:38:55] because maybe God meant another Jesse's
[1:38:58] house and Here Come David into the house
[1:39:04] smelling like she don't look like no
[1:39:09] King Oh God
[1:39:11] see I'm talk about ROI your research
[1:39:19] royal precent right and here here here
[1:39:24] here David David don't look to Royal but
[1:39:27] here David come walking into the house
[1:39:29] and and the Prophet get anoint yet no
[1:39:34] oil is floating nothing but he feels
[1:39:35] something in his spirit
[1:39:38] [Applause]
[1:39:43] I'm going lighthouse I mean but maybe
[1:39:49] before even picked up this his is all
[1:39:52] with the oil in of the Olaf is different
[1:39:55] all right
[1:39:56] because Dave walks in here is a beginner
[1:40:00] PO and all is all over the place they
[1:40:05] think nothing I hate it but David was
[1:40:10] Realty and they might not think anything
[1:40:19] of you but I'm here to let you know this
[1:40:22] morning that you are royalty you're part
[1:40:31] of a royal priesthood now I thought the
[1:40:38] issue is that when you think about what
[1:40:41] Peter wrote Peter says royal priesthood
[1:40:44] and the emphasis should probably be on
[1:40:48] priesthood I put it there next week but
[1:40:54] this week I'm gonna put it on Roy y'all
[1:40:59] will stay with me
[1:41:02] royal means to be tingly now what I want
[1:41:10] you to understand meaning that you're
[1:41:12] supposed to act like a king brother or
[1:41:17] sister if you hear that brother or
[1:41:22] sister you're supposed to act like a
[1:41:26] teen talk
[1:41:30] like a teen you have authority like a
[1:41:36] king
[1:41:41] a team don't ask nobody else what they
[1:41:46] think a king speaks from his own inner
[1:41:51] being and whatever Kings said it has to
[1:41:54] be exactly like the King said and that's
[1:41:58] what you say if you would say if you
[1:42:05] would say to the mountain and don't
[1:42:07] doubt in your heart it will be just like
[1:42:09] you say you know when a king speaking he
[1:42:12] establish something he just turn and
[1:42:14] walk away he not question nobody action
[1:42:19] about why you felt about that it don't
[1:42:21] matter how detail the King spoke when we
[1:42:31] talk about being a part of a royal
[1:42:34] priesthood you are supposed to be tingly
[1:42:38] and I wanna I wanna I want to make sure
[1:42:41] I emphasize that you're supposed to be
[1:42:42] King cannot not now that they got they
[1:42:44] got another part to that definition it
[1:42:46] says it means tingly or belonging to a
[1:42:50] king as its children so no matter which
[1:42:55] way it goes you can lose a king's child
[1:43:02] running from a bully the bully gonna run
[1:43:11] from the king chop the bully rise up and
[1:43:14] say boo that might be his last bow
[1:43:24] if tell us to recognize who we are we
[1:43:28] first of all nama saya I am a king I'm
[1:43:31] not just a some of the king I am 18 now
[1:43:36] I make it somebody face and there and
[1:43:38] they face it I'm not a king but I'll be
[1:43:40] the southern king that's fine you keep
[1:43:41] your favorite this but I am a king you
[1:43:44] want to know why Jesus is called the
[1:43:46] King of Kings you want to know why he's
[1:43:55] considered the King of Kings because
[1:43:59] he's got some Kings right here stop
[1:44:07] looking at everybody else's time looking
[1:44:09] at yourself King time for Kings back
[1:44:19] watch Kings walk right King
[1:44:22] talk like him all right let me let me
[1:44:32] let me just drop something here please
[1:44:34] just let me give a look quote cuz I told
[1:44:36] you I got to put emphasis in certain
[1:44:39] areas because I was told to let me read
[1:44:45] this out of revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:44:48] and before we read that give me
[1:44:52] Revelation chapter 1 verse 5 and 6 I
[1:44:56] want to read that because if you're
[1:44:59] going to start acting like a king
[1:45:00] sometimes you know you feel like I'm no
[1:45:02] king because you don't realize how
[1:45:05] powerful the blood is you don't realize
[1:45:11] how powerful the blood is it's not based
[1:45:13] on what you've done it's based on what
[1:45:16] he has already done His grace is what
[1:45:20] save you
[1:45:20] his blood is what keeps you safe look at
[1:45:25] this in Revelation 1 verse 5 and 6 we
[1:45:28] read this earlier and from Jesus Christ
[1:45:32] who is the faithful witness
[1:45:35] and the first begotten of the Dead and
[1:45:37] the Prince of the kings of the earth
[1:45:42] unto him that loved us and washed us
[1:45:48] from our sins in his own blood and
[1:45:51] brother branham say that word wash means
[1:45:53] used I mean not only have you better
[1:45:57] wash from sins but you've been loosed
[1:45:59] from seeing oh you don't you don't we
[1:46:02] don't get it yet you ain't going back to
[1:46:04] that old lifestyle you've been loosed
[1:46:06] from it and you know what the blood
[1:46:10] loosed you wash you and freed you listen
[1:46:15] say the blood loosed you from from for a
[1:46:18] looseness I wash washed us from our sins
[1:46:20] in his own blood and hath made us kings
[1:46:27] and priests so this is where we get
[1:46:31] royal priesthood so I'm going to focus
[1:46:33] on the King part and next week we'll
[1:46:35] talk about the priests but you have been
[1:46:38] made kings and priests unto God and his
[1:46:42] father to him be glory and Dominion for
[1:46:44] ever and ever amen now let's just read a
[1:46:47] little statement here from the prophet
[1:46:49] and then I'll make a few more comments
[1:46:52] and we'll come out today I just had to
[1:46:53] just set up a little foundation and make
[1:46:55] a few things and statements and
[1:46:57] hopefully it'll settle down in the city
[1:46:59] but here from this message a church age

[1:49:30] more they which receive abundance of
[1:49:33] grace and a gift and of the gift of
[1:49:36] righteousness shall reign in life by one
[1:49:37] Jesus Christ and in Colossians 1:13 who
[1:49:40] have to live in us from the power of
[1:49:43] darkness and hath translated us into the
[1:49:46] kingdom rain of his dear son let me just
[1:49:52] let me just put it there right now right
[1:49:55] now right now not not tomorrow not next
[1:50:01] week not three or four years from now
[1:50:04] right now today this moment right now we
[1:50:13] reign with Christ listen to this having
[1:50:16] dominion you control it Church having
[1:50:22] dominion over scene not only let you
[1:50:25] have dominion over the world
[1:50:28] you have dominion over your flesh I got
[1:50:36] a quote here later I read it later if I
[1:50:37] could get there he said you got you got
[1:50:39] you got you gonna be an overcomer over
[1:50:42] your fashion and over your passion
[1:50:46] [Applause]
[1:50:49] you have a compassion in fashion oh you
[1:51:00] ain't gonna be like the other ones cuz
[1:51:03] your royal priesthood a holy nation a
[1:51:07] peculiar people you can overcome fashion
[1:51:14] and passion because you got control over
[1:51:21] a king a king don't say I just can't get
[1:51:25] control over this brother Jack when you
[1:51:27] King Kings got control King tears
[1:51:35] himself differently he acts differently
[1:51:38] he you know when a person has a certain
[1:51:44] level of authority they don't bring
[1:51:47] themselves down to a lower level do you
[1:51:50] you have to get up where they are I mean
[1:51:54] they know they know where they look at
[1:51:56] you and what the only some stuff you
[1:52:00] don't even respond to because you had a
[1:52:05] certain level oh my god
[1:52:11] and I ain't right you get to this level
[1:52:14] when you truly bit loose from your sins
[1:52:17] this is what it'll bring you right now
[1:52:24] we reign with Christ having dominion
[1:52:29] over sin the world the flesh is it one
[1:52:36] more there you got dominion over the
[1:52:42] devil
[1:52:43] [Music]
[1:52:46] you understand that that means that mean
[1:52:49] you order the devil what to do if you
[1:52:55] tell the devil no it's closed and it's
[1:52:59] not no less can we negotiate can we huh
[1:53:02] oh no you took it to a king somebody
[1:53:06] take your hat off if you treat the king
[1:53:09] room y'all know that's what that man did
[1:53:13] when David got spit on he say you gonna
[1:53:18] let that take don't talk to you like
[1:53:21] that I'll take your head off man if if
[1:53:24] angels that wanna fight for King they
[1:53:33] just wait until your world is angels
[1:53:36] wanna fight the Kings do you realize
[1:53:52] when Jesus was at the cross you know
[1:53:55] brother BAM say all I had to was not his
[1:53:57] hat and the Angels would have changed
[1:54:00] the whole thing a king has to keep his
[1:54:06] control have to keep his composure and
[1:54:09] specially when he knows what the will of
[1:54:10] the father is but a king understands how
[1:54:14] much power he had that's why careful
[1:54:19] with his word because he realized how
[1:54:22] much powers in the worst see as
[1:54:29] spiritual Kings you have spiritual power
[1:54:31] jesus has so much power that he could
[1:54:33] just say no man eat from this tree no
[1:54:36] more and the power that came out of his
[1:54:41] words caused a tree within 24 hours to
[1:54:45] shrivel up and just died
[1:54:51] and that's the God that lives inside of
[1:54:54] you and what I'm telling you is I wish I
[1:55:01] could just I I wish I could put this on
[1:55:03] the mirror of your car and the mirror in
[1:55:06] your house right now I can we just read
[1:55:16] this again right now we we rang
[1:55:20] let's read it together on the count of
[1:55:23] three one two three right now
[1:55:27] we reign with Christ having dominion
[1:55:30] over sin the world the flesh and the
[1:55:34] devil
[1:55:35] Oh glory to God showing forth its praise
[1:55:47] and glory showing forth himself for it
[1:55:48] is Christ and less willing and doing of
[1:55:50] his good pleasure yes indeed even now we
[1:55:54] are seated in heavenly places in Christ
[1:55:56] Jesus now I'm gonna stop right there
[1:56:01] because the rest of that is talking
[1:56:03] about priests next week we'll talk about
[1:56:05] priests I bring that same quote right
[1:56:08] back around the whole pool because I
[1:56:11] want that to really register right now
[1:56:16] now that that puts you in a different
[1:56:19] category because you know you've always
[1:56:22] talked about being a son of a king
[1:56:23] that's true that's true
[1:56:26] but you know the son of the king when
[1:56:29] the King passes on becomes
[1:56:38] and I'm gonna tell you another thing
[1:56:41] sometime the King know has to be dead
[1:56:43] before his son become king did not
[1:56:48] Salomon become King before David died
[1:56:59] well I just begin to think to myself if
[1:57:03] we are Kings there's certain conduct
[1:57:07] that we should have his Kings certain
[1:57:12] conduct and I'm uh just put this in
[1:57:20] because I just went back to some quotes
[1:57:22] here from from prophet and and one one
[1:57:27] statement that he'd made and I'll read
[1:57:29] this one this is out of the message I'm
[1:57:31] welcome Christ never got some more time
[1:57:34] just a little bit more time I mean
[1:57:37] because what you find if when a man
[1:57:41] recognizes that he's King I made the
[1:57:43] statement even though he is a great man
[1:57:45] he makes others feel greater because he
[1:57:54] knows who he is and since I know who I
[1:57:57] am I don't have to act down I'm gonna
[1:58:00] make you feel a little bit bad about
[1:58:01] yourself
[1:58:02] oh my you understand
[1:58:06] look at this unwelcome Christ you says
[1:58:07] and you call yourself a Christian and so
[1:58:11] starchy you can reach down to shake
[1:58:14] hands with a beggar on the street and
[1:58:17] talk to him about the Lord you call
[1:58:21] yourself a Christian oh you're so good
[1:58:24] find out there ain't much good about us
[1:58:26] when you think of him becoming a foot
[1:58:28] wash flunky flunky the Lord's there was
[1:58:30] he really in heart was the highest there
[1:58:33] was he was the heart of God and become
[1:58:35] the lowest-paid foot wash flunking him
[1:58:38] he who gave who was great become to know
[1:58:41] that he might redeem you back to make
[1:58:43] you great you know what I've noticed
[1:58:48] this in my travels you usually find
[1:58:50] great men are
[1:58:51] little man I go around where there's
[1:58:56] great men really great men and I know
[1:58:58] they're great man but when I start to
[1:59:00] lead them they make you think you're the
[1:59:02] great man they ain't nothing but to take
[1:59:06] a little 2x4 don't know nothing he
[1:59:10] thinks he's all of it he ain't nothing
[1:59:14] to begin with it's a great man our
[1:59:18] little man
[1:59:20] they never brag or take honor they make
[1:59:25] you feel that you're great there that's
[1:59:28] great man and here the greatest of man
[1:59:31] the greatest of all men God manifested
[1:59:34] in flesh become a foot wash flunky with
[1:59:38] humility the king of all eternity all
[1:59:42] glory the creative heavens and earth
[1:59:43] washed the dung off of men's feet
[1:59:50] churches something about a real king the
[1:59:54] great man a king is the highest
[1:59:57] authority in the kingdom and when that
[2:00:00] man he reaches that point he's so
[2:00:02] humbled by it right that it makes him
[2:00:05] treat everybody else as if they're
[2:00:06] greater than he is oh my say I mean we
[2:00:11] come all to it realize who we are now
[2:00:12] there's some actions that should come
[2:00:15] out of this of recognizing who you are
[2:00:20] King is the final authority I mentioned
[2:00:24] earlier you know but I'll just I'll just
[2:00:28] I'll throw this in you know they thought
[2:00:30] to kill Jesus they sought to kill Moses
[2:00:32] and and the reason that they did that
[2:00:34] because of the kings of that day put out
[2:00:37] an edict that they had to kill these
[2:00:38] babies two years old and under the the
[2:00:40] the male babies that was the Kings eat
[2:00:42] it they had to execute a lot of children
[2:00:45] died a lot of them died right because
[2:00:47] the King said so in the days of Daniel
[2:00:49] the reason Daniel went into the Lions
[2:00:51] dens because of what the King signed
[2:00:55] right he could pray to any other god but
[2:00:57] the king and because of Kings eating
[2:01:00] Daniel end up in the lion's den but that
[2:01:02] same king was praying all night today
[2:01:05] God brought them out hallelujah
[2:01:08] I was thinking about another nother
[2:01:10] edict from a king one time the king
[2:01:12] couldn't sleep and he started reading
[2:01:17] through some old books and after to pick
[2:01:21] up a book just one of the books as we
[2:01:25] pick it up the book he was reading how
[2:01:26] somebody had uncovered a plan of how his
[2:01:29] life was about me taking it and and then
[2:01:31] this man you know there's this man
[2:01:32] uncovered it but the man was never
[2:01:34] rewarded and it so so so he sitting
[2:01:37] there thinking couldn't go to sleep that
[2:01:38] night just reading through this book and
[2:01:40] then all of a sudden that man's enemy
[2:01:44] walked into the King's presence and his
[2:01:49] enemy was coming in with a certain
[2:01:51] desire he wanted to kill the man that
[2:01:53] was not rewarded Haman wanted to kill
[2:01:56] Mordecai all right so the king the king
[2:02:00] before before Haman could get the words
[2:02:02] others must he say says he said you say
[2:02:04] Haman Haman I get before your famous
[2:02:05] sake let me say this what should we do
[2:02:08] for a man that is some distance on that
[2:02:10] clock King so if the man has done this
[2:02:13] has done that for a king we ought to put
[2:02:14] that man on a horse and we ought to walk
[2:02:16] through the city and we are that we
[2:02:18] ought to say this is what the King does
[2:02:20] to those that honor the king and Haman
[2:02:23] say I know oh boy I'm giving to get some
[2:02:25] armor I'm get ready to get up on a horse
[2:02:28] and they go on bow down to me finally
[2:02:30] I'm gonna get this guy Mordecai to bow
[2:02:32] because the king and the King herds
[2:02:42] they're all that the fastest that's a
[2:02:44] great idea
[2:02:45] say Haman yes sir do that for Mordecai
[2:02:52] and because the King said it there was
[2:02:56] no discussion
[2:03:02] you realize I don't care how upset Haman
[2:03:05] was the king had made a statement and
[2:03:10] you know what from my understanding from
[2:03:13] reading scripture it was only them to
[2:03:15] their one whole bunch of other people in
[2:03:18] that room just them to maybe some people
[2:03:21] maybe somebody might have heard a little
[2:03:22] stuff but Haman knew don't go against
[2:03:24] what the king say hey me when I got that
[2:03:30] horse put more to cow on top of it and
[2:03:34] start riding through the city this is
[2:03:36] what the King does to those that honor
[2:03:38] him but God know how to make your
[2:03:42] enemies your footstool if you just allow
[2:03:51] him to and you just keep reading him a
[2:03:57] story didn't end up that well it changed
[2:04:02] in one night Oh God is a good God all
[2:04:07] those things happened to Haman because
[2:04:08] of the Kings eat it a king looks good
[2:04:16] even when he feels bad I want to say it
[2:04:24] again a king looks good even when he
[2:04:30] feels bad
[2:04:34] all right i'ma read the quote for you
[2:04:36] because you don't believe me you don't
[2:04:39] believe me now notice the sermon town
[2:04:44] perfection bullying this quote from the
[2:04:49] sermon title perfection so you gotta act
[2:04:52] perfect even though you'll feel perfect
[2:04:54] you gotta act that way it don't you
[2:04:56] don't you don't feel good
[2:04:58] but just do I mean he looks good even
[2:05:00] when he feels bad look at this look at
[2:05:02] this says here's some time ago when mr.
[2:05:05] Baxter was my manager when the king of
[2:05:07] England when when when we was there to
[2:05:11] visit when the Queen come out lovely
[2:05:13] lady her pretty
[2:05:14] roboam her graying hair and the king
[2:05:17] setting so thick at the time he could
[2:05:20] hardly stand it he had a stomach trouble
[2:05:23] and multiple sclerosis that was just
[2:05:26] before he was prayed for that means he
[2:05:28] had it but he got delivered from it
[2:05:30] right says but he could he could hardly
[2:05:32] stand up but yet the royal blood but yet
[2:05:38] the royal blood of him stuck what little
[2:05:42] chessy hat out and he rolled down the
[2:05:45] street in the carriage mr. Baxter
[2:05:48] standing there and when he passed I
[2:05:50] looked at him his lips was quivering the
[2:05:52] tears was running down his cheek
[2:05:54] he put his big arm around me and said
[2:05:55] brother Brandon I said yes sir brother
[2:05:57] Baxter
[2:05:58] he said you know I'm a Canadian yes he
[2:06:00] said that man who's over our land the
[2:06:03] king him and his lovely bride and wife
[2:06:04] is passing by that's where that's where
[2:06:07] that's where I can't hold my emotions I
[2:06:10] have to give vent he just start crying
[2:06:13] says I put my arm around him I said
[2:06:16] brother back so as a Christian with you
[2:06:17] what will it be some glorious thing when
[2:06:20] the King comes with his bride if a man
[2:06:23] could think that when seeing an earthly
[2:06:25] king which is more like we are what will
[2:06:28] it be when we see the King of Kings
[2:06:29] coming in glory
[2:06:30] what a glorious time it'll be so even
[2:06:34] when a king feels bad he still looks
[2:06:37] good I'm going back to the definition
[2:06:48] I'm a king I'm also the son of a king
[2:06:52] royal means King Lee or belonging to the
[2:06:56] king as its children so if your royal
[2:07:00] then you also have certain conduct and
[2:07:05] brother branham told us another story
[2:07:11] this fella was brought over on some
[2:07:17] ships he was forced out of his country
[2:07:23] came here to the US not on his own wheel
[2:07:28] but he got here but still knew who he
[2:07:32] was
[2:07:34] brother branham tells us the story of
[2:07:37] this man since when he got here this man
[2:07:43] you know what they put him on the block
[2:07:46] to be sold as a slave and and they you
[2:07:49] know they the first owner got him and
[2:07:51] everything like that and said now other
[2:07:53] people come by and try to buy some of
[2:07:55] the other slaves you know they try to
[2:07:57] buy and they when the first owner got
[2:07:58] ahold of this man he say I ain't never
[2:08:00] selling this man I'm not doing it
[2:08:02] hey well say okay and now he said he
[2:08:05] said he said he noticed that when this
[2:08:07] boy no matter what his condition was
[2:08:09] because see the thing of it is is a king
[2:08:11] has the whole hold his head up and dire
[2:08:14] situations dire circumstances the king
[2:08:20] keeps his head up high no matter what
[2:08:23] condition he's in this is how the King
[2:08:26] walks you never know when the king going
[2:08:29] through cause he looked the same he is
[2:08:31] the same yesterday today and forever so
[2:08:36] that's what was in dire situations he
[2:08:38] happened to be the son of a king so here
[2:08:41] he is you know
[2:08:42] sold into slavery and and and the owner
[2:08:45] some same every day he had a certain
[2:08:47] aura about him that even encourage the
[2:08:49] other slaves it's just something about
[2:08:52] having that that fell around and and
[2:08:54] saying that as they were you know as
[2:08:56] they would I come I mean different
[2:08:57] people different owners would come they
[2:08:59] want to buy some of the safe they say
[2:09:01] well we want to buy that one right
[2:09:02] there's none he not for sale just no he
[2:09:05] not for sale
[2:09:06] no he not for sale no don't even try
[2:09:08] downtick how much money you got to offer
[2:09:10] that one is not for sale so when it's
[2:09:13] one it's one people actually not why why
[2:09:15] is he so different they do you feed them
[2:09:17] differences no he eat just like the rest
[2:09:19] of you treat them differently I treat
[2:09:22] them just like I treat the rest
[2:09:24] well why is he so special why is he so
[2:09:27] precious why say I had the same question
[2:09:36] I had the same question I had to start
[2:09:39] because when I saw him act the way he
[2:09:40] was that guy I couldn't understand
[2:09:42] because everybody else look upset by
[2:09:43] their conditions but this one no matter
[2:09:45] what his condition was he still kept the
[2:09:47] same outlook knowing he would never go
[2:09:51] back home again but yet he still had a
[2:09:54] certain aura not an attitude alright not
[2:10:07] an attitude alright
[2:10:12] it's act I asked one day I start asking
[2:10:15] around so what was the difference with
[2:10:17] this felling they told me it's that he
[2:10:20] happens to be the son of a king and it
[2:10:24] realized that he's royalty and say since
[2:10:27] he's the son of a king he has to act
[2:10:29] like the son of a king even though he'll
[2:10:33] never see his father again he's still
[2:10:34] gonna act like royalty right here so if
[2:10:38] you haven't made it to the point in this
[2:10:40] message yet to realize that you a king
[2:10:41] you still some of the king and you still
[2:10:44] gotta act like royalty
[2:10:51] you got to conduct yourself like royalty
[2:10:54] because you are part of a royal
[2:10:56] priesthood and the emphasis today is on
[2:11:00] royal because he's made you a king and a
[2:11:07] priest
[2:11:07] let me just read just a few more things
[2:11:10] from here now I'll let it go glory to
[2:11:14] God
[2:11:15] alright alright alright making away and
[2:11:19] then Jehovah Jireh says this here's some
[2:11:25] time ago down the Southlands there was
[2:11:27] people used to go by and buy slaves and
[2:11:29] so forth I just happened to think of
[2:11:31] this little store and they went by with
[2:11:33] by slaves date notice two poor fellows
[2:11:35] had been beat they they hate
[2:11:37] to lead the country and they know they'd
[2:11:39] never be back the negative people it was
[2:11:41] pitiful how they was treated one day
[2:11:43] they happened to notice one young fellow
[2:11:45] with his shoulder throw back I didn't
[2:11:48] bring this quote where brother Brandon
[2:11:49] say as a Christian you could never
[2:11:50] believe in slavery as a Christian never
[2:11:54] right so I said it was pitiful how they
[2:11:57] was treated had to be I have to beat him
[2:11:59] no sir somebody come by said let me buy
[2:12:01] that slave he said he's not for sale he
[2:12:03] said well what makes him so much
[2:12:05] different he is either boss who arrested
[2:12:06] him said no so what makes him different
[2:12:08] do you do you do you let him eat better
[2:12:10] no he eats with the rest of them what
[2:12:12] makes him so different said I happen to
[2:12:14] learn that his father is a king of the
[2:12:17] tribe though he's in a far land he still
[2:12:20] throws his shoulders back he's a royal
[2:12:22] born man his dad is a king though he's
[2:12:27] an alien his father is a king let me go
[2:12:33] to Jehovah Jireh and I'm just reading a
[2:12:39] portion of this one because he says this
[2:12:42] what are our what are all our conduct to
[2:12:47] be and he was what I'm bringing is the
[2:12:51] end of the this thought he was talking
[2:12:53] about the same young man that wasn't
[2:12:55] African that brought in as a slave he's
[2:12:58] talking about that in Jehovah Jireh but
[2:13:00] I'm just bringing in the end of that
[2:13:01] quote says what are all our conduct to
[2:13:03] be not like the world but we should act
[2:13:07] like sons and daughters of God conduct
[2:13:11] ourselves like Kings children not like
[2:13:14] slaves of fashions and slaves of passion
[2:13:21] and slaves of pride we should be sons
[2:13:27] and daughters of God and act like it and
[2:13:31] conduct ourselves that way let our
[2:13:35] conversations and everything be seasoned
[2:13:38] with God's Spirit
[2:13:45] as you can see your conversations with
[2:13:48] other things but you want to see it with
[2:13:53] God's Spirit I am talking to Kings a
[2:13:57] royal priesthood God richly bless you
[2:14:04] amen let's have the musicians come and
[2:14:14] we'll have a word of Prayer my god
[2:14:18] father sometimes you just want us to
[2:14:24] really think on what you have called us
[2:14:28] to father we are not just not just
[2:14:36] children of the king but you have made
[2:14:39] us kings and priests the Prophet told us
[2:14:45] that there are certain truths that need
[2:14:48] emphasis and it said this is one of
[2:14:53] those truths that need emphasis that we
[2:14:55] have been made kings and priests with
[2:15:00] royalty not going to be right now we are
[2:15:08] royalty god I pray for myself
