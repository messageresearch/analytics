[25:11] Lord God, you have made provisions for
[25:14] us to make it into the house of the Lord
[25:16] that we may gather together in your holy
[25:18] name. And Father, you said wherever two
[25:20] or three are gathered in my name, I will
[25:22] be in the midst. So, we're grateful for
[25:24] your presence, Lord Jesus. We're
[25:27] grateful for the saints, Lord Jesus. You
[25:29] have blessed them and kept them
[25:31] throughout the week, Lord Jesus. And
[25:33] Lord, you're just so good to us. And
[25:35] father, many of us, Lord, our brothers
[25:37] and sisters have traveled to South

[25:43] almighty God, you have blessed their
[25:45] union. Father, we pray, Lord, that

[25:51] baby be well at the time of delivery,
[25:54] Lord. And may you keep them safe, Lord
[25:56] Jesus. Father, we pray for our
[25:58] ministering brothers, Lord Jesus. We
[26:00] want to keep them ever before you, Lord.
[26:02] Father, how they labor to bring your
[26:04] truth to your people. They labor to hear
[26:06] from heaven, Lord God, to get a message,
[26:09] Lord, to feed the sheep of God, Lord,
[26:11] that we all may come to perfection,
[26:13] Lord. We all want a closer walk with
[26:15] you, Lord. And we know faith cometh by
[26:17] hearing, hearing by the word. So as the
[26:19] word is ministered to us, Lord, Father,
[26:21] we draw closer to you, Lord. We want
[26:24] more of you. We need you, Lord. We we
[26:26] want, Lord God, a overflow of your
[26:28] presence in our lives, Lord. We need a
[26:31] refilling of the Holy Ghost this
[26:32] morning, Lord Jesus. Lord, we emptied
[26:35] out all week, Lord, that we may have
[26:37] more of you. Continue to use us, Father.
[26:40] We pray over the giving, almighty God.
[26:42] Lord, as you have blessed the people,
[26:43] Lord Jesus, we want to return to you the
[26:46] portion, Lord God, that you allotted.
[26:48] Not only that, Lord, we want to give
[26:49] from our hearts, Lord, that it may be a
[26:52] blessing to both you and to the kingdom
[26:53] of Almighty God. Father, continue to
[26:56] have your way in this service. Bless our
[26:57] brother as he prepares to bring the
[27:00] message this morning. Anoint him aresh
[27:01] Lord. Use him, strengthen him, Lord God
[27:04] to deliver his heart, Lord. What you
[27:06] have placed inside, Lord. May it come
[27:08] forth to our ears and go down to our
[27:10] hearts, Lord, that we all may be one in
[27:13] you. We love you, Father. We commit
[27:15] ourselves, the remainder of the service,
[27:16] into your hands. It's in Jesus Christ's

[34:15] Blessed be his holy name.
[34:18] Thank you Jesus.
[34:22] Oh, glory to God.
[34:25] Glory to God. Amen. You can be seated in
[34:28] the presence of the Lord.
[34:32] Certainly uh good to be in the house of
[34:35] God
[34:36] uh on this morning. Amen. Just keep
[34:39] playing softly.
[34:41] Yeah. Just keep playing softly.
[34:44] Amen. Y'all can join in just softly
[34:48] here. Amen. He's worthy to be praised.
[34:53] He's worthy to be praised.
[34:57] We worship him in the good times.
[35:01] We worship him in the bad times.
[35:05] David said, "I will bless the Lord at
[35:08] all times. His phrases shall continually
[35:14] be in my mouth.
[35:16] Glory to God. You know, it takes
[35:19] something to be able to write something
[35:21] like that in scripture,
[35:23] you know. And when you look back on the
[35:25] life of David and many of the things
[35:27] that he faced,
[35:29] um I mean completely forgotten about by
[35:32] his own daddy
[35:34] when the prophet came to the house and
[35:36] say who uh the Lord told me to come and
[35:39] anoint one of your sons to be the king
[35:41] and and and that oil didn't come out on
[35:43] nobody. And the prophet had to ask, "Is
[35:46] there at least just one more boy that
[35:48] you got?" And um there, you know, the
[35:51] father said, "Yeah, I got one more." But
[35:52] if the oil ain't came out on none of
[35:54] these, it ain't coming out on him. I
[35:56] know that much. And David showed up and
[35:59] my God did that oil pour
[36:02] uh all over him.
[36:05] But even after an experience like that,
[36:07] he still found himself running through
[36:08] caves and sleeping in caves and and
[36:12] running from Saul and just all kind of
[36:13] things. he was going through. But rather
[36:16] than complain about all the stuff that
[36:18] he was facing,
[36:20] David said, "His praise shall
[36:22] continually
[36:24] be in my mouth."
[36:27] Amen. My soul shall make her boast in
[36:29] the Lord. The humble shall hear thereof
[36:32] and be glad. Then David said one other
[36:34] thing there. It says, "Oh,
[36:37] magnify
[36:39] the Lord with me and let us exalt his
[36:42] name together.
[36:45] Blessed be the name of the Lord."
[36:48] Amen. Amen. Turn around and tell your
[36:51] neighbor, say, "Neighbor, you going to
[36:52] praise him with me?" Neighbor, you going
[36:55] to praise him with me?
[36:58] Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[37:01] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[37:05] We thank God. We thank God. I um um as
[37:10] brother Solomon was saying, we had a
[37:13] number of saints go up uh to South
[37:16] Carolina. Brother Steven and Sister
[37:18] Rachel uh had their
[37:22] um
[37:24] uh the baby shower and then as well as
[37:26] the gender reveal they did on yesterday
[37:29] and uh a number of the saints went up.
[37:32] So, we thank God for that. pray that
[37:33] they'll have traveling mercies coming
[37:35] back. Um, and that is probably where I
[37:40] would have been this morning uh on my
[37:43] way back home. But um, the Lord did
[37:46] something a little different uh for us.
[37:49] My uncle
[37:51] was uh called home uh to be with the
[37:54] Lord, Reverend William Henry Burs, and
[37:58] they had his uh service on yesterday.
[38:00] And for my uncle actually uh yesterday
[38:03] would have been his birthday. Uh I think
[38:06] he would have turned 86
[38:09] I believe was either 85 or 86. But uh
[38:12] but uh they buried him on his on his
[38:14] birthday there and and I wanted to just
[38:17] uh thank the church. I know my wife put
[38:19] something out for the sisters and and u
[38:21] many of you all just stepped up. Those
[38:23] that even weren't going to be able to be
[38:25] there, they still gave money towards it
[38:27] and it it was it went a long way. So, we
[38:30] want to just thank you all for your
[38:31] assistance and and helping us as we
[38:34] buried him uh on on yesterday. Uh and
[38:37] last week, uh we had a little rehearsal
[38:39] because usually we get a family together
[38:41] and we'll try to do a song or a couple
[38:43] songs and and um Brother Jerry just
[38:47] wanted to thank God for him. He came to
[38:49] open up the church and and just run the
[38:51] sound for me while we were just trying
[38:53] to get things all situated uh uh with
[38:56] with with with them. He was listening to
[38:58] my family sing and he's like, "Brother
[39:00] Jack, I didn't know." I said, "Yeah,
[39:02] they they they can they can do a little
[39:04] bit, but just want to get them all
[39:06] serving the Lord."
[39:08] Uh if we got them serving the Lord, we
[39:10] might be some damage to the devil's
[39:12] kingdom. But uh but we just thank God,
[39:15] amen, for all things and and and and uh
[39:19] appreciate all the help and all the
[39:20] assistance, amen, over uh this past
[39:24] couple weeks. Amen. Uh, I had a
[39:27] something that I just uh read here and I
[39:32] wanted to read it uh real quick. Uh, I
[39:35] want to go to Nehemiah uh 9. Um,
[39:42] and I just want to read a quick
[39:43] scripture uh verse 19. I'm not going to
[39:46] preach today. I, you know, I was
[39:47] scheduled to be away. So, Brother Jerry
[39:50] was scheduled to preach and um uh so
[39:54] even though I'm here, he's still going
[39:55] to preach. But, uh I last night I was I
[39:59] was after yesterday, I don't know what
[40:01] happened, but last night I I just really
[40:03] start going through a little bit there
[40:04] in my body. And um for some reason, my
[40:09] um I've been dealing with a little issue
[40:11] with my ankle for the last couple
[40:13] months. And last night, I was just
[40:15] having some problems, some real
[40:17] problems. and um couldn't get
[40:20] comfortable to sleep. I mean, it was
[40:21] just it was something else. Thank God
[40:23] for my wife just helping with everything
[40:26] uh she could to try to try to keep me
[40:28] going. And uh but this morning, I
[40:30] happened to read something in the Bible
[40:34] that um when I read it, I I I I took
[40:39] claim for my my body. Amen. and I took
[40:43] claim here in Nehemiah uh chapter 9 uh
[40:47] verse 19
[40:52] [Music]
[40:54] um actually um verse 18 yay when they
[40:58] had made them a molten calf and said
[41:02] this is thy God that brought thee up out
[41:05] of Egypt and had wrought
[41:07] great provocations yet thou in thy
[41:10] manifold mercies
[41:12] forsookst them not in the wilderness
[41:16] uh the pillar of cloud departed not from
[41:18] them by day to lead them in the way
[41:20] neither the pillar of fire by night to
[41:23] show them light in the way wherein they
[41:26] should go. Thou gavest
[41:29] um thou gavest also thy good spirit to
[41:32] instruct them and withheldest not thy
[41:35] mana from their mouth and gavest them
[41:38] water for their thirst. Yay. 40 years
[41:42] did did thou sustain them in the
[41:45] wilderness so that they lacked
[41:49] nothing.
[41:51] This is the God we serve. You're not
[41:53] supposed to lack anything.
[41:55] So that they lack nothing. And look at
[41:57] this. Their clothes wax not old and
[42:02] their feet
[42:04] swell not.
[42:07] And that's 40 years now. So when I saw
[42:10] that, I said, "I ain't accepting this. I
[42:13] I'm not accepting this." I mean, they
[42:15] went 40 years, over two million people,
[42:19] and never even had a aching foot.
[42:23] Brother, I say the devil is a liar. And
[42:27] and and I know my God is the same
[42:28] yesterday, today, and forever. So, uh,
[42:31] whatever this swelling is, it's got to
[42:33] go down.
[42:35] Hey, it's got to go.
[42:39] It's got to go. I mean, it God is
[42:41] concerned about your foot.
[42:45] Everything God is concerned about,
[42:47] right? So, man, I ran into that. I said,
[42:49] "I ain't accepting this at all. I'm I if
[42:52] they didn't have no swelling feet, I
[42:53] ain't going to have no swelling feet
[42:55] either." So, praise his holy name. Thank
[42:58] God for my healing.
[43:02] Amen. And I was encouraged by the word
[43:04] of the Lord. Amen. Amen. Amen. God is
[43:07] good. God is good. Well, let us Amen. Um
[43:11] prepare to welcome Brother Jerry. Amen.
[43:15] To the uh pull pit on this morning. I
[43:19] know that uh God has a word for us.
[43:23] Amen. God will bless us. We thank God
[43:26] for all our brothers who help out here
[43:28] in ministry. Um, few weeks ago we had
[43:31] brother Mark on a Wednesday night. Then
[43:33] we had brother Quinton having a little
[43:35] series there on a Wednesday night. Now
[43:37] we got brother Jerry and Amen. You heard
[43:40] brother Quaker. You'll be hearing from
[43:41] Brother Smiley soon. So uh we try to get
[43:44] them all in where we can. Uh but we
[43:46] appreciate the help that God has given
[43:48] to us here at Spirit and Truth
[43:49] Tabernacle. Amen. Let's go back to
[43:52] Amazing Grace. Amen. And let's stand to
[43:54] our feet and uh welcome Amen. Brother
[43:57] Jerry as he comes.
[44:01] in grace.
[44:04] Oh, how sweet
[44:09] the sound
[44:13] that saved
[44:18] a rich
[44:22] like me.
[44:28] Oh,
[44:30] I once
[44:34] was lost.
[44:37] Oh, but
[44:39] now
[44:41] [Music]
[45:02] Praise the Lord. God bless you all this
[45:04] morning.
[45:07] You know, that's a hymn that you can
[45:09] never get tired of singing because it
[45:11] was amazing grace that saved a wretch
[45:13] like me. And we just want to thank God
[45:16] that we can all be recipients of his
[45:18] love this morning. Praise the Lord. Let
[45:21] us bow in a word of prayer before we get
[45:23] into the word.
[45:24] [Music]
[45:26] Oh heavenly father
[45:28] Jesus, we thank you God for your grace
[45:31] and your mercy.
[45:33] Oh father god as it was said earlier
[45:35] Lord David said oh magnify the Lord with
[45:38] me and let us exalt his name together.
[45:42] Father God your name deserves to be
[45:45] exalted Lord because it is by your name
[45:47] we are here. Father, you have found a
[45:50] people, Lord, that was not worthy, but
[45:52] God, you gave them your name, Lord. That
[45:55] God, by your name, Father, we can go
[45:57] forth and conquer. And Lord, we thank
[46:00] you this morning that you have set us
[46:02] into a place that you said wherever two
[46:04] or three are gathered, you would be
[46:05] there. So, Father God, I pray that you
[46:08] would be pleased, Lord, with what we are
[46:10] have we have done so far, Lord. And that
[46:13] you would have the preeminence in this
[46:15] part of the service, Lord, that your
[46:17] word would speak forth life into every
[46:19] every vessel, Lord. That Father, you
[46:22] would prepare a a people, a bride for
[46:24] the rapture. Oh Lord, help us, Father,
[46:27] to see you in everything that you're
[46:29] doing even right now. We thank you. We
[46:31] ask your blessings on all things. In the
[46:33] name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray.
[46:35] Amen. Praise the Lord. Thank you,
[46:38] musicians.
[46:40] Uh this morning we will turn our Bibles
[46:43] to a few scripture reading. Uh we'll
[46:47] start with the book of Hebrews. Hebrews
[46:49] chapter 11
[46:51] and the third verse.
[46:54] As brother Jack was saying, uh you know,
[46:57] we are certainly very blessed in this
[46:59] season. Uh very very happy that we've
[47:02] gotten a chance to hear all the
[47:03] brothers. uh you know just it's it's
[47:06] something you know when you have to come
[47:08] behind the word behind the pulpit but to
[47:10] hear the brothers it's been a real
[47:12] blessing and I believe the uh book of
[47:15] Joel said we will eat in plenty.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; So we have been eating in plenty
[47:20] &gt;&gt; I hope you guys have as well.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hebrews 11:3
[47:25] it says, "Through faith we understand
[47:30] that the worlds were framed by the word
[47:33] of God so that things which are seen
[47:37] were not made of things which do
[47:39] appear." Amen. And we will turn in
[47:42] Genesis chapter 2 verse 4.
[47:56] Amen. And it reads, "These are the
[47:59] generations of the heavens and of the
[48:03] earth when they were created. And the
[48:06] day that they that the Lord God made the
[48:08] earth and the heavens, and every plant
[48:10] of the field before it was on the earth,
[48:13] and every herb of the field before it
[48:15] grew. For the Lord God had not caused it
[48:17] to rain upon the earth, and there was
[48:19] not a man to till the ground. But there
[48:22] went up a mist from the earth, and
[48:24] watered the whole face of the ground.
[48:25] And the Lord God formed man of the dust
[48:28] of the ground, and breathed into his
[48:30] nostrils the breath of life, and man
[48:33] became a living soul. And just one more
[48:35] place here, Genesis
[48:38] 127.
[48:40] Praise the Lord.
[48:43] back a few pages and it reads, "So God
[48:47] created man in his own image, and the
[48:50] image of God created he him, male and
[48:54] female created he them. And God blessed
[48:57] them. And God said unto them, "Be
[48:59] fruitful and multiply, and replenish the
[49:02] earth, and subdue it, and have dominion
[49:04] over the fish of the sea, and over the
[49:07] fowl of the air, and over every living
[49:09] thing that moveth upon the earth." You
[49:12] may have your seats. May the Lord add a
[49:15] blessing to his reading. Praise God. So
[49:19] this morning, if we could use as a title
[49:22] and subject, we want to just speak on
[49:25] the highest form of creation.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; The highest form of creation. And as a
[49:30] subject, we want to use speaking terms
[49:33] with God.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; Speaking terms with God. And I just
[49:37] trust that this morning we have all come
[49:41] to this place and we are all in speaking
[49:44] terms with God.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Uh so we we read there
[49:48] in Hebrews chap 11 uh it says through
[49:51] faith we understand that the worlds were
[49:54] framed by the word of God. And I just
[49:57] want you to know this morning that a lot
[49:59] was involved in creating this world. The
[50:03] word that we see today, a lot got into
[50:06] place to it. God was very thoughtful
[50:08] about his creation. Praise God. Amen.
[50:11] And and we we see the principles of
[50:14] mechanics. We see uh dynamics in almost
[50:17] every law of nature. Praise God. But you
[50:21] see in the creation, God had a purpose
[50:24] that he would have his mechanics and
[50:26] dynamics in his church.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; The prophet says something here. He says
[50:31] we have so much of the mechanics
[50:34] &gt;&gt; and not the dynamics.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; Now my body is the mechanics but my body
[50:40] will not operate without the dynamics.
[50:42] The spirit and the spirit operates my
[50:45] body. It brings it into control.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; And you see the reason why the mechanic
[50:49] the dynam dynamics are so important is
[50:52] because we need something to bring our
[50:55] body into subjection of the word of God.
[50:58] Praise the Lord. And the spirit of God
[51:00] is the only thing that can do that.
[51:02] Amen.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And you see back in the back
[51:06] in Genesis, we read just the generations
[51:08] of the heavens and earth. And I like
[51:11] this because in verse 7, it says, "And
[51:13] the Lord God formed man out of the dust
[51:15] of the ground and breathed into his
[51:17] nostrils the breath of life and man
[51:19] became a living soul."
[51:21] One translation says that uh God
[51:23] breathed into his nostrils the spirit of
[51:26] life and man became a speaking spirit.
[51:30] Praise God.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; So you see you have an original purpose.
[51:35] God made you from a certain material.
[51:37] Amen.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; And that material is for you to operate.
[51:41] For you to bring your situation, your
[51:44] conditions, your atmosphere into
[51:46] subjection. Amen. And it says, "Man
[51:50] became a speaking spirit."
[51:53] &gt;&gt; The prophet says here in the message,
[51:56] God testifying of his gifts. He says
[52:00] that now when he met the woman at the
[52:02] well, he went right straight and told
[52:05] her what was wrong with her, where her
[52:07] trouble was. If she had a tumor, he'd
[52:09] say, "Bring me a drink." She'd say,
[52:11] "It's not customary for the Jews to ask
[52:14] a Samaritan." See, he's just talking to
[52:16] her. Man, you see you're a human. I'm a
[52:19] human. And we have two human spirits.
[52:22] Now, when this anointing comes on me,
[52:24] that's the angel of the gift of God,
[52:26] which is a messenger where angel sent
[52:28] from God. Now, it's a part of God, an
[52:30] attribute of God. And then their spirit
[52:34] now then we break from the natural into
[52:37] the supernatural. And then in between
[52:39] here, your spirit is speaking to me. I'm
[52:43] speaking back to you through mortal
[52:44] lips. both anointing uh two anointing.
[52:47] Now if this spirit here that's on me to
[52:50] is to bless you. Not that I can bless
[52:52] you. It can bless you. Now if then your
[52:54] spirit is willing but you have a spirit
[52:57] of unbelief then it cannot bless you.
[52:59] It'll just tell you. It might tell you
[53:01] what's wrong or something spend uh send
[53:03] you on but you'll have to believe. And
[53:06] these two spirits can get together. See
[53:09] it's a battle. Praise God. So you see
[53:11] you are a speaking spirit. Man was born
[53:15] to speak.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; Praise God. The inability for a man to
[53:19] uh a man to the inability for a man to
[53:21] speak is an abnormal thing. Amen. God
[53:25] never made a man for him not to operate
[53:27] in his authority.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I want to say your authority
[53:31] lies in what you speak.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because what you believe flows
[53:35] through your mouth. Amen.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; So what you speak can control your
[53:39] situation.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; And
[53:44] we want to just turn here Genesis
[53:47] chapter 2 verse 15. And we see that when
[53:51] man when God made this man, the first
[53:54] Adam, he he he made him a a perfect man,
[53:57] he gave him his his his territory and he
[54:01] told him what he would do. You you see,
[54:03] but he was made of a certain nature, a
[54:05] certain material. Amen. And here we find
[54:08] in Genesis 2:15 it says, "And the Lord
[54:10] God took the man and he put him in the
[54:12] garden of Eden to dress it and to keep
[54:15] it." Praise God. So man was given this
[54:18] sacred responsibility to make sure as
[54:21] the head of his territory that he would
[54:24] dress it and keep it. Amen. And the Lord
[54:26] God commanded him, saying, "Of every
[54:28] tree of the garden, thou mayest freely
[54:30] eat, but of the tree of the knowledge of
[54:32] good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it.
[54:34] For in the day that thou eatest of it,
[54:37] thou shalt surely die. And when God
[54:39] speaks, the word must his word must come
[54:42] to pass. Amen. And you we know we know
[54:45] exactly what happened here that uh
[54:47] through the fall uh Adam had to make a
[54:50] choice. He had to walk out on his wife
[54:53] because of the unbelief that she got
[54:56] compromised in. Praise God. But you see,
[54:59] we can learn something from Adam because
[55:02] through through the through the whole
[55:04] scripture, we see that he was a type of
[55:06] Christ, the second Adam. Amen. And
[55:10] because of his decision, he allowed
[55:12] himself, he allowed God's attribute to
[55:15] become something tangible to us. Amen.
[55:18] And that's been God's purpose. God is
[55:20] always finding ways on how he can make
[55:22] himself tangible. God wants to be
[55:25] touched. God wants to be felt. God wants
[55:28] to be heard. God wants to be seen. Amen.
[55:30] And the only way God can be tangible is
[55:33] when he is dwelling in a body. Praise
[55:36] God.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; The prophet says in the message, why are
[55:39] we not a denomination? He says, "So God
[55:42] comes down and he brings down oh, a
[55:45] bunch of angels, Gabriel, his creation
[55:48] of heavens." So they come down and they
[55:50] tiptoe real easy into the bedroom. See,
[55:53] look around. Gabriel said, "Come here,
[55:56] father. Come here. Look here. Here he
[55:58] is. He lay here lays your children
[56:00] laying here. How many in there ever went
[56:03] to the bedside? Some of you mothers, you
[56:05] dad together, you looked at the little
[56:07] boy, the little girl, and you just
[56:09] reminded one another, don't he look like
[56:12] you this way and that way? Did he ever
[56:14] do that? Why? Many time I go and say to
[56:17] Ma, say about Joseph, she'll say, Bill,
[56:20] he's got a high forehead like you. Yeah,
[56:22] but me, he's got big eyes like you. Why?
[56:25] He's part of our product our he's a
[56:27] product of our union now. And father god
[56:30] uh can say this about uh he said you
[56:33] know Gabriel said you know he looks just
[56:35] like you. That's how God looks. Look at
[56:39] yourself. That's how God looks. He looks
[56:41] like you. You're his offspring. How many
[56:45] knows that? And I just think that's such
[56:47] a beautiful thing because when God looks
[56:49] at you, he wants to see himself. Amen.
[56:53] God looks like you and you look like
[56:56] God. Praise the Lord. There is no
[56:58] difference. But you see, sometimes we
[57:00] need to be reminded uh of where we come
[57:04] from and who we are. Praise the Lord.
[57:06] There's a quote I w I read sometime this
[57:08] week. It says, "The greatest casualty is
[57:10] being forgotten." And you see, sometimes
[57:13] we can forget who we are. And that's why
[57:16] we need the word as a mirror in our
[57:18] lives on a daily basis to remind us the
[57:21] God that's living on the inside.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; And you know through history and time um
[57:29] when we look at the the different animal
[57:31] lives, the dog still uh remembers who
[57:35] the dog is. Amen. A dog still brings
[57:37] forth another dog. A dog still barks. A
[57:40] a lion still wars. A eagle still
[57:43] soarses. Right? We can look at the
[57:46] nature and we see that the only thing
[57:47] that's out of place is man. Amen. Man
[57:51] has fallen from his original position.
[57:53] Praise God. And I want you to know that
[57:56] God has positioned something in you
[57:58] that's eternal. Something that seed
[58:01] something that will bring forth fruit.
[58:03] Praise God. And I want you to know that
[58:05] don't allow the devil to reposition what
[58:07] God has placed in you. Praise God.
[58:10] Because God has given you something for
[58:12] every situation, for every battle, for
[58:14] every need.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; And it's God's desire that you be
[58:19] partaker of his divine nature. Amen.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; And I just love that how Peter says that
[58:26] we are partaker of his divine nature. Uh
[58:29] it's partaker means to join in to have
[58:32] an action or an activity with God.
[58:35] Praise God. Another says to take part or
[58:38] experience something along with God.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; Praise God. So God wants you to be an
[58:43] active participant in your daily
[58:45] relationship with him. Praise God. He
[58:48] wants to uh be a partnership with you
[58:50] and give you 100% of the benefits.
[58:52] That's the God that you serve this
[58:54] morning.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; We want to turn to Mark chapter 7 here.
[59:03] And here we see uh a very sad situation.
[59:08] Uh it's a man that was born uh in a
[59:11] particular in a certain condition. Uh
[59:14] but here reason it's sad is because
[59:19] we see this man that um that that has
[59:22] the inability to speak. Amen. And he he
[59:27] he's not uh Jesus uh the Bible says he's
[59:30] departing from one place and he's
[59:32] entering into the coasts and of the
[59:34] capitalists and this man he he he
[59:38] couldn't even um help himself. Amen. Um
[59:42] he had to uh the Bible says they had to
[59:45] bring him
[59:46] &gt;&gt; right because he couldn't even help
[59:48] himself.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; And uh we'll pick this up here in verse
[59:51] 32. It says, "And they bring unto him
[59:54] one that was deaf and had an impediment
[59:57] in his speech, and they beseech him to
[1:00:00] put his hand upon him, and he took him
[1:00:03] aside from the multitude and put his
[1:00:05] fingers in his ear, and he spit and he
[1:00:09] touched his tongue." And I just want to
[1:00:12] say this, when you have a dysfunctional
[1:00:15] head, right, I it makes that even the
[1:00:18] body cannot help itself. Praise God. So
[1:00:21] which means that when you are in a
[1:00:23] position where you are of the head, you
[1:00:25] want to make sure that your eyes are
[1:00:27] seeing the right things, that your ears
[1:00:29] are listening to the right things, your
[1:00:31] mouth are speaking the right things.
[1:00:33] Amen. This man couldn't help himself.
[1:00:36] Praise God.
[1:00:37] So
[1:00:40] it goes on to say that Jesus he took him
[1:00:42] to the side from the multitude and he
[1:00:44] put his fingers in his ears and he spit
[1:00:46] and touched his tongue and looking up to
[1:00:49] heaven. He sighed and he saith unto them
[1:00:53] e fatha that is be open and straightway
[1:00:58] his ears were opened and the string of
[1:01:00] his tongue was loose and he spake plain.
[1:01:03] And I just love when the scripture can
[1:01:05] be planned because we are in this in
[1:01:07] this scene, we see that Jesus just spoke
[1:01:10] one word. Amen. And and he as he spoke
[1:01:13] this one word, I want you to know what
[1:01:16] was closed was opened. What was bound
[1:01:18] was loose.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; And I just want you to know this
[1:01:21] morning, I don't know what situation
[1:01:23] that you have closed or what situation
[1:01:25] you have in bondage, but speak one word
[1:01:28] and it shall be open. Speak one word and
[1:01:31] it shall be loose. Praise God.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; You know, one of the greatest doors or
[1:01:37] things that can be opened is the door to
[1:01:40] our souls.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; And the greatest door that can be opened
[1:01:43] is the destination of that soul. Praise
[1:01:46] God. The Bible says in Revelation
[1:01:49] chapter 4, he says uh after John says,
[1:01:52] "After this, I looked and behold a door
[1:01:55] was opened in heaven. And the first
[1:01:58] voice which I heard was as it were of a
[1:02:01] trumpet talking to me was saith, come up
[1:02:04] hither, and I will show thee things
[1:02:07] which must be hereafter." And church, I
[1:02:10] just believe that God is preparing and
[1:02:13] conditioning a bride, right, to
[1:02:15] recognize that voice to come up. Praise
[1:02:18] God. I believe that's that's that's
[1:02:20] happening even right now. Amen. It has
[1:02:23] already begun in you. Praise God. And I
[1:02:26] you young people, I want to say, don't
[1:02:27] miss out on the voice that leads you to
[1:02:30] the open door.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; Praise God. There's many voices in the
[1:02:33] land today, but only one voice will lead
[1:02:35] you to the open door. Praise God. Don't
[1:02:38] allow your desire to experience
[1:02:41] different things keep you from that open
[1:02:43] door.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And if I might add, not
[1:02:46] every experience need an experiment.
[1:02:48] Praise God. There are certain things
[1:02:51] that you can stay away from. There are
[1:02:53] certain things that you can keep
[1:02:55] yourself from. Praise God. There are
[1:02:57] certain things you can reserve yourself
[1:02:59] from. Praise God. You can learn from
[1:03:02] other people's experience, but do you
[1:03:04] don't have to experiment on it yourself.
[1:03:06] Praise the Lord.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; There is one experience that needs your
[1:03:12] everything. That is your experience with
[1:03:14] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Praise God. That will lead you to the
[1:03:18] open door.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says in the message,
[1:03:23] "Sir, we would see Jesus." Now, there's
[1:03:25] some things in the Bible that God wants
[1:03:27] us to challenge. God is an all powerful
[1:03:30] God, and he gives his servants a
[1:03:32] commission to do great things. Amen.
[1:03:36] What God has promised is no uh uh uh uh
[1:03:40] value if it isn't purposed to do great
[1:03:43] things. Amen. God's word will accomplish
[1:03:46] what it's been purposed to do.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; And I just want you to know that you
[1:03:50] were created to do great things. Amen.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; It goes on to say that and we mustn't be
[1:03:58] afraid to ask God to do great things
[1:04:00] because he's asked us to do the
[1:04:02] impossible without him. So if he's asked
[1:04:05] us to do the impossible, we want to have
[1:04:08] the omnipotent God to do those
[1:04:10] impossibilities.
[1:04:11] I believe it was brother Mark that read
[1:04:13] Mark 11 this morning where it says if
[1:04:16] you say to this mountain,
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; praise God, which shows that when you
[1:04:21] say something, God has already backed it
[1:04:24] up.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; Praise God. There's a certain place we
[1:04:27] can get to in our relationship with
[1:04:29] Christ where the things that you speak
[1:04:32] is just as if he spoke it himself. Amen.
[1:04:35] All right. It it doesn't matter what the
[1:04:38] need is, what the season is. Praise God.
[1:04:40] But if you speak it, it shall be done.
[1:04:43] Praise God. YOU SEE, WHEN GOD TOOK
[1:04:46] CHRIST INTO THE MOUNTAIN with the
[1:04:48] disciples, Amen. He looked at him. The
[1:04:50] Bible says there was a cloud that spoke
[1:04:52] and the crowd looked at him and says,
[1:04:54] "Oh, this is my beloved son in whom I am
[1:04:58] well pleased." Amen. He says, "Hear ye
[1:05:01] him." It wasn't that God was finished
[1:05:04] with his work. BUT IT WAS THAT CHRIST
[1:05:06] GOT TO A PLACE where whatever the
[1:05:09] situation was, if he spoke something, it
[1:05:12] was just as if God was speaking himself.
[1:05:15] And I just believe that there's a place
[1:05:17] the church of God can get to this
[1:05:19] morning. THERE'S A PLACE THE BRIDE OF
[1:05:21] CHRIST CAN get through this morning.
[1:05:23] That if YOU JUST SPEAK THE WORD, IT'S AS
[1:05:26] IF GOD IS SPEAKING HIMSELF.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:38] Amen.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; My my
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; the Bible says that we are con
[1:05:44] conditioned to do great things.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; Now the prophet says here in this
[1:05:51] message revelation uh book of symbols he
[1:05:54] says angelic beings associated associate
[1:05:58] together. I hope that you get that. That
[1:06:02] just dropped right down free. Look, if
[1:06:04] you've got the Holy Spirit in you, then
[1:06:07] you're a candidate for association with
[1:06:09] the unseen world and the supernatural.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; No wonder people can't believe in those
[1:06:14] things. They never come in contact.
[1:06:18] Praise God. Now, I just want to
[1:06:20] encourage you this morning that you can
[1:06:22] reserve yourself to be a candidate for
[1:06:24] the supernatural. You can be a candidate
[1:06:27] for healing. You can be a candidate for
[1:06:30] peace. You can be a candidate for
[1:06:32] perfection. You can be a candidate for
[1:06:35] deity. Praise the Lord.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; Look at your neighbor and just say, "I
[1:06:40] am a candidate."
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Whatever you desire,
[1:06:45] God can do it.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet goes on to say, "But
[1:06:50] when the Holy Spirit comes into the
[1:06:52] heart, quickly he becomes a two-fold
[1:06:56] being, one on the earth to die and one
[1:06:58] on heaven to live." Amen. In his body,
[1:07:01] he's still subject to death, but in his
[1:07:04] soul, he's passed from death unto life.
[1:07:06] In his body, he has his earthly contact
[1:07:09] with his five senses. In his spirit, he
[1:07:12] has a contact with God through the Holy
[1:07:14] Ghost. And the angels of God visits
[1:07:16] them, speaks with them, and they are
[1:07:18] messengers sent from God to reveal and
[1:07:21] to bring messages from God to the
[1:07:23] individual. He's out to get the first
[1:07:25] thing first. Praise God. Jeremiah 32:17
[1:07:29] says, "Ah, Lord God." And I just love
[1:07:32] how it says it because it so it shows
[1:07:34] that that that it's a signifying that
[1:07:37] you are you are taking a moment to
[1:07:39] recognize the goodness of God.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; You are taking a moment to recognize the
[1:07:44] deity of God.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; It goes on to say, "Behold, thou hast
[1:07:48] made the heavens and the earth by thy
[1:07:49] great power and stretched out arm, and
[1:07:52] there are nothing too too hard for
[1:07:55] thee." Nothing is too hard for God.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. We should never come into the
[1:08:00] presence of God and leave the same way.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; We should never come into the presence
[1:08:05] of God and and not have our need met.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; We should leave in the presence of God
[1:08:12] lacking nothing.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 19. Want to turn here
[1:08:22] for a moment. Verse 23.
[1:08:25] And it reads, "Then said Jesus unto his
[1:08:29] disciples,
[1:08:30] verily I say unto you, that a rich man
[1:08:34] shall hardly enter into the kingdom of
[1:08:36] heaven. And again, I say unto you, it is
[1:08:40] easier for a camel to go through the eye
[1:08:43] of a needle than for a rich man to enter
[1:08:46] into the kingdom of God." When the
[1:08:49] disciples heard it, they were
[1:08:51] exceedingly amazed, saying, "Who then
[1:08:54] can be saved?" Now,
[1:08:57] some and many might take this scripture
[1:08:59] and have different ways or thoughts
[1:09:02] about it and maybe say that uh we're not
[1:09:06] called or we're not uh uh made to be a
[1:09:09] rich man, right? We might take the
[1:09:12] understanding that a rich man is not
[1:09:15] something that God is is is looking for.
[1:09:18] Praise God. But I just want you to
[1:09:20] understand that as we read this that
[1:09:22] Jesus, he never dismissed the question.
[1:09:25] Amen. He never broke it down on how the
[1:09:28] poor man will make it or how the rich
[1:09:30] man won't. Right? He just said that uh
[1:09:34] uh if you read it again, he he um uh he
[1:09:37] he does something very particular in
[1:09:40] verse 26. He says, "But Jesus beheld
[1:09:43] them and said unto them, with men this
[1:09:46] is impossible,
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; but with God all things are possible."
[1:09:52] You see, he identified their positions.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. He he he NEVER DISMISSED THE
[1:09:58] question and said it couldn't happen.
[1:10:00] But he identified a position.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; Are you with men this morning or are you
[1:10:04] WITH GOD?
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WITH GOD ALL THINGS ARE
[1:10:07] POSSIBLE. Praise God. Brother Brandham
[1:10:10] says we inherit all things. Amen. Not
[1:10:13] just all the money in the world, but all
[1:10:15] things. Amen. All things belong to you.
[1:10:19] ALL THINGS ARE SUBJECTED TO YOU. ALL
[1:10:21] THINGS ARE BELOW YOUR FEET. ALL THINGS
[1:10:23] ARE WITHIN YOUR TERRITORY. AMEN.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; I want to encourage you. You were called
[1:10:30] on this lessian age to defy the kingdom
[1:10:34] of hell. To defy it. When you defy
[1:10:37] something, it means your presence is
[1:10:39] known.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; When you defy something, it means that
[1:10:43] your the enemy knows who you are
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; and that you're not afraid to speak
[1:10:48] God's promises.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; It goes on to say, "Then answered Peter,
[1:10:58] and said unto him, Behold, we have
[1:10:59] forsaken all and follow thee. What shall
[1:11:02] we have therefore?" And Jesus said unto
[1:11:05] them, "Verily I say unto you, that he ye
[1:11:07] which have followed me in the
[1:11:09] regeneration, when the Son of Man shall
[1:11:11] sit on the throne of his glory, ye also
[1:11:13] shall sit upon thrones, judging the 12
[1:11:17] tribes of Israel. And everyone that hath
[1:11:19] forsaken houses, or brethren, or
[1:11:22] sisters, or father, or mother, or wife,
[1:11:24] or children, or lands for my name's sake
[1:11:27] shall receive and hundfold, and shall
[1:11:30] inherit everlasting life. But many that
[1:11:33] are first shall be last and the last
[1:11:35] shall be first. And I just believe the
[1:11:38] reason Amen. Brother Jack can uh come
[1:11:40] here and preach the message it shall
[1:11:43] prosper was not a from a position of
[1:11:45] power but from a position from a place
[1:11:47] of position. Amen. Because when you
[1:11:50] recognize what your position is, you
[1:11:52] have the ability to enforce. You have
[1:11:54] the ability to claim. Amen. Men can have
[1:11:58] power but they don't have position.
[1:12:00] Amen. And we have the position this
[1:12:02] morning as a bride of Christ.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; The Bible uh the prophet says in the
[1:12:10] message in the exposition of the seven
[1:12:12] church ages, he said this this quote
[1:12:14] here. He says, "When the bride will get
[1:12:16] back to being a word bride, she will
[1:12:20] produce the very works that Jesus
[1:12:23] produced."
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Praise God. You see, uh,
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; word bride allows you to, uh, get into a
[1:12:32] a a different place in your position.
[1:12:35] Praise God. Because you can't separate
[1:12:37] the word from the word. Praise God. We
[1:12:40] have the written word. But now I'm
[1:12:43] looking at the manifested word. Praise
[1:12:46] God.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. And position places you into
[1:12:49] purpose. Praise God. And no greater
[1:12:51] purpose can be served than to be a bride
[1:12:54] of Jesus Christ.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:12:57] Um I just uh remember that as brother
[1:13:02] Quinton was preaching uh a few sun a few
[1:13:04] Wednesdays ago, Brother Quint Jr. and he
[1:13:07] was talking about Enoch and the pyramids
[1:13:09] and and and and that just that just kind
[1:13:12] of did something to me. Uh because when
[1:13:13] I was studying my uh my my my thought on
[1:13:16] this, I realized that the Bible says
[1:13:18] Enoch had this testimony
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; that he pleased God. Praise God. And and
[1:13:24] and and because of that, by faith, the
[1:13:27] Bible says that he was translated. Amen.
[1:13:30] And I just began to think about that and
[1:13:31] I just say this, we can bypass a lot of
[1:13:34] things when we please God.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Praise God. When we can just please God,
[1:13:39] we can bypass a lot of things. Amen. And
[1:13:42] I just believe that's a unwritten law.
[1:13:45] Pleasing God. Praise God. It doesn't
[1:13:47] matter how, where, or when, but just
[1:13:50] please God.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; We don't know how God how he not pleased
[1:13:54] God. Right? But we know that he did.
[1:13:56] Praise God. That was his testimony.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; A prophet says
[1:14:09] in the message, "How can I overcome?" He
[1:14:11] says, "Now,
[1:14:13] Leodysa, that's the last age. There's
[1:14:17] going to be some overcomers in there.
[1:14:18] Watch here. They remember each church
[1:14:21] age. The one preceding it inherits all
[1:14:24] that the other ones offered. Watch up
[1:14:26] here. Now, it's after they have done
[1:14:29] receive all these powers, these new
[1:14:31] names, and everything written that he
[1:14:34] promised and eat the hidden mana all
[1:14:36] down through. There's a reward for
[1:14:39] overcomers. Press on, lily, if it's in
[1:14:41] you, lay aside the mud and everything
[1:14:44] else and press up towards the top.
[1:14:47] Praise the Lord. Hebrews chapter 6
[1:14:51] verse1 17
[1:14:54] it reads wherein God willing more
[1:14:57] abundantly to show unto the heirs of
[1:15:00] promise the immutability of his counsel
[1:15:03] confirmed it by an oath that by two
[1:15:05] immutable things in which it was
[1:15:08] impossible for God to lie we might have
[1:15:10] a strong consolation who have fled for
[1:15:14] our refuge to lay hold upon the hope
[1:15:16] that is set before us. Praise God. You
[1:15:19] can rest on God's promises.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; I believe it was brother Jack that says
[1:15:23] you can drop your weight on it. Amen.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Because God has guaranteed his word to
[1:15:30] us in this hour.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; Right. Where he could swear by no
[1:15:33] greater. He swore by himself. Amen. And
[1:15:36] he has his word as the unchangeable
[1:15:38] thing. Praise God. So it it it it's
[1:15:41] something in this hour to never think
[1:15:43] any less of ourselves as a bride of
[1:15:45] Christ because we have been given
[1:15:48] everything into our bosom. Praise the
[1:15:51] Lord.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; The prophet says here in the message,
[1:15:56] well, let me turn to first Corinthians
[1:15:58] 15. Read a few verses there.
[1:16:01] Amen. And then it reads in verse 41,
[1:16:05] there is one glory of the sun and
[1:16:08] another glory of the moon and another
[1:16:11] glory of the star stars. For one star
[1:16:14] differth from another star in glory, so
[1:16:17] also is the resurrection of the dead. It
[1:16:20] is sown in corruption, it is raised in
[1:16:22] incorruption. It is sown in dishonor, it
[1:16:25] is raised in glory. It is sown in
[1:16:27] weakness, it is raised in power. It is
[1:16:30] sown in natural body. It is raised a
[1:16:32] spiritual body. There is a natural body
[1:16:34] and there is a spiritual body. And so it
[1:16:36] is written, "The first man, Adam, was a
[1:16:39] living soul. The last man, Adam, was a
[1:16:42] quickening spirit." Praise God. And we
[1:16:45] want to thank God this morning that the
[1:16:46] word has been quickened to us. Amen.
[1:16:49] That we can put aside oh these things
[1:16:52] that has kept us bound for ages. Um, we
[1:16:55] can put aside these things that come to
[1:16:57] delay the God's promises in our lives.
[1:17:00] Praise the Lord. Because God's word can
[1:17:02] quicken us in every facet of our lives.
[1:17:06] The prophet says, putting on the whole
[1:17:08] armor of God, he says, just like the
[1:17:11] word in the beginning was spoken to us
[1:17:12] in the garden of Eden, spoken word, and
[1:17:15] the second time it was made flesh and
[1:17:17] dwelt among us. And the third time it
[1:17:19] become part of us in the Holy Ghost,
[1:17:22] dwelling in us, coming down into the
[1:17:25] man. First, first spoke the word, um the
[1:17:28] enemy tore it down, then the word was
[1:17:31] made flesh and he was crucified. But
[1:17:34] now, amen. There's a difference in the
[1:17:36] word. The word is become the church. And
[1:17:39] the church is the word. God, all that
[1:17:43] God he was, he poured into Christ. All
[1:17:45] that Christ was, he poured into the
[1:17:48] church. The Holy Ghost. The enemy has
[1:17:50] got something. See, he isn't finding
[1:17:53] something back here. Many people just uh
[1:17:56] uh just taking the letter. The letter
[1:17:58] kleth the spirit giveth life. See, and
[1:18:01] they take these creeds and so forth
[1:18:04] still killth. But when you are taking
[1:18:06] the spirit, that's God himself. How do
[1:18:09] you know it is God? Because he is taking
[1:18:11] the word and he is manifesting it. Then
[1:18:14] it's God himself. Oh my. The spoken
[1:18:17] word. Praise the Lord. And I just take
[1:18:19] great comfort in knowing that whatever
[1:18:22] God has spoken in our lives, as we
[1:18:25] become the word and we would speak the
[1:18:27] word, it would not return to him void.
[1:18:30] Praise God. It will accomplish what it's
[1:18:32] been purposed to do. Praise the Lord.
[1:18:35] And as we move on here
[1:18:38] in the message, questions and answers,
[1:18:41] B uh the prophet of God says, "Now the
[1:18:43] first man, he made the first man in his
[1:18:46] image, and we are returning back to that
[1:18:49] image."
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; That's right. To our first created
[1:18:52] image. Praise the Lord. When God created
[1:18:55] me, William Brandham, I was before the
[1:18:58] foundation of the world. He made my
[1:19:00] being, my spirit. I wasn't conscious of
[1:19:03] anything as far as I know. I don't
[1:19:05] believe you're getting it. But now, just
[1:19:07] a minute just told the disciples, he
[1:19:09] knew them before the foundation of the
[1:19:11] world. And Paul said here, he chose us
[1:19:14] in him before the world began. And it
[1:19:17] goes on to say, "Now there was some part
[1:19:19] of me or Neville and the rest of you
[1:19:21] here that's in Christ Jesus that uh the
[1:19:24] world ever began." And here's to my
[1:19:27] analysis of that. I think that the
[1:19:29] people today that are possessed with his
[1:19:31] spirit or the spirit a part of these
[1:19:34] angelic beings, spirits which rotated
[1:19:37] off of God that never fell in the
[1:19:39] beginning and resisted the devil's lie
[1:19:42] in heaven. Now I just prophet of God
[1:19:45] goes before the beginning here and you
[1:19:48] see but before the beginning he says he
[1:19:51] believes we were spirits that never fell
[1:19:53] in the beginning.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. So so we are just passing through
[1:19:58] time.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. And as we pass through times the
[1:20:01] heartaches are temporary, the sicknesses
[1:20:03] are temporary. Uh the the earthly
[1:20:06] conditions are temporary. But we get to
[1:20:08] a place when our spirit can be quickened
[1:20:10] and our body can become subjected to
[1:20:12] that. Oh, praise God. We realize that we
[1:20:15] never failed to begin with. We were
[1:20:18] never sick to begin with. We were never
[1:20:20] bound to begin with. Praise God. There
[1:20:22] is an there is an accuser that comes to
[1:20:24] claim to put these things on us. Praise
[1:20:27] God. But we have never failed to begin
[1:20:29] with. I believe it was brother Wesco
[1:20:31] that says we are healed people being
[1:20:34] accused to be sick. Amen.
[1:20:36] I don't know if I said it right, but
[1:20:38] that's what it is. We're just being
[1:20:39] accused of being sick. Amen. And I I
[1:20:42] think according to law, you are innocent
[1:20:44] until proven guilty.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, you are healed
[1:20:47] until you the devil can prove you're
[1:20:49] you're sick. You are free until the
[1:20:52] devil can prove you're bound. Praise the
[1:20:54] Lord. You are rich
[1:20:57] until the devil can prove you are poor.
[1:21:00] Praise the Lord. That is your condition
[1:21:02] this morning.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, God makes all things well. The
[1:21:07] Bible says,
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; "Praise the Lord."
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says, "And twothirds
[1:21:15] of the earth is in sin and more than
[1:21:18] that which twothirds of the angels was
[1:21:20] kicked out and those demon spirits come
[1:21:22] into the people and habitate their
[1:21:24] body." See what I mean? They're demons
[1:21:26] what uh once existed and they come into
[1:21:29] the people and give them a nature. Jesus
[1:21:32] cast seven of them out of Mary
[1:21:33] Magdalene. pride, boasts, big people.
[1:21:36] You see, unclean, filthy, vulgarity,
[1:21:39] emulation, strife, all these things.
[1:21:41] See, them were spirits that was made up
[1:21:44] back there when God began to make man
[1:21:46] off of uh there in his own image created
[1:21:49] those spiritual beings, those spirits.
[1:21:51] Praise the Lord. And every one of those
[1:21:54] spirits that the prophet of God is
[1:21:55] speaking here, uh they all died at
[1:21:58] Calvary. Praise the Lord. When God was
[1:22:00] on the cross and he overcame the
[1:22:02] temptations of this world and he he came
[1:22:04] and he was tested as we are. He said
[1:22:07] those words, "It is finished." Praise
[1:22:09] God. Every spirit that has come to tempt
[1:22:12] you to to try to defile you, those
[1:22:14] spirits were defeated in Christ.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So we don't have to
[1:22:18] fight a defeated enemy. Praise God. We
[1:22:21] can raise authority and leave the enemy
[1:22:23] where he belongs, which is under your
[1:22:25] feet.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; In Mark chapter 4
[1:22:33] verse four uh verse 30
[1:22:36] it says and he said where onto shall we
[1:22:39] liken the kingdom of God or with what
[1:22:43] comparison shall we compare it? It is
[1:22:46] like a grain of mustard seed which me
[1:22:49] which when it is sown in the earth is
[1:22:51] less than all the seeds that be in the
[1:22:54] earth. But when it is sown, it groweth
[1:22:57] up and becometh greater than all the
[1:22:59] herves, and shooteth out great b uh big
[1:23:02] branches, so that the fowls of the air
[1:23:05] may lodge under the shadow of it. But
[1:23:08] when it is sown, it groweth up and
[1:23:10] becometh greater than all herbs, and
[1:23:12] shooteth out great branches, so that the
[1:23:14] flowers of the earth uh may lodge under
[1:23:17] the shadow of it. I think I just read
[1:23:19] that twice. But we just want you to see
[1:23:21] this that what you see in seed form is
[1:23:24] not always what you see in the branches.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Uh the the the the the
[1:23:30] seeds they go through the different
[1:23:32] seasons. They go through different
[1:23:33] things. But there comes a time where the
[1:23:36] seed doesn't remain in that form. It go
[1:23:38] it comes a time where it grows. And as
[1:23:40] it brings forth growth, branches come
[1:23:42] forth, fruits come forth. Praise the
[1:23:45] Lord. And whatever part of the seed uh
[1:23:48] uh uh uh ne the the part of the seed
[1:23:51] never looks like what the branch
[1:23:53] actually goes through. Amen. And I just
[1:23:55] believe that as the Bible says we what
[1:23:58] what is sown in corruption it is raised
[1:24:01] incorruption. What is sown in dishonor
[1:24:04] is raised in glory. Praise the Lord. And
[1:24:07] we are seeds of God on this side of
[1:24:10] eternity that can bring forth life. life
[1:24:13] to our uh family members, life to our
[1:24:16] neighbors, life to our situations.
[1:24:18] Wherever we are, we are life to this
[1:24:21] world.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; In 1 Corinthians chapter 10
[1:24:31] verse 17,
[1:24:33] praise the Lord.
[1:24:35] It says, "For we being many are one
[1:24:39] bread and one body, for we are all
[1:24:42] partakers of that one bread. Behold,
[1:24:45] Israel after the flesh are not they
[1:24:48] which eat of the sacrifices partaker of
[1:24:51] the altar, which say I then that the
[1:24:53] idol is is anything? Or there or that
[1:24:57] which is offered and sacrificed to idols
[1:24:59] is anything. But I say that the which
[1:25:02] the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice
[1:25:05] to devils and not to God. And I would
[1:25:08] not that ye should have fellowship with
[1:25:10] devils. Praise the Lord. And I just
[1:25:13] believe that we want to make sure that
[1:25:15] nothing is hindering us from what God
[1:25:18] has ordained for us to have. That
[1:25:20] nothing is hindering us from what
[1:25:22] belongs to us. Praise the Lord. Because
[1:25:25] in order for us to experience spiritual
[1:25:27] growth, we have to be willing to lay
[1:25:29] aside We have to be willing to put away.
[1:25:32] We have to be willing to allow ourselves
[1:25:34] to be subjected to God's word in this
[1:25:37] day. Praise God. And it goes on to say,
[1:25:40] "Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord and
[1:25:43] the cup of devils. Ye cannot be
[1:25:46] partakers of the Lord's table and be the
[1:25:49] table of devils."
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; Praise God. So, there's got to be a
[1:25:53] separation at some point, right? God has
[1:25:56] separators. God doesn't bring people and
[1:26:00] and and and and have grandchildren and
[1:26:02] and and and so on. God has separated us.
[1:26:05] We're called to separate from unbelief.
[1:26:07] We're called to separate from anything
[1:26:09] that brings a shadow to the word of God.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And I like how it says
[1:26:14] in Proverbs 26:1, he says, "As a dog
[1:26:18] runth to his vomit, so a fool run
[1:26:21] returneth to his folly." Praise God. So
[1:26:24] it shows that that that when God has
[1:26:27] delivered you from something, when God
[1:26:28] has taken you from a situation, when God
[1:26:31] has done something personally to you,
[1:26:34] praise God, he considers that thing as
[1:26:37] vomit. Praise God. And God never wants
[1:26:39] you to return to a vomit situation, to a
[1:26:43] vomit condition.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I could even say, how do you
[1:26:46] expect God to bless you in such a
[1:26:48] condition? Praise God.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. and and and vomit is often
[1:26:52] something or excess that just doesn't
[1:26:54] belong, right? So, anything can be a
[1:26:57] vomit situation. Something that is
[1:26:59] holding or lagging onto you that doesn't
[1:27:02] belong to be there. Whether it's a
[1:27:04] friend, whether it's an individual,
[1:27:06] whether it's a job, whe these things you
[1:27:09] can consider to be vomit. Amen. And God
[1:27:12] doesn't want you to cling on to vomit.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:27:17] God wants to satisfy your mouth with
[1:27:19] good things.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; Praise God. That is the word of God.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; In first uh Corinthians
[1:27:32] verse 13,
[1:27:34] Paul says here, "For we know in part,"
[1:27:37] this is verse 9, "and we prophesy in
[1:27:39] part. But when that which is perfect is
[1:27:42] come, then that which is in part shall
[1:27:45] be done away. When I was a child, I
[1:27:48] spake as a child. I understood it as a
[1:27:50] child. But when I become a man, I put
[1:27:53] away childish things. Praise God. And I
[1:27:56] just believe that one way we could look
[1:27:58] at this scripture is realizing that
[1:28:00] there is a place of maturity that we
[1:28:03] have to get to. Praise God. where where
[1:28:06] as brother Troy was speaking of the
[1:28:08] cycles that we kind of endure sometimes
[1:28:10] where we can be we can find ourselves as
[1:28:13] the uh exact recipients of the word
[1:28:16] where every season God is is moving.
[1:28:19] Every season we see the prosperity of
[1:28:21] God in our lives. Every season we see
[1:28:24] that God is withholding nothing because
[1:28:26] there is a bride that walking upright.
[1:28:29] Praise God. And he says I put away
[1:28:31] childish things. Amen. So, it's at a
[1:28:34] point where our expectations from from
[1:28:36] from the inside ought to be that God is
[1:28:40] going to perform what he says. Go. When
[1:28:42] God does a great thing, it's not
[1:28:44] uncommon to us because we're expecting
[1:28:46] for God to move.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says, "I believe that
[1:28:53] we have been children long enough."
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; This isn't a message what here is thou.
[1:28:58] I believe that we have been children
[1:29:00] long enough. God is going to turn his
[1:29:03] church into manhood now.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we played uh and frolic as
[1:29:09] children, but now we're going to have to
[1:29:11] put away childish things and take on
[1:29:13] manhood, maturity. I believe it was Paul
[1:29:16] that says, "When I was a child, I spake
[1:29:18] as a child because he thought as a
[1:29:20] child." But it's time that we begin to
[1:29:22] think like men and women now, for we've
[1:29:24] got to get down to business. Praise God.
[1:29:28] It's time to become the fruit of what we
[1:29:30] believe. Praise the Lord. Because when
[1:29:33] we can expect God for something, we
[1:29:36] should expect it right away. Amen. Uh
[1:29:39] God's word cannot return to him void.
[1:29:42] Praise the Lord.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:46] Proverbs verse 3
[1:29:50] uh chapter 3 verse 9 says, "Honor the
[1:29:53] Lord with thy substance, and with the
[1:29:57] first fruits of all thine increase. So
[1:30:00] shall thy barns be filled with plenty,
[1:30:03] and thy presses shall be shall burst
[1:30:05] with new wine." And I just thought the
[1:30:07] best way to honor God is by believing
[1:30:10] him and doing what he says. Praise the
[1:30:12] Lord. Because when you come to God, you
[1:30:15] must believe and and and as you believe,
[1:30:17] you will be rewarded because you are
[1:30:19] diligently seeking him. Praise God. And
[1:30:22] and and I just like what it says here
[1:30:24] that uh uh uh we can honor the Lord with
[1:30:26] our substance. And we know that faith is
[1:30:28] the substance. So when we believe God,
[1:30:31] nothing shall be impossible to you.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; Nothing shall be impossible to you.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Romans 8:22 says, "For
[1:30:40] we know that the whole creation groanth
[1:30:43] and travaleth in pain together until
[1:30:45] now. And not only they, but ourselves
[1:30:48] also, which have the first fruits of the
[1:30:50] spirit, even we ourselves grown within
[1:30:54] ourselves, waiting for the adoption to
[1:30:56] wit the redemption of our body." So you
[1:31:00] see the whole creation uh which cannot
[1:31:02] speak but there's an expectation that in
[1:31:05] all creation for man to operate in their
[1:31:08] place of authority in their place of do
[1:31:11] having dominion over creation and I just
[1:31:14] think if creation knows who is subjected
[1:31:16] to how much more the devil praise the
[1:31:19] lord how much more the things around us
[1:31:22] that we can speak to praise the lord we
[1:31:24] have the power the the the the control
[1:31:27] tower lying in us to control every
[1:31:29] situation.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; Now, in Luke chapter 7 verse 37, we want
[1:31:38] to pick up this young sister here that
[1:31:43] through life's journey may have been
[1:31:46] caught into the wrong places at the
[1:31:47] wrong time. And she uh certainly got to
[1:31:52] a place where she wanted to put away
[1:31:55] childish things. She wanted to put aside
[1:31:58] whatever it was that was hindering her
[1:32:00] from getting her blessing. And we pick
[1:32:04] this up in verse 37.
[1:32:07] The Bible says, "And behold, a woman in
[1:32:09] the city, which was a sinner, when she
[1:32:12] knew that Jesus sat at meat in the
[1:32:15] Pharisees house, brought in alle backter
[1:32:18] bots of of ointment." And and I'll just
[1:32:22] stop here for a minute. The prophet says
[1:32:24] that uh preached a message, the worst
[1:32:27] sinner in the city. And and I just
[1:32:30] thought, what what what would what what
[1:32:31] what did this woman do that would cause
[1:32:33] the prophet to look at her as the worst
[1:32:36] sinner in the city? Praise God. And and
[1:32:39] I just thought that in this whole scene,
[1:32:43] in this whole uh moment where she's
[1:32:46] preparing herself to meet Christ, praise
[1:32:49] God, maybe she had just done something
[1:32:52] she hadn't she wasn't too proud about.
[1:32:54] Maybe she had just done something that
[1:32:56] that that that made her want to think
[1:32:58] about suicidal thoughts. Praise God. But
[1:33:02] what I like is that she came to a place
[1:33:05] where she recognized that if she could
[1:33:08] just get into the presence of God
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; that everything could be changed. If she
[1:33:12] could just get into the presence of
[1:33:15] Christ and and and and and that she
[1:33:18] would she would do what she was set in
[1:33:20] her heart to do that her situation would
[1:33:22] change. So she bought an alabaster box
[1:33:25] maybe with the money that she was using
[1:33:28] to to prostitute with, right? But she
[1:33:31] gets to a place where Jesus, the prophet
[1:33:34] says, enters into this Pharisees home
[1:33:37] with dirty feet.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; And he wasn't acknowledged. He He wasn't
[1:33:41] so much uh uh given the kind of
[1:33:43] attention that he deserved. Praise God.
[1:33:46] But this woman knew how to attend to the
[1:33:50] need of the savior, the need of our
[1:33:52] lord. Amen. And she began to wash his
[1:33:55] feet. She began to dry his her feet with
[1:33:58] her hairs. Praise the Lord. And and I
[1:34:01] just want you to know she did all of
[1:34:03] this without speaking a word.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Praise God. So So what she had on the
[1:34:08] inside spoke louder than what she could
[1:34:11] actually speak on the outside.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Praise God. and and and and there Jesus
[1:34:16] sat and thought and and and and reading
[1:34:18] the the uh uh hearing the thoughts of
[1:34:20] the Pharisees and and and and and the
[1:34:22] Pharisees saying to themselves, "If he
[1:34:25] knew what kind of woman this was, he
[1:34:28] would not allow him to touch her." Amen.
[1:34:31] He would not allow him to touch allow
[1:34:33] him to touch him. But there's a certain
[1:34:35] touch that Jesus feels.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when he feels that touch, it
[1:34:41] changes everything.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. When he feels that touch, it
[1:34:45] changes your situation. It causes you
[1:34:48] not to return back to vomit conditions.
[1:34:50] It causes you to go from glory to glory.
[1:34:54] Praise God. From victory to victory. And
[1:34:56] and and here we we find that the pro the
[1:34:59] Bible says that uh uh uh her sins which
[1:35:02] were many were forgiven.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; And Christ says she loved much.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. So she wasn't happy with what she
[1:35:10] was doing, the life she was living.
[1:35:12] Amen. She didn't love it. Praise God.
[1:35:14] But there was something in her allowing
[1:35:17] a causing her, drawing her to do these
[1:35:20] things. Praise God. But there was a love
[1:35:22] that was great on the inside. It was a
[1:35:25] love for God. A love to please God.
[1:35:28] Praise God. And I just want you to know
[1:35:30] that there's a place we can we we we
[1:35:32] need to get to where we separate our
[1:35:36] spirit from our flesh. Praise God. where
[1:35:39] we can please God from having a
[1:35:41] fellowship spiritually with him. Amen.
[1:35:44] Where we can be in the spirit like John
[1:35:46] as John was in the Lord's day and we can
[1:35:49] know that we are pleasing God with what
[1:35:52] we believe.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; Praise God. That's how God wants to be
[1:35:55] pleased.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:35:59] In Romans 8:26
[1:36:01] it says, "Likewise, the Spirit also
[1:36:04] helpeth our infirmities. For we know not
[1:36:06] what we should pray for as we ought, but
[1:36:09] the Spirit itself maketh intercession
[1:36:12] for us with groanings which cannot be
[1:36:14] uttered. And he that searchth the hearts
[1:36:17] knoweth what is the mind of the spirit."
[1:36:19] So this sister even even when she
[1:36:21] couldn't say nothing there was something
[1:36:24] in her that can utter and make
[1:36:26] intercession to connect to God to make
[1:36:29] contact with God. Praise God.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; There was another young sister in the
[1:36:34] days of our prophet that the prophet saw
[1:36:36] in this an institute and the prophet uh
[1:36:39] surely thought she had no business being
[1:36:42] there and and prophet asked the question
[1:36:44] who is the patient? Are you a patient?
[1:36:46] And she says, "Yes, I'm I'm the
[1:36:48] patient." And it was a pretty young
[1:36:50] lady, the prophet says. You see, and and
[1:36:52] and and she started to explain her
[1:36:56] story, tell her testimony, how she grew
[1:36:58] up in the Catholic home, and how she
[1:37:00] been through the different organ
[1:37:01] organizations, the different churches.
[1:37:03] Amen. But see, she she says that she's
[1:37:06] tried everything. And the prophet says,
[1:37:08] "Well, hey, God is obligated to you if
[1:37:11] you believe." Amen. and and and she got
[1:37:13] to a place where she started to pray.
[1:37:16] She started to seek God earnestly. Amen.
[1:37:18] And then she got up and says, "I got it
[1:37:21] now. I know I've been free." And the
[1:37:23] prophet says, "No, no, you haven't
[1:37:25] gotten it yet." She was excited because
[1:37:27] I'm in an experience. But God wants to
[1:37:30] go beyond your experience. Praise God.
[1:37:32] God wants to make sure that the word is
[1:37:35] planted and rooted deeply on the inside
[1:37:38] that even if you can still believe. And
[1:37:41] the the sister got to that place. Praise
[1:37:44] God. And when she got up, she she
[1:37:48] started to earnestly say, "Hey, I know
[1:37:50] without a doubt that I've been healed."
[1:37:53] And and and it was in that moment that
[1:37:55] the prophet says, "Yes, sis. You got it
[1:37:57] now." Because she made contact with God.
[1:38:01] God. I want to encourage you that you
[1:38:03] can make contact with him this morning.
[1:38:05] Praise the Lord. In Colossians chapter 3
[1:38:09] verse one, it says, "If ye be risen with
[1:38:12] Christ, seek those things which are
[1:38:14] above, which Christ siteth on the right
[1:38:16] hand of God." Praise God. And as I come
[1:38:20] to a close,
[1:38:23] there's a few quotes I just want to read
[1:38:25] here. The prophet says in the message
[1:38:27] countdown, he says God made the world.
[1:38:31] He might have made He might have been
[1:38:33] 100red trillion years making it. I don't
[1:38:36] know how long he was, but he made it and
[1:38:39] didn't say how long it was. And none of
[1:38:41] it is our business how long it was. He
[1:38:44] just said in the beginning God created
[1:38:46] the heavens and the earth. Period. That
[1:38:48] settles it. That's all of it. How long
[1:38:50] he was doing it. But then the creation
[1:38:52] begin to spring up now in other time
[1:38:55] when he began. And I believe that in
[1:38:57] there that everything on earth reflects
[1:39:00] heaven. I believe that because you see
[1:39:02] everything struggling for life is
[1:39:05] because there is a life that is
[1:39:06] reflected from. And I believe that when
[1:39:09] God made them, he started reflecting the
[1:39:12] smaller things such as the animal life.
[1:39:14] And the next thing he created was
[1:39:16] something different. That's just exactly
[1:39:19] the way the Bible says he did it. He
[1:39:21] made the first trees and the bottomy
[1:39:23] life and he made man and the last thing
[1:39:25] that he ever come for uh from the earth
[1:39:28] in the form of creation was a man.
[1:39:31] Nothing higher ever come because why it
[1:39:33] was a perfect reflection of the highest
[1:39:36] in heaven which God is a man. God is a
[1:39:40] man. So therefore it proves it. And when
[1:39:42] God came down to dwell among us, he was
[1:39:45] man. It shows the perfection of
[1:39:48] evolution was God which is a man. And
[1:39:51] then when you take a tree and you take
[1:39:53] the grass and so forth, it reflects the
[1:39:55] tree of life which is in heaven. All
[1:39:57] these things are struggling for
[1:39:59] perfection. And everything in this
[1:40:01] natural as Hebrews says here was made of
[1:40:04] things which do not appear. Other words
[1:40:07] they are supernatural and the
[1:40:08] supernatural is reflecting the natural.
[1:40:11] Now the natural was eternal. It's uh so
[1:40:14] everlasting with the supernatural. But
[1:40:16] sin perverted the natural. And if that
[1:40:19] be so, which I believe it is, then
[1:40:21] everything that's happening on earth is
[1:40:23] a type of the spiritual things h that's
[1:40:25] happening. See, it's got to reflect
[1:40:27] something. The achievement of man.
[1:40:30] Praise God. You are a reflection of
[1:40:32] God's perfection this morning. Amen. God
[1:40:36] sees himself when he sees you. Praise
[1:40:39] God. And that makes you the highest form
[1:40:41] of creation. Praise God. And through
[1:40:44] that we know that God's desire is to is
[1:40:47] to is is not to sit like a retired
[1:40:50] being. God doesn't retire from his
[1:40:52] works. But God wants you to be an
[1:40:55] extension of his works. Amen. Where you
[1:40:58] can go forth and be the very works that
[1:41:00] he did on this earth. Greater works.
[1:41:03] Praise the Lord. Amen. Hebrews 11
[1:41:05] chapter 3 says what we read earlier that
[1:41:09] through faith we understand the words
[1:41:11] are framed by the word of God. So that
[1:41:13] things which are seen were not made of
[1:41:15] things which do appear. So we are
[1:41:19] candidates for the things that are
[1:41:20] unseen. And regardless of the situation,
[1:41:24] we know that God has reserved great and
[1:41:27] precious things for his people. All we
[1:41:29] have to do is believe it and realize
[1:41:32] that we are the the very the very God of
[1:41:36] this age. Amen. The God of this age that
[1:41:39] allows us to oversee the spirit of
[1:41:42] Leodosa, overcome the temptations of the
[1:41:45] enemy. Amen. A God of this age that
[1:41:47] allows us to press on and be an
[1:41:49] overcomer in this lot age. Praise the
[1:41:52] Lord.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; I'll leave you with this here in the
[1:41:56] message. What shall I do with Jesus
[1:41:59] called Christ? The prophet says, let me
[1:42:01] say something too. this uniting time to
[1:42:05] see churches uniting, nations uniting.
[1:42:08] It's a uniting time of God and his
[1:42:11] bride. And I say this with reverence and
[1:42:13] respect. I believe that the bride of
[1:42:15] Christ is called. I believe she is
[1:42:17] sealed in the kingdom of God. I believe
[1:42:19] the mechanics are there. They're waiting
[1:42:22] for the dynamics that'll take her off
[1:42:23] the earth into glory in the rapture. I
[1:42:26] believe it with all my heart. Yes, sir.
[1:42:29] We don't know how he's going to do it,
[1:42:30] but he shall do it. He is the dynamics.
[1:42:34] We just become members of the machine of
[1:42:36] the of his body, forming ourselves into
[1:42:39] his image and see him uniting himself
[1:42:42] with us in his works and his love gifts
[1:42:45] as he hands them to us just before the
[1:42:48] wedding supper. Amen. So, we're supposed
[1:42:51] to experience God's gifts, precious
[1:42:54] gifts just before the wedding supper.
[1:42:56] Amen. As we wait for that gifts, uh
[1:42:58] these gifts are God's many gifts that
[1:43:01] he's promised to us in the Bible.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says that the
[1:43:06] dynamics of this church will be the
[1:43:08] refilling of the Holy Spirit
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; that we have worked in a small measure
[1:43:14] while the headstone is coming down to
[1:43:16] unite with the body. But when the head
[1:43:18] of when the head and the body unites
[1:43:21] together, the full power of the Holy
[1:43:24] Ghost would rise would raise her up just
[1:43:26] exactly like that. Even the dead that's
[1:43:29] dead in Christ 400 years ago will raise
[1:43:32] in the beauty of his holiness and take a
[1:43:35] flight to disguise the dynamics is the
[1:43:38] Holy Spirit. Praise the Lord. Hey young
[1:43:41] people, if you have not received the
[1:43:43] Holy Spirit, the baptism of the Holy
[1:43:46] Spirit, seek earnestly for it because it
[1:43:50] is what makes the difference. Praise
[1:43:52] God. Uh the Bible uh the prophet of God
[1:43:55] says that uh a man without the Holy
[1:43:58] Spirit is no more than a than an animal.
[1:44:02] Praise God. No more than a brute beast.
[1:44:05] So when you have the Holy Spirit, it is
[1:44:08] what allows you to brings to bring
[1:44:11] yourself to the place you were in the
[1:44:13] very beginning where you were spirits of
[1:44:15] God that never fell in the in the
[1:44:17] beginning. Praise the Lord.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; May God bless you richly.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:30] Let us pray
[1:44:32] as the musicians make their way.
[1:44:36] Heavenly Father, Lord God, we thank you
[1:44:40] this afternoon or this this day that you
[1:44:42] have made to bring to our remembrance,
[1:44:45] Lord Jesus. Father God, how we ought to
[1:44:49] look at ourselves in this hour to look
[1:44:52] at ourselves to be in the very image of
[1:44:55] God. to realize, Father God, that you
[1:44:58] have placed in us, oh God, a a a certain
[1:45:02] authority, a certain ability, Father
[1:45:04] God, Lord, uh to speak your word,
[1:45:07] Father, and to see it happen just as it
[1:45:10] says in your word, Lord. Father God, we
[1:45:13] don't want to operate under our
[1:45:14] privileges, Lord. We we want to take all
[1:45:17] that is ours, Father. Lord, when someone
[1:45:20] receives a gift f a gift, Lord God, they
[1:45:24] have the option to receive it or to
[1:45:26] reject it. Lord, we receive all of your
[1:45:28] gifts in this hour, Lord. Father,
[1:45:30] whatever that gift might be, Father, we
[1:45:32] we pray this morning that it would
[1:45:34] operate freely among us, Lord. That God,
[1:45:37] as we would unite together with the head
[1:45:40] that is you, Father, that God, we would
[1:45:43] leave here a powerful bride, not a
[1:45:45] defeated bride, but a powerful bride,
[1:45:48] Lord. A bride that knows the exploits of
[1:45:50] God and knows the greater works, Lord. A
[1:45:54] bride that has not uh h a lack anything
[1:45:57] through the days of her being, Lord. So
[1:46:00] God, we just thank you, Lord, that your
[1:46:02] word, Father God, can can can continue
[1:46:05] to seal us and bring us closer, Father,
[1:46:08] to that place of perfection. Lord, help
[1:46:10] us, Lord God, that we would all be
[1:46:12] prepared for that day. Lord, may we
[1:46:15] continue to earnestly contend for that

[1:52:02] I appreciate brother Jerry. Amen. On
[1:52:04] this morning and
[1:52:09] the highest form of creation
[1:52:12] and um just uh there was much spoken
[1:52:17] there. And I I I I need to mention um
[1:52:22] two two things before I forget.
[1:52:24] first um something off the off of the
[1:52:28] subject and then I'll come back to the
[1:52:29] subject. Off the subject is so good to
[1:52:32] see sister Lois. Amen. God bless you.
[1:52:37] God bless you. Amen. So good to see her.
[1:52:40] Amen. On this morning,
[1:52:43] uh that's off the subject,
[1:52:45] but but on the subject,
[1:52:48] um
[1:52:51] speaking turns with God. We we got to
[1:52:53] get in speaking terms. I don't know what
[1:52:55] translation he was using. Uh but he was
[1:52:59] saying that man became a speaking
[1:53:02] spirit.
[1:53:04] Uh this is this is this is rich and this
[1:53:09] is something that uh I believe God has
[1:53:13] uh called us back to. And um I'm I'm
[1:53:17] kind of getting ahead of myself, but I'm
[1:53:19] letting you all know uh as we're heading
[1:53:21] into uh the new year, God will give us
[1:53:25] He's already been working in my heart
[1:53:27] with a new theme for next year. And part
[1:53:29] of what Brother Jerry preached today
[1:53:31] goes along with that theme.
[1:53:34] And um and the other thing that I want
[1:53:36] to just just mention uh cuz and and the
[1:53:39] reason I'm saying these things because I
[1:53:41] I I don't know about you, but I am tired
[1:53:44] of living beneath
[1:53:48] my privileges.
[1:53:50] [Applause]
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; But first, you you have to recognize
[1:53:54] what your privilege is, right? And and
[1:53:58] you know if you um if you were pulled
[1:54:01] over by
[1:54:03] uh a police officer uh for going above
[1:54:06] the speed limit and uh but you knew you
[1:54:09] checking your your dash and you know I
[1:54:12] am not going above the speed limit. If
[1:54:14] they said 40 I was at you know 38. They
[1:54:17] know I wasn't at I wasn't over the speed
[1:54:19] limit. And if you if you know without a
[1:54:22] shadow of a doubt that you are
[1:54:23] underneath the speed limit when that
[1:54:25] police officer approaches you, you
[1:54:27] understand what your privileges and what
[1:54:29] your rights are and you and and and and
[1:54:32] when you when you understand that you
[1:54:34] don't just let people just write you a
[1:54:36] ticket for and you know you didn't do
[1:54:38] nothing wrong. What you have to do is
[1:54:40] stand up for yourself. And the way that
[1:54:42] you stand up for yourself is how you
[1:54:44] speak. It's the things that you allow to
[1:54:47] come out of your mouth. I know that I
[1:54:49] was not going above the speed limit. I
[1:54:52] was doing this. I saw you over there and
[1:54:54] I know for sure that I was not. I mean,
[1:54:56] you going to let things out your mouth.
[1:55:00] You ain't going to sit there just
[1:55:01] agreeing and man writing you up a $200
[1:55:03] ticket. I ain't taking this. I will take
[1:55:05] you to court. I mean, you going to let
[1:55:06] things come out of your mouth. It's time
[1:55:08] for you to let things come out of your
[1:55:10] mouth spiritually when you know who YOU
[1:55:13] ARE IN CHRIST.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; DON'T LET THE DEVIL JUST RUN ROUGHSIDE.
[1:55:18] DO WHATEVER he want to do. No, that's
[1:55:20] it's this thing is changing.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; So, I I I want to I want to say this to
[1:55:26] I want to say this. Um, brother Jerry
[1:55:31] walked into a scripture
[1:55:34] when he read Genesis 1
[1:55:37] uh verse 27.
[1:55:40] Is that right? Is that where he started?
[1:55:43] Did he start at 27 and 26? It start at
[1:55:46] 26. Okay. Well, I'm glad to hear that
[1:55:51] cuz brother Solomon
[1:55:54] just wrote a book
[1:55:57] on Genesis 126.
[1:56:01] Some of y'all saw him post this week of
[1:56:05] uh of him uh writing this book that the
[1:56:07] Lord inspired him to write. And it's all
[1:56:10] based on Genesis 126, right? And um the
[1:56:15] book is going to be released
[1:56:18] on Friday.

[1:56:33] book that he wrote is coming out on
[1:56:36] Friday and it's connected to the
[1:56:38] scripture that brother Jerry read today.
[1:56:41] Brother Jerry had no idea, right? But
[1:56:44] what I'm telling you is that God is
[1:56:46] moving and doing things in our midst.
[1:56:49] And and and and and I I won't I won't go
[1:56:52] ahead of the book. I've had a chance to

[1:57:19] get a head start on next year, get the
[1:57:21] book.
[1:57:24] But I'm telling you, we done walked into
[1:57:25] something and and and I'm I'm going just
[1:57:28] I'm going to just speak this out of my
[1:57:29] mouth. Our church going to change
[1:57:33] now. And let me let me I I mean I'm
[1:57:35] talking about I I'm talking about we
[1:57:37] going to walk in our spiritual
[1:57:39] blessings. We're going to walk in our
[1:57:42] natural blessings. We're going to walk
[1:57:44] in our physical blessings. We're going
[1:57:47] to walk in our material blessings. God
[1:57:49] is concerned about every area of our
[1:57:51] life.
[1:57:52] And and and this church is going to we
[1:57:55] going to we going to experience the
[1:57:57] fullness of God. We're going to have
[1:57:59] both his dynamics and his mechanics.
[1:58:02] Everything that God has, we going to
[1:58:04] have it right here.
[1:58:06] I I'm telling you,
[1:58:10] we on our way somewhere. And and and I
[1:58:13] just believe that this is, you know, I'm
[1:58:15] just telling you today, this was the
[1:58:17] beginning of something. There's a shift
[1:58:19] that's taking place. And uh you will be
[1:58:21] a part of that shift. But I I I'm just
[1:58:24] forewarning you and and I'm encouraging
[1:58:27] you uh be on be be be be be be be be be
[1:58:29] be be be be be be be be be be be be be

[1:58:32] Amen. I I I just I I when I sat there
[1:58:34] and I saw these scriptures, I said, "No,
[1:58:36] I just read this. I just read." I said,
[1:58:37] "This ain't nothing but God. This ain't
[1:58:39] nothing but God. This ain't nothing but
[1:58:41] God." Buy the book. Buy the book.
[1:58:44] Brother Solomon wrote the book and I
[1:58:46] think it's going to be a blessing to
[1:58:47] your soul. It's going to help us for
[1:58:49] next year. I believe that. Amen. And
[1:58:52] brother Solomon didn't know where I was
[1:58:53] going next year. He just pastor, I just
[1:58:56] got this book that I wrote. I think you
[1:58:59] might have shared it with me after we
[1:59:00] had preached that sermon on um on uh it
[1:59:05] shall prosper. It shall prosper. Um
[1:59:10] I I'm I'm getting ready to walk in that.
[1:59:12] I think I told y'all I said my business
[1:59:16] gonna prosper and I say I'm gonna hire
[1:59:19] people and and I'mma do this and I'mma
[1:59:21] do that. You know the Lord just blessed
[1:59:23] us. We hired a sister from the
[1:59:26] Philippines
[1:59:28] to work in our business for us.
[1:59:31] And um and and the way I look at this is
[1:59:35] that when you when you're hiring people
[1:59:36] to work with you, not just for you, but
[1:59:39] with you, right? uh you become a
[1:59:42] blessing to them
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; and God uses your business to be a
[1:59:47] blessing. Can you imagine uh being a
[1:59:49] blessing to somebody all the way over in
[1:59:51] another country? I say and we're going
[1:59:52] to add more employees from there.
[1:59:55] Hallelujah. I I was I was I was told I
[2:00:00] was told um about this, you know, this
[2:00:02] thing they call it uh virtual um virtual
[2:00:06] assistants, you know, and I said, "Well,
[2:00:08] virtual assistance, what is this all
[2:00:09] about? I I ain't never heard nothing
[2:00:11] about this. And they said, "Yeah, yeah,
[2:00:12] you can get people to answer your phone
[2:00:14] for you and do this." And I said, "Okay,
[2:00:15] I mean that that sound real good." And I
[2:00:18] said, "Now, where where are these
[2:00:19] people?" They said, "The India,
[2:00:20] Philippines, so and so." I say, "Oh."
[2:00:23] Said, "Okay, well, I just went to the
[2:00:25] Philippines." So, I said, "Let me uh
[2:00:27] reach out to the pastor over in the
[2:00:28] Philippines and talk to him and just ask
[2:00:30] him if he has anybody in his church that
[2:00:33] do this." And he say, "Hold on. I'll get
[2:00:35] back with you. I'll get back with you."
[2:00:36] And next thing you know, I got a a a a
[2:00:39] message from a a a sister say, "Yeah,
[2:00:41] pastor, that's exactly what I do." And I
[2:00:43] said, "Well, if it's one of the saints
[2:00:46] in the church doing it, yeah, I want to
[2:00:48] connect with with the believers."
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; And and I want this to be a blessing to
[2:00:53] your family. Oh, hallelujah. Right. and
[2:00:57] um and and and and Lord have mercy. I
[2:01:00] was telling my wife, I said, "I didn't
[2:01:01] even I didn't catch it, but um um you
[2:01:05] know, just the the just the way the Lord
[2:01:07] just kind of allowed this sister to kind
[2:01:09] of come into our life, and I'm just
[2:01:11] looking for greater things in the
[2:01:13] upcoming year. I'm looking for I'm
[2:01:16] looking for greater. I've already start
[2:01:18] laying claims on how many hours a week
[2:01:20] that I want in my business. I speak it
[2:01:24] out of my mouth on a daily basis.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; I I I'm I'm declaring a thousand hours a
[2:01:31] week on a weekly basis. That's my
[2:01:34] declaration. 1,000 hours a week is what
[2:01:37] I'm That's what I'm aiming for. Y'all
[2:01:40] going to have to start releasing some
[2:01:41] stuff out of your mouth. If you looking
[2:01:44] for things to change, I'm going to tell
[2:01:45] you where it starts changing. Out of
[2:01:47] your mouth first.
[2:01:49] And when you when you release it into
[2:01:51] the atmosphere, you watch that thing
[2:01:53] begin to come. If you you want a house,
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; you want a house, you're going to have
[2:01:59] to start speaking some things out of
[2:02:00] your mouth.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, I'm I'm I'm I'm getting myself
[2:02:04] out here now. There was Let me just say
[2:02:07] this. I'm I'm I'mma I'mma try to I'mma
[2:02:09] try to cut off real quick, but I years
[2:02:11] ago years ago um I was um I was working
[2:02:17] and I felt I was being underpaid.
[2:02:20] I felt that I deserved a particular
[2:02:22] salary and I was being underpaid and I
[2:02:25] woke up one morning and uh and I looked
[2:02:28] in the mirror and I said, "You are a
[2:02:30] $50,000 man."
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; I said it. you are a $50,000 man. And
[2:02:39] and you know, and and um I said, you
[2:02:41] know, at that time, I mean, that was
[2:02:43] that was a good a salary, right? And uh
[2:02:45] and I spoke that out of my mouth. And
[2:02:48] not only did I speak it, but I believed
[2:02:51] I was a $50,000 man.
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; Come on now. You can't be calling
[2:02:56] yourself a $50,000 man when you ain't
[2:02:58] nothing but a $10,000 man.
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; Cuz you work you you not working like a
[2:03:03] $50,000 MAN. BUT I SPOKE WHAT I believe.
[2:03:06] And with and within two years, I had
[2:03:10] become what I spoke.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; But here's the problem. When I got there
[2:03:20] and I had already accomplished it, now
[2:03:23] what I'm going to be after this.
[2:03:29] And what God did, I might as well just
[2:03:32] tell it. But what God did, he he let he
[2:03:34] let me get to 50 and fill it, but then
[2:03:38] he doubled me.
[2:03:42] [Music]
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; Ah,
[2:03:48] then God doubled me in my in my career.
[2:03:50] God doubled me.
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; See, see, I'm going to tell you
[2:03:53] something. God would go, he'll do the
[2:03:55] exceeding,
[2:03:58] the abundant.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. IT'LL BE
[2:04:01] ABOVE
[2:04:03] ALL YOU CAN ask or even think.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; But God just want us operating in a
[2:04:10] certain
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; area.
[2:04:14] And and I'm declaring we going to go
[2:04:16] through a whole year of operating like
[2:04:18] this. Not just no one time situation.
[2:04:21] We're going to go through a whole year
[2:04:23] starting in January.
[2:04:26] That's it, sis. It's going to become the
[2:04:28] norm.
[2:04:29] And you I and and Wednesday night I'mma
[2:04:32] probably have to shut down the
[2:04:33] testimony, sir, because y'all going to
[2:04:34] have so many testimonies. JUST PASTOR, I
[2:04:37] GOT ONE. PASTOR, I GOT TESTIMONIES JUST
[2:04:40] FLYING OUT OF HERE.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; I'm just letting you know what's getting
[2:04:44] ready to come. I I it it's starting. I'm
[2:04:48] It's not going to start January 1st. It
[2:04:51] already started
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; and all we're going to do is flow into
[2:04:55] it.
[2:04:57] the highest form of creation
[2:04:59] [Music]
[2:05:00] speaking turns with God. This where we
[2:05:03] headed back to. I I tell you, brother
[2:05:05] Jerry, God bless you. I I thank God for
[2:05:08] you. Thank you for
[2:05:10] for just bringing this to our hearts.
[2:05:12] This is this going this this this this
[2:05:15] is a blessing. Amen. Let's let's pray.
[2:05:18] Let's pray. Father, we thank you,
[2:05:21] Lord. I I just
[2:05:24] I'm encouraged,
[2:05:26] Lord, by what I see happening here in
[2:05:28] the midst of this this this this group
[2:05:31] of believers.
[2:05:34] God, even this morning, you would allow
[2:05:38] me just to see a a scripture and and all
[2:05:41] night I'm I'm wrestling with the enemy
[2:05:44] with this ankle of mine and trying to
[2:05:48] figure out what did I do, what happened,
[2:05:49] and just don't know. is just a devil
[2:05:52] attacking.
[2:05:53] But Lord, you you you you let me see
[2:05:55] there in the book of Nehemiah that there
[2:05:58] they did have no swelling of feet for 40
[2:06:01] years as they walked through the the
[2:06:04] wilderness. Father, if you would not
[2:06:07] allow the people to even ex experience
[2:06:09] one swollen foot, then I'm not accepting
[2:06:12] that from the devil right now.
[2:06:15] So Lord, I'm going to I'm going to keep
[2:06:17] speaking that over my body until my body
[2:06:20] comes in line with my confession.
[2:06:22] And Father, I just I I believe as as
[2:06:25] brother Jerry just come, Lord, to tell
[2:06:26] us that we we're on speaking terms with
[2:06:28] you, Lord. This is what you restore.
[2:06:31] This is what restoration brought us back
[2:06:33] to. This what this ultimate restoration
[2:06:36] looks like for the believer, Father. It
[2:06:38] brings us back to this spot. So Lord, I
[2:06:41] I I I just appreciate the sermon and
[2:06:43] appreciate our our brother. Thank you
[2:06:45] for the other brothers, Lord, and how he
[2:06:47] was able to just pull from each one and
[2:06:50] and Lord, just kind of bring that into
[2:06:52] his sermon, Father, this morning. We can
[2:06:54] see you just moving in the midst. And
[2:06:55] and then even seeing, Father, how you
[2:06:58] would inspire Brother Solomon to write a
[2:07:00] book from Genesis 126. And father from
[2:07:03] that he said he he announced that he was
[2:07:05] releasing his books on on on next Friday
[2:07:07] and to come here on this Sunday morning
[2:07:09] and watch a brother pick up the
[2:07:11] scripture that he was inspired from.
[2:07:13] Only you could do things like this. You
[2:07:16] are moving in our midst.
[2:07:21] Father, we just we we we believe amen
[2:07:23] that um Lord Jesus that we will we will
[2:07:28] experience your best in every area of
[2:07:32] our life.
[2:07:35] This journey of restoration
[2:07:39] that you've called us to, Father,
[2:07:40] throughout uh these past two years, we
[2:07:43] have watched it manifest right before
[2:07:45] our very eyes. We've watched it. And now
[2:07:49] God uh we know that you will take us
[2:07:52] Lord just to to to to maybe just another
[2:07:55] theme but we can see father how you are
[2:07:57] connecting these things and Lord just to
[2:07:59] where you want to how you just really
[2:08:01] want to overflow in the lives of the
[2:08:03] people but it starts with what we speak
[2:08:05] out of our mouth. We're speaking our
[2:08:07] healings. We're speaking deliverance
[2:08:10] over our families. Lord we're speaking
[2:08:13] uh to our businesses on our jobs. We're
[2:08:16] going to prosper. Whatever we set our
[2:08:18] hands to do, we will prosper
[2:08:23] cuz that's what you promised us, oh God.
[2:08:26] And Lord, we're going to walk in that.
[2:08:29] We're going to walk in the fullness of
[2:08:30] it. I pray your blessings upon your
[2:08:33] people as they leave this place, but not
[2:08:35] your presence. May we go meditating and
[2:08:37] thinking on the things that have been
[2:08:39] spoken. Father, many of the saints
[2:08:42] that'll be traveling, coming back home
[2:08:43] from South Carolina. We pray traveling
[2:08:46] mercies over each one. And may you
[2:08:48] continue to watch over Sister Rachel,
[2:08:51] Lord, as she's carrying the baby. And
[2:08:53] Father, you know, all uh that her and
[2:08:55] brother Steven have gone through and
[2:08:57] just ask Lord that you give him victory
[2:08:58] all the way through this. Thank you for
[2:09:01] manifesting your word. There will be no
[2:09:04] barren in your midst.
[2:09:07] I remember brother Smiley speaking that
[2:09:09] word, Father, some years ago and how the
[2:09:11] inspiration struck that.
[2:09:14] We're seeing the manifestation of it,
[2:09:16] Lord, right before our very eyes,
[2:09:18] Lord Jesus. If we can see these things
[2:09:20] happening, Lord, then we ought to see
[2:09:23] all the other things happening in our
[2:09:25] midst as well. We give you glory. We
[2:09:29] give you honor. We give you praise. It's
[2:09:32] in Jesus' name that we pray. Amen. Amen.
[2:09:37] Let's give the Lord a hand clap. Hand
[2:09:38] clap of praise. Amen.
[2:09:43] Amen. Glory to God. You can be seated.
[2:09:46] Uh the brothers will come to dismiss
[2:09:48] you. Amen. At this time, God bless you.
