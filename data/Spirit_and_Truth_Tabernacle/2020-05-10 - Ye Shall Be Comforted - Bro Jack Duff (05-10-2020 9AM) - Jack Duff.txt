Day [Music] sir appreciate appreciate her we want to discover a few announcements and now as we just from the service of those that are joining us online been trying to make enough grace to make everybody's experience a little bit better and also try to keep it consistent Lord bless us with a new computer this weekend a manly California on computer were streaming both periscope and Facebook we understand that there was a issue so we went back to original setup and I'm just a lot of changes that we went bacon just renovate your brother's experiences might better so just bear with us made at that and I'm just [Music] this week we had a little problem with love the sound system and we had to make some changes last night to try to get that fix for the day so we're not really sure what all could be contributed to what some just just bear with us a man in that so let me quickly just say we know that here in our area things are starting to change live for Palm Beach County Broward County and daycare they call phase 1 phase 2 phase 3 and we're waiting just to see how things are gonna kind of settle out so as a church will continue to do what we have been doing amen continuing a social distancing washing my hands and then all of those things as we come into the house in the morning our desires eventually get everybody back together again but for right now let's just - we are we'll keep you updated so the virtual service always if I look to you that that happens at 7:30 again joined virtually via periscope or via Facebook no Friday services until further notice and also our service services will and for the second group and again those services will be streamed via Facebook fi periscopes of that in mind I wanted to also just announce we are we have a church app that many older forebay with but the company that we bought the that we're paying for the app through they actually have sold they'd have to another company they've been asking us since the beginning of the year to migrate to the new platform we have got most of it working what we were asked everyone to view adjust download on your phone that map is called the church app th each church at the church and if you just download that to your phone then you just find the church spirit 'triple tabernacle and you'll see that new app and if you you know you see all those just different functions that we have there and if you would just download that start using it if you run into any problems with anything please just let us know something try to get things corrected within the next month or so we'll have to start moving over to that platform because they're asking us to do don't do that so make good more my church app a platform to the church at the platform zone just saw both of them will be working for now but probably within a month or so the only thought Church Apple works please start downloading that manages follow us there all right you think that's that so as far as giving a man we continue to use giving through PayPal as well as the room - yeah PayPal I can mention see all it does charge a number of fees if you don't do it just right so if you if you have a cash at Macau and encourage if you want to give online maybe the best just to do the cash after that you don't have to worry about the email address and all that using paypal just make sure that you giving that job $43 you want to give to a friend you wanna make sure you select that option to give to a friend and they email address that you use is giving at John four to three so again if you have cash that is you don't have to worry about that just use the church their spirit of team cash a foul spirit of t mo you can give their war news big now just make sure you give to a friend use giving in John 4:23 now Morgan as to fritz email address I think has give to the family of friends with something like that with that not eliminate fees man when they don't take from us if we give their PayPal so just remember for that no fees would cash that but PayPal we do have that and if we don't forgive amen not as a friend so let's pray about giving those that are in the sanctuary that will continue use the box that we have there on the table wooden box they man free America for today finally thank you for the opportunity and the privilege that we have to be able to come into the house of the Lord and God those that are joining online they're still coming into the house brain father Joe Spirit we felt wherever you people are gathered as we Lord have come more to bring our thousand offer into the house of the Lord that's what you told us that you were to bring baptized now that's what we're doing today we just trust in God that you may use it for the furtherance of the kingdom here on earth may you continue to me than these of you continue to exceed the expectations of easily bored this has been a very challenging season but God week and we can say in the midst of it you have still been good to us you've made away youth open doors that we couldn't see you in for five in a wage that went beyond our expectation and father we are we are truly truly grateful just bless me ma'am argument we give cheerfully in the name of the Lord Jesus three man crazy thank you thank you musicians appreciate you all we will just prepare to go into the word of the Lord on today a man and we want to wish all the mothers a happy person happy mother's day and garen say happy birthday but a happy Mother's Day to all of our mothers and Men those that are join us online we wish you a man a happy Mother's Day and just trust that the Lord would just bless you a man on today I got just one little scripture that I want to read a man this morning and exit to stand with me as we just read this this is gonna come from the book of Isaiah chapter 66 a man Isaiah chapter 66 and we'll just read one passage amen from here his first 13 they men in Isaiah chapter 66 praise the Lord a man the scripture says as one whom his mother comforted so will I comfort you and he shall be comforted in Jerusalem they may let's read that again as one whom his mother confident so will I comfort you and ye shall be confident in Jerusalem a man let's just bow in a word of Prayer over the word of the Lord that has been read father we thank you for the the word thank you for every promise that you have written in Scripture and God we just pray that the Holy Spirit would take control of the thought that is being presented this morning to the Saints god I pray especially for the mothers that you would encourage each one and strengthen each one you know the various things that they go through and they endure but God how we are grateful for each one of them and Lord the stand that they take and God how they have raised their children how they are raising their children Lord just the roles that they play in our lives we just appreciate each one Oh God and acts a special blessing upon every mother today everyone that's within sound of my voice may you give a special blessing to them as our prayer in Jesus name we ask it amen amen you can be seated since it is Mother's Day I wanted to just take a thought that would be geared towards the mothers a man and and I know that brother Branham there was a quote that I have here we tell you know mother's day shouldn't just be celebrated one day out of the year should be every day a man 365 days we should appreciate Mother's a man but I am glad that there is at least one day set aside that we gotta stop and take time and acknowledge and appreciate mama a man for all that she is and and I pray that everybody that has a mother a man that's that's present even if she is far away and send at least some no to something let him know that you love and that you appreciate it you know you're given a card or some flowers a present or something but let mama know that you love a man so here you know we want to just use for a title this is for our mothers ye shall be comforted a man ye shall be comforted praise the Lord only only the Lord knows what a mama goes through amen only only the Lord knows what she's feeling and and and and identifying oftentimes men we cannot identify with the feelings that the mama has a man we're kind of tough and we are you know not as sentimental you know but but mama has a heart like no other a man I mean you won't remember the story that brother Branham told us of of the the the cruel hunter a man the one with the lizard eyes and you know and lizard I burped with go out and hunt and he would he would take his little horn and he would call he would act as if he was a little fawn and he would blow that that little horn and when you know acting as if it was fun and notice now in the story that the Prophet tells us the daddy deer is nowhere to be found praise the Lord somebody the daddy there's nowhere to be found but but but mama has this sense that the baby's in trouble and since the baby's in trouble mama will go through whatever it is that she have to go through in order to protect this baby a man when it's when it's in her nature to actually run from the hunter when she sees the hunter she notices that the hunters there if she's picked up his scent or you know something like that this mother has instinct to get out of harm's way but because her baby it's in trouble then she Rises amen and looks the hunter right in the eye I don't care about your bullet I don't care about your gun but I'm gonna stand here and take one for my baby hallelujah Mama's are willing to go through things that a man others may not go through Mama's will put up with things that others may not put up with praise the Lord somebody a man when you if you've ever been in trouble or something like that and you know you knew you couldn't go to your daddy with that alright somebody might as well be honest you could go to Daddy with that you went to mama because mama has a certain spirit but I mean even even the day we we we fought it we 50 we Amen if you believe you six and you still got your mama if you going through something you gonna go get the mama real quick mama got a way to comfort you mama got a way of speaking mama got away of saying things a certain way and ain't no voice like Mama's voice hallelujah I don't care who you hear from but when you hear from it brings comfort a man it does something very it does something for your soul glory to God thank God for Mama's right here you know I want to just encourage the mothers she shall be comforted and I don't know I I do have a couple of poems that I was gonna read one of them I know you don't have in the back but the other one I got one from rep Brent I don't know if you got that one back there but that'll be for later on if it's there but this other one right here I got is from Herbert farm ham and I just wanted to read this it says God took the fragrance of a flower the majesty of a tree the gentleness of morning dew the calm of a quiet see the beauty of the twilight hour' the soul of a starry night the laughter of a rippling Brook the grease of a bird in flight then God fashioned from these things a creation like no other a man and when his masterpiece was through he called it simply mother a man a man Herbert farm ham wrote that that poem there and I just thought it was very fitting here for Mother's Day I want to read to you from a couple of quotes out of the message mother's day I thank God that the Prophet preached on this subject and and and I always love going back to this sermon especially on this day and pulling out some things that we can we can just get comfort from this first thing that he says here to us his mother is so great praise the Lord he says you know the first one that receives you in this life is your mother no one can touch you because you're conceived and she bears you under her heart Amen this is where we all have a special connection to mama all right she bears you under heart and and and and and and you know whatever whatever we do this is one thing if we can all just understand this connection that people have when I'm born of this this this particular lady I when when I was conceived it was in her womb and and and and and before anybody knew me before anybody saw me right you know I was growing inside of her but before I could come to the earth and be an expression a man of my father I had to grow inside of her I had to be nurtured by her she had to watch what she ate in order to take care of me come on somebody right you know and and and there was so much that she didn't make sure that I arrived here safely praise the Lord and so so so now when I realized how important that process was you're not gonna lie you're not gonna come to me when I become an adult right and and then try to come up with something to put a wedge between me and my mama hello somebody right I mean we got to understand no matter no matter what has happened between your mama Mama's still special if it wasn't for mama you wouldn't be here praise the Lord Amen also if it weren't for daddy wouldn't be here but but but today is Mother's Day so you know you got to learn to appreciate mama you're right you ain't gonna get so old come on somebody and go through some things where you can't you can't it just say mama thank you praise the Lord I don't care what I don't care about your disagreements there must come a time when you set that to the side he said mama I appreciate yes praise Aloha they think about what she did to bring you here glory to God all right let's go on now she bears you under our heart and she is the first to know you and the first in this life to hold you then when you're born she is one of the first first hands that touch you and wipes back to tears out of your eyes she's the first one to pat you pat you and to love you and to coo over you in this is your mother now I think that there's not enough honor that we can give to a mother mother is first with the child and she has a great responsibility of what that child will be a man Mama's the first with a child and she has a great spice responsibility of what that child would be it would be based upon the way that mother starts that child on the path that it must travel mother has a responsibility from God to place that child on the right Road and I think that's why Mother's has a special little touch so if you had a mother and your life that is placed on the right Road that taught you about Jesus that took you to church so you can learn about Jesus that that great for you pray in front of you a man prayed amen even when not maybe if she prayed against some of the things that you doing you want to appreciate a mama like that hallelujah and I know when I was coming up there was times where I didn't really want to go to church a man I didn't really want to I didn't really want to do some of the things that I saw mama doing but I tell you what I can appreciate today a man that my mama was consistent in what she was doing when the Lord got ahold of our life we all realized God it done something different a man I can go back in in my mind and just remember one time we were in the house and we were all so hungry amen we were we were ready to eat him and and you know we just depended on mama to cook we just depended on that and I sometimes you take things for granted but mama what my mama would have the food already and we just we gobbled it up you know but this one day we was all hungry like where is mama and we were open up the front door and we see all the vehicles outside and we know my man left the house she's somewhere around here but where is mama I mean we hungry mama we we want to eat mama and we could not find mama for nothing I mean we looked in the backyard we looked in the front yeah we looked on the side of the house we looking everywhere where is mama and and and none of us confinement then all of a sudden we went till we had a van at that time and and we went to that we went to the van and we found mama inside the van praying that time it didn't mean as much as it means to me now a man by all I can think about is I want something to eat and I was interrupting prayer time but but I can appreciate a mama that came he found in the kitchen but she can be found on her knees somewhere praying for her children that's that's a mama that's racing on the right way a mama that that's gonna influence them in the right way and the scripture tells that when you train up a child the way he should go when they get oh he warmed apart thank God for momma's like that mom I want to tell you if you got away with child this morning you will be confident you will be comfortable praise the Lord look at this the Prophet goes on to say I know a boy in this city and I think his mother's present now he's almost my age but I don't say this to hurt the mother I'm in the same quote says I don't say this to hurt the mother because that she has enough hurts a man we don't say things to hurt mama mama got enough hurts I hate man look you put mama through hurt and if she got mo children their mother children putting her through hurt right she got enough hurts but you know why he went all to her stepmom a guy she always got enough room for you and your problems it's a true thing a man no matter what no matter what the other kids are putting up through she'll still got she's still got time to listen to what you got the same hallelujah a man a man listen since I'm she's got enough verse as all mothers but her but the boy dreams and he drinks heavy and when it gets real drunk he will come home and jump in the bed with his mother and put his arms around her and he's got grandchildren what kind of man is it's he's got now now not now not now me as a man I'm gonna look at this fella say now what in the world you got grandchildren and you jumping in the bed with your mama what's the matter with you right as a man I'm gonna come down on him heart but his mama wants to feel his touch his mama wants to know shoot me make sure you're gonna be all right son yeah and if you made it back home one more time then God was protecting you my prayer was answered I'm happy to have you I'm happy to have you next to me to feel your touch mama thinks about it a little different it says he's got grandchildren but there's something about just the part of a mother that seems to take a different place than anything else can touch that is in this life humanly speaking at their seat he tells us that there's nothing like a mother's touch so when this man is even at his law and sustained maybe he's feeling real bad about what he's done but he goes home and it just tries to get next to mama even with his the man got grandchildren but he wants to be next to mama because mama brings something that nobody else can thank God for godly mothers all right this scripture that we read here and I said amen 66 verse 13 as one whom his mother confidence I mean even our Lord and Lord puts this in the word as one whom his mother confidence a man he didn't say to father he put mother here and as one whom whom his mother confidence so will I comfort you there's nothing like a mother's touch there's nothing like the comfort of a mother Amen my mama like mama was just designed to be able to bring comfort her voice is softer than daddy's right Amen I'll just just so much about her and she just she just you know her her nature is different than daddy's she's designed to bring comfort she says I thank God I mean we meet both of them in our lives but amen it's just something and as we just celebrate the Mother's Day there's just something about being able to get comfort from mama it's somebody being able to go and talk to her and just just just my mom's going through this and my mom going through and it's something about being me to get godly wisdom Amen for a mama glory to God godly comfort my momma got away of saying things that just just just keeps us all together look at this as one who his mother confidence so will I comfort you and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem now I was looking at this word comfort just wanted to kind of get a couple definitions and and one set a state of physical ease freedom from pain or constraint you know and we realized that you know our mothers can do that you know to us a state of physical ease and freedom from pain and constraint if you've ever had what we call a boo-boo you know something hurtin you go running to mama to see if she can kind of ease the pain a little bit and you know children as children it was and I don't want to take this away from the kids I got to be careful about this but but as children it was just something in our psyche there if we had a little boo-boo a little scratch a little whatever we go running to mama somehow if mama just blow on it somebody just blow on it somehow we felt a man we still bleeding but we felt better because mama blew on it hallelujah what comfort our mama brings hallelujah hallelujah glory to God thank God for say a state of physical ease and freedom from pain or constraint another definition that they had here is the easing or alleviation of a person's feelings Amen the easing or alleviation of a person's feelings Amen feelings of grief or feelings of distress it was the easing of that when when a person is bringing comfort they're trying to ease your feelings they're trying to ease your grief they're trying to ease your distress hallelujah and I don't care you might having trouble on the job but you can somehow call mama mama might not have worked a day in her life don't even know what it means to go through some of the things that go through but somehow mama has the right word to say in order to alleviate or ease the pain or distress that you have hallelujah glory to God amen now I say that because you know it's very easy sometimes that when folk get married amen the wife wants to sometimes play the part of mama she wants to cook she wants to eat this she wants to do that but i'ma tell you amen that there's a connection that is me at birth Amen with Mama that nobody could ever replace how so so in families I wanna encourage the families don't try to come between the relationship of a mother and a daughter or a mother and a son don't try to come between a relationship because it's something that happened at birth encouraging don't discourage it praise the Lord somebody all right all right all right look at this I was thinking a man on this this message the the resurrection of gyruss daughter this quote came around and just talking to talk about a mother here Amen how God was answering her prayer and when a Mama's prayers being answered her pain is being alleviated her distress is being alleviated when God is answering her prayer now look at this in this message to the resurrection of Jarvis's daughter I forgot to bring my timeout here so y'all just bear with me huh since our text this dealing tonight of course with the resurrection of the of Jairus daughter our our kind loving Savior has spent much time just before this he was busy all the time moving from place to place crossing seas stealing waves give him maniacs their right mind he was always busy about the father's business he was a very humble son and obedience even to death night before that or two he crossed the sea and the disciples had been very weary and he had still the sea for them glory to God crossed all the way over into Coderre where there was a maniac taking the chance of crossing a stormy sea when the devils of the sea swore they drown him that night but he went over there and the cry of one person Jesus moved at the cry of one person one poor maniac lost his mind perhaps perhaps a good name at one time in and maybe mommy you got a wayward child that perhaps was a good man at one time perhaps a good woman at one time because it's not the end that you really want to be confident they made me thank God for the deliverance that he brings in the middle but what I really want to see is my child make it yes hallelujah hallelujah that really brings comfort they mean if what God is telling me can make it back to the father's house then I know I'll be comforted alright look at this look at this he says probably perhaps a good man one time walked up right before God but probably got in the wrong crowd might be started drinking or something lost his mind and he lived out in the tombs where the demons live but Budiman changed and he has supernatural powers he break those chains and jump o men and beat them and kill them when they come back look at this and that poor fella maybe he had an old gray-headed mother somewhere glory praying for him Jesus cross to see all the way over into Ghaderi to give mercy to that man he'd do the same tonight where one humble soul is calling to him he crossed the cease or leave the heavens to answer that prayer it's the same Jesus yesterday the Dean fella I love that Oh gray hair mama was praying for her son that was in the tubes a sign that was living in the graveyard see a man I don't care how low you go you can't go Lord enough when mama don't stop praying for you praise the Lord mama will never give up on that child I don't care how far they get away from God mama will still be praying and if he has to cross a stormy sea to get to just one God will do that why because he's answering Mama's friend mama you shall be comforted [Applause] a man you shall be comforted you know I think of a man of this and it just just drives my mind my mind my mind to you know just a mama that saw a boy get real low perhaps he was a good man one time and this fellow was well he was a decent boy got it on the wrong crowd got out running with some young ladies a man he was outside of his League hallelujah mama knowing you're actually you better leave that one alone glory to God Monica I mean you know the property talked about a wild stair mama got or what they call into intuition a man this not me right about that right mama can pick up they mama know how to ask certain questions mama know how to give her an interview praise the Lord somebody see young lady don't worry about it but mama doing that because one day you gonna be mama and you're gonna have to learn how to give them interview questions how to act certain things oh my goodness we were we were at a little restaurant a man up in Fort Pierce and and you know and and and and there was a family sitting out and and I guess the mother first time meeting this lady at dinner hallelujah amen and they think you know how sometimes we want to set the seat that this to put it in a certain setting put it out there in the public so momma don't go off on you in public come on somebody y'all might as well say me we're gonna we'll try to talk to this thing up so so I'm gonna put it in a certain setting to kind of protect this ain't man and I saw this man sitting down he you know he uh he got his I guess no wife or something like that and momma just sitting there she's just eating and enjoying and this is just start asking a few questions mama dressed you know she take a little bite of this and she asks another question and then she take another bite listen this Shaq's another question I get one of the questions like well where do you work at what type of work you do for a living just say I work at a Chinese restaurant okay you want to keep on eating so now that you just said something to mama right and so some I was gonna try to start digging a little bit motor finding out what you really do at the Chinese restaurant praise the Lord she want to know who her husband is kid I mean who our son is connected to praise the Lord right so so don't get upset Amen if a mother start taking you through those interrogations glory to God what you want to do is live a life that when mama come you got some good answer praise the Lord somebody same thing for a son Amen when that daddy started tailgating you better be living a life that you can provide some good answers hallelujah somebody amen but you know this this uh this this one young man got it got away from you know maybe the way that he was raised and as he got away from it he got sick he got out there with the wrong crowd he end up getting sick brother Brandon tells us the story and his boys so sick his father's not around but the momma's Darren a man in Memphis Tennessee and there the mother is praying for a son and and mama know how to just just intercede I mean and see the thing about this is mama mama weren't really so concerned about the Boyd getting healed the thing that meant most of my mother thing that brought her comfort is that my board would make it to heaven I don't want him to die a sinner right and he just screaming it's dark in here mama it's dark in here it's dark in here and he just going on and on you know with all this said and Mama's just praying like mama she said she say now now Lord I'm your shooter might but but where he's sure Elisha say say I know I'm the my beware is he likes you and then she said he say all she said lord I just I just don't know what to do and then she was praying a prayer like that she identifies herself in the Word of God because God to respond based on the prayer that she prayed this one Jess Jess Lord send me a preacher send me the priests no she say I wanna I mean to see line shot and there was only one Elijah on the earth day at that time and it just so happened that this Elijah was flying right over the top of her city and because of a prayer God calls the planes are having mechanical failure they had to bring the plane down glory to God hallelujah when they brought it down they could not put it back in the air they put everybody up in a hospital minute in a hotel and here comes a prophet at the hotel room the next morning walking down the street bother by being led by the Spirit of God the spirit states has to keep walking just keep walking and you know a song the Prophet was a man was singing the same song that brother solomon brought me up home Amen I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of him a matter that's he's singing to get into the spirit walking into a neighborhood that he said I'm not sure I should be here but I feel the Spirit of God telling me to keep walking he gets down there as his crossing as he's walking down the street and just singing in the spirit there's a latest in tonight that she's so sure she heard from God she'd witness to that side by the road service on the inside dying but she's standing out there because she's got a she's got a a peace that God is about to bring her comfort here come brother ran and walking down the street oh my now I wonder what the Lord showed her because brother Brennaman tell us all that he just said the briefcase but I think the Lord might have showed her a little bit more because of the neighborhood she was in she knew would have been a little strange for a certain man to be walking in that neighborhood do you get what I'm saying I think God showed her a little bit more if she could see the briefcase she can also see the me praise cops God works on both things but here here she's standing there and he's just singing I'm so glad I can sing with him and and why are you coming back she just yells ha good

heard him say this talking here is talking here and he say uh I say mama you pray and mama got to praying and brother branham said just did something to me say I knew that woman had been in touch with God I just just by the words that she formed inside of her prayer she won Jess Amen repeating things just to be Stan but she had said there was something coming from my heart when she was talking to her God hallelujah here she began to pray and as she was praying that the Prophet said my he just felt tears he said she said hey man he's just just wiping tears for his eyes and he said well I pray

he said well is it he'd say saw this fella running up to him boy I got a job now he's in good company Loree to God he went from being a man on a death bed but now he's got a good job glory to God and

when he begin to serve the Lord that is the greatest conference that's the greatest comfort that any mother can receive is when their children are serving God hallelujah this other situation a man of a mother that received comfort her distress it alleviated her distress a man if there's so many examples but I want to read a quote here go wake Jesus go awake Jesus was blessed by this I happen to be just just studying last night and I don't think ever ran into this particular quote before and just bless my heart it says and now we see everything just exactly in line and knowing that we're in the

today let father and mother unite again a man and let me just encourage my brothers if your wife has had your children praise the Lord sacrifice her body to have your children on Mother's Day make

come on somebody alright now trouble sentient glory and all that we've been all that we see them do Harry straighten up our homes how he would make father and mother unite again you've seen that husband and wife come back together he has he'll just see laying there with cancer's when many of you has brought them in bottles and jugs and pans and doctors has testified sign statements I got piles of them and put a box full and even 5 K 5 cases witness of the raising of the dead after being dead for hours and hours well from the longest one I've knowed of was from nine o'clock one morning she 11 that night about C so this was a mother that had a child that was dead if they're in Mexico and and when the child died the mama had heard of a testimony of a man that had been healed of his blindness and she said I have God could hear that man he been blind for a long time if God can heal that man I was blindness I'm not gonna be satisfied not being able to at least get my child into a prayer line and then in this mama hallelujah was a mama that would not take no for an answer we need some mamas like that then when trouble strikes Mama's faith beginning to rise to a level that you've never seen before sometimes as fathers we might say mommy really got that much faith let something happen to her child you'll see Mama's faith come rising up somebody right so so so this mama here are childless it's a it's dead look boy and died mama say I got to get there to that prayer line had the boy in our arms four hours since nine o'clock that morning I believe was 11 o'clock tonight she finally got to the church over 12 hours dead here mama come come to the church and when she get there that I should say we saw her you don't have a prayer card a prayer what she mean understanding language a prayer what you don't have a prayer cup I'm not interested in having a prayer card I just need the man that pray for the man that got us on site to pray for my baby that's all I need hallelujah and say they say the lady was just saw she didn't have breakout so you know they tried to sit her down she got up she started moving between the legs of the ushers when a dead baby in arms getting underneath their legs and and they said ma'am please you disrupt them service set it down it was such a disruption that they had to tell the Prophet up in the pulpit what was going on so brother Branham say brother Jack Moore go on down and pray for the lady she don't know me you don't know me from you or you for me just go pray for the lady in settle her spirit hallelujah glory so his brother Jack was on his way brother Branham was praying for somebody but that lady's faith heaven let it cause the Prophet go into a vision he didn't even know it was her baby but he saw a smiling baby and that lady made it her personal mission praise God if I can put it this way she snapped into glory to God she said brother Branham said stop brother Jack bring her food I just saw a vision of a baby I don't know this is the word by bringing forth and I pray for that lady went running to the platform gay brother branham her baby and she left there comforting she was carrying her back home she was walking back home with that baby that mama went to church and she left Church comforted mama you can come to church this morning and you can leave protectors hallelujah but the rest of that quote that I just read goes a little further this brother branham say he it says the longest when I'm no Duff was from nine o'clock one morning until 11 that night about C and the next part of this Pope the next paragraph says no I beg your pardon a little baby over there that the mother had carried it all night in her arms so this is a different testimony a little baby over there that the mother had carried it all night her arms it died afternoon she carried it all night in her arms come to the meeting down there california-- match this mama with a dead baby in her arms carried at the whole thing all through the night maybe so much same you need to put your baby down this you need to do this you don't lost your mind no not yet they told me about a meeting they told me what God was healing the sick and I'm taking my baby to the meeting but your baby's dead I realized that but you know what it's only been 24 hours it ain't 72 hours yet so I'm gonna I'm gonna carry my baby are you gonna give me a ride or not if you won't give me a ride I'll walk to the meeting this is where Mama's faith is activated because of what she's going through hallelujah said she sets up a little paper there the mother had carried it all night in her arms it died one afternoon she carried it all night in her arms or came to the meeting down there in California and I was talking I would I was taken out that afternoon so he'd get ready to leave after this last service then I was taken out that afternoon he died had died the afternoon before that and she drove all night got there couldn't get around the place my god and she laid a cold little form in my arms brother Brown I had no vision that she was coming here he is this plane is just with faith drove all night and just drops a baby into the prophet's arms Oh glory glory glory glory glory glory says sheep sheep she laid a cold little foam in my arms of a dead baby that had died the day before that and standing holding that little baby now can you imagine what would you do somehow to did that to you now here's the thing if they brought you to baby they got confidence that when you pray God gonna do something so somebody got that kind of faith what you need to do is join with their faith and all you got is what the Prophet did just offered prayer just offered prayer write his little body got warm a man he turned over and looked and I handed it back to its mother that's right here this baby had 24 hours later the lady brings up baby puts it in the prophet's arms the project raised a little prayer the baby gets warm and raises right back up and goes with the mama if somebody got prayer I mean got fainter brain there there there baby in a condition like that behalf prayer then you want to have faith enough at least to pray for the baby see Mama's faith will get anointed when something happens to her child she'll drive a devil out drive all night long just to get to the meet mama gotta find a way to get her baby some attention glory to God glory to God glory to God right you know I mean you think the love of a mother you think about Hattie right had it right had opportunity to get whatever she wanted because and you know how I had it right got the opportunity you want to know what had it right did two things two things had it right did one she gave to a building fund oh that's the truth you know you want

believe the same God that provided Iran favored him is the same God that provided square Surya that's nothing but the truth just by making that one statement brother brother branham saying anointing came into the room brother's hat had they was eating a man and say one brother face just fell in the plate fell in the plate from the anointing and he's there he just just underneath the North I wish

given to us God will give the child to you I don't know I don't know what the acts were I got my sister got my parents I'm poor look just just you know what Satan it was the wrong time for you to knock them boys you did it the wrong time here the mama looked over in the corner and saw her boys just laughing underneath the anointing something came back to her if there's anything that's important to me the most important thing that I can request at a moment like this is the salvation of my two boys hey man what is it she wanted double-double oh brother you can have it in the name of the Lord the salvation - right there on the spot them two boys received who service in serum it they are admitted and who 7 sins you retain they are retained Co sister got upset when brother Branham shared that testimony and he said he said he told it and hug she say oh so you think you got now ma'am I'm just sharing the testimony we're half old you thank you God now you know and I think it was something about here told somebody senseless forgiving or something like that do you think you got you can do this oh no no no but I do know this that the Bible say who service sins I remain there a minute and whoever sins I retained they retain now you gonna figure out what that means but Jesus said it glory to God glory to God I'm so glad we've got a message that makes the word live hallelujah amen I want to just maybe skip here and to just another woman God brought a comfort God brought her comfort this this woman we find her and and and as I I read to you Isaiah 66 13 but what I didn't tell you is that that scripture is connected a man to second Corinthians chapter 1 verse 3 and 4 and let's read that because a few weeks ago we heard a message from that scripture God just brings angles on his word I'm gonna tell you that God God uses angles and here in 2nd Corinthians 1 verse 3 and 4 blessed be God even the father of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of mercies and the God of all comfort who comforts us in all our tribulation that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are confident of God and what we heard a few weeks ago by our precious precious brother Troy is that this message that God has given us has brought us comfort even in the midst of a pandemic we got a comfort Amen we and that when we read scriptures about it it shall not come now well if everybody want to clean that but know that that that's what people that's dwelling in the secret place of the Most High right so when we know where we're dwelling we know we got a a a a we got the reveal word for our day then we can comfort people with that hey man we're comfort about a word of God we're confident by what God says this bird here is a woman that I want to just read about here in Scripture now let me just tell you a little bit about her before we read about her brother Branham said in one place he says she must have been an honorable woman I won't I won't read the full quote I'm just gonna read part that says she must be an honorable woman she must have been the type of woman that Elijah was a man I loved the way he put this he says she must have been a been the type of woman that Elijah was a man because he said the reason he said is because God wouldn't send his prophet to this woman's house if she was a dishonourable woman so she might not have been a prophetess but the life that she live the same way Elijah lived a life that was close to God this woman lived a life that was close to God that that their spirits could connect hallelujah she was a spirit too warming she was a woman going through and suffering on behalf of others here she is in a situation where the entire city is in a drought that the country is in a drought you understand we're all suffering we're all suffering from the pandemic go really God but here you know this woman you know what's going through this chick out she sees a widowed woman she has one boy and she gets to a point where she has her last and say brother branham say there was many days that she would just try to put that baby to sleep even though she knew that he was in having hunger pangs and like this boy says you know I know what the boy going through it said maybe sometimes she'd get up and look in the mirror and see how her face was all drawn up she looked she looked different when she had food but now she say I'm looking at myself and and I might not be as pretty as I used to be but you know what I'm not thinking about me I'm thinking about my boy and I don't ever let that boy cry cry stuff to sleep many a nights in and say maybe one morning the Borgata said mama could you guess just go check one more time to see just a little bit more foursome and and here here mama mama mama said son I'm up to this night you know we got have to just save what we got for for one more day so if you don't mind son I'm gonna just give you a little water I'm gonna pat you on the back end and rub I'm a kitchen come on just try to put you to sleep i'ma saying you some some some some some good songs or some just encourage you to try to sell your spirit maybe get his attention off we ain't got no food hallelujah somebody they made it here here here he's going through this I mean she's going through this night after night and finally she realized now I can't stop feeding this boy I'm gonna have to give him some say you know I'm coming down to my last and brother branham said it like this she says my he says a woman and that crucial hour coming no doubt I mean I read this from Freddie this is in be starting of God paragraph he 19 a man he night II - 19 be certain God he says a woman asked as she seemed that crucial hour coming no doubt she checked up I like that word right there that's what I want to retain no doubt she checked up because there's times in in Mama's life when she going through with her children that mama has to check up hallelujah glory to God said no doubt she checked up and said Lord I've done all that I know how to do when you have it a prayer like that then you run checked up with Tom dissing God I did god I told him listen God I told him that god I took him to church [Applause] please Collin says when you plan everything that you know how to omit every requirement that God has required that's where faith takes hold cuz she came to know more you don't get all the talking you don't need all the pacing at night Reed's got chewed on had your sleepless night but today God wants to bring you glory to God you can go to sleep because God is bringing you comfort I'm gonna stay right there says that's where faith takes home that's where faith comes in if you've met every requirement that God required you to do then sometimes God tests your faith to see what requirement that God requires you to do sets up then sometimes God tests your faith to see what kind of reaction you have on your action there's paragraph 819 since God God will test your faith to see what kind of reaction you have on your action God want to see what your reaction gonna be even now like like I told you you know when had Iraq was there in the parental reaction was that nothing about the truth hallelujah don't allow the devil to get you so wrapped up in your problem in your feelings that you miss your promise let me say it again don't allow the devil to get you so wrapped up in your feelings that you miss your promise hallelujah alright when you come to church put all that to the side you don't know what God I speak to you and all it takes is one word to turn your situation around glory to God says it says God tests your faith to see what kind of reaction you have on your action oh he's good at that it just it just proves whether you really believe what you think you believe see the test is there to really prove whether you believe what you think you believe I know you've been saying you believe it but let the tests come and it's gonna show what you really believe your actions doing the tests tell us what's really there the Hebrew boys their actions during the test look here's what we could say man we see you eating that fire up seven times Harlan our God can deliver we didn't read about it we don't heard about it he can deliver now but if he choose not to deliver I want y'all to write in this book that they did not bow now take us home down to the fire all three I'm went on down see their actions at a time of the test show what was what was really in them and your actions during the midst of the test shows what's really inside of you hallelujah I mean I don't have time to read it all but brother Brandon made a statement in this message you can go back and listen to it be certain of God he says you know what we need to learn how to do is be steal they say that that's what we need to learn how to do it just just be steal don't get all worked up say when actually he said the walls of Jericho did not come down and today got steel he said not when it was marching that's not when the walls came down it's actually when they stop marching oh y'all didn't get that it wasn't when they were marching that the walls came down it's when they stop marching that the walls came down so when you stop worrying when you stop marching when you stop crying when you stop whining when you stop complaining your walls will come down we gotta learn the peace deal here the Prophet tells us about this lady and and the beautiful thing is is that he he was saying in the same message be stricken God is saying that you know she was going out she said I can't keep this boy hungry like this the more I didn't put him off for a good while but I'm out to get his boy this last cake say we gotta eat this we don't die say I'm gonna go outside I'm gonna get myself two sticks and I'm gonna bring these sticks and I'ma make this fire i'ma bake this cake I got a little bit more water left we gonna die now it was already other folk dying all around them right other folk that was a man if I can just use this way they were they were impacted by the pandemic the drought but here this woman just want to say you know say I'm gonna do all this but imma you know what I I got some distress in my life I'm going through this drought I needed alleviate it and all the way I couldn't get comfort is I got to do what God God asks of me and she she had a faith she believed God so here she goes out brother branham said God was working on both ends cuz he told a prophet by a vision and when his water was no longer flowing through the brook he said I commanded a widow woman to sustain you for the next feast for in the next season your life now brother Branham said God showed the Prophet a vision and he showed the Prophet that this woman would have two sticks in my hand so if he went to her house and the lady picked up three or four sticks that's not the woman this woman got to have two sticks and God is working on both in so when it gets down and he sees the lady are going around the yard with two sticks now say brother Branham God God I brother Branham say that God even showed the Prophet how you know she was she really won't don't have much but yet even in this state I commanded her to sustain you and when you get that you're gonna realize she got that much she gonna tell you this but I still commanded her to sustain you why can the Bible say I commanded her because this woman was worrying waiting on one thing hallelujah the one this one was waiting on the one word that she needed to hear that would change the situation was thus saith the Lord that says the Lord changed anything praise cops amen I think even we desire to hear thus saith the Lord look don't play with me don't play with me we say God say it because you don't realize what that means to me you understand don't don't play my faith actually goes to a nother level when somebody tells me the Lord said oh that's a for look when you give me that I forgot about all my problem and so that they don't come to pass and all the faith that I put into it man I got a problem that say the Lord means everything to me the Lord let everything to this woman it changed her whole outlook when she heard us say look when I dad I'm gonna get my lap I'm gonna get these two sticks I'm gonna make this I don't make this cake and that's gonna be it grab the two sticks got this God shoulder prop there she is the woman to one with two sticks there she is probably I'll just say uh excuse me because he brother Bram said he had to get her attention because she was so you know just in her work he had to get her touch excuse me - can I have a drink of water yeah yeah she said I got a little bit left so I'll share with you you know ain't that something that and this is what Mama's good Mama's do it used to be a time they cook a mess of stuff and they share it with the whole neighborhood good mama still do that - my mom has been blessing all y'all with mangoes and mango tree out of story my brother can tell you the story mango tree out of story but y'all y'all y'all benefiting from some pain praise God but uh but but but mama be blessed us with all the mingoes and other day we submit we can't eat all this so we just my wife didn't put a table outside put free mangos anybody come by all the neighbors walking cuz everybody walking nine you know they coming through neighborhood they just grabbing black bags are taking mango take we got some more for you but you know what that might be an opportunity to minister to summarize just through a mango it is one minute was there you know getting get ready to prepare to say I'll fetch you some more I'll go get you some water I'll get it she went running to the house and that's before she'd get out the promised day and oh if you don't mind could you bake me a cake first just just baked me a cake first and and you know and bring it with that water she said no sir see you too across the line here this last cake was for my son and for myself we're gonna eat this and we gonna die he said oh yeah yeah you don't still be able to do that but just bake me one first and I guarantee not now I'm gonna even put I want I don't want to use I guarantee I'm gonna use something stronger than that and thus saith the Lord your crews will not go empty and your barrel will not go dry if you just bake me the cake first she say thus says the Lord no problem winning then bake that cake brought it out to the Prophet gave him the water went back in don't know where it came from but it's a mobile and it was some old meal God comforted her in the midst of a drought God brought comfort to this one and I don't care a man what people are going through today in the midst of all this God will still bring conference there's this little testimony that I want to give to you just let me read this this is a rare very lengthy quote and then I just want to read two other quotes and then I'll bring this to a close I don't I think okay we should be good this is not a message be certain of God and this is a paragraph II - 34 this this this this man got comfort from a visitation from his mama after she had passed away see it's something about when mama tell you something when mama do this but especially if mama's lived a certain life before you you can take confident what she's saying look at what happened here in this story there's some time ago I was over in a little city in Arkansas about 15 years ago not quite that long I'd say 12 years ago they have a terrible segregation in Arkansas in and I've been into a little church and a policeman helped me and an out now praise the Lord brother Ram say they had a terrible segregation in Arkansas say I've been into a little church and the police and helped me in and out and I was coming out of the church and I could hear someone saying mercy mercy I thought where is that coming from and I looked over to my left standing over to one side a Negro man way out from the white people he had his little old cap in his hand hollering mercy mercy and something struck me that wants that that man wants to talk to me and

the Prophet said and some people just only give it to the Prophet see i'ma tell you like this the Bible say the secret things belonging to God but once they are revealed they belong to us and one of the things that God told her prophecy everything that you love and everything they'd ever loved you it'll be waiting for you on the other side see once it was revealed not that belong to us and I remember my brother he told my daddy that my dad was sick and he told my daddy he says daddy remember the Prophet said everything she ever loved and everything that ever loved you you'll see on the other side my daddy kind of shook himself out of his sickness I'm looking for you praise the Lord and I'm gonna tell Mama's shake yourself from whatever it is you're going through this promise is to you and to your children those that affirmed let God bring comfort to you through his word everything that you love look he says this you say mama mother would not be complete there without a family

and dad sat down why that's the happiest time in Mama's life see her kiddies Oh at home says now don't be the missing don't be don't be missing that day let the great chain of your family be hooked together link by link let every spoke be in the wheel and when we sit down with our families and groups across the canopies of eternity what a day that will be they will understand I'm trusting it amen we will have all the links connected I'm trusting that and and I don't I want to just encourage the mothers you'll be confident you'll be comforted God's worried is what's gonna bring you comfort if he knows that the happiest time is when you see all the kids gather together you not gonna have a big table spread for the for the marriage supper of the Lamb and your children miss him just put
