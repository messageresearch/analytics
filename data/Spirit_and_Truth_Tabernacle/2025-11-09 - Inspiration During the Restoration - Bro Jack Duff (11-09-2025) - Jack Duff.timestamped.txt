[30:18] Sister Cobb is is not feeling her best.

[30:33] going to Alabama. Uh, so keep her in
[30:36] prayer that God would just give her uh
[30:39] uh traveling mercies there. And uh I
[30:43] also got a a prayer request from um a
[30:46] couple prayer requests from the
[30:47] Philippines. there is a major typhoon uh
[30:51] that is hitting them and I think um this
[30:53] is like the second one in the last week
[30:56] or something like that. So uh many of
[30:59] the saints have been going through very
[31:01] similar to what we go through with our
[31:02] hurricanes uh over here. So we want to
[31:05] remember the saints over there in the
[31:07] Philippines uh in our in our prayers. I
[31:10] know uh saints in Jamaica just came
[31:13] through a major storm there and um uh
[31:17] one of the brothers had reached out uh
[31:19] and I know that there's been a number of
[31:21] churches that are trying to make a
[31:23] concerted effort to send some funds over
[31:25] to help the saints in uh Jamaica. Uh so
[31:29] we want to do what we can to try to see
[31:31] if we can offer some help as well. Just
[31:34] everybody do a little bit then nobody
[31:36] got to do a lot. Amen. So we we we want

[32:30] sharing a thought with us. Amen. Um, and
[32:34] he said that um, I don't think it was by
[32:37] coincidence, just by I guess God's
[32:39] providence that the sermon that he
[32:42] preached on Wednesday was the same
[32:44] sermon he preached in Puerto Rico when
[32:47] he went uh, with brother Quu. Was it
[32:50] last year? Was that last year? Yeah. uh
[32:54] that they went they went to uh Puerto
[32:56] Rico and and just so happened the pastor

[33:18] just felt really connected uh to this
[33:21] church when I saw the address." And um
[33:26] uh his name is Jose Ovaldo Garcia, J O
[33:31] G. So he saw Jo
[33:35] and he saw his initials all in there,
[33:38] all three initials all in there. So he
[33:40] said he said, "I'm connected to this."
[33:43] Uh, so we thank God. It's so good to
[33:44] have him with us and I wanted him to
[33:46] come and just greet you this morning.
[33:48] Um, you know, but I I know that he'll be
[33:50] here and then they'll be, you know,
[33:51] moving around a little bit, but since we
[33:53] have him here this morning, I just want
[33:54] him to come greet you um, in the name of
[33:57] the Lord. I don't know if he'll need
[33:59] interpreting. I know he can speak
[34:01] English very well, but sometimes you
[34:04] want to uh, you know, say it in your own
[34:06] native language. So, Brother Quick, if
[34:07] you don't mind interpreting for him, uh,
[34:10] that would be greatly appreciated. Let's

[37:03] shared with us, but for his charisma.
[37:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. and above of all his humility.
[37:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; The teaching that brother Mark brought
[37:14] us last year was also a great blessing.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; And to meet brother Quintin, brother
[37:23] Jeffrey and brother Jose Moles and his
[37:26] daughter Linda and Abigail was a great
[37:28] blessing for all of us.
[37:31] &gt;&gt; We had already invited your pastor Jack
[37:34] Dove to visit us in Puerto Rico.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:38] So he and all of you are very welcome
[37:42] &gt;&gt; if the Lord consider to visit us.
[37:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:46] &gt;&gt; By the one I want to share some details
[37:49] of those two visits of the prophet and
[37:52] messenger Brhan to our Iceland. The
[37:56] first one happened in February 1959 and
[37:59] the second one the following year
[38:02] February 1960.
[38:04] The first visit was extraordinary.
[38:07] More than 40,000 people accepted the
[38:10] Lord Jesus.
[38:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:12] &gt;&gt; As the savior.
[38:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:14] &gt;&gt; And there were hundreds of healings to
[38:17] the point that a truck had to be sent to
[38:20] the park with the campaign was held
[38:24] San Jose Park in San Juan Puerto Rico.
[38:28] erh to collect uh many wheelchairs,
[38:31] stretchers, crutches, orthopedic
[38:34] artifacts that the people that got
[38:37] healed before the pray of the prophet.
[38:40] That was the park, San Jose Park.
[38:42] &gt;&gt; All right. [snorts]
[38:47] &gt;&gt; In our congregation, there is still a
[38:50] sisterhood as a child. Her parents took
[38:54] her to the campaign and she testifies
[38:57] that when the prophet came walking from
[39:00] the hotel in front of the area with the
[39:04] campaign was celebrity
[39:06] hotel Normandy.
[39:09] He said that the palms
[39:15] &gt;&gt; the the palm tree
[39:18] &gt;&gt; the palm tree. Yeah.
[39:19] &gt;&gt; The palm tree
[39:23] &gt;&gt; tilted as as he passes making a reverend
[39:26] act. The palm tilt
[39:29] &gt;&gt; the palm trees bowed down as Babra was
[39:32] coming from the hotel uh normally hotel
[39:35] &gt;&gt; making a reverence act to the prophet.
[39:39] The sister
[39:41] uh has a chronic asthma condition
[39:46] and
[39:49] she uh without making a prayer asking
[39:54] she did not make prayer asking
[39:57] &gt;&gt; she didn't make any prayer request.
[39:59] &gt;&gt; Yes. At a certain moment when the
[40:01] prophet was praying for someone, he
[40:04] turned to s to her and said, "You are
[40:06] healed of your condition."
[40:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; The sister was healed. He's never
[40:13] suffered from asthma until today.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; To the glory of God. [applause]
[40:21] &gt;&gt; We also knew the testimony of brother
[40:23] Joseio who who translate the prophet in
[40:27] the preliminary of the service.
[40:30] And he told us that a young man who came
[40:34] from here from the United States to ask
[40:37] for a niece who had an a car accident
[40:40] that week
[40:42] and was very badly injured in the
[40:45] hospital.
[40:47] As soon as the prophet saw him, he
[40:50] discerned his heart
[40:53] and said to him, "Your name is Miguel.
[40:58] Michael in English. All right. when
[41:03] when he
[41:05] hear the prophet said his name his name.
[41:09] When he heard the prophet said this name
[41:12] &gt;&gt; without ever knowing him before,
[41:15] &gt;&gt; he almost fainted there.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; And the prophet say, "Your name is
[41:23] Miguel and you are not from here. You
[41:27] come from outside because of a relative
[41:31] of yours who had an an accident this
[41:34] week and is very serious in the
[41:37] hospital."
[41:42] That was his niece.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; And there, brother and sister, the
[41:49] prophet began to describe how the
[41:52] accident happened.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Wow.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; She said such a car of s of a a brand
[42:02] and such a color
[42:05] collide with this other car of such a
[42:08] brand of such color.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; He described the accident.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[42:15] And then this he said, "The same Holy
[42:18] Spirit who has revealed all of this to
[42:21] me reveals to me that your niece is not
[42:24] going to die."
[42:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; God has healed her.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause]
[42:31] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[42:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:34] At the end of the service, brother
[42:36] Candelario went to that young man to ask
[42:38] him how he felt after the prophet
[42:43] told him about the accident.
[42:46] And you know what he say? He said, "Hey
[42:49] brother, he told me about the accident
[42:52] better than my family told to me."
[42:55] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:58] Beloved brothers, the prophet was
[43:01] invited two times to Puerto Rico by the
[43:05] F
[43:07] full fellowship business Christian
[43:11] &gt;&gt; for gospel businessmen.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[43:15] And originally it wasn't him who was
[43:18] supposed to come to Puerto Rico. It was
[43:22] Morice Cerulo to come to Puerto Rico.
[43:24] And the prophet was assigned to be in
[43:27] Haiti.
[43:29] But God gives gave the prophet the
[43:32] vision that at the last minute they were
[43:36] they were going to change the program
[43:39] &gt;&gt; and Cerulo was sent to Haiti and the
[43:41] prophet to Puerto Rico. Yeah. Amen.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; When the person in charge calls the
[43:47] prophet on the phone to give him the
[43:49] news, before he begins to speak, the
[43:52] prophets tell him, "I am not going to
[43:54] Haiti. I'm going to Puerto Rico."
[43:56] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; Brother Cerulo is going to Haiti.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; The person say, "How you do do you know
[44:01] that?"
[44:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; How do you know?
[44:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[44:08] When the prophet arrived on the Iceland,
[44:10] there was a lady named Sally Olsen
[44:15] who has a shelter of orphan children or
[44:19] abandoned children whose parent were in
[44:22] jail or did not take care of them.
[44:26] That's that's the the woman Sally Olsen.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[44:32] And he went with all of these children
[44:35] to receive the prophet at the airport.
[44:38] And when he got off the of the plane,
[44:40] those children ran to him and began to
[44:43] hug him, to kiss him, and said to him,
[44:46] "Papa, papa." [laughter]
[44:50] &gt;&gt; The prophet was so moved
[44:54] &gt;&gt; by that welcome
[44:56] that he didn't receive in any other
[44:59] place in the world.
[45:02] I have uh the quotation of the message
[45:06] blind Bartos when he explained that he
[45:09] wants to to to preach he want to express
[45:12] the love for the people of Puerto Rico.
[45:15] &gt;&gt; I want to share with us the the
[45:18] quotation blind Bartos was preached in
[45:21] San Juan Puerto Rico on February 8,
[45:24] 1959.
[45:27] He said, "Sally Olen, I have found a
[45:30] place in my heart for her that I didn't
[45:33] know her so well before, but now I see
[45:37] her burden.
[45:39] Yet she is Scandinavian." But she say,
[45:41] "Brother Bran, these people are my
[45:44] people. They love her." No wonder such a
[45:48] lovely person. He little orphanage.
[45:52] Her her little orphanage. I sent those
[45:56] lovely little Puerto Rican children when
[46:00] I come into the airport the other night.
[46:03] No papa, no mama, and they come to me,
[46:08] put their arms around me, kiss me, then
[46:12] that taking a place. I have children
[46:15] too.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; I know what it mean to be loved and to
[46:19] love others. God bless sister Olen.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; Praise God. All of you dear people, I
[46:27] have preached to greater crowds, but I
[46:30] never preached to nicer people.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; If it is be the will of God and your
[46:36] desire, I would like to return sometime.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; Thank you. I will do that. When I feel
[46:44] that welcome, I feel the Holy Spirit
[46:47] will send me.
[46:49] Thank you. That does something to my
[46:52] heart.
[46:54] Now we will go right straight to the
[46:57] scripture. I just hate to start. I have
[47:01] a little weight on my heart tonight for
[47:03] you. I love you in my heart.
[47:08] That sweet humble spirit. I wish that I
[47:12] will speak your language.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; I like just to express to you when I'm
[47:18] singing, but I pray the Holy Spirit will
[47:21] spread in it for me. Amen.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; And I mean that.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:29] &gt;&gt; Brother and sister, as well as the
[47:32] prophet was welcome and well received in
[47:34] Puerto Rico, we will receive all of you
[47:39] &gt;&gt; who can visit us.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; And I will take you to the mountain El
[47:46] Jun.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:49] That aim that my daughter sent was
[47:52] composed by brother Quu
[47:55] and arranged by by a brother in Ghana,
[47:57] brother Emanuel Cran
[48:00] and based on a mountain called Eljun in
[48:04] English. The translation is the anvil.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; Anvil anvil like an anvil.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[48:11] And there were a place that that the
[48:13] prophet was was visit
[48:17] and he said it was the closest thing to
[48:20] the holy city the new Jerusalem.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; So if God will and you visit us, we will
[48:29] take to this place.

[49:46] and um he was actually running some
[49:49] meetings in New York he was a evangel
[49:52] evangelist and had some really really
[49:54] powerful meetings of people getting
[49:56] saved and delivered and um and he had
[49:59] preached a sermon or so uh there in New
[50:03] York on um it was talking about the I
[50:05] believe it was the
[50:08] four horse riders. He was talking about
[50:10] the four horse riders and and he was
[50:13] preaching people responding to the word
[50:15] but uh one of the brothers that was
[50:17] there he says you know I'm glad to see
[50:19] all the people responding to the word
[50:21] and you know this is great he says but
[50:23] what you preach was incorrect
[50:26] and uh he says I believe it the way that
[50:28] brother Brandham believed it preached it
[50:32] and he say okay well what did brother
[50:34] Brandham say he says well you know I
[50:36] have to get you connected with a
[50:38] minister here that can kind of go a
[50:39] little deeper with you and that he got
[50:41] them connected with brother Coleman and
[50:44] uh and and back though back in those
[50:46] days uh like we we have the message on
[50:49] our iPad and on our telephone and and
[50:52] before this we had tapes uh cassette
[50:55] tapes but before the cassette tapes they
[50:57] had what they call real tore. So,
[51:00] Brother Coleman had got some realtore
[51:02] real uh tapes of the seven seals and he
[51:04] had just got them. And the man told
[51:06] brother Candle, he says, "Look, um I
[51:09] know he ain't going to let you hold his
[51:11] real tapes." Uh he said he just got
[51:14] them. I I know you want to hear these
[51:15] things, but he ain't going to let you
[51:16] hold them. Well, they went they
[51:18] explained to Brother Coleman what was
[51:20] going on and you know about the meeting
[51:21] and all of that and his desire to want
[51:23] to know the truth. And um and Brother
[51:26] Coleman said, "I'll let you borrow it."
[51:28] and he say the man got a hold of them
[51:30] reals and would not go to sleep that
[51:32] night till he heard all of them
[51:36] &gt;&gt; and uh and it just began to transform
[51:38] things. So, brother Candelario
[51:40] um eventually became the gentleman uh
[51:45] that God used to spread the message
[51:48] throughout Puerto Rico and then also uh
[51:52] into Latin America, right? Uh but all of
[51:55] that started from his connection uh with
[51:58] with brother Coleman, you know. So we
[52:00] had some really good fellowship, you
[52:02] know, I was able to just kind of uh uh
[52:05] share with him and and what what I was
[52:06] telling um you know, uh brother Jose is
[52:09] that um you know, you it's sometimes
[52:12] it's it's so hard to find people that
[52:14] are balanced and that's that's what you
[52:16] look for in this message because we done
[52:18] ran into a lot of things and now we're
[52:21] looking for balance. Amen. So, it's so
[52:24] good to have him with us in fellowship.
[52:25] And praise the Lord. [applause]
[52:30] On on his phone, he has pictures of uh
[52:32] of sister Ma after brother Prum passed.
[52:35] She went to Puerto Rico uh because
[52:38] brother Brandham talks so much about
[52:40] Elun
[52:42] personally to her. This mountain that
[52:44] look he says this is what uh the the new
[52:47] Jerusalem will look like. Elun, right?
[52:51] So, uh, Sister Ma went there to go take
[52:54] a look at that mountain and brother
[52:55] Billy Paul went to go look at that
[52:57] mountain and and many of them because
[52:59] brother Brandon had talked so much about
[53:00] it. So, you know, it's pretty close to
[53:03] us, only a couple hours flight, so we
[53:06] might have to go visit Elun.
[53:09] Amen. Amen. God bless you, brother Jose.
[53:11] We appreciate you. [applause]
[53:14] Amen. Amen. All right. Uh I I saw um uh
[53:20] brother Robert Fulfurfort. Amen. Uh this

[53:28] grandfather's brother, right? So to make
[53:31] him grand uncle. Yeah. Something like
[53:34] that. Um it kept we we were at the
[53:36] funeral yesterday and I want to thank
[53:38] Spirit and Truth Tabernacle for all you
[53:40] did to support uh the Anderson Fulfoot
[53:43] family in their time of loss. continue
[53:45] to keep them in your prayers. Uh but I
[53:48] as I looked around the the sanctuary
[53:50] yesterday and looked all the Spirit and
[53:52] Truth tabernacle faces, I was like,
[53:53] "Amen. Amen. Amen." Uh just appreciate

[54:23] have you with us. God God bless you. God
[54:28] bless you. Amen. So we thank God for
[54:30] them. And uh with our constraint for
[54:33] time this morning I got to go right into
[54:35] the word. I have a a thought that I want
[54:37] to present and I've been um
[54:41] uh telling y'all about this for a little
[54:43] bit and I I have a feeling I will not
[54:45] get through the whole thing today, but
[54:47] uh but we'll get started. Amen. With
[54:50] this and I know that um there are there
[54:53] are some things coming up on our
[54:54] schedule that will kind of delay me from
[54:56] getting back to it, but nonetheless uh
[55:00] we'll we'll go with what we got. So, if
[55:01] you don't mind standing to your feet,
[55:03] we'll read the scripture. uh briefly
[55:06] here uh we will turn to a familiar
[55:09] passage out of Jeremiah chapter 29.
[55:12] Amen. Jeremiah chapter 29. Amen. And um
[55:19] I am one that you have to follow me.
[55:24] Amen. Because uh I I'm not going to be
[55:27] saying what everybody else is typically
[55:30] saying. I'm going be saying something a
[55:33] little different because I think it's
[55:35] needful and necessary. But this
[55:37] scripture is a very familiar passage to
[55:39] most Christians. Amen. Let's start at
[55:42] verse 11 uh in Jeremiah 29.
[55:48] Amen.
[55:49] The Bible says, "For I know the thoughts
[55:53] that I think toward you,
[55:56] sayeth the Lord, thoughts of peace and
[55:59] not of evil, to give you an expected
[56:03] end. Then shall you call upon me, and ye
[56:06] shall go and pray unto me, and I will
[56:10] hearken unto you, and ye shall seek me
[56:13] and find me, when ye shall search for me
[56:16] with all your heart. And verse 14 says,
[56:19] "And I will be found of you, sayeth the
[56:22] Lord, and I will turn away your
[56:25] captivity, and I will gather you from
[56:27] all the nations, uh, and from all the
[56:31] places where I have driven you, sayeth
[56:32] the Lord, and I will bring you again
[56:35] into the place whence I caused you to be
[56:38] carried away captive." Let's bow in a
[56:41] brief word of prayer. Father, we thank
[56:43] you for the ability to read the
[56:46] scripture. Um we ask oh God that the
[56:49] Holy Ghost would come now and reveal to
[56:52] us uh what is necessary for us at this
[56:56] time. We trust God that you would just
[56:59] minister to each and every heart that is
[57:01] here. Those that will be those that are
[57:03] listening online. We ask that you
[57:05] minister to them that you God would just
[57:07] give them strength. We want to remember
[57:09] um the saints in the Philippines and our
[57:12] prayers that God you would just cover
[57:13] them and and watch over them during this
[57:16] time they're suffering from this typhoon
[57:18] uh saints in Jamaica God that have
[57:21] endured a hurricane and Lord many have
[57:24] lost a lot in in this. So we pray that
[57:26] you would restore uh all that the people
[57:29] have lost. We have some saints that are
[57:30] not feeling well in their bodies. We ask
[57:32] that you would touch remember my
[57:34] mother-in-law God, Sister Cobb this
[57:36] morning. touch her in her body. Remember
[57:38] brother and sister Capers as he uh
[57:40] called me and said sister Capers wasn't
[57:42] feeling her best. So pray that you would
[57:44] touch her, Father, and that you would
[57:46] just bring healing to her body, watch
[57:48] over Sister uh Virginia as she had to
[57:51] travel there to um uh coming from
[57:53] Australia and then going straight to
[57:54] Alabama. God, give her traveling mercy
[57:56] as she goes to and fro. And Lord, just
[57:59] uh pray God that you would just uh meet
[58:01] the needs of your people. Uh we just uh
[58:04] each and everyone that's that's not able
[58:06] to make it this morning, remember them,
[58:07] Father, right where they are. Bring
[58:09] healing to every heart and to everybody.
[58:11] God is our prayer. It's in Jesus name we
[58:14] pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you. You can
[58:17] be seated. Uh I want to uh start amen
[58:23] journey uh with this title uh
[58:27] inspiration
[58:29] during the restoration.
[58:32] Amen. inspiration
[58:34] during the restoration.
[58:37] Amen. And um you know, we we
[58:42] want to just read a a few quotes here uh
[58:46] from God's prophet and um just kind of
[58:50] get us moving in a particular direction.
[58:53] Um this first one is coming out of the
[58:55] sermon possessing the enemy's gates. a
[58:58] sermon that was preached possessing the
[59:00] enemy ga enemy's gates and it says um
[59:04] was only a few years later when the
[59:08] trials come and the church got all shook
[59:12] up as is so easy for a congregation of
[59:17] people to do when something just don't
[59:20] seem to happen the way it's supposed to
[59:24] be. Praise the Lord. Now, now, and and
[59:28] when things don't go the way people
[59:32] think it's supposed to be, then what
[59:35] happens to people is they get all
[59:39] shook up.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; And and there's no need to be shook up.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; If you could just go back in your mind
[59:48] and see what God has already done.
[59:52] If he's already done it, then there's
[59:55] it's it's more than possible that he
[59:58] will do it again because he is the same
[1:00:02] yesterday, today, and forever. Sometimes
[1:00:04] we just need to take a trip down memory
[1:00:06] lane. Remember where God already brought
[1:00:09] you from. Remember the healings that he
[1:00:12] already brought to your body. Amen.
[1:00:14] Those healings were for you to use that
[1:00:16] testimony for this time when you got
[1:00:19] this new trial. Because when you get
[1:00:21] through this trial, there'll be another
[1:00:22] trial. But every trial you ought to use
[1:00:25] as a stepping stone. The victory that
[1:00:27] God gives you in one trial is a stepping
[1:00:30] stone to give you victory in the next
[1:00:32] trial.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; So as believers, we should not all be
[1:00:36] shook up.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; Like we don't know what's happening.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; I think the Bible says, "THINK IT NOT
[1:00:43] STRANGE the fiery trials that come to
[1:00:45] try you."
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; But but it's it's precious gold. My God,
[1:00:50] your trial is like precious gold that
[1:00:53] God has given you.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we got to learn to be grateful
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; for the trial.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; Learn to be thankful
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; for the trial.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; All right. All right. Let me let me keep
[1:01:06] reading here. He says, "Just don't seem
[1:01:08] to happen the way that it's supposed to
[1:01:10] be." And look at look at this statement.
[1:01:12] God makes it that way.
[1:01:16] Look at this other God brings tensions
[1:01:21] into the church.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Boy, I tell you this, this is this is
[1:01:25] rich to me.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; You mean you mean the devil didn't do
[1:01:28] that?
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; NO. GOD brings tensions into the church.
[1:01:35] You know, IT WAS GOD THAT SUGGESTED.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; HE HE SUGGESTED THAT. HAVE YOU
[1:01:42] CONSIDERED
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; MY SERVANT JOB? [screaming]
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; AIN'T NONE LIKE HIM IN THE EARTH?
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; AND AND GOD ALLOWED TENSION TO COME INTO
[1:01:51] JOB'S [screaming] LIFE. BUT THAT TENSION
[1:01:53] ALLOWED JOB, AMEN, TO SAY THINGS THAT
[1:01:56] PROBABLY WOULD NEVER NEVER EVER BEEN
[1:01:58] SAID. HE MY GOD, HE BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT
[1:02:00] A RESURRECTION.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. MY THOUGH HE [screaming]
[1:02:05] SLAY ME
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; THAT THAT WOULD NOT HAVE COME OUT OF JOB
[1:02:09] HAD HE NOT BEEN GOING THROUGH TENSIONS.
[1:02:12] THOUGH HE SLAY ME
[1:02:14] [screaming and cheering]
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; YET WILL I TRUST HIM.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; TENSION BEGINS TO BRING CERTAIN
[1:02:21] [screaming] THINGS OUT OF US. TENSION
[1:02:23] BRINGS SONGS. TENSION BRINGS SERMONS.
[1:02:27] TENSION BRINGS REVIVAL. [screaming]
[1:02:29] TENSION BRINGS STUFF.
[1:02:32] WE WOULD HAVE NEVER KNOWN GOD AS A
[1:02:34] HEALER HAD WE NOT HAD TENSION.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; COME ON. WHEN YOUR FINANCES GET TIGHT,
[1:02:41] [screaming] YOU WOULD HAVE NEVER KNOWN
[1:02:42] HIM AS A WAY MAKER HAD YOU NOT HAD
[1:02:44] TENSION.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; WE THANK [screaming] GOD
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; FOR TENSION.
[1:03:00] God makes it that way.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; God
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; brings tensions into the church.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; For every son that COMETH TO GOD MUST be
[1:03:12] tried
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; and proven
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; and tested. He lets
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; sickness strike you.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; Now, now, now, and when I I love it when
[1:03:25] it when when you know it's it's just
[1:03:27] stated he let sickness because when
[1:03:30] again when you think about Job's
[1:03:32] situation, you know, nothing could have
[1:03:35] happened to Job until God actually gave
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; God had to give permission. And and the
[1:03:46] reason God gave permission because he
[1:03:48] needed to prove to the devil
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; this guy ain't like the rest of them.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Say say I guarantee I guarantee I
[1:03:58] guarantee you let me do this, you let me
[1:04:00] do that, this man will stop serving you.
[1:04:02] I guarantee God say uhuh. Watch it. You
[1:04:05] can take you can take his money.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; You can take his children.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; You can take his business.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; I mean you can take all kind of stuff.
[1:04:14] But this man right here will not stop
[1:04:16] serving me.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Oh my. We got some modern day jobs in
[1:04:21] our midst.
[1:04:23] [applause and cheering]
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; People that NO MATTER WHAT THE DEVIL HAS
[1:04:25] DONE, [screaming] YOU STILL FIND THEM IN
[1:04:28] CHURCH.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; THEY STILL GOT A HALLELUJAH [screaming]
[1:04:32] ON THE INSIDE.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; MODERN DAY JOBS.
[1:04:41] I I'm I'm I'm I I know I ain't going to
[1:04:43] get through this. I know it.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; But but my mind goes to another man that
[1:04:48] that that he was a modern day job from
[1:04:51] back in the early uh 1800s. I'm going to
[1:04:54] say in the 1800s. I want to I want to
[1:04:56] say it that way. But this man had gone
[1:04:59] through Amen. um a great uh fire. and
[1:05:03] the fire it burned down his business
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; and uh you know and he suffered from
[1:05:09] this with this fire and then you he said
[1:05:11] mean I just need to kind of get away and
[1:05:13] get a a little vacation so I'm going to
[1:05:15] take my my family you know on vacation
[1:05:18] he says but I got some things going on
[1:05:19] I'm have to I'm going have to put my my
[1:05:21] wife and my kids on the first boat and
[1:05:24] uh and then I'mma catch the second boat
[1:05:26] and I think even before that some kind
[1:05:28] of way he had a son and lost a son you
[1:05:30] know and and as he as he has his girls
[1:05:32] on the boat and his wife on the boat. Uh
[1:05:34] the boat goes down that they're on and
[1:05:36] the only one that's that's living amen
[1:05:39] from this this incident is his wife.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And his wife sends a
[1:05:43] telegram back to Chicago and says, "I
[1:05:46] saved alone. I'm the only one saved out
[1:05:49] of all this. We done lost the business.
[1:05:51] We done lost our son. We done lost our
[1:05:53] kids. And I'm the last one living."
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; And she was there in Europe waiting on
[1:05:57] him to come. So he's on the next ship
[1:05:59] coming across. And as it's coming across
[1:06:01] the sea,
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, they get to the spot where
[1:06:04] that that previous ship that went down.
[1:06:06] They say it was around this area
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; that the ship went down. This man had
[1:06:11] all kind of tension inside of his life.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; And uh and then he said he said he said
[1:06:15] he says uh he said uh he said this was
[1:06:18] the area that it went down. He said,
[1:06:19] "Give me a pen.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; Give me a give me a sheet of paper." And
[1:06:23] rather than the man cry, hallelujah, at
[1:06:26] a moment like that. And it was perfectly
[1:06:28] normal had he begin to shed some tears
[1:06:30] BECAUSE HE HAD LOST so much.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; But rather THAN A MAN CRY, AMEN,
[1:06:35] SOMETHING WAS BIRTHED OUT OF THAT
[1:06:36] TENSION.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; AND IT'S A SONG THAT WE SING, AMEN, IN
[1:06:40] CHURCHES, AMEN, STILL TODAY FROM WHAT
[1:06:42] WAS BORN IN THAT MAN'S TENSION. THEN HE
[1:06:44] SAID, "WHEN peace
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; like a RIVER
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; ATTENDETH MY WAY, [screaming]
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; WHEN SORROWS LIKE SEA BILLOWS ROLL, HE
[1:06:55] SAYS, "WHATEVER MY [screaming] LOT,
[1:06:56] WHATEVER GOD GOT FROM ME, WHATEVER MY
[1:06:59] LOT, THOU HAS TAUGHT ME TO SAY,"
[1:07:03] HE ALREADY [screaming] LEARNED WHAT TO
[1:07:05] SAY IN THE MIDST OF HIS TENSION. HE
[1:07:07] SAID, "IT IS WELL. PRAISE GOD. IT IS
[1:07:12] WELL WITH [screaming] MY SOUL.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; ALL OF THAT IS BIRTH ATTENTION.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Oatio Spafford is his name.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Don't
[1:07:32] don't don't run from tension.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; God get ready to do something.
[1:07:40] He's getting ready to make a way out of
[1:07:42] nowhere.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; He's getting ready to open up doors you
[1:07:45] can't see.
[1:07:47] [applause and cheering]
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; Tension when you lose your job
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; because he got a better job waiting for
[1:07:52] you.
[1:07:54] [applause]
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; Look,
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; and see I I I I I know cuz you know I I
[1:07:59] I had all kind of tension when I was
[1:08:02] working
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; and God knew that I wasn't going to
[1:08:04] quit. them them folk send me through
[1:08:07] write me up for this and write me up for
[1:08:08] THAT. I STILL BE BACK TO WORK. God had
[1:08:11] to make THE PEOPLE JUST FIRE HIM. DON'T
[1:08:13] GIVE HIM NO [laughter] REASON. JUST FIRE
[1:08:15] [screaming] HIM BECAUSE GOD HAS
[1:08:18] SOMETHING GREATER. HAD I BEEN WORKING
[1:08:20] THERE, I wouldn't have been able to go
[1:08:21] to Australia.
[1:08:23] [applause and cheering]
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; HEY, GOD KNOWS HOW TO TURN YOUR
[1:08:27] attention
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; into a testimony.
[1:08:32] [cheering and applause]
[1:08:33] That's right.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; Truth, mother.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; He lets diseases come on you to test you
[1:08:41] and to prove you, to show the world that
[1:08:43] you're truly the seed of Abraham.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; He permits it
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; by his own will. Look at this. He
[1:08:51] permits disasters.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; He permits the friends to turn AGAINST
[1:08:55] YOU.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; HE PERMITS ALL THESE things and turns
[1:08:59] the devil loose to tempt you. and he'll
[1:09:00] do all but take your life.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; He could throw YOU ON A BED OF
[1:09:07] AFFLICTION.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; HE COULD TURN YOUR NEIGHBORS AGAINST
[1:09:10] YOU. HE COULD TURN THE CHURCH AGAINST
[1:09:12] YOU. HE CAN DO ALL DO ANYTHING. AND IT'S
[1:09:16] GOD'S WILL FOR HIM TO DO IT. WE ARE
[1:09:18] TAUGHT THAT is more precious
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; than gold
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; to us.
[1:09:27] Your trial is more precious
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; than gold.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; Let me read another one out of the
[1:09:35] United Time and sign. This sermon also
[1:09:38] deals with this this thought on tension
[1:09:41] and says just think
[1:09:43] just think of feelings.
[1:09:47] What if you didn't have any feeling?
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; It says no pains or nothing. says, "What
[1:09:54] what what if there'd be no pain at all?
[1:09:57] You'd have no feelings at all." See, and
[1:09:59] if you had no feelings, then one of your
[1:10:02] s then one of your senses would be gone.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; So, see everything just right anyhow.
[1:10:08] God so God just give us grace to stand
[1:10:11] up to it.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; That's the thing. If I just stand up
[1:10:14] with that grace and stand there and say,
[1:10:17] "We know that when it when this life is
[1:10:20] over, the great one's on the other side
[1:10:23] where we're looking to go to." And
[1:10:25] remember that all these things that's
[1:10:27] attention, right? you know, and you
[1:10:29] know, I'm reminded of the the sister
[1:10:31] that was on the on the ship and they had
[1:10:34] told her, they says, you know, uh, y'all
[1:10:37] better y'all better start praying
[1:10:39] because um, this ship about to go down.
[1:10:43] And, uh, they say they said, "We don't,
[1:10:44] you know, we don't know what's going to
[1:10:46] happen here. Uh, either we going to make
[1:10:48] it to port in in a in a in a couple
[1:10:50] hours or we going to go down right
[1:10:52] here." So, y'all better start praying
[1:10:54] right now. So, the lady, she didn't
[1:10:56] start praying. The lady said,
[1:10:58] "Hallelujah."
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; They said, they say, "Sister, you better
[1:11:02] start praying. You You praising." No,
[1:11:05] it's time to pray.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; The lady said, "Hallelujah."
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; And uh they said this, "Ma'am, what is
[1:11:13] the matter with you?" She said, "Well,
[1:11:15] here's what I was thinking."
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; She says, "Uh, if the ship makes it,
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; I got a daughter in New York waiting on
[1:11:24] me and I get a chance to see her. But if
[1:11:27] the ship don't make it,
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; I got a daughter in glory
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; waiting on me.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; So no matter what the situation, I'm in
[1:11:36] a win.
[1:11:39] [cheering]
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; I got one waiting ON ME IN BOTH PLACES.
[1:11:43] SO HALLELUJAH.
[1:11:45] ANYHOW,
[1:11:47] [cheering]
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; you got sometime you got to just make
[1:11:53] the devil mad.
[1:11:56] You you you got you got to show him
[1:11:58] whose side you on.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; And that ain't nothing he can bring in
[1:12:01] your life that won't give God glory.
[1:12:06] [cheering]
[1:12:08] [applause]
[1:12:11] [cheering]
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't want me to testify about
[1:12:15] it, you better not bring it my way.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:12:23] It says uh sometimes people tries to
[1:12:27] introduce Christianity
[1:12:30] that you're free from worry. You're not.
[1:12:35] You're free from tension.
[1:12:37] Oh, no. You add tension when you become
[1:12:40] a Christian. [laughter]
[1:12:43] No, you add tension, right? And and and
[1:12:45] you know, and and and I I I I I like to
[1:12:48] say it like this. Whether you're a
[1:12:50] Christian or not a Christian, you still
[1:12:52] got something you're going through,
[1:12:54] right?
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; People that don't don't follow Jesus,
[1:12:58] they got stuff they go through. They get
[1:12:59] sick, too.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; Right. They get sick, but they ain't got
[1:13:03] no promise to get well,
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; they have financial problems, too.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; But they ain't got no promise of nobody
[1:13:10] rebukeing, no devour for their sake.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; They ain't GOT NONE OF THAT. BUT AS A
[1:13:15] CHRISTIAN, WE might have those, BUT WE
[1:13:16] GOT PROMISES THAT WE CAN HOLD GOD to
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; and watch him prove himself in the midst
[1:13:23] of our tension.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; You add tension when you become a
[1:13:28] Christian because you kind of are you
[1:13:31] kind of a a slop goappy golucky whatever
[1:13:34] it was out there not caring what you
[1:13:37] did.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; Tension bring you to church.
[1:13:45] Tension make you get on the prayer line
[1:13:47] with the sisters. [cheering]
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Tension make you get on the prayer line
[1:13:51] with the brothers. Tension do those
[1:13:53] things cuz without it you just happy
[1:13:55] golucky.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; You at the um thrift store.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; You out shopping somewhere while the
[1:14:04] saints are praying. But let God put a
[1:14:06] little tension in life. Saints, I just
[1:14:08] wanted to get on and tell y'all would
[1:14:09] y'all please pray with me and pray for
[1:14:12] me.
[1:14:14] Now, I'm going to tell y'all something.
[1:14:15] When you going through something, just
[1:14:17] don't have folk praying for you. You
[1:14:19] need to be praying with people.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; Don't jump on the line say, "I ain't
[1:14:23] praying, but y'all pray for me." NO. YOU
[1:14:26] THE ONE BROUGHT THE REQUEST. YOU OUGHT
[1:14:27] TO BE PRAYING, TOO.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Now, I ain't strong enough
[1:14:34] to pray. Yes, you are.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; You can You can You can Lord, I thank
[1:14:39] you for the trial. I know you're going
[1:14:40] to bring me through. You can say
[1:14:42] something
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; all right. Now
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; tension to do these things to you cuz
[1:14:50] you're too happy golucky.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; He says but when you become a real
[1:14:56] Christian every moment you're wondering
[1:14:58] am I pleasing my Lord?
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; If I could hear from him it puts it puts
[1:15:02] you on tension puts you on guard. That's
[1:15:05] what makes you what you are. So, so
[1:15:06] after all, tension is a blessing.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; It's just the way you're looking at it.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; It's just the way you're looking at it.
[1:15:21] See, if you just look the other side, no
[1:15:24] matter how thin you slice anything, you
[1:15:26] still got two sides to it.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; So, see, you want to see both sides.
[1:15:32] So any anytime you're going through a
[1:15:34] trial, make sure you're looking at both
[1:15:35] sides
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; cuz sometime the devil only show you one
[1:15:38] side of the trial. Look at both sides.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. So tension
[1:15:44] I think, oh my, what's tension? He says,
[1:15:46] if I could have been born without this
[1:15:48] tension, well, if I wouldn't have had
[1:15:50] this tension, see that's the way we
[1:15:52] think. I wouldn't have been what I am. I
[1:15:54] wouldn't have been a Christian. Perhaps
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; it was this tension that drove me to
[1:16:00] Jesus Christ.
[1:16:02] See, it's been a blessing thing to me.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Tension brought you to Jesus.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; And t tension to keep you at his feet.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; Thank God for tension.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; Jeremiah 29:11
[1:16:19] told us,
[1:16:20] "For I know
[1:16:25] the thoughts that I think toward you
[1:16:28] that's in the midst of your tension. I
[1:16:30] know the thoughts that I think toward
[1:16:32] you, saith the Lord. Thoughts of peace
[1:16:37] and not of evil to give you an expected
[1:16:40] end. God got a God got something that he
[1:16:42] want to do through the midst of all of
[1:16:44] this. And uh and and he has an expected
[1:16:47] end that he wants to bring you to. Now,
[1:16:49] now now I'm going to uh I told you I'm
[1:16:52] I'm I'm going to kind of start in one
[1:16:54] direction. And this just to try to
[1:16:56] encourage you, right?
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I I just want to encourage
[1:16:59] you uh because this scripture in
[1:17:01] Jeremiah 29:11,
[1:17:04] amen, is a uh a scripture that so many
[1:17:07] people turn to when they have tension in
[1:17:10] their life. This is a a scripture that
[1:17:12] gives them strength and encouragement to
[1:17:15] know that God got a greater plan. I
[1:17:17] believe I believe Paul even said, "And
[1:17:19] we know that all things work together
[1:17:23] for the good to them that love God, to
[1:17:26] them who are the called according to his
[1:17:29] purpose." Right? So, so we go to
[1:17:31] scriptures like this as believers when
[1:17:33] we're going through tensions.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; And and I want to before I go too too
[1:17:38] far in, Amen. this Jeremiah, the script
[1:17:40] in Jeremiah. Let me just, you know, just
[1:17:43] kind of give you some encouragement
[1:17:44] because, you know, it can be used in
[1:17:46] this matter. But there is a greater
[1:17:48] meaning to that scripture
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; and we going to we're going to get to
[1:17:52] the greater meaning. But let me just
[1:17:53] kind of pause for a second and at least
[1:17:55] give you something that'll uplift your
[1:17:57] inner man.
[1:17:59] Now, now when I when I when I I looked
[1:18:01] at this scripture, I conducted a Google
[1:18:03] search on a devotion on Jeremiah 29:11
[1:18:07] and it returned with an AI summary of
[1:18:10] the following. So, this AI summary is
[1:18:11] taking just uh uh thoughts from
[1:18:13] different devotions all over the all
[1:18:15] over the web and it's just kind of
[1:18:16] compiling them and giving it back to
[1:18:18] you. Right? So, the AI summary, Amen.
[1:18:21] When you look at Jeran 29:11, you can
[1:18:23] just leave it on the screen there for a
[1:18:24] second. uh when you look at this for I
[1:18:26] know the thoughts that I think towards
[1:18:27] you sayith the Lord thoughts of peace
[1:18:29] and not of evil to give you an expected
[1:18:32] end. Uh one of the one of the the the
[1:18:34] the say the key themes for the for this
[1:18:38] devotion is you got to be able to trust
[1:18:40] God's timing.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; This is what AI said about it.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; AI said you got to be able to trust
[1:18:47] God's time. Now, hey, I gotta tell you
[1:18:49] to do that.
[1:18:51] [laughter]
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; TRUST GOD'S TIMING. AND IT SAY GOD'S
[1:18:57] plans are not always immediate or what
[1:19:00] you expect.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; The verse reminds you TO TRUST HIS
[1:19:04] TIMING AS he is working in the
[1:19:06] background when you are in a difficult
[1:19:09] or exile season of life.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; THAT MEAN GOD IS ALWAYS WORKING in the
[1:19:13] background. Even when I can't see it,
[1:19:15] you're working. Even when I can't feel
[1:19:18] it, you're working. YOU NEVER STOP. YOU
[1:19:21] NEVER STOP WORKING.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; WE SING IT, BUT WE GOT TO BELIEVE IT.
[1:19:28] [applause and cheering]
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; SO JEREMIAH 29:11 TELLS YOU TO BE ABLE
[1:19:32] TO TRUST GOD'S TIMING.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; ANOTHER thing that IT SAYS IS THAT YOU
[1:19:36] HAVE TO ENDURE THROUGH SUFFERING.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. YEAH.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; You know, we we as Christians, we think
[1:19:43] we're not going to have no trials,
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; no suffering. Jesus had to go to a cross
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; and we got to take up take up our cross
[1:19:52] AND FOLLOW HIM. RIGHT. SO SO, SO WE GOT
[1:19:54] TO BE WILLING TO ENDURE THROUGH
[1:19:56] SUFFERING.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; Not not not just to the trial, but
[1:20:02] through the trial. Amen.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; They said the original context of the
[1:20:07] verse was to people in exile. A
[1:20:10] devotional can help you see that God's
[1:20:13] promise is to provide the strength to
[1:20:15] endure hardship, not to immediately
[1:20:18] remove it. He is present with you
[1:20:20] through your suffering and his ultimate
[1:20:23] purpose is to bring you peace and a
[1:20:26] future of hope.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; Here's another thing that they say. when
[1:20:32] you're in a trial, you're going through
[1:20:33] tension and and AI summary says you got
[1:20:37] to be able to surrender control.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Now, that's that's that's what we need.
[1:20:42] You see, cuz see what happens now. You
[1:20:44] done run out of control.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; It's out of your hands now.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; And you know what? God been trying to
[1:20:49] get it there for a long time,
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; but you done did this and you done did
[1:20:54] that and I done did this and I done did
[1:20:55] that. Now, when it's out of your hands,
[1:20:57] whose hands you going to put it in?
[1:21:01] They say you got to be able to surrender
[1:21:03] control. Trusting God's plan involves
[1:21:08] releasing your own anxieties
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; and the need to understand.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Let me let me say that again. When
[1:21:17] you're surrendering control,
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; trusting God's plan involves releasing
[1:21:22] your own anxieties and the need to
[1:21:25] understand the why behind your
[1:21:27] struggles. Anybody
[1:21:30] know what that why is? Why me?
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; Why this?
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; And then there's another question that
[1:21:36] comes. Why not you?
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Why not this?
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Who are you that you can't have a
[1:21:45] trial?
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; It's just an opportunity. The other side
[1:21:50] of this trial, if you're LOOKING AT BOTH
[1:21:52] SIDES, IT'S an opportunity for God to
[1:21:54] show himself strong on your behalf.
[1:21:56] Amen.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; He going to need a trial to do that.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; Praise God. You know, it's one thing
[1:22:05] when we live off testimonies from years
[1:22:07] gone by, but God wants some fresh
[1:22:09] testimonies today.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; And the only way to have a fresh
[1:22:12] testimony, we got to have a fresh trial.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; Trusting God's plan involves releasing
[1:22:20] your own anxieties and the need to
[1:22:22] understand the why behind your
[1:22:24] struggles. It's about surrendering your
[1:22:26] desires to his perfect will and trusting
[1:22:29] that his plans are greater than your
[1:22:30] own.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; I'm grateful for the encouragement that
[1:22:36] we find in the devotional on Jeremiah 29
[1:22:40] and 11. We can find inspiration
[1:22:44] in this when we're going through the
[1:22:45] trials of life.
[1:22:48] But
[1:22:50] Jeremiah 29
[1:22:54] was actually related to a prophecy
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; and the prophecy was giving regarding
[1:23:00] the restoration of the temple after the
[1:23:04] exile to Babylon. So, a lot of people go
[1:23:08] to Jeremiah 29:11,
[1:23:10] but really we need to start at verse 10.
[1:23:16] And we're going to read to verse 15
[1:23:20] because there are some elements here
[1:23:22] that speak of something much greater
[1:23:24] than just your personal trial.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; Let's read from Amen. verse 10.
[1:23:34] For thus sayeth the Lord,
[1:23:37] that after
[1:23:40] 70 years be accomplished at Babylon, I
[1:23:44] will visit you and perform my good word
[1:23:46] toward you and causing you to return to
[1:23:48] this place. That alone right THERE TELLS
[1:23:51] YOU GOD was speaking of a restoration
[1:23:54] for Israel after they went into
[1:23:57] Babylonian captivity.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name OF THE LORD. GOD
[1:24:02] ALREADY KNEW AND GOD ALREADY PROPHESIED
[1:24:04] THROUGH JEREMIAH THAT I'M GOING TO BRING
[1:24:06] YOU BACK TO THIS SPOT.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO BRING YOU BACK. I'M GOING
[1:24:10] TO BRING YOU BACK FROM BABYLON. I
[1:24:12] SOMEBODY AMEN. THIS MORNING MIGHT BE IN
[1:24:14] BABYLON, [screaming] BUT GOD HAS MADE A
[1:24:16] PROMISE TO BRING YOU BACK OUT OF
[1:24:18] BABYLON. WHAT IS BABYLON? IT'S A PLACE
[1:24:20] OF CONFUSION.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; GOD GONNA SETTLE [screaming] YOUR MIND,
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; GIVE YOU BACK YOUR RIGHT MIND. WHEN THE
[1:24:30] DEVIL TRIED TO TAKE YOUR MIND, CONFUSE
[1:24:32] IT, GOD COME SETTLE THAT.
[1:24:35] [cheering]
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Then he says the next verse, for I know
[1:24:44] the thoughts.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; I know what you're thinking, but I know
[1:24:49] the thoughts.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; I know the thoughts that I think toward
[1:24:53] you. It ain't even about what your
[1:24:55] thoughts are. It's what God thinking
[1:24:57] towards you. And he's thinking these
[1:24:59] thoughts while you ARE IN BABYLON, WHILE
[1:25:02] YOU ARE IN BONDAGE, WHILE YOU ARE IN
[1:25:04] EXILE, GOD IS ALREADY THINKING THOUGHTS
[1:25:07] ABOUT YOUR FREEDOM.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; And whatever he got to do
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; in order to bring freedom to you, he
[1:25:17] will do it.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, we going we going we going we going
[1:25:22] to get into some things here. So, what
[1:25:24] what what was some of God's thoughts?
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; Let's just keep reading. Let's keep
[1:25:28] reading. Let's let let me let me let me
[1:25:30] let let me let me for I know the
[1:25:31] thoughts that I think toward you sayeth
[1:25:33] the Lord. Thoughts of peace,
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; not of evil
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; to give you an expected end. That means
[1:25:42] God already know the end even before the
[1:25:45] beginning.
[1:25:47] Sometimes sometimes, you know, we worry
[1:25:49] about what's going on, but God see point
[1:25:51] A and point B.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; But there's a lot of stuff that happen
[1:25:54] in between before you get before you get
[1:25:57] to point B. Don't worry about all that.
[1:25:59] God saw point B.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; And you going you're going to get to
[1:26:02] point B
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; regardless of what you go through.
[1:26:05] You're going to get to point B.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; To give you an expected end.
[1:26:12] Then shall you call upon me, and ye
[1:26:14] shall go and pray unto me, and I will
[1:26:17] hearken unto you. So the tension caused
[1:26:18] you to want to go and pray a little bit.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; You're going to need to pray now.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; Cuz it's out of your control.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; All right. Amen.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; Don't just send in a prayer request.
[1:26:31] Come pray.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; Come. We need you. I got things I need
[1:26:36] you to pray for me about. You want me to
[1:26:38] pray for you, but I need you to pray for
[1:26:40] me.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Oh Lord, help us, Jesus. No.
[1:26:45] No. You know, y'all know y'all know how
[1:26:47] Christians be. You know, I I'll pray for
[1:26:49] you. And then you forget.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; And you never pray.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; You told her you was going. You told us
[1:26:55] she was going to pray, but you never
[1:26:56] prayed. You got too busy.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; And you forgot. Oh, I forgot. And then
[1:27:00] you just whisper some little prayer when
[1:27:01] you come through the door when you see
[1:27:02] see me. Oh, I forgot to pray for him.
[1:27:04] Lord, bless him. Help them, God. No. No.
[1:27:05] Come on.
[1:27:11] Come on. Let's be Christians.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Let's really be Christians. Let's get
[1:27:15] down to business with God.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; Every other Tuesday night, come to the
[1:27:19] prayer line. It's only twice a month.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Come to the prayer line and release a
[1:27:23] prayer.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Amen, sir.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:28] All right. Let me let me um verse 12.
[1:27:31] All right. Uh then shall you call upon
[1:27:33] me and ye shall go go and pray unto me
[1:27:35] and I will hearken unto you and ye shall
[1:27:37] seek me and find me when you shall
[1:27:40] search for me with all your heart.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; And I will be found of you, sayaeth the
[1:27:49] Lord, and I will turn away your
[1:27:51] captivity. So they were in bondage, but
[1:27:54] now God's getting ready to bring them
[1:27:55] out of bondage. I will turn away your
[1:27:57] captivity and I will gather you from all
[1:28:00] nations and from all the places whether
[1:28:03] I have I have driven you sayeth the Lord
[1:28:05] and I will bring you again into this
[1:28:07] into the place which I called you to be
[1:28:09] carried away captive. So this is a a
[1:28:12] prophecy. Now look at this next verse.
[1:28:15] Because ye have said the Lord hath
[1:28:18] raised us up prophets
[1:28:22] in Babylon.
[1:28:25] Prophets
[1:28:26] in Babylon. Yeah, Daniel
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; was a prophet sir
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; in Babylon. I got some more to tell you
[1:28:35] that were prophets in Babylon that God
[1:28:37] raised up. Zachchariah
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; was a prophet in Ba Babylon.
[1:28:44] Um
[1:28:46] uh let me give you another one here.
[1:28:51] Lord have mercy. We know Jeremiah was a
[1:28:54] prophet in Babylon. Zachchariah Haggi
[1:28:58] was a prophet in Babylon.
[1:29:02] Ezra
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; was a prophet in Babylon.
[1:29:07] You want to know another one?
[1:29:09] Malachi.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; So there's some inspiration that comes
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; during the restoration.
[1:29:24] Amen. Amen.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; Bear with me.
[1:29:36] When we look at this Jeremiah 29, we can
[1:29:39] see restoration is promised.
[1:29:42] We can see God has thoughts of peace and
[1:29:44] not of evil. We can see God has an
[1:29:47] expected end that is promised. And and
[1:29:50] as I was just, you know, meditating on
[1:29:51] these scriptures, I remember brother
[1:29:52] Quinton Jr. making a statement. We have
[1:29:54] been on this journey for the last two
[1:29:56] years uh through the thought of I will
[1:29:59] restore, sayeth the Lord. Amen. And God
[1:30:02] has just uh just done so much. We see
[1:30:05] restoration all around us. This was not
[1:30:08] a uh a uh uh void or a blank or a
[1:30:15] unfruitful inspiration. Let's put it
[1:30:18] that way cuz we see fruit come back from
[1:30:20] the from the inspiration that God gave
[1:30:22] Spirit and Truth Tabernacle out of Joel
[1:30:24] chapter 2. I will restore sayith the
[1:30:26] Lord. And then and then that that
[1:30:29] started two years ago. The inspiration
[1:30:30] started two years ago. And since it
[1:30:32] carried over into this year, it became
[1:30:35] the year of overflow.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; And we had saints in this church
[1:30:40] experience different overflows in their
[1:30:42] life. All the way up to LA Wednesday
[1:30:44] night. Y'all heard a testimony, Brother
[1:30:45] Quinton Senior, talking about an
[1:30:46] overflow,
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; a check that had been held up and they
[1:30:51] did nine years of back pay.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; I'm starting to look at my account, too.
[1:31:03] Like,
[1:31:05] hey, when the angel troubling the water,
[1:31:08] you better jump in.
[1:31:11] Yeah,
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; who owe me some money. [laughter]
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. BUT WE SEE GOD has brought
[1:31:19] fruit from the off the inspiration that
[1:31:22] he's given us.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; And I and I do believe that God's going
[1:31:25] to change us as we go into next year.
[1:31:27] But uh but here I'm I'm kind of bringing
[1:31:30] amen almost like a final thought on this
[1:31:33] whole uh uh uh restoration, the
[1:31:36] inspiration during the restoration.
[1:31:39] And and here, you know, brother Quinton
[1:31:41] Jr. mentioned uh in one of the sermons
[1:31:44] that he preached during this se this
[1:31:45] series, he says uh we can see the theme
[1:31:47] of restoration throughout the
[1:31:50] scriptures.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; And as I'm looking here in the book of
[1:31:53] Jeremiah, restoration pops up again.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; Now, let me just bring a a quote from
[1:31:59] the restoration of the bride tree. As
[1:32:01] God prophet uh mentioned it, he says to
[1:32:04] restore
[1:32:05] means to bring back.
[1:32:08] So now Israel is getting ready to be
[1:32:10] brought back to their homeland. Amen.
[1:32:13] Here in the book of Jeremiah, I mean
[1:32:15] Jeremiah's prophesied that they would go
[1:32:16] away for 70 years, but now they're about
[1:32:18] to be brought back. Amen. And and and
[1:32:21] and in bringing them back, God uses the
[1:32:24] the words of prophets, amen, to
[1:32:27] encourage the people in their return
[1:32:29] back to Jerusalem or back to Judah. God
[1:32:33] uses, Amen, the the the words from a
[1:32:35] prophet to kind of bring the people
[1:32:36] back. God has done the exact same thing
[1:32:39] today because it's not a physical place
[1:32:41] that we're trying to go to, but it is a
[1:32:44] spiritual place that God is trying to
[1:32:46] bring the back bring the people back to.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. The church has lost its way
[1:32:50] spiritually.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, God help us.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, the church has lost ITS
[1:32:56] WAY SPIRIT AND THEY TRYING TO FIND DEEP
[1:32:58] things in the word of God.
[1:33:02] Some of the studying that they they
[1:33:04] doing, they don't really don't don't
[1:33:06] even realize what they tapping into.
[1:33:07] Trying to find something deep.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; IT'S SO DEEP THAT IT'S OFF.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; IT'S SO DEEP THAT IT'S WRONG.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; HELLO, SOMEBODY.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; I ain't never heard these things in my
[1:33:20] life.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; Let me just leave that alone. Let me go
[1:33:24] on. To restore means to bring back
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; or to restore. A claim can be enforced
[1:33:31] not to bring anything back to its
[1:33:33] rightful owner where where it belongs.
[1:33:36] Therefore, some way it went away from
[1:33:38] its rightful owner and can wander around
[1:33:40] anywhere, but to restore is TO BRING IT
[1:33:43] BACK to who really owns it. SEE, ISRAEL
[1:33:46] OWN JERUSALEM and Judah AND ALL THAT.
[1:33:49] GOD WAS GETTING READY TO BRING THEM BACK
[1:33:51] TO WHAT THEY OWN. EVEN THOUGH THEY'VE
[1:33:52] BEEN IN EXILE FOR OVER 70 YEARS, NOW
[1:33:55] IT'S TIME TO COME BACK. OH MY.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; I know some. So, there's a time limit on
[1:34:01] your bondage.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; There's a time limit.
[1:34:08] There's a time limit on your bondage.
[1:34:11] Can I go a little further? There's a
[1:34:12] time limit on your family's bondage.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; There's a time limit. Yes, sir.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; They they they got to come out at some
[1:34:21] point in time.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; I I I saw a young sister yesterday. I I
[1:34:27] say, "I I I miss you, sis. I miss seeing
[1:34:30] you at church. I miss just even if you
[1:34:33] want to go into my church, just seeing
[1:34:34] you in church somewhere. I miss you.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; You got to sew seeds.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; I don't care what is going on in your
[1:34:46] life. that don't that don't don't keep
[1:34:48] in a state of exile. There's a time
[1:34:50] limit, an expiration date for your
[1:34:52] exile.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; I I believe I I believe was written
[1:34:57] there in the Old Testament that God God
[1:34:59] pro God provides a means that his
[1:35:03] banished be not expelled.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; People end up in banishment sometime,
[1:35:11] but they can't be expelled. Y'all going
[1:35:13] to make me go back and preach that
[1:35:15] sermon.
[1:35:21] Let me keep reading.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; He says, um, therefore, some way it went
[1:35:27] away from its rightful owner, can wander
[1:35:29] around anywhere, but to restore is to
[1:35:31] bring back to to it who really owns it
[1:35:33] or to bring it back to its natural
[1:35:35] estate where it was at the first time.
[1:35:38] BRING IT BACK into its natural
[1:35:40] condition. In order to do this, we have
[1:35:42] a right to enforce.
[1:35:44] If there's a law to enforce this
[1:35:47] rightful condition of restoration to
[1:35:48] restore, like if somebody
[1:35:51] stole some property
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; and they're holding the property
[1:35:55] captive,
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; then you can take the law
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; and go to this person and the law
[1:36:01] forces, my God, I like that enforces
[1:36:05] this PERSON TO RESTORE THIS property
[1:36:08] back to its natural owner.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; Somebody steal your telephone. You got
[1:36:14] the brand new iPhone
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; and they done stole it.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; But you catch them
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; now. You ain't got to fight with them.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; Just just just make a telephone call.
[1:36:25] Keep your eye on them.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; Make a telephone call. Get the law
[1:36:29] involved. Say, "Look, I need I'm I'm
[1:36:31] reporting some stolen property. I know
[1:36:33] it's my phone. My name is all in the
[1:36:35] thing
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; and it's and it's locked. They can't get
[1:36:38] in to erase anything. All you do is just
[1:36:41] when you get it to me, let me put my
[1:36:42] code in and you'll see my name and
[1:36:45] you'll know that this belong to me.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; If it's their phone, tell them to put
[1:36:50] the code in.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Ask them to unlock it. Put their thumb
[1:36:55] print on it
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; and unlock it. They say it's theirs. I
[1:36:59] say it's mine.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; Let's see who thumbrint IT MATCHES.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; YOU AIN'T GOT TO FIGHT WITH THEM. You
[1:37:05] just you just get the law involved. And
[1:37:07] the law is THERE TO MAKE SURE YOU GET
[1:37:09] BACK WHAT BELONGS TO YOU. THE HOLY GHOST
[1:37:13] IS HERE TO MAKE SURE YOU GET BACK
[1:37:17] [screaming] EVERYTHING THAT BELONGS TO
[1:37:19] YOU,
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; BROTHER. LIKE IT WAS IN THE DAYS OF
[1:37:22] DAVID. [screaming] I SHALL RECOVER ALL.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I ain't just taking part
[1:37:34] of it back. I want it all back. Amen.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; Here, let's go on. He says like if
[1:37:42] somebody stole some property and they're
[1:37:43] holding the property captive, then you
[1:37:44] can take the law to go to this person.
[1:37:47] The law forces and force this person to
[1:37:48] restore this property back to its
[1:37:50] natural owner, the first estate
[1:37:52] enforcement
[1:37:54] says, "Oh, what a text. I like to have
[1:37:57] two days on that enforce." Now, brother
[1:37:59] Neville never preach for us. Amen. I'm
[1:38:01] just talking to you. teach a Sunday
[1:38:02] school lesson and and it'll get into
[1:38:05] continue on I hope uh I hope with what
[1:38:08] he what he what he had he says enforce
[1:38:11] then we are we have the privilege to
[1:38:13] enforce upon Satan the claims that God
[1:38:17] give us for God has a law and his word
[1:38:22] is a law and God and his word made
[1:38:25] certain claims to his church therefore
[1:38:28] we have a right to force these claims
[1:38:30] upon Satan and say give it back.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; And he has to do it
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; because we can take God's agent,
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit, go right down on our
[1:38:41] knees
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; and say is thus sayeth the Lord.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; Do you realize what we have in this
[1:38:47] season of restoration, we can tell the
[1:38:49] devil, give back health,
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; right? Give back OUR CHILDREN. GIVE BACK
[1:38:55] MY MONEY THAT YOU TOOK FROM ME. GIVE IT
[1:38:58] BACK. [screaming]
[1:39:00] AND IT'S NOT US TO FORCE. IT'S NOT UP TO
[1:39:02] US TO FORCE THE DEVIL. IT'S THE HOLY
[1:39:04] GHOST THAT WILL FORCE the devil do it.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; This whole this whole little thought
[1:39:10] here that Brother Brandham's sharing, it
[1:39:11] comes from a a situation where a man
[1:39:14] lost his car.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; He was at the meeting
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; at the service and in service somebody
[1:39:20] come up on the church property, stole
[1:39:22] the man car off the property.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; He he traveled from I don't know how far
[1:39:27] to get there. And I mean all this
[1:39:28] traveling I get there and somebody steal
[1:39:30] my car. You know that's tension.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; So you know why they why they they they
[1:39:36] they what we going to do? What we going
[1:39:38] to do? They finally got the the prophet
[1:39:40] and say he said you know just pray
[1:39:42] please. And then then he says uh uh the
[1:39:45] scripture was quickened to him. If you
[1:39:48] abide in me and my words abide [snorts]
[1:39:52] in you, then ye shall ask
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; what you will
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; and it'll be done. When that when that
[1:40:00] scripture quickened to him, he prayed
[1:40:02] differently.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; And as he was praying for the man's car,
[1:40:07] a vision came. He say, "I see your car
[1:40:09] coming back." He said it's going to be
[1:40:11] half full when you get it because he
[1:40:13] going to take it somewhere and he got to
[1:40:14] bring it all the way back here and it's
[1:40:16] going to be found in such AND SUCH SPOT
[1:40:17] EXACTLY THE WAY THE VISION SHOWED IT.
[1:40:19] That's the way they found it. And it
[1:40:21] SAID WHAT HE DID WAS JUST PRAY. And when
[1:40:23] he prayed, he released THE AGENT, THE
[1:40:25] HOLY GHOST, TO GO AFTER THAT CAR AND
[1:40:28] BRING IT BACK.
[1:40:31] WE GOT TO RELEASE THE HOLY GHOST TO GO
[1:40:33] AFTER SOME THINGS AND BRING IT BACK.
[1:40:36] AMEN.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; GOD WANTS YOU TO RELEASE HIM TO GO GET
[1:40:39] IT.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; HE WANTS TO GET IT BACK TO YOU.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Let me Amen. Look, look,
[1:40:50] let me let me let me finish this little
[1:40:52] piece here. Uh all right. It says uh
[1:40:56] give it back. It has to do it because we
[1:40:57] can take God's agent, the Holy Spirit,
[1:41:00] go right down on our knees and say it is
[1:41:02] thus says the Lord. He's got to give it
[1:41:04] up. That's all. because the Holy Spirit
[1:41:06] is there to make him do it.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; The law of the land is to enforce. It's
[1:41:11] by the land and it's for the land. But
[1:41:14] the law of the spirit of God is to for
[1:41:18] Satan to give up
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; that which he has unrightfully,
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; deceitfully
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; taken from God.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; SOULS of men,
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; he took from God. souls of women,
[1:41:34] children, sickness of the body, he
[1:41:36] placed upon people where God made them
[1:41:39] in his image TO BE LIKE HIM. And the
[1:41:41] church is given the rightful legal the
[1:41:44] rightful LEGAL RIGHTS BY THE BIBLE to
[1:41:46] take the Holy Spirit and enforce this
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; upon them. Amen.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; Man, I we started out with that quote
[1:41:54] two years ago and and I'm bringing it
[1:41:56] almost at the end again because
[1:41:59] uh you know two years ago I'm I'm
[1:42:02] reading it by faith.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; But today
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; I can tell you that the devil done gave
[1:42:08] it BACK
[1:42:12] [applause]
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; and he ain't just because now remember
[1:42:19] if you catch him stealing According to
[1:42:22] Exodus 20,
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; if you catch your a thief's stealing,
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; boy, that's
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; boy, you that's rough.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; You you I know you stole because you
[1:42:33] needed this.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; Now I don't know what you you're going
[1:42:35] have to give me mine back.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; And I don't know what you got to do to
[1:42:41] go get the other part because according
[1:42:43] to the law,
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; the law says you got to give me double.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; So I'm going to take this plus this.
[1:42:50] Yes.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; And and I hope you don't have to steal
[1:42:52] the second thing from somebody else.
[1:42:55] Because if you do, guess what you got to
[1:42:56] do to them? You're going to have to pay
[1:42:58] them double.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; And we caught the devil stealing
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; souls of men,
[1:43:05] souls of women.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; Got our children wrapped up and tied up
[1:43:09] in all kind of stuff.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; But we had to claim our children.
[1:43:14] And God gave me double
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; cuz the Lord allowed in this season of
[1:43:19] restoration, God allowed me to baptize
[1:43:22] my own son-in-law.
[1:43:24] [cheering]
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; I know I got double for my trouble.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:30] [applause and cheering]
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; And I and God ain't finished yet.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; God ain't in no hurry.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; He knows just when to move. All right.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; All right, give me uh let me give give
[1:43:51] me give me one other thing and I want to
[1:43:53] I want to just shift gears. Like I told
[1:43:55] you, I know I won't get through all of
[1:43:57] this, but I think we'll we'll we'll get
[1:44:00] far enough. Um this is out of United
[1:44:03] Time and Sign. Just one more that I want
[1:44:05] to read and then I want to just give you
[1:44:08] some other uh information. says,
[1:44:10] "Speaking of tension,
[1:44:12] I was praying about it this morning.
[1:44:14] What would you do if you didn't have
[1:44:15] tension?
[1:44:17] Just think of it. Tension is part of
[1:44:20] living."
[1:44:23] [snorts]
[1:44:24] He says, "That kind of encouraged me
[1:44:25] when I thought of that. If you had no
[1:44:27] tension, you'd be like a ragd doll.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; You wouldn't have no feelings.
[1:44:34] There'd be nothing you could work on.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; like a husband and wife maybe if she
[1:44:40] wants to do something as they're trying
[1:44:43] to work together especially Christian
[1:44:44] Christians and the and the other one
[1:44:47] wants and and then when you come
[1:44:49] together to and and find out she's done
[1:44:51] she she finds out see the tension really
[1:44:54] brings you closer together
[1:44:56] [snorts] you know one of the things a
[1:44:58] husband's wife some sometimes go through
[1:44:59] is how money gonna be handled
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; amen wife looking at that extra money
[1:45:06] for This husband thinking car parts and
[1:45:12] and I I need tires,
[1:45:16] need this, I need that.
[1:45:19] Wife saying the kids need clothes.
[1:45:22] They growing out of this and growing out
[1:45:24] of that. And she say I need my hair
[1:45:26] done.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. the husband thinking,
[1:45:33] you know, I one time went to the the the
[1:45:35] store with my wife. She say she was, you
[1:45:38] know, going to get some hair cuz she
[1:45:40] wanted to get her hair done. And I I
[1:45:43] walked that there like I was, "Boss,
[1:45:47] baby, I'll take care of it for you." And
[1:45:50] I uh I got to the register
[1:45:53] and uh the man said something.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; I think it said 80 or something dollars.
[1:46:00] I say for hair.
[1:46:03] Boy, I slip my wallet back in my pocket
[1:46:07] and I ease my way out the store.
[1:46:15] She got it. I know she got
[1:46:18] She wouldn't be in here if she ain't
[1:46:20] have it.
[1:46:23] But you know you you know sometimes in
[1:46:25] in in in in households the the the lady
[1:46:28] thinking about something else and the
[1:46:30] man thinking about something else and it
[1:46:31] bring tension in the household.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; Finances can bring tension.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; Praise God. But you know that tension
[1:46:39] actually bring you closer together.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; Lord let me let me let me let me let me
[1:46:45] let me say this. In every relationship
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; there will be tensions.
[1:46:53] Now sister, be careful. When tension
[1:46:57] come in a relationship, you can't be
[1:46:59] telling all your family
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; about the tension that's in your
[1:47:04] relationship
[1:47:06] and y'all. And then your husband, you
[1:47:08] know, you want him to come to the
[1:47:10] cookout,
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; but when he get to the cookout,
[1:47:14] everybody looking at him funny.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; And the reason they looking at him funny
[1:47:18] because it's something that you said.
[1:47:22] And then y'all go back home and y'all
[1:47:24] get that tension all worked out.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; And now you in love with them all over
[1:47:28] again.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; But you forgot to go back and tell
[1:47:31] people that you was in love with them
[1:47:33] all over again.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; That's why you got to keep that tension
[1:47:40] to yourself.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; All right. Same thing with the with the
[1:47:48] with the with the brothers. Be careful.
[1:47:49] You don't share all your business with
[1:47:51] everybody.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; They don't know how to handle it.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; Your kids don't know how to handle that
[1:47:58] type of information.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; You can't be sharing that with your
[1:48:02] children.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; They ain't even been in no committed
[1:48:05] relationship.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; They don't even know what that what it
[1:48:08] look like to be married and have to deal
[1:48:11] with pressures like brother Smiley was
[1:48:12] talking about last week. It's it's a
[1:48:14] different thing
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; when you underneath the load. when you
[1:48:19] just kind of caring for yourself
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; and your bills and you know you just
[1:48:23] struggle with just you.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; You know what I'm saying? You just be
[1:48:26] struggling with just you. Now when you
[1:48:28] get a wife and kids,
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; brother, we going to see what a man is
[1:48:33] made of
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; and and and and you got to go through
[1:48:37] some things. Oh Lord, help me Jesus. But
[1:48:39] but you got you got you got to be able
[1:48:41] to get underneath that load
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; and and feel that tension. You know what
[1:48:46] it does sometime? It make you go back to
[1:48:48] school
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; because you realize you ain't getting
[1:48:53] enough money in this job.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; And and when you look at how old them
[1:48:57] kids are, like brother Small saying say,
[1:48:59] you go to the store and and I need all
[1:49:01] six of them need shoes
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; and you can forget about it. Jordans is
[1:49:06] out the question.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; Nobody going to get no Jordans around
[1:49:10] here. Bobo,
[1:49:14] [laughter]
[1:49:16] he said, "BUT ONLY THREE GOING TO GET
[1:49:17] IT, RIGHT? I GOT GOT SIX THAT NEED, BUT
[1:49:21] ONLY THREE GOING TO GET IT. AND I'M
[1:49:23] GOING HAVE TO WAIT TILL I CAN GET THE
[1:49:25] NEXT THREE. AND HOPEFULLY THEY THE OTHER
[1:49:27] ONES [screaming] WON'T GROW OUT OF
[1:49:28] THEIRS. CUZ WHEN YOU SEE ALL THIS AND
[1:49:30] HOW FAST THEY GROWING,
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; TENSION, TENSION, TENSION, TENSION,
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; eating up all the groceries.
[1:49:44] You you don't know what tension's like
[1:49:45] until you have to get underneath that
[1:49:47] load
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; and it cause you to go to your knees in
[1:49:49] prayer.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; God, I need I I need cash.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; I need cash.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And then to watch God make a
[1:50:02] way.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; And then you can look back years later
[1:50:05] and see how God brought you through.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He was talking about how, you
[1:50:10] know, and and I showed, boy, I had I had
[1:50:12] credit cards. I had a credit card for
[1:50:14] Sears. I had one for JC Penney. I had
[1:50:18] one for Firestone.
[1:50:20] Anybody that can give me credit, I was
[1:50:23] using them
[1:50:25] because I was under pressure.
[1:50:28] But when I got it paid off, woo Lord, I
[1:50:32] thank God for that.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; I cut them up.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; After they was paid off, they was cut
[1:50:38] up. So, I could not go back to that
[1:50:40] anymore.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; I learned some lessons along the way.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; Oh my
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. All right. I'm coming. I'm
[1:50:50] coming. Uh you be like a ragd doll. You
[1:50:52] wouldn't have no feelings. There'd be
[1:50:54] nothing you could work on. Like a
[1:50:55] husband and wife maybe if she she wants
[1:50:57] to do something and they're trying to
[1:50:59] work together, especially Christians.
[1:51:00] And the other one want other one wants.
[1:51:02] And then when you come together, find
[1:51:04] out what she's done. She finds out. See
[1:51:06] the tension really brings you close
[1:51:08] together, closer together. And somebody
[1:51:11] tells you that well said just think of
[1:51:13] the little wife that went went under a
[1:51:15] lot of tension when you wasn't so good
[1:51:18] or the husband went under some tension
[1:51:20] when you wasn't so good. Then when it's
[1:51:23] all forgiven,
[1:51:26] look how you feel about them. My you
[1:51:29] just
[1:51:30] you got to you got to have tension.
[1:51:32] That's all.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; Just got to have the tension. is is it's
[1:51:35] necessary. All right, give me just a few
[1:51:38] more minutes in my Bible. I got a Bible
[1:51:42] um a Thomas Nelson Bible at home. And
[1:51:45] when we look at the book of Ezra,
[1:51:49] um
[1:51:51] the setting, the historical setting of
[1:51:54] the book of Ezra, it says the setting of
[1:51:55] Ezra is the post exileic era when the
[1:52:00] faithful Israelites return were
[1:52:01] returning from Babylon to Judah. so they
[1:52:05] could reestablish their temple worship.
[1:52:07] So this was all about restoration. The
[1:52:10] temple and the temple worship are vital
[1:52:12] subjects in all the books written during
[1:52:15] the post exilelic period. And some of
[1:52:18] the books that were written during the
[1:52:20] post exile period which means after
[1:52:22] exile after 70 years of exile in Babylon
[1:52:25] now they're coming back into Jerusalem
[1:52:26] or back into Judah. That's the post
[1:52:29] exilelic period. And uh some of the
[1:52:31] books that were written in the post
[1:52:33] exile period were 1 and 2 Coronicles,
[1:52:38] the book of Nehemiah was written during
[1:52:40] that time, the book of Haggi, the book
[1:52:43] of Zachchariah and Malachi. And so it
[1:52:47] says the people who returned to the land
[1:52:49] of promise were publicly acknowledging
[1:52:52] that they believe God would reestablish
[1:52:54] the nation and usher in a time of
[1:52:56] kingdom blessings.
[1:52:59] And uh and and another note here in the
[1:53:01] in the Bible says there were three
[1:53:03] returns from Babylon to the land of
[1:53:06] Israel. One happened in 538 BC. Another
[1:53:10] happened in 458 p BC and the third one
[1:53:14] happened in 444 BC.
[1:53:17] Just as there had been three
[1:53:20] deportations to Babylon. First one
[1:53:23] happened in 605 BC, 597 BC and 586 BC.
[1:53:29] So there was three deportations and then
[1:53:32] three
[1:53:33] returns.
[1:53:35] God know how to do things. The first
[1:53:38] return was led by Zerubbabel.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; All right. [snorts] And in Ezra chapters
[1:53:45] 1-6 we we we read about that. All right.
[1:53:49] And then u uh the first return was was
[1:53:52] led was was was led by Zer Zerubbabel.
[1:53:55] So Esther I'm sorry Ezra chapters 1-6.
[1:53:58] Also you find this in the book of Haggi
[1:54:00] and also in the book of Zechariah where
[1:54:02] they speak about Zerubbabel. All right.
[1:54:05] So he would have come in 538 BC. Uh the
[1:54:08] rebuilding of the temple was vital for
[1:54:11] this group. So we talk about uh
[1:54:14] inspiration during the restoration is
[1:54:15] the restoration of the temple. Okay. So
[1:54:18] there's there's uh the rebuilding of the
[1:54:20] temple was vital to this group. The
[1:54:22] second return was under Ezra and that's
[1:54:25] in Ezra chapter 7 through10. You read
[1:54:27] all about that. Uh and that happened in
[1:54:29] 458 BC. Uh the people needed reforming.
[1:54:33] They needed to return to their covenant
[1:54:35] obligations.
[1:54:37] But the third return was led by Nehemiah
[1:54:40] in 444
[1:54:42] BC. And Nehemiah when he came, we know
[1:54:45] that there was a rebuilding of the walls
[1:54:47] uh during that time. Uh and you know,
[1:54:51] just just some really really you know,
[1:54:52] you go back and you just read some of
[1:54:54] the things there out of Nehemiah. You
[1:54:56] know, we we found a a scripture there a
[1:54:58] few years ago. We preached about how he
[1:55:00] sent unto them saviors.
[1:55:02] He sent saviors. That's written in the
[1:55:05] book of Nehemiah. And like, wait a
[1:55:06] minute, he sent saviors.
[1:55:09] I thought Jesus was the savior. He is
[1:55:13] the ultimate savior. But sometimes he
[1:55:16] uses you
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; to act as a savior for others. Amen.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; He expresses his attribute through you.
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; And I always give the example of when I
[1:55:28] was was drowning in in in in that pool
[1:55:31] and and that young lady happened to be
[1:55:33] coming by at the time that I I fell into
[1:55:35] the pool trying to scoop out a rock.
[1:55:37] Young lady come skating by. She was the
[1:55:39] the lifeguard, but uh she wasn't on duty
[1:55:41] that day. My cousins couldn't swim. Uh
[1:55:44] but here I am drowning. They in the
[1:55:46] shallow end and I'm in the in the deep
[1:55:48] end. I done fell in trying to get a rock
[1:55:49] out the pool. And uh so this girl comes
[1:55:52] skating by and she she saw me go down
[1:55:56] and she she took one skate off, could
[1:55:58] not get the second off in time, jumped
[1:56:01] in the water with a skate on in the deep
[1:56:04] end and she got me out. All I remember
[1:56:07] is when I woke up, I remember falling
[1:56:09] in, but when I woke up, it was people
[1:56:11] surrounded all around. There's fire
[1:56:13] trucks and I was in the lap of a fireman
[1:56:16] and all I looked up and I saw this man
[1:56:18] and I'm like what in the world done
[1:56:20] happened? I was just here with my
[1:56:22] cousins trying to get a rock out of the
[1:56:23] pool. What done? And and I mean in a
[1:56:25] matter of I don't even know how long it
[1:56:27] took for all them people to get there.
[1:56:29] They got me out and I'm in this man's
[1:56:31] lap just looking up at the rest of the
[1:56:33] world like what? And I was a lad.
[1:56:36] God had spared me from death
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; cuz God knew he had a a a greater work.
[1:56:41] I I know the plans I have for you.
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. [applause]
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; God had a greater plan for me. And the
[1:56:49] devil couldn't take me out then and he
[1:56:50] can't take me out now.
[1:56:53] [applause]
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; But, you know, I I I looked at that
[1:56:57] young lady. I I don't know her name. I
[1:57:00] probably would never meet her on
[1:57:01] Facebook, but I believe one day I'll see
[1:57:04] her on the other side
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; because she became a savior to me.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:15] Ezra 5.
[1:57:18] Let's just read this really quick. Ezra
[1:57:21] 5
[1:57:38] here in Ezra 5 verse one says
[1:57:41] then the prophets
[1:57:44] see he raised up prophets
[1:57:47] then the prophets Hagi
[1:57:50] the prophet and Zachchariah the son of
[1:57:54] Idu
[1:57:56] prophesied unto the Jews that were in
[1:57:57] Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the
[1:58:00] Lord in the name of the God of Israel
[1:58:02] even unto them. And look at this. Then
[1:58:05] rose up Zerubbabel
[1:58:08] the son of Shilotil and Jesua the son of
[1:58:12] Joedc and began to build the house of
[1:58:14] God which is at Jerusalem. and with them
[1:58:18] were the prophets of God helping them.
[1:58:21] Now, this is the other thing that I like
[1:58:22] about this. I'm going to read a little
[1:58:24] bit more, but um not only are they
[1:58:26] prophesying,
[1:58:28] but they're involved in the work.
[1:58:33] See, it's one thing to, you know, to
[1:58:35] preach and and and and to do all these
[1:58:37] things, but if if if I'm really if I,
[1:58:39] you know, even if I if I if I if I
[1:58:41] encourage people to give towards
[1:58:43] something, I got to be willing to give,
[1:58:45] too.
[1:58:46] not just put the burden on everybody
[1:58:48] else. I got to be willing to put
[1:58:50] something in too.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; You know how you know, brother Mike used
[1:58:53] to tell me how the churches used to do
[1:58:55] that that you know they come up and have
[1:58:57] an offering and uh brother we trying to
[1:59:00] raise this much money and I'm going to
[1:59:02] start it out with $100. I'm going to
[1:59:04] start out with $100. I'm put my $100 in
[1:59:06] here and uh and they get everybody to
[1:59:09] come up there and give their $100. But
[1:59:11] the guys that's collecting the money,
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; they go right back to the back. They
[1:59:17] count the money. They take their $100
[1:59:19] and put it right back in their pocket.
[1:59:22] It happened in church, y'all. Y'all
[1:59:23] think I'm playing. It happens in church.
[1:59:26] They done took all your money, but they
[1:59:28] done put their money back in their
[1:59:29] pocket. And they coming back the next
[1:59:30] service with that same $100 like they
[1:59:33] got hundreds. No, they're using the same
[1:59:35] $100 bill
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; and they robbing the people of God.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you another thing. If you
[1:59:45] got to go to a church and they got to
[1:59:46] have three or four offerings, something
[1:59:48] is wrong.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; You don't need to raise that kind of
[1:59:52] money. If God is watching over work,
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; he will provide for it.
[1:59:56] Amen.
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; So, so what we see here is that these
[2:00:00] different prophets that Ezra is speaking
[2:00:02] of, we got we got Haggi, we got
[2:00:05] Zachchariah,
[2:00:06] Zerubbabel, you know, uh is being used
[2:00:09] during this time. And um uh um I want to
[2:00:12] skip down to verse seven just for sake
[2:00:14] of time. Let me just see something here.
[2:00:15] Hold on one second. Actually, actually
[2:00:18] before I go, let me um before since we
[2:00:20] since we see Zachcharias used there, I
[2:00:22] want to give you some inspiration during
[2:00:24] the restoration. Let's look at one of
[2:00:26] the scriptures that was spoken out of
[2:00:28] Zechariah
[2:00:29] 4 verse 6 and 7. Amen. Zechariah chapter
[2:00:33] 4 verse 6 and 7. [snorts] This is
[2:00:36] inspiration that comes during the
[2:00:38] restoration. Then he answered and spake
[2:00:41] to me, saying, This is the word of the
[2:00:43] Lord unto Zerubbabel,
[2:00:48] saying, "Not by might,
[2:00:52] nor by power, but by my spirit,
[2:00:57] saith the Lord of hosts."
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; This comes during this time of post uh
[2:01:01] their post exilelic uh uh uh era, right?
[2:01:05] So when they're coming back into the
[2:01:06] land, these different prophets rise up
[2:01:08] and they begin to speak these things
[2:01:11] over the people of God. I like this. It
[2:01:15] says, "Not by might, nor by power, but
[2:01:19] by my spirit." Look, we when when when
[2:01:21] they got ready to rebuild that temple,
[2:01:23] Lord, I'm I'm I'm I'm going to get ahead
[2:01:25] of myself. I'm going to get ahead of
[2:01:26] myself. When they got ready to rebuild
[2:01:28] that temple, you know, sometimes when
[2:01:30] you look at might, it's like brute
[2:01:32] strength. we got a great army or
[2:01:34] something like that to do. They didn't
[2:01:36] have all of that to be able to rebuild
[2:01:38] the temple. They were going through a
[2:01:39] lot of challenges, a lot of tension when
[2:01:42] it was time to rebuild the temple as
[2:01:43] well as REBUILD THE WALLS. LOT OF
[2:01:45] TENSION WHEN THEY WAS REBUILDING THE
[2:01:46] WALLS. THEY HAD to have one people, they
[2:01:48] had to have a group of guys stand in
[2:01:50] guard with a sword while the others were
[2:01:53] laying bricks.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; Man, it was fight. I mean they had they
[2:01:56] had to fear for their life but not by
[2:01:58] might nor by power but by my spirit in
[2:02:03] the rebuilding of the temple. It's not
[2:02:05] going to be by might nor by power but by
[2:02:08] my spirit. Let me also say it this way.
[2:02:11] In the building of the temple
[2:02:15] in the building of the temple it's not
[2:02:18] by might
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; nor by power but by his spirit. Now when
[2:02:22] I say in the building of the temple, I'm
[2:02:25] speaking present tense.
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; I'm speaking for our church. It's not
[2:02:30] going to be by might, NOR WILL IT BE BY
[2:02:33] POWER, BUT IT'LL BE BY THE spirit of
[2:02:35] God.
[2:02:37] [applause]
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; Let me give you another prophecy that
[2:02:42] went forth. Haggi chapter 2
[2:02:47] verse 9.
[2:02:49] Haggi 2 and verse nine, the glory
[2:02:55] of this latter house
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; shall be greater
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; than of the former,
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; sayeth the Lord of hosts. And in this
[2:03:06] place will I give peace, sayeth the Lord
[2:03:10] of hosts. Now here, Hagi is prophesying
[2:03:13] while he's working. Now, while they're
[2:03:15] working, they're prophesying. Look,
[2:03:16] look, look, look, look, look, fellas.
[2:03:17] Y'all don't see what I see. But the
[2:03:19] glory of this ladder house, not when
[2:03:22] Solomon built it, but now that it's
[2:03:24] being restored, it's going to be better
[2:03:26] than it ever was before.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; Woo! Restoration brings it back better.
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; Restoration does not bring replacement.
[2:03:34] It brings up the same THING THAT WAS
[2:03:36] THERE. AMEN.
[2:03:39] [snorts]
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; I I I'mma I'mma I'mma just uh
[2:03:44] I got to slip this in cuz I'm I'm I'm
[2:03:48] out of time. I'm out of time. You know,
[2:03:52] one of the glorious things about the
[2:03:53] latter house.
[2:03:58] Father, help me Jesus.
[2:04:02] One of the glorious things that happened
[2:04:03] and I and I I'm out of time. I'm I'mma
[2:04:05] read this to you maybe next week or next
[2:04:07] time I come. But one of the glorious
[2:04:09] things that happened in the in the
[2:04:10] latter house when it was when it was
[2:04:13] being put back up, just the foundation
[2:04:16] alone,
[2:04:17] when they just laid the foundation, I
[2:04:20] mean, the whole building wasn't even up.
[2:04:22] But when the when the when the saints
[2:04:24] saw the foundation laid, it caused them
[2:04:27] to go into a worship like never before.
[2:04:32] It was so much weeping and crying just
[2:04:35] to see the foundation. This was after 70
[2:04:38] 70 years of being away and now we come
[2:04:40] back and the foundation because when you
[2:04:42] see the foundation is is we going to we
[2:04:44] getting ready to bring up a whole
[2:04:45] building here.
[2:04:46] &gt;&gt; If the foundation here, we know if God
[2:04:48] laid the foundation, we know the rest of
[2:04:50] the building going to get be completed.
[2:04:52] God ain't just going to give us just a
[2:04:53] foundation.
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; Oh my. It brought tears to my tears to
[2:04:57] the eyes when they just saw the
[2:04:58] foundation. Look, I'm telling you, God
[2:05:00] has given us. Amen. He's blessed our
[2:05:02] finances with so a foundation can be
[2:05:04] laid.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; We ought to be rejoicing with just a
[2:05:08] foundation. We know God going to
[2:05:09] complete the rest of it.
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; Boy, I tell you the truth. I want to
[2:05:17] show you something here in the
[2:05:18] scripture. when they
[2:05:22] Haggi says the the glory of the latter
[2:05:24] house. One of the other glorious things
[2:05:25] that happened about this latter house,
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; the children of Israel did not have to
[2:05:33] pay for it to be built.
[2:05:43] [applause and cheering]
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; I I'm I'm way ahead of myself, but I I
[2:05:46] just need to get this off my chest.
[2:05:49] That's a
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; in Ezra chapter 6
[2:05:57] cuz what happened in Ezra chapter 5 is
[2:06:00] that there were some people coming
[2:06:02] against the children of Israel like why
[2:06:03] y'all building this house? We going to
[2:06:04] send a letter to the king to find out
[2:06:06] what's going on. Y'all building so fast.
[2:06:07] What what is going on? And they they're
[2:06:09] trying to come tension was coming in and
[2:06:12] they're trying to figure out what's
[2:06:13] going on. They say they say they say
[2:06:14] look look look God has given us the uh
[2:06:17] ability to do this and and we got we got
[2:06:20] instructions from Cyrus
[2:06:23] in order to build this. He said if you
[2:06:26] don't believe us y'all write back and
[2:06:27] y'all ask Darius what happened and and
[2:06:30] look at the recordings of what Cyrus
[2:06:32] said. Let's go to uh uh uh chapter 6.
[2:06:34] Ezra chapter 6 and and verse one. I'mma
[2:06:37] read it real quick and I'mma I'mma I'm
[2:06:39] I'mma have to leave. Then Darius the
[2:06:42] king made a decree and search was made
[2:06:43] in the house of the rose where the
[2:06:44] treasures were laid up in Babylon.
[2:06:48] And there was found at Ametha in the
[2:06:51] palace that is in the province of the me
[2:06:54] a role and therein was a record thus
[2:06:56] written. Now in order to it's a role. So
[2:06:59] in order to to see what's in it, you got
[2:07:01] to unseal it.
[2:07:03] And there was found ECH in the palace
[2:07:06] that is in the province of the me a roll
[2:07:07] and and therein was a record that's
[2:07:09] written. Look at this.
[2:07:12] In the first year of Cyrus
[2:07:16] the king, the same Cyrus the king made a
[2:07:18] decree concerning the house of God at
[2:07:20] Jerusalem.
[2:07:21] Let the house be built,
[2:07:25] the place where they offered sacrifices.
[2:07:27] This was restoration.
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; And let the foundations thereof be
[2:07:32] strongly laid, the height thereof three
[2:07:34] score cubits, and the breath thereof
[2:07:36] three score cubits.
[2:07:40] with three rows of great stones and a
[2:07:42] row of new timber. And let the expenses,
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; let the expenses
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; be given
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; out of the king's house.
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; Cyrus paid for the restoration of the
[2:08:05] temple. Now, I'm getting ready to leave
[2:08:08] you cuz every once in a while in your
[2:08:10] life, you're going to need
[2:08:13] a Cirrus.
[2:08:16] [applause]
[2:08:18] [cheering]
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; And let me put IT THIS WAY, GOD GOING TO
[2:08:22] GIVE YOU A CYRUS
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; IN order to pay for some of the things
[2:08:26] you can't pay for.
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; SOME OF THE EXPENSES YOU CAN'T COVER,
[2:08:31] GOD WILL PLACE A CYRUS IN YOUR LIFE.
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I'M RECEIVING CYRUS.
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; MAN, THIS WAS SOME INSPIRATION DURING
[2:08:44] THE RESTORATION. LORD, SEND [screaming]
[2:08:46] CYRUS.
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; RAISE UP CYRUS.
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; I had to think about that scripture.
[2:08:59] &gt;&gt; We look for Cyruses a lot. But then I
[2:09:03] thought about this. I said, "Lord,
[2:09:05] make me a Cyrus."
[2:09:08] [cheering]
[2:09:11] [applause]
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, God.
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; See, there's testimonies I can share
[2:09:16] right there, but I I'm out of time.
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; Don't just don't Don't have the mindset
[2:09:21] to always looking for Cyrus.
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; But why not? Why not?
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; Why not be Cyrus?
[2:09:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; The expenses can be paid out of the
[2:09:37] king's treasure. I I I'm I'm I'm I'm
[2:09:43] thinking of a scripture that says
[2:09:48] Oh my I got it right here.
[2:09:54] The wages of sin is death.
[2:09:58] But the gift of God is eternal life
[2:10:01] through the Lord Jesus Christ. What we
[2:10:03] find in the book of Ezra is that the
[2:10:05] expenses were paid by the king.
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; Now that's naturally, but spiritually we
[2:10:12] also had expenses paid by
[2:10:15] the King of Kings.
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; There is an expense to sin. You get paid
[2:10:22] for sin. The wages of sin is death.
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; But the gift of God is eternal life
[2:10:29] through Jesus Christ our Lord. So
[2:10:31] there's an expense to sin. There is also
[2:10:33] an expense to set us free from sin.
[2:10:36] &gt;&gt; There's an expense also for restoration.
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; You know AMC paid an expense to Abraham
[2:10:45] during restoration.
[2:10:48] The thief that was caught stealing in
[2:10:50] Exodus 20 also had to pay the expense of
[2:10:53] restoration.
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; I want to let you know the King of Kings
[2:10:58] has paid your expense.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; When he went to the cross and died for
[2:11:02] your sins, your expenses are all
[2:11:06] covered. And it's a good feeling. I
[2:11:09] don't know. I've gone to restaurants
[2:11:10] sometime with other people and and the
[2:11:12] check comes and I'm ready to pay the
[2:11:16] expense,
[2:11:18] but I find out.
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; Hey, somebody
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; that has already been paid.
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; And you know what? Especially when the
[2:11:27] when it's a big check,
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; a big bill,
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; I feel pretty good about that. You mean
[2:11:33] it didn't have to hit my bank account?
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; God bless. Whoever did that, God bless
[2:11:40] you.
[2:11:43] &gt;&gt; It's something about having your
[2:11:44] expenses paid. I'm telling you, the King
[2:11:46] of Kings has paid your expense.
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; And and here's the other thing I'm
[2:11:51] looking for. I'm looking for the expense
[2:11:54] to come out of the King's chest again
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; for our church and school. Amen.
[2:12:01] [applause]
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; Lord, send Cyrus
[2:12:05] or make me Cyrus.
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; God bless you, church. God bless you.
[2:12:11] [applause]
[2:12:12] Praise the Lord. Let's have a word of
[2:12:14] prayer. Brother Solomon, I'll turn it
[2:12:15] back over to you. Musicians can make
[2:12:17] your way back forward. Father, we thank
[2:12:18] you, Lord Jesus, for your word on today.
[2:12:23] We thank you, Father,
[2:12:25] uh that we can just rejoice in the
[2:12:28] things that we see in scripture.
[2:12:32] You uh you have purpose for everything.
[2:12:35] Nothing is written just to be written,
[2:12:37] but God, you have divine purpose and and
[2:12:41] and and when we look at these things,
[2:12:43] it's not just for the day gone by. It's
[2:12:46] something we can apply even present
[2:12:48] tense.
[2:12:50] So help us Lord Jesus to see you in all
[2:12:53] the scripture. Father that we might not
[2:12:55] live beneath our privileges but we would
[2:12:57] live Lord in that place that you desire
[2:13:00] for us to live. Thank you for the
[2:13:03] inspiration that is all throughout this
[2:13:06] theme of restoration.
[2:13:08] And God, I pray that every ear that has
[2:13:10] heard the word today, that it would be a
[2:13:12] word that transforms our life,
[2:13:15] transforms our thinking,
[2:13:18] gives us purpose, gives us renewal,
[2:13:20] gives us hope. God, you know the plans
[2:13:23] you have for us to give us hope and a
[2:13:26] future.
[2:13:28] And Father, I pray that we will walk
[2:13:29] into all that you have. not not not be
[2:13:32] crushed by the tension, not be all broke
[2:13:34] up by the tension that is coming to our
[2:13:36] life, but Lord, to learn how to praise
[2:13:38] you in the midst of it because you're
[2:13:41] still worthy to be praised.
[2:13:43] We ask that you would bless your people,
[2:13:45] God. It's in Jesus [music] name we pray.
[2:13:49] Amen. Amen. God bless your church.
[2:13:58] Praise the Lord. Will you stand with me?
[2:14:00] How many appreciates the message this
[2:14:02] morning?
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's sing this little song
[2:14:10] together. You are [singing] here
[2:14:15] moving in our midst.
[2:14:20] I worship you.
[2:14:24] I worship you
[2:14:29] and you are here
[2:14:33] moving in [screaming] our knees.
[2:14:38] I worship you. [singing]
[2:14:41] Oh, I worship you.
[2:14:47] You are a way maker, miracle worker,
[2:14:53] promise keeper, light in the darkness.
[2:14:58] My God, that is who you are.
[2:15:05] [singing]
[2:15:07] [music]
[2:15:07] Way maker, miracle worker, promise
[2:15:12] keeper, light in the darkness.
[2:15:16] My God, that is who [singing] you are.
