church had been invited to go there for one of the services where our pastor Minister and brother Jack was conducting the sung service and it was just a glorious time and when we got back to our home church how pastor made comments about it he was just so caught up just thinking about the atmosphere that had been said and one of the things that he said is that brother has stepped into the vision those words kind of stuck with me for four days and one day I found myself doing hope some work around the house and kept coming and coming I got a pen and I sat down and I started writing and these
