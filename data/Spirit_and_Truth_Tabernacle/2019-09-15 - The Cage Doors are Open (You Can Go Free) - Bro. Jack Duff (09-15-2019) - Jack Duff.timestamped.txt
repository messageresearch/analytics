[1:07:23] when we worship no matter what we're

[1:10:45] we're saving for we're believing got
[1:10:47] from the church in the school and a man
[1:10:50] and and and and I say all things are
[1:10:53] possible a man if we just believed so
[1:10:56] thank God for that god bless you can
[1:10:57] turn on the lights and a man I this
[1:11:02] morning on a why but for some reason the
[1:11:06] the sermon that I prepared wouldn't
[1:11:10] update on my my I got two tablets and it
[1:11:14] didn't update on on either of them and
[1:11:17] so I had to bring my laptop a man to
[1:11:21] preach from this morning so just bear
[1:11:24] with me a little bit larger than what I
[1:11:25] usually have up here but you know
[1:11:29] hopefully you still get the message a
[1:11:31] man and you know just some time the
[1:11:34] devil like to just throw a little
[1:11:35] wrenches and things and it's like you
[1:11:37] know what there's another way around
[1:11:39] that you just gotta look at the dough so
[1:11:42] you know this too shall pass it okay
[1:11:44] we'll go around that and we'll go you
[1:11:46] throw something else up we'll go around
[1:11:48] that too and a man if we have to push it
[1:11:51] or push it over you know what
[1:11:53] whatever tape right but but we just
[1:11:55] thank the Lord for all things
[1:11:57] thank God brother Martin from Boynton
[1:12:00] came to minister for us on Friday night
[1:12:03] and we had a wonderful time here
[1:12:05] a man him preaching I will restore saith
[1:12:11] the Lord
[1:12:12] and he made a real good emphasis on
[1:12:15] saith the Lord mean that God signed it
[1:12:21] and and and if God signs a promise you
[1:12:27] understand if if a king signs a decree
[1:12:33] there is nobody not even the king
[1:12:37] himself can change what he saw no
[1:12:44] circumstance can change him no situation
[1:12:48] can change it right and I mean when the
[1:12:51] king was feeling so sorry for Daniel he
[1:12:54] wanted to change it but he knew that the
[1:12:56] laws a man stated that once the King
[1:12:59] signed it they had to go through with it
[1:13:02] hallelujah I thank God for that right
[1:13:05] because if God said I will restore then
[1:13:10] I don't need I don't need nobody else to
[1:13:12] sing nothing
[1:13:13] [Music]
[1:13:16] I ain't looking at nothing I'm looking
[1:13:18] at the signature hey man when you argued
[1:13:23] certain things a man in court or
[1:13:25] whatever it is this your signature is
[1:13:29] this your signature did you sign for
[1:13:31] this if you sign for this yours right
[1:13:33] and so I know God signed it and it's my
[1:13:36] promise because he gave it to me and I'm
[1:13:38] just under expectation for him to bring
[1:13:40] it to pass but I will restore sayeth the
[1:13:43] Lord they made everybody ought to take
[1:13:46] that and run with that but man that is
[1:13:48] your promise don't let no situation
[1:13:50] change it don't let no devil change it
[1:13:52] nothing nothing nothing I will risk lost
[1:13:54] power restore your health
[1:13:56] I restore your finances I'll restore
[1:13:59] your family I will restore save the Lord
[1:14:04] he didn't put limits on nothing Oh glory
[1:14:08] to God Church I was blessed you know he
[1:14:16] said he just had that in his heart to
[1:14:18] bring to the church he'd been they've
[1:14:20] been telling me for some time that
[1:14:21] brother Jack I just got this sermon that
[1:14:23] Lord gave me and he's and he said the
[1:14:25] Lord told him don't go nowhere else to
[1:14:28] preach first you go to spirit and truth
[1:14:30] Tabernacle first and any and you know
[1:14:35] and some of you all were witnesses cuz
[1:14:36] it told you all the Lord gave me a
[1:14:38] message he'd been waiting about a good
[1:14:39] year I would say to deliver that's it
[1:14:42] that's a that's that's that's a good
[1:14:45] thing right you know I appreciate
[1:14:48] brothers that can just wait for the Lord
[1:14:50] to open up the doors for them right
[1:14:52] the man's gift maketh room for himself
[1:14:54] and bringing him before great men this
[1:14:56] is what the Bible said but he waited I
[1:14:58] want to say at least at least a year and
[1:14:59] and and and you know I thought the time
[1:15:03] was perfect because on Friday night amen
[1:15:06] my grandson came to church and you know
[1:15:09] just by God's predestinated plan my wife
[1:15:15] was watching him for Friday night Friday

[1:15:21] and he come to church and and brother
[1:15:25] Martin preaches that and I say brother
[1:15:27] to be tonight because Elias was here
[1:15:30] right any lie is according to the
[1:15:33] scripture

[1:17:01] and I want you to remember sometimes you
[1:17:06] look at troubles and trials that come
[1:17:08] into your life and you know this one
[1:17:10] said this this one said that this one
[1:17:12] doing this just when doing that remember
[1:17:14] those are not angry clouds a man but
[1:17:18] those are angels wings beating together
[1:17:23] right and the reason that you see it as
[1:17:26] angry clouds because you standing too
[1:17:27] far back you got to get closer to it to
[1:17:31] see that God is using this thing for his
[1:17:33] glory
[1:17:38] will you buck attack I say when you
[1:17:42] pluck it out is there something you can
[1:17:50] throw right on in the bucket amen all
[1:17:53] things are working together for good to
[1:17:55] them that love God to them who are the
[1:17:57] called according to his purpose
[1:17:59] amen I just I praise them I know y'all
[1:18:03] got things to do and I'm gonna try to
[1:18:04] get on that child way but I just feel
[1:18:06] good I feel not only I feel good I feel
[1:18:09] God I feel God just just talking this
[1:18:18] morning and in Sunday school and and
[1:18:20] brother Branham was saying that at
[1:18:22] church age book he said how do we know
[1:18:26] that Jesus is in you know the bosom of
[1:18:31] the Father how do we know these things
[1:18:32] he said the reason that we know that is
[1:18:34] because he sent the Holy Ghost
[1:18:36] they say the Holy Ghost came that's how
[1:18:39] we know Jesus is with the father because
[1:18:41] the promise was that after he goes away
[1:18:44] he was sending the Holy Ghost and I
[1:18:46] actually the classes say now how you
[1:18:48] know the Holy Ghost came hey then how do
[1:18:51] you know the Holy Ghost came and and
[1:18:54] each one start gets kind of chiming in
[1:18:56] because it came in me say man that's
[1:18:58] good I say say I start thinking I
[1:19:00] started thinking about services like
[1:19:01] this the reason we know the Holy Ghost
[1:19:04] came because we got together to worship
[1:19:06] and there was a different atmosphere
[1:19:08] that was in the place that's how we know
[1:19:10] the Holy Ghost came and can I tell you
[1:19:12] something the Holy Ghost come we come to
[1:19:14] change
[1:19:15] he come to disrupt right he comes to
[1:19:19] make move he makes us start something
[1:19:22] fresh inside of you amen and and and the
[1:19:25] other thing I won't say when the Holy
[1:19:26] Ghost come what you're supposed to do is
[1:19:28] just worship come on somebody rather
[1:19:36] Simba said I see how you know the Holy
[1:19:38] Ghost came brother Simba say you know
[1:19:40] when brother brother whispers here he is
[1:19:41] preaching and we know the Holy Ghost
[1:19:43] came how y'all heard them but that real
[1:19:46] good because something got ahold of
[1:19:48] brother Garen on the corner over there
[1:19:54] hey some some revelation from heaven
[1:19:59] just went straight towards him you can't
[1:20:04] do nothing but something shouting
[1:20:06] Russian people that did not come here to
[1:20:16] give God a praise maybe they came
[1:20:19] because they mama made him come by they
[1:20:21] data made him come or just they're so
[1:20:23] out a little bit it meant to say that
[1:20:26] you came to church but when the Holy
[1:20:29] Ghost comes he wants to change your life
[1:20:46] we are the expectation for him to come
[1:20:50] again every time we gather in these
[1:20:53] dolls we're looking for the Holy Ghost
[1:20:56] to come please and you came to the wrong
[1:21:01] place if you if you came to the wrong
[1:21:07] place there's somebody creating the
[1:21:10] sphere place if you did want to be set
[1:21:18] free you came to the right place this is
[1:21:22] a place where the Holy Ghost will have
[1:21:24] recourse going to God and he will do the
[1:21:29] exceeding abundant above all we can ask
[1:21:32] or even thing

[1:46:35] that thing as they come into the house
[1:46:37] of the Lord they're just wearing it and
[1:46:38] and then they get and one of the one of
[1:46:41] the spouses just start worshipping and
[1:46:43] praising God and the other spouse is
[1:46:45] sitting there looking at you know what
[1:46:47] we just went through and you in here
[1:46:48] praising God like this you ain't nothing
[1:46:50] but a hypocrite so your spirit becoming
[1:46:52] contrite getting number two hypocrite
[1:46:56] and so so so so at the church they get
[1:46:59] into the car and they talk now you know

[1:47:05] could you praise God know what we just
[1:47:07] went through and I and now y'all know
[1:47:12] the story I'm gonna just say the other
[1:47:13] spouse i'ma say it like that
[1:47:15] the other spouse say well you know I
[1:47:18] know we went through but goddamn do
[1:47:20] nothin tell me
[1:47:24] and since God didn't do none to me I'm
[1:47:26] not gonna have what we call emotional
[1:47:28] leakage my emotions have leaked into my
[1:47:34] praise and my emotions have stopped my
[1:47:37] praise right I'm not gonna have a
[1:47:39] motional leakage praise God I don't mean
[1:47:42] that you don't go fix it but understand
[1:47:44] don't let the devil take your brace your
[1:47:48] praise that's what's gonna give you
[1:47:49] victory says the Lord is not unto them
[1:47:55] that of a broken heart and save it such
[1:47:57] as beat of a contrite spirit look at
[1:48:01] this Mimi I think somebody could see it
[1:48:07] Lord that's just father ask me go
[1:48:12] I hear you Jesus I hear you Jesus many
[1:48:18] some I say don't even start me to
[1:48:20] testify many are the afflictions oh wait
[1:48:30] a minute wait a minute wait a minute
[1:48:32] wait a minute wait a minute wait a
[1:48:34] minute see if the afflictions are
[1:48:38] righteous if many of the fictions are
[1:48:40] for the righteous that means God did not
[1:48:42] forsake you when you start going through
[1:48:45] them that mean that means you didn't you
[1:48:50] didn't do nothing to get that kind of
[1:48:53] like Joe Jobe didn't do nothing wrong to
[1:48:56] get that trial it was just it was simply
[1:48:58] a suggestion
[1:49:04] it was a godly suggestion the trial that
[1:49:09] Joe had that almost took his life was a
[1:49:13] godly suggestion with stipulations so
[1:49:21] all you under right now is a godly
[1:49:23] suggestion with stipulations have you
[1:49:34] considered my servant joke now you can
[1:49:36] do this and you can do that but you
[1:49:37] can't take his life stipulations and I
[1:49:41] guarantee no matter what you do Joe will
[1:49:44] still love me send some friends by that
[1:49:48] don't don't mean no good you got all
[1:49:50] kind of negative things to say but jobs
[1:49:52] still gonna love me raise up his wife
[1:49:55] the closest thing to let us start
[1:49:58] talking a different talk Joe still gonna
[1:50:00] love me I wonder if anybody still love
[1:50:04] God no matter what you're going through
[1:50:07] the promise on this is many other
[1:50:10] afflictions of the righteous but you
[1:50:13] know what bud is right a conjunction and
[1:50:17] conjunctions change functions
[1:50:29] but the Lord delivereth him out of some
[1:50:37] of them the Lord delivered him out of
[1:50:48] them all he keepeth all his bones not
[1:50:59] one of them is broken evil shall slay
[1:51:03] the wicked and they that hate the
[1:51:06] righteous shall be blessed they die
[1:51:14] hating the righteous shall be desolate
[1:51:16] let God fight it the Lord redeemeth the
[1:51:20] soul of his servants and none of them
[1:51:23] that trust in him shall be desolate God
[1:51:29] will make a way where there seems to be
[1:51:33] no way he opens doors we cannot see
[1:51:40] he will make a way for me he will beat
[1:51:44] my god
