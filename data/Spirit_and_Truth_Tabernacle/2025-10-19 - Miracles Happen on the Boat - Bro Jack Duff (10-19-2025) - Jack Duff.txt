Being with us. a man from uh the UK there, brother Gwenna's church. Uh brother Kusai was one of the ones that when we would go, we usually always go stay at um uh before the meetings, we stay at Premier Inn down in Earl's Court and um and so Brother Kusai would always uh help us get up to the church.

Um Sister uh Cindy, God bless you. And I saw two other sisters here. Wait a minute. That's is that Ashley? Oh my my Ashley told me she was coming and she's here. Good to have you. Amen. Now, I'mma I'mma I'mma put Ashley on the spot. I'mma put on the spot because she she blessed me something. She text me this week. Um I was referred to her, me and Sister Erica were referred to her and her husband just to offer some um just marital I don't want I don't like to call it counseling, just advice, right? Because when you tell a man he's going to marital counseling, he think he broke and he need to be fixed and and you can't get him to do nothing but no advice. You got people that's been married 32 years that can tell you something. &gt;&gt; So just take some advice, right? And uh so we we got together and she text me. She say, "Pastor, me and uh my husband still uh using the advice that y'all gave us and we're doing well." And um that blesses me because some folk won't take your advice. &gt;&gt; But uh she stands as a testimony. Our marriage is flourishing &gt;&gt; because we took advice. &gt;&gt; Amen. So good to have you, Sister Ashley. Now, who you brought with you? All right. Cynthia, you say God bless you, Sister Cynthia. So good to have you with us on today. Amen. We thank God for all things. And Trell, Trell was here last week. He was out in the parking lot listening and soon as brother Jean finished, he come running up. Brother, I I was listening. I was listening. So this this week he came from the parking lot inside. Good to see you, brother Trellic. God bless you. Amen. You and your son. Amen. Praise the Lord. So we we thank God for all things. Uh, one other thing I just need to make mention of before we get into the word. Uh, I was here with the musicians on Friday night and we were rehearsing and um, I thank God for our musicians. Amen. Just appreciate them so much. Uh, but while I was here, I got a text message uh, telling me that uh, Sister Anderson up in South Carolina, she's the pastor's wife, brother Charles Anderson there at Jesus Christ Tabernacle. uh sister Anderson had passed away and um you know so yesterday I uh uh my my wife just sent me a little reminder say I think it'll be good to call brother Anderson you know just or text him or something. I said yeah I'll certainly do that. So I I jumped on it and and me and brother Anderson probably talked for about 30 minutes and uh he was just sharing you know a lot of little things that that had just you know happened and how they the the church just bought a bus and he said they got seat 37 pastors and they can't wait for something to happen in Florida cuz they want to bring the bus to Florida. And I say well praise the Lord. He he said we just went to Indiana to go to Jeffersonville and and all of that. And he says, "And I didn't want to go because I knew Sister Anderson wasn't feeling well and she wouldn't be able to make the trip." And she said, "If you don't go, you make me feel worse." And uh she say, "So he say so she put pressure on me and made me go on that trip. It was like the first time us taking the bus out and we had a wonderful time, you know, there at brother Nathan Bryan's church and um um you know, so when they they got back, you know, he knew that she wasn't feeling, you know, her best and uh she wasn't eating the way she should. And um you know, but he says um you know, she had been going through cancer uh for over a year and um but he said that uh I guess Friday morning, Friday afternoon, something like that. He she called him into the room and uh when he came into the room, he saw her on her knees uh praying uh to the Lord. And uh he says, "We helped her get back in the bed." head. He said, "But it just the just the it was taking so much out of her just to move around like that." And he says, "Uh she was just laying her in the bed and all of a sudden she just stopped breathing and uh the Lord had called her home." And uh you know, he was he was he was saying it was just so peaceful uh to see her. And I thought of the scripture um precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of one of his saints. And uh you know and how she just she just she just slept away you know so peacefully and uh you know he was just um you know said there was many you know go coming in and out of the house but uh he was just blessed. I think God gave them 52 years of marriage. Um uh something like that. He told me he met her in the ninth grade and uh you know but but they knew each other for 56 years but 52 years of marriage and uh God God was good. Amen. So we want to remember brother Anderson and the family uh in prayer as well as the church. We know it's not easy and and I was just thinking, you know, man, it would be nice if, you know, I could try to slip up there, but I don't know. Uh my wife had to help me realize where I was on the calendar. And uh on next Sunday, I'll be here uh to minister, but as soon as I finish preaching, uh me and some other saints are jumping on a plane and we're headed to Australia for some meetings. Amen. And so, uh, I don't know how I'll be able to navigate this. And, uh, but if I can't, hopefully I can send somebody from the church to be representation, amen, of Spirit and Truth Tabernacle, as the church there in uh, um, uh, Colombia, West Colombia. Jesus Christ tabernacle has been a blessing to us. Amen. And brother Anderson was the one that opened this pullpit to me uh to allow me to preach there. And from him opening that pullpit, I've got many invitations uh throughout South Carolina. But I always, amen, pay respect to him because he was the one to take a step of faith. And and I remember a time where there were brothers in South Carolina telling other brothers, "Don't go visit Spirit and Truth Tabernacle." They said it, "Don't go visit them." and brothers brothers disregarded what they said and came on here anyway. And brother Diggs is one of those brothers that came anyway. And he came when we didn't even have musicians, &gt;&gt; but we worship with our mouths, &gt;&gt; right? And we would just we just make them sweet harmonies and um and and people would come and just hear that like, boy, it's something about this. Now, y'all don't stop singing when we get the music now. Y'all keep singing. But uh but but but I I just remember those times where brother Anderson was there as a um an encouragement and strength to us. So very very uh appreciative of his ministry and even with the um uh we've done for the past couple years we've gone there and we've done some of the marriage uh seminars there and uh I I'm I'm grateful for them opening the doors allowing me and sister Erica to come. We took brother Jonathan and sister Sarah with us uh early this year, but I'm grateful for that. But I want to do it here in Florida. We want to do the same marriage seminar here in Florida. So uh but brother Anderson's been very very uh him and sister Anderson very supportive of of us and we've been, you know, just very appreciative. So let's keep the family in prayer and the church in prayer. Amen. During this season, um we'll rise to our feet. We'll read a scripture and then um we'll have a word of prayer over the word as well as we'll pray uh for brother Anderson and the church. Um this scripture comes out of James 3 and I will tell you um that I'm reading this but you know I I couldn't find the scripture that I was really looking for to really nail this down. But I'm I got to give you something out the word of God. Uh but this scripture that we're reading is really more related to how you should control your tongue. &gt;&gt; That's that's that's what this scripture is related to. Now I'm not preaching that today, but when you read it, it's talking about your mouth. &gt;&gt; All right. Amen. But but it's it's it's it's uh I'm using it in a different context today. Amen. But uh here in um James 3 and verse 4 uh it says, "Behold also the ships which though they be so great and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whethersoever the governor listeth." Amen. Let us pray uh over God's word. Father, we come in the name of Jesus. We thank you that we have felt your presence thus far in the worship. And um as we come, Father, to approach the word, we trust that the spirit of God would now speak through your word to each and every heart. Uh help us, oh God, to draw closer to you uh through the understanding and revelation of the scripture. We we ask Lord that um you'd not only remember us as we're gathering, but the church there in South Carolina is gathering and um the matriarch has been called home. The pastor has lost his his wife. And God, I know that church needs your strength and they need your comfort. They need your help. They need your direction. I pray that you would help them, Father, that you would just minister to the needs of the pastor, his children, grandchildren, Lord, the entire family, entire body of believers that are gathered there. May your spirit, Lord, bring comfort. And we ask, oh God, that you would just move, Lord, in in supernatural ways for them. There's also saints in our midst. I got text messages from saints that are not feeling well in their bodies. I pray that you would touch &gt;&gt; power oning &gt;&gt; completely whole. God, we give you all the glory, the honor, and the praise. It's in Jesus' name that we pray. Amen. You can be seated in the presence of the Lord. Um I want to just start by reading this is on the back page, Sister Shereice. Uh there's a a little quote here from a sermon why Christ speak. And uh my inspiration uh comes from uh this little quote. Our title today is miracles happen in the boat. Amen. Miracles happen in the boat. Praise God. Amen. Um the why Christ speak there was a sermon preached and little statement made says now today we are expecting uh a great time in the Lord and it says and I had uh two or three different texts here that I was looking at and I and I this is very um uh real to me even though this sermon was preached back in 1963. I was uh there's I got a little sermon that I had in my heart that I wanted to minister and I said, "Well, I didn't want to bring it today because I thought so many saints was going to be missing." Uh I knew some that was going to be be missing and uh but I said, "Well, I I'll maybe go a different direction and save that uh when when everybody's home." Praise the Lord. Uh but uh but so he says he said I had two or three different texts here that I was looking at and I couldn't couldn't figure out just which one I would talk on this morning. Says one of them was cast your cares on him for he cares for you. Now if he cares why not you &gt;&gt; right? So then another one he says Billy Paul not Billy Paul my other son Joseph brought me this text a long time ago. He was sitting in the room one day and he said looking up towards the picture. Uh it says Joseph is very fond of boats uh like like little boys, boats and horses, you know. And he said to me, "Daddy, has Jesus got a boat? Has Jesus got a boat?" And I said, "I don't know." So then after he got up and went out, I happened to think, "Uh, has he got a boat?" And it says, and I took a text from that and just marked it down here in my book. Has Jesus got a boat? So, Brother Brandham's looking to preach that sermon. Has Jesus got a boat? Says, and I happen to think when he was here on earth, he had to borrow a womb to be born, I mean to uh to be born in and also borrow a grave to be buried in &gt;&gt; and a boat to preach from. But he's the pilot of the old ship of Zion. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we are taking this little thought today. Amen. On miracles happen in the boat. Glory to God. Miracles happen in the boat. So um you know we want to just take a quick journey. Amen. back in scripture because we there was um a boat that God used at the very beginning in Genesis. Amen. Uh to save uh just a few human beings. But let's let's pick up this out of Genesis chapter 6. Praise God. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Uh Genesis 6 and we'll we'll read. Amen. From here starting at verse 14. Now uh we know this uh particular passage is really talking about Noah and um uh and we we know the story of Noah. We we've heard it many a times and uh Noah was a man actually the scripture says he found grace in the sight of the Lord. The earth was at a time where there was so much wickedness. Uh it was so corrupt uh on the earth in Noah's day that that actually God got to the spot where he was actually disappointed that he had even created man, right? Uh and and and and and being in such a situation uh God just so fed up with sin. Hallelujah. Uh he was so fed up with sin that he says, "You know what? Uh, I'm going to destroy the earth because of the way that men are living on the earth. I'm going to destroy it. And he decided to destroy it with water. But because Noah found grace in his sight, he wouldn't destroy Noah and his children or whoever else would uh would would would hear Noah's message and get on the boat. &gt;&gt; Because you see, the miracle happens in the boat. &gt;&gt; You can't be off the boat and expect a miracle. You have to be in the boat. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And and the Bible clearly tells us that as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be in the coming of the son of man. So if if if the barometer of God was getting amen so high that he just could not stand sin on the earth. He had to destroy them. &gt;&gt; He'll have to do the same exact thing now. &gt;&gt; But I'm going to tell you, there's safety if you can get yourself in the boat. &gt;&gt; Let's read. Amen. From the scripture. Um God gave this message of it's going to rain to Noah. And he gave him specific instructions of how to prepare for this rain and how to sustain through these flood conditions. And here he tells him, amen. Uh actually, let me go back to verse 13. Uh let's just look at this because we we see some comparisons to where we're living at. Amen. God said unto Noah, "The end of all flesh has come before me, for the earth is filled." Hallelujah. The earth is filled with violence uh uh uh through them. And behold, I will destroy them with the earth. It says, "Make the make make thee an ark of gopherwood. room shalt thou make in uh the ark and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch. That's so the water couldn't get in. He says, "And uh and this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of. The length of the ark shall be 300 cubits, and he says, "The breath of it 50 cubits, and the height of it 30 cubits, a window shalt thou make to to the ark, and and and a cubit shalt thou f finish it above, and the and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof with lower second and third stories shalt thou make it." He says, "And behold, I even I do bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life from under heaven, and everything that is in the earth shall die." This is God's words that are spoken over the earth. He says, "But with thee," Hallelujah. Amen. And will I establish my covenant, and thou shalt come into the ark, thou and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons wives with thee, and of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shall thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee. They shall be male and female, of the fowls after their kind, and and of cattle after their kind, and of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind. dew of of every sort shall come unto thee to keep them alive. He says, "And take thou unto thee of all the food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee, and it shall be for for food for thee and for them." Thus did Noah according to all that God commanded him. So did he. So we see, you know, Moses following the instructions of God and through his obedience, we know the end of the story. Moses, I'm sorry, Noah survived the flood. Not only did Noah survive the flood, but his children survived the flood. Amen. His his his the the the boy's wives, they survived the flood. Of all the people that were on the earth, these were the only ones that survived the flood. Now, now you got to you got to go back, Amen. and and and and just think about this because um you know as as Noah was building this ark uh I I'm sure there were other boats that were built during that time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. I'm sure that you know there was a lot of uh criticism and why would a man build a boat out of gopher wood and and why would he do the things that he's doing? Mo I mean Noah was building according to Amen. a revelation that he received from God. And in spite of how much criticism he went through, how much laughter and how much Amen. how much people made fun of him, Noah kept hammering away until he got that ark established. &gt;&gt; We know the story. It was 120 years Noah preached a sermon to the people. He would come out and say, "Uh, my sermon, my title today is it's going to rain." And uh he would come out next Sunday and preach the same sermon, it's going to rain. And and year after year, it's going to rain. And I can imagine the people in Noah's church &gt;&gt; getting very disappointed with pastor, you ain't got nothing new to preach because you're always preaching by this going say, "I got a new sermon next week. Come in. I got one for you next week. I got a new title." And the title is Get in the B. &gt;&gt; My inspiration is going to rain. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here here Noah finds himself just preaching and finally get to a spot where you know what he had preached had become reality and all the people that saw the animals coming two by two to get on the boat and um they're looking at it. I mean, Noah's not Noah's not doing anything to bring them, but God is sending the animals two by two. And these people seeing maybe animals crossing through their backyards. Why they coming two by two? Why they headed to that boat? They should have known something was going wrong. Something was something was up at that time. But the people because of the hardness of their hearts. &gt;&gt; They they they they couldn't receive Noah's message, if I can put it that they couldn't receive what Noah was saying. Why would God speak something like that to him? who was Noah, right? He was God's chosen man at that time. And here here Noah, amen, has prepared this uh this ark and the animals are coming. And then all of a sudden, while the people are standing outside, they see the door to the ark close. &gt;&gt; And it was God himself that brought closure to this ark. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; They're knocking on the door asking, "Can we come in?" And Noah says, "No, I can't. There's nothing I can do because this thing has been sealed by Almighty God. There's not one thing I can do for you now. That's why I want to tell you, Amen. Why you got ears to hear what the spirit is saying to you? It is time for you to get on the boat. &gt;&gt; Because miracles happen in the boat, sir. &gt;&gt; Not not off the boat, not outside the boat. You got to be in the boat. &gt;&gt; If you want to be protected, you got to be in the boat. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you if you if you want salvation, you got to be in the boat. If you want deliverance, you got to be in the boat. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hey, hallelujah. To the lamb of God. Here we find Noah. Amen. And and and it seems just like an old fairy tale story, but it was reality. People lost their lives because they did not follow the instructions of God. They did not hear the word of God. They did not hear the message of God. They did not respond to it and get themselves on the boat. God had prepared a way for the people, &gt;&gt; but it was up to them to go in the boat. Just like they saw the animals go in, they had the same opportunity to get inside that boat. What are you going to do with the opportunity that God has given you? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Here we see also in this story of Noah, the rain came for 40 days and for 40 nights. And um you know after the rain subsided, Noah decided to send out a a crow. And you know and when he sent out the crow, the crow's responsibility was to go out and and maybe come back and to let Noah know whether whether we can come out there and live now because you know what what's going on, you know, with the earth because we we can't see nothing. All we see is water. Well, uh the crow never came back. And the prophet tells us the reason that crow didn't come back is because the crow actually had a uh a digestive system that would just eat anything. &gt;&gt; And all the dead bodies that were all over the land, that crow was having a smorgas board. &gt;&gt; And and that crow was eating so much say I ain't going back to tell nobody nothing. I'm going I'm going to eat all this dead stuff. But let me tell you something. As believers, we don't eat dead stuff like that. We don't eat that kind of stuff. It does not satisfy our appetite. &gt;&gt; So Noah Noah had to send out a different type of bird. That the second time he sent out a dove and a dove don't eat all that dead stuff like that. &gt;&gt; Dove went and got a a a leaf off of off of a tree and brought it back and said, "You know what? There's life out here on the other side of this ark." Now, the miracle happened. The miracle was that God spared a whole family. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because they got inside &gt;&gt; the boat. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a statement here that I want to read from the sermon, the ark. Here it says, "Don't be scared. God's driving the winds. God's driving the ark. He has all things provided. Why Noah wouldn't have," and I like this. He says, "Why Noah wouldn't have had any victories." Noah would not have had uh wouldn't have have had any victories. Wouldn't have had storms. It wouldn't have been storms and trials if we're just put through a little safe tunnel to run through. There's no joy. So, if we're just kind of put through things, a little safe tunnel, the prophet said there's no joy to our experience. So sometimes you have to go through things in order to experience the joy of the Lord. Now let me tell you something. There's a difference in having the joy of the Lord and having happiness. &gt;&gt; See happiness comes because something happened to you. &gt;&gt; But joy comes regardless of what is happening. Oh, I I remember the old song that the songwriter wrote say, "I still have joy." &gt;&gt; Oh my God. I I still have joy after all the things I've been through. I still have joy. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Joy, joy, joy is something real. &gt;&gt; And you can have it that that you know, like like my God. I mean, God will just give you a little song that'll just kind of carry you through whatever you're going through. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me just finish reading this. I want to mention something here. He says, he says, um, uh, while Noah wouldn't have had any victories, wouldn't have had wouldn't have been storms and trials, if we just put through a little safe tunnel and run through, uh, there's no joy. The storms of life will make us have the the the the storms of life. What makes us have the joy? We never know what daylight was unless we had some dark. &gt;&gt; We never know what a hilltop was unless we had a mountain, right? We we he says we never know what good health was unless you had some sickness. He says you never know how to enjoy salvation unless you was once a sinner. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Right. He says God made all things the law of contrast. He loves you. He loves you. So, don't worry. Don't worry about whatever you're going through. God's God's got everything under control. &gt;&gt; I was looking at Amen. this um uh the the role cuz you know that that first quote that I that I read to you was it says he's the the the uh the pilot of the old ship of Zion. And I was just looking at a man what's what's the role of the captain of the ship? And you know quick Google search AI always comes back with a summarized you know version and sometimes you have to go deeper than the summarized version. Don't just take everything AI said. Remember AI is only gathering what other people have put out there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So you just you don't know what folks have put out there and AI just grabbing from everything. &gt;&gt; So just sometimes go a little deeper than your AI search. But but in this one, you know, the the captain of the ship is responsible for the vessel's safety. The captain of the ship is responsible for the navigation and the well-being of everybody that is on board the ship. Hallelujah. I'm so glad he's my captain. &gt;&gt; The the captain of the ship, Amen, is is also responsible for the well-being of the crew and the passengers. Amen. uh he also has to he has to give command and and crew management and extreme ad administrative duties like handling cargo and navigating routes and ensuring compliance with uh maritime laws and regulations. He says they must be prepared to make critical decisions. It says particularly during emergencies and serve as the primarily with external authorities. This captain has a lot of responsibility and I'm like I said I'm so glad that God is the captain. He's responsible for all of us that are on board. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. I I was I was I was inspired to write say he he's not only God of what's happening in the land. &gt;&gt; He's also God of what happens on the sea. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He's also God in the heavens. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's God of the entire universe. So no matter where you find yourself, he's still God. &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. I was I was listening to a little video this week. Amen. Uh something passed through on my feed there on Facebook and it was a preacher. Amen. Talking about um you know he was on a flight and uh and as he was on this flight this they experienced some tremendous turbulence and you know it was a storm out and and and he was you know all in the middle of the storm. He says but he was just one of those people that didn't really like sitting on a plane and uh having the window shade closed. So he had a pilot sitting next to him. Happened to be on this plane. There was a pilot there. And he say he asked the pilot said, "Could you just open up the the window shade, you know, because I I just don't like sitting here and I just need to see what's happening out there." So he said he said, "Well, open up the window shade." So the man lifted up the window shade and says, "Okay." And as he's looking and he can see lightning here and and and and and a rock here and and just a rumble here and and he like, "Oh my goodness." He said, he said, "Do they see what we see up there at the at the at the in in the pit?" &gt;&gt; He said, "No, no, they don't see it. Not the way you see it." He said, he said, he said, "They trained not to look at it." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said what they trained to do is to look at what the flight plan says. &gt;&gt; He say they trained to also look at, amen, what the what the navigation system is saying. He said, "So they keep their eyes on the flight plan and they keep the eyes on the navigation and they not looking at what you're looking at." He say navigation system told them that they were going to be approaching a storm before they even got to it. And the navigation system shows them how they going to get out of the storm. &gt;&gt; He said, "You only looking at what's out the window, but you got to look at the navigation system." Hallelujah. You only going through the storm. You You're not going to stay in this. You coming out of this somehow. Just stay inside the boat. &gt;&gt; Stay in the boat. Don't get out the boat. Stay in the boat because miracles will happen inside. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Inside the boat. &gt;&gt; Amen. the the governor got this thing under control. He's taking instructions from the captain. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You ain't got to worry about it. &gt;&gt; And you I'm going to try to steal this. No, you don't even know what you're doing. Just &gt;&gt; sit down. And maybe the best thing you should do is lower your shade. &gt;&gt; That way you can't see and get distracted. We get too distracted by what other folks saying and what other folk doing. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I I I got a little something here and I don't know if I I'm going just see it now. You know there's you know before a storm actually happens u the way a storm is is is designed is that one cloud &gt;&gt; connects with another cloud. And then them two clouds connect with another cloud. &gt;&gt; And then them three clouds connect with another cloud. And say when you get all these clouds together, that's when the storm begin to brew. &gt;&gt; And here's what I want to tell you. When you just get one cloud of doubt, don't let that cloud connect with another cloud of doubt. &gt;&gt; Now you got two clouds of doubt. And before you know it, you got another third cloud. And when they all get connected, you have a storm brewing in your life. Hallelujah. And when the storm get to brewing, you thinking about getting off the boat. But I'm here to tell you, don't you get off the boat. You stay in the boat because miracles will happen in the boat. &gt;&gt; Let me look at a scripture here out of Luke 5. miracles happen in the boat and I'm so glad that he's the pilot &gt;&gt; of the ship of Zion. &gt;&gt; There's u this story in Luke 5 and let me just kind of set this up. I'll start reading at uh verse one. But um brother Brandham gives us a description of this in the sermon at thy word. I won't read the quote. Let me see here. It gives us a description of what was going on on this day as we approach Luke 5. What what happened here is um Peter and his his co-workers had come in from a night of fishing and they caught nothing. I mean all night fishing and there was nothing. And I I don't know if they had Garmin systems like we have nowadays to kind of tell you where the fish are. And and I have I've even seen I've been on boats where the garment garment tell me that fish over there and we get there and still you ain't get nothing. &gt;&gt; Peter them they knew the sea. They knew they understood a lot of things about it. And as they're out fishing that night they were this was their their business. They needed they needed fish in order to sell to the market so they could sustain their families. They they need these things. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We need certain things in our business to sustain our families. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But but when you get into a spot where you need now just just remember, don't get out the boat. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God will bring the fish to you if you stay in the boat. &gt;&gt; Amen. So so so Peter. Amen. They're they're they're what happens is that they uh they go through this situation where there's no fish and and and you've gone through a night like this where I I didn't man I didn't catch nothing. I can't I I I was thinking about that bill that I had to pay and I ain't got no I was expecting to get enough money. Amen. Out of selling these fish so I can go pay that bill and I ain't caught nothing. I done wasted all my bait. I done I mean I man this ain't this ain't this ain't going to work at all. I I really needed me something. &gt;&gt; Anybody ever been there? &gt;&gt; But but but but but Peter, so you know, he just happens to dock his boat at a at a particular spot and it just so happened on that day where he docked his boat, Jesus came to that area and he be to preach a sermon. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Oh my, I love this. And and and brother Adam say, "Peter," he said, "You know what? I ain't caught nothing, but you know what? Let me go hear what this guy got to say." &gt;&gt; Let me just see what he going to say. I mean, I I've been hearing a lot about him. So, you know, he church is happening right here. So, why don't just go and just check him out and see what he got to say. Peter's sitting there, but he's sitting there with the wrong attitude in church. Oh, Lord. He's sitting there with an attitude of, you know, let me just see what he going to say. And if he say the wrong thing, I'm up and I'm out of there. &gt;&gt; He had a very discouraged disposition as he was sitting in church, you know, and we're not supposed to come to church that way. We should come to church with expectation, believing God is going to speak to our needs. &gt;&gt; You you you know, in the in the in the in the Old Testament, Amen. And I believe it was Nehemiah, they could not go into the king's presence &gt;&gt; discouraged. &gt;&gt; In the book of Nehemiah, you'll find they could I mean, the king said, "What you doing? I mean, you ain't never been like this. What's going on with you?" And he had to explain what was happening. But you couldn't go into a king's presence discouraged. No matter what you was going through, you still had to come in with a smile on your face. &gt;&gt; What about coming into the house of God? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Like brother brother Westco say, you know, don't don't don't tell us you in the fire. We smell the smoke. &gt;&gt; We see smoke signals going up all around you. &gt;&gt; Don't tell us you're in the fire. We see it. We see it. But I tell you what, you want to get to a spot where no matter what I'm going through, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, oh Lord have mercy. I &gt;&gt; sometimes we got to get to a spot where our best shout &gt;&gt; is not after we done overcome something. &gt;&gt; Our best shout should be in the middle of what we going through. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you got to let the devil know whose side you on. Brother, I can shout whether I have it or not. The reason I shout because I know what I'm looking for is on the way. And I'm praising God before it happens. And I'll praise him after it happens. He going to get two praises. &gt;&gt; But Peter had a very very discouraged Amen. approach as he went into the the service. &gt;&gt; Very discouraged. And let's just kind of pick them up here, you know, in scripture in Luke 5:1. And it came to pass that as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Janoserate, and saw two ships standing by the lake. But the fishermen were gone out of them and were washing their nets. And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down and taught the people out of the ship. Now, you know, the beautiful thing about this is Jesus knew exactly what he was doing. &gt;&gt; He'd already known what Simon's night was like. He already known that the man ain't caught no fish. He already known that was his business. Didn't even know Simon like that. But but but but him being God, &gt;&gt; he knew all things. &gt;&gt; And it was not by accident that he just happened to step up on Peter's boat. &gt;&gt; And then he then he tested him a little bit. He said, "Now just, you know, these people as as I'm preaching, they pushing me further and further into the water and I got to get on a boat and and just get a little separation from the people so they don't even have they don't come out here and try to get in this boat." He said, "But just just push back just a little bit." Now, this is a little test for Peter. Are you going to be obedient to what the man is saying? Have you heard enough in his sermon that you can be obedient? &gt;&gt; It says, he says, "Okay." And he pushes back. Verse four. &gt;&gt; No, I'm sorry. Uh, yeah. Yeah. Thrust out a little from the land, and he sat down and taught the people out of the ship. Verse four. Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, "Launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a drought." That means a a big catch. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A big catch. I mean, you know, now now in order for in order for Simon to get this drought, he going to have to follow the instructions &gt;&gt; clearly. Launch out into the deep. Hallelujah. And get your nets ready for a big I know you just finished getting your nets all prepared. I saw you over there working on the nets and you just and you're so discouraged like you hanging these things up. We'll try to go back out tonight. No, no, no, no. I ain't say tonight. Right now, launch out into the deep &gt;&gt; and get ready for the drought. &gt;&gt; Look at what Peter say. Because Peter there, I'mma say it like this. There's a little bit of all of us &gt;&gt; inside of Peter. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; we can see our own characteristics inside this man. &gt;&gt; You if if you would have been one of the disciples, you would have been Peter. &gt;&gt; Simon answered, answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night. Pretty much we tired. We ain't we done put our put we done put our nets up. No, no, no, no. We was just coming to church just to hear this sermon. Now we going home. No, no, no, no, no. Launch out into the deep and get ready for the trout. &gt;&gt; And Simon answered, said unto him, Master, we have we have toiled all the night and have taken nothing. &gt;&gt; Oh my my my my. Look at this. Look at this. And I can just, you know, you got to pause sometimes when you're reading the scripture because I can see him tell Jesus this and Jesus just looking at him. &gt;&gt; Did you hear what I said, Jesus? We tooured all night and we caught nothing. Didn't say a word to him. So then the next words that come out of Peter's mouth is nevertheless. Oh, good God almighty. Nevertheless, I'mma tell you, God need one of your nevertheless. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I I don't care what you going through this morning. Give God a nevertheless. &gt;&gt; I I'm going to move at what you tell me, Father. If you spoke it in your word, I'mma move out with that. I can't figure it out. I don't understand it, but nevertheless, Amen. &gt;&gt; Look here. &gt;&gt; Peter is about to experience something. But notice now, this experience would not have happened had he been on the shore. &gt;&gt; Peter needed to be &gt;&gt; in the boat &gt;&gt; because miracles happen &gt;&gt; in the boat. &gt;&gt; Look at what he says. I just love it. Nevertheless, at thy word, I will let down the net. Like you're doing God a favor. &gt;&gt; You ain't doing God no favors. When when you come to church, you are not doing God a favor. Amen. &gt;&gt; God doing you a favor &gt;&gt; by speaking to you when you get here. &gt;&gt; But you got to have the right attitude when you're approaching the Lord. If you want to see miracles in your life, you got to have the right attitude. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look at this. It says verse six. And when they had this done, they enclosed a great multitude of fishes and their net break. Went from nothing &gt;&gt; to your nets breaking. &gt;&gt; And and and look at this. It was it was so bad that that the the nets this is what we call overflow. &gt;&gt; When when when the nets were breaking, look at what they had to do. They had to call some neighbors to come and help them with this. When your business get to moving so much, you got to get somebody else to help you with the business. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. This is what overflow looks like. &gt;&gt; It says, "And they and they beckoned unto their partners which were in the other ship that they should come and help them, and they came and filled both the ships. So they so that they began to sink. Typically what would cause a ship to sink is that if water gets into the ship, &gt;&gt; but this was happening because they had an abundance &gt;&gt; of fish. &gt;&gt; I'd like for my bank account to begin to sink. Amen. &gt;&gt; Woo Lord &gt;&gt; because of abundance. &gt;&gt; Not sinking the negative but sinking the positive. &gt;&gt; When Simon saw it, when Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, "Depart from me, for I'm a sinful man, O Lord." for he was astonished and all that were with him at the drought of of the fishes which they had taken. And so is also James and John the son of Zebedee which were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, "Fear not, from henceforth thou shalt catch men." And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all and followed him. One miracle &gt;&gt; caused them to forsake everything and follow him. &gt;&gt; I mean, look, he's concerned. Everything in your life, he is concerned about. And just just just he knew that this was their business. And he blessed them in their business with overflow. &gt;&gt; But it was all a test to see if they would just be obedient. Look, look, look, look. Miracles happen in the boat. In the boat. And I'm I'm sure Peter is happy he had his boat on shore that day &gt;&gt; in order to experience this great miracle. Hallelujah. There was a statement that was made in the sermon um at thy word. I'm going right to paragraph 29 on that sermon at thy word. Just put in the u the quote that I that I told you, but just scroll down to paragraph 29. Uh says this. He says, "I can just see him moving up just a little closer all the time, and the crowds got great. I can hear him get into the boat, thrust out a little from the bank, and look at this. And he borrowed a ship from Simon." After he got through speaking, he said, "Simon, now you launch out into the deep and let down for the drop." And this is a statement I want you to get. Jesus never &gt;&gt; powering But what he will pay you back a hundfold. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus never borrows nothing from you that he will pay you back a hundfold. This is where I invoke my promise. He told me that if I was to be a faithful tithe payer, &gt;&gt; then what he promised me is that when I ran through some stormy seas in my finances that he would rebuke the devour for my sake. Not only did he promise me that, he also said that he would open the windows of heaven and pour me out blessings where I would have room not enough to receive. So, I'm invoking my inheritance on that promise. &gt;&gt; Jesus never borrows nothing from you &gt;&gt; but what he will pay you back a hundfold. &gt;&gt; I thank God for that. Let me move on. We find in the book of Mark chapter 4. Another situation here where our Lord is on the boat. Now, um verse 35 it reads as follows. It says um I'm sorry. Yeah. Yeah. Verse 35. And the same day when the evening was come, he saith unto them, let us pass over unto the other side. And it says, "And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there also with him other little ships." Now remember that the captain of the ship is responsible for all those that are on board. &gt;&gt; It it's his responsibility to take care of them. No matter what the conditions are, the captain has to make sure he takes care of you. Look at this now. It says, "There arose a great storm of wind and the waves beat into the ship so that it was now full. And he was in the hinder part of the ship asleep on a pillow. And they awake him and say unto him, "Master, carest thou not that we perish." And sometime we feel like God ain't going to bring us through this. I don't know how I'm going to get out. Let me tell you something right now. Lower your shade. &gt;&gt; Lower your shade. You looking at the wrong thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you know who on the boat with you? &gt;&gt; And and and can you &gt;&gt; on tell something? When I look at this, there's a couple things I grab. First of all is when we're going through, he want us to act the way he was acting. You know what he did while he was going through? &gt;&gt; Why you up at night? &gt;&gt; Why you walking the floor at night? &gt;&gt; Go to sleep. Amen. &gt;&gt; He He the Bible say he gives his beloved sleep. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You need to recognize who you are in him. No. No. Don't be worried about how this going to get paid and how that's God going to God going to meet the need. &gt;&gt; God going to do it. &gt;&gt; I know. I know. I know he will. I know he will. I've seen him do it. &gt;&gt; It says here, "Carest thou not that we perish?" And he arose and rebuked the wind and said unto the sea, "Peace." See, I like this because Sister Tina told me, she heard somebody say, "When he spoke peace," he was talking to the wind. &gt;&gt; And when he said, "Be still," he was talking to the sea. So both elements had to bow at his voice. &gt;&gt; Peace be still. &gt;&gt; Right? He says, he says, "And and the wind ceased and there was a great calm." &gt;&gt; Now, notice this. Now, all this happened through the spoken word. &gt;&gt; And they would have never heard the spoken word had they not been &gt;&gt; in the boat. &gt;&gt; Look at this. He says, um, and he said, and he said unto them, why are ye so fearful? How is it that you have &gt;&gt; Jesus? It's a storm out here and we dying. We about to die out here. And you say we got no faith. Yeah. I say you got no faith because you looking at the wrong thing. &gt;&gt; You should have been looking at the storm. You should have been looking at who was in the boat with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That you have no faith. And they fear. They feared exceedingly said one to another, "What man of man is this that even the wind and the sea obey him?" Let me just read out of a a sermon here. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. And I want to just kind of catch this one because Jesus did something here that we all need to be able to step into. God's prophet made this statement. He says, um, now Jesus crossing in the boat quickly now, just a few minutes crossing the sea. I can just imagine how that he was. He preached all day and that night a big storm come up in on the sea and and like to sunk the little boat and weary and tired. Look at this now. He was weary. He was tired but never afraid. You might be weary. You might be tired, &gt;&gt; power on, caring, &gt;&gt; weary, tired, but never afraid. He says, I like that. Look at this the statement. He says, Jesus didn't have to go out and fast all day. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about when he was in the middle of a storm. &gt;&gt; Oh, you you know the problem is people try to pray up when they get in the storm. You need to already be prayed up &gt;&gt; before the storm storm come, &gt;&gt; right? He He says Jesus didn't have to go out and fast all day and pray all day. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that? &gt;&gt; The first thing we want to do is as soon as trouble hit us, let's fast. Let's let's pray. No. If you had a rhythm already in your life where you were already fasting, like I I I take Tuesdays, that's my day. That's my fast day. It's a rhythm in my life. So when storms come, I ain't got to go try to fast. I've already been fasting, &gt;&gt; right? I already been fasting. So, so, so, so now watch this statement. Watch this statement that the prophet's going to make because we need to move into this this arena. Watch this. Now, he says, he says, Jesus didn't have to go out and fast all day and pray all day and then say, now I wonder if I got faith enough to do this. He was unconscious of the faith that he had. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's time for us to move to unconscious faith &gt;&gt; that when things happen, we just respond. &gt;&gt; No, not not respond with I'm I'mma fast about it. I'mma pray now. I'mma open my mouth and I'mma speak to this thing. &gt;&gt; Because I know he is greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world. So, I'm going to open my mouth and speak. &gt;&gt; It's unconscious faith. He says any man or woman that ever make a real warriors in the kingdom of God is perfectly unconscious to their faith. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord have mercy. &gt;&gt; He said you keep trying to test your faith. &gt;&gt; When your faith going to pass the test? &gt;&gt; How many years you've been testing your faith? &gt;&gt; No. No. You already know you got it. Now it's time to become unconscious of it and just operate and act in the way God has ordained you to do. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Power on pairing. &gt;&gt; Unconscious faith. That's a sermon already all in itself. Unconcious faith. &gt;&gt; When Jesus was walking on the water, that's unconscious faith, &gt;&gt; right? He not he not worried about whether whether he gonna sink or not. And when when Peter got out the boat, that was unconscious faith. He looking at what Jesus doing said. Now if it if it's if it if it's you &gt;&gt; connected &gt;&gt; if it really be you bid me to come. &gt;&gt; When Jesus said come on come on right here. And Peter get out there walking &gt;&gt; in a storm y'all. This was not what peaceful this was a peaceful conditions. This was in a storm. Peter was walking under water. &gt;&gt; The only reason Peter sunk is that he started looking out the window. &gt;&gt; He was looking out the window. He should have lowered the window shade. and just kept walking. &gt;&gt; Keep your eyes on Jesus &gt;&gt; and keep on walking, Peter. &gt;&gt; But I'm telling you, I I'm just one, the Bible does not say this, but I'm one in my own imagination. When when Peter began to sink and Jesus reached down and picked him up, I do not see Jesus carrying Peter back to that boat. &gt;&gt; If you walked out here, you're going to walk back. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We got to be unconscious of our faith. &gt;&gt; Says, "Wonder if I got enough faith to do this. Have I got faith?" Don't test your faith. God said so. Do it anyhow. God said so. Have you ever tested your faith whether you have enough faith to come uh to the meeting or not tonight? Did you test your faith to see if you had enough faith to to eat your supper tonight? &gt;&gt; Have you test Do you think you have to fast a while and test your faith to see if you got enough faith to drive your car home? It don't make sense, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It's not I mean, you know, you get out there like like like brother Jean told us on last week say if you if you believe in God, Amen. If you you know, you going through something, well, pastor, the reason I can't come to church is because I ain't have no gas money. He said that should never be a Christian's excuse. &gt;&gt; He said, "But it happens." He said, "But it should never be excuse. I ain't got no gas money." He said, "And now when you do get gas money, believe God for the full thing." &gt;&gt; Not just enough gas. Lord, give me enough gas to get to church. &gt;&gt; No, you got to go home from church and you got to go to work next week. Believe God for the whole thing. &gt;&gt; Stop limiting God. &gt;&gt; God, I need overflow. Truth, brother. &gt;&gt; I'm going tell you, God going to give you what you ask for. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm about to say some things. I'm about to say &gt;&gt; God God going to give you what you ask for. you. I I I I I I I I was studying and I have a couple different Bibles that I that I use and I pulled out this old Bible that I had and um and inside this Bible, I had a a check pinned to a scripture. You know, somebody had wrote me a check and they wrote me a check for $40,000. And so I took the check and I pinned it on the scripture. And when I saw it last night, I said, "Lord, I'mma cash this check from this family for $40,000. &gt;&gt; God going to somehow bless this family that this check going to be cash." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, how God do that, that ain't up to me. &gt;&gt; But I'mma just speak it. This check going to be cash. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Right. So I I I I begin to speak life over that family &gt;&gt; that could do that because God gonna have to bless them so they can fulfill that &gt;&gt; because God don't write blank checks &gt;&gt; and God checks don't bounce. &gt;&gt; Hello somebody. Not not the checks that God provide. They don't bounce. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So we have to have unconscious faith. the situations arise. Amen. Let us let's let let us let us operate and act as who we are as sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And he was talking about testing your faith. Y'all, when you all come in, Amen. This this morning, nobody tested the chair &gt;&gt; to see whether they could sit in it. &gt;&gt; Nobody. Nobody. &gt;&gt; Is this thing going to be all right? Everybody just plop right down in the chair. I mean just just sat down and and had it had it not held you &gt;&gt; then that's when you would have had some questions &gt;&gt; but what you actually operated in when you sat in your chair you operated in unconscious faith &gt;&gt; when you go get in your car and and and and crank it. Some of us got the old crank system. My my truck got the old crank system. Some of y'all got the little push button. Hallelujah. Some of y'all can talk to your car and some of y'all started with a app on your phone and all kind of stuff no matter what. &gt;&gt; But you know whatever button you pushing and whatever thing you turning your expectations that when I get there it's going to work. &gt;&gt; That's what we call unconscious faith. &gt;&gt; What am I saying? When I get into a trial, when I get into a situation, when I get into a circumstance, my faith says God is going to work it out. &gt;&gt; Amen. unconsciously. &gt;&gt; And that's I ain't got to stay home from church because I'm going through &gt;&gt; that's when I go to church. &gt;&gt; All right, let me let me move on. Oh, let me let me keep reading this. Let me keep reading this. He says, um, "Do you think you have to fast a while and test your faith to see if you got enough faith to drive your car home?" Certainly not. It's just automatically you believe it. And there's that's the way you believe healing. Believe anything God said. Just don't fight at it and shake at it and rebuke the devil every minute. &gt;&gt; Boy, ain't that something? That That's me. Satan, I rebuke you in the name of J. Stop wasting your time talking to the devil &gt;&gt; and start giving God praise in the midst of it. &gt;&gt; God, I thank you. I I I I had somebody text me and say, "You know what? We made a decision to go into another direction." Say, "Oh Lord, Father, I thank you for all the hours that you've given me. These people may not be a part of those hours that you want me to have in the future." So rather than start complaining, I start thanking God for what he's getting ready to do. &gt;&gt; Oh, every time you lose one, &gt;&gt; we heard brother brother Jose testify that when he lost one customer, then God blessed him with many more. If God did that for him, &gt;&gt; what he want to do for you? &gt;&gt; Oh, get get ready for your blessing. &gt;&gt; But I'mma tell you something. You got to stay in the boat. Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz miracles happen inside the boat. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; All right, let me finish reading this. He says, he says, "That's that's the way uh you believe. Believe anything upset. Just don't fight at it. Shake at it. Rebuke the devil every minute. You just accept it and go on. That's it. There's nothing to be alarmed about. God said so." And and and that settled it. So, we just go ahead. Nothing is knowing is going to happen. It says just forget about it. God said it. That proves it. I believe it. That settles it. That's all you have to do. &gt;&gt; He goes on. It says Jesus laying in the back of the boat and he was asleep and he raised up and still the waters. Now look, he's crossing that stormy sea and when he gets over to the other side, he come all the way across that stormy sea through that dark, dark, dismal, rainy, stormy night when perhaps 10,000 devils of the sea swore they'd drown him. And there he was out there in that little old boat bouncing around like that. Through the night, tired and weary, he come all the way over to Gdara for one purpose. There was one person needed help. That was a maniac of Gera, a crazy man. He come all the way across the stormy sea. It took him all night to help one person. &gt;&gt; Listen to this. He come all the way from glory tonight to manifest himself to heal any person that's in here. That's the loving heart of the Lord Jesus. If you have a need, he'll cross stormy seas because he's the pilot &gt;&gt; of this ship. He'll cross the stormy seas just to get to you, &gt;&gt; just to get to your need. &gt;&gt; That's our God. &gt;&gt; Amen. There was another passage and I want to just read this and then um maybe a couple other things that I want to I want to share. Um let me skip here. Uh Acts 23 and 111. Let's just read that really quick. Acts 23 and 111. And I want to slip back to something if I can. Acts 23:11. The Bible says, "And the night following the Lord stood by him and said, "Be of good cheer, Paul, for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome." Now when we look at this um God gives Paul a promise here in Acts 23 and visits him uh supernaturally and tells him this thing that you know you're going to bear witness of me at Rome. But what God didn't do is tell Paul everything he was going to have to go through &gt;&gt; before he got to Rome. &gt;&gt; So this is what God does. Sometimes he gives you a promise, but he does not let you know all the things you have to go through before that promise is manifested in your life. But you have to be determined to hold to what God spoke to you. &gt;&gt; When when when the trouble come, don't jump out the boat. &gt;&gt; Stay in the boat. One of the things happened in Acts 24, Paul was taken to uh uh Felix. Uh, and before he was taken to Felix, there was there was the Bible told us that there was a a bunch of Jews, several Jews had banded together and say they were going to kill Paul. They were going to kill him. Now, I don't care what they banding together to do. If God say you're going to Rome, they can't kill you until after you get to Rome. &gt;&gt; So, so if you're not in Rome and they threaten to kill you, nuh-uh. When God say you going to Rome, you going to Rome. Forget about what everybody else is saying. &gt;&gt; Right? So, here here Paul is told this and and and this these Jews band together, man, we're going to kill this man. And they doing they coming up with all kind of schemes to try to kill Paul. Acts 24, he was taken to Felix who who prolonged his judgment. The man was supposed to be judged. But Felix prolonged Paul's judgment for two years. Two years he stuck there. Amen. But again, Paul ain't in Rome. So I don't care how long he stay is going. He got just like he had he said just like you you bore witness of me here in Jerusalem. And I don't care how long he get kept in Jerusalem. He's got to get to Rome somehow &gt;&gt; cuz the Lord told him he's going. He kept him there for two years hoping that Paul would try to give him money to buy his freedom. In Acts 25, uh Paul stood before Fesus who had replaced Felix and he had he appealed to stand before Caesar because his the prophecy said that he was to bear witness also in Rome. Listen, he stood before King of King of Gri and began to give his personal testimony of his conversion. And uh and and I like this because when Paul stood before Grippa, he never did expound upon mysteries of the scripture. What he did was just begin to tell amen a gripper how he became a Christian. And sometimes that's all we need to do is share with people our personal testimony how we became a Christian. You ain't got to tell them about the message just yet. Tell them how you became a Christian. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says he almost persuaded a gripper to become a Christian in Acts 26 and 28. But in Acts 27, we see something that happens here. Praise the Lord. In Acts 27, the Bible says that he set sail for Rome. But as they were on their way to Rome, this is years later after God has given them this promise. As they're on their way to Rome, they get caught in a storm. They're sailing on a boat. They're sailing on a ship. They get caught in a storm called Euroclaidon. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And Paul had already told these men, you know, in in Acts 27, he says, "I don't think we should be going out selling right now." He says, "Because uh, you know, I I feel like this is going to be a very dangerous time, and we shouldn't we shouldn't set sail." But but somehow the captain of the ship told him, "No, he told he told he told the uh the the centurion that was watching over." He said, "No, we need to go ahead and set sail. We need to do it right now." Well, the centurion I mean the the the captain I mean the centurion believe the captain rather than believe in Paul. Hallelujah. Now what happens here is that they get out there and they get they went out in smooth sailing seas and before you know it a storm was on them and the storm got so bad they had to take all the stuff out the ship and try to get it light stuck out there for 14 days. But Paul, while he was in that condition, the angel Lord came and told him, he says, "You know what? Um, everybody that's on this boat going to be spared because of you." He said, "I'm giving you everybody on this boat." So, so what happened to some of the some of the some of the people, he said, but but here's the thing. In order to be spared, oh my. &gt;&gt; In order to be spared, they had to be willing to stay in the boat. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And and and what happened was that, you know, as they were lightening the ship, they saw some they had some other little life rafts and they said, "We going to jump off and get in the life raft." He said, "No, no, no, no. What he told me is that if you want to be spared, you got to stay in the boat." So So the centurion say, "Well, cut the life rafts away." Oh my god. every here they're all they're the the safety is gone &gt;&gt; and all them just watching to go say no no no I'm telling you I had told y'all that we weren't supposed to come out here now I'm telling you now that if you want salvation &gt;&gt; if you want protection &gt;&gt; if you want your life amen to to be spared you better stay inside this boat &gt;&gt; Paul got them all stay in the boat and he began to encourage them and try to get them to eat something. All this said, "Don't worry. God said we" And they didn't realize the reason that all this was happening because Paul was supposed to go to Rome. And since y'all just so happen to be with me, &gt;&gt; y'all going to be spared. &gt;&gt; Well, they got to a spot where they drove that ship into a little spot where it just caused the whole ship just to fall apart. And there was a some land ahead. And uh and and and Paul said, "Now tell tell the tell the the the the passengers and Amen. the prisoners, tell them that those that can swim, go ahead and swim up to to shore." And and then here's the thing. If you can swim, you you're not going to drown. I promise you that because God already told me everybody that was on this boat was going to make it. Now, if you can't swim, Paul gave them some instructions. He say, "Just grab a piece of a piece of the boat. &gt;&gt; Anything you see floating by. &gt;&gt; Just grab a piece of that &gt;&gt; and just begin to move on up towards the shore with your broken piece. &gt;&gt; You know, brother brother Wesco first sermon that he ever preached. &gt;&gt; He went to the pull pit. He said, "You can make it on broken pieces." &gt;&gt; And I'm here to tell you, you can still make it on broken pieces. I don't care what is going on in your life. You can still make it on broken pieces. &gt;&gt; Amen, &gt;&gt; man. They got themselves up there to that shore and every last one of them was accounted for. God had spared all of them because Paul was on his way to Rome. But you know what? Even though they got to safety, Paul was still going through trials. out of all the people on the on the island. Paul is there with a fire and just trying to get warm. I'm wet and I'm just trying to get warmed and all this and all of a sudden while he's sticking a a a maybe sticking a a stick or something towards the fire, a snake comes out and bites him. &gt;&gt; But you know why Paul could just &gt;&gt; Do you want to know why he could do that? &gt;&gt; He wasn't in wrong. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was in Rome yet. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, when God has given you a promise, &gt;&gt; you can shake off some of the things that the devil is trying to attack you with because you're not where God told you that you would be. &gt;&gt; I wrote this. You're still in the perfect will of God even when you are enduring your role. All you got to do is just be patient. &gt;&gt; Wait on God. He's going to bring you through. &gt;&gt; I want to go back to the first quote that I read and I'll bring this to a close. Why Christ speak? It says, "Now today we're expecting a great time in the Lord." And I had two or three different texts here that I was looking at and I didn't I couldn't figure out just which one I would talk on this morning. One of them was Cashia cares on him for he cares for you and if he cares why not you. So then another one Billy Paul says my other son Joseph brought me this text a long time ago. He was sitting in the room one day and he said looking up towards the picture, Joseph is very fond of boats like little boys, boats and horses, you know, and he said to me, "Daddy, has Jesus got a boat?" So then after he got up and went out, I happened to think, "Has he got a boat?" And I took a text from that, just marked it down here on my book. Has Jesus got a boat? I happen to think while when he was on earth, he had to borrow a womb to be born in, a grave to be buried in, a boat to preach from, but he is the pilot of the old ship of Zion. &gt;&gt; You know, I read that some time ago or heard that on the tape listening to why Christ speaking. kind of inspired me and I while I was in prayer a few years ago in church this whole sermon of miracles happened in the boat came to me while I was in prayer but just didn't get a chance to preach it until now but as I was looking amen at these notes again last night and I underlined under had took an underline to that part he's the pilot of the old ship of Zion and um I was just trying to figure out where where did this term come from this old ship of Zion? And there are a number of songwriters out there that have written songs about the the old ship of Zion. But uh from my understanding, Amen. It was this old ship of Zion was birthed from um the slaves coming across, Amen. the Atlantic Ocean, the come from Africa to become slaves here in in the US. And not just the US, but you know, we know that there's a triangle. Amen. And slaves ended up in some of the uh some of the islands, you know. I mean, we we we we they all over these all over the islands. So, it's not just the US that that was involved in in the slave trade, but it was many of the islands that also, you know, that got impacted by this, you know. But but here you know um the what would happen is that the somehow they said the some of the the slaves came up with this song uh t the old ship of Zion. They say t the old ship of Zion. T the old ship of Zion. Get on board. Get on board. And they asked a question in in in the verse of the song because see they didn't have they didn't have um the way we write verses and things like that. The songs they just had they just had just a few words that they put together and uh and that was the whole song. Right. T the old ship of Zion. T the old ship of Zion. T the old ship of Zion. Get on board. Get on board. Do you think she will be able? They're saying, "Do you think the B the boat going to make it? Do you think she will be able? Do you think she will be able? Get on board. Get on board." They encouraging. It's going to make it. This boat gonna make it. &gt;&gt; And they say it has landed many thousands. It had landed many a thousand. It has landed many a thousand. So get on board. Get on board. And what they're saying is that not only did they make it to their destination, but one day this ship of Zion going to take us to heaven. &gt;&gt; But in order to get to heaven, we going to have to stay in the boat. &gt;&gt; Amen. Ain't no danger in the water. &gt;&gt; They say ain't no danger in the water. Ain't no danger in the waters. Get on board. Get on board. &gt;&gt; Then they had this one verse said, "King Jesus is the captain." &gt;&gt; King Jesus is the captain. King Jesus is the captain. So get on board. Lord, get on board. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; he's the pilot &gt;&gt; of the old ship of Zion. &gt;&gt; And as long as Jesus is controlling where we're going, &gt;&gt; we ain't got nothing to worry about. &gt;&gt; Church, don't get at it. &gt;&gt; Get in the boat because miracles happen. in the boat. &gt;&gt; God bless your church. &gt;&gt; Let the musicians come. Let us have a word of prayer. &gt;&gt; Father, we're grateful for your word. We're grateful for your strength that comes to us through the word. to encourage us, to help us, Father. No matter what it is that we're going through, we can we can rest because we know that you have everything under control. As believers, sometimes don't let the storms of life get us to a spot where we're thinking, "Oh, we got to jump off. We got to get out. We don't know if this thing is going down or not." But help us to trust, God. You you have everything under control. Everything, Lord. You You have already navigated this storm. You knew it was coming. You also know that we're going to make it through. So Lord, help us to trust you. You're the pilot. You're the captain and you're responsible for all of us, oh God. So Father, I just pray that Amen. and we would take courage in the word and that we would begin to operate in unconscious faith knowing that what you have spoken it shall come to pass. Every promise that you've given is yes and amen and not one word you spoke will fall to the ground and return void. Father, we're careful to give you all the praise even in the midst of everything we're going through. As David said, I will bless the Lord at all times. His praise shall continually be in my mouth. That's We're not going to sit here and rebuke the devil all the time. We're just going to give you praise because we know you got everything under control. Songwriter say, "You got the whole world in your hands. You got the little bitty baby in your hands. You got me and you, brother, in your hands. You got the whole world in your hands.
