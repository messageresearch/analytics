Solomon still recuperating a man we pray God will just continue to strengthen him and and just bring healing to his body amen and but while he's recuperating I just figured I'd jump in and help out where I couldn't praise the Lord so it's not a one-man band or one-man show but it's just getting in where you fit in amen amen and you know eventually what the goal is as you can see I like to have replication just about every area here in our ministry and so we're gonna be replicating on this song leader not you know what I would I what I I realized some time ago that when God called me to ministry they never took the singing away from me hey man when God called David a man to become king he was still a shepherd right he still understand you know the Easter understood these things he was still a musician he was still all those things so the God don't take away he just add you know get that you don't take from me does he just add to you a man and so you know I just I'm just happy about serving the Lord I'm gonna tell you if I could play an instrument y'all see me playing y'all see me all over the church I'll be singing be preaching I'll be playing wild brother Jack just sit down I can't he done so much to me I can't do enough for him I take a get tied and play a guitar be on the drums beating I did anything I can do for Jesus my God if I could run for Jesus I'd run if I could jump for Jesus I would jump he's just been that good to me y'all I'm sorry hey man i'ma tell you when you when you fall in love with him like that ain't no you can't you came to enough for the Lord he can't do enough for the Lord so we just we just thank God for all things but we we appreciate the Lord amen on this day and I won't prolong the time we have a little faultless in our in our hearts but I do want to say I so appreciate it brother Troy stuff from last week a man the pride of life just a wonderful wonderful wonderful thought and really really good anointing that was in here a man and just you know just sitting back and looking coming through the first month of the year and just seeing what the Lord has done and just to help that he sin and not just help the salat help a man silent help and we could depend on it you know thank God for him thank God brother quick coup and you know we're getting both Jerry also he'd be you know somewhere down here be coming through and doing some things too speaking of that I had him I gotta be careful how to sister you know they come out like Martin Luther King and I want to sound like that but uh but the Lord had given me a dream man recently I was I was I was and I don't dream that's just not me I'm a very hard sleeper my wife will tell you faith can be happening all around did you hear that accident no you know there was shooting nights I didn't hear it I was I was knocked out and we learned through the message you know brother branham told us that you know people that sleep that way typically God don't deal with them in dreams right and so when I when anytime I have a little dream I always take it seriously you know and so you know we had a had a the Lord just kind of told me about having a a sunrise service for Easter and so we usually come for prayer for the first for service but we'll have a sunrise service on Easter a man and and so the Lord that put that in my in the dream about having the sunrise service and he told me who was supposed to speak so I said okay Lord I'm gonna be obedient so with that we already know we're gonna have a good Friday service y'all know that you know we gonna be here on Good Friday right and so I just I said well was the Lord put in my heart you know we are he had to put in my heart Good Friday that that was already there you know what I'm saying Easter was already there you'll have to be you'll need a dream back going to church on Easter you know need a dream by that you'll need a dream by Good Friday you'll need a dream by about Easter but you know the Lord Lord put in my spirit a sunrise service and I say you know what we're gonna do we'll add a Saturday service for that - we have a Friday Saturday Sunday sunrise and Sunday morning service at Easter time you know we're gonna be doing coming right out of our fast going into for services like that and we're not inviting anybody we got help right hand the church so we're gonna use the help that we got we're gonna have full services just like that coming out of a fast I want y'all expectations up god want to do something for us Amen God wanna do something so I'm letting that let everybody know about that so that'll be coming and man at Easter time we'll be announcing about the fast as we get there but it'll be 21 days before Easter we'll probably in the fast either just the day before Good Friday there will be the goal to in the fast the day before Good Friday so we'll go right into Easter a man just after 21-day fast and and that fast could be you know just a number of things we don't we know we don't limit it you know but typically what I do is what they call the Daniel Fast I still eat but I just eat certain things there others might say why well I will I'll eat whatever I want to eat but I won't eat until three o'clock you know something like that of us you know and I think we're along with facets of food let me put it that way along with did y'all hear me along with fast and some foods we oughta fast some technology right along with fast and some food alright y'all got it if someone's just fast technology I'm faster come on the Saints of old would it be like that's all come on y'all give up some food give up a couple plates a man or change your diet or do something amen but but I will give you more information but that'll that'll be happening that's a corporate a church why fast that will be doing they're starting in the month of April it coming out of March going into April will be starting that fast so everybody be aware and everybody be ready everybody be prepared for that is that Alright okay all right so I want to read two scriptures this morning and one from Romans 12 and the other from first Corinthians 15 and we will just present our thought here to you today Romans 12 everybody standing that can't stand Romans 12 says this I this seeks you therefore by the mercies of God that ye present your bodies you know that's the least you can do is give God your body present your bodies a living sacrifice notice this not only present your body holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service reasonable that's give God your body a man it says and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God a man perfect will of God all right so let's turn over here to first Corinthians 15 mmm first Corinthians 15 and I'm reading from verse 50 amen and this says now this I say brethren that flesh and blood can not inherit the kingdom of God neither doth corruption inherit incorruption behold I show you a mystery we shall not all we shall not all sleep that maybe not all gonna die a man a man this script try to be more precious in today than any other time we're living in a time and a day somebody not gonna die to go to heaven amen praise God somebody's gonna get in through different means than death alright but I'll show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed right in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory Oh death where is thy sting o grave where is thy victory the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ therefore my beloved brethren be ye stedfast unmoveable amen don't let the devil get your sidetrack Amen unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord Amen let's have a word of Prayer over the scripture father we thank you for the opportunity to read the word of the Lord but we know takes the Holy Spirit to bring clarity to the things that we read speak to our hearts Lord through your word today may encourage us and strengthen us and help us in our journey it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you can be seated praise the Lord so we want to take for our title today we shall be changed a man we shall be changed that's not just a song that is a promise according to the scripture and I am certainly looking forward to it by the grace of God I want to take us back we came out of us the subject on talking about those three realms and you know the three realms that God deals with people in the humanistic realm the rim of visions or sometimes dreams because a dream correctly interpreted is a vision and also brother Ram said thus saith the Lord God uses those those three realms in order to speak to his people amen so I'm pulling from the sermon is this the sign of the answer and I just want to read a couple things a man from that out of it is this a sign of the answer so stay stay with me here it makes it says could you just scroll up just one paragraph there oh me just just take it up one day you go 2:43 all right it says so now let's note a few of these mysteries and if you want to write them down first I'll take what Scofield says here now he's using Scofield he's referring to matthew chapter 13 it says if you like to type some of them down if you haven't got a Scofield Bible you might read what he thinks some of the mysteries are now in the eleventh verse now this is Scofield notes brother branham has actually given you Scofield notes okay and it says and now he uses the language these are some of the things he thinks this is what school thinks if you got a Scofield Bible you can just go look look right down at the bottom of it and these are some of the notes that'll be there so I went through mine on last night just looking at all the little notes then and the scriptures and everything that Scofield was referring to but look at this he says number one the mystery of the kingdom of heaven that Scofield these are mysteries that got to come let me um oh no no no I skipped something he says now now in eleventh verse and he answered a set of them he's reading Matthew thirty 11 and he answered and said to them because it's given to you his disciples because it's given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but not to them but to them is not given now Scofield say that there are mysteries that the disciples are not just my I should say the current day disciples wouldn't know that the others would not know Oh stay with me there's mysteries that you wouldn't know that the others would not know there's a mystery that Abraham knew that Locke did not know you understand what I'm saying amen there's mysteries that you will know that others will not know it goes on he said and then he gave a this a scope is definition of a mystery the mystery here oh my the mysteries here is the mystery a mystery is Scripture a previously hidden truth now divinely reveal but which is a supernatural element still remains despite the revelation I like that hallelujah because as we go through some of these mysteries right what we see is as you know Scofield say this is coming well the grandmum picks up what Scofield say this is coming and he can say this is it hallelujah somebody a man and not only this is it but a supernatural for those that differ with what he said a supernatural element was there to prove that what he said was right so the supernatural skull said the supernatural element remains despite the revelation Oh glory to God amen stay with me here because that you know we watching that Scofield was looking for he didn't see it in his day but he left this you know in the Scofield Bible he left this there he says says the greater mysteries and the great mysteries are number one the mystery of the kingdom of heaven that's the one we're talking on now third Matthew 13 verse 3 250 all right and now he says now the second mystery the mystery of Israel's blindness during this eight line he's a Scofield notes Romans 11:25 with the context third mystery is the mystery of the translation of the living Saints at the end time of this apes first Corinthians 15 and also Thessalonians 4:14 2:17 now that's the one I want to focus on the day a man when I say we shall be changed that's the one we're focusing on because Scofield said we need to understand that mystery how does change gonna happen because the Bible say we shall be changed well how is this change supposed to take place don't you want to understand the mysteries alright let's go on a little further say the fourth mystery of the New Testament church as one body composed of both Jews and Gentiles Ephesians 3 1 to 11 Romans 16:25 and also Ephesians 619 Colossians 4 3 you go through Scofield notes he got all these things written down there the fifth mysteries of the church as the Bride of Christ Ephesians 5:28 232 amen 6 mysteries of the Living Christ same yesterday today and forever Galatians 2:20 and and now now brother Branham slipped in there Hebrews 13:8 amen it says in many places like that because of Scofield notes where he said of the six mystery was the in living Christ but brother Branham said it was a mystery of the living Christ not just in living Christ but the living Christ in his TUC Hebrews 13 and eight they're showing that Jesus Christ was the same yesterday today and forever let's go a little further say the seventh mystery is of God even Christ as the incarnate fullness of the godhead embody and who all divine wisdom he said Colossians 2 and 9 first Corinthians 2:7 amen and then he says in godliness restored to man now and then he goes on says ninth mystery is the mystery of iniquity found in 2nd Thessalonians and throat so forth now when I look that you know I had to go back to the notes and I missed it oh my I missed it because he said the seventh mystery was a man a mystery of God even as Christ as it in currently fullness of the godhead in body and then he went on saying whom all divine wisdom and godliness is restored to man well if we didn't if we if we didn't go back and check the notes we didn't realize that really that eighth mystery was godliness being restored to man because when I looked at the notes of Scofield it said the eighth mystery of the mystery of the process in which God likeness is restored to men stay with me here just for a minute Scofield says a man number eight was the mystery of the process in which God likeness is restored to man now I when I looked at I said now Oh III see where that was fulfilled it's no longer a mystery because brother Branham come along and preached statue of a perfect man hallelujah and God likeness how we can become like God was restored to me add to your faith virtue into your virtue knowledge into your knowledge temperance to your temperance patience to your patience godless to your godless brotherly kindness and then be capped off with charity the love of God we understood by revelation how godlike this was restored to man catch all of this now the brother brother probably not just kind of throwing things out there I mean like I said he says these were Scofield notes but he can say he can stand there in the pulpit pretty much and say this day this is fulfilled this rep these revelations have already come forth to the church or let me go on a little further and Manny says the ninth mystery is the mystery of iniquity found in 2nd Thessalonians and so forth the tenth mystery is of the seven stars of Revelation 1:29 Scofield was for a revelation of that my brother Brandon revealed it in the church ages is that right we've just been through that the seven stars or the seven churches the seven messages and so forth and 11th mystery is the Mystery Babylon the prostitute revelation 17:5 2:7 let me go on in this quote he says thus that's that some of the mysteries see that's what Scofield had that's all you can see that some of the mysteries that this angels supposed to wind up all the mystery all the mysteries of God revelation 2:7 all the missiles of God on the other may I say this with reverence not referring to myself but referring to the angel of God he says another mystery the serpent seed that's been a hidden mystery all through the years and I'll tell you what it's you know on Wednesday night we got the touching on that a little bit and you know and and and my friend was here and she like she never heard anything like that you know and I never heard it either till I heard God's prophet I didn't know what happened in the Garden of Eden till I heard God's prophet and no matter how much you might think that that revelation has got to be wrong there's a supernatural element that remains despite the revelations hallelujah and if God vindicated that be true i'ma go with what God said amen hallelujah I ain't think I've indicated nobody let's talk about an apple on apricot went went went but when he told us a man that a man it was a adultery that happened in the Garden of Eden God vindicated that and got testifies of his gifts all right let's go on a little further he said he said the Serpent's eat that's been a hidden mystery all through the years say the grace straighten out not disgrace oh I can't hack it again because you know you got people out there taught radical grace that don't mean you can live any kind of life you want to live and thank God gonna love you in half amen hallelujah amen you wouldn't even want to be in a relationship where love only went one way if you had a wife or a husband that was you the only one giving out love you and you would see this is a this is a terrible relationship if you give love you want to receive love and if God gave love he wants to receive love and the least you can give God you can present your body a living sacrifice that's so reasonable service live holy talk holy walk only so God you love him [Music] we talk about grace real grace hey man come on somebody alright I'm going on look for not disgrace a man true grace life people living nowadays it's this grace it's sure you don't even appreciate the grace of God all right a man we talk about true grace a man a man a man he didn't he didn't go to the cross so I can just live any kind of way I want to live amen hallelujah amen he went to change some things on the inside of me glory to God I can't I can't let me put it this way I can't live holy enough I can't live holy enough I feel like I need more holiness and I don't do that because somebody make me do it I do it because I realized how good he's been to me I don't mind dressing like this I don't mind looking like this hey man you probably Lou you playing the president wife ashamed to be in the president wife no not a shame not a shame and you think she gonna let the plane sit on the runway so if he were just to look at it no she gonna use it and she not gonna apologize for using it either come on somebody if you was in her position you do the same thing and then I'm not ashamed to be married to Jesus Christ I'm not ashamed to be identified with him my husband owns the world the earth is the Lord's and the food is tell the world and they that dwell therein I'm not ashamed to be identified with him come on somebody man see when you when you connect it to royalty you have to act like royalty you got to dress like royalty come on somebody a man your husband is not a pimp so don't dress like a prostitute never sane again your husband is not a pimp so don't dress like a prostitute you ain't got none to sell take the signs [Applause] praise the name of the Lord I'll talk about real Greeks not don't make grace at this place real priests all right help me Lord Jesus they marry Manny Manny man amen glory to God hallelujah no such thing as an eternal burning hell you'll burn for millions of years but anything that was eternal never had a beginning or in hell was created all these mysteries the mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and look at this one the baptism Holy Ghost without sensation so you can actually get the Holy Ghost without crying you can get the Holy Ghost without snot you can get the Holy Ghost without jumping you can get to go Holy Ghost without running but you can't get the Holy Ghost without seeing a change in your life we're gonna see a different senior come on somebody so we're not trying to make everybody jump and shout and speak in tongues but we want to see that difference in your life Oh hallelujah it said it missed it about - no egos without sensation but the person of Christ perform it in you the same works that he did the mystery of the water baptism where the stream trinitarianism has brought it into titles of Father Son and Holy Ghost and the mystery of the guy had been fulfilled in the baptism of the name of Jesus Christ according to the Book of Revelations that the church and this time was to receive there is some of the mysteries the pillar of fire returning back amen that's the thing that's supposed to take place and we see it oh how we could go on naming the mysteries I thank God for that I just wanna this is my starting point here and and I already see that the way that this is going I'm probably not going to finish but that's ok we as long as we're here we got time a man as long as we're here we have time but the Bible says I beseech you therefore right brethren by the mercies of God this is Romans 12 verse 1 I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy not sexy holy acceptable unto who because brother Troy told us a lot of stuff we do is for men we're not doing it for God but when we're doing it for God is holy acceptable unto God which look at this and this the least you can do which is your reasonable service dressing right is the least you can do oh my god all right Amen it's the least you can do a man a Manny Manny Manny Manny I'm gonna just have to say it cuz it's the way it came before you even give God your money give him your body before you give me money give me your body it's your reasonable service all right and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove that or what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God now we look at this word conformed Amen it means to be made like as believers are to be conformed to the holy character of Christ amen and not to the corrupt ways or the principles of the world don't be don't be conformed to the ways of the world but be conformed to the holy character of Christ now when we when we look at that just turn back just a couple verses a man when we are just kind of get a what this word conformed is a descriptor Romans eight let's just look at it from that angle hallelujah conformed is to be made like s believers to a man be conformed to the holy character Christ not to the corrupt ways or principles of the world now let's look at this a man to back it up with script to Romans 8 let's start at verse 28 glory to God one of our favorite passages a man every Christian loves Romans 8:28 hallelujah Amen if you don't don't go down went through some trials and some struggles and tribute tribulations this is one you should be able to go back to it's when you commit to memory a man and we know that all things a man work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate and look at this to be conformed so you were predestinated be conformed to be conformed to the image of his son you predestinate it to look like Christ amen you not predestinate it to look like the world but God predestinated you to look like Christ to act like Christ to talk like Christ to walk like Christ listen amen for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brothers moreover whom he did predestinate then he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified you know that thing justified when we look at that it means just as if I never did it so when God looks at me you don't look at my mistakes because when he look at me he looked at he look at my sins confessed underneath his blood hallelujah thank God for that so we protest innate it amen to be conformed to the image of the son to be made like believers I conform ain't meant to be conformed to the holy character of Christ not to the corrupt ways of this world but conformed to the holy character of Christ now let's look read a quote here Amen the Prophet makes this the statement out of the message power of transformation Amen power transformation I'm starting at paragraph 37 a man who says in Romans are there for me a chapter I want to take a few verses in about the first two or three verses two verses I think he says I think it is and read and then this try to explain it the best that I know how by the help of the Holy Spirit Romans a twelfth chapter I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service I thought that was so beautiful for this group this morning what you what you done did now and now and is a conjunction as I understand and be not conformed to this world and Beach but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God that's what we all want to do is be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your minds to do the perfect and acceptable will of God now that we have now that we have been saved as we are and that we have been filled with the Holy Ghost as we have now we want the mind that was in Christ to be in us that we might be transformed from the natural things of life and be brought in to do the perfect will of God by transformation now let notice what he just say we need to be transformed from the natural things of life and be brought in to do the perfect will of God by transformation of God's Spirit by his word now there's a lot that he said in just that one sentence and we'll go deeper in this as we get there he said but we won't be transformed from the natural things in life you know you know sometimes the stuff that we go through this is what brother Branham say as sons of God we get our pipes clogged up with natural things hey man we're just were just so so concerned about natural things you know we're concerned about making so much money but but when you when you get there there's still there's stuff you have to spin it on and then you devil keep you and a Pharisee in a wheel did you a hamster in a wheel you just kind of keep chasing stuff that really ain't there right it got its God I don't have a problem with you having money if your means was there you understand God won't have a problem of that but but don't put that ahead of God Amen Church don't put ahead of God God will supply your needs God will bless you both Amen what you can even imagine a thing but but but don't put anything ahead of God don't chase money and put God on the side don't do that that did not not not now you don't make money your God he understand let me go a little further here he say say we might be transformed from the natural things of life amen and brought in to do the perfect will of God by transformation God's Spirit buys where the transformation takes place by God's Spirit by his word God's Spirit by His Word now let's keep going I want to read another another statement here oh my out of the true Easter seal glory to God by his Spirit the transformation takes place by God's Spirit by his word God's Spirit by his word we shall be changed now say what's the next thing the transformation of his of this body to meet the son that's coming will be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye have all your paper seals you want to but the real seal of East is the Holy Ghost in the human heart do you accept it do you believe in this resurrection do you believe he's alive forevermore you believe that he's here do you now accept him as your Savior as your healer as your God as your coming king believe it with all your heart so the next thing that we're looking for is actually the change of this body now so the mystery is how is this body gonna be changed amen we're under expectation that this body will be changed but how will that occur now brother Branham gave us the answer and I want to read it here out of God's power to transform stay with me here glory to God a man we have to Saudi sees them you'll know what you're looking for glory to God it says now what is the transformation quickly how do we get it what does that what does the transformation get this now right what is the traffic transformation how do we get it and what does the transformation he says God does it by the spirit of his word so if we are caught up in natural things and we put in the word to decide how you gonna be changed come on somebody Amen that the only way you're gonna get changed is it's got to come by the spirit of the word Oh hallelujah and people don't want you to get in the word no more hallelujah hey man I'll listen to the tape at home but you ain't so come on the church and listen the wine because the way you're gonna get this change is through the spirit that's coming off the word oh we ain't there yet glory to God and let me tell you something if in your natural being you ate one time per week y'all gonna preach with me if you only ate one time a week try this in your with your natural body tell your natural man I'm only gonna feed you won't Sunday tell your natural man that your natural man will start talking to you Monday come around he start to talk hallelujah somebody you being you be in public places just kind of meeting people for the first time and never saw everyone everyone smile your stomach begin to talk turn hello somebody you don't had it happen to you your natural man began to talk you gonna have to feed me and if you can fit in and you respond to that natural man hallelujah you're pulling Tomek dollars so fast a drive-through so fast to get that natural man some food hallelujah somebody how you expect your spirit man to thrive and survive if you only feed him one time a week sometimes [Applause] your spirit man is dying he need to be fade can't you hit a spirit man making noise respond and feed that spirit man the world of talk the transformation occurs God does it by by the spirit of his word he transforms well I'm gonna keep on reading but I bring it home and help you help you see what he's saying there amen God does it by the spirit of his word he transforms he plants his seat and the word is a seat right and you know how you gonna hear unless a preacher preach right he plants his seat throws his spirit on it so the word itself is a sea and then he throws the spirit on it which is the water Tennessee everything happens by the spirit listen he plans his he throws his spirit on it and it brings forth the product his holy spirit transforms a C word into a and to be the vindicated of its kind I'm gonna just keep reading this quote and then we'll hit something solid or it'll sink in it does about a spirit of his word it says what kind of seat you are that shows what's in you you can't hide it whenever you are inside it shows outside you just can't keep from it you can't make the tree anything but what it is see it's going to be that way the Holy Spirit transforms the sees that's on the inside of it no matter what kind of seed it is it'll transform into transforming if it's evil it'll bring forth evil if it's a hypocrite it'll bring forth the hypocrite if it's a genuine Word of God and I bring forth the genuine son or daughter of God though I'm thinking that through a thinking man's filter when the seat comes up it comes through that it dueces a son and a daughter of God now let me let me just kind of work with this for a little bit you know because the transformation happens and what the transfer transformation is just sort of you know a transformation is a change in character a change in the mind of a Christian they said say the minds of Christians are transformed by reading by the renewing influence of divine grace the minds of Christians are transformed by the renewing influence of divine grace qualifying them to obey and glorify God all right now look at this when we look at something you know we're gonna turn back to a quick script - here you have the very first of the Bible Genesis 1 let's just look at this glory to God remember now God does this how does it how does the what is the transformation how do we get it what what does it God does it by the Spirit of his word now I want you to look at this in Genesis work and when we look at this think about yourself think about yourself a man look at this it says in Genesis 1 in the beginning God created the heavens the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void that's you because you come from the earth right the earth was without form and void you had no direction right right you you were lost yet he's trying to find you wait until you came in contact with Christ right say the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep now notice this before let there be light I want you to catch this now before God spoke let there be light what happened to the earth he says and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters Holly Lou waters represent people's right and what we need this is why we're crying out for we need the Spirit of God to come upon it the Bible says G said my words are spirit and life hallelujah amen he say saying I'm not God God moved upon the face of the waters now after the spirit move then verse 3 God said let there be light and there was light but the light did not come until the spirit move first Oh hallelujah [Music] you won't be able to walk in true revelation understanding to the spirit come you understand you will never be able to catch it something we're trying to catch this thing intellectually we will miss it the only way you're gonna understand God is you got to accept his spirit oh my and can I tell you something else the Spirit of God is what's going to connect and help you make a rapture brother Branham talked about the the magnets he went into the little the shop you know and they were cleaning up the floors and and he saw this stuff and he say uh what would happen is that they would send a magnet by and would come by and he said he would see different things that was on the floor stay on the floor but other stuff that had something in it would actually get attached to that magnet and be drawing away it drawing off the floor and he say he said now wait a minute he said now what about that piece there that should have went up say why why did that go he said because it's bolted down it might be made of the right material but because it's bolted down it can't come up hallelujah somebody I don't know what your bolted down to I don't know what you connected to what you don't want to let go of hallelujah but don't let that stuff keep you down because that magnet was representing a rapture hallelujah somebody and in order for you to be able to attach to the magnet you had to have something on the inside that could be magnetized and the only thing inside of you that can be magnetized to him is his spirit hallelujah you don't want this intellectually you want the real things and don't you stop until you get the real thing hey somebody I'm not trying don't give up don't get our Holy Ghost - please brother Jack don't get that kind of Holy Ghost getting our Holy Ghost that's gonna please God hallelujah somebody this can't be intellectual this thing gotta be real all right I'm going on a little further notice not a Spirit of God came first before he actually gave his spoken word before the condition change the spirit the spirit had to move on it the spirit the change takes place by the spirit of his word he transforms by the spirit of his word now let's go a little further we just recently start preaching on the on the sermon was talking about Mary what was that what was the title that certainly taught Mary something by possible nothing is impossible y'all don't forget already it's all right so I got to renew your minds Oh y'all just make me go into another Channel I ain't gonna do y'all bit how many y'all go back and listen to the sermons after they preach see we've gone through a motion we're just going through a motion and God don't want us to do that God has put every two in your possessions for you to be changed but it's up to you to feed on the word the change is gonna happen through the feeding own of the word the Spirit comes out I can be in my house listening to a sermon from service a service here and amen glory to God not you preaching I should say I don't know I'm preaching and I'm saying Amen it's cuz I realize it's not me preaching it's the Holy Ghost trying to get something tell me and he will use me to say something to me I went right over your head he will use me to say something to me I didn't say through me to me everything you need God has given it to you tapes books the Bible everything but the change is going to happen I'm talking and I don't I don't want this to I ain't gonna be it ain't gonna be deep it's gonna be simple the change actually happens by the spirit of his word the spirit of his word what are you feeding on you want to know why you defeated right why you ain't got no Victor what are you feeding on amen you give you you give your children a man junk food all the time to eat praise God they have a lot of energy and then they just drop any be like oh that's exactly what I wanted but you're killing the child hello somebody right amen what's you feeding on spiritually glory to God don't just don't just come to church to be like a man that was a good service go back and feed on it again all right now hey man hallelujah and you telling me you know like leftovers oh you had a good meal if you're like leftovers you had a good meal sometimes the second time around was better yo y'all give it up said and your mom and I really love it labor them and cook me I'll tell her when we used to go home in a nice little meat loaf she got laid some meat loaf macaroni and cheese candied yams look cabbage that go with it there one smile she feeling good she might throw some some greens not mama didn't make cornbread in our house but my daddy my daddy made a cornbread that looked like pancakes and we could get enough of it daddy post some Oh in there put some oh batter in there daddy and daddy get it all made and we sit down and eat that on a Sunday yeah we won't to wait and have some left oh so money I don't want some spaghetti on Monday give me them give me what we had yesterday hallelujah yo Bobby begin the craze to what you had on the day before if it was a real good meal and if your body can act like that your spirit on it begin to crave on a good meal that God gave you from glory you ought to look forward to eating again [Applause] all right church so this discernment you know that we preach a man of nothing is impossible and I'm still writing that nothing is impossible remember when we go back to the story of Mary Mary beginning to ask the question you know you say I'm gonna I'm gonna conceive and bear a child she say how could these things be it seemed impossible to Mary how could these things be I mean look at my condition I'm a virgin I've never never been touched by man and Mary understood the depth at the mechanics of having children how could these things be how could I have a man a child and and I'm bringing this out because I want you to understand when I say we shall be changed you look at your condition just like Mary looked at her condition a man your here you sometimes you're in darkness sometimes your light sometimes you you know you're up sometimes you down sometimes you got vision sometimes you'll know where you're going huh a menu and you ain't you influx all the time hallelujah but what changes the condition is when the Spirit of God moves on the face of the waters and when God begins to move on the face of the waters then light did he can come for light and light comes forth amen when God moved on me he told me say say say Mary said how this thing gonna be he said say Mary the Holy Ghost the answer was real simple the Holy Ghost is going to overshadow you amen and hallelujah remember the Holy Ghost without sensation we back at it again right because ha she had no feeling she had no emotion but she had a promise and with that promise the Spirit of God I don't know when it came man I don't know how it came in but one thing I do know is that Mary produced a child hallelujah and if the Holy Ghost can cause Mary to come forth with a child then that same Holy Ghost can change you from the mortal to immortality from corruption to incorruption it's the same Holy Ghost that does the change the change comes God does it by the spirit of his word [Applause] you got the example in the scripture Mary conceived and bore Christ after the Holy Spirit / she's out of her and I'ma tell you the only way you're going to actually get a change it's the Holy Spirit I have to also make a difference in you Oh somebody glory to God somebody not going to see death somebody gonna be caught up to meet him in the air but you're gonna have to have the material on the inside in order to do this this is where the rubber meets the road and this is where you need to get down to business with God now you say Lord I can't identify what brother Jack said well that's why you need to come to prayer and when you come to prayer start reaching down and call for that extra rain in the season of rain y'all ain't gotta get this is the season for rain you need to start asking God for it lord I need rain in my own life see if a farmer had a crop that wasn't getting no rain III don't know about my neighbor down the street but lord I need rain this is my living this this is how I feed my family I me rain and you got to get selfish like that Amen buddy Ryan got selfish did not daddy man want the Holy Ghost so bad and he say he went out and found a little cornfield somewhere and just stayed in there just prayed and he told the Lord while he was French say Lord if you don't fill me with the Holy Ghost in this cornfield you're gonna come back and find a pile of dead bones that's a man that meant business he went looking at his watch when it was time for prayer that's a man that meant business with God pastor lot meet in the church lock me in because I meet God hello somebody this hot chains gonna really take place transformation on the inside it'll manifest itself on the outside look at this Oh Lord Jesus let me just read a little thought here a man expectation it says how could you a drunker and and I'm gonna just kind of set this one up you don't realize it but right now you actually be in change you don't realize it you ain't felt it you a unit you know no sensation was there but you actually being changed the eat your very presence here this morning shows that a change is happening some of y'all a year ago would not be sitting here some of y'all two years ago wouldn't be sitting here some of y'all ten years ago wouldn't be sitting here hello some of y'all 20 years ago wouldn't be sitting here come on son bye you ought to look back and see where God brought you from what what was that on the inside of you say well I think I'm gonna start going to church huh when you you want nothing to do with God but what was that that just beginning to deal with your heart say I think I want to go to church amen that was part of the transformation you never even felt it but it's happening anyway you know when I when a frog is born he looks like a fish huh and his tadpole stage he looks like a fish hallelujah swim like a fish act like a fish but as that frog continues to develop hallelujah amen eventually what happens is he loses his tail and let me tell you something as you continue to develop you lose the things of the world and you don't even know when they drop off but because you grown into this thing the things of the world begin to grow strangely dim and the light of his glory and grace and you don't know why you don't like the things you used to like you don't know why you don't want to go to places you used to go it's because a transformation has begun without sensation and if you can see that just in your natural man the transformations also began spiritually where you gonna be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye let me just read it oh my god you know that that frog when he drops his tail hallelujah when he when he drops his tail he becomes I mean he goes from tadpole to being thought he brother branham say he thinks that's what paul was referring to when he wrote description looking at a frog not only does a frog go through a transformation you know a caterpillar we talk about being transfer when we tell our goal from Caterpillar stage and you know if yeah you know if y'all just honest you see a caterpillar by ready to squash it but when you see him in his transform stage he's gentle oh y'all in with me he's colorful he's beautiful and you want him to just land somewhere million do you want to take pictures of him but before he got to that stage he had to go through a transformation hallelujah he had to go into a cocoon this was a really difficult test and when you in the cocoon there's no room for nobody else this is something that you gotta work out on your own and brother branham say when amen if you take scissors and you cut the cocoon you were actually deform the caterpillar you would be for mum rather than allow him to be transformed you deform them hallelujah somebody but if he is true caterpillar if he gives them to that that that cocoon it begins to work things out don't worry I don't care how long the process takes he will come forth hallelujah he'll go in a caterpillar where he'll come out a butterfly [Applause] he'll go in bound to the earth he'll come out a heavenly being come on church amen he was bound down he couldn't get no higher than the ground but when he comes out you don't have to go back down to the ground no more that's a real transformation and the Word of God is what does this to you a caterpillar got to make this happen it's just in his nature this is it there's a certain time period that he has to go to that cocoon and when he goes in that's it when I come out I'm it's gonna be all right my God my God my God this earth is like our cocoon but God is not cutting us out we got to work through every trial work through every tribulation work through every distress because we shall be changed expectation how could you a drunkard a few weeks ago or a few months ago in a gentleman this afternoon how could you a street harlot a few weeks ago and a lady this afternoon by the transforming power of God being transmitted by the Holy Ghost into your heart so the transforming part of power got about Holy Ghost it's coming into your heart change your nature and change your making it made you another person that's why Paul could say things like the the life that I now live I live by the Son of God see what Paul said I used to live a different life but now because Christ has come in I live eight I live something different now hallelujah listen you say say change change them again made you another person that's right you might not have felt I don't know about that but it's here anyhow that's once a Holy Ghost without sensation you might not have felt it but it's here anyhow whether you feel it or not whether you feel like you're being transformed not let's give God thanks for thank you for changing me amen in order to make the rapture you gonna have to go through a change hallelujah you know I'm gonna come back this quote marry one the only one that had to go through a change in order or transformation in order to receive Christ or to produce Christ she went all the way we have other scripture examples when you go back you look at the story of Abraham and Sarah they went through a transformation and you know for the Brandon tells us a story how you think you know what one more than Abraham just wake up and look at Sarah light what happened overnight you change Sarah and your age hasn't changed but your body has and you a 90 year old woman but you're looking like you 18 Sarah whatever happened here and she looked back at Abraham saying Abraham what doesn't happen to you you look like you about 21 again what's going on and the way that you could tell that something happened is that they went down to a place they weren't supposed to go but God would put you in situations that you was supposed to be in in order to prove to you who you are and he sent them I mean he allowed them to go down and took Gerard I believe it was it and here the king sorry like the king was praying that God would send my wife he wanted some Susumu chilling hello somebody but he wanted a nice wife and he and Winnie and when he went with it when he got he saw Sarah come he said oh my god has answered my prayer and Abraham shouldn't have been there and should've did what he's here but he says she my sister now now to some us that's just a little lie a little lie is a lie and Abraham should not I saw his wife out like that what kind of man would give his wife over to something like that he don't even you know he showed that he don't even love his wife he loved his life more than he loved his wife but a real man had put his life out for his wife is that the truth if he really loved hey glory to God you ain't sittin up to the dough the face nobody somebody the dough there go go go go come on a real man don't do not like that yeah I got this I got this you know hey man glory God you ain't got nothing but just act like you got it Abraham give his wife or with a bit election and when when he say oh yes Lord thank you God he got that program say got down on his knees at night he began to pray like lord I thank you for this woman that you give me you brought her to me hey man I have to go looking for her she came to me she came to me Lord Lord he got me between the lines she came to me Lord you brought up to me and as he has he has his praying then the Lord speaks up saying I don't you touch that man's wife wait a minute wife now this was in a dream yeah God was talking to this man in a dream don't touch that man right and they had God and the man had a conversation Abimelech don't touch that man's right say no Lord he said that this was his sister that's what he said said no I know he said but that's his wife and don't you touch it cuz if you touch it I kill you and everybody else around him look okay Lord went on the sleek got up next one who couldn't wait to find me but Abraham Abraham said you know he said if not only not only he said a man lied Lord he said I don't know but that's my prophet God didn't call Abraham his liar God called them his prophet and anything you say no he said and not only do I want you to restore that man his wife I want him to pray for you though do you want to lie you to pray for me yes because he's my prophet I want I want you to get real clear God was not watching over Abraham and Sarah I was watching over his promise that he gave to Abraham and Sarah he said Sarah thy wife shall have a son and because God said that God even when you fail God got to watch over his word that he promised you so I want to tell you this ain't got nothing to do with you this whole God and if God say you gonna be changed I don't care about your mistakes you shall be changed how about a power by the power of the word now in the spirit in the word come producer change it's gonna happen Church go back and let this man pray for you and wait and when that when he prayed now that change that took place in Abraham and Sarah went because the man would not have acts for Sarah to be his wife if he didn't recognize the change he knocks 490 old woman to be his wife no he was he wants a young woman for his wife a man and when he got this young woman feels like right Lord this is something but God proved that the change dollar taking place brother Branham said God didn't just change the outside but what God did was changed the plumbing on the inside because they didn't just go back to being young people again because while they were young people they still can have children huh he didn't just take the outside and change it god oh my god he's not just transforming your outside God wants to transform the inside and when the inside was changed didn't could produce Isaac not only see the inside when the inside went through a change a transmission in the outside also with their the same transformation and they brought forth they brought forth the promised son let me tell you something you got you gonna go you're gonna go through a trance happening right now how did it wind it Abraham fill it when did Sarah fill it they never felt it but the change happened anyway can I go on a little further let me finish this up here expectation says it made you another person that's right you might have felt I don't know about that but if there's any anyhow whether you feel it or not less give God thanks for it for its here any how I can prove to you right now there's radio coming right through you now you watch these statements from the Prophet there is radio passing through you if you got your cell phone in your pocket and somebody wants to send your email if your phone begins to vibrate to let you know that there's an email or text message that just King came to you that that that that that that wave had to come through your body to get to your phone oh my god the wave came through your body you never felt it you never saw it but yet it came through and if a wave of Technology can't come through your body and produce a result take the Holy Ghost come through the same body without you feeling it and produce a result let's go on I asked the question how you know these things how's it gonna happen it's gonna happen very simply the same way happen with Mary be it unto me according to your word that's all God wants you to say Laura being up to me according to work let the change take place to me and what you need to do a fit is to start feeding on the word because a change to come through the word through the spirit that's on the word hello somebody there's a different spirit in music it's a different spirit in music and another spirit in words the change don't come through the worship music the change comes through the spirit that is on the word feed on the words if you want this change you got the feed on the word alright alright let me go in a little further says I can prove to you right now there's a radio radio rate of that radio coming right through you you didn't feel it but you know it's there there's television pictures coming right through you now but you don't feel it but it's there anyhow oh my now if our body was magnetized to that like like that big word said yes stretched out from the window to this window and sweeping through this building yes going right through you somebody say yes on the radio well it's coming right through you as it goes as it goes through them them powers electronics and so forth as it goes through your body now when it hits against the crystal in the set it just catches like that and you hear yes now if god up there said bias stripes where he'll the Holy Ghost like this is these are you might not find this in the dictionary but you gotta you know the Holy Spirit can reveal this the Holy Ghost in twines brings that down by the power of God your heart is set on that it says yes by stripes we are healed God you said in and mark 11:24 whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe you receive it Lord we prayed for a meeting we've been fasting for a meeting we've been crying for a meeting yes Lord I believe the meetings on the road then standing there like Oh til the power of God comes down when it

they got to start all over again so don't break the spirit don't break the wave of the spirit huh and when the first man say yes the next man see pulling a clock when we get a church him and for me somebody Allah yes you gotta say yes the next will say yes everybody say yes create an atmosphere like I can do something [Applause] praise God you might not even feel it but why you saying yes you surrender it to the world and the wine is producing a change in your body and before you know it one day we won't be grounded no more we shall be changed and notice what the Bible say in the moments that mean you'll never feel it you'll never feel it but because of promised sinning and even when you go astray because God made a promise he got to bring you back to fulfill his promise that's why I could sing mercy said God can't let you go he won't to to fulfill this promise you shall be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah all right let me just finish this please it says that they're standing there till the power God comes down when it hits it says yes next man says yes look at it you got double powers of yes then the Holy Spirit moves in and confers the Word of God with signs and wonders following that's it that's what we meet and expectation see how that double the power yes and you know just one person yes and then that thing just pick up like that you just start feeling something isn't this the world calls it an energy I call it the spirit and some of y'all said yesterday and you didn't want to say yes didn't I hear you say yes you really want to say yes but you couldn't say no [Applause] what would it sound like if you was the only one in the church that said no when everybody else was saying yes you could resistor yes you came
