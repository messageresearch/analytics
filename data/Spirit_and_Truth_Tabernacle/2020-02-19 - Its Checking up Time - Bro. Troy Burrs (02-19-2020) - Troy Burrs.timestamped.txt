[6:08] a quick from the first chapter and then
[6:11] know that you have your seats and we'll
[6:15] go from there amen Joshua the first
[6:18] chapter now after the death of Moses the
[6:23] servant of the Lord it came to pass that
[6:26] the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of
[6:30] nun Moses minister saying Moses my
[6:33] servant is dead now therefore arise and
[6:36] go over this Jordan died and all this
[6:39] this people unto the land which I do
[6:42] give thee even to the children of Israel
[6:46] amen you may be seated
[6:49] amen
[6:54] being a kind of Bible Bible studies sort
[6:58] of a less informal sort of gathering
[7:03] just want to take our time and just take
[7:07] a look at some of these things I believe
[7:08] that the Lord is uh kind of have this
[7:14] inspired because even before the
[7:16] meetings I was kind of just looking at a
[7:19] certain subject on the message that the
[7:22] prophets speak spoke on respect and
[7:30] I didn't even realize it but the the
[7:32] video had came out just today the
[7:36] YouTube and when brother Joe got up here
[7:39] he sort of just kind of fell into that
[7:41] in talking about how in second Kings
[7:44] there how the the the woman they were
[7:47] they were coming to take her sons and
[7:50] and make them slaves but because she had
[7:53] a certain level of respect a man ensured
[7:56] a certain level respect for the gospel
[7:59] amen her sons were saved a man and then
[8:03] brother McGarry sort of just hit it on
[8:06] Sunday night and I say well Lord I'll
[8:08] tell you something else and no brother
[8:10] William I was right there and I said man
[8:12] I was just not even into that study into
[8:14] that and I started sharing with him some
[8:16] of the things that God had shown me and
[8:19] no month I got the words out of my mouth
[8:21] Jack was up here and he was kind of
[8:24] giving that monitor on the Stephanie he
[8:26] thought it's saying something to make
[8:28] things they said you're gonna learn to
[8:30] be talking around he preaches stop
[8:34] preaching your message so but I just
[8:37] believed you know I was talking about it
[8:39] and we were fellowshipping around it in
[8:41] there are seven brothers Danny was
[8:43] saying I said yeah because we all fish
[8:45] in the same pond name man it's the same
[8:48] Holy Ghost amen
[8:50] so looking at this I don't know you know
[8:54] if I had the title it I I would say I
[8:58] would say to the church this evening
[9:00] it's checking up time checking up time
[9:05] we're living we're living in a great
[9:08] hour we understand and we understand
[9:10] that uh we have to be in place to do our
[9:15] part God has called us amen to to be
[9:20] more than just how should I say more
[9:24] than just the come and sit and observe
[9:28] Amen you are eight an intricate part of
[9:32] what God is doing in this out amen your
[9:36] your your your your what you're doing is
[9:40] just as important
[9:42] amen as anybody else just as important
[9:46] because he's the gospel amen it comes to
[9:50] them we'll look at this oh man and in
[9:52] Scripture here let's just take let me go
[9:55] back and say what I was saying
[9:56] the gospel is just as important all the
[9:59] way down through amen the the tree all
[10:03] the way down through the bus a little
[10:04] start in a prophet but but it but it
[10:07] moves on through the body and it's just
[10:10] as important as it was in the Prophet as
[10:13] it was as it was as it is in the
[10:16] ministry as it is and the lay members
[10:18] it's the same word and it's the same
[10:21] responsibility amen and it's the same
[10:24] Holy Ghost amen
[10:26] so looking here we read Joshua what we
[10:29] see where the Joshua were the death of
[10:34] Moses and it was Joshua's job to to
[10:39] carry it on Moses we had spoke about a
[10:43] few weeks ago that the grace of men on
[10:46] that journey coming out of Egypt and
[10:49] redemption is a two-part coming out of
[10:52] and going into but we have to recognize
[10:54] that Moses the Prophet brought them out
[10:58] but it was Joshua that took them in so a
[11:03] midnight date of Moses being the Prophet
[11:06] a man had a certain level of respect
[11:11] they men had a certain level of where
[11:15] the people looked to Moses but they at
[11:19] that point they had to be able to
[11:22] recognize that the cigar was no longer
[11:26] using Moses but that same level of
[11:29] respect had to go to Joshua a man and
[11:35] even further we'll we'll read on down
[11:37] here let's look at this taking it from
[11:39] Joshua the second chapter amen remember
[11:43] it's checking up time and Joshua the son
[11:47] of not sit down of shittim two men to
[11:53] spy secretly
[11:55] saying go view the land even Jerico and
[12:00] they went out and came into the harlots
[12:03] house named Rahab to lodge there and it
[12:07] was told to the king of Jericho saying
[12:09] behold that came in in his - tonight of
[12:14] the children of Israel to search out the
[12:17] country and the king of Jericho sent
[12:20] them to rehab saying breathe forth to me
[12:22] and that I come to thee which are
[12:25] entered into thine house and they become
[12:29] to search all the country and the woman
[12:35] took the two men and heed them and said
[12:38] thus there came men unto me but I wish
[12:42] not which they were and and it came to
[12:47] pass about the time of shutting of the
[12:50] gate when it was dark that the men went
[12:53] out
[12:54] whither the men went out what not
[12:57] pursued after them quickly for ye shall
[13:04] overtake them amen
[13:06] but she had brought them to the roof of
[13:10] the house and heed them with us with the
[13:15] stomps of the Flex which she had laid in
[13:19] order upon her roof and the men pursued
[13:23] after them by the way of Jordan unto the
[13:26] force and as soon as the as soon as they
[13:30] which pursued after them were gone she
[13:32] shut the gate
[13:34] and before they were laid down she came
[13:39] up - upon the roof and she said unto the
[13:43] men I know that the Lord has given you
[13:45] the land that you're that I know she
[13:50] said unto the men I know that the Lord
[13:53] has given you the lane and that your
[13:58] terror is falling upon us and that all
[14:02] the inhabitants of the land faint
[14:05] because of you
[14:09] for we have heard how the Lord dried up
[14:13] the water of the Red Sea for you when
[14:16] you came out of Egypt and I came out of
[14:21] Egypt and what he did to the kings of
[14:24] the ammonites that were on the other
[14:27] side of Jordan Sion and all whom ye
[14:33] utterly utterly destroyed now as soon as
[14:38] they had heard these things their hearts
[14:40] did melt neither did they remain any
[14:44] more courage in any man because of you
[14:47] the Lord God the Lord your God He is God
[14:53] in heaven above and in earth she says
[14:57] now therefore I pray you swear to me by
[15:01] the Lord since I showed you kindness and
[15:05] ye will also show kindness unto my
[15:08] father's house and give me a true token
[15:13] and that ye will save alive my father my
[15:18] mother my brother my sister and all that
[15:23] health and delivered our lives from
[15:26] death now I want you to notice that this
[15:31] harlot this Gentile Amen
[15:36] she had a certain level of respect she
[15:39] recognized Amen that God was with these
[15:43] people she had heard about the things
[15:46] that was going on that they had done and
[15:48] and not only her but all of the land
[15:51] but-but-but-but she had a certain level
[15:54] of respect for the gospel even though it
[15:59] wasn't to her there are several
[16:03] different places throughout scripture
[16:05] that we can see the same example a man
[16:08] that that because of a certain level of
[16:12] respect that they've had now let me say
[16:16] they chi-chi-chi didn't have this level
[16:19] of respect for Moses she
[16:22] but that wasn't to Moses she wasn't
[16:24] talking to Moses amen
[16:27] Joshua was not there she wasn't talking
[16:30] to Joshua she was talking to two unknown
[16:35] men but she had respect for the message
[16:42] of that out she had a certain level of
[16:48] respect not for that message and those
[16:52] men a man that came out to spy out the
[16:56] letter now she could have she cheat she
[17:00] she had choices she could have said who
[17:04] do you think you are and all of these
[17:06] sorts of things but because of her
[17:11] kindness and the level of respect that
[17:15] she had sure they meant God saved her
[17:20] her respect to these men and to the
[17:23] message was recognized amen all the way
[17:27] by through the ranks of God himself
[17:30] honor the messengers because she added
[17:33] the messages amen and the woman yet the
[17:37] people the message came to entreat their
[17:40] local ministers that are trying to tell
[17:44] them about even a greater message of
[17:47] deliverance for us and our families in
[17:50] this state and we'll treat them with
[17:55] such disrespect like they are almost
[17:59] entrusting the people of the earth and
[18:02] then wonder why there is no token
[18:06] applies to their families Amen I was I
[18:10] was talking about that out on a palm
[18:13] aware and that for stage and say and
[18:15] turnabout was I mentioned be careful
[18:18] very careful how you how you handle amen
[18:24] the message the word and it's ministers
[18:30] and it's anointed careful how you don't
[18:34] know
[18:35] another careful how you speak about one
[18:39] another there's a certain level of
[18:42] respect you are the bride of Jesus
[18:45] Christ you don't talk to the bride of
[18:47] Jesus Christ any okay no way there was
[18:56] in this message respect the Prophet was
[18:59] bringing out how there was a certain
[19:02] level of disrespect Elijah had gone on
[19:08] and the mantle was passed down to Elijah
[19:11] and and and no doubt he was talking
[19:14] about how they were at the house it was
[19:19] a certain family or whatever that may
[19:21] have been at the dinner table and having
[19:25] conversation and their conversation was
[19:28] about this old prophet who did he think
[19:31] he is saying all kind of manner of
[19:34] things against the message and the
[19:37] messenger now the children over here in
[19:42] this conversation over hearing these
[19:46] adults badmouth and say all sorts of
[19:50] things about a man what God is doing
[19:53] about the message about the messenger
[19:56] and so kids being kids
[20:01] amen they learned how to learn behavior
[20:04] just by osmosis amen there are sponges
[20:08] and they just kind of soak up the energy
[20:10] and soak up the conversation that they
[20:13] overhear the adults speaking amen and in
[20:16] me they kind of take on that spirit
[20:28] proverbs 20 second shot to the 24th and
[20:31] 25th work he says no makes make no
[20:34] friendship with an angry man and with
[20:37] the furious man for thou shalt not go
[20:40] let's now learn his ways and get a snare
[20:47] to your soul
[20:48] first Corinthians 15:33 say be not
[20:53] deceived evil communications corrupt
[20:55] good manners amen
[20:58] evil communications corrupt good manners
[21:01] and we see that in this situation here
[21:07] where they were these children of those
[21:10] they happened to see this profit and
[21:12] they began to tease this profit because
[21:15] they just kind of picked up from what
[21:17] their parents what they had heard they
[21:21] had no idea they did with children they
[21:23] didn't know any better they was just
[21:25] repeating what they had heard and had
[21:27] picked up the spirit through the
[21:29] communication of the adults that was
[21:31] supposed to be leading them and around
[21:34] them and they began to talk and cheese
[21:36] the profit and it cost them their lives
[21:39] so we see on one hand where one of our
[21:43] lead Rahab she had she she recognized
[21:45] and had a certain level respect for
[21:48] these ministers in her house was saved
[21:50] and on the other hand because the level
[21:53] of disrespect that children was lost we
[21:58] talking about its checking uptime watch
[22:03] how we handle one another watch how I
[22:07] will approach to the gospel because see
[22:11] I believe what the Lord is trying to get
[22:13] to us is that this is not a man in this
[22:17] hour this is the works of the Holy
[22:21] Spirit so works of the whole in there
[22:25] has to be a certain level of respect the
[22:29] Prophet was talking about another
[22:31] message I can't call it right now but he
[22:33] said that I've been all over the world I
[22:36] spoke the kings and
[22:37] judges and different things now you
[22:39] don't walk into the courtroom and say
[22:42] hey yo how to do was a no you have to
[22:46] address him with the certain level of
[22:49] respect if you expect to get anything
[22:52] yes Your Honor may I approach may I
[22:55] approach the bench your honor sir you
[23:01] have to approach him with a certain
[23:03] level of respect he said he was talking
[23:10] about on the keys you know you don't go
[23:13] into a kingdom a man and talk to the
[23:16] king queen Prince any kind of way
[23:21] there's a certain level there's a
[23:23] certain way that you have to approach a
[23:28] man that same thing applies in this hour
[23:35] okay if we're going to get anything from
[23:39] God it's a certain level it's a certain
[23:42] way of approach to the Gospels a certain
[23:44] way of approach a man to the ministry a
[23:48] certain level of approach that we have
[23:51] to one another a man now we move on her
[23:58] we see here in Joshua the sixth chapter
[24:04] and the fifteenth verse reads and it
[24:10] came to pass on the seventh day that
[24:12] they rose early about the dawning of the
[24:14] day and to capacitor about the city
[24:16] after the same man of seven times only
[24:20] on that day they come past about the
[24:22] city seven times and it came to pass and
[24:26] it came to pass at the seventh time when
[24:29] the priests blew the trumpets Joshua was
[24:33] said to the people shop for the Lord has
[24:35] given the you the city the seventeen
[24:39] first and the city shall be accursed
[24:41] even it and all that are therein to the
[24:47] Lord only Rahab the harlot
[24:50] I live she and all that are with her in
[24:55] the house because she hid the messengers
[24:57] that was saying 21st and they utterly
[25:05] destroyed all all that that was in the
[25:07] city both man woman young and old ox
[25:10] sheep as an edge of the with the end of
[25:13] the sward but Joshua had said unto the
[25:17] two men that had spied out the country
[25:21] go into the harlots house and bring out
[25:23] thence the woman and all that she has as
[25:28] ye swear to her and the young men that
[25:32] were spies went in and brought out rehab
[25:36] and her father and her mother and her
[25:37] brother and all she had and they brought
[25:42] all of her kindred my god and left them
[25:46] with without the camp of issue of Israel
[25:50] and they burnt the city with fire and
[25:53] all was there in only the silver and
[25:56] gold and the vessels of brass and iron
[25:58] they put into a Treasury of the house of
[26:02] the Lord and Joshua was saying Rahab the
[26:04] harlot alive in her father's household
[26:06] and all that she had and she dwelt in
[26:09] Israel even unto this day because she
[26:12] hated the messengers which Joshua was
[26:15] sent to spy out Jericho
[26:16] a man now Joshua we see by the
[26:24] leadership a men of the Holy Spirit led
[26:27] the people into their inheritance of
[26:31] what God had promised them through the
[26:34] Ministry of Moses theirs was a natural
[26:41] inheritance
[26:43] ours is a spiritual inheritance even
[26:47] greater than the natural one the same
[26:51] thing is going on a date the Prophet was
[26:53] talking about how how Joshua parallels
[26:57] Ephesians Joshua parallels Ephesians and
[27:02] Ephesians parent
[27:03] lay lady of ceiling the same thing is
[27:06] going on today
[27:08] Amen well we're going over into it and
[27:13] into an inheritance a man to claim a man
[27:16] what is rightfully ours now I wanted to
[27:19] aside and just say now we noticed that
[27:21] they had to fight we had a wonderful
[27:25] weekend people gained ground we all gain
[27:32] ground I know I am sitting in heavenly
[27:35] places this morning a man still Thank
[27:38] You Marella still flowed from the
[27:42] weekend and the things that always said
[27:45] and how God really just blessed us we've
[27:49] gained new ground but you have to fight
[27:53] to keep it you have to fight to keep it
[27:59] because the devil wants to come and get
[28:01] that ground back he wants to come and
[28:05] make you regress from what you have
[28:09] gained no we have to fight and move
[28:14] forward move forward
[28:18] amen God has so much more for us it's
[28:22] been said that we are living so far
[28:24] beneath our means why three things we
[28:28] have to understand we have to recognize
[28:30] who he is who we are and what time we're
[28:36] living in we can recognize those things
[28:40] it would give us to courage a man to
[28:43] move forward we already have the victory
[28:45] it's already ours we just have to claim
[28:48] it we're talking about manifestations
[28:51] and different things of that nature but
[28:53] your president was saying in one area
[28:55] that was talking to the prophets saying
[28:56] well why you always only women about
[29:00] this short hair and the makeup and the
[29:03] way they dress and and all of these
[29:05] things he says how can I preached a PCS
[29:07] if they don't algebra when they came
[29:10] feces same thing here and we may not be

[29:36] have to follow the directions if it says
[29:38] take them every six hours you have to
[29:41] take it every six hours because that's
[29:44] how the medication was designed it wants
[29:46] to keep the the right amount of
[29:48] antibodies in your system at the highest
[29:50] level for a certain amount of time Amen
[29:54] so we come amen and we take the
[29:58] antibiotics we can't if you if you get
[30:04] off a little of the prescription off of
[30:07] the direction what happens you you but

[30:14] medication in your system what am I
[30:17] saying I know a lot of times we get busy

[31:05] an understanding as I said to him I said
[31:08] you know God meets all his appointments
[31:10] and if I was going to the doctor and I
[31:13] had an ailment and I go to the doctor
[31:16] and the doctors say well I want you to
[31:18] go home and do
[31:19] this thing come back at this time I'm
[31:21] going to get another appointment and
[31:22] we'll do something that's I got a check

[31:38] the appointment the house of God amen is
[31:44] a house of correction is the house of
[31:47] print since is the check this is the
[31:50] clinic passages preached not too long
[31:54] ago he says every time you come again if
[31:56] you went to the to the hospital you you
[31:59] you you come in and you want to go out
[32:01] fixed the problem was talking about the
[32:06] young lady I said the young lady she was
[32:08] an old lady called the colored woman
[32:10] that got hit by the car and she said you
[32:13] needed the car said no not in Lord his
[32:15] son I need fixing I need fixing amen and
[32:21] we need to recognize and the spiritual
[32:24] sense that we need fixing we need fixing
[32:32] praise the Lord we can't wait we have
[32:37] the appointments is that this is vitally
[32:39] important God keeps all this importance
[32:42] is important that we keep on not now you
[32:46] say well were you just trying to am I to
[32:48] come to church come to church this is
[32:52] for your own good you in this hour is
[32:56] not about willpower that's see that's
[32:58] where a lot of people were willpower the
[33:01] truth to live a certain way and to carry
[33:04] themself a certain way you just got to
[33:06] have a certain amount of willpower he's
[33:08] saying God nothing to do with you this
[33:10] is the word that's doing the changing
[33:13] it's the Word of God that's building
[33:17] cell on top of self amen giving you what
[33:21] you need to sustain in these last and
[33:24] evil days amen it's them did the
[33:28] antibiotics that staying at a high
[33:32] in your system you miss a couple of
[33:34] dozen antibiotic and then the medicine
[33:36] in your system is getting low and you
[33:38] susceptible a man to catchy or the thing
[33:42] that they're trying to fight coming back
[33:47] it's a demon so you have to take the
[33:52] antibiotic prescription up to a certain
[33:55] level of strength and you can't do that
[34:00] by not feeding on the word of God which
[34:03] is the antibiotic you say well I can
[34:05] stay home and I can stream that's not
[34:12] the same as being in the atmosphere the
[34:18] doctor can called you into and tell you
[34:20] well are you doing it actually how you
[34:22] doing no he got that actually he got
[34:26] this press he'll draw blood and do all
[34:31] of these sorts of things see the Word of
[34:34] God in the desert of the it's a
[34:37] discerner amen a sharper than the 2-inch
[34:40] war you got to come in that's showing a
[34:45] certain level of respect that's showing
[34:51] that you are convinced my God that you
[34:56] are convinced that hell is at the house
[34:59] of the Lord you find yourself on we stay
[35:06] in home and and and and and and and and
[35:08] so well I was just going to listen to
[35:10] the tapes and I'm just going to do these
[35:12] sorts of things
[35:13] amen you're getting weak you don't
[35:17] realize it I don't if I miss my
[35:19] antibiotic I don't feel it I don't feel
[35:21] any different
[35:22] I feel just the same but on the inside
[35:28] the level of medication has decreased
[35:31] you can stay home and you can read your
[35:33] Bible I promise you that if you miss
[35:37] service you stay at home for six months
[35:39] and just I read my Bible is the same
[35:41] word but I promise you you'll see a
[35:44] change in you
[35:47] you'll see a change in your life and I
[35:52] tell you one for you miss one service is
[35:54] easy to miss - you miss - it's easy to
[35:57] miss folk watch the devil
[36:02] watch the devil pray for one another
[36:05] we're all in the battle we're all in the
[36:08] back and we are all in it together any
[36:11] man you see one who says that no eating
[36:14] even if you don't conscious Lord Jesus
[36:18] III haven't seen such and such a noble
[36:21] Lord I send the tow package Lord Lord
[36:27] whatever it is that may be hindering
[36:29] them Oh father god I pray Lord that day
[36:31] that they're safe for the safety in
[36:33] their foot I encourage them O Lord God
[36:36] because we know how important it judges
[36:38] go at all time must be a certain level
[36:43] of respect a certain level of
[36:46] understanding of what's going on in this
[36:47] out amen let me move on here
[36:51] Matthew touch in Chapter II says he that
[36:54] receiveth the prophet and the name of a
[36:57] prophet receives a prophet reward and he
[36:59] that received a righteous man in the
[37:01] name of a righteous man seems a
[37:03] righteous man award reward see it's not
[37:08] all it to the Prophet but as he's here
[37:10] talking here the final ministry don't
[37:13] take these things for granted of what
[37:17] God has has has given a man what to get
[37:22] us ready for a rapture amen
[37:29] thank you Jesus says he'll they believe
[37:33] to a point of coming out but couldn't
[37:35] believe beyond the state that God the
[37:37] prophet believing in Joshua the
[37:41] leadership of the Holy Spirit the least
[37:44] of the ones who carry the message of the
[37:48] hour I'm gonna read that again they
[37:52] believed to the point of coming out they
[37:55] had faith to come out but they could
[37:58] have believed beyond the stage of God
[38:01] sent a prophet to believing in Joshua
[38:07] and the leadership of the Holy Spirit we
[38:11] believe that God sent a prophet but what
[38:15] happens is a problem a lot of times we
[38:18] believe God sent a prophet but way but
[38:21] when it comes to the Holy Ghost leading
[38:23] Joshua there they had a problem well I
[38:29] see it in brother Branham but do I see
[38:31] it in the FIFO queue ministry do I have
[38:34] that same level of respect they made for
[38:39] the messages I had for my pastor a
[38:43] matter for the fivefold ministry that's
[38:45] coming through it's the Holy Ghost
[38:49] excuse me it's the Holy Ghost amen
[38:53] he said the Holy Ghost is here the same
[38:56] work a man nightwear that was in the
[38:59] prophet a man is passed through the
[39:02] bride amen and he said it order fivefold
[39:05] ministry for what the perfecting of the
[39:07] saints I use the analogy once that this
[39:13] perfecting of the Saints the Prophet is
[39:15] came in and and he's given us the
[39:18] material that faces the substance of
[39:20] things hoped for the material work when
[39:22] they gave us a basic outline a man of
[39:25] the bride but now it's the job of the
[39:28] fivefold ministry to do the little
[39:31] fine-tuning so that it coming through
[39:34] the full likeness a man of the bride the
[39:39] Prophet laid everything has put
[39:41] everything in the store
[39:42] she gave us the tools to work with he
[39:45] gave us to hammer the chisel he gave us
[39:47] to find carving and materials and things
[39:50] to do the fine tuning on this
[39:53] masterpiece
[39:55] amen amen so the fact that fivefold
[40:00] ministry is carrying out a man the same
[40:03] order amen that the Prophet was carrying
[40:06] out Moses my servant is dead now was the
[40:09] responsibility of Joshua then Joshua
[40:12] been typing a hold of ghost st. two
[40:14] spies to save this Gentile harlot woman
[40:19] the type of the fivefold ministry amen
[40:27] hey man I got a move on see my time is
[40:30] getting away so we see uh in the message
[40:39] to India report the prophecy uh but I
[40:48] got better hopes of you brethren here
[40:51] this morning that you'll be men of God
[40:54] who stay with the word and let
[40:58] everything else fall to the left but
[41:01] stay right with that word he says don't
[41:05] move no matter if you're a doormat out
[41:10] there be a good doormat
[41:14] don't try to compete with someone else
[41:17] or do this just get right in the word
[41:20] and stay right there and God will
[41:24] positionally place you into his kingdom
[41:27] where you can be the best now this is
[41:36] why you want to serve the Lord in your
[41:39] local church where God has placed you
[41:43] that is a very powerful thing don't ever
[41:48] let the devil move you out of your
[41:50] position of service don't ever let the
[41:56] doesn't move you out of your position of
[41:59] service because the position is an
[42:02] important part of the purpose of God in
[42:05] this hour no matter how small it seems
[42:10] very important Church is a place that
[42:15] individuals can we can serve one another
[42:18] as a body of believers it is not just
[42:22] coming to this building it is also then
[42:26] as the body of believers we then serve
[42:29] other parts of the body of Christ in
[42:32] other places and this is why the devil
[42:36] wants to destroy this church because we
[42:39] are making a difference by our service
[42:42] to the body of Christ in our community
[42:47] amen
[42:48] because we're making a difference now
[42:51] not now not now see we don't own the
[42:53] Bible that some people have read the
[42:57] only Bible that some people would ever
[42:59] read amen so you have just as much of a
[43:02] responsibility amen to share the word
[43:05] and to be a man a missionary in your
[43:10] community as the pastor does as the
[43:14] fivefold ministry amen
[43:16] just like you were saying that back the
[43:17] word comes down because thoughts at the
[43:20] Prophet amen through the Holy Ghost
[43:23] threw a yielded vessel amen
[43:27] two two two fivefold ministry to the
[43:30] lamb team to the community see it's all
[43:35] the vessels in every point to it and
[43:38] who's that received you not so much they
[43:42] might not run into brother Jack they may
[43:43] not run into brother Troy they may not
[43:45] running in a minister but they run into
[43:47] you so you're you're part of the vessel
[43:52] is just as important as the prophets
[43:57] it's checking up time now I want to say
[44:03] something here
[44:04] and I'm going to be bringing this to a
[44:06] close
[44:08] one of the mistakes that I've seen the
[44:14] Lord has been dealing with me on we
[44:22] talked about last week a couple of weeks
[44:25] ago rather we was talking about the
[44:27] journey from law degrees and we'll find
[44:31] that we'll get to a point and we feel
[44:38] like well I'm there I got it the Word of
[44:44] God is an endless will I can never have
[44:52] enough
[44:53] he's an inexhaustible fountain lady told
[44:59] my wife she was sharing with her on a
[45:02] job because she noticed the differences
[45:06] she's Christian lady you know she but
[45:12] they look different and she was sort of
[45:17] probing and when the devil tells you it
[45:23] don't take all that you know it's the
[45:26] veil because God would never tell you to
[45:31] just get so much in stock he'll never
[45:35] tell you say if this is the line he'll
[45:40] never just get you right to the other
[45:41] side of the line and say that's enough
[45:43] that's good enough
[45:44] come on people are so deceived by the
[45:50] enemy in this hour if this is the line I
[45:53] want to be all the way over there not
[45:57] even close to the line so when he says
[46:01] well it don't take all that well maybe
[46:05] it don't take all this but I'm gonna do
[46:07] this anyway because I know it pleases
[46:09] them even if it don't take all of that I
[46:14] know it just gives him joy so i'ma do it
[46:19] even if I don't have to do it
[46:23] see that's the attitude that's having
[46:27] respect for the message so what I say is
[46:32] this we see that a lot of times in
[46:36] spiritually speaking we get to a place
[46:39] oh this is good enough
[46:44] the the pool that the desire the fervent
[46:50] desire to have more just kind of what I
[46:54] get comfortable here and I'll stay right
[46:57] here
[46:58] no you have to keep pressing forward
[47:04] the problem is prophesied this hear the
[47:11] message convinced then consider he says
[47:15] now there's so many people say if you
[47:17] quiver hold your eyes shut do all kinds
[47:22] of things and get sensations you you get
[47:26] spirits friend but if your life don't
[47:30] tally up to what you're professing then
[47:34] there's something wrong with the spirit
[47:37] you gotta see the and it's true you must
[47:43] be sure he preached a message called
[47:49] presuming we don't want to pursue in
[47:55] this hour we want to constantly be
[47:59] checking up to make sure we have what
[48:04] we're professing it is a constant
[48:08] checking up of our selves by the word we
[48:14] don't want to pursue min this hour he
[48:17] says you must be sure the Holy Spirit
[48:20] will bring forth a holy life that's
[48:24] right and if the desire is in your heart
[48:28] if you have to
[48:30] if you have to force yourself constantly
[48:33] to crack to press and do what's right
[48:37] and the world is still Hungary in you
[48:41] then there's something wrong see the
[48:45] Holy Spirit in you will not hunger for
[48:48] the world
[48:49] it'll hunger for God if it's hard for
[48:54] you to go to church and press yourself
[48:56] to come with the touches open there's
[49:00] something wrong with the spirit it's
[49:05] trying to keep you away from God the
[49:09] spirit of God will run you right
[49:11] straight to the church every time the
[49:14] door is open for fellowship
[49:16] yes sir see so you've got to be sure of
[49:22] this now the time is at hand it's
[49:27] checking up time it is the hour where
[49:32] the wise Virgin is trimming her lamps
[49:35] and making sure she has enough oil for
[49:38] the journey so what am I trying to say
[49:45] let's not get complacent let's not get
[49:50] rest on our laws we're doing real well
[49:56] went wait wait wait when I like the
[50:00] fishing we're not cleaning fish every
[50:03] now indeed I'm using the knife and I'm
[50:06] cleaning the fish at night I may cut
[50:08] myself maybe some of your sisters know
[50:10] when you're cooking you're in the
[50:11] kitchen you're cooking and you're using
[50:13] that knife and times you get a little
[50:15] cut on your hand see so when if we're up
[50:19] here and we're in the wilderness war
[50:22] amen sometimes we get cut to say Lord
[50:27] I'm chicken up I'm checking up make sure
[50:32] that I have what I'm professor because
[50:37] the time is at hand amen
[50:43] be honest with ourselves my god press
[50:49] forward let's let us not get weary in
[50:54] well-doing it's not time to relax we're
[51:00] in a battle the enemy comes a man to the
[51:04] ground that we've gained I believe we've
[51:06] gained ground and we're constantly
[51:07] gaining ground but if you don't stay on
[51:10] the office if you don't keep fighting
[51:14] amen
[51:16] you will lose ground you will lose
[51:20] ground in the Ezekiel well let me say
[51:29] this first the prophets sayidina what I
[51:35] don't have the message he says do you
[51:39] realize the responsibility of this city
[51:43] he's talking about Tempe I believe
[51:46] that's Tempe Arizona but I'm gonna say
[51:52] the responsibility of this city here in
[51:54] West Palm Beach he said I believe is
[51:58] resting upon your shoulders I believe
[52:05] God has made you lighthouses each one of
[52:09] you didn't have the responsibility of
[52:15] the sins of the city is resting upon you
[52:23] is resting upon ministers upon the
[52:28] church people the pilgrims as we journey
[52:32] through is resting upon you
[52:38] young people I'm not in your school
[52:44] that's your job
[52:47] that's where God has placed you I don't
[52:50] run in your circles so you are
[52:54] responsible for the Lighthouse of the
[52:59] word in the circles that you run in God
[53:03] has placed that responsibility squarely
[53:05] in your lap squarely in your lap it's
[53:11] your responsibility
[53:13] amen don't take it lightly you are part
[53:17] of the vessel that the Holy Spirit is
[53:20] using a man in Ezekiel the 36 chapter he
[53:28] says I will sanctify my great name the
[53:31] 23rd verse I was think defy my great
[53:34] name which was profaned among the
[53:38] heathen which he have profaned in the
[53:41] midst of them and the heathen shall know
[53:44] I shall known that I am the Lord sayeth
[53:48] the Lord God when I shall be sanctified
[53:50] in you before their eyes for I will take
[53:56] you from among the heathen and gather
[53:59] you out of all countries and will bring
[54:02] you into your own land then will I
[54:07] sprinkle clean water upon you and ye
[54:09] shall be clean from all your filthiness
[54:12] and from your idols will I cleanse you
[54:17] 26 verse says a new heart also will I
[54:20] give you and a new spirit will I put
[54:24] within you now I want to start right
[54:27] there
[54:31] some people make the mistake he said I
[54:35] will put a new spirit in you and we
[54:41] think that's the Holy Spirit because you
[54:46] don't do the things you do anymore he's
[54:50] the Prophet said that he had to give you
[54:53] a new spirit so that that old ugly
[54:55] spirit that you used to had and get
[54:56] along with the Holy Spirit he had to
[55:01] change your nature so that the nature a
[55:06] man of that lamb a man the Dove the Holy
[55:13] Spirit can come and fellowship
[55:15] they have like natures but he had to
[55:18] change your nature sometime we get
[55:23] complacent with just a new spirit and
[55:26] never go on to the Holy Spirit
[55:33] a new heart also will I give you and a
[55:36] new spirit what I put in you and I will
[55:38] take away the stony heart out of your
[55:41] flesh the stony heart out of your flesh
[55:43] and I will give you a heart of flesh and
[55:47] I will put my spirit within you and
[55:51] cause you to walk in my statutes and ye
[55:56] shall keep my judgments and do them
[56:00] let us not stop at just a new spirit
[56:04] let's make sure that we have the holy
[56:10] spirit the holy spirit that vessel will
[56:16] have us to do the same thing that the
[56:20] Prophet was doing now I'm not saying
[56:23] you're gonna be speaking or squirrels
[56:24] and to assistants and all of these kind
[56:26] of things don't misunderstand me but the
[56:29] manifestation of the love of God and if
[56:34] there's a need for you to speak a
[56:36] squirrel I believe you have the faith
[56:38] within you to speak it but let's just
[56:44] try to have a love of God the concern of
[56:48] God it should and you know when I am in
[56:54] the prayed up just right and it does I
[57:00] walk out in the streets and it just like
[57:02] Oh God
[57:04] oh my job I just like I said how can i
[57:08] how can I speak to him how can I speak
[57:10] to him how can I say so give me an
[57:11] opportunity cuz I really care I don't
[57:15] want to see him go to hell but people
