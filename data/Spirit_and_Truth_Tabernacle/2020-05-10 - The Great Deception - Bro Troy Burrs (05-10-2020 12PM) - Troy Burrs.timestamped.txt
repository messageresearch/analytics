[16:03] by you
[16:05] [Music]
[16:07] Oh
[16:11] who I
[16:13] [Music]
[16:16] I provided some information this week
[16:41] and just wanted to offer word of prayer
[16:43] for the family there in South Carolina
[16:47] and there was a family and her husband
[16:52] had been in a coma for I want to say a
[16:56] couple weeks he and his wife both
[16:59] contracted the corona virus and the wife
[17:03] had passed away in and they were waiting
[17:06] for the husband to come out of the coma
[17:07] before they would actually have her
[17:10] service so they were just holding her
[17:14] until he came out but he never came out
[17:17] of the coma he actually went home to be
[17:18] with the Lord as well and the church had
[17:21] the funeral there for both the husband
[17:24] and wife and I just want to say Church
[17:28] we there's so so much going on in our
[17:31] world about this this virus where did it
[17:35] come from how did it get here you know
[17:37] what is this all about and now there's
[17:39] so many videos going on around
[17:42] the world people said listen people
[17:44] saying that and I want you to always
[17:46] just be very careful with the
[17:48] information that you receive oftentimes
[17:52] the information we receive is not
[17:54] verified by anybody and we're just
[17:56] taking it we just run with it and often
[17:58] terms if you're not aware but people can
[18:02] edit videos and make the videos say
[18:05] whatever they wanted to say and we take
[18:08] off just running with it the only source
[18:09] that we can trust is the Word of God
[18:11] amen it does not change so so before you
[18:15] just send up videos and send this out
[18:17] just just be careful sometimes it just
[18:19] all it does just just bring fear and all
[18:22] these other things the one thing we do
[18:24] know is that this is serious people's
[18:26] lives are impacted by it we don't know
[18:30] how it got here we don't know you know
[18:31] all of that but we trust that God will
[18:33] just keep us amen at a time like this
[18:35] and and and there are people Saints
[18:38] these are sinks that are being affected
[18:40] by so won't offer prayer amen for them
[18:43] and you know I think when when you see
[18:47] people that you know passing away you
[18:49] have a little bit more grace just you
[18:51] know stop saying things like if you
[18:52] wanted a blood if you if you had
[18:54] simulant you don't know we don't know we
[18:56] don't know nothing right and and all we
[18:59] know is that we're people that are
[19:00] impacted by something that has happened
[19:02] here on our earth so we pray for God's
[19:04] divine protection
[19:05] we pray for His mercy we pray for his
[19:08] grace and we pray that we continue to
[19:10] love one another in the midst of all it
[19:12] is so amen let's just have a word of
[19:14] Prayer for this family and this church
[19:16] is well amen there in South Carolina God
[19:19] knows them we'll just lift him My Father
[19:22] we just come before your presence Lord
[19:24] on behalf of this family this husband
[19:27] and wife that is going on with you some
[19:30] children are left behind wondering what
[19:33] they're going to do without their
[19:34] parents God a church has lost a
[19:37] tremendous faithful couple
[19:40] that it's been an amiss for years and
[19:42] God they need your direction they need
[19:44] your help so God we lift them up at this
[19:47] moment that you bring strength we
[19:49] understand that there might be some
[19:50] others in the church that's ineffective
[19:51] by this of God we just want to lift up
[19:54] that entire church because she'll be a
[19:56] fence a protection Lord stay the hand of
[20:00] the enemy God even in the midst of of
[20:04] Israel a plague struck but father there
[20:07] was something done that the hand of the
[20:09] enemy was stayed and God would just pray
[20:12] that he was state of hands of the enemy
[20:13] and Lord that the blood of Christ would
[20:15] be applied to each and every one and
[20:17] Lord that the death angel would pass and
[20:19] God that the rest would be spirit
[20:22] there's others Lord that we have heard
[20:24] about an overpass that just wasn't
[20:26] feeling well for 4 weeks and and God
[20:29] just didn't know what was going on and
[20:31] understand that his wife had to go to
[20:33] the hospital she was tested and and Lord
[20:35] they said it was positive for her and
[20:37] God just so many going through different
[20:39] things this this is real we don't know
[20:42] where it came from but we know it's a
[20:44] spirit from hell and we rebuke it now in
[20:46] the name of Jesus Lord and the Saints
[20:49] God Lord any time a symptom would come
[20:51] against one of these Saints
[20:53] we're rebuking the symptom right now in
[20:55] the name of Jesus and we prayed it to be
[20:57] a hedge of protection over each and
[21:00] every one God that you would just keep
[21:02] us and Father that you bring us through
[21:04] this season many are preparing to go
[21:06] back to work they don't know what
[21:08] they're gonna face when they get there
[21:09] on the job but be there protection or
[21:12] God has on previous shield around each
[21:15] one of God and just keep them during
[21:16] this time we know it was Satan's it's
[21:19] Satan's desire but still kill and
[21:21] destroy but God you said you came that
[21:23] we might have life and we might have it
[21:26] abundantly
[21:27] so Lord we pray that you bless us and
[21:29] that you would keep us some jesus name
[21:31] that we pray amen
[21:34] amen praise the Lord God bless you you
[21:36] can be seated in the presence of the
[21:38] Lord a man just got a few announcements
[21:42] to make and as we were preparing to make
[21:45] those announcements last week I believe
[21:47] sister Cherise had a song for us I hope
[21:50] she brought it this week with her a man
[21:53] but but let me just give the
[21:57] announcements first happy Mother's Day
[21:59] to all of our mothers a man will wish
[22:03] you all a very happy Mother's Day again
[22:05] thank God for you thank God we
[22:08] appreciate you and it meant just thank
[22:10] God for allowing you to see another
[22:12] Mother's Day as you all are aware things
[22:16] are starting to change here I believe
[22:19] there would be many that will be
[22:20] starting to go back to work on tomorrow
[22:22] and which is which is wonderful and it's
[22:27] something I've already started they're
[22:29] trying to phase us back into our normal
[22:32] routine and we're certainly grateful for
[22:34] all of that but what we are trying to do
[22:37] is just monitor everything before we
[22:39] just jump back into what we were doing
[22:42] here let's just kind of mileage the
[22:44] things we'll take things quite slow and
[22:46] but so for now we want to continue the
[22:49] way that we have been doing service we
[22:51] don't want to jump in too fast so just
[22:53] just bear with us there but this week
[22:56] we'll still do the virtual service a man
[22:59] on periscope and also on Facebook you
[23:06] can watch on Wednesday night and then
[23:08] our Sunday services will be virtual 9
[23:11] a.m. and 12:00 but will also continue
[23:13] our two groups the 9 a.m. and 12 p.m.
[23:15] group so and those that are watching
[23:17] virtually they can watch either
[23:20] periscope of Facebook Friday night so we
[23:22] won't have service a man right now will
[23:24] continue just a Wednesday and and the
[23:27] Sunday also just wanting to quickly make
[23:30] mention we are in the price
[23:33] of migrating from our church app that we
[23:37] have on our telephones or many of you
[23:39] all have the the app the company that we
[23:43] were using the app they were called my
[23:46] church at but they actually sold to the
[23:49] church app another company and and we
[23:52] are in the process of having to migrate
[23:54] off of my church app platform to the
[23:56] church app platform so I want to
[23:58] encourage everyone if you would on your
[24:00] phone just download the new app it's
[24:03] called the church app when you go to
[24:04] your App Store just look for the church
[24:07] app and you'll find spirit and truth
[24:09] Tabernacle you just put that in and then
[24:12] you'll see the new app you can just
[24:13] start getting acclimated to it we would
[24:16] love to get feedback from you if you see
[24:18] something that's not working or you know
[24:20] just anything just give us some feedback
[24:22] and we want to make sure that everybody
[24:24] has a comfortable experience as they
[24:25] move forward to the new app so what
[24:28] think we put a number of things there
[24:30] pretty much everything that was in the
[24:32] old app should be in the new app and if
[24:35] it's not there we aren't getting that
[24:36] over there for you
[24:37] and just just very grateful brother
[24:40] Quinton has been doing an excellent job
[24:41] of getting everything over so you always
[24:44] see a lot of his work there when you
[24:46] download it and we thank God for brother
[24:48] Quentin amen and all the work that he's
[24:50] done to make that happen so keep that in
[24:53] mind a man just started making for maybe
[24:56] your earliest convenience just get the
[24:58] church app on your phone so once you
[25:01] once we make the switchover you won't be
[25:02] left a man on the old platform as we
[25:07] pray we are giving this again just want
[25:08] to make mention that we do have the
[25:11] ability to give online we have two
[25:13] platforms we have PayPal we have cash
[25:16] app is a lot easier and cash app to give
[25:20] there are no fees there so if you do
[25:22] have cash yet we would encourage you to
[25:24] use that because there are no fees with
[25:26] PayPal you have to
[25:28] doing a very specific weight otherwise
[25:30] they will charge fees a man in the
[25:34] giving and we prefer not to give paypal
[25:36] the fees you know so if you want to give
[25:39] the cash out to use a man the church of
[25:42] symbol of at I mean a cash out spirit
[25:45] and truth tea spirit and truth tea for
[25:47] spirit of tabernacle if you are using
[25:50] PayPal we accident you can just you
[25:52] would use the option to send to a friend
[25:56] or family member if you choose that
[25:58] option the then you can donate with the
[26:00] email address of giving at John 4 to 3 0
[26:04] RG giving at John 4 to 3 that orgy and
[26:07] you can give your tithing offering

[42:18] fall and not arise shall he turn away
[42:24] and not return when then is this people
[42:32] of Jerusalem Sladen back by a perpetual
[42:37] backsliding they hope as deceit they
[42:46] refuse to return I hearken and heard but
[42:53] they spake not all right
[42:58] no man repented him of his wickedness
[43:03] saying what have I done
[43:08] everyone turned to his course as the
[43:14] horse rushes into battle let's go to
[43:19] Jeremiah the ninth chapter we're gonna
[43:24] read the fifth in the sixth verse
[43:31] Jeremiah the fifth and the sixth verse
[43:35] and they will deceive everyone his
[43:41] neighbour and will not speak the truth
[43:46] they have taught their tongues to speak
[43:49] lies and weary themselves to commit
[43:53] iniquity van inhabitation
[43:56] is in the midst of deceit through deceit
[44:01] they refuse to know me thus saith the
[44:04] Lord a man you may take your seats
[44:08] amen
[44:10] this morning a man I take a title of his
[44:16] message the great deception the great
[44:20] deception and we see how we know that
[44:26] Satan he he's a he's a slick fellow he
[44:33] is the master of deception I mean he
[44:37] knows just how to do it he's been doing
[44:39] it since the beginning amen
[44:47] we see that through the land now this
[44:53] great danger called a Kovac that's
[44:55] passing through and and everybody is on
[44:59] the front of their minds and right now
[45:03] is the the thing that we're going
[45:06] through amen but I think that there is a
[45:11] greater virus a man that's passing
[45:15] through the land and it's called
[45:17] deception a man a lack of understanding
[45:25] amen
[45:26] a rejection of the word amen the
[45:31] deception of this hour that we're living
[45:33] in they met people go on to and fro
[45:39] seeking knowledge but never coming into
[45:43] the knowledge of the truth amen and
[45:46] because of this great deception a man
[45:51] even a man persecution is in an
[45:58] endurable if is if it is understandable
[46:02] I'm gonna say that again even
[46:05] persecution isn't durable if it is
[46:10] understanding amen
[46:12] but the people of the world today in the
[46:14] midst of deceit because they refuse a
[46:18] man to know the Lord by the mess
[46:22] that he sit in this last day a man
[46:28] can find no comfort right they men right
[46:32] they can find no comfort amen
[46:36] the Bible says in Amos the eighth
[46:38] chapter in 11 verse behold the days to
[46:42] come
[46:43] saith the Lord God says that I will send
[46:47] a famine in the land they made not a
[46:50] famine for bread nor a thirst for water
[46:55] right got a famine for hearing the word
[46:58] of the Lord that's right amen they shall
[47:02] wandered from sea to sea and from the
[47:05] North even to the east and they shall
[47:09] run to and fro to seek the word of the
[47:12] Lord and shall not find it
[47:15] Amen this is the virus a man or the
[47:19] disease that's being spread Amen amongst
[47:23] the people in this last day it's called
[47:26] deception amen and this virus was put
[47:32] out too many years ago yes amen and it's
[47:36] traveled all through time yes Amen
[47:40] deceiving people to worship another god
[47:46] right amen
[47:48] and such a the Bible says here Daniel
[47:52] 11th
[47:53] chapter xxxii verse and such as to
[47:57] wickedly against the Covenant shall he
[48:01] corrupt by flattery but the people that
[48:06] do know their God shall do exploits and
[48:12] we see that in this day and time that so
[48:16] many are deceived by flatteries
[48:21] you can say to a person just have some
[48:26] sweet birds some nice words give a
[48:32] compliment or two yeah a men and you can
[48:36] you know suck them right into your whale
[48:39] we see the smooth talkers of this date
[48:43] of politicians and whoremongers false
[48:51] preachers amen the different was they
[48:56] are smooth talkers amen but their words
[49:01] are full of lies any man
[49:05] they come with flatteries they come they
[49:11] come a man with an agenda they meant to
[49:15] get you to believe and they decorate
[49:22] this lie and circle it around truth all
[49:26] right any man so we see where the spirit
[49:33] began in Genesis the Bible says that the
[49:37] serpent was the most subtle beast of the
[49:41] field he's the original slickster yes
[49:45] amen the Lord he said Genesis the third
[49:50] chapter said now the sermon was more
[49:52] subtle than any beast of the field which
[49:54] the Lord God in me and he said unto the
[49:58] woman yea hath God said ye shall not eat
[50:02] of every tree in the garden right and
[50:04] the one was said unto the serpent we may
[50:07] eat of the fruit of the trees of the
[50:10] garden but of the fruit of the tree
[50:13] which is in the midst of the garden God
[50:16] has said ye shall not eat neither shall
[50:22] ye touch it lest you die right now
[50:24] that's what the word says and the
[50:25] surface handle to the woman
[50:27] you shall not surely die for God do us
[50:31] no amen that in the day ye eat thereof
[50:36] then your eyes shall be opened all right
[50:41] and ye shall be as God's knowing good
[50:45] and evil yes and when the woman saw that
[50:50] the tree was good for food and that it
[50:55] was pleasant to the eyes and that the
[50:59] tree to be desired to make one wise she
[51:04] took of the fruit thereof and did eat
[51:06] and gave also to her husband with her
[51:11] and he did now I want you to notice
[51:14] there that the deception that in this in
[51:21] the story here that the deception came
[51:25] with the strong visual factor connected
[51:28] to it
[51:29] she see it says there that she saw that
[51:35] the tree was good for food and it was
[51:38] pleasant amen to the eyes good let me
[51:46] tell you something my brothers and
[51:47] sisters everything that look good ain't
[51:49] good I find a lot of times in nature the
[51:58] most colorful and prettiest creature the
[52:02] little bud has all of a bright yellows
[52:05] and the bright reds and the pretty
[52:08] colors stay away from number boys those
[52:13] are the most deadly amen out there they
[52:17] have a snake a man that's got the most
[52:20] prettiest red in black and yellow yeah
[52:25] one of the most poisonous little snakes
[52:28] around
[52:29] I think the story goes as red touch
[52:32] black you and okay jack but if red touch
[52:35] yelling you would dead fella all right
[52:38] my model will be all are you
[52:41] trying to wait to look at the red I
[52:46] didn't wait for all over tree them real
[52:50] and one of them is dead man that way I
[52:54] feel make no mistake I stay away from
[52:59] all of them but as we notice not as a
[53:02] strong attachment to the seat with our
[53:05] visual acuity it's all decorated nice
[53:38] and it's got the pretty colors with
[53:40] images hey man we just go for that all
[53:42] right
[53:43] weather in the beach there is a person
[53:46] personal deception a man is something
[53:49] that looks pleasant to the eye but
[53:51] underneath it's poisonous because mostly
[53:56] things that look closer to the eye we're
[53:59] talking world of things now ah hiding
[54:02] death amen
[54:04] heartache sorrow just beneath the
[54:09] surface and I stay with me I'm just
[54:12] building a platform right now we never
[54:14] get somewhere and it goes only Genesis
[54:18] dance says in the tree to be desired to
[54:20] make one wise so Eve not only she did
[54:25] she have a made an attraction through
[54:28] her eyes Amen now she she she began to
[54:33] lust for knowledge
[54:35] man she said well wait a minute now I
[54:37] gotta I got one up on that I can I can I
[54:42] just take this and I got some I can go
[54:44] back and tell you look what I did
[54:46] oh maybe don't doubt she thought that
[54:50] old man I'm proud of ya I'm glad you did
[54:53] see ma'am try not to get ahead of myself
[54:57] but get off my god she stepped out of
[55:02] her place
[55:04] she stepped out of her place we're gonna
[55:07] go into that a little bit more she took
[55:09] the fruit thereof and did eat and gave
[55:12] also to her husband to eat now after she
[55:18] ate the fruit she began to spread her
[55:22] newfound deception she began to spread
[55:27] it amen under ception of knowledge with
[55:31] others this is a pattern of how
[55:34] deception of death spread like a virus
[55:37] from one person to another
[55:40] right amen
[55:43] one person received false doctrine one
[55:47] person is deceived by one and then they
[55:50] go recruit somebody else
[55:53] person is deceit and it spreads like
[55:57] wildfire so it is a spirit a demonic
[56:06] spirit of deception that unknowingly
[56:14] they have taken now to call this spirit
[56:19] about what she was looking at yes but
[56:25] what she received she saw that it was
[56:31] good she was lusting with her eyes and
[56:37] took all the demonic spirits right that
[56:41] became contagious and she went to spread
[56:44] it amen stay with me
[56:50] and we know a man that the way God makes
[56:54] something let me back up I want to say
[57:00] something here the woman is the most
[57:05] deceivableness of the earth right now
[57:09] don't throw nothing but God meet her why
[57:23] because she was designed in such a way a
[57:29] man that she didn't have to have those
[57:33] type of defenses if she would have just
[57:37] simply my god I stayed in her place
[57:42] Adam was her protection that's right so
[57:47] it's not about her meaning she needed to
[57:53] do was the know her place
[57:58] to stay in the play she stepped out and
[58:02] she begins I guess I could say a Eve a
[58:07] man was the first woman preacher went
[58:12] back and shared that message with Adam
[58:15] she got out of the place right cause she
[58:20] received an evil spirit of deception
[58:26] received an evil spirit of deception now
[58:30] I'm not talking this ain't bubblegum ice
[58:32] cream I want you to really listen to the
[58:35] words that I'm seeing and we know that
[58:45] God doesn't make mistakes God makes
[58:47] something is always right the first time
[58:50] he didn't make a mistake with ease by
[58:53] designing the woman like that so there
[58:56] is a very good reason why God designed
[58:58] her that way and that is because she was
[59:03] not designed to have her own personal
[59:06] protection amen God designed her husband
[59:10] to be her protection right because the
[59:13] man was made in the image of God and God
[59:16] is reflecting himself and showing that
[59:20] demand showing his relationship with us
[59:24] because it is to be our headship man
[59:30] show me our relationship with our
[59:32] Heavenly Father
[59:34] right you see because if we stop from
[59:36] behind the word right amen we have no
[59:40] protection he was showing the tight
[59:45] there
[59:47] her husband man she had to stay
[59:52] fortified behind Adam amen to be
[59:55] protected and in this day an hour and
[59:58] then we have to be fortified the Word of
[1:00:04] God to be protected because there's a
[1:00:10] virus in the lair deception
[1:00:17] a literal demon not just the card cell
[1:00:22] right not just the phone demon
[1:00:26] possession of deception amen
[1:00:34] we look at all the spirit that was old
[1:00:39] Legion a man the Spade that was only
[1:00:45] j'en and man he was was brought up in
[1:00:51] the service this morning that no doubt
[1:00:53] he was a good fellow started off pretty
[1:00:55] good but along the way he meant
[1:01:02] something happened what he received a
[1:01:06] demonic spirit a man that caused him to
[1:01:12] take off his clothes caused him to just
[1:01:18] tormented this young man was tormented
[1:01:22] by demonic spirits and didn't know how
[1:01:27] to go free
[1:01:28] yeah a lot of us today I'm tormented the
[1:01:33] demon experience in your heart you want
[1:01:38] to go free in your heart you know it but
[1:01:46] you can't shake that devil you need a
[1:01:50] supernatural Italian
[1:01:54] amen hey you need a supernatural in town
[1:01:59] amen to be delivered amen
[1:02:03] from that demon oppression call it what
[1:02:08] it is that's exactly what it is my
[1:02:09] brothers and sisters it's not a concept
[1:02:12] it's not just the built authorities
[1:02:15] demonic possession and if you're not
[1:02:20] careful that demon will take you
[1:02:23] straight to hell say that he come to
[1:02:27] kill steal and destroy he would destroy
[1:02:30] your life everything that God has for
[1:02:35] you he will destroy it
[1:02:39] amen it's the demonic spirit amen
[1:02:44] Eve's protection against the deception
[1:02:49] was her headship amen
[1:02:55] she had she had the capacity she didn't
[1:02:59] have the capacity within herself so the
[1:03:01] first little trick the devil came and
[1:03:04] played on her she fell for it hook line
[1:03:07] and sinker if she'd had just stayed
[1:03:12] behind her Hitchin instead of trying to
[1:03:15] reason things in herself then the Fallen
[1:03:20] Eden could have never taken place
[1:03:23] we don't reason with the word we take it
[1:03:28] just as it is don't reason with it
[1:03:31] amen thank you Lord in the last thing
[1:03:37] this last day thank you my brother
[1:03:40] appreciate it
[1:03:41] Eve amen let me let me say it this way
[1:03:50] this last day Eve cannot be to see that
[1:03:53] amen
[1:03:56] it's not because God has changed her
[1:03:59] makeup or the woman has given her own
[1:04:03] ability to defend herself or withstand
[1:04:05] deception that's not what happened
[1:04:08] but because she has come into a correct
[1:04:12] position of her headship in this hour
[1:04:18] and that's Christ the word she has
[1:04:23] forsaken her own reasoning and has taken
[1:04:27] on the mind of Christ by the revelation
[1:04:30] of the word Bible says in Matthew 24 and
[1:04:35] 24 for there shall arise false Christ's
[1:04:39] and false prophets and shall show great
[1:04:42] signs and wonders and so much that if it
[1:04:46] were possible it was possible they shall
[1:04:53] deceive the very elect thank God it's
[1:04:56] not possible we are easily deceived my
[1:05:02] brothers and sisters when we have part
[1:05:04] truth right but because when the whole
[1:05:08] truth is revealed and then that actually
[1:05:13] uncovers deception amen when the whole
[1:05:17] truth of the gospel is laid it covers
[1:05:23] all of the devil's tricks any meaning
[1:05:26] I'm thankful in this hour that he's been
[1:05:28] exposed all of the devil's schemes and
[1:05:32] tricks have been exposed and then we're
[1:05:35] going to go through some of them this
[1:05:37] morning and then and to show you that
[1:05:40] it's a demonic spirit amen
[1:05:46] there's so much talk a man in this day
[1:05:50] and hour about mental health mental
[1:05:54] health what is mental health what is
[1:05:58] mental health mental health is demonic
[1:06:01] oppression
[1:06:03] depression and possession all right
[1:06:06] that's mental health it's demonic
[1:06:12] oppression depression and posesión under
[1:06:19] that umbrella it's mental health right
[1:06:21] that's all it is but in science they
[1:06:25] name it mental health it's demonic
[1:06:30] oppression depression and pose it I
[1:06:39] don't care what kind of peeling how long
[1:06:44] they talk to you it's not gonna catch
[1:06:48] that won't work you'll just give you a
[1:06:57] false sense of security and you go on
[1:06:59] and pick up another dill Church say man
[1:07:07] some of them recently one of the most
[1:07:10] very famous fashion designer woman
[1:07:17] committed suicide in worldly terms she
[1:07:23] had everything money popularity she was
[1:07:31] worth millions but took her own life she
[1:07:37] suffered from mental health demonic
[1:07:45] oppression depression and possession
[1:07:50] that's what she suffer from
[1:07:54] that caused her even she had millions of
[1:07:58] dollars very successful and she took her
[1:08:04] own life so what is that demon trying to
[1:08:09] do to you
[1:08:10] he is trying to get you into a place
[1:08:15] through those demonic spirits to where
[1:08:19] you say there's no I just was you this
[1:09:30] is the reason for this spiritual
[1:10:22] deception we crazy that you so many of
[1:10:38] them possessed by a devil
[1:10:40] they see one that's not possessed by the
[1:10:42] devil and they take some role to amen
[1:10:50] people of the world are totally ignorant
[1:10:54] about many demonic spirits that they
[1:10:57] expose themselves to we say that again
[1:11:00] they are totally ignorant about demon
[1:11:04] experience that they exposed themselves
[1:11:06] to and give access to because of the
[1:11:10] things that they're viewing and feeding
[1:11:14] on now remember Eve it was pleasant to
[1:11:18] the eye so what you watch what you

[1:27:28] they doubled that's this blue prophecy
[1:27:31] because it was a hairy back what you
[1:27:34] think in you what you thinking do that
[1:27:38] causes you to do that if you could only
[1:27:43] see it's a demon a demon that is
[1:27:55] compelling you just like Legion to take

[1:28:19] yourself like one he has something so
[1:28:23] much better for you but if you continue
[1:28:25] in that way he's going to destroy you
[1:28:31] Bible says in Proverbs the sixteenth
[1:28:34] chapter 16 verses how much better reason
[1:28:38] to get wisdom then go and to get
[1:28:41] understanding
[1:28:42] they made rather to be chosen than
[1:28:46] silver amen you see it is good to have
[1:28:52] silver and gold but wisdom is far better
[1:28:54] you can lose your money amen
[1:28:59] but when wisdom is given to you by God
[1:29:02] then that is a very source of wealth
[1:29:05] we're talking about the great deception
[1:29:09] amen
[1:29:11] job lost all his silver and all his gold
[1:29:16] but he never lost his wisdom amen and in
[1:29:21] the end he became twice as wealthy as he
[1:29:25] did before but if you don't have wisdom
[1:29:29] and you lose your money then there is no
[1:29:32] good chance you'll lose it permanently
[1:29:35] amen
[1:29:38] same boats Chuck hour 17 says the
[1:29:42] highway of the uprightness to depart
[1:29:44] from evil he that keepeth his ways his
[1:29:47] way preserved with his soul a person
[1:29:50] that maintains his position in the way
[1:29:53] of truth a man and righteousness the
[1:29:58] eighteenth verse says pride goeth before
[1:30:00] destruction and a haughty spirit before
[1:30:03] a fall
[1:30:07] amen
[1:30:10] that's what's becoming this age my
[1:30:12] brothers and sisters a haughty spirit
[1:30:17] amen
[1:30:19] Hollywood has produced a mass deception
[1:30:25] amen a mass deception to television amen
[1:30:30] better it was to have a humble spirit
[1:30:33] and lowly then to divide the sport with
[1:30:37] the proud better to have a humble spirit
[1:30:42] proverbs 16:18 19 verse better to have a
[1:30:47] humble spirit but with the lowly than to
[1:30:51] divide the spoils with the proud now I
[1:30:53] want to
[1:30:58] get into something we're talking about
[1:31:03] let's see here a man in the book of
[1:31:09] Ephesians the fourth chapter the first
[1:31:16] verse amen
[1:31:25] amen the book of Ephesians first verses
[1:31:31] therefore the prisoner of the Lord
[1:31:35] beseech you that ye walk worthy of the
[1:31:41] vocation wherewith you were called
[1:31:44] now the word beseech means I beg you to
[1:31:52] walk worthy that ye walk worthy of the
[1:31:56] vocation wherewith ye were called now
[1:32:01] that were vocation that word vocation
[1:32:07] definition
[1:32:09] says a monk defines a calling by the
[1:32:14] will of God or a bestow men of God's
[1:32:19] distinguishing grace upon a person or a
[1:32:24] nation by which a person or a nation is
[1:32:27] put in the way of salvation amen as the
[1:32:32] vocation of the Jews under the old
[1:32:35] dispensation of the Gentiles under the
[1:32:37] gospel amen
[1:32:38] another another another definition says
[1:32:41] a type of employment your vocation could
[1:32:45] be a lot like your calling your
[1:32:47] occupation your trade it is your
[1:32:49] vocation right so we're talking about
[1:32:52] here where Eve was was possessed and how
[1:32:58] our position a man comes by a lack of
[1:33:03] understanding amen a lack of
[1:33:05] understanding because Eve got from
[1:33:08] behind the Word of God amen but see Paul
[1:33:11] here he says I beg you
[1:33:13] amen that ye walk worthy of your
[1:33:16] vacation your calling amen because see
[1:33:20] the Bride of Christ in this day amen she
[1:33:23] knows her position yes amen she's being
[1:33:26] a man positionally placed a man
[1:33:30] understanding that her calling an
[1:33:32] election assure a men that she our
[1:33:36] instance
[1:33:37] sustained now see these scriptures are
[1:33:39] have compound meaning there's a natural
[1:33:41] calling a man of positioning in the
[1:33:45] natural but that's also from the bride
[1:33:47] of Jesus Christ amen which is the evil
[1:33:50] this time a man has a spiritual placing
[1:33:54] any man fortified behind the headship of
[1:33:59] a man huh God yes amen
[1:34:03] we have been called amen to the marriage
[1:34:06] supper of the Lamb
[1:34:08] amen the Bible says here we want to look
[1:34:12] at this little star here in Luke 14
[1:34:15] where he says Dean said heel to him a
[1:34:20] certain man made a great supper and bade
[1:34:23] many amen and he said to his servant
[1:34:26] at supper time to say to them that were
[1:34:31] bidden come for all things are now ready
[1:34:36] and they all with one constant began to
[1:34:43] make excuses the first set up to him I
[1:34:47] have bought a piece of ground and have
[1:34:50] me to go see it

[1:34:58] oxen and I go to prove them and I pray
[1:35:02] that I may be excused and the other set
[1:35:06] I have Maddie wife and therefore I
[1:35:09] cannot come so the servant came and
[1:35:13] showed his Lord these things then the
[1:35:16] master of the house began begin being
[1:35:19] angry said up to the servant go out
[1:35:22] quickly into the streets and to the
[1:35:25] lanes and to the cities and bring me

[1:36:01] servant I command him Lord that dad's
[1:36:04] room and the Lord said unto the servant
[1:36:06] go out into the highways and hedges and
[1:36:09] compel them to come in that my house may
[1:36:12] be filled and I say unto you that I say
[1:36:17] unto you that none of those men which
[1:36:20] are being bitter bidding that were
[1:36:23] bidden shall taste of my son and then
[1:36:26] when a great multitude with him and he
[1:36:28] turned unto them a man if any man come

[1:54:27] praise sneaking by his word that goodbye
[1:54:31] speaking to our hearts let's give the
[1:54:34] name of the Lord
[1:54:36] you know what was that 2001 I believe
[1:54:44] where we had the towers go down and and
[1:54:49] when that kind of struck it just sent so
[1:54:53] many people here in the u.s. back to the
[1:54:55] Bible stores and man Walmart couldn't
[1:54:58] keep Bibles on the Shelf because
[1:55:00] everybody was was trying to trying to
[1:55:03] get into work trying to get in a word
[1:55:04] you know find out you know what was
[1:55:05] going on and a new prophecies were being
[1:55:08] fulfilled and just didn't know what was
[1:55:10] happening and uh you know over time the
[1:55:12] people just begin to let down the bars
[1:55:14] and they got right back into the same
[1:55:17] routine of life
[1:55:19] they drew rather than closer to God they
[1:55:22] start drawing away from God and here we
[1:55:24] are in in 2020 amen and we're dealing
[1:55:30] with this Co at 19 and something where
[1:55:32] in the entire world the entire world was
[1:55:34] shut down entire world is impacted not
[1:55:37] just one nation but an entire world the
[1:55:39] whole planet and you find people again
[1:55:42] trying to get closer to God trying to
[1:55:43] get closer to God but now it's really
[1:55:45] preparing to open back up and and what I
[1:55:48] find amazing is that it's not just the
[1:55:50] u.s. opening up when we make
[1:55:52] announcements it seem like everybody
[1:55:53] else start doing the exact same thing
[1:55:55] and the whole world is trying to get
[1:55:57] back to where it used to be but I wonder
[1:55:59] if if we're going back amen the same way
[1:56:02] they did in 2001 when a man Li wen
[1:56:06] when we had the the twin towers go down
[1:56:09] when we are that that's if we don't
[1:56:12] watch if we don't watch it we'll find my
[1:56:14] cells doing the same thing again
[1:56:15] repeating the same mistakes rather than
[1:56:17] drawing closer to God we're drawing
[1:56:19] further away from God I thank God that
[1:56:21] God would send us the work that calls us
[1:56:23] to check ourselves a man it's time for a
[1:56:25] checkup
[1:56:26] praise the Lord it's time for a checkup
[1:56:28] we don't want to draw Amen away from God
[1:56:31] we want to draw closer to God I pray
[1:56:32] this is something that would speak to
[1:56:34] hearts no matter where you are praying
[1:56:36] is something that would challenge you a
[1:56:37] man goddess God is meaning business with
[1:56:41] people today man it's time to go home
[1:56:44] and we don't have much longer church but
[1:56:46] we need to be right we need to be ready
[1:56:48] to go so any spirit that would have me
[1:56:51] bound I would want to be free from it I
[1:56:53] don't want no chains holding me no
[1:56:57] chains holding me Father we thank you
[1:57:01] for your word that has come forward
[1:57:02] today this great deception Lourdes it's
[1:57:07] even worse than the virus the people
[1:57:10] deceived to think that they are right
[1:57:12] with you the thing that everything is is
[1:57:15] good God is a great deception they look
[1:57:18] they don't realize what it takes to
[1:57:20] please you they don't know you're
[1:57:21] worried
[1:57:21] they don't understand God that how you
[1:57:23] want them to walk and how you want them
[1:57:25] to live in
[1:57:26] God how you want them to act and react

[1:57:30] we can't bring sacrifices the way that
[1:57:33] Cain brought sacrifices and expect you
[1:57:35] to accept them but Lord we must come the
[1:57:38] way that you've called us so I pray Lord
[1:57:40] that the light was shined into the
[1:57:42] hearts of the people they would
[1:57:43] recognize Lord that just speaking to him
[1:57:46] even through the midst of this pandemic

[1:57:58] of their way and allow you to use his
[1:58:00] lips to Lord bring a word of correction
