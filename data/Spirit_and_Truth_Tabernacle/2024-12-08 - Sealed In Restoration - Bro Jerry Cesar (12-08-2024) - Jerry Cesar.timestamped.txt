[48:21] me okay all right well we'll we'll get
[48:24] there um but I know it's some that he
[48:27] looked over the vanister time and
[48:29] probably just up there in heaven
[48:30] rejoicing uh watching how things went
[48:33] off on last weekend but uh everyone in
[48:36] their respective places I mean spirit
[48:38] and truth you all were all over the
[48:40] place amen from
[48:43] um praise the Lord um it was
[48:47] coordination of getting the church uh

[48:54] and um and then brother brother Jam took
[48:57] care of the repass uh getting that all

[49:48] people coming here for the uh the homeg
[49:51] goinging service and uh when you have it
[49:54] like that the purpose that the people
[49:57] were coming was to uh celebrate the life
[50:00] of brother Wesker who has impacted most
[50:03] of our Lives amen but uh so we kind of
[50:07] talked some things over with the
[50:08] brothers and we just felt it would be
[50:09] appropriate to have the combined service
[50:12] with uh Rapture and Faith so that we
[50:14] didn't
[50:16] split keep Lo losing all right is it
[50:21] me y'all can hear me just I I I it just

[50:34] and have some going there and some
[50:35] coming here we want just bring everybody
[50:38] together and have a service and uh last

[57:00] worthy of your praise this morning is
[57:02] that right amen hallelujah you all in
[57:06] the precious name of the Lord Jesus
[57:08] Christ and uh sister if you don't mind
[57:11] if you could just uh play a little the
[57:12] chorus of that song Amen uh that you was
[57:16] playing earlier the
[57:18] blessing uh just want to want to just
[57:21] greet you all this morning precious name
[57:22] of Jesus Christ um I'm certainly blessed
[57:26] back there to hear the worship of the
[57:28] Saints and you know it's really hard to
[57:30] stay back there and be still when you
[57:32] guys are singing like
[57:34] that uh but as brother Jack was singing
[57:37] that song uh just want to read a
[57:39] scripture uh this wasn't plan but it
[57:43] just ministered to my heart in such a
[57:45] [Music]
[57:50] way and uh the scripture is in uh 2
[57:53] Corinthians uh chapter 1
[57:57] verse
[57:58] 20 and it reads for all the promises of
[58:02] God in him are yay in him amen unto the
[58:08] glory of God by us now what this means
[58:12] to me it was kind of personal
[58:16] because you realize when you have a need
[58:19] you have somebody that stands ready to
[58:22] answer and every promise that you read
[58:25] you can say Amen into it every promise
[58:28] in the word is your personal property
[58:31] every promise belongs to
[58:33] you so I want to thank God this morning
[58:36] for that and and you know uh as a as a
[58:40] minister of this message I'm very
[58:43] grateful uh to be before you and you
[58:45] know when you study uh to bring forth
[58:47] the word we we study a little different
[58:50] from the theologians and the scholars
[58:53] right uh we don't necessarily study to
[58:55] gain more knowledge but we studied to
[58:57] try to find a mind of God you see I
[59:01] believe the scripture says let this mind
[59:04] that was in Christ be in you and that's
[59:07] what we try to find the mind of God so
[59:10] that we can bring out a revelation and
[59:13] identity to his
[59:15] people so as we uh step into his word I
[59:18] I just pray that you all will gather
[59:20] with me to enter into his mind this
[59:22] morning that we may tap into the things
[59:25] that belong to us
[59:26] praise the Lord and so I just ask that
[59:29] you guys all turn with me
[59:33] to 1
[59:34] Corinthians verse uh chapter
[59:37] 1 verse 22 we'll read a few verses

[1:00:35] am praise the Lord now it
[1:00:39] reads uh 1 Corinthians chapter 1 verse
[1:00:45] 22
[1:00:49] amen it reads for the Jews require a
[1:00:52] sign and the Greeks seek after wisdom
[1:00:57] but we preach Christ crucified unto the
[1:01:00] Jews a stumbling block and unto the
[1:01:02] Greeks foolishness but unto them which
[1:01:05] are called both Jews and Greeks Christ
[1:01:09] the power of God and the wisdom of God
[1:01:13] because the foolishness of God is wiser
[1:01:15] than men and the weakness of God is
[1:01:18] stronger than men for ye see your
[1:01:21] calling Brethren how that not many wise
[1:01:24] men after the flesh not many mighty not
[1:01:26] many noble are called but God has chosen
[1:01:30] the foolish things of this world to
[1:01:32] confound the wise and God has chosen the
[1:01:35] weak things of the world to confound the
[1:01:38] things which are Mighty praise the Lord
[1:01:40] let us also turn to
[1:01:42] Ephesians 1 verse 13 and
[1:01:49] 14 amen and it reads in whom ye also
[1:01:54] trusted after that that ye heard the
[1:01:56] word of Truth The Gospel of your
[1:01:59] salvation in whom also after that ye
[1:02:03] believed ye were sealed with that Holy
[1:02:06] Spirit of Promise which is the earnest
[1:02:09] of our inheritance until the Redemption
[1:02:11] of the purchased possession unto the
[1:02:14] praise of his glory praise the Lord now
[1:02:16] I want you to know Earnest is the very
[1:02:20] down payment of what you already possess
[1:02:23] praise the Lord and one more scripture
[1:02:25] in Ephesians Ians 4:30 we're all
[1:02:28] familiar with this
[1:02:29] scripture and grieve not the holy spirit
[1:02:32] of God whereby ye are sealed until the
[1:02:36] day of
[1:02:37] redemption let us
[1:02:39] pray Heavenly Father Lord we count it a
[1:02:43] great honor and privilege this morning

[1:02:48] prayer this morning is that you would

[1:03:23] promises once more Lord that you would
[1:03:26] pour out your spirit Lord upon us where

[1:03:41] Lord may they receive a word in due
[1:03:43] season oh God and Lord we pray that that

[1:03:49] you the praise the honor and the glory
[1:03:51] amen amen you all may have your
[1:03:54] seats may the Lord add a blessing to his
[1:03:58] reading amen praise the
[1:04:02] Lord so we read in 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:04:07] 1 um and uh the the scripture says the
[1:04:12] God has chosen the weak things of the
[1:04:15] world to confound the things which are
[1:04:17] Mighty so I want you to know this
[1:04:20] morning that if you are a chosen of God
[1:04:22] God has chosen you this morning and if
[1:04:26] you feel weak this morning I want you to
[1:04:28] know you are the weakness of God all
[1:04:30] right I want you to know that God can
[1:04:32] use you to defeat the things that are
[1:04:35] Mighty is that right you are the
[1:04:38] weakness of God praise the
[1:04:40] Lord now you may be called all kind of
[1:04:43] names but the prophet says who are you a
[1:04:46] fool to you're either a fool to the
[1:04:48] world or a fool to the God right I
[1:04:51] rather be a to God's kingdom amen so God
[1:04:54] has used a coolest things to confound
[1:04:57] the wise and we thank him this morning
[1:04:59] for that praise the Lord so as a title
[1:05:03] this morning I just want to just want to
[1:05:05] use uh sealed in restoration sealed in
[1:05:10] restoration and we certainly thank God
[1:05:12] for the for this theme of restoration
[1:05:15] and our pastor just giving us the series
[1:05:17] of getting back and step and and just
[1:05:20] finding ways and how I can uh uh step in
[1:05:23] the same channel and maybe God would
[1:05:25] inspire me and and and it's hard not to
[1:05:27] be inspired when you're receiving the
[1:05:29] word in that manner praise the Lord so I
[1:05:34] want to start off with this quote here
[1:05:36] the prophet speaks this in the Seal of
[1:05:38] Christ preached in 55 0312 he says the
[1:05:42] sign of the believer is the fruits of
[1:05:44] the spirit right and the fruits of the
[1:05:46] spirit is not seeing visions not Healing
[1:05:49] The Sick not speaking with tongues not
[1:05:51] shouting the fruits of the spirit is
[1:05:53] love joy peace
[1:05:56] longsuffering goodness meekness
[1:05:58] gentleness patience amen that's the Seal
[1:06:02] of God and I want you know the word of
[1:06:04] God produces the fruit of the spirit in
[1:06:07] your life so there means there has to be
[1:06:10] a surrender to the word of God Amen
[1:06:13] somebody praise the Lord so this morning
[1:06:16] we want to talk about the Seal of God
[1:06:19] and what it means to be sealed we also
[1:06:21] want to connect that to being restored
[1:06:24] praise the Lord now a ceiling can be a
[1:06:27] signature a Bonafide statement a ceiling
[1:06:31] shows uh when when something's been
[1:06:33] sealed it shows there's no way in and
[1:06:35] there's no way out a ceiling shows that
[1:06:38] the product has been finished it shows
[1:06:40] that the product has reached a place of
[1:06:43] perfection it knows that it can stand a
[1:06:45] test amen now a ceiling also testifies
[1:06:49] that the product has reached a place of
[1:06:52] maturity right where it can handle a
[1:06:54] little bit more responsibility
[1:06:56] and it can stand the test praise the
[1:06:58] Lord a ceiling shows that the finished
[1:07:00] work cannot be compromised changed or
[1:07:04] undone yes M say it again a ceiling
[1:07:07] shows that the finished work cannot be
[1:07:09] compromised changed or undone amen now
[1:07:13] I'm reminded over 4,000 years ago death
[1:07:16] was a seal that was Final finished and
[1:07:19] complete but on that day of Calvary
[1:07:22] praise the Lord the seals of death was
[1:07:25] broken
[1:07:26] amen I believe brother Mark read that
[1:07:28] and he says this was uh one of the uh
[1:07:30] more prominent scriptures in Matthew 28
[1:07:33] but when he rose up again that broke the
[1:07:36] seals of death am cuz he did something
[1:07:40] that never been done before amen praise
[1:07:43] the Lord and I want you to know that
[1:07:45] when he when he rose up again he he
[1:07:47] broke the seals of death but he also
[1:07:50] sealed something and we'll get into that
[1:07:52] a little later praise the Lord
[1:07:55] now a seal also is a mystery that
[1:07:59] unfolds it's a mystery that unfolds a
[1:08:03] seal is also to loose the ministry it's
[1:08:07] to loose the ministry praise the Lord to
[1:08:11] loose is to permit or authorize
[1:08:14] something by in an indisputable
[1:08:16] Authority I'm going say it again to lose
[1:08:19] is permitting or authorizing something
[1:08:22] by an indisputable Authority when
[1:08:25] something is indisputable it means
[1:08:28] there's no error there's no mistake
[1:08:31] there's no guilt there's no shame praise
[1:08:34] the Lord there's no questioning it it's
[1:08:36] finished praise the Lord amen in
[1:08:38] Colossians 2:9 it says for in him
[1:08:42] dwelleth the fullness of God of the
[1:08:44] godhead bodily deity and ye that means
[1:08:48] you are the are complete in him which is
[1:08:52] the head of all principality and Power
[1:08:55] yes John
[1:08:57] 16:7 Jesus speaks this word here he says
[1:09:00] nevertheless I tell you the truth it is
[1:09:03] expedient that I go away for if I go not
[1:09:06] away the comforter that's the
[1:09:09] indisputable Authority it's the
[1:09:11] comforter it's the Holy Ghost in you if
[1:09:14] I go not away then he will not come but
[1:09:17] it's expedient that I go away so that he
[1:09:19] can dwell where in you that's the
[1:09:22] indisputable dwelling in you praise the
[1:09:25] Lord hallelujah Christ saw that it was
[1:09:30] necessary for him to multiply himself in
[1:09:32] you that's right and the reason why that
[1:09:34] was necessary to loose the ministry wow
[1:09:38] the ministry of reconciliation the
[1:09:40] ministry of
[1:09:42] restoration it was able to be loosed in
[1:09:45] continuation in you amen praise the Lord
[1:09:48] right and by this indisputable Authority
[1:09:52] you have the right to claim your family
[1:09:54] you have the right to claim your loved
[1:09:56] ones you have the right to claim your
[1:09:58] healing you have the right to claim your
[1:10:01] Victory amen indisputable Authority
[1:10:05] praise the Lord glory
[1:10:08] amen now you guys all over the say all
[1:10:10] heard the saying you can lock the door
[1:10:13] throw away the keys what your ceiling
[1:10:15] Christ holds the door he holds the lock
[1:10:18] and he holds the keys he is the door and
[1:10:21] he is the lock and he is the keys to
[1:10:24] your salvation praise the Lord glj and
[1:10:27] lastly a seal forces a decision it
[1:10:31] forces the issue and we'll get into that
[1:10:34] a little later as well praise the
[1:10:37] Lord now I'm going to read a quote here
[1:10:40] in the message I am the resurrection and
[1:10:42] the life in paragraph 73 the prophet
[1:10:45] says he was a man when he cried up there
[1:10:48] at Calvary my God why hast Thou forsaken
[1:10:53] me he died like a man but on Easter
[1:10:56] morning he rose breaking the seals of
[1:10:58] death corruption rising to ascend to the
[1:11:01] to the father above showing that he was
[1:11:04] more than a man he was God in flesh
[1:11:07] believes thou this praise the Lord
[1:11:10] hallelujah and you know I I have a I
[1:11:12] have a a wonderful time with the
[1:11:14] Jehovah's Witness on this because they
[1:11:16] they seem to love my house they come and
[1:11:18] knock almost every morning and I almost
[1:11:21] expect him now and and sometimes I have
[1:11:23] to leave work just to speak to him but
[1:11:25] recently I spoke to him and I I told him
[1:11:28] you know very nice lady and I says ma'am
[1:11:31] I agree with almost everything you agree
[1:11:33] with in your word but you cannot take
[1:11:36] God and chop him up in three pieces all
[1:11:39] right and I told her that's the only one
[1:11:40] of the only things that I have fought
[1:11:42] have fought with is that you make God
[1:11:45] the father and God the son two separate
[1:11:49] entities and I was like you can't do
[1:11:51] that and then I just I was like I don't
[1:11:54] want to waste your time I don't want to
[1:11:55] waste my time uh but uh we can cut this
[1:11:59] very short because uh your partner one
[1:12:02] of your partners came some time ago and
[1:12:05] I showed him some things and he couldn't
[1:12:06] answer them right so I was like you know
[1:12:08] we we we'll we we'll do this another
[1:12:10] time all right so we thank God for that
[1:12:13] the revelation of his word Glory now God
[1:12:17] broke the seals of death he did he did
[1:12:20] this when he went to jer's daughter and
[1:12:22] he says jarus daughter is not dead but
[1:12:25] she's just sleeping amen so the seals of
[1:12:29] death was broken right there he broke
[1:12:31] the seals of death with Lazarus when he
[1:12:34] said Lazarus come forth right something
[1:12:37] that's never been done praise the Lord
[1:12:40] so we thank God for that now the prophet
[1:12:42] says here in the message The Works that
[1:12:45] I do uh bear witness of me he says
[1:12:48] remember little children I don't care
[1:12:50] what church you belong to or what you
[1:12:52] have done how well you've done this that
[1:12:55] or the other how much you've put into
[1:12:58] the collection plates or if you're a
[1:13:00] deacon preacher Pastor or lay member or
[1:13:02] whatever it is you'll never come into
[1:13:04] the kingdom of God until the Holy Spirit
[1:13:07] has sealed you in the Kingdom by his
[1:13:10] Divine love that the whole Christian
[1:13:13] world is your brother and sister that's
[1:13:16] right the world sealed out and God is
[1:13:19] sealed in when you love one another
[1:13:22] truly with Divine Christian love that's
[1:13:24] right then you know the Holy Spirit
[1:13:27] really is working through you then
[1:13:29] that's right then by their fruits you
[1:13:31] shall know them amen praise the lord
[1:13:33] it's important to love your brothers and
[1:13:35] sisters believe brother Quinton says we
[1:13:37] thank God uh said this this morning in
[1:13:39] his prayer he said we thank God that we
[1:13:40] can just be called Christians when we go
[1:13:42] to work when we go to school the the the
[1:13:45] very fact that we have to bear the name
[1:13:47] of Christ puts us in a different
[1:13:49] category it makes us not only redeemable
[1:13:53] but we become we become um uh uh able to
[1:13:57] redeem others through the life that we
[1:13:59] live praise God sir Glory now I want to
[1:14:03] turn to acts
[1:14:06] uh chapter 3 here verse 19 and I want to
[1:14:10] talk a little bit
[1:14:12] about Peter uh now Peter was was was was
[1:14:16] a very unique
[1:14:18] individual uh he certainly had a bold a
[1:14:22] bold Faith uh but but he also got
[1:14:25] himself in trouble with that um but we
[1:14:27] want to look into a little bit of his
[1:14:29] life and we pick him up here in Acts 3:
[1:14:32] 19 and these are the words that that he
[1:14:36] spoke he says repent ye therefore and be
[1:14:40] converted that your sins may be blotted
[1:14:43] out when the times of refreshing shall
[1:14:46] come from the presence of the Lord yes
[1:14:49] sir and he shall stand uh and he shall
[1:14:51] send Jesus Christ which before you was
[1:14:54] preached unto to you whom the heavens
[1:14:56] must receive until the times of
[1:14:59] restitution of all things which God has
[1:15:02] spoken by the mouth of his holy prophets
[1:15:05] since the world began and I can tell you
[1:15:07] Church we've been experiencing the times
[1:15:09] of refreshing with this word with the
[1:15:13] inspiration that's been given to our
[1:15:14] pastor of getting back in Step it is the
[1:15:17] time of refreshing and when the time was
[1:15:19] refreshing is nigh don't let it pass you
[1:15:22] by Praise the Lord cuz God has a word
[1:15:25] for you yes sir amen and Peter goes on
[1:15:27] to say uh whom the heavens must receive
[1:15:30] until the times of restitution of all
[1:15:33] things so there's a time where there
[1:15:36] there's a restoration of all things uh
[1:15:40] not just a Redemption of your life but a
[1:15:42] restoration of the things that matter to
[1:15:45] you the things that God has purposed in
[1:15:47] your life the gifts the callings those
[1:15:50] things belong to you more importantly
[1:15:53] the gifts of the Spirit amen Belong To
[1:15:55] You Right amen amen and now just talking
[1:16:00] a little bit about
[1:16:02] Peter now Peter was one that uh I
[1:16:06] believe last time I went through his
[1:16:08] life when I was here I spoke on how he
[1:16:11] denied Christ three times and before
[1:16:13] doing
[1:16:14] so before doing so uh he he he he spoke
[1:16:19] on the table and he says uh when Christ
[1:16:21] says one of you will deny me Christ says
[1:16:23] I'll go to prison for you you right um I
[1:16:26] I that will not do no no such thing I he
[1:16:29] was so convinced that he would not deny
[1:16:31] him Christ says before morning even
[1:16:34] comes you will deny me three times you
[1:16:38] see now I appreciate Peter's Faith but
[1:16:41] there was a spoken word he could not
[1:16:43] speak that he could not go against um
[1:16:47] and it had to come to pass but you know
[1:16:50] going through that what God was allowing
[1:16:53] Peter to go through
[1:16:55] was not uh to experience a setback but
[1:16:58] it was really a setup all right God was
[1:17:00] setting Peter up for something greater
[1:17:03] than himself he was setting Peter up for
[1:17:05] something that he didn't even see or
[1:17:08] understand and because Peter did not
[1:17:10] understand this we pick him up in John
[1:17:13] 21 we find that Peter desire Peter is is
[1:17:17] is now Desiring to go back to what he
[1:17:20] used to do right you see uh we picked
[1:17:22] this up in John 21 verse one he says
[1:17:26] after these
[1:17:28] things Jesus showed himself again to the
[1:17:31] disciples at the Sea of
[1:17:34] tiberias and on this wise showed he
[1:17:38] himself there were together Simon Peter
[1:17:41] and Thomas called dimus and Nathaniel of
[1:17:44] Canaan and Galilee and the sons of
[1:17:47] Zebedee and two other of his disciples
[1:17:50] and Peter of course as the spokesman
[1:17:52] saith unto him to to them I go fishing
[1:17:57] they said unto him we also go with thee
[1:17:59] so shows you the kind of character Peter
[1:18:01] had the influence he had on those
[1:18:03] disciples I go with thee they went forth
[1:18:06] and entered into a ship immediately and
[1:18:09] that night they caught nothing so again
[1:18:12] Peter is trying to visit Old territory
[1:18:15] brother right but in order for God to
[1:18:18] enlarge Peter's territory he needed new
[1:18:21] territory praise the Lord was trying to
[1:18:25] go to Old territory but he needed new
[1:18:27] territory it reminds me of the parable
[1:18:30] Jesus gave in Luke
[1:18:33] 5 right Jesus spoke these words he says
[1:18:36] in Luke
[1:18:38] 5:36 he says no man put it a piece of
[1:18:41] new garment upon an old if otherwise
[1:18:45] then both the new make it w and the
[1:18:47] peace that was taken out of the new
[1:18:49] ageeth not with the old and no man put
[1:18:52] it new wine into old bottles else the
[1:18:56] new wine will burst the bottles and be
[1:18:58] spilled and the bottles Shall Perish but
[1:19:01] the new wine must be put into new
[1:19:03] bottles and both are preserved so Peter
[1:19:07] was trying to visit his old life but he
[1:19:10] was in a new day he was in a new age he
[1:19:13] was in a new message amen so God did not
[1:19:17] desire Peter to go back God desire did
[1:19:20] not desire Peter to get out of Step he
[1:19:22] desired Peter to get back in Step amen
[1:19:24] am man so Peter in this state praise the
[1:19:28] Lord Peter in this state I he feels
[1:19:32] ashamed he feels guilty he feels dis uh
[1:19:36] uh disappointed that he denied Christ
[1:19:38] three times praise the Lord but I remind
[1:19:41] you that go Peter uh God was not setting
[1:19:45] Peter up to fail he was setting Peter up
[1:19:47] to do great things Great and Mighty
[1:19:50] things so now we picked this up in
[1:19:53] chapter uh verse four
[1:19:55] it says but when the morning was now
[1:19:58] come Luke 5:4 when the morning was now
[1:20:02] come Jesus stood on the shore but the
[1:20:05] disciples knew not that it was Jesus
[1:20:09] then Jesus saith unto them children have
[1:20:12] ye any meat they answered him no and he
[1:20:17] said unto them cast the net on the right
[1:20:19] side of the ship and ye shall find now
[1:20:22] they didn't know this was Jesus
[1:20:25] right but this whole time Jesus is
[1:20:27] looking at them getting on the ship
[1:20:30] going fishing Jesus steps say and asked
[1:20:33] them have ye any meat now I want to
[1:20:36] remind you Jesus knows just the question
[1:20:38] to ask you when you're going through
[1:20:39] something Jesus knows just when to step
[1:20:42] in in your darkest hour all right that's
[1:20:44] when he steps in right now we F we pick
[1:20:47] it up here um verse 6 and he said unto
[1:20:51] them cast a net on the right side of the
[1:20:52] ship and ye shall find they they cast
[1:20:55] therefore and now they were not able to
[1:20:57] draw it for the multitude of fishes
[1:21:00] therefore that disciple whom Jesus
[1:21:02] loveed saith unto Peter it is the Lord
[1:21:06] now when Simon Peter heard that it was
[1:21:08] the Lord he GT his fish's coat unto him
[1:21:11] for he was naked and did cast himself
[1:21:13] into the sea God knows how to use old
[1:21:17] territory to make it familiar territory
[1:21:20] to bring restoration right praise the
[1:21:23] Lord now was no doubt broken he was
[1:21:27] broken but he needed somebody to restore
[1:21:30] him praise the Lord now Psalms 51:1 17
[1:21:35] David speaks this word after he himself
[1:21:37] was broken he says the sacrifices of God
[1:21:40] are a broken Spirit a broken and
[1:21:43] contrite heart oh God thou will not
[1:21:46] despise so I want you to understand
[1:21:48] Peter was in a perfect condition to
[1:21:51] receive what God had prepared for him
[1:21:54] praise Lord so even when you find
[1:21:56] yourself in a broken
[1:21:57] situation God is Not setting up for
[1:22:00] failure God is setting you up for
[1:22:02] something greater praise the Lord and
[1:22:05] I'm reminded of the words that uh our
[1:22:07] pastor uh said on um on Saturday and and
[1:22:11] and I have to give our pastor credit for
[1:22:12] saying it but the the real credit goes
[1:22:14] to brother Wesco where he says you can
[1:22:17] make it on broken pieces amen so
[1:22:20] regardless of what situation you're in
[1:22:23] you can make naked unbroken pieces
[1:22:26] praise the Lord
[1:22:28] amen now we pick it up back in Mark
[1:22:31] 16 verse 5 praise the Lord and it says
[1:22:37] in entering into the
[1:22:40] seure they saw a young man sitting on
[1:22:43] the right side clothed in a long garment
[1:22:46] and they were AF frightened now this is
[1:22:48] what happened prior to getting on the
[1:22:52] ship and he saith unto them be not AF
[1:22:55] frighted ye seek Jesus of Nazareth which
[1:22:58] was crucified he is risen he is not here
[1:23:03] behold the place where they laid him but
[1:23:07] go your way tell his disciples and Peter
[1:23:12] praise the Lord God made it personal to
[1:23:15] Peter right go tell your disciples and
[1:23:19] Peter that he goeth before you in
[1:23:21] Galilee there you shall see him and he
[1:23:24] said unto you right praise God so God
[1:23:28] knew exactly the condition that Peter
[1:23:31] would be in for him to be restored back
[1:23:34] to where he belonged praise the Lord
[1:23:38] amen Peter says this in second Peter
[1:23:41] 1:10 he says wherefore the rather
[1:23:44] Brethren give diligence to make your
[1:23:47] calling in election short for if you do
[1:23:50] these things ye shall never fail right
[1:23:54] you shall never fall now I just want to
[1:23:57] ask what things what things if you do
[1:24:00] you shall never fall now we picked this
[1:24:03] up in Acts chapter 4 verse 5 and I might
[1:24:06] not be able to read the whole thing
[1:24:08] because it's a lengthy uh read here
[1:24:11] but this is Peter when he is now filled
[1:24:15] with the Holy Ghost all right and it is
[1:24:18] really something to behold the boldness
[1:24:21] that the Believers had in this time in
[1:24:23] this day yes it didn't matter who they
[1:24:26] were up against it goes back to their
[1:24:29] indisputable Authority they had that
[1:24:32] right praise the Lord amen and you see
[1:24:34] they did something that was uh of of
[1:24:38] reproach to them in that day all right
[1:24:41] uh and they it was a man that received
[1:24:44] healing it was a miracle and people all
[1:24:47] over witnessed it all right praise the
[1:24:49] Lord and we can pick this up in Acts uh
[1:24:52] in verse 8 says Peter then filled with
[1:24:56] the Holy Ghost said unto them ye rulers
[1:24:59] of the people and Elders of Israel if we
[1:25:03] this day be examined of the good deed
[1:25:05] done to the impotent Man by what means
[1:25:08] he is made whole be it known unto you
[1:25:11] all and to all the people of Israel that
[1:25:14] by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth
[1:25:17] whom ye crucified whom God raised from
[1:25:20] the dead even by him do this man stand
[1:25:24] here before you hold so Jes uh Peter is
[1:25:27] telling them exactly how this man
[1:25:29] received his healing exactly how this
[1:25:31] man was made whole right in verse 13 we
[1:25:35] read it says now when they saw the
[1:25:37] boldness of Peter and John and perceived
[1:25:41] that they were unlearned and ignorant
[1:25:43] man they marveled and they took
[1:25:45] knowledge of them that they had been
[1:25:48] with Jesus and you know sometimes you
[1:25:51] got to conduct yourself like you've been
[1:25:53] with Jesus you've got to carry yourself
[1:25:57] like you've been with Jesus where other
[1:25:59] people can see Jesus on the outside
[1:26:03] amen we continue here it says verse 14
[1:26:08] and beholding the man which was healed
[1:26:10] standing with them they could say
[1:26:13] nothing against it but when they had
[1:26:16] commanded them to go aside out of the
[1:26:18] counsel they conferred among themselves
[1:26:20] saying what shall we do to these men for
[1:26:23] that indeed a notable Miracle hath been
[1:26:26] done by them is Manifest to all them
[1:26:29] that dwell in Jerusalem and we cannot
[1:26:32] deny it praise God see there's certain
[1:26:35] things when God do for your life your
[1:26:38] enemies can't deny
[1:26:40] it the the naysayers can't deny it those
[1:26:43] that had to speak something against you
[1:26:45] can't deny it praise God verse 17 but
[1:26:50] that is spread no further among the
[1:26:52] people let a straight threaten them now
[1:26:55] this is their tactic that they speak
[1:26:57] henceforth to no man in his name and
[1:27:00] they call them and commanded them not to
[1:27:03] speak at all nor teach in the name of
[1:27:05] Jesus but Peter and
[1:27:08] John praise the Lord Peter and John
[1:27:17] um praise the Lord Peter and
[1:27:21] John verse okay there we go
[1:27:24] uh but Peter and John answered and said
[1:27:26] unto them whether it be right in the
[1:27:29] sight of God to hearken unto you or to
[1:27:33] hearken unto God judge ye for we cannot
[1:27:36] but speak the things which we have seen
[1:27:39] and have heard praise the Lord so when I
[1:27:43] say what things I ask you what have you
[1:27:46] seen and what have you heard all right
[1:27:49] praise God have you seen the god
[1:27:51] manifest himself in your midst have you
[1:27:54] have you heard the word of God in your
[1:27:56] ears so you must speak what you've seen
[1:27:59] you must speak what you've heard praise
[1:28:02] God cuz it belongs to you yes it's amen
[1:28:06] glory Peter says I cannot but speak the
[1:28:09] things which we have seen and heard amen
[1:28:11] praise God Amen Faith cometh by hearing
[1:28:15] hearing of the word of God Amen and when
[1:28:18] you receive Faith Peter tells us to add
[1:28:21] to your faith virtue right and add to
[1:28:23] your virtue to knowledge to knowledge
[1:28:25] Temperance to Temperance patience to
[1:28:28] patience godliness to Godliness
[1:28:29] brotherly kindness and to brotherly
[1:28:31] kindness charity now I want you to
[1:28:34] understand Peter didn't say your virtue
[1:28:37] your knowledge your brotherly kindness
[1:28:39] but he did say your faith so you must
[1:28:43] have your faith and then when you have
[1:28:46] your faith it's connected to everything
[1:28:49] else praise the Lord your faith brings
[1:28:53] everything on the scene your faith your
[1:28:56] faith gives you what you need in the
[1:28:57] time that you need it hallelujah praise
[1:29:01] God now Peter was sealed with the Holy
[1:29:05] Spirit the scripture tells us he was in
[1:29:07] elect according to the foreign knowledge
[1:29:10] of God praise God now we all have been
[1:29:16] surrounded by the
[1:29:18] supernatural this this whole this whole
[1:29:20] journey has been Supernatural the the
[1:29:24] restoration of the word the the the the
[1:29:27] the the the the thought of getting back
[1:29:28] in Step it's it's all been Supernatural
[1:29:32] and no one is here by accident praise
[1:29:35] the Lord amen no one is here by accident
[1:29:38] amen the supernatural surrounds you and
[1:29:41] I'm I'm going to I'm going to bring a
[1:29:42] script a few thoughts of the scripture
[1:29:44] out to you to to help you see that
[1:29:46] you're surrounded by the supernatural
[1:29:49] I'm reminded of gazi you see gazi was
[1:29:53] surrounded
[1:29:55] by Chariots of angels but he didn't see
[1:29:57] it but it took God to open his eyes to
[1:30:02] realize he was surrounded by the
[1:30:04] supernatural praise God I'm reminded of
[1:30:08] the disciples that was on the boat right
[1:30:11] they were going somewhere but a storm
[1:30:13] came their way but there was somebody
[1:30:16] sleeping on the
[1:30:19] boat they were surrounded by the
[1:30:21] supernatural praise God
[1:30:24] and and the scripture says uh disciple
[1:30:26] says let us go wake Jesus you see so I
[1:30:30] encourage you this morning go wake up
[1:30:32] the
[1:30:33] supernatural go wake up the supernatural
[1:30:35] you need the supernatural for your
[1:30:37] finances the supernatural for your
[1:30:39] healing the supernatural for your
[1:30:41] Victory the supernatural wake up the
[1:30:45] supernatural this morning it belongs to
[1:30:47] you praise
[1:30:50] God praise God
[1:30:53] [Applause]
[1:30:55] GL we're
[1:30:57] surrounded by the
[1:31:00] supernatural now I want to turn to
[1:31:04] Jeremiah
[1:31:06] 25 as we continue the thought of sealed
[1:31:10] and
[1:31:12] restoration Jeremiah
[1:31:14] 25 verse
[1:31:18] 8 praise the Lord and it
[1:31:21] reads therefore
[1:31:24] thus sayith the Lord of hosts because ye
[1:31:27] have not heard my words Behold I will
[1:31:30] send and take all the families of the
[1:31:33] north sayeth the
[1:31:35] Lord and
[1:31:37] Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon my
[1:31:39] servant and will bring them against this
[1:31:43] land and against the inhabitants thereof
[1:31:47] and against all these nations round
[1:31:49] about and will utterly destroy them and
[1:31:52] make them in astonishment in a hissing
[1:31:56] In Perpetual desolations moreover I will
[1:31:59] take from them the voice of MTH and the
[1:32:03] voice of gladness the voice of the
[1:32:05] bridegroom and the voice of the Bride
[1:32:08] the sound of the millstones in the light
[1:32:11] of the candle verse 11 and this whole
[1:32:14] land shall be a desolation and an
[1:32:17] astonishment and these nations Shall
[1:32:20] Serve the king of Babylon 70 years
[1:32:24] praise the Lord now I want you to
[1:32:26] understand that in this in this time
[1:32:28] where God is revealing this word to
[1:32:30] Jeremiah the prophet uh Jeremiah in
[1:32:34] chapter 1 had already been told uh that
[1:32:37] God would use him to uh destroy to to
[1:32:41] pluck out to to to root out uh but he
[1:32:44] also says he would he would build and he
[1:32:46] would plant and in this this instance we
[1:32:49] realize that prophecy is going forth
[1:32:52] against the children of isra Israel
[1:32:54] because of their idolatry because of
[1:32:57] them serving false gods right and and
[1:33:00] and and we we see that there will be a
[1:33:03] desolation to their land for 70 years so
[1:33:07] they'll be in captivity for 70 years
[1:33:10] praise God and and and and God uh uh
[1:33:14] just like Peter had this word to them
[1:33:18] but God was never setting them up for
[1:33:19] failure God was setting them up for
[1:33:22] something that they would never they
[1:33:24] would not even understand in Jeremiah 29
[1:33:27] we pick this up and this is another um
[1:33:31] another prophecy given to Jeremiah I
[1:33:34] like to call this God's love
[1:33:36] letter God's love letter to his people
[1:33:40] praise God now this letter to the Exiles
[1:33:43] verse four it says thus sayith the Lord
[1:33:46] of hosts the god of Israel unto all that
[1:33:50] are carried away captives whom I have
[1:33:53] called to be carried who caused I I
[1:33:58] who's I the Lord who he caused to be
[1:34:01] carried away captive from Jerusalem unto
[1:34:05] Babylon build ye houses and dwell in
[1:34:08] them and plant Gardens and eat the fruit
[1:34:10] of them take ye wives and beget sons and
[1:34:14] daughters and take wives for your sons
[1:34:17] and give your daughters to husbands that
[1:34:20] they may bear sons and daughters that ye
[1:34:23] may be be increased there and not be
[1:34:26] diminished and I thought this was very
[1:34:28] interesting because even in captivity
[1:34:31] the Lord still wants you to experience
[1:34:34] increase even in captivity the Lord
[1:34:37] still wants you to have praise the
[1:34:41] Lord still still desires for you to have
[1:34:44] increase even in
[1:34:47] captivity praise
[1:34:49] God God hallelujah verse 7 it says and
[1:34:53] seek the peace of the city whether I
[1:34:55] have caused you to be carried away
[1:34:57] captive and pray unto the Lord for it
[1:35:00] for in the peace thereof shall ye have
[1:35:02] peace so God wants you to experience
[1:35:05] increase and peace in
[1:35:09] captivity that that's the god that you
[1:35:11] serve which can use the foolish things
[1:35:14] of this world to confound the wise
[1:35:17] praise God
[1:35:19] glory and restoration um in Jeremiah 29
[1:35:24] we continue this this scene in verse
[1:35:27] 10 and Jeremiah the prophet says for
[1:35:31] thus sayith the Lord that after 70 years
[1:35:34] be accomplished at Babylon I will visit
[1:35:38] you and perform my good word toward you
[1:35:42] in causing you to return to this place
[1:35:45] that's it that's restoration praise God
[1:35:49] verse 11 for I know the thoughts that I
[1:35:52] think toward you sayith the Lord Lord
[1:35:54] thoughts of peace and not of evil to
[1:35:56] give you an expected end then shall you
[1:36:00] call upon me and ye shall go and pray
[1:36:02] unto me and I will hearken unto you and
[1:36:06] ye shall seek me and find me when ye
[1:36:08] shall search from me with all your heart
[1:36:12] and if I be found of you sayi the Lord I
[1:36:14] will turn away your captivity and I will
[1:36:17] gather you from all the nations and from
[1:36:19] the places whether I have driven you
[1:36:22] sayeth the Lord and I will bring you
[1:36:24] again into this place whence I have
[1:36:27] caused you to be carried away captive
[1:36:30] praise God now I want you to understand
[1:36:32] that God knew this all along amen right
[1:36:35] but it was necessary for the people of
[1:36:38] God to receive chastisement right
[1:36:41] chastisement and correction is God's
[1:36:43] love to you praise God when you are
[1:36:46] chastised the Bible says you are not a
[1:36:48] bastard child when you can receive it
[1:36:51] praise God Amen
[1:36:54] now the people of God understood this
[1:36:57] and in Jeremiah
[1:36:59] 31:18 they said I have surely heard
[1:37:04] Ephraim children of Israel Bolding
[1:37:07] himself thus thou has chastised me and I
[1:37:11] was chastised as a bulock unaccustomed
[1:37:14] to the Yoke turn thou me and I shall be
[1:37:17] turned for the Lord the the Lord for
[1:37:20] thou art the Lord my God so the people
[1:37:23] are now recognizing the need for
[1:37:26] restoration and and and and what
[1:37:28] unlocks the restoration that belongs to
[1:37:31] you is when you can recognize your need
[1:37:33] for it when you when you can recognize
[1:37:36] that you yourself need to be restored
[1:37:38] praise God all right amen now in the
[1:37:44] message the true Easter
[1:37:45] seal in paragraph 53 the prophet says
[1:37:49] and then I was thinking that what I had
[1:37:52] in mind as a Easter seal then I wondered
[1:37:55] why that it was so rejected and how that
[1:37:59] people would refuse it why was it so
[1:38:02] condemned and I was thinking then that
[1:38:04] it's not always condemned and all people
[1:38:07] doesn't condemn it but God has so made a
[1:38:10] way that man has placed that man is
[1:38:13] placed into a position to where he's
[1:38:15] forced to make a decision man cannot
[1:38:18] live on earth without making a decision
[1:38:21] God forces the issue to him he must make
[1:38:24] some decision and there is a time when
[1:38:27] you have to make a decision praise the
[1:38:29] Lord and and and in the
[1:38:32] decision the Seal of God forces that
[1:38:35] upon
[1:38:36] you it forces you to make a decision we
[1:38:41] didn't talk about this but when you have
[1:38:43] to make a decision it's really between
[1:38:45] two things the Seal of God or the mark
[1:38:48] of the beast praise God all right you
[1:38:51] either receive the Seal of God
[1:38:54] or you are marked with the mark of the
[1:38:56] beast now the prophet says the mark of
[1:38:58] the beast is rejecting the word for your
[1:39:00] day rejecting the word that's been
[1:39:03] revealed to you the word of restoration
[1:39:06] praise the Lord amen so you must make a
[1:39:10] decision sir and when you are forced to
[1:39:13] make this decision you must understand
[1:39:16] the need to be sealed
[1:39:18] sealed now we read earlier in Ephesians
[1:39:22] chapter 1 where it says were sealed when
[1:39:24] you first believed now when did you
[1:39:27] believe when did you believe did you
[1:39:30] believe when the the word was revealed
[1:39:32] to you now or did you believe some other
[1:39:34] time praise God we're going to we're
[1:39:36] going to get into a little bit of that
[1:39:38] uh as as I continue praise the Lord God
[1:39:41] now as a
[1:39:43] recap um just some of the things that I
[1:39:47] know our pastor has has has uh has read
[1:39:50] uh in the message the restoration of the
[1:39:52] brid tree
[1:39:54] paragraph 122 it reads regardless of how
[1:39:57] little we are how low we are how impure
[1:40:01] we are how Unholy we are how sick we are
[1:40:04] how Afflicted we are the law of God's
[1:40:08] spirit by his word makes it obey him
[1:40:12] forces the issue and says give it back
[1:40:15] amen if we could just think for that for
[1:40:18] a minute forces it regardless of the
[1:40:22] condition no matter what the condition
[1:40:24] is the law of God's word forces the
[1:40:26] condition to cope with his word praise
[1:40:30] the Lord amen so in Jeremiah 31 ver 19
[1:40:36] we see the manifestation of restoration
[1:40:40] taking place it says surely after that I
[1:40:45] was turned after that I was restored
[1:40:48] uhhuh I repented all right and after
[1:40:50] that I was instructed I smoted upon my
[1:40:53] thigh I was ashamed yay even confounded
[1:40:57] because I did Bear the reproach of my
[1:40:58] youth but this shall be the Covenant
[1:41:00] that I will make with the house of
[1:41:02] Israel after those days sayi the Lord I
[1:41:05] will put my law in their inward parts
[1:41:09] and write it in their hearts and they
[1:41:11] will be and I will be their God and they
[1:41:14] shall be my people so who will write the
[1:41:17] law God will write his law in your
[1:41:20] inward Parts amen and we just read it
[1:41:23] here here the law it's the law of God by
[1:41:26] his Spirit the law of God is his word
[1:41:29] right and whatever the condition is it
[1:41:31] must obey the law of God praise the Lord
[1:41:35] yes sir in paragraph 136 in that same
[1:41:39] message the restoration of the Bride
[1:41:41] tree the prophet says that's the church
[1:41:44] might be a bunch of Holy Rollers
[1:41:46] so-called or whatever you want to call
[1:41:48] it but it's the
[1:41:50] authority it's the authority behind it
[1:41:54] that's what does it regardless of the
[1:41:57] conditions God's law works with his word
[1:42:01] now it won't work with your Creed it
[1:42:03] only work with the word yay it's just
[1:42:07] works with the word that's all
[1:42:09] regardless of the condition praise the
[1:42:13] Lord uh where's the water bottle
[1:42:28] amen praise the
[1:42:30] Lord
[1:42:33] so we want to turn into Jeremiah
[1:42:39] 32 Jeremiah 32 as we continue to unfold
[1:42:43] this thought of being sealed in
[1:42:46] restoration praise the
[1:42:48] Lord now in Jeremiah
[1:42:51] 32 uh this this
[1:42:54] was a time where what was spoken in
[1:42:58] Jeremiah 25 that we read
[1:43:00] earlier where we see the man the the the
[1:43:04] play out of that Prophecy of the the the
[1:43:07] the children of Israel going into
[1:43:09] captivity so in Jeremiah 32 we read
[1:43:13] verse one here it says the word that
[1:43:15] came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the
[1:43:18] 10th year of zedekiah king of
[1:43:21] Judah um which was the 18th year of
[1:43:26] Nebuchadnezzar for the king of babylon's
[1:43:30] army Bes
[1:43:32] Jerusalem and Jeremiah the prophet was
[1:43:35] shut up in the court of the prison now I
[1:43:38] want you to see this um in in in this
[1:43:42] manner um we realize Jer prop the
[1:43:45] Prophet Jeremiah was in prison and as he
[1:43:48] was in prison the very land that he's
[1:43:51] occupying will also soon be in prison so
[1:43:55] now he's in a double prison all right
[1:43:57] right uh now that there's nowh anybody
[1:44:00] would want to be but this is where he
[1:44:02] was but the the word continues here uh
[1:44:06] Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the
[1:44:08] court of the Prophet which was in the
[1:44:10] king of judah's house for zedekiah the
[1:44:13] king of Judah had shut him up saying
[1:44:16] wherefore dust thou prophesy and say
[1:44:19] thus sayith the Lord behold I will give
[1:44:22] this city into the hand of the king of
[1:44:24] Babylon and he shall take it so Jeremiah
[1:44:27] had
[1:44:28] prophesied that this would take place
[1:44:31] that's right and zedekiah was mad about
[1:44:33] that you see the the word of the Lord is
[1:44:35] in the mouth of the prophet and it's
[1:44:37] never popular and zedekiah knew that now
[1:44:41] zedekiah also had an ought against the
[1:44:43] king of neb uh the king of Babylon which
[1:44:45] was king Nebuchadnezzar is that uh
[1:44:47] zedekiah rebelled against him you see so
[1:44:51] he on so he was in a twofold lose a
[1:44:54] losing side because he he Jeremiah said
[1:44:57] he was going to lose this this battle
[1:45:00] that uh the the the armies of Babylon
[1:45:02] would overtake them and he knew that
[1:45:05] once he comes uh uh face to face with
[1:45:08] King
[1:45:08] Nebuchadnezzar uh it wouldn't be too
[1:45:10] good for him so he knows all of this and
[1:45:13] he's he's he's he's sharing his anger
[1:45:15] towards Jeremiah which is why Jeremiah
[1:45:18] is now in this prison praise the Lord
[1:45:21] now in verse six we continue and as
[1:45:25] Jeremiah is in prison it says in
[1:45:28] Jeremiah said the word of the Lord came
[1:45:30] unto me saying behold Hanam the son of
[1:45:35] Shalom thine Uncle shall come unto thee
[1:45:39] saying by thee my field that is in anot
[1:45:43] and anot was Jeremiah's Hometown come on
[1:45:46] brother Hanam was Jeremiah's cousin so
[1:45:50] God is God is telling Jeremiah that your
[1:45:52] cousin's going going to come to you and
[1:45:54] he's going to ask you to buy his field
[1:45:59] and now this is a time of captivity come
[1:46:01] on so now there's a a transaction that's
[1:46:05] getting ready to take place yes praise
[1:46:07] the Lord and it continues
[1:46:10] here uh it says behold Hamil the son of
[1:46:13] shalom shalom uh thine uncle's uh that
[1:46:17] Uncle uh shall uh come unto thee saying
[1:46:20] by my field uh that is an an an anop uh
[1:46:24] for the right of redemption is thine to
[1:46:27] buy it in verse eight so Hanam mine
[1:46:31] Uncle son come to me in the court of the
[1:46:34] prison according to the word of the Lord
[1:46:36] and said unto me by my field I pray thee
[1:46:40] that is in anod which is in the country
[1:46:42] of Benjamin for the right of inheritance
[1:46:45] is thine and the Redemption is thine
[1:46:49] praise the Lord now Jeremiah saw a
[1:46:51] vision first and now he sees a direct
[1:46:54] manifestation of that Vision it has come
[1:46:57] to pass his cousin has come to him in
[1:46:59] the prison and has told him we are in
[1:47:02] this I know we're in this captivity I
[1:47:04] know we're being sieged by Babylon but
[1:47:07] um I'm I'm trying to sell this land
[1:47:09] right it's just like uh uh the market is
[1:47:11] getting ready to crash and uh your
[1:47:13] cousin come to you and says I need to
[1:47:16] sell this stock will you buy it I need
[1:47:18] to sell this house will you buy it
[1:47:21] praise God and you see
[1:47:25] Jeremiah he he based on the prophecy he
[1:47:29] goes on to say he says uh then I knew
[1:47:33] that this was the word of the Lord amen
[1:47:36] so because he knew it was the word of
[1:47:38] the Lord he had confidence in this
[1:47:41] transaction it didn't make sense for him
[1:47:43] to buy it because the the land would
[1:47:47] have meant nothing to him because it
[1:47:48] would have been uh under the Babylonian
[1:47:51] jurisdiction right brother but he had
[1:47:53] confidence in the word praise
[1:47:57] God in verse nine says enai brought the
[1:48:00] field of Hanam my uncle's son that was
[1:48:03] in anod and weighed him the money even
[1:48:06] 17 shekels of silver praise the Lord so
[1:48:10] this wasn't a favorable deal to a favor
[1:48:13] deal business transaction to Jeremiah
[1:48:16] but he he he he had something that was
[1:48:19] in him sir that that that he could
[1:48:22] receive confirmation by Praise the Lord
[1:48:24] right and I believe God wanted Jeremiah
[1:48:28] to have tomorrow's breaking news
[1:48:31] today because though they were in
[1:48:33] captivity God had plans of one day
[1:48:36] bringing restoration to the people of
[1:48:39] God in that land you see nobody knew it
[1:48:43] but the prophet right so the prophet on
[1:48:46] the scene brought a restoration message
[1:48:49] praise God and he was able to cond cond
[1:48:53] the transaction based on restoration and
[1:48:56] the reason he could do this is because
[1:48:58] the transaction was based on the right
[1:49:01] of redemption praise the Lord Jeremiah
[1:49:04] had a Redemption claim to the purchase
[1:49:07] of that land right brother praise God
[1:49:10] glory and Jeremiah had to be qualified
[1:49:13] to execute this transaction he had to be
[1:49:16] qualified because he was Kinsman to
[1:49:19] Hanah praise God glory praise the Lord
[1:49:23] now I want you to I want you to type
[1:49:25] this because 2,000 years ago there was a
[1:49:28] transaction that occurred on the cross
[1:49:31] right praise God it wasn't 17 pieces of
[1:49:34] of silver that was purchased uh that was
[1:49:36] brought to purchase the land but it was
[1:49:39] the blood of Jesus Christ amen the blood
[1:49:42] of Jesus Christ was shed to purchase
[1:49:46] amen your land this morning praise God
[1:49:50] praise God praise the Lord
[1:49:53] my God than now I want you to know what
[1:49:57] makes you
[1:49:59] qualified is not your relationship to
[1:50:01] God but his relationship to you all
[1:50:04] right that's what makes you qualified
[1:50:06] this morning it's his relationship to
[1:50:08] you which means it's not your business
[1:50:11] it's God's business it's not your
[1:50:13] purpose it's God's purpose it's what
[1:50:16] he's unfolding in you and through you
[1:50:18] yes sir praise the lordu so
[1:50:22] the prophet says uh in this message the
[1:50:24] seed shall not be air with the
[1:50:26] shut the prophet says uh God knew before
[1:50:31] the foundation of the world who would be
[1:50:33] saved and who would not be saved by
[1:50:36] predestination by for knowledge he saw
[1:50:39] every member put every name on the
[1:50:41] Lamb's Book of Life before the church
[1:50:44] began so God is speaking of you he saw
[1:50:48] you before you were even born praise God
[1:50:51] paragraph 48 says say um uh as I have
[1:50:55] often says you recognize that that's why
[1:50:58] you're here this morning while you're
[1:50:59] coming up out of all these organization
[1:51:02] and things there's something pulling you
[1:51:05] amen there's something pulling you now
[1:51:07] we continue this in Jeremiah
[1:51:10] 32:10 after Jeremiah has made this
[1:51:14] transaction he's he does something uh
[1:51:17] very particular here it says and I
[1:51:21] subscribed which mean he signed the
[1:51:24] evidence and sealed it and we talked
[1:51:27] about a seal is something that is signed
[1:51:31] subscribed he says I subscribed the
[1:51:34] evidence and sealed it and took
[1:51:36] Witnesses and weighed him the money in
[1:51:38] the balances so I took evidence the deed
[1:51:41] of the purchase right both that which
[1:51:44] was sealed according to the law and
[1:51:46] custom and that which was open wow and I
[1:51:50] gave the evidence of the purchase to
[1:51:52] Barack the son of uh Niah the son of
[1:51:57] Messiah and in the sight of Hanam my
[1:52:00] uncle son and in the presence of the
[1:52:02] witnesses that subscribe the book of the
[1:52:05] purchase before all the Jews that sat in
[1:52:08] the court of the prison so Jeremiah went
[1:52:11] the full nine yards here in the spite of
[1:52:14] being in captivity Jeremiah is now
[1:52:18] purchased this land and he has purposed
[1:52:20] in his heart that I'm going to need
[1:52:22] proof that I purchased this land I'm
[1:52:25] going to need an I'm need something that
[1:52:27] shows that regardless of who takes this
[1:52:31] land captive this land belongs to me
[1:52:33] that's exactly right the spite of who
[1:52:36] comes what may what Le this land belongs
[1:52:38] to me so he takes this this deed and he
[1:52:43] seals it up and there's a the the this
[1:52:46] talks about uh the deed that was sealed
[1:52:48] and the deed that was open all right now
[1:52:51] I want you to understand was the same
[1:52:53] document the same the same uh um the
[1:52:57] same deed but one was sealed one was
[1:52:59] open and the purpose of the Open
[1:53:03] document was if at all it was ever
[1:53:06] tampered with if at all it was ever
[1:53:09] compromised they could go back to the
[1:53:12] sealed document and vindicate the false
[1:53:16] that may have been on the on the other
[1:53:18] document oh praise God Amen two do
[1:53:23] one was sealed one was
[1:53:25] open and I want you to understand that
[1:53:28] you here this morning in your Earthly
[1:53:31] vessel all right but the pro the Bible
[1:53:34] says that uh when this Earthly
[1:53:36] Tabernacle be dissolved there's one
[1:53:39] waiting up for you in glory and I want
[1:53:42] you to understand that that one is
[1:53:44] waiting for you in glory has already
[1:53:46] been
[1:53:47] sealed so you might have been
[1:53:49] compromised with sickness you might have
[1:53:51] been compromised with defeat you might
[1:53:54] have been compromised with failure but
[1:53:57] there's a sealed version of you that is
[1:53:59] perfect finished that has not been
[1:54:02] compromised praise God and God can use
[1:54:05] that to vindicate who you are this
[1:54:08] morning that's why the word had to be
[1:54:11] broken that's why the seals had to be
[1:54:13] broken so that you can understand who
[1:54:16] you are in Him Praise the Lord you see
[1:54:21] when God with Christ on the cross he
[1:54:23] broke the seals of death but he also
[1:54:25] sealed you with his holy spirit all
[1:54:28] right praise the Lord and when he sealed
[1:54:30] you amen amen praise God Amen Let Us
[1:54:36] continue it goes on to say in verse
[1:54:39] 13 and I charged Barack before them
[1:54:43] saying thus said the Lord of hosts the
[1:54:45] god of Israel take these evidences the
[1:54:48] Deeds the evidence of the purchase both
[1:54:51] which is sealed
[1:54:52] and the evidence which is open and put
[1:54:55] them in an earn vessel that they may
[1:54:58] continue many days when Christ died on
[1:55:02] the cross he put the when he sealed the
[1:55:06] Seal of Promise the Holy Ghost he put it
[1:55:08] in an earn vessel when we turn to 2
[1:55:11] Corinthians
[1:55:13] 4:7 it says but we have this treasure in
[1:55:18] Earth and vessels that the Excellency of
[1:55:22] the power may be of God and not of us
[1:55:26] praise God and if that if it be if the
[1:55:30] Earth vessel is Christ and you are in
[1:55:32] Christ this morning that mean the sealed
[1:55:35] evidence the sealed document that is in
[1:55:38] Christ is in you amen praise God Amen so
[1:55:41] you are sealed in restoration this
[1:55:43] morning you have a seal on the inside
[1:55:46] that cannot be compromised you have a
[1:55:48] seal on the inside that cannot be
[1:55:50] tampered with indisputable Authority
[1:55:53] praise God you have a seal on the inside
[1:55:56] that will stand the test that will
[1:55:58] defeat any devil any day any time no
[1:56:01] matter who no matter where it is a
[1:56:04] sealed document praise God Amen the
[1:56:08] prophet said many time before they can
[1:56:11] be a a a fake dollar they have to be a
[1:56:14] real one praise the Lord amen so you you
[1:56:17] you you are the imperfection of what
[1:56:20] already is that's good praise the
[1:56:23] Lord praise God in the message
[1:56:26] Revelation chap 5 uh part two preach 61
[1:56:31] 0618 paragraph
[1:56:33] 194 the prophet says now when Jeremiah
[1:56:37] wrote this book was sealed he's here's a
[1:56:41] good thing I want you to notice all of
[1:56:43] you that read it that them sealed book
[1:56:46] uh now remember he was going to be gone
[1:56:48] he had prophesied now he did not know it
[1:56:51] only only through a prophecy are you
[1:56:53] following me through prophecy he knew
[1:56:57] through the revelation of God that they
[1:56:59] was going to uh be away from that
[1:57:02] country for 70 years you remember him
[1:57:04] prophesying that he would be 70 years
[1:57:08] they'd be in captivity so he wanted to
[1:57:11] be sure that this seal that is his
[1:57:13] inheritance would be kept cuz he
[1:57:17] inherited his cousin's inheritance so he
[1:57:20] had it all wrote up legally and what did
[1:57:23] he do with it so it wouldn't rot or rust
[1:57:26] he put it in an Earthly vessel and put
[1:57:29] it away so it wouldn't rot or rust until
[1:57:32] them 70 years be expired glory to God I
[1:57:36] hoped you would catch it do you see what
[1:57:38] God did he never revealed it to the wise
[1:57:41] and prudent so they could fuss about it
[1:57:43] for all his time but he put in an
[1:57:45] Earthly vessel and he created himself
[1:57:48] his own son Christ Jesus and this last
[1:57:53] day now he's opening the seals and
[1:57:55] showing it to his church capped in an
[1:57:58] Earthly vessel so it wouldn't Rod or
[1:58:01] rust oh I know you think I'm a Holy
[1:58:04] Roller maybe I am you see but there it
[1:58:07] is it's been kept wrapped in the vessel

[1:58:42] somebody that he can get the world out
[1:58:45] of them and the things out of them the

[2:02:09] Lord praise God praise God praise Goden
[2:02:12] now I have uh I'm not good with timers I
[2:02:15] did not set a
[2:02:17] timer um I just like to go with the flow
[2:02:19] of things and I have a lot here how I'm
[2:02:21] doing on time I don't
[2:02:23] know praise the
[2:02:26] Lord I I don't want to hold you
[2:02:30] hostage praise God but you know all
[2:02:34] these different points of what it means
[2:02:36] to be sealed and what a seal is amen um
[2:02:40] I certainly wanted to touch on a few of
[2:02:42] them amen um so that we can understand
[2:02:45] uh what it means to be sealed and I
[2:02:48] think we understand that through being
[2:02:50] sealed through the word of God God in
[2:02:52] this hour it has uh loosed the ministry
[2:02:55] of restoration it has broken the mystery
[2:02:59] of who we are and what the word means to
[2:03:02] us right the seal has also made it so
[2:03:05] that we cannot be compromised once we
[2:03:08] have that identity once we have this
[2:03:11] Revelation right the no matter what
[2:03:14] sickness comes upon you no matter what
[2:03:16] sin no matter what disease whatever it
[2:03:18] is the the Bible says the gates of hell
[2:03:22] cannot Prevail against this Revelation
[2:03:25] praise the
[2:03:30] Lord and as I come to a close here I'm
[2:03:33] going to read a
[2:03:35] scripture in Revelation chapter
[2:03:40] 3 verse 20 praise
[2:03:48] God and it
[2:03:50] reads behold old I stand at the door and
[2:03:54] knock If any man hear my voice and open
[2:03:59] the door I will come to him and will s
[2:04:03] with him and he with me to him that
[2:04:06] overcometh will I grant to sit with me
[2:04:09] in my throne even as I also overcame and
[2:04:14] am set down with my father in his throne
[2:04:18] praise the Lord now God has given us
[2:04:22] instructions on what to do to receive
[2:04:24] him and in this age this only age where
[2:04:29] God is on the outside knocking in
[2:04:31] exactly right but God has placed us
[2:04:34] above this leodan agea and I believe the
[2:04:37] prophet says that the that that
[2:04:39] captivity in the book of Jeremiah was a
[2:04:42] type of the church ages and how we the
[2:04:45] the the body of Christ has been in
[2:04:46] captivity all this time but at the end
[2:04:50] God promises to bring
[2:04:52] restoration praise the Lord and he says
[2:04:55] to him that overcome he will set with
[2:04:58] him in his throne praise the Lord oh my
[2:05:03] and the message the faith that was once
[2:05:05] delivered to the Saints
[2:05:09] 1953 this was preaching West Palm
[2:05:12] Beach Florida right here in our
[2:05:16] hometown praise

[2:14:20] that I'm not going to be able to get all
[2:14:23] the sermons out that I still have before
[2:14:25] the year's over so it's going to be an

[2:14:34] Lord and uh and and and I'm looking I'm
[2:14:36] looking forward to this you know just I
[2:14:38] I never caught some of the things that
[2:14:40] he was sharing in scripture one was out
[2:14:42] of Jeremiah 29 and7 that even when you
[2:14:46] are in
[2:14:49] captivity I mean you you you spiritually
[2:14:53] bound you you you trying to figure your
[2:14:55] way out of this thing and and don't know
[2:14:58] you know and even you know so many he
[2:15:00] said even um when we're when we're
[2:15:03] dealing with the seal it forces the
[2:15:05] issue it it forces you to make decisions
[2:15:08] but even while you're in the process of
[2:15:10] trying to make a right decision God
[2:15:11] wants you to prosper and he wants you to
[2:15:14] be in peace you know and and I I'm like
[2:15:17] man God just love us so much when God
[2:15:20] ain't strugg this we the ones that's
[2:15:22] always struggling right he's a perfect
[2:15:23] God but when we're struggling he still
[2:15:25] wants us to prosper and be in peace when
[2:15:27] we won't even show him the love that he
[2:15:30] deserves he still wants us to prosper
[2:15:34] and be in peace what a mighty God we
[2:15:39] serve man I I tell you that this this
[2:15:42] this seal forcing the decision and
[2:15:45] forcing the issue uh I've been there
[2:15:48] I've been there Amen in my own spirit
[2:15:50] and and had to make decisions but uh I
[2:15:53] thank God that when you make your
[2:15:55] decision and and God always put you in a
[2:15:57] spot where um he let you be the one to
[2:16:00] decide he don't make the decision for
[2:16:02] you because you're a free moral agent
[2:16:04] but he let you be the one to decide and
[2:16:06] once you choose oh my God I'm reminded
[2:16:08] of Amen a quote from the prophet say
[2:16:12] this uh this is amen my choice this is
[2:16:16] my choosing and and because you made the
[2:16:18] right choice this in itself self will
[2:16:22] make and make and bring to pass the
[2:16:24] tremendous victory in the love divine
[2:16:28] when you make the right choice God has a
[2:16:30] way of vindicating what you're doing oh
