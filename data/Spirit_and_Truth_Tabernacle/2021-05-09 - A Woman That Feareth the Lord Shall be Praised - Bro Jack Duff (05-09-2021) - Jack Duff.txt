bless y'all god bless y'all praise the lord amen well um uh i i wanted to just acknowledge a couple of things before we would get started amen uh today how i just appreciate the lord jesus for uh just all that he's doing here in our midst uh last sunday i was um i think where was i was i was in north carolina on sunday i don't know i was i was all over the place i just wherever the car stopped that's where i stopped but i was in north carolina on sunday and i was just you know uh looking at the service just streaming the service here and brother smiley and amen and there there was a song uh yeah that song that that brother uh solomon brought him up on um uh so so so so easy so easy to love and man brother smiley got got them got going with that i start i started feeling something in my hotel room [Music] when i was up on my feet i say i feel it brother i feel it but that was that was real good and my daughter was playing and so she went letting it go i said y'all just keep on working with that because that that's all right and uh you know just just the word of god that was being brought to us the presence of god and recognized and you know he was just telling us that when we recognize the presence of god there are other things that are released to us amen is released to us and and i just i just thank god for that so we appreciate you brother smiling uh the lord bless you [Applause] glory to god amen and uh also uh brother troy uh on wednesday night a man uh [Applause] that was i believe hold fast what was what hold fast and don't let go you know and and see you know it was it uh it kind of uh um i'm i'm gonna come there in a second but y'all try to try to hear me not hear them if y'all can i'm just some of y'all ready to move right now i feel it [Music] it's all right it's all right but but we were there in north carolina and um and you know we were my wife and i we were just kind of talking we went to jamestown and yorktown and you know some of these historic sites and and we looked at you know just just some of the ships and everything that come here to just you know just the faith that the people it took for them to get on a boat and go to a place they never heard of before and uh and they came here and they they did all the things and you know we bring up a lot of you know history some some part of history is we don't enjoy talking about i get that i understand that but it had to happen and partially it had to happen because uh there was prophecy in revelation 13 that had to be fulfilled and i and i guarantee when people left england they didn't realize they was fulfilling prophecy but they didn't know the seas they didn't know the weather patterns they didn't know any of that but somehow they pressed through and persevered by faith to come here to the u.s right they did this by faith and i wonder how many storms they might have faced and maybe the captain of the ship was just yelling at hole fast hold fast don't let go my brother just drop your anchor come on somebody and just hold steady and don't let go good god almighty i don't know what you're going through this morning but if you just hold fast and don't let go gotta bring you through your storm but i i was just as i was listening to brother troy on on wednesday night all that start going through my mind and then i start thinking about you know uh one time paul was on the ship [Music] [Applause] paul was on the ship and they were going through this great storm called euro clayton it was a hurricane that they were facing and as they went through this the ship they were holding fast they were doing everything they could just to hold on but the ship still became shipwrecked they lost some boards they lost this they lost that and they they didn't know what to do but paul just gave them a little advice he said now anybody if you can't swim and we got to get onto the shore just grab a little piece of pork and just float on up to the shore hallelujah sometimes you can't be on the whole ship but you can just get a little piece of board and it'll still float you to safety [Music] [Applause] one scripture can carry you through one song can carry you through just a little bit from god hold fast and don't let go my god [Music] [Applause] i was just blessed brother troy i simply wanted to say i was blessed i was blessed amen thank you jesus all right praise the lord uh just give me a few minutes say man and i just want to make mention of a couple things um i want to plan for us to do another terry service in the month of of of june i'm going to choose a friday night since we don't have services but that's where the gifts that god has placed on this will come together amen and just seek the lord and just see what he will speak to us and uh so i have it in my heart to try to do another one in june i know another fifth tuesday is coming up i think sometime in august or something like that so i want to just maybe do another one in june and i will let you know the date amen that that will be uh i'll let you know which date but we'll be planning for terror service in in june amen also uh may 30th um we had a minister's meeting yesterday and by god's grace the brothers have decided we want to try to have some combined services again and uh so may 30th is the first combined service and to be held at brother gene's church in boynton beach and we're looking forward amen to the fellowship with one another amen uh on the may 30th it's going to be at 6 00 p.m on may 30th so keep that amen in mind put that on your calendar and all the sisters here i got a a a message from brother mike willingham he said he wanted to send a happy mother's day greeting to all the sisters from brother mike willingham so and man we thank god for that and brother felix uh uh zuniga he sent me a text said please tell your wife happy mother's day brother jack i said well happy mother's day to my wife so good to hear from these different brothers amen that's thinking about you all amen god is good they say all the time god is good and god is good all the time come on put your hands on it's so easy whoa it's so easy so easy yeah it's so easy yes it is it's so easy to love oh that jesus and me say that jesus in me it loves you jesus in you yes i said that jesus in me well it loves jesus in you and it's so easy yes it is it's so easy hallelujah whoa it's so easy well it's so easy to love come on do it one more time everybody hey everybody sing the song sack oh the jesus and me and loves of jesus in you well the jesus in me hallelujah loves of jesus in you is so [Music] yeah yeah [Music] oh it's so easy it's so easy to laugh oh glory hallelujah thank you musicians god bless you all appreciate you appreciate you while you're standing to your feet let us amen get our our bible amen and we our bibles will read the scripture this morning so good to see everybody in the house of god just amen nothing like the presence of the lord amen nothing like the presence of the lord um it's mother's day and um i am going to have a mother's day sermon uh for the mamas um i've been in a series but i'm breaking amen my uh my stride and i want to just try to be a blessing to mamas amen uh we'll read a few quotes from the prophet prophet one statement says that it's a shame that they only get one day [Music] that we only pay attention like this so one day they commercialized it and it shouldn't be that way but uh but nonetheless we want to take time we want to take time and uh and honor the mothers amen and and our midst amen on today so uh i want to read from proverbs 31 i don't think i've ever preached from here before i'm not sure it could be a long time ago but uh i will read from proverbs 31 and um i will just so that you're not standing too long i'll just use one verse but i do want to come back to this chapter and try to break down just a couple of things if we can so just give me verse 30. at this moment we'll pray over the scripture after we've read it and uh we'll just share a little thought here today the bible says favor is deceitful and beauty is vain but a woman that feareth the lord she shall be praised the lord had a blessing to the reading of his work let's pray father we thank you for uh what solomon has written here in scripture to us and uh certainly he is a man that's capable of writing such he had the experience when he asked you for wisdom the first thing that came before his presence was two mothers got one line and one telling the truth and um god he could tell through his uh through the way you gave him to discern the situation through the judgment who the true mother of the living baby was you can tell by the actions you could tell by the reactions he could tell who the true mother was and father he could take situations like that turn and write to us that favors deceitful and beauty is vain but a woman that feareth the lord shall be praised i pray god that you bless each and every mother here on this mother's day i pray that you give stream to those that have lost their mother god and uh we're believers know that mama is waiting on the other side just a few days from now we'll be all together again and father we're looking forward to that we're expecting that and just trusting that you lord jesus would continue to carry us through the great storms of life amen the trials and tribulations that we face may you be glorified and magnified in our midst on today it's in jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you you can be seated in the presence of the lord we want to just draw our thought right from the scripture amen here it says a woman that feareth the lord she shall be praised amen a woman that feareth the lord she shall be praised um let's just start by reading a man a little quote here from the message teaching on amen and our brother mike mondelis so good to have brother mike in the house amen this precious wife and and the kids man the kids the family but mike you look different brother but you look good amen glory to god glory to god amen so um um here in this sermon teaching of moses uh brother branham makes a statement and just says now to mother's day says i want to express myself real good says i got an old grey-headed mother setting there myself and i think a day all right but every day every day should be a mother's day just not once a year says the reason these mother's day things are going on now and i see we just got a handful and we all know one another we're home folks that's the reason we're gonna talk this way so i think that a mother should be respected uh every day the same see don't don't just respect on mother's day she should be respected every day the same amen might you don't talk to any kind of way on the other days that it's not mother's day and then all of a sudden on mother's day you start being nice no no no she should be respected every day the same praise the lord somebody amen and let me let me go a little further for you brothers that got wives that bore your kids that's the that's the mama respect they mama all right come on now amen i think that the mother should be respected every day the same that's right a real mother but this day they call mothers there's nothing in the world but a big commercial nonsense says just just to drain people for money amen and it's a disgrace to mother now don't use that quote the wrong way because somebody said yo you heard what brother jack say we ain't going not to eat because they out he's just trying to drain us money if you're not gonna take out the day because it's too busy i know you take it out tomorrow come on somebody you're going to make it up some kind of way you ain't just going to use the quote to your advantage all right church right all right he said he says um just to drain the people money but we'll send her a little bunch of flowers and that'll settle it that's not mother it says my goodness a real mother is a woman that one that raised you and you love her and you see her and you talk to her all the time express your love to her all the time not just one day in a year i say amen to that we want to say happy mother's day to all these mothers and and i can say i want to take time today just to encourage you amen you're doing a fine job you're doing a great job amen and we appreciate you uh we appreciate you all uh i want to just hit this scripture in proverbs 31 and 10 and um just going back to their this this this this this whole uh portion of scripture is talking about you know just a good wife right a good wife and here in verse 10 it makes this statement says who can find a virtuous woman if a price is far above rubies and uh you know so i you know as i started just kind of processing some of this i thought about this uh this word virtuous just got a little note here in my bible this work virtuous who can find a virtuous woman that word is a woman of valor right or a uh and when you when you look at the word valor it means that she's she's marked with courage praise the lord uh and and we could also the other definition they got here is personal heroism your mama's a hero your mama's actually your superhero glory to god your mama rescued you from a lot of stuff come on somebody right but but we got to learn how to stop and appreciate our mothers some of the decisions that you would have made had you not talked to mama you would have made the bad a bad decision so we thank god so so so a woman that's a virtuous woman is one that's marked with courage and and i found it i found it also in my life that my mama was one uh was marked with courage because she had the ability to speak truth to me even when i didn't want to hear it come on somebody she spoke truth even when i didn't want to hear i mean other people wouldn't approach me but my mama she knew she she knew she had that she had the right to be able to say the things that she wanted to say and i thank god that she had the courage enough to say it it changed my life when i i could think about this you know this this this woman that's smart with courage recently uh as we were you know just getting away last last week for our anniversary the lord has blessed me and my wife to see 28 years of marriage and i'm very grateful you know for for that amen we're approaching 30 and uh and and my just where did the time go we used to be the young people now we the number one choir right and uh and i thank god you know for it but uh but you know i we were we were just talking as we were driving up there to uh north carolina on last week and and we got into a discussion about you know what's your favorite scripture and she was asking him to say what was your favorite script i'd say now that's a hard question to answer that's a very i mean it's so many favorites she said i say but if i have to choose one i'm gonna go with romans chapter eight i'm gonna just go with that one you know because uh it seemed like that seemed to apply to every area of my life i i know that all things are gonna work together for good because i love god and i'm called according to his purpose hallelujah amen every time i walk into my office i see my little bucket inside my office and i get inspiration from that because you know as i walk into the office sometimes i'm walking in with a new problem sometimes i'm walking in with a new situation but i can just take whatever the situation is and i can put it on a sheet of paper and i can just throw it inside my romans 8 28 bucket and no matter what i'm going through the bible say that all things will work together for good because i love god and i'm called according to his purpose amen also in romans 8 amen and say if god be for me good god almighty who can be against me i get strength i get encouragement when i read that chapter hey i i love paul he says he said he said say i i'm persuaded that things present glory to god things that's going to come he said height nor death nor any other creature he say nothing will separate me from the love of god which is in christ jesus my lord i love romans 8. hey man i i didn't i didn't catch the beginning i was saying because because sometimes the devil like to accuse you but when you just get to the beginning of it you know i got to read it now cause i can't i can't even remember romans 8 uh i mean it was there there's now therefore no condemnation to them who are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit so so when you realize that you are in christ and you ain't got to sit and listen to nothing the devil got to say somebody recently how you know when the devil lying every time he opens his mouth especially when he talking about me there is no condemnation i refuse to wear the badge of condemnation because i mean i'm walking and in the spirit after christ hallelujah hallelujah so you know i was saying that that's that one of my favorite passages you know just just um romans 8 and and and my wife took me and said she'd say you know one of my favorite passages i'd have to say it's a little different from the norm say but it would be judges for she didn't use judges for you just say the story of jail george judges four i said wow that that would be one of your favorites to say yes i say and i just had to kind of ask like you know why why would that be one of your favorite and should say because um you know sisters don't really you know they can't preach they can't this they can't that they can't this so they're not really talked about much y'all get what i'm saying she said she said but but this woman was a woman of courage oh glory to god somebody and and as i thought about that in process that you know i'ma just take a little time and just share with you all a little about a little bit about jail you can find a story in judges for i won't read it all right now but but what was going on is that the children of israel uh found themselves in a situation this this i didn't realize it till right now but it connects with what brother troy was talking about you know he said he said say you know the children of israel found themselves in a situation where they get free for a season then they bound for the next season and then they start praying and asking god to send him a delivery and god will raise up in the liver and then they go free again for maybe another 30 years or 40 years then all of a sudden they go right back into bondage they could not break that cycle my god and in the days of judges you know here uh there come a time where they they they wanted to be free from the oppression that they were under and uh and and and unfortunately if i could put it that way because i don't think it should be this way unfortunately god had to use a man a couple women to kind of help get the people to freedom i don't think that's the perfect will of god they had a prophetess that had to lead the nation by the name of deborah at that time the men in the army were afraid to go to battle oh good god almighty the man was demanding i'm deborah prophesied and told him god gonna give you caesar god's gonna deliver y'all from the enemy get up and get ready to fight and and and barack was the leader at that time his name was barack and i and barack said you know what i'm not even gonna go to battle unless you go with me now i think that's sad that a man won't even go out to battle unless this woman is with him what about what about i won't go to battle unless god is with me that's where he should have been that's where his faith should have been but his faith was so much in deborah you know what deborah said to ever say i'm going to go with you a woman of valor a woman of course a virtuous woman right i'll go with you say but i want to tell you something because you didn't just move out by faith based on the prophecy god ain't gonna even allow you to get glory in the victory the victory gonna be given to a woman the victory gonna be given to one and see if i see if i was a sister right now i would have grabbed that i say the victory gonna be given to a woman i'm gonna say i'm claiming the victory right now i'm claiming it for myself whatever situation i'm claiming victory you know you can claim victory before your battle gets started oh y'all ain't with me you can claim victory before your battle gets started you already know the outcome gonna be i the outcome is i cannot lose will not lose refuse to lose no matter what it looks like i'm not gonna lose oh my god but but he said she said she said look you ain't gonna be able to enjoy the rewards of victory because it's gonna be given to a woman now they didn't know what was gonna happen but here in the battle you know they're sitting there waiting for the battle to kind of get started and when everybody got positioned to a certain place deborah's saying now rise barack get up now it's time to go fight and god gonna give you the victory in this get ready barack i don't care how many soldiers he got don't look at the numbers god if god is for you then who can be against you she said she said she said rise barack barack got up and they went down and started battling and the king cisera the leader of the other army that had them under oppression he took off running when he saw that his army was defeated and as he took off running he ran into this little city and uh and here this woman amen jael was there and she recognized who he was she said now why don't you come on into my tent everything's gonna be all right just come on into my tent and he said he say no not now well when i come in if anybody come ask if a man in here just tell him no just lie to him and tell him no she said yeah oh don't worry you're going to be safe right here and jail yeah uh i mean so seriously i'm a little thirsty could you give me something to drink say i want some water he said yeah i got something for you she went and got some milk you thirsty here drink this milk and somehow the milk just put em put this fella to sleep and he didn't realize what was going on but there he was sleeping in this latest tent and i don't know i didn't recognize but the way that she killed him is while he was sleeping she took a hammer with a nail you talk about a virtuous woman you you talk about a a woman marked with valor this woman would kill a king for the sake of her people and i'm gonna tell you there's some mothers that are standing in the gap for the sake of their children they'll go through great extremes [Applause] she took a ham and a nail and went through that man's temple and when they went looking for cesaris to say i got him right here in my tent what was your battle strategy milk [Applause] no sword no shield milk sometimes we're looking for all these great things but if you just do what god has called you to do with the little that you got it'll get the job done i was thinking on this this woman jael showed that she was a virtuous woman she was marked with courage she had personal heroism she was a woman of valor and i thought about my wife actually saying that this was one of her favorite scriptures and the thought came to me that when you are a virtuous woman then you will identify with other virtuous women so i'm calling my wife a virtuous woman this morning when you are a virtuous woman then you will identify with other virtuous women and that's why when i was going through that story a lot of sisters said amen amen that's right they virtuous women hallelujah all right we were thinking jaye was a woman that had purpose let's put it this way if jail was a housewife she wasn't out at the battle she was at home taking care of the tent but she had purpose had she not been home so sarah would have never came to her house had she been out gossiping she would have missed her opportunity to deliver oh come on somebody but because she was a virtuous woman because she did what she needed to do at home she was able to be a part of a prophecy y'all preaching to me now y'all preaching to me yeah i'm preaching i like it i like it let me keep going [Applause] cause i ain't gonna stop it jail that's just part of the sermon but what i want you to understand is that she had purpose and i want you sisters to realize here today that no matter what what you do in life you have purpose god god has established you god has placed you here with purpose you didn't come by a mistake you're not an accident now you came because god had a plan for you i want to read just a little statement here from the message influence we this is just part of our discussion amen and and and and we were just kind of talking and my wife found this quote i said send me the quote send me the quote send me the quote so i want to read it to you say we must we mustn't try to impersonate anyone uh just be what you are yeah oh i got a lot i can say right there just be what you are be what god made you right right and that's the way god made you you you never fashion yourself and remember as much as we ministers would like to take billy graham's place we cannot do it neither can billy graham take our place right he says uh see we we each one has something to do the common little fella here that may be a janitor the little woman that may be a housewife the greatest minister on the face of the earth today cannot take your place listen god had a purpose in making you what you are i'm gonna just leave that just just for a second i have to just touch on that a little bit god had a purpose for making you what you are oftentimes we see certain characteristics in certain people and we want to try to help them get rid of those characteristics [Music] a wife might see something her husband and she don't like she you can take you can take it down sis uh a wife might see something the husband has seen him like she's gonna try to help him get rid of that characteristic a husband gonna see some of his wife that he don't like he gonna try to help her get rid of that characteristic no you married that characteristic and let me just help you understand you are not god praise the lord it's not your job to get rid of the characteristic god gave that person that characteristic for a reason all right i'm gonna go a little further i'm gonna use just my own my own house is that all right yeah but but my wife all her life as a young young young young young girl she was always told she's always told what to do and she didn't i mean she just told him that's just the way she talked she wasn't she wasn't trying to say nothing to be nothing that's just the way she is but it just seemed to rub people the wrong way sometimes sometimes what i found in my own life is that when i had somebody calling asking for something maybe a bill collecting i don't tell you that this is when i'm gonna do it now i don't need you still bothering me cause i told you when you're gonna do it i got a weapon in my house come on somebody you want i'ma let you talk to my wife she got a way of saying things to keep you from calling him [Music] see god gave her certain characteristics and they can be used at certain times to be a blessing to you [Music] here's the other side of that because that characteristic is there sometimes i got to just live with it you can't just use it when you want to use it [Music] but you begin to thank god for how he made a person how he designed the person he gave them that because it was for his glory let me go a little further in the quote is that all right so um he says here you god had a purpose in making you what you are and you just serve god in that way that he made you serve god in the way that he made you now that some people say this just the way god made me now you know some stuff you need to get rid of and the other part of the bible say lay aside every sin and every weight that's so easily beset you hallelujah don't you just got to get you just got to accept me for who i am because this is what god made that's why you can't you can't have that type of attitude praise the lord but there's a time where you got to realize cause sometimes the devil will beat you up so bad about who you are and who god made you that you got to know god you i know you made me this way for a reason i don't know why it just keep rubbing everybody the wrong way but help me lord god help me sometimes i just say things i don't know why i got to be the one to always say things but i just happen to be that person god some folk just don't say nothing this said but i'm not that one but it's okay i'm trying i'm trying to find a balance here for you hey man i i mean the word we're going to take care of all of us and my purpose is not to try to bring the word to try to shave this off you know the word will take care of you god will take care of you amen amen all right look let me go a little further uh it says uh god had a purpose to make you what you are and you just serve god in that way that he made you and i think if we would just do that the wheels would roll a lot easier yes it would if we would do that not get lifted up we find out instead of you know going that route getting lifted up amen then uh the you know just just stay humble before god and everything around just just a lot smoother now can i just go uh to proverbs 31 and 30. the bible declares favor is deceitful how many of us just love to hear us hear people talk about preaching to me already everybody like to tell everybody that i got favor and faith ain't fair like sister nelly said fame ain't fair you know what it just means that you got the blessings of god flowing in your life but that's not what this scripture is talking about because this scripture say favor is deceitful and then it put in beauty is vain now it connects these two things favor is defeatful and beauty is vain well what is solomon trying to tell us in this favor means charm and what i've come to realize is that there's some women that will try to get by in life through charm and through beauty but the the other part to it is that they don't fear the lord which means they don't have character you can take that scripture down see favor is fable is deceitful that means child right amen charm or deceit and and also they try to use them the the beauty fluttering the eyes a little bit and you know come on you know you know you know you know you know how women try to work at some time but but i'm gonna tell you like this that that type of stuff don't last glory to god i'm just looking at a little note here from a man by the name of h uh h a ironsides a man he wrote this commentary on the proverbs on a book wrote commentary in a book called proverbs and song of solomon and as he looked at that scripture amen he made the statement says others may pride themselves on their beauty or endeavor to obtain favor by winning words and pleasing manners hallelujah but if there be no true character behind such charms the day will soon come when praise will give place to contempt i want to read that again all right if there be no true character behind such charms you got to watch when women are always trying to push you up a little bit as a man she got a reason for keep saying them things oh yeah y'all ain't gonna talk to me in here she got a reason for saying that young man you watch a woman that's always laughing at all your jokes you know you ain't that funny [Music] fable is deceitful all right says but if there be no true character behind such charms the day will soon come where praise will give place to contempt while she who fears jehovah will be honored by all who appreciate virtue and excellence of spirit her beneficent laborers too will receive their public and well-merited recognition sometimes you do things in secret it seems like nobody see what you do mama but there comes a time where god rewards you openly for the things that you've done in secret the stand that you had to take in secret i thought about this i thought about this and you know i won't have time to read it but you know there was time brother brennaman come here to um to florida and he ran into a woman uh down in miami he was having meetings and uh when he ran it you know he was there and and one of the brothers say uh brother you know this ground that we have uh the duchess is the one that made a a way for you to get this girl who's saying the the the who the duchess the dudgey say he say is she saved is she filled with the holy ghost he said i don't know about that you can talk to about that but he said well what's what what what make up better than everybody else he said he said just say hi to the woman if you don't mind brother he said okay i say hi to and say he walked around the corner and i i it says it was a a a rather large lady and she said he said she had glasses on and there's kind of way out here specs on and they're saying i can't know how to see through no glasses way out there he said she had jewelry all over her hands and all over her neck saying she was just she just just full of charm and she said she said she says are you dr branham he say uh doctor brandon i'm saying no i'm not dr brandon i'm brother branham she said well dr branham i am charmed to meet you and put a hand out like that he's he grabbed a hand he said i'm gonna tell you like he's like he said i grabbed her fat hand that's how he said it he said i grabbed a fat hand and pulled it down and said let me i wanna i wanna i wanna know you the next time i see you so bring it down here so i can shake your hand see through charm through beauty through all this that she's trying to you know persuade somebody say i can see right through that that is deceitful woman don't use that you just need good godly character if you're gonna make a difference in somebody's life i thought about this because you know favor favor favor where where's another woman in scripture that we can look at that probably thought that she had favor i i think i want to read this and i didn't write this down but i think it's in matthew let me just take a quick look here real quick matthew chapter um oh lord um this i want to read about herodias y'all help me find that uh in scripture i know it's early part of matthew and what i thought was matthew two or three but let me just see something here you know it's not two oh god help us here y'all just do a quick search on your phone for herodius and i didn't write it down but i know it's in matthew and um and i just want to i want to take time to read about her because she is she is a woman that would have just find herodias matthew matthew what now it's about when she came to church matthew 14. all right thank you very much thank you all very much i appreciate it so let's let's get this matthew 14 and uh yes there it is matthew 14 and verse one let's let's pick this up this is a woman to me that is trying to use her charm trying to use a charm and look at this because you know the scripture clearly tells us that uh favor deceitful and beauty is vain hallelujah but look at look at look at look look look at herodias bob says at at that time herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of jesus and said unto his servants this is john the baptist he has risen from the dead and therefore mighty works do show forth themselves in him for herod had laid hold on john and bound him and put him in prison for sake his brother philip's wife for john said unto him it is not lawful for thee to have her now you know when we read the scripture it's very uh easy for us to just kind of say okay that's all happy just you know it's not a lot for that it wasn't it was it's more it's more to it than that what this is is amen they were having church like we have in church today and uh um you know herod was the type of man that he he actually enjoyed being in church come on somebody he enjoyed hearing the word of god and there was a time that he met jesus said he wanted to see a miracle this man this man that really enjoyed the supernatural but he had a lust problem that he couldn't get delivered from hallelujah with that lust problem he ended up marrying his brother's wife her name was herodias hallelujah amen not only i mean married to brother's wife and and now he's taking care of brother's child and he should have never had this woman as wife he knew he shouldn't have did that right but he didn't know he broke all the laws of the word in order to have this woman and one day they were in church like we are right now and and and herodias decides i want to make a grand entrance i don't want to get that 30 minutes early and pray y'all ain't talking to me yet i don't want to get there i mean the way i'm dressed today i need everybody to see how i'm dressed hallelujah somebody so i'm going to walk into the church a little bit late because i want to make sure people see me and as she was coming through the church with her husband with her child the sermon was already being preached so so now you know when when everybody's attention i turn to them and watching them come in with all the pump and circumstance and as they're getting to their seats still standing up john yells out it's not lawful for you to have her and i can just imagine herodias she say is he talking to to me john i can see john cause he was born i said it i'ma say it again it's not lawful for you to have her you done broke the law the laws of god you then broke the laws of god to take her marriage and divorce is god's laws not man's laws i want to say that again marriage and divorce is god's laws not man's laws we're not gonna let the the world redefine what marriage is marriage is still between a man and a woman god established that not man oh they just love each other no they don't love each other they got a spirit a man want a married man that's a spirit a woman want to marry a woman that's a spirit i told y'all i'm gonna stay over there i told y'all i was coming it's spirits and people still need to be delivered i'm gonna tell you because john priest like what i'm just preaching john had his last sermon that day well i wouldn't say that day he preached some more but but what happened is that there was a sea planet and herodias mind she said i'ma get him i don't know how long it took but she i mean she left she couldn't hear nothing else in the sermon all she heard was it's not lawful and that thing just kept ringing out but one day herod decides man it's my birthday i'm gonna throw myself a nice party and i want some dancers now y'all got to be with me on the scene why we never talk about nobody just coming in and break dancing no this man wanted dancers what we call provocative dancers he had a love spirit all that time in church he still had a love spirit he still had a love spirit hallelujah but here he here you know here he was and you know he said i want some provocative dances and and and he's so so messed up that that they sent out a dancer before and you know who was dancing his own daughter not the one not the one he had by by by giving birth to himself he took his brother's wife and now let's say his niece but because he's married to the mama he be it becomes his daughter and she then so prov can you imagine this i couldn't imagine one of my i can imagine myself sitting there and looking at a niece of mine [Applause] twerk oh y'all ain't gonna talk to me today yeah and i'm gonna just be honest i don't even know none of the new dances but twerking was bad enough and i know when the devil released that it was going to get worse [Music] just recently can i just just be honest and tell y'all things that happened i was i was we were there in south carolina and coming for getting breakfast and i and i pulled out the you know to get on the road and and there was a lady stop that the a car stopped at the light uh these uh uh young ladies was in the car and um one of the young ladies she saw me standing there she just i'm standing at the restaurant she she got up stuck her rear in out the window and started provocatively moving i'm like what in the world this what city what what is this they don't even do this where i come from but but it's spirits on people people need to be delivered right hallelujah and i'm just you know i didn't i'm not i'm not on tick tock but my niece was just sharing how you know some of these dances that they released tick tock was set up so people can do all these provocative dances and she said you know it's not just the sin is doing it some of the saints in the church pick up these spirits [Music] saints in the church pick up the same spirits and you think god is blessing that can you do that in front of jesus you might you might need to get rid of your account if it's affecting you like that but this this this woman herod is saying you know what get get uh you know your daddy they've been drinking go out there you know do it like this and do it like that and do it like you can just see all the advice that she was given she went out there and did it and next thing you know by the time that dance was over he said look up to half my kingdom i will give you anything you ask for a lust spirit did that to him she she she didn't expect to get an answer like that so when she said mama mama mama he said up to half the kingdom whatever actually uh i can have mama what should i ask for you know what the mama said give me the head of john the baptist in a charger he was sad that he had to do it but he let some words out of his mouth and as the king he couldn't take his work back i'm going to tell you something when god releases something out of his mouth he cannot take it back [Music] if god promised you that your house can be saved he can't take it back i don't care what they going through don't you look at that don't don't worry about that look at the promise because god can't take his word back if you were baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ that's what he said right hallelujah he said he said he says your children those that are far off as men as the lord like i should call that's what he promised you all you got to tell god is what he said man i had i had a need i had a need and i still got a need in my business and the lord just kind of the lord just kind of put my spirit i i will supply all your needs not just your financial needs if you need workers i'm going to give you a need i'm going to supply that need right if you if you need money i'm going to supply that need if you need customers i'm gonna supply that need whatever your need is i am god that will supply all of your needs if you need wisdom i'm gonna supply that need if you need knowledge you need understanding i will supply the need if you need a new job i supply to these whatever your need is god will supply we just hold up hold a promise to god that's what god god gave us the promise we just hold it up to him and let him take care from now i'm but this this this this woman and i want to read a little bit about her if i can just give me an invasion of the united states and give me uh i'm a skip down give me paragraph 251 this woman had her daughter danced before her husband in such a provocative manner that it brought death to a prophet of god now she might have thought she got away with it oh yeah i i i guarantee he won't preach no more sermons like that not not long as i'm living she thought she got away with it well we're going to see something here in scripture i'm sorry in this quote that she didn't get away with it look at what happened the seed that she planted see see see favor is deceitful beauty is vain but a woman that feareth the lord shall be praised here now let me tell you let me just tell you another mother right quick in the bible before we close there was a mother called herodia she taught her daughter to tap dance she wanted her to be popular and she danced before the king and required the head of john the baptist we have a record of 70 of her offspring this damn so that dance herodias daughter danced before herod 70. of her offspring they either died prostitutes or on gallows see what she did actually affected generations and i need you to understand something today mama what you are doing is impacting generations you bring them to the house of the lord you see the next generation come to the house of the lord and i'm gonna tell you when you have trained up your child the way that they supposed to go the bible say they're not going to depart now here's the other thing the good thing about this uh brother branham says say now they might depart but it will never depart from them how do you know that because when y'all get around at the at the table at the house the things that they start talking remember we was in this church service and then that that's all that's in them that's all that they remember because you brought them up in the ways of god and if that's all that's in them that's what's going to bring them back it goes on in this he says one mother taught hers the things of the world the other mother taught her hers the things of god one became a great leader to conquer immortal among men today and the other is botched and inhaled and taken thousands times thousands with her see what i mean bring up a child in the way it should go now when he's when he's talking about the other mother he's talking about moses mother because mother moses mother what a blessing that was this is a woman that feareth the lord the time they were in such bondage and they knew that the delivery was supposed to be coming but she didn't know what to do and and here you know um as this um uh she's in this pregnancy and maybe uh the law changes real quick kill all the babies under two years old so she realized that you know what i got a baby that's gonna fit that category and my baby gonna get killed soon as i give birth to it so here you know she's wondering and praying and lord what should i do god gives amram you know a uh a vision of make a little ark and do this and do that and just put the baby inside the ark glory to god and and and as they get the vision they give birth to the baby and you say she said now i'm gonna have to give this baby up to god a little baby i'ma have to give this baby up to god send it down the nile river and i don't know what's gonna happen with my baby but lord i trust what you said i'm just gonna give my baby to you and let you take care of it sometimes mamas you get yourself in a situation the only person you can give that baby to is the god god gonna take care of it by faith she pushed the baby out the nile river down the nile river crocodiles there snakes there all kind of trouble that's waiting for moses but but moses had a purpose so here moses in the nile river and and not one crocodile come nears it not one one one snake come near nothing bothers a baby and here comes mother's sister just walking down watching where the baby goes and by the grace of god the baby ends up in pharaoh's court with pharaoh's daughter and here she's you know she said she looked at the baby and and and the bible say how how how she just began to have compassion on the baby a little baby look she said a hebrew baby now she should have killed her but she had compassion on the baby and they're here moses sisters say now you know uh they're kind of trying to figure out so this this baby we want to take care of the baby but none of us been pregnant and um so milk not really flowing through our veins we don't know how we're going to feed this baby we'll know what we're going to do and bonuses to say would you like me to find one of the hebrew mothers to come and take care of the child she said go you know where miriam went home she would knock it on the front to mama mama i got something i got something you're gonna have to sit down and let me tell you what happened you know that baby you released uh my little brother so he ended up in pharaoh's court and pharaoh's daughter has it and she's looking for a hebrew mother that would come and take nurse to baby for and train the baby and teach the baby she's looking for a hebrew mother and mama i can think of nobody else to do this but you when you release things to god god got a way of doing things because god allowed moses mama to raise him in pharaoh's house teach him the things of god and while she did all that the the good news the the the the cream i mean on top of this the cherry on the top is that she got paid for taking care of her own baby what a god we serve but she raised moses and told him that he was going to be the deliverer she she sold positive things into moses and moses grew up in that with that in his mind and mama's i'm going to tell you what are you sort of in your children's mind right now what are you telling what do you say don't tell them things that you ain't gonna never be nothing you're gonna be just like your daddy don't tell them things like that unless they daddy positive you're gonna be a doctor you're gonna be a lawyer you you got brains you you are a smart child you awesome child find out what their gifts are and encourage them in their gifts but because she did the right thing with her son she feared the lord later on she was praised because her son like brother brother branham said uh is he stands i mean her son's uh we quote him still today when we read the scripture moses did this moses did that moses great prophet of god because he was under the right care of a mother notice the father wasn't able to go to the the palace to train them mama did i want to go back to the scripture let's go back to proverbs 31. uh and just we i i i i am going to take time and read it i am because i am going to skip it but i want i want to i was looking here in my bible and they they they said this is 22 points about an excellent wife 22 points we hear in proverbs 31 verse 10 let's start there and verse 10 is just tell us that if you got a good wife or you got a good mother the first thing you need to know she's rare you don't find that many of them round she's red so appreciate what you got the bible says who can find a virtuous woman but her price is far above rubies she's rare uh verse 11 uh we find that she's trustworthy because the heart of her husband does safely trust in her so that she shall have no need of spoil the next verse finds that she's constant in her love verse 12 says she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life verse 13 the next verse says she it says that she's industrious she seeketh wool and flax and worketh willingly with her hands that means she's industrious that means she's zealous and she's diligent all right uh verse five i mean the next verse 14 tells us that uh that she's thrifty says she is like the merchant ships she bringeth her food from afar you need a you need a wife that's thrifty you need a wife that's thrifty amen glory to god she she when she go to the store she look for clarence [Music] if you got a thrifted wife she'll always come back and she'll say guess how much i paid for this oh come on somebody that's when you know you got a thrifty wife guess how much i paid for this you look at say uh 20 30. i paid five dollars and a big smile go on your face hallelujah because she's like the merchant ship she's bringing her food from afar she's thrifty the next verse verse 15 it says this she riseth also while it is yet night and giveth meat to her household and a portion to her maidens and and that it says she is self-starting she's self-starting right the next verse verse verse uh 16. uh it's telling us that she is enterprising she considers the field and buyeth it with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard it said and and i'm just looking at this note that they put in my scripture i mean and my bible says that she's enterprises which means she's willing to undertake a project she has initiative i'm describing some of your wives in here i'm describing your mother's in here she's willing to undertake a project she shows initiative all right the very next verse uh uh verse 17. it says she girdeth alones with strength and strengtheneth her arms and and what they say that means she's willing to do hard work somebody ought to say thank god for mama glory to god she's willing to do hard work let me go to the next verse verse 18 says she perceiveth that her merchandise is good her candle goes not out by night what that means is that she is willing to work long hours somebody ought to say i thank god for my mama i thank god for my wife she's willing to work long hours hallelujah uh ver the next verse verse 19. uh she laid the hands to the spindle and her hands hold the dis staff now what this means that she is willing to do monotonous work it don't have to be exciting all the time but she realizes there's a purpose for her working so she's willing to do the monotonous work let's go on the next verse verse 20. uh it says this she she stretcheth out her hand to the poor yay she reaches forth her hands to the needy and what that says she is a compassionate woman glory to god all right the next verse verse 21 says she is not afraid of the snow for her household for all her household are clothed with scarlet and what they're trying to say that and that is she is prepared for the future can i go a little further all right uh and and the next verse verse 22 it says she maketh herself coverings of tapestry her clothing is silk and purple this means she is a good seamstress it's good to have a wife that's a good seamstress that don't mind picking up a needle and putting a button back on sometime come on somebody you ought to thank god for a wife like that thank god for a mother like that let's go on a little further verse the next verse verse first verse 23 it says this her husband is known in the gates when he sitteth among the elders of the land that means her she is married to a leader a virtuous woman is married to a leader and i'm gonna tell you every man in the house is a leader because god has called you to lead your family so every woman in here is married to a leader all right let's go on verse verse 24 it says this uh she maketh fine i find linen and seth and delivereth girdles unto the merchant this means that she is an entrepreneur come on somebody she know how to make some money when times get rough oh i know i i my wife was pretty good with uh ebay hallelujah it used to be packages going out caught that then y'all now amazon got them coming in but they be they be thrifty deals let me keep going let me keep going verse 25 it says this strength and honor are her clothing and she shall rejoice in time to come that means she is not swayed by circumstances my main just looking at right now i'm looking at what will be cause she's holding on to god's promise she's not swayed by circumstances let me go a little further verse 26 says this she openeth her mouth with wisdom and in her tongue is the law of kindness good god almighty she is wise and kind all right verse 27 uh it says she looketh well to the ways of her household and eat of not the bread of idleness this means she is duty-conscious verse 28 it says her children will rise up and and call her bless her husband also and he praiseth her husband shouldn't be speaking down to his wife uh calling her all kind of names negative names no speak positive if you tell her she ain't nothing guess what she ain't nothing but if you tell you the best thing that ever happened to me outside of my salvation i thank god for you you the smartest woman oh wow where would i be without you say something positive i ain't getting away man i'm gonna say it again say something positive and if you and they use my mom used to tell me this if you can't say something positive don't say nothing at all all right and i know sometimes things happen you just don't want to say nothing positive but you got to learn to say it anyway speak speaking all right i'm going on where where where what what verse was it 20 uh i'm at 29 all right um this this this verse says many daughters have done virtues but thou have thou excellence them all what that means that she's not satisfied with mediocre i want the best verse 21 i mean verse verse uh uh 30 says this favor is deceitful and beauty is vain but a woman that feareth the lord she shall be praised that means she is a woman of god the next verse says give her of the fruit of her hands and let her own words praise her in the gates this means that she is praiseworthy now i'm coming down to the close of my sermon here and i i want to take some time to do something that i don't think i've ever done and i'm gonna take time to do it today first of all i i'm grateful um that the lord has blessed me with a mom wonderful mom god fearing woman of god i recently had to go through a little surgery there and the doctor that was performing the surgery asked her in the office are you a woman of god she said yes i am and you know and she ain't got to you know kind of say that and be like um no she can say that with confidence yes yes i am a woman of god he said well i'm a man of god and i just want to pray with you before we do we go through this procedure and it just brought a comfort and god brought her peace and everything and she went through the procedure we thank god for that but i want to just take time to give credit to my mother who taught me the things of god she was a real example to me and she taught me the things of god a couple of things i wrote down here she encouraged me to read the book of proverbs as a young man and much of what i read helped to shape the decisions that i made in my life and i didn't want to read proverbs but my mama was the one that said jack just read proverbs just read proverbs and i remember you know there was a particular situation in proverbs where uh it warned a young man about going down a certain street because there'd be a lady there waiting for him lurking just waiting for him and uh and and he don't realize this lady got she gonna be trying to use some charm she's gonna be trying to use some some other things and she got a trap set for him and my mama would just kind of tell me just read that and i remember you know being at work and it got me a good job but uh but she knew i was surrounded on that job by a lot of ladies that didn't mean no good and just say jack be careful jack watch this jack watch that now i'm a grown man i'm thinking i ain't mommy you'll need to tell me that but when mama say that i know she's trying to tell me something without telling me something maybe she heard something that i heard because women talk amongst women praise the lord so jack be careful so i learned just be careful and one of the things that i always do when i go to work i'm going to give y'all brothers just a piece of advice when you go to work in your mayor always talk about your wife in front of other women i mean always my wife said this and my wife did that and what happens they begin to pick up on the subtle hints that this man is not just married this man is happily married all right i thank god for her corrections and teaching me even when i didn't want to be corrected but her correction and her teaching me kept me out of jail and kept me off the streets i thank god for my mother i remember my mother was the one that discouraged me from going to the military i had in my mind that i was going to go to the air force and and mama told me that that wasn't a place for a man like me mama went to the marines and she knew what the military life was all about and so she said military is not uh not for a young man like you mama knew that there were certain qualities in me that had not come to fruition even at that time but her wisdom even though i didn't want to hear it is what brought me to the place that i am today i thank god for my mother my mom remained committed to praying for her family even when we were all walking contrary to the word of god i appreciate her prayers because his prayers has brought me to where i am today i thank god for my mother one of the things that happened in my mama's life is that she got to a spot where she really began to search for truth she we had gone to the baptist church and we had gone to the pentecostal church we had done a lot of things but she wanted truth and my mom was the only one to find out that knew where her pastor and the pastor's wife was at the time the church was going through a lot of things we didn't know what was going on but my mom was the only one in the church knew where the pastor was he was gone for two weeks pastor went to find truth and pastor esco came and brought truth back here and that truth changed my life mama didn't realize as she was searching for truth that one day she would worship in spirit and in truth i thank god for my mother it's a little statement that is made that brother branham says here let me just give this jehovah jairus is the messenger i want to read from and then i'm going to bring this to a close jehovah jireh and so actually you know what let me do let me do uh no that's fine that's right it says and it says and so but if there is any credit to be given to the branham family and can i put the duff family let it go to her she's the one who deserves it who's he talking to now talking about his wife she stands between me and the public 37 years almost 37 years old almost completely white-headed and a real mother sweetheart a wife and look look at this statement says i trust that all of you boys when you get married you get a wife like god gave me i want to say the same thing about my wife on this day i trust you young brothers when you get married that you'll get a wife like god gave me because when i left home from mama i got married and god gave me a precious wife been married now for 28 years i'm gonna leave the quote right there that's enough for it and i want to just tell my wife today that i appreciate the sacrifices that she has made for her family uh when we come to church here praying every other tuesday it's because my wife had a burden to just get with some sisters and pray over different situations that were uh that were going on in our family she just want to get together and pray and and since that time the sisters have been praying uh every other tuesday and i appreciate that burden started with my wife and this has been something that's been a help to this church i thank god for her sacrifice i thank god for her desire to want to do that and and i believe it was on the last two that she told me that was we were we were on the road traveling back and she was still on the line praying she said it was 10 sisters joined her in prayer i want to say thank you to each one of you sisters that got on the line to pray god bless you prayer is changing thanks [Applause] i watched my wife sacrifice and buying things for her children even when she needed to spend the money on herself sometimes she'd go without getting her hair done in order to get the girl's hair done i'ma tell you something right now the lord bless us with three girls and lord lord lord girls are different than boys i could i i'll cut that boy i ain't taking him to the barber shop i'ma cut his hat but that girl you got to do some special things but and i watched my wife sacrifice time and time again to make sure that the girls had what they needed even when it when it meant that she had she had to go without herself i appreciated that prophet spoke a sermon mother's day and he said mother is happiest when her kitties are all gathered at the table and i see firsthand now that i got one daughter married and out of the house uh uh with with a grand a grandson uh when they come over i just watch how my wife just go into action she will cook she'll later spread out and she'd just be so happy to have everybody at home around the table i didn't realize what that meant until i saw it manifested in her praise the lord also i want to i want to say this um my wife was willing to sacrifice and actually cook a meal today for her family but i watched how she um let me put it this way when when she is cooking there's a tremendous sacrifice that she makes because everybody got different likes and dislikes some can't eat this some don't want to eat this praise the lord you know how that is mothers but but but but she realized that everybody got something a little look look that and sometimes it's just your body can't take that in it don't process it right right so i just can't do it but she realizes the likes and dislikes and sometimes she's not just making one meal she's making multiple meals for the family then i watched her that after she hadn't done all that people still come in and say i ain't hungry and sometimes i'm one of them i appreciate you dear i appreciate you i appreciate you i'm going a little further i watch my wife when we talk about a proverbs 31 woman i i got one i watched my wife get paid no more than 200 dollars per week no more than 200 dollars per week sometimes not getting paid at all but no more than 200 per week to watch over school and you go to any other school when they ask what the administrator is making but she was there making no more than 200 a week soaring into the lives of other children she made tremendous sacrifices tremendous sacrifices quit her job quit her job i remember brother west go calling me up saying say the lord telling me to tell you don't get satisfied on your job because he gonna take you off of that and i was like i can't see that right now i need this money to take care of my family you know what she said she said brother she said jack that's not for you that's for me i said what she said that's for me i can't get satisf she left a job she was about less than a year away from being fully vested and being able to get retirement benefits she walked away in order to take care of other people's children in school i thank god for a wife like that [Applause] i want to tell you today your sacrifice might not have been noticed by others but it was certainly noticed by god i watched my wife delay school and her career in order to take care of our family when i met her and we were recording one of her desires was to grow up and be a nurse that's what she wanted to follow the footsteps of a relative she wanted to grow up and be a nurse and uh to those that might be nurses here happy nurses week last week i believe yeah happy nurses week but uh but uh she wanted to be a nurse but actually if you ever sit down and really talk to my wife you realize that she could be also a lawyer but she gave all that up in order to be a mother and i appreciate that um i really appreciate that and and not only that i look at look at you know these things where she could have been a nurse she could have been a lawyer it could have been this could have been that but god chose for her to be the first lady at spirit of truth tabernacle and also blessed her to co-lead a home health business she wanted to be a nurse but now she's the co-owner of a home health business god knows how to turn things around he's always mindful of our desires and i just want to say she truly is a virtuous woman she's marked with courage and she's my personal hero to your mothers i just want to read a little poem here for it for you and i'm going to close this is that this is mysteries of motherhood by rhett bradley says mother's hearing she does not hear the car alarm the neighbor's music or the noise of playing children but from the other end of the house in the middle of the night she will hear a child's slightest whimper mother's mind she may not comprehend comprehend on how to use the latest technology but she understands a child's heart what whenever it hurts mother strength she may she may be too weak and exhausted to carry groceries in from the car how many out on her mama said come and get help me get these groceries she might be too weak or too exhausted to get the groceries from the car but she's strong enough to intimidate any who threatens her children mother's memory she may not remember where she put her keys or even the reason why she walked into the room but she never forgets the wonderful things her children do and say mother's clothes her clothes aren't so perfect they're stained by babies burps and last month's lasagna but each stain is a badge of love and service equal to anyone by a soldier mother's hands all she sees are the lines and wrinkles in her hands and longs for their youthful appearance but she forgets their weak she forgets their she forgets their wear speaks of love devotion and sacrifice mother's shape she sighs and moans when she cannot fit into the clothes of her youth but her shape and stretch marks are like battle scars which say kids you're worth it mother's eyes the mirror tells her that her eyes lack sparkle but the bags and fatigue betray love and burns bright all night long mother's career she is haunted sometimes by what she could have been but she equips generations and shapes the world's future mother's trust she doesn't trust enough to let you near the strange dog or to climb to the tip top branch but she believes in you when you're discouraged and full of self-doubt mother's significance she regrets her failures mourns her anger and she drink dread she is warping her children's psyches but she so tightly bonds her children to her heart that they will grow up but not away happy mother's day to all of our mothers let's pray father we want to take the moment we want to take the time we need to take more time but we want to take this moment this time to first thank you for the mothers that you've given us we wouldn't be the people that we are today i believe every child in here could say that we wouldn't be the people we are today if we didn't have the mother that you gave us thank you for shaping her and thank you for making her thank you for molding her thank you for keeping her thank you for revealing yourself to her because she could pass that down to us god we're we're we're truly grateful for what you've done and for the father we realize that we are next generation we're raising kids and grandkids and father we have to uh kind of take the same examples that our mothers taught us and lord do the the very best that we can father we know that if you're leading us we'll make it we'll be just fine i'm reminded of this quote lord that the prophet taught and maybe some mothers look around here today and they don't see all their children gathered around but the prophet told us that when mother sees the kid is gathered at the table at home and they're she's just so happy to see everybody there and dad there just everybody in their proper places it just does it just gives such joy to a mother it also says that if if it does it that way on earth then god you won't let it be lacking in heaven that somehow majestic fingers will unravel and untie the knots that are in a man the minds of our children and god somehow you'll bring them and set them free that they will be able to gather at the table on the other side we long for that we look for that i pray o god that you would bless each and every mother that has walked through this church today lord to hear the word of god bless them and keep them and strengthen them and encourage them lord we claim all of them as proverbs 31 women women of courage women of valor women of strength women of god these are your women we ask that you continue the lord just help them meet their needs in every way touch their bodies and encourage them and strengthen them in the midnight hour
