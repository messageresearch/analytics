person we would go to youth services and they would they would sing a song and I went looking for the words to this song I could not find them online uh and it's probably because I'm looking for the the wrong thing uh but some of the what I'm going to call the old young people amen they they they'll remember this one and and y'all don't have to worry about trying to trying to pick it up because it's it's a little it's it's it's back there if you can't find wordss online you know it's back there amen but it it said something like this it said I want to go to heaven when I die rest in my home up in the sky a place in glory I'm going to claim if I keep on bearing his name so I'm keeping the faith as I'm on with bound each and every day I'm climbing around by round it's an uphill Journey yes

heaven yes I got to make it to Heaven oh I got to make it to Heaven I want to make it oh I want to make it to heaven heaven oh my I I that that was from back in the day you see that that was a purpose of Us coming to services like this we had a desire in our heart that if the Lord Jesus was to call us home that we wanted to make it to heaven and you understand that if you picked up the paper every day and you looked inside the obituary section you would see that there are young people dying your age amen it's not just old people that die but young people die and I mean just recently in the in the in in the news they had uh some guys drove to a little party amen at a family was hosting in the park and guys drove through the park and just sprayed up the whole uh whole park and only person got hit was a three-year-old child lost her life just like that so you know we want to make it to heaven and uh that's the purpose that's the goal that's why we come we want our spirits to be fed we want to be encouraged by the word of God we want to live according to the word of God because we want to make it to Heaven amen amen that's the objective so I got to find that one I'mma I'll pull that

God Lord you are worthy tonight that we would all assemble here today to be under expectation oh God ready to receive of your Eternal Word heavenly father I'm reminded that over 2,000 years ago father you said it was finished Lord and God we find ourselves here today young and old still on the journey oh Father and God on this journey Lord you've given us a promise that the Holy Spirit Lord would be our strength so father we ask that you would honor your word Lord and that you would pour your spirit upon all the saints this evening that Lord God each one father would receive their portion father God you said your word would not return to you void so Lord we we hold dearly to your word God knowing that father it is your interest for us to be here father God I pray that you would Minister to every heart that you would anoint the hearts to receive your word Lord those watching online those that are watch even later may this be a word and due season father take control of me Lord and may you have your preeminence it's in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen praise the Lord praise the Lord I greet you all this evening in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ uh you guys may have your seats for a moment praise the Lord just want to take a moment to really just thank God for this opportunity uh it's never a lightweight when you come before the bride and uh really thank God for all the ministering Brethren that has come before me that has brought forth the word uh I've been very encouraged and uh it's it's it's it's what gives me strength and I want to thank God for our pastor a true Shepherd so uh my wife wasn't able to make it this evening we asked we'll keep her in prayer we also want to keep uh some of the saints that are not here in prayer as well praise the Lord I really enjoyed that special my brother uh that was a real blessing and I'll be coming back to you during my sermon prise God praise the lord well that being said uh let us stand we want to turn our Bibles this evening to Hebrews chapter 13 and starting at the 10th verse thought I'd be able to bring my laptop here but just a little take a little bit too much space you know uh I really really enjoy and and really look forward to ministering to the young people amen you know sometimes you forget that you were a young person um and I remember when I was I'm still a young person but I remember when I was younger right and uh you know those those years they go by really fast right and the blink of an eye that's exactly right so I trust this evening the young people will be very attentive to what the Lord has to say Amen praise the Lord and so we want to read the third 13th chapter of Hebrews starting at the 10th verse and we'll go to the 14th verse say Amen when you're there amen it reads we have an altar whereof they have no right to eat which serves the Tabernacle for the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin are burned without the camp wherefore Jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate let us go forth therefore unto him and I like that everything that God does is leading us forward not backwards that's right that's right you see let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp bearing his reproach for here we have no continuing City but we seek one to come right praise the Lord you all may have your seats God praise God may the Lord add a blessing to his reading today amen also want to take another scripture in Jude 1 verse one it says Jude the servant of Jesus Christ and the brother of James to them that are Sanctified by God the father and preserved in Jesus Christ and called now the scripture we just read in Hebrews just to paint a background we have an altar whereof they have no right to eat which serve the Tabernacle want you all to know when the Old Testament and the levitical law the priesthood offered before the Lord yeah and they had a offering and they also had a sin offering watch the thief would come he would have watched and would not have suffered his housest to be broken up you see too many times Saints we wait for the enemy to come and take something in order for us to seek the Lord earnestly wow wow we wait for our joy to dry out we wait for sickness to enter into our bodies we wait for the enemy to present a cause and for the young people you wait until your innocence is taken away you see but I say to you this evening don't wait until the thief comes to watch watch anyhow yes and young people look at your neighbor and say watch you see because if the if if if the good man of that hour would have watched he would have not have suffered his house to be broken up right amen and want to tell you young people there is Victory and abstinence yes and that is to abstain from the very appearance of evil am Joseph defeated future complexes by abstaining from the very appearance of evil amen keeping himself and running away from Evil verse 44 goes on to say therefore be ye also ready for in such hour as ye think not the son of man cometh be ready and I believe we're living in a Time Saints where we can expect for the son of man to come any moment so be ready to be on defense and be ready to be on offense praise the Lord and you know the interesting thing about being an offense in sports is that no matter how many baskets you score how many goals you score how many touchdowns you land there's a time where that clock hits zero yes you see and you have a final score but when you're in the offense with God the clock never stops the clock never started to begin with so you see you you just keep going Beyond this and beyond that from Victory to Victory from healing to Healing from Deliverance to Deliverance whatever the need is God's clock never stops praise God so wherever you are you can go beyond the camp amen praise the Lord amen scripture says formal things has passed away old things have passed away we heard it on Wednesday and I believe that there'll be a time where when we when it really settles in we'll realize the trials we've been faced with were too small to be worthy of our time right it won't necess it won't it won't even be a fault because you'll understand that greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world Paul says for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in Us Praise the Lord Matthew 24: 45 says who then is a faithful and wise servant whom his Lord hath made ruler over his house to give them meat and due season blessed is that servant whom his Lord when he cometh shall find doing so verily I say unto you that he shall make him ruler over all his Goods praise God the prophet of God says here in the message only believe now if we are acquainted with the supernatural would just take a man where that man in his senses is limited to his senses but a man in his spirit is unlimited amen and I just want to point out how many of us enjoy our senses how many of us enjoy waking up this morning and being able to feel touch smell hear and see those are senses we enjoy right but God has given has has prophet of God has tell us here this evening that in man in his spirit is unlimited it goes on to say the tree of knowledge can only climb so far and it breaks back but the Tree of Life goes on forever and how that science has taken man farther with his five senses than we have with his soul well we've got on tap resources where all things are possible talk about split atoms and the waves we have onta resources praise God yes praise God I want to turn to Genesis chapter 21 verse 14 and as we get there Saints the untapped resources you know I like to think sometimes when maybe we're doing a spring cleaning and as you're getting everything clean around the house you come across some treasured item that you haven't seen in years you realize oh where have this been but it's because you put it to you put it aside and there's some things if it's a treasure to you you can't put them aside and I encourage you young people don't ever put this word aside amen this word must be your treasure amen and to whom you obey to whom your heart is for you that's where your treasure is right so let your heart be towards this world word prise God now in Genesis 21 we'll stay here for a little bit but you know as a young person especially when you get to your teenage years sometimes you might feel like you don't have a voice because there's rules surrounding you wherever you go it's uh don't do this or you can do that so you feel like your voice is suppressed you see you have certain desires but you only have to write those desires down they can never be materialized I want to remind you this morning this afternoon young people that your voice is important and most importantly God hears your voice amen Genesis 21:14 says and Abraham rose up early in the morning and took bread in a bottle of water and gave it unto Hagar putting it on her shoulder and a child and sent her away and she departed and wandered in the wilderness of beer Sheba and the water was spent in the bottle and she cast a child under one of the shrubs now I want to want you to understand what's Happening Here young people Hagar is the uh Bond's woman the the the bondswoman of Abraham that Beed him a child and that child was ishmail that was the firstborn of firstborn son of Abraham right but here uh ishmail was was was was mocking uh was mocking Isaac and Sarah was not having it so Sarah told Abraham she got to go and that's exactly what happened that's right and now you find uh you find uh Hagar in the wilderness with her child and she's in a a state here where as a mother she's preparing the death of her child she's preparing the the the I mean it was so bad that she couldn't stand to look at it yes you see yes now as we continue verse 16 it says and she went and sat her down over against him a good way off as it were a bot for she said let me not see the death of the child and she sat over against him and lifted up her voice and wept and then I want to want to say this too is it's it's important young people that when you see your mother weeping when you see your father laboring and being steadfast in prayer don't watch them join them you see I'm going say that again when you see your mother praying and your father praying don't watch them join them amen because prayer produces things Prayer Changes Things and in this in this scene here we see Hagar crying out to the Lord and we heard it on Wednesday if you need something from the Lord cry out for it amen that's what she was doing she was crying out for it Glory but you see Hagar wasn't alone and it's necessary for God to hear the voice of the beneficiary of alongside the voice of the intercessor in verse 17 it says God heard the voice of the lad that's right brother and I want to say your voice is what will make the difference amen see the Bible says that if two of you shall touch and agree and ask anything in my name of My Father which is in he they shall receive it so ishmail was right next to his mother and when God ask her God says I've heard the voice of the lad now it goes on to say the a and the angel of God Called to Hagar out of heaven and said unto her what ath thee Hagar fear not for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is arise lift up the lad and hold him in thine hand for I will make him a great nation you see and and ishma was about 15 and 19 years old according to historians so I want to encourage you also mothers that your pain is not your promise your hurt is not your hope your failure is not your future and your fear is not your present amen God had a promise to you and God also had a promise to ishma as well verse 19 says and God opened her eyes and she saw a well of War water and she went and filled the bottle with water and gave the lad drink and God was with the lad and he grew and dwelt in the wilderness and became an arker so mothers keep praying keep seeking the Lord God will hear your lad praise the Lord praise God Matthew 6: 19 says lay not up for yourself Treasures upon the Earth where moth and rust doth corrupt and where thieves break through and steal for lay up yourselves Treasures in Heaven where the neither mouth nor rust do corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal it's important young people to know where your treasure is and how much time you're committing to it whom your heart is surrendered to that is whom your master is you're living in a time where you must put God first on every occasion where God regardless of what the circumstance is God is worthy of first place let me say it again God is worthy of first place praise God another untapped resource and we stepped into it here is prayer and not just praying but having a confession being able to speak and confess what you desire what you are seeking after to the Lord 1 Thessalonians 5:17 says pray without season and everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you Romans 10: 10 says for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation so you see confession awakens the body regardless of the condition to obey what faith believes so whatever you believe faith can conquer it Faith Can Captivate it praise God and when you have nothing else to say in prayer let your life be the prayer that is the greatest voice that can speak in your prayer is your life amen regardless of what you utter your life can either hinder your prayers or promote your prayers so let your life lead your prayer life amen praise God a prophet of God says here in the message Israel in the church in 1953 0326 he says St John 5:24 Jesus said so I am the bread of life that come from God out of Heaven your fathers eat Mana in the wilderness and are dead but he that eat my flesh and drinks my blood ha everlasting life and I'll raise him up in the last day that's what he said now there's many that pretend to be in there there's many that's Waring themselves and trying to live right and trying to press in I don't know about that but if they are in there it's just as easy to live a Christian Life as it is to live any life cuz you're in Christ and nothing else but just the full of the Holy Spirit leads you and guide you and directs you and why sure you'll make mistakes and fall but you can't stay down because you're no more a stock of corn from a sycamore tree by their fruit you shall know them so you see it's just as easy to live a Christian Life and the world today likes to paint Christians as the odd ball the world likes to paint Christians as this this this this this thing that's been tossed away and that's the part where the scripture says You must bear the reproach of Christ because you're not going to be popular to the to the community you're not going to be popular to society but when you stand for God there'll be a time where he'll stand for you amen praise the Lord amen and the reason why it's easy for you to live a Christian Life is because God has made deposits in you he's put something in you that would hold regardless of the circumstance now God sent a message yes sir and the destination of this message young people is not in the books and tapes the destination is you you are the destination of the message of this hour you see the scripture says the letter kth but the spirit gives it life and we're living in the anointing of the seventh age messenger praise the Lord now God sent this message like I said God made deposits in you he put certain characteristics in you that will not only receive this message but identify with this message and the thing about it with God when he puts a deposit in you he adds interest he adds dividends right right he he makes sure that after a while it it it it it it it don't just yield but it it it blossoms you seeall it comes with healing it comes with Deliverance it comes with peace it comes with purpose it comes with protection Hallelujah when you find yourself in a junction the word of God and the predestination of God can lead you on the Bible says to him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we can ask or think according to the power that worketh in us and we know that power in Romans 1:16 says for I am not ashamed of the Gospel for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth so the word of God is your power when the enemy comes in and he he tells you what the word says you tell them what you believe you tell them what the word has deposited in you and the other thing about deposits is that eventually you're going to have to withdraw all right and when it comes time for you to withdraw you want to make sure you take everything that belongs to you God has put gifts in you that you can start withdrawing glory and I believe brother Xander made a withdrawal today he decided to exercise what God has deposited in Him Praise the Lord hallelujah the prophet says here in the message the Queen of Sheba he says uh paragraph 16 he says now instead of advancing on and see what God promised we look back and see what some other brother behind us said let's don't look back look forward keep moving on we have untapped resources Jesus said in St Mark 11:23 whatsoever if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you have said will come to pass you can have what you said no conditions it's just un limited whatsoever things you desire When you pray you believe that you receive you shall have them whatever uh whatever Divine Healing joy peace anything praise the Lord and message Be not Afraid preach in 1961 0224 Prophet says we've got untapped resources of the Bountiful blessings of God which is not limited but unlimited whatsoever you ask the father in my my name every promise in the book belongs to you when you're saved he gives you a check with his name wrote at the bottom don't be afraid to fill it out cuz the bank of heaven will recognize it if it goes through the Pentecostal Clearing House see that's right if you've got something there on deposit yourself see if you're recognized if you got identification to show that the check belongs to you is only for Believers you if you have that identification while God will recognize your check and then uh says every Redemptive blessings belong to you and so that's why it's important that you have the right identification the world wants to place labels on you the world wants to identify you as its own but God says you belong to me and I known you before the foundation of the earth so identifi this evening Saints with the word praise the Lord I want to turn to want to turn to 2 Kings chapter 5 verse one praise the Lord and I was just thinking as I said that brother Josiah also made a withdraw some time ago and I'm looking for a lot of these young young people make withdrawals on what God has deposited in you to exercise that gift to yield that gift and as we see in the in the life of Samuel you don't have to wait to serve the Lord you can be where you are as long as you yield and surrender yourself to what God is doing in your in your midst God can use you and I want want you to keep in mind that the voice of God is sounding every Sunday the voice of God is sounding every Wednesday right the the the God told us that this is his beloved Son to hear ye him he has made him materialized and made himself manifested in this day in others amen he's made himself manifested in the in in the Prophet he's made himself manifested in his bride so when you see your brother that is the manifestation of that word when you see your sister that is the manifestation of that word amen praise the Lord now this is another young person that was willing to go beyond the camp and here we'll read about the the life of this captain uh but in this Captain uh he was he was a great man uh that was very respected among his his his his uh his team his his leaders uh but he came and had a condition in his body and it took the a a young person willing to go beyond where they were to get him to uh the the healing that he needed for his body right you see so we'll go ahead and read that here in 2 Kings chapter 5 it says now non captain of the hosts of the king of Syria was a great man with his master and honorable because by him the Lord had given Deliverance unto Syria he was also might a mighty man but was a leper and the syrians had gone out by companies and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little a little maid and I want to stop here for a moment and talk about this little Maid see this little Maid was there out of her own will she was there not because she wanted to she was there because she was captive as a slave exactly exactly and you see sometimes young people you might find yourself in a situation you don't want to be in in the household you don't want to be in in the family you don't want to be in but your attitude can make the difference your attitude can change the circumstance and I'm going to say this now God is not surprised by the family you're born in that's right God is not surprised by the household you grew up in it's all intended amen and God has interest amen amen this little Maid found herself in a unconventional situation but she had the right Spirit it goes on to say and the syrians verse two and the syrians had gone out by companies and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid and she waited on non's wife and she said unto her mistress what God my Lord or the prophet that is in Samaria for he would recover him of his leprosy she had a revelation of what God was doing in that hour right now I want to ask you young people how many people have you told about your Prophet about your Elijah and and and not just to not not not just to boast of your Prophet but to recognize a need right and to minister to that need of what God has done through his messenger in this last day GL to God see Jesus Christ did nothing unless the father showed him which means everything that Jesus Christ did for was on purpose so you when you're surrendered and yielded in your daytoday life and you go to school and you see your friends and you communicate with them recognize there's a need behind the voice and in that need there's a work that God has done in this hour that can minister to that need praise God now I just want to continue reading this story uh eventually uh we'll go to verse 10 praise the Lord it says and Elisha sent a messenger unto him saying go and wash in the Jordan seven times and thy flesh shall come again to thee and thou shall be clean but non was Roth and went away and said behold I thought he shall surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the Lord his God and strike his hand over the place and recover the leper and I like this because you see sometimes what we what we expect from God is not the way God will perform and it's important that we understand that we cannot put God In The Box we can't put God in in a oneway road God can can do unlimited things he can reveal himself in an unlimited ways now I want you to know uh uh Jesus Christ says he's able to the stones to rise children to Abraham which means god purposefully chose you he could have chose someone else he could have chose him something else but he chose you purposefully amen it goes on to say uh in verse 12 uh it says one of his men says are not ABA and farfa rivers of Damascus better than all the wells of Israel may I not wash in them and be clean so he turned away and raged and his servants uh came near and spake unto him and said my father if the prophet had bid thee to do some great thing would is now wouldest thou not have done it how much rather when he said to thee wash and be clean then he went down and dipped himself seven times in Jordan according to the saying of the man of God and his flesh came again like unto the Flesh of a little child and he was clean now I think this is important to point out that regardless of how God intends to sanctify you you must be Sanctified it is non-negotiable yes you have to be cleansed if God tells you to dip in the river seven times you have to dip seven times if God tells you you have to throw away the nail polish if God tells you you have to throw away the makeup if God tells you you have to throw away uh some of the outfits you have in your closet amen that's what you must do because sanctification is non-negotiable Glory it is a must amen praise God amen amen just looking at my time here not sure how much time I have left but praise the Lord now another untapped resource I want to point out is yourself and as you look at yourself I think it's important to understand in this carnal flesh that you are a weak human being but regardless of how unable you are to do whatever it is God has called you to do the scripture says that his strength is made perfect in your weakness you see and I think it it it it it it's important and it's necessary that you accept that weakness so that God's strength can Prevail in your situation you see when you understand that you are unable then you w then this this gospel this word it's like like a a a sick individual when they understand their condition that medication is important to them because that's what they depend on when you understand your weaknesses then you will understand how much this word ought to matter to you pise God this word is everything to you the scripture says that it is the word that gives you power it is the word that makes you overcome regardless of what you're facing yes so your Christian Life ought to be something that you surrender every day so that you can live in that power am praise God I'm reminded of a few men that had their most weakest moments and we can recall the life of the the parable of the son and it was when he lost everything it was when he was in his weakest State the scripture says he came to himself and then when he came to himself he was able to get back on the right Journey get back and step right and it was at that point that the strength that was already in him began to be restored now I want you to understand that you might find yourself in a moment of weakness but the strength already lies in you and it's going to take for you to come to yourself to recognize what you've been called for God the prophet of God says here in the message God's power to transform he says and everything under control to bring forth of its kind now remember to bring when he put the seed in the Earth the seed can only come forth with the power of life within it to transform it from a seed to a plant or whatever it was his transforming power now God put the seed in there with potentials that it would be what he said it would be and as long as it stayed in its right category it would be just exactly what God said it would be it had to be that way because he had made it to stay in that channel that anything that stays in his channel in his line of word it will bring forth exactly like his word said it will do it cannot move from it it's channeled exactly right it goes on to say uh I'm going to jump a few paragraphs a few sentences here it says uh that's what it must be because I have given every SE transforming power to make out of itself in its potentials now to make out of itself exactly what I want it to be praise the Lord and in closing I want to go to a few scriptures in Book of Proverbs Proverbs 25: 19 praise the Lord now as we turn to this scripture I want to ask a question to the young people how many of you like a broken tooth that's a weird question isn't it oh what if what if your foot was out of joint how many of you would like that Proverbs 2519 says confidence in an Unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth in a foot out of joint you see it's important that you understand you must be faithful amen because your unfaithfulness will cause discomfort to you and to others your faithfulness is necessary Hallelujah Proverbs 28:20 it says a faithful man shall abound with blessings but he that make haste to be rich shall not be innocent so when your faithfulness precedes your sacrifice blessings will flow so I encourage you young people to be faithful to the Lord in all that you do praise God let us bow Heavenly Father Lord God we want to thank you tonight oh Lord because we realize God you are our our portion you are our strength and father you Lord have once again oh God reminded us the power of your word the power of your transformation and Lord it is only by your grace father that we can live your word and Lord we yet realize God that you have placed in us all the elements you've placed in us all the right materials oh God that would come to subjection to every word for you said man should not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of your mouth so God we honor you Lord and knowing that your word is our greatest weapon your word is what leads us so
