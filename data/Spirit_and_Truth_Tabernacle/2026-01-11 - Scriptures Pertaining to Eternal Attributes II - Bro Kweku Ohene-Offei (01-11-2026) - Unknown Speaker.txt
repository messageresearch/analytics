We bless your name. We magnify you. For there is none like unto you. Father Lord, whenever we meet Lord Jesus Christ, you have a portion of eternity prepared to unfold to our hearts. Lord, we thank you for the song services, Lord, testimonies, Lord, different things you've done in our lives individually and as a body of Christ. We give all the praise and honor to you, Lord Jesus Christ. Father, even we are privileged to be here, Lord Jesus. Some have beneath the earth, Lord. Some just passed away this night, but Lord, you've given you've been so gracious and you have ordained us for this day to manifest your glory in this hour. Bless our dear pastor, brother Jack, Lord Jesus Christ, and bless the body of Christ even as we listen to your word. May the word come from the throne of heaven, not from a man, Lord Jesus. We are not here to see a man, but we are here to see you, Lord Jesus, and have conference with you, the Lord of God. Lord Jesus, you know the hearts and the needs of each and everyone. Heal the sick, Lord Father, I pray. Deliver the afflicted, Lord Jesus Christ. And lift up your children, Lord Father. And you walk in our flesh and manifest your word for this hour. Father, we thank you. We bless you. Take permanence, Lord Father, over the congregation, even those here in the room and those online and have your permanence in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Praise be to the Lord. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We can take our seat. Thank you for our musicians and all that you do. The Lord bless you all. We thank the Lord. We want to just speak uh go on with the the the topic that we had the other time scriptures pertaining to eternal attributes and those of temporal qualities. We want to speak on the second part which is a part two and we want to have a little subtitle or our concentration on press the eternal button. Amen. Press the eternal button. And as we go on we will I believe the Lord will give us more about what we mean by press the eternal button or click the button. Amen. Glory be to the Lord. Let's uh go just be on our feet and just take a a scripture just to set ourselves rolling. Let's go to the first slide. And we've already gone through that scripture already. So we just read it just for the sake of maybe those who were not here the first time to get a foundation of what we mean by scriptures pertaining to eternal attributes and those of temporal attributes. So let's go to Ephesians 4:1, Ephesians 1:4 instead. Ephesians 1:4, right? He said, "According as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love." I'll go over according as he has chosen us in him. When you see the word according mean there's a reference to something by a certain rule or regulation or certain order. The Lord chooses in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love. So this choosing wasn't done on earth. It was done before the foundation of the world. Amen. So this scripture is a scripture that pertains to eternal attributes. Amen. It's not something that you decided to do something as a human. You can take out your seat. God bless you. It is not something that you made that choice but it's something that the Lord choose or the Lord did before the foundation of the world. Amen. &gt;&gt; So your salvation has got nothing to do with your with your abilities on this earth. &gt;&gt; So your salvation you can't delete your salvation by your mistakes on this earth. &gt;&gt; Neither can your good works produce your election. It's purely the choice of the almighty. Amen. And then when we read the next uh scripture which is revelation 138, it says, "And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of l in the book of life of the lamb slain from from the foundation of the world." Again, this is not an a time attribute. He said those people their names were not written in the lamb book of life. Not because of what they did, what they didn't do. God has got his prerogative to do what he want to do. Amen. It's just like the women maybe if you have done some sewing you buy a material maybe whatever how much you buy it and then you take a scissor and cut through the material &gt;&gt; and then you put some aside &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; they can go to the trash they can become a a you can use them as a duster to clean the floor. You can use do whatever you want &gt;&gt; and then the the one that you elect you sew skirt shirt blouse whatever you want out of it. Amen. because you bought with your money. &gt;&gt; And so God created us according to his own for his own purpose. Glory hallelujah to the Lord. &gt;&gt; And then we read Genesis 1:1 in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. &gt;&gt; So when you see beginning, beginning of what? Time. &gt;&gt; Because eternity has no beginning, has no has no ending. &gt;&gt; It's not a time attribute. So beginning in this war, the Lord God begin to uh I mean uh break himself down to the earth because he wanted to become part of earthly creation and manifest himself here. Amen. &gt;&gt; I would say the greatest manifestation of God is right here on this earth. &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; Because heaven is right here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we will find out uh as we go on. Let's go to the next slide and then we going to dwell on the dimensions. But I we go by it quickly and then we come back to it God willing. So when you talk about dimension, dimensions are just realms that we live in that exist in the universe. So the first dimension actually is supposed to be the seven uh the seven dimension which is Elohim Christ the eternal attribute. But because human beings we learn by progression, God put our dimensions first. Glory hallelujah. So the first dimension is the universe that we occupy. The second is the material that occupies the universe which is the matter and the earth. And the third is the time attribute which is the temporal dimension for us to eternity unfolding here to manifest ourself right here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it's not eternal. No matter what you go through good or bad in time is not a turner. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the fourth dimension is a dimension of records. Science, communications, internet, all the technology that you see, the microphone, they operate from that dimension, which is the dimension of record. And when you come to that dimension, I call it the free access dimension. Everybody can use it. The devil uses it. God uses it. Saint uses it. Demons uses it. It people of evil character can use it. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. You can preach through the microphone the word of the lord and send people to heaven. &gt;&gt; And demons can operate through microphone to send people to hell just by the music &gt;&gt; because the music is coming from the from the fifth dimension which is hell. &gt;&gt; And you can talk think about all these great some of these great musicians I mean in America and all over the world when they sing what do they do? They unleash demons in people. the kind of dancing and if you go to the clubs, demons, cigarette, drugs, they unleash that dimension through the microphone upon the people &gt;&gt; and the people respond to it and they take it and then that become their life form. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we have the temporal h the uh the fourth dimension which is record. We do have the fifth dimension which is hell which is Satan, unbelief, realms of the souls. People have asked you sitting here. Thank God you've got a sanity of mind. Somebody's on drugs. &gt;&gt; He doesn't he or she doesn't know where he is. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Maybe he's been he's been he's on the street sitting there. &gt;&gt; He has got He doesn't even know where he is. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Because demons from that dimension are operating. They have taken over his mind, his heart, his soul and they are operating in him. &gt;&gt; He cannot exist without doing drugs. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; He has to inject and keep injecting and keep injecting. I had a I used to live in England, London and I work in a pharmacy and they have a we had a program called uh needle exchange where people they people do the drugs. So instead of using the same needle to inject themselves you can come to the pharmacy gra needles bring back the old needles and we take it and then give you new needles. &gt;&gt; Wow. So the pharmacy where I work uh boots the chemist I'll call it and so we start around the pharmacy open the pharmacy open at 8:00 but we no open at 7 but we don't open to customers till 8:00. So this lady came in and said I want noodles and I said oh you got to go go and come back at 8. He said I need my needles right now. And she got the needle right away. I didn't question because the attitude and the spirit that is coming. You just better give her her needles &gt;&gt; and take the old one because without the needles she need to inject. &gt;&gt; She cannot cope with it. &gt;&gt; When the medication is withdrawal symptom going out of the body &gt;&gt; the de that's the demon. &gt;&gt; So you have to keep you get anxious anxiety and what have you. So you have to put in more drugs to be able to survive. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; So that is what powers from the fifth dimension. That is demons that were operating in people. &gt;&gt; Amen. And those dimension is also temporal dimension. Then let's come to the dimension that we want to focus on. Glory hallelujah. That is the sixth dimension which is what the theophony which is you &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; heaven the word body the logos h which is where the the saints are saints here and saints on the other side. Yes, &gt;&gt; we are in the region of the blessed where we enjoy the blessing of the seventh dimension. &gt;&gt; And the seventh dimension is nothing but Elohim or Christ himself, &gt;&gt; fountain of all living things. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's the one who created all things. &gt;&gt; And that's where I want you to crest your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That which which dimension do you want to dwell? &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Where do you want to focus? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you want to be influenced by the fifth dimension? &gt;&gt; All right. to do drugs, to fornicate, to drink, to smoke, &gt;&gt; to lose your sanity or you want to give all of your heart &gt;&gt; to the Lord Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; that the powers of the fifth, sorry, the powers of the sixth and the seventh dimension will manifest in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our young ladies, our young sisters and young brothers, you are at the age where you have to make a decision for yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your parents cannot make that decision for you. &gt;&gt; You have to come to a point that you decide to give all of your heart to Jesus Christ. And if you don't do that, &gt;&gt; another power will take a hold of you &gt;&gt; and twist your mind, twist your heart &gt;&gt; and put deceptions of the faith dimension in you, &gt;&gt; telling you you are beautiful, you are handsome, &gt;&gt; have girls, have boys, &gt;&gt; and when you get HIV and you are dying, you're going to find a result. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can do abortions. I mean, get pregnant, the government will even pay for you. It used to be &gt;&gt; to abort your babies. But when you come to your point where you want children, you're going to find out that you destroy the blessing the Almighty gave to you. Amen. So you have to take a concrete and discrete decision. Either to give all of your heart to the Lord &gt;&gt; or the devil will take your heart and destroy you. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's no in between. No. &gt;&gt; You can't say I'm trying to I don't I don't want to give my heart to the Lord and I I don't want to give my heart to the devil. No. One of them will take over your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise be to the Lord. So the the seventh dimension is Elohim and Christ. Then we have the eighth dimension. The eighth dimension is actually what we as human beings created. &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, how can you create?" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. I'll break it down for us. &gt;&gt; Takes it. Let's say you have a wife and your children. On your children's birthday, what do you do? You buy them gift. Christmas, you buy them clothing and toys and what have you. Yeah, &gt;&gt; but then they know daddy and mommy's birthday is coming up. The money that you give it to them, they plan that, you know what, let's surprise daddy. Let's surprise mommy. You don't even have a clue. They buy some, they know stuff that you love. They might not be able to maybe buy you Mercedes-Benz at that age, but they know that they could buy some shoes, a pair of shoes and and something simple, t-shirt or whatever, watch, iPhone, something &gt;&gt; and your children buy this iPhone, wrap it, you are not aware, and then you come home on your birthday, they blindfold you and give you the give you the iPhone. &gt;&gt; You wow. So my kids think about me, &gt;&gt; they don't even have money. &gt;&gt; The pocket money that I give to them, they take some of it and give me surprise. And that is what the A dimension is all about. &gt;&gt; The salvation God give it to us. The eternal blessing that we look at you Lord, you give all of your life to us. &gt;&gt; You sacrifice on Calvary. You died for my sin. What can I give it to you? There's nothing I can do to compete. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; But I can give the little praise that is on my heart. &gt;&gt; I can give the worship to you. &gt;&gt; I can give all of my heart to you. &gt;&gt; And that is the eighth dimension. That is the praise and worship and songs of adoration that we give unto the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And the greatest praise and worship and song is to give your heart to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say, Lord, just take me over. &gt;&gt; Just do whatever you want to do with my life. &gt;&gt; And when you let the Lord take you over, the praises and the songs will come spontaneously. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you don't give your heart to the Lord, two uh we have two fires. One is called the pillar of fire &gt;&gt; and one is the lake of fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And without one you can't skip one or the other. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; You either give your heart to the to the pillar of fire &gt;&gt; to deal with you and give you the Holy Ghost baptism &gt;&gt; kill the old person &gt;&gt; or if you don't do it at a point in time when you're about to leave this earth &gt;&gt; the lake of fire will take a hold of you &gt;&gt; and you're going to be unhelated. In other words, you not exist in any dimension. &gt;&gt; You're going to be destroyed completely. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you better give your heart to the Lord. And that is the scriptures &gt;&gt; that I have it over there for you. Revelation 20110-11, Revelation 218, Matthew 25 to 41. The lake of fire which is the burning fire. What fire can consume the consume things. The natural fire can consume, but you're going to see ashes. &gt;&gt; But when the lake of fire consumes you, you never exist in any dimension. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's why God is, the Bible said that God is patient and he doesn't want nobody to get lost. &gt;&gt; So God give us time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To repent &gt;&gt; to give your heart to the Lord. &gt;&gt; But then if you make your the you make the the the world become so sweet to you. You make America the influence of this world become so sweet &gt;&gt; that you don't want to give your heart to the Lord. Then when you die, you can't go to eternity because you are not represented there. &gt;&gt; And your time is finished on earth. &gt;&gt; You can't leave here. And that is what create hell &gt;&gt; unrest. You can't have final peace in any of the dimension. &gt;&gt; And it's more than physical fire burning you. &gt;&gt; Imagine you are alive, you are not dead, &gt;&gt; and somebody set a fire and you are burning. &gt;&gt; That is worse. Billion times worse than that. &gt;&gt; Amen. That unrest that you have, hell is more than a burning fire. &gt;&gt; Cuz the burning fire will burn you after a while. You die. &gt;&gt; But this is not the case. &gt;&gt; You are there. You are still a human. You are not in this flesh, but your spirit is still there. &gt;&gt; Glory hallelujah to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's break down some things. Uh let's go to the next next slide. Of course, we read this scripture and I want to break something down. Now when the Lord we have dimension that was created we have eternal dimension the dimension that is eternal is eternity that is Christ himself &gt;&gt; but just like electricity if you want to use electricity in your home you can't connect your electricity to the is what uh 10,000 volt &gt;&gt; at electric station what is it going to do it's going to blow you to pieces &gt;&gt; you're going to be a fried chicken &gt;&gt; you don't want to do that &gt;&gt; but then they use the transformer to step it down Right. &gt;&gt; And then even to your home, they step it down to what? 110. &gt;&gt; I think UK and certain countries use 220 &gt;&gt; but here they use 110. &gt;&gt; They step it down so that you can comfortably plug in your cell phone, your stove, refrigerator, whatever you want and use it. &gt;&gt; Now eternity is so great that if the Lord comes in that dimension, the earth will be scooped. &gt;&gt; It will dissolve. It will dissipate. &gt;&gt; So God breaks himself down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; From the Elohim form. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; He broke himself down to uh the pillar of fire &gt;&gt; or to the logos. The logos is the thought &gt;&gt; and then he brought himself to the word form the theopan &gt;&gt; which is the same thing in the sixth dimension. Then he wanted to become more human be part of the earth. &gt;&gt; So now he formed himself into a human form called the Rama. I I will we go there and show you. So now the eternal person which is eternity which is the theophony step himself down to the human spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Theophony has got only one mind. It doesn't have two mind. &gt;&gt; The mind of God or the mind of Elohim is one. Christ eternity. That's why God doesn't see your mistake. &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; Because his mind for his son, brother Solomon, is eternal person. You are spotless. It doesn't matter what somebody can see about you. Oh, I know that. Oh, maybe. Oh, you were crooked here. Oh, you did this here. But the mind of Christ doesn't see nothing but perfection in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; That is our perfection. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then the human spirit has got five senses. It's got memory, affection, reasoning, imagination, and conscience. That is the outlet that it operates. &gt;&gt; And then the human spirit will step down even further to the flesh body. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. The flesh body is part of the earth. &gt;&gt; The earth is our mother. &gt;&gt; And our flesh is part of our mother. &gt;&gt; That is the new Jerusalem. Amen. So now the the flesh has also got five senses. What are the five senses? Seeing, hearing, touching, what else? Feeling &gt;&gt; and tasting. &gt;&gt; And that's the senses that we operate in. Now there are certain condition that so you have more or less if you put it together five from the human spirit, five from the flesh and then one from the theopani. So which is 11. But there are certain situation that all the 10 senses, 10 outlet cannot help you. You have to move to the to the only dimension that can help you. That is the 11th sorry not dimension the 11 sense &gt;&gt; which is what that's what you press eternal button. &gt;&gt; Glory hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we go more further into that. Let's go to yeah the uh this uh slice said scriptures of temporal and time qualities the soul the human spirit and the flesh. Psalm 82:6-7 I've said a gas and all of you are children of the most high but you shall die like men and fall like one of the princes. So you are twofold. You are eternal being &gt;&gt; brother Solomon is always 18 years old between 18 to 25 years old. &gt;&gt; Nothing changes no matter how old you get. &gt;&gt; You still have that being which is 18 years in you. Sister Sister Nomi is always 18 to about 25 years old. &gt;&gt; You can grow to be 200. That is your eternal age. &gt;&gt; But then you we put this flesh on oursel to manifest here. &gt;&gt; And this flesh and the human spirit they have the ability to die. &gt;&gt; So what is this? That is when the the tufunni is eternal. It can never die. &gt;&gt; The human spirit is bridging the the flesh. Now when your life is done on this earth, the human spirit leave the flesh &gt;&gt; and the theophony. So now the flesh is laying there. &gt;&gt; It cannot talk. It doesn't feel nothing. Because the flesh is more or less neutral. &gt;&gt; What operate the flesh is the human spirit and the &gt;&gt; theophony. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But when you die, you haven't died. You just change your dwelling place. &gt;&gt; You change your clothes. &gt;&gt; It's like after service you go and change your clothes. You are not dead. &gt;&gt; Your clothes is hanging on in the wardrobe. But you yourself, you might be eating. Go put on another clothes and go to the restaurant to eat. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So you just change your dwelling place. You change your garment. Amen. &gt;&gt; So now all that you learned from this flesh, &gt;&gt; you put it back through the human spirit. Put it back in the theophony. &gt;&gt; On the other side, you're going to remember everything that you happen here. &gt;&gt; It is still there. The record is still there. &gt;&gt; And eternal ones are still there. Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't lose your memory. You're still going to have your affections, &gt;&gt; not the flesh affection. your family, your parents, your your mother, your children, your wife, your husband, your grandchildren. You're still going to have that relationship on the other side. &gt;&gt; But not the way we operate here. &gt;&gt; You're not going to have your dad having king and chasing after you. &gt;&gt; It's not going to happen. Your mother is not going to give you whipping because you were telling lies. &gt;&gt; Because it doesn't happen in that dimension. &gt;&gt; But your mom is still your mom. &gt;&gt; You're going to be at the same age as your mother. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But you still know that she's my mother. He's my father. He's my grandmother. He's my great great grandmother. &gt;&gt; You're still going to have that relationship. &gt;&gt; Just that in the eternal dimension &gt;&gt; and that is going on right here in this dimension. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Only this eyes cannot see. &gt;&gt; Let's break it a little bit further. Let's take care. Remember the I think it's Camden Ael the blind man colored man that was healed prayed for Abraham and he got healed. &gt;&gt; Remember that story. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. This man was blind &gt;&gt; and all of us even the children understand blindness. What is it? You are blind. You cannot see. Isn't it? &gt;&gt; Maybe somebody has to hold your hands to walk you around or you have to have your king and be walking around because you cannot see. &gt;&gt; But now this man was blind. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And then a dimension open up. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And this man saw his mom. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And he was able to recognize his mother. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; How could a blind man see &gt;&gt; when he was blind? &gt;&gt; Preach. &gt;&gt; Can somebody help me? Maybe some doctor's science h technology can help me that a blind man is able to see his mother &gt;&gt; because what there's another dimension &gt;&gt; brother &gt;&gt; another eyes &gt;&gt; not this eyes &gt;&gt; but another eyes way higher &gt;&gt; with that one you can see all things. Amen. &gt;&gt; This one could be scooped out of your eyes out of the socket but you still have another eyes &gt;&gt; in your celestial body that you can communicate. Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So this man was able to see his mother and he said, "Mom," he said, "Get up and put on, get ready and go meet a man called William Bra. You pray for you and you get your eyes." &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; When this woman didn't even meet Abraham on earth, &gt;&gt; how could you know that there was a man called William Brah on earth &gt;&gt; praying for the sick? &gt;&gt; Somebody can tell me, balance this equation for me. &gt;&gt; My God, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How did she know? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That there's a human being called William. is a prophet of God on earth &gt;&gt; and that man can pray for his son &gt;&gt; who was blind and his son will receive his eyes. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to raise us to something. Amen. &gt;&gt; That you don't panic. I'm not there yet. You don't panic when you have situation. Amen. &gt;&gt; When you have whatever situation, my brother, my sister, just press the eternal dime the eternal button. &gt;&gt; Whatever you go through, just press it. &gt;&gt; So, brother, I don't have my You don't even have hands. You don't need your hands to press that dimension. You don't need your foot to to press it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just press it from your heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Press it from your thought. Amen. &gt;&gt; And just just relax. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't worry. Don't trigger stress hormones. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We trigger stress hormone because we don't we don't connect to that dimension. &gt;&gt; We don't press that dimension. But when you click that dimension, my brother, no stress. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is no biggie. There's no situation. There's no problem. &gt;&gt; Everything is a deal done. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because there's an eye, the allseeing eye &gt;&gt; way than this eyes that the devil is pointing that the problems in your family to you, &gt;&gt; you see something better in your children. You see something better in your marriage. You see something better in your business. You see something better in your brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; Because there's an eye which sees beyond this eyes. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah to the Lord. &gt;&gt; So we are human. We are gods. On the flesh we can die. But in your celestial dimension, death does not exist. &gt;&gt; Crying does not exist. &gt;&gt; Pain does not exist. &gt;&gt; Healing does not even exist because you can't get sick. How can you be healed when you don't get sick? &gt;&gt; Forgiveness doesn't exist in that dimension. &gt;&gt; Here we get forgiveness. Amen. We get repentance. You can cry. You can be sad. But the funny cannot cry &gt;&gt; because it's eternal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's got one mind looking at you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. And when you drop here on this earth because you are eternal dimension there was a portion of eternity that was in you when your your you pop from your mother's womb &gt;&gt; right here &gt;&gt; regardless of how you were born regardless of your family background regardless of your situation. &gt;&gt; There was something eternal about you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Remember the story of Abraham when he was born and a pillar of fire came to the room. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because he was a prophet. that he's going to go around the world seven times &gt;&gt; to vindicate the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; So the Lord let the pill of fire come physically for the parent to see. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Even still people struggle. They still don't believe. &gt;&gt; They still feel like certain things that happened were not real. &gt;&gt; But for you, the same thing happened to you. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; When you were born, the Almighty came down and placed himself in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A portion that you find, the celestial being that was in you before the foundation of the world was placed in you. Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Though you have your physical form, &gt;&gt; your physical senses, you had your mistakes going through life not even knowing who you were. &gt;&gt; Did you know you were a child of God? &gt;&gt; The devil was controlling your life, drinking, smoking, partying, and whatever you were doing because the old man was in you. &gt;&gt; But when the time came that the control tower, &gt;&gt; the owner of you, &gt;&gt; the one who made this flesh to dwell in, &gt;&gt; you said, "Okay, it's my time." &gt;&gt; It's just like you buy a house or you build a house. Somebody can go. Squatters can go live in there. &gt;&gt; You just let them let them live in there. But when it's time, &gt;&gt; you just take your key and then you go to the place and you drive all the squatters away. &gt;&gt; And then you what? You begin to inhabit your room. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When the true owner, the Lord Jesus Christ is ready, &gt;&gt; then he gives you what you call the new birth, the Holy Ghost baptism. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost baptism is death and remarry. &gt;&gt; Amen. You die to the old husband, &gt;&gt; which is the old soul, the old nature, &gt;&gt; and then you remarry to Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible said, "Repent &gt;&gt; and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; and it shall be forgiven of your sins." That's Acts chapter 2:38. &gt;&gt; And the gift of the Holy Ghost because it's a gift. It's not your choice. &gt;&gt; It was ordained for you before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; That's why we call it a gift. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not a gift of tongue speaking, &gt;&gt; but this is eternal gift to you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. the true you. Amen. &gt;&gt; That is your identity. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; That was pronounced on you that came into you to dwell in your flesh body. And right away we became a twofold person. You are still a human being. &gt;&gt; You could still feel pain. You can still get angry. You can get angry. But there's another person in you that can connect to the eternity. &gt;&gt; Angels of God begin to deal with you. &gt;&gt; Eternal dimension begin to operate in you. You begin to sing songs that you don't even think about. God shows you dreams and visions and it begin to something in you greater than yourself, &gt;&gt; greater than this flesh begin to control your life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And connect you to know that you are not from this world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are always in eternity. Amen. &gt;&gt; You are always a daughter of God. &gt;&gt; You are always a son of God. &gt;&gt; And you begin to manifest the glory of the Lord in your life. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's go to the next slide. The next slide is theomi. Theo means just theophony or Christ. Morphe means changing forms &gt;&gt; and God can change his forms in different way. He can change his attribute. And so God wanted to mix the tenor attribute which is a theophony and the temporal attribute the earth to manifest in this earth to come into time. So if you read 2 Corinthians 5:1-4 let's just pick the first verse. For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, that is a temporal attribute. We have a building of God, which is a tenor attribute, or a building of Elohim, and house not made with hands, a tener in the heavens. Let's just crest on this one. A house not made with hands. This is not the human being that was born through the attribute of your father and your mother. &gt;&gt; That is a house made with hands. You can decide when you marry, you can decide, okay, I don't want to have children. I mean a couple of years I want to work I want to have fun I want to travel with my husband my wife whatever and then when you are ready to give birth to children that is not the the house that is not a ch child that child can go back to the earth &gt;&gt; but now there's another child on the inside that is the the building wasn't made by men and women &gt;&gt; that building didn't come through sex but that building came by what the spoken word of the living Christ &gt;&gt; blessed be the name of the Lord and when you were created you were made God on this earth. Our original purpose is to root the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Go let's go. I don't have time to read but go reference to Adam. When Adam was was put on earth, he was an eternal theophony. &gt;&gt; But now Adam and his wife, Mrs. Adam, their names were called Adam, Mr. and Mrs. Amen. There was nothing like Eve. Eve came in when the four came in. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; So when Adam was on earth, he could speak. If Adam wanted to play instrument, he doesn't need to get a manufacturer to put together some guitar, some piano, whatever. But Adam can just speak just by thought. Guitar will come from the earth and you place and strum it and and just glorify the Lord. And then after he's done, it will bring back to the earth. &gt;&gt; Adam and his wife were not naked. &gt;&gt; They had clothes. It wasn't sewn by seamstress. It wasn't by what are small the designers by by um Calvin Klein and Versace and whatever &gt;&gt; sisters you name them where you where your ladies bags and expensive clothes are from. No, that's not the one. This one is by what? From Adam's own mouth &gt;&gt; because he was a son of God. Adam can switch into the celestial form and come back to the earthly form. Just like Mechisedc when the Lord came to visit Abraham, he was eternal being but he came in a human being. Even his feets were dirty walking on on on the street of Palestine cuz it was desert and Abraham had to wash his feet. &gt;&gt; That was I think if that was the first feet washing and Abraham gave him milk and and food. How can almighty how can a spirit eat milk? &gt;&gt; The theophony cannot eat milk. &gt;&gt; But then when the theophony put on flesh &gt;&gt; yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. wear suits, wear clothing, &gt;&gt; that the can put on can drink milk, &gt;&gt; can eat cheese, &gt;&gt; can do whatever a human being can do. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Adam had that power in him. The spoken word power. But when the fell came, that power was gone. &gt;&gt; That's when Adam begin feel like I could speak and and and do things. I could speak white clothes, rose dresses, blue dresses, whatever you want. But Eve realized, Mrs. Eve or Mrs. Adam realized that things are different. Yeah. &gt;&gt; When you speak, eternity is not backing the word. &gt;&gt; If you don't live the life of Christ, your word is nothing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God cannot operate in in in lies and in deception and in filthiness. &gt;&gt; That is not God. Amen. &gt;&gt; You have to give yourself as a consecrated vessel to the Lord to use you. Amen. That's why the prophet, one of the quote said, "Young ladies, &gt;&gt; keep your morals, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Keep yourself clean. Young men, keep your morals &gt;&gt; and let the Lord take over your life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't rush yourself. If you rush yourself, you're going to crash. &gt;&gt; But if you wait on the Lord, the Lord will give you everything that you need. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Whatever you have, just press the button. And so, brother, I've pressed the button. I've been sick for maybe a year, a month. Just relax. You're already healed. &gt;&gt; Whatever you need, husband, wife, children, money, houses, business, millions, billions, it's already in you. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Press the button and just wait on the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, brother, I've been waiting for years. &gt;&gt; God is preparing it for you. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you a story of a preacher in America. This preacher after preaching went to the restaurant with his family to go get some food to eat. They ordered their food, waiting for their food. 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 30 minutes, the food wasn't coming. And people come in, people just came in within 5 minutes, they've got their food, 2 minutes. and he was getting upset like probably did they forget about my order. So he went to uh the receptionist and said you know I ordered such and such for my family. We've been here for 45 minutes but I see people coming in here and get their food. What's going on here? So oh we haven't forgotten about you. Your order is in process. Yours is a special order. &gt;&gt; You ordered homemade food. &gt;&gt; So he opened the window said look at the chef. He's preparing your order. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. And the preacher said, "When my order came, it was exactly the way I wanted it. &gt;&gt; The chicken was fried just right. The whatever the spices, I mean, the fries, the rice, everything was just right, just spot on, the way you wanted it. &gt;&gt; And when you pray to to God for something and you think it's delaying, no, God is yours is a special order. &gt;&gt; It's not a it's not a 5 minutes fast food. It's a homemade homegrown tomatoes. And God has to water it and and and just nurture it and take care of it and the right time. He said, "My son, my daughter, this is what I prepared for you." &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't have to rush. Amen. &gt;&gt; Be patient. Amen. &gt;&gt; Before even you prayed and cried out, the Lord knows what you need. &gt;&gt; But you have a special order before the Lord. And he prepared a special order for you. &gt;&gt; Just be patient. And when the Lord brings it to you, God will give an angel. If you rush, you're going to get a devil &gt;&gt; who painted himself as an angel. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because you wanted, you just wanted an angel. &gt;&gt; I want to be Nobody. My friend, don't tell me I'm beautiful. Oh my goodness. I met this this guy. He said I'm so gorgeous. I'm beautiful. I'm the queen of West Palm Beach. Oh my goodness. My dad never told me I'm the princess. My mom never told me so. And he gives you flowers. Brother Jack said flowers from from the gas station, right? and you fall for that flowers and oh my goodness, guess what? I've got this guy. He's an angel. I've got my angel from heaven. He's so handsome. He's so cute. You just give him time. &gt;&gt; When the time comes, when he get you pregnant, &gt;&gt; he doesn't remember you no more. &gt;&gt; There was this this happened and a lady found a guy in club and this lady got pregnant. So, and the guy was in college. So they went to the college to find out who is this guy because they met in club. So they they as a the mother went to the to the principal that one of your student got my daughter pregnant. Okay. I've got many students. Which one of them? And he said he has a daughter. He said it's called copper sulfate. Copper sulfate. Copperate is a chemical in the lab. So the guy used his nickname. He didn't give give the girl the right name. &gt;&gt; Who is copper sulfate? If somebody comes Jack one of your one of your sons called copper sulfitit copper is in the the lab it's not in the church &gt;&gt; and they couldn't find who got the the girl pregnant cuz the guy gave his name as copper sulfit &gt;&gt; and there's nobody called copper sulfate. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; You see how the devil can be can be can can be shed &gt;&gt; can deceive you and destroy your life. So if you want to get married to copper sulfate go get yourself a husband from the club. You're going to get a copper sulfit. &gt;&gt; That's why God said, "Wait on me." I say, "Wait." &gt;&gt; For he knows what he's doing. Amen. &gt;&gt; You have to have trust in the Lord &gt;&gt; that if he molded you to get to this age, he has something for your life. &gt;&gt; He's teaching you patience and character. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when God before God will give you blessing, he want you have to form himself his character in you &gt;&gt; so that when the blessing come, you can handle it to the glory of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to the Lord. Let's go to the next slide. &gt;&gt; I think we did this one. H it's also talking about the some of the temporal attribute which is death. But when we receive the word we believe the word we move from life into we move from death into life. Same thing Ephesians if you go there. So let's go let's go to the next slide. Praise be to the Lord. Now this talking about Jesus. Jesus was made made better than the angels. Hebrews 1:4 which is in the celestial form as the almighty God. He was way beyond even the angels of heaven. Right? &gt;&gt; He was way beyond any person because he was the king of kings. &gt;&gt; But now this person turned himself unmorphed himself, theomorph himself from that celestial glorious attribute to a form of a servant &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; to die for you and I. &gt;&gt; He became the lowest of the lowest of the low &gt;&gt; till even his creation couldn't recognize him. &gt;&gt; He was despised. One time the Grecians wanted to see God and so they arranged with the disciple. We've heard that you you guys have Jesus Christ one a man called Jesus. He's the almighty God. And they came to see Jesus Christ. Spanish people call it Kakara face to face. How language in Africa said Ghani Ghani face to face. They saw almighty God but they couldn't recognize him. They saw a man they couldn't see the character of Christ in Jesus. They saw the Jesus the flesh but the Christ they didn't see. &gt;&gt; For you to see the Christ you have to have something in you called Christ. deep calling onto the deep. &gt;&gt; If there's no deep in you, when the word of the Lord is revealed to you, you won't see it. You're going to see brother Jack. You're going to see Erica. You're going to see Brother Solomon. You're going to see Brother Quinton Jr., but you will see Jesus Christ. But when there's something there, when brother Smiley is preaching, you're not going to see Brother Smiley, but you're going to see Jesus Christ speaking from Brother Smiley to your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When a sister is giving a testimony, you're not going to see the sister. They're going to see Christ &gt;&gt; manifest himself in the sister. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. So the Lord become lower than the angel. Move himself from the theophony form to the earthly form to manifest himself. Praise be to the Lord. Let's keep on going. Oh, I love this scripture. John 5:1 17-19. That's my script. There are certain scriptures I I we go there. He said, "But Jesus answered and said, my father worketh hitherto and I work." That is learning to be sensitive to the spirit that is in you. You don't go ahead of God. &gt;&gt; You let him lead you step by step. &gt;&gt; And what are the ways to find the will of the Lord? Prayers. The word number one. You know when God made you, he put a what do you call it? Aon the high priest. What was in Aeron's robe is it urim urim. Right &gt;&gt; now that was able to detect lie. It's like modern day lie detector. That was kind of order of that. &gt;&gt; The lie detectors is is a type of the urine theme. &gt;&gt; So if you prophesy something is truth, you you speak it before the urine theme is going to reflect the lie. If it doesn't reflect, my brother, it's a lie. The devil spoke to you. &gt;&gt; So God put the urine in you &gt;&gt; as a lie detector &gt;&gt; so that when the devil speaks a lie, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; it doesn't ring a bell here. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Right. &gt;&gt; It doesn't Theophan in me doesn't eat this. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's something in me that reject this. It's not of the Lord. &gt;&gt; I cast it to the bottomless pit. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But when it's Christ and you see the the the the glistening of the light, &gt;&gt; there's a spark. Then you know that this is the Almighty speaking. &gt;&gt; And you take that word and you can run the whole world with it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it's not you. It's the Almighty manifesting himself. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. And verse 18. Okay. And they were accusing Jesus of being himself, making himself equal with God. Verse 19 is my scripture. Then answered Jesus and said unto them, verily, verily, I say unto you, the son, which is the flesh, Jesus can do nothing of himself, but what he sees, the father, the Christ on the inside doing soever Jesus does. &gt;&gt; Whatever he see the father, the pillar of fire in him, direct him to do, that's what the sun doeth. And if you can partner ourel, if you can grasp the revelation in this scripture that in your life, if God put something in your life to do and he said this is the Lord, nothing can stop you. &gt;&gt; But if it's not of the Lord, just pack it aside. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because God is not going to back it. &gt;&gt; So Jesus even walk with what? With reference, with sensitivity to the spirit. And the Lord help us and teach us to be sensitive to the Holy Ghost that when he moves, we move, when he stops, we stop &gt;&gt; because that's where you have your victory. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you go ahead ahead of yourself and do something that's not of the Lord, God is not going to back you. &gt;&gt; If you go and slap the police and fight the police, &gt;&gt; you're going to get yourself in trouble. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God is not going to back you on that. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Cuz the Bible said respect authority. &gt;&gt; But then if you go, you don't respect the authority and you get shot, that is on you. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; But if you stand on the word, the police can shoot you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nothing will happen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because there's somebody in you. There's a bulletproof around you. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Let's keep going now. God, let me see. I think I went over. Give me one moment. I think I went over. Okay, here we go. Yes, that is Matthew the the one of the scriptures that is temporal attributes when the Pharisees came to Jesus and they were talking about I mean I'm not going to read it because we read it already they were talking about a man had a wife and he died and in those time when you die and you don't give birth to children your brother has to marry the wife and all the seven brothers married this wife and none of them and so they were asking Jesus on the other side in the resurrection whose wife is going to be because all the seven had a all the churches. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said that you you don't you don't know the scriptures. &gt;&gt; But on the other side, there's nothing like marriage. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's what he said. &gt;&gt; Marriage is what? Here. &gt;&gt; And what is marriage? When you talk about marriage in the Bible, of course, we know the natural marriage, weddings, not no talking about supernatural marriage. &gt;&gt; Marriage is between a man and a a woman and a man, a man, which we all know. Right. &gt;&gt; So marriage is what? The new birth. When you act 2:38, repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. When you get when you repent and Brajak marries you to the Lord, &gt;&gt; all right, &gt;&gt; he takes you to the pond or the river, the lake, wherever, and you confess that this day I take the Lord Jesus Christ as my lawful husband. &gt;&gt; I'll be faithful to him and I'll give all my heart to him. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Lord also already made his confession that Lord in your name the pastor will baptize you. The minister will baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And now you have a name change. Your name is changed from the earthly name to the heavenly name. &gt;&gt; What is a name? Not name. That is that's a type of a name. &gt;&gt; But a true name is what? It's a nature. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; It's an identity. &gt;&gt; So what is that nature? Is the celestial nature that comes to you? And when a man marries a wife, the man plant his life in the woman to what? To be pregnant and bring forth after the kind of the man &gt;&gt; and the woman. &gt;&gt; Amenise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When you get married to the Lord Jesus Christ, what does he do? He does the same thing. He plant his life. What is life? The Holy Spirit baptism, &gt;&gt; the new birth &gt;&gt; into your heart and you become a brand new person. Amen. All the old stuff is gone away. &gt;&gt; Let's keep going. Just give me a moment. Let's uh the code is 64313. He said when the eyes were open they knew in him paragraph 16. And I said and I and as I said late night last night God loted that scripture his scripture from the beginning before there was any time when he was eternal I'll skip some of them I'll go and the whole thing is God unfolding himself in his attributes and then God being made material tangible that we can talk to speak and his whole church the body and everything therefore your name was in in his thinking that that's how you have eternal life you can't come no other way. If you got eternal life, you always was. &gt;&gt; And I want you to absorb the scripture that if you got eternal life, you always got because it's eternal. It didn't have a beginning on earth. It begins in you, but you always was. If you go to the bottom, he said anything that had was anything that was eternal never did begin and cannot end. So you were only in his thinking. Your name, who you are and what you are, that is the only way you could ever have eternal life cuz you always was. &gt;&gt; Amen. That is your predestination eternal blessing that you cannot go away from your your salvation. You can lose the joy of your salvation. &gt;&gt; You can do something that God will give you enough time. You had enough time to do what you did right. He'll give you enough time to pay for it. But your salvation, your redemption is always intact. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to the next one. That is the logos step down processes of Elohim. God broken himself down from the logos from which is the thought the seventh dimension God hardness in his thinking then it's means he change himself move itself step down into the theopanic which is the sixth dimension which is the word body &gt;&gt; and then that wasn't sufficient God become object of worship we were worshiping him angels were worshiping him but he wanted to become more tangible in this earth &gt;&gt; so now he broke himself he move himself back down further into the rama just like electricity from uh 10,000 volt &gt;&gt; into a,000 volt and then to 110 &gt;&gt; to the usable form because in those forms the earth cannot contain it. &gt;&gt; So he step himself down even further &gt;&gt; to the remma which is the expression in earth &gt;&gt; which is the first second and third dimension where we dwell in the physical form &gt;&gt; blessed be the name of the lord &gt;&gt; god. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to the next one and I think this one we read it over and over. He said talking about he said you are you are in Tennessee. God is going to give us more blessing in 2026. &gt;&gt; I believe &gt;&gt; and as we going to go more blessing we're going to eat more than we have been eating already. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why Jack started a new series. Amen. He's going to give more word. And the more we eat, the more we drink, the more we grow fat. We get we put on flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. If you don't eat, if you don't drink, we're not going to be able to produce what we supposed to produce. &gt;&gt; So now you talk about use Tennessee said they grow apples and what do they do? I'll skip to the uh the blue line. He said it drinks and drinks and then just drink till just it can't drink no more and it pushes out a limbs. You drink and drink and drink and then you bring out justification. Then it drinks some more and push it out leaves. Then you bring out sanctification. It drinks some more and push it out blossoms. Then it drinks some more and he push it out peaches. Then he drinks some more and push it out more peaches. He keep drinking and keep pushing out and you can read the rest. He said and now that's the way that Christian life is. What when a man or a woman or a child is born of the of the spirit of God then everything that you have need of in this world and the world to come is given to you. &gt;&gt; Can we absorb it? &gt;&gt; Amen. When you are born by the word of the Lord, whatever you need on this earth and the other dimension is given in you. &gt;&gt; Glory, you will receive the Holy Spirit and you are planted in Christ. And to my estimation of Christ, he's the inexhaustible fountain of life and you are just planted in him and drink and drink and push it out some more and drink and push it out some more. Amen. So you drink the word of the Lord and you push it out limbs. &gt;&gt; You drink more and you push it out. Let me use Peter for example. When the Lord called Peter, he wasn't perfect the first day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't even understand who he was. &gt;&gt; What he knew was cutting ears. If you mess with him, he'll fight you. And that's what to defend himself. And so somebody got got mess with his master. What did he do? Pull his dagger, cut off his ears. &gt;&gt; That was Peter. &gt;&gt; But the Lord was showing that no, Peter, this is not a battle we are in. &gt;&gt; It's not a physical battle. We don't cut ears. We don't sleep people. So the Lord took the years and put it back to him and Peter learned I never knew that. So he learned forgiveness &gt;&gt; that when somebody does something against you, there's something in you to forgive &gt;&gt; because you are eternal being. So Peter begin to learn. And as he was walking with Jesus, he be now he drink he drank that uh he keep on drinking and push out for forgiveness. And then one time he saw Jesus Christ walking on water and he they were scared to death. How can a man walk on water? Right. &gt;&gt; And the Lord said, "It is I be not afraid and said, Lord, beat me to come." Said, "Come on in." &gt;&gt; Son, come on in. &gt;&gt; And Peter begin to walk. &gt;&gt; Walk step by step. He was excited. All the people, Andrew and the brothers, wow, brother Peter, you're doing awesome. And then he got to the middle of the river and said, "hm, this is dangerous. What about if I sink?" And then when doubt came in, he began to sink. &gt;&gt; And then he the Lord helped me. And the Lord helped him. &gt;&gt; He was training him. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then he was able to what? go to the other side. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Same thing in our life. We might not be perfect the first day God called you. He's still working on you, but keep drinking. &gt;&gt; When you drink, &gt;&gt; it's going to the first miracle is you had a headache. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you prayed a simple prayer and the headache was gone. Wow. I've never experienced anything anything like that in my life. &gt;&gt; I've always have headache. I have to take a Tylenol, but this time I prayed and it worked. Wow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that sunk in your heart. And now your brother is sick. Oh, I can pray for you, bro. Your sister, sister, I can pray for you. &gt;&gt; And you pray and the sister is healed. &gt;&gt; Wow. Who am I? I can pray for people to be healed. &gt;&gt; You keep drinking. &gt;&gt; And now you pray for cancer. The cancer is healed. &gt;&gt; Wow. This is way out of control. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Somebody misplaced something money. Don't worry. You prayed and the p came back to where it was. &gt;&gt; No. Lord, this is like too overwhelming. &gt;&gt; Keep drinking. And the more you drink, &gt;&gt; the more the attribute come out of you. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And the next slide is talking about the same thing. Keep drinking. Oh, let me see. It looks like I jump. Okay, I think I need to read this one. I have How many more do I have? About 10 minutes. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Okay, praise God. Earthly body dissolved. The spiritual body goes celestial. Now this is uh questions and answers paragraph 19640830e number four uh 57 said notice a mother she can be ever so mean and cruel but just before the baby is born there's certain kindness that is certain did you ever notice a mother when she's to be a mother there's something sweet about her she always takes on that sweetness because that the little angel little spirit a little messenger to this little tabernacle is ready to come forth into the world. And then uh when this little angel comes into the body, the there's the that's the little angel of the earth, a spirit that is ordained of God to take to take up this body. That baby has to have a choice. It makes a decision. It makes its decision. Then when this takes place, then you see the angel of the Lord now comes in. Sorry. Now comes in here. Yes. Okay. Let me read again. Then when this takes place then you see the angel of the lord now comes in here which is a spiritual body that is eternal. Amen. Remember I read a code that your eternal life.

Brother Solomon Johnson has got one mind. That one man is sister knowing me. God has got one mind is on brother Jack Dav and sister Eric Kadav. The mind is you. Amen. Let me use what Abraham Abraham in his meeting the early stage he was very poor man you know and he goes to I think some of the hotels they didn't even have a bathroom in the in the room you have to go and take shower outside like the old school way so one time he was in in in a one of the hotels with his brother younger brother and Billy Paul the same bed he was just a simple I mean man and then the angel of the lord came to speak with him before the before the meetings the angel of the lord will come and tell him that you're going to see a minister called Jagdav he's wearing this suit he's got this he's going to see a sister called sister Shandi is wearing this blah blah blah blah so he knows everything about you &gt;&gt; exactly right &gt;&gt; he shows everything your color of your dress and everything your your disease something that you don't even know you've got this back pain for years you don't know how it began you fell on a wall when you were a little child a little girl around 15 years old because you were younger nothing happened but as you grow to about 45 now that this pain no morphine no Tylenol no surgery is able fix it and you don't even know and he see you sees you as a younger h 15y old lady and oh I can see you become you becoming younger in in my presence you look like a 15 year old you were playing with your brothers and sisters you fell from a wall and you just went on nothing happened you were younger now you are 45 and now the pain the disc is disconnected &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ go receive your healing &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; so one time the angel of the lord came and said he as the angel can my brother and my son see That's right. &gt;&gt; And say, "Your son can see me." He works for you. &gt;&gt; How blessed. Even if you don't have the Holy Ghost, work for your ministry. &gt;&gt; Do the assignment your pastor assigns you to do. &gt;&gt; If he tells you to play drum, wash the wash the clean, do it. &gt;&gt; It is reged in heaven like greed. &gt;&gt; The the pastor assigned this young man, this this young lady to to whatever he assigned to be a Sunday school teacher. There's a blessing eternity. Take note of that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so say your son can can see me. So put a pillow in the face of Billy Paul because he's going to he it will scare him to death. He'll pass out. And he told he said, "Billy, you remember the angel that talked to you about it? He's here. Do you like to see him?" Say, "Yes, I'm going to take off the pillow and kind of slowly get him to kind of kind of get acclimatized." And so I believe Paul said he took the pillow off and the angel was standing at the at the corner of the building and he said his eyes was on brother Abraham. His side wasn't going anywhere. He said his eyes is when Abraham is going his eyes is on him. His eyes is on Abraham. That is how the Lord has set an angel of the Lord on you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wherever you are on earth on the flight in journey when you are broke when you are rich there's an angel of the Lord &gt;&gt; around you. If you can be sensitive to that angel, my brother, you'll be the happiest, my brother, you be the happiest man. &gt;&gt; You be the happiest woman that is eyes on you. &gt;&gt; Wherever you go, he's watching you in whatever situation. &gt;&gt; He's guiding and protecting you. When you move, he move a step. He goes ahead of you. He's behind you. &gt;&gt; Whatever he has to do, he will take care of you. &gt;&gt; When you can't take yourself, he takes care of you. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen. Let's go to the next one. &gt;&gt; We read I think I read that one already. In inexustible fountain. Let me see. Yeah. Let's go to the next one. I think I go too fast. Let's see. Great. Great. I want to I want to finish on time. Yeah. Revelation chapter 10. Now, we're going to drink a scripture that is for you and I our day. If you read Revelation 10, I want you to study Revelation chapter 10. You can break it in three parts. The first part is the mighty angel, who was he? The almighty Jesus Christ. He put one foot on land and one foot on the sea. Do you think it's a natural land? West Palm Beach, Miami Ocean and then one foot on West Palm Beach. No, that's not the kind of sea. What is What is sea? &gt;&gt; Multitude of people, &gt;&gt; land people. He planted himself in his elected seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was Jesus Christ. And if you read, you read up to six is Jesus Christ in different forms. Then seven, the scene changed. He finished his ministry. He gave the baton to what? He's the head. &gt;&gt; He gave the baton to what? To the hand. &gt;&gt; The hand is what? The prophet of the Lord. &gt;&gt; In the Old Testament, when the Lord sent a prophet, he said the hand of the Lord, the judgment hand of the Lord is on earth. &gt;&gt; He sent a prophet to uh West Palm Beach called Jagdav. &gt;&gt; And his word is judging the people. &gt;&gt; I don't want to branch. I can branch somewhere else. Do you know that you are an investigation angel? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you know talk about investigation angels on earth? &gt;&gt; That's right. We do have supernatural angels &gt;&gt; that watches over the nations. &gt;&gt; By you, by the spirit of the Lord in you, you are an angel. You are investigating the earth. &gt;&gt; You're not going to judge the people in the time of Solomon. No. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're not going to judge the people in the time of Abraham, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But the people in your time, &gt;&gt; there's something in you that take records &gt;&gt; of things around you, &gt;&gt; politics, religion, &gt;&gt; and transmit you to what? To the celestial dimension. Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; So in that day when the judgment begins, the wife through judgment, brother Solomon Johnson is going to stand as a witness in his community. &gt;&gt; Did you see this man and his family? Did you see this young lady and her family? &gt;&gt; How they conducted himself? Do you see this pastor? He could have been a world televangelist and get all the money on the planet if pastor Jagdav wanted to do it. But do you see that he was working hand in hand with me, &gt;&gt; lock with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. Why were you using the people for the money? &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Why were you deceiving the people? &gt;&gt; Why were you telling doing fake miracles? &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Why were you raising that were not &gt;&gt; Plant people that were not and made them pretending to be And then he said, "Oh, you shake them and say they are healed." &gt;&gt; And you bring Dallas and buy private jet. &gt;&gt; Now he is going to be a judge. &gt;&gt; He's an investig investigation angel in West Palm Beach. My sister, wherever you are, my brother, you are an angel of the Lord that your life, things that go around you, it's what? It comes to you and you keep it and transmit it to heaven. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; We need a scripture for our day. Let's read the scripture. Revelation 10. Now, if you come to the verse 7, that was William Brah's ministry. Now, verse 8 to 11. This is a scripture that we don't use that much, but that's you and I our scripture for this very day. and you want to use it and man let the Lord manifest himself. Now let's read it. That's the ministry of the wife of Christ. God never will never do a man will never do nothing and leave his wife out. &gt;&gt; The wife is the first person. So William Brown was working for what? To bring a bride to be married to Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; So verse 8, and the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me, and said, go and take a little book which is open in the hand of the angel which stand upon the sea and the water. And I went unto the angel and said, give me the little book and said unto me, take take and eat it up, and it shall make that belly bitter. It shall make be as sweet as honey in their mouth. And I took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up. And it was in my mouth sweet as honey. And as soon as I had eaten up, it became bitter in my belly. And he said unto me, "Thou must prophesy." This is where I want us to note. Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, nations, tongues, and kings. &gt;&gt; So, brother, I'm not a preacher. I'm just a sister. Your life prophesies. &gt;&gt; Your character prophesies. &gt;&gt; Your love prophesies. Your deeds prophesy. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Another scripture, Isaiah 2:3, we won't have time to break break it through, but he said, "And many people and many people shall come and say, come ye, let us go to the mountain of the Lord and to the house of God of Jacob." You can put the house of God of William Abraham. That's the prophet God sent to you. And he will teach you of his way. Take William Abraham's message and we we walk in his path. For out of Zion shall go forth the law and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. Do you know Zion? Zion is the wife of Jesus Christ. All right. &gt;&gt; Jerusalem is Israel. &gt;&gt; 42. And in that day shall, if you read 41, it's talking about seven women who said we wear our own clothes. They don't want to wear Jesus clothes. They eat their food, but only be called by your name. &gt;&gt; They want to be called Methodist, Christians, Baptist, spoken word, anti whatever. But they do not want to eat the word coming from the Lord. &gt;&gt; They do not want to wear the wedding garment provided by the the the groom. They just want to be called Christians. And there are millions of people on earth. Oh, I'm a Christian. I'm a Baptist. I I belong to Spirit and True Tabernacle. I belong to whatever you can belong to. But that doesn't what make you the wife of the lamp. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The the wife of the lamb receive the clothing and the food from the husband. &gt;&gt; Amen. But then this your verse Isaiah 4:2 41 is what I talk about the seven uh the seven women. But then he said verse two he said in that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious. Who is the branch of the Lord? The wife of Jesus Christ. And the fruit of the earth shall be shall be excellent and comely for them that are escape of Israel. God call you from the nations and you are escape from the judgment of Israel. &gt;&gt; You are not going to be part of the judgment of America and the world. Let's go on now. We're going to eat uh something else that the Lord provided for our day. uh uh our hope is in God. Verse 23 said there there never was an age there never was an age any two major prophet on earth at one time. There were one minor prophet but there were one major prophet. There were many minor prophet but there were one major prophet and Elijah was a prophet unto Elisha came. Then Elijah was taken off a double portion musicians I think it's do I have like five 10 minutes? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you. God bless you. And then Elijah was a a prophet onto Elisha. Then when Elijah was taken off, a portion, a double portion came to him. So this was even before the Ram said that God never sent two prophet at the time. Sorry, two major prophet and verse uh let me read the next one 65 trying to do God a service without it being the will of the Lord. 65 1127b said not a man god but it will come through a prophet. He said now he never had two major prophet at the same time. Never in the world. See, no matter how much two heads cannot be, it has to be one head. God has to get one man under his control. Amen. He was talking about Moses and Elijah. God is not going to send two physical prophet because God can never it will be contrary to the word of the Lord. But as we read on, you're going to find out how God is going to send it. Now, you can't have two pastors. You can't say when you are going to preach, he said, I'm going to preach for who? Brother Jack. Because he's the pastor. But when Jack is going to preach, he's not going to say, "I'm going to preach for Jack." I don't think Raj has ever done it. 20 something like, "Oh, brother Jack, why are you going? I'm going to church. Who are you going to preach? I'm going to preach for Jack." &gt;&gt; Which brother Jack? He's the one called here to be the prophet of of of the church. &gt;&gt; So, he doesn't he preached for the Lord to the people of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Even if Jesus in his flesh comes here, he's going to recognize brother Jack. &gt;&gt; Remember Jesus went to h went to the temple. He sat there until they given the scroll &gt;&gt; and he read a portion that pertain to him and he gave it back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So God doesn't have to be heard because every man is made in his different order. &gt;&gt; Our thinking, our personalities, our way of doing things. &gt;&gt; If I give you 10 mill $10 million don't work for 5 years. Take your first vacation. &gt;&gt; Let me know what will be your bucket list. Maybe you want to go go to Dubai. I would like to go to the Pyramis in Egypt. &gt;&gt; I would like to go to South America. I would like to go to in Europe. certain places but your vacation list will be different. You want to go to Hawaii &gt;&gt; because we are our humanness. We are different. &gt;&gt; We have the same theopani the same Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; the same Christ in us but our human way of doing things is never the same. &gt;&gt; Even in family can you can let me you can tell me maybe in lunch or dinner the mother want to eat this the father want to eat this the children want to eat this because they are they have different hunger different thirst &gt;&gt; and taste for different things. So let's go to the next verse. Now this is what the Lord taught us here. Oh, wonderful. Most enlarger ministry repeats 640802 future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride. 474. Remember God took Elijah the scriptures if you want to note it down. God took Elijah after the rapture and translated and I want you to underline the word translated and transported. Say translated and transplanted. Sorry, not transported. translated and transplanted him back among the people to take the place as a prophet among his people. Pretty soon he will do that. Oh my brother, this is glorious, &gt;&gt; my sister. And he has kept him alive this 2500 years. 2,500 years they alive. He is to appear again. 475. Notice again, he raised up Moses from the dead. Where is his grave? Can anybody find it? Read the Bible. Read the book of Jude. See Satan the archangel disputing with the archangel. Satan said the Lord rebuke you. He's speaking over the body of Moses. And here Peter, James, and John was standing there looking at him on Mount Transfigration. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Right. &gt;&gt; So now that's how the Lord brought and Elijah about 2500 years ago to man transfiguration in the aophony body right there in the land where the mountain is to be raised up again. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He said, and then 478, and there was Moses, the dead has been raised. There was Elijah the rapture was still alive and there was both represented on this holy mountain and Jesus the redeemer when God up above him like this overshadow him and said this my beloved body. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And see go further to explain that when you die here when when you leave this this dimension brother Jack will still be a pastor. &gt;&gt; He'll still be breaking words into people. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because when when we go to the other side all the glorious revelation that we have here is going to be a type. Wow. &gt;&gt; What is a type? A type is something God used before. It was the real word of God. But God has progressed further &gt;&gt; and that become a platform that you step upon. &gt;&gt; Just like the Old Testament when Moses were killing lambs and Aaron. That was the word of the Lord for the hour. &gt;&gt; Like if you commit sin, every year you bring your lamb for your family, they kill the lambs and boos and things like that. That was yay and aiming for that hour. But for us, it's a platform. &gt;&gt; It's a type. It's it's already gone and manifested. &gt;&gt; I don't care lambs. You don't kill lambs. The lamb is already killed on Calvary. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We just claimed the lamb that was killed for us. So become a type. So all the glorious thing that we have here is going to be a type on the other side. &gt;&gt; Glory. Let's finish and wrap it up. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Let's see. Break it further. Look at Sam. He said 4:82. Death doesn't change you. Death only changes your dwelling place. Remember Samuel when he was dead and been buried for two years. He was in paradise. Those six dimension has not been open like now. And with the witch of Endo called him up and Saul recognized him. Wow. The man was dead. But Saul was able to recognize him. Wonderful. And she did too. That's a witch. And fell upon her face. He hadn't changed one bit. He was still the same Samuel after being dead two years. And he was still a prophet. This should give you hope that when we have loved ones, one will go before the other. Yes, we are human being. Even Jesus cried when his friend Lazarus died. I think John 10:30. And Jesus wept. That was the scripture. Jesus wept. But after weeping, know that your mother, your grandmother, your father, your children is not dead. &gt;&gt; He's right there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; His clothing is what lay laying in state. &gt;&gt; But he or she herself is another dimension watching you cry. Oh my my son, my daughter, my grandbaby doesn't know. She she she doesn't remember &gt;&gt; that I can't die. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Exactly. And he said and he was still a prophet and tomorrow that was somewhere now someone still prophesied. Remember I said I went by Jack lives here. Is it going to be a pastor? Is he going to be singing songs &gt;&gt; whatever attribute is going to do it on the higher order. &gt;&gt; So Samuel was in the prophesying to the witch of Endo and Saul. And he said let's go on. He said he was still the same Samuel after being dead two years and he was still a prophet. He said tomorrow you fall in battle your son with you and by this time tomorrow night you'll be with me. In other words, you're not going to perish. You did something wrong. You pay for it on this earth. Your life is cut short, but you're going to be in eternal dimension. A Christian, God can never lose one of us. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that is just what happens. See, when Moses and then he said when Moses and Elijah returns back, Elijah, Elijah for Revelation 10, they will be I think I didn't I cut the code short. Let me see. Oh, they will be prophet. Hallelujah. So God will not send then God has to bring their parents to be born again and then their parents Aaron and and not Aaron Job is it Job Moses' mother and his father is Amram and his great-grandfather Abraham to be born into no God will translate them from the dimension and they'll manifest here how he's going to do it's not my job it's not your job man is to believe it's not even our scripture &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; and we can go further but talk about when in his ministry said Mos and Elijah were here. A woman, Baptist woman prophesied. I said the spirit of Elijah will be here. Brother, what's the name? Jack Jack Mos church and they manifested right there. God is so manifesting. Let's go to the next slide. I want to share a little testimony. I'm done. And uh I didn't even have time to go over but like I want to share this testimony with you. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are an eternal dimension. &gt;&gt; There was a time in this was uh this was this took place in let me see if I can remember the date. I think I have the date somewhere. It was one moment. I know it was 2023. I think April the somewhere in April. Let me see. Praise be to the Lord. Anyway, the date doesn't matter, but it was in 2023. I think it was in April. April 2023, if I quite remember. When I get off work, I put my key and my wallet. This a drawer. The first is three compartment, three cabinet. I put my key and uh my key and a wallet in the first drawer. And one of the days I was looking for my wallet. The wallet wasn't there. And I always when from work I just put it right there and that's where I keep it in the morning when I'm going to work I pick it up. It wasn't there. So I was like it looks like maybe I left it at work. I went back to the work set through my drawers it wasn't there. I said okay maybe it might be home. I came back home did I went home did thorough search everywhere I couldn't find it. And so I was like my ID is in the wallet my bank cards in the wallet. Musicians you can make your way here and all the stuff is in the wallet. So what do I do? I have to maybe call the bank, right, to cancel my card, call the police to report my ID and what else? And all the document that I have, it's in the wallet. So I said, "No, Elisha is my father supernaturally. I'm the son of Elisha. Lord, this is where I put the first drawer is where I put my wallet. However, I don't know what happened, whether I misplace it, whether somebody stole it. I want to be returned exactly where I keep it." Amen. &gt;&gt; So I prayed and left it to the Lord and I was going to work back and forth. Hey, my gas was running out. I didn't have money to buy gas and couple of days keep searching. It still wasn't there. I pulled the drawer back and forth. Of course, it wasn't there. It was just transparent drawer. And one of the night my was getting lower and lower. My thank god my work was quite kind of close to where I live. And I said, I'm still not going to call the police. I'm not going to report. I'm not going to call the bank. I want to be placed where I keep it. &gt;&gt; So one night I was sleeping. I got up like probably around midnight 2 or 2:00 a.m. I couldn't sleep anymore. I was thinking about it and I knelt out to pray and the inner man said go back to the drawer. My brother, my sister, I went back to the drawer. This same drawer that I've been it's not anything mysterious. I pull it and the wallet was right there. Say glory hallelujah. We have a being that works for you. You are not alone. You are not by yourself. That's right. &gt;&gt; There's a being in you. And if we can let him, we drink more and we can let this be manifest himself. You are prince uh God on this earth. &gt;&gt; I will give another short testimony. I'm done. This seals book is my first book that I my brother who was a minister gave it to me when I came to the message and I love it. I've used it is the the pages are turn off. I've got it highlighted. I've got it uh written. I have different things. I remember one time brother Jose remember I went to a hosted about a year and a half ago. Brother Jose Abi Linda I think you were there right? And brother somebody called me. I keep receiving this call but you know we do get scam calls. So I I wasn't paying attention. I came back home and I saw the brother wrote his brother do you remember me? You preach years ago in a basement church and he said that the there are there is blue grasses in heaven and I'm looking for that quote. Is it in church book? I said, "Oh no, it's in seals book." So I just open it. It's right here. Blue grasses in heaven in my book. I don't know the pages but it's in a revelation of the seven seals. That is the let me see paragraph 358. That's my paragraph. I don't know if it's the same. He said, "Sir, I turn and it looked like a great That was Abraham." He said, "So I turn and it looked like a great big great big field, something like a green spreading field of blue grass." When the Lord show him one vision, he could see he was sleeping in his bedroom with his wife and he said, "I could see my body laying down with my wife." Mid was fast asleep and I could see me being a young person and walking on blue grasses. Has anyone ever seen blue grasses on this earth before? like call it blue, blue as in blue. I did a search and I had a there's no like blue grasses but in Kentucky they have they call it Kentucky blue grass in let me see when it was a spring it's kind of have a tint you know kind of tint bluish &gt;&gt; but blue as in blue they don't have wow that's wonderful that's where was born that's the only place that we could get something close to bluish grass &gt;&gt; and but then on the other side he was walking on blue grasses so one day I remember in Texas that was I think 20 23 as well. I was not in the night the daytime I think I don't know what I ate maybe some fufu or something like that and I knocked myself to sleep. I was sleeping on it. I didn't sleep on my bed. I had a blue mattress just just taking a rest taking a nap after taking some heavy meal. So I was gone and slept and as I was sleeping something hit my I'm left-handed dominant. I use my left hand. I can barely write my name with my right hand. I use the left hand for everything you know. and something hit my hand and I opened my my eyes and this s book was firmly in my hand and I was looking around there was nobody around. I said, "Lord, do you want me to read a book?" I started reading and praying. We have a dimension &gt;&gt; that's in us. &gt;&gt; When you can't take care of yourself, it will take care of you. &gt;&gt; One day I was uh I think after lunch right here in West Palm, I ate at dinner. I was sitting I have a glass table, dining table and I was I think I fell asleep without even knowing and I had my patio or balcony opener and I was gone. I was sleeping on the table and probably people were driving by and somebody tapped me. I think I was facing this way on this right shoulder and I got up and I said, "Oh, wow. It's already night and I have my party open. When I couldn't take take care of myself, I sleep." &gt;&gt; The five senses of the body couldn't take care of himself. The five senses of human spirit. The theophony tapped me to get up and go sleep in the bedroom. My brother, what is your need? My sister, what is your need? &gt;&gt; Just walk step in step with the Lord. &gt;&gt; You are eternal dimension. &gt;&gt; You were made for eternal purpose on this earth. Yes, &gt;&gt; you have a specific put your name there. I know you know your name. Put your name right there. My little brother, my little sisters &gt;&gt; that you have a God put you here on a specific assignment and he's trying to achieve that assignment. And what you have to do is give all of your heart to him. &gt;&gt; He's not asking your money, your your He's not asking nothing difficult. Give when you give your heart to him, he ask everything of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you'll be manifesting things that are beyond. There's no time to to talk about testimony. We even can barely pre the word for the sake of time. But my brother, my sister, brother, I'm there. Let's be on our feet. Let me go to the last slide, please. And uh I'm I'm I'm done.

Blessed be the name of the Lord. Uh we certainly appreciate God's word uh on today and uh just appreciate brother Quu and how the Lord uses him just to kind of break some of these things down to us. And one thing that I'm I'm taking away as just the testimonies he was sharing there just how God wants us to experience that supernatural uh in our own lives. Uh we are not limited uh by what's in this natural realm. We have we have so much more at our uh disposal if we would just tap into it. Like you say, just just take the word and keep drinking. Keep drinking. Eventually, these things just push right out of you. And uh you know, one thing I'm taking away is I am not going to trigger stress hormones. &gt;&gt; I'm not triggering stress hormones. That mean I'm not going to be worried and up at night and worried about No. God going to make a way if God could bring his wallet back, right? I mean, what else can God do for you if you would just only believe? And and the thing about God is that he don't he don't move in microwave time. But if you just hold on to what you what you're holding on to, God going to make a way somehow. So, I'm telling you, I ain't going to trigger no stress hormones. I'm I'm I'm I'm going to I'm going to live in God's uh freedom, you know, that he has for me. So we appreciate the word of the Lord on today. Amen. We thank God for brother quake group. Praise God. As I was there in Ghana, you know, um um for Christmas, I found out uh so they you get you get a name for the day that you're born. So, Brother Quu being born on Wednesday, that's how he got the Quu name. And uh I come to find out I was also born on a Wednesday. So guess what? I'm brother Quu. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; God is good. Amen. Let us have a word of prayer. Amen. Father, we thank you for your word that has gone forth uh on this day. I thank you for your servant, Lord, just getting himself out of the way to bring these thoughts from heaven uh to us, to help us, Lord, to think at a higher level. Uh to respond at a higher level, God, to walk at a higher level. Uh we we thank you for uh Lord, just um just helping us to see, Lord, just what it is that you want us to be. We don't have to be limited, Father, by these five senses, Lord. We can go to that six sense of faith and operate there all the time. the prophet has laid these things out. And Lord, just as brother Quaker was just kind of sharing um just different things that happened in Brother Brandon's ministry, how the angel Lord would say, "Hey, you're going to go to such and such a meeting. This person's going to be there and dressed like this and they're going to be sitting over here and they're going to be doing this." Lord, it just show how you you know everything about us before we even know about it. Uh we don't even know, Lord. Sometime we're wondering what we're going to put on and going through the closet and I'm not sure. Try to wear this and I can't put that on and I got to wear something else. But you already know before the foundation world, Lord, every detail about us, Lord, if if you have those things under control, help us, Father, to realize that we don't have anything to worry about. We don't have to trigger stress hormones because, Lord, you're you're you're in perfect control of every situation. Let us keep walking by faith and not by sight, knowing, oh God, that you will turn everything into our favor. I pray your blessings upon your people as they leave this place, but not your presence. May you bring us back at the appointed time on Wednesday night. Uh it's our prayer. It's in Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand of praise. Amen. And again, we want to thank God for Brother Wy and sister Aliana. God bless you all. Amen. Please come see us again. Amen. Brothers will come at this time to dismiss you. You can be seated. Amen. The brothers will come to dismiss you. God bless you.
