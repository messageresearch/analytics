pinnacle palms be happening this evening at 5:30 so keep that in mind and keep us in prayer regarding that this Tuesday is corporate prayer amen that's the brothers and sisters be able to pray together and just just so everybody is aware that God kind of gives us different ways that we pray at different times like Sunday morning is kind of you know we're come in with quiet things that made - nothing wrong with that just kind of waking up in the steel in the morning and you know just kind of entering into his presence but on corporate prayer will be will have a few brothers that will actually pray aloud and sisters Amen that will be here joining us I want to just encourage you you can if you want to find a corner that you want to stand in and pray you can do that if you want to kneel you can do that whatever you want to do we just want you to just open up and just let God have his way amen but it's just opportunity for us just express ourselves to prayer to the Lord and this is only gonna happen maybe two or three times a year the corporate prayer experience so uh but it'll be every fifth Tuesday that we'll have a man and we just so happen to have five Tuesdays in the month of January so we'll be doing that on Tuesday night amen at 7:30 so we welcome everybody all the brothers and sisters don't forget amen service on Friday coming and next on the community and

man in this this this this message this morning amen and now y'all just keep me in your prayers amen we're going to go to first John the second chapter a man and we're gonna start reading from the 15th verse and after that we'll be going to Matthew the 16th chapter and we'll be reading there from the 24th verse I was starting that first John 2nd chapter 16 man familiar Scripture we've been going over that but it says love not the world neither the things that are in the world If any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the Father but is of the world and the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever amen go to Matthew 16 with Matthew 16 we'll begin reading from the 24th verse then Jesus said unto his disciples If any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it for what is a man to profit if he gain the whole world and lose his soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul dear Heavenly Father Lord we come before you this morning Lord God we ask you God so just anoint Lord God had me become the heart that Oland you may be seen no father God speak to the hearts of the people Oh father God the big may go free Lord God we expose the devil in this our Lord God we ask you Lord to have your way in Jesus precious name Amen we want to take a little thought this morning taking it from first John a man and we see here what Paul was talking about three particular spirits share the the luster the lust of the eyes of the lust of the flesh and the pride of life we would like to to focus our attention this morning on one particular we want to deal with the pride of life we want to deal with the pride of life so if I have to title as much as our toilet the pride of life so we see a you know pride this is this the spirit this spirit of pride you know is a sneaky do oh the spirit of pride is a tricky one to figure out you know a lot of times in in warfare you have certain army go in and their uniform dumpin they call them boots on the ground but before you do that you have one next that day that comes in sneakily they come in under the cloak and they kind of blend in with the community they kind of hide themselves to get information and to to break down things from behind the scenes that sneaky devil called pride sometime he's hard to figure out he disguises himself as a good thing amen the definition Webster describes right a feeling or a deep pleasure or satisfaction derived from one's own achievements the all the achievements of others of those who which a one is closely associated see so it doesn't even have to be your accomplishment it can be an accomplishment of someone close to you and all of a sudden you get Alice DIF sure those it says or associated or from qualities or possessions that are widely admired we don't deal with this this one because it one thing we gotta understand pride is a demon pride will keep you from being healed pride will keep you in bondage Brad will keep you from recognizing your day in its message it's a filthy and ugly spirit that hides itself [Applause] behind something that appears good amen sometimes we we find ourselves when things are going good God is blessing you and we find a prat sort of sneaks in from the blessings of God I got the quote I got quotes all on it let me tell you something my brothers and sisters you cannot let me read some scriptures here proverbs 8 3:13 says the fear of the Lord is to hate evil he says I hate pride arrogance evil behavior perverse speech proverbs 11:2 says when pride comes then comes disgrace but when humility comes is wisdom proverbs 1310 says where very strife very surprised but wisdom is found in through those who take advice prize pride will get you to feeling sorry for yourself pride will come in and get you to build up a complex we look at the rich young ruler [Music] he knew who Jesus was he said good master yeah he Jesus told sell all you have and give to the poor and come follow me pride was in his heart to what he could do it it was a demon let me read something for you in the message go tell my disciples 5304 old five yes he says talking about man he said so she had seven dollars cast out of her pride Envy and she thought she was so pretty and there was no one like her listen now but when Jesus spoke and saying be bousley and that left her she became a new person she wasn't so pretty anymore in her own sight but she wrapped herself in the robe of meekness and gentleness and followed the master she loved him Pratt will keep you from following Jesus pride will keep you from following Jesus we had a profit coming this out who preached against shortpants priests against make up preached against lipstick earrings and all those kind of things till you adorn yourself when you take this 84 cents of dirt and dress it up and get boosted up look at me I'm something you ain't nothing but what God made [Applause] amen pride I'll keep you you can't look I can't give this up God wanted you to clean yourself up to be different from the world but you can't let God of fashions of this world because you don't wanna look a certain way to your family because you don't want to look a certain way to your coworker you don't want to look a certain way you don't want to be the heart it's a demon that'll keep you from heaven it that demon is trying to take you to hell it did it to the rich young ruler he wound up in hell over his pride how many today in this day an hour walk away from the message walk away from Christ because of pride oh we go deeper he hides himself in Christianity he hides himself in religion oh my you might say one may say well I don't associate with them holy rollers let me tell you something the Prophet pointed out in his life documentary that his first wife his first nice mother they don't take my daughter on the fellowship we wake up holy rollers didn't want to be associated with those holy rollers I got a certain air to keep up you're different you your pride you know the story yeah caused him to he loves his wife and his child he said I never do that again never do that again that was pride that caused that amen thank you my brother let's look at something here oh lord help me the Prophet said amen in question-and-answer 53:7 29 says he said the two thirds of the earth is in sin and more than that which tooth which two-thirds of the Angels was kicked out and those demon spirits come into people and habitate their bodies so you see what I mean they're demons that once they was once existed and they came into the people and gave them a nature Jesus cast seven of them out of Mary Magdalene pride both big people you see unclean filthy vulgarity Emily the strike and all these things there was spirits that was made up back there when God began to make men of his own image created those supernatural beings those spirits and then he put men in the dust of the earth which was the first man adam and man was made after the image this human man here is made after the image of animals now I want to stop right there we realized that the serpent meant was an animal so if that spirit can infiltrate and use that animal he can infiltrate and use your body he works on your emotions he works on your feelings he works on your your hearse he works on your pain he works on your discomfort to get you to carry out his evil will he is trying to destroy you he is trying to get you to lure you away from the promises of God right that spirit yeah call pride which like I say sometimes we get up and we put on our good clothes put on Dolce but the whatever it is perfume smelling good and we come to the house of God to keep you from lifting up your hands will keep you from letting go and letting go you were right at the threshold of a breakthrough in Pride man better keeps you quenched in Pride some wonder well why can't I get a breakthrough why I came out why I came I just in the back prime you have to you have to love you have to love God more than you love you sins more than you love yourself revelation 12 and for the fall first and his tail drew a third part of the stars of heaven and did cast him down the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be devour which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born that third of those angels I was no demonic spirits now you can't see them they're in another dimension but just rest assure that they are always they are here people are bound with these spirits and don't know it about a help of the God we're gonna expose that done we want people to be able to go free understand that that Pride devil is trying to take you to hell amen and the message believers to audition he says god don't look at your money he don't look at the way you dress he looks at your heart he says glad that this old-time salvation will make a pair of overalls and they took Sedo suit hug one another and called him brother will make a calico dress and a silk set together and call each other sister takes away pride that's what's the matter with the church today it's got to start you too much pride he says let down your in 6 foot of dirt in half that's right God you got a soul got to meet God you got a soul that has to meet God that's what's the matter with our Pentecostal churches I hold in his churches they got up to too much pride not I'm sure some of us can attest today could attest today and uh they get up to too much pride they get up after they get to pattern themselves after the world he says they get a church and a nice place and they think we want to pattern after the world that's where God's people always got in trouble when they pattern themselves after rest of them he's up high that many say one to me you may paint day steps read and see if the neighbor don't paint in step three when they fire mercury and seeds the neighbors don't wanna mercury they want to match I don't care whether my pants match my coat and my shirt and tie that's my suit I want my Christians I what I want my experience to match God's but that's the kind of match the church and I got a little one although that's the kind of match that Christians ought to have not whether the Jones has got a big church boy or a little got a little one I want Christ Halloween that's right there's where it comes in friends that's what we want amen so we're not we're not from this world so we don't pattern ourselves after this world but what happened he said there back in the beginning that Satan chose to hate Wow so he can use your eyes and you begin to look on the things of the world and desire Envy in pride would enter into your heart and you'll hit a pastor from the pulpit speech oh certain things in Pride would cause you to say I just can't do that wait a minute it don't take all of it well that's just a little too much that's a devil that you need to be let free from and I guarantee you you'll fall at the feet of Jesus and go wherever he go I'll do whatever you say it is a demon that settled into your heart that is keeping you from receiving the word from God in the message door to the heart he said there's a little door there he said was specific he said on the right side of your heart he said that's that room a cold prat he say he's standing at the door nothing would you let him in once you clean that room and let Jesus take over that room co-prime amen talking about pride because we make a little money because we got a new car we throw our nose up at the person who may knock and say well yeah I got here you get home the best way you can why do you think I gave you that cause I'm talking about Christian for Natalie I'm talking about Christian folk that won't offer a brother or sister a ride home lift it up I did this I did one brother fellow asked me he said well we'll wait well how do you come right proud I saw I'm glad you asked me that what's the weapon against pride I'm glad you asked there nothing I said what I said we keep it simple I asked him first I said what's a positive times a positive he said huh I said I used so what's one plus one he say - who told you that well I think you ain't figured nothing that God revealed it she revelation humbles you when you recognize that everything you got when you recognize that all that you recognize - you [Applause] see what you're doing is you taking you it was [Applause] ha proud would go to say look what I did I got this DD PhD I'm somebody you ain't nothing without God [Applause] pride double it's going to destroy you that pride double it's gonna take you for a ride amen so we kind of right pry a man with praise adoration recognizing we're blessed come from who are guarding he's my everything the old Saint you see I thank God for waking me up huh holding me in my right mind I thank you for echoes if it weren't for you might cut me gotta oh well not as somebody that woke up yesterday that didn't wake up this moment there's somebody laying on their back and can't move this morning would be glad the tree hello pride oh my god God give us the ability to buy new outfit he blesses with the job and employment provide these things for [Music] [Applause] pride let's look at we want to look you don't have to turn to it but Matthew the third chapter the prophets say God takes a man but never his spirit we see here about John the Baptist he says he says in those days John the Baptist preaching in the wilderness of Judah Judea and saying repent the kingdom of heaven is at hand for this is he that was spoken by the Prophet I say us saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord make his paths straight and the see John had his raiment of camel's hair and they anin leather and girded about his Lawrence and his meat was locusts and wild honey and were baptizing baptized in the Jordan confessing their sins now let's let's go stop right there let's let's just look at this we have the spiritual Pharisees in them sad to see the of that day and they're going on and they were that's our Father is Abraham we've been doing this for a while we know we we know what we're doing we got this all figured out and they missed the forerunner of Jesus because they was puffed up in the pride let me put it to you this way they were blinded by pride pride will blind you pride will blind you to the truth because he didn't come to wait that they were looking for in the company he was a wild man come out of the wood screaming repent baptizing people in some larger wild man untain preaching from his convictions but he knew who he was and he knew what his job was to do but those Pharisees and the Sadducees of that day couldn't accept him because they were lifted up in their pride and uh he say uh but when they saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism and he said in an AMOLED you generation of vipers her you talking to me [Laughter] who has warned you to flee from the wrath to come bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance for repentance and think not to say within yourselves we have Abraham to our Father and I say unto you the God is able to of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham and now also the axe is laid at the root of the trees therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit it's home down and cast into the fire he says I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than I whose shoes I am not worthy to bear he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and fire see and in their pride and they and they lifted up they couldn't see that the very redeemer that they had been looking for was coming in that this was the man to introduce them to that very redeemer but pride he didn't come in silk rolls he didn't have on a three-piece suit came out of the woods hunting like a wild man but he was preaching thus saith the Lord but because of a pride they were unable unable to see unable to recognize pride amen we talked about here Luke the seventh chapter you don't have to go to the cane if you like but we see that Jesus was invited to a feast a certain Pharisee invited Jesus to feast and let me tell you something my brothers and sisters we come and we pray we get up on Sunday morning and I say Sunday morning cuz that's when we get up but anytime we come to the house is low what are we praying for what are we asking for God meet us there we all have to be able to recognize that Lord I need more of you I need you daily I need you every hour Lord I want to be closer to you you have to have that earnest desire oh my the closer you get to him the closer you want to get to you so you invite your me we pray we should pray either at home or at service lord I need you so we're inviting him to this bountiful feast see the table has been spread when Jesus comes sup with me come sup with me but we see here in this story they invited Jesus and I appreciate brother Quaker you say he said Elohim came down a man to earth now I want you to look at something he destroyed the earth in Noah's day he said the sins of the world stuck to his nostrils if the sins of Noah's day stuck to his nostrils and in Jesus day he came down he left his clean throne and glory to walk amongst the filth of this world see so jesus walking feet sweat the dust from the ground and the dung of the animals between his toes on his feet it stopped to his nostrils but he came because we invite I'm here because I heard your crying let me take a side path in Moses State Amram prayed for deliverer he would go out and he would see the suffering of the people and he would come home and say y'all should read nah I'm just not hungry I just want to go up to the room and pray just keep the kids down here let me pray I'm tired of seeing the suffering of our people he would go up and he would pray he would pray all night long she be concerned you gotta eat I think you gotta eat Oh Lord Church we should have it we should pray for the suffering of the people of this present day we should be like Emery we realized that he has sinned deliverer but Lord if you could just take the scales off of the people to hide if we can just take that spirit and rebuilt that pride back to the pits of Hell from whence it came the people will go free the people will go free I for one sick and tired of seeing my family I see my family in bondage not a taskmasters will serve in his will to build his kingdom I'll pray Lord that they see the deliverer throw em round one day the angel the Lord came to and told him you will but your wife is gonna bear son and he shall be the deliverer but he had to go through some things see the king did the Satan knew that deliverer was coming so now he's trying he's killing all of it he's got these evil witches to kill all of the babies so I can fret Amram said the Lord told me what to do if you lose it put them on the river you give you keep it ya see how every no we can't put him on that River I give him away give him back to the one who gave so let me come back we invite Jesus since armies the preaching of the gospel and God is dealing with our hearts he come he's sit in the corner we see in the store how the young prostitute she was the only one recognized that Jesus was here with dirty feet the only one that recognized the Pharisees he but he invited all of his uppity friends those that have been blessed well-to-do and they just going around and eating drinking and being merry fellowshipping with one another and ignoring Jesus is that what keeps us from seeing Jesus if you invite him he will come he will come recognize that he's here wanting to meet your knee wanting to deliver you from whatever you were bound with wanting to set you free but you won't clean his feet so this prostitute came and she recognized her heart was so heavy she went and she spent all she had to get the most expensive oil that she could possibly purchase she came back and she anointed him with a priest and cleaned his feet with tears of repentance on her knees Lord I'm sorry but Lord I know I've heard what you did for a woman at the will Lord I desire to be free I desire to be free she washed his feet but tears of repentance dried of his feet with her hair and she the host woman your sins which are many I'm now forgiving my brothers and sisters let us not get so caught up in just coming to church and we miss Jesus he's here but you have to let go of your pride open that door of pride and let him in your secret place let him in your secret place that pride will keep you on bondage and he's here wanting to set you free one in the set you free but we just have to yield a man recognize that Jesus is here don't leave him in the corner wait dirty feet you invited him to sup with you to fellowship with you Jesus and when he comes you don't even annoy him you don't kiss his neck you don't wash his feet with your tears recognize who is in this recognized in the message I stand at the door not 1957 1208 he says dear God dying lamb meat humble and lowly he said the birds had nests and the Foxes has Dean and you didn't have a place and yet the very lord of glory when you were born

identify was something that was spoken a man in that in that message causes you to just kind of do a little checkup and on yourself and it's so easy so these is he was just kind of talking about this beginning you know the definition of the gave us a feeling of a pleasure of a deep satisfaction the one's accomplishments or the conference mentor somebody close to you because I was just thinking on that and you know I'm just thinking about you know we were believing God for a church for for spiritual time and I got nothing wrong with that but I tell you what we don't want to go in there with a spirit of pride [Music] not only did it tell us a man to avoid the spirit of pride but to overcome it that he gave you a solution and the solution to overcome prior is you have to give God praise constantly stay in a place of praise don't don't ever think you accomplished nothing on your own everything you have God did it God did it Thank You Menzies bringing the thought of how the Pharisees and Sadducees and Pharisees miss the forerunner because of their pride and you know if you missed the forerunner then you're gonna actually miss the coming of Christ you understand those in that day they missed a forerunner John the Baptist so they also missed Christ's and today if they missed the Prophet they're gonna miss Christ they're not gonna make the rapture if you reject the forerunner you're not gonna make the rapture right you're gonna miss the second term so so I'll tell you what church this is something that we want to be sure that lord I don't want that if that's in my heart God search me hey they used to they used to sing a song [Music] homey Shyne Oh me [Music] at the line from the lighthouse Shyne homey whoa shine [Music] me he's shy Oh as a love from Oh come on sing

place - for a checkup want to make sure everything is right between you and your Savior you know and and and his brother Troy said they're early and they're in the store maybe is talking about how oftentimes the reason that we choose to dress the way that we dress because we're ashamed a man in front of others we want to we don't want to look so different from everybody else so we we want to try to appeal to friends when I try to appeal to our family it may want to try to appeal to others but we're not appealing to God they won't let the light from the lighthouse shine on you today got it

was read it was talking about Mary Magdalene how she was the Bible says that Jesus cast seven demons out of her and we had a prophet come along and tell us what those demons were and now one of the demons was a demon of pride a man that she had to be free from him what pride does you all might not realize that a man we were talking about that in Sunday school this morning his self-love reduces his self-love and and and and and and and and when you actually the Prophet told us that we when we turned to our self-love we actually move away from the love of God self-love is what calls you to post selfies they're all about you and Mannie looks at you have because god bless you with them all right but it's not for you to flog in front of everybody that's not look I mean you flaunt your body that's not what you do if god bless you belong here you don't fly bad just thank God for you but but self-love is what's actually caused us to turn away from the love of God be careful these areas these are small demons but big penis god help us is my forever don't let this go in when they are not together receive it today is it's from heaven heaven I want to just read a scripture here on Friday night we had our business meeting and and I'm gonna read from pack six we did a couple things a man and one that I need to we voted a man Deacon and also brother Quinton was voted in as a trustee here at the church but we own that as far as the deacon is concerned I want to read the scripture and I told you all I wanted to lay hands my precious brother Troy he was it was voted in and what happened is that I was going by a scripture where it says that the Deacon had to be first proven and and we read that out of Timothy where he had to be first proven so we took that year proving but this morning I found out that I was I was wrong but proven time went for the last four years should only been a few weeks and I had to apologize to brother Troy for that I shouldn't I did it that long and but I'm glad that he's so patient with me amen but as we go forward in the future proven won't be a year Amen it's gonna be only a few weeks but I think for this past year I want to say that I watched for the Troy everything that I laid before him that we wanted to do even down to just him being able to present the word apt to teach and if he did not demonstrate that this morning and just throughout the year he's apt to teach and I'm grateful for what I see the Lord is doing in his life and I'm just I'm just so happy I've know where God has brought him from know where God has brought over from and and when you see the handle or just so it's so precious amen and we got such a faith in such a hope that we got family that's not ever they come in a man they come in my brother always somebody say just just look at me look at where I come from don't give up on nobody God got a way of doing things amen so this morning we want to officially they man pray over our precious brother we want to do it according to Scripture Acts chapter 6 verse 1 says and it was in those days when the number of the disciples was multiplied there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration but then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them and said it is not reason that we should leave the Word of God and serve tables wherefore brethren look ye out among you seven men of honest report full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom whom we may appoint over this business but we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the Ministry of the word and the saying please the whole multitude and they chose stephen a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost and Philip and the praça rest in the mechana and tucked timon and parmenas our meanest and nicolas a proselyte of antioch whom they set before the apostle's and when they had prayed they laid their hands on their the Word of God increase the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly and the great company of the priests were obedient to the faith a man brother trophy would come at this time we just want to have a word of Prayer over
