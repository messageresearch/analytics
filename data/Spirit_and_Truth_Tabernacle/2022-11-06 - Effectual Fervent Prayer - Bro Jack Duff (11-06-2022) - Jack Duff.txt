the presence of the Lord is is is here a man and I cannot um go any further without acknowledging brother Marquis good God almighty brother what a what a what a wonderful surprise amen this morning for us just to you know he had text me early this week say pastors uh any more room for any specials I say um who's singing they say I am I say yeah we got room we got we got room for you brother so uh man that was that was a real blessing it was a real blessing amen so good to have everybody back home amen many of the saints were way on last week and our young people went there to the meeting and I did hear uh one one uh praise report but you know and I'm grateful for that but I did want to make a little space any if anybody else from my young people group want to testify about your experience last week I would give you time to do that uh because I I just think it's just that important amen but if there's any of our youth that say I just want to give my own personal testimony I'll I'll I'll give room for that so just know that all right just know that praise the Lord oh my all right y'all can be seated just for a little bit I'm sorry not y'all damn them y'all can be seen y'all keep standing with me and if any of the young people just if you kind of sit next to the Lord I think I want to give my testimony just just get word to me we'll make sure we we allow you to do that today um I am going to read a scripture here and just good to have everybody here in the house of what I thought sister Tom Wayne a little earlier she's back from New York amen and just get to have a place where she lives there was a lot of Destruction with this last storm that came through but uh God spared her area amen God spared her area we really thank God for for watching watching over uh her uh her place there so thank the Lord uh I want to turn in the Bible to James chapter 5 and another another announcement I just want to make mention of but two weeks from now we're gonna have a a speaker uh brother jingle will be coming to speak for us uh I think it's the Sunday right before Thanksgiving and uh you know I was fellowship with my brother and sister wrote last and they mentioned his name and they were telling me about the the type of Fellowship they had with his family years ago used to drive from Port St Lucie to Lake Worth uh but just being service and couldn't understand a word that was being said but yet sat there for two years in fellowship and I just met so much to her I said you know you bringing up his name and I saw him on the video there for the meetings in in South Carolina I said we haven't had brother Gene in a good while so let me just reach out to him and see you know if he can come and and he said yeah he'll be here amen I believe it's the 20th so let's let's put that Amen on our calendar we're going to look forward to that y'all gonna shout your way out of here um I'll tell y'all because the way that we were just worshiping God might we came we got to stop being bound by time I mean we we creatures of Eternity and when we go to church we wanted to be able to let loose and let go let God have his way brother trolls just tells me to say on Wednesday night just felt the presence of the Lord here and the brother uh uh Thomas was preaching like we just and we got to cut things off because we got chances outside waiting to get in here lock up we don't want to be in that situation much longer so we're trusting the Lord to open up a door that we cannot see amen amen amen amen James chapter 5. we will read a man from verse 13. here in James chapter 5. praise God the Bible declares is any among you afflicted let them pray uh is any Mary let him sing songs is any sick among you let them call for the Elders of the church and let them pray over him anointed him with oil in the name of the Lord Amen in the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and if he have committed sins they shall be forgiven him I confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that ye may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man Avail it lunch Elias was a man subject to like passions as we already prayed earnestly that it might not rain and it rained not on the Earth by the space of three years and six months and he prayed again and the heaven gave ring and the Earth brought forth her fruit the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word was just bow in a record of prayer father we thank you for the uh privilege of reading the word of God we thank you for your presence that is here today we know that you're here and now we pray that the Holy Spirit now we're just quick in our understanding to the word in which we are that we have read and father may you make it live for this very moment and which we're in and may the Holy Spirit take complete control of our thoughts uh take control of the congregation speak to every heart those that are present those that are online speak father the only way that you can God it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you you can be seated foreign we want to take for our top topic today uh effectual fervent fervent prayer a manufactured fervent prayer uh we we read that there in the scripture in verse 16 where it says confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that you may be healed uh the effectual further forever righteous man about it much and you know I might forget to say this later so let me just say this now um there is to me a um there's a pandemic that uh is going that that I've heard about and it's a pandemic of of mental health issues uh and uh I mean it's a pandemic and I I'm gonna preach a sermon on it later so I'm gonna try not to say too much right now but I do want to say this uh that one of the things that I have noticed with this pandemic is that a lot of people like to confess their mental health problems uh in a public forum and uh what I find in Scripture that that is not the way to handle anything you're going through like that according to what we just read in the Bible it says to do two things first is confess your faults one two another it didn't say take it publicly find somebody that that you can that you consider to be trustworthy that you can take that to a man and confess that to them that this is what I'm dealing with now after you confess that to him you don't take it to people that you look and just agree with you what you do is you take it to people that actually have a prayer life because after you have spoken these words the thing that they're supposed to do amen the Bible says is pray that's right for one another and the prayer is so that you might be healed that means you don't have to take it to the Past you can take to any other believer that you got confidence in you can take it to them and the Bible says that the effectual [Music] fervance prayer of a righteous man or woman avails much if you really want to be free follow the scriptural principles we don't want to just talk about it we want people to be free amen but this um this this effectual fervent prayer and I got just a little uh inspiration of of Triple A man uh with this Triple A man just stay with me um um here you know the uh the prophet makes a statement and we want to try to uh background and lay down you know the foundation for what prayer is um in this message the Supernatural and brother Brandon makes a statement says man and women who live in there this atmosphere prayer who are living there are misunderstood so as you see it they they become peculiar uh they don't hear the things of the world people that live in this state of prayer they don't hear the things of the world if they do so they sometimes they might hear if they do they don't pay attention to them all right now amen they don't pay attention to them they just move on God never put that in there for nothing God never come for just any haphazard way prayer is not a perhaps glory to God amen amen prayer is not something we gambling with amen prayer is certain prayer is sure amen pray prayers the way we get in contact with God prayer activates Triple A all right Hallelujah just stay with me here prayer is a sincere thing prayer is talking to God amen I love this prayer is not get down shut your eyes and thinking about your washing or your work you'll uh uh work you're doing say Lord help me and John and heal Miss Jones and so forth that's not prayer that's repeating some words but prayer is to come into an atmosphere where you realize that you're in the presence of God and you're moving to then in the deepest of sincerity hey man first you say a little worship get that now amen when you when you're praying and you're seeking God first come before God went worship and we're going to read that in the scripture in a little bit but but this is how you approach God always start out with a little worship or let them know how great he is let them know how good he is let him know I remember you did it before I know you're able to do it again Hallelujah but if you don't do it Jesus I'm still going to worship him and I'm still gonna praise you because I love you God prayer prayer amen first you say a little worship oh Jehovah how I love you you see it then after the worship of prayer then you come with a sincere heart asking if you abide in me not go out from behind the curtains in the world today and run around and try to get back in the curtains tonight if you abide in me my words abide in you otherwise if you like Aaron's Rob that's pulled up to the Shekinah Glory by the golden pot of manna where you can eat at any time and your soul is refreshed and blooming and yielding abiding if you're abide in me my words are bothering you then ask what you will it'll be given to you I'm gonna I'm gonna just put a pause on that quote right there uh I want to just kind of catch a scripture here out of Matthew six amen uh praise the Lord this effectual fervent prayer amen amen sometimes that's probably why we haven't seen answers because we're not coming the right way effectual fervent prayer uh you know this I'll just be honest I I got this little inspiration um it was a little over a year ago and uh roughly a year ago the Lord allowed us to just kind of approach a church about uh purchasing their their building and um you know I had got some inside information that this church was uh very small congregation and the older congregation I said you know what let me just approach him see if they'd be willing to sell and uh you know so the real estate agent that I was using she she actually uh went by the church on a Sunday morning and set in the congregation and waited for the pastor to finish and just hung around didn't know really who who waited just hung around and then finally this is the past approached her and said can I help you and she's like uh yeah I'm looking to talk to the pastor of the church he's like I'm the pastor so she start telling him you know what our what her plan was and she was representing our church and that she was there uh you know he said okay I'll sit down at least talk to you so we got lunch prepared and I went down there and sat with lunch with the with the pastor and mine he was telling me that you know he said you know years ago there was a church that I was speaking in I was filling in for pastor they had lost their passing I was filling in and I walked out you know to the church and I read James 5 the factual forever righteous man rebellious much and uh and he said I walked out and I just began to uh I read my scripture and it says that church when I read it it said they said read it again so you know what kind of turkey with that amen read it again and you say the affection for every righteous man available as much he said I don't think he understood why they said read it again because that really struck a chord you know for them and uh so he was telling me that story and I said well yes you know you don't realize I'm praying over your church and uh and you just telling me the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man Avail much you know and I just kind of held on to that for a little bit and you know and and I just just kind of had it in my notes and and I ran into something else uh here lately and I said you know what I think I'm a preach this sermon uh but I just want to just kind of talk about this prayer amen today because Prayer Changes Things prayer prayer settles things prayer prayer is our weapon come on church prayer is our weapon amen glory to God is the greatest weapon we have in our under our control amen we got to use it Hallelujah glory to God Amen so here let's pick up Matthew uh six verse 5 and uh here you know brother Brandon's just telling us in this when we're approaching God come amen with a uh with pretty much the attitude of Thanksgiving let's start with Thanksgiving and Jesus actually says that here in Matthew chapter 6 verse 5 praise God Amen uh he says this and when thou when thou and when thou praise thou should not be be as the Hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of them verily I say unto you they have their reward amen but thou when thou prayers enter come on now into thy closet and when thou has shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father would seeth in secret shall reward thee openly all right amen but when you uh when you pray use not vain repetition as a heathen do for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking but uh be not ye therefore like unto them for your father knoweth what things ye have need of Amen before you ask him so if God already know what I need before I ask him then why does he want me to pray because that's the way y'all communicate that's the way he talks to you and you talk to him praise God I'm even you know I'm the same way I'm a father myself and you know my I might know that my children might need something amen but oftentimes I'm waiting for that child to ask for what they need I don't want to just assume I want them to ask what they need and then as a father I like to step up and try to amen make that thing happen for them when I wait for my children to ask sometimes I don't want to get ahead of the game they may be trying to work it out on their own hallelujah amen but when they come in their ass then it invoked something inside of me same thing with God when we go to God and we ask it invoked something out of God he wants to meet your need he wants to heal your body he wants to satisfy your soul he wants to fill you with the Holy Ghost he wants to do these things he wants to do it more for you than you want it yourself okay look at this and that but when you pray he was not vain repetitions as the Heathen do for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking be not ye therefore like unto them for your father knoweth what things you have neither before you ask him look at this verse 9 after this manner therefore pray you our father Jesus given us how to pray and this is the worship part Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed that is worship brother Brandon said praise approach him with worship with Thanksgiving Hallowed be thy name hallelujah look at this thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven amen even before you ask what you need realize that his will must be done amen So you you're submitting yourself to God's will before you even ask come on church amen thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen Schofield made some notes on this prayer and he uh he says these in in in just his notes he says prayer begins with the attitude of worship that's what brother Branham just said uh it's Hallowed be thy name this is an acknowledgment of of the absolute Holiness of all that God is and does we acknowledge his Holiness prayer contains an element of Thanksgiving who can hallow God which means to hold him sacred and offer worship to him amen who can handle a god without Thanksgiving all right another thing Schofield says true prayer accepts in advance the will of God true prayer accepts in advance the will of God whether known or unknown whether to Grant or to withhold we still accept Amen in advance the will of God all right also another thing about prayer prayer should always Envision the Divine will and Kingdom as objectives which will be realized on Earth so prayer again should always end Vision the Divine will and Kingdom as objectives when uh which will be realized on Earth that's why I say thy kingdom come thy will be done as it is in heaven it'll be done on Earth let me pick up the rest of this quote here that I just stopped that brother Branham tells us there amen prayers not haphazard amen prayer is not just get down and just say a little repeating of words amen uh prayers just getting getting real sincere before God you know just I think it was this week yes it was this week I had a specific need amen and I said you know and I had a number of things that would just count on my plate and I said I just just got to go into my closet and I don't mean a physical closet it's just a a special place you can go to and it's just you and God alone so I just went into my office and shut the door and I I got down I began to pray and I just began to Worship the Lord amen and and you know I'm gonna tell you something about prayer Hallelujah uh it don't take God a long time to answer you now some things he might have you wait on amen but sometimes God will just come immediately and speak to you prayer is not always you doing the talking prayer sometimes is getting your spirit quiet enough where you can listen and hear what God has to speak to you so I had a specific need that I was that I was I was I was uh kind of looking for and you know and I knew kind of what it was and I just counted Lord if you know if it's your will whatever you want to do in this situation God I'm just gonna bring it to you give me your wisdom on how to handle it and if it's not for me to handle then just let me Let It Go and uh and as I just begin to just seek the Lord uh the Lord remind him says uh I need a worker for a particular thing amen and and Lord say uh remember uh in the prayer he's telling me say remember so and so fill out an application call her she'll be the one to do the job I say uh wrote that down real quick and then I kept praying and uh and when I got up from praying I sent the little text to the young lady and she didn't respond to me before you know I think about four or five hours went by she responded to say yes I would love to take that position and I and I got all connected and then when she got with the client the client said this lady know what she doing but I got the answer for that particular person to be the caregiver through prayer God will speak to you and give you the answer that you need if you could just stop for a moment and seek his space oh Hallelujah whatever you've gone through in life prayer is what you use to get in contact with God it activates Triple Eight let me just go on a little bit more in this in this quote Supernatural reading brother random says you see the failures of the church the Pentecostal Church the method is the Baptist and all it's a failing to that uh to that abide and grace of God tonight you'll shout and clap your hands and dance in the aisles speak in tongues that's gifts gifts is no good unless you're abiding in the Shekinah Glory we don't want folk just coming here with gifts we want people that's got a life of Prayer they are they sincere amen they're serving God in sincerity amen now God can anoint those people in the congregation Hallelujah it says he says this uh uh uh uh those things are fine I have nothing to say against them they're of God shouting and blessing God is wonderful speaking in tongues or translation in tongues or I mean interpretation of tongues it's the same all these other things Gifts of healing prophecies and and all these things are marvelous but they're no good they're not fruitful they can't yield the right uh they're you you're the right unless you're living in the presence of the Shekinah the atmosphere around you is Godly all right that's the reason that men and women are not permitted to these things because you go out here and call a blessing over something uh got it curse a curse something got it bless it's a abiding presence to know the will of God then don't don't look uh what the world's gonna say about you is what God thinks about you then you're living in his presence oh Lord that's exactly where we want to live in the presence in his presence this effectual fervent prayer is uh fervent is active that's what fervent means it's active it's having or displaying a passionate intensity amen fervin is is having a or displaying a passionate intensity right uh effects was having Invincible energy I like these words effectual having invincible energy you know you realize when you pray in the name of Jesus it's just as if Jesus himself was praying Jesus was never denied by God let me tell you something you also will never be denied by God sometimes the answer is yes sometimes the answer is no and sometimes the answer is not yet but you'll never be denied by God amen but it's effectual is having Invincible energy and I wrote this note down this type of prayer will not take no for an answer any sexual prayers a prayer that won't take no for an answer now I might have to wait on it amen but I'm not taking no for an answer hey I might have to wait on my healing but I'm not taking no for an answer I might have to wait for that bill to be paid but I'm not taking no for an answer oh Hallelujah somebody amen if that's what the prayer with Invincible energy amen this is a prayer that is certain that the answer will be yes I like this amen of valeth when it says available much is to have strength to overcome to be a force amen that's what this available I want to just kind of go I got a a a um a PowerPoint that I just want to share with you I was doing some research and um uh just looking at this this topic of prayer and and Charles Spurgeon it's kind of just wanted to see what he had to say about prayer and there are some things he wrote some statements down and I just want to share some of those statements with you of of what he said about prayer praise God praise God in that um I have a uh the the what's called there it is amen um just a couple statements here the very Act of Prayer is a blessing get that just a very Act of prayer is a blessing and I remember I think it was brother Jason that mentioned to us that what made us different from any other animal that soul that we have on the inside is it has the ability to contact its maker the soul can connect to God In Prayer this is a I mean it's a direct connection it's a direct Channel when you use prayer it's a direct channel to get into the presence of God Amen the very Act of prayer is a blessing another statement he makes is to pray is to enter the Treasure House of God and to gather riches out of an inexhaustible storehouse when I pray I enter into Treasure House oh my I can just see myself looking around amen and brother Brandon even told to say when you pray climb up on that ladder amen get all the way to the very top don't just take the things that you can get to down here them five dollar blessings are them ten dollar blessings God I need ten thousand I need twenty thousand I need fifty thousand I need a million God I'm climbing way to the top and I'm going into the storehouse Amen to gather riches out of an inexhaustible storehouse this other statement he makes he says you are before the Lord when you're praying you are before the Lord let your words be for you you gotta you gotta remember who you talking to you ever took you before the one that can change the situation in prayer especially when you come with that attitude of gratitude with that Thanksgiving it puts you into his presence and now when you get there realize whose presence you're in let your words be for you and let your heart be perfect let your Words Be Few and let your heart be fervent another statement he makes he says as well you can as well could you expect a plant to grow without air and water as you expect your heart to grow without praying faith amen look at this another one You observe that the desire to commune with God and that's what prayer is it's not all all the time just asking asking asking but it's a desire to commune with God you know there are times where I've already asked and God has already answered and now my responsibility go back and thank him that's that's prayer now I go back and I start thanking him for what he did that's me communicating with my God hallelujah glory to God Amen he says you will observe that desire to commune with God is intensified by the failure of all other sources of consolation your desire to commune with God is intentional I didn't mean you get desperate when everybody else is saying no and you can't get no answer from no you get desperate you go before God Amen You observe that the desire to come in with God is intensified by the failure of all other sources of consolation prayer is the best response to hatred prayer this is Charles Spurgeon making these comments prayer is the best response to hatred glory to God here's another one it is well said that neglected prayer is the birthplace of all evil me neglected prayer is the birthplace for all evil amen here's another one prayer is an art which only the spirit can teach us I think uh yeah only the spirit can teach us he is The Giver of all prayers I love that only spiritual teachers hey man here's another one no man can progress in Grace if people seeks prayer the actual fervent prayer amen no man can progress in Grace if people say prayer and here's one more he who knows how to overcome with God In Prayer has Heaven and Earth at his disposal you get into the storehouse anytime you need to but you're not just going in just to get things from God but you're going in because you want to have a relationship with them knowing that he is the give of every good gift hallelujah hallelujah all right let's move on a little bit I'm gonna come back I got some more from Charles Spurgeon there but I'll come back to that in a second amen here um when we look at this scripture the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man about much fervent is active effectual is having Invincible energy available is to be a forced um I was just looking amen at some notes here from Schofield and Scofield type he actually uh said the prayer of faith let me just read this out of verse 15 again uh James 5 15. it says in the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and if he have committed sins they shall be forgiven him confess your false one to another and pray one for another that you may be healed the effectual fervent prayable righteous man of God much now um Scofield tied a note here in uh verse 15 the prayer of faith he tied that to mark 11. I like that tie-in and I want us to read Mark 11 22. glory to God this effectual fervent prayer amen this prayer fake tied over here to Mark 11. Amen in verse 22 and Mark 11 says and Jesus answering saith unto them have faith in God glory for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith glory to God therefore I send to you what things soever you desire when ye pray believe that you receive them and ye shall have them see prayer ain't gonna take no for an answer all right amen it goes on the sex and when you stand praying for kids if they have all the gifts in it that your father also which is in heaven May forgive you your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses now I love the way Schofield tied that Amen to Mark 11 this prayer of faith and I want to just kind of pick up a couple quotes amen from Brother Branham uh regarding that this this first one is coming out of service we would see Jesus amen serves we will see Jesus look at what the prophet says he says we should never glory to God I like this one here we should never live under our privileges as we are today that's what they say we should never live under our privileges as we are today the great powers of God lays within the reach of every member of the body of Christ look at this he says whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe that you receive it and you shall have it it shall be given to you I don't care what the devil say Amen I'ma activate amen my connection with god oh Hallelujah and prayer is what I use to activate that connection any time of the day I can start praying anywhere I can pray glory to God I can be my call just driving down the street knocking into into prayer I can be in my closet in the house I can enter into prayer Glory to God I can be walking down the hall of my of my job and I can enter into prayer wherever I go and I get a direct connection praise God Amen the connection is never broken and it's never fussing going in and out it's direct praise God Hallelujah and it activates Heaven on my behalf I come the right way I can expect God to do anything effectual fervent prayer of the righteous avails much I'm tired of living underneath my privileges amen I'm tired of it he said he says it shall be given to you it says I was reading in the Lexicon the other day over there and look at the scripture I was just quoting the original habit when thou press he says here's what I want to get to he said if you should say to this mountain be thou plucked up and cast into the sea amen and believe in your heart that is being done believe that it's being done believe that it is being done you catch those words believe that it is being done amen even right now my healing is manifested even right now my child is on the way back my way with child is on the way back amen you gotta see it being done no matter what you hear no matter what the doctor says no matter about anybody you gotta see it being done through prayer look at this now Glory he says uh now a lot of people that say pray for me brother all right Lord help this dear brother give them a prayer card and and best you can and they've seen others heal night after night time after time uh I didn't get it I'll try it again tomorrow night you discredit God you discredit God you discredit his words now now notice what he just said this is the person that keep coming into the prayer line they've been prayed for once amen and nodded back again Hallelujah and they say you discredited in God when you do that now remember brother Branham gave some very good advice to uh uh blind John Ryan because he he got in the prayer line multiple times he said now a brother Brandon you prayed for him you told me I was healed you say yes you are healed and he said not only not only did I tell you I was here you told me you believed it right he said well I do believe it and and I believe what you said and I believe I'm Healed he said it's just something going wrong he said he said no brother this is what you need to do he says since you believe what I said amen you've already been prayed for not go thanking God for being healed hey Hallelujah you don't already ask God for this blessing and that blessing now it's time for you to start thanking God and let me taste some God do things opposite we think we think people after they have given us something we thank them after they give us a gift we say thank you after it happens and I think that's actually caused us to to doubt God sometimes because the way we treat one another in just this uh human relationship but God wants us to start thanking him before we even receive it before we see the manifestation of it we thank him because our things will bring it into manifestation Hallelujah Hallelujah it says watch if you believe in your heart that is being done maybe that mountain looks just exactly like it always looked but in your heart you believe it there might not be but one little grain of sand but something is tearing loose I got a big mountain and I just said be cast into the sea and this mountain only lost one grain of sand but it still looked like a big mountain I'm not looking at the mountain I'm looking at the grain of sand that left because if one thing of sand will leave then the next screen of sand will leave and the next grain of sand relief and before you know it that mountain that's become a plane [Applause] focus on the grain of sand not the mountain something's tearing loose something began to take place see when we believe that it's being done but you'll see we just want something spontaneously and what do we get left out left out because it weakens in a few nights I want to get on that on faith the Lord hosting of the the Lord of hosts in you see so see we don't want this thing just to weaken us we want to stay amen committed to the journey and that's what effectual fervent prayer is it's it's remained an active remaining engaged amen remaining remaining committed not taking No Finance it might not be yet but I'ma get it because this is in the will of God it's in the will of God for me to have my children it's in the will of God no matter what I'ma just keep praying let me uh pick up a little bit more from spurt these statements that he make I think is real blessing this this other one amen uh I thought I had did a update to this but it looked like it's a repeat but I'll say it again because maybe God wanted to say it again prayer itself is an art which only the Holy Ghost can teach us he is The Giver of all prayer pray for prayer pray for prayer pray till you can pray foreign he says this if if you want that Splendid power in prayer you must remain in loving abiding Union with the Lord Jesus Christ look at this one a mighty piece of weaponry in the Battle of prayer is God's promise let's let's make sure we got that a mighty piece of weaponry in the Battle of prayer is God's promise and what I what I've always uh told you just a few weeks ago when we were preaching amen um uh the battle's not yours amen and I forget what we titled but the battle is the Lord I showed you all how uh they begin to remind God of his promise while they were praying amen so a mighty piece of Weaponry Amen in the Battle of prayer is God's promise you have to know God's promises so you can remind him of what he said so another thing that's going to go along with prayers reading your Bible we heard a prophet say Amen that I for a Christian to grow stronger amen they ought to pray and read their Bible every day read your Bible to understand his promises amen and then in prayer you can remind him of what his word said I don't know about you but you know and some of y'all fathers hey man you've had children that will remind you Daddy you said and you know I'm gonna tell you something when when when when that child come with a daddy you said it changed everything all the excuses go out the window I know I said but no you don't use that link you you when you hear Daddy you said like you're right child I did say it I don't know how but we gonna make this thing happen because as a father you want to come true and if you got that inside of you where you think you got that from that comes from almighty God when we remind him daddy you said daddy you promise daddy you spoke this to me Oh Daddy I know you won't let me down daddy you never failed me yet Daddy a mighty piece of weapon in the battle prayers God's promise here's another one cold prayers asked for denial so you got to be sincere when you're approaching God come with a heart a heart heart of gratitude amen and stop thinking from what he's already done and Lord let your will be done in this situation too but cold prayers asked for tonight and y'all know we sometimes give God them cold prayers well Lord I'm supposed to pray about it so I'ma just uh that's a cold prayer and you just asking for denial here's another one groanings which cannot be uttered are often prayers which cannot be refused I get in prayer and I don't even know what to say anymore I don't know if you've ever been there before don't even know what to say when you're praying grownness that cannot be uttered are often prayers which cannot be refused foreign here's another one true prayers Trading of the heart with God that's what thou will be done not not my will but let your will be done I'ma treat my heart with yours what's your desire guard in this true prayers training of the heart with God here's another one sometimes when we do not receive confidence in our prayers when we are broken and cast down that is when we are really wrestling and prevailing in prayer when we don't receive comfort in our prayers when we are broken and cast down that is when we're really wrestling and prevailing in prayer here's another one I like this one prayer plumes the wings of young English so that they may learn to mount Above the Clouds because you know Eagles the bill is a bird that's built to rise above a storm they don't just get trapped down inside the storm they can actually rise above a storm and what what prayer does prayer is the tools that you use to get you above the storm prayer brings in a strength to God's Warriors amen and sends them forth to spiritual battle with their muscles firm and their armor in place I love this here's another one that he says we know not what prayer cannot do and there's some double negatives all over the place but we know not what prayer cannot do that means prayer can do prayer can do anything there's no limits when a Believer gets on their knees and begin to pray and there's sometimes you can't even get on your knees but you just enter into the channel wherever you are entering to the channel realize the power that you have that is in your prayer can we go a little further here the uh okay I said uh Triple A and as I was thinking about this I just began to think you know about out you know a lot of times we use prayer we kind of use it like Triple A hello somebody only oh you only called AAA but that's not prayer that that's not that's not communicating with God when you have an emergency that's the only time you go to him no that's not how we want to treat God now we know he'll be there in in a time of emergency but that's not the only time we're going to talk to him come on somebody right amen I I I I begin to just think about this prayer is not just roadside assistance to the believer foreign how we communicate with our maker [Music] amen I said prayer is not just asking but prayer is also thanking first Thessalonians 5 18 says this in everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you I started looking at this you know AAA I did a little uh uh uh uh uh Google search hey man and and I said well I said what's the benefits of having AAA and uh you know and as I as I start researching some some other things came up and and let me just kind of tell you what my uh my Triple A is my AAA that I'm talking to you today is activating Angelic assistance so prayer is your AAA prayers were activates Angelic assistance Hallelujah now now as I looked at this amen and Google it brought up amen um a uh uh a term for ah I.T information technology or computer term technology technological term can I use those words they use AAA in technology Stay With Me and what Triple A in technology is it's um it's security uh for Authentication authorization and accounting amen AAA in technology it's in the security field amen AAA security is for authentication authorization and accounting how many of y'all have email in here hey everybody got an email address hey man you don't realize when you are using email hey man you're using this type of security hey man if you have any type of online portal that you're trying to get access to you have to go through this security model you have to go through authentication authorization and accounting oh Hallelujah somebody amen now authentication it involves a user providing as to who they are so oftentimes we need to know your username before we can log you in before we can give you access we need to know your username glory to God and everybody's username is is unique to them hey God wants to know what your username is father come in the name of Jesus starting to gain access now amen not only am I coming in the name of Jesus but God I'm thanking you for what you did for me you woke me up this morning amen you provided my needs on yesterday and I and I just believe like the like despair if you woke me up today you can provide a worm for me today too amen hey you never failed me yet God this is my authentication as I'm approaching God oh hallelujah it's your username and your password that's what allows you to get access to the different platforms all right hey man authorization actually follows Authentication so once we realize your password is Right amen your username is right then we authenticate you and we allow you we give you authorization to access hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah now you gotta understand something about I mean here it says authorization is different from authentication and that authentication only checks the user's identity whereas authorization dictates what the user is allowed to do so once I have been uh authorized hallelujah amen I've given my username I've given my password now I'm authorized to use the system amen as I have need of I'm authorized to approach heaven I'm authorized to approach God I'm authorized to get what I need from God I'm authorized to climb this ladder and make my request known to God I'm authorized to do it amen and Hallelujah if the devil did not want me he should not have given me access oh he should have he should have made me forget my password but but since I remembered my password and I remembered my username I'm authorized to ask God for anything [Music] if you say to the mountain be thou removed and don't doubt in your heart you can have what you say you have been authorized [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah foreign tication has gone forth my username and password my authorization gives me access to all of Heaven but now it's accounting and what accounting does Amen accounting tracks where you go after you receive access to the system where you going and now that you don't come into the presence of God where you going church Hallelujah glory to God make sure as you're going before God that you amen you don't have nothing in your heart against nobody because that'll block your prayer that'll block the answer to prayer make sure your heart is clear now you can just ask whatever you want before God you're authorized to do that I was just looking at this and amen and thanking God uh uh you know just for for this the security amount of authentication authorization accounting amen but as I was looking at amen um AAA roadside assistance because again people use prayer just as a a tool to get when they broke down now I want to get God involved my health is broke down I want to get God involved amen this happened in my family I want to get you know sometimes prayer can be a preventative mention yeah prayer can be used as a preventative measure before something happens to your family that's what happened with Joe before his children were lost job had already offered prayer on their behalf Hallelujah prayer how we communicate with our God I was looking at this so what are the benefits of AAA at roadside assistance and I found amen their their benefits is it is roadside assistance amen uh they also got identity theft monitoring so nobody can steal your identity hey man uh if you get locked out of your car amen AAA can be called to come and pop your locks but I'ma tell you another thing I see I remember brother wisdom I believe brother wisdom that shared it with me one time uh he was in a situation no it wasn't oh two situations one with brother wisdom one was brother Wesco a man one with brother wisdom uh he was in a situation where he was driving and I guess got so caught up in and realized that uh uh my goodness I'm about to run out of gas out here on this highway he says I I I didn't want to walk wherever I was so so I just began to pray that God would just put enough gas in the car to get me to a gas station see you don't need to call roadside assistance he has something greater than roadside assistance I'ma use my prayer amen and God just put enough gas in here so I can get to the gas station I heard somebody else say that amen they didn't have no gas and I guess didn't even have money to get gas they took water put it in the gas tank and the car kept going now some of y'all say hey I ain't gonna do that but you know what there's a guy that's already proven that his car could run by water that's true it's wherever their faith is at brother time where brother Wesco one time was he in the snow in New York glory to God and he realized he'd unlocked his keys in the car his family called heco God how am I gonna amen get into this car I ain't got no way to get it he said a word of prayer and it said after he prayed he saw the locks just popped why did the locks pop he activated Angelic assistance come on somebody amen he activated Angelic assistance when he played and prayer can do anything when you find yourself in any situation prayer can do anything oh Jesus see roadside assistance is usually contacted when there's an emergency let's see for the believer amen when we're activating Angelic assistance log in and uh once they've logged in and checked their credentials as a believer your credentials need to be checked as a believer amen as a Believer you're authorized to speak to your mountains amen and this is better than roadside assistance because uh you can call them when you're in trouble but I noticed something with roadside assistance that you can call and when you're in trouble but sometimes they still don't know how to get to you and you're out here in the middle of nowhere and they ask you for a crossroad all right if you have I'm I'm logged it on with the app and this app has my GPS coordinates put those GPS coordinates in your computer and come see about me come on right but but don't don't don't don't be talking I can't find and I can't look when we're going to heaven it ain't never none of that it ain't no I can't get to it no no no no no amen maybe the Prince of Persia might be trying to stop a blessing from coming your way but there's a blessing on the way I love this I love this see we don't we don't have no relationship with God where we just depend on a man a roadside assistance when we need it this is this is 24 7 coverage Psalms 34 7 says Angel Lord cometh round about them that fear Him and delivereth them and I just love the way brother Brandon makes a statement about that he says there uh he says people are not conscious of God says they're not conscious of God they don't remember what the Bible says that the angels of God are encamped about those who fear Him they don't only just come and visit them he said the Angels just don't come and visit says they stick their tents down do you realize wherever you go Angels already already at your disposal angels are a position around you they put their tents down that's residents the angels of God say they stick their tents down amen the angels of God are encamped about those who fear Him stay there day and night and on the time the only thing I need to activate my Angelic assistance prayer let's go and catch uh this third slide here from Spurgeon let me give you a little bit more it makes this common it says nothing bring such leanness into a man's Soul as a lack of Prayer nothing brings such leanness into a man's Soul as a lack of Prayer here's another one prayer is doubts Destroyer so if you're if you ever doubt in this and you're doubting that the best thing to do is go into prayer prayer is doubts Destroyer I love this word ruins remedy prayers ruins remedy prayer is the antidote to all anxieties here's another one all good is born in prayer and all good Springs from it another one continue in prayer and though the blessing Tarry it must come in God's Own time it must appear to you effectual firm prayer won't take no for an answer though it Terry it must come here's another one whether we like it or not asking is the rule of the Kingdom y'all got that one I told you sometimes I want my kids just to ask for it yeah God already know what you need but he still wants you to ask asking is the rule of the Kingdom here's another one anything is a blessing which makes us free if it cause you to pray oh Pastor you don't know this happened and that happened did you pray about it because it if it caused you to pray it was a blessing ain't got another one I would rather teach one man to pray then 10 men to preach I would rather teach one man to pray than 10 men to preach here's another one but if one neglects his closet then all evil comes of it another repeat but we need it says I believe that God hears your prayers because there's a secret work of the spirit going on within you teaching you to pray true prayers and approach of the Soul by the spirit of God to the throne of God and here's here's another one here pray until you can pray pray to be helped to pray and do not give up praying because you cannot pray because you know people say that I I'm not a prayer Warrior we all our prayer warriors all of us are and it's not how much you say don't get that don't think you got to say more than the next person it's just being sincere and you ain't look sometimes we pray expecting the people that's hearing us to be the answer to our prayer I'm not talking to you I'm talking to God and if somebody gonna criticize you for the high you pray just tell them I want talking to you foreign I wasn't even expecting you to even grant me no request I'm glad you heard it but I weren't talking to you amen Hallelujah glory to God pray until you can pray pray to be helped to pray and do not give up praying because you cannot pray ER here it is for it is when you think you cannot pray that is when you are praying when you think you cannot pray that's when God is listening now you find an internet to the channel y'all know what brother Brandon did on this first time praying he said he know what he was doing he said just took a little note and he wrote something down on a sheet of paper and he stuck it on a tree now just think about that I'm just going to take this note and I'm gonna put it on the tree I don't even know if God is out here or not I don't even know if God see my note I don't know nothing but they put it on the tree just in set sincerity and then in some kind of way just act out now if that was you would you come by and do this would you let the wind do that and God did it every time showing them that I'm here with you I can see what you wrote I can hear what you saying I can even hear what you thinking look I promise never to leave you nor forsake you now don't let it I got angels that are encamped around you in the woods then camped around you in your home the encountered in your car in school wherever you go angels are there and when you begin to pray you activate Angelic assistance brother I tell you what this ain't like a cell phone that sometimes you got connections sometimes you know and you're just struggling actually I got an important call to make it I can't get no signal not with not with prayer always got to sing father in the name of Jesus [Music] what a tool we have in our hands let me uh let me give you another quote here oh my my my my my well let me see I I got another quote that I want to be but it's gonna take us until something here I I I'm gonna have to say I got a whole bunch of them over here I got a whole bunch I'm just trying to figure out where to where to get out here uh I I say we need to quote I I get quote they're not finished off with just a small statements here from um Spurgeon Jairus a secret believer oh my driver's a secret believe look at this what the problem says get on out his little Hut oh Hezekiah turned over began to talk to the Lord said Lord I beseech thee to consider me but I walk before you with the perfect heart that's a great big word it isn't testimony like that I ha I have walked with a perfect heart and he needed 15 years more now the King was the highest figure Earthly speaking or politically speaking in the whole nation of Israel and the greatest man politically politically speaking was was talking to the King of Kings now um now it looks like the King of Kings would have had it would have had anything to say back to the king he would have spoke to him but it should prove that he was talking to him but God has ways and means of doing things his own way and instead of that he goes back out to the prophet and he says to the prophet now you go tell him I heard his prayer and I'm going to spare him 15 years now I don't read the scripture but he was talking about Hezekiah the prophet Isaiah come in and announce man you get your house in order you're gonna die and as he told Hezekiah it is Hezekiah just turned his face to the wall and it began to break and when he prayed God immediately heard Hezekiah and he gave an answer to the prophet as he was walking out of the Courts of the king God spoke just that fast back to the prophet Isaiah said now go back and tell him I heard his prayer and he gonna live again he gonna live 15 more years it don't take God long to answer a prayer if you're doing it the right way now when you read the story of Hezekiah maybe you should have went ahead and died right then because he got them 50 more years and he didn't live right before God it probably would have been best for him to just die right then amen Hallelujah God Knows Best right but so so here he says the prophet said it said to make sense that here he is the king and the highest uh political place and here he's talking to the King of Kings his God but God does not speak directly to amen Hezekiah he speaks through a prophet back to Hezekiah Hallelujah he says could you imagine the position that put Isaiah in here he comes right back through the gate again thus saith the Lord he's going to live right up to the soldiers thus said the Lord is going to live right into the celebrities thus said the Lord is going to live without imagining to say what kind of prophet is that what was the big difference prayer change from Death To Life amen it'll do it for every sinner here tonight amen from Death To Life it'll do it for every stick person tonight from sickness to health Prayer Changes Things So always bear that in mind pray without ceasing if you want to be an impediment to the meeting just don't pray I like what the prophet just said if you want to be an impediment oh my God if you want to be something that hurt the meeting if you want to be something that hurt the church if you want to be something that hurts your family don't pray don't pray it says just don't pray if you want to be the greatest help this meeting can this meeting can have it's not financially here is the greatest help you can be to this meeting set aside an hour or two every day that you pray for the meeting go out and visit someone if the Lord puts it on your heart and bring them into the meeting then pray that God will save them when they're in there if they're not safe heal them if they're sick and in need of healing pray for them say that's the greatest contribution that you can give to any meeting is to pray and seek God to help in this time of trouble greater than your finances we meet your prayers if I didn't have to give towards something I would just be praying God meet the need and then my prayer would just keep Rising God used me to meet the need God sent something my way so I can be a blessing I was just telling somebody I'm I'm out of time here I'm out of time uh I was just telling you know uh when when you look at Miracles there's two different groups involved in America I'm going back to the last thing on Spurgeon here just uh give me that last one there's two different groups involved in the miracle there is the group that stands by and watches the miracle happen and then there's another group or individual that actually is a partaker of the miracle and which group do you want to be because I'm gonna tell you nobody writes about the people that stood by and watch but we don't we only tell the stories of those that were the partakers I want to be a partaker in America I might not have it right now God but if I I might not be able to give finances I can sure give my prayer because Prayer Changes Things let me finish it with uh uh uh spurgeons these uh these last uh things from Spurgeon prayer is a creature's strength it's very breath and being prayer is not a hard requirement it is the natural duty of a creature to its creator the simplest homage that human need can pay to Divine liberality prayer is the Slender nerve look at this one the Slender nerve that moves of omnipotence prayer is the Slender nerve that moves the muscle up omnipotence the man who has his mouth full of arguments in prayer shall soon have his mouth full of benediction and answer to prayer the man who despite the teaching of scripture tries to pray without a savior insults the deity so you got to have the right Authentication you got to have the right credentials the ship of prayer may sail through all Temptations doubts and fears straight up to the throne of God I like this one prayer and praise are the oars by which a man May roll his boat into the deep Waters of the knowledge of Christ I know of no better thermometer to your spiritual temperature than this the measure of the intensity of your prayer effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man a woman a veileth much the Lord bless you that's great Lord how our spirits have been ministered to the depths of our soul we realize the power of this great weapon that took place in our hands the weapon of Prayer it's the tool that we use to communicate with them sometimes Lord Satan does all he can to get us to uh to not see the importance of the tool that we have but I thank you that you would take time to remind us of God that we could come to you uh in prayer asking anything we could speak to mountains and they would be casting to the Sea and not down the heart we can have what we say father I I trust the Lord that if there's anyone here that that's not in good standing with you they're not Christians Lord that they would come to a place of true repentance realizing on God that this is what gives them an access when they repent and they become uh Believers in you father and the sacrifice that you did at Calvary Lord this is what puts us back in connection with you we lost that connection in the Garden of Eden but it puts us back in connection with you once we repented now we have access to all of Heaven Lord let the Believers let the Believers realize Lord the this this this this great weapon greater than any atomic bomb on the Earth today this weapon of prayer is the thing that changes thing if prayer could change the mind of God and hezekiah's situation prayer can change anything let us realize what we have oh God I trust
