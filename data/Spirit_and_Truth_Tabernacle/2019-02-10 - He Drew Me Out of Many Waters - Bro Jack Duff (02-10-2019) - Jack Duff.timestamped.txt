[46:33] church I wanted to just encourage us as
[46:37] we are approaching this next week a man
[46:41] and our meetings won't encourage
[46:44] everyone just if you could just put a
[46:46] little time in prayer just ask to the
[46:48] Lord just to meet us here and if God
[46:51] gives you strength maybe you can just
[46:54] put a little time and fasting as well
[46:56] but we just want to see God and man move
[46:59] in the midst of his people we don't know
[47:01] who will walk through the doors we don't
[47:02] know what their needs are but we want
[47:05] God to meet them a man in this place so
[47:07] just a little time and fasting and
[47:10] prayer and I just believe God will honor
[47:12] that a man for someone on this week
[47:15] praise the Lord I'm gonna read a
[47:19] scripture and the Lord just kind of took
[47:23] me back this morning to a sermon that I
[47:27] preached some years ago and I every time
[47:30] I read this scripture just something
[47:32] just stir up in me and I say Lord I I
[47:36] can't get away from now I'm gonna spree
[47:38] chit a man since you started up again in
[47:41] me but let's turn to psalms 18
[47:43] everyone's standing that can stand the
[47:45] man Psalms 18 3 is the Lord
[47:49] I'll read roughly 12 or so verses
[47:53] actually I think I put about 22 but it
[47:57] should be over 16 start at verse 16 on
[48:00] that a man a man
[48:04] Risa's follow says he sent from above he
[48:09] took me he drew me out of many waters
[48:15] he delivered me from my strong enemy
[48:18] from and from them which hated me for
[48:22] they were too strong for me they
[48:25] prevented me in the day of my calamity
[48:27] but the Lord was my state see everything
[48:34] else is you know shaky around you but
[48:38] the Lord becomes a stain right he
[48:40] brought me forth also into a large place
[48:43] he delivered me because why he delivered
[48:51] me because he delighted in me man I love
[48:54] these words ain't not not because I
[48:57] didn't think good he delivered me
[48:59] because he delighted in me the Lord
[49:03] rewarded me according to my
[49:06] righteousness according to the cleanness
[49:09] of my hands hath he recommenced me for I
[49:14] have kept the ways of the Lord and have
[49:17] not wickedly departed from my god for
[49:20] all his judgments were before me and I
[49:23] did not put away his statutes from me
[49:27] I was also upright before him and I like
[49:31] this David said and I kept myself and I
[49:39] kept myself from from mine iniquity I
[49:41] had to say no to some stuff but because
[49:44] I said no God has brought me out into a
[49:46] wealthy place right therefore hath the
[49:50] Lord recompense me according to my
[49:53] righteousness according to the cleanness
[49:56] of my hands in his eyesight with the
[50:00] merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful
[50:03] with an upright man thou wilt show
[50:06] thyself upright with the pure thou wilt
[50:11] show thyself pure and with the froward
[50:14] thou wilt show thyself froward
[50:17] for thou will save the afflicted people
[50:20] but will bring down high looks and this
[50:23] is a
[50:25] I like this I want to hit this a little
[50:27] bit for thou will light my candle the
[50:31] Lord my God will enlighten my darkness
[50:34] for by V I have run through a truth and
[50:37] by my God have I leaped over a wall ask
[50:42] for God his way is perfect the word of
[50:45] the Lord has tried he is a buckler to
[50:48] all those that trust in him for who is
[50:52] God save the Lord I'll or who is a rock
[50:55] save our God it is God that girders me
[50:59] with strength and making my way perfect
[51:00] he maketh my feet like Hinds feet and
[51:03] setteth me upon my high places
[51:05] he teaches my hands to war so that a
[51:08] boar still is broken by my arms thou has
[51:10] also given me the shield of our
[51:12] salvation and our right hand hath
[51:14] holding me up and thy greatness hath
[51:17] made me great and this last verse thou
[51:20] has enlarged my steps under me that my
[51:23] feet did not slip what a wonderful
[51:31] wonderful testimony that David just
[51:34] writes here for us and every time I read
[51:37] it I just get encouraged and I get
[51:39] inspired and I just I love the word of
[51:41] the Lord I love the word of Lord let's
[51:44] just have a word of Prayer father we
[51:48] turn our attention towards your word
[51:51] thank you for what you've done this far
[51:53] and just a time of a portion various
[51:56] specials that have gone forward to
[51:57] strengthen and encourage our hearts we
[51:59] thank you for that
[52:00] the musicians Lord who surrendered their
[52:03] talents to you got to lead us of music
[52:06] we thank you for that God we realized
[52:08] that it's going to take the word to give
[52:10] us power overcome the enemy so do
[52:12] something for slaughter today and you
[52:14] were speaking God and the only way that
[52:18] you can this in Jesus name we pray amen
[52:21] amen god bless you you can be seated
[52:25] I want to a man use for our title he
[52:29] drew me out of many waters a man he drew
[52:33] me out of many waters and and I want to
[52:35] just use for a little inspirational
[52:37] today
[52:38] Sint took drew a man sent took drew a
[52:50] man just a little little tie in here as
[52:58] we prepare for our meeting so next
[53:00] weekend the Prophet speaks this in the
[53:04] message a hidden life in Christ just a
[53:06] couple comments before we get into our
[53:08] subject on the date says and believing
[53:11] after seeing America with this great
[53:13] opportunities it's had for revival and
[53:16] yet it continually gets worse so it
[53:20] alarms me this is my land and I was born
[53:25] here and I love it and I'm wanting to
[53:29] see a great revival in my day and I wish
[53:33] everybody felt the same way
[53:34] I'm warning to see a great revival in my
[53:38] day if we can and it makes this comment
[53:40] now I can't bring that great revival now
[53:44] with all the anointing that was on the
[53:47] Prophet he realized that by himself he
[53:49] could not bring the great revival right
[53:51] he says in no Minister can so we're not
[53:54] looking for a man your favorite preacher
[53:56] to come and bring the revival he spent
[53:58] but but we can put in our part while God
[54:01] brings hit a man church that's that's
[54:04] that's I think it's important that's why
[54:06] we actually a little faxed a little
[54:08] prayer because if we put in our part God
[54:10] will bring the revival amen we can put
[54:13] in our part while God brings it and each
[54:16] one of us has a part to play
[54:18] Amen I'm going on to another sermon here
[54:21] count along the same lines here in this
[54:24] message expectation he makes the comment
[54:26] says now a minister cannot bring a
[54:31] revival glory to God a minister cannot
[54:34] bring a revival
[54:35] there's no preacher can bring a revival
[54:38] he doesn't pack it with him and the only
[54:41] thing he can do is just be loyal to God
[54:44] and His Word and the revival has to come
[54:47] by the people
[54:50] and notice where it starts in your home
[54:53] right in your life glory to God
[54:57] now revival isn't adding new members to
[55:01] the church its reviving that what we've
[55:05] already got to revive means to bring
[55:09] back hallelujah
[55:11] so we're on the expectation that God
[55:13] gonna bring some things back oh yes Lord
[55:18] amen bring back that old-time Holy Ghost
[55:22] feelings Amen bring back that anointing
[55:26] that destroys yokes
[55:27] bring back that feeling that Amen are
[55:30] people people can't can't can't can't
[55:32] help but go hug they brother and hugged
[55:34] a sister and cry on their necks and do
[55:37] all kind of stuff like that because
[55:38] because a man where the devil try to put
[55:41] the vision God has restored bring back
[55:43] that type of feeling in the church bring
[55:46] back the love come on somebody Amen
[55:50] let's get rid of the way witness and
[55:52] bring back the love for God holy you
[55:55] bring back a man that did them good old
[55:58] days we want to be revived we want God
[56:01] to bring it back brother Branham goes on
[56:04] he starts in that same message I won't
[56:06] read at all
[56:08] you can maybe skip down to paragraph c7
[56:11] for me just for a little bit and take it
[56:13] down I'm just want to set this up but as
[56:15] brother Branham just talking about this
[56:17] this revival he said he was out on Lake
[56:20] Michigan and he was telling you know
[56:22] that when he was telling the church
[56:23] about this a man in Long Beach
[56:25] California said look I'm a landlocked
[56:27] citizen that meant where I'm at I don't
[56:30] see I don't see these big lakes and
[56:33] doing all this kind of stuff the ocean
[56:35] because of where he lived in Indiana
[56:36] they say I'm a landlocked citizen so so
[56:39] he said well you know things that that
[56:41] that may be coming to y'all it means a
[56:44] lot to me
[56:45] right he say so I come out he say he was
[56:47] there in Chicago on Lake Shore Drive and
[56:51] a man looking at Lake Michigan he say
[56:53] saw the water just kind of getting
[56:54] troubled a little bit Amen that's the
[56:56] water beginning to get a little choppy a
[56:58] little trouble and you know here just
[56:59] weren't saying I what make
[57:00] water do that hallelujah he say he say
[57:03] he said he say there's not anymore
[57:05] water add it to it it's the same water
[57:08] all the time you say but something just
[57:09] began to stir in the water so and
[57:11] sometimes the waters very peaceful and
[57:13] then the other times the water gets very
[57:15] choppy and they say just begin to take a
[57:17] little inspiration from it he began to
[57:19] watch that water just get a little I
[57:21] mean more and more choppy and just
[57:22] running up on the banks and running back
[57:24] out a wave come in a wave go out wait
[57:27] come back in but then he noticed
[57:29] something with those waves they say now
[57:30] when the water gets shopping like that a
[57:32] man the purpose of that is so that the
[57:35] ocean or the lake can actually get rid
[57:38] of its trash come on somebody Amen the
[57:42] purpose is so that that Lake can get rid
[57:45] of the trash that's in it a man so he
[57:47] say every time I wave a big wave would
[57:50] come the wave would be washing trash
[57:52] onto the shore and we are I'm the
[57:55] expectation for a wave of the Holy
[57:58] Spirit and when our wave of the Holy
[58:00] Spirit comes I'm expecting trash come on
[58:05] somebody I want to come after the
[58:07] meetings with my trashcan my spiritual
[58:13] trashcan and I want to get the trash out
[58:16] your life I want to get the trash out my
[58:19] life and we want to put the trash in the
[58:21] trash can hallelujah anything in our
[58:25] life that does not please God let it be
[58:29] washed onto the shore I'm an expectation
[58:34] is trash cleaning
[58:38] sometime we get lost in the things of
[58:41] the world but it's trash cleaning time
[58:44] I'm declaring that oh yeah Lord bring
[58:49] bring bring bring God to send that at
[58:51] that an order to that break the yoke of
[58:53] the enemy you know I was thinking myself
[58:55] I'm so glad folk come to church you
[58:57] don't know how happy I am when I see
[58:59] people come to church but there's only
[59:02] one thing that made me disappointed is
[59:04] when they come to church and they not
[59:05] change we just do my mama go to church
[59:19] so I go to church now then what we talk
[59:22] about it may we come here to get right
[59:24] with God
[59:25] I hate a man seeing people come here sit
[59:28] underneath this word and then leave here
[59:32] and do something against this word that
[59:34] [Music]
[59:36] just that just messed my spirit up can I
[59:40] be honest that's why I'm looking for the
[59:42] trash to get washed a man that the way
[59:45] that we think need to be wash the way
[59:48] that we act need to be wash some of the
[59:51] clothes we wear need to be washed up to
[59:53] the show I'm talk about I'm talking
[59:56] about an anointing that'll make you go
[59:59] home and clean out your closet that's a
[1:00:04] no I'm not talking to northing that just
[1:00:05] stay with you in the in here an
[1:00:07] anointing that will follow you home an
[1:00:09] anointing that would give you dreams and
[1:00:13] a anointing that will wake you up at
[1:00:16] night and an order to that will show you
[1:00:18] that you don't miss the rapture and
[1:00:20] it'll cause you to get in a hurry for
[1:00:22] God amen I'm talking on a norton that
[1:00:25] will shake you praise god that's what
[1:00:28] we're looking for that's what we're
[1:00:31] under expectation for see we had that
[1:00:34] anointing in my generation hey man I
[1:00:37] could talk to you about things that that
[1:00:39] I got cleaned up my life and my
[1:00:41] generation but I want to see the same
[1:00:42] God that helped clean me up start
[1:00:45] cleaning the fourth generation up
[1:00:47] come on somebody Ami's the same year
[1:00:50] today today forever if God can change me
[1:00:53] he can change you you just got to be in
[1:00:55] the right atmosphere because we stayed
[1:00:58] in the right atmosphere even when we
[1:01:01] didn't want to be changed God changed us
[1:01:03] anyway hallelujah if your mom and your
[1:01:06] daddy don't put you in the right
[1:01:08] atmosphere I'm expecting God to on earth
[1:01:10] every a meant honor their deeds
[1:01:13] hummina glory to God glory to God we
[1:01:17] will look watching for the trash to be
[1:01:19] washed up to the shore it wasn't adding
[1:01:22] new members but it's reviving the ones
[1:01:24] that we already had amen you did run
[1:01:28] well but who ended you hmm
[1:01:33] you used to be in a certain place with
[1:01:36] God but I asked the question who handed
[1:01:40] you we want the hindrances out the way a
[1:01:46] man if they not ante you let God take
[1:01:49] them from you can I say it again if they
[1:01:52] not add until you let God take them from
[1:01:54] you alright alright Amen so let me just
[1:02:00] look at this I just actually let me read
[1:02:03] a paragraph each seven on that a man
[1:02:06] it says saying well what it must be that
[1:02:10] the legs haven't revival that's might be
[1:02:13] what that must be what it is is having a
[1:02:15] big time just jumping up and down I
[1:02:17] thought that's good that's fine but you
[1:02:20] know I thought well wonder if it gets a
[1:02:21] lot of extra water when it's having a
[1:02:23] revival I thought no there isn't one
[1:02:25] drop more in it right now than if it was
[1:02:28] perfectly calm not one bit it's the same
[1:02:30] water but just having a revival jumping
[1:02:33] up and down I thought well that that
[1:02:37] that well what good does that do come to
[1:02:40] find out when it's having a revival
[1:02:42] jumping up and down like that and I'm
[1:02:44] expecting you know the Holy Spirit makes
[1:02:46] someone jump up and down right but when
[1:02:49] is jumping up and down it washes all the
[1:02:51] trash out glory washes all the trash
[1:02:54] fresh out of it up on the shore that's
[1:02:57] what the church needs is a revival get
[1:03:01] all the world and things of the world
[1:03:03] why
[1:03:03] out so it can look clear now look at
[1:03:08] that not only look clear but be pretty
[1:03:11] again you want your beauty restorer get
[1:03:14] rid of the stuff of the world hey man
[1:03:20] get rid of the stuff of the world amen
[1:03:22] if you want to be pretty good when it
[1:03:24] all comes down it got that it's got the
[1:03:26] same amount of water but what causes the
[1:03:30] seed to do that is because there's a
[1:03:32] wind come begins to blow against the
[1:03:34] waves blow against the body of water and
[1:03:37] pick it up well that's what the church
[1:03:38] needs amen tonight is a mighty rushing
[1:03:41] wind coming down the Punnett again and
[1:03:43] reviving it and getting all the world
[1:03:46] out and the things of the world out and
[1:03:48] and that way then it starts a revival
[1:03:51] and then when it settles down the
[1:03:52] churches and the church is all in a
[1:03:55] condition then to start off then to
[1:03:57] receive spiritual gifts and blessings of
[1:03:59] God that's what we want can the church
[1:04:03] say amen to that
[1:04:04] that's exactly what we're looking for so
[1:04:07] you know as we just prepare ourselves
[1:04:08] for what God is getting ready to doing
[1:04:10] this place amen my expectation is that
[1:04:12] true revival will strike and the revival
[1:04:15] would be the washing of the trash onto
[1:04:17] the shore that's what we're under
[1:04:20] expectation for now I want to talk about
[1:04:22] this a man actually I tell you what let
[1:04:26] me give me fees in church age and then
[1:04:28] I'll go back to a couple of things here
[1:04:30] that I want to hit this has just been a
[1:04:33] thing and we're still kind of riding
[1:04:36] this one quote we've been riding it for
[1:04:38] almost a year and and we brought it
[1:04:40] right into this this this upcoming
[1:04:42] meeting so that you'll understand if you
[1:04:44] hear the minister's preaching in a
[1:04:45] certain direction I gave them this
[1:04:47] quotient the Lord leads them down this
[1:04:48] path then we're gonna welcome that but
[1:04:51] but but this is what my expectation is
[1:04:53] this is what I'm looking for
[1:04:54] hallelujah glory to God look at this
[1:04:57] revelation 2 4 it says nevertheless I
[1:05:01] have somewhat against thee because thou
[1:05:03] has left thy first love and I this is
[1:05:06] what God is saying to the church I have
[1:05:07] somewhat against thee because thou has
[1:05:10] left I first love to understand this you
[1:05:13] must realize that the Spirit is not
[1:05:16] speaking
[1:05:17] - the original saints of ephesus alone
[1:05:19] so this is something for all of us right
[1:05:21] this message is to the entire age which
[1:05:24] lasted about a hundred and twenty years
[1:05:26] its message then is to all generations
[1:05:29] in that span now notice he says now
[1:05:32] history keeps repeating itself in the
[1:05:35] generation of Israel we see revival in
[1:05:38] one generation only to see the fires
[1:05:41] fading in the next in the third
[1:05:44] generation embers may be glowing
[1:05:47] slightly but in the fourth there be
[1:05:50] there may be no vestige which means no
[1:05:52] trace no vestige whatsoever of that
[1:05:56] original flame and that's a very very
[1:05:59] dark condition that's a very dark
[1:06:03] condition amen when it gets to that spot
[1:06:06] and you already know what the rest of
[1:06:08] the quote says but I want to inject the
[1:06:10] scripture keep it right there keep it
[1:06:12] quote there but I want to inject the
[1:06:14] scripture because we all know that we're
[1:06:16] seeing this darkness settle upon the
[1:06:19] people even in the message we have seen
[1:06:22] this darkness but when I was reading in
[1:06:24] Psalms 18 I got to verse 28 David said
[1:06:28] because David was in some dark spots and
[1:06:30] David said for thou will light my candle
[1:06:34] hallelujah the Lord God the Lord the
[1:06:37] Lord my God will enlighten my darkness
[1:06:41] so in this season since we've seen all
[1:06:44] the negative I'm expecting the positive
[1:06:46] and the positive on this negative is
[1:06:50] then God hallelujah
[1:06:54] and I said it I said it before my said
[1:06:56] we have enter into the season of thank
[1:07:01] God then God likes to fire again and why
[1:07:07] can't it happen in these meetings why
[1:07:10] can't we set the expectation for God to
[1:07:12] do that in these meetings we want to see
[1:07:15] the then God
[1:07:17] amen if the rest of the quotas happen
[1:07:20] what about the end of the quote the den
[1:07:23] kampf part then God likes to fire again
[1:07:26] Oh hallelujah and when he Lysa fire
[1:07:30] again II say the same process is
[1:07:32] repeated that means there if I would
[1:07:33] have happened in the first generation a
[1:07:35] man will be the same revival that are
[1:07:37] now happened in the fourth generation
[1:07:38] when God likes to fire again Oh
[1:07:41] hallelujah and the same process is
[1:07:43] repeated is simply the manifestation of
[1:07:46] the truth that God has no grandchildren
[1:07:48] salvation is not passed on by natural
[1:07:50] birth any more than there's any truth to
[1:07:52] the apostolic succession it isn't in the
[1:07:55] word you start out with a truly born
[1:07:57] again believers and when the next
[1:07:58] generation comes along they're no longer
[1:08:00] just plain Christians alright it keeps
[1:08:02] degrading but they but they have taken a
[1:08:05] denomination name and now and are now
[1:08:06] Baptist Methodist etc that is exactly
[1:08:09] what they are - they're not Christians
[1:08:10] you have to be born of the will of God
[1:08:13] not the will of man to be saved but
[1:08:15] these folks are all coming together now
[1:08:16] by the will of man and I don't say that
[1:08:19] some of them aren't right with God not
[1:08:20] for a minute not for a minute do I say
[1:08:22] that but the original fire has died down
[1:08:24] they're not the same anymore so we're
[1:08:27] looking for that original fire the then
[1:08:29] God sees them the original fire to come
[1:08:32] back into the church that fire cleanses
[1:08:34] us that fire purchases that fire gets
[1:08:37] rid of the things of the world you
[1:08:38] understand that right because when we I
[1:08:40] mean oftentimes have you see people walk
[1:08:43] away from this word the first thing
[1:08:44] creep into the things of the world it's
[1:08:47] the first thing that's that's an
[1:08:48] indicator that they needed then God
[1:08:50] experienced hallelujah
[1:08:52] I'm under expectation David said forth I
[1:08:55] will light my candle he says the Lord my
[1:08:59] God will enlighten my darkness and I was
[1:09:01] just thinking on that a candle is only
[1:09:04] needed when things get dark
[1:09:06] you need a candle in the middle of the
[1:09:08] day but when things get dark that's when
[1:09:10] you want the candle you got to have one
[1:09:13] around otherwise you can't you can't do
[1:09:15] anything you can't function without the
[1:09:18] adjust a little bit of light and when
[1:09:20] you light a candle it has a way of Amen
[1:09:23] I can I can turn off at night I can turn
[1:09:25] off all the lights in this building and
[1:09:28] sometime I've done
[1:09:30] sometimes in the middle of the day and
[1:09:31] all the lights off and I'm stumbling
[1:09:32] around glory to God right but if I had a
[1:09:35] candle hallelujah a candle actually
[1:09:39] illuminates the entire room a candle
[1:09:42] Amen allows me it takes a certain
[1:09:45] element of fear away from me right I'm
[1:09:49] no longer stumbling I know exactly where
[1:09:51] I'm placing my feet
[1:09:53] hey man sir I ain't gonna bump into a
[1:09:56] chair and hurt nothing right Amen I know
[1:09:58] where my feet are going because the
[1:09:59] candle Amen gives me light for direction
[1:10:02] hallelujah the candle Amen allows allows
[1:10:06] me to take another step of faith that
[1:10:09] the candle just just does so much for
[1:10:11] the purpose of the candle is to provide
[1:10:14] light amen and I want to see this I mean
[1:10:18] we had a God God lit a candle in this
[1:10:20] day Oh hallelujah I used to be stumbling
[1:10:24] around in darkness the darkness of
[1:10:27] denomination I went from the Baptist to
[1:10:30] the Pentecostal I'm headed somewhere
[1:10:33] Amen I went from the Baptist to the
[1:10:35] Pentecostal some of y'all was catholic
[1:10:37] some of y'all was Methodist
[1:10:38] some of y'all was all counted stuff some
[1:10:40] y'all came out of the world but God lit
[1:10:43] your candle gave you light that you can
[1:10:46] walk in the midst of the darkness things
[1:10:51] was darkness layer to see an age but God
[1:10:53] provided me a light listen and I want to
[1:10:56] tell the church this morning I'm walking
[1:10:58] in that light I'm walking in the light
[1:11:01] come where the dew drops of Mercy of
[1:11:03] rain shine all around us by day and by
[1:11:06] night Jesus the light of the world Moses
[1:11:10] walked in the light of his day
[1:11:13] Moses need his candle lit there was
[1:11:16] darkness in Egypt but where where that
[1:11:19] where that where the believers were in
[1:11:20] Goshen there was light they had their
[1:11:23] candles lit in their day come on
[1:11:26] somebody Noah had his candle lit in his
[1:11:29] teeth and-and-and-and with Noah having
[1:11:33] this candle in his day Moses having his
[1:11:35] candle in his day they could make
[1:11:37] preparation for the destruction that was
[1:11:40] coming in both of their days
[1:11:42] and man those in Moses day could put the
[1:11:45] blood on top of their doors and on the
[1:11:47] side because they were walking on the
[1:11:50] light hallelujah
[1:11:53] David didn't diss record these words for
[1:11:55] nothing God needs to Amen like
[1:11:58] somebody's candle if you've been
[1:12:01] stumbling and darkness no longer you
[1:12:03] have to do that God will light your
[1:12:05] candle if I if I if I have a candle and
[1:12:14] you have a candle
[1:12:16] if I get my lid you know what
[1:12:20] you ain't actually got to go through the
[1:12:22] process that I went through in order to
[1:12:27] get my lid I might have had to strike
[1:12:30] some rocks together I might have had to
[1:12:32] rub some wood together come on somebody
[1:12:36] I had to work to try to get this thing
[1:12:38] sparked so I can get my can in there and
[1:12:41] get it lit well when I get my lit you
[1:12:44] ain't got to go try to spark it you got
[1:12:47] to work that hard and anybody that ever
[1:12:55] worked that hard to get that candle lit
[1:12:58] amen they don't want to see their
[1:13:00] neighbor work that hard so what you
[1:13:02] doing your neighbor bring their candle
[1:13:03] you don't give them a rock you don't
[1:13:07] give them a would you just kill them
[1:13:09] your candle and when my candles lit it
[1:13:15] can light your candle and what your
[1:13:17] candles lit if you like the next person
[1:13:19] stand on hallelujah you need your candle
[1:13:23] lit and God will light your candle
[1:13:29] hallelujah see when we talk about your
[1:13:34] candle being lit I'm talking about you
[1:13:37] walking in the reveal word for your day
[1:13:40] that's what I'm talking about there's
[1:13:42] not a natural thing that we talk but I'm
[1:13:44] talking about you actually walking in
[1:13:46] the reveal word for your day that's the
[1:13:48] light for your day Moses had light for
[1:13:51] his day he had the revealed word for his
[1:13:53] day Noah had revealed word for his day
[1:13:56] God sent a revealed word for your day
[1:14:00] not only did he sit he took he drew he
[1:14:11] sent he took he true as David said in
[1:14:19] Psalms 1860 I mean bring that one out
[1:14:22] 1816 he said and I and I just want to
[1:14:25] refer back to it just for a little bit
[1:14:28] hallelujah he sent from above he took me
[1:14:37] he drew me out of many waters I want to
[1:14:41] just catch those words again instead
[1:14:42] every time I've read this the first time
[1:14:45] I first time I read and God inspired me
[1:14:47] to preach a sermon from it seemed like
[1:14:49] every time I go back to it I just think
[1:14:50] on it a little bit more he sent from
[1:14:52] above he took me drew me out of many
[1:14:57] waters but let me just I want to coast
[1:15:00] air a little bit I don't want to get too
[1:15:01] far ahead of myself so just bear with me
[1:15:03] this this scripture that we read of
[1:15:07] Psalms 18 is actually a man also
[1:15:09] recorded in 2nd Samuel 22 and I want to
[1:15:13] go back into this pool second Samuel 22
[1:15:15] verse 1 through 7 when I start reading
[1:15:18] this I'll be honest with you it's hard
[1:15:20] for me to stop reading it because I just
[1:15:23] began to just kind of reflect on what
[1:15:25] David is going through but here at the
[1:15:27] beginning of second Samuel 22 it gives
[1:15:29] us a little glimpse of what David is
[1:15:32] experiencing hallelujah look at this
[1:15:35] verse 1 says and David spake unto the
[1:15:38] Lord
[1:15:40] the words of this song so we mean when
[1:15:43] we when we really think about what I
[1:15:45] just read he said he took he drew a man
[1:15:49] this was a song this was a song that
[1:15:52] David was writing you know he was he was
[1:15:55] a musician so this was a song that he
[1:15:57] wrote and and the first time I preached
[1:16:00] this amen the song still had inspiration
[1:16:03] because from that song sister Burns
[1:16:06] wrote a song huh he wrote the song hee
[1:16:09] hee hee he drew me out of many waters so
[1:16:12] the so this word still has inspiration
[1:16:15] come on somebody
[1:16:17] it worked for David and it'll work for
[1:16:20] you but but but notice now he says this
[1:16:24] says in davis-bacon to the Lord the
[1:16:26] words of this song in the day that the
[1:16:29] Lord had delivered him out of the hand
[1:16:33] of all his enemies and out of the hand
[1:16:36] of Saul now I want you to get something
[1:16:39] about this the song could not be written
[1:16:43] until he went through something I want
[1:16:51] to tell you you can't write it and you
[1:16:54] can't tell it until you experience it
[1:16:59] hallelujah God use what David was going
[1:17:03] through in order to birth this song a
[1:17:05] man if God gives you the ability ability
[1:17:08] to write poems you can't write it and
[1:17:11] you can't tell it until you go through
[1:17:13] it come on somebody David wrote it after
[1:17:18] he went through it now let's look at
[1:17:20] what Dave is going through verse 2 says
[1:17:23] and he said the Lord is my rock and my
[1:17:27] fortress my deliverer now you gotta
[1:17:30] imagine davidís is in in caves
[1:17:33] David is hiding from Saul not only stay
[1:17:36] that hide him from Saul but he got other
[1:17:38] enemies on the other side a many enemies
[1:17:40] have him surrounded you know what I feel
[1:17:44] 9 it may look like
[1:17:49] it may look like I'm surrounded
[1:17:52] but I'm surrounded by you come on
[1:17:55] somebody
[1:17:56] hallelujah Fame it was gone through all
[1:17:59] these things but David begin to declare
[1:18:01] he says the Lord is my rock
[1:18:03] I mean God is my shelter God is my
[1:18:06] defense God is my everything the Lord is
[1:18:09] my rock and my fortress and my deliverer
[1:18:12] look at it the god of my rock in him
[1:18:15] will I trust it says he is my shield and
[1:18:19] the Horn of my salvation my heart our
[1:18:25] and my refuge he keeps on talking about
[1:18:29] it my Savior hallelujah I love it David
[1:18:32] just kept putting commas I got some
[1:18:35] motorcy buddy I got a little bit more to
[1:18:37] say about him and he just couldn't think
[1:18:39] of enough adjectives to describe his God
[1:18:43] can I read it again the God of my rock
[1:18:46] in him will I trust look he is my shield
[1:18:49] , and the Horn of my salvation he's just
[1:18:54] thinking about it you got to get on the
[1:18:56] scene you got to get the inspiration of
[1:18:59] the writer since they say I eat the
[1:19:05] whole of my salvation , my high tower
[1:19:09] cometh and my refuge comma Amen my
[1:19:14] Savior color now famous me from violence
[1:19:19] think about what he's going through
[1:19:21] because he was saved from having to do
[1:19:23] something to solve right
[1:19:25] I mean God say he say the same thing
[1:19:26] I'll save it around I would call on the
[1:19:28] Lord who is worthy to be praised
[1:19:31] so shall I be saved from my enemies when
[1:19:35] the ways of death compassed me the
[1:19:39] floods of ungodly men made me afraid
[1:19:42] look at it the sorrows of Hell compassed
[1:19:46] me about the snares of death prevented
[1:19:49] me and I love this in my distress I
[1:19:51] called upon the Lord and cried to my god
[1:19:56] and he did hear my voice out of his
[1:20:01] temple and my cry did enter into his
[1:20:05] ears I want you to know that God hear
[1:20:06] everything you're going through and he
[1:20:10] will respond to you the same way he
[1:20:11] responded to David see when you when you
[1:20:16] when David was writing a man this it was
[1:20:19] based on the experience that he was
[1:20:21] having there with Saul and also with
[1:20:22] some of the other enemies that he was he
[1:20:25] was he was fighting David had so much
[1:20:27] that he was going through he depended on
[1:20:28] God he depended on God and and I think
[1:20:31] Amen this whole chapter Amen not just
[1:20:36] the son cuz typically when you're
[1:20:37] writing a song and you're under the
[1:20:39] inspiration of writing a song you're
[1:20:40] writing it based on an experience that
[1:20:42] you just faced something that was really
[1:20:45] dear a man to you that's why a lot of
[1:20:48] times I like when songwriters actually a
[1:20:50] man present their songs I like to hear a
[1:20:52] testimony talk about how the song came
[1:20:54] to you tell us a little bit about that
[1:20:57] because that song is actually written
[1:20:58] from an experience hallelujah Amen and
[1:21:03] if you have you've had it if you've ever
[1:21:04] written a song and you wrote from your
[1:21:06] experience then oftentimes you can
[1:21:08] minister to other people from the things
[1:21:10] that you went through God allowed that
[1:21:13] song to be birthed for a reason
[1:21:14] oh come on somebody well David is
[1:21:17] writing this what I see in his mind this
[1:21:20] is a reflection of what God has already
[1:21:22] brought him through I stay with me here
[1:21:24] because I why this way I get to sent
[1:21:27] took drew he say he he sent from above
[1:21:31] let's read it again
[1:21:32] Psalms 1816 he sent from above he took
[1:21:38] me he drew me out of many waters some
[1:21:43] time you got to stop and just think
[1:21:44] about it he sent from above he took me
[1:21:49] he drew me out of many waters now now
[1:21:54] when I looked at that a man Sint took
[1:21:59] and drew were all past tense there's not
[1:22:06] where he gonna do
[1:22:11] this thing is already done so sorry if
[1:22:15] he sit and he took any truth oh my god
[1:22:19] this thing was already pre-planned for
[1:22:21] ordained before I got to the situation's
[1:22:24] can I just give you a little definition
[1:22:27] of this sent Amen I went just looked it
[1:22:30] up a little bit and it says sent means
[1:22:33] to cause to go or be taken to a
[1:22:37] particular destination it's the arranged
[1:22:40] for the delivery of hallelujah and I say
[1:22:44] especially by mail so I don't know if
[1:22:49] you've ever been in a situation where
[1:22:51] you ordered something from somebody and
[1:22:54] as you were ordering this package it was
[1:22:57] very important some of y'all maybe have
[1:22:59] something that you're waiting on a man
[1:23:01] for the banquet
[1:23:02] hallelujah can I talk to you just a
[1:23:05] little bit if you ordered it online
[1:23:08] Amazon got your package and you know
[1:23:12] that you've paid for it and if it hasn't
[1:23:16] arrived by the time that you expected it
[1:23:18] to arrive then you begin to make
[1:23:20] telephone calls hallelujah Amen and
[1:23:24] those telephone calls have a little
[1:23:25] pressure on them because you want to
[1:23:28] understand what doesn't happen to your
[1:23:30] package you're not calling the
[1:23:32] representative just to say hi y'all go
[1:23:36] talk to me today
[1:23:37] you're not calling just to say hi but
[1:23:39] you have a request I need to know what
[1:23:42] happened to my package I paid for it and
[1:23:45] this is my business is my receipt I can
[1:23:48] tell you that David I pay for I can tell
[1:23:50] you exactly how much it cost so you
[1:23:51] begin the question where is the package
[1:23:55] and if you were the only other if you
[1:23:57] are on the other end taking the phone
[1:23:59] call there's one way to diffuse amen the
[1:24:03] other person that's irate on the other
[1:24:05] end and the way it diffuses them is that
[1:24:08] you tell them what the tracking number
[1:24:09] is because if you can give them a
[1:24:12] tracking number that shows that the
[1:24:14] package is not being boxed that shows
[1:24:17] you that the package is not sitting on
[1:24:19] the shelf
[1:24:20] but that shows you
[1:24:21] that tells him the tracking number says
[1:24:23] that the package has already been sick
[1:24:27] and if it's been sick then I can track
[1:24:31] it through UPS I can track it through
[1:24:33] FedEx I can get encouraged when I know
[1:24:36] that the thing has been sick because any
[1:24:39] day night any day now this dangled
[1:24:45] arrival my toaster can I tell you
[1:24:48] something you don't praying about it and
[1:24:50] God has responded to you this morning
[1:24:52] that thing they've already been sick
[1:24:56] you've been praying about your son you
[1:24:59] can play about your Torah even praying
[1:25:02] that that bill to get paid it's already
[1:25:04] been sick
[1:25:05] I mean to somebody when you find out
[1:25:10] that something has been said it changes
[1:25:12] joy expectations hallelujah Amen I ain't
[1:25:18] wait for them to get this thing packaged
[1:25:20] up it's already been sent
[1:25:22] I thought about David when he said these
[1:25:28] words why would David use the words he
[1:25:31] said from above you wanna know why David
[1:25:38] can use words like this because David
[1:25:41] remembered a time in his life you know
[1:25:44] I'm talked about before he received his
[1:25:46] anointed I'm talked about before he
[1:25:53] received his anointed David was in the
[1:25:57] field watching God had already rejected
[1:26:04] Saul as his king you know with me he had
[1:26:07] already rejected Saul's key and then he
[1:26:09] told Saul he told Samy say just stop
[1:26:12] stop even mourning over song he said I
[1:26:14] already raised me up another King and
[1:26:17] he's in the house of Jesse y'all stay
[1:26:19] with me now
[1:26:20] he said he's already in the house of
[1:26:23] Jesse and he said he said now what you
[1:26:25] just take your horn of oil now I
[1:26:27] remember brother Kerry I'm told us if
[1:26:30] it's a horn or that meant something had
[1:26:32] to die in order to get a whole
[1:26:35] of oil some Ram had to die in order to
[1:26:38] get this anointing hello Jesus had to
[1:26:41] die in order for you to get this type of
[1:26:44] anointing you to get this some of y'all
[1:26:48] something had to die to give you this so
[1:26:51] here comes his horn of oil and it takes
[1:26:54] it down there to test his Houston and
[1:26:56] Jessica get an axe not now not did you
[1:26:58] come in peace did you cover me so yeah
[1:26:59] yeah yeah I come in peace you said we're
[1:27:01] gonna have a sacrifice here today but
[1:27:03] but the Lord told me to do something
[1:27:04] right with you in your house God has a
[1:27:06] king in your house I want you to stay
[1:27:09] with me you say said King he said yeah
[1:27:11] the next king is living in one of your
[1:27:12] boys gonna be the next without a prophet
[1:27:14] didn't know which one the Prophet
[1:27:16] thought it was the first one that came
[1:27:18] into his presence like he liked this guy
[1:27:20] to be him look at how he stands he
[1:27:21] dresses like a king he looks like a God
[1:27:23] said no no don't look on this outward
[1:27:25] but look at I'm looking at the heart
[1:27:28] hallelujah
[1:27:30] and when you read the scripture amen
[1:27:33] when when the oil did not pour out on
[1:27:35] the oldest boy they did a pour it out on
[1:27:37] the second-oldest the Bible said that
[1:27:39] seven sons passed before the prophet
[1:27:42] I'll stay with me seven sons passed
[1:27:45] before the Prophet but here comes the
[1:27:48] eighth boy not even considered that he
[1:27:52] could be a king he is sitting in the
[1:27:54] field but God had already sent a prophet
[1:27:58] to his house the man did not even know
[1:28:01] he was a king in the field but God had
[1:28:05] already said he's not benefit
[1:28:07] identification to the house the package
[1:28:10] was in the house before David got there
[1:28:14] [Applause]
[1:28:17] the anak team was waiting on David huh
[1:28:21] hey man you think you waiting on God God
[1:28:24] is actually waiting on you God is
[1:28:32] waiting on you all God needs you to do
[1:28:35] is show up come out the field come out
[1:28:38] of whatever it is that you go through
[1:28:40] come o to the house I got something for
[1:28:43] you
[1:28:44] when win-win-win-win up with the
[1:28:47] prophets and we know that that is
[1:28:50] David's father nor his brothers even
[1:28:51] thought of him because the Prophet had
[1:28:54] to ask a question do you have any other
[1:28:56] boys so yeah I got one more he's out
[1:28:58] there he got the lowest job announced
[1:29:00] he's watching sheep and when he said go
[1:29:02] get him cuz we're not gonna eat till you
[1:29:03] bring him here and when they brought
[1:29:04] David into the house to God God told him
[1:29:07] if something struck the prophet God's
[1:29:08] saying I get up this is him this is the
[1:29:11] one and they had come to oil just
[1:29:14] seeping all out of the horn on to David
[1:29:16] his family saw him anointed they knew he
[1:29:19] was the king but David can write these
[1:29:24] words that he sent from above
[1:29:26] now I had I had to piggyback off of that
[1:29:30] while David was in the field watching
[1:29:32] sheep God sent a prophet to the north
[1:29:35] the next king while I was in sin I
[1:29:39] didn't know it but God had already sent
[1:29:42] His only begotten Son to die in my stead
[1:29:45] huh
[1:29:46] none of that while I was in
[1:29:48] denominations I had no idea even before
[1:29:52] I was born before I was born God had
[1:29:56] already sent a prophet
[1:30:01] [Music]
[1:30:02] hallelujah the package was waiting on me
[1:30:09] they had to come at a that I will walk
[1:30:12] in and and hear my name being called huh
[1:30:16] but the package was already sick I
[1:30:19] didn't have to go to heaven and wonder
[1:30:22] when the package was going to get here
[1:30:24] it had already been sent what you need
[1:30:27] to do is just track it and you went from
[1:30:31] denomination to denomination what she
[1:30:33] was doing you were tracking it
[1:30:42] hallelujah and when you got here to stop
[1:30:45] when you see my wife stop there no more
[1:30:52] tracking I got the package and I let's
[1:30:55] look at this look at this while I was in
[1:30:57] my denomination that I didn't know God
[1:30:58] sent me a prophet while we were in the
[1:31:01] world we didn't know God sent us a
[1:31:02] prophet but this thing was already sick
[1:31:05] he sent from above he sent from above
[1:31:10] sin it's past tense that mean the thing
[1:31:13] already happened oh my god my god I hope
[1:31:16] that don't go about head neither did he
[1:31:20] send it the scripture says that he took
[1:31:24] me he took me
[1:31:29] and I looked at the definition of this
[1:31:32] it's uh it means to lay hold of
[1:31:35] something with one's hands reach for and
[1:31:38] hold reach for and hold he took me and
[1:31:44] and when this came to me I just I
[1:31:47] thought about you Joseph and I wanted to
[1:31:50] use you for an example you know mind
[1:31:52] just stand here with me Pam right here
[1:31:53] with me
[1:31:54] he took me means I he reached out for
[1:31:56] his hand so let me hold your hand the
[1:31:58] other hand he reached out and he took me
[1:32:10] [Music]
[1:32:15] see secret Joseph was just sitting here
[1:32:18] minding his own business but but I came
[1:32:23] down from the pulpit and I reached out
[1:32:27] and I grabbed his hand and I so where I
[1:32:36] go he go when I stopped he took me
[1:32:42] when I was laying in sin you know what
[1:32:45] he did when I was in denomination when I
[1:32:51] didn't know which way I was going to go
[1:32:53] he came down and he he took me he took
[1:32:59] me he took me I didn't take myself but
[1:33:04] he reach down his hand and he took me I
[1:33:09] [Applause]
[1:33:18] didn't even know what I was looking for
[1:33:21] but God allowed certain situations to
[1:33:24] happen in the church God allowed certain
[1:33:27] things are happening in the world may be
[1:33:30] a relationship went bad but in the midst
[1:33:33] of that God was reaching down his hand
[1:33:35] so he could take you he knew exactly
[1:33:38] where he wanted you to go
[1:33:40] [Applause]
[1:33:46] David could say I was in the field
[1:33:49] watching over my daddy sheet playing my
[1:33:52] instrument but he sent a prophet to my
[1:33:55] house and when it when it said the
[1:33:58] Prophet to my house
[1:33:59] then the Prophet took me and anointed me
[1:34:03] with oil and something had to die for me
[1:34:06] to get this anointed but he took me and
[1:34:10] all the people that he could have had
[1:34:12] all my brothers and all my family
[1:34:18] members and all the church people that I
[1:34:22] was going to church with he took me took
[1:34:36] drew this is past tense and sometimes
[1:34:42] you didn't realize that he it took you
[1:34:44] he took you out of harm's way you should
[1:34:50] have been dead and gone but he took you
[1:34:54] somehow he was there protecting the
[1:34:57] shield in you when you didn't even
[1:34:58] realize and even didn't have sense
[1:35:00] enough to stop and say thank you but he
[1:35:06] took you David David when facing Goliath
[1:35:18] could remember where God had took him
[1:35:19] from and I want to read this out of
[1:35:23] works its faith Express says David was a
[1:35:26] with the Shepherd's sling expressed to
[1:35:31] the whole Israelite army the faith that
[1:35:32] he had in their God
[1:35:35] now there was Goliath on the other side
[1:35:37] and he stood out there and made his
[1:35:39] boast many times bigger than David he
[1:35:41] had fingers 14 inches long and he was a
[1:35:44] mammoth big fellow the Philistine giant
[1:35:46] and here was David the smallest one he
[1:35:50] was even too little to be in the army
[1:35:52] too much of a runt they couldn't use him
[1:35:55] so his brothers was out there the army
[1:35:56] and then Goliath was making his boast
[1:35:58] but David now remember it was revealed
[1:36:01] to David he thought here is the armies
[1:36:03] of the Living God standing in their own
[1:36:05] land and there's a boasting
[1:36:07] uncircumcised philistine out there
[1:36:09] we'll call him cancer we'll call him
[1:36:12] paralytic why David was no kind of match
[1:36:15] for him not with any kind of a weapon he
[1:36:18] was no match that man shoulders was
[1:36:20] probably 10 12 foot across he was
[1:36:22] probably standing 14 15 foot high a
[1:36:25] spear like a weavers needle probably 20
[1:36:27] foot long the blade on it maybe four
[1:36:30] foot across and little David standing
[1:36:32] there in a little piece of leather goat
[1:36:34] skin or sheepskin with two pieces of
[1:36:36] string tied to it see this just this
[1:36:39] just goes to show us God always work in
[1:36:41] small things
[1:36:44] but it's revealed to him revelation
[1:36:47] struck him amen he said the god that
[1:36:49] took me out of the paws of the bear that
[1:36:55] took me out of the paws of the lion how
[1:36:58] much more will he deliver that
[1:37:00] uncircumcised philistine in my hand you
[1:37:03] gotta think back of what God has already
[1:37:05] brought you out of what he's already
[1:37:07] took you from and if he did it before he
[1:37:11] will do it again
[1:37:13] his brother's way more able to do it so
[1:37:16] head and shoulders above his army but
[1:37:18] you see it wasn't revealed to them amen
[1:37:20] there it is they believed it could be
[1:37:22] done they believe that God could do it
[1:37:24] but it wasn't revealed to them but it
[1:37:27] was revealed to David so there's the
[1:37:28] difference right there if it's
[1:37:30] absolutely revealed to you that God is
[1:37:31] going to heal you you're going to get it
[1:37:34] see this can't be intellect it's got to
[1:37:37] be a real revelation you're going to get
[1:37:40] it I don't care what's wrong with you
[1:37:41] with what's the odds that maybe worse
[1:37:43] than David and Goliath but if it's
[1:37:45] revealed to you so yeah I mean you know
[1:37:47] oftentimes I want it I want to say this
[1:37:49] the church I remember other Troy making
[1:37:52] a comment a few weeks always say what's
[1:37:55] 1+1 you say 2 and he said who told you
[1:37:59] that they say I just figured out no you
[1:38:01] didn't somebody had to teach you what
[1:38:04] 1+1 was so through your intellect you
[1:38:07] understand what 1+1 is what 2+2 is and
[1:38:10] they even give you a little little
[1:38:12] shapes and stuff right and say now
[1:38:14] here's one little shape here's another
[1:38:16] little shape one plus one equal what now
[1:38:18] you got two shapes they give you all
[1:38:19] kind of stuff to drill that into your
[1:38:21] mind hallelujah and sometimes spiritual
[1:38:24] if you're not careful you can come to
[1:38:25] church you can hear me quote the Prophet
[1:38:27] you can you can you can Amen you can
[1:38:31] have faith and what you're seeing God do
[1:38:33] for other people but not necessarily
[1:38:35] have faith for yourself intellectually
[1:38:38] you know what God did for Abraham
[1:38:40] intellectually you know what God did for
[1:38:42] Noah intellectually you know what God
[1:38:45] did for most you can read that and
[1:38:46] intellectually get that and you can
[1:38:48] explain it because you read it in the
[1:38:49] Bible but do you have faith to believe
[1:38:52] that the same God can do it for you has
[1:38:55] he the same way
[1:38:57] he revealed to Abraham that he was going
[1:38:59] to have a child huh when all the odds
[1:39:02] was against him has he revealed it to
[1:39:04] you because once he reveals it to you
[1:39:07] come on somebody then you were active
[1:39:10] Abraham acted when he reveals to you
[1:39:13] like you revealed to Mary that she was
[1:39:16] going to have a Christ amen the child
[1:39:18] Christ then you begin to act like Mary
[1:39:20] acted hallelujah somebody Mary begin to
[1:39:25] testify see when they become your
[1:39:30] revelation you begin to testify about it
[1:39:33] can I say that again wouldn't become
[1:39:35] your revelation you begin to testify
[1:39:37] about it and you testify before it
[1:39:40] happened
[1:39:41] otherwise you're still walking in fear
[1:39:43] you need God to light your candle all
[1:39:48] right Church glory to God it's just got
[1:39:51] this thing got to be real it's got to be
[1:39:52] a river of Revelation whatever whatever
[1:39:54] you might be going through God is able a
[1:39:57] man to take care of that situation let
[1:40:00] me look at this one other thing that I
[1:40:02] want to I want to bring out here a man
[1:40:04] the the final where he sent from above
[1:40:07] and when I when I think about that God
[1:40:10] sent a prophet to David's house God sent
[1:40:13] a property in your day and you didn't
[1:40:15] even know I wasn't even born before the
[1:40:18] Prophet diet
[1:40:19] hallelujah can you think about that I
[1:40:21] wasn't even born before the Prophet diet
[1:40:24] but what but when I realized in the word
[1:40:26] that God had already sent it all I had
[1:40:28] to do is track it that's all I had to do
[1:40:34] is track it and you don't realize it but
[1:40:36] you don't you don't track right to where
[1:40:38] the packages
[1:40:42] and you rather thought you just stumbled
[1:40:44] in here no he said he took and then
[1:40:49] after that he drew yeah and yeah and
[1:40:52] this is this is this is good because
[1:40:53] when we talk about being drawn out of
[1:40:56] many waters just ajust just by using the
[1:40:59] terminology many waters I have to you
[1:41:02] know just look at the scripture let me
[1:41:04] I think it's revelation 1715 let me just
[1:41:06] grab that real quick hallelujah glory to
[1:41:11] God glory to God
[1:41:13] a man a man yes yes revelation 1715
[1:41:17] glory to God when I when I think about
[1:41:19] being drawn out of many waters I reflect
[1:41:22] on this scripture and he said unto me
[1:41:24] the waters which thou sawest where the
[1:41:27] sitteth are people's and
[1:41:30] multitudes and nations and tongues so so
[1:41:34] to be drawn out of many waters I was
[1:41:37] drawn from amongst many people right
[1:41:39] amen there was a you know when I look
[1:41:41] back in my own life and I and I just I
[1:41:43] just think about man I was the
[1:41:45] denomination's that I went to in the
[1:41:47] churches that I that I fellowship with
[1:41:48] and all of that they I did all that and
[1:41:50] there was I had a lot of friends that
[1:41:52] was there but when God lit my candle
[1:41:55] when God began to reveal his word to me
[1:41:58] and I began to see more things in the
[1:42:00] scripture hallelujah I wanna I want to
[1:42:03] make sure we get that I begin to see a
[1:42:04] little bit more in the scripture
[1:42:06] hallelujah I begin to realize none is
[1:42:09] more ten instant than than just dang in
[1:42:11] the Lions Den it's more to this than
[1:42:13] just what happened on the ark I mean I
[1:42:16] can actually I can start preaching from
[1:42:18] the book of Revelation now I gotta be in
[1:42:21] church for 40 years and afraid to read
[1:42:23] the book of Revelation huh amen
[1:42:26] I understand what these things are
[1:42:28] because God has sent God has took and
[1:42:31] now God has true me out Oh glory to God
[1:42:35] and then God had purpose for bringing me
[1:42:38] to this light remember I want to go back
[1:42:40] and say something now remember there
[1:42:41] were seven boys that passed through the
[1:42:45] Prophet David would have been the eighth
[1:42:48] son eight is a powerful number
[1:42:53] yes eight actually represents two things
[1:42:55] eight represents the number of new
[1:42:58] beginning but also eight and is made of
[1:43:02] two circles and a circle represents
[1:43:05] eternity it has no beginning nor does it
[1:43:09] have an ending and eight is two circles
[1:43:12] Amen representing eternity hallelujah
[1:43:16] and then so David being not a 'the the
[1:43:19] other seven brothers would have actually
[1:43:22] represented seven Church ages but David
[1:43:28] was the eighth oh my god
[1:43:31] i'ma just say it and then I read a quote
[1:43:33] Amen that that'll give us a little help
[1:43:35] but and it's not a it's not a new age
[1:43:38] Amen it's not a new age just not when
[1:43:40] outside the Bible it's just
[1:43:42] understanding that we're not led to
[1:43:43] seeing let us see is I blind miserable
[1:43:48] poor Ritchie naked that is not your
[1:43:52] condition therefore you must be
[1:43:54] somewhere else and the Prophet put you
[1:43:57] there he sit from above and the Prophet
[1:44:01] put you somewhere else the Prophet puts
[1:44:04] you in the bride age and the bride age
[1:44:07] is an eternal age Oh glory to God all
[1:44:13] right all right let me just read up
[1:44:16] maybe a little something on that if I
[1:44:18] can let's see if I got this there was I
[1:44:22] had a look quote that I want to just
[1:44:24] bring in and then we'll um I'll uh oh
[1:44:27] I'm so glad he sent this is that I've
[1:44:31] heard but now I see let me just bring in
[1:44:33] this quote denial I'll finish up this he
[1:44:35] drew he drew me he drew me he drew me
[1:44:37] drew me out of many waters I could have
[1:44:39] still been stuck in some of them
[1:44:40] churches but God drew me out glory be to
[1:44:43] God glory to God look you say that that
[1:44:45] critic saying why would why would a God
[1:44:48] of mercy could open up the Red Sea stand
[1:44:51] and let them poor Christians eat up with
[1:44:54] a be eat up with lions and burnt and
[1:44:56] everything set up just like he laughed
[1:44:58] about it the poor ignorant did he didn't
[1:45:01] did he not know except a corn of wheat
[1:45:03] fall into the ground it had to die
[1:45:06] through those dark ages like any other
[1:45:08] corner wheat has the go beneath the
[1:45:10] earth and be buried to bring forth in
[1:45:12] the first Reformation them to blaze of
[1:45:15] Luther the stock it had to come forth in
[1:45:18] the Westlands out yonder to bring forth
[1:45:20] to pollen the taxes the great missionary
[1:45:23] age had to come forth in the Pentecostal
[1:45:26] for the restoration of the gifts so God
[1:45:30] was dealing with the Lutheran's God was
[1:45:32] dealing with the Westlands God was
[1:45:34] dealing with the Pentecostals but now
[1:45:35] God has moved on I mean if anybody in
[1:45:38] here to know anything about growing up
[1:45:41] in a constant you know the church left
[1:45:43] the word you know they did ain't no way
[1:45:46] I mean there are things that that they
[1:45:48] do today would have never been done when
[1:45:51] I was a little boy it would have never
[1:45:53] happened in the church never you coming
[1:45:59] in with your miniskirt if you want to
[1:46:00] you will have a sister with a sheep
[1:46:05] y'all don't know nothing about that you
[1:46:09] can dress that way in there huh yeah I
[1:46:14] mean I you can and I see the Baptist I
[1:46:17] mean I was Baptist baptized they did
[1:46:19] anything see back in back in my I'm they
[1:46:21] talked about back in my day they had
[1:46:23] homosexual cry leaders so when yet when
[1:46:27] you went to choir so your mama had to go
[1:46:28] with you you thought you thought you
[1:46:32] thought lecture mom was just giving you
[1:46:35] a ride because you couldn't Drive
[1:46:37] now your mama was watching the cry
[1:46:40] director anytime that crowd ready to get
[1:46:43] a look too close to their child they're
[1:46:45] right there on talk to me it's the truth
[1:46:52] in in hi-c I'm a senior in the Baptist
[1:46:55] Church because they had to pay for the
[1:46:57] musicians hello because they had to
[1:47:01] paint they put anything up you have a
[1:47:04] gay fellow up there playing and he J and
[1:47:07] he just finished sin and his partner
[1:47:09] sitting right next to him in the church
[1:47:12] huh
[1:47:14] Oh God and then it got worse y'all y'all
[1:47:16] don't believe y'all probably ain't gonna
[1:47:18] believe this
[1:47:18] yeah y'all gonna believe this it got so
[1:47:21] bad and the reason that they couldn't
[1:47:22] get rid of them because they found out
[1:47:24] later on that is a couple people in the
[1:47:27] church have a relationship with this guy
[1:47:30] y'all don't believe that do you
[1:47:32] pastor get caught deacons get caught
[1:47:36] everybody living in sin in the Baptist
[1:47:38] Church and still going to church gotta
[1:47:40] and nothing like that don't you put God
[1:47:46] and nothing like that God ain't in it
[1:47:47] they got a form of godliness but denying
[1:47:49] the power thereof and that's why I can
[1:47:51] say he sent took drew me out of many
[1:47:57] waters and right now he's sendin taken
[1:48:03] and drawing out you just don't realize
[1:48:10] the packages is on the way to your house
[1:48:12] glory to God when you turn on the radio
[1:48:15] it's a package coming sent took drew
[1:48:23] this quote I was reading here he had to
[1:48:30] come forth in a Pentecostal for the
[1:48:31] restoration of gifts almost to the see
[1:48:33] the very lected cuz see you know we
[1:48:35] everybody is so in love with the gifts
[1:48:36] we and that's something I just love God
[1:48:38] I enjoy seeing gifts and operation but I
[1:48:41] don't think gifts should control the
[1:48:43] church
[1:48:44] I think the Word of God should control
[1:48:46] the church I mean I got Pete and let me
[1:48:49] tell you that everybody will not speak
[1:48:50] in tongues
[1:48:51] that's not everybody's gift look in the
[1:48:54] body just look at your body if all your
[1:48:57] body was a tone what part of the body
[1:49:00] would be able to pick up something
[1:49:02] what about it part about it would be
[1:49:04] able to allow you to walk see you need
[1:49:06] feet in the body a true a good body I'm
[1:49:09] talk about not one that's deform it
[1:49:11] can't all be a tongue
[1:49:14] it can't all be a tongue right we need
[1:49:17] some eyes somebody with some wisdom huh
[1:49:22] we need somebody with some knowledge
[1:49:24] right amen
[1:49:26] we need somebody am i touching somebody
[1:49:28] that got healing flowing through huh we
[1:49:31] need hands we need feet and also another
[1:49:34] thing about the body do you need some
[1:49:36] things that can't be seen you need a
[1:49:43] liver you need a heart glory to God you
[1:49:48] need things on the inside working
[1:49:50] otherwise the outside will do you no
[1:49:52] good so we want the whole body that God
[1:49:56] got allowed for the church not just a
[1:49:58] tongue part we want all of it but I want
[1:50:03] you to understand we've become to come
[1:50:06] through a you know just maybe through
[1:50:10] church where people have put a putting
[1:50:13] the other parts of the body out so you
[1:50:15] got one that won't only turn someone
[1:50:16] that don't want no tongue we want it all
[1:50:20] but everybody ain't gonna be a tongue
[1:50:22] Paul said it Paul said it it's in the
[1:50:26] Bible
[1:50:27] I think got time to read it but you can
[1:50:28] go back and read in Corinthians with
[1:50:30] Paul said it so so church we you know
[1:50:32] this justice this thing here he said the
[1:50:34] great missionary age this quote says had
[1:50:37] to come forth in the Pentecostal for the
[1:50:38] restoration of the gifts almost to
[1:50:41] deceive the very elect looks like what
[1:50:43] looks like a wheat grain open it up
[1:50:45] there's no wheat there at all so with
[1:50:48] all that speaking in tongues all that
[1:50:50] shouting and you Kirsten so out of the
[1:50:55] same mouth you blessing curse that's not
[1:50:59] what I want a man hallelujah and go eat
[1:51:03] go on a little for at least say I know
[1:51:06] there's there's there's no weed at all
[1:51:07] it's only shuck but back in there then
[1:51:11] they begin to form the one oneness
[1:51:13] organization the training organization
[1:51:14] the to destroy colleges and the Church
[1:51:16] of God organization all organizing just
[1:51:18] death exactly now what happens but it's
[1:51:21] a shelter for the weak so your
[1:51:23] experience inside those churches was a
[1:51:26] shelter to
[1:51:27] I got you here to tell you what he sent
[1:51:30] and then he show you where he took you
[1:51:32] from and why he drew you out of many
[1:51:35] ones look at it let's go on he says
[1:51:38] unless he says and now now what happens
[1:51:41] but it's a shelter for the weak it's
[1:51:43] been growing through it all the time now
[1:51:45] it's beginning to pull away the weeks
[1:51:47] begin to be seen this is not a
[1:51:50] Pentecostal age this is the latter date
[1:51:54] age this is the bride age this is the
[1:51:59] evening light this is when Malachi 4
[1:52:02] must be fulfilled to follow God's
[1:52:05] pattern this is Luke 17 30 to be
[1:52:09] fulfilled this is they make says in
[1:52:11] Jeremiah and the rest of them that joy
[1:52:13] has spoke of these days this is that day
[1:52:16] I have heard Lord that and it was coming
[1:52:19] but now I see it with my church I'm so
[1:52:25] glad he sent he took and then he drew me
[1:52:29] out of many waters see the last the last
[1:52:33] quote that I'll read will be out of
[1:52:34] smyrnaean church age but let me just
[1:52:37] finish off with just a couple comments
[1:52:38] David could reflect when he thought on
[1:52:41] these words he sees sit from above he
[1:52:42] took me he drew me out of many waters he
[1:52:45] can reflect on where he had come from
[1:52:47] he was forgotten about in the field
[1:52:49] nobody thought that he would be royalty
[1:52:51] but God knew he was there God sent the
[1:52:54] Prophet to his house he was the eighth
[1:52:56] son that passed before the Prophet which
[1:52:58] represented a man a new beginning as
[1:53:00] well as an eternity and and we find also
[1:53:04] over in Leviticus 23 26 they were to
[1:53:07] offer for seven days and offering me by
[1:53:09] fire but on the eighth day they would
[1:53:13] have a holy convocation see the eighth
[1:53:15] day you know when you really think about
[1:53:16] it you know you start with Sunday go
[1:53:19] from Sunday to Monday Monday to Tuesday
[1:53:21] Tuesday to Wednesday Wednesday Thursday
[1:53:23] Thursday to Friday Friday to Saturday
[1:53:26] you hit seven days but the eighth day
[1:53:28] we're gonna bring you back to Sunday
[1:53:30] again how they look you and that's why
[1:53:33] some of you if you started a stunning
[1:53:34] ending sunny Sunday you are in an
[1:53:36] eternity and the eighth day they had a
[1:53:40] holy convocation
[1:53:41] glory to God so when we talked about you
[1:53:43] know we think about just all that all
[1:53:45] the ages that have gone come forth I
[1:53:48] mean from from Ephesus all the way to
[1:53:49] Laodicea amen all those different ages
[1:53:52] but here we come into what we call the
[1:53:53] bride age and God has called us back to
[1:53:56] perfection we thank God for this I can
[1:53:59] look back like David could look back and
[1:54:01] say you know what he sent from above he
[1:54:04] took me I'm just sitting there like
[1:54:07] Joseph but it came down and just grab my
[1:54:12] hand and he took me he drew me out of
[1:54:17] many waters from all the confusion all
[1:54:22] the nonsense in church he drew me out
[1:54:28] I'm grateful I'm so grateful this last
[1:54:33] quote I want to end with here today
[1:54:36] hallelujah smyrnaean church h-hold is
[1:54:41] carefully in mind now take the next step
[1:54:46] redeem means to buy back it restores to
[1:54:51] the original owner God by his death the
[1:54:55] shed blood brought back his own he
[1:54:58] brought back to spoken words see Brides
[1:55:01] you want and listen to this my sheep
[1:55:05] hear my voice were and they follow me
[1:55:07] you want to know why folk you know
[1:55:10] there's some folk can come to church and
[1:55:11] then hear me say brother Branham said
[1:55:12] maybe like what no where are you talking
[1:55:14] about wait why do you keep doing that
[1:55:17] why he keep saying it ain't going back
[1:55:19] there no more but there's others that
[1:55:21] could come and hear me say the prophets
[1:55:23] said brother Branham said like now I
[1:55:25] don't know what to talk about but
[1:55:26] everything he read about this prophet
[1:55:28] seemed to be something to it the the
[1:55:34] person the person that's identifying
[1:55:35] like that
[1:55:36] that's the person I've talked about that
[1:55:37] he's sent he took and he drew me out of
[1:55:45] many waters come on son I didn't even
[1:55:49] know how I got here all kind of
[1:55:51] circumstances was created to get me
[1:55:53] where I am
[1:55:54] ah oh my god I can I can reflect like
[1:55:58] David he said he pluck he drew look at
[1:56:04] this I'm going further in this quote my
[1:56:07] sheep hear my voice see and when I say
[1:56:09] the Prophet said if you're a true sheep
[1:56:11] of God you know I'm not elevating
[1:56:13] brother branham you will you will know
[1:56:20] I'm not elevating a man but as the voice
[1:56:23] of God through His Prophet hallelujah if
[1:56:26] you're living in the days of Moses when
[1:56:29] he went off the scene he told Joshua
[1:56:31] this book of the law where the what book
[1:56:35] it along wit did Joshua have it himself
[1:56:37] where'd it jobs forget the book of the
[1:56:40] law from a prophet Moses this book of
[1:56:44] the law shall not depart from my mouth
[1:56:46] sorry I'm sure Joshua was going around
[1:56:49] telling people Moses said when God sent
[1:56:58] a prophet we want to i'm not talk about
[1:56:59] just a prophet let me put it this way
[1:57:01] I'm talk about a prophet that fulfilled
[1:57:03] Malachi for a prophet that would fulfill
[1:57:06] revelation 10 God had already sent those
[1:57:08] scriptures before that prophet came and
[1:57:10] that prophet walks out for filled old
[1:57:12] scriptures and then he leaves and goes
[1:57:13] right back to where you come from that's
[1:57:16] why I could say God's sent from above
[1:57:18] he's sent just like he's sent a prophet
[1:57:22] to David's house now the average
[1:57:23] denomination can't say nothing like that
[1:57:25] he sent a prophet to David's house while
[1:57:29] David was in the field knowing nothing
[1:57:31] and I'm typing that to me I was in the
[1:57:35] world knowing nothing I was in the
[1:57:37] church knowing nothing but God had
[1:57:40] already sent it wasn't coming it would
[1:57:44] sit it was already past by the time it
[1:57:52] got to me it was past tense
[1:57:59] but even with it being pastors this what
[1:58:02] God already done it was still for me so
[1:58:05] he sent and then he took and then he
[1:58:08] drunk look at this my sheep hear my
[1:58:15] voice were and they follow me
[1:58:17] capitalizing me is Christ
[1:58:20] you always were a sheep you never were a
[1:58:26] pig or a dog turned into a sheep that is
[1:58:30] impossible for every kind of life
[1:58:32] produces the same kind and there's no
[1:58:34] change in specie as we were in the
[1:58:38] thoughts of God and then expressed in
[1:58:40] flesh their hat to come a day when we
[1:58:44] would hear his voice if I could put it
[1:58:47] in today's message terms just I'm gonna
[1:58:49] talk about what I'm preaching right now
[1:58:50] you had to come a day where you tracked
[1:58:52] the package there had to come a day
[1:58:57] where you would hear his voice the world
[1:59:00] and hearing that voice become aware of
[1:59:03] our Father calling us and recognized
[1:59:06] that we are the sons of God we heard his
[1:59:10] voice and we cried out as did the
[1:59:11] prodigal son son saved me oh my father I
[1:59:14] am returning to thee and I love this
[1:59:18] this is a beautiful story that the
[1:59:19] Prophet gives us they the Son of God can
[1:59:21] go a long time before he recognizes that
[1:59:27] he is a son in fact a lot of true
[1:59:32] Christians and I love that because you
[1:59:34] know you can be in denomination to be a
[1:59:36] true Christian can I say something else
[1:59:38] that a lot of message folk ain't gonna
[1:59:40] agree with you can actually receive the
[1:59:42] Holy Ghost in denomination you want to
[1:59:48] know evidence that you got it
[1:59:55] the Bible say the Holy Ghost will lead
[1:59:59] you and guide you into all truth that's
[2:00:02] evidence that you had the Holy Ghost
[2:00:04] before you got to the message because it
[2:00:06] led you to the truth
[2:00:09] and when you got to the truth then you
[2:00:11] realize he's he took he drew me out of
[2:00:20] many waters I son of God can go a long
[2:00:26] time before I recognize that he's a son
[2:00:28] in fact a lot of true Christians I like
[2:00:31] the story of the baby eagle that was
[2:00:32] hatched out underhand I mean he was born
[2:00:36] underneath the hand you know that eagle
[2:00:41] is a type of a true believer of that
[2:00:43] true believer well the farmer took an
[2:00:46] egg from an eagle's nest and he placed
[2:00:49] it under a hand I don't know why that
[2:00:52] farmer do something like that but I
[2:00:56] don't care where you placed me when I
[2:00:57] come forth I am what I am in due time
[2:01:02] all the eggs under the hand touched out
[2:01:05] because the environment was right for
[2:01:08] the egg to hatch the baby chicks got
[2:01:12] along fine with the mother hen but that
[2:01:16] little eagle could not figure out the
[2:01:20] clucking and scratching for food in the
[2:01:22] manure pile he managed to make a living
[2:01:27] you know I can go along with y'all folks
[2:01:30] you know for a little bit I mean I ain't
[2:01:33] really enjoying this but you know I'm
[2:01:35] here
[2:01:36] I got a church home you don't say but he
[2:01:40] was party with I mean he managed to make
[2:01:43] a living but he was pretty confused
[2:01:44] about it all but one day from way up in
[2:01:48] the air just some revelation that ain't
[2:01:51] never been said before was way up in the
[2:01:57] air mother ego that had laid the eggs
[2:02:00] spot that little eagle on the ground she
[2:02:04] swooped down
[2:02:06] with tremendous speed and springed at
[2:02:11] the top of her voice from Himmler fly
[2:02:13] out to meet her now
[2:02:14] now you got to understand mama then go
[2:02:16] down and pick the eagle up and make the
[2:02:18] Eagle come up hmm because you know when
[2:02:22] Eagles are taught to fly what typically
[2:02:23] happens is mama take them out the nest
[2:02:25] and take him for a flight and when she
[2:02:27] takes him for a flight she puts him
[2:02:29] underneath the wings and and she just go
[2:02:30] out and it just go soaring and selling
[2:02:32] it and then it just feels so good like
[2:02:33] oh yeah my mommy enjoying the rides and
[2:02:35] then all of sudden mama see she hit it
[2:02:38] real hard and they fall and when they
[2:02:41] begin to fall they begin to tumble they
[2:02:42] begin to tumble and say and maybe one of
[2:02:45] them get it like stick one wing guys got
[2:02:48] it mom I got this thing you know but the
[2:02:53] other one ain't got that kind of faith
[2:02:54] and in stuff not night and they just
[2:02:58] tumbling and tumbling all I'm about to
[2:03:00] hit the ground in all kind of stuff but
[2:03:02] mama knew what she did and I'm gonna
[2:03:04] come back around with a nice little
[2:03:05] swoop and before you're north she just
[2:03:08] reached out with a flip she got to know
[2:03:13] if this if there's another one father
[2:03:14] should reach out with the other flip
[2:03:16] pick up the other one
[2:03:18] my man gonna let you fall and if it's
[2:03:23] another phone she'll get that one with
[2:03:25] the peach but mama care I'm all right
[2:03:27] back to safety maybe one guy out I'll
[2:03:30] out of the four laughs mama that was
[2:03:32] good I don't need to he'll need no more
[2:03:33] flying lessons I got this watch this but
[2:03:37] the others like mama please don't ever
[2:03:38] do anything like that my heart my heart
[2:03:40] dropped
[2:03:41] I had no idea what was going on you
[2:03:43] didn't tell me you did not prepare me
[2:03:44] for this ride you didn't tell me
[2:03:46] anything about it ma so don't do that
[2:03:48] again
[2:03:51] mama no your eagle and you're gonna have
[2:03:55] to learn how to fly
[2:03:56] so she gave him a little bit more time
[2:03:58] to just get comfortable maybe next time
[2:04:00] she put him on the wings they got they
[2:04:01] like uh-uh I ain't let him go I know
[2:04:04] what Mommy did last time so I don't let
[2:04:05] y'all get counseling that she let him
[2:04:07] take her maybe a couple couple more
[2:04:08] rocks they're just so comfortable mama
[2:04:10] then one day she get him and they think
[2:04:12] they're going for a ride they get
[2:04:13] dropped again boom you better fly or die
[2:04:18] and there's something about the
[2:04:21] eagerness instinct that kicks in and
[2:04:24] realized that I was made for this
[2:04:26] I was actually made for this
[2:04:31] I got God designed my body and built me
[2:04:35] to be able to fly like this fly what am
[2:04:38] I talk about flying what'd you talk
[2:04:39] about
[2:04:39] I'm talk about flying into the scripture
[2:04:41] into the deeper things of God
[2:04:44] understanding everything from Genesis to
[2:04:46] Revelation hallelujah he said he took he
[2:04:51] drew she stooped down with tremendous
[2:04:57] Peter screamed at the top of voice for
[2:04:59] him to fly up to meet her so this this
[2:05:02] eagle has got to get up out of condition
[2:05:04] that they're in they got to make some
[2:05:06] effort themselves this ego has got to
[2:05:08] get up and start flying above the rest
[2:05:11] oh my god when I left my denominational
[2:05:14] Church that was me as an eagle getting
[2:05:16] up I had to go tell my pastor not coming
[2:05:18] back huh come on let me out undid that
[2:05:22] not coming back where you going
[2:05:24] oh that's a cult oh is it I don't heard
[2:05:27] some things that I never heard in my
[2:05:28] life call it a cult if you won't look at
[2:05:33] this he had never heard an eagle cry but
[2:05:40] when he heard that first scream
[2:05:41] something in him stirred and he longed
[2:05:43] to launch out toward it but he was
[2:05:46] afraid to try again that mother screamed
[2:05:50] for him to rise in the wind and follow
[2:05:53] her as soon as you feel that wind come
[2:05:55] get up in that when you feel that a
[2:05:57] North to come get up in that he screamed
[2:06:00] back that he was afraid once more she
[2:06:03] called out screaming that he tried
[2:06:07] baring his wings he hurled himself into
[2:06:10] the air and answered the cry of his
[2:06:13] mother he soared off into the blue skies
[2:06:16] you see he always was an eagle he acted
[2:06:22] like a chicken for a little while but he
[2:06:24] could not be satisfied but when he heard
[2:06:27] the call of the great eagle he came to
[2:06:30] his own place and once a true son of God
[2:06:32] hears the cry of the Spirit by the word
[2:06:38] say I love that I just that statement
[2:06:40] means so much to me we talked about it

[2:06:44] body is gonna happen by the spirit by
[2:06:46] the word yeah let me just you know the

[2:08:21] cut a step that that music got Spears
[2:08:24] you know people can be living for the
[2:08:26] devil and still hear gospel music with a
[2:08:30] shout and be ready to shout because
[2:08:33] music carry spirits well I want to tell
[2:08:36] you not only does music carry the
[2:08:38] spirits but the Word of God also carries
[2:08:41] a spirit not just a spirit but these
[2:08:45] spirits and as you listen to the Word of
[2:08:49] God them same feelings that come up come
[2:08:51] upon you with music amen you'll get
[2:08:53] different emotions when you listen to

[2:09:01] where that came from glory it's a spirit
[2:09:05] in the word and it's a spirit on the
[2:09:09] word and that spirit was producing the
[2:09:13] changing your body the same spirit is
[2:09:20] when you when you when you get into the
[2:09:22] spirit of the composer the one that
[2:09:24] wrote it like I said you've given to you
[2:09:25] you really get into what David's saying
[2:09:27] here you just stop and just like he's
[2:09:37] sent a prophet to David's house sitting
[2:09:40] on the my house he took me he drew me
[2:09:46] out of many waters all the people that
[2:09:51] he could have selected I start going
[2:09:53] back in my mind I just start going back
[2:09:55] the elementary school in Middle School
[2:09:57] in high school all the kids that
[2:10:00] graduated with me all this but he took
[2:10:03] me
[2:10:04] I was sitting there too like the rest of
[2:10:06] them but why did he come down to just
[2:10:08] grab my hand and come walk with me why
[2:10:13] did he do that to me it's because of his
[2:10:18] love I think I read earlier he did
[2:10:20] because he delighted in me a church I'm
[2:10:25] so grateful he delighted in me I can't
[2:10:30] say that for everybody else but I know
[2:10:31] but he delighted in me and let me take a
[2:10:33] woman that gets married and when she's
[2:10:36] so happy about that husband coming to
[2:10:38] propose to her and she's stepping his
[2:10:39] ring she is not embarrassed to win that
[2:10:41] man's ring and she's not embarrassed to
[2:10:44] be calling his wife she's not gonna feel
[2:10:47] bad about being his wife did you know so
[2:10:50] I'm sorry
[2:10:51] he didn't shushu he chose he chose me
[2:10:58] and my expectation is that he is only
[2:11:02] marry me
[2:11:13] once the true Son of God hears the crowd
[2:11:15] of spirit by the word he - we realize
[2:11:18] who he is and run to the great prophet
[2:11:22] eagle that's the Lord Jesus the great
[2:11:25] prophet Eagle and be with him forever
[2:11:27] seated in heavenly places in Christ
