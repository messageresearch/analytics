Heavenly Father, dear Lord God, I approach that throne of mercy, Father, this evening, thanking me Lord for your loving kindness, amazing grace, how sweet it sounds. It saved a wretch such as I. And I can sing a song that angels know nothing about. It's because of that amazing grace. Father, you've given us this opportunity to be here gathered according to your will and your purpose. I pray, Father, that you can meet with us in a special way like no other. &gt;&gt; Giving you all the glory and all the honor in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated for a second. Amen. Um, I just want to say thank you, brother Jack, for this wonderful honor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen.

We just came for the meetings and uh before we went back uh brother Jack just said &gt;&gt; uh you know &gt;&gt; can you take a service for us and you feel like saying no but &gt;&gt; it's one of those things that you know you can't run away from. &gt;&gt; Amen. I pray that you know you may just keep me in your prayers. Amen. It's it's a tremendous honor to stand behind this sacred desk and to be given the confidence by the pastor is not a light thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Um without uh wasting too much of your time, we can get straight into the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; I just want to ask if they received the email that I sent with. Okay. God bless you. Um may we rise to our feet as we just um read the word. If we can open our Bibles to um Isaiah chapter 61. Amen. Um verse one, the Bible says, "The spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord had anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek. He had sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that abound, &gt;&gt; to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance unto our God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To comfort all that mourn. &gt;&gt; Amen. And opening again to Hebrews 10:30, the Bible says, "For we know him that hath said, vengeance belongth unto me, I will recompense, say the Lord, and again the Lord shall judge his people." Let us close our eyes again as we commit this reading to the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we have opened the word. Any able-bodied person can do the same, but only you can interpret what's written therein. Father, I pray that Lord, you may bring an interpretation to this word. &gt;&gt; Father, I'm unable, but you are able. &gt;&gt; I'm unworthy, but you are worthy. &gt;&gt; Father, I cannot say anything to satisfy the hearts of your people, but I know that just one word from you can satisfy the hearings. Father, projecting the cross and the cross alone, hiding myself behind that cross that only Christ can be seen before the people, &gt;&gt; giving you all the glory and all the honor in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Needing you now more than ever, I pray believing. Amen and amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Um I just want to take a subject which is um the day of vengeance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. and you may take your seats. Amen. It's the day of vengeance. I spoke on this subject um probably about a month ago back uh when I was in England, but I thought maybe uh it's something that I can bring tonight. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; And and I hope that um God will help me deliver this in the way that is desired. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you happy to be in the house of the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you happy to be in his presence? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know, the prophet teaches us that we come to church under expectation, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That God will meet with us, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Can I see who's under expectation tonight? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you're under expectation, then anything can happen. &gt;&gt; Anything can take place. &gt;&gt; Amen. We see uh uh saints of old in the Bible. Those who were under expectation, God came down to meet with them. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can even remember the Hebrew boys. Amen. faced with this difficult situation, &gt;&gt; they were told, "Bow down of going to the fire, &gt;&gt; but because they expected that at any point God would deliver them." &gt;&gt; They faced the obstacle head on and they went straight into the fire. &gt;&gt; You could be between a rock and a hard place tonight. &gt;&gt; But if you're under expectation, &gt;&gt; if you're under expectation, &gt;&gt; I'll say it again. If you're under expectation, then God can meet with you at that point. &gt;&gt; When you don't know what to do. Amen. &gt;&gt; Moses under expectation. He just held that rod over the Red Sea. &gt;&gt; And the the the waters parted. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the prophet says, "I believe it's in redemption by completeness. &gt;&gt; The pillar of fire went, it was a go between &gt;&gt; between death, which was Pharaoh, and them." So the pillar of fire was a go between. Tonight, there can be a go between, amen, between you and that devil. &gt;&gt; As long as you're under expectations. &gt;&gt; Daniel in the Bible, he was faced with a lion's den, but he expected that God would deliver him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we under expectation? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you think about this church, Amen. Being in church is an opportunity &gt;&gt; for God to consider your case. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Think of it. Coming to church &gt;&gt; is an opportunity &gt;&gt; for God to consider your situation. &gt;&gt; Whatever you may be going through, this is an opportunity to present your case before God. &gt;&gt; And your case can be reconsidered, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Just like Hezekiah in the Bible. Amen. &gt;&gt; He had been told that put your house in order, &gt;&gt; you are going to die. &gt;&gt; But because he was under expectation, God reconsidered his case. That's right. &gt;&gt; And the same prophet that brought judgment is the same one that came back to say, "God has given you more time." &gt;&gt; Are we under expectation tonight? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The prophet says, "God will consider your case." &gt;&gt; Amen. And he will speak back. &gt;&gt; God can consider your case tonight and he will speak back to you. &gt;&gt; He will speak back to you. &gt;&gt; He may go to somewhere on that corner and he will speak to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Directly as you want it spoken, he can go to you and to you and to you as long as you're under expectation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We know there was a Mrs. Weber in the B in in the time of the prophet. Amen. &gt;&gt; She had been told, Amen. The angel of the Lord, Amen. went to the prophet and said, "Mrs. Weber, you should get things ready." Amen. If you show me the next one. Amen. Mr. Weber was told, "Get things ready for your wife is going." &gt;&gt; Right. Right. &gt;&gt; But Mrs. Weber, what did you do? &gt;&gt; She defended the prophet. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She was when when those people were talking wrong about the prophet. She said, "I know, Bill. &gt;&gt; I've seen him from when he was growing up &gt;&gt; and I just want to pray for me. &gt;&gt; And what did the angel of the Lord say?" The same angel came back, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And he said, &gt;&gt; "Tell her I heard her." &gt;&gt; Amen. And tell her that I heard what she said. Yeah, &gt;&gt; she just said amen to the word and her case was reconsidered. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can say amen tonight. &gt;&gt; If you say amen tonight, &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; If you say hallelujah tonight, &gt;&gt; if you say glory be to God tonight, the angel will come back with a message to say, tell this brother, tell this sister that I heard them say amen. &gt;&gt; And God can consider your case. Anyone can place their situation before God tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I was just doing a sound check. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, people that seen they do, you know, mic one, two, three, check. I was just doing the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, we're going to start speaking. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I said I'm speaking about the day of vengeance. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now just looking at a definition from the Miriam Webster dictionary of vengeance and what it means. Amen. It says that vengeance it's a punishment that's inflicted in retaliation of an injury or offense. Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, it's a retribution. Amen. It's it's a forceful payback. &gt;&gt; Keep that in mind. It's a severe forceful payback &gt;&gt; of what has been done &gt;&gt; and that's vengeance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And um we also understand that the word vengeance. Amen. It speaks of judgment. &gt;&gt; It speaks of wrath. Considering Romans chapter 12, Amen. Verse 19, the Bible says, "Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather &gt;&gt; give place unto wrath." &gt;&gt; In other words, he's saying that don't avenge yourself. &gt;&gt; Give place, leave the way open for the wrath of God to take place. &gt;&gt; Amen. For it is written, vengeance is mine. &gt;&gt; I will repay, sayeth the Lord. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And and the opening I read Hebrews 30 uh Hebrews 10:30. Now if you look at the preceding verses to verse 13 here the Bible um writes that he that despised Moses law died without mercy under two or three witnesses. &gt;&gt; Of how much sorrow punishment suppose he shall he be thought worthy who have troted underfoot the son of God? Amen. and counted the blood of the covenant wherein he is uh he was sanctified an unholy thing and done despite unto the spirit of grace. Amen. And then verse 30 then says for we know him that had said vengeance belongth unto me. In other words uh the Amen. Amen. In other words, the Bible was saying that um to those who have who have taken amen the the the the the grace of God and trotten it underfoot, the Bible says, "For we know him that said, "Vengeance belongth unto me. I will recompense, say the Lord." The Lord shall judge his people. The scripture is showing us that the word vengeance, Amen, it refers to God's judgment. &gt;&gt; Stay with me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Vengeance, &gt;&gt; we understand it refers to God's judgment. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But if you're a Bible reader, Amen. as you've been told that there's no word in the Bible that um is for not. Everything has its place. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're supposed to look at the Bible and be able to take something &gt;&gt; precept upon precept. Amen. Scripture upon scripture, here a little, there a little. what's written in one place. Amen. In another place, it will give more understanding of what else is written. &gt;&gt; And according to that, amen. &gt;&gt; When I looked at 2 Corinthians chapter 10:6, &gt;&gt; Paul here is speaking, he says, &gt;&gt; "And having a readiness to revenge, oh disobedience, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; When what? Your obedience is fulfilled." &gt;&gt; Amen. Now we took the words avenge and revenge. Now these these two words all result in vengeance. &gt;&gt; The only difference is that um avenging is taking vengeance on behalf of another person. &gt;&gt; In other words, it's impersonal or it's objective. &gt;&gt; Amen. But revenge, Amen, is seeking vengeance for yourself. &gt;&gt; Therefore, it's personal and subjective. &gt;&gt; So we looked at the two words in two different verses. One was saying avenge and another was saying revenge but all of them they were speaking of vengeance &gt;&gt; and I said I'm speaking about the day of vengeance. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now if you look at verse 6 of 2 Corinthians 10 &gt;&gt; look at the verse properly. Disobedience what is it? It's an evil thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And obedience is a good thing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when Paul says &gt;&gt; revenge all disobedience &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; with obedienceh &gt;&gt; revenge your disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; In other words &gt;&gt; take severe action &gt;&gt; forceful action &gt;&gt; retaliatory action to do what? &gt;&gt; To remove or to eradicate all the evil that has been done. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. In other words, when you revenge or disobedience with obedience, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; In other words, when vengeance has been taken. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; To replace disobedience with obedience. &gt;&gt; It's a complete reversal. &gt;&gt; It's a complete reversal, &gt;&gt; of all evil that has been done. &gt;&gt; It's reversing all the evil that has taken place &gt;&gt; with good. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's reversing every bad thing that has been done. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; With good. &gt;&gt; That's what 2 Corinthians 10 is telling us. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; That revenging disobedience with obedience. In other words, vengeance is taking place &gt;&gt; to take away all the evil that has been done. &gt;&gt; Replacing it with good. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; In other words, it's being done forcefully. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's paying back all the evil &gt;&gt; with something good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Severely. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Nothing can stop this reversal. &gt;&gt; So in other words, Paul is saying that vengeance must take place. In other words, reversal of everything evil with something good. &gt;&gt; When you break down the scripture and you analyze this, that's what that's what Paul is talking about. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Just tell your brother, your sister, say, "The day of vengeance." &gt;&gt; The day of vengeance. &gt;&gt; The day of vengeance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Now, if you look further again, &gt;&gt; it's not within human beings to stop disobedience or wickedness. &gt;&gt; In the natural state, a human being can never stop that. Once they start cascading down this path, there's nothing within a human being to be able to carry out this action. &gt;&gt; It's far beyond you and I. &gt;&gt; Amen. To stop disobedience or wickedness. &gt;&gt; There's nothing within us that can make us take this action. &gt;&gt; It takes God and God alone. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Coming into the heart of a human being through the baptism of the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; to turn this life around &gt;&gt; to stop this disobedience. Amen. &gt;&gt; To reverse this evil with good, it takes God and God alone. &gt;&gt; So when Paul is saying that avenge your disobedience with obedience, in other words, he's saying that this is an act of God. &gt;&gt; This is God and God alone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That is performing this reversal. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why scripture and scripture says vengeance is mine, say the Lord. I can totally understand it. There's nothing within you that can make you stop your disobedience. &gt;&gt; There's nothing within you that can stop wickedness. &gt;&gt; It takes God and God alone to perform this reversal. &gt;&gt; It takes God and God alone to bring this vengeance. Amen. Eradicating evil with good. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory be to God. &gt;&gt; I think I think you you are getting me right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now let me let me proceed by saying this. Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh sorry how how much time do we have? &gt;&gt; Okay. So we now understand amen that there's another aspect of God's vengeance or his judgment according to the explanation we looked at. There's another aspect of his judgment. Amen. Which is a reversal of all evil. Amen. It's a reverser of evil with good if you take the context of 2 Corinthians 10. So when the Bible says vengeance is mine, amen, it's pointing to God's judgment. But we just look at an aspect of this which this process, it reverses every evil thing. &gt;&gt; With something that's good to take its place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are we still together? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Having built that concept. Amen. Let's then turn to Isaiah 61. I'm not going to take your time. Amen. It's a midweek service. Amen. So I understand you know the complexities of life. Amen. So Isaiah 61. The Bible says now &gt;&gt; Yeah. But that's not &gt;&gt; the spirit of the Lord God is upon it picks up voices &gt;&gt; because the Lord has anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek. He had sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the prisons to them that are bound. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then the Bible says to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord &gt;&gt; and the day of what? &gt;&gt; Vengeance. &gt;&gt; The day of vengeance &gt;&gt; of our God to comfort all that mourn. Hallelujah. Now with scripture. Amen. You're supposed to to look at scripture and seek and an and understanding of what is being said. Amen. Now, we know that the Lord Jesus Christ when um there was one time he he went into the synagogue. Amen. And he went into the temple and what happened? He was handed a scroll. Amen. And then he opened the book of Isaiah to this very portion. And what does it say? If you look even in Luke chapter 4, it speaks about this. Amen. I highlight this in red to show that this is the Lord speaking to you so you can get it. &gt;&gt; The Bible says when you open the book, Amen. &gt;&gt; The spirit of the Lord is upon me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor. &gt;&gt; He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised. Amen. &gt;&gt; To preach the acceptable year of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And then the Bible goes on and it says, "And he closed the book &gt;&gt; as if he was seemingly ignoring verse two." Amen. &gt;&gt; He read verse one and at the end of verse one, he closed the book and then he handed it back. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; As if he was ignoring the latter part of the verses which which we read. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then the Bible says he gave it again to the minister and he sat down. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. And all eyes, all the eyes of all of them that were in the scene of God were fasted upon him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Keep your eye on Christ at all times. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. &gt;&gt; And he began to say unto them, &gt;&gt; this day, &gt;&gt; this scripture is fulfilled in your eyes. &gt;&gt; So when he goes into the temple, he opened Isaiah 61, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And then he started reading and then he stopped where it says, "Amen." um to preach the acceptance of the Lord and then he closed the book and he handed it back. &gt;&gt; Now we can only understand this not of our own understanding &gt;&gt; but by referring to the prophet of Malachi 4. &gt;&gt; He is the only one. Amen. &gt;&gt; That can help us understand this. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Glory glory to God. &gt;&gt; Now looking at this day this scripture is fulfilled. Paragraph 44, the prophet says, "How accurate is the scripture?" If you notice this in in Isaiah 61:1-2 is where our Lord was reading from. But in the middle of the second verse of Isaiah 61, uh he stopped where it said, "The spirit of the Lord is upon me to preach the acceptable year." Then he stopped. Why? The other part to bring judgment, which is that day of vengeance, Amen. &gt;&gt; The other part to bring judgment, it didn't apply to Oh, glory be to God. You may have thought that I I received a small blessing. Maybe that's my lot. But in the day of vengeance, the Bible says they shall possess double a double for your shame. And then God says, because this is what happens in the day of judgment, God says, I the Lord, I love judgment. Because in the day of vengeance, my business is to reverse evil with good for my people. And God loves it. Somebody may have robbed you all along. And that devil is seeking to rob. He's seeking to destroy. He's seeking to take away all your dreams. But God says in the day of vengeance, I'm going to repay the wrongdoer. I'm going to repay the wrongdoer. Do you love him tonight? God can do it for you. Hallelujah. In the valley of the dry bones, all the bones were scattered. All the bones were destroyed. But because God says, "I'll give you beautiful ashes." He went into the valley of the dry bones and then he took a bone that was meant to go to the other bone. He took the leg that was meant to connect to the right hip. It wasn't it was not haphazard. He took the very problem. He took the very situation rather that the devil had destroyed and he put it back piece by piece, piece by piece, piece by piece. West Palm Beach. God is going to collect all your dreams that had been shattered and he's going to put them together. But then what does he say? He doesn't prophesy. He say, "Son of man, can these dry bones leave?" He's saying, "Where's Palm Beach? Can the dry bones leave? Can the dry bones leave?" You may be looking at the valley of your dreams shattered and broken. But he's asking you tonight, can your hopes and dreams resurrect? Can your hopes and dreams resurrect? He's asking you. He's asking you to do the prophesying. So I'm going to allow you to prophesy tonight. Come, somebody say resurrect. Resurrect. Resurrect. Job. Job. Resurrect. Children, come back to the home. Family, you can apply the token. You may have a family member that does not want to get into the message, but God is asking you to prophesy. God is asking you to prophesy. God is not doing the prophesying. He's saying that you prophesy. You prophesy and your situation will resurrect. Your situation will resurrect. Your situation, hallelujah, it will walk into your home. Your situation will take two steps. It will it will knock on your door just like the alligators of Florida. It will come to your front door. Amen. Your hopes, they will resurrect. They will come scratching at the door saying, "Open the door for me." Oh, hallelujah. Son of man, West Palm Beach. West Palm Beach. Can your dry bones resurrect? Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You do the prophesying. This is your chance to prophesy. The day of vengeance, it's a complete reversal of evil with good. &gt;&gt; In other words, it's a complete restoration of everything. &gt;&gt; In 2 Kings chapter 8, Amen. There was a w woman. She had been told to leave the land because of famine. She is the one whose son had been resurrected by the prophet Elisha. But one time the king wanted to know the good things that had been done by the prophet. Hallelujah. And the book was opened and then and and then it came to a portion where it spoke about this widow. But remember she had left the land because of famine for seven years. And then while she was in the court somewhere, Gaz pointed her out to the king saying, "This is the woman whose son was resurrected." What did the king do? Hallelujah. The king said he appointed a certain officer. Hallelujah. To go and restore everything to restore what? All the years that had been lost. In other words, it was a complete reversal of everything that had been done that was evil. double for your possession. Oh, glory be to God. Now, watch this. Watch the scriptures. The Bible says the king is the one who appointed this officer. The king is the only one who can pass judgment. So, King Jesus this evening, King Jesus this evening, he's passing judgment on your behalf. And he's appointing a certain officer. Who is this officer? Amen. That's going to give you the restoration. It's none other but the Holy Ghost. It's none other but him. The Holy Ghost. He's coming over there. He's going to go to your bosses at work to say, "Release my daughter. Release my son." You've been causing them trouble all this time. But this is a total restoration. Release her. Release him. Release him. It's a restoration. Not for one year, not for 2 years, not for 3 years, but all the years. Start looking back in your life. It may be 20 years for you. I don't know. But the scripture says all the years. God is going to bring it back unto you. Oh, glory be to God. Glory be to God. All the years. Not in part, but in full. It's a complete reversal. Believe yourself this tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, as we've laid the context, I think you know what this day of vengeance is. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's carry on. Now um we know that the prophet says according to um the quote he says that day of vengeance amen it applied to his second coming. &gt;&gt; We've always got to stay in scriptures. Amen. Now if you open uh Daniel chapter 7 verse 9 the Bible says and I beheld the thrones were cast down and the ancient of days did sit whose garment was as white as snow and the hair of his head like pure wool his throne was like the fiery flame and his wheels as burning fire. Amen. a fiery. Now, it's talking about this setting that the prophet referred to as his second coming is speaking of the judgment, which is that day of vengeance. Now, we find this in Daniel 7 is it's talking about the ancient of days sitting upon a throne. Amen. And a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him. Thousands thousands ministered unto him and 10,000 times 10,000 stood before him. The judgment was set. Amen. And the books were opened. Hallelujah. Now in another place, the prophet says that the 10 thousands times thousands that ministered with him, they were the bride. So you and I were sitting with him with him upon that throne. Amen. This this is the judgment throne. Amen. Of Revelation 20. &gt;&gt; But I brought this in so we can stay with scriptures. Amen. But now give give me your attention when I say this. When I say this now, this judgment which is referred to by the prophet, Amen. If you take it in the context of the day of judgment or the day of vengeance, you can automatically cast your um your mind to the setting of Daniel 7, which amen is the conclusion the conclusion of the whole picture. In other words, is the culmination of the whole picture. the ancient of days sitting upon the throne passing judgment. So if you just look at that quotation in its isolation remember I said to you precept is upon precept line gives you understanding of another line. If you just take it in isolation you'll think amen the day of judgment is the one referred to in Daniel 7 or revelation 20. But this is the conclusion of the whole picture. It's the culmination of his second coming. Oh, hallelujah. This is when I get excited. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is when I get really excited. &gt;&gt; But then what is the second coming of the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. What is the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ? You can only see it in in scriptures. Amen. I love preaching from the Bible. Now, 1 Thessalonians 4, the Bible says, "For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven." In our, in other words, this is the second coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He shall descend from heaven &gt;&gt; with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first. In other words, Daniel 7, Revelation 20, is the culmination of the whole picture. But the second coming of the Lord, we find it in First Thessalonians 20. Oh, sorry. First Thessalonians 4:16. When he shall descend, he comes with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Oh, hallelujah. Now, in the message, the rapture. Amen. The prophet says that three things happens. A voice, a shout, um a voice, a trumpet has to happen before Jesus appears. Now Jesus does all three of them. Hallelujah. So his second coming, we start seeing it in 1 Thessalonians 4. Jesus himself who the prophet says the day of vengeance was referring to his second coming. his second coming. Amen. It's done in these stages. He does all three of them according to the prophet. A shout. What is the shout? What is the shout? Oh, hallelujah. West Palm Beach, what is the shout? &gt;&gt; What is the beginning of the second coming of the Lord? What is it, West Palm Beach? &gt;&gt; What is the shout? It's the message going forth. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The living bread of life bringing what? The bride. The bride. A shout is going forth saying, "Arise and trim your lambs. The bridegroom is coming." What is it? The when the Lord shall descend, he shall descend with a shout, the voice of the archangel, the trump of God. This is all his second coming. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Now, as as we've understood, Amen. According to Isaiah 6:12, Amen. We understand that the day of vengeance, it's God's judgment. The day of God's judgment. And then we've seen, amen, that there's a culmination of the judgment. But but then I want to say that the beginning of this judgment, the beginning of the day of vengeance. It starts when the Lord starts to descend. And Jesus does all three things. He begins with the shout. So when you start hearing the shout automatically you know that the day of vengeance is upon us. Oh glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Oh glory be to God. What does it say the other part to bring judgment? It comes with his second coming. And what did we say about judgment? It's the day of vengeance. And what is this? Is to reverse is to reverse all evil. &gt;&gt; All evil with good. Are you ready, West Palm Beach? Are you ready? Amen. The Lord comes down with a shout. The Lord comes down with a shout. Amen. If you show me the next picture. Amen. If you go to the next picture, what happened in 1963? The Lord descended. Amen. I listen. If people talk about this cloud, that's for them. But for you and me, I know that when he descended, he was showing that he started his descent. He started his second coming. &gt;&gt; Jesus doing all three himself. &gt;&gt; He came down to proclaim that the shout is now in force. &gt;&gt; And when you saw that cloud, automatically you know that now is the day of vengeance. So you can start buckling up somebody. You can start buckling up somebody because you're in the message. Are you happy you're in the message? Are you glad you're in the message? Now we can start saying that every evil thing that has been done to you, Amen, it's going to be reversed. &gt;&gt; It's going to be reversed. &gt;&gt; Every evil thing that has been done in your life, it's going to be reversed. Amen. It's a total restoration. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's going to be done forcefully. &gt;&gt; Amen. Without stopping it. Nothing is going to stop it. Nothing is going to stand in its way. Amen. Now if we go to Luke chapter 18, the Bible says, "And he spake a parable unto them to this end that men ought to always pray and not to faint, saying, There was in a city a judge which feared not God, neither regarded men." And there was a widow in that city, and she came up unto him, saying, "Avenge me of my adversary." And he would not for a while. But afterward he said within himself, though I fear not God, nor regard men, yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me." And the Lord said, "Hear what the unjust judge saith." Now the Lord turns around and he says, "And shall not God avenge his own elect which cried day and night unto him, though he be long with them? I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith upon the earth. West Palm Beach, God is going to avenge you speedily. God is going to do it with speed. Amen. He's going to take your situation. He's going to turn it around with speed. Hallelujah. I don't care what is tending in your way, but he's going to do it with speed. I don't know what is blocking you, but he's going to do it with speed. I don't care what devil is standing in front of you, but God is coming with speed. Hallelujah. He's coming with a force that cannot be stopped because he's raising an army in this last day. You are part of that army. &gt;&gt; You are part of the bride. Hallelujah. You are part of the army of God and nothing can stand in your way. Now look, now look at this. Amen. The shout it is the message. What is it? is the Lord Jesus himself descending. Hallelujah. Now I just want you to look at this. David when he went to Ziglag. Amen. And then he found that everything had been taken. He found that everything has had been destroyed. He knew that vengeance could could not be done by him. So what did he do? He went to the Lord God. Amen. He sought after God to say, "What can I do? My home has been destroyed. My children have been taken away. So what shall I do? He went to him who vengeth belongth. And God said in verse 30, "Amen." And David inquired at the Lord, saying, "Shall I pursue after this troop, and shall I overtake them?" And God answered, saying, "Pursue, for you shall overtake them, and without fail you shall recover all." &gt;&gt; West Palm Beach, tonight it's time to recover. Oh, West Palm Beach tonight. It's time to recover. Oh, it's time to recover everything completely. It's time to recover everything. I don't know what is going on or miss, but tonight in service, if you are in service, this is your lucky day. If you're in service tonight, this is the day to recover. Oh, it's time to start an operation recovery. Oh, this is the time. This is the season. It's a new season. It's a new day to start recovering. Oh, I don't care what has happened to you. I'm fixing to close, but this is the time to recover everything. It's time to recover everything. All the children that have gone astray, you shall recover them. All the marriages that may have broken up, you shall recover them. You may have had a sickness, amen, that has been troubling you, but this time, this evening, you shall recover your health. This is the time to recover all the empty pockets that the devil had tried to put in you. Amen. But you shall recover everything. Riches come from above. Promotion cometh not from the east or the west, but promotion comes from above. Let me start prophesying here before I go back to London. Somebody's going to get promoted because you shall recover everything all the years that Satan has been stepping down on you. This is the season to recover everything. I didn't come from London to play games with Satan. I'm coming to tell you, amen, that you shall recover everything. You shall recover everything. Now, somewhere between the meetings in July and today, Brother Jack, somewhere between the weekend and Wednesday evening, something has happened. That something is called operation. Recover all things. Somewhere between here and there, there is a recovery. There's a recovery of all things. Oh, glory be to God. You at the back. You at the back. God is going to recover for you. God is going to take back. Satan, give it back. Satan, give it back. You're going to the enemy's camp. You shall recover everything because our God is faithful. Our God is faithful because you're in the message. God is going to recover everything for you, for you and for everybody. Oh, glory be to God because you have believed the prophet messenger. The word of the prophet can travel. The word of God can travel to any continent. You may have a desire tonight that you think can never be be claimed, but tonight it shall be recovered. Tonight it shall be recovered. You've just got to say, "Amen." Say, "Hallelujah, somebody." And the angel of the Lord, the angel of the Lord will come with a message saying, "I heard them in West Palm Beach." They were saying, "Amen." They were saying, "Hallelujah." And for that reason, I shall recover everything. I shall recover everything. Now, God loves this noise. Amen. God loves this shouting. God loves this shouting because the shout is the message. The shout is the Lord himself. Remember what happened at the walls of Jero. Amen. The scripture says the instruction there was a captain of the host. His back was to Jericho. Now, let me ask you something. If you're in war with somebody and you turn your back to them, it means you've got total control of the situation. He gave them an instruction and he said on the first day, what do you do? You go around what? &gt;&gt; The walls of Jero. What was the instruction for the second day? &gt;&gt; You walk around. What was the instruction on the third day? &gt;&gt; You walk around. But what was the instruction on the seventh day? On the seventh day, you go around the walls. And when you go around the walls the seventh time, what do you do? What do you do? What do you do? Now, let me leave this with you. Amen. Paul sounded his message. Paul blew the trumpet. Remember the the Bible says on the first day you blow your trumpets, but then you go back to the camp. Paul blew his trumpet and the bride you went back to your camp. Iranians blew his trumpet and they went back to the camp. But on the seventh day when the seventh messenger when he began to sound his message, you were given an instruction to give a shout because the manifestation of the shout which is the Lord himself who gave the shout who gave the shout. It was the children. It was you and me. We are the ones that have been told to give the shout. So, somebody in West Palm Beach, according to the instruction, God says you should give a shout of praise. God says you should say amen. God says you should say hallelujah. And as you say, hallelujah. The walls of Jericho, they are crumbling down. That situation, that devil, he's crumbling down. Whatever stood in front of you because you are giving this shout, it's coming down. is coming down by force. It's coming down by order proclaiming the spirit of Christ to go and fight for you. The Bible says you you shall not need to fight in this battle because I the Lord, he is the one who does the fighting for you. So I'm going to give you the next minute to start giving a shout of praise. Somebody start saying hallelujah. Because in the seventh day, in the seventh day, you are meant to give a shout. Christ in you, the hope of glory. Christ in you. He is the shout. But then is manifested in the bride. The shout is manifested in you and me. The shout is manifested in you and me. So as you were told, this is the time to finish everything. This is the time to finish the devil. Don't play games with Satan. Don't be like Pharaoh who said, "I want the flies to go tomorrow." The devil should go now. Right now. The moment you walk out of there when you go to the car park to get your car. The devil should have left your home. Brother Jack will come to your home one day and then he will find you shaking the sheets looking for the goer which will have fallen off. You'll be looking for the problem that had been troubling you. You'll be shaking those papers from those court summons. You'll be shaking that regret letter that told you that you can't have this job. You are not good enough. You are not the right caliber. You're not the right person. But in the seventh day, you can give a shout of praise. In the seventh message, in the seventh age, you can give a shout of praise. God and God alone. He will bring down the walls of Jericho. They will come tumbling down. Oh, glory be to God. Believe us now this. Somebody say hallelujah. Somebody say glory be to God. God bless you church. As I return to Lantern, return knowing that we are in the day of vengeance. And God in the day of vengeance, he shall recover everything for you. He shall reverse every evil with what? with good, every evil with what? &gt;&gt; If you didn't have a job, you've got to start saying that that job is what? It's mine. &gt;&gt; The job is what? It is mine because God is faithful. If you didn't have your healing, start proclaiming that because of the day of vengeance, there's going to be a reversal and God will give you my help. Somebody praise the Lord tonight. God bless you as I return to London. Over to you, sir. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on and give God praise. My Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Oh my God. My God. My God. I I don't think I ever heard it this way before. Amen. That That was just right on time. Right on time. This the day of vengeance is God reversing everything. Turning all the evil into good. I just love the way he brought out that scripture there in Isaiah 61. When you go back and you just read all of those things, take your time and I mean underline it. Oh, he's changing the whole situation. It's the day of vengeance. We always looked at as something negative, but no, this is something positive for the believer. Everything is changing for the believer. Everything is shifting. Beauty for ashes, right? Joy in the time of mourning. Everybody else is mourning for vengeance, but you got joy. Something something has changed for you. And I just love the way that brother brought that. He say God going to do it speedily. &gt;&gt; See, avenge is when somebody fights for you, &gt;&gt; but revenge is when you fight for yourself. But when you read the scripture said that God will avenge, that mean God is fighting on your behalf. &gt;&gt; And I've never seen him lose not one battle. He's never lost a battle. And he does it quickly. Praise God. Man, I needed I needed that tonight. We we we we we came right out of the meetings and um you know um the devil just had to start with something and uh and as as we were you know come coming into the meetings, we start having problems with our AC and we got guests at the house and fans going and people sweating while the fans He's like, "Lord, we got trouble here." So, he's calling for the AC guy and he comes out and he says, "I don't see anything wrong." U you know, and he does a little something and charges $125. Okay, no problem. All right. We thought it was good, but we still sweating. We still sweating. We called him back out. He come right before the meet. He says, "Well, you know, I think you got a part that's broken and I can't find it. It take me four days to find this thing." I said, "Okay. All right. Well, we just got to wait until you find it." So he comes back on the day after the meeting say I got the part say all right great. He comes and just installs it but didn't tell us how much it was going to cost &gt;&gt; and then at the end after it's all done and and feeling real cool in the house he dropped $2500 on us. I say well praise God. Hallelujah. Don't don't the devil know how to fight? But this brother say God going to avenge &gt;&gt; speedily. So, I'mma just let God do it. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, boy.

Um he went down and he did everything and um he he once we decided on that car, he found the car, he found where it was. He did all the um the talking back and forth, all the negotiating, everything for me. Um my car was just it was bad. Um I was going somewhere and I was slowing down and uh it just cut off. it just it just stopped and I just say, you know, God, I thank you for protecting me. Um that it be because it could have been worse and I was literally in traffic when it happened. Um so at that point, my family was like, "No, you're done. Um you need a car." So, um, we went down, um, and started looking at the cars and and once we got there, before I got out of my car, um, he told me, he said, "Look, I'm going tell you now that it's going to get a little ugly, but you going to get this car." And I said, "Okay, all right." So, we went and sat down to the um to the um to the desk and Stephen did all the the talking. I'm sitting over in the corner playing on my phone, you know, and he's doing all the talking and going back and forth and they pushing papers back and forth and um um the salesman gave him one price and he was like, "No, no, your math ain't math. No, no, no." And I kind of looked up and I was like, "Okay." And I'm still playing on my phone and then um he went, "Oh, I got to talk to my manager." And went and talked to the manager, came back, gave him another number. Stephen said, "No." And then he looked at the man and he said, "Who can I thank for wasting my time for coming down here?" And I was like, "Who can't?" So, so I playing on my phone. And then the um the person was like, "Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on." And then um they went back and forth and I'm really engrossed in what I'm doing, which is not paying attention to them. And so he said, "Uh, ma," I said, "Yeah." He said, "Look," I said, "Is it good?" He said, "Yeah." I said, "Do I sign?" And he said, "Yeah, you go ahead on and sign." I said, "Okay, I'mma sign it." And it was the payment was actually less than what I wanted. &gt;&gt; And I thank God for putting him in the in in the place where even when they were leaving, they actually missed their flight. Well, their flight was cancelled because of weather. So, they had to come back and we were able to do all of that work while he was here. So, I just thank God I have a car.

God bless you, Sister Virginia. &gt;&gt; I don't want to come up, but I do want to share test my testimony. Um, I just give God thanks and praise for Ashley. If you all know that she was really sick um about a week or so ago out in Texas um where she could barely hold her head up um but she had a desire to be at the meetings. So um and then for her to get to the meeting, she need to be well enough to travel. She traveled from LA to um Dallas and she said with the pressure her ears drums just felt like they were going to burst. She had a lot of fluid um in her ear and some other things going on. But um I think by Wednesday night, she was here by 10:00 Wednesday night and she was able to be in the meeting on Friday. Um she had said, "Well, I'm only going to go to the service on Sunday, Sunday morning. I'm not going to go to the meetings on Saturday." I think they had some of the things planned for Saturday, but she was only planning to come to this um Sunday morning meeting. And then Sunday evening call uh after they went out to eat um Gyrus's sister called and they well they said um we don't have time to come back and get my shoes. Bring my shoes and and we'll meet you at the church. So I said okay. She calling for a shouting shoes. We we we going back tonight. So and her mom was like she's going back. I was like yeah. She said bring her shouting shoes. Bring her shoes. And she coming back. I call her shouting shoes but she said bring her tennis shoes. And she was going back. Um, in the service doing the singing, Ashley got really sick again and um, she went up for prayer and next thing I know she was in the bathroom. They went and checked on her and she was in there just throwing up, just throwing up. So, we decided to go ahead and leave so that she could go home. Um, and she was like, well, she really didn't want to go. She felt like, you know, she would be okay, but she was just just a mess and she didn't want to be throwing up while everybody was coming out. So, we left out a little early before everyone else. And we went to the car again. She was just throwing up while we were in the car. We had to stop in the parking lot and everything. And Brother Whisper came out. So, I got him to pray for her. He prayed for her in the car and I said, "Well, I'll go go ahead and take her home and I'll go get something to drink, Gatorade or ginger ale or something like that." So, while we were in the store getting her something to drink, she called. She said, "Mama, I'm healed. I'm fine." She said, "I don't want you to be worried about me. I feel good. I I'm fine. I don't have any more problems." So, and as you all can see, she decided to give her testimony on Facebook and sing. And that's that's to me that's the greatest testimony that I haven't heard her sing in a long time. And that was a real blessing to me. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. I think that was what was she sung? Um he he touched me. Yeah, he touched me. Uh yeah, that's that went back. But uh she was Yeah, she sure let that one loose. Uh but she had sent me a text on Monday morning said that after brother Gwyn had prayed for her. Um I think she she regurgit regurgitated one more time, but it relieved all the pressure that she had in her brain and and that's when she knew she was healed. And uh so so God did some mighty things there in our midst. Praise the Lord. Anybody else want to share? Okay, come on. Come on. I I saw Sister Zion. Did I? Come on, Sister Zion. Amen.

I just want to thank the Lord for spirit and truth and what has been for me and what it's meant to me. Uh as we all know, you know, I was in an accident the end of last year. So traveling has been, you know, somewhat of a complication and as you know, this is probably my first Wednesday back in a while. And to be a service like this where vengeance is mine, says the Lord is the most important thing to me cuz I'm expecting God to move speedily in order to renew everything that I got tooken from me. So, I'm just thankful that he's opened the door for me to be able to I got a call probably what was it Wednesday last week and was like, "Hey, brother, what's uh what's going on with the case?" And I'm like, "Well, I explained the situation, everything." And I was told, I was instructed like, "Well, how about you look around for rental cars and everything like that and then, you know, send get back to me." So, I'm like, "Okay." So, I did what I was requested to do. I sent the information and at the at when I got off work that night, it mean the text came late, but it was like, "Listen, we're going to go get you a rental car tomorrow." So, I got a rental car for a month. So, hopefully within that time frame, my whole case will be done, but I'm grateful that I was able to be here in service tonight. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. God is good. Amen. Brother Solomon. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then you preach something about immediately. God moves immediately. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We've been hearing that tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. um on Sunday night's uh service at the towards the end, brother Whisper told us he was going to give us 30 seconds to declare and decree a thing. So, while I was up front, I was crying out uh about a few things, but my main thing was for my children to receive the Holy Ghost. And as I was crying out about these things, my hands raised and I turned around and went back to my seat. And I got ready to raise my hand to continue on. And brother Troy, he he grabbed me on my shoulder. And I looked at him. He had this look on his face and I was like, "What's wrong, brother?" He said, "Joseiah just received the Holy Ghost. [Music] [Applause] [Music] That was only a few seconds. &gt;&gt; God moved immediately. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; But I have four children, &gt;&gt; so I'm expecting the rest to come. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. I was talking with my wife about it. She said, "I got two boys. One just received the Holy Ghost. One is still battling with the world." And I told her, "Restoration is a process. &gt;&gt; It's a process." But he'll be back. &gt;&gt; He actually came home. So he he's with us now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] So, he went in for a job interview and I I guess they might be working him right now. &gt;&gt; Y'all pray for him. Oh, he's here. There he is. Praise the Lord. He's in church. [Applause] &gt;&gt; It's good to have brother Nehemiah back home. Praise God. It's just something about this season, &gt;&gt; you know, and um um he was um they start doing a lot of posting about the the CD going to be released on the day and and uh he was just reposting everything. I said, "Man, I miss you." He say, "Uh, I I'll be home for the meetings." and uh and he came right at the end of the meetings and uh good to have brother Nehemiah back home. I tell you God got great things in store and and and and and he done he done exposed himself because he be out there doing all this singing &gt;&gt; and uh and I know that I'm the one praise I ain't going to I ain't going I ain't going to do that. Do we have any other testimonies? Okay. Come on, Sister Jima. Praise the Lord. God bless you. God bless you. God bless you, church. Um, this is uh small to others but a big to me. Um, I've been having trouble with AT&T for the past couple of weeks where they shut off my phone, spoke, we was literally me and my husband been on the phone with different representative and it was seemed like nothing was working. Uh, f last week, I believe it was Wednesday or Thursday. Um, I said, "I'mma call AT&T." And he's like, "Okay, go call them." I called them, was on the phone for hours with one person, and he's like, "Well, you you need to pay this, this, this." And I'm like, "Okay." But I spoke to someone. He was just very rude on the phone. So, he transferred me to someone else and got on the phone with that guy. That guy was trying to fix the situation, but when he realized it was too big for him to fix, he just was he was like, "Um, I don't know, ma'am. Uh, I don't see what else I could do." So, I hand the phone to my husband and he said, "I don't know what happened. I walked away after this point, but keep in mind I've been praying because I'm like, I can't walk around here without a phone." And uh I've been praying. So, I let I walked out of the room and let him somehow he end up on the phone with the manager. And I don't know towards the end of I don't know the whole conversation, but towards the end, the lady was like, "Well, we'll give you guys a credit of $600. We don't know where the credit is going to go towards your towards the phone or towards your bill, but either way, you'll have to wait until Monday to figure out when the where the credit went. So, we both was talking. We just was like, "Well, the meeting is coming. We're going to pray over this whole situation." At the end of the day, I said, "It's already done. It's going to go towards the phone." I looked at him. I'm like, "It's going to go towards the bill. They're going to pay my phone. is gonna be paid off and I'm not going to worry about it. Well, I got a text message today um saying to restore your phone, you have to pay $91. And keep in mind, the bill was really high all because of some messed up team AT&T did where the bill was super high and all we had to pay was $91. And I I called Maris. I'm like, they said we all have to pay $91. And he talking about that's it. We knew God was gonna do it. So, he paid it and my phone is on. I mean, so, um, before the meetings, we had like a lot of a lot more stuff. I'm still waiting. Um, I know it's all going to come in due time. So, you'll see me again. God bless you. &gt;&gt; That's all right. Prophesying that there will be another testimony. &gt;&gt; Amen. God is good. All right. Anybody else want to testify? Anybody else? All right. Amen. Praise the Lord. On um was it yesterday? I think it was yesterday. Um I had to go rent a tool from uh Home Depot to uh do some yard work. So, I go and rent the tool and I'm trying to rush back. Now, mind you, I caught myself getting up early. I had to I went to one Home Depot and rented the tool. Got back to the house to use the tool and uh uh it wasn't working. So, I took it back to that Home Depot. I went to another Home Depot to rent the tool and I got it from there. I'm trying to rush back cuz I'm trying to beat the heat. Okay. So I'm on my way back and actually coming up that hill there on job near Jacob and I'm coming around and I'm trying to get over into the left lane and there was another vehicle come up to block me. So I waited. This lady came up and she said some choice words to me and I said well you either you going to go what are you going to do? So she didn't go anywhere. So, I sped up and I had room to get over and as I'm getting over, clip the side of my car in the back fender. The car swerve coming down that hill. Thank be to God, he was able to get it back in control. &gt;&gt; Ended up going down the hill, called the police. Whole thing happened. They said, "Sir, we're going to have to charge you with the accident." I said, "Watch me." She sped up. Well, we can't prove she sped up. I said, "Well, thank God that's why I got insurance." But I just thank God that I didn't totally lose control and roll that car going down that hill. &gt;&gt; So, thanks be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And I got home, got the tool, used the tool, got the work done, and took it back. Amen. So &gt;&gt; this this who got my &gt;&gt; Come on, brother Jerry. Before we do this, God bless you, church. These meetings were certainly life-changing. Um this testimony is a little bit of some of the things that happened throughout the meeting and even after um throughout the meeting uh in the weekend uh just the atmosphere was just was just you you know the presence of the Lord was there and it didn't hit me until um I got home and I believe this was Saturday night Uh, and we're getting ready to put the bed or put the kids to bed. And I've never seen this like this in my children, but I just saw a shift and it started with my son Jeremiah and he uh just just saw him getting the mic and we we have different toy mics and and all he wanted to do is is is pretty much have service. Um he would take we have the phone and he would start playing quiet music and I'm like what what are we and he would take the mic and he would start trying to either sing or something or or I mean my wife even looked at him and says is he preaching and and and and I've just saw this shift in them and my daughter and and and and all of them. And I was it was at that moment it hit me. I was like, "Oh my, they recognize something. They recognize the presence of the Lord." &gt;&gt; Um, and ever since I've seen the same uh the same uh attitude in them. So, I just want to thank God for that. &gt;&gt; And uh my uh throughout the meetings is uh different ones that I invited. I wanted a lot of uh people that uh family uh to be there. Um, I want to thank God that my mother got the chance to make it. Um, growing up, uh, I I I I thank my mother for, uh, showing me, you know, how to be to be committed to going to church. Uh, but when we had the chance to, uh, sit right next to each other, um, I I just saw how how she was saying amen to the revealed word. &gt;&gt; And I thank God for that. She called me right after service. She says, "I've never I've never seen, you know, the Lord moving that way." &gt;&gt; And and she says she says she was so blessed. &gt;&gt; So, I want to thank God for that. And I have a a older sister that I haven't seen in years. And she moved back into Palm Beach County. And I had a chance to invite her on Friday. and she she came and after the service we spoke and she says, "I've been looking for a place to fellowship and I would like to I'd definitely like to come back because I see the spirit of the Lord moving here." &gt;&gt; And the last one I want to mention is I have another sister, my younger one, that I wanted to be there as well. She gave me her commitment, her word that she was going to be there on Friday. Uh but things happened and it didn't work out. Um, and she reached out to me on Monday, uh, Monday morning. Um, and she told me, you know, she felt so bad that she didn't make it. She was, she was saying, "I'm sorry." And then she started asking me questions, uh, like, "Why does God allow this to happen or that to happen?" Uh, but I began just sharing some scriptures with her. And, you know, um, she I I I believe God is on his way of restoring her back. Um, I I see that her heart is tender and and I see that she she she realizes where she is and she knows that this next turn is got to be God. So, I'm I'm claiming, you know, that her testimony that she's been restored &gt;&gt; um and that she'll be back in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you all. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Um earlier today when we were setting up, brother Jack was letting know we can't set up the camera. We're trying to set things up to get the best shot. We can can't do it here and there and this that and the other because going across there is a trip hazard. And um so brother Maris, come on up. This was already something not done for your birthday. Let brother Maris take it from here. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Um well, first just to add a little more context. Um uh well, I'm a testimony from my wife. Um we are one, so that's our testimony. Um they uh AT&T had changed a plan on our phone um where they switched the numbers to the phone and added the line and they locked it and told us in order for us to undo it we had to cancel both and pay like $1,000 and um I told my wife said no way I'm paying $1,000 for a phone. There's no way just for the bill that wasn't you know um so like she said she I she said oh yeah I said just call them. She called, she gave me the phone, she walked away. I said, "Um, we've been trying to figure this out for a while. You know what? Can I just talk to your supervisor?" Excuse me. Um, so, um, they called the supervisor I talked to. I said, "Ma'am, I don't know what's going on, but this this just ain't this ain't right." I was like, I I was like, "I don't mind, you know, a phone bill. I want the service, but I would not pay $1,000 for just a phone to be on when it was something done without our consent." Um, well, she said, "Sir, that was one of our retailers that wasn't AT&T, even though it said AT&T on the building." Um, so I just I said, "Ma'am, just something got to change." And as I said it to her, I hear clicking in the background. And she said, "Well, sir, I'm going to post a $600 credit to your account, and I don't know which way it's going to go on Monday. You'll see." And that's my wife said, she walked away. I said, "Okay." I already told her right then and I said it's going to be all right by next week. Don't worry about it. And it happened and like I said, she said she got an email was 97 $91. That's it. All right. Pay it and phone restored. Amen. Um that that was just um but these these um as brother brother Troy said earlier, he brother Troy looked at me say, "Yeah, don't like don't your job make carpets?" And um God bless you, brother Simba. We've been working on this for a while. Um, so it they actually just came in Monday when we were setting up uh taking everything out of uh Palm Beach Gardens. Um, I remember pastor saying that the church started at his home. So I wanted to make sure I got a carpet that represented here and I want another carpet to represent there cuz somewhere between here and there [Music] [Applause] I bless you, brother Jack. And we preparing for our new home. &gt;&gt; My my my praise the Lord. You do this. &gt;&gt; Wow. Wow. That that's that's one of them carpets where you want to tell people don't step on that now. Walk around that. Don't step on that. Thank y'all brothers. My god. What that is that is awesome. My what a wonderful surprise. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you very much. My Amen. Amen. Um, I I I I thought we'd have at least one more testimony and I don't know if the brother want to give a testimony. Uh, Brother Steve, you got anything you want to say tonight? Anything. Yeah, I thought so. I thought so. Yeah, you can. Yeah. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He's my fishing buddy. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. I use my body when we go out for fishing. Oh, God bless you, saints. God bless you. &gt;&gt; I'm so happy to be here. The devil was trying to, you know, distract our way when we're coming here. We actually got here and we told turn here. I said, "There's no turning here." Then I proceeded along. Then he told me to go and make a U-turn until brother Solomon came to our rescue and said, "No, just stand there." And here we are by forced order. Uh, I'm not new here. This is this is home to me, so to speak. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I don't want to start to go into scriptures and and the like because we might spend the other night here. But uh all I want to say is you are thou art at favored &gt;&gt; because uh the arm of the Lord is upon this church and uh it was always my desire uh to see such a gathering in an environment where they are not pressed for time &gt;&gt; and where you can do all your things &gt;&gt; according to your will. All I'm saying is I've just come to put my hand on the plow as well. &gt;&gt; And we are going to soldier on together. &gt;&gt; God is not a God of distance. &gt;&gt; Despite that I live in England, but when we trigger on some prayers, I know the gentleman who is none other than the Holy Ghost will direct that holy that plea and everything will come to fruition. &gt;&gt; I want to say God bless you so much. I love you as you know all the time &gt;&gt; and I'm saying I'm part of this church. &gt;&gt; Who knows? God bless you. [Applause] Praise the Lord. I I I really appreciate uh brother Steve. He's a very humble brother, but he he took it personally. Um I believe it was it once a week or once a month? Once a month. Um and I want to say it's probably been at least a year. Uh once a month he would fast for the church and he would fast that uh God would open up a door for us. So he comes in this season to actually see God open the door. &gt;&gt; Uh so his fasting was not in vain. And this is, like I said, it's just part of the journey. It's part of the journey. But we we we're grateful. Brother Tee uh told us that eventually them bombs gun go off. &gt;&gt; And when one bomb go off, it sets another bomb. It sets off another bomb and it sets off another bomb where we're starting to see the bombs go off. &gt;&gt; Right. So we uh we we're we're under Amen. Great expectation for all that God has in store. Uh so good to be here. I'm going to have brother teach come and close us uh in a word of prayer. And um uh brother Jonathan, do you want to say anything? You you got anything you want to say? I'm sure you do. I know you do. Come on. Come on. Amen. I got all these preachers in the house. Amen. If you don't say nothing but God bless you, say something. I know brother Jack knows better than to hand a mic to a preacher. Supposed to leave his thing on a stand, you know, but God bless you. Spirit and Truth Tabernacle, I cannot tell you how much we feel at home here. We love y'all. And uh I'll give a a quick testimony. So for the uh past Well, let me just back up. All of y'all know I'm a general contractor, I think. And uh so year of co 2020, we had like a phenomenal year. It was about this time uh yeah, 2020 had a phenomenal year. 2021 had a really good year with the business. We moved from one house to another house thinking we were going to remodel the house that we were moving into. And we were really planning on on using this place if if believers came in, it gave them a place to stay and and and that sort of thing. and uh 22 hit and um this was shortly after I was I was ordained and and started ministering. But uh Satan started attacking and I mean the our decline on the business I mean it started hitting hard by the time 23 hit like I had no work and I mean we were trying to figure out how to hold on to the house that we had just bought. Um, this moved right on into 24. And when I tell you, I mean, we were downsizing our cars. I mean, we were doing everything we could do to get rid of payments on things just so we could hold on. And it was like, I mean, I I was on my knees constantly, you know, just like, Lord, if I'm doing something wrong, if I did something wrong, you know, show me what it is so we can fix it, whatever. And and and this is a long story, but I'm going to make it short. I mean even to the point where my wife where she was working in three days I mean three times in one day the Lord told her to quit her job and I mean he would not allow her to work uh you know we we went for you know several months and she was like well maybe well maybe you needed to just to switch jobs so try to go back to work and I mean the he would just stop it immediately. I mean, her mom went in the hospital one time, right? I think it was the day she was supposed to start, you know, would not allow her to work. I couldn't get work. And it was like, what in the world's going on here? Just kept praying, praying, praying. And he would just give us just enough money to pay the bills. Just enough to pay the bills. So, we just kept, you know, and and of course, you know, it's causing stress here, but we just kept kept going. Kept going. And uh but this uh this past year 2025 hits. At first it started with her. She gets a phone call from a school um where she had gotten um um a lady that could not stand her at her old job. Could not stand her. Gave her a referral to another school. That school calls her. We didn't call them. They called her. And the Lord just opened that door up. More money, better hours. Boom. She got a job. And then all of a sudden, my work just started coming. And it started coming. I mean, I'm like booked all the way to the end of this year at this point, you know. And I was I was telling brother Jack and I think I told brother Jimmy, I was like, you know, when Job went through his trial &gt;&gt; when he came out the other side. He didn't just get what he lost. He got double. So, as his brother was saying, I was prophesying, I'm getting double. I'm waiting for my double portion. So, I just want to thank the Lord for what he's doing for us and and we're we're working on our house now. So, hopefully in a a few months, you know, you guys want to come, come on, we'll have a room for you. God bless you. [Music] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm glad he he caught that cuz I was thinking the same thing while brother Ben was preaching that Job got double and he he man that scripture that he read there out of Isaiah 61. I'll never look at that scripture the same way again. My brother teach, we're going to let you close us out in a word of prayer. And if you got something to say, say it, brother. Say it. Amen. But you can come and close us out tonight. God bless you. I greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Uh the preacher has already preached. The testimony have already been said. So I will not hold you any longer. I will not be like Pharaoh. So I'll let you people I'll let the people of God go. Amen. So I have to bless you. Amen. Amen. Believe in the power of prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. The the the prophet behind the pit has already prophesied. You know &gt;&gt; he said the Lord is going to bless you. Amen. &gt;&gt; God is not a man that he should lie. &gt;&gt; Everything he said in his word, he's going to do it. &gt;&gt; Just not to testify. Some of us we my name my name is Shaedi. So my second name is say which is a which is a Muslim name. So because my father my people they died Muslims. So we are pro light to the Islam you know we believe this message. Not only did we change to be Christian, but to be a message believer. So we've seen God move in our lives. We've seen the power of the God. We've seen the power of the Holy Ghost. We've seen so many wonders that the Lord has done. So I just want to say if he has done it for anyone else, he will do it for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Shall we just bow our heads and pray? Lord Jesus Christ, the lover of all soul, we thank you. appreciate you Lord. Father, dear God, so many testimonies have been said, Father, all everything is pointing to you.
