[43:09] and
[43:11] i read isaiah 9 on last week
[43:14] but i want to read
[43:16] luke chapter 2 today
[43:19] praise god and it says here in verse 1
[43:25] uh it came to pass in those days that
[43:27] there went out a decree from
[43:29] caesar augustus
[43:31] that all the world should be taxed
[43:34] and this taxing was first made when
[43:37] cerenius was governor of syria and all
[43:41] went to be taxed everyone into his own
[43:44] city
[43:45] and joseph also went up from
[43:48] galilee out of the city of nazareth and
[43:50] to dodea
[43:52] into the city of david
[43:56] uh yeah unto the city of david which is
[43:58] called bethlehem
[44:00] because he was of the house and lineage
[44:03] of david
[44:04] to be taxed with mary as a spouse wife
[44:07] being great with child
[44:09] and so was that while they were there
[44:11] the days were accomplished that she
[44:13] should be
[44:14] delivered
[44:16] she brought forth her firstborn son and
[44:18] wrapped him in swaddling clothes and
[44:20] laid him in a manger because there was
[44:24] no room
[44:26] for them in the end
[44:28] and there were in the same country
[44:31] shepherds abiding in the field keeping
[44:33] watch over their flock by night
[44:36] and lo the angel the lord came upon them
[44:38] and the glory of the lord shone round
[44:41] about them and they were sore afraid
[44:44] the angel said unto them fear not for
[44:47] behold i bring you good tidings of great
[44:49] joy which shall be
[44:51] to all people
[44:53] for unto you
[44:54] this day in the city of david
[44:57] is i mean a savior which is christ
[45:01] for unto you is born this day in the
[45:03] city of david
[45:04] a savior which is christ the lord
[45:07] and this shall be a sign
[45:12] a sign unto you ye shall find the bait
[45:15] wrapped in swallowing clothes lying in a
[45:17] manger
[45:18] and suddenly there was with the angel
[45:20] multitude of the heavenly host praising
[45:22] god and saying glory to god in the
[45:25] highest
[45:26] and on earth
[45:28] peace
[45:29] good will
[45:31] toward men
[45:33] and it came to pass as the angels were
[45:35] going away from them into heaven the
[45:36] shepherd said one to another let us
[45:39] now go even unto bethlehem and see this
[45:41] thing which has come to pass
[45:43] which the lord hath made known unto us
[45:45] and they came with haste and found mary
[45:47] and josephine
[45:49] the babe lying in a manger
[45:51] and when they had seen it they made
[45:53] known abroad the same which was told
[45:55] them concerning this child
[45:57] and all they that heard it wandered at
[46:00] those things which were told them by the
[46:02] shepherds but mary kept all these things
[46:05] and pondered them in her heart
[46:07] and the shepherds returned glorified and
[46:09] praising
[46:12] glorifying
[46:13] and praising god for all the things they
[46:15] they had heard and seen as it was told
[46:17] unto them and let's just go back to
[46:19] isaiah uh really quick isaiah 9.
[46:23] good to see sister rebecca and a
[46:25] precious daughter god bless you all amen

[49:20] want to start a man a subject today i
[49:24] don't think i will have the opportunity
[49:26] to finish this but we'll at least get it
[49:27] started
[49:29] i want to talk to you about
[49:31] peace is a person
[49:34] amen
[49:42] amen peace is a person
[49:46] and you know i just i i've been thinking
[49:48] on this and and
[49:50] and i don't know where the thought even
[49:53] dropped down and came to me but
[49:55] um
[49:57] i was you know doing something and just
[49:59] kind of struck me
[50:01] peace as a person
[50:03] and uh and and i thought about it and
[50:05] then you know we read there in the
[50:06] scripture
[50:07] uh in isaiah 9 what says for unto us a
[50:10] child is born unto us the son is given
[50:12] and the government shall be upon
[50:13] his shoulders and his name shall be
[50:15] called wonderful counselor the mighty
[50:18] god the everlasting father
[50:20] the prince of peace
[50:22] and just there in that scripture long it
[50:24] lets us know that this is a person you
[50:27] know it's not just a feeling
[50:29] it's not just an emotion amen but it's a
[50:32] person and and if you don't know this
[50:35] person
[50:36] if you don't know this person there is
[50:39] no there's no way possible
[50:42] that you can have peace
[50:45] right you you have to know this person
[50:48] you you have to know who the prince of
[50:50] peace is if if you're going to
[50:51] experience true peace
[50:55] right you know so so so we we want to
[50:58] just kind of take our time a man with
[51:00] this if we can this morning and and uh
[51:03] uh uh you know and you know let me just
[51:05] start with this quote out of why are
[51:07] people so tossed about uh and just just
[51:09] the title alone
[51:12] tells you that people don't have peace
[51:14] if they're tossed about they're moving
[51:16] from here and moving there and just all
[51:19] over the place they don't have peace
[51:24] glory to god
[51:25] amen but but by here you know the
[51:27] prophet says something in the message
[51:29] why are people so tossed about saying i
[51:32] was saying somewhere
[51:34] maybe here a few nights ago i wanted to
[51:36] preach so bad

[51:41] o'clock can you imagine that
[51:43] i just i just it was just something
[51:46] bubbling up in the prophet that he
[51:47] wanted to share and he didn't have a
[51:49] pulpit to go to so he made his bedroom a
[51:51] pulpit
[51:53] and he started preaching to his wife
[51:55] until 12 o'clock says just telling her
[51:57] of how gl now i'm going to tell you
[51:58] that's a real preacher
[52:00] a preacher and preached to one person is

[52:06] because god put something that's hard he
[52:07] had to get it released
[52:09] amen hallelujah let me
[52:11] get that started uh he said he said he
[52:13] says uh i wanted to preach so bad i

[56:23] find rest so you can find peace and it's
[56:26] all over he says it says it's all
[56:28] finished for the belief at calvary
[56:30] that's right all sickness may come
[56:34] and disappointments but the christians
[56:37] at rest knowing this
[56:39] that god is able to keep that which he
[56:43] has performed
[56:45] now i like that
[56:47] i like that notice the statement that he
[56:49] just made god is able to keep that which
[56:51] he has performed not what he promised
[56:54] but what he's already performed and what
[56:56] you're waiting on is for the performance
[56:58] that's taking place in the spiritual to
[57:00] manifest itself in the natural
[57:04] but a christian's at rest knowing that
[57:05] god's going to do what he said he's
[57:07] going to do
[57:08] all right he says that god's able to
[57:09] keep that with jesus before him knowing
[57:11] that no matter what the thing is or how
[57:13] it looks there's neither sickness sorrow
[57:17] death there's neither starvation or
[57:19] anything that can separate us from the
[57:21] love of god that is in jesus christ we
[57:24] are at rest
[57:26] just let the old ship toss any way she
[57:28] wants wants to the anchor
[57:31] hoes
[57:32] man this is a christian
[57:35] that's why you know when they when they
[57:36] come up with a new variant christians
[57:38] are not shaken we will do what we need
[57:41] to do praise god
[57:43] amen and protect ourselves and protect
[57:45] everybody else around us but we at rest
[57:47] we have peace
[57:49] we at peace what we gonna do about this
[57:51] we don't worry we don't we don't operate
[57:53] like that
[57:54] we pray
[57:55] amen we just let god be god in the midst
[57:58] of the situation
[58:00] hallelujah
[58:01] glory glory glory so you know as i was
[58:04] just thinking about that and you know
[58:06] how brother branham just had in his
[58:08] heart just to preach that and he woke
[58:09] his wife up and said look i just got to
[58:11] preach to you and preach for hours about
[58:13] rest about rest uh you know and i wonder
[58:17] what things he was going through in his
[58:18] own life to kind of cause him to come to
[58:20] that spot where he realized that the
[58:22] christian faith was solidly based upon
[58:24] rest
[58:25] amen i know sometimes you know we can
[58:28] look back through this year there's been
[58:29] some some major trials but church we've
[58:31] been resting
[58:33] amen god has given us peace in the midst
[58:35] of these thoughts
[58:36] glory to god and we still press it on
[58:39] now here uh as we talk about this piece
[58:42] is a person
[58:44] peace is a person
[58:46] we were looking a man at a couple
[58:49] scriptures amen here today and
[58:52] and uh one of them found in uh uh luke
[58:55] and as i was just kind of you know
[58:58] reading that and
[58:59] uh just you know just kind of thinking
[59:01] about it
[59:02] hear the lord jesus is announced
[59:05] in
[59:06] um at his birth
[59:09] verse 14 there in luke chapter two
[59:11] the the announcement was well i'm sorry
[59:13] verse 13 and 14. let's look at it and
[59:16] suddenly there was with the angel
[59:19] a multitude of the heavenly hosts
[59:22] praising god
[59:23] and saying that now you have to
[59:25] understand some that when a king is born
[59:27] there's always singing
[59:29] conducted when when a new king is born
[59:32] so here we have the king of kings and
[59:34] the lord of lords that is coming to
[59:36] earth and and we didn't have any earthly
[59:38] people to sing so god sent angels down
[59:42] amen to sing at the birth of the king of
[59:44] kings and the lord of lords says and
[59:46] suddenly there was with the angel
[59:48] multitude of the heavenly hosts praising
[59:50] god and saying glory to god in the
[59:52] highest and on earth peace
[59:56] good will
[59:58] toward men now now this this
[1:00:00] announcement that peace has come good
[1:00:02] will towards men at the birth of this
[1:00:05] child peace has come to the earth
[1:00:08] you know ever since the fall in the
[1:00:10] garden of eden there was no peace
[1:00:14] hallelujah there was no peace ever since
[1:00:17] we had to start facing death amen uh uh
[1:00:20] because they they took of that forbidden
[1:00:22] fruit you know there was no peace for
[1:00:25] man
[1:00:26] glory to god but when jesus was born now
[1:00:29] peace is being announced for the earth
[1:00:32] glory to god peace is a person
[1:00:36] hallelujah now i thought about this you
[1:00:39] know uh
[1:00:40] here this announcement of peace coming
[1:00:42] through the angels and everything and
[1:00:43] telling the shepherds where to go find
[1:00:46] the the christ child and and i thought
[1:00:48] about it at the time of his birth it
[1:00:51] really was a time of turmoil
[1:00:53] hallelujah amen herod had ordered that
[1:00:56] all the male children under two years
[1:00:58] old they were to be killed in efforts to
[1:01:01] eliminate amen the threat of this new
[1:01:04] king so this was actually a time of it
[1:01:06] was not a time of peace even though
[1:01:08] peace was announced hallelujah amen it
[1:01:11] was still a time of turmoil can i go a
[1:01:14] little further and i want to say this
[1:01:16] now amen it was not peace to those
[1:01:18] families that was losing their children
[1:01:21] because of harry's uh a decree amen it
[1:01:24] was also uh uh uh you know i mean
[1:01:27] anybody that was i mean as joseph and
[1:01:29] and mary had to go back even in the
[1:01:32] middle of her her pregnancy they're
[1:01:34] going back to the city to be taxed that
[1:01:36] was not peaceful for them
[1:01:39] hallelujah amen that was turmoil for
[1:01:41] them but yet peace was being carried by
[1:01:44] mary
[1:01:47] hallelujah
[1:01:49] amen the person of peace was being
[1:01:51] carried by mary
[1:01:53] and no matter what they did they could
[1:01:55] not they could not stop peace
[1:01:57] from coming forth to the earth
[1:02:00] oh hallelujah somebody
[1:02:02] amen here the other thing i want to just
[1:02:05] uh make mention so so if it was a a a
[1:02:08] tumultuous time that christ was being
[1:02:10] born
[1:02:12] i want us to think about this a little
[1:02:13] bit more because peace is more
[1:02:16] i believe something much greater than
[1:02:18] the way that we define it
[1:02:20] peace is a person
[1:02:22] glory to god look at this peace can only
[1:02:25] be realized when we accept christ into
[1:02:28] our hearts his salvation brings the
[1:02:32] inner change to the hearts of men and
[1:02:34] that's what gives them peace
[1:02:37] now i want to just say a couple things
[1:02:39] here stay with me here
[1:02:40] people
[1:02:42] are in constant search
[1:02:44] for
[1:02:47] all peace and and one of the one of the
[1:02:49] things you hear now one of the
[1:02:50] statements you hear is i'm looking for
[1:02:52] my inner peace
[1:02:55] my my inner peace
[1:02:57] and you know and and i want to just tell
[1:02:59] the church y'all be careful searching
[1:03:02] some of this stuff and listening to some
[1:03:04] of the stuff where people talk about
[1:03:05] this inner peace
[1:03:07] you know some of it a man sound okay
[1:03:10] but then other times it starts getting
[1:03:13] really
[1:03:15] questionable
[1:03:16] is that really a christian principle
[1:03:20] now i start i start researching some of
[1:03:22] it and and i just didn't even want to go
[1:03:24] through all the different things but
[1:03:26] they got people out there to tell you
[1:03:27] things you can do to get inner peace
[1:03:30] hallelujah one of the things they tell
[1:03:32] you to do is spend time with nature
[1:03:37] see we can start kind of getting in
[1:03:38] between now ain't none roman enjoying a
[1:03:41] mountain
[1:03:42] ain't nothing jordan roman enjoying a a
[1:03:44] a a river or the beach or i mean not now
[1:03:47] hallelujah here in florida we try to go
[1:03:49] to the beach to enjoy enjoy god's
[1:03:51] creation
[1:03:52] and then we don't have no peace
[1:03:57] hello somebody
[1:04:01] the way the way the people dressed on
[1:04:02] the beach we ain't got no peace
[1:04:05] i i can't enjoy god's creation looking
[1:04:07] at all this other stuff on the beach
[1:04:10] hallelujah right so so so here they tell
[1:04:13] you they say spend time with nature you
[1:04:15] can find your inner peace
[1:04:17] now they also tell you say uh in order
[1:04:19] to be uh have inner peace be 10 minutes
[1:04:22] early
[1:04:27] now i i can deduce what they're saying
[1:04:29] i can understand that you know if you're
[1:04:31] not scrambling right you got a little
[1:04:34] time just to think about what you're
[1:04:35] doing be 10 minutes early no now you
[1:04:38] know hallelujah for me that goes a
[1:04:39] little further
[1:04:41] because for church
[1:04:43] praise god the prophet told us be 30
[1:04:46] minutes early
[1:04:48] and that'll really allow you to get your
[1:04:50] mind settled
[1:04:53] hello somebody
[1:04:55] glory to god but they give me these
[1:04:56] little things be 10 minutes early
[1:04:58] another one say just slow down
[1:05:01] stop being in such a hurry all the time
[1:05:03] just slow down some of these things
[1:05:05] sound all right
[1:05:06] glory to god i'm not here to dispute any
[1:05:08] of that but but one of the other things
[1:05:10] they say here is be assertive
[1:05:13] in order to find your peace they tell
[1:05:15] you to be assertive and don't let
[1:05:17] anybody stand in your way
[1:05:20] for you to get your inner peace you got
[1:05:22] to be assertive and don't let nobody
[1:05:24] stand in your way
[1:05:26] now to me that sounds very selfish
[1:05:29] because you're only thinking about
[1:05:30] yourself
[1:05:31] many us many of us make decisions
[1:05:35] amen and not thinking about the impact
[1:05:37] on others
[1:05:38] but as a christian you know
[1:05:40] you want to know the way to make
[1:05:41] decisions god first
[1:05:44] other second
[1:05:46] yourself last
[1:05:50] but when we follow stuff like this to
[1:05:52] find our inner peace we forget about the
[1:05:54] christian principles
[1:05:56] god first
[1:05:58] of the second
[1:06:00] yourself last
[1:06:03] hallelujah that's the christian way to
[1:06:05] do things
[1:06:06] another thing they say uh you know in
[1:06:09] order to find your inner peace
[1:06:11] they say escape for a while
[1:06:16] where you gonna go
[1:06:19] where you gonna escape to and then let
[1:06:20] me just ask the question after you
[1:06:22] finish your escape
[1:06:25] and you get out your escape room
[1:06:27] and you come back out here to reality
[1:06:30] where's your peace
[1:06:33] because you're still dealing with the
[1:06:34] same thing you do i mean some people use
[1:06:36] drugs alcohol to try to a man to try to
[1:06:39] drink away some of the problems or smoke
[1:06:41] away some of the problems of what it's
[1:06:43] not some of the you can't do none of
[1:06:45] that to find peace
[1:06:47] peace is a person
[1:06:50] peace is a person
[1:06:52] see when you escape for a while when you
[1:06:54] return the situation is still staring
[1:06:56] you right in the face
[1:06:59] and your your stress level go right back
[1:07:01] up again and now you're looking for
[1:07:02] another trip to get away you just got
[1:07:03] back yesterday
[1:07:07] you just got back yesterday see that's
[1:07:09] because you're looking for peace in the
[1:07:10] wrong places
[1:07:12] peace is a
[1:07:14] person
[1:07:17] i want to add a scripture here
[1:07:19] all the people that's
[1:07:20] give me isaiah 48 and 22.
[1:07:26] if you don't know jesus
[1:07:29] you don't know peace
[1:07:34] here the bible says this
[1:07:36] there is no peace
[1:07:43] there is no peace
[1:07:46] saith the lord
[1:07:48] unto who
[1:07:50] unto the wicked
[1:07:52] so if you don't know jesus you don't
[1:07:54] know peace
[1:07:55] and i don't care how much of this stuff
[1:07:56] you follow if you don't know jesus
[1:07:58] you'll never have peace
[1:08:00] right i mean this wicked means people
[1:08:02] that are morally bad
[1:08:04] and also another definition says they
[1:08:06] are addicted to evil
[1:08:09] where the wicked you are addicted to
[1:08:11] evil i'd rather be addicted to god
[1:08:16] i'd rather be addicted to jesus right
[1:08:18] not addicted to evil
[1:08:21] but if you're addicted to evil you'll
[1:08:23] never have peace
[1:08:25] because there is no peace saith the lord
[1:08:29] further unto the wicked
[1:08:31] the other thing that i found here about
[1:08:33] this word wicked in the hebrew lexicon
[1:08:35] it says you're guilty of sin wicked
[1:08:37] means you're guilty of sin
[1:08:41] and if you're guilty of sin and you've
[1:08:43] never reconciled that with god you will
[1:08:45] never
[1:08:47] you'll never experience true peace
[1:08:52] in our
[1:08:53] webster's dictionary they say peace is
[1:08:55] defined
[1:08:57] amen as freedom from disturbance
[1:09:00] quiet
[1:09:02] tranquility this is why people like
[1:09:04] getting next to the water get into the
[1:09:05] mountains and they're trying to find
[1:09:07] that quiet and tranquility but i'ma tell
[1:09:09] you you can only find that in christ
[1:09:12] amen glory to god hallelujah they call
[1:09:15] it a mental calm a serenity
[1:09:17] uh and i was just thinking on myself
[1:09:20] uh uh oftentimes in families we look for
[1:09:23] this peace we want this quietness we
[1:09:25] want this tranquility we want this
[1:09:27] freedom from disturbance we want the
[1:09:29] mental calm we want the serenity we want
[1:09:31] we want all that inside of our families
[1:09:33] we want it on our jobs we want it
[1:09:34] everywhere we go we just want peace
[1:09:36] peace peace
[1:09:37] but i want to tell you that in families
[1:09:40] a man peace sometimes can be disrupted
[1:09:43] hallelujah peace can be disrupted and uh
[1:09:46] and i was just you know just thinking
[1:09:48] about this one family where peace was
[1:09:50] disrupted
[1:09:52] and uh it was david's household
[1:09:55] glory to god uh one time there come a
[1:09:58] situation that rose up in his house
[1:10:00] and um he had a a a a son
[1:10:04] ma that had a lust spirit on him
[1:10:07] and uh and you know uh our mind had this
[1:10:10] spirit on him and and he got one of his
[1:10:13] friends that gave him some bad counsel
[1:10:16] hallelujah this friend you know he said
[1:10:18] man what's the matter what you say well
[1:10:19] you know i really really i really love
[1:10:22] tamar tamar was his sister half sister
[1:10:25] you know i really loved him i said well
[1:10:27] you know you can um
[1:10:28] uh you can just act like you're sick
[1:10:31] and uh and when you act like you're sick
[1:10:33] ask your daddy just to send to ma with
[1:10:35] some baked goods and have her alone
[1:10:37] bring it to you and then you know you
[1:10:39] can do what you want to do when she's
[1:10:40] here and they say you know what that's
[1:10:42] pretty good counsel
[1:10:44] and he called he got he started acting
[1:10:47] like he was sick coughing and sneezing
[1:10:49] and sniffling and all kind of stuff
[1:10:51] daddy i'm sick but the thing i think
[1:10:53] that's going to make me get better is if
[1:10:55] you send tamar in here and i said daddy
[1:10:58] say okay if that'll make you better son
[1:11:00] your daughter my daughter can come and
[1:11:01] bring you bring you what you want to eat
[1:11:03] and and when he locked the doors put
[1:11:05] everybody out then then he took
[1:11:06] advantage of his sister but before he
[1:11:08] took advantage she said now look look
[1:11:10] look she tried to give him some counsel
[1:11:12] she says that look before you do this
[1:11:14] all you got to do is ask for daddy ask
[1:11:16] daddy for my hand and marriage you ain't
[1:11:18] got to shame me like this
[1:11:20] he didn't think that was good counsel he
[1:11:22] took advantage of her and then after he
[1:11:24] took advantage of a raptor i'm just
[1:11:26] giving you what the bible said after he
[1:11:28] raped her and then then he didn't put
[1:11:30] her out put it out of his uh out of his
[1:11:32] uh out of his room and didn't want
[1:11:34] nothing to do with it anymore
[1:11:37] here this household did not have peace
[1:11:40] and as tamar is leaving the scene
[1:11:42] her
[1:11:43] biological brother sees her his name is
[1:11:46] absalom
[1:11:47] you know what i found out church absalom
[1:11:50] means my father is peace
[1:11:55] his name his very name means my father
[1:11:59] is peace
[1:12:01] and he absalom sees uh what has happened
[1:12:03] to his sister and and you can tell even
[1:12:05] though he had a name that my father is
[1:12:08] peace absalom was not a man of peace
[1:12:12] see i don't care if your name might be
[1:12:14] representative of something you still
[1:12:16] got to meet the person of peace if you
[1:12:19] want to really have
[1:12:20] peace oh hallelujah somebody
[1:12:24] absalom said you know what this man did
[1:12:26] this i'ma just i'm gonna come up with a
[1:12:28] plan
[1:12:29] somehow some way i'ma kill this guy i'm
[1:12:31] not
[1:12:33] a disruption going through the family
[1:12:35] here here here i'm not i mean i'm not

[1:12:40] about two years for his plan to actually
[1:12:42] come to pass
[1:12:44] hallelujah he's been working on this
[1:12:45] thing for two years
[1:12:47] glory to god and finally when it gets to
[1:12:50] the spot he's like now we gonna have
[1:12:51] sheep here in time and i'm gonna invite
[1:12:53] all the king's sons and he said daddy
[1:12:55] just let all the boys come we want to

[1:13:21] we what we find is that they slayed
[1:13:23] omnom they killed him absalom end up in
[1:13:27] um
[1:13:28] he just ended up away from the family
[1:13:30] after he committed this this great
[1:13:32] tragedy in the family and it took years
[1:13:34] for them to bring him back into
[1:13:35] fellowship with the family
[1:13:37] sometimes we do things
[1:13:40] amen that caused us to be separated for
[1:13:42] years and we didn't have to do that we
[1:13:44] could have just walked in peace
[1:13:46] live according to your name
[1:13:54] here we find
[1:13:55] this same islam that said his father
[1:13:58] is named my father's peace the same guy
[1:14:01] rises up when he comes back because he
[1:14:03] doesn't come back with the same spirit
[1:14:05] he still he's still got problems and now
[1:14:08] he finds himself trying to a man take
[1:14:10] the kingdom from his own daddy
[1:14:12] but his name meant my father is peace
[1:14:16] but his actions show something totally
[1:14:18] different
[1:14:19] it shows us that a man
[1:14:21] peace is much deeper than just our name
[1:14:27] peace and peace is much deeper than just
[1:14:29] the family that we associate it to
[1:14:32] peace is much deeper than that peace is
[1:14:35] a person
[1:14:38] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah let me
[1:14:41] just kind of work with this a little bit
[1:14:43] i want to say that uh peace
[1:14:46] i want to go to another quote here peace
[1:14:48] is something much deeper
[1:14:51] than tranquility and
[1:14:53] and the state of mind and all these
[1:14:55] other things that they're trying to give
[1:14:56] us peace really is a person
[1:14:59] and i'ma tell you
[1:15:00] when you get to know the lord jesus
[1:15:05] in a very real way
[1:15:07] he can give you the peace that passeth
[1:15:09] all understanding
[1:15:11] but it's only by knowing him let me let
[1:15:13] me just show you something because this
[1:15:15] piece that we're talking about when you
[1:15:16] get to know jesus is not just a peace
[1:15:18] that you have here on earth
[1:15:21] but it's a peace that you can have even
[1:15:23] when you leave in the earth
[1:15:28] even when you're dying you can have this
[1:15:31] peace
[1:15:32] see peace on earth good will toward all
[1:15:34] men there's a if you meet this person
[1:15:37] the prince of peace you can really have
[1:15:39] something special
[1:15:41] i want to show you something here in
[1:15:42] this message
[1:15:44] who is this melchizedek
[1:15:46] look at this
[1:15:51] it says a theophany is something
[1:15:55] that you cannot see it could be right
[1:15:56] here now yet you cannot see it
[1:16:00] it's just like well like television this
[1:16:03] that's in another dimension television
[1:16:05] people are moving right through this
[1:16:06] room now singing
[1:16:09] there is colors also
[1:16:11] but the eye is only subject to the five
[1:16:13] senses
[1:16:14] your whole being is only subject to the
[1:16:17] five senses rather and you are only
[1:16:19] subject to what the site has been
[1:16:21] limited to see
[1:16:22] but there is another dimension that can
[1:16:24] be seen by a transformation by
[1:16:26] television
[1:16:28] now television does not manufacture a
[1:16:30] picture
[1:16:31] television only channels it into a
[1:16:33] circuit and then the television screen
[1:16:36] picks it up
[1:16:37] but the picture is there
[1:16:40] to begin with television was here when
[1:16:42] adam was here television was here when
[1:16:45] elijah sat on mount carmel television
[1:16:48] was here when jesus of nazareth walked
[1:16:50] the shores of galilee but you're just
[1:16:53] now discovering it they wouldn't have
[1:16:55] believed it back there you'd have been
[1:16:57] crazy to have said something like it but
[1:16:59] now it's become a reality and so is it
[1:17:02] that christ is here the angels of god
[1:17:05] are here and someday in the great
[1:17:07] millennium to come it'll be just more
[1:17:10] real than television or anything else
[1:17:12] because they are here he reveals himself
[1:17:15] in his great form of what he claimed and
[1:17:17] he and morphed himself into servants and
[1:17:20] proves himself
[1:17:22] he says now he now here he is in the
[1:17:25] form of spirit and when he comes in the
[1:17:27] form of in morphy now he appeared to
[1:17:29] abraham and morphy when abraham was
[1:17:31] returning from the slaughter of the
[1:17:33] kings here come melchizedek talk to him
[1:17:35] now i'm i'm i just gotta i'm uh
[1:17:38] i'm gonna inject there let me let me see
[1:17:40] if i can slip i'm trying to slip past
[1:17:43] that i really am yeah
[1:17:45] oh my i got to see it
[1:17:50] i got to see it um
[1:17:52] brother random just introduced something
[1:17:54] there in that quote and i'm going in
[1:17:55] this quote in a little bit
[1:17:57] but when abraham
[1:17:59] was
[1:18:01] uh
[1:18:02] out in the plains of mamrie
[1:18:04] and he got the word that lot had been
[1:18:07] captured see here's another family that
[1:18:08] had gone through a disruption and uh and
[1:18:11] they were just in chaos
[1:18:13] and here lot and his family was was was
[1:18:15] taken uh captive and abraham got word
[1:18:18] that you know what lot has been taken
[1:18:21] and uh five kings came together these
[1:18:24] number of kings came together and nate
[1:18:25] they took they took out sodom and took
[1:18:26] out gamora and they captured a lot has
[1:18:28] gone with them abraham said i can't let
[1:18:30] my my loved ones stay out there like
[1:18:32] that
[1:18:33] oh hallelujah i can't let lot go i mean
[1:18:36] be in captivity like that i mean lot
[1:18:39] made a bad decision that put him in the
[1:18:42] wrong place amen and now he's captured
[1:18:44] and now he said now he's really in
[1:18:46] trouble i can't let him stay like that
[1:18:48] so abraham got his servants all they got
[1:18:51] was some some pitchforks and some
[1:18:53] shovels and amen and whatever they could
[1:18:55] find around uh the gardening house and
[1:18:57] they took off to go to battle no swords
[1:18:59] no no no no guns none of that they just
[1:19:02] took off of what they had to go face
[1:19:04] these kingdoms
[1:19:06] and abraham went out there and he
[1:19:07] conquered and he was able to get locked
[1:19:09] and bring lot back and he got all these
[1:19:11] spots and he brought it back god was
[1:19:13] with abraham to help him overcome in
[1:19:15] that battle but as abraham was on his
[1:19:17] way back abraham met
[1:19:20] somebody met the man by the that's king
[1:19:23] by the main name of melchizedek and the
[1:19:27] bible says it means king of salem
[1:19:30] which also means king of
[1:19:33] peace
[1:19:34] peace is a person
[1:19:39] oh hallelujah abraham met the person of
[1:19:42] peace in the book of genesis and we can
[1:19:45] still meet the person of peace today
[1:19:48] peace is a person not only is he a king
[1:19:51] of peace he's also the prince of peace
[1:19:54] peace is a person
[1:19:59] [Applause]
[1:20:00] he's a real being
[1:20:02] he's a real being i told you this person
[1:20:05] when you when you come to know him it's
[1:20:06] not just peace
[1:20:08] in this life in which we're living i
[1:20:10] mean we we can have peace no matter what
[1:20:13] storm we're facing
[1:20:15] i mentioned on last week how to you know
[1:20:17] the the disciples were inside the boat
[1:20:20] and when while they were in the boat
[1:20:22] they thought for sure that they were
[1:20:24] going to drown here jesus said let's go
[1:20:25] to the other side just gave him a
[1:20:26] command let's go to the other side and
[1:20:28] as they're getting just rolling
[1:20:30] jesus was so tired he went back and laid
[1:20:32] down in the back of the boat i mean fell
[1:20:34] asleep i'm talking about
[1:20:37] slobbing
[1:20:38] snoring
[1:20:40] i mean a deep sleep
[1:20:42] and you know and i can just imagine i'm
[1:20:44] kind of like that look oh
[1:20:46] man when it's time for me to go down
[1:20:49] i'm going down
[1:20:51] you can be talking to me and i'm gone

[1:20:56] look sleep has hit me
[1:21:00] and please don't wake me up i'm i'm here
[1:21:03] i've i've reached this this ultimate
[1:21:05] place

[1:21:08] praise the lord let nature take his
[1:21:10] course i'll wake up on my own right but
[1:21:12] but by here jesus is in the back of the
[1:21:14] boat just sleeping
[1:21:16] and the disciples are rowing and and
[1:21:18] they notice that the storm just comes
[1:21:20] out of nowhere it wasn't predicted by
[1:21:22] the weatherman that this storm was
[1:21:23] coming and here the storm just shows up
[1:21:25] out in out of nowhere so so the
[1:21:28] disciples maybe are sitting there
[1:21:29] scrounging like should we wake jesus
[1:21:32] they said no he's sleeping man let him
[1:21:33] sleep you know he tired he'd been doing
[1:21:35] this he'd been doing that just let him
[1:21:36] sleep
[1:21:37] maybe peter said look i can't let him
[1:21:39] sleep we about to die and maybe peter's
[1:21:42] going to shake jesus
[1:21:44] jesus
[1:21:45] you know how peter is he got he got a
[1:21:47] real funny spirit
[1:21:49] jesus do you even care that we about to
[1:21:52] perish you healing this one you healing
[1:21:55] that one but look at us out here about
[1:21:56] to die
[1:21:58] jesus just look at peter

[1:22:06] foot up on the front of the boat

[1:22:14] see the person of peace
[1:22:17] is speaking peace
[1:22:20] peace
[1:22:21] be still and when he spoke it the wind
[1:22:24] stopped
[1:22:25] the waves stopped and he went back and
[1:22:27] laid down
[1:22:28] and the disciples had a conversation
[1:22:31] they looked at each other and oh
[1:22:34] and finally somebody just let it out
[1:22:37] their mouth what matter
[1:22:39] of man is this
[1:22:41] that the wings and the seeds obey i can
[1:22:44] tell you who he is boys he is peace
[1:22:50] he is peace and i want to tell you i
[1:22:52] don't care how much your boat in life is
[1:22:54] rocking this morning
[1:22:57] jesus the person of peace is here to

[1:23:11] you just gotta activate peace
[1:23:14] peace is laying inside of you
[1:23:17] [Applause]
[1:23:19] he's a person
[1:23:21] if you feel with the holy ghost he's a
[1:23:23] person
[1:23:24] and he gives you you don't have to go
[1:23:26] seek an inner peace
[1:23:28] it's already there
[1:23:30] if you would just learn
[1:23:31] to rest
[1:23:34] let me keep reading this who is this
[1:23:36] melchizedek
[1:23:39] says the other day
[1:23:42] in the tucson paper
[1:23:44] i was reading an article
[1:23:47] there were there was a woman driving
[1:23:49] down the road i believe about 40 50
[1:23:51] miles an hour
[1:23:53] and she hit an old man with an overcoat
[1:23:55] on
[1:23:56] she screamed and stopped her car
[1:23:59] it threw him up in the
[1:24:00] air right out in the plain desert
[1:24:04] she run back to find him and he wasn't
[1:24:06] there
[1:24:08] so what did she do
[1:24:10] some people behind her saw it happen
[1:24:13] saw the old man fly up in the air and
[1:24:15] it's overcoat turning
[1:24:17] so they run back to find out they
[1:24:19] couldn't find the man anywhere they
[1:24:21] called the police force the police come
[1:24:23] out to examine the place there was
[1:24:25] nobody there
[1:24:27] well each one of them testified the car
[1:24:29] chugged hit the man he went up in the
[1:24:32] air
[1:24:33] and and everybody saw witnesses and two
[1:24:35] or three carlos of them they seen it
[1:24:38] happen come to find out
[1:24:40] five years ago
[1:24:42] there was an old man with an overcoat on
[1:24:45] hit and killed on the same spot
[1:24:48] look at this when you leave here
[1:24:50] you're not dead
[1:24:52] you've got to come back even
[1:24:55] if you're a sinner
[1:24:57] and be judged according to the deeds
[1:24:59] done in the body if this earth the
[1:25:02] tabernacle is dissolved we have we have
[1:25:04] one waiting and morphy that's the word
[1:25:06] so what i thought about is that when
[1:25:08] this man died
[1:25:10] he did not have
[1:25:12] peace
[1:25:15] he didn't have peace
[1:25:17] right and remember what the scripture
[1:25:18] says in in isaiah uh 48 you know there
[1:25:22] is no peace says the lord unto the
[1:25:24] wicked
[1:25:25] hallelujah so when this man died he
[1:25:27] didn't have peace but when you meet the
[1:25:30] person of peace
[1:25:31] and you have him in your heart even
[1:25:33] death
[1:25:35] even in death you can have freedom from
[1:25:38] disturbance oh i like that
[1:25:41] i want to say that again
[1:25:42] when you meet the person of peace
[1:25:45] and you have him in your heart
[1:25:48] even in death you can have freedom from
[1:25:52] disturbance
[1:25:53] you can have quietness
[1:25:55] you can have tranquility you can have
[1:25:58] peace
[1:26:00] because peace is a person
[1:26:04] let's look at this amen glory to god
[1:26:06] glory to god here in this message to
[1:26:09] whom shall we go
[1:26:15] to whom shall we go
[1:26:17] the prophet says this
[1:26:19] then another thing fifthly i have to say
[1:26:22] this
[1:26:23] he's the only successful
[1:26:27] and secured happiness
[1:26:29] and peace he talked about the lord jesus
[1:26:31] he's the only successful
[1:26:33] and secured happiness and peace that's
[1:26:36] the reason we come to him
[1:26:38] oh i know you can laugh like an idiot
[1:26:42] or you can get out here and laugh till
[1:26:44] you go into hysterics at some joke that
[1:26:46] some movie star popped off of something
[1:26:48] and you know now even in church
[1:26:50] they have churches that are set up to
[1:26:52] that when you come they just
[1:26:54] have everybody laugh
[1:26:56] they just keep laughing and you just see
[1:26:58] people just just laughing and then you
[1:27:00] know and you know how sometimes um the
[1:27:03] thing might not even be funny
[1:27:05] it might not be funny what somebody's
[1:27:06] saying but sometimes you can you can see
[1:27:09] somebody else laughing
[1:27:10] and it'll make you laugh
[1:27:12] right but here they go to church and
[1:27:14] that's the whole service just just
[1:27:16] standing around laughing pastors start
[1:27:18] laughing then this will start laughing
[1:27:21] and they say laughing laugh laughter is
[1:27:23] like a medicine you know but after you
[1:27:25] after you stop laughing you still got
[1:27:27] problems
[1:27:29] right how long you can't laugh them
[1:27:30] problems away but you'll still have
[1:27:33] problems after you after you're not
[1:27:34] stopped laughing but but by here you
[1:27:36] know uh brother branham is saying this
[1:27:37] he says um you can laugh like an idiot
[1:27:40] or you can get out there get out here
[1:27:42] and laugh till you go into hysterics at
[1:27:43] some joke that some movie star popped
[1:27:45] off or something or somebody you might
[1:27:48] get a little too much to drink and laugh
[1:27:50] like you was
[1:27:51] with some loon
[1:27:53] but that don't bring peace
[1:27:55] says there is there is no other peace
[1:27:58] and no other happiness like coming to
[1:28:02] jesus christ
[1:28:03] it says i've seen people put on
[1:28:06] i've seen young women try to brush their
[1:28:09] selves around with their new frocks on
[1:28:12] and act like they were happy they're not
[1:28:16] amen he says that they're only building
[1:28:18] a painted fire you can't warm by a
[1:28:21] painted fire you've seen young men that
[1:28:24] try to think his muscles were so big
[1:28:26] that you could drive a nail down and
[1:28:28] never touch him and a knife would bend
[1:28:30] his blade on them just give him a few
[1:28:32] years and he's turned back old enrico
[1:28:35] there's no eternal happiness
[1:28:38] outside of christ
[1:28:41] oh i love this to whom shall we go he
[1:28:43] says looky here
[1:28:45] i'll put any of you here tonight in
[1:28:47] perfect health
[1:28:48] your family in perfect health all around
[1:28:51] you what about mama that's not here how
[1:28:54] do you know that's your dad amen how do
[1:28:56] you know your dad's not dying now how do
[1:28:58] you know that the uh the one of the
[1:29:00] children didn't get killed a few minutes
[1:29:02] ago away from here how do you know that
[1:29:04] something else hasn't happened how do
[1:29:06] you know you're going out of this
[1:29:07] building tonight you may drop in a heart
[1:29:10] attack you don't know so there's no
[1:29:11] eternal happiness outside of christ
[1:29:14] that's the reason we must come to him
[1:29:16] you can have whiskey you can have
[1:29:18] pleasure you can have the things of the
[1:29:19] world but they're not successful
[1:29:22] happiness nothing can can give peace
[1:29:24] like him he gives a peace so you say i
[1:29:27] got peace
[1:29:29] some people feel like if i get into this
[1:29:30] relationship
[1:29:32] i'm gonna have peace
[1:29:33] if i if i can hang with this friend then
[1:29:36] i'm gonna have peace if i can do this in
[1:29:37] my career then i'm gonna have peace none
[1:29:39] of those things bring peace
[1:29:42] hallelujah the only way you can have
[1:29:44] peace is to have jesus
[1:29:47] glory to god glory to god i mean you
[1:29:50] know even right now you can get the best
[1:29:52] job in the world
[1:29:53] but at some point in time then bill's
[1:29:55] still going to get power this high with
[1:29:56] the best job
[1:29:58] and you're gonna you're gonna find
[1:29:59] yourself like oh lord how are we gonna
[1:30:00] get through this and see when you get to
[1:30:02] that point your piece just went right
[1:30:04] out the window i'm talking about your
[1:30:05] personal piece
[1:30:07] but when you got him as your peace
[1:30:09] glory to god nothing changes you're not
[1:30:12] stressed you're not worried god got this
[1:30:13] all worked out
[1:30:15] let me go on a little bit from this
[1:30:16] quote it says if you ever
[1:30:18] got real peace
[1:30:20] you got jesus
[1:30:23] if you ever got real real peace
[1:30:27] you got jesus if you haven't got jesus
[1:30:31] you don't even know what peace what what
[1:30:33] what uh know what peace means can i say
[1:30:35] that again
[1:30:37] if you don't if you haven't got jesus
[1:30:40] you don't even know what peace means so
[1:30:42] all that studying on the internet and
[1:30:44] trying to find these different steps for
[1:30:46] inner peace that ain't gonna get you
[1:30:47] there
[1:30:48] you must know jesus
[1:30:52] and you say well i got him
[1:30:54] i know jesus but i still ain't got no
[1:30:55] peace but you need to start praying a
[1:30:57] little bit more
[1:30:59] hallelujah because i i i i've had it
[1:31:02] happen to me many times in my life
[1:31:05] you get into a little fix somewhere and
[1:31:07] you just begin to call on the lord jesus
[1:31:09] and all of a sudden there's a peace that

[1:37:53] i got peace like oh that's right when
[1:37:56] when you got peace you got christ christ
[1:37:58] is your peace so that's why we must come
[1:38:01] to christ to find
[1:38:03] peace
[1:38:04] let me just jump and just give a couple
[1:38:06] of the things here
[1:38:08] another definition that they gave for
[1:38:09] this word peace at a website says
[1:38:13] it's a state or
[1:38:14] period where there is no war
[1:38:18] or war has ended
[1:38:22] and when i when i thought about that a
[1:38:23] state of period where where there's no
[1:38:25] war or wars ended i thought about peace
[1:38:27] treaties
[1:38:28] that different nations might sign with
[1:38:30] one another
[1:38:32] and you know and there was a a peace
[1:38:34] treaty one time in scripture
[1:38:37] that was
[1:38:38] uh that was that was presented
[1:38:40] and it was goliath that was presenting
[1:38:42] this peace treaty
[1:38:44] his his words amen here in first samuel
[1:38:47] 17 verse 8 through 9. this is his peace
[1:38:50] treaty first samuel 17 verse 8 and 9
[1:38:52] says
[1:38:53] and he stood and cried unto the armies
[1:38:55] of israel
[1:38:57] and said unto them
[1:38:58] why are you come out to set your battle
[1:39:01] in a ray
[1:39:02] am not am not i a philistine he servants
[1:39:05] to saul
[1:39:06] choose you a man for you and let him
[1:39:09] come down to me
[1:39:10] if he be able to fight with me and to
[1:39:13] kill me
[1:39:14] then will we be your servants but if i
[1:39:17] prevail against him and kill him then
[1:39:20] shall then shall ye be our servants and
[1:39:23] serve us so this is a goliath peace
[1:39:26] treaty amen that he gives them say if i
[1:39:28] win in the battle just give me one man
[1:39:30] we got to have all this bloodshed just
[1:39:32] give me one man and if if i win y'all
[1:39:35] serve us and if if y'all if he wins then
[1:39:37] we'll serve y'all this is the peace
[1:39:39] treaty
[1:39:40] and i thought about this you know uh how
[1:39:43] many nations have tried to use peace
[1:39:44] treaties but none of them ever work
[1:39:47] most of them never work at some point in
[1:39:49] time the peace treaty is broken it's
[1:39:51] because they need more than just a
[1:39:53] treaty they need the person of the lord
[1:39:55] jesus dwelling on the inside if they
[1:39:58] really want to have peace
[1:40:00] here goliath makes this this great
[1:40:02] boasting and he asked for them to do
[1:40:05] this and you know and and they go all
[1:40:07] these days and one day david is sending
[1:40:09] to the camp to bring some food to his
[1:40:11] brothers and he hears goliath makes his
[1:40:12] posts like now
[1:40:14] what the king gonna do for the man that
[1:40:15] go out and fight this guy say he'll give
[1:40:17] him his daughter he'll do this well i
[1:40:18] didn't really think about all that i'm
[1:40:20] just tired of seeing this man scare all
[1:40:22] the all the armies of the living god so
[1:40:24] i'll go out and fight him and david went
[1:40:26] out and fought goliath we all know the
[1:40:28] story he went out and fought him took
[1:40:29] those five smooth stones and picked him
[1:40:32] up and and he threw one stone at goliath
[1:40:34] and the first stone hit him right in the
[1:40:36] center of his head
[1:40:38] killed him knocked him out david took
[1:40:40] his sword cut off his head and you
[1:40:42] thought they would have had peace
[1:40:45] but they didn't
[1:40:48] because you know what happened in
[1:40:49] david's life later on
[1:40:51] the same guy he just killed
[1:40:53] the same peace treaty just signed
[1:40:56] david joined that army
[1:40:58] and also was getting ready to fight
[1:41:00] against israel
[1:41:01] you talk about no peace for the wicked
[1:41:06] see peace is a person
[1:41:09] and and and they went through all of
[1:41:11] this you know and and they still did not
[1:41:13] have peace i'm reminded of of a
[1:41:14] scripture here in job 3 17 it says there
[1:41:19] glory to god the wicked cease from
[1:41:21] troubling and the weary be at rest and
[1:41:24] what job is said is that when we get to
[1:41:26] the other side that's when we're really
[1:41:27] going to have some peace
[1:41:30] glory that's when you're really gonna
[1:41:31] have tranquility but to get to the other
[1:41:34] side
[1:41:35] come on somebody if you talk about going
[1:41:37] to the other side to get to the other
[1:41:39] side you got to experience the person of
[1:41:42] peace on this side
[1:41:46] amen
[1:41:47] oh i love this
[1:41:51] genesis
[1:41:52] uh
[1:41:54] 31 laban and jacob came together and
[1:41:58] and and and you know there was no peace
[1:42:00] in that household too that family was
[1:42:01] totally disrupted with some of the
[1:42:03] things that had happened
[1:42:04] uh what we found there is laban his
[1:42:07] daughter's uh uh first you know he trick
[1:42:10] he trick tricked jacob into marion leah
[1:42:13] he wanted rachel and he got leah and uh
[1:42:16] and then when it was time for them to
[1:42:18] leave he said you know your dad doesn't
[1:42:19] change my wages ten times and i'm kind
[1:42:20] of getting tired i need to i need to
[1:42:22] leave here now the reason
[1:42:23] jacob had left home is because
[1:42:26] at his house
[1:42:30] in his house with his mom and daddy
[1:42:33] he had done something that disrupted
[1:42:37] peace
[1:42:39] he did something that disrupted
[1:42:40] tranquility in this house
[1:42:42] and he had to take off and run for it
[1:42:44] and now he gets down there and gets a
[1:42:46] wipe and now i don't think that
[1:42:48] let me just let me just say it like this
[1:42:50] don't think you can do something wrong
[1:42:52] over here and that you're going to get
[1:42:53] over there and it's going to be all all
[1:42:55] right
[1:42:57] what you did wrong over here
[1:42:59] going to follow you
[1:43:02] it's going to follow you
[1:43:04] and here jacob thought he got us in and
[1:43:06] and his mama said just send them to my
[1:43:07] brother you know all right he gonna go
[1:43:09] but when he got that to the brother then
[1:43:11] they had what he sold over there he was
[1:43:13] reaping over here
[1:43:17] hey hey hey hey hey
[1:43:20] here here he's over here reaping and he
[1:43:21] says uh
[1:43:23] say yeah i i work for seven years for
[1:43:26] your daughter
[1:43:27] i want rachel i i work seven years and i
[1:43:30] wanna tell y'all sisters if a young man
[1:43:31] won't work for you
[1:43:36] he don't love you
[1:43:38] i don't care how much he said out of his
[1:43:40] mouth if his actions don't show it he
[1:43:42] don't love you if he won't work for you
[1:43:45] hallelujah
[1:43:47] but here you know jacob jacob says yeah
[1:43:48] i work seven years for her i work seven
[1:43:50] you say okay i let you work seven years
[1:43:52] and he worked him seven years and boy he
[1:43:53] was so happy going to work you got to
[1:43:55] have a reason to go to work
[1:44:00] and say i'm going out here and i'm
[1:44:01] working for what i'm working for and man
[1:44:03] seven years went by it's just like
[1:44:05] yesterday and he got ready for his
[1:44:07] wedding night and
[1:44:08] good god almighty he was so excited
[1:44:11] dumb said his vows
[1:44:13] done did everything
[1:44:15] then when he says his vows and said okay
[1:44:17] y'all can go to the tent and
[1:44:19] you know say well praise the lord and
[1:44:20] get there and he lift the veil
[1:44:25] i can't believe this man just did me
[1:44:26] like to see all your deception
[1:44:28] just caught up with you
[1:44:31] hallelujah
[1:44:32] i mean you got to watch deception
[1:44:34] there's a spirit of deception that just
[1:44:36] follows you right and says all that
[1:44:38] deception because but we be scheming all
[1:44:39] kind of stuff scheming this and scheming
[1:44:42] that no no no no you ain't got peace if
[1:44:44] you're scheming
[1:44:46] because when you got peace you let god
[1:44:47] do it
[1:44:51] and i'ma tell you something if you gonna
[1:44:53] do it
[1:44:54] god ain't gonna do it god just gonna sit
[1:44:56] back and just let you work yourself to
[1:44:58] death
[1:44:59] and then you're gonna get to a point
[1:45:01] like lord i need you i've been waiting
[1:45:03] all this time to keep you give me the
[1:45:04] help that you need i've been waiting for
[1:45:05] you to get out of the way
[1:45:09] and there there jacob jacob jacob said i
[1:45:12] can't believe it now jacob ain't got no
[1:45:13] peace
[1:45:14] he says okay i'll tell you what you know
[1:45:17] you don't trick me you don't did they
[1:45:18] say well look we got this law and i
[1:45:19] never even told him about the law he'd
[1:45:21] been there seven years and never even
[1:45:22] heard nothing about this law
[1:45:24] we got this law we don't let the second
[1:45:25] one get married before the first one
[1:45:27] well i honor your law well i have to say
[1:45:30] you could work another seven years for
[1:45:31] the others i did but now he didn't work
[1:45:33] another seven he just finished a week
[1:45:35] and he got uh leah i mean rachel he got
[1:45:38] rachel but he had to work another seven
[1:45:39] years to pay off the debt
[1:45:41] and here he's 14 years like this and
[1:45:43] finally gets to the point and say i'm
[1:45:44] leaving
[1:45:45] and when they leave
[1:45:47] he tells his wives lee and rachel that
[1:45:50] they're leaving with all the kids and
[1:45:51] when they leave
[1:45:53] he says um
[1:45:55] you know we got to go and i'm just you
[1:45:57] know i i i can't take no more your
[1:45:59] daddy's doing this and your dad is doing
[1:46:00] that we got to go
[1:46:02] say okay we with you we we going with
[1:46:04] you but leah i'm sorry rachel snuck in
[1:46:07] there
[1:46:08] stole her daddy's false gods
[1:46:15] and then took off with with jacob now
[1:46:17] she never told jacob that she stole this
[1:46:20] stuff
[1:46:21] so here's jacob going and and he thought
[1:46:24] man we don't separate it and we're going
[1:46:26] and
[1:46:26] and and and he hear laban just coming
[1:46:28] behind him they even just know why is
[1:46:30] this man coming and so you can tell by
[1:46:32] the way he's riding
[1:46:34] you can tell what he's getting ready to
[1:46:36] do this man got some problems with me so
[1:46:38] he said he said uh uh
[1:46:40] so let me find out what's going on he
[1:46:41] says uh he said look i i'm okay with you
[1:46:44] going and you're going back to your
[1:46:45] family i understand all that but why you
[1:46:47] had to steal the gods man steal your
[1:46:49] gods why you accused me of this
[1:46:52] he said go through the ten and five who
[1:46:53] got your gods and kill that person that
[1:46:55] got you god oh lord the very one that he
[1:46:57] loved the most
[1:46:59] got the gods
[1:47:02] and here she has to deceive again
[1:47:05] she has the light of her daddy she's
[1:47:07] sitting on the guards and telling her
[1:47:08] daddy
[1:47:09] i'm experiencing this time of life right
[1:47:12] now and and i can't get up but she's
[1:47:14] sitting on the gods and the man could
[1:47:16] not find the gods anywhere in the tent
[1:47:18] and finally when when when laban leaves
[1:47:21] and he they had they they actually made
[1:47:23] a peace treaty
[1:47:25] and that's when laban left
[1:47:27] then it was revealed to to to jacob said
[1:47:30] yeah i got my daddy gods
[1:47:32] you got your daddy gods you almost get
[1:47:35] killed
[1:47:36] all of us killed by doing something like
[1:47:38] that
[1:47:39] see there was no peace in that family
[1:47:42] they didn't have the personal peace
[1:47:43] dwelling on the inside you know only
[1:47:45] person that can change your nature
[1:47:51] the only person that can change your
[1:47:53] very nature
[1:47:56] is jesus christ
[1:48:04] let me uh
[1:48:06] i already mentioned this before and i i
[1:48:08] told you i
[1:48:10] oh man i got so so so many little things
[1:48:13] that i want to just kind of drop off
[1:48:14] here let me let me let me i'm going to
[1:48:16] skip something here
[1:48:22] and when i was looking this this word up
[1:48:24] piece
[1:48:29] and just the the dictionary definition
[1:48:32] they had some phrases
[1:48:34] that they use along with this word
[1:48:36] and they talk about
[1:48:38] how people use the thing
[1:48:40] i'm at peace
[1:48:42] i'm at peace and what this means is it's
[1:48:45] a it's a euphemistic
[1:48:47] free from anxiety or distress
[1:48:50] and sometimes we use that word that i'm
[1:48:52] at peace
[1:48:53] and that's only for a few minutes
[1:48:56] you get another telephone call another
[1:48:58] text another email and now you're a
[1:48:59] piece done shot at the window somewhere
[1:49:03] you're in an uproar you're no longer at
[1:49:05] peace but you like that you like to make
[1:49:07] yourself think
[1:49:10] that you're at peace but the only way
[1:49:12] you can be at peace is if jesus is
[1:49:14] giving you that peace
[1:49:16] another statement that they says uh uh
[1:49:20] to be at peace is also
[1:49:24] to be dead
[1:49:26] so somebody dies we say
[1:49:28] they're at peace
[1:49:30] but remember i said
[1:49:32] there is no
[1:49:33] peace saith the lord
[1:49:35] for the wicked
[1:49:37] so it's only in christ that you can
[1:49:39] really be at peace everybody like to say
[1:49:42] this
[1:49:43] when they die or they went to a better
[1:49:44] place did they
[1:49:48] are you sure
[1:49:50] because i ain't the one saying that i
[1:49:52] don't know where they went
[1:49:54] uh it's not my job to put them nowhere i
[1:49:56] don't know but i mean some people i can
[1:49:58] tell the way they they live on this side
[1:50:01] they had peace
[1:50:02] but everybody i can't say that about i
[1:50:04] just gave you a story how this man kept
[1:50:06] getting hit over and over again he was
[1:50:08] not at peace a dead man being hit
[1:50:14] they got another one that they like to
[1:50:15] use
[1:50:20] keep the peace
[1:50:22] and that means we're refrain or prevent
[1:50:24] others
[1:50:26] from disturbing civil order
[1:50:29] in order to keep the peace you have to
[1:50:31] refrain or you have to help prevent
[1:50:33] others
[1:50:34] from disturbing
[1:50:35] civil order
[1:50:37] another one they use is rest in peace
[1:50:41] and that's stated for a person that has
[1:50:42] to cease and uh uh but like i said you
[1:50:45] can't rest in peace if you don't know
[1:50:47] jesus
[1:50:48] and here's another one that i want to
[1:50:49] give you
[1:50:51] hold your peace
[1:50:58] oh god you want to know what it mean to
[1:51:00] hold your peace
[1:51:02] that means remain silent about something
[1:51:08] oh god
[1:51:11] lord hallelujah
[1:51:14] hold your peace mean remain silent but
[1:51:16] don't say nothing my mama taught me a
[1:51:18] long time ago if you can't say
[1:51:22] nothing good
[1:51:24] don't say nothing at all
[1:51:26] hold
[1:51:27] your
[1:51:28] peace
[1:51:30] can i read down a few scriptures
[1:51:31] proverbs 11 12. i i got a whole bunch i
[1:51:34] told y'all i'm gonna get through with
[1:51:35] this
[1:51:36] proverbs 11 and 12.
[1:51:39] look at this
[1:51:43] it says he
[1:51:45] that is lord of wisdom
[1:51:48] despiseth his neighbor
[1:51:51] but a man of understanding
[1:51:54] holdeth
[1:51:56] his peace
[1:51:58] he that is vote of wisdom despiseth his
[1:52:01] neighbor but a man of understanding
[1:52:04] holdeth his peace
[1:52:06] now that says a lot let me go into
[1:52:07] proverbs 17 and 28.
[1:52:10] uh it says this
[1:52:13] even a fool
[1:52:17] oh glory to god i love the word of god
[1:52:20] even a fool
[1:52:22] when he holdeth his peace
[1:52:25] is counted wise
[1:52:32] even a fool
[1:52:36] when he holdeth his peace is counted
[1:52:38] wise
[1:52:40] and he that shutteth his lips i told
[1:52:42] y'all about that new
[1:52:44] ministry
[1:52:49] brother diggs talked to us about this
[1:52:51] new ministry
[1:52:52] and we all need to enter into the new
[1:52:54] ministry as we go into the new year
[1:52:57] practice the new ministry just
[1:52:59] shut your mouth
[1:53:03] even a fool
[1:53:06] when he holdeth his peace is counted
[1:53:09] wise and he that shutteth his lips is
[1:53:12] esteemed a man of understanding
[1:53:18] i mean we used to have some very hard
[1:53:20] sayings
[1:53:22] when we were coming up me and my brother
[1:53:25] very very hard sayings
[1:53:29] very hard sayings
[1:53:31] now remember
[1:53:32] once it was told to me
[1:53:34] they would never know
[1:53:39] your level of intelligence they never
[1:53:42] know
[1:53:43] i'm just dressing up the words here
[1:53:50] they never know your level of
[1:53:51] intelligence if you just keep your mouth
[1:53:53] shut
[1:53:57] but sometimes we just talk too much
[1:54:00] and through talking too much everybody
[1:54:02] know
[1:54:04] and you know and when they do that uh
[1:54:06] and they said unto you they're
[1:54:07] practicing
[1:54:08] wisdom
[1:54:10] they just they just shut in their mouth
[1:54:13] because he that understandeth
[1:54:15] holds his peace
[1:54:18] and what he realized that you don't
[1:54:20] understand without what i see i'ma let
[1:54:22] you run down this road
[1:54:24] i'ma let you run down this road
[1:54:26] you'll see some things
[1:54:28] then we'll talk
[1:54:30] but right now you can't see it

[1:54:35] peace
[1:54:36] i'm preaching real good
[1:54:42] i know i'm preaching real good because
[1:54:44] i'm preaching the bible
[1:54:48] even a fool
[1:54:52] when he holdeth this piece is counted
[1:54:54] wise and he that shutteth his lips is
[1:54:56] esteemed a man of understanding let me
[1:54:58] give you another one
[1:55:00] exodus 14 14.
[1:55:04] glory
[1:55:05] the lord
[1:55:08] shall fight for you
[1:55:11] and you want to know what you got to do
[1:55:13] why the lord fighting

[1:55:23] other leg on this one
[1:55:25] the lord shall fight for you and ye
[1:55:27] shall hold your peace
[1:55:38] they got another one
[1:55:40] in their definition they say
[1:55:42] make peace
[1:55:45] and to make peace means to re-establish
[1:55:47] friendly relations
[1:55:49] become reconcile
[1:55:53] this needs to happen in families
[1:55:56] it needs to happen in friendships
[1:55:58] it needs to happen in churches
[1:56:01] let me read you a quote and and i'm
[1:56:03] gonna read you a few more scriptures i
[1:56:04] got a whole bunch of scriptures but i'm

[1:56:16] and
[1:56:17] jacob it was finally reveal you know
[1:56:19] what has happened
[1:56:20] and and and god told jacob i mean i'm
[1:56:23] sorry jacob told his wives
[1:56:24] so they had these faults god said you
[1:56:26] know put away them strange gods
[1:56:28] and the strange gods they had was the
[1:56:30] ones in their ears
[1:56:32] praise the lord he told them put away
[1:56:34] the strange gods the ones that you have
[1:56:35] in your ears put them away don't don't
[1:56:37] don't do that don't do that right and
[1:56:40] they had to get rid of them strange gods
[1:56:41] i think it's genesis 35 you'll find the
[1:56:43] story they had to put away them strange
[1:56:45] gods but here jacob was actually going
[1:56:48] going back home
[1:56:50] to his family remember he left it was it
[1:56:52] was it was it was chaos but now he's
[1:56:54] going back and he's hoping for some
[1:56:56] peace
[1:56:58] here in desperation we pick something up
[1:57:01] jacob knew that his life was close at
[1:57:03] the end
[1:57:05] he had a messenger come told him that
[1:57:07] his brother with 400 armed men was
[1:57:09] coming to meet him oh lord now this show
[1:57:11] don't give him peace
[1:57:13] my brother come up for now it's one
[1:57:14] thing my brother coming by himself but
[1:57:16] he coming with 400 men this man means
[1:57:18] something
[1:57:20] was coming to me him no he was on his
[1:57:23] road
[1:57:24] fear took a hold of him
[1:57:27] he sent man on the head with ox and
[1:57:29] cattle and sheep to make a peace
[1:57:30] offering with esau
[1:57:32] then after that he started another group
[1:57:34] with another load of stuff
[1:57:36] then he started another group with
[1:57:38] another load of stuff man he was trying
[1:57:40] to meet him first
[1:57:42] trying to turn his wrath
[1:57:44] then he got to thinking that won't stop
[1:57:46] him because he's probably richer than i
[1:57:48] am
[1:57:49] he doesn't need it
[1:57:51] then he took his wives and his little
[1:57:52] children and sent them across that he
[1:57:55] saw would see them little children and
[1:57:57] his wives and surely on his own little
[1:58:00] nieces and nephews he would not slay him
[1:58:03] then he still it still he couldn't do it
[1:58:06] god knows how to get a man
[1:58:09] jacob crossed a brook
[1:58:12] there he got down on his knees
[1:58:15] you know he had kind of he had kind of
[1:58:18] been a kind of a little shyster before
[1:58:20] that excuse the expression but kind of
[1:58:23] he was a jacob jacob means a deceiver
[1:58:25] and that's what he was but there
[1:58:27] something had to happen to him there in
[1:58:29] desperation there when death laid before
[1:58:31] him see when he got and got in touch
[1:58:34] with god while he was in prayer at this
[1:58:36] time jacob ended up wrestling
[1:58:38] with god
[1:58:40] jacob met somebody that he wrestled with
[1:58:43] and this person after he wrestled with
[1:58:45] him it changed the way he walked
[1:58:49] it changed the way he handled things
[1:58:51] something happened on the inside of
[1:58:53] jacob his nature changed after he met
[1:58:56] peace
[1:59:00] and i'ma tell you if you want something
[1:59:01] to change for you you got to meet
[1:59:04] this person peace
[1:59:08] reconciliation make peace that's what
[1:59:10] this means reconciliation look at this
[1:59:12] matthew 5 9.
[1:59:14] matthew 5 9.
[1:59:17] blessed
[1:59:20] are the peacemakers
[1:59:27] not the wicked
[1:59:29] not the wicked for the peacemakers they
[1:59:32] are
[1:59:33] they shall be called the children of god
[1:59:38] hebrews 12 and 14.
[1:59:44] follow peace
[1:59:48] with all men
[1:59:52] and holiness
[1:59:53] without which no man shall see the lord
[1:59:57] so here in this scripture we see paul
[1:59:59] connect peace
[2:00:01] with holiness
[2:00:04] follow peace with all men and holiness
[2:00:07] without which no man shall see the lord
[2:00:10] if you want to meet god in peace you
[2:00:12] have to receive his peace
[2:00:18] romans 12 18.
[2:00:22] can i just read these scriptures
[2:00:25] if it be
[2:00:27] possible
[2:00:31] as much
[2:00:34] as lieth

[2:00:40] live peaceably
[2:00:41] [Music]
[2:00:43] with all men

[2:00:47] proverbs that say you know where there
[2:00:48] is no wood
[2:00:52] the fire season
[2:00:54] that mean the fire goes out you got to
[2:00:56] stop adding wood to the fire
[2:00:58] if you want peace in your home
