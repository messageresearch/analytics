[55:00] know hey brother you you did that was
[55:02] outstanding and the the words to that
[55:05] song really ministered to me
[55:08] um down to hearing that there's a new
[55:11] brother visiting coming today and you
[55:14] know I was thinking as I was thinking
[55:16] about you guys I thought you know a
[55:17] pastor's heart you know is to have his
[55:19] own building it's it's to be have your
[55:22] own meeting place and
[55:24] and so I was just thinking about that
[55:25] and I thought you know you guys have
[55:27] been placed here
[55:29] for for a purpose
[55:31] and you haven't had a building open up
[55:33] yet for a purpose
[55:36] and that brother was three minutes away
[55:38] and here this morning you could have
[55:40] been here for however long you've been
[55:43] here for one soul
[55:45] for one Soul God could have held you
[55:47] here
[55:48] and now I pray that he's here I pray
[55:51] that the doors open amen amen God bless
[55:55] you that did me so good to hear that
[55:57] because I just like I said I just
[55:59] feeling for brother Jack and and so I
[56:02] was going to say that anyway because
[56:03] I've been thinking about it and to hear
[56:04] that I am just so excited for you so
[56:07] your future is bright friends your
[56:09] future is bright amen
[56:12] Hallelujah and then not knowing where I
[56:16] was going to take my text from Brother
[56:17] Jack starts talking about it and so I
[56:19] would like you to open up to Esther
[56:21] chapter 2.
[56:24] stir chapter 2 and verse 5.
[56:27] I'll give you a minute to get there and
[56:28] and I'm just so you don't get nervous
[56:31] I'm gonna paint a little bit of a
[56:33] negative picture at the beginning but
[56:35] the end is going to be glorious okay so
[56:37] just just hold on with me and and we're
[56:40] going to go through the word of God and
[56:42] and I'll have quite a few scriptures at
[56:44] the end I'm just going to read them fast
[56:45] so don't feel like you got to turn there
[56:48] just because I just feel like it just
[56:51] drives the point home so
[56:53] Esther 2 and verse 5.
[56:57] it says now in shushan the palace there
[56:59] was a certain Jew whose name was
[57:01] Mordecai the son of jair the son of
[57:04] shimmyi the son of Kish a benjamite
[57:07] who had been carried away from Jerusalem
[57:09] with the Captivity which had been
[57:11] carried away from draconia King of Judah
[57:14] whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon
[57:16] had carried away
[57:18] and he brought up Hadassah that is
[57:20] Esther his uncle's daughter for she had
[57:24] neither father nor mother and the maid
[57:27] was fair and beautiful who Mordecai when
[57:31] her father and mother were dead took for
[57:33] his own daughter
[57:34] so it came to pass when the king's
[57:37] commandment and his decree Was Heard and
[57:40] when many maidens were gathered together
[57:41] unto shushan the palace to the custody
[57:44] of hagai that Esther was brought also
[57:47] into the King's house to the custody of
[57:49] hagai Keeper of the women and then I'll
[57:52] just quote for you the next verse there
[57:54] says what favor she gained let's bow our
[57:58] hearts
[57:59] Heavenly Father we come before you Lord
[58:01] and
[58:02] just ask you God I know you're here of
[58:05] God I just feel you flowing through this
[58:07] place Lord we see
[58:09] Your Glory on each face father and so
[58:13] the people have done their part
[58:15] Lord help me to get out of the way now
[58:18] to do my part Lord is just to get out of
[58:20] the way and let you flow through me Lord
[58:23] we're here God to hear your word not not
[58:27] some no name from Michigan
[58:29] but to hear from almighty God
[58:32] Grant it now bless this people Lord I
[58:35] pray special prayer father
[58:37] that you would just let the right church
[58:40] God let that be the door that opens if
[58:43] it's not your will for one of them God
[58:44] keep that door shut but Lord if it is
[58:47] your will I've seen you do it time and
[58:49] time again where the door opens and this
[58:51] church will just walk right into it
[58:53] blessed now father in Jesus name
[58:57] amen amen you can have your seats and I
[59:00] I greet you from my wife said be sure to
[59:02] give you her greetings from Pastor Paul
[59:05] and the church back home God bless you
[59:07] and brother Jack I believe brother Rapp
[59:10] was with you you were at winter youth
[59:11] retreat right he said to give you his
[59:13] greeting so
[59:16] so I've been going through the Book of
[59:18] Esther back home and it just seems like
[59:20] each time I I open it something else
[59:22] just jumps out at me and so you know and
[59:26] and that's that's good and fine but
[59:29] unless we can bring that down to
[59:30] Everyday living I I'm it's it's exciting
[59:33] and it's it's good things but I don't
[59:36] want this to just be I I'm not a
[59:38] dazzling preacher I'm I'm least among
[59:41] the Brethren but uh you know if if God
[59:44] can give us something to help our
[59:46] everyday life and help edify the church
[59:49] then then I'm happy I just I have to
[59:53] leave pretty quick here but if if when I
[59:55] go back behind there you can say you've
[59:57] seen Jesus Christ I'll be Satisfied amen
[1:00:00] amen so there's many types in the Book
[1:00:03] of Esther and and it starts with this
[1:00:05] very extravagant party and and and in in
[1:00:09] a queen's appearance Queen vashti being
[1:00:11] requested by the king and this this
[1:00:14] helps some of the sisters back home and
[1:00:16] so I just thought maybe I would just in
[1:00:18] laying a foundation to get where I want
[1:00:20] to get to I just thought I would I would
[1:00:22] paint this picture of what Esther grew
[1:00:24] up in and what what she had to endure
[1:00:27] and and you know she was maybe in a nice
[1:00:29] Community a nice Jewish Community with
[1:00:31] with Believers of of like Precious faith
[1:00:34] and then and then this event happens and
[1:00:36] you and The King The King calls for
[1:00:40] Queen vashti she's the she's the
[1:00:42] representative of the king she's the
[1:00:44] she's the reflection of the king and
[1:00:46] when he calls for she rejects him
[1:00:49] and you can see the type here already
[1:00:51] that that there's this this powerful
[1:00:53] King and in the history says he was one
[1:00:55] of the most powerful he had one of the
[1:00:57] most illustrious kingdoms of of history
[1:01:00] of the medes in Persian they were the
[1:01:02] strongest Empire of that day they were
[1:01:04] the first superpower they were the first
[1:01:07] superpower of the day and so
[1:01:10] the king you know of course he's he's
[1:01:12] he's drunk and I don't know all of
[1:01:14] vashti's reasons for for turning him
[1:01:16] down and I thought you know well Lord I
[1:01:18] is just thinking this morning friends
[1:01:20] and and I was thinking
[1:01:22] you you can type in Shadow God has not
[1:01:26] mentioned one time in the Book of Esther
[1:01:28] the name of God does not appear and yet
[1:01:31] it's one of the most beautiful types of
[1:01:33] the love story that's in the Bible and
[1:01:35] so I just got to thinking about it this
[1:01:37] morning and I thought Lord how do you
[1:01:39] tell those people that there's a drunk
[1:01:40] King that represents you
[1:01:43] but I thought about it and I thought he
[1:01:46] ordered the wine to be as much as anyone
[1:01:49] would want and we know that the wine is
[1:01:51] the stimulation of Revelation so that
[1:01:54] King was drunk on Revelation and that's
[1:01:56] the type to God Amen and when I saw that
[1:01:59] I just thought oh my and then I thought
[1:02:01] well let's run it over into Revelations
[1:02:03] and he says don't touch the wine in the
[1:02:05] oil
[1:02:06] don't touch that Holy Ghost don't touch
[1:02:09] that Holy Spirit don't touch the
[1:02:11] stimulation that's here in this church
[1:02:13] this morning amen
[1:02:16] amen my goodness you guys pool
[1:02:21] and so
[1:02:24] so the king the king he the the queen
[1:02:27] rejects the king he bids her come and
[1:02:30] she rejects it what was that she
[1:02:33] rejected the word of the king
[1:02:35] so now you have a you have a bride in
[1:02:38] the scripture who rejects the word of
[1:02:40] God and she gets rejected because of it
[1:02:42] amen that's why so vashti was put out
[1:02:47] for her lack of submission to the king's
[1:02:49] word she was not connected to the king
[1:02:52] she could not she could put the crown on
[1:02:54] that the king had given her but the king
[1:02:57] wanted someone who was connected with
[1:02:59] him
[1:03:00] he wanted somebody who loved him who
[1:03:02] reflected who he was in his glory this
[1:03:06] is one of the most glorious kings in the
[1:03:08] history of the medes and Persians and he
[1:03:10] wanted a wife he wanted a bride to
[1:03:12] reflect that and you you catch what I'm
[1:03:14] laying down this morning
[1:03:16] amen a queen submissive not because she
[1:03:19] had to be but because she wanted to be
[1:03:21] because she had a love for him she had a
[1:03:24] desire for him
[1:03:27] vashti was like the other women we find
[1:03:30] when Esther is called up and and and
[1:03:32] they they're told pick anything you want
[1:03:35] to take before the king that's yours to
[1:03:38] keep after
[1:03:40] and and all the other women you see you
[1:03:42] you get it you get a look into the life
[1:03:44] of of Esther and her character because
[1:03:47] she goes to the one who knew the king
[1:03:50] she goes to Hagee eye who who was who
[1:03:53] was dressing the bride she went to the
[1:03:56] prophet amen and asked what does the
[1:03:59] king like
[1:04:00] amen
[1:04:02] and the other women they were just they
[1:04:04] were just there to get all the benefits
[1:04:06] but they didn't want the the the
[1:04:08] commitment with the King
[1:04:10] and the King wanted someone he could be
[1:04:12] one with someone who who becomes part of
[1:04:15] him not not the man becomes part of the
[1:04:19] woman
[1:04:20] and we're just getting a little bit of
[1:04:22] marriage here this morning
[1:04:23] yeah not not the the the the the man
[1:04:27] becomes part of the woman but first
[1:04:29] Corinthians says the man wasn't created
[1:04:32] for the woman but woman for the man and
[1:04:35] and you know there's many times that
[1:04:36] sisters can say well I don't understand
[1:04:38] that I don't understand why you know we
[1:04:41] can't have these things why we can't do
[1:04:43] these things well sister that's because
[1:04:45] you hold a special key in the scripture
[1:04:47] listen to me now
[1:04:50] [Applause]
[1:04:51] sister you hold such a special I'm
[1:04:54] telling you right now sis
[1:04:57] you say oh but the brothers got it all
[1:04:59] no sis that oh my
[1:05:02] that that brother is nothing without you
[1:05:05] sister
[1:05:07] and let me tell you something Hallelujah
[1:05:09] God is nothing without us
[1:05:13] and I'm not saying that to be some cocky
[1:05:16] thing I'm saying that because he set it
[1:05:18] up that way
[1:05:20] Jehovah God set it up to say My bride is
[1:05:24] going to draw out attributes out of me
[1:05:28] that that brother that brother has
[1:05:30] things lying inside of Him Sister that
[1:05:32] he needs you for
[1:05:33] [Applause]
[1:05:35] that's why I assist my my my first lady
[1:05:37] here this morning this brother has
[1:05:39] things in him that he needs you for I
[1:05:42] tell you we we ministers couldn't do it
[1:05:45] without our wives we need that help me
[1:05:48] you brother you you and let's bring it
[1:05:50] down now brother you you need your wife
[1:05:53] every day to go to your job
[1:05:55] you need that support what who let me
[1:05:58] tell you something I'm just quoting the
[1:06:00] prophet now when you come home from a
[1:06:02] bad day
[1:06:04] who can take that away like nobody else
[1:06:08] that's your sweetheart brother and you
[1:06:10] should treat her like your sweetheart
[1:06:12] man
[1:06:13] treat her like like your queen
[1:06:17] [Applause]
[1:06:20] amen
[1:06:24] sister you are you are the betting
[1:06:26] ground of Life Christ injects himself
[1:06:29] into us
[1:06:31] now without getting too plain this
[1:06:33] morning you know when a man and woman
[1:06:34] come together the man injects himself
[1:06:36] into the wife and she Bears life
[1:06:38] so this is just perfect types here she
[1:06:41] takes on his life his name his identity
[1:06:44] she loses her own she she even loses uh
[1:06:49] oh this is okay she even loses her own
[1:06:51] body
[1:06:55] and and and and Christ pours himself out
[1:06:58] into the church to be one with her he
[1:07:01] wants all of her heart he doesn't want
[1:07:03] to share her with the world she don't
[1:07:05] God don't want to share you with the
[1:07:07] world
[1:07:11] I'm gonna tell you something this is
[1:07:12] just how I feel about things as as in
[1:07:15] this this is my prayer here this morning
[1:07:16] is
[1:07:17] sometimes in our nerves as ministers we
[1:07:20] can come into another man's pulpit and
[1:07:21] we'll say you know brother if I say
[1:07:23] anything wrong you get up and correct it
[1:07:24] but I believe we have a God who if he
[1:07:27] could shut Lion's mouths he could shut
[1:07:28] my mouth
[1:07:30] so that your pastor don't have to get up
[1:07:32] and correct anything so
[1:07:36] vashti wanted to control and Lead but it
[1:07:38] showed something was wrong in her heart
[1:07:40] and you can find all of this in the
[1:07:42] message God put that feminine spirit in
[1:07:46] the woman
[1:07:47] because she was to follow and and really
[1:07:50] brothers and sisters that that woman
[1:07:52] wants somebody to follow she wants a
[1:07:54] brother who's who's strong in the Lord
[1:07:57] who's she she wants a Praying husband
[1:08:03] she wants somebody to take her to church
[1:08:07] she wants it friends she she she's
[1:08:10] longing for it you say well but brother
[1:08:13] my my my wife she's she always takes the
[1:08:16] range and she's the spiritual leader of
[1:08:17] the home well maybe if you would take
[1:08:19] him she wouldn't have to
[1:08:22] maybe maybe she's just waiting on you to
[1:08:25] take it
[1:08:26] she's waiting on you to lead amen
[1:08:29] [Applause]
[1:08:32] the man and wife
[1:08:34] are to be one in body and in spirit
[1:08:39] connected physically
[1:08:42] and emotionally
[1:08:45] now listen brother you can say sis you
[1:08:48] can't withhold your body from me the
[1:08:51] scripture says it the minister just said
[1:08:53] it but brother I'm telling you it's
[1:08:54] wrong for you to expect that and not
[1:08:57] give her your heart

[1:09:02] and not give her your your mind
[1:09:05] amen

[1:09:12] you give yourself and she'll give
[1:09:14] herself amen
[1:09:18] and let me tell you something for for
[1:09:20] for those of you who've been married
[1:09:22] gonna be married

[1:09:35] me and my wife when we do get to go you

[1:09:47] we just you know we we go and we just
[1:09:49] feel like we're on a honeymoon again we
[1:09:51] just we're we're just so connected and
[1:09:53] and my my prayer is that you all
[1:09:56] experience that as well
[1:10:00] the the and and hopefully you're seeing
[1:10:03] this morning the most beautiful
[1:10:04] relationship that's on this face of the
[1:10:07] earth is with a man and his wife and and
[1:10:10] and spiritually with with between us and
[1:10:13] God Amen
[1:10:15] Amen Let me just catch myself because I
[1:10:18] was all over my notes
[1:10:26] spiritual blessings
[1:10:29] Christ wants our whole heart
[1:10:32] just as much as as we want to come and
[1:10:35] we want to feel the presence of God God
[1:10:37] wants us to come into His presence
[1:10:39] amen he wants us to experience his love
[1:10:42] he's he's he's Longing To Give You of
[1:10:46] himself and all he needs is for you to
[1:10:48] Just Surrender is not complicated
[1:10:51] friends it's just surrender
[1:10:53] [Music]
[1:10:56] [Applause]
[1:10:58] so we're just going to take a little bit
[1:10:59] of a turn here
[1:11:01] so stay stay with me we also find in
[1:11:03] chapter one the setting of our story is
[1:11:06] is this medes and Persian Empire shushan
[1:11:09] the palace and as I told you it was it
[1:11:11] was one of the most illustrious of its
[1:11:13] day and we can find many similarities
[1:11:15] between the setting of that age Esther
[1:11:18] was placed in and the age we've been
[1:11:21] placed in
[1:11:22] that that that was it was the largest of
[1:11:25] the day even even to I heard one thing
[1:11:27] it's it's sometimes it's hard to find in
[1:11:29] the history in that but if one thing
[1:11:31] said that um it's it was about the size
[1:11:34] of the United States close to it another
[1:11:36] thing I read was about you know half of
[1:11:39] the United States regardless that's a
[1:11:41] big Empire
[1:11:43] that's a big Empire and and we can find
[1:11:45] in Daniel chapter 10 and verse 13 it
[1:11:48] says but the prince of the kingdom of
[1:11:50] Persia which stood me when in 20 days
[1:11:53] but Lo Michael one of the chief princes
[1:11:56] came to help me and I remained there
[1:11:58] with the King of Persia Kings of Persia
[1:12:01] now what I want to grab from this
[1:12:03] scripture is that there's a spirit on
[1:12:05] every nation
[1:12:06] and this this is proof of it in the
[1:12:09] Bible that the prince of the kingdom of
[1:12:11] Persia now this was an angel of the Lord
[1:12:13] coming to Daniel
[1:12:16] and and this isn't a spiritual Dimension
[1:12:18] so we understand that we we wrestle not
[1:12:20] against flesh and blood but against
[1:12:22] principalities and strongholds and
[1:12:24] things and and high places but so if
[1:12:28] there was a spirit on the kingdom of
[1:12:30] Persia
[1:12:31] then there's a spirit on the kingdom of
[1:12:33] America
[1:12:35] and we see that you don't need me to
[1:12:37] tell you these things but the spirit on
[1:12:39] this nation of Persia it was a very rich
[1:12:41] and glorious Kingdom it was a spirit in
[1:12:43] this Kingdom of excess and an addiction
[1:12:46] and drunkenness
[1:12:49] wow at the time the history says that at
[1:12:52] the time and it's just so beautiful I
[1:12:55] just love the scriptures because you
[1:12:57] have Ezra and Esther and Nehemiah and
[1:12:59] they all start running really close and
[1:13:01] even overlapping a little bit and back
[1:13:04] home what the Lord showed me is you know
[1:13:06] the brother Branham said that the seven
[1:13:07] the church ages and the seals they they
[1:13:10] overlap there's an overlap period so we
[1:13:13] see that these periods in the Bible
[1:13:14] these books of the Bibles they actually
[1:13:15] overlap a little bit and when Nehemiah
[1:13:18] takes the Jews back to Jerusalem
[1:13:21] there were actually many Jews stayed
[1:13:24] because they became lukewarm and
[1:13:26] comfortable
[1:13:28] they enjoyed the illustrious of that
[1:13:31] Kingdom so much that they didn't go back
[1:13:33] and take the land they didn't go back
[1:13:35] they didn't go all the way into God's
[1:13:38] promises they got hung up right there on
[1:13:40] the illustrious they became comfortable
[1:13:42] and lukewarm there was a spirit of of
[1:13:45] heathenism and tradition but but also a
[1:13:48] blurring in religion because the
[1:13:50] religion of the medes and pers was
[1:13:52] monotheistic they believed in one God
[1:13:55] and and they had what I what I would
[1:13:57] consider what they would say would be a
[1:13:59] modern day Prophet to them
[1:14:01] but yet they didn't they didn't
[1:14:03] necessarily force that on the people
[1:14:05] they said you can have your own but yet
[1:14:07] their laws and things were so great that
[1:14:10] they could still control the other
[1:14:12] religions and we see that when Haman
[1:14:14] comes up and he's changing laws and and
[1:14:17] this is there's scripture it's just so
[1:14:19] beautiful changing laws and things to
[1:14:21] get control of God's people
[1:14:23] yeah
[1:14:24] so uh they're forcing laws and and we
[1:14:28] know that the laws have changed in our
[1:14:29] day to force the the the the the the sin
[1:14:33] of the world around us on us not that we
[1:14:35] have to partake in it but it's you you
[1:14:38] see it's it's growing this Kingdom of
[1:14:40] America this spirit is growing amen
[1:14:43] we see that women were beautiful and and
[1:14:46] there was a spirit of immodesty in the
[1:14:48] medes and Persians there was a spirit of
[1:14:49] Anger of rage and murder we've never
[1:14:53] seen it like we have today in our day
[1:14:55] and it just keeps getting worse and
[1:14:57] worse and and and you know there was
[1:15:00] something um on the Roman Empire and
[1:15:03] they had a city and it was called Sin
[1:15:04] City in the Roman Empire and I just
[1:15:07] thought man if if we could just contain
[1:15:09] it to one city that would be great but
[1:15:10] we got it we got it just overflowing and
[1:15:13] it's just the spirit on the age today
[1:15:16] there's a spirit of compromise
[1:15:19] and and that was proven when most of the
[1:15:21] Jews stayed back and so so this is what
[1:15:24] we're warring against as Christians this
[1:15:27] is what when you get down to pray I want
[1:15:29] to encourage you this morning that the
[1:15:31] angel told Daniel Daniel I heard you
[1:15:34] from the first day
[1:15:35] I heard you the first time you prayed
[1:15:38] you've been praying for something for a
[1:15:40] long time but I'll tell you keep praying
[1:15:42] because remember the prophet got to look
[1:15:45] into the other dimension and he said
[1:15:47] your faith determines which way that war
[1:15:50] is going
[1:15:51] so if you can just latch on to the word
[1:15:53] of God and and believe and and have
[1:15:56] faith in the word of God you can sway
[1:15:58] the way that that battle goes but just
[1:16:00] know that there is a battle
[1:16:02] there is a battle in the other dimension
[1:16:05] Satan does not want God to answer your
[1:16:08] prayer but God is on the scene he's uh
[1:16:11] he's he's on the work amen
[1:16:14] what I like about that scripture in
[1:16:15] Daniel 2 is is there's this Angel of the
[1:16:18] Lord and he comes to Daniel and he says
[1:16:20] Daniel I heard you I I it took me 21
[1:16:22] days to get to you but I've been trying
[1:16:24] I've been trying but he said but listen
[1:16:27] to me he said but Michael came
[1:16:30] Michael came I got a scripture for you
[1:16:32] at the end he says Michael your prince
[1:16:34] came that's Jehovah that's Jesus Christ
[1:16:38] coming on the scene and he says you know
[1:16:40] what it was it was too much for his
[1:16:42] angels I don't understand that
[1:16:45] but I do know that God when he saw that
[1:16:48] it wasn't getting through he said that's
[1:16:50] it I'm coming myself
[1:16:52] I'm gonna come do it I'm gonna come in
[1:16:54] war with the angel
[1:16:57] we find the spirit of America
[1:16:58] drunkenness excess lust immorality
[1:17:02] sexuality want for entertainment and not
[1:17:05] the gospel there is so much
[1:17:07] entertainment and social media and
[1:17:09] things today I I tell you when you do
[1:17:13] that fast I would encourage you to fast
[1:17:15] from social media make sure you make
[1:17:17] that apart and then add the food like

[1:17:33] break a habit to make a new habit is 21
[1:17:35] days I challenge you 21 days just take a
[1:17:38] fast from social media
[1:17:40] and can I can I say this too because I I
[1:17:43] friends I do this too I'm not preaching
[1:17:45] anything that I don't do myself but but
[1:17:47] take a break from watching silly videos
[1:17:50] online
[1:17:51] you know yeah because you get you get on
[1:17:54] your Facebook and things and you can
[1:17:56] scroll and you can see all these videos
[1:17:57] and stuff and listen to me you can
[1:18:00] actually excuse things that you know
[1:18:01] well it's on Facebook
[1:18:03] oh they they threw that in there so I
[1:18:05] let that go but friends come on we let's
[1:18:08] be real with each other
[1:18:11] I'm preaching to me just as much as I'm
[1:18:12] preaching to you
[1:18:15] you YouTube all of that you know when
[1:18:18] you when you go to bed at night yeah
[1:18:20] yeah I won't ask for a show of hands but
[1:18:22] if I did we would all be raising them if
[1:18:24] we're honest you're gonna scroll through
[1:18:26] YouTube and things before you go to bed
[1:18:29] come on somebody
[1:18:33] I I gotta swallow it just as much as you
[1:18:36] do
[1:18:38] Hallelujah there's scoffers at the word
[1:18:40] of God
[1:18:41] here in America it's there's a
[1:18:44] comfortable and and satisfied living and
[1:18:47] we if we're not careful we can become
[1:18:48] comfortable and satisfied with sin that
[1:18:50] doesn't make you a bad person that
[1:18:53] doesn't make you lost that makes you
[1:18:55] living in the United States that makes
[1:18:56] you living in laodicea
[1:18:59] as friends so don't let Satan come in
[1:19:01] your mind this is what I'm getting at
[1:19:02] don't let Satan come in your mind and
[1:19:04] tell you you're not saved you don't have
[1:19:06] what you thought you did you're not
[1:19:08] where you thought you were that's the
[1:19:10] devil
[1:19:11] we all struggle we all we all have
[1:19:13] things but but and I'm not excusing
[1:19:15] things now but I'm just encouraging you
[1:19:18] in the Lord because Satan can really get
[1:19:19] after you sometimes
[1:19:22] and that that's where I'm going here
[1:19:24] we become comfort with extravagance and
[1:19:26] convenience we become self-seeking
[1:19:28] seeking after temporal and fleeting
[1:19:31] things that have no lasting joy we can
[1:19:33] become proud this is this is this is the
[1:19:35] spirit around us and and it can
[1:19:38] influence us proud and arrogant there's
[1:19:40] there's insane and mental unstability
[1:19:43] like never before
[1:19:45] that's I love that sister special when
[1:19:47] she's saying and she said that she said
[1:19:49] that you know nothing's too too strong
[1:19:51] for God not even the mental illness of
[1:19:54] today
[1:19:56] there's an irreverence of today
[1:19:59] now I'm going to take is it okay to take
[1:20:02] this off
[1:20:04] I can just lay it over this chair
[1:20:06] brother
[1:20:07] thank you
[1:20:11] thank you I told Brother Jack I was I
[1:20:14] was picking my suit out for the day and
[1:20:15] my wife said well it's going to be hot
[1:20:17] don't wear a three piece and I thought
[1:20:18] no they know how to dress down there
[1:20:21] hahaha
[1:20:24] that's all right bro and I walked up and
[1:20:27] I told Brother Jack I said I'm sure glad
[1:20:28] I wore my three piece today because you
[1:20:30] all look good
[1:20:33] that's all right brother
[1:20:35] [Applause]
[1:20:36] so at Esther chapter 3 and verse one
[1:20:39] says after these things did King
[1:20:42] ahazarus promote Haman the son of
[1:20:45] hamadatha the agagite
[1:20:49] and advanced him and set his seat above
[1:20:52] all the princes that were with him and
[1:20:54] all the king's servants that were in the
[1:20:56] king's gate bowed and reverenced Haman
[1:20:58] for the king had so commanded concerning
[1:21:00] him now this might be confusing a little
[1:21:03] bit because I'm typing back and forth
[1:21:05] between God and in in the scripture but
[1:21:09] I was thinking about this today and and
[1:21:12] it now I'm not making a Doctrine out of
[1:21:14] this okay I'm just saying this is just
[1:21:17] something that I saw in just just this
[1:21:19] morning when I was looking at that wine
[1:21:20] and the oil
[1:21:21] and and it took me over to the third
[1:21:24] seal and brother Branham was talking
[1:21:25] about the the horse riders in the Book
[1:21:27] of Revelation and I actually to me I saw
[1:21:31] haman's what I'm going to call his
[1:21:33] ministry there all right and now I'm
[1:21:35] going to type Haman with the Devil
[1:21:38] but there's I'm going to take it a step
[1:21:40] further too something in the Scofield
[1:21:42] notes I thought was amazing
[1:21:44] we so we find many types between Haman
[1:21:47] to Satan himself the enemy of God's
[1:21:49] people throughout the time the main
[1:21:51] thing was Haman wanted to destroy God's
[1:21:54] people
[1:21:55] and you you know the story of Esther so
[1:21:57] I won't dwell on that too much but again
[1:21:58] he changed laws and put laws into action
[1:22:01] and we have the Satan putting laws into
[1:22:03] action today to try to to try to put
[1:22:06] pressure on you to conform to this world
[1:22:08] Amen
[1:22:10] Haman gets extremely jealous over God's
[1:22:13] people he gets extremely jealous over
[1:22:16] them being promoted and not worshiping
[1:22:18] him
[1:22:19] and we can go into Isaiah and I and I
[1:22:22] took the scripture out now you're
[1:22:23] familiar with it whereas how about the
[1:22:25] Fallen o Lucifer and and the devil's
[1:22:29] just exposed Lucifer's exposed in those
[1:22:31] scriptures of his desire to be like the
[1:22:33] most high he and and what a braggard I
[1:22:36] will be like the most high and and in
[1:22:38] our story Haman actually he he's he
[1:22:40] comes before the king and the King again
[1:22:43] you know the story but he says King The
[1:22:45] King says Heyman I got a question for
[1:22:46] you what should I do to a man who I want
[1:22:49] to bless
[1:22:50] and Haman says uh here's my moment
[1:22:55] King you should dress him in your robe
[1:22:57] you should put him on your horse over in
[1:23:00] Revelations we find him riding a white
[1:23:01] horse right
[1:23:02] he says and then and then again friends
[1:23:05] this is just then the second writer
[1:23:07] comes and he's got a crown at that point
[1:23:09] and what did Haman ask for he said put
[1:23:11] the crown royal on top of his head
[1:23:14] let him let him and just be led through
[1:23:16] the street by your most noble person
[1:23:18] Watch the watch this backfire on the
[1:23:21] devil because the king says
[1:23:24] that's a great idea Heyman go do
[1:23:26] everything you said under Mordecai
[1:23:29] go do it to the one who you want to kill
[1:23:33] and friends and then you can just run
[1:23:35] this through and and and and you say
[1:23:38] well I I don't understand because how is
[1:23:40] how is the king just promoting Haman and
[1:23:43] how is this happening to where he's
[1:23:45] given him rulership over God's people
[1:23:47] remember there was a day when the sons
[1:23:49] of Man became before God in job now and
[1:23:53] and and he said God saw Satan in the
[1:23:56] back and he says hey what are you doing
[1:24:00] and he says I'm going to and fro
[1:24:02] throughout all the Earth
[1:24:03] and then what did God say what did the
[1:24:05] king say he said hey
[1:24:08] have you considered my servant job
[1:24:12] you say God I wish you wouldn't do that
[1:24:16] Lord I wish I
[1:24:18] we had a prophet in our day come and he
[1:24:21] said that's
[1:24:23] been you
[1:24:25] because he knows you're gonna he's he's
[1:24:27] gonna see you through you're gonna make
[1:24:29] it through and so he says hey why don't
[1:24:32] you cons why don't you consider my
[1:24:33] servant jacked up God
[1:24:37] and that's because he has faith in you
[1:24:39] and and but but but we draw something
[1:24:42] from that that Satan can't touch you
[1:24:44] without God's permission
[1:24:48] so I think our brother here said at the
[1:24:51] beginning of the service he says
[1:24:52] somebody said it your trials are
[1:24:55] predestinated by God
[1:24:57] your trial can't come to you unless God
[1:25:00] allows that trial in your life
[1:25:03] and you say but oh it gets it gets so
[1:25:06] heavy I can't bear it you can bear it
[1:25:09] because God will not put any more on you
[1:25:12] than what you can handle
[1:25:14] so if you're dealing with cancer this
[1:25:16] morning
[1:25:18] to God be the glory
[1:25:21] if you're dealing with with a loved one
[1:25:24] who you've been praying for for a long
[1:25:25] time
[1:25:26] and you're not seeing anything come back
[1:25:28] out of their lives to God be the glory
[1:25:32] you keep praying because remember that
[1:25:34] battle is going on in the other
[1:25:36] dimension
[1:25:37] oh man
[1:25:39] amen amen
[1:25:42] hallelujah amen so
[1:25:48] thank you Lord
[1:25:51] so verse 6 there was something in in
[1:25:54] Esther and I think this is chapter four
[1:25:56] chapter three I guess I took that out
[1:25:59] excuse me
[1:26:01] verse six and and Haman is going back
[1:26:04] and he
[1:26:06] you want a good look at what the devil
[1:26:08] is like go read Esther when Haman gets
[1:26:11] so upset and he goes stamping his feet
[1:26:13] back to his little demons
[1:26:15] it says I just can't do it to him I just
[1:26:17] can't get through to him I can't make
[1:26:19] them bow I can't make them do this and
[1:26:21] he gets he just throws this little pity
[1:26:23] party that's right yes nothing but a
[1:26:37] to worship amen
[1:26:39] then Haman said okay
[1:26:41] I'll go myself
[1:26:43] and that's when we find him before the
[1:26:45] king and he presents the the plot to
[1:26:48] kill God's people before the king
[1:26:51] and then we see the king sign it with
[1:26:53] his ring
[1:26:54] it says whatever you say well then this
[1:26:56] is where I typed in job that's the only
[1:26:59] way it could happen
[1:27:00] yeah
[1:27:01] right right that's right so I want to
[1:27:05] just real quick follow it the scripture
[1:27:07] is is careful to say Haman the agagite
[1:27:12] and so I I started looking up agagite
[1:27:15] one day
[1:27:17] and following that lineage we go back to
[1:27:19] Genesis and we find Esau has a son named
[1:27:23] amalek
[1:27:25] then over in Exodus 17 we find amalek is
[1:27:29] found again
[1:27:31] and and he's fighting against the
[1:27:33] children of Israel on their way to the
[1:27:35] promised land
[1:27:36] now I don't know his his reason for it
[1:27:39] it just says they they come up out I
[1:27:41] think out of the Wilderness or just
[1:27:43] trying to remember the way their
[1:27:44] scriptures worded and it says and amulet
[1:27:47] came against him
[1:27:50] Schofield writes this on amalek he said
[1:27:52] he was born after the flesh
[1:27:54] a progenerator of the amalekites
[1:27:57] Israel's persistent enemy it's a type of
[1:28:00] the Flesh in The Believer
[1:28:02] so I want to take this Haman a little
[1:28:05] bit further than just the devil because
[1:28:07] we are we fight against the devil but
[1:28:09] you fight your worst enemy is yourself
[1:28:13] it's this right here this flesh and
[1:28:15] that's the same for every human being
[1:28:19] it's the persistent enemy it's the type
[1:28:22] of the flesh he that was born after the
[1:28:24] flesh persecuted him that was born after
[1:28:26] the spirit even so it is now but the
[1:28:30] conflict with emalek in chapter 17 sets
[1:28:32] forth the resources of the man under the
[1:28:35] law
[1:28:36] so it rather than those of the believer
[1:28:39] under grace the man under the law could
[1:28:42] fight and pray but under grace the Holy
[1:28:44] Spirit gains the victory over the Flesh
[1:28:47] on the believer's behalf now you say
[1:28:49] brother I that was that was great
[1:28:51] reading but what's it mean go read
[1:28:53] Romans 7 what's Paul say
[1:28:55] he says when I want to do good there's
[1:28:58] evil always with me
[1:29:00] when I'm trying to do good I find myself
[1:29:02] doing what I don't want to do and the
[1:29:04] things that I want to do I can't seem to
[1:29:06] do
[1:29:07] and then he says what that is is there's
[1:29:09] he actually calls it a law of sin that
[1:29:12] works in your body
[1:29:13] now I brought this out at home and I
[1:29:15] just thought this was so good is that
[1:29:17] when you do wrong you'll find this in
[1:29:20] the message now so I'm not off my rocker
[1:29:22] I don't believe but you'll find this in
[1:29:24] the message that when you do wrong
[1:29:25] that's not you any longer remember
[1:29:27] justification is just as if you never
[1:29:30] did it in the first place God is looking
[1:29:32] at your desire and if you don't desire
[1:29:34] that thing that's why Paul could write
[1:29:36] there is there no no sorry let me catch
[1:29:39] my tongue there is no condemnation to
[1:29:42] them who believe in Christ Jesus why is
[1:29:45] it because when you when you sin that's
[1:29:47] the sin working in your flesh not you
[1:29:49] doing it
[1:29:51] I I hope I said that just right because
[1:29:53] because when you know we beat ourselves
[1:29:56] up and you know we we've heard it many
[1:29:58] times Satan's the one who tempts you and
[1:30:00] then when when you fall into that
[1:30:02] Temptation then he goes and calls the
[1:30:04] police on you
[1:30:05] and he's going to Heap up that
[1:30:07] condemnation and and I'm not saying
[1:30:09] don't repent repent and bring that under
[1:30:11] the blood
[1:30:12] but I'm saying when you do that's where
[1:30:15] it stops it's just as if you never did
[1:30:17] it in the first place God doesn't look
[1:30:20] at you then he's looking at you through
[1:30:21] his blood what he sees is he sees your
[1:30:23] enemy
[1:30:24] he sees your flesh he sees the sin
[1:30:27] that's working in your flesh
[1:30:30] amen
[1:30:31] are you still with me
[1:30:36] but this victory
[1:30:38] the victory of the holy spirit that that
[1:30:40] can be had in your in on your behalf
[1:30:43] that Victory is only as the believer
[1:30:45] walks in the spirit
[1:30:47] acting in Independence or Disobedience
[1:30:50] amalek the flesh gains an easy victory
[1:30:54] we've experienced that many times can
[1:30:56] you say Amen
[1:30:59] but I'm making my turn now
[1:31:03] this is the word of the Lord over you
[1:31:06] Esther 3 if you caught it it says at the
[1:31:09] beginning when it when it introduces
[1:31:11] Haman the agagite when it introduces
[1:31:13] your the type of your flesh it says
[1:31:16] after these things
[1:31:19] after these things
[1:31:21] after Esther was already sealed in
[1:31:25] after Esther was already Queen
[1:31:28] then Haman became you say well what's
[1:31:31] that mean brother after your names were
[1:31:33] written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:31:36] under the shed blood of Jesus Christ
[1:31:38] then your aim then Lucifer was made but
[1:31:42] you were already sealed in and
[1:31:44] predestinated to make it
[1:31:46] you're gonna make it friend you're gonna
[1:31:49] you're gonna make it
[1:31:52] say I'm gonna make it
[1:31:54] I'm gonna make it amen you're gonna make
[1:31:58] it through
[1:31:59] Hallelujah
[1:32:01] [Applause]
[1:32:06] now we're talking about spirits in high
[1:32:08] places we're talking about we're talking
[1:32:10] about the Prince of Persia we're talking
[1:32:12] about Satan himself but but we know that
[1:32:16] Satan is an angel
[1:32:18] and Hebrews 1 says talking of Christ
[1:32:20] being made so much better than the
[1:32:22] angels as he hath by inheritance obtain
[1:32:25] a more excellent Name than they now now
[1:32:28] he he goes on to say For unto which of
[1:32:31] the Angels said he had any time Thou Art
[1:32:33] my son this day have I begotten thee and
[1:32:36] again I will be to him a father and he
[1:32:39] shall be to me a son and again when he
[1:32:41] bringeth and the first begotten into the
[1:32:43] world he saith and let all the angels of
[1:32:46] God worship Him right verse 13 but to
[1:32:51] which of the Angels said he at any time
[1:32:53] sit at my right hand until I make thine
[1:32:55] enemies my footstool
[1:32:57] uh that that oh let me catch that I want
[1:32:59] to read that right now sit on my right
[1:33:02] hand until I make thine enemies thy
[1:33:04] footstool are they not all ministering
[1:33:07] Spirits sent forth to minister for them
[1:33:10] who shall be Heirs of salvation
[1:33:14] Hallelujah
[1:33:15] even even the the Angels of Darkness
[1:33:21] are for your benefit
[1:33:24] they are they are and we we could say if
[1:33:27] I and I don't want to I don't want to
[1:33:28] lose this now because I'm not I'm not
[1:33:31] I'm not trying to get off on something
[1:33:32] strange here
[1:33:34] but let me say it this way
[1:33:37] we know that if we get off too far track
[1:33:41] God can allow things in our lives God
[1:33:43] can God can set that enemy loose on you
[1:33:46] to to to hurt you back to himself
[1:33:50] is that is that okay
[1:33:53] so in that way they're ministering
[1:33:56] spirits to you
[1:33:57] it's only to bring something out of you
[1:34:00] that's lying in there that God knows
[1:34:04] and it's and it's for Heirs of Salvation
[1:34:07] so so what am I getting at if all the
[1:34:10] Angels were placed under his feet
[1:34:13] and you're an heir to Salvation then all
[1:34:17] angels are set under your feet
[1:34:19] amen
[1:34:21] [Music]

[1:35:04] us but
[1:35:06] but
[1:35:07] you're of a spirit of above
[1:35:11] you're of a righteous Spirit not of Our
[1:35:13] Own
[1:35:15] but of his righteousness we're of a
[1:35:18] spirit of the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:35:19] and of his resurrection
[1:35:21] we're born from above this world is not
[1:35:24] our home we're pilgrims and strangers
[1:35:26] we're seeking a land to come not seeking
[1:35:29] worldly pleasure
[1:35:31] where new creatures in Christ
[1:35:33] change nature we're moral we're modest
[1:35:37] we're of a spirit that cannot fail
[1:35:42] Daniel chapter 10 we we read it that's
[1:35:45] where he says the Prince of Persia verse
[1:35:47] 20 says let's just say this is our verse
[1:35:50] 20. then said he knowest thou wherefore
[1:35:53] I come unto thee and now will I return
[1:35:55] to fight with the Prince of Persia and
[1:35:58] when I am gone forth Lo the prince of
[1:36:00] Grisha shall come
[1:36:02] but I will show thee that which is noted
[1:36:04] in the scripture of Truth and there is
[1:36:06] none that holdeth with me in these
[1:36:08] things but Michael your prince oh I love
[1:36:12] that Michael your prince who's your

[1:36:33] Daniel 7 13 I saw in the night visions
[1:36:37] and behold one like the son of man came
[1:36:39] with the Clouds Of Heaven I'm going to
[1:36:40] read a lot here but just just bask in
[1:36:44] the scripture
[1:36:47] one like the son of man came with clouds
[1:36:49] of heaven and came to the Ancient of
[1:36:50] Days and they brought him near before
[1:36:52] him and there was giving him dominion
[1:36:54] and glory in the Kingdom that all people
[1:36:57] Nations and tongues should serve him his
[1:36:59] Dominion is an everlasting Dominion
[1:37:01] which shall not pass away in his kingdom
[1:37:04] that which shall not be destroyed verse
[1:37:06] 17 these great beasts which are for our
[1:37:09] Four Kings which shall arise out of the
[1:37:11] Earth but the Saints of the most high
[1:37:13] shall take the kingdom
[1:37:15] there's a kingdom that we're fighting
[1:37:17] against but we're going to take the
[1:37:19] kingdom and possess the kingdom forever
[1:37:21] and ever uh even forever and ever
[1:37:24] oh my
[1:37:26] verse verse 19 through 21 you can read
[1:37:29] it it's just talking about the the
[1:37:31] fierceness of of the beast in verse 22
[1:37:33] until the Ancient of Days came and
[1:37:36] judgment was given to the Saints of the
[1:37:38] most high and the time came that the
[1:37:40] Saints possessed the kingdom verse 25
[1:37:43] and he shall speak great words against
[1:37:45] the most high and shall wear out the
[1:37:47] Saints of the most high

[1:37:59] Lord get send me a reprieve
[1:38:02] verse 26 but the Judgment shall sit and
[1:38:06] they shall take away his Dominion now
[1:38:09] that didn't say he shall take away it
[1:38:12] says they shall take away you are going
[1:38:15] to take away the Dominion of your enemy
[1:38:19] to consume and destroy it unto the end
[1:38:21] in the kingdom and dominion and the
[1:38:23] greatness of the Kingdom Under the whole
[1:38:24] Heaven shall be given to the people of
[1:38:26] the Saints of the most high Amen Let me
[1:38:29] I'm going to skip some of this here
[1:38:32] so we we typed Haman with with amalek
[1:38:35] and the flesh
[1:38:37] but your flesh isn't going to live
[1:38:38] forever
[1:38:40] now I just I just want to bring this in
[1:38:47] oh my
[1:38:49] Exodus 17.
[1:38:51] in verse 16 for he said because the Lord
[1:38:54] has sworn that the Lord will have war
[1:38:57] with amalek from generation to
[1:39:00] generation so we see that war we see
[1:39:02] that that the Lord himself is going to
[1:39:05] war against your flesh he's gonna over
[1:39:07] in Ezekiel it says he's going to put a
[1:39:09] heart of Flesh in you he's going to take
[1:39:11] your Heart of Stone amen he's going to
[1:39:13] fill you with his spirit
[1:39:15] one more here Deuteronomy 25 17.
[1:39:20] remember what amalek did unto thee by
[1:39:22] the way when he when you were come forth
[1:39:25] out of Egypt when you came out of the
[1:39:27] world that's when your battle started
[1:39:29] how he met thee by the way and smote the
[1:39:32] hindmost of the even all that were
[1:39:34] feeble behind thee when thou was faint
[1:39:37] and weary
[1:39:38] when he made you weary when he when he
[1:39:40] wore you out
[1:39:44] about
[1:39:47] and he feared and he feared not God
[1:39:50] verse 19 therefore it shall be when the
[1:39:52] Lord thy God hath given thee rest from
[1:39:55] all thine enemies round about in the
[1:39:58] land which the Lord thy God giveth thee
[1:40:00] for an inheritance to possess it that
[1:40:02] thou shall blot out the remembrance of
[1:40:05] amalek from under heaven and then he
[1:40:07] says Thou shalt not forget it that means
[1:40:10] you must not forget
[1:40:12] you must not forget that one day the
[1:40:15] remembrance of this is going to be
[1:40:17] blotted out
[1:40:18] you're gonna live in you we can have
[1:40:21] Victory now we'll live in Victory now
[1:40:23] but one day the trouble that this caused
[1:40:26] is going to be forgotten amen one day
[1:40:29] you we're going to live in Paradise my
[1:40:32] goodness you you live in a paradise here
[1:40:34] it's just there's so and I'm sure you
[1:40:36] see the worst parts of it we're seeing
[1:40:38] the best parts of it right but but just
[1:40:40] to just to watch that that ocean and and
[1:40:43] the cleanness and things and I was
[1:40:46] sitting out by the ocean the other day
[1:40:47] the other night and I was praying for
[1:40:49] this service and I and I just thought
[1:40:50] Lord what what do I need in my life what
[1:40:53] do I what do I need what do you want to
[1:40:55] give me Lord what do I what do I need to
[1:40:57] go on with you and I was watching as the
[1:41:00] waves were coming in they were kind of
[1:41:01] high there's been a a rip current
[1:41:04] um warning you know so so I just
[1:41:07] watching the waves come up on shore and
[1:41:09] I was watching everything the seaweed
[1:41:11] kept washing up
[1:41:12] and as I I started walking because my
[1:41:15] girls I got I've got three children two
[1:41:17] two girls and a boy
[1:41:19] and they said Daddy we want you to bring
[1:41:20] us some shells and so I thought well
[1:41:22] I'll walk here and so I was in the dark
[1:41:24] so I had my flashlight and as I was
[1:41:26] walking I started noticing there's
[1:41:27] there's garbage in this seaweed that's
[1:41:29] been washing up
[1:41:31] and then my mind as I was praying that
[1:41:33] my mind went to when brother Bradham
[1:41:34] said a Revival in your heart is when the
[1:41:37] waves are washing the junk out
[1:41:40] it's getting the trash out of the water
[1:41:42] and cleaning the water and I thought God
[1:41:44] give me send down a holy ghost Revival
[1:41:47] give me Revival
[1:41:50] give me Revival in my heart
[1:41:53] amen
[1:41:54] renew a right Spirit Within Me
[1:42:01] oh my
[1:42:07] just some just some closing comments and
[1:42:09] and then I I'll I'll let you go
[1:42:12] Haman is told
[1:42:15] let me see here
[1:42:17] turn to Esther seven and I'm just going
[1:42:19] to make a couple comments and then I
[1:42:21] want to read you something in the
[1:42:22] scripture
[1:42:25] Haman is told by actually I think it was
[1:42:29] his wife and his people they actually
[1:42:30] tell him you're going to be the one to
[1:42:32] fall
[1:42:34] he builds he builds the Gallows for
[1:42:36] Mordecai because he just can't stand him
[1:42:38] and then he's the one that gets hung on
[1:42:40] him every attempt to destroy and accuse
[1:42:43] God's people to the king that Haman
[1:42:45] tried backfired on him
[1:42:47] and the King's Queen and God's people
[1:42:49] were exalted amen so Esther 7
[1:42:54] and verse 6.
[1:42:59] and the King arising uh let me see oh
[1:43:02] I'm sorry you had it right I had it
[1:43:03] wrong
[1:43:05] oh my am I in the right spot
[1:43:15] yes yes yes yes
[1:43:17] verse six and Esther said the adversary
[1:43:20] and enemy is this wicked Haman then
[1:43:23] Haman was afraid before the king and the
[1:43:26] Queen
[1:43:27] remember we're typing now
[1:43:29] Satan is afraid of you
[1:43:33] when the weakest Christian no matter
[1:43:36] what you feel about yourself
[1:43:38] if you say God I am the weakest
[1:43:41] Christian in this room this morning when
[1:43:43] you get on your knees all of Hell starts
[1:43:47] trembling
[1:43:49] you can you can somebody said you shake
[1:43:52] it was the sermon he said to read you
[1:43:55] shake the gates of the enemy you possess
[1:43:58] the gates of the enemy Satan is afraid
[1:44:01] of you
[1:44:03] all you have to do if Satan's bothering
[1:44:06] you is change the atmosphere
[1:44:10] because the brother said that when the
[1:44:11] eagle and the snake are fighting he said
[1:44:14] all the ego has to do is take that snake
[1:44:18] up into his atmosphere
[1:44:20] and that snake becomes defenseless
[1:44:23] how do you win against the enemy is it
[1:44:26] anything you do I just heard this
[1:44:28] recently it was so beautiful
[1:44:30] the prophet said just humble yourself
[1:44:33] just humble yourself
[1:44:35] [Music]
[1:44:37] I'm gonna I'm gonna get I'm gonna get
[1:44:39] off my notes Here
[1:44:40] because this is how I want to end I'm
[1:44:43] giving you something now I haven't given
[1:44:45] it home so don't tell them
[1:44:49] we know that one of the greatest
[1:44:51] statements in the Book of Esther
[1:44:53] is mordecai telling her what if you've
[1:44:56] been placed in the Kingdom for such a
[1:44:58] time as this
[1:45:00] what if you've been placed in this part
[1:45:03] of Florida in this school building
[1:45:06] Desiring your own building for such a
[1:45:08] time as this
[1:45:10] because one soul needed to come
[1:45:14] brother I don't know where you are at in
[1:45:16] this room this morning but God has kept
[1:45:19] this church here for you
[1:45:21] you should feel so loved and so
[1:45:24] cherished this morning amen
[1:45:27] God withheld what we would say a
[1:45:30] blessing on this church because you
[1:45:32] needed a blessing
[1:45:34] and now I'm praying that The Floodgate
[1:45:36] opens amen
[1:45:38] amen
[1:45:42] and my brother don't feel bad because
[1:45:44] every person in this room right now I
[1:45:46] know because I can feel it in their
[1:45:48] Spirit they'll say brother it was worth
[1:45:50] it
[1:45:52] it was worth the wait waiting for you
[1:45:54] amen amen
[1:45:57] brother Branham said this and then I'll
[1:46:00] just close
[1:46:02] in a super sign
[1:46:04] and he's talking all about
[1:46:07] the promise to Abraham that your seed
[1:46:10] shall possess the gates of the enemy
[1:46:13] and he made this one statement in there
[1:46:16] and this just brought it to today for me
[1:46:20] for such a time as this
[1:46:22] he said talking of Moses
[1:46:25] come into the Red Sea he said
[1:46:29] he knowed he was born for that age
[1:46:34] to manifest the word of God at that time
[1:46:38] I'm telling you friends you can stand to
[1:46:40] your feet musicians you can come
[1:46:43] hmm
[1:46:46] I want you to catch this morning
[1:46:49] despite what you think of yourself
[1:46:52] you've been placed in an age as bad as
[1:46:56] laodicea
[1:46:58] fighting spirits that have been
[1:47:00] Unleashed probably that have never been
[1:47:02] Unleashed before
[1:47:05] you are a warrior of God
[1:47:08] placed in this age and all of that for
[1:47:11] such a time as this
[1:47:14] you have within you what you need
[1:47:18] to make it all the way through
[1:47:21] and and I and I I don't know how to say
[1:47:23] that anymore
[1:47:25] but that's what I want you to get this
[1:47:27] morning despite despite the worst of
[1:47:30] your enemy
[1:47:31] despite this flesh despite the flesh
[1:47:33] that you fight sometimes on one another
[1:47:37] you have what's what you need inside of
[1:47:40] you you have been placed for such a time
[1:47:43] as this
[1:47:45] amen you're you are a lovely group of
[1:47:48] people
[1:47:49] and I thank you for pulling like you did
[1:47:52] I I there's something that amazes me
[1:47:54] about the people of God is when you meet
[1:47:56] him I I've never met maybe I have come
[1:47:59] in contact with some of you most of you
[1:48:01] I think I've never met before but when
[1:48:03] we get together and we're Believers
[1:48:05] there's something that that I always
[1:48:08] feel like I've known you forever
[1:48:10] and we have really
[1:48:13] we have known each other forever You
[1:48:16] Beautiful People and and I and I like to
[1:48:18] say this because of my heart for the
[1:48:19] pastors
[1:48:21] I'll just quote it to you as we go
[1:48:23] that scripture or that quote he says
[1:48:26] you're a lovely group of people
[1:48:28] and the love of God is flowing in here
[1:48:31] but he said Satan won't let it stay that
[1:48:33] way
[1:48:35] he said he'll he'll and now none of you
[1:48:37] take this on for yourself
[1:48:40] he says
[1:48:41] if Satan can't inject something in to
[1:48:45] your midst he'll he'll inject he'll
[1:48:47] bring somebody and inject them now don't
[1:48:49] accept that for yourself now
[1:48:52] it's just so it's just a warning that
[1:48:54] you're a lovely group of people but you
[1:48:55] want to know what he says he says don't
[1:48:58] Clan up
[1:48:59] don't form clicks
[1:49:01] if something happens in the church you
[1:49:03] start praying
[1:49:06] you you join together in prayer and he
[1:49:08] says he says they'll either go out or
[1:49:11] they'll come in and be one of you that's
[1:49:12] the right way to pray
[1:49:14] but then he says and stick with your
[1:49:17] pastor
[1:49:18] because he's ordained to lead you
[1:49:22] through
[1:49:23] you say brother you're lifting up a man
[1:49:25] maybe I am a little bit
[1:49:29] not not a man it's the office that the
[1:49:31] man holds
[1:49:33] and the scripture does say they're
[1:49:35] worthy of double honor
[1:49:37] but I just say that to say
[1:49:39] you're in good hands the hands of a holy
[1:49:43] ghost-led man
[1:49:45] keep pressing on
[1:49:47] keep pressing on no matter what Satan is
[1:49:49] trying to tell you of yourself no matter
[1:49:51] what Satan is trying to do I pray this
[1:49:54] is connecting with you this morning keep
[1:49:56] pressing on you you young and old you
[1:49:59] have been placed for such a time as this
[1:50:02] you young people you grow up in things
[1:50:04] that us older ones didn't have to
[1:50:06] I remember as I went up every grade I
[1:50:08] watched the the sin go down a grade
[1:50:10] every year I went up
[1:50:12] and it's just unbelievable now what you
[1:50:14] go through but you've been placed
[1:50:17] for such a time as this
[1:50:20] you have what you need
[1:50:22] amen keep yielding keep that fervancy
[1:50:24] God bless you and thank you
[1:50:31] God bless you all turn it over brother
[1:50:33] I'm not a singer
[1:50:35] bless you really appreciate you
[1:50:40] [Applause]
[1:50:43] how we thank the Lord for the word of
[1:50:46] God today
[1:50:49] I just knew that the Lord would use our
[1:50:52] brother just to speak to our individual
[1:50:56] needs
[1:50:58] and I think we all are leaving here with
[1:51:01] something that we can take and make
[1:51:03] ourselves uh better Christians amen and
[1:51:07] I just love just a number of statements
[1:51:11] that he made
[1:51:14] um
[1:51:16] he wanted a queen
[1:51:18] that would be submissive not because she
[1:51:21] had to be
[1:51:24] seeing we can preach the gospel in such
[1:51:26] a way that we you know this is your role
[1:51:28] this is your role this is your role and
[1:51:29] I'm gonna force you into your role
[1:51:31] [Music]
[1:51:32] um I think people know what their roles
[1:51:34] are and I remember brother brother
[1:51:37] um Burley Williams coming and preaching
[1:51:39] say the key to unlock submission
[1:51:42] the key to unlocking because he says
[1:51:45] it's just it's in a a woman's nature to
[1:51:48] submit she's designed that way right to
[1:51:51] submit however but the key to unlock it
[1:51:55] is through love
[1:51:57] right and not not not to become
[1:52:00] submissive because she had to be
[1:52:03] right but because she want to be and
[1:52:06] it's a whole different feeling when a
[1:52:08] wife want to submit to her husband and
[1:52:09] just man it's a different relationship
[1:52:12] and and she gets to that spot because of
[1:52:15] how he treats her
[1:52:17] what he does for her she's always his
[1:52:21] Queen
[1:52:22] [Music]
[1:52:29] I just I just I just I was I was just
[1:52:31] blessed I was blessed today and
[1:52:35] um
[1:52:36] Satan came to touch you with that Gospel
[1:52:38] Mission
[1:52:40] when you do wrong
[1:52:41] [Music]
[1:52:43] it's the law of sin working in you it's
[1:52:46] not it's not you it's not you so don't
[1:52:48] beat yourself up that's where Satan
[1:52:51] wants to actually you did this you
[1:52:53] didn't know I didn't you anointed me
[1:52:55] with that Spirit to do that now I'm
[1:52:57] gonna repent and I'm Gonna Keep moving
[1:52:59] on because that does not that is not my
[1:53:01] nature
[1:53:02] I'm a daughter of God I'm a Son of God I
[1:53:05] don't think that we're gonna act that
[1:53:06] way I'm gonna repent I'm gonna tell God
[1:53:08] I'm sorry
[1:53:09] foreign
[1:53:11] Lord I'm sorry
[1:53:14] and I'm moving on
[1:53:16] I ain't gonna waddle in my my thoughts
[1:53:19] look that means Satan cannot you know
[1:53:21] look I don't care what he's done and
[1:53:24] every trap that he set for me the traps
[1:53:27] that he set for me actually he gonna
[1:53:28] fall into him himself
[1:53:31] right
[1:53:32] I'm gonna have Victory
[1:53:34] oh I just I I I was I was blessed I I I
[1:53:39] I I I I was blessed and that that
[1:53:42] scripture that they read
[1:53:44] they shall take away his Dominion so
[1:53:48] this is not you praying and asking God
[1:53:50] to give you Victory and all that Lord
[1:53:51] you're going to rise up and be a victim
[1:53:55] and you're going to take away Satan's
[1:53:57] Dominion in your life
[1:54:00] oh his time is up I I feel like he's
[1:54:02] getting the eviction notice today
[1:54:05] Satan you're out of here
[1:54:07] [Applause]
[1:54:13] he was speaking a man he said brother
[1:54:16] Nestor uh coming with us for the the
[1:54:19] first time today
[1:54:20] three minutes away you know from the
[1:54:23] church and um and maybe God had us for
[1:54:27] such a time as this going through the
[1:54:29] season of transition of change because
[1:54:31] he just wants to just bring somebody
[1:54:33] along and we realized that it wasn't
[1:54:36] just brother Nester
[1:54:38] uh but we would you know we're not just
[1:54:40] that you know when we when we were when
[1:54:42] we came here to this church and we were
[1:54:44] signing the contract and everything they
[1:54:46] were looking like uh y'all do church on
[1:54:48] Wednesday night
[1:54:50] we actually do it on Friday night too
[1:54:52] but we're trying to get y'all a break
[1:54:54] but uh Wednesday night yeah we did we'd
[1:54:56] be here and like okay because none of
[1:54:58] the other churches come on Wednesday
[1:54:59] night
[1:54:59] [Music]
[1:55:02] you do and we're gonna sign this
[1:55:04] contract we'll be here on Wednesday
[1:55:05] nights
[1:55:06] well I I don't know how but there was a
[1:55:09] young lady
[1:55:10] that must have saw us here one Wednesday
[1:55:12] night
[1:55:13] and I told her mama
[1:55:15] they had Church up there
[1:55:17] well her mama been coming for four weeks
[1:55:19] the whole month
[1:55:21] and maybe maybe we were here
[1:55:24] maybe we were here
[1:55:27] for such a time as this
[1:55:31] because we know this ain't uh this ain't
[1:55:33] our home we just pilgrims passing
[1:55:35] through but I will tell you this that's
[1:55:37] the love of God that he will take a
[1:55:40] whole church
[1:55:42] through a year of this because of one's
[1:55:45] soul
[1:55:45] [Applause]
[1:55:47] the Lord that we serve
[1:55:50] will cross a stormy sea
[1:55:53] put his disciples In Harm's Way
[1:55:56] praise God go to sleep on the back of a
[1:55:59] boat because he's trying to get to One
[1:56:02] Soul
[1:56:03] Hallelujah a man that has lost his mind
[1:56:06] I gotta get to that one man you talk
[1:56:09] about value
[1:56:13] that's God's love for one
[1:56:18] and if he'll do that for you what will
[1:56:20] he do for the rest
[1:56:22] so I tell you we just yield to the Lord
[1:56:24] whatever your will is and I agree with
[1:56:27] the prayer that was prayed yes Lord we
[1:56:29] we have submitted some things here and
[1:56:31] we would leave it under your hands but
[1:56:32] if these are not the places that you
[1:56:34] want us to be then block it if it ain't
[1:56:37] where you want us to be you know you
[1:56:38] block it if it's where you want us to be
[1:56:40] you open the door
[1:56:41] but if it's not where you want to be
[1:56:42] just block it
[1:56:44] and we'll find something else
[1:56:50] I know the God we serve is he don't it
[1:56:52] don't it don't take long it don't take
[1:56:54] much don't take a lot of negotiation
[1:56:56] don't take nothing because when it when
[1:56:57] it's your time
[1:56:59] it's your time
[1:57:01] Cincinnati uh brother Calvin encouraged
[1:57:04] our faith when it's time for them to get
[1:57:06] their house and then people say
[1:57:07] um somebody else you know that but the
[1:57:10] Lord told us that that's for us
[1:57:12] so I don't know how it's gonna happen
