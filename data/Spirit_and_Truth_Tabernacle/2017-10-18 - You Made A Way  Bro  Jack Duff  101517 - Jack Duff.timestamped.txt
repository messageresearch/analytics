[49:18] the God that we serve the God that we
[49:21] serve before he actually speaks
[49:22] something he's already thought about it
[49:26] see it's a thought verse and before it
[49:30] becomes expressed in word fashion he had
[49:32] to think about it so a man he was sure
[49:35] before he spoke it that's that's exactly
[49:37] what he wanted to do so if he said it it

[1:04:02] been good and then God has been good and
[1:04:06] and and and we're extremely you know
[1:04:09] just grateful for what the Lord amen is
[1:04:11] done I got a chance to listen to brother
[1:04:13] Joel a man and man I was just texting
[1:04:18] him say brother the Lord used you to
[1:04:20] speak to our church and so so much was
[1:04:24] said a man and making preparation I say
[1:04:28] Lord and and I told him that when you
[1:04:31] when you start talking about boys to me
[1:04:33] and I said no you don't want there's
[1:04:34] somebody living room you know are you
[1:04:36] talking real good right now you know but

[1:04:43] know a little bit Bobby Brown and all
[1:04:45] that acid man you know you you are you
[1:04:47] you you in there now you know you know
[1:04:48] touch something but but you know just a
[1:04:51] real real good thought and I'm just so
[1:04:53] happy to see him you know just relax
[1:04:55] himself and express a man himself you
[1:04:59] know to the people the Lord and I
[1:05:00] believe if if you didn't really get it
[1:05:02] go back and listen to it again because
[1:05:04] there was a lot being said a man in that
[1:05:06] sermon and I just I felt like you know
[1:05:10] all of us were hearing directly from God
[1:05:12] amen sometimes when you're praying
[1:05:15] you're asking God to speak to you about
[1:05:16] certain things it'll send a minister up
[1:05:19] here with what's in your heart
[1:05:20] and they'll speak that right it's up to
[1:05:23] you to actually listen
[1:05:24] sometimes we tune it out if that's not
[1:05:26] what we want to hear man glory to God
[1:05:29] God don't always speak what you want to
[1:05:31] hear amen but he'll speak what you need
[1:05:35] all right he will speak what your knees
[1:05:37] so you know be open to hear the voice of
[1:05:40] God as it comes a man through ministry
[1:05:42] and as it comes through
[1:05:43] just even others that God has placed in
[1:05:46] your life be open to hear his voice
[1:05:47] amen I what I want to do is read a
[1:05:53] scripture and we will prepare for our
[1:05:57] thought today it man
[1:05:58] it's just so good to have everyone in
[1:06:01] the house of the Lord a man this morning
[1:06:02] I'm gonna read from a John 15 we're
[1:06:05] gonna just read a couple scriptures and
[1:06:08] then what the Lord's kind of placed in
[1:06:11] my heart I want to just line up a couple
[1:06:14] of things and then I want to kind of go
[1:06:16] into since we're celebrating 15 years in
[1:06:18] ministry I want to go into a man maybe a
[1:06:22] more personal testimony a man as to how
[1:06:24] spirit and truth became its spirit and
[1:06:27] truth a man some of you may know that
[1:06:29] some may not know it so a man I'd like
[1:06:31] to just kind of share personal testimony
[1:06:34] regarding that Amen on today and since
[1:06:37] we're celebrating these 15 years we want
[1:06:39] to remember sister wisdom and prayer
[1:06:41] amen brother wisdom reached out and said
[1:06:43] that she got sick just did not rest well
[1:06:48] last night and they just you know decide
[1:06:50] to stay home today
[1:06:52] you know trusting that the world would
[1:06:53] touch her body and that she'll recover
[1:06:54] and so we want to remember her in prayer
[1:06:57] and a man and you know we'll go from
[1:07:00] there also there's others that we don't
[1:07:02] see this morning we'll also remember
[1:07:03] them in prayer too amen on the day but
[1:07:05] turn with me to John 15 and I found this
[1:07:12] very appropriate because we're
[1:07:13] celebrating 15 years a man so John 15 a
[1:07:17] man for these 15 years of ministry it
[1:07:22] says this in verse 1 says I am The True
[1:07:24] Vine and my father is the husband man
[1:07:28] verse 2 says in every branch in me that
[1:07:33] beareth NOT fruit he taketh away and
[1:07:36] every branch that beareth fruit he
[1:07:39] purchased it he purchased it that it may
[1:07:44] bring forth more fruit now I need you to
[1:07:47] understand that the purging process is
[1:07:49] when the tree is actually being cut
[1:07:52] right it's being cuts being trimmed and
[1:07:55] the purpose of that trimming is so that
[1:07:58] they could bring forth more fruit a man
[1:08:01] glory to God there's a season where you
[1:08:04] have to go through some trimming some
[1:08:06] cutting and your life but that's so that
[1:08:09] you can bring forth more fruit amen
[1:08:12] stay with me here now you clean through
[1:08:15] the word which I have spoken unto you
[1:08:18] abide in me and I in you as the branch
[1:08:21] cannot bear fruit of itself except it
[1:08:25] abide in the vine no more can ye except
[1:08:30] ye abide in me I am the vine ye are the
[1:08:34] branches he that abideth in me and I in
[1:08:38] him the same bringeth forth much fruit
[1:08:41] for without me you can do nothing if a
[1:08:46] man abide not in me he is cast forth as
[1:08:49] a branch and is withered and men gather
[1:08:51] them and cast him into the fire and they
[1:08:55] are burned if ye abide in me and my
[1:08:59] words abide in you ye shall ask
[1:09:02] you will and it shall be done unto you a
[1:09:05] man the Lord and a blessing to the
[1:09:07] reading of his word let's just bow in a
[1:09:09] word of Prayer
[1:09:11] today father we are thankful for the
[1:09:15] opportunity to read your word we know it
[1:09:19] takes the Holy Spirit to make this thing
[1:09:21] clear to us that we've read that it
[1:09:23] won't just go in one ear and out the
[1:09:24] other but Lord may you make a difference
[1:09:27] in our hearts in our lives God we're
[1:09:30] even praying today that your Holy Spirit
[1:09:32] would have the preeminence amen and this
[1:09:34] portion of the service God if you want
[1:09:37] to come down and feel somebody because
[1:09:39] the Bible says as Peter yet spake the
[1:09:41] words the Holy Ghost fell on the people
[1:09:43] so you want to come down and feel
[1:09:45] interrupt our thought today God and do
[1:09:47] exactly what you need to do because we
[1:09:49] realized that it's only a true
[1:09:52] experience with you that makes the
[1:09:53] difference in our hearts and in our
[1:09:55] lives
[1:09:56] it's only the true experience that that
[1:09:59] Lord that gives us power to overcome the
[1:10:01] enemy without that Lord we are just
[1:10:05] sounding brass and tinkling cymbals so
[1:10:06] God give us a true experience with you
[1:10:08] we want to remember Amen sister wisdom
[1:10:11] today in prayer not feeling well in her
[1:10:13] body enemy attacking her God may you
[1:10:16] bring healing to her also the kids
[1:10:21] they're her grandkids for sister
[1:10:22] Tracey's kids
[1:10:23] we pray that you just touch them as well
[1:10:26] they're not feeling well so help them
[1:10:27] God through this little season a man and
[1:10:31] whatever it is that Satan is putting on
[1:10:33] them we cursed it now this route and we
[1:10:34] command it to loose them and let them go
[1:10:36] other saints not feeling well in their
[1:10:38] body God that oppressed their way out to
[1:10:40] the house of Lord today touch them God
[1:10:42] is our prayer others that are missing
[1:10:44] today Lord look upon them as well and
[1:10:47] just administer to their hearts into
[1:10:49] their knees we give you all the glory
[1:10:50] all the honor and all the praise in
[1:10:52] Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless
[1:10:56] you you can be seated
[1:11:02] man for our title you know my thought
[1:11:09] just kind of will title it you made a
[1:11:13] way and just again thinking about you
[1:11:16] know these 15 years a man of ministry
[1:11:20] all that God could help us through a man
[1:11:25] these these years only only God could do
[1:11:28] it I was you know thanking on the
[1:11:32] scripture a man I believe there in the
[1:11:36] Book of Luke it might be Luke 17 where
[1:11:39] there were 10 men that were healed by
[1:11:44] Jesus they were healed of their
[1:11:47] blindness and only I think one of them
[1:11:50] turned around to go back to the Lord
[1:11:52] Jesus and to thank him for what he had
[1:11:55] done so any time we reach milestones
[1:11:57] like this I I feel it would be robbery
[1:12:02] if I didn't just stop and tell the Lord
[1:12:04] thank you
[1:12:05] amen just just just tell the Lord thank
[1:12:08] you for what he's done a man for so I'm
[1:12:11] grateful a man for the 15 years the
[1:12:14] Bible says in Psalms 127 say except the
[1:12:17] Lord build the house they labor in vain
[1:12:21] that build it except the Lord keep the
[1:12:23] city the watchman waketh but in vain and
[1:12:27] I'm so glad to know that it's God that
[1:12:29] built this house a banner it's god
[1:12:33] that's watched over this city a man is
[1:12:36] God that has done and I was looking at a
[1:12:38] statistic a man on the internet and this
[1:12:41] that they said how many churches were
[1:12:44] closed this year and there were two
[1:12:46] stats that went out and this was back in
[1:12:48] October of 2013 you know I think that
[1:12:53] this witness that came out but they said
[1:12:57] they want one one researcher the
[1:13:00] Southern Baptist researcher they said
[1:13:03] anywhere from 4,000 to 7,000 churches
[1:13:06] would close their doors every year right
[1:13:08] and then another one was a
[1:13:13] article called 1313 issues for churches
[1:13:16] and in 2013 and in that article they put
[1:13:19] the Espen a little higher they said
[1:13:21] somewhere between 8,000 to 10,000
[1:13:24] churches were likely closed this year a
[1:13:27] man and I and I'm so glad that a man we
[1:13:31] didn't fit that category hallelujah I'm
[1:13:36] so glad that we didn't fit that category
[1:13:39] I'm so glad that God made a way Amen God
[1:13:44] kept the doors open God did it amen and
[1:13:46] and and I'm grateful for what the Lord
[1:13:48] has done a man a man that there's many
[1:13:54] that can't say that but but God has done
[1:13:56] a man something for us and he allows us
[1:13:59] just to kind of keep coming here and you
[1:14:01] know just to join his presence we're so
[1:14:04] grateful so grateful for that you know
[1:14:07] just just recently there was something
[1:14:09] you know I want to just read a little
[1:14:12] quote here from this message the angel
[1:14:17] of the Lord a man the angel the Lord
[1:14:20] the Prophet made a statement here says
[1:14:22] now many times in the meeting the angel
[1:14:27] the Lord which appeared and many of you
[1:14:29] know about it appears like that night
[1:14:33] and all down through the time it looks
[1:14:34] like a big pillar fire about that thick
[1:14:38] and about that big and it comes in a
[1:14:43] licking whirling going right that's the
[1:14:48] way to pillar fire piers it comes in a
[1:14:50] licking whirling going and you know it
[1:14:55] says brother branham he imitates the
[1:14:57] sound of the angel Lord coming to him
[1:14:58] say thousands times thousands has seen
[1:15:01] it it's appeared visibly and say here

[1:17:31] that's how that's not he described the
[1:17:33] pillow fire that's what we saw in the
[1:17:35] video right he says it comes a licking a
[1:17:38] whirling Amen
[1:17:39] a going glory to God just constantly
[1:17:42] moving and that's exactly what we saw
[1:17:44] right so so so here you know the Prophet
[1:17:47] goes on say now he said when they were
[1:17:48] at this meeting there a man in in Fort
[1:17:52] Wayne Indiana you saved some of the
[1:17:54] people beginning to see the pillar fire
[1:17:55] and it came so visible that there was a
[1:17:58] young lady on the on the piano she was
[1:18:01] playing amen the song the Great
[1:18:03] Physician now it's near and brother
[1:18:04] Branham was sitting there he was praying
[1:18:06] for this little boy and you know now
[1:18:08] he's praying for the little boy say he
[1:18:10] eat it he couldn't understand what was
[1:18:12] going on amen now he say thought the US
[1:18:15] should turn on the light and he said man
[1:18:18] that lights so bright why don't the man
[1:18:19] just turn the light down you know he's
[1:18:21] steaming up your friendly people and
[1:18:22] that's what he's thinking is mine this
[1:18:24] man Stephen praying for these people
[1:18:25] he's gonna turn that light on the try to
[1:18:26] distract me he thought it was the devil
[1:18:28] he said but but as he started noticing
[1:18:30] he say the light just got brighter and
[1:18:33] brighter and brighter as I started
[1:18:35] approach him him he said a young lady on
[1:18:37] the piano saw the same light and when
[1:18:39] she starts she jumped up off the piano
[1:18:41] began to scream and praise God and she
[1:18:44] took off running the piano kept playing
[1:18:48] the piano kept playing the Holy Ghost
[1:18:51] was in control of the service and the
[1:18:54] piano kept playing never missing a note
[1:18:59] that's what we're talking about right
[1:19:02] amen but you know as I as I you know I
[1:19:05] hear essentially say that young lady
[1:19:06] sought of the pillar of fire she saw the
[1:19:08] angel the Lord and many others that
[1:19:10] night said that that little boy he said
[1:19:12] when he when he saw an angel come he
[1:19:14] don't remember whether he dropped the
[1:19:15] boy I'm not but all he knows that the
[1:19:17] boy was out his arms and the boy was
[1:19:18] healed right but when he saw the
[1:19:20] presence of a God of God it created a
[1:19:23] response and I'm telling you church
[1:19:25] ain't man what we saw on video God want
[1:19:28] to do greater
[1:19:28] Amen I think he's ready to do greater
[1:19:31] but we got to keep the Lime Street
[1:19:34] you gotta keep the lines straight if
[1:19:36] we're gonna see God do more I'm on
[1:19:38] expectation a man to see him do more
[1:19:40] praise the name of the Lord all right so
[1:19:44] you know as we just kind of look at this
[1:19:46] a man I I'm just I'm just you know
[1:19:50] expressing my heart to the Lord
[1:19:52] he's the one that's made away he's the
[1:19:55] one that's made away a man now when I
[1:19:57] look at um you know we talked about 15
[1:20:01] years of ministry the Lord just kind of
[1:20:03] took me you know to a little website
[1:20:06] that I wanted to look at and and I was
[1:20:08] just kind of looking at what are some of
[1:20:10] the expectations of a 15 year old so if
[1:20:15] a parent was dealing with a fifteen year
[1:20:17] old what are some of the things you
[1:20:18] should be expecting amen when you're
[1:20:20] dealing with that fifteen year old right
[1:20:22] and you know and one of the things that
[1:20:24] says that most of them at that age most
[1:20:27] fifteen year olds are independent right
[1:20:30] but the majority struggle to recognize
[1:20:33] their limitations now most of them are
[1:20:35] already independent and and I'm taking
[1:20:38] this and I'm putting it in the spiritual
[1:20:39] room because you know at fifteen your
[1:20:42] mama ain't gotta feed you no more huh
[1:20:45] actually if you're independent you
[1:20:47] already know how to cook for yourself if
[1:20:50] you're really independent
[1:20:52] you ain't waiting for mama to come home
[1:20:53] and put nothing in the pot you already
[1:20:55] got in the pot you can take care of
[1:20:57] yourself by the time you're 15 come on
[1:21:01] somebody
[1:21:02] Amen yeah I mean you know how to do
[1:21:04] certain things if there's an expectation
[1:21:06] of maturity when you reach 15 and if we
[1:21:12] have that expectation of maturity for a
[1:21:15] natural child what about the Church of
[1:21:17] God's Amen there's an expectation of
[1:21:20] maturity when we reach 15 listen then a
[1:21:28] 15 year old begins to gain
[1:21:29] self-confidence they began to desire
[1:21:32] more freedom
[1:21:34] hallelujah 15 year old they began they
[1:21:37] began to gain self-confidence they began
[1:21:40] to desire more freedom and they said now
[1:21:43] when this happened this
[1:21:44] tends to lead to frequent disagreements
[1:21:47] over the rules I want to read it again
[1:21:56] when they reach 15 right they begin to
[1:22:01] get a little bit more self-confidence
[1:22:03] because they've been well talk now that
[1:22:06] can tell you what the Bible say I'm
[1:22:09] gonna say amen to the light they can
[1:22:13] tell you what the Bible say in 15 they
[1:22:15] can tell you what the Prophet said at 15
[1:22:20] and it's okay to they can do that that's
[1:22:24] that's what you're trying to get them to
[1:22:25] but but you understand that 15 you still
[1:22:28] don't know everything huh right and
[1:22:32] there's still some things to learn in
[1:22:33] life but you know here it is they begin
[1:22:36] to get some self-confidence they begin
[1:22:37] to desire more freedom and this tends to
[1:22:40] leave the frequent disagreements over
[1:22:43] the rules the 15 year olds are starting
[1:22:46] to challenge why we got certain things
[1:22:49] in place that's what happens when they
[1:22:54] get 15 but the eventual they begin to
[1:22:57] realize amen the rule was there so it
[1:23:00] could protect you a man it's not say him
[1:23:03] to you is to protect you come on
[1:23:07] somebody right and then so you know
[1:23:09] another thing that happens a man with 15
[1:23:11] year olds that said most girls
[1:23:14] oh by the time they turn 15 they have
[1:23:16] reached their full height now I didn't
[1:23:20] mean they didn't say that they wouldn't
[1:23:21] grow any more say they reached a full or
[1:23:29] high
[1:23:31] and there's other ways they can grow
[1:23:38] right but you got to understand that I
[1:23:41] mean growth then stop at 15
[1:23:43] there's still other ways they made that
[1:23:46] you can grow and the other thing they
[1:23:48] said that's that forever for a boy when
[1:23:51] he reaches 15 he still may have a couple
[1:23:54] more years where he will grow now
[1:23:56] oftentimes you know in you know a parent
[1:23:59] parents are raising children and when
[1:24:01] they see that boy just kind of hit 15 I
[1:24:03] love Sonny go through a growth spurt and
[1:24:05] the clothes you just bought for him I
[1:24:07] mean you just bought him
[1:24:09] hundreds of dollars spent and all of a
[1:24:11] sudden this boy come home overnight
[1:24:13] something happened to him and the
[1:24:15] clothes they they what we call higher
[1:24:17] waters and the board can't go out like
[1:24:20] that so you back out buying some old
[1:24:22] clothes and you get you finally get that
[1:24:24] taken care of and next thing you know
[1:24:26] overnight that brought two more inches
[1:24:28] right you won the where this came from
[1:24:31] but it just shows at 15 they haven't
[1:24:33] completely stopped growing oh my god my
[1:24:37] god and I'm here today as a church we
[1:24:40] reach 50 but we haven't completely
[1:24:43] stopped your word and we can grow in
[1:24:46] multiple ways we can grow spiritually by
[1:24:50] going deeply in the Word of God we can
[1:24:53] go with members it's multiple ways that
[1:24:56] we can grow everybody we were just
[1:25:03] talking about here on Wednesday night
[1:25:05] you know how the commissioners are going
[1:25:07] to all the world right we all got a
[1:25:10] responsibility of carrying the gospel
[1:25:12] somewhere amen all of us can grow some
[1:25:15] where a man you might not get any you
[1:25:18] know as far as when they said up the
[1:25:20] woman when she has 15 hurts her her
[1:25:23] height probably stops right there right
[1:25:25] her height but there's other areas that
[1:25:27] she can grow she can grow mentally
[1:25:30] spiritually she can still grow right so
[1:25:32] so as a church we want to continue to
[1:25:34] grow don't stop at 15 and then let's
[1:25:37] keep growing and I understand when we're
[1:25:39] drawing there will be what we call
[1:25:41] growing pains
[1:25:43] i'ma say it again i'ma say it again as
[1:25:46] we grow there will be growing pains hey
[1:25:51] man so when you know your start filter
[1:25:54] man I feel a little pain this change in
[1:25:56] that changing it's okay it's all for
[1:25:59] good purpose come on church hey man I
[1:26:03] one day i'ma tell you I'll go back to
[1:26:05] that sermon that I preached at our 15th
[1:26:08] year anniversary all right but I just
[1:26:12] thank God for these things you know as I
[1:26:14] I just begin to kind of comb the
[1:26:16] Scriptures well amen and just kind of
[1:26:19] find in some scriptures that ended I
[1:26:21] mean that had the you know the number 15
[1:26:24] whether it was the 15th chapter or the
[1:26:26] 15th verse in a particular book you know
[1:26:29] in Chapter I just kind of found about 10
[1:26:31] of them that I want to share with you
[1:26:33] genesis 3:15 says I will put enmity a
[1:26:37] man between thee and the woman and
[1:26:40] between thy seed and her seed it shall
[1:26:42] bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise
[1:26:46] his heel a man and brother branham tells
[1:26:49] us clearly since there is no student who
[1:26:52] does not know that the seed of the woman
[1:26:53] was like what was was Christ who came by
[1:26:57] the instrumentality of God apart from
[1:27:00] human intercourse it is also just as
[1:27:02] well known that the predicted bruising
[1:27:05] of the Serpent's head was in an actual
[1:27:07] actuality of prophecy concerning what
[1:27:10] Christ would accomplish against Satan at
[1:27:12] the cross there at the cross Christ what
[1:27:15] bruised the head of Satan while Satan
[1:27:17] would bruise the heel of the Lord
[1:27:20] a man genesis 3:15 I also found Exodus
[1:27:24] 14 and 15 a man it says this and the
[1:27:28] Lord said unto Moses wherefore Christ I
[1:27:33] want to me speak unto the children of
[1:27:36] Israel that they go forward I lelou you
[1:27:39] why cry speech a man I found another one
[1:27:43] in Joshua 24 and 15 a man who says this
[1:27:47] and if if see me
[1:27:50] unto you to serve the Lord choose you
[1:27:54] this day whom ye will serve whether the
[1:27:56] gods which your father's served that
[1:27:59] we're on the other side of the flood or
[1:28:01] the gods of the mmm aright and whose
[1:28:04] land he keeps well but asks for me a man
[1:28:08] in my house we will serve the Lord I
[1:28:12] love that scripture in John 4:24
[1:28:15] and 15 can I go on the First Samuel
[1:28:19] chapter 30 a man starting at verse 15
[1:28:22] look at what happens here and David said
[1:28:25] to him cast down bring me down to this
[1:28:27] company and he said swear to me by God
[1:28:30] that God would neither kill me Lord
[1:28:32] deliver me into the hands of my master
[1:28:33] and I will bring thee down to this
[1:28:35] company verse 16 the winner yet brought
[1:28:38] him down the hole there they were spread
[1:28:40] about spread abroad upon all the earth
[1:28:42] eating and drinking and dancing because
[1:28:44] all the great spoil they had taken out
[1:28:46] of the land of the Philistines and out
[1:28:48] of the land of Judah and David smoked
[1:28:50] them from a trial life even up to the
[1:28:53] evening of the next day and their escape
[1:28:55] not a man of them say four hundred young
[1:28:57] men which rolled upon camels and Flynn
[1:28:59] and David I like this part
[1:29:02] recovered all that the Amalekites had
[1:29:06] carried away and David rescued his two
[1:29:09] wives said God brought a restoration to
[1:29:13] David amen that started in verse 15 I'm
[1:29:18] looking to God to bring a restoration to
[1:29:20] us and let it start in the year our
[1:29:23] fifteenth year
[1:29:24] can I go in a little further Daniel
[1:29:27] chapter 3 verse 15 now if he be ready at
[1:29:32] what time you hear the sound of the
[1:29:34] cornet flute harp sackbut psaltery and
[1:29:37] dulcimer and all kinds of music you fall
[1:29:40] down and worship the image which I have
[1:29:42] me well but if you worship not ye shall
[1:29:45] be cast the same hour into the midst of
[1:29:48] the burning fiery furnace and who is
[1:29:50] that car that shall deliver you
[1:29:52] my hair was a challenge issue in verse
[1:29:55] 15 but Shadrach Meshach and Abednego
[1:30:00] answered and said to the king o
[1:30:03] Nebuchadnezzar we have not cared for the
[1:30:05] answer via this manner if it be so our
[1:30:08] God whom we serve is able to deliver us
[1:30:11] from the burning fiery furnace and we
[1:30:14] and he will deliver us out of an Han or
[1:30:16] King but if not I like this be it known
[1:30:20] unto thee O king that we will not serve
[1:30:24] thy God's nor worship the golden image
[1:30:27] which thou has set up so the challenge
[1:30:31] was issued and the response was given
[1:30:33] and when those boys say let's let it be
[1:30:37] written in your books that we not gonna
[1:30:38] bow later on God showed up and delivered
[1:30:42] those boys from that fire firs not just
[1:30:44] showed up heat showing them in the fire
[1:30:50] hallelujah we invited them to join us in
[1:30:53] a mr. whatever we're going through I
[1:30:57] look at a man Luke 15 I won't read it
[1:31:00] all but I'll just tell you if you read
[1:31:01] it later on there you see the parable of
[1:31:04] the lost sheep you all says you also see
[1:31:07] the parable of the lost coin and you
[1:31:10] also see the parable of the lost son all
[1:31:14] found in Luke 15 Alleluia John 4 in 15
[1:31:20] it says this amen the woman saith unto
[1:31:24] him Sir give me this water that our
[1:31:29] first not neither come hither to draw so
[1:31:33] this woman at the whale when she met
[1:31:34] Jesus and then they had a real a real
[1:31:38] nice connection there and when she met
[1:31:41] Jesus and and she said she said now you
[1:31:43] asking me for water and everything don't
[1:31:45] you know we we not suppose we kind of
[1:31:47] having this conversation my people don't
[1:31:51] kind of fellowship with your people you
[1:31:52] know and so we worship over here y'all
[1:31:54] worship over there are all this type of
[1:31:56] division was there he say if you knew
[1:31:58] who you was talking to you and asked me
[1:32:00] for some water say the water I give up
[1:32:03] in a spring up out of y'all out of your
[1:32:05] out of your out of your bed
[1:32:06] is solely to spring up to new life say
[1:32:08] the water I give us something totally
[1:32:10] different to what you're drawing she
[1:32:12] said sir I need that kind of water and I
[1:32:14] wonder how many need that type of water
[1:32:16] today the water that Jesus has to offer
[1:32:19] glory to God see John 4 is where we get
[1:32:22] our church name from it's from that
[1:32:24] story because he totally says say he say
[1:32:27] you know you know you talk about worship
[1:32:29] he'd say but there comes a time a man
[1:32:32] when God's gonna be looking for some
[1:32:33] true worshipers in saying they that
[1:32:35] worship Him must they came they came to
[1:32:39] it no other way but they must worship
[1:32:40] Him in spirit and in truth
[1:32:43] hallelujah glory to God hey man so you
[1:32:46] know that's why the church name come
[1:32:48] from if birth out of that story with the
[1:32:50] the interaction with the woman at the
[1:32:52] well let me go on the first John chapter
[1:32:54] 2 and 15 it says love not the world a
[1:32:58] man neither the things that are in the
[1:33:00] world
[1:33:00] If any man love the world the love of
[1:33:02] the father is not in him hey man if
[1:33:06] we're gonna serve God let's serve God
[1:33:07] with everything we got and and I and I
[1:33:10] got one more that I want to read before
[1:33:12] we just break into something here glory
[1:33:14] to God Ruth 1 and 15 now I'm always
[1:33:20] blessed by this particular passage
[1:33:24] because I could go through this church
[1:33:26] with most of the saints and I could
[1:33:29] probably you know I could recall how
[1:33:32] many of you all got here how you all
[1:33:35] became a part of a man this this
[1:33:37] ministry that there there are different
[1:33:39] things that happen along the way that
[1:33:41] you know you just you don't forget a man
[1:33:44] you just don't forget right and and and
[1:33:47] and you know I remember you know brother
[1:33:49] and sister wisdom they were praying
[1:33:51] about a church to go to I knew we knew
[1:33:55] sister wisdom we knew brother Andrew we
[1:33:59] knew sister Tracy amen brother wisdom
[1:34:01] hadn't relocated here just yet and and
[1:34:04] when it came down you know they were
[1:34:05] praying and looking for a church to go
[1:34:07] to it and and and and here one day they
[1:34:11] walked in I think somehow way they got
[1:34:12] connected with sister Michelle and
[1:34:14] system shell and Biden said y'all can
[1:34:16] come in just just visit you know once
[1:34:18] one Sunday so I went out when they
[1:34:20] came to visit a man that Sunday morning
[1:34:23] whatever was that were preached was
[1:34:25] exactly what they were talking about the
[1:34:27] night before their house God picked up
[1:34:29] their whole conversation and preached it
[1:34:31] back to him sometime when God do that
[1:34:33] that's a confirmation to you that you're
[1:34:36] in the right place right so they like
[1:34:38] they just kind of held offense like wow
[1:34:40] that was that was something they went
[1:34:41] went home and and the next day you know
[1:34:43] I mean the next week they came back and
[1:34:45] here it is again and happened a second
[1:34:47] time what they talked about the day
[1:34:49] before preach from the pulpit like oh my
[1:34:52] this has gotta be gone so our brother
[1:34:54] wisdom you know he he uh he looked at
[1:34:57] sister wisdom and just kind of gave me
[1:34:59] say I got my answer he just said yeah I
[1:35:02] got my answer that on the on I need that
[1:35:05] I need to ask them or I got man side no
[1:35:07] one's for the beat and since the wisdom
[1:35:09] looked at him and she gave him the
[1:35:11] response she said she said where you go
[1:35:14] i'ma go say where you worship are my
[1:35:18] worship say your God gonna be my god
[1:35:21] that your people don't be my people
[1:35:23] that's the way it's gonna be for me so
[1:35:25] ever since that time they've been right
[1:35:28] here and you know what we find that
[1:35:33] story in the Book of Ruth chapter 1
[1:35:36] starting at verse 15 can we read it and
[1:35:43] she said Behold our sister-in-law is
[1:35:45] going back until her people unto her God
[1:35:49] returns out after my sister-in-law verse
[1:35:53] 16 the roof said and treatment not to
[1:35:55] leave thee all to return from following
[1:35:58] after thee we need some
[1:36:01] conviction like that they know that they
[1:36:04] were they where God want them to be no
[1:36:07] matter what trial come upon going

[1:37:55] appreciate each one of you all those

[1:38:44] range a man if I were to but now the 15
[1:38:47] year people is only a few of us it's
[1:38:52] only a few of us 15 year people all
[1:38:55] right but I'm gonna share with you all
[1:38:57] the story of how everything got started
[1:38:59] and and the reason I do that I learned a
[1:39:01] long time ago that if you don't give you
[1:39:03] a testimony the devil would give you one
[1:39:06] if you don't say what it was like then
[1:39:09] the devil gonna make up a story on you
[1:39:12] and everybody gonna go believe in what
[1:39:15] the devil got to say come on somebody
[1:39:17] that's why you gotta be you got to give
[1:39:20] your own testimony alright but you know
[1:39:24] but but when you know there's a couple
[1:39:26] things that's fine I want to go back to
[1:39:28] John 15 that's the last scripture that I
[1:39:30] that I left and I said I had 10 10
[1:39:32] scriptures the last one is John 15 and I
[1:39:35] want to just kind of go back and read
[1:39:37] that and I just want to give you a
[1:39:39] personal testimony here you know for how
[1:39:42] this church got started let's go back
[1:39:45] and read actually before before I read
[1:39:49] John 15 just just the personal testimony
[1:39:54] of me getting started ministry one of
[1:39:58] the things whatever the thing that
[1:39:59] happened to me in my life

[1:45:03] Jesus was 33 when he died so what he was
[1:45:07] telling me right then that I need to die
[1:45:08] to myself and surrender to what the Lord
[1:45:11] had for me so I that was that was number
[1:45:15] four and then I happened to go to my
[1:45:17] grandma's Church
[1:45:18] my grandma this is where I learned got
[1:45:20] my Pentecostal roots at that grandma's
[1:45:22] Church and I walked in church one Friday
[1:45:24] we was I don't know the Nords of Sunday
[1:45:26] we were going for family and friends
[1:45:28] there something like that and I walked
[1:45:29] in church and after church
[1:45:31] her pastor Bishop John D Alexander he
[1:45:34] came up and had glasses on me and my dad
[1:45:37] was standing there talking and he walked
[1:45:38] up to me and he had his glasses then he
[1:45:41] dropped them and he looked at me it's a
[1:45:44] young man yes sir when you're gonna do
[1:45:46] what the Lord told you to do say sir aye
[1:45:50] aye sir Lord I said no no no no when
[1:45:54] you're gonna do what the Lord told you
[1:45:55] to do sir he said let me tell you
[1:45:59] something he said if you ever need a
[1:46:01] place to practice you come and you come
[1:46:05] right here to my church you can practice
[1:46:07] right here now that was a Pentecostal
[1:46:09] preacher opening his door so when you
[1:46:12] see me kind of opening the door to other
[1:46:14] young ministries that's because somebody
[1:46:16] did that for me all right so you know he
[1:46:19] said if you need a place to practice
[1:46:20] Micah I couldn't believe it you know
[1:46:21] that that he was doing that and you know
[1:46:23] there was a I said well you know and I
[1:46:26] never actually got a chance to take him
[1:46:28] up on that offer but I said lord I thank
[1:46:29] you for that and you know but it was
[1:46:31] another confirmation and one day you
[1:46:33] know my grandma she had come to the
[1:46:35] house and was all suppose to be going
[1:46:36] out to dinner and and grandma stopped me
[1:46:40] before we could go out she said Jack the
[1:46:41] Lord told me to say something jack I say
[1:46:43] Oh Lord
[1:46:44] girl my gotten to say the Lord told me
[1:46:46] he called me and he wants you to get
[1:46:48] started I said grandma I love the Lord
[1:46:50] said no that ain't it Jack God wants you
[1:46:52] to get started with a ministry say Oh
[1:46:53] Lord grandma okay thank you
[1:46:56] you know I just left it like that but
[1:46:57] that was six I told y'all on Franklin
[1:47:00] Wednesday night my seventh one was when
[1:47:01] I went out to my cousin's house fixing
[1:47:03] his computer
[1:47:04] when I'm fixing the computer there he
[1:47:07] was reading Joshua one over the top of
[1:47:09] me I was he asked me about how his
[1:47:11] church today and I told him I didn't go
[1:47:12] to church today he like what you mean
[1:47:14] you didn't go to church sister so now I
[1:47:15] didn't go to church they have a house
[1:47:17] church last week I didn't go to church
[1:47:18] last week what in the world so he said
[1:47:21] he still can't know this is God is
[1:47:22] calling you and they began to tell me
[1:47:24] his old testimony how he got called and
[1:47:26] and how he was so faithful just
[1:47:28] preaching to him and his wife that was
[1:47:29] all in the church for about 10 years
[1:47:30] just him and his wife but he was
[1:47:32] faithful doing that he said how God does
[1:47:34] begin at he just sharing this old
[1:47:36] testimony I say Lord I think if it is
[1:47:38] then he took me to Joshua 1 he just ran
[1:47:40] over Joshua 1 to me I said lord I know
[1:47:42] this is you speaking to me and I say
[1:47:44] this this is this is it I just I had to
[1:47:46] come to a place while just you know
[1:47:48] surrendering to God so as I got to that
[1:47:51] point there is a scripture that God gave
[1:47:53] me that's where John 15 comes in can we
[1:47:56] read this again says that I am The True
[1:48:00] Vine and my father is the husbandman see
[1:48:02] it's one thing to just kind of go out
[1:48:04] doing stuff because you feeling
[1:48:06] something but there's another thing when
[1:48:07] you base it on the word
[1:48:09] can I go further y'all it's this okay
[1:48:11] today a man a man I said I I'm The True
[1:48:15] Vine and my father is a husband man
[1:48:17] every branch in me that beareth NOT
[1:48:19] fruit he taketh away and every branch
[1:48:21] that bears fruit he purchased it and
[1:48:23] that it may bring forth more fruit now
[1:48:25] right there I got stuck I got stuck on
[1:48:28] that script because I'm like Lord why
[1:48:29] you know I'm a part of a fruitful
[1:48:31] ministry why would you take me out you
[1:48:34] know why would you do that you say say
[1:48:35] he said just look at and say he said
[1:48:38] even though it's bearing fruit right say
[1:48:40] he that he take away and every branch
[1:48:42] that beareth fruit he purges in that it
[1:48:46] may bring forth more fruit right so so
[1:48:49] he says so what he could begin assumes
[1:48:50] that sometime you got to go through a
[1:48:52] cutting process in order to bring forth
[1:48:54] more fruit even that ministry I would
[1:48:57] have to go through a cutting process in
[1:48:59] order to bring forth more fruit can I
[1:49:02] tell you something 2015 we lost a lot of
[1:49:05] people right here in the church it was a
[1:49:07] cutting process but when I act with
[1:49:09] those that have been here five years
[1:49:10] another more Stila
[1:49:12] and that group the
[1:49:14] any other group it shows that it was a
[1:49:20] proving process in order to bring forth
[1:49:22] more fruit but at that time the way I
[1:49:30] was looking at like Lord are you calling
[1:49:32] me out of this ministry because you want
[1:49:34] to bring forth more fruit here at this
[1:49:35] church not only there but you also want
[1:49:38] to bring forth more fruit in my life so
[1:49:40] I said Lord I'm okay I'm just I'm just
[1:49:42] I'm sitting with that now you know I I
[1:49:44] I'm a just just drop the sin brother
[1:49:47] branham was talking about in a
[1:49:48] particular quote here he was saying how
[1:49:51] sometimes a pastor the way that he has
[1:49:53] to hear from God say he don't see digits
[1:49:54] he don't see visions he says so what
[1:49:57] happens to him is that God he goes by
[1:50:00] inspiration of presentment that's what
[1:50:02] the prophecy so he goes by the
[1:50:04] inspiration of present men he says so
[1:50:07] God will present something to that
[1:50:08] pastor and he has to just kind of flow
[1:50:10] with and God will prove himself and what
[1:50:12] he presented to him he don't have no
[1:50:14] vision it's just by faith and here I all
[1:50:17] that no vision I had a scripture John 15
[1:50:20] so I'm sitting there and I'm thinking on
[1:50:22] the scripture you know I kept on going
[1:50:24] said now you clean through the word
[1:50:26] which I've spoken unto you about of me
[1:50:28] and I in you as the branch cannot bear
[1:50:30] it's bear fruit of itself except it
[1:50:32] abide in the vine no more can you accept
[1:50:35] you bother me now I'm the vine ye are
[1:50:38] the branches he that abideth in me and
[1:50:39] I'm him the same bringeth forth much
[1:50:41] fruit for without me you can do nothing
[1:50:42] and as I'm just sitting there processing
[1:50:45] different things become I remember an
[1:50:46] older sister when she heard that we had
[1:50:48] started a church she's sitting word
[1:50:50] through her grand oh she say tell tell
[1:50:52] brother Jack that whatever he start
[1:50:53] preaching keep preaching don't change
[1:50:57] what he's safe from his start say cuz
[1:50:59] many churches have failed because the
[1:51:01] preacher begin to change let down the
[1:51:03] stand say keep preaching I say well I'm
[1:51:05] gonna take that as advice and I'ma keep
[1:51:07] that right but as I was sitting there
[1:51:08] processing this descriptor just you know
[1:51:10] me and the Lord personally we went to a
[1:51:12] convention
[1:51:14] up in Pennsylvania and when I was at the
[1:51:17] convention I'm like Lord you know and I
[1:51:19] hadn't even told my wife about this
[1:51:20] scripture I'm just holding onto it you
[1:51:22] know I went to the convention and and
[1:51:23] his brother brother David Muscovy walks
[1:51:26] up to the pulpit and he says you know he
[1:51:29] wanted to preach a sermon and he says
[1:51:31] let's turn to John 15 and he opens up
[1:51:34] his Bible he begins to read John 15
[1:51:36] these same scriptures and the title of
[1:51:37] his sermon was fruit much fruit more
[1:51:42] fruit soon as he off soon as you said
[1:51:44] John 15 and said that time I said God
[1:51:46] you speaking to me I said right there
[1:51:48] and and I'm just I listen to every word
[1:51:50] that man who sent me because I knew God
[1:51:52] was was speaking directly to me and it
[1:51:54] was at that moment I said Lord now I
[1:51:56] know this is you I don't know what to do
[1:51:58] with this I say if we started church
[1:52:00] what's going to be the name at that
[1:52:01] moment I prayed and God said spirit and
[1:52:03] truth Tabernacle and I held on to it and
[1:52:06] I knew that was in the Bible I said just
[1:52:08] held on to us I ain't saying I didn't
[1:52:10] say then to my wife I can get to
[1:52:11] ecstatic just just I'm gonna just leave
[1:52:13] this alone well I waited two years two
[1:52:16] whole years and as I waited that's why I
[1:52:19] said my man's gift make room for itself
[1:52:21] you just wait on the Lord God God are
[1:52:23] doing in his time
[1:52:24] amen so you know I waited I waited that
[1:52:26] for two years and then you know the Lord
[1:52:28] started dealing with my wife and dreams
[1:52:30] and you know and as we begin to get the
[1:52:32] interpretation for the dreams you know
[1:52:33] we knew that God was moving so we start
[1:52:36] talking a little bit about churches
[1:52:37] today well what's gonna be the name of
[1:52:38] the church I say it's Spirit of Truth
[1:52:39] Tabernacle I said well this is I walk
[1:52:43] through the whole process just what God
[1:52:44] said two years ago and I just been
[1:52:46] waiting on God to deal with you see
[1:52:47] sometimes you got you got to learn how
[1:52:49] to wait you can't just I mean something
[1:52:51] you gotta wait to God let God allow
[1:52:53] other people to see the whole picture
[1:52:55] and God deal with them in their own
[1:52:56] individual ways that's you've dealt with
[1:53:01] us I said you know when you got your
[1:53:03] wife standing with you then you can
[1:53:04] stand hello somebody right and so you
[1:53:10] know when we were you know we before we
[1:53:12] left you know the church we were
[1:53:14] fellowshiping with we met without with
[1:53:16] our pastor and we talked to him and at
[1:53:18] that time a man we went in to meet with
[1:53:20] them I just told them I said you know
[1:53:24] pastor I just want to let you know
[1:53:26] I just feel that whatever the Lord wants
[1:53:30] me to do whatever he's called me to do
[1:53:32] whatever he wants me to do I say I feel
[1:53:34] free that I can do what God called me to
[1:53:37] do
[1:53:37] amen I said I feel free and say I had to
[1:53:41] know with him myself
[1:53:42] I had to have my personal revelation
[1:53:44] that I was free to do what God called me
[1:53:46] to do somebody else might not have felt
[1:53:49] that way but I say I believe I'm free
[1:53:51] right and long as I believe it and I can
[1:53:54] see it in the Bible and I can see the
[1:53:55] message and I'm gonna go do what God
[1:53:56] called me to do and I just left it like
[1:53:59] that you know so the question was
[1:54:01] actually my wife are you ready for this
[1:54:02] and I love her response I'll never
[1:54:05] forget it I'll never forget it she said
[1:54:09] she just looked and said nobody can ever
[1:54:12] be ready for this nobody I don't care
[1:54:16] how much you prepare how much you try to
[1:54:19] prepare you'll never be ready for this
[1:54:21] but all you can do is you yourself to
[1:54:23] God and just allow him to get all the
[1:54:24] glory and all the honor out of your life
[1:54:26] I walked out of that office proud of my
[1:54:29] wife now I'm gonna tell you I'm still

[1:57:06] and don't bring you away don't bring my
[1:57:13] wife you don't lost your mind
[1:57:18] praise the Lord somebody I learned that
[1:57:21] from my pastor he took his wife
[1:57:23] everywhere he went
[1:57:24] you always saw them together all right
[1:57:29] all right man I learned it even
[1:57:32] sometimes sitting at meetings you
[1:57:33] sometimes she have to be there his wife
[1:57:35] specially if it's another sister uh-huh
[1:57:37] his wife gonna be there Oh glory to God
[1:57:41] you know I'm going back to this
[1:57:44] testimony but you know even nowadays you
[1:57:47] need a witness
[1:57:50] when you're counseling people cause you
[1:57:53] don't know who's gonna come through here
[1:57:55] oh yeah I just need to talk to the
[1:57:57] pastor okay me and this brother right
[1:57:58] here gonna talk to you together
[1:58:01] why because cuz I need a witness just in
[1:58:04] case you say I said something that I
[1:58:06] didn't say a man is some little you're
[1:58:09] some little boy come in and say I did
[1:58:11] something to him that I didn't do
[1:58:13] I want a witness even some little girl
[1:58:17] right I just want to talk to the pail
[1:58:20] you're gonna talk to the pastor and his
[1:58:21] wife I do that to protect you and me if
[1:58:28] I'm doing that you should be doing that
[1:58:30] don't be running over nobody house you
[1:58:32] Mary tell my to what you don't go to the
[1:58:39] house like that you bury it
[1:58:45] that's how you keep the devil on a man
[1:58:49] Church right that's how we keep the
[1:58:51] devil out you got the raise of an octave
[1:58:54] you know your merit don't do stuff like
[1:58:56] that get out of there as fast as you
[1:58:58] possibly can it's best if you know you
[1:59:01] got an attraction don't hold their hand
[1:59:03] too long shake and run ain't the truth
[1:59:16] oh god bless you you keep on playing
[1:59:22] with that devil all right you'd be
[1:59:25] further than you ever thought you'd ever
[1:59:27] go and then then you come want to say a
[1:59:29] lot I'm so sorry he can't forgive you
[1:59:33] but if you could avoid it avoid amen all
[1:59:39] right so I've learned that a long time
[1:59:41] ago that's why I don't counsel sisters
[1:59:43] by myself and it's based somebody get
[1:59:45] into crying and everything I think
[2:00:01] I'm going back to my testimony is this
[2:00:09] how we keep the devil honest that this
[2:00:11] this exactly I would keep the devil out
[2:00:13] and and sometimes the young people might
[2:00:15] not realize what I'm doing so sometimes
[2:00:17] good just to stop and just break things
[2:00:19] down I mean we keep our eyes on the
[2:00:22] devil keep my eyes on the devil and and
[2:00:25] he always looking for some kind of way
[2:00:27] to get in trying to get a little
[2:00:29] foothold and like please don't do that
[2:00:31] because that's the devil right as soon
[2:00:33] as you get in oh I didn't mean that I
[2:00:35] know I know you did that's why I was
[2:00:37] telling you ahead of time I know you
[2:00:39] wouldn't mean to do it that's why I was
[2:00:41] telling you ahead of time don't allow
[2:00:42] the devil to get you there amen
[2:00:45] the stay as far away as you possibly can
[2:00:47] amen

[2:01:37] sisters get an apartment brothers don't
[2:01:39] be hanging out at that sister partment

[2:03:05] so finally when we first when we decided
[2:03:10] to start the church we were in my
[2:03:12] mother-in-law's driveway at her house in
[2:03:16] Greenacres and that's where me and my
[2:03:19] wife had that conversation about what's
[2:03:20] the name is Church for me and I told the
[2:03:22] Spirit of Truth Tabernacle she was right
[2:03:24] there with me and we started a church
[2:03:26] there in our home in Lantana Florida and
[2:03:30] we were meeting there a man for about a
[2:03:33] year
[2:03:34] just just us my wife my three daughters
[2:03:36] I used to take and we have I passed back
[2:03:40] then so I had a whole bunch of paper I
[2:03:43] print out all my cokes and I had all
[2:03:44] this paper and we had a little PM and
[2:03:46] there sitting in the house and and and
[2:03:49] man it was it was rough preaching to
[2:03:50] that church y'all I'm telling you it's
[2:03:53] rough a man then folk members a man and
[2:03:57] my oldest daughter and I'd be up there
[2:03:59] reading out and I'd do something like
[2:04:00] this and she'll sit in the audience and
[2:04:02] she'll do you know everything I do she
[2:04:05] just mimicked me right I say what a what
[2:04:08] a what a member here you know and you
[2:04:12] know something's going about a year you
[2:04:14] know like that and you know and and and
[2:04:16] what i would do periodically because i
[2:04:18] wanted my family still stand fellowship
[2:04:19] i go to different services not
[2:04:20] fellowship i remember one time the lord
[2:04:22] had told me to stay home and minister's
[2:04:24] sermon i said no I'm going for
[2:04:25] fellowship today so I went all the way
[2:04:27] up okay - and I and I went the minister
[2:04:29] it seemed like brother smile has changed
[2:04:31] this whole sermon once I walked through
[2:04:32] the door and he show preach something
[2:04:36] and I walked out I said Lord I ain't
[2:04:38] coming back until God tell me to come
[2:04:40] back told me to stay home and I didn't
[2:04:44] obey him so I hate show put it on me
[2:04:46] today and I thank God that brother
[2:04:47] smiler preached to that wing it helped
[2:04:50] me to be obedient and as we were there
[2:04:53] in the house it took about a year and
[2:04:58] and within that year this pulpit that
[2:05:01] you see is my wife saw me up there
[2:05:03] struggling trying to preach and my wife
[2:05:05] say I got to find him a pulpit that's
[2:05:07] how you know she
[2:05:08] behind you all right so she went on eBay
[2:05:11] and she found this pool but I was going
[2:05:13] to school for my Master's down in in
[2:05:16] Fort Lauderdale and she found a church
[2:05:18] in Fort Lauderdale was getting rid of
[2:05:19] pulpit I think for $50 and she say she
[2:05:22] said we gotta you know let's go in and
[2:05:24] get that pulpit for yourself okay pulpit
[2:05:27] she got that pulpit I went down there
[2:05:29] picked it up put it inside my car and I
[2:05:31] brought it back to the house and man
[2:05:32] this thing ain't light this thing like
[2:05:36] this heavy this is solid wood but my
[2:05:38] wife used to help me lift it in and out
[2:05:40] of garage and put it inside the church
[2:05:43] is set up in liberal for service
[2:05:45] I appreciate away from that about a year
[2:05:57] we got on the one day our preach the
[2:05:59] sermon I said yeah that's a prophesy
[2:06:01] don't be surprised if people start
[2:06:02] joining us I prophesied that but three
[2:06:04] weeks later after that we went forth got
[2:06:07] a telephone call sister Dixon
[2:06:09] she was she was she had been going out
[2:06:11] to you know Okeechobee she just needed
[2:06:13] to change because the drive was just
[2:06:15] really wearing a body down so she needed

[2:06:19] so she wanted to come to church she
[2:06:20] should say brother Jack i'ma have my son

[2:06:38] sister say y'all having church today say

[2:06:47] there's my mother-in-law and she comes
[2:06:50] she come be like and all three of them
[2:06:54] showed up on the same day for the same
[2:06:57] service and we had church and and I tell
[2:07:00] you what my mother-in-law been with me
[2:07:03] since that time and I am so grateful a
[2:07:06] man that she's been with me
[2:07:08] during that same time mama you know
[2:07:11] started coming and mom it mama it made a
[2:07:14] comment she said you know I I felt like
[2:07:16] I wanted to come and help the ministry I
[2:07:18] just wanted to come and be a help to the
[2:07:19] ministry then later on she said well I
[2:07:21] found out the minister was a help to me
[2:07:24] praise the Lord praise the Lord
[2:07:28] and and in that and so we were still
[2:07:31] fellowshiping in the in the home and
[2:07:33] then sister Cobb she happened to be
[2:07:35] going up and down the streets with her
[2:07:37] business and she was there in Green
[2:07:38] Acres and she saw the building said for
[2:07:40] rent she said y'all need to go check out
[2:07:41] this building's for rent and Green Acres
[2:07:43] I said okay I'll go check it out and I
[2:07:45] went and look and and I looked at that
[2:07:48] building and space I said it had
[2:07:51] partitions I've been all kind of stuff I
[2:07:53] said we can't do not what this can't put
[2:07:54] no Church in here but my wife is a woman
[2:07:57] of vision all right and she looked at
[2:07:59] say oh yeah we can have Church in here
[2:08:01] not this fall out and knock that wall
[2:08:03] out and do this and we'll paint this
[2:08:04] we'll paint that we all see that look
[2:08:06] the way this paint and stuff like this
[2:08:08] in here that's just Erika's touch if it
[2:08:11] would've been my touch white walls all
[2:08:16] around but she made it feel well I gave
[2:08:19] him a welcoming presence and so you know
[2:08:22] she was there just getting we'll get
[2:08:24] somebody and they can do this to you I
[2:08:25] said okay alright I'm gonna trust your
[2:08:26] judgment on this and we had a brother
[2:08:29] brother Richard he come in he started
[2:08:30] knocking this side and knocking it out
[2:08:32] of next thing I listen to people in here
[2:08:36] and I said man we can yeah we can have
[2:08:39] Church in here and you know and and I
[2:08:41] realized that at that time when we were
[2:08:43] knocking down the walls that was very
[2:08:46] significant for me in my in my ministry
[2:08:48] because the people that God was bringing
[2:08:50] to this church was people from other
[2:08:52] facets of the message and in the message
[2:08:55] we had walls built if you didn't believe
[2:08:57] what we believe you on the other side of
[2:09:00] the wall but in order to get us from the
[2:09:02] same side of wall we got to knock the
[2:09:03] wall down then it put us all in the same
[2:09:07] room
[2:09:07] glory and when we've not been washed
[2:09:13] down I begin to see some things and God
[2:09:14] just begin to you know just show you
[2:09:17] know that he was with this remember I
[2:09:19] told you that sometimes what God have to
[2:09:20] do is just show a preacher he just give
[2:09:25] him a little something he don't he don't
[2:09:26] give him a vision he just put a little
[2:09:28] something in his spirit and that's God
[2:09:30] leading a man and brother branham called
[2:09:32] it
[2:09:32] a man a let me just get that again I
[2:09:37] don't want to misquote it my lord
[2:09:43] the the inspiration of resentment right
[2:09:45] that's what he called the inspiration of
[2:09:47] resentment so you know when when when we
[2:09:50] were there for a number of years and
[2:09:52] many I think I could just go through
[2:09:53] this church I remember sister Michelle
[2:09:55] when she got there to the first church
[2:09:57] she was we working on it we were working
[2:10:01] on the church and I think she's talking
[2:10:04] system it's just a cop and on the phone
[2:10:07] and say I got a church yeah we got a
[2:10:10] building what I handle eight worth in
[2:10:17] Greenacres all right I was just I got to
[2:10:21] stop by to pick up some this is Michelle
[2:10:23] came and she walked in and she was
[2:10:26] sitting there in see yeah we watch what
[2:10:29] you see out your mouth cuz she released
[2:10:31] something out of her mouth and she was
[2:10:33] in there she see I can see myself
[2:10:35] sitting right here
[2:10:39] since Michelle sitting right there and
[2:10:44] been with us for a long time I certainly
[2:10:46] appreciate her
[2:10:47] I remember her and sister team and it
[2:10:51] was trying to decide what they was gonna
[2:10:53] do and they there was they were we've
[2:10:55] gone to meeting up in Georgia and I let
[2:10:57] him hold my car you know to drive on up
[2:10:59] there and and when they got into the car
[2:11:02] there was a song plan and they thought I
[2:11:06] set him up but I didn't it just that's
[2:11:08] just the way it was but the song start
[2:11:10] playing it wasn't easy but it was worth
[2:11:12] it
[2:11:13] and they say brother Jack did this
[2:11:15] that's not me that's God right and I you
[2:11:19] know and everybody that knows if you've
[2:11:20] come from another church we always I
[2:11:25] mean I'm top of each other immediately
[2:11:26] coming from another I'm not talk about
[2:11:28] you was you know out of church for a
[2:11:29] while and I'm talking you just left
[2:11:31] another church my advice when we sit
[2:11:34] down and talk them be make sure you've
[2:11:35] talked to your pastor because I'm gonna
[2:11:37] talk to him
[2:11:37] anybody can lift a hand be the witness
[2:11:40] that that has happened
[2:11:41] all right okay that's the way we do
[2:11:44] things you know why we do that that keep
[2:11:45] fellas just amongst the churches we
[2:11:47] don't get the devil no space we don't
[2:11:49] give him a space but you know so when
[2:11:54] they all showed up and then you know God
[2:11:57] just began to add you know to the church
[2:12:00] and and as we got a little larger a man
[2:12:04] and like I said sister Tina system
[2:12:06] shells in that car both of them at the
[2:12:08] same time made a decision that we're
[2:12:09] gonna make spirit into my church home
[2:12:11] and and I remember you know we was at
[2:12:13] sister Tina house and sister Michelle's
[2:12:15] daughter
[2:12:17] Shanice she walked up to me and she said
[2:12:20] are you preacher at the church and I
[2:12:24] looked at I say I guess I am the
[2:12:26] preacher at the church you know but uh
[2:12:29] but you know we were we went through all
[2:12:31] that and God just beginning adhere and
[2:12:33] there we got up to about you know 40 or
[2:12:35] 50 at that church and I said man wing
[2:12:37] I'm be able to add no more we can have
[2:12:39] meetings we couldn't do anything so you
[2:12:40] know we gotta have to take a step of
[2:12:41] faith we gotta find somewhere else and
[2:12:43] that's when the Lord just begin to put
[2:12:44] and I think around that same time that's
[2:12:46] when brother Brown beginning to come
[2:12:48] glory to God
[2:12:50] brother Brown was coming out there to
[2:12:51] the other church and he would bring
[2:12:52] sister Brown with him right and and then
[2:12:55] you know if brother Brown was there I
[2:12:57] remember and I'll never forget that
[2:12:59] taste things that happened that you just
[2:13:00] don't forget all right and I so so
[2:13:02] before we come here brother Caleb Duron
[2:13:05] had come and he preached a sermon out
[2:13:06] there and he stopped in the middle of
[2:13:08] sermon said brother Jack you lean in a
[2:13:10] particular way God said go that way he
[2:13:13] gonna be with you and I was trying to
[2:13:15] get all the brothers to support you know
[2:13:17] us coming here cuz our rent was getting
[2:13:18] ready to double and I'm like man it's
[2:13:21] already tough paying this how're we
[2:13:23] gonna be able to do that I said oh no he
[2:13:25] said he said you leave mr. Wingo that
[2:13:26] way gotta be with you you know what
[2:13:28] we've been here 10 years and we pay rent
[2:13:30] every month amen
[2:13:37] I'll be honest I some time they do call
[2:13:39] for it but we get it to him God has been
[2:13:46] a good God has been good but uh you know
[2:13:50] so as I was you know just you know we
[2:13:52] the Lord spoke that and kind of gave
[2:13:54] confirmation through the brother
[2:13:56] prophesy like that so we took it and we
[2:13:58] came on here and man I remember that
[2:14:00] first service we were just marching
[2:14:02] around this place doing the Jericho
[2:14:03] March and and I knew my brother knew how
[2:14:06] to build and everything and we want we
[2:14:09] want to be specific and getting him to
[2:14:11] come in here and help us you know and
[2:14:13] and you know you call them people like
[2:14:15] that you know you got ulterior motives
[2:14:17] you know that you you know that just
[2:14:19] hopefully my brother coming here and
[2:14:23] building and got out as soon as he could
[2:14:25] right in there and the reason he did
[2:14:27] that cuz he told me ladies say you don't
[2:14:29] want to be around that anointing you
[2:14:31] don't want to be around a lot so you
[2:14:33] break down in it and nobody want to be
[2:14:36] around that anointing right so but when
[2:14:38] God did what he did in my brother's life
[2:14:41] now he can't get away from the Norton he
[2:14:44] create the anointing and I thank God for
[2:14:50] him and his wife when y'all go next door
[2:14:52] y'all gonna see what my sister loved us
[2:14:54] that that's that's how ministry but when
[2:15:07] we came here and I remember then we had
[2:15:10] those chairs that jog on sit on next
[2:15:12] door chairs been with us a long time and
[2:15:15] we didn't get rid of them they tell a
[2:15:16] story when y'all come to pray you get on
[2:15:21] your knees the cushions think about
[2:15:23] sister Dixon she was our first charter
[2:15:27] member and she made those chairs I mean
[2:15:29] those does she made the covers for
[2:15:31] people to sit on cuz them had them
[2:15:34] shares was hard but then we took we made
[2:15:37] them print cushions when we got here
[2:15:39] right but you know we've been using them
[2:15:41] praying praying use them as prayer
[2:15:43] cushions and man just what a what a
[2:15:45] blessing has been but uh but
[2:15:47] I remember when we bought these chairs
[2:15:49] we bought 120 of them for the upper room
[2:15:53] right yes that's what we did we bought
[2:15:56] 120 for the upper room experience and
[2:15:58] and we had that just a few weeks ago I
[2:16:01] start out I got more he want to do but
[2:16:06] when we bought them chairs and brother
[2:16:08] Brown he was losing this ice night and
[2:16:10] brother Brown came to church the ones
[2:16:13] one Sunday and we was up here you know
[2:16:15] just worshiping and he walked in and I
[2:16:18] think he could only see out one eye
[2:16:19] brother Brown got over here right with
[2:16:21] just Amanda City and he looked sat down
[2:16:27] and put his arm on the chair he liked it
[2:16:32] y'all don't y'all know steppin okay man
[2:16:37] I never forget that he was just so
[2:16:39] excited you know just just seeing what
[2:16:41] the Lord was doing and and in church I
[2:16:44] mean that the list just goes on and on
[2:16:46] and I believe I was we were going to a
[2:16:53] camp meeting to print to preach at the
[2:16:56] tent and that year I didn't want to be
[2:16:59] at the tent I didn't want to be there
[2:17:01] I'm like man and a couple reasons I'm
[2:17:03] like no reach outside the tent I don't
[2:17:05] know I don't know about that I'm like I
[2:17:06] don't really want to be there now you
[2:17:07] know we end up going in with me and
[2:17:09] brother smiling we end up going and and
[2:17:12] I remember watching brother smiley
[2:17:13] preach that Friday night and there was a
[2:17:14] big buck big big huge bug just come out
[2:17:17] of nowhere and just hit him in the back
[2:17:18] while he was preaching I said lord if
[2:17:20] they happen to meet him on a night I
[2:17:21] think the sermon gonna be done cuz I
[2:17:25] can't handle this and by God's grace he
[2:17:28] said some rain and when the rain came
[2:17:30] that pushed the bugs away I say thank
[2:17:32] God and that night we would preach him
[2:17:34] and you know and underneath the tent
[2:17:36] brother Solomon sister Naomi brother
[2:17:39] Colima all of them is really clean but
[2:17:41] he you know when he in church yeah I
[2:17:44] mean I'll never forget them you know we
[2:17:46] were there we just had a good time just
[2:17:48] around the Word of God and and and then
[2:17:51] I think a few months later we were there
[2:17:52] at brother France and and I preached
[2:17:54] again and
[2:17:55] and then you know it was during that
[2:17:58] time brother Solomon insisting Elmen was
[2:18:00] praying about you know what church they
[2:18:02] should go to and I brother saw her say
[2:18:05] you talk to us tonight and they only
[2:18:06] said not what you think about brother
[2:18:07] Jack just I think he can be my pasta and
[2:18:11] way back there I me wanna go to the 10th
[2:18:13] but God needed me at the 10th because
[2:18:15] there was a family there that was
[2:18:18] looking to come back home they were from
[2:18:20] Florida right
[2:18:21] so God orchestrated all of that through
[2:18:23] the Johnsons coming we got sister sure
[2:18:27] right and since the Shirelles father is
[2:18:32] the one that introduced for the solid
[2:18:35] minute to the message he walked up to
[2:18:38] him one day he was witnessing to me say
[2:18:39] God sent a prophet and you missed it
[2:18:41] what would you do what would you do
[2:18:46] somebody walked up to you and said God
[2:18:48] send a prophet and you missed it what
[2:18:50] prophet what you're talking about
[2:18:52] but it sparked something in them and it
[2:18:55] look at look at what God is doing look
[2:18:58] at what God is doing I just - Sam and
[2:19:02] her brothers I remember sister Sam and
[2:19:05] sister London anybody remember them them
[2:19:09] two sisters my god you know they went
[2:19:12] you would see them from church to church
[2:19:14] to church to everywhere use that them
[2:19:17] two sisters was there and I said man I'd
[2:19:20] mind I'm sisters I admire sister Sam
[2:19:23] it's just a real honor I just I just I
[2:19:25] always appreciated them and you know
[2:19:27] they were at a church and you know so
[2:19:29] just a few things changed there and they
[2:19:31] were looking for a place to fellowship
[2:19:33] God allowed him to come here and make
[2:19:35] spirit in truth their home right I
[2:19:37] remember those days I remember those
[2:19:40] days
[2:19:40] and through sister Sam we got a brother
[2:19:45] praise the Lord for that right
[2:19:50] marking hurts a man came through that
[2:19:53] and just I could I can't go through all
[2:19:56] y'all but y'all know I know your story I
[2:19:59] know your story I know the samuel kids
[2:20:05] was going to church with a dad and the
[2:20:07] dad we don't understand nothing we don't
[2:20:09] know nothing we don't daddy we don't
[2:20:11] those daddy came to me was having a
[2:20:13] fellowship like this night yeah I gotta
[2:20:14] be careful about having these
[2:20:15] fellowships as brother Samuel came to
[2:20:17] the fellowship and after the fellowship
[2:20:19] he pulled me to the side he said my kids
[2:20:21] say they don't know nothing they don't
[2:20:22] understand nothing and you know I'm a
[2:20:25] musician I go from church to church he
[2:20:27] said they what they say they want to
[2:20:28] come to this church so I'm leaving them
[2:20:31] in your hands and they dropped off keys
[2:20:39] and all of them we thank God for all the
[2:20:43] summer kids I mean what what what
[2:20:45] talents what talents right and you know
[2:20:49] just just thinking about how God just
[2:20:51] orchestrated all of this but it took a
[2:20:53] step of faith and as I go back in my
[2:20:56] mind and just I really just really
[2:20:58] reflect on all these things
[2:20:59] all I can say is God you made a way you
[2:21:02] did this this is nothing that brother
[2:21:05] Jack did nothing that my family did this
[2:21:08] is this is all God and and I just have
[2:21:10] to take a moment just to tell them thank
[2:21:12] you just to tell them thank you pray
[2:21:17] with me
[2:21:22] father I just just wanted to take a
[2:21:28] little trip down memory lane today
[2:21:32] reflecting on your goodness your mercy
[2:21:38] that has been given to us for these 15
[2:21:42] years just as we move from our house to
[2:21:49] the first church from the first church
[2:21:51] to where we are currently we know we've
[2:21:54] reached this 15 year point and God there
[2:21:57] you still may cause us to grow to expand
[2:22:01] along this journey you you allow the
[2:22:03] school to start there's so much that
[2:22:07] you've done God through the years and
[2:22:09] how grateful we are for the things that
[2:22:12] you've done our prayers that should help
[2:22:16] us to remain flexible that we could move
[2:22:22] Lord as you would call us to move that
[2:22:23] we would do two things that you would
[2:22:25] call us to do that we wouldn't just be
[2:22:27] satisfied with where we are we're
[2:22:33] certainly grateful for what you have
[2:22:37] done and we're grateful for what you're
[2:22:38] doing now but we got we know there's
[2:22:40] more that you want to do in the future
[2:22:42] each one god I look at every face has a
[2:22:47] story every one God has a testimony and
[2:22:52] I could just sit here and I could just
[2:22:53] go through Lord how each one came and
[2:22:57] how you orchestrated I could go through
[2:23:00] that but God I just want to stop and say
[2:23:03] thank you because Spirit of Truth would
[2:23:06] not be spirit and truth if it wasn't for
[2:23:10] your people making it that I pray your
[2:23:14] blessings upon each family a pretty
[2:23:17] encouragement I pray your strength I
[2:23:19] think about mother Tillman Lord who have
[2:23:24] you called home but before she left
[2:23:27] God how she was just touched by the love
[2:23:30] of people Lord and how they how we just
[2:23:34] encircled and
[2:23:35] around it brother Brown gosh she was
[2:23:37] touched by that she remained faithful
[2:23:44] God would grateful some you've called
[2:23:48] home and we realized that my dad was one
[2:23:50] of them brother Mike oh my god Lord a
[2:23:54] certainly one that just means so much to
[2:23:56] all of us but you called them home for
[2:23:58] the hochi the God knew that the fruits
[2:24:02] that the tree it was pruned it was cut
[2:24:05] so they could bring forth more fruit
[2:24:07] look at what's coming out a even think
[2:24:09] about brother and sister Robles so many
[2:24:14] God I'm so grateful the Lord from the
[2:24:21] bottom of my heart I just want to say
[2:24:22] thank you thank you Jesus thank you
[2:24:30] Jesus may you bless us as we go forth
[2:24:33] give us another 15 years
[2:24:35] if you've Terry Lord give us another 15
[2:24:38] years keep us together and keep keep the
[2:24:40] enemy out Lord we know he don't like
[2:24:42] this and he'll do everything he can to
[2:24:44] try to draw a wedges and all that other
[2:24:46] kind of stuff but Lord keep the devil
[2:24:48] out help us to realize that there's
[2:24:50] nothing but the devil you've been so
[2:24:53] good to us

[2:25:01] you we adore you it's in Jesus Christ's
[2:25:06] name that we pray amen let's give the
[2:25:12] Lord a hand of praise

[2:25:26] Lord for all things brother Solomon acts
