[13:45] amen God bless you Saints it's so good
[13:48] to be here I uh wanted to uh go and see
[13:51] brother uh Chris and the Saints down
[13:53] there in beckway and uh I was trying to
[13:56] plan it out I thought well I gotta fly
[13:58] through Miami I'd like to see brother
[14:00] Jack in the church and we looked at
[14:02] different ways to making it work and it
[14:03] just wouldn't work out I thought well I
[14:06] guess another time but this morning we
[14:08] got to Miami and the FAA all their
[14:10] computers were shut down and God said no
[14:12] you're going to stay so I'm I'm here and
[14:15] happy to be here
[14:17] but uh it's it's always a pleasure to be
[14:20] here with you all I I really I really
[14:22] consider you all family and uh really
[14:25] appreciate you I I am sorry we stole
[14:27] sister Rebecca
[14:29] um because I know she's family here but
[14:32] we she's been a real blessing to us and
[14:35] Sister Sarah was just at the church
[14:37] visiting and uh she had a wonderful
[14:39] special I told Brother Jack it just
[14:41] blessed blessed our heart so you know I
[14:43] don't know what brother Jack does on
[14:45] Wednesday nights he says he goes through
[14:46] uh some scriptures and stuff and I want
[14:49] to read uh just a scripture here while
[14:51] we're standing and then we'll speak on
[14:53] it a little bit if you want to turn over
[14:55] to Psalms chapter 1
[14:58] you know thinking back as a kid
[15:01] Psalms chapter 1 sticks in my heart
[15:03] every uh everybody has different
[15:05] experiences as a kid but I had a a Godly
[15:08] old cowboy out on a ranch in Western
[15:10] South Dakota read this to me as a kid
[15:12] and it always stuck with me
[15:14] so we want to read this together Psalms
[15:16] chapter 1 blessed is the man that
[15:19] walketh not in the counsel of the
[15:21] ungodly nor standeth in the way of
[15:23] Sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the
[15:26] scornful but his Delight is in the law
[15:29] of the Lord and in his law doth he
[15:32] meditate day and night and he shall be
[15:35] like a tree planted by the rivers of
[15:38] water that bringeth forth his fruit in
[15:41] his season his Leaf also shall not
[15:44] wither and whatsoever he doeth shall
[15:46] prosper now the ungodly are not so but
[15:50] are like the chaff which the wind
[15:52] driveeth away
[15:53] therefore the ungodly shall not stand in
[15:56] the Judgment nor sinners in the
[15:58] congregation of the righteous for the
[16:00] Lord knoweth the way of the righteous
[16:02] but the way of the ungodly Shall Perish
[16:05] let's just say a little word of prayer
[16:06] and then I'll have you be seated
[16:07] heavenly father it's a privilege to be
[16:10] here tonight and it's a privilege to be
[16:12] here because of the Saints and brother
[16:14] Jack but most of all Lord It's a
[16:16] privilege to be here because you're here
[16:18] you've promised to be here with us
[16:20] wherever two or three are gathered and
[16:22] wherever you are is where we want to be
[16:24] so we welcome you into our midst we
[16:27] thank you for all your blessings and we
[16:29] commit this service to you in Jesus name
[16:31] amen you can go ahead and be seated
[16:34] uh I want to tell another little story
[16:37] about South Dakota
[16:39] and the kind of the topic I want to talk
[16:43] about tonight is related to a an
[16:45] experience I had there so I want to kind
[16:48] of just
[16:50] it I'm going to give a title but I don't
[16:52] want this to be a big old sunday sermon
[16:54] this is more just a Home Folks
[16:56] discussion you know how sometimes
[16:59] something needs to be said as a family
[17:00] and you sit around the table and you
[17:02] have a good discussion so I'm not going
[17:05] to be doing a big text and a big bunch
[17:08] of stuff but just a discussion and but I
[17:10] did want to give it a title because this
[17:12] title came from a bumper sticker that I
[17:14] saw in South Dakota and the the bumper
[17:17] sticker and the title is Born Again
[17:19] Savage
[17:20] now I have to say
[17:23] the first time I saw this bumper sticker
[17:25] I was back visiting uh my family in
[17:28] South Dakota and I saw this car it was a
[17:30] beat up old I don't remember what it was
[17:32] a Volkswagen or something and it was
[17:34] weaving in and out in traffic and
[17:35] honking the horn and the lady was
[17:37] throwing her fist out the window and
[17:39] gestures we won't mention and I saw this
[17:42] and I thought well that's right and all
[17:43] I could see was the Savage part
[17:46] why the Savage and so so as I went on
[17:50] then a few years later I went back just
[17:53] this last year with my wife to South
[17:55] Dakota and we visited Custer South
[17:57] Dakota it's in the Black Hills
[17:59] and there was a shop in there a Native
[18:02] American shop owned by a Native American
[18:04] lady
[18:05] and I went in the shop and I was looking
[18:07] around and it was pretty and all this
[18:09] and all of a sudden I see this pile of
[18:12] bumper stickers and it says Born Again
[18:13] Savage and I look out
[18:16] and sure enough there's that car and I
[18:19] thought okay you know and and to be
[18:21] honest I was a little offended the first
[18:23] time I had seen that bumper sticker and
[18:26] and so I got to talking to this lady and
[18:27] I said you know tell me about this
[18:29] bumper sticker and she said well I'm a
[18:31] Native American she's like I believe in
[18:33] the god of the Son and the god of the
[18:35] wind and the god of whatever all gods
[18:38] she believed in and I thought well
[18:39] that's kind of like a little
[18:40] denominational there you know you're
[18:42] multiple gods but you know you go on the
[18:45] sun god instead of the Son of God but
[18:48] anyway she she explained that she was
[18:52] really annoyed that Christians got to be
[18:54] born again and she didn't get to be born
[18:57] again as a Native American
[18:59] so she claimed to be a born-again Savage
[19:03] well I I couldn't I couldn't really you
[19:07] know understand that quite and I
[19:09] couldn't really agree with her but the
[19:10] more I got to thinking about it I
[19:13] realized that it actually does describe
[19:15] us as Christians quite a bit because as
[19:19] Paul would say in Romans chapter 7 he
[19:22] says for I know that in me that is in my
[19:24] flesh dwelleth no good thing
[19:27] for to will is present with me in other
[19:30] words he wants to do what's right this
[19:32] Spirit within him that God placed in him
[19:34] wants to do what's right but how to
[19:36] perform that which is good I find not
[19:41] and then he says I find then a law that
[19:45] when I would do good evil is present
[19:47] with me so we find that
[19:50] all of us have a part our flesh that is
[19:54] like a Savage and we have something that
[19:57] God placed in us from before the
[19:59] foundation of the earth his seed and
[20:02] then that seed brings forth and Sprouts
[20:04] forth in life as we receive the baptism
[20:06] of the Holy Spirit and we start our
[20:08] Christian walk and that part is the
[20:10] born-again part amen
[20:12] so
[20:13] you know but the thing about it is is
[20:15] that Satan likes to get us focused on
[20:18] one side too heavily or the other side
[20:21] too heavily and he does that on the
[20:22] individual basis as well as on the
[20:25] church basis so we have in our area
[20:28] there in Jeffersonville many of you have
[20:29] been there we have a number of churches
[20:32] locally and there I've noticed that this
[20:35] the churches have a little bit of a
[20:37] different slant or focus and I'm not
[20:39] talking about tapes or preachers only
[20:41] but what I'm talking about is some
[20:43] Churches like to preach
[20:46] against sin sin sin sin sin and you
[20:50] hardly ever hear anything about Grace
[20:52] and then other churches want to preach
[20:54] Grace Grace Grace Grace Grace Grace
[20:56] and really don't bring the hammer
[20:58] against sin
[21:00] and so what what I thought about was the
[21:03] fact now in college I graduated I've got
[21:06] a Bachelor's degree I really don't use
[21:09] most of what I learned in college on a
[21:11] day-to-day basis but there's a couple
[21:12] things that stuck with me one thing that
[21:15] stuck with me was a term called
[21:16] cognitive dissonance it's a
[21:19] psychological term and basically what it
[21:21] means is people don't like to hold
[21:24] opposing views or opposing thoughts in
[21:27] their mind at the same time they like
[21:29] things to be black or white clear-cut
[21:32] yes or no right or wrong and it's hard
[21:35] for people to hold two opposite things
[21:38] at the same time and now it's
[21:41] interesting because God has chosen and
[21:45] ordained for us to have to face
[21:47] cognitive dissonance because he has said
[21:50] I'm going to place my seed of life in
[21:54] you in a fleshly body
[21:57] and you're not going to escape that
[21:59] flesh unless you're raptured or go by
[22:01] way of the grave
[22:03] so you'll always be dealing with the
[22:05] flesh
[22:06] now
[22:08] like I said these churches they like to
[22:11] lean one way or the other many times
[22:12] they'll they'll preach against sin and
[22:15] they won't preach Grace or they'll
[22:16] preach Grace and they'll kind of leave
[22:18] off sin now we want to find a balance by
[22:21] the word because we understand that God
[22:24] hates sin he can't stand sin but yet he
[22:28] loved us so much that he went and paid
[22:31] that price on Calvary and so we are
[22:33] living in Grace but we don't want to
[22:36] make that a disgrace
[22:39] right so
[22:42] the problem of our age is we have so
[22:46] much mixing right Revelations 3 you know
[22:49] Leia the ca he said unto the Church of
[22:51] the laodiceans right these things saith
[22:53] the amen the faithful and true Witness
[22:56] the beginning of creation of God I Know
[22:59] Thy works that thou art neither cold nor
[23:02] hot I would that thou were cold or hot
[23:04] so then because Thou Art lukewarm in
[23:05] neither cold nor hot I will spew thee
[23:08] out of my mouth
[23:09] last time I was here uh and and had the
[23:12] opportunity there to preach if you
[23:13] remember I talked about a recipe for
[23:16] mixing I don't know if you remember but
[23:18] I talked about how uh in Egypt the
[23:20] children of Israel they they liked the
[23:22] garlics and leeks but they also like the
[23:24] the
[23:25] um uh The Grapes of the land and we we
[23:28] talked about how you mix up a big old
[23:30] pie of garlic and leeks and grapes and
[23:33] honey and it would make you sick to your
[23:34] stomach and that's what that's what the
[23:37] Lord is sick to his stomach when we come
[23:40] and we want to just mix a little bit of
[23:42] this we want to mix a little bit of that
[23:43] we want to you know get focused so much
[23:46] on Grace that we we end up just not
[23:48] caring how our lifestyle is and we creep
[23:51] into backsliding and things like that or
[23:54] if we tighten up so tight that we can't
[23:57] have any Grace for anybody we have that
[24:00] judgmental spirit
[24:02] you know one of the things that I love
[24:04] about brother Brandon is you hear the
[24:06] stories of how you know you think well
[24:08] he would never have a friend that's a
[24:10] Catholic well no he had plenty of
[24:12] friends that were a Catholic for any of
[24:14] friends that were Baptist in fact he
[24:16] rubbed elbows with Sinners sounds like
[24:18] somebody else we know that's Jesus right
[24:21] so we don't want to get too far into
[24:25] legalism we don't want to get too far
[24:27] the other direction we want by the word
[24:29] to be straight down the middle of the
[24:32] line
[24:32] Glory now
[24:36] in uh actually let's let's turn for just
[24:39] a second to Second Peter chapter one uh
[24:41] it's such a wonderful chapter there and
[24:43] we won't have time to to look at it all
[24:45] I know being a Wednesday night I don't
[24:48] want to take too much time here but in
[24:50] second Peter chapter one
[24:53] uh he's talking here about how God has
[24:56] equipped us
[24:58] with everything we need for the journey
[25:02] and so we want to read a little bit
[25:04] about that second Peter chapter one and
[25:08] let's go to verse two he says Grace and
[25:12] peace be multiplied unto you through the
[25:14] knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord
[25:16] according as his divine power hath given
[25:19] unto us all things that pertain unto
[25:22] life and godliness anything that's been
[25:25] given to us pertaining to life and
[25:27] godliness comes from God and he has
[25:30] packed us with what we need many times
[25:33] we don't believe it we don't see it we
[25:36] we see our sins we don't see what God
[25:39] has put in us we don't see the potential
[25:41] but he sees it and he says you're my
[25:44] child I've equipped you with everything
[25:46] you have need of just relax and yield to
[25:50] me and let me grow you day by day you
[25:55] know how it is many times if a child has
[25:58] been privileged to grow up in a house
[26:00] that maybe their parents had a little
[26:01] extra money and and they have a little
[26:03] nicer a little bigger house well then
[26:05] that child goes and gets married and
[26:07] then they think many times that they
[26:10] have to get a big fancy house just like
[26:13] their parents and they forget that it
[26:15] took their parents sometimes 20 30 years
[26:18] to get this big house and these nice
[26:21] cars and the kid thinks I got to do this
[26:23] in five years so they set unrealistic
[26:26] goals and we do that for ourselves and
[26:30] we do that for others on the spiritual
[26:32] side you know it it takes somebody you
[26:35] know one one week to clean up certain
[26:38] sins but then other times it can take
[26:42] years to fully grow out of those sins
[26:45] now you know Paul said
[26:48] there's no temptation given but what's
[26:51] common to men and we think a lot of
[26:54] times Well my Temptation my sin is so
[26:56] dark or so special or what so different
[26:58] it's not
[27:00] those Temptations those sins have been
[27:03] common to men and women for years and
[27:05] years and years so we have to struggle
[27:07] against that lie and say no this is a
[27:09] common thing it's wrong and God's
[27:12] provided a way of escape the problem is
[27:15] we look at the rest of that scripture
[27:17] where it says that he'll help us in that
[27:19] time of Temptation and we read it as
[27:22] he's going to help us to over uh to
[27:26] eliminate that it says he's provided a
[27:28] way of Escape but not a way of escape to
[27:31] eliminate your Temptation it actually
[27:33] says that you be able to bear that
[27:36] temptation
[27:37] so if you think about it there are some
[27:40] things that when God gives you the Holy
[27:42] Ghost and gives you a Deliverance
[27:43] they're gone immediately but then there
[27:47] are some things that God in his
[27:49] Sovereign Grace chooses to allow you to
[27:51] bear for some period of time that he
[27:55] knows and he has it to be where it's
[27:57] something that you overcome
[28:00] but now this is a really good thing
[28:02] because God doesn't want his bride to
[28:05] just where he pushes him in one side of
[28:07] the pipe and pulls them out the other
[28:08] but he wants them to be Overcomers
[28:11] and you remember Samson brother Branham
[28:13] said Samson when he slew that lion and
[28:16] he came back later he said that honey
[28:18] was the sweetest thing and he said if
[28:21] you have a Temptation and you have a
[28:24] trial and you have sin and mistakes in
[28:26] your life and you overcome that thing he
[28:29] said it's The Sweetest Victory it's like
[28:32] Samson's honey
[28:34] and so we find God in his Divine wisdom
[28:37] chooses the trials and The Temptations
[28:40] and the sins that you will face and that
[28:43] you will have to overcome and every one
[28:46] of us in here has it the Bible says that
[28:49] we do wrong if we think we are without
[28:51] sin we do have sin now so do we just
[28:55] abound in sin oh it's no big deal no no
[28:58] God's calling us to grow in Grace every
[29:01] day get a little closer to him every day
[29:04] get a little more free from sin every
[29:07] day get a little farther down the road
[29:08] but what's the problem in our day and
[29:12] age nobody likes or is used to denying
[29:17] themselves anything but the word of God
[29:20] calls us to deny our flesh to deny
[29:24] ourself and to choose the word and to
[29:28] choose the washing of the water of the
[29:30] word to our lives but so few people are
[29:33] willing to do do that and it's not a
[29:36] complex formula it is just yielding to
[29:40] the spirit and as second Peter here says
[29:42] he's already packed Us full of
[29:45] everything that we have need of he says
[29:47] there once again in verse 3 according as
[29:50] his divine power hath given unto us all
[29:54] things that pertaineth unto life and
[29:55] godliness through the knowledge of him
[29:58] that hath called us to glory and virtue
[30:01] verse 4 whereby are given unto us
[30:03] exceeding great and precious promises
[30:06] that by these ye might be partakers of
[30:08] the divine nature having escaped the
[30:11] corruption that is in the world through
[30:13] lust how do you escape it you do it by
[30:16] what he's already packed into you being
[30:19] partakers of the divine nature is what
[30:22] he says there in verse 4. amen and
[30:25] besides this giving all diligence now he
[30:28] goes into the stature of the perfect man
[30:30] and for message Believers we're very
[30:32] familiar with this right and it's it's
[30:35] and let me pause and say this
[30:37] I am very thankful that brother Branham
[30:39] came and restored the word and revealed
[30:42] the word and revealed all these
[30:44] Mysteries we have such insight into
[30:47] things but many times we want to talk
[30:49] about the Seven Seals and the Thunders
[30:52] and the this and that and we forget to
[30:54] go back to the basics and the prophet
[30:57] said that God is hiding himself in
[30:59] Simplicity when we forget the great
[31:02] commandment to do unto to love our Lord
[31:04] Our God and to do unto others and then
[31:07] we forget the basic principles of the
[31:09] Statue of a perfect man adding to your
[31:12] faith virtue into your virtue knowledge
[31:14] and your knowledge Temperance when we
[31:16] leave off those Basics we find ourselves
[31:18] more easily sliding into temptation and
[31:21] to sin and to backsliding now I want to
[31:23] call out here if you go back and you
[31:25] listen to that message
[31:27] um uh statue of a perfect man brother
[31:30] Branham is talking about uh the the
[31:33] levels and he's drawing it out on a
[31:35] whiteboard or a chalkboard and he he he
[31:37] then he references Matthew I think it is
[31:39] chapter 7 or chapter five that but the
[31:43] scripture where Jesus says be therefore
[31:46] perfect even as your father in Heaven is
[31:48] perfect you know now that scripture if
[31:51] you look at it a certain way can be very
[31:53] challenging and that is if you think
[31:55] that you have to fulfill that scripture
[31:57] by yourself
[31:59] you're in trouble because none of us can
[32:02] be perfect in this flesh
[32:04] but brother Branham as he's going
[32:06] through these levels of the Statue of a
[32:08] perfect man he says you know add to your
[32:10] faith virtue and so forth and so forth
[32:12] and then when he gets up there to
[32:13] Godliness he pauses and he says now
[32:16] there's your Matthew 7 or Matthew 5
[32:18] whatever he he's that scripture he's
[32:20] referring to and he's saying that when
[32:23] you get to that level of godliness when
[32:24] you've grown faith and virtue and you
[32:28] keep walking you keep growing you keep
[32:30] denying yourself you're climbing up the
[32:32] ladder higher and higher you get to that
[32:34] level of godliness it's not something
[32:36] you're putting on it's something that's
[32:38] growing and pushing out from you but
[32:40] other people see you and they see
[32:43] Matthew 7. they see Perfection they see
[32:47] brother Jack and they think my goodness
[32:50] he has no sin he has no temptation and
[32:53] he doesn't have much sin anymore but yet
[32:56] in the flesh he and I both are only a
[33:00] couple bad decisions from a world of
[33:02] hurt
[33:03] all of us have to stay under the blood
[33:06] covered by the Rock of Ages and yielding
[33:09] to him daily
[33:10] we all have to deny ourselves and take
[33:13] up our cross and follow Jesus
[33:16] so I'm not talking complex stuff here
[33:18] this is simple stuff but it's something
[33:21] that we have to live daily and that's
[33:24] the hard part because the devil's really
[33:27] good at coming up with new stuff new
[33:31] movies new sports new different things
[33:34] and and then you know I'm in my 40s now
[33:37] so I realized that he also has different
[33:40] seasons where the devil brings different
[33:42] things to you you know Sports were a big
[33:45] temptation to me back when I was in my
[33:47] you know teens and 20s I still like to
[33:50] play basketball but it's not a big
[33:52] Temptation it's not a big problem I I
[33:55] used to really struggle you know I I
[33:57] have a little empathy for the sisters
[33:58] because you know my parents I played at
[34:02] a Christian basketball or Christian
[34:04] School basketball team and we wore pants
[34:06] it was a good old Baptist school and we
[34:08] partnered with them and they they were
[34:10] like fundamental Baptists so we all wore
[34:13] pants it was a blessing but then you
[34:15] know there was this guy Joe Ward Jumping
[34:18] Joe Ward from the CBA and he was this
[34:21] great basketball player and he came to
[34:22] town and he had a basketball camp and I
[34:25] worked a paper out saved up the money
[34:26] and and went to this basketball camp and
[34:29] then
[34:30] I was the only guy wearing pants
[34:32] you know so the second day I was like
[34:35] yeah I got some shorts in my backpack
[34:38] guys
[34:42] put on the shorts but of course since I
[34:45] hardly ever wear shorts my legs were as
[34:47] wide as anything
[34:48] that I got embarrassed by that put it
[34:50] back on the path so the Lord knows how
[34:52] to work
[34:56] but you know I I have some empathy for
[34:58] the sisters because you stand out you
[35:02] you it's harder to hide your Christian
[35:05] walk than it is for us guys us guys
[35:08] all we have to do is just remain silent
[35:10] many times and they don't know whether
[35:12] we're a Christian or not
[35:14] so I told uh I told a uh a young brother
[35:17] that was kind of struggling with shorts
[35:19] the other day
[35:20] um actually this was a while back I told
[35:22] him I was like I don't recommend as a
[35:24] Christian young man you necessarily go
[35:26] down to the beach and so forth but I
[35:27] said if you're ever down at the beach
[35:29] I said go in with your pants and go
[35:32] swimming in the water and then come out
[35:34] and see how many people are staring at
[35:36] you and Snicker it and you'll get a
[35:37] you'll get a little bit of a Feeling
[35:39] Just a Little Bit of what our sisters go
[35:41] through
[35:42] and of course he didn't he wasn't Keen
[35:44] to go do that because guys aren't used
[35:46] to facing that criticism but I think
[35:48] it's good and healthy for a guy to
[35:50] realize what our sisters face and I
[35:53] appreciate what you all stand for and
[35:55] what you do and so I think sometimes for
[35:58] us Brothers It's actually harder to deny
[36:02] ourselves and to to walk forward in this
[36:04] Godly walk because it's easy for us to
[36:06] just kind of go under the radar and just
[36:09] kind of swim along with what we're doing
[36:10] and and not make any waves a lot of
[36:13] times we don't have to make as big of a
[36:15] stand but the Lord has a way of
[36:17] eventually bringing stuff out to make
[36:19] you make a stand you eventually have to
[36:22] get off the fence and make a stand so
[36:25] this this what Jesus says there about be
[36:28] therefore perfect is uh
[36:30] you know like I said it was challenging
[36:32] for me for a while till I really
[36:34] realized that it's not based on my
[36:36] performance it's based on what he did in
[36:40] his performance that day on Calvary
[36:43] so you know I thought about
[36:47] um getting one of those born-again
[36:48] Savage uh bumper stickers and if anybody
[36:51] knows brother Nathan he's pretty
[36:53] particular about his cars I was going to
[36:56] preach this at the church there and uh
[36:58] and tell him I put a bumper sticker on
[37:00] his car but you know just like tape it
[37:02] on not not fully put it on but I have I
[37:05] haven't done that yet but uh it's a
[37:08] reminder because
[37:09] you know we don't want to be a Savage
[37:12] and we want to be born again but the
[37:14] reality like I said with cognitive
[37:16] dissonance is God has elected that we
[37:18] are both
[37:19] in our heart in our spirit our brother
[37:22] Brandon would talk about the soul and
[37:23] who we truly are we are a son and a
[37:26] daughter of God
[37:28] and when the flesh gets in the way and
[37:30] we make a little mistake it's so easy
[37:32] for the devil to come and discourage us
[37:34] and start to work on us and say you know
[37:37] you're you're not a real Christian
[37:38] you're not filled with the Holy Ghost
[37:39] look at what you did look at what you
[37:41] did
[37:42] now there's a big difference between
[37:44] falling into sin and swimming in sin
[37:48] and many times people say oh I just made
[37:51] a little mistake but they're they're
[37:52] living a full lifestyle of sin
[37:55] and so we do need to check our hearts
[37:58] and check our lifestyles and check our
[37:59] lives and if we find that it's not just
[38:01] an occasional mistake then then we need
[38:04] to get back to the altar but when we
[38:06] know when we're following the Lord when
[38:08] we're denying ourselves when we make
[38:09] those mistakes our heart or the Holy
[38:13] Spirit checks us and it's our it's our
[38:15] pleasure to go back to the Lord in
[38:17] Repentance we we long to do that for we
[38:20] know that it brings us back into
[38:21] fellowship with God and it clears clears
[38:24] the deck so to speak so you know there's
[38:27] a whole lot of other things there in
[38:28] second Peter chapter one I I didn't even
[38:31] pay attention to when I started and how
[38:33] long I was going on but I want to talk a
[38:36] little bit more about this this uh this
[38:38] lady
[38:40] so
[38:42] you know how they say truth is Stranger
[38:44] Than Fiction
[38:46] so if if I was going to talk about the
[38:48] Flesh and the spirit and I was going to
[38:50] ask you what what's a story that brother
[38:52] Branham tells on the Flesh and the
[38:55] spirit what's like one of the famous
[38:58] stories that he tells probably everybody
[39:00] in here would recall and remember he
[39:02] talks about the two dogs right the black
[39:05] dog and the white dog and the Indian
[39:06] chief so I want to read that real quick
[39:09] just a little clip of that because it's
[39:12] pretty telling the way he describes this
[39:14] so from a message called God's provided
[39:16] way of healing brother bam says this
[39:19] he said you see there's two men living
[39:21] in you did you know that one time we had
[39:23] an Indian converted in the meeting and
[39:25] asked him how he was getting along now
[39:27] listen to what he says on this he said
[39:29] after he'd received the Holy Ghost now
[39:32] many times we think about that we think
[39:34] oh well I struggle before I receive the
[39:37] Holy Ghost but this is after he received
[39:40] the Holy Ghost this Indian chief then
[39:42] talks to brother random so he says um
[39:45] uh let's see where am I after he
[39:48] received the Holy Ghost said well he
[39:49] said there's been two dogs in me said
[39:51] one of them is an evil dog and one of
[39:53] them is a good dog and said they just
[39:55] fuss and fight all the time and he said
[39:58] why Chief said which one overcomes he
[40:02] Chief said well it depends on the one
[40:04] which the chief feeds the most well
[40:06] that's not giving any comparison to the
[40:08] devil and the Holy Spirit comparing it
[40:10] as dogs but look there is a good in you
[40:12] and there's evil in you and there's
[40:15] belief and unbelief and it depends on
[40:17] which one you feed the most that's all
[40:20] which one you feed the most it would
[40:23] behoove us friends to go back to the
[40:25] basics in our daily walk and think about
[40:28] how much time am I spending truly in the
[40:33] word and in prayer let me tell you we've
[40:36] started and I don't know maybe I need to
[40:38] get some advice from Brother Jack on
[40:40] this but we we just started reading the
[40:41] Bible in a year
[40:43] and uh of course you get into the the
[40:46] Book of Genesis there and my youngest
[40:48] daughter is six and I've got a seven
[40:51] year old and I'm getting questions that
[40:52] I don't necessarily want to talk to
[40:53] these young girls about so maybe your
[40:55] brother Jack can advise me on the best
[40:57] age to start the Bible in a year program
[40:59] for kids maybe I need to keep that to my
[41:02] wife and I and the older two but I'll
[41:05] say this it's been amazing to see how
[41:07] the kids have responded so quickly to
[41:11] having now we had devotions before but
[41:13] you're reading the Bible in a year you
[41:15] got to do two chapters in the morning
[41:16] and one chapter in the afternoon so you
[41:19] got to read a lot more and so they've
[41:22] been reading a lot more and they're
[41:23] responding well but what I was going to
[41:25] say on that on the topic of feeding is
[41:28] it's pretty hard to truly fall into
[41:32] temptation when you're reading multiple
[41:35] chapters of the word of God every day
[41:37] and you're praying not just
[41:41] bless my food oh Lord but when you're
[41:44] truly breaking through into prayer
[41:47] it makes Temptation so much weaker that
[41:51] it just it's like a covering that that
[41:53] that the Temptation and the sin just
[41:56] bounces off it just falls off and so we
[41:59] find this to be very very true both for
[42:01] because brother Branham said it because
[42:03] the word of God says it but also from
[42:05] experience I think all of us have
[42:07] experienced that that when we turn our
[42:09] Eyes Upon Jesus when we feed and do the
[42:12] right things that Temptation goes away
[42:14] but now
[42:17] this this lady that has this born-again
[42:20] Savage sticker
[42:22] this is the part I said that truth is
[42:24] Stranger Than Fiction
[42:25] so she's Indian and as you know Indians
[42:28] and Native American Indians have
[42:29] interesting names like Sitting Bull or
[42:32] different things and and so this lady
[42:36] her name is Kelly Two wolves
[42:40] tools like the two dogs you know and uh
[42:44] I didn't feel led to really I could tell
[42:47] in her spirit she was kind of just angry
[42:49] at be at Christians and just in general
[42:52] so I didn't feel it was the time to
[42:54] witness to her but I thought my goodness
[42:56] lady you're so close to the truth having
[42:59] a name like two wolves talking about
[43:01] being a born-again Savage wanting to be
[43:03] born again but just not wanting to
[43:05] necessarily be a Christian you're so
[43:08] close to the truth
[43:10] but yet you're being held back and so I
[43:12] I've I've not prayed for her a lot but
[43:14] occasionally she'll come on my heart and
[43:16] I'll pray for her and if I get when I
[43:17] get back to Custer South Dakota I'm
[43:19] going to try and go buy a bumper sticker
[43:21] for brother Nathan and talk to Kelly Two
[43:23] wolves
[43:24] so Paul would say this in Galatians 5.
[43:29] this I say then walk in the spirit and
[43:31] ye shall not fulfill the lust of the
[43:33] flesh
[43:35] you know
[43:36] last time I was here I think I also
[43:38] talked about Gideon I just love that
[43:40] story of Gideon and if you remember in
[43:42] that story of Gideon we we focus on the
[43:45] pictures that were broken and the
[43:46] Torches and all that stuff
[43:48] but after God told Gideon you're a
[43:51] mighty man of courage and Valor
[43:53] he
[43:55] spirit of God Came Upon Gideon but God
[43:57] also gave him something to do he had to
[43:59] go cut down the Grove and clean up his
[44:02] house and all these different things
[44:04] and and he was kind of ashamed remember
[44:06] he tried to saw down these trees at
[44:08] night which I never understood because
[44:10] how do you saw down a tree and keep it
[44:12] quiet but he he tried to you know kind
[44:15] of like the brothers running under the
[44:17] radar you know he just tried to clean up
[44:19] quietly but it got to be known right and
[44:22] he had to take a stand and as I said God
[44:24] makes us take a stand
[44:26] and he did he does this and it was after
[44:29] that he was still a little bit like
[44:31] hesitant like I don't know am I is this
[44:34] right God are you really with me and we
[44:36] know he puts out the fleeces before the
[44:38] Lord and all this stuff but remember
[44:40] when we talked about this before we said
[44:42] what really triggered him over to speak
[44:45] the same words as the Lord and go forth
[44:48] and actually have this battle was when
[44:50] God allowed him to go down with his
[44:52] servant to the camp of the enemy and
[44:55] hear what the enemy was saying about him
[44:57] yes and I would say to you tonight is
[45:02] that we hear the devil whispering in our
[45:04] ear when we make a mistake you're not a
[45:06] child of God you're a sinner you're a
[45:08] failure you're no good or if we're doing
[45:11] really good he takes the other side and
[45:13] says
[45:15] um
[45:16] I don't know I don't know about that
[45:17] brother Troy back there he doesn't do it
[45:20] like I do it and I'm pretty sure he's
[45:22] doing it wrong and he's got some funny
[45:24] ideas about this that or other Doctrine
[45:26] we get that Temptation and you know I'm
[45:29] just kidding about brother Troy just
[45:30] using him as an example but that happens
[45:32] and it could even happen to somebody in
[45:34] the church towards brother Troy
[45:36] because brother Troy is not perfect news
[45:39] flash she's not perfect
[45:41] but he's a great guy and he's a Son of
[45:44] God and he's my brother and the reality
[45:47] is
[45:47] once and if you're guilty of the least
[45:50] you're guilty of it all it's not that
[45:52] brother Troy's sins are worse than mine
[45:54] or mine are worse than brother Troy's
[45:55] and brother Jack's above us all it's not
[45:57] that
[45:58] it's that brother Jack has dedicated his
[46:01] life to the gospel and he's growing in
[46:04] Grace he's yielding he's dying daily
[46:06] he's leading by example
[46:09] and all of us are walking up that road
[46:13] but the devil's job is to discourage us
[46:16] and get us off the road either by
[46:18] thinking we're something when we're not
[46:19] or thinking we're nothing when we are
[46:22] something
[46:24] that is the call tonight is to just Live
[46:27] Your Life in Grace denying yourself and
[46:30] don't get pulled to one side or the
[46:32] other thinking you're something when
[46:33] you're not or thinking you're nothing
[46:35] when you know you are something by the
[46:38] grace of God because second Peter
[46:40] remember it says he's packed everything
[46:42] into you that you need for the journey
[46:44] and he loved you and me he knew before
[46:48] the foundation of the Earth every
[46:49] mistake I would make but yet he still
[46:52] died for me what a savior
[46:56] and it's not to belittle the Seven Seals
[46:59] or the seven Thunders or those things
[47:00] those are in the word and they're
[47:02] wonderful
[47:03] but the the greatest thing to me is this
[47:06] God in Simplicity and the fact that I
[47:09] can live a Christian Life and I can make
[47:12] mistakes
[47:13] and I can I can recognize by the grace
[47:16] of God the cognitive dissonance that I
[47:18] am both flesh
[47:20] and the spirit of God and it's okay to
[47:25] be in the flesh not living in sin not
[47:29] backsliding but it's okay to be in the
[47:33] flesh and in the spirit and let the
[47:35] spirit grow and take over and control
[47:37] the flesh
[47:39] it is possible some people will tell you
[47:41] I can it's not possible to overcome this
[47:44] that or the other uh there was a
[47:46] gentleman that many years ago his wife
[47:49] left him ran off with another man
[47:52] and when I got to know him he was a much
[47:54] older man he was in our church and he
[47:56] had never remarried like many do they
[47:58] run out and find a divorced woman and
[48:01] live in adultery and all these things
[48:02] but he never did that
[48:04] and I asked him I said how did you do
[48:06] that because so many men when they're
[48:08] divorced
[48:10] say I can't live without the attention
[48:12] of a woman I can't do this I can't do
[48:14] that how did you do it and he said you
[48:18] know what there was a time when Satan
[48:20] sent a woman after me and she was
[48:21] flirting with me and at first it caught
[48:23] my attention
[48:24] he said and as I started to speak to her
[48:27] and flirt with her the spirit of the
[48:28] Lord came to me not audibly
[48:31] but reminded me that I had a choice did
[48:34] I want to be a Christian like a true
[48:37] real Christian in the power of God or
[48:40] did I want to just live with a woman
[48:42] and he said I realized
[48:45] that no matter how nice it would be for
[48:48] the attention of this lady the thing
[48:50] that makes me the most happy and that I
[48:51] want more than anything is to be a son
[48:54] of God
[48:55] and from that moment he never spoke to
[48:58] that woman again and he never had a
[49:00] girlfriend and he lived a holy Godly
[49:03] life until he passed away
[49:05] and I thought what an example
[49:08] you know it reminded me what brother bam
[49:09] said about that pearl of great price
[49:12] do we are we convinced
[49:15] that he is enough and that he's the best
[49:17] for us
[49:18] I think we are but I think Satan
[49:21] discourages us when we make a mistake
[49:23] and it's easy to hear him say you're
[49:25] nothing you're just a sinner you're not
[49:28] good enough
[49:29] but go back and read second Peter 1 and
[49:31] be encouraged that the reality is when
[49:34] we go down to the enemy's camp
[49:36] and we're up at when we've grown and
[49:38] we've grown and we've grown and we've
[49:39] gotten to that level of godliness they
[49:41] look at us and they just don't know what
[49:43] to do that's a perfect man no he's not
[49:46] perfect but I can see why they would
[49:49] think he's a perfect man
[49:51] because God is demonstrated visibly
[49:54] through a sister or a brother
[49:58] that's yielded their life to him
[50:00] brother Jack I don't know how long I've
[50:03] gone I don't know what you want
[50:06] um but uh
[50:08] you know I I hesitate to sing because
[50:11] this is a singing Church
[50:14] and I don't know Sister Rebecca is not
[50:16] on the piano and all that stuff
[50:18] but um
[50:20] actually I might get in trouble for
[50:23] putting her on the spot but if sister
[50:24] Jennifer wants to come up here in just a
[50:27] second we'll pray and if she'll come up
[50:28] and help me sing a little song we just
[50:30] want to sing a little song for you
[50:32] um I don't know if The Pianist could
[50:34] come
[50:36] oh we don't okay well maybe we can sing
[50:39] it acapella I don't know if you know
[50:40] that song the goodness of God
[50:42] I will try and sing that um I'll
[50:44] definitely need Jennifer to help me with
[50:46] that one since uh
[50:47] since uh we don't have the piano but
[50:50] I just want to say I really appreciate
[50:52] you all
[50:53] um I'm sorry that I was a little bit
[50:55] late the Lord's been trying my patience
[50:57] there with uh the airport you know
[50:59] messing up and then accidents on the
[51:01] road and it's uh but it's it's a real
[51:03] pleasure to be with you tonight so
[51:05] let's go ahead and pray Heavenly Father
[51:07] Lord we just love you so much
[51:10] and and I know many times in my life
[51:15] I felt like I've had to be perfect on my
[51:18] own
[51:19] and I'm so glad that you sent a prophet
[51:21] to remind us
[51:22] that it's not based on our performance
[51:24] it's based upon what you did that day on
[51:27] Calvary
[51:28] and then Paul would come along in second
[51:30] Peter and remind us that you've packed
[51:33] all that we need for the journey into us
[51:36] we just have to yield and we have to
[51:38] trust and we know that without faith
[51:40] it's impossible to please you so Lord as
[51:44] much as we can we believe and we lift up
[51:48] our hearts to you and as I think it was
[51:52] the disciples said Lord help our
[51:54] unbelief anything that we have that's
[51:56] not like you Lord we know we're still in
[51:59] this flesh we know we're not perfect but
[52:02] Lord we all have a desire to be clean
[52:05] and to be holy and to be the right type
[52:09] of Bride
[52:10] so help us Lord and help us then to take
[52:14] what Christian development you've given
[52:17] us and not to Lord it over people with
[52:19] the wrong attitude but to use it in a
[52:22] Ministry Lord to be a light to this lost
[52:25] and Dying World be with us Lord I pray
[52:27] Lord that you be with the spirit truth
[52:30] Tabernacle Lord that you'd strengthen
[52:33] them and Lord I'm just still believing
[52:35] as I was talking to brother Jack the
[52:37] other day believe in Lord for that
[52:38] building that right building at the
[52:41] right time we know it's on its way we
[52:43] claim it by faith and we thank you for
[52:45] it
[52:46] pray this in Jesus name

[59:08] this year
[59:11] so here the holy spirit is kind of
[59:14] working the same topic from coast to

[1:00:14] um just a name like that her parents
[1:00:16] have no idea that they gave her a name
[1:00:17] that would give her a particular
[1:00:19] character
[1:00:21] and and from that character a bumper
[1:00:23] sticker sticker would be developed and
[1:00:25] she'd become a part of a sermon here in
