Father God, we thank you so much for your grace in our lives. Father, we're all alive and well, standing here this morning clothed in our right mind. Lord God, you have made provisions for us to make it into the house of the Lord that we may gather together in your holy name. And Father, you said wherever two or three are gathered in my name, I will be in the midst. So, we're grateful for your presence, Lord Jesus. We're grateful for the saints, Lord Jesus. You have blessed them and kept them throughout the week, Lord Jesus. And Lord, you're just so good to us. And father, many of us, Lord, our brothers and sisters have traveled to South Carolina to be with brother Steven and Sister Rachel, Lord God. And we pray, almighty God, you have blessed their union. Father, we pray, Lord, that you'll continue to bless the pregnancy. And may, Lord, both the mother and the baby be well at the time of delivery, Lord. And may you keep them safe, Lord Jesus. Father, we pray for our ministering brothers, Lord Jesus. We want to keep them ever before you, Lord. Father, how they labor to bring your truth to your people. They labor to hear from heaven, Lord God, to get a message, Lord, to feed the sheep of God, Lord, that we all may come to perfection, Lord. We all want a closer walk with you, Lord. And we know faith cometh by hearing, hearing by the word. So as the word is ministered to us, Lord, Father, we draw closer to you, Lord. We want more of you. We need you, Lord. We we want, Lord God, a overflow of your presence in our lives, Lord. We need a refilling of the Holy Ghost this morning, Lord Jesus.

Bless our brother as he prepares to bring the message this morning. Anoint him aresh Lord. Use him, strengthen him, Lord God to deliver his heart, Lord. What you have placed inside, Lord. May it come forth to our ears and go down to our hearts, Lord, that we all may be one in you. We love you, Father. We commit ourselves, the remainder of the service, into your hands. It's in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. [Music] Praise. I'd like you to sing this song with me. Uh, praise him. By human hands, you are not a god dependent anymore. You are not a God in need of anything we can give by your plan and that's just the way it is. Come on, let's sing it again. Hallelujah. You are not a God created by human hands. You are not a God dependent any mortal man. You are not a God in need of anything we can give by your gra. And that's just the way it is. You are God alone from before time began.

Certainly uh good to be in the house of God uh on this morning. Amen. Just keep playing softly. Yeah. Just keep playing softly. Amen. Y'all can join in just softly here. Amen. He's worthy to be praised. He's worthy to be praised. We worship him in the good times. We worship him in the bad times. David said, "I will bless the Lord at all times. His phrases shall continually be in my mouth. Glory to God. You know, it takes something to be able to write something like that in scripture, you know. And when you look back on the life of David and many of the things that he faced, um I mean completely forgotten about by his own daddy when the prophet came to the house and say who uh the Lord told me to come and anoint one of your sons to be the king and and and that oil didn't come out on nobody. And the prophet had to ask, "Is there at least just one more boy that you got?" And um there, you know, the father said, "Yeah, I got one more." But if the oil ain't came out on none of these, it ain't coming out on him. I know that much. And David showed up and my God did that oil pour uh all over him. But even after an experience like that, he still found himself running through caves and sleeping in caves and and running from Saul and just all kind of things. he was going through. But rather than complain about all the stuff that he was facing, David said, "His praise shall continually be in my mouth." Amen. My soul shall make her boast in the Lord. The humble shall hear thereof and be glad. Then David said one other thing there. It says, "Oh, magnify the Lord with me and let us exalt his name together. Blessed be the name of the Lord." Amen. Amen. Turn around and tell your neighbor, say, "Neighbor, you going to praise him with me?" Neighbor, you going to praise him with me? Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. We thank God. We thank God. I um um as brother Solomon was saying, we had a number of saints go up uh to South Carolina. Brother Steven and Sister Rachel uh had their um uh the baby shower and then as well as the gender reveal they did on yesterday and uh a number of the saints went up. So, we thank God for that. pray that they'll have traveling mercies coming back. Um, and that is probably where I would have been this morning uh on my way back home. But um, the Lord did something a little different uh for us. My uncle was uh called home uh to be with the Lord, Reverend William Henry Burs, and they had his uh service on yesterday. And for my uncle actually uh yesterday would have been his birthday. Uh I think he would have turned 86 I believe was either 85 or 86. But uh but uh they buried him on his on his birthday there and and I wanted to just uh thank the church. I know my wife put something out for the sisters and and u many of you all just stepped up. Those that even weren't going to be able to be there, they still gave money towards it and it it was it went a long way. So, we want to just thank you all for your assistance and and helping us as we buried him uh on on yesterday. Uh and last week, uh we had a little rehearsal because usually we get a family together and we'll try to do a song or a couple songs and and um Brother Jerry just wanted to thank God for him. He came to open up the church and and just run the sound for me while we were just trying to get things all situated uh uh with with with with them. He was listening to my family sing and he's like, "Brother Jack, I didn't know." I said, "Yeah, they they they can they can do a little bit, but just want to get them all serving the Lord." Uh if we got them serving the Lord, we might be some damage to the devil's kingdom. But uh but we just thank God, amen, for all things and and and and uh appreciate all the help and all the assistance, amen, over uh this past couple weeks. Amen. Uh, I had a something that I just uh read here and I wanted to read it uh real quick. Uh, I want to go to Nehemiah uh 9. Um, and I just want to read a quick scripture uh verse 19. I'm not going to preach today. I, you know, I was scheduled to be away. So, Brother Jerry was scheduled to preach and um uh so even though I'm here, he's still going to preach. But, uh I last night I was I was after yesterday, I don't know what happened, but last night I I just really start going through a little bit there in my body. And um for some reason, my um I've been dealing with a little issue with my ankle for the last couple months. And last night, I was just having some problems, some real problems. and um couldn't get comfortable to sleep. I mean, it was just it was something else. Thank God for my wife just helping with everything uh she could to try to try to keep me going. And uh but this morning, I happened to read something in the Bible that um when I read it, I I I I took claim for my my body. Amen. and I took claim here in Nehemiah uh chapter 9 uh verse 19 [Music] um actually um verse 18 yay when they had made them a molten calf and said this is thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt and had wrought great provocations yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookst them not in the wilderness uh the pillar of cloud departed not from them by day to lead them in the way neither the pillar of fire by night to show them light in the way wherein they should go. Thou gavest um thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them and withheldest not thy mana from their mouth and gavest them water for their thirst. Yay. 40 years did did thou sustain them in the wilderness so that they lacked nothing. This is the God we serve. You're not supposed to lack anything. So that they lack nothing. And look at this. Their clothes wax not old and their feet swell not. And that's 40 years now. So when I saw that, I said, "I ain't accepting this. I I'm not accepting this." I mean, they went 40 years, over two million people, and never even had a aching foot. Brother, I say the devil is a liar. And and and I know my God is the same yesterday, today, and forever. So, uh, whatever this swelling is, it's got to go down. Hey, it's got to go. It's got to go. I mean, it God is concerned about your foot. Everything God is concerned about, right? So, man, I ran into that. I said, "I ain't accepting this at all. I'm I if they didn't have no swelling feet, I ain't going to have no swelling feet either." So, praise his holy name. Thank God for my healing. Amen. And I was encouraged by the word of the Lord. Amen. Amen. Amen. God is good. God is good. Well, let us Amen. Um prepare to welcome Brother Jerry. Amen. To the uh pull pit on this morning. I know that uh God has a word for us. Amen. God will bless us. We thank God for all our brothers who help out here in ministry. Um, few weeks ago we had brother Mark on a Wednesday night. Then we had brother Quinton having a little series there on a Wednesday night. Now we got brother Jerry and Amen. You heard brother Quaker. You'll be hearing from Brother Smiley soon. So uh we try to get them all in where we can. Uh but we appreciate the help that God has given to us here at Spirit and Truth Tabernacle. Amen. Let's go back to Amazing Grace. Amen. And let's stand to our feet and uh welcome Amen. Brother Jerry as he comes. in grace. Oh, how sweet the sound that saved a rich like me. Oh, I once was lost. Oh, but now [Music] Praise the Lord. God bless you all this morning. You know, that's a hymn that you can never get tired of singing because it was amazing grace that saved a wretch like me. And we just want to thank God that we can all be recipients of his love this morning. Praise the Lord. Let us bow in a word of prayer before we get into the word. [Music] Oh heavenly father Jesus, we thank you God for your grace and your mercy. Oh father god as it was said earlier Lord David said oh magnify the Lord with me and let us exalt his name together. Father God your name deserves to be exalted Lord because it is by your name we are here. Father, you have found a people, Lord, that was not worthy, but God, you gave them your name, Lord. That God, by your name, Father, we can go forth and conquer. And Lord, we thank you this morning that you have set us into a place that you said wherever two or three are gathered, you would be there. So, Father God, I pray that you would be pleased, Lord, with what we are have we have done so far, Lord. And that you would have the preeminence in this part of the service, Lord, that your word would speak forth life into every every vessel, Lord. That Father, you would prepare a a people, a bride for the rapture. Oh Lord, help us, Father, to see you in everything that you're doing even right now. We thank you. We ask your blessings on all things. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Praise the Lord. Thank you, musicians. Uh this morning we will turn our Bibles to a few scripture reading. Uh we'll start with the book of Hebrews. Hebrews chapter 11 and the third verse. As brother Jack was saying, uh you know, we are certainly very blessed in this season. Uh very very happy that we've gotten a chance to hear all the brothers. uh you know just it's it's something you know when you have to come behind the word behind the pulpit but to hear the brothers it's been a real blessing and I believe the uh book of Joel said we will eat in plenty. &gt;&gt; So we have been eating in plenty &gt;&gt; I hope you guys have as well. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hebrews 11:3 it says, "Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear." Amen. And we will turn in Genesis chapter 2 verse 4. Amen. And it reads, "These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created. And the day that they that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens, and every plant of the field before it was on the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew. For the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground. But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground. And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul. And just one more place here, Genesis 127. Praise the Lord. back a few pages and it reads, "So God created man in his own image, and the image of God created he him, male and female created he them. And God blessed them. And God said unto them, "Be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth." You may have your seats. May the Lord add a blessing to his reading. Praise God. So this morning, if we could use as a title and subject, we want to just speak on the highest form of creation. &gt;&gt; The highest form of creation. And as a subject, we want to use speaking terms with God. &gt;&gt; Speaking terms with God. And I just trust that this morning we have all come to this place and we are all in speaking terms with God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Uh so we we read there in Hebrews chap 11 uh it says through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God. And I just want you to know this morning that a lot was involved in creating this world. The word that we see today, a lot got into place to it. God was very thoughtful about his creation. Praise God. Amen. And and we we see the principles of mechanics. We see uh dynamics in almost every law of nature. Praise God. But you see in the creation, God had a purpose that he would have his mechanics and dynamics in his church. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The prophet says something here. He says we have so much of the mechanics &gt;&gt; and not the dynamics. &gt;&gt; Now my body is the mechanics but my body will not operate without the dynamics. The spirit and the spirit operates my body. It brings it into control. &gt;&gt; And you see the reason why the mechanic the dynam dynamics are so important is because we need something to bring our body into subjection of the word of God. Praise the Lord. And the spirit of God is the only thing that can do that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And you see back in the back in Genesis, we read just the generations of the heavens and earth. And I like this because in verse 7, it says, "And the Lord God formed man out of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul." One translation says that uh God breathed into his nostrils the spirit of life and man became a speaking spirit. Praise God. &gt;&gt; So you see you have an original purpose. God made you from a certain material. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that material is for you to operate. For you to bring your situation, your conditions, your atmosphere into subjection. Amen. And it says, "Man became a speaking spirit." &gt;&gt; The prophet says here in the message, God testifying of his gifts. He says that now when he met the woman at the well, he went right straight and told her what was wrong with her, where her trouble was. If she had a tumor, he'd say, "Bring me a drink." She'd say, "It's not customary for the Jews to ask a Samaritan." See, he's just talking to her. Man, you see you're a human. I'm a human. And we have two human spirits. Now, when this anointing comes on me, that's the angel of the gift of God, which is a messenger where angel sent from God. Now, it's a part of God, an attribute of God. And then their spirit now then we break from the natural into the supernatural. And then in between here, your spirit is speaking to me. I'm speaking back to you through mortal lips. both anointing uh two anointing. Now if this spirit here that's on me to is to bless you. Not that I can bless you. It can bless you. Now if then your spirit is willing but you have a spirit of unbelief then it cannot bless you. It'll just tell you. It might tell you what's wrong or something spend uh send you on but you'll have to believe. And these two spirits can get together. See it's a battle. Praise God. So you see you are a speaking spirit. Man was born to speak. &gt;&gt; Praise God. The inability for a man to uh a man to the inability for a man to speak is an abnormal thing. Amen. God never made a man for him not to operate in his authority. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I want to say your authority lies in what you speak. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because what you believe flows through your mouth. Amen. &gt;&gt; So what you speak can control your situation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we want to just turn here Genesis chapter 2 verse 15. And we see that when man when God made this man, the first Adam, he he he made him a a perfect man, he gave him his his his territory and he told him what he would do. You you see, but he was made of a certain nature, a certain material. Amen. And here we find in Genesis 2:15 it says, "And the Lord God took the man and he put him in the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it." Praise God. So man was given this sacred responsibility to make sure as the head of his territory that he would dress it and keep it. Amen. And the Lord God commanded him, saying, "Of every tree of the garden, thou mayest freely eat, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it. For in the day that thou eatest of it, thou shalt surely die. And when God speaks, the word must his word must come to pass. Amen. And you we know we know exactly what happened here that uh through the fall uh Adam had to make a choice. He had to walk out on his wife because of the unbelief that she got compromised in. Praise God. But you see, we can learn something from Adam because through through the through the whole scripture, we see that he was a type of Christ, the second Adam. Amen. And because of his decision, he allowed himself, he allowed God's attribute to become something tangible to us. Amen. And that's been God's purpose. God is always finding ways on how he can make himself tangible. God wants to be touched. God wants to be felt. God wants to be heard. God wants to be seen. Amen. And the only way God can be tangible is when he is dwelling in a body. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The prophet says in the message, why are we not a denomination? He says, "So God comes down and he brings down oh, a bunch of angels, Gabriel, his creation of heavens." So they come down and they tiptoe real easy into the bedroom. See, look around. Gabriel said, "Come here, father. Come here. Look here. Here he is. He lay here lays your children laying here. How many in there ever went to the bedside? Some of you mothers, you dad together, you looked at the little boy, the little girl, and you just reminded one another, don't he look like you this way and that way? Did he ever do that? Why? Many time I go and say to Ma, say about Joseph, she'll say, Bill, he's got a high forehead like you. Yeah, but me, he's got big eyes like you. Why? He's part of our product our he's a product of our union now. And father god uh can say this about uh he said you know Gabriel said you know he looks just like you. That's how God looks. Look at yourself. That's how God looks. He looks like you. You're his offspring. How many knows that? And I just think that's such a beautiful thing because when God looks at you, he wants to see himself. Amen. God looks like you and you look like God. Praise the Lord. There is no difference. But you see, sometimes we need to be reminded uh of where we come from and who we are. Praise the Lord. There's a quote I w I read sometime this week. It says, "The greatest casualty is being forgotten." And you see, sometimes we can forget who we are. And that's why we need the word as a mirror in our lives on a daily basis to remind us the God that's living on the inside. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; And you know through history and time um when we look at the the different animal lives, the dog still uh remembers who the dog is. Amen. A dog still brings forth another dog. A dog still barks. A a lion still wars. A eagle still soarses. Right? We can look at the nature and we see that the only thing that's out of place is man. Amen. Man has fallen from his original position. Praise God. And I want you to know that God has positioned something in you that's eternal. Something that seed something that will bring forth fruit. Praise God. And I want you to know that don't allow the devil to reposition what God has placed in you. Praise God. Because God has given you something for every situation, for every battle, for every need. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And it's God's desire that you be partaker of his divine nature. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I just love that how Peter says that we are partaker of his divine nature. Uh it's partaker means to join in to have an action or an activity with God. Praise God. Another says to take part or experience something along with God. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So God wants you to be an active participant in your daily relationship with him. Praise God. He wants to uh be a partnership with you and give you 100% of the benefits. That's the God that you serve this morning. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We want to turn to Mark chapter 7 here. And here we see uh a very sad situation. Uh it's a man that was born uh in a particular in a certain condition. Uh but here reason it's sad is because we see this man that um that that has the inability to speak. Amen. And he he he's not uh Jesus uh the Bible says he's departing from one place and he's entering into the coasts and of the capitalists and this man he he he couldn't even um help himself. Amen. Um he had to uh the Bible says they had to bring him &gt;&gt; right because he couldn't even help himself. &gt;&gt; And uh we'll pick this up here in verse 32. It says, "And they bring unto him one that was deaf and had an impediment in his speech, and they beseech him to put his hand upon him, and he took him aside from the multitude and put his fingers in his ear, and he spit and he touched his tongue." And I just want to say this, when you have a dysfunctional head, right, I it makes that even the body cannot help itself. Praise God. So which means that when you are in a position where you are of the head, you want to make sure that your eyes are seeing the right things, that your ears are listening to the right things, your mouth are speaking the right things. Amen. This man couldn't help himself. Praise God. So it goes on to say that Jesus he took him to the side from the multitude and he put his fingers in his ears and he spit and touched his tongue and looking up to heaven. He sighed and he saith unto them e fatha that is be open and straightway his ears were opened and the string of his tongue was loose and he spake plain. And I just love when the scripture can be planned because we are in this in this scene, we see that Jesus just spoke one word. Amen. And and he as he spoke this one word, I want you to know what was closed was opened. What was bound was loose. &gt;&gt; And I just want you to know this morning, I don't know what situation that you have closed or what situation you have in bondage, but speak one word and it shall be open. Speak one word and it shall be loose. Praise God. &gt;&gt; You know, one of the greatest doors or things that can be opened is the door to our souls. &gt;&gt; And the greatest door that can be opened is the destination of that soul. Praise God. The Bible says in Revelation chapter 4, he says uh after John says, "After this, I looked and behold a door was opened in heaven. And the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking to me was saith, come up hither, and I will show thee things which must be hereafter." And church, I just believe that God is preparing and conditioning a bride, right, to recognize that voice to come up. Praise God. I believe that's that's that's happening even right now. Amen. It has already begun in you. Praise God. And I you young people, I want to say, don't miss out on the voice that leads you to the open door. &gt;&gt; Praise God. There's many voices in the land today, but only one voice will lead you to the open door. Praise God. Don't allow your desire to experience different things keep you from that open door. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And if I might add, not every experience need an experiment. Praise God. There are certain things that you can stay away from. There are certain things that you can keep yourself from. Praise God. There are certain things you can reserve yourself from. Praise God. You can learn from other people's experience, but do you don't have to experiment on it yourself. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is one experience that needs your everything. That is your experience with the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Praise God. That will lead you to the open door. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says in the message, "Sir, we would see Jesus." Now, there's some things in the Bible that God wants us to challenge. God is an all powerful God, and he gives his servants a commission to do great things. Amen. What God has promised is no uh uh uh uh value if it isn't purposed to do great things. Amen. God's word will accomplish what it's been purposed to do. &gt;&gt; And I just want you to know that you were created to do great things. Amen. &gt;&gt; It goes on to say that and we mustn't be afraid to ask God to do great things because he's asked us to do the impossible without him. So if he's asked us to do the impossible, we want to have the omnipotent God to do those impossibilities. I believe it was brother Mark that read Mark 11 this morning where it says if you say to this mountain, &gt;&gt; praise God, which shows that when you say something, God has already backed it up. &gt;&gt; Praise God. There's a certain place we can get to in our relationship with Christ where the things that you speak is just as if he spoke it himself. Amen. All right. It it doesn't matter what the need is, what the season is. Praise God. But if you speak it, it shall be done. Praise God. YOU SEE, WHEN GOD TOOK CHRIST INTO THE MOUNTAIN with the disciples, Amen. He looked at him. The Bible says there was a cloud that spoke and the crowd looked at him and says, "Oh, this is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased." Amen. He says, "Hear ye him." It wasn't that God was finished with his work. BUT IT WAS THAT CHRIST GOT TO A PLACE where whatever the situation was, if he spoke something, it was just as if God was speaking himself. And I just believe that there's a place the church of God can get to this morning. THERE'S A PLACE THE BRIDE OF CHRIST CAN get through this morning. That if YOU JUST SPEAK THE WORD, IT'S AS IF GOD IS SPEAKING HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; My my &gt;&gt; the Bible says that we are con conditioned to do great things. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now the prophet says here in this message revelation uh book of symbols he says angelic beings associated associate together. I hope that you get that. That just dropped right down free. Look, if you've got the Holy Spirit in you, then you're a candidate for association with the unseen world and the supernatural. &gt;&gt; No wonder people can't believe in those things. They never come in contact. Praise God. Now, I just want to encourage you this morning that you can reserve yourself to be a candidate for the supernatural. You can be a candidate for healing. You can be a candidate for peace. You can be a candidate for perfection. You can be a candidate for deity. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Look at your neighbor and just say, "I am a candidate." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Whatever you desire, God can do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet goes on to say, "But when the Holy Spirit comes into the heart, quickly he becomes a two-fold being, one on the earth to die and one on heaven to live." Amen. In his body, he's still subject to death, but in his soul, he's passed from death unto life. In his body, he has his earthly contact with his five senses. In his spirit, he has a contact with God through the Holy Ghost. And the angels of God visits them, speaks with them, and they are messengers sent from God to reveal and to bring messages from God to the individual. He's out to get the first thing first. Praise God. Jeremiah 32:17 says, "Ah, Lord God." And I just love how it says it because it so it shows that that that it's a signifying that you are you are taking a moment to recognize the goodness of God. &gt;&gt; You are taking a moment to recognize the deity of God. &gt;&gt; It goes on to say, "Behold, thou hast made the heavens and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm, and there are nothing too too hard for thee." Nothing is too hard for God. &gt;&gt; Amen. We should never come into the presence of God and leave the same way. &gt;&gt; We should never come into the presence of God and and not have our need met. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We should leave in the presence of God lacking nothing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 19. Want to turn here for a moment. Verse 23. And it reads, "Then said Jesus unto his disciples, verily I say unto you, that a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven. And again, I say unto you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God." When the disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, "Who then can be saved?" Now, some and many might take this scripture and have different ways or thoughts about it and maybe say that uh we're not called or we're not uh uh made to be a rich man, right? We might take the understanding that a rich man is not something that God is is is looking for. Praise God. But I just want you to understand that as we read this that Jesus, he never dismissed the question. Amen. He never broke it down on how the poor man will make it or how the rich man won't. Right? He just said that uh uh if you read it again, he he um uh he he does something very particular in verse 26. He says, "But Jesus beheld them and said unto them, with men this is impossible, &gt;&gt; but with God all things are possible." You see, he identified their positions. &gt;&gt; Amen. He he he NEVER DISMISSED THE question and said it couldn't happen. But he identified a position. &gt;&gt; Are you with men this morning or are you WITH GOD? &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WITH GOD ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE. Praise God. Brother Brandham says we inherit all things. Amen. Not just all the money in the world, but all things. Amen. All things belong to you. ALL THINGS ARE SUBJECTED TO YOU. ALL THINGS ARE BELOW YOUR FEET. ALL THINGS ARE WITHIN YOUR TERRITORY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; I want to encourage you. You were called on this lessian age to defy the kingdom of hell. To defy it. When you defy something, it means your presence is known. &gt;&gt; When you defy something, it means that your the enemy knows who you are &gt;&gt; and that you're not afraid to speak God's promises. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It goes on to say, "Then answered Peter, and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all and follow thee. What shall we have therefore?" And Jesus said unto them, "Verily I say unto you, that he ye which have followed me in the regeneration, when the Son of Man shall sit on the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon thrones, judging the 12 tribes of Israel. And everyone that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands for my name's sake shall receive and hundfold, and shall inherit everlasting life. But many that are first shall be last and the last shall be first. And I just believe the reason Amen. Brother Jack can uh come here and preach the message it shall prosper was not a from a position of power but from a position from a place of position. Amen. Because when you recognize what your position is, you have the ability to enforce. You have the ability to claim. Amen. Men can have power but they don't have position. Amen. And we have the position this morning as a bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible uh the prophet says in the message in the exposition of the seven church ages, he said this this quote here. He says, "When the bride will get back to being a word bride, she will produce the very works that Jesus produced." &gt;&gt; Praise God. You see, uh, &gt;&gt; word bride allows you to, uh, get into a a a different place in your position. Praise God. Because you can't separate the word from the word. Praise God. We have the written word. But now I'm looking at the manifested word. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And position places you into purpose. Praise God. And no greater purpose can be served than to be a bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Um I just uh remember that as brother Quinton was preaching uh a few sun a few Wednesdays ago, Brother Quint Jr. and he was talking about Enoch and the pyramids and and and and that just that just kind of did something to me. Uh because when I was studying my uh my my my thought on this, I realized that the Bible says Enoch had this testimony &gt;&gt; that he pleased God. Praise God. And and and and because of that, by faith, the Bible says that he was translated. Amen. And I just began to think about that and I just say this, we can bypass a lot of things when we please God. &gt;&gt; Praise God. When we can just please God, we can bypass a lot of things. Amen. And I just believe that's a unwritten law. Pleasing God. Praise God. It doesn't matter how, where, or when, but just please God. &gt;&gt; We don't know how God how he not pleased God. Right? But we know that he did. Praise God. That was his testimony. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; A prophet says in the message, "How can I overcome?" He says, "Now, Leodysa, that's the last age. There's going to be some overcomers in there. Watch here. They remember each church age. The one preceding it inherits all that the other ones offered. Watch up here. Now, it's after they have done receive all these powers, these new names, and everything written that he promised and eat the hidden mana all down through. There's a reward for overcomers. Press on, lily, if it's in you, lay aside the mud and everything else and press up towards the top. Praise the Lord. Hebrews chapter 6 verse1 17 it reads wherein God willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for God to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for our refuge to lay hold upon the hope that is set before us. Praise God. You can rest on God's promises. &gt;&gt; I believe it was brother Jack that says you can drop your weight on it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because God has guaranteed his word to us in this hour. &gt;&gt; Right. Where he could swear by no greater. He swore by himself. Amen. And he has his word as the unchangeable thing. Praise God. So it it it it's something in this hour to never think any less of ourselves as a bride of Christ because we have been given everything into our bosom. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The prophet says here in the message, well, let me turn to first Corinthians 15. Read a few verses there. Amen. And then it reads in verse 41, there is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the star stars. For one star differth from another star in glory, so also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption. It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power. It is sown in natural body. It is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body and there is a spiritual body. And so it is written, "The first man, Adam, was a living soul. The last man, Adam, was a quickening spirit." Praise God. And we want to thank God this morning that the word has been quickened to us. Amen. That we can put aside oh these things that has kept us bound for ages. Um, we can put aside these things that come to delay the God's promises in our lives. Praise the Lord. Because God's word can quicken us in every facet of our lives. The prophet says, putting on the whole armor of God, he says, just like the word in the beginning was spoken to us in the garden of Eden, spoken word, and the second time it was made flesh and dwelt among us. And the third time it become part of us in the Holy Ghost, dwelling in us, coming down into the man. First, first spoke the word, um the enemy tore it down, then the word was made flesh and he was crucified. But now, amen. There's a difference in the word. The word is become the church. And the church is the word. God, all that God he was, he poured into Christ. All that Christ was, he poured into the church. The Holy Ghost. The enemy has got something. See, he isn't finding something back here. Many people just uh uh just taking the letter. The letter kleth the spirit giveth life. See, and they take these creeds and so forth still killth. But when you are taking the spirit, that's God himself. How do you know it is God? Because he is taking the word and he is manifesting it. Then it's God himself. Oh my. The spoken word. Praise the Lord. And I just take great comfort in knowing that whatever God has spoken in our lives, as we become the word and we would speak the word, it would not return to him void. Praise God. It will accomplish what it's been purposed to do. Praise the Lord. And as we move on here in the message, questions and answers, B uh the prophet of God says, "Now the first man, he made the first man in his image, and we are returning back to that image." &gt;&gt; That's right. To our first created image. Praise the Lord. When God created me, William Brandham, I was before the foundation of the world. He made my being, my spirit. I wasn't conscious of anything as far as I know. I don't believe you're getting it. But now, just a minute just told the disciples, he knew them before the foundation of the world. And Paul said here, he chose us in him before the world began. And it goes on to say, "Now there was some part of me or Neville and the rest of you here that's in Christ Jesus that uh the world ever began." And here's to my analysis of that. I think that the people today that are possessed with his spirit or the spirit a part of these angelic beings, spirits which rotated off of God that never fell in the beginning and resisted the devil's lie in heaven. Now I just prophet of God goes before the beginning here and you see but before the beginning he says he believes we were spirits that never fell in the beginning. &gt;&gt; Amen. So so we are just passing through time. &gt;&gt; Amen. And as we pass through times the heartaches are temporary, the sicknesses are temporary. Uh the the earthly conditions are temporary. But we get to a place when our spirit can be quickened and our body can become subjected to that. Oh, praise God. We realize that we never failed to begin with. We were never sick to begin with. We were never bound to begin with. Praise God. There is an there is an accuser that comes to claim to put these things on us. Praise God. But we have never failed to begin with. I believe it was brother Wesco that says we are healed people being accused to be sick. Amen. I don't know if I said it right, but that's what it is. We're just being accused of being sick. Amen. And I I think according to law, you are innocent until proven guilty. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, you are healed until you the devil can prove you're you're sick. You are free until the devil can prove you're bound. Praise the Lord. You are rich until the devil can prove you are poor. Praise the Lord. That is your condition this morning. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, God makes all things well. The Bible says, &gt;&gt; "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says, "And twothirds of the earth is in sin and more than that which twothirds of the angels was kicked out and those demon spirits come into the people and habitate their body." See what I mean? They're demons what uh once existed and they come into the people and give them a nature. Jesus cast seven of them out of Mary Magdalene. pride, boasts, big people. You see, unclean, filthy, vulgarity, emulation, strife, all these things. See, them were spirits that was made up back there when God began to make man off of uh there in his own image created those spiritual beings, those spirits. Praise the Lord. And every one of those spirits that the prophet of God is speaking here, uh they all died at Calvary. Praise the Lord. When God was on the cross and he overcame the temptations of this world and he he came and he was tested as we are. He said those words, "It is finished." Praise God. Every spirit that has come to tempt you to to try to defile you, those spirits were defeated in Christ. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So we don't have to fight a defeated enemy. Praise God. We can raise authority and leave the enemy where he belongs, which is under your feet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In Mark chapter 4 verse four uh verse 30 it says and he said where onto shall we liken the kingdom of God or with what comparison shall we compare it? It is like a grain of mustard seed which me which when it is sown in the earth is less than all the seeds that be in the earth. But when it is sown, it groweth up and becometh greater than all the herves, and shooteth out great b uh big branches, so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it. But when it is sown, it groweth up and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches, so that the flowers of the earth uh may lodge under the shadow of it. I think I just read that twice. But we just want you to see this that what you see in seed form is not always what you see in the branches. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Uh the the the the the seeds they go through the different seasons. They go through different things. But there comes a time where the seed doesn't remain in that form. It go it comes a time where it grows. And as it brings forth growth, branches come forth, fruits come forth. Praise the Lord. And whatever part of the seed uh uh uh uh ne the the part of the seed never looks like what the branch actually goes through. Amen. And I just believe that as the Bible says we what what is sown in corruption it is raised incorruption. What is sown in dishonor is raised in glory. Praise the Lord. And we are seeds of God on this side of eternity that can bring forth life. life to our uh family members, life to our neighbors, life to our situations. Wherever we are, we are life to this world. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In 1 Corinthians chapter 10 verse 17, praise the Lord. It says, "For we being many are one bread and one body, for we are all partakers of that one bread. Behold, Israel after the flesh are not they which eat of the sacrifices partaker of the altar, which say I then that the idol is is anything? Or there or that which is offered and sacrificed to idols is anything. But I say that the which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils and not to God. And I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils. Praise the Lord. And I just believe that we want to make sure that nothing is hindering us from what God has ordained for us to have. That nothing is hindering us from what belongs to us. Praise the Lord. Because in order for us to experience spiritual growth, we have to be willing to lay aside We have to be willing to put away. We have to be willing to allow ourselves to be subjected to God's word in this day. Praise God. And it goes on to say, "Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of devils. Ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table and be the table of devils." &gt;&gt; Praise God. So, there's got to be a separation at some point, right? God has separators. God doesn't bring people and and and and and have grandchildren and and and and so on. God has separated us. We're called to separate from unbelief. We're called to separate from anything that brings a shadow to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And I like how it says in Proverbs 26:1, he says, "As a dog runth to his vomit, so a fool run returneth to his folly." Praise God. So it shows that that that when God has delivered you from something, when God has taken you from a situation, when God has done something personally to you, praise God, he considers that thing as vomit. Praise God. And God never wants you to return to a vomit situation, to a vomit condition. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I could even say, how do you expect God to bless you in such a condition? Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. and and and vomit is often something or excess that just doesn't belong, right? So, anything can be a vomit situation. Something that is holding or lagging onto you that doesn't belong to be there. Whether it's a friend, whether it's an individual, whether it's a job, whe these things you can consider to be vomit. Amen. And God doesn't want you to cling on to vomit. &gt;&gt; Praise God. God wants to satisfy your mouth with good things. &gt;&gt; Praise God. That is the word of God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In first uh Corinthians verse 13, Paul says here, "For we know in part," this is verse 9, "and we prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away. When I was a child, I spake as a child. I understood it as a child. But when I become a man, I put away childish things. Praise God. And I just believe that one way we could look at this scripture is realizing that there is a place of maturity that we have to get to. Praise God. where where as brother Troy was speaking of the cycles that we kind of endure sometimes where we can be we can find ourselves as the uh exact recipients of the word where every season God is is moving. Every season we see the prosperity of God in our lives. Every season we see that God is withholding nothing because there is a bride that walking upright. Praise God. And he says I put away childish things. Amen. So, it's at a point where our expectations from from from the inside ought to be that God is going to perform what he says. Go. When God does a great thing, it's not uncommon to us because we're expecting for God to move. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says, "I believe that we have been children long enough." &gt;&gt; This isn't a message what here is thou. I believe that we have been children long enough. God is going to turn his church into manhood now. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we played uh and frolic as children, but now we're going to have to put away childish things and take on manhood, maturity. I believe it was Paul that says, "When I was a child, I spake as a child because he thought as a child." But it's time that we begin to think like men and women now, for we've got to get down to business. Praise God. It's time to become the fruit of what we believe. Praise the Lord. Because when we can expect God for something, we should expect it right away. Amen. Uh God's word cannot return to him void. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Proverbs verse 3 uh chapter 3 verse 9 says, "Honor the Lord with thy substance, and with the first fruits of all thine increase. So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall be shall burst with new wine." And I just thought the best way to honor God is by believing him and doing what he says. Praise the Lord. Because when you come to God, you must believe and and and as you believe, you will be rewarded because you are diligently seeking him. Praise God. And and and I just like what it says here that uh uh uh we can honor the Lord with our substance. And we know that faith is the substance. So when we believe God, nothing shall be impossible to you. &gt;&gt; Nothing shall be impossible to you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Romans 8:22 says, "For we know that the whole creation groanth and travaleth in pain together until now. And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the spirit, even we ourselves grown within ourselves, waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body." So you see the whole creation uh which cannot speak but there's an expectation that in all creation for man to operate in their place of authority in their place of do having dominion over creation and I just think if creation knows who is subjected to how much more the devil praise the lord how much more the things around us that we can speak to praise the lord we have the power the the the the control tower lying in us to control every situation. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, in Luke chapter 7 verse 37, we want to pick up this young sister here that through life's journey may have been caught into the wrong places at the wrong time. And she uh certainly got to a place where she wanted to put away childish things. She wanted to put aside whatever it was that was hindering her from getting her blessing. And we pick this up in verse 37. The Bible says, "And behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisees house, brought in alle backter bots of of ointment." And and I'll just stop here for a minute. The prophet says that uh preached a message, the worst sinner in the city. And and I just thought, what what what would what what what did this woman do that would cause the prophet to look at her as the worst sinner in the city? Praise God. And and I just thought that in this whole scene, in this whole uh moment where she's preparing herself to meet Christ, praise God, maybe she had just done something she hadn't she wasn't too proud about. Maybe she had just done something that that that that made her want to think about suicidal thoughts. Praise God. But what I like is that she came to a place where she recognized that if she could just get into the presence of God &gt;&gt; that everything could be changed. If she could just get into the presence of Christ and and and and and that she would she would do what she was set in her heart to do that her situation would change. So she bought an alabaster box maybe with the money that she was using to to prostitute with, right? But she gets to a place where Jesus, the prophet says, enters into this Pharisees home with dirty feet. &gt;&gt; And he wasn't acknowledged. He He wasn't so much uh uh given the kind of attention that he deserved. Praise God. But this woman knew how to attend to the need of the savior, the need of our lord. Amen. And she began to wash his feet. She began to dry his her feet with her hairs. Praise the Lord. And and I just want you to know she did all of this without speaking a word. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So So what she had on the inside spoke louder than what she could actually speak on the outside. &gt;&gt; Praise God. and and and and there Jesus sat and thought and and and and reading the the uh uh hearing the thoughts of the Pharisees and and and and and the Pharisees saying to themselves, "If he knew what kind of woman this was, he would not allow him to touch her." Amen. He would not allow him to touch allow him to touch him. But there's a certain touch that Jesus feels. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when he feels that touch, it changes everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. When he feels that touch, it changes your situation. It causes you not to return back to vomit conditions. It causes you to go from glory to glory. Praise God. From victory to victory. And and and here we we find that the pro the Bible says that uh uh uh her sins which were many were forgiven. &gt;&gt; And Christ says she loved much. &gt;&gt; Amen. So she wasn't happy with what she was doing, the life she was living. Amen. She didn't love it. Praise God. But there was something in her allowing a causing her, drawing her to do these things. Praise God. But there was a love that was great on the inside. It was a love for God. A love to please God. Praise God. And I just want you to know that there's a place we can we we we need to get to where we separate our spirit from our flesh. Praise God. where we can please God from having a fellowship spiritually with him. Amen. Where we can be in the spirit like John as John was in the Lord's day and we can know that we are pleasing God with what we believe. &gt;&gt; Praise God. That's how God wants to be pleased. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. In Romans 8:26 it says, "Likewise, the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities. For we know not what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. And he that searchth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit." So this sister even even when she couldn't say nothing there was something in her that can utter and make intercession to connect to God to make contact with God. Praise God. &gt;&gt; There was another young sister in the days of our prophet that the prophet saw in this an institute and the prophet uh surely thought she had no business being there and and prophet asked the question who is the patient? Are you a patient? And she says, "Yes, I'm I'm the patient." And it was a pretty young lady, the prophet says. You see, and and and and she started to explain her story, tell her testimony, how she grew up in the Catholic home, and how she been through the different organ organizations, the different churches. Amen. But see, she she says that she's tried everything. And the prophet says, "Well, hey, God is obligated to you if you believe." Amen. and and and she got to a place where she started to pray. She started to seek God earnestly. Amen. And then she got up and says, "I got it now. I know I've been free." And the prophet says, "No, no, you haven't gotten it yet." She was excited because I'm in an experience. But God wants to go beyond your experience. Praise God. God wants to make sure that the word is planted and rooted deeply on the inside that even if you can still believe. And the the sister got to that place. Praise God. And when she got up, she she started to earnestly say, "Hey, I know without a doubt that I've been healed." And and and it was in that moment that the prophet says, "Yes, sis. You got it now." Because she made contact with God. God. I want to encourage you that you can make contact with him this morning. Praise the Lord. In Colossians chapter 3 verse one, it says, "If ye be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, which Christ siteth on the right hand of God." Praise God. And as I come to a close, there's a few quotes I just want to read here. The prophet says in the message countdown, he says God made the world. He might have made He might have been 100red trillion years making it. I don't know how long he was, but he made it and didn't say how long it was. And none of it is our business how long it was. He just said in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. Period. That settles it. That's all of it. How long he was doing it. But then the creation begin to spring up now in other time when he began. And I believe that in there that everything on earth reflects heaven. I believe that because you see everything struggling for life is because there is a life that is reflected from. And I believe that when God made them, he started reflecting the smaller things such as the animal life. And the next thing he created was something different. That's just exactly the way the Bible says he did it. He made the first trees and the bottomy life and he made man and the last thing that he ever come for uh from the earth in the form of creation was a man. Nothing higher ever come because why it was a perfect reflection of the highest in heaven which God is a man. God is a man. So therefore it proves it. And when God came down to dwell among us, he was man. It shows the perfection of evolution was God which is a man. And then when you take a tree and you take the grass and so forth, it reflects the tree of life which is in heaven. All these things are struggling for perfection. And everything in this natural as Hebrews says here was made of things which do not appear. Other words they are supernatural and the supernatural is reflecting the natural. Now the natural was eternal. It's uh so everlasting with the supernatural. But sin perverted the natural. And if that be so, which I believe it is, then everything that's happening on earth is a type of the spiritual things h that's happening. See, it's got to reflect something. The achievement of man. Praise God. You are a reflection of God's perfection this morning. Amen. God sees himself when he sees you. Praise God. And that makes you the highest form of creation. Praise God. And through that we know that God's desire is to is to is is not to sit like a retired being. God doesn't retire from his works. But God wants you to be an extension of his works. Amen. Where you can go forth and be the very works that he did on this earth. Greater works. Praise the Lord. Amen. Hebrews 11 chapter 3 says what we read earlier that through faith we understand the words are framed by the word of God. So that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear. So we are candidates for the things that are unseen. And regardless of the situation, we know that God has reserved great and precious things for his people. All we have to do is believe it and realize that we are the the very the very God of this age. Amen. The God of this age that allows us to oversee the spirit of Leodosa, overcome the temptations of the enemy. Amen. A God of this age that allows us to press on and be an overcomer in this lot age. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'll leave you with this here in the message. What shall I do with Jesus called Christ? The prophet says, let me say something too. this uniting time to see churches uniting, nations uniting. It's a uniting time of God and his bride. And I say this with reverence and respect. I believe that the bride of Christ is called. I believe she is sealed in the kingdom of God. I believe the mechanics are there. They're waiting for the dynamics that'll take her off the earth into glory in the rapture. I believe it with all my heart. Yes, sir. We don't know how he's going to do it, but he shall do it. He is the dynamics. We just become members of the machine of the of his body, forming ourselves into his image and see him uniting himself with us in his works and his love gifts as he hands them to us just before the wedding supper. Amen. So, we're supposed to experience God's gifts, precious gifts just before the wedding supper. Amen. As we wait for that gifts, uh these gifts are God's many gifts that he's promised to us in the Bible. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says that the dynamics of this church will be the refilling of the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; that we have worked in a small measure while the headstone is coming down to unite with the body. But when the head of when the head and the body unites together, the full power of the Holy Ghost would rise would raise her up just exactly like that. Even the dead that's dead in Christ 400 years ago will raise in the beauty of his holiness and take a flight to disguise the dynamics is the Holy Spirit. Praise the Lord. Hey young people, if you have not received the Holy Spirit, the baptism of the Holy Spirit, seek earnestly for it because it is what makes the difference. Praise God. Uh the Bible uh the prophet of God says that uh a man without the Holy Spirit is no more than a than an animal. Praise God. No more than a brute beast. So when you have the Holy Spirit, it is what allows you to brings to bring yourself to the place you were in the very beginning where you were spirits of God that never fell in the in the beginning. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; May God bless you richly. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us pray as the musicians make their way. Heavenly Father, Lord God, we thank you this afternoon or this this day that you have made to bring to our remembrance, Lord Jesus. Father God, how we ought to look at ourselves in this hour to look at ourselves to be in the very image of God. to realize, Father God, that you have placed in us, oh God, a a a certain authority, a certain ability, Father God, Lord, uh to speak your word, Father, and to see it happen just as it says in your word, Lord. Father God, we don't want to operate under our privileges, Lord. We we want to take all that is ours, Father. Lord, when someone receives a gift f a gift, Lord God, they have the option to receive it or to reject it. Lord, we receive all of your gifts in this hour, Lord. Father, whatever that gift might be, Father, we we pray this morning that it would operate freely among us, Lord. That God, as we would unite together with the head that is you, Father, that God, we would leave here a powerful bride, not a defeated bride, but a powerful bride, Lord. A bride that knows the exploits of God and knows the greater works, Lord. A bride that has not uh h a lack anything through the days of her being, Lord. So God, we just thank you, Lord, that your word, Father God, can can can continue to seal us and bring us closer, Father, to that place of perfection. Lord, help us, Lord God, that we would all be prepared for that day. Lord, may we continue to earnestly contend for that faith, Lord. Faith to believe the impossible, Lord, to know, God, that we are a deity in this earth, Lord God, that whatever we say, Lord God, you have you have already backed it up, Father God. So, Father, we thank you, Lord. We ask that you would give strength to each one, to each individual, Lord, and you will allow your word to remain the same yesterday, today, and forever. We thank you now. We commit the rest of this service to you. In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Praise the Lord. God richly bless you. Just thank God for just what he's doing in our midst and just believe that he'll he'll continue to do and start and and do what he started. Uh you know, we serve a God that do not sleep or slumber. Amen. and and whatever the need is, God is faithful. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And I just want you to remember that God is looking at himself when he looks at you. Praise the Lord. [Music] [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Say, I shall have [Music] &gt;&gt; what I decree. Yes, I believe it belongs to me. I've said I shall have what I decree cuz I believe it belongs to me. [Music] So I'm going to speak into the atmosphere. Oh, speak into the atmosphere. [Music] Oh, I said I shall have what I decree cuz I believe [Music] it belongs to me. I said I shall have what I decree cuz I believe it belongs to me. Oh, so I'm going to speak into the atmosphere. Hey, speaking to [Music] all you got to do is speak it. Speak it. Speak it. Speak it. Just speak it. Speak it. Speak it. Speak it well. Declare it over your life. Declare it over your circumstance. Declare it over your situation. Declare it OVER YOUR LIFE. COME ON. It's mine. It's mine. GOD gave it to me AND IT'S MINE. THE DEVIL CAN'T HAVE IT. HE CAN'T TAKE it away. It's mine. It's mine. Hey, say yes. Yes. YES. I AGREE WITH THE WORD OF GOD. SAY YES. YES. YES. SO I'M GOING TO speak it to you. Speak it too. Oh, for I shall have what I decree. [Music] I believe it belongs to me. I said I shall have what I decree cuz I believe [Music] it belongs to me. Hallelujah. Come on, put your hands on it. Give God glory. Give him praise. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you Jesus. My God. My God. My God. I appreciate brother Jerry. Amen. On this morning and the highest form of creation and um just uh there was much spoken there. And I I I I need to mention um two two things before I forget. first um something off the off of the subject and then I'll come back to the subject. Off the subject is so good to see sister Lois. Amen. God bless you. God bless you. Amen. So good to see her. Amen. On this morning, uh that's off the subject, but but on the subject, um speaking turns with God. We we got to get in speaking terms. I don't know what translation he was using. Uh but he was saying that man became a speaking spirit. Uh this is this is this is rich and this is something that uh I believe God has uh called us back to. And um I'm I'm kind of getting ahead of myself, but I'm letting you all know uh as we're heading into uh the new year, God will give us He's already been working in my heart with a new theme for next year. And part of what Brother Jerry preached today goes along with that theme. And um and the other thing that I want to just just mention uh cuz and and the reason I'm saying these things because I I I don't know about you, but I am tired of living beneath my privileges. [Applause] &gt;&gt; But first, you you have to recognize what your privilege is, right? And and you know if you um if you were pulled over by uh a police officer uh for going above the speed limit and uh but you knew you checking your your dash and you know I am not going above the speed limit. If they said 40 I was at you know 38. They know I wasn't at I wasn't over the speed limit. And if you if you know without a shadow of a doubt that you are underneath the speed limit when that police officer approaches you, you understand what your privileges and what your rights are and you and and and and when you when you understand that you don't just let people just write you a ticket for and you know you didn't do nothing wrong. What you have to do is stand up for yourself. And the way that you stand up for yourself is how you speak. It's the things that you allow to come out of your mouth. I know that I was not going above the speed limit. I was doing this. I saw you over there and I know for sure that I was not. I mean, you going to let things out your mouth. You ain't going to sit there just agreeing and man writing you up a $200 ticket. I ain't taking this. I will take you to court. I mean, you going to let things come out of your mouth. It's time for you to let things come out of your mouth spiritually when you know who YOU ARE IN CHRIST. &gt;&gt; DON'T LET THE DEVIL JUST RUN ROUGHSIDE. DO WHATEVER he want to do. No, that's it's this thing is changing. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, I I I want to I want to say this to I want to say this. Um, brother Jerry walked into a scripture when he read Genesis 1 uh verse 27. Is that right? Is that where he started? Did he start at 27 and 26? It start at 26. Okay. Well, I'm glad to hear that cuz brother Solomon just wrote a book on Genesis 126. Some of y'all saw him post this week of uh of him uh writing this book that the Lord inspired him to write. And it's all based on Genesis 126, right? And um the book is going to be released on Friday. It's going to and it's a um it's a ebook. Okay, saints. I want to encourage y'all to buy the book that brother Solomon wrote out of our own church. Right. The book that he wrote is coming out on Friday and it's connected to the scripture that brother Jerry read today. Brother Jerry had no idea, right? But what I'm telling you is that God is moving and doing things in our midst. And and and and and I I won't I won't go ahead of the book. I've had a chance to read it and uh and I wouldn't come here and suggest it had had I not read it. Right? But I want to encourage you get the book. It's a ebook. That mean you got to go online and you get on your device. You can read on your device. It won't be anything that you have here, but it's a ebook. But I want to encourage you to read it because I'm also going to tell you that book gonna be connected to next year. So if you want to kind of get a head start on next year, get the book. But I'm telling you, we done walked into something and and and I'm I'm going just I'm going to just speak this out of my mouth. Our church going to change now. And let me let me I I mean I'm talking about I I'm talking about we going to walk in our spiritual blessings. We're going to walk in our natural blessings. We're going to walk in our physical blessings. We're going to walk in our material blessings. God is concerned about every area of our life. And and and this church is going to we going to we going to experience the fullness of God. We're going to have both his dynamics and his mechanics. Everything that God has, we going to have it right here. I I'm telling you, we on our way somewhere. And and and I just believe that this is, you know, I'm just telling you today, this was the beginning of something. There's a shift that's taking place. And uh you will be a part of that shift. But I I I'm just forewarning you and and I'm encouraging you uh be on be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be a part of what God is doing. Amen. I I I just I I when I sat there and I saw these scriptures, I said, "No, I just read this. I just read." I said, "This ain't nothing but God. This ain't nothing but God. This ain't nothing but God." Buy the book. Buy the book. Brother Solomon wrote the book and I think it's going to be a blessing to your soul. It's going to help us for next year. I believe that. Amen. And brother Solomon didn't know where I was going next year. He just pastor, I just got this book that I wrote. I think you might have shared it with me after we had preached that sermon on um on uh it shall prosper. It shall prosper. Um I I'm I'm getting ready to walk in that. I think I told y'all I said my business gonna prosper and I say I'm gonna hire people and and I'mma do this and I'mma do that. You know the Lord just blessed us. We hired a sister from the Philippines to work in our business for us. And um and and the way I look at this is that when you when you're hiring people to work with you, not just for you, but with you, right? uh you become a blessing to them &gt;&gt; and God uses your business to be a blessing. Can you imagine uh being a blessing to somebody all the way over in another country? I say and we're going to add more employees from there. Hallelujah. I I was I was I was told I was told um about this, you know, this thing they call it uh virtual um virtual assistants, you know, and I said, "Well, virtual assistance, what is this all about? I I ain't never heard nothing about this. And they said, "Yeah, yeah, you can get people to answer your phone for you and do this." And I said, "Okay, I mean that that sound real good." And I said, "Now, where where are these people?" They said, "The India, Philippines, so and so." I say, "Oh." Said, "Okay, well, I just went to the Philippines." So, I said, "Let me uh reach out to the pastor over in the Philippines and talk to him and just ask him if he has anybody in his church that do this." And he say, "Hold on. I'll get back with you. I'll get back with you." And next thing you know, I got a a a a message from a a a sister say, "Yeah, pastor, that's exactly what I do." And I said, "Well, if it's one of the saints in the church doing it, yeah, I want to connect with with the believers." &gt;&gt; And and I want this to be a blessing to your family. Oh, hallelujah. Right. and um and and and and Lord have mercy. I was telling my wife, I said, "I didn't even I didn't catch it, but um um you know, just the the just the way the Lord just kind of allowed this sister to kind of come into our life, and I'm just looking for greater things in the upcoming year. I'm looking for I'm looking for greater. I've already start laying claims on how many hours a week that I want in my business. I speak it out of my mouth on a daily basis. &gt;&gt; I I I'm I'm declaring a thousand hours a week on a weekly basis. That's my declaration. 1,000 hours a week is what I'm That's what I'm aiming for. Y'all going to have to start releasing some stuff out of your mouth. If you looking for things to change, I'm going to tell you where it starts changing. Out of your mouth first. And when you when you release it into the atmosphere, you watch that thing begin to come. If you you want a house, &gt;&gt; you want a house, you're going to have to start speaking some things out of your mouth. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, I'm I'm I'm I'm getting myself out here now. There was Let me just say this. I'm I'm I'mma I'mma try to I'mma try to cut off real quick, but I years ago years ago um I was um I was working and I felt I was being underpaid. I felt that I deserved a particular salary and I was being underpaid and I woke up one morning and uh and I looked in the mirror and I said, "You are a $50,000 man." &gt;&gt; I said it. you are a $50,000 man. And and you know, and and um I said, you know, at that time, I mean, that was that was a good a salary, right? And uh and I spoke that out of my mouth. And not only did I speak it, but I believed I was a $50,000 man. &gt;&gt; Come on now. You can't be calling yourself a $50,000 man when you ain't nothing but a $10,000 man. &gt;&gt; Cuz you work you you not working like a $50,000 MAN. BUT I SPOKE WHAT I believe. And with and within two years, I had become what I spoke. &gt;&gt; But here's the problem. When I got there and I had already accomplished it, now what I'm going to be after this. And what God did, I might as well just tell it. But what God did, he he let he let me get to 50 and fill it, but then he doubled me. [Music] &gt;&gt; Ah, then God doubled me in my in my career. God doubled me. &gt;&gt; See, see, I'm going to tell you something. God would go, he'll do the exceeding, the abundant. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. IT'LL BE ABOVE ALL YOU CAN ask or even think. &gt;&gt; But God just want us operating in a certain &gt;&gt; area. And and I'm declaring we going to go through a whole year of operating like this. Not just no one time situation. We're going to go through a whole year starting in January. That's it, sis. It's going to become the norm. And you I and and Wednesday night I'mma probably have to shut down the testimony, sir, because y'all going to have so many testimonies. JUST PASTOR, I GOT ONE. PASTOR, I GOT TESTIMONIES JUST FLYING OUT OF HERE. &gt;&gt; I'm just letting you know what's getting ready to come. I I it it's starting. I'm It's not going to start January 1st. It already started &gt;&gt; and all we're going to do is flow into it. the highest form of creation [Music] speaking turns with God. This where we headed back to. I I tell you, brother Jerry, God bless you. I I thank God for you. Thank you for for just bringing this to our hearts. This is this going this this this this is a blessing. Amen. Let's let's pray. Let's pray. Father, we thank you, Lord. I I just I'm encouraged, Lord, by what I see happening here in the midst of this this this this group of believers. God, even this morning, you would allow me just to see a a scripture and and all night I'm I'm wrestling with the enemy with this ankle of mine and trying to figure out what did I do, what happened, and just don't know. is just a devil attacking. But Lord, you you you you let me see there in the book of Nehemiah that there they did have no swelling of feet for 40 years as they walked through the the wilderness. Father, if you would not allow the people to even ex experience one swollen foot, then I'm not accepting that from the devil right now. So Lord, I'm going to I'm going to keep speaking that over my body until my body comes in line with my confession. And Father, I just I I believe as as brother Jerry just come, Lord, to tell us that we we're on speaking terms with you, Lord. This is what you restore. This is what restoration brought us back to. This what this ultimate restoration looks like for the believer, Father. It brings us back to this spot. So Lord, I I I I just appreciate the sermon and appreciate our our brother. Thank you for the other brothers, Lord, and how he was able to just pull from each one and and Lord, just kind of bring that into his sermon, Father, this morning. We can see you just moving in the midst. And and then even seeing, Father, how you would inspire Brother Solomon to write a book from Genesis 126. And father from that he said he he announced that he was releasing his books on on on next Friday and to come here on this Sunday morning and watch a brother pick up the scripture that he was inspired from. Only you could do things like this. You are moving in our midst. Father, we just we we we believe amen that um Lord Jesus that we will we will experience your best in every area of our life. This journey of restoration that you've called us to, Father, throughout uh these past two years, we have watched it manifest right before our very eyes. We've watched it. And now God uh we know that you will take us Lord just to to to to maybe just another theme but we can see father how you are connecting these things and Lord just to where you want to how you just really want to overflow in the lives of the people but it starts with what we speak out of our mouth. We're speaking our healings. We're speaking deliverance over our families. Lord we're speaking uh to our businesses on our jobs. We're going to prosper. Whatever we set our hands to do, we will prosper cuz that's what you promised us, oh God. And Lord, we're going to walk in that. We're going to walk in the fullness of it. I pray your blessings upon your people as they leave this place, but not your presence. May we go meditating and thinking on the things that have been spoken. Father, many of the saints that'll be traveling, coming back home from South Carolina. We pray traveling mercies over each one. And may you continue to watch over Sister Rachel, Lord, as she's carrying the baby. And Father, you know, all uh that her and brother Steven have gone through and just ask Lord that you give him victory all the way through this. Thank you for manifesting your word. There will be no barren in your midst. I remember brother Smiley speaking that word, Father, some years ago and how the inspiration struck that. We're seeing the manifestation of it, Lord, right before our very eyes, Lord Jesus. If we can see these things happening, Lord, then we ought to see all the other things happening in our midst as well. We give you glory. We give you honor. We give you praise. It's in Jesus' name that we pray. Amen. Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand clap. Hand clap of praise. Amen. Amen. Glory to God. You can be seated. Uh the brothers will come to dismiss you. Amen. At this time, God bless you. [Music] [Music]
