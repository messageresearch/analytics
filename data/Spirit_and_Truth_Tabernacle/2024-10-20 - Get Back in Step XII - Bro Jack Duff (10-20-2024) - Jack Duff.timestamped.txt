[38:24] house of God Amen
[38:28] and um um I wanted to also just um
[38:33] officially welcome sister Smith Amen in
[38:36] our Mitch so so good to have her in
[38:40] fellowship with
[38:41] us we we certainly thank God certainly
[38:45] thank god um Joel 1 and 4 and um I do
[38:52] want to read another scripture but I
[38:54] I'll just have a word of prayer let you
[38:55] be seated uh um and uh we'll go from
[38:59] there but Joel 14 it says um that which
[39:03] the palmerworm with left hath the Locust
[39:06] eaten and that which the Locust has left
[39:08] ha the korm eaten and that which the
[39:10] korm have left ha the caterpillar eaten
[39:14] and um we know according to Joel 2 uh
[39:19] there is a promise that God will restore
[39:22] amen and we'll just read that verse 25
[39:24] and Joel 2 amen just just his promised
[39:28] uh the condition looked hopeless in Joel
[39:33] 1 and if I could just um uh just put it
[39:39] this way some of your situations may
[39:42] look like Joel
[39:45] 14 amen some of your
[39:48] circumstances may look like Joel 14 but
[39:51] you got to keep reading amen and you'll
[39:54] get your promise on the other other side
[39:57] side of it um and and when you're
[39:59] looking at the promise you can't look at
[40:01] the uh the realities of
[40:04] joel4 you have to always keep your eyes
[40:07] on Joel
[40:09] 2:25 because it it tells you what God
[40:12] thinks about it right right amen God see
[40:15] I mean just everything been taken this
[40:18] been taken that been taken feel like a
[40:20] job don't
[40:21] you Hallelujah but you know on the other
[40:25] side of job's uh trial y'all know what
[40:27] he got double you always get double for
[40:33] your trouble come on
[40:37] somebody we we say we we serve the same
[40:41] God if the devil rob you of some Finance
[40:44] expect double everything you
[40:47] lost and I mentioned it over I think I
[40:50] know I mentioned it here and I mention
[40:51] it in um in in in um London earlier this
[40:55] year uh the devil takes one of your
[40:58] loved ones out all right gets them mixed
[41:00] up with some a young man a young woman
[41:04] and they know they've been taught right
[41:07] and they weren't supposed to do that all
[41:10] right but it happens anyway amen and
[41:13] since the devil got involved in all that
[41:16] and caused all this trouble I get double
[41:19] for my
[41:20] trouble so I'm I'm claiming my child and
[41:24] I'm claiming the one they got involved
[41:26] with
[41:27] and if if you keep messing with me I'm
[41:29] going claim they Mama they daddy
[41:34] they I'mma take the whole
[41:37] family glory to God Amen we we have to
[41:42] realize where we stand as Believers amen
[41:45] so this verse in uh uh Joel 2:25 it says
[41:48] and I will restore to you amen the
[41:53] years that the Locust hath eaten the
[41:56] cankerworm and and the caterpillar and
[41:58] the Palmer worm my great Army which I
[42:01] sent among you and ye shall eat in
[42:04] plenty and be satisfied and praise the
[42:07] name of the Lord your God that have
[42:09] dealt wondrously with you and my
[42:13] people glory to
[42:16] God it it look like it's shameful but I
[42:20] when when the scripture say my people
[42:21] should never be ashamed and actually he
[42:24] says it um uh twice
[42:27] Amen in in that in in and the next verse
[42:30] he repeats it again again
[42:32] double all right but uh but the reason
[42:35] that he can say that my people never be
[42:38] ashamed y'all be seated hold on let's
[42:40] pray let's pray let's pray I'm I'm
[42:43] father we thank you for the word and we
[42:45] thank you for this journey that you have
[42:48] uh that you're taking us on and uh God
[42:51] we we are certainly enjoying the ride
[42:54] and father I pray that you would just
[42:56] take control over everything thought
[42:57] that is presented every thought that's
[42:59] received uh get Glory and Honor out of
[43:02] this portion of the services in Jesus
[43:04] name we pray amen amen God bless you be
[43:07] seated uh just uh let me get over to
[43:10] acts uh chapter 2 and but I'll just make
[43:14] a comment here but the reason I I feel
[43:17] that uh Joel could promise US um through
[43:22] the inspiration of God that the people
[43:24] will never be
[43:25] ashamed especially when you looking at
[43:28] your situation as a Joel 14
[43:32] situation but when you start viewing it
[43:34] as Joel 2 uh 25- 27 really um and he
[43:40] says my people should never be ashamed
[43:42] it's
[43:43] because the
[43:46] restoration always looks better than the
[43:50] actual
[43:53] fall or the demise
[43:57] and and you know when when but I mean
[43:59] because just imagine the testimony that
[44:02] is shared when you come through on the
[44:04] other
[44:05] side right so so so that's why God can
[44:08] say they ain't never going to be ashamed
[44:10] because wait till they start sharing
[44:11] their testimony of what God did and all
[44:15] the people that's going to be encouraged
[44:17] and all the people that's going to be
[44:19] set
[44:20] free right that's why my people will
[44:22] never be ashamed amen and some some and
[44:26] and and you know praise God I I heard
[44:28] that this week sometimes you have to
[44:30] walk through the Hall of
[44:32] Shame before you can go into the Hall of
[44:39] Fame
[44:41] amen and that that's what I heard sister
[44:44] told me
[44:48] that but but you have to go through
[44:51] things be before your testimony can be
[44:54] recognized job had to go through
[44:56] something something before we could
[44:58] identify with J come on somebody right I
[45:02] mean you know all the the children of
[45:04] Israel they had to go through things and
[45:07] you understand as they were going
[45:08] through this is where God had the
[45:09] opportunity to manifest his attributes
[45:13] if if you if you didn't have a trial God
[45:15] would never be able to show you nothing
[45:17] if you was never sick you'd never
[45:19] understand him as a Healer if you was
[45:21] Never Bound you never understand him as
[45:22] a deliverer come on somebody amen you
[45:26] have to go through something to be able
[45:27] to enjoy the attributes of
[45:32] God and and it's the trial that releases
[45:35] the
[45:36] [Applause]
[45:38] attribute come on just you don't pray
[45:40] God just take me to it but God bring me
[45:43] through
[45:44] [Applause]
[45:47] it yeah you can go through the fire and
[45:51] not be
[45:53] burned come on somebody you can go
[45:57] through a red sea and not
[46:00] drown this is the god that you serve you
[46:03] can go into a lion's
[46:08] T and not be
[46:12] killed yeah your God know how to protect
[46:15] you your God know how to keep
[46:18] you come on I'm talking about your God
[46:21] this
[46:24] morning I learn to be content in what
[46:26] whatever
[46:28] state I'm
[46:30] in I'm
[46:32] in blessed be the name of Lord I just
[46:34] wanted to
[46:36] read a little bit here I was last week
[46:40] we thank the Lord for taking us there
[46:42] to um Virginia DC area we had a
[46:47] wonderful service there in um at the
[46:51] service brother that I I I hadn't seen
[46:54] in years and I forgot that he actually
[46:56] attended that church but he used to
[46:58] attend uh Church in New York and he um
[47:02] and he he walked up to the car after uh
[47:06] after service and was just you know
[47:08] greeting me and he said brother I want
[47:09] to give you this little um this you know
[47:13] this little
[47:15] track and it said the P Pentecostal
[47:19] Heritage
[47:21] um um uh Incorporated and it just says
[47:25] it happened here the house on Bonnie
[47:29] Bray and uh so I said brother you know
[47:31] you give me this and you know this is
[47:33] where I'm at in my and in in our journey
[47:36] here we talking about the restoration
[47:38] and and and I'm I'm shifting a little
[47:40] bit uh moving from that third stage the
[47:44] first stage of
[47:45] restoration was uh Martin Luther amen he
[47:50] was the the uh the first life messenger
[47:55] brother random said there were four
[47:57] death Messengers a Palmer worm a
[47:59] cankerworm a locust a caterpillar these
[48:02] four death Messengers they begin to take
[48:06] things away from the church praise God
[48:10] it says but there were four life
[48:13] Messengers amen that came back uh that
[48:17] and and they came in their specific
[48:18] Seasons that God sent them first one was
[48:21] Luther and when he nailed them 95 thesis
[48:24] to the Catholic Church door that was
[48:26] bringing life back into the church the
[48:28] Protestant which we would be considered
[48:31] that that's where that began to start
[48:33] when Martin Luther called a revelation
[48:34] that what the Catholics are doing was
[48:36] wrong right now and then after that uh
[48:40] he went took it so far then the Baton
[48:42] was hand over to John Wesley and he
[48:44] brought the sanctification message back
[48:46] into the church and even the Methodist
[48:49] people used to believe that
[48:54] sanctification glory to God John Wesley
[48:56] they preached it right and uh so the
[48:59] sanctification came back into the church
[49:01] and then after that the third life
[49:05] messenger was the restoration of the
[49:11] gifts justification bring life
[49:14] sanctification bring life the
[49:16] restoration of the gifts bring life and
[49:18] then the fourth part is the restoration
[49:20] of the word and and and and and and and
[49:23] really what we have this this not
[49:25] something that uh something new to come
[49:27] we already been preaching the word the
[49:28] restored word is what what shows us
[49:30] where we at right so so so we've been
[49:33] talking about that but uh but it's I
[49:35] thought it was just very important for
[49:36] us to kind of understand you know just
[49:38] what the Lord is doing and really get it
[49:40] uh in our spirits that what we're what
[49:42] we're reading in the Book of Joel is a
[49:44] prophecy
[49:46] for this
[49:49] day my God my God my God if I can if
[49:52] just drill drill that one home it's a
[49:54] prophecy for this day
[49:57] just like Malachi 4 was a prophecy for
[50:03] this day Revelation
[50:06] 107 was a prophecy for this day St Luke
[50:12] 17:30 was a prophecy for this day hello
[50:18] somebody um I can't remember Matthew 17
[50:23] 11
[50:24] through 13 something like that Jesus
[50:27] said that Elias was going to come
[50:29] restore all things that was a prophecy
[50:33] for this
[50:35] day we're living in Prophecy let me let
[50:38] me just read a little bit and I'mma
[50:39] I'mma I'mma Move On by the grace of God
[50:42] I got a uh uh acts Acts 2 I read this I
[50:48] think
[50:50] um at the closing of my
[50:54] last sermon on I get back in Step oh
[51:01] Lord acts two and I tell you as the
[51:04] years going by the Lord just uh let me
[51:06] see that this get back and step was a
[51:07] lot deeper than what I thought amen but
[51:11] here uh let's start at verse one when
[51:13] the day of
[51:14] Pentecost was fully come they were all
[51:18] with one Accord in one
[51:21] place and
[51:24] suddenly praise God now now you got to
[51:27] understand before Acts 2 uh the the
[51:29] disciples were told to go up into the
[51:31] upper room and wait until they were ued
[51:34] with power from on high and they waited
[51:37] 10 days and as they were waiting 10 days
[51:40] not knowing what this power that was
[51:42] that was they were supposed to be in do
[51:44] they had no idea what this was all about
[51:46] but they waited patiently and God comes
[51:49] down now here's here's here's the the
[51:50] scripture that we're picking up now on
[51:52] this 10th day when the day of Pentecost
[51:54] which was fully come they were all with
[51:56] one Accord in one place and suddenly
[51:59] thank you Jesus there came a sound from
[52:02] Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and
[52:05] it filled all the house where they were
[52:07] sitting and there appeared unto them
[52:10] clothing tongues like as of a fire uh
[52:13] and uh and it sat upon each of them this
[52:16] was this clothing tongues is is what we
[52:18] call the pillow fire you saw that but
[52:20] when you see the picture of brother
[52:22] brandom and the and the pillar fire over
[52:24] amen over his shoulder as well as over
[52:26] his head this is a clothing tongue of
[52:28] fire amen and if I could just also make
[52:31] you understand that clothing tongue of
[52:34] fire is the Lord Jesus
[52:36] Christ amen this that that that that
[52:38] that that tongue of fire that pill of
[52:40] fire is the same thing Paul met on the
[52:42] road to Damascus and Paul began to talk
[52:45] to the pil ofier and say who art thou
[52:47] Lord and the pill ofier spoke back to
[52:50] Paul and said I am
[52:54] Jesus Hallelujah Hal hallelujah amen so
[52:58] verse verse four says um uh and and they
[53:01] were all filled at first the verse said
[53:04] the verse three says it set upon each of
[53:06] them and then it says they were all
[53:08] filled I I just I'm just telling you
[53:10] you're in the right place at the right
[53:13] time yes sir I'm telling you that right
[53:16] now and and we talk about the Holy Ghost
[53:18] that I change you from the
[53:19] inside and it'll reflect on the outside
[53:23] praise God Amen you in the right place
[53:25] at the right time
[53:27] uh it says and they were all filled with
[53:30] the Holy Ghost and began to speak with
[53:33] other tongues as the spirit gave them
[53:36] utterance and they and there were
[53:39] dwelling at Jerusalem Jews devout men
[53:41] out of every nation under heaven now
[53:44] when this was noised abroad the
[53:47] multitude came together and were
[53:49] confounded because that every man heard
[53:52] them because heard them speak in his own
[53:54] language and they were all All Amazed
[53:57] and marveled saying one to another
[53:59] behold are not all these which speak
[54:01] galileans so you know again here these
[54:03] people understanding in their native
[54:05] languages what is what has happening on
[54:07] the day of Pentecost this was the
[54:09] miracle behind uh these tongues that
[54:11] were spoken it was spoken in somebody's
[54:13] native language Lord I tell you the
[54:15] truth I I that's why I said we have
[54:18] people here can speak twe uh you know
[54:21] Africans and I mean Spanish and you know
[54:24] Creole and all kind and then you got
[54:26] somebody don't know don't even know
[54:28] nothing about somebody like me I don't
[54:30] know nothing about none of those
[54:30] languages I might know a few words here
[54:32] and there but God to take take control
[54:35] of my mouth and cause me to speak in
[54:37] tongues and amen and I speak in somebody
[54:40] else native language and they say that
[54:42] don't need no
[54:45] interpretation Hallelujah that's perfect
[54:49] Africans come on that's perfect
[54:53] TW God that's what I'm talking about
[54:56] church uh Hallelujah I I believe God has
[54:59] assembled us from various Nations can I
[55:03] put it that way God has assembled us
[55:06] from V various parts of the world Amen
[55:09] for such a time as
[55:13] this amen verse S amen amen uh it says
[55:20] um uh and they were all amazed and
[55:22] Marvel saying one to another behold are
[55:24] not all these which speak G Gans and how
[55:28] hear we every man in our own in our own
[55:30] tongue where we were born uh parthians
[55:34] and mes and uh elamites and the Dwellers
[55:37] in Mesopotamia and in Judea and capadia
[55:40] and pontis and Asia uh friia and P
[55:45] pamilia Egypt and in the parts of Libya
[55:47] about sirene and strangers of Rome Jews
[55:50] and prelit creeks and Arabians we do
[55:53] hear them speak in our own tongue the
[55:55] wonderful works of God Amen and they
[55:58] were all amazed and were in doubt saying
[56:02] one to another what mean this others
[56:06] mocking now I I I I want you to kind of
[56:10] uh catch something because I want to
[56:11] read a little something I this pamphlet
[56:13] others mocking said these men are full
[56:17] of new wine now now now I I didn't share
[56:20] this part with you but typically a man
[56:24] when the Lord moves in a way like moved
[56:26] on the day of Pentecost there's some
[56:28] mocking that goes along with
[56:31] that hello somebody there's somebody to
[56:35] criticize there's somebody to pick at
[56:38] you hello somebody amen there's mocking
[56:42] that happens when when when this this
[56:44] occurs but but uh I'm I'm going read in
[56:46] a second let me just uh wait till I get
[56:48] there it says um others mocking said
[56:51] these men are full of new wine but Peter
[56:54] standing up with the 11
[56:57] lifted up his his voice amen uh lifted
[57:01] up his voice and said unto him ye men of
[57:03] Judea and ye that dwell at Jerusalem be
[57:06] this known unto you and hearken hearken
[57:08] to my words for these are not drunken as
[57:12] ye suppose seeing it is but the third
[57:15] hour of the day Hallelujah but this is
[57:20] that which was spoken by the prophet
[57:24] Joel Amen Let Me just pause there for a
[57:27] second and I want to just pick this up
[57:30] like I told you they have this picture
[57:32] it says it happened here the house on
[57:36] Bonnie Bray and what they're saying the
[57:39] ausa Street Revival uh broke out here at
[57:43] this at this house and a little history
[57:47] you know of the I read you know I talked
[57:48] about this before but uh they bring a
[57:50] few other things out that that I didn't
[57:52] have so I want to just kind of go back
[57:54] and repeat some of this but they were
[57:56] saying um and we stopped at verse 16
[58:00] there uh this house on Bonnie Bray so
[58:04] they were saying um
[58:07] uh that William Seymour arrived there in
[58:11] Los Angeles he began teaching that
[58:13] speaking in tongues uh invariably
[58:16] accompanies the baptism with the Holy
[58:17] Spirit now and let me also just kind of
[58:20] make mention of something here this this
[58:23] group that put out this pamphlet
[58:26] very at the beginning they said uh
[58:28] Pentecostal herit Heritage a nonprofit
[58:31] California religious Corporation bid
[58:33] your holy greetings this organization
[58:35] now I want you to catch this this
[58:36] organization represents several
[58:38] prominent Pentecostal
[58:42] Persuasions
[58:43] several prominent Pentecostal
[58:47] Persuasions including the
[58:50] charismatics Oneness and trinitarians
[58:53] wait a minute there's a lot going on
[58:55] here
[58:56] but but they had to identify all these
[58:58] groups amongst the Pentecostals and and
[59:00] and the reason I'm bringing that out I
[59:02] need to make it very clear what happened
[59:05] Amen on the day of Pentecost was not the
[59:08] full
[59:10] restoration it was part of it but
[59:12] anytime it goes to denominational seed
[59:15] you know right there Satan got
[59:18] involved that is not the end of God's
[59:20] promise so I'm I'm just reading you just
[59:23] like I can give you history from you
[59:25] know uh Martin Luther and John Wesley
[59:28] I'm giving you Pentecostal history but
[59:29] this is a part this was one of the life
[59:32] Messengers that came back into the
[59:34] church now let me just let me just go a
[59:36] little further so if you ever pick up
[59:37] something like that and you start
[59:38] reading all these different groups you
[59:39] know wait a minute this ain't it that
[59:41] ain't that ain't a complete complete
[59:43] picture so let's go on uh it says uh
[59:46] they upon his arrival he's talking about
[59:48] uh William Seymour he began teaching
[59:50] that speaking in tongues invariably
[59:52] accompanies the baptism with the the the
[59:54] Holy Spirit Julia husin son the owner of
[59:57] the mission objected to his teaching and
[1:00:01] ordered Seymour and his supporters to
[1:00:03] leave uh hunterson then Pat locked the
[1:00:06] doors and refused to allow them re-entry
[1:00:09] because he was preaching the word and
[1:00:11] and and and what he saw in the word at
[1:00:13] that time he was denied re-entry well it
[1:00:16] says God placed on Richard and Ruth
[1:00:19] asbury's Hearts uh to open their doors
[1:00:23] here they did and the meeting resumes so
[1:00:26] when God closed one door he opened
[1:00:29] another one amen and I believe the doors
[1:00:32] that they're talking about is the ones
[1:00:33] here at this house the this doors was
[1:00:36] open at Bonnie Bray for them to just
[1:00:38] kind of keep the meetings and and I and
[1:00:39] here's the other thing I want you to get

[1:07:44] Holy Spirit just kind of lead me just to
[1:07:46] kind of just stop and just deal with a
[1:07:48] few things that that I don't normally
[1:07:49] deal with but when I talk about repent
[1:07:52] can I just share my own personal
[1:07:54] testimony just for a little bit
[1:07:56] you know there was a time in my life I
[1:07:59] actually thought I
[1:08:01] repented I actually did you know there I
[1:08:04] remember uh as a young man you know we
[1:08:07] we grew up in church and you know Mom
[1:08:09] and Daddy you know made us go and and um
[1:08:12] you know as as teenagers we really
[1:08:14] didn't want to be made to go to church
[1:08:15] we you know we want to kind of do our
[1:08:17] own thing my dad really wasn't going my
[1:08:19] mom was going but my dad when my dad got
[1:08:21] tired of the foolishness that he saw in
[1:08:22] church that's why he wasn't going but he
[1:08:24] never discouraged us you know he he he
[1:08:26] would encourage us but I remember you
[1:08:28] know uh friends of mine they at their
[1:08:31] Church they had this this movie that
[1:08:32] they were going to play um burning hell
[1:08:37] and uh you know back then everybody
[1:08:38] preached on hell I mean and you didn't
[1:08:40] want to go to hell you you you serve God
[1:08:43] because you didn't want to go to hell
[1:08:45] amen like brother Jean was talking about
[1:08:47] last week he was saying you know you
[1:08:49] call somebody on the phone and and you
[1:08:50] weren't get no answer and we a have
[1:08:52] voicemail back in them days right and
[1:08:54] you we a have text messenger neither
[1:08:56] where they can if they if they can't
[1:08:57] answer they just send you a text and say
[1:08:59] I'll call you back in a minute you
[1:09:01] didn't have none of that back in them
[1:09:02] days you called especially somebody when
[1:09:04] you was really going through something
[1:09:06] you call and couldn't get a hold of them
[1:09:08] you like oh Lord oh God I hope the rap a
[1:09:11] happen we used to live like
[1:09:15] that oh Jesus Lord I can't get a hold of
[1:09:19] them F and now you praying in
[1:09:21] desperation mode and and and here you
[1:09:24] ain't got to live like that if you
[1:09:27] simply repent you can get yourself to
[1:09:30] the spot where real like I know the rap
[1:09:32] chain happen because I ain't
[1:09:35] gone if I'm still here the Rapture a
[1:09:37] took place yet that's the type of
[1:09:40] confidence you can have in
[1:09:42] God but I went there to the church and
[1:09:45] man after I watched that film they
[1:09:47] scared me out of my
[1:09:49] seat soon as they opened up that altar I
[1:09:51] went running down to the altar to give
[1:09:54] my heart to Christ I said yeah yeah yeah
[1:09:56] yeah I I don't want to go to hell I I
[1:09:58] want I want to live for the Lord I want
[1:09:59] to live for the Lord I I don't want to
[1:10:01] go to hell that was my reason for going
[1:10:03] to the altar because I didn't want to go
[1:10:05] to hell but you know what I'm going tell
[1:10:07] you something not wanting to go to hell
[1:10:09] is not enough to keep
[1:10:11] you amen amen it wasn't enough to keep
[1:10:15] me amen and and because even though I
[1:10:17] didn't want to go to hell I still had
[1:10:19] the my friends pulling me in certain
[1:10:21] directions and I want to kind of go in

[1:27:23] church
[1:27:25] that prophecy latest the church age
[1:27:26] let's just go back to acts just just for
[1:27:28] a second I I I'm I'm I'm getting a few
[1:27:30] things all jumbled up here but I think
[1:27:33] we'll we'll we we'll get to where we're
[1:27:34] trying to
[1:27:35] go the first thing I want to say we
[1:27:38] stopped at verse 16 we stopped at verse
[1:27:42] 16 and um I'm I'm I'm going to just it
[1:27:46] said but this is that which was spoken
[1:27:49] by the prophet Joel what they were
[1:27:51] saying here in this little pamphlet
[1:27:55] this house on Bonnie
[1:27:58] Bray the address is
[1:28:01] 216 North Bonnie
[1:28:03] Bray and that's they said it has the
[1:28:06] same number as recorded in the book of
[1:28:08] Acts
[1:28:13] 26 and what happened at that house on
[1:28:16] Bonnie bre the Holy Spirit poured
[1:28:19] out at the address of 216 Bonnie br
[1:28:24] before they actually moov Amen to ausa
[1:28:27] Street uh but it started there at amen
[1:28:29] at the house and they say they found
[1:28:32] that they found themselves the address
[1:28:33] pointed to the scripture
[1:28:37] amen the other thing that happened
[1:28:39] because you know they they said that the
[1:28:40] people when I talked about mocking early
[1:28:42] they said uh there was a little little
[1:28:44] thing here uh where they said um several
[1:28:48] very Ardent newspaper reporters from the
[1:28:50] Los Angeles news media describ the
[1:28:52] building as a Tumbl down t Tumbl down
[1:28:54] Shack reporters began to flood the news
[1:28:57] media with uh voluminous derogatory
[1:29:00] stories about the group's activities one
[1:29:03] journalist wrote a new sect of Fanatics
[1:29:06] is breaking loose they make weird
[1:29:08] babbling sounds and here's the other
[1:29:10] thing they never dismiss
[1:29:16] Church don't no about get up and say you
[1:29:18] can leave no you leave whenever you want
[1:29:21] to leave you come when you want to come
[1:29:22] you leave when you want to leave I you
[1:29:24] talk about a
[1:29:28] Revival and people weren't complaining
[1:29:30] about oh when Pastor going to be
[1:29:33] done as they made more and more
[1:29:36] derogatory stories to try to dis they
[1:29:38] even had a a a a cartoon in here picking
[1:29:43] at
[1:29:44] people for their
[1:29:47] worship they put a cartoon in the
[1:29:50] newspaper just just picking at people
[1:29:52] about how they was worshiping in the
[1:29:53] baby and and speaking in tongues it I
[1:29:55] mean it was mocking a lot of mocking
[1:29:58] however the more they mocked the more
[1:30:00] people wanted to come that's
[1:30:04] right amen and it spread all over the
[1:30:07] world so let them mock I mean maybe
[1:30:10] somebody might mock this this series of
[1:30:12] sermon because like brother you trying
[1:30:14] to take us back to Pentecost no I'm
[1:30:15] taking you
[1:30:19] through no I ain't taking you back I'm
[1:30:22] taking you through like I'm taking you
[1:30:24] through justification and through
[1:30:26] sanctification through Pentecost all the
[1:30:29] way to the restoration of the word but
[1:30:31] all of this goes together yes it does
[1:30:34] these are the life Messengers now I just
[1:30:36] gave you a prophecy I want you to just
[1:30:39] let's read verse
[1:30:40] 17 it shall come to pass in the last
[1:30:43] days which saith God I will pour out of
[1:30:46] my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons
[1:30:48] and your daughters shall prophesy and
[1:30:50] your young men shall see visions and
[1:30:52] your old men shall dreams this is this
[1:30:55] is God's promise to
[1:30:57] us Peter picked it up on the day of
[1:30:59] Pentecost but remember the scripture
[1:31:01] said in the last days not last day it
[1:31:04] was
[1:31:05] pluralized so it's something that
[1:31:07] belongs to us amen so your old men shall
[1:31:10] dream dreams and on my servants and on
[1:31:12] my handm mates I will pour out in those
[1:31:14] days of my spirit and they shall
[1:31:18] prophesy mean you can't stop it
[1:31:21] right and I will show wonders in heaven
[1:31:23] above and signs in the earth beneath
[1:31:25] blood and fire and vape of smoke the sun
[1:31:27] shall be turned into darkness and the
[1:31:29] moon into blood before the great and
[1:31:30] notable day of the Lord uh um come and
[1:31:34] again all the blood moons and all these
[1:31:35] other things that we're seeing these are
[1:31:36] signs of the time and and and uh and
[1:31:39] verse verse 21 says and it shall come to
[1:31:41] pass that whosoever I don't care what
[1:31:43] condition you wi I don't care what sin
[1:31:45] you might have just committed
[1:31:48] whosoever brother Jack you don't know
[1:31:50] what I did last night it don't matter
[1:31:51] are you whosoever
[1:31:54] am you don't know what I did last week
[1:31:56] and last year I don't think God can
[1:31:57] forgive me
[1:32:00] whosoever shall call on the name of the
[1:32:02] Lord shall be
[1:32:06] saved amen but the very next verse I
[1:32:09] just want to touch this just a little
[1:32:11] bit ye men of
[1:32:14] Israel hear these
[1:32:17] words Jesus of
[1:32:20] Nazareth a man
[1:32:25] approved of
[1:32:28] God among
[1:32:31] you by
[1:32:33] Miracles and wonders and signs which God
[1:32:37] did by him in the midst of you as you
[1:32:40] yourselves also know now here Peter is
[1:32:43] bringing them amen back to the man
[1:32:47] Jesus and he's making it very clear that
[1:32:50] you all have seen his miracles you've
[1:32:52] seen the the the dead raised you've seen
[1:32:55] you've heard of the testimony of the
[1:32:57] feeding of the 5,000 feeding of the
[1:32:58] 4,000 I mean walking on water you've
[1:33:01] heard everything this man has been
[1:33:03] approved by God yet you reject
[1:33:06] him but this same Jesus is the one that
[1:33:09] God has raised up this is the one amen
[1:33:11] that we're telling you repent and turn
[1:33:12] from your we ways and start following
[1:33:14] Christ but but but when when Peter uses
[1:33:16] the language um
[1:33:23] I think okay we back we're back check
[1:33:26] the cameras it's all
[1:33:28] good you you want to know why this
[1:33:31] approved by
[1:33:35] God it's approved by God devil can't
[1:33:38] stop
[1:33:39] it right so so so so so what what I what
[1:33:43] I want to I want to say here is Peter
[1:33:45] brings them to the spot where it says
[1:33:47] Jesus a man approved by
[1:33:51] God can I go to some little
[1:33:54] history was
[1:33:57] Moses a
[1:33:59] man approved by
[1:34:02] God now no no I'm not talking about
[1:34:04] approved by man right but I'm talking
[1:34:06] about approved by God how you know
[1:34:08] whether the man is approved by God you
[1:34:10] see the supernatural following his
[1:34:14] ministry was Moses could could could
[1:34:17] Peter said was Moses a man approved by
[1:34:20] God he could have took them back
[1:34:24] Abraham a man approved by
[1:34:28] God
[1:34:30] Daniel a man approved by God the three
[1:34:33] Hebrew boys were men approved by God
[1:34:37] that's
[1:34:43] right Peter a man approved by God Paul a
[1:34:49] man approved by God Jesus now he could
[1:34:52] have said Jesus was God but he just said
[1:34:54] Jesus a man approved by God well can I
[1:35:00] come
[1:35:01] forward I just read you one prophecy and
[1:35:04] I told you two of the three have already
[1:35:07] come to pass we're living in the
[1:35:10] prophecy right now he said a woman would
[1:35:13] rise up and either be president vice
[1:35:15] president or the Catholic Church the
[1:35:17] Catholic churches all will never lose
[1:35:19] their position in the US we know that
[1:35:21] the Catholic Church dominates it we know
[1:35:24] that exactly they all over the scripture
[1:35:26] right so so so here when the prophet
[1:35:28] says that and we are living in a time
[1:35:30] where there is a woman vice president
[1:35:33] for the very first time in our history
[1:35:36] but you know it was a prophecy went
[1:35:38] forth before that
[1:35:40] occurred and now we're living in a
[1:35:44] time let me get this quote that I lat to
[1:35:47] see in church age we're living in a time
[1:35:49] where this could be a triple fulfillment
[1:35:52] of the prophecy
[1:35:54] he said president or vice president or
[1:35:58] the Catholic church and he said thus
[1:36:00] saith the Lord he said write it
[1:36:07] down I know some of us really get
[1:36:10] wrapped up in politics I don't no sir
[1:36:13] and the reason I don't is
[1:36:15] because politics has no
[1:36:20] salvation I don't care who they put in
[1:36:23] the office
[1:36:24] office and and what happens is that they
[1:36:26] they use that person's a figurehead just
[1:36:28] to promote certain agendas ex right and
[1:36:32] just more and more sin just get get
[1:36:34] pushed I mean and you see the parents
[1:36:36] crying out against the the the public
[1:36:39] school system on some of the stuff they
[1:36:40] teaching the kids in school saw a little
[1:36:43] video where a preacher had to go to
[1:36:45] stand before the counsel and he start
[1:36:46] reading out of the book that they were
[1:36:49] giv to the giving to the given to the um
[1:36:51] uh uh to the kids and they told stop
[1:36:54] please don't read no more stop stop he's
[1:36:55] like no you ashamed you you ashamed of
[1:36:57] me reading this don't let me keep
[1:36:58] reading all kind of Filth and stuff all
[1:37:01] over the he just know that a preacher
[1:37:02] reading he said he said he said if
[1:37:04] you're ashamed of me reading it here why
[1:37:06] you going to let my kids you going to
[1:37:08] vote to allow my kids to be taught
[1:37:12] this no repentance for the from the
[1:37:14] people but here the prophet tell us so
[1:37:16] here I want to tell y'all something I am
[1:37:18] not watching
[1:37:21] presidency right that's right
[1:37:24] I'm not watching presidency I already
[1:37:27] know I'm I'm reading tomorrow's
[1:37:29] newspaper today so I already know what's
[1:37:33] about to happen but I am watching
[1:37:35] prophecy now watch this
[1:37:38] prophecy yes sir right you know when a
[1:37:41] Souza Street
[1:37:43] hit the same
[1:37:46] month April 1906 is the same month that
[1:37:50] they had a
[1:37:51] catastrophic um uh uh earthquake in San
[1:37:55] Francisco
[1:37:57] now is there another
[1:38:02] earthquake prophesied
[1:38:06] about and just so it happened that this
[1:38:09] earthquake is supposed to happen where
[1:38:12] isza Street was the same
[1:38:16] city we 91 years away from these
[1:38:19] prophecies all right let me tell you
[1:38:22] another uh history thing about scripture
[1:38:25] when Jonah went into Nineveh and told
[1:38:28] them to
[1:38:29] repent
[1:38:31] um you know the city repented I mean it
[1:38:33] was such a repentance that even the
[1:38:37] animals boy that's something when you're
[1:38:39] Cat come to the
[1:38:45] altar your cat and your dog your horse
[1:38:49] everything repenting I you talking about
[1:38:51] a a massive repentance
[1:38:57] Lord but a 100 years later that city
[1:39:00] fell right back into
[1:39:02] sin a 100 years after Jonah went there
[1:39:06] 100 years later they fell back into s 91
[1:39:08] years 91 years after the prophet speaks
[1:39:12] this almost
[1:39:14] 100 the auu street breaks out there in
[1:39:18] in Los Angeles California and here

[1:39:44] seven visions of of uh that's supposed
[1:39:46] to happen before the coming of the Lord
[1:39:48] uh one of them was um a car shaped like
[1:39:51] a egg that could drive by itself
[1:39:59] y'all it's all over the newspaper the
[1:40:01] test Tesla got that Tesla already uh
[1:40:04] they already been um out west they have
[1:40:07] cabs that will pick you up and drive you
[1:40:10] wherever you want to
[1:40:11] go what they call
[1:40:13] it I don't I don't know but I know and
[1:40:16] and in there but but brother Quinton to
[1:40:17] tell you you can't trust that
[1:40:20] Tesla you jump in brother Quinton
[1:40:23] brother Quint and call this car to him
[1:40:24] come come come I'm over here come come
[1:40:27] pick me up he said while the car was
[1:40:30] coming it made a wrong turn and hit a
[1:40:33] park
[1:40:34] car glad he wasn't in it but we we trust
[1:40:38] all this this technology but let me tell
[1:40:41] you something most of and most time
[1:40:42] they'll tell you oh my they'll tell you
[1:40:45] well look the reason that that happened
[1:40:46] because you didn't get an update right
[1:40:53] that's
[1:40:55] right and and and here in church you're
[1:40:57] getting an
[1:40:59] update a spiritual update oh God let
[1:41:03] let's read this now the prophet said
[1:41:05] this to us then in the sixth Vision
[1:41:08] there arose up in America a most
[1:41:11] beautiful but cruel
[1:41:14] woman she held the people in her
[1:41:17] complete power how can she do that
[1:41:19] because she was the
[1:41:21] president I believe believe that this
[1:41:24] was the rise of the Roman Catholic
[1:41:26] Church though I know it could possibly
[1:41:28] be a vision of some woman rising in
[1:41:32] great power in America due to due to a
[1:41:35] popular vote by women now let me just
[1:41:37] stop there just for a second Hillary
[1:41:40] Clinton fulfill
[1:41:43] that because she won the popular
[1:41:46] vote when when she went against
[1:41:49] President uh um Trump Hillary Clinton
[1:41:52] won the popular vote
[1:41:54] but you know um she didn't win the White
[1:41:57] House and uh but that opened up a
[1:42:01] door that
[1:42:04] when Camala Harris comes along and and
[1:42:07] and let me just let me let me just let
[1:42:08] me just read the quote the quote
[1:42:11] say um could possibly a vision of a
[1:42:14] woman rising in great power where did
[1:42:16] she come
[1:42:17] from any of y'all ever heard of it
[1:42:20] before you had never heard the name
[1:42:22] before
[1:42:23] but it just came out of nowhere when
[1:42:25] they chose her to be the vice president
[1:42:27] just came out but it was it was it was
[1:42:28] the right person to hit a right group of
[1:42:32] people that's
[1:42:33] right who's the right group of people
[1:42:36] how you got more women in in the US than
[1:42:38] you have and boy you should have saw the
[1:42:40] tears that were
[1:42:41] flowing we got a woman in in in in in
[1:42:44] power and just everybody just so Happ
[1:42:46] I'm telling you I'm not looking at
[1:42:48] presidency I'm looking at
[1:42:52] prophecy here's the next part to this
[1:42:54] prophecy that was the sixth Vision
[1:42:55] seventh
[1:42:57] one when we see this manifested now
[1:43:00] there's an and and I'm talking about a
[1:43:01] man approved of God
[1:43:07] sir
[1:43:08] in the last and seventh
[1:43:11] Vision was
[1:43:13] wherein I heard a most terrible
[1:43:18] explosion as I turned to
[1:43:21] look I saw
[1:43:24] nothing but
[1:43:26] debris
[1:43:30] craters smoke no see this this not just
[1:43:32] stopping in San
[1:43:34] Francisco a three-day fire in San
[1:43:37] Francisco but according to our Prophet
[1:43:41] that actually saw a woman rising power
[1:43:44] 91 years ago our Prophet said that there
[1:43:47] was going to be debris craters and smoke
[1:43:50] all over the land of America if there
[1:43:53] ever was a time to
[1:43:56] repent that time is right
[1:43:59] now if there was ever time to live for
[1:44:02] God that time is right now and and let
[1:44:06] let me tell you something uh in the
[1:44:07] midst of all of these things occurring
[1:44:10] we we you see it in the natural you see
[1:44:12] it all I mean the election get ready to
[1:44:14] happen in weeks and when everybody come
[1:44:17] out and you know and they celebrate I
[1:44:19] mean you know you got kind of two two
[1:44:21] historic things about to happen one is
[1:44:24] we could have a female president that's
[1:44:28] historic first time
[1:44:30] ever but you know only the second time
[1:44:32] in history that a president has run won
[1:44:38] lost and then came back this will be the
[1:44:41] second time in our in our US history
[1:44:43] that that has happened two historical
[1:44:46] events right two that's right I'm not
[1:44:49] watching
[1:44:51] presidency and let me tell you tell you
[1:44:53] whether she won or didn't win the
[1:44:56] prophecy already
[1:45:00] fulfilled so I'm not going to be
[1:45:04] crying if it don't happen no what what
[1:45:07] what I need to prepare me for a Rapture
[1:45:10] I already seen it happen amen and I can
[1:45:13] get ready and now I'm living a life that

[1:45:32] relationship with God he's not going
