[43:25] then me and brother Larry and brother
[43:27] Diggs and my son-in-law brother Aaron we
[43:30] all would meet in New York on Thursday
[43:34] the
[43:35] 19th and uh so we bought that got that
[43:38] out of the way a little early and uh so
[43:41] with us meeting in New York you know we
[43:43] had to arrange for our own uh tickets to
[43:45] get there to New York and and I went and
[43:47] got my ticket for New York but I booked
[43:50] that ticket for the 20th to arrive in
[43:54] New York I had made a mistake and didn't
[43:55] even realize I made a mistake State and
[43:58] uh on the morning of I got this text by
[44:01] 8:00 in the morning brother Larry said
[44:04] brother I'm in New York where y'all at I
[44:06] said brother you're supposed to be in
[44:07] New York tomorrow what you you're day
[44:08] you're a day ahead and uh they said no
[44:11] brother Jack we'll leave you on the 19th
[44:13] I said Lord I done messed up so uh I
[44:17] called my wife and told her what was
[44:19] going on and and immediately she
[44:21] canceled all her plans and and she
[44:23] helped me uh find a ticket to get to New
[44:26] York
[44:27] and uh I had to get a different flight
[44:30] um to get me to the Philippines and you
[44:33] know at one point in time I thought
[44:34] about well maybe this ain't the will of
[44:35] the Lord I'm just not
[44:37] going and uh I text a pastor over there
[44:40] and told him what was going on and and
[44:42] he say brother Jack um uh just be calm
[44:47] God getting ready to do
[44:49] something and uh I say okay brother you
[44:52] know so uh we were looking for all kind
[44:54] of things you know to try to get out I
[44:56] was was going to try to go to the West
[44:58] Coast and fly from the West Coast out
[45:00] but I just couldn't find any flights and
[45:02] and the Lord just opened up a flight I
[45:04] happen to call a airline and they said
[45:06] we got we got a seat available for you
[45:09] to fly out tonight if you can get to New
[45:11] York by by 10:30 tonight I say I can get
[45:14] to New York by 10:30 tonight so the Lord
[45:17] just opened up the door and made a way
[45:19] for us to to get there amen and we're
[45:22] just very grateful um some of the
[45:24] reports that came back there was um
[45:27] uh um they
[45:30] had I want to say about 20 people that
[45:33] said uh they wanted
[45:36] to um they wanted to give their lives to
[45:40] the Lord and they wanted to be baptized
[45:42] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[45:44] praise the Lord Hall
[45:47] amen and and one of those people was a a
[45:51] young lady that had been born in the
[45:54] message uh in a message church for 39
[45:58] years and it finally come to a a place
[46:02] where she wanted to make a decision for
[46:04] Christ and uh so I said well my you know
[46:07] if it's if it's just for one
[46:09] Soul uh then the trip was worth it all
[46:13] you know the trip was actually worth it
[46:15] all we thank God Amen and and we got
[46:20] reports uh one of the pastors sent me a
[46:22] text on yesterday and he was saying
[46:25] usually we had I think I think they had
[46:27] about 25 churches represented uh in in
[46:30] the services 25 pastors brought their
[46:32] churches together and um and as they
[46:35] were it says when they um they usually
[46:38] get together and they talk after the
[46:41] services just to see is you know anybody
[46:44] got any complaints about anything any
[46:46] questions about the ministers preaching
[46:48] anything and uh they said it really is
[46:51] almost like the first time um or one of
[46:54] the only times where there was no
[46:57] questions that everybody was very
[46:58] excited about what God had done and they
[47:01] felt the Revival had struck they their
[47:04] country
[47:06] amen amen amen so you know we were um uh
[47:11] we were just grateful you know that the
[47:13] Lord could use us Amen in a way and and
[47:16] I was just telling the pastor I said you
[47:18] know um meetings over Christmas is a
[47:22] very difficult time for us uh uh
[47:26] Christmas is family time amen here in
[47:29] the states and um and um so it's not
[47:33] easy for me to take a meeting you know
[47:35] at Christmas but uh but you know this
[47:38] time you know we we did it by by the
[47:40] grace of God and and and um I know that
[47:43] the Lord was pleased with some of the
[47:44] results that came forth from it but uh
[47:47] but you know I just my my prayer is that
[47:49] uh if I can't go that I can recommend
[47:52] others that can go and uh and one of
[47:55] these days uh my my desires to be able
[47:57] to send brothers from this church amen
[48:00] out there into the fields uh so uh you
[48:04] know the Lord could use them you know
[48:06] and uh but but we were just so grateful
[48:09] uh my my son-in-law was not scheduled to
[48:11] preach at all but when he got there um
[48:14] you know my the pastor asked me and says
[48:17] do you think um you think uh your
[48:19] son-in-law can handle one of the
[48:21] services I said yes he can handle one of
[48:24] them he certainly can and uh um and and
[48:27] and Aaron uh being that he's you know he
[48:31] speaks multiple languages it's easy for
[48:34] him to learn languages so he learned
[48:37] some of the the words of the brothers
[48:40] and sisters from you know Philippines
[48:43] and they got up there speaking their
[48:44] words to
[48:45] them and I'm like now Aaron you done
[48:48] stole these people heart brother you
[48:50] know and uh so but it just put him right
[48:53] you know right there uh on the same
[48:55] level and it just made it so much easier
[48:58] for him to minister and they received
[49:00] his ministry uh in a in a very special
[49:03] way and we're grateful you know just for
[49:05] the the opportunities I love um the
[49:10] scripture being manifested in people's
[49:14] life you don't have to call ahead to let
[49:18] them know you
[49:19] coming you ain't got to call ahead and
[49:21] say I got something in my heart to share
[49:23] with the people you don't do things like
[49:26] that because you break the
[49:28] scripture I'm just talking right now but
[49:32] the scripture says that um man's gift
[49:37] will make room for itself and and and
[49:41] when you ain't done nothing you just let
[49:43] God do it then God can get all the glory
[49:46] praise God amen amen so you know I was I
[49:51] was just happy to to see him experience
[49:54] that uh there and and certainly brother
[49:57] Diggs just did the things that brother
[49:59] Diggs
[50:00] does and uh you know and it just it was
[50:03] a real blessing uh to the people they
[50:06] had heard of his ministry for years and
[50:09] uh like both he and I we had been
[50:11] invited to the Philippines you know
[50:13] number of times but just never really
[50:15] felt the leading to go but this was the
[50:18] time uh after we met last year we met
[50:20] the pastor in in uh in um Australia and
[50:25] uh so this was the year that we felt
[50:27] that okay this is this is a time for us
[50:29] to go the only thing they say they was
[50:31] missing was brother Solomon amen they
[50:33] were asking for him where's brother
[50:35] Solomon where's brother Solomon so when
[50:37] we go back we got to take brother
[50:38] Solomon with us amen uh there to the
[50:41] Philippines and uh but I tell you what
[50:43] brother Larry did a good job
[50:46] substituting for brother
[50:51] Solomon yeah and you know we had taught
[50:54] them because we were trying to get some
[50:56] some songs together and we had taught
[50:58] them brought me through this brought me
[50:59] through that and at the end of the last
[51:02] service the musicians was sitting over
[51:03] there on the keyboard like they're like
[51:05] can we do that brought me through this
[51:06] can we do that can we I'm like man
[51:08] Services is over man we're just going to
[51:11] have to let that one go you know but but
[51:13] I know that they' be happy for us to
[51:15] come back and do that with them they
[51:16] were they were just so just so so
[51:18] blessed by you know uh brother brother
[51:20] L's gift and and they received them you
[51:22] know uh so well I I I was I mean I was
[51:26] just and when when when you start a song
[51:29] you begin to sing it they don't know it
[51:31] but they soon as they put them words up
[51:33] on the screen the people start reading
[51:35] the words and I mean everybody in the
[51:37] congregation got their voice lifted
[51:40] everybody got their voice lifted and and
[51:42] I'm I'm like it you just it's just
[51:45] something you know um I mean just 25
[51:50] churches even coming together in unity
[51:52] like that that's that's a real blessing
[51:54] and you know they they had there are so
[51:56] many Believers in the Philippines that
[51:58] they actually had three meetings going
[52:01] at the same time uh in different
[52:04] different areas uh like four or five
[52:07] hours away but one meeting would have a
[52:09] thousand another meeting have a thousand
[52:11] another meeting have a couple about 800
[52:13] I mean Believers everywhere all over the
[52:15] Philippines and hard to bring them all
[52:17] together in one place so they have to do
[52:19] the meetings like that I believe brother
[52:21] Brian I do was there preaching at one of
[52:23] the meetings and then me and you know
[52:25] brother Diggs at one meeting and I'm not

[55:42] will you just protect us but as I'm as
[55:45] I'm walking on I'll just reach over and
[55:47] touch the D and then just keep on
[55:49] walking praise God that's all you got to
[55:52] do now you you ain't got to stop it in
[55:55] the name of Jesus take your oil light
[55:57] where's the pilot
[56:01] at you don't have to do all
[56:04] that just touch it and just go sit
[56:07] down amen the angel of the Lord
[56:10] encampeth round about them that fear Him
[56:14] and deliver them from all their troubles
[56:19] amen God is good God is good well um I
[56:24] will read a scripture
[56:26] and um we have the Lord has uh um uh
[56:33] given us a journey this year amen and
[56:37] and the inspiration everywhere uh I have
[56:41] gone I've taken this inspiration with me
[56:44] and um and it has been a blessing you
[56:47] know to the churches uh and as I
[56:49] mentioned to you all I I am not finished
[56:54] with the thought and so being that I'm
[56:57] not finished with the thought it is a a
[57:01] carryover amen into the new year and uh
[57:07] uh and and I'll talk a little bit more
[57:09] about that on Tuesday night uh but today
[57:15] um we want to we want to we want to uh
[57:18] get into this subject but I'll I'll just
[57:21] mention that I what however the Lord
[57:24] going to take it it may be more of a
[57:25] teaching
[57:26] but it's okay because uh I think it
[57:29] gives us the uh uh teaching
[57:34] stabilizes and
[57:36] solidifies the church for the young
[57:39] people that may not clearly understand
[57:44] what this message is all about and and
[57:47] when we we we use the term the
[57:50] message you you can't necessarily find
[57:52] that term in the
[57:54] scripture uh now there is is one verse
[57:57] in in in in um I think might might be
[58:00] the John's or something like that this
[58:03] is the
[58:04] message right you'll find something like
[58:06] that but we use that term and you and
[58:08] you won't find that term just like you
[58:10] won't find the term pentacostal church
[58:13] Baptist Church Catholic church Lutheran
[58:16] Church you won't find those terms in the
[58:18] scripture right but uh but what we want
[58:22] to do is find where we fit in the
[58:25] scripture
[58:27] let me read the scripture before I get
[58:29] to talking too much and I'll ask y'all
[58:31] to stand with me I'll just read two
[58:34] verses and then I'll let you I'll pray
[58:36] and let you be seated and we'll just
[58:37] talk a little bit and then we'll let the
[58:40] Lord have his way amen uh I'm going to
[58:45] go to um uh Joel uh chapter one praise
[58:53] God
[58:54] Amen and and um verse four says that
[58:58] which the palmerworm hath left hath the
[59:01] Locust eaten that which the Locust has
[59:03] left hath the cankerworm eaten and that
[59:05] which the cankerworm have left hath the
[59:08] caterpillar eaten and again back over to
[59:11] chapter
[59:12] two um and uh I'll just read verse 25
[59:17] just to make the reading short uh says
[59:19] and I'll restore to you the years that
[59:21] the Locust have eaten the canker worm
[59:23] and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm
[59:25] my great Army which I sent among you uh
[59:29] let's pray father we thank you for the
[59:30] word of the
[59:32] Lord thank you for the ability to read
[59:35] the scripture but um when the Holy Ghost
[59:40] helps us to see what the scripture means
[59:44] father it is even better so father we
[59:47] trust that you would just open our
[59:49] understanding every ear uh that is here
[59:53] may they hear what the spirit has to say
[59:55] and Lord may you just get the glory and
[59:57] the honor out of our gathering and I
[59:59] trust Lord Jesus that um this journey
[1:00:02] that you have us on that father you
[1:00:05] would just begin to uh even make it more
[1:00:07] and more clear to us as to how we fit
[1:00:10] within this portion of the scripture
[1:00:13] it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen God
[1:00:16] bless you you can be seated uh our uh
[1:00:19] title again is get back and step this is
[1:00:22] the journey that we have been on uh
[1:00:25] throughout the this year and um um I was
[1:00:30] just kind of thinking you
[1:00:33] know there was a time in brother
[1:00:37] brandom's Ministry where um a a a lady
[1:00:42] had come uh to get prayer for a child of
[1:00:46] hers that was Ill and um you know
[1:00:51] brother brandom certainly prayed for but
[1:00:53] he told the lady he had a vision uh and
[1:00:56] he told the lady he says you know um
[1:01:00] there is a a country
[1:01:03] doctor and this doctor is going to be in
[1:01:05] a certain place uh at a certain time and
[1:01:09] um and and and uh you're going to see
[1:01:12] this man is's going to have on this
[1:01:14] color suit and you know this this type
[1:01:16] of tie he's is going to be dressed a
[1:01:18] certain way and you're going to see this
[1:01:20] man and you're going to talk to him he
[1:01:22] says and that's going to be the man that
[1:01:24] can actually help help you your son uh
[1:01:28] and say when you kind of come in contact
[1:01:29] with him you're not going to really
[1:01:32] believe uh what what you're experiencing
[1:01:35] at the time so you know he goes through
[1:01:38] the the lady goes through the prayer
[1:01:39] line she hears this prophecy that's
[1:01:41] that's given to her and uh days go by
[1:01:45] and uh be because of sometimes the
[1:01:47] amount of time that goes by it's hard
[1:01:51] for us to believe certain things are
[1:01:53] happening in our life
[1:01:56] hello and and what we find amen is that
[1:02:00] we could be in a
[1:02:02] vision let me put it this way we could
[1:02:05] be in the
[1:02:07] manifestation of a vision and not even
[1:02:10] realize
[1:02:12] it this woman begin to walk the streets
[1:02:16] amen of the city and as she's walking
[1:02:19] the streets of the city she runs into a
[1:02:22] man and uh and the man begin to ask her
[1:02:25] questions about her son and and as as as
[1:02:28] he's asking questions about the son uh
[1:02:31] not telling her who he is but just
[1:02:33] asking questions he had a concern he was
[1:02:35] a real doctor right he had a concern
[1:02:38] because the doctors nowadays all they
[1:02:39] want to do is just give you some pills
[1:02:41] and the pills never deal anything with
[1:02:43] your condition it actually make you more
[1:02:47] ill right but this was a real doctor he
[1:02:49] saw somebody sick and like start asking
[1:02:52] questions and and a lady was responding
[1:02:54] to the questions but the way she was
[1:02:56] responding as if like you know I'mma
[1:02:58] answer your questions but I really want
[1:03:00] you to stop talking to me right and her
[1:03:02] attitude was a little different but but
[1:03:05] before you knew it she looked wait a
[1:03:08] minute the tie the suit had brother
[1:03:11] brandom not given those specific details
[1:03:14] it would have been hard for the woman to
[1:03:16] recognize that she was actually in the
[1:03:21] vision sometimes you need to pay
[1:03:24] attention to the
[1:03:27] details glory to God because when you
[1:03:29] catch it by the details then you know
[1:03:32] where you are and a and scripturally we
[1:03:35] have to know where we are we have to pay
[1:03:38] attention to the details we're not just
[1:03:41] going through this mall of
[1:03:44] life amen that there is an objective
[1:03:47] here amen we're not here to get stuck
[1:03:50] inside the mall of life amen we come
[1:03:53] from God and we're going back to God
[1:03:57] hallelujah amen we got to get out of
[1:03:59] here and our exit is a Rapture so we
[1:04:02] must pay attention to the details had
[1:04:05] brother Troy paid attention to the
[1:04:08] details come on somebody he would have
[1:04:11] known how to get out of the mall that's
[1:04:14] why his wife said you didn't know what
[1:04:16] entrance you came in did you see the
[1:04:18] store that you entered do you know which
[1:04:20] floor you came in on I mean the de The
[1:04:23] Details Matter
[1:04:28] come on somebody so so spiritually I'm
[1:04:31] I'm trying to help the church pay
[1:04:33] attention to the
[1:04:35] details yes amen we have some things
[1:04:38] that we're working with here and um and
[1:04:42] and and and in this you know let me let
[1:04:44] me let me set this up I I I read this
[1:04:48] quote uh the last time I preached out of
[1:04:51] exposition of the church ages I'll read
[1:04:53] it again and uh and and and I I know
[1:04:58] that uh you all going to be just like
[1:05:00] for the whole year you've been hearing
[1:05:02] the same scripture preach over and over
[1:05:05] again I done walked out here for most of
[1:05:07] my sermons probably 80% 85% of the
[1:05:11] sermons that I preach here have been out
[1:05:13] of Joel 1 and Joel 2 now you might say
[1:05:16] well brother Jack when you're going to
[1:05:18] get off to as it was in the days of
[1:05:24] Noah so shall it be and and and and now
[1:05:28] Noah had the same message for 120 years
[1:05:33] and you can imagine how the church got
[1:05:35] tired of what what they were hearing
[1:05:38] amen but by them by them by them failing
[1:05:40] to hear what Noah was preaching they fa
[1:05:43] to to to to get out the mall let's put
[1:05:46] it that
[1:05:49] way
[1:05:50] amen let me read this exposition of
[1:05:54] seven Church ages bear with me uh in
[1:05:57] resume of the ages the prophet says this
[1:06:01] but what about the true seed it says uh
[1:06:05] it will happen just as as we said the
[1:06:08] people of God are being made ready by
[1:06:12] the word of truth from the messenger to
[1:06:17] this age I I I I I'm I'm just bear with
[1:06:21] me this is so important to me um you
[1:06:24] know I I was sharing with the the
[1:06:25] brothers um they when when when the when
[1:06:29] the younger ministers are coming up it's
[1:06:32] very important for me to not not I don't
[1:06:35] want everybody to be like me as far as
[1:06:37] your delivery of the of the me of the
[1:06:39] word everybody got their own style they
[1:06:42] all God makes them a certain way so
[1:06:44] deliver the way that God has giv you to
[1:06:46] deliver it right but the the key is
[1:06:49] deliver the message yes sir amen give us
[1:06:54] the message
[1:06:56] don't give us your feelings don't give
[1:06:58] us just your thoughts right and don't
[1:07:01] give us just you know just what you
[1:07:03] might have got off a YouTube
[1:07:06] video we can tell that ain't the message
[1:07:09] we listen to the message we read the
[1:07:11] message we am man we we hear what the
[1:07:13] prophet say so give us the message that
[1:07:16] I mean the only way we going to be made
[1:07:18] ready for a Rapture is by what we get
[1:07:21] from the word of truth that is given to
[1:07:23] us by the messenger for this age so when
[1:07:26] God give you a thought make sure you
[1:07:27] trace your thought through the message

[1:07:35] amen and and I had some young Brothers
[1:07:37] preaching and um so you know before they

[1:08:22] you're getting your inspiration from so
[1:08:25] so they they they I fin I finally got
[1:08:27] everybody quotes and and then I noticed
[1:08:29] that some was going to be very intense
[1:08:31] about not quoting brother brandom and I
[1:08:33] knew that I knew they were going to do
[1:08:35] it so so I had to quote already so when
[1:08:37] they went up there intentionally not
[1:08:40] quoting brother brandom I came up behind
[1:08:41] him I saying the inspiration where this
[1:08:43] brother get his sermon from is right
[1:08:45] here pull up this
[1:08:48] quote praise the Lord pull up this quote
[1:08:51] and I read the quote this where he got
[1:08:52] his inspiration from Glory we can shout
[1:08:55] amen on that right next one come up and
[1:08:58] and and don't re know well this is where
[1:08:59] he get his inspiration from the third
[1:09:01] one knew not to come up and not read no
[1:09:04] quotes So they had all their quotes
[1:09:06] ready you preaching in a message
[1:09:09] Church yes sir and message people want
[1:09:12] to hear message
[1:09:18] things hello somebody and you go to the
[1:09:21] Pentecostal Church they want you to talk
[1:09:22] about speaking in tongues they they want
[1:09:25] you to talk about an experience that
[1:09:27] that's a Pentecostal Church Hallelujah
[1:09:29] they want to hear things about
[1:09:31] Deliverance that that's that's what they
[1:09:33] feed on but here we we feed on the word
[1:09:36] as it was brought forth from the
[1:09:39] messenger right let me keep reading amen
[1:09:43] the people of God are being made ready
[1:09:45] by the word of truth from the messeng uh
[1:09:47] to this age in her will be the fullness
[1:09:51] of Pentecost for the spirit will bring
[1:09:54] the people right back to where they were
[1:09:56] at the beginning and I love the way this
[1:09:59] this this this is this is
[1:10:01] worded how do we get back how do we get
[1:10:05] back to where we were at the beginning
[1:10:06] it's the spirit bringing us back and and
[1:10:11] so if if it's promised that the spirit
[1:10:13] is going to bring us back you all ought
[1:10:15] to be in expectation that the spirit
[1:10:17] will flow in this
[1:10:19] place we experienced it this year but
[1:10:21] but that's just a that's just a a
[1:10:24] foretaste of what God wants to do y'all
[1:10:26] y'all don't be shocked you come in here
[1:10:29] amen and week after week you start
[1:10:31] seeing these things
[1:10:32] manifested amen hallelujah hallelujah
[1:10:35] but but he said the spirit will will
[1:10:37] bring the people right back to where
[1:10:39] they were at the beginning he says that
[1:10:42] that's that is that's thus say the Lord
[1:10:44] and and this is what brother tro was
[1:10:45] trying to get to us on last week when we
[1:10:47] use the word Pentecost it's a very
[1:10:49] confusing word it's a very confusing
[1:10:52] because people look at the Pentecostal
[1:10:54] organization the Pentecost the church
[1:10:55] and think that's what we talking about
[1:10:57] no we talk about what we read in Acts
[1:11:00] 2 that's the Pentecost of the beginning
[1:11:03] sir yes sir and and and and remember the
[1:11:05] Pentecostal Church actually started with
[1:11:07] acts two but let me finish reading the
[1:11:10] quote they started there so we're not
[1:11:13] going back to where they had we're talk
[1:11:14] about going back to the Bible Acts to
[1:11:16] watch this he says that is thus sayth
[1:11:18] the Lord it is thus sayith the Lord for
[1:11:20] that is what Joel 2: 23- 26 says be glad
[1:11:25] then you children of Zion and rejoice in
[1:11:27] the Lord your God for he has given you
[1:11:29] the former rain moderately and he will
[1:11:31] cause to come down for you the rain and
[1:11:33] and when the Holy when when the Holy
[1:11:35] Spirit fell on the zeusa street they got
[1:11:38] moderate
[1:11:40] rain yes sir they got moderate ring they
[1:11:44] S I mean and and that was scripture you
[1:11:46] cannot take that experience from the
[1:11:48] Pentecostal people God was using that
[1:11:51] for a purpose yes sir they got moderate
[1:11:54] ring
[1:11:55] amen uh but look at this now it says
[1:11:58] give you the former rain moderately and
[1:12:00] he will cause to come down for you the
[1:12:02] rain the former rain and the latter rain
[1:12:05] in the first month and the Flores shall
[1:12:09] be full of Wheat and the fats shall
[1:12:12] overflow with wine and oil and I will
[1:12:15] restore to you the
[1:12:17] years my God amen amen amen that the
[1:12:23] Locust have eaten the C a worm and a
[1:12:26] caterpillar and a Palmer worm my great
[1:12:28] Army which I sent among
[1:12:31] you oh Jesus this is so powerful it says
[1:12:35] and ye shall eat in plenty and be
[1:12:37] satisfied and praise the name of the
[1:12:39] Lord your God that have dealt wonders
[1:12:41] with uh uh dealt wondrously with you and
[1:12:44] my people should never be ashamed now it
[1:12:46] says God is going to restore the
[1:12:50] Lutheran age did not restore the church
[1:12:52] it started a Reformation the Wesleyan
[1:12:55] age and this is John Wesley he's talking
[1:12:57] about did not restore the Pentecostal
[1:13:00] age did not restore amen but God has to
[1:13:04] restore for he cannot deny his word this
[1:13:08] is not the resurrection of the church it
[1:13:11] is the
[1:13:13] restoration God will take the church
[1:13:17] right back
[1:13:19] to Pentecost amen amen yes sir this is a
[1:13:24] promise from God God God will take the
[1:13:28] church right back to Pentecost of the
[1:13:32] beginning so if you hear the way the
[1:13:34] sermons are being preached it is God
[1:13:37] using the ministry to take the
[1:13:42] church
[1:13:43] hallu yes Lord that's why we all
[1:13:46] underneath this inspiration it this is a
[1:13:48] promise from
[1:13:50] God we can help ourselves if we wanted
[1:13:53] to but God say he take the church
[1:13:57] back so you got to use the ministry to
[1:13:59] do that right am oh my my my my my my
[1:14:03] don't get offended at these things this
[1:14:05] is you are you are in a
[1:14:08] vision and you don't realize it the
[1:14:11] vision of Joel chapter
[1:14:14] 2 we're living this we're manifesting
[1:14:17] this right now every day that you've
[1:14:20] been coming to church for this year you
[1:14:22] have been inside this Vision Hallelujah
[1:14:26] thank you Lord Jesus oh my God God will
[1:14:29] take the church right back to Pentecost
[1:14:32] of the beginning he says now notice in
[1:14:35] verse 25 it tells why we need
[1:14:38] restoration why do we need this says the
[1:14:42] Locust the cankerworm the caterpillar
[1:14:45] and the Palm worm have eaten all but the
[1:14:47] root and a small bit of the stem now
[1:14:49] y'all know that's the truth even in some
[1:14:51] of our own personal lives we've been
[1:14:53] attacked by Locust
[1:14:56] caner worm caterpillar I mean I mean uh
[1:14:58] I just done ate up everything but
[1:15:00] there's just a little life
[1:15:03] left and right where the little life is
[1:15:05] left sometimes all you got is just a
[1:15:07] little life just just to get to church
[1:15:09] on
[1:15:11] Sunday some of some of us ain't even got
[1:15:14] that some of us ain't even got strength
[1:15:17] to get out of our house and come to
[1:15:18] church on
[1:15:19] Sunday you get comfortable missing
[1:15:23] church I mean you you comfortable with
[1:15:26] that right but but but but even in that
[1:15:28] condition if there's just a little life
[1:15:31] there God going to restore that
[1:15:34] [Music]

[1:18:02] restoration come God is the one that
[1:18:04] does
[1:18:06] it I don't have to do nothing I'mma let
[1:18:09] God do it by his Spirit he will bring
[1:18:11] forth
[1:18:13] restoration amen I just don't want to
[1:18:15] say things that will go against what
[1:18:17] he's doing amen I don't want to do
[1:18:20] things that's going to go against what
[1:18:21] God is
[1:18:23] doing yes sir let's keep let me let me
[1:18:26] keep going let me keep going all right
[1:18:28] God would take the church right back to
[1:18:31] Pentecost of the
[1:18:34] beginning that's what brother tro was
[1:18:36] telling us that's where we're going
[1:18:37] Pentecost of the beginning not not just
[1:18:39] the denomination even though God used
[1:18:42] the denomination but we're not stopping
[1:18:44] there we're going back to the beginning
[1:18:46] all right watch this now it says now
[1:18:49] notice in verse 25 it tells why we need
[1:18:51] restoration the Locust cankerworm
[1:18:53] caterpillar and palm worm have eaten all
[1:18:55] but the root and a small bit of the stem
[1:18:58] now we are told that all these insects
[1:19:00] are all one and the same in different
[1:19:03] stages that is right they are the
[1:19:05] Antichrist Spirit manifested uh in
[1:19:08] organization denomination and false
[1:19:11] Doctrine Through the
[1:19:14] Ages amen and there's so many false
[1:19:17] doctrines now um let me and I'm going
[1:19:20] just hit this while we're here when when
[1:19:22] when when um William Seymour was
[1:19:25] believing God that the gifts would
[1:19:27] return to the church they was praying
[1:19:29] and seeking God and and when God finally
[1:19:31] manifested on the zeusa street the
[1:19:34] problem was not just William Seymour but
[1:19:36] many others began to teach that you know
[1:19:38] in order for you to have the Holy Ghost
[1:19:40] you had to speak in
[1:19:41] tongues and that's not accurate with
[1:19:45] scripture that's not accurate because um
[1:19:48] John the Baptist the scripture says was
[1:19:52] filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:19:55] in his mother's
[1:19:58] womb now who heard him speaking
[1:20:01] tongues in the womb but the Bible said
[1:20:04] he had the Holy
[1:20:05] Ghost amen right I mean same I mean you
[1:20:09] know and and there's different ones that
[1:20:11] that received the Holy Ghost but they
[1:20:12] never spoke in tongues and you can't say
[1:20:14] that that was the evidence of the Holy
[1:20:15] Ghost so the evidence is actually amen
[1:20:18] the fruit that is be that is being borne
[1:20:20] from your life after you have a holy
[1:20:22] ghost experience what type of life are
[1:20:25] you living after that because we had a
[1:20:27] lot of people in Pentecost and they
[1:20:28] still there y'all know they there they
[1:20:31] speak in tongues and one in one one uh
[1:20:34] uh one instance and then after they
[1:20:36] finish speaking the tongues then they
[1:20:37] will curse you
[1:20:39] out and the Bible declared that out of
[1:20:43] the same mouth you bless and you
[1:20:48] curse so it had to be something greater
[1:20:50] than that sir that's part of it but
[1:20:53] that's not all of it that's right amen
[1:20:56] all right we going on we going on false
[1:20:58] doctrines right so so so here he says uh
[1:21:02] and that poor little root and stalk is
[1:21:03] going to be restored God isn't going to
[1:21:06] plant a new church but it's going to
[1:21:09] bring his original planting back to
[1:21:11] Original Seed he is he is doing it as
[1:21:15] stated in verse 23 by the teaching or
[1:21:18] former rain next will come the Harvest
[1:21:21] rain or rapturing faith I love it let's
[1:21:24] keep going thus at the very at this very
[1:21:27] thus at this very moment we are in the
[1:21:30] complete fulfillment of Matthew
[1:21:33] 24:24 in so much that if it were
[1:21:36] possible they shall deceive the very
[1:21:38] elect now you know you know he say at
[1:21:41] this moment we're in this I got loved
[1:21:44] ones out there in denominational
[1:21:45] churches yielding their talents and
[1:21:47] their gifts to denominational churches
[1:21:49] and the scriptures say Amen
[1:21:52] awake thou that sleep
[1:21:56] arise from the dead and Christ will give
[1:22:01] thee
[1:22:02] light brother brandom say that's people
[1:22:04] working in denominational system amen
[1:22:07] but but but they they don't have the
[1:22:09] full light of the Gospel but yet they're
[1:22:10] working in the midst of it giving
[1:22:12] everything they got for
[1:22:13] it one day the spirit of God is going to
[1:22:16] cause them to wake up and realize that
[1:22:18] if it were possible they they would have
[1:22:20] see the very like they going to see
[1:22:21] something something going to happen in
[1:22:23] that church where they going to see
[1:22:24] something that they no this ain't it I
[1:22:26] know this ain't
[1:22:28] it and they going to come back and don't
[1:22:30] even realize when they coming back it's
[1:22:32] restoration that's all over sir yes sir

[1:24:10] restore God is trying God is absolutely
[1:24:13] trying to restore right in front of your
[1:24:14] eyes he's trying to restore
[1:24:17] amen all right let me keep
[1:24:20] going I I got to get somewhere so it's
[1:24:24] says it says this in so much that if it
[1:24:27] were very if if it were possible they
[1:24:29] should deceive the very L and who is it
[1:24:32] that shall attempt to deceive the very
[1:24:33] elect while the spirit of the Antichrist
[1:24:36] in the false anointed ones of this last
[1:24:39] day these false ones have already come
[1:24:42] in Jesus
[1:24:45] name claim that they have been anointed
[1:24:48] of God for the last day they are the
[1:24:51] false messiah's anointed ones right he
[1:24:54] says they claim that they are prophets
[1:24:57] can y y'all y'all got the this these are
[1:24:59] heavy
[1:25:01] quotes can I can I tell y'all there's
[1:25:04] people that have left this message I
[1:25:06] might as well just say it I'mma say it
[1:25:08] like people left the message because we
[1:25:10] wouldn't receive them as
[1:25:15] prophets because they can see a little
[1:25:18] something let me let me try to bring
[1:25:21] Clarity we do receive Prophets yes
[1:25:27] sir yes but you got to understand where
[1:25:31] your prophetic Ministry is in scripture
[1:25:34] and here's here's the where we receive
[1:25:35] it and he gave some Apostles some
[1:25:41] prophets some pastors some teachers some
[1:25:45] evangelists that's Ephesians 4 your
[1:25:48] ministry fit right there the problem is
[1:25:51] is that because God has giv you the the
[1:25:54] gift of prophet you think that you on
[1:25:58] the same level as brother brandham you
[1:26:02] not on that level and we'll never
[1:26:04] receive you
[1:26:06] there I'mma go
[1:26:10] further there's some that try to make
[1:26:12] brother brandham son on the same level
[1:26:15] as brother brandham we won't receive him
[1:26:20] there God says one prophet
[1:26:25] amen there's one
[1:26:28] manifestation of Malachi 45 and 6
[1:26:31] Revelation 10 one
[1:26:34] one anybody else coming trying to be
[1:26:36] outside of that that that's the spirit
[1:26:39] that we we going to come against it
[1:26:40] every time but if you can find yourself
[1:26:43] in Ephesians 4 and stay
[1:26:47] there all right hello your gift will
[1:26:52] work amen all right look at this
[1:27:00] now they are the false messiah's
[1:27:03] anointed ones they claim that they are
[1:27:06] prophets but are they one with the word
[1:27:09] that's another way to test whether you
[1:27:10] say you're a prophet you're the word of
[1:27:12] the Lord come to the prophet right so so
[1:27:15] are you staying with the word if you
[1:27:16] ain't staying with the
[1:27:19] word watch it now that that look you can
[1:27:22] fool other people out there in
[1:27:23] denominations go out there and just
[1:27:25] prophesy prophesy actually proph a lie
[1:27:28] you can prop a
[1:27:30] lie you you can tell people that they
[1:27:33] going to meet somebody and with with a
[1:27:35] salt and pepper hair and they're going
[1:27:37] to give you some money and you and and
[1:27:39] every these prophets always talk about
[1:27:41] you getting money they always talking
[1:27:43] about you getting money but every
[1:27:46] Prophet every every prophecy is not
[1:27:47] positive when you read the Bible you
[1:27:50] going to die if you don't get your life
[1:27:52] right with God
[1:27:54] yes thus say the Lord boy that that'll
[1:27:58] make you straighten
[1:27:59] up but they prophesy you going to have a
[1:28:02] Ministry one one guy told me that God

[1:29:05] city a
[1:29:07] city I mean people just say anything
[1:29:10] that come to their
[1:29:11] head where in the Bible has God given
[1:29:14] somebody a city like that outside of the
[1:29:17] Old Testament where they fighting for
[1:29:19] cities well why why do I need a city I
[1:29:21] just want a church
[1:29:31] and they hit and
[1:29:34] miss I mean they they they prophesied
[1:29:36] the brother smile about him being Pastor
[1:29:38] before he became pastor at at bible
[1:29:41] truth right they prophesied that and it
[1:29:43] and it occurred exactly the way they
[1:29:46] prophesied it believe sister Sharice and
[1:29:49] was somewhere somebody prophesied to her
[1:29:50] about being in the dental field well
[1:29:53] she's in the dent
[1:29:54] field sometimes it's sometimes it hit
[1:29:58] sometime it don't I don't want to go to
[1:30:00] a church where it hit sometime and then
[1:30:03] other times it don't you don't know what
[1:30:05] to put your faith
[1:30:08] in and and and and truth be told if you
[1:30:12] had a
[1:30:13] prophet that spoke thus sayth the Lord
[1:30:16] and it didn't come to pass that Prophet
[1:30:19] was supposed to die
[1:30:24] but the Pentecostal Church let everybody
[1:30:27] prophesy even little
[1:30:30] babies push everybody speak speak speak
[1:30:34] speak speak he ain't got nothing to
[1:30:38] say one of my friends told me a little
[1:30:40] fell come and lay hands on her the
[1:30:42] Pentecostal Church laid hands on her and
[1:30:44] she just went slaying the spirit
[1:30:45] everybody do that even though they and
[1:30:48] in in nowadays oh Lord I I I don't watch
[1:30:51] videos of this of
[1:30:52] of yeah I ain't gonna call no name this
[1:30:56] man laying hands on somebody and they
[1:30:57] didn't go down he get upset with them
[1:31:00] about them not going down in the spirit
[1:31:02] like everybody he touch has to go down
[1:31:05] that's what proves his ministry and he
[1:31:07] don't prophesy
[1:31:15] lies but it the latest latest say he
[1:31:17] prayed for him and I went down the
[1:31:19] spirit and then he come up after I went
[1:31:21] down he the little boy stood over and
[1:31:22] said get up
[1:31:25] get up in the name of Jesus get
[1:31:30] up we're playing games with
[1:31:34] God truth brother God don't God God is
[1:31:38] not into this
[1:31:40] nonsense see this is why we need a
[1:31:45] restoration let me keep
[1:31:47] reading look at this
[1:31:50] now they claim that they are prophets
[1:31:52] but are they one with the word HT never
[1:31:55] they have added to it or taken from it
[1:31:59] no one
[1:32:00] denies that the spirit of God
[1:32:03] manifesting in gifts is upon
[1:32:05] them nobody deny that look at this but
[1:32:10] like
[1:32:12] bam they all have their
[1:32:16] programs make their appeal for money
[1:32:20] come on y'all y'all know the prophet
[1:32:23] telling the truth trth yes
[1:32:25] sir now we going to pray for the
[1:32:28] sick but I got a $20 line I got a $50
[1:32:33] line and I got a $100 line now if you
[1:32:37] really want prayer if you really want
[1:32:39] that devil cast off of you get in this
[1:32:42] $100 line now you tell me when God put a
[1:32:46] a dollar a dollar amount on
[1:32:50] prayer and we do it every week like it's
[1:32:54] just
[1:32:55] normal it's not normal it is a demonic
[1:32:59] spirit that is inside the
[1:33:02] church and when we recognize it with our
[1:33:04] eyes that this is all the word of God
[1:33:07] then we become part of a restoration
[1:33:09] process and we get somewhere where the
[1:33:11] word of God is going forth in power and
[1:33:13] in
[1:33:16] demonstration I'm going to tell y'all
[1:33:17] something I'm going to tell you how
[1:33:19] powerful the word is the word is so
[1:33:22] powerful that while I'm preaching you
[1:33:25] can be
[1:33:30] [Applause]
[1:33:32] healed without nobody ever laying hands
[1:33:34] on
[1:33:35] you that's how powerful the word
[1:33:39] is and and and and you know how we lay
[1:33:42] hands to on people pray for them to get
[1:33:44] the Holy Ghost well according to the
[1:33:46] scripture while Peter yet spake these
[1:33:50] words the Holy Ghost fell on them yes
[1:33:54] amen man just got got to have something
[1:33:57] to do with it but this is all an act of
[1:34:00] God it's the work of
[1:34:02] God but like balum they all have their
[1:34:05] programs make their appeal for money
[1:34:08] exercise gifts but here's the problem
[1:34:11] but deny the
[1:34:13] word
[1:34:15] or bypass it for fear that a
[1:34:21] controversy might diminish their chances
[1:34:25] for greater
[1:34:29] gain yet they preach
[1:34:33] salvation and
[1:34:36] deliverance through the power of God
[1:34:38] just like Judas with a Ministry imparted
[1:34:41] by
[1:34:43] Christ but because they are wrong seed
[1:34:46] consequently they have the wrong Spirit
[1:34:48] motivating them
[1:34:50] religious oh my they outshine the elect
[1:34:55] in effort and Zeal but it is L to sin
[1:34:58] not of
[1:35:01] Christ watch this one for it looks
[1:35:05] for big
[1:35:08] crowds big
[1:35:10] programs and startling signs amongst
[1:35:14] them they preach the second coming of
[1:35:17] Christ but deny the Advent of the
[1:35:21] Prophet messenger
[1:35:23] though in power and signs and true
[1:35:28] Revelation he eclipses them all now you
[1:35:31] know brother brandom said that you know
[1:35:33] there's people out there right now now
[1:35:36] they the congregations don't know it but
[1:35:38] there's people taking what brother
[1:35:40] brandom said and going into their
[1:35:42] churches and preaching because they know
[1:35:44] his his his uh the revelation God gave
[1:35:47] him eclipes anything they've ever heard
[1:35:48] before so they're using Brother bram's
[1:35:51] sermon a portion of his message they
[1:35:53] preach preaching to the con congregation
[1:35:55] but they will not
[1:35:56] say brother brandom said
[1:36:00] it actually what you are you're a thief
[1:36:04] yes sir behind the pull pit you you you
[1:36:07] it's plagarism you know that you stole
[1:36:10] that from somebody else and you're using
[1:36:13] it like you got something fresh from God
[1:36:16] but you won't give the church the
[1:36:18] [Music]
[1:36:19] whole the whole Source you won't give
[1:36:21] them all that amen right so here brother
[1:36:26] Bram tells us now they preach the second
[1:36:28] coming of Christ but deny the Advent or
[1:36:31] the Aral that's what the Advent the
[1:36:33] arrival right uh the Advent of the
[1:36:36] Prophet messenger though in powering
[1:36:38] signs and true Revelation he eclipses
[1:36:40] them all ah yes this false spirit that
[1:36:43] is in the last days is so close to the
[1:36:47] real can be distinguished only by its
[1:36:49] deviation from the word and whenever it
[1:36:53] is caught in being anti- word it falls
[1:36:56] back on the one argument we've already
[1:37:00] shown to be false and what's the
[1:37:01] argument we get results don't
[1:37:05] we and since we get
[1:37:07] results we have to be of
[1:37:12] God but they off the word so you know
[1:37:16] with that um this Advent of the or the
[1:37:19] arrival of a notable person arrival of a
[1:37:22] prophet of the Prophet messenger what I
[1:37:24] wanted to share uh at this Junction in
[1:37:27] this restoration
[1:37:29] because uh this whole uh uh theme in
[1:37:33] Joel of the palmerworm the korm and the
[1:37:36] C caterpillar Locust uh eating and
[1:37:38] stealing away with God restoring the
[1:37:42] this scripture actually uh is manifested
[1:37:46] through uh the history of the the
[1:37:49] Gentile church and it started in the day
[1:37:52] the the restor ation started in the days
[1:37:55] of Luther brother tro was sharing that
[1:37:56] with us last week when he nailed the 95
[1:37:58] thesis to the Catholic Church door a
[1:38:01] Reformation started but that was part of
[1:38:04] the restoration process but but Luther
[1:38:07] could only care so far he had the judge
[1:38:09] to live by faith and justification we we
[1:38:11] thank God for that but then it had to go
[1:38:13] to sanctification which is the message
[1:38:15] of John Wesley which John Wesley
[1:38:18] actually uh his teachings would be found
[1:38:21] in the Methodist Church
[1:38:24] the Lutheran Church the Methodist Church
[1:38:27] Hallelujah right so John John Wesley
[1:38:30] didn't start the Methodist Church now
[1:38:33] Luther didn't start the Lutheran Church
[1:38:35] it was the people that came after Luther
[1:38:38] that started the Lutheran Church it was
[1:38:40] the people that came after Wesley that
[1:38:42] started the Methodist Church Hallelujah
[1:38:45] but but but when God got so tired of the
[1:38:47] Lutheran he went on to the Methodist and
[1:38:49] when God got tired of the Methodist he
[1:38:51] went on to the Pentecostals that was
[1:38:54] started with with this ausa Street
[1:38:56] Revival praise God the all this was part
[1:38:59] of the restoration but notice amen
[1:39:02] there's there there's four stages to the
[1:39:04] restoration we had first Luther we had
[1:39:07] second Wesley we had third the
[1:39:10] Pentecostals which all three of them
[1:39:12] went into organization and whenever it
[1:39:14] goes into organization God leaves
[1:39:18] it and they just keep going
[1:39:22] on like they going to get their Old
[1:39:24] Glory back let me tell you the lutherans
[1:39:26] will never get their Old Glory back the
[1:39:29] wesling will never get their Old Glory
[1:39:31] back the Methodist because the Methodist
[1:39:32] was just as holy as everybody else right
[1:39:35] the Methodist never get their Old Glory
[1:39:36] God has left it and the Pentecostals
[1:39:38] would never get their Old Glory by let
[1:39:39] me tell you what it is it's kabot sir
[1:39:42] the glory of the Lord has departed sir
[1:39:48] if you're looking for Glory better go
[1:39:49] find
[1:39:50] it because there's a fourth stage
[1:39:53] to this restoration and that is where
[1:39:57] this message comes into play this
[1:40:01] message that we're following so so so so
[1:40:03] in order to follow this message we got
[1:40:05] to see things according to
[1:40:09] scripture the
[1:40:11] Advent of the Prophet messenger the
[1:40:14] coming of the Prophet Messenger right uh
[1:40:18] the arrival of a notable person and and
[1:40:21] brother Bram has come and gone but yet
[1:40:25] we identify that that that God used this
[1:40:28] ministry for a very specific purpose now
[1:40:30] let's read it in scripture we're not
[1:40:33] following a message just to follow a
[1:40:36] message the reason let me tell y'all the
[1:40:38] reason I follow it it's because I can
[1:40:41] see it in the
[1:40:44] Bible yes sir amen amen I remember when
[1:40:51] people tried to promote the prophet's
[1:40:54] son as a new
[1:40:55] messenger I sat down and I say show that
[1:40:58] to
[1:40:59] me in the Bible I said you don't have to
[1:41:01] talk about brother brandham I see that
[1:41:03] part I know what scriptures pertain to
[1:41:04] brother brandham you ain't got to talk
[1:41:06] but show me about this next this next
[1:41:08] messenger you got show me where that
[1:41:10] come because all I see in the Bible is
[1:41:12] only seven
[1:41:13] Messengers that's all I read maybe I
[1:41:15] miscounted something show me in the word
[1:41:18] and don't be trying to give me no
[1:41:21] types don't give me that straight out
[1:41:23] the Bible and and and and la la last
[1:41:26] last time I preached you know I I I took
[1:41:28] you all to uh Malachi 4 that was the
[1:41:31] very first scripture that I that I
[1:41:32] shared I'm going to show you I think I
[1:41:34] got 11 or 12 scriptures and and actually
[1:41:38] uh with with with uh without without us
[1:41:42] knowing it hope we can read between the
[1:41:44] lines I showed you Luther was a part of
[1:41:48] uh Joel 2 25 our restore Luth was a part
[1:41:53] part of that Wesley was a part of that
[1:41:56] so when I say that their Ministries can
[1:41:59] be identified in Joel
[1:42:02] 2:25 Luther's Ministry is there Wesley's
[1:42:07] Ministry is there the Pentecostals
[1:42:11] Ministry is
[1:42:13] there brother brandom's
[1:42:15] Ministry is
[1:42:18] there so if you're looking for one
[1:42:20] scripture out the Old Testament Joel
[1:42:22] 2:25 yes sir yes sir exactly right let's
[1:42:27] go on a little further I gave you
[1:42:28] Malachi 45 and6 and then last time I I
[1:42:30] went through that and showed you where
[1:42:33] the spirit of Elijah was used five times
[1:42:35] amen here uh on Earth it was used five
[1:42:38] times one in um with Elijah himself then
[1:42:41] with Elisha and then with John the
[1:42:43] Baptist and then with brother William
[1:42:45] brandham and then Elijah himself be
[1:42:47] coming back in in uh uh uh Revelation 11
[1:42:51] as one of the two witnesses Elijah and
[1:42:53] Moses and even though it does not have
[1:42:55] their names there in the scripture the
[1:42:57] way that we can tell who who those
[1:42:59] Witnesses are is that their Ministries
[1:43:01] are identified in the scripture very
[1:43:05] simple right their Ministries are
[1:43:08] identified so so I went through that now
[1:43:10] let's go on a little further amen and
[1:43:12] I'm going to give you some more
[1:43:13] scriptures that point to brother
[1:43:15] brandom's ministry here in the scripture
[1:43:17] now the first one before we get there
[1:43:19] let me let me just read a quote out of
[1:43:21] anointed ones at the end time and then
[1:43:23] we will go to Revelation
[1:43:25] 3 Lord Jesus you know and when I when I
[1:43:30] be looking at my notes I'll be thinking
[1:43:32] oh yeah you're going to hit that real
[1:43:34] fast go right hit hit that one fast hit
[1:43:36] that one fast you're gonna be this one
[1:43:37] you're GNA be there and a certain amount
[1:43:38] of time you you'll be at this point then
[1:43:40] I get up here everything get
[1:43:44] delayed but it's
[1:43:46] needful here this quote out anointed
[1:43:48] once at the end time it says notice the
[1:43:51] very day when this messenger
[1:43:53] when he starts on but when he begins to
[1:43:56] declare his
[1:43:57] message right he says see the first pool
[1:44:01] healing second pool prophesying just put
[1:44:06] that in second pool prophesying says
[1:44:09] second pole
[1:44:12] prophesying he says third pole my God
[1:44:18] the opening of the word now that that's
[1:44:23] so important third pull the opening of
[1:44:28] the word the Mysteries
[1:44:31] reveal oh my my my my my the third pull
[1:44:34] is the opening of the word the Mysteries
[1:44:37] reveal look it says no
[1:44:41] more there is no more higher order to
[1:44:45] reveal the word than
[1:44:48] prophets but the only way the prophet
[1:44:51] can be Vindicated is by the word now
[1:44:55] what what we mean by that is we got to
[1:44:56] be able to read in the word that God say
[1:44:58] he was going to do this and then we see
[1:45:00] that Prophet come forth and do those
[1:45:02] things we know God is vindicating his
[1:45:03] word yes sir okay amen he says uh the
[1:45:07] but the only way the prophet can be
[1:45:08] Vindicated by the word and remember the
[1:45:10] third P was the
[1:45:12] opening of them Seven Seals to reveal
[1:45:18] the hidden truth that's been sealed in
[1:45:20] the word do you see it he said it is
[1:45:24] then in that day when this thing is to
[1:45:26] take place that Janice and jambre the
[1:45:29] impersonators will appear again remember
[1:45:33] I told you people leave the message
[1:45:35] because we won't receive them as
[1:45:37] prophets now they ain't telling you that
[1:45:40] but I know I know you getting around
[1:45:43] telling people I'm a prophet too God
[1:45:44] showed me this God and you want us to
[1:45:46] receive you and and because we don't
[1:45:48] call your
[1:45:49] name you get offended we won't call your
[1:45:53] name in that manner you God did not give
[1:45:55] you that type of
[1:45:57] ministry now I'm going to have to just
[1:45:58] bring your profit level way back down
[1:46:01] God did not give you that type of
[1:46:07] ministry
[1:46:08] right all
[1:46:10] right if you don't if you're not careful
[1:46:13] you're going to find yourself right here
[1:46:14] in this quote this quote says and the
[1:46:17] day when this thing do take place that
[1:46:18] Janice and
[1:46:20] jambre the impersonation ERS will appear
[1:46:25] again just like they did when Moses
[1:46:28] appeared with the original word to say
[1:46:30] uh to say it they appear to impersonate
[1:46:33] it just exactly right now you see what
[1:46:36] Matthew 24:24 is see it's anointed ones
[1:46:40] and this is why we got to be able to
[1:46:41] kind of rightly divide through that is
[1:46:43] this an impersonation Spirit or is this
[1:46:46] the real
[1:46:47] thing cu the real thing will stay with
[1:46:50] the
[1:46:51] word amen
[1:46:53] and even in Janice and jambre they they
[1:46:55] come down and Moses come with thus
[1:46:58] sayith the Lord and he threw that stick
[1:46:59] down
[1:47:00] and became a
[1:47:03] snake boy Janice and J Pharaoh looked at
[1:47:05] him say oh
[1:47:08] cheap cheap magician
[1:47:12] trick come here Janice and jamb and they
[1:47:15] show up now what was them folks
[1:47:17] practicing that that that that even
[1:47:20] Pharaoh knew that that was you ain't did
[1:47:22] nothing here Moses T you got thus sayith
[1:47:25] the Lord and here here they come with
[1:47:27] they they two sticks Janice and jamers
[1:47:29] two against
[1:47:30] one Janice throws his down become a
[1:47:33] snake jambis throws his down and become
[1:47:35] a snake and Moses had to sit there and
[1:47:38] look at that now God you done s me down
[1:47:39] here with this this stick to snake
[1:47:43] trick and you sure that me I ain't never
[1:47:45] seen nothing like this but I Lord what
[1:47:47] what is this but Moses didn't get afraid
[1:47:51] Moses stood there because he knew had a
[1:47:53] commission from God and before you know
[1:47:56] it Moses snake rose up swallowed Jamber
[1:48:01] snake Moses snake rose up and swallowed
[1:48:04] uh uh Janice uh snake got both of them
[1:48:07] and and then he picked up the snake and
[1:48:09] it turned back to a stick again now
[1:48:12] where is Janice and Jamber
[1:48:16] snakes they inside my
[1:48:19] stick which showed that God was I mean
[1:48:21] the God that was with MES was
[1:48:24] greater and and any time got to God got
[1:48:26] to show himself greater he
[1:48:31] will I don't care what people come up
[1:48:34] with God will always demonstrate that he
[1:48:36] is greater yes sir I let me put it this
[1:48:40] way God will always one up the
[1:48:44] devil so we don't have to be afraid of
[1:48:46] nothing I'm standing right here with
[1:48:48] this word and we going to watch what God
[1:48:50] we already seen God do it we know God
[1:48:52] got more inore so forth so let's just
[1:48:54] walk in that now Revelation 3:14 let's
[1:48:56] let's let's let's let's let's let's pick
[1:48:58] this up because this is a promise uh of
[1:49:01] um of a ministry that's coming in this
[1:49:03] day amen this is Brother Brandon's
[1:49:05] Ministry promised right here in this in
[1:49:07] this in this in this whole uh uh section
[1:49:10] amen of Revelation 3 it says and unto
[1:49:12] the
[1:49:15] angel of the Church of the lay of the
[1:49:17] sins the angel happens to be a man this
[1:49:20] is not a uh uh a Heavenly being this is
[1:49:24] a man on the earth that God is using
[1:49:27] Amen to bring a message to the people of
[1:49:29] leosa now many we say oh that's just to
[1:49:31] that church in L uh no no no God used
[1:49:34] that church as an example there were
[1:49:36] things happening in that church that
[1:49:38] were represent an entire
[1:49:41] age sir and we so happen to be living in
[1:49:44] that age watch some of the things that
[1:49:45] we read here in scripture let's just
[1:49:47] read the
[1:49:49] Bible unto the angel of the Church of
[1:49:51] the leans right these things sayith the
[1:49:54] amen the faithful and true witness the
[1:49:57] beginning of the creation of God I Know
[1:50:00] Thy
[1:50:01] works that thou art neither cold nor
[1:50:04] hot I would thou were cold or
[1:50:08] hot amen so then because Thou Art
[1:50:14] lukewarm and neither cold nor hot this
[1:50:18] is what God say he going to do cuz you
[1:50:19] a't you ain't on fire or or or you on C
[1:50:23] or you just cold as I don't know what we
[1:50:25] don't want to come to church like that
[1:50:26] don't come to church
[1:50:28] cold I rather see the church on fire

[1:50:56] I mean actually they say I mean it you
[1:50:58] know you you get a church in this
[1:50:59] condition just make you
[1:51:01] sick and the church in its last day is
[1:51:04] making Jesus
[1:51:06] sick let me go on a little further

[1:51:35] names Pentecostal preacher at a diddy
[1:51:42] party you you you you think you do you
[1:51:45] do you think um williiam seore

[1:52:04] us not me I ain't listening to
[1:52:08] nothing if if that's what your preaching
[1:52:11] produced that you can go to a ddy party
[1:52:13] and say that you what you praying for
[1:52:15] him is that right that's well did he
[1:52:18] change
[1:52:25] now says I am
[1:52:29] rich increase with Goods one one one one
[1:52:33] one little fellow another Pentecostal
[1:52:36] preacher last name I think is the
[1:52:39] planis they got a video of him reading a
[1:52:43] scripture and when he start reading the
[1:52:45] scripture he quoting
[1:52:48] it then he say get it from me and read
[1:52:50] it lady said well actually that's not
[1:52:53] what the Bible say the Bible say this
[1:52:56] and it was a rebuke to him the very
[1:52:59] scripture he was quoting was a rebuke to
[1:53:01] him but he claim he he he he he is
[1:53:03] thanking God for all of his Planes all
[1:53:06] of his cars and and all these other
[1:53:08] things I mean they increase with
[1:53:13] Goods let's let's let's just read
[1:53:16] it and have need of
[1:53:19] nothing and let me let me just tell you
[1:53:21] me standing in inside of a a school room
[1:53:25] preaching a sermon like this in their
[1:53:27] Church where where your church at my
[1:53:32] brother where where you worship at
[1:53:34] brother oh you got something to
[1:53:40] say but but miss the
[1:53:42] scripture because I would turn around
[1:53:44] and say uh it's not about where my
[1:53:46] church
[1:53:48] at it's about where God
[1:53:50] is and and and and let's just go back
[1:53:52] since we in the Christmas
[1:53:54] season where did them Shepherds find
[1:53:59] Christ where did they find him was he in
[1:54:02] a nice decorated hospital room was he in
[1:54:05] a mega church was he in the king's
[1:54:07] Palace I'm talking about Christ the one
[1:54:10] that you preaching about where did they
[1:54:14] find
[1:54:19] Christ y'all done y'all done put on a
[1:54:21] big old display here in the church but
[1:54:23] you're missing the point what is the
[1:54:26] point God is
[1:54:28] hidden and then he's
[1:54:30] revealed in
[1:54:35] simplicity so the same Christ they found
[1:54:37] in a
[1:54:38] Manger right they might they'll find him
[1:54:41] in a school room
[1:54:43] today all
[1:54:47] right I'm rich increase with goods and
[1:54:49] have need of nothing but now this is
[1:54:52] what God's testimony is about his
[1:54:54] church knowest thou not knowest th not
[1:54:59] that thou are
[1:55:03] wretched good God now this is what Jesus
[1:55:06] is saying about his church you wretched
[1:55:09] people praying and fasting you
[1:55:13] wretched you
[1:55:19] miserable man this what God think about

[2:00:43] was the reason that we couldn't come to
[2:00:47] church the way we used to come to church
[2:00:50] is because
[2:00:53] right now Adam and Eve had enough sister
[2:00:55] to realize something that changed but
[2:00:57] the church today
[2:01:00] on don't even realize they and oh Lord

[2:02:20] goods and have need of nothing but he
[2:02:22] say knowest thou knowest not that thou

[2:03:17] people to pray over us we want to be
[2:03:19] anointed to be able to feel better in
[2:03:21] our body
[2:03:22] but here in the scripture say anoint
[2:03:23] your eyes with eyes
[2:03:25] myself so you can
[2:03:28] see this is how your blindness going to
[2:03:30] be taken away from you your spiritual

[2:04:00] wonder why the pastor preaching like
[2:04:02] that as
[2:04:04] many as I love if God didn't love you
[2:04:08] wouldn't be feeling the way you're
[2:04:09] feeling right
[2:04:10] now any any any parent that love their
[2:04:14] child ain't going to let them get away
[2:04:16] with
[2:04:18] everything they ain't going to spoil
[2:04:20] that child they going to tell that child
[2:04:22] when they wrong they going a parent that
[2:04:25] really love their child it ain't going

[2:04:37] spanking because if if we if we spare
[2:04:40] the
[2:04:42] rod and I believe the scripture I read
[2:04:45] it to y'all La the last Wednesday night
[2:04:47] that you spare at Rod you actually hate
[2:04:48] your child that's what the Bible say you
[2:04:51] hate you say you love them but the
[2:04:52] scripture say you hate them because you
[2:04:53] won't correct them you got to understand
[2:04:56] your child was born with an evil nature
[2:04:58] just like everybody
[2:04:59] else and evil things going to come out
[2:05:01] that child until they get the Holy
[2:05:05] Ghost
[2:05:07] amen as many as I love I
[2:05:10] rebuke and
[2:05:13] chasen be zealous
[2:05:16] therefore and repent now I want you to
[2:05:19] notice one other condition about this
[2:05:21] church
[2:05:29] behold I stand at the door and knock now
[2:05:33] here's the problem that has happened
[2:05:35] with the church of this day this is why
[2:05:37] we needed a prophet to help us I'm not
[2:05:39] talking about the message church I'm
[2:05:41] talking about denominational churches
[2:05:43] Jesus said I stand at the door and knock
[2:05:46] that mean
[2:05:48] Jesus has been kicked out
[2:05:52] of his own
[2:05:54] church and they'll keep going on like
[2:05:57] people getting saved and everything else
[2:05:59] oh we had a time we had a Time uh-huh
[2:06:03] but Jesus said he's on the outside of
[2:06:05] his church knocking trying to get back
[2:06:07] in now let me tell you something the
[2:06:10] church as a whole denominations as a
[2:06:12] whole will not allow him back in why
[2:06:15] they got too much money without them
[2:06:17] they got too much popularity without
[2:06:19] them they got all these things without
[2:06:21] them so why allow him to come
[2:06:23] in and and how did he get kicked
[2:06:26] out they
[2:06:28] rejected his
[2:06:30] word if you can't receive his word you
[2:06:33] can't receive
[2:06:36] him behold I stand at the door and knock
[2:06:40] and I love this verse this part of the
[2:06:41] verse If any man that means it's an
[2:06:45] individual in the church that has to
[2:06:47] hear his voice and they have to see the
[2:06:50] condition of the church and that
[2:06:51] individual have to open up their heart
[2:06:53] and let him in let me tell you something
[2:06:56] when you open up your heart and let him
[2:06:58] in he won't let you stay in the
[2:07:00] denominational
[2:07:02] Church his spirit will lead you out
[2:07:05] because the Bible says that the holy
[2:07:06] spirit will lead you and guide you
[2:07:12] into part
[2:07:16] truth no it said all truth and and then
[2:07:19] then Paul come around and say he says he
[2:07:21] say says uh uh uh we we we did this in
[2:07:24] part we prophesied in part we did that
[2:07:26] in part he says but when that which is
[2:07:29] perfect is come then that which is in
[2:07:35] part is done away
[2:07:37] with and I'm here to tell you that which
[2:07:40] is
[2:07:41] perfect is here
[2:07:46] amen young people that's why your
[2:07:48] parents don't go to denominational
[2:07:49] churches they might take you to visit it
[2:07:52] they have family day and Friends day and
[2:07:54] this day and that day and every
[2:07:58] day and it's just a little program to
[2:08:00] get you to
[2:08:02] come that's a way for the church to
[2:08:04] outreach you know how we Outreach we
[2:08:07] just preach the
[2:08:11] word Oh I Feel
[2:08:15] Jesus I stand the door and knock and if
[2:08:18] any man hear my voice and open the door
[2:08:20] I will come in to him and will s with
[2:08:23] him and he with me to him that
[2:08:26] overcometh will I grant to sit with me
[2:08:28] in my Throne overcome what overcome this
[2:08:31] lay to see in
[2:08:33] spirit if you can overcome that I'll
[2:08:35] Grant I'll Grant to sit with me in my
[2:08:40] throne even as I also overcame and am
[2:08:43] sat down with my father in his throne he
[2:08:46] that hath an ear individual individual
[2:08:50] he that hath an ear here let him hear
[2:08:54] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[2:08:57] what churches what churches is he
[2:08:59] talking
[2:09:00] about in every age there was a false
[2:09:04] church and a true church and you had to
[2:09:07] be able to rightly divide which one was
[2:09:09] right and which one was wrong let's go
[2:09:11] all the way back to Genesis it was two
[2:09:14] churches in the
[2:09:18] garden Kain had a church
[2:09:22] and he brought the best of the fruit of
[2:09:24] ground uh his vegetables everything he
[2:09:26] brought that and he worshiped the Lord
[2:09:28] with everything he had I mean that for
[2:09:30] that fellow was on his knees giving God
[2:09:32] praise but his brother Abel had a church
[2:09:35] and at his church at his altar he had a
[2:09:38] lamb that he done hacked to Pieces blood
[2:09:40] all over the place blood all over Abel
[2:09:42] and he he just walking the church with
[2:09:44] that lamb in his arms and they landed
[2:09:46] before the altar like oh God please
[2:09:49] receive my worship
[2:09:51] now according to the Book of
[2:09:54] Genesis there was one church that God
[2:09:58] was pleased with and the other church he
[2:10:00] wanted to pleased with even though they
[2:10:02] were
[2:10:03] worshiping I hope y'all get that even
[2:10:06] though they were worshiping God was not
[2:10:09] [Music]
[2:10:16] pleased they they worship they might
[2:10:18] have had a better band
[2:10:21] better praise
[2:10:23] team but God was not pleased with the
[2:10:27] worship and then God came down and even
[2:10:30] told k no no no no I don't I don't
[2:10:32] really like this I don't like this but I
[2:10:35] do like what your brother doing over
[2:10:36] there and if you just do the same thing
[2:10:38] your brother doing I'll receive it but
[2:10:42] you know what it just was not in
[2:10:45] King to follow God's
[2:10:50] Commandments so you know what Cain did
[2:10:52] to try to make God accept his sacrifice
[2:10:55] you want to know what Cain
[2:10:58] did he
[2:11:00] killed the other
[2:11:07] Church yes sir
[2:11:10] amen how do they kill it
[2:11:13] today cuz brother brandom told us you
[2:11:16] ain't got to necessarily stick a knife
[2:11:19] in a man's back
[2:11:22] but if you can just kill his
[2:11:24] reputation and his
[2:11:27] influence Hallelujah then uh you've

[2:15:05] on the outside of his own church

[2:15:10] first church he was walking amongst the
[2:15:12] seven golden candlesticks the church
[2:15:14] ages but in the Le Dean he was on the
[2:15:18] outside trying to get back in his own
[2:15:20] church it shows what this age has done
[2:15:24] to him can I put it this way they have
[2:15:27] crucified Jesus all over
[2:15:32] again they've organized him
[2:15:35] out they've organized his Doctrine
[2:15:39] out they've organized his Bible out they
[2:15:43] got a book of
[2:15:44] Creeds or philos philosophies and so
[2:15:47] forth and they read and accept it
[2:15:49] instead
[2:15:51] instead cold
[2:15:53] confessions instead of letting God come
[2:15:56] in and make a messiah out of them give
[2:15:59] them the baptism of the Holy Ghost to
[2:16:00] show signs and wonders they organized it
[2:16:02] all out pushed him over to one
[2:16:06] side now he's on the
[2:16:08] outside making his last plea trying to
[2:16:12] get
[2:16:15] back in again at the door get back in
[2:16:20] stay step trying to get back in again at
[2:16:24] the door behold I stand at the door
[2:16:26] knock the lead Dean Church age trying to
[2:16:30] get back in his own church where they
[2:16:32] pressed him out isn't that pitiful
[2:16:35] that's the most pathetic thing I can
[2:16:38] think
[2:16:39] of of him in his own church giving his
[2:16:42] life for that church and doing the way
[2:16:45] that that they did and sent the light to
[2:16:48] the church how did he send the light to
[2:16:50] the church how did he in this last day
[2:16:53] we know we know we know Christ came as
[2:16:55] light to the church in his day oh my
[2:16:58] this
[2:16:59] just you know what in Noah's day God
[2:17:02] sent light to the church he sent it
[2:17:05] through the message that he gave
[2:17:06] Noah in Moses day God sent light to the
[2:17:12] church and he did it through the
[2:17:14] messenger that he sent that was the
[2:17:15] messenger of Moses if you want to get

[2:17:27] great flood that was coming you better
[2:17:29] get in that Ark where Noah was preaching
[2:17:32] at
[2:17:33] Hallelujah and today the way God sends
[2:17:36] light to the to the world as he sends a
[2:17:39] prophet with the word of God Amen to
[2:17:42] bring the people back to the word and
[2:17:45] that's the light for their

[2:20:54] down in that Valley and up that mountain
[2:20:56] and and down and say follow the bloody
[2:21:01] Footprints God is taking his Prophet
[2:21:03] home but you don't know what we
[2:21:07] doing we following who you know who know
[2:21:10] whose blood made these Footprints it
[2:21:13] wasn't a prophet it was Jesus blood the
[2:21:16] prophet pointed us back to Jesus and it
[2:21:18] got on out the way and all we got to do
[2:21:21] is follow them bloody Footprints it's
[2:21:23] going to lead us out the mall
[2:21:24] [Music]
[2:21:28] hallu he's on the outside making his
[2:21:30] last flee trying to get back in again at
[2:21:32] the door behold I stand at the door and
[2:21:34] knock the Ley and church H trying to get
[2:21:36] back in his own church amen where they
[2:21:39] pressed him out isn't that pitiful
[2:21:41] that's the most pathetic thing I can
[2:21:43] think of of him in his own church giving
[2:21:45] his life for that church and doing the
[2:21:47] way they did and sent the light to the
[2:21:49] church and and and said he did and they
[2:21:52] rejected it and pushed him on the
[2:21:54] outside accepted some kind of a Creed or
[2:21:56] something the church had made up and
[2:21:58] there he is standing at the outside
[2:22:01] trying to get
[2:22:05] in kicked out of his own church and how
[2:22:07] many churches are
[2:22:08] preaching about him how many churches
[2:22:11] are talking about him but don't even
[2:22:15] realize he's nowhere in the
[2:22:19] midst nowhere where in the
[2:22:21] midst see again as brother Troy saying
[2:22:25] people think that we when we preach
[2:22:27] things like this we say things like this
[2:22:29] they they they mistakenly think that
[2:22:31] we're
[2:22:34] arrogant I'm not
[2:22:36] arrogant I'm just speaking
[2:22:40] truth and and and and you
[2:22:42] misinterpreting my speaking Truth for
[2:22:45] arrogance and and another thing when I
[2:22:47] speak truth with a conviction
[2:22:51] it sounds arrogant to you because you
[2:22:54] listening for the wrong
[2:22:56] thing but let me let me give you another
[2:22:58] Insight on
[2:23:00] that when a woman decides she's going to
[2:23:04] accept a man's proposal for
[2:23:06] marriage that man you know will you
[2:23:10] marry me and and and and and she's so
[2:23:12] happy that he's finally come to this
[2:23:13] decision to marry her when she gets the
[2:23:16] ring from she accepts the ring from that
[2:23:19] man
[2:23:21] is it
[2:23:22] arrogance that she walk around with that
[2:23:25] ring or is
[2:23:28] it
[2:23:30] uh that she's
[2:23:32] chosen that she's
[2:23:36] elected that she's
[2:23:42] bride so if I'm
[2:23:45] bride and he chose me am I supposed to
[2:23:49] be ashamed
[2:23:51] that he chose me no I'll wear my
[2:23:56] ring and I I'll praise the
[2:24:02] Lord I will I will praise the Lord let
[2:24:05] everybody else see my ring because this
[2:24:07] what he gave
[2:24:09] me I'm not
[2:24:11] arrogant I'm
[2:24:12] chosen I'm
[2:24:15] elected I'm
[2:24:17] right I am who God says
[2:24:21] I
[2:24:22] am God bless you
[2:24:24] Church what a year it has
[2:24:27] been and I'm glad God got us going
[2:24:30] further in
[2:24:32] this

[2:24:45] um
[2:24:46] so while all y'all was all the parents

[2:25:08] sung it um here in song service that day
[2:25:12] and I said you know I want to I want to

[2:38:31] Lord for the continuation of restoration
[2:38:34] Lord
[2:38:35] Jesus father we've seen you move
[2:38:38] throughout the year Lord Jesus but you
[2:38:41] have more to accomplish Lord we're so
[2:38:44] grateful Lord that we're walking in the
[2:38:46] vision Lord the manifestation of the
[2:38:48] vision Lord
[2:38:50] we're so grateful for this great grace
[2:38:53] that you have provided for us Lord
[2:38:56] father we thank you Lord God that you a
[2:38:58] year ago you placed this on our pastor's
[2:39:00] heart Lord and each of our Brethren Lord
[2:39:03] have fallen in Step got in Step Lord
[2:39:07] we're preaching a gospel of
[2:39:09] restoration to us as your believing
[2:39:12] children father there's so much Satan
[2:39:15] has taken away from us Lord
[2:39:17] Jesus but when you say I will
[2:39:21] restore father it's not just Lord things
[2:39:26] that we can see that's materially Lord
[2:39:29] but father when we look at wayward
[2:39:31] children Lord when we look at family
[2:39:34] members almighty god father and seeing
[2:39:37] them you're moving in their lives Lord
[2:39:40] God they're asking questions Lord
[2:39:42] and father we know that restoration is
[2:39:45] on the
[2:39:47] scene and we're all walking in Vision
[2:39:50] Lord and if they are part of that Vision
[2:39:53] Lord Jesus they must get back in Step

[2:40:26] being one to you Lord and one sister
[2:40:29] after 39 years Lord being restored
[2:40:33] father and father as the our pastor was
[2:40:36] thinking speaking on this I was thinking
[2:40:40] Lord father when when you open the Red
[2:40:43] Sea with Moses and Joshua stopped the
[2:40:46] son and brother brand spoke squirrels we
[2:40:48] never heard one word about the Angels
[2:40:50] but when a soul is
[2:40:52] converted the Angels just about tear
[2:40:55] Heaven up shouting the Praises of God it
[2:40:58] means so much when a soul is restored
[2:41:01] Lord so father we thank you for this I
[2:41:04] this not idea Lord but this word of
[2:41:08] restoration father may we see it
[2:41:10] fulfilled completely in its completeness
