[53:02] [Music]
[53:04] i was this week i don't know what i'm
[53:06] just thinking to myself i just need
[53:07] myself a good dance
[53:10] i don't go to dances but when i come to
[53:12] church sometimes i just need the spirit
[53:15] just to move a little bit so i can just
[53:17] give the lord a good dance
[53:21] dancing is a sign of victory
[53:25] praise the lord somebody man hey man i
[53:28] was in my office dancing and
[53:30] david got to singing some songs i got
[53:32] that i got them moving in there
[53:35] [Music]
[53:41] let's be dancing
[53:43] [Music]
[53:45] i just i don't mind praising the lord
[53:47] amen i'm a fool for christ who's fooling
[53:50] you
[53:52] but i want you to read this with me amen
[53:55] and just
[53:56] something the lord brought to my spirit
[53:57] this morning while we were hearing
[53:59] prayer the bible says make
[54:02] a joyful noise until the lord
[54:05] all ye lands and when you're making a
[54:06] joyful noise there's gonna be some
[54:08] dancing involved in that
[54:10] right says serve the lord with
[54:12] [Music]
[54:14] hallelujah somebody you can't come
[54:16] before the lord with a sad face but
[54:17] serve the lord with
[54:19] gladness come before his presence with
[54:23] you can't come with just the silent
[54:24] voice god wants you to
[54:26] get involved in the worship right and it
[54:29] says know ye that the lord he is god
[54:32] it is he that hath made us and not we
[54:34] ourselves we
[54:35] are his people and the sheep of his
[54:37] pasture
[54:39] and it says this i love this this is
[54:40] what the lord gave me says enter to his
[54:42] gates with thanksgiving
[54:44] hallelujah and then says also and into
[54:47] his course with praise
[54:49] now i just want to pause there just for
[54:51] a moment because it says entertain his
[54:52] gates with thanksgiving
[54:54] that's just a thankful heart you ought
[54:56] to just be thankful that he woke you up
[54:57] this morning
[54:59] you ought to be thankful that he
[55:00] provided for you last week
[55:02] you ought to be thankful that your bills
[55:04] have been paid you got to be thankful
[55:06] that he watched over your family
[55:07] you ought to be thankful that he keeps
[55:09] making a way
[55:12] you ought to be thankful you ought to
[55:14] think about what god has already done
[55:16] and when you when you're thinking like
[55:18] that that's how you enter
[55:20] [Applause]
[55:25] that's how you enter the gates
[55:27] [Music]
[55:29] i love it when i hear the saints say man
[55:31] hallelujah praise god
[55:33] they're entering the gates with
[55:36] thanksgiving
[55:40] but i want you to notice what david says
[55:43] next he says because
[55:44] you know when you're into it
[55:46] thanksgiving it changes your mood
[55:48] [Music]
[55:49] it changes your attitude it changes your
[55:52] outlook and thanksgiving can then
[55:54] release
[55:55] praise so what happens is that you
[55:58] elevate
[55:59] you go from thanksgiving to praise
[56:03] come on somebody as we go deep up into
[56:06] the presence of god
[56:07] you elevate do not just come through the
[56:11] gates with thanksgiving
[56:12] but you get into the course with some
[56:15] praise
[56:18] [Music]
[56:21] brother i'm coming to church the right
[56:23] way i came with thanksgiving
[56:25] and i have entered into praise
[56:30] to god be thankful unto him and pray and
[56:34] bless his name
[56:36] and the reason we do this is because the
[56:37] lord
[56:39] is good his mercy
[56:43] is everlasting and his truth
[56:46] [Music]
[56:54] [Music]
[56:56] endureth
[56:58] when the bible say his truth and do it
[57:00] to all generations that mean the young
[57:01] people should praise god
[57:03] that means the middle-aged people should
[57:05] praise god that means the older people
[57:08] should praise god
[57:09] even if you high risk you want to give
[57:12] god pray
[57:16] [Music]
[57:16] [Applause]
[57:19] glory to god somebody
[57:21] [Music]
[57:24] hallelujah lord i thank you
[57:28] thank you jesus amen you can be seated
[57:31] in his presence
[57:32] i just want to let the devil know why i
[57:34] was praising the way i was praising him
[57:37] he's a good god he's a good god he's an
[57:39] awesome god
[57:41] almighty god my jesus
[57:44] my jesus
[57:47] how i love him how i love him
[57:51] how i love him hey man and when i when i
[57:54] was
[57:55] reading that i mean just praying over
[57:56] that this morning when you
[57:58] when you approach it the way david say
[58:00] approach it you don't really need
[58:01] anybody to actually pump you up
[58:04] [Music]
[58:06] because see the people next to you ain't
[58:08] going through what you've been through
[58:09] [Music]
[58:10] so when you begin to just thank god for
[58:12] what he's done for you
[58:14] you're coming into his gates with
[58:16] thanksgiving
[58:18] oh my god my god my
[58:21] the time you start thinking i might
[58:23] guarantee you your feet to get light

[1:18:30] just an update on our
[1:18:32] uh uh building fund uh lord has placed
[1:18:35] it upon our heart to
[1:18:36] uh seek our own place of worship
[1:18:40] not just pay rent but we want to own our
[1:18:42] own place and
[1:18:43] we have been saving towards that and
[1:18:45] we're coming to the end of some of our
[1:18:47] savings
[1:18:48] every year we've been just putting
[1:18:49] something together this year we had a
[1:18:51] goal of 105
[1:18:53] dollars and then we had pledged uh 54
[1:18:57] 000
[1:18:58] dollars and fifty four thousand nine
[1:19:00] dollars was placed to that hundred and
[1:19:01] five thousand dollar goal
[1:19:03] uh as of today we have received 32
[1:19:07] hundred twenty nine dollars and forty
[1:19:09] six cents towards our goal i wanna give
[1:19:11] god
[1:19:11] praise for that
[1:19:17] just last month alone the lord blessed
[1:19:19] us with another
[1:19:21] one hundred ninety dollars towards the
[1:19:22] goal so we thank god for that
[1:19:24] we haven't had to use the money for any
[1:19:27] other purposes
[1:19:28] than just saving it for our building
[1:19:32] and i'm grateful and you know i was
[1:19:35] thinking to myself as you know at a time
[1:19:37] like this we got this pandemic going who
[1:19:39] want to buy a building now
[1:19:40] brother branham said if he knew jesus
[1:19:43] was coming back tomorrow you know he'd
[1:19:45] be doing the day before jesus came
[1:19:47] in the field planting potatoes
[1:19:52] so that's what we're going to do we're
[1:19:53] going to keep working till jesus comes
[1:19:56] right and we got interest on on the
[1:19:58] money that we have
[1:19:59] placed in the bank 281.31 that gives us
[1:20:02] a total
[1:20:02] this year 33 110.77
[1:20:06] that has been saved towards our goal
[1:20:09] praise the lord
[1:20:11] and that i mean when i think about just
[1:20:13] the the
[1:20:15] i say this little as much when god is in
[1:20:18] it
[1:20:19] right so amen we don't look at our size
[1:20:21] we look at the big god that's in the
[1:20:23] midst of us
[1:20:24] amen and we we're thanking him for what
[1:20:26] he's doing so
[1:20:27] we have one more well two more months
[1:20:30] that i'll be reporting
[1:20:32] to you amen because we'll come to a
[1:20:34] close
[1:20:35] of our time of what we've done what we
[1:20:38] promised to do for the last three years
[1:20:40] and then at our business meeting at the
[1:20:42] beginning of the year we'll share some
[1:20:43] more information but
[1:20:44] but god is good he's been better than
[1:20:46] good to me
[1:20:47] better than good to me so i'm very
[1:20:49] grateful amen for that
[1:20:51] so i also wanted to
[1:20:55] just say a word of prayer for um
[1:20:59] this precious two sisters that have lost

[1:21:42] able to be their father and like it is

[1:23:05] today
[1:23:07] but nonetheless we'll get started in
[1:23:09] this i wanted to
[1:23:11] speak on the subject vindicated truths
[1:23:15] vindicated truths and um

[1:23:21] the book of john
[1:23:23] uh chapter one and if you would just uh

[1:23:36] then let you
[1:23:37] be seated and then i'll i'll go ahead
[1:23:39] and read what i wanted to read
[1:23:41] um let's see here um
[1:23:48] i'll just read verse 32
[1:23:53] through 34 just for the sake of time but
[1:23:55] then i'll
[1:23:56] i'll go back and read and just kind of
[1:23:58] make some
[1:23:59] some comments on this amen if i if i can
[1:24:03] uh here verse 32 uh
[1:24:07] john bear record saying i saw the spirit
[1:24:10] descending
[1:24:11] from heaven like a dove and an abode
[1:24:13] upon him and i knew him not but he that
[1:24:16] sent me to baptize
[1:24:18] with water the same said in me upon whom
[1:24:20] thou shalt see the spirit descending
[1:24:23] and remaining on him the same as he
[1:24:26] which baptizeth with
[1:24:27] the holy ghost and i saw uh
[1:24:30] and the i s and i saw and bear record
[1:24:33] that this
[1:24:34] is the son of god amen you can be seated
[1:24:38] keep your bible open there to that
[1:24:40] particular passage
[1:24:42] uh we just want to again talk on the
[1:24:44] subject of vindicated truths and
[1:24:46] and i don't know how far we'll get but
[1:24:48] we'll just go as far as we can
[1:24:49] amen on today um
[1:24:52] i tell you the truth glory to god
[1:24:56] um here
[1:24:59] uh just a a quote or so just to read
[1:25:03] and um out of this message jesus christ
[1:25:06] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:25:08] god's prophet makes a statement here
[1:25:12] says when jesus came in on the scene
[1:25:15] and began to speak to the people i love
[1:25:18] that part
[1:25:19] god always giving vindications
[1:25:27] it says uh god always giving
[1:25:30] vindications
[1:25:31] it says oh now just be quiet a minute
[1:25:34] listen
[1:25:35] god always vindicates
[1:25:38] the truth uh that statement just blesses
[1:25:42] my heart
[1:25:43] and if i can put it this way god does
[1:25:46] not
[1:25:46] vindicate lies
[1:25:50] god don't do that now man may do that
[1:25:54] but god don't put his stamp of approval
[1:25:58] on lies god but god
[1:26:02] always praise god
[1:26:05] god always vindicates the truth
[1:26:10] and i'ma just break in just for a moment
[1:26:12] on that we always
[1:26:13] use the word vindicate amen and and we
[1:26:16] like to
[1:26:17] be vindicated praise god if we
[1:26:20] involved in something and you know we
[1:26:22] want our name to be vindicated in this
[1:26:25] amen but but but when we use the word
[1:26:27] vindicate
[1:26:28] i went to just get a a a dictionary
[1:26:31] definition
[1:26:32] and what vindicate mean is clear of
[1:26:35] suspicion
[1:26:38] so when god vindicates truth
[1:26:42] no one should have any more suspicions
[1:26:46] no one should wonder whether it's right
[1:26:49] or not
[1:26:51] no one should have questions in their
[1:26:53] mind as to
[1:26:54] could this be a could it not be i i told
[1:26:57] you a few weeks ago
[1:26:58] the very elect praise god
[1:27:02] cannot be deceived amen
[1:27:05] and before i even came to this message
[1:27:09] i read my bible and i knew what jesus
[1:27:12] promised me in matthew 24 and 24
[1:27:16] if i am elected i cannot be deceived
[1:27:19] hallelujah and i'm and i'm telling you i
[1:27:22] got i'm following a message this morning
[1:27:24] that has been clear
[1:27:28] oh come on somebody cleared of all
[1:27:32] suspicions amen i don't care what google
[1:27:37] can produce
[1:27:38] it's clear of suspicion
[1:27:42] hallelujah look at this god always
[1:27:43] vindicates the truth
[1:27:45] no matter what man that's the reason
[1:27:47] today we can't have faith
[1:27:49] see faith is not based upon the shifting
[1:27:51] sins of man's theology
[1:27:54] faith can only be based upon the the
[1:27:56] solid rock of god's eternal word
[1:27:58] now when they say shifting sands of
[1:27:59] men's theology uh i was listening to a
[1:28:02] brother speak
[1:28:03] you know when the catholic church first
[1:28:04] started talking about the trinity
[1:28:06] they actually did not did not even
[1:28:08] include the holy spirit in the trinity
[1:28:10] it was they said they talk about god the
[1:28:12] father and god the son
[1:28:13] and then they added the holy spirit
[1:28:15] years later they
[1:28:16] they doctrine was shifting
[1:28:19] that's right oh hallelujah and there's
[1:28:22] meaning today when you look at
[1:28:23] denominational dractions
[1:28:25] the doctrines shift but what we received
[1:28:27] we still standing on
[1:28:29] 30 and 40 years later
[1:28:32] look at this he says uh faith can only
[1:28:35] be based upon the solid rock of god's
[1:28:37] eternal word
[1:28:38] that's the only place that faith can
[1:28:39] rest it's the only resting place that
[1:28:41] faith
[1:28:42] has because the bible says so not what
[1:28:44] the preacher says
[1:28:46] not what papa said but what god said
[1:28:49] that's where faith is solid to the
[1:28:51] believer if god
[1:28:52] said it that settles it
[1:28:56] see there's your resting place amen amen
[1:29:00] now notice he didn't say god said it i
[1:29:02] believe it that stuff it don't matter
[1:29:03] whether you believe it or not
[1:29:05] it's still set up because god said it
[1:29:10] it says with such a shifting condition
[1:29:13] as we're in today how can faith rest
[1:29:16] itself you got to come back to the bible
[1:29:18] back to the truth and when jesus a
[1:29:21] carpenter's son
[1:29:22] physically speaking when he come to the
[1:29:24] earth here that's
[1:29:26] all he was known of and the day that
[1:29:29] john when john baptized him god
[1:29:32] vindicated him i like that
[1:29:36] clear suspicions the day that john
[1:29:39] baptized them god vindicated him
[1:29:43] god spoke from head from the heavens
[1:29:46] john saw the coming in the form of a
[1:29:50] dove and said
[1:29:51] this is my beloved son in whom i'm in
[1:29:53] whom i'm pleased to dwell
[1:29:55] the right translation there is who i
[1:29:57] whom i
[1:29:58] am pleased to dwell in jesus immediately
[1:30:01] anointed with god he was just a man till
[1:30:04] that time oh wow
[1:30:07] he was just a man to that time but now
[1:30:10] he becomes the god man
[1:30:12] when he's vindicated he becomes the god
[1:30:16] man
[1:30:17] someone telling me here not long ago as
[1:30:20] as i many times referred to him in the
[1:30:22] shipless day
[1:30:23] that he was just a prophet he was a god
[1:30:26] man
[1:30:27] i mean he was a good man he was more
[1:30:28] than that he was the anointed god
[1:30:31] the bible said god was in christ
[1:30:33] reconciling the world to himself
[1:30:35] god in christ amen now i want to just uh
[1:30:39] uh just kind of uh go back to our
[1:30:41] scripture that we were reading here
[1:30:43] i started at verse 32 but really what i
[1:30:45] want to do is start at verse 21.
[1:30:48] now uh there's a couple of truths
[1:30:52] that are actually being vindicated you
[1:30:54] know what i
[1:30:56] let me uh before i go there let me let
[1:30:59] me go to this
[1:31:01] as we just talk about truth and i'm
[1:31:04] still in my my journey of uh stepping to
[1:31:06] the vision
[1:31:07] amen i'm i'm actually using the quote as
[1:31:10] we're coming towards the end hopefully
[1:31:11] i'll read it for you today
[1:31:12] but uh you know as we just think about
[1:31:15] truth
[1:31:16] everybody got a different definition of
[1:31:19] what truth is
[1:31:20] all right nowadays people will tell you
[1:31:23] see your truth is not my truth
[1:31:25] my truth is not your truth right
[1:31:28] everybody has redefined
[1:31:30] what truth is amen truth that fits their
[1:31:33] particular lifestyle
[1:31:34] yeah yeah hallelujah right so so we have
[1:31:37] a we have a real problem that we can't
[1:31:39] get people
[1:31:40] to center amen on on what god said in
[1:31:43] his word
[1:31:44] whether that's the truth i'ma tell you
[1:31:45] for me i'mma place
[1:31:47] my faith on what god spoke in his word
[1:31:50] that's gonna be my truth hallelujah i'm
[1:31:53] gonna govern my life and i'm gonna
[1:31:55] live my life by what god says in his
[1:31:58] word why
[1:31:59] because god is the only one that has a
[1:32:01] heaven or a hell
[1:32:03] for me to go to after i leave here
[1:32:06] hallelujah somebody
[1:32:07] i'm not basing my faith on what somebody
[1:32:09] else say
[1:32:10] i want to know what god says
[1:32:15] truth amen has many
[1:32:18] um definitions and and one of them
[1:32:21] amen i was looking at truth is
[1:32:23] conformity uh to fact it's
[1:32:26] honesty you know when you when you're
[1:32:28] telling somebody be truthful
[1:32:29] right amen you're saying be honest don't
[1:32:32] don't pull don't pull no punches don't
[1:32:34] lie to me be truthful tell me
[1:32:36] tell me exactly what happened all right
[1:32:39] right amen you want them to be
[1:32:40] honest in their approach because if you
[1:32:43] if you if
[1:32:43] if a person's not gonna be honest with
[1:32:45] you you can't trust anything they say
[1:32:48] come on somebody you want them to be
[1:32:50] truthful be honest
[1:32:52] and sometimes i'm gonna tell you when
[1:32:54] folk are truthful the truth will hurt
[1:32:55] you
[1:32:57] [Music]
[1:32:58] oh my god amen the truth will amen will
[1:33:02] kind of make you have some second
[1:33:04] thoughts
[1:33:04] but actually when that's happening you
[1:33:06] know the devil's inside of that
[1:33:08] because jesus said the truth is supposed
[1:33:11] to make you free
[1:33:13] not take you into depression that's not
[1:33:16] what the truth does
[1:33:17] the truth makes you free
[1:33:20] that's right hallelujah i was looking at
[1:33:23] this and i went to
[1:33:24] uh some some software that i used
[1:33:26] sometimes to get definitions and
[1:33:28] amen it's called the illumina software
[1:33:31] and uh and i got to be careful
[1:33:33] when i use this because i know this
[1:33:34] aluminum software has a tint of
[1:33:36] catholicism in it
[1:33:39] come on right so so i have to kind of
[1:33:41] weigh what i say and what i don't say
[1:33:44] amen it's just the same thing with
[1:33:45] theologians some of them
[1:33:47] i'm agree with sometime but not all the
[1:33:50] time
[1:33:50] even brother branham couldn't agree with
[1:33:52] with schofield's notes all the time
[1:33:55] sometime he hit it sometime he didn't
[1:33:58] you got to have the spirit of
[1:34:00] discernment
[1:34:01] to be able to know what's right and
[1:34:03] what's wrong you got to be able to judge
[1:34:05] what
[1:34:06] is truth
[1:34:09] now look at this they made a statement
[1:34:11] here in this software
[1:34:12] if it's truth it'll stand the test of
[1:34:15] time
[1:34:16] i agree with that if you're telling the
[1:34:19] truth it'll stand the test of time
[1:34:22] right because uh uh if you're lying
[1:34:24] you're gonna have to
[1:34:25] you gotta keep telling that same lie
[1:34:27] over and over
[1:34:29] and then when people start asking you
[1:34:31] questions and you realize you about
[1:34:32] found out
[1:34:33] you come up with another lie and your
[1:34:36] lie keep changing but if you tell the
[1:34:38] truth
[1:34:38] no matter who it hurt come on somebody
[1:34:42] when you stand on the truth you ain't
[1:34:43] got to change the story
[1:34:45] the truth will stand the test
[1:34:51] they use the scripture on this proverbs
[1:34:53] 12 19
[1:34:54] and i want to give that to you today
[1:34:56] proverbs 12 19
[1:34:58] glory to god amen
[1:35:02] truth will stand the test of time but
[1:35:03] lies are soon exposed
[1:35:05] and look at this the bible says in
[1:35:07] proverbs 12 19 the lip
[1:35:09] of truth shall be established forever
[1:35:13] glory but a lying tongue is but for a
[1:35:15] moment
[1:35:17] amen that lying gonna last forever the
[1:35:20] truth will remain forever
[1:35:22] oh glory to god but when you lie you
[1:35:24] gotta keep changing it now
[1:35:26] hallelujah god want to deliver you from
[1:35:28] that line spirit because liars ain't
[1:35:29] gonna make it to heaven
[1:35:31] all right now come on somebody amen let
[1:35:34] me go on with another statement they
[1:35:35] make they say the truth never changes
[1:35:38] the truth never changes when you tell
[1:35:40] the truth it never changes
[1:35:42] amen and they made some notes here i
[1:35:44] want to give them to you
[1:35:45] truth is always timely uh it applies
[1:35:48] today
[1:35:49] and in the future truth applies
[1:35:52] right now and in the future glory to god
[1:35:55] because it's connected with god's
[1:35:57] changeless character
[1:35:58] truth is connected to god's changeless
[1:36:02] character look it's also
[1:36:05] changeless think for a moment about the
[1:36:08] centuries that have passed since the
[1:36:09] proverbs were written
[1:36:11] consider the countless hours that have
[1:36:13] been spent and careful study
[1:36:15] over every sentence of scripture the
[1:36:17] bible
[1:36:18] has withstood the test of time because
[1:36:21] god is truth you can trust his word to
[1:36:24] guide you
[1:36:25] and i love this i read this a little
[1:36:27] earlier amen um
[1:36:29] and nowadays you know we got we got
[1:36:30] people kind of doubting uh
[1:36:32] who who wrote the bible god god allowed
[1:36:34] man to write the bible but it was
[1:36:36] inspired by god
[1:36:39] inspired by god just a man put that
[1:36:41] together no no no god allowed man to
[1:36:43] write it but it was inspired by god
[1:36:46] amen right over generations it was spot
[1:36:48] and
[1:36:49] and i just read this scripture in psalms
[1:36:50] 105 the lord is good as mercy's
[1:36:53] everlasting and his
[1:36:54] truth will and do it all generations so
[1:36:57] if the word worked in my generation
[1:37:00] the word gonna work in my children's
[1:37:01] generation the word gonna work in my
[1:37:03] grandchildren's generation
[1:37:05] we ain't got to change nothing in the
[1:37:07] church to try to keep young people
[1:37:09] give the young people the truth
[1:37:15] glory to god give them the truth the
[1:37:18] truth will keep them
[1:37:20] praise god amen amen another thing to
[1:37:24] say the truth gains
[1:37:25] strength under pressure
[1:37:31] you i like that the truth actually gets
[1:37:33] stronger
[1:37:36] under pressure hallelujah
[1:37:39] they said truth untested by life's
[1:37:41] experiences may become
[1:37:43] static and stagnant they said suffering
[1:37:46] can bring a dynamic quality to life
[1:37:49] you don't really we don't realize that
[1:37:50] but jesus made a statement
[1:37:52] uh the bible said jesus learned
[1:37:54] obedience by the things
[1:37:56] he suffered right glory to god
[1:37:59] now i was uh i was just kind of
[1:38:01] meditating on that
[1:38:03] the things that jesus suffered he gained
[1:38:04] obedience to and how truth is going to
[1:38:07] amen get stronger under pressure
[1:38:11] uh uh uh under pressure brings out
[1:38:14] better things
[1:38:15] it brings out greater things it brings
[1:38:17] out more important things when you when
[1:38:19] you're standing under pressure with
[1:38:20] truth
[1:38:21] oh glory to god amen now i was thinking
[1:38:25] on the life of the lord jesus
[1:38:26] amen he was innocent while he was
[1:38:30] standing before a pilot
[1:38:33] and pilate asked him to amen to give a
[1:38:35] an account of himself just to defend
[1:38:38] himself
[1:38:38] and jesus actually refused to defend
[1:38:41] himself
[1:38:42] hallelujah amen now
[1:38:45] he had a right to defend himself he had
[1:38:48] a right to say
[1:38:49] something at that moment and and i want
[1:38:51] you to know that
[1:38:52] had jesus defended himself oh glory to
[1:38:55] god
[1:38:56] we wouldn't be sitting here right now
[1:38:59] had he defended himself we wouldn't
[1:39:01] experience some of the things that we
[1:39:03] experienced in life
[1:39:05] i was just i was just thinking how do
[1:39:07] you defend himself there
[1:39:09] might have been a different story told
[1:39:11] come on somebody
[1:39:13] by refraining from defense he was
[1:39:16] nailed to a cross yeah i want you to get
[1:39:19] it now
[1:39:19] by refraining from defense amen he was
[1:39:22] placed in a borrowed tune
[1:39:25] amen all this happened because he
[1:39:27] refused to defend himself
[1:39:31] by refraining from defense he conquered
[1:39:35] death
[1:39:35] hell and the grace see had he defended
[1:39:39] himself
[1:39:40] it would have been a different story
[1:39:41] written but because he chose
[1:39:43] not to defend himself he knew what the
[1:39:46] truth was
[1:39:48] but he refused to defend himself he was
[1:39:50] the truth
[1:39:51] amen but he refused to defend himself
[1:39:53] and i i want you to get something here
[1:39:56] because if you can learn how to refrain
[1:39:58] from defending yourself
[1:39:59] even when you know what the truth is
[1:40:01] [Music]
[1:40:03] even when you know the truth through to
[1:40:05] refrain from defending yourself because
[1:40:06] the story's gonna get great
[1:40:08] on the other end come on church i hope
[1:40:11] we get that
[1:40:12] amen the testimony gonna get greater
[1:40:14] when you refuse to defend yourself
[1:40:17] oh church i don't know if we get it yet
[1:40:20] you ain't gotta fight with truth
[1:40:22] when you know the truth is let god fight
[1:40:24] your battle
[1:40:27] oh hallelujah church see the story got
[1:40:31] greater because he refused to defend
[1:40:33] himself
[1:40:35] oh church amen we would have never heard
[1:40:37] of a resurrection
[1:40:38] amen because the man would have never
[1:40:40] amen uh maybe he would have never came
[1:40:42] to the place of actually accusing jesus
[1:40:45] releasing him into the hands of amen the
[1:40:47] the the the jewish leaders of that day
[1:40:50] maybe the story would have been a lot
[1:40:51] different but jesus
[1:40:53] refused to defend himself
[1:40:57] look at this by refraining from defense
[1:41:00] his outcome made things better for
[1:41:02] everybody amen by refraining from this
[1:41:05] defense i myself have experienced a
[1:41:08] personal
[1:41:09] resurrection amen
[1:41:12] you see it's it's something about truth
[1:41:14] it gains strength
[1:41:16] under pressure and see i was thinking on
[1:41:18] this and say you know
[1:41:20] when you're under pressure pressure's
[1:41:22] supposed to produce a power
[1:41:24] oh glory press yourself with producer
[1:41:28] power

[1:41:34] pressure
[1:41:35] glory to god and when david amen the

[1:41:41] make his posts

[1:41:46] truth and the truth that david had is
[1:41:48] that we
[1:41:49] are amen the children we are
[1:41:51] representing
[1:41:52] the living god and they say as

[1:43:30] out there standing on truth
[1:43:33] as to who his god was and who he was
[1:43:35] representing
[1:43:36] and when he went out there and slung
[1:43:37] that rock goliath went tumbling down
[1:43:40] and the good thing about david he didn't
[1:43:42] just stop by slaying him with a rock
[1:43:45] he took goliath sword
[1:43:50] praise god god knows how to use
[1:43:53] what the enemy is trying to use against
[1:43:56] you
[1:43:57] god knows how to take that and slay the
[1:43:59] enemy with
[1:44:00] it brother haman may be building gallows

[1:44:49] claiming victory
[1:44:51] [Applause]
[1:44:51] [Music]
[1:44:54] standing on truth representing truth
[1:44:58] glory to god vindicated truths amen when
[1:45:01] david got finished with goliath
[1:45:03] they knew god was with david and i've
[1:45:05] said it before i'll say it again david
[1:45:07] was the only man
[1:45:10] in the kingdom of israel that could go
[1:45:13] against goliath
[1:45:14] and not die
[1:45:20] he was the only one in israel
[1:45:23] now brother jack how can you say that
[1:45:25] because david had
[1:45:27] already been pre-anointed
[1:45:37] [Applause]
[1:45:42] if goliath would have took david had off
[1:45:45] somehow the head would have came back
[1:45:47] and connected to the body
[1:45:48] [Applause]
[1:45:50] david would have jumped up with another
[1:45:52] rock and slung it again
[1:45:55] and everybody would have been wondering
[1:45:57] what in the world is happening here
[1:45:59] no we know what's happening the man has
[1:46:01] been pre-anointed
[1:46:02] king of israel
[1:46:03] [Applause]
[1:46:06] and when you've been predestinated when
[1:46:09] you've been pre-anointed by almighty god
[1:46:12] there is nothing that the devil can do
[1:46:16] that can block you from receiving what
[1:46:18] god has for you
[1:46:20] i don't care what you go through i don't
[1:46:23] care what you
[1:46:24] in right now you can't stop god
[1:46:27] why because god has broke truth over you
[1:46:32] any time god speaks that saith the lord
[1:46:35] he has spoken
[1:46:50] that would have never came out of david
[1:46:51] had goliath not been doing
[1:46:53] what he was doing you understand
[1:46:58] they would have never known david would
[1:46:59] have never known he could take goliath
[1:47:02] [Applause]
[1:47:04] say it again had he not been under
[1:47:06] pressure
[1:47:10] i want to tell you something else that
[1:47:11] happens when your friends
[1:47:14] see you take a lifetime
[1:47:18] your friends get inspired your
[1:47:22] friends getting skirt and courage your
[1:47:25] friends are ready to take goliath's
[1:47:27] family out
[1:47:29] and goliath had a brother with six
[1:47:31] fingers and
[1:47:32] six toes he looked worse than goliath
[1:47:36] but david's friends were encouraged if
[1:47:38] david can take goliath down
[1:47:40] i'll take his brother down
[1:47:56] truth is that which is real and can be
[1:47:58] verified
[1:47:59] and confirmed by experience
[1:48:03] truth is real and can be verified
[1:48:08] and confirmed by experience
[1:48:12] i went to my um
[1:48:16] greek lexicon just trying to what is
[1:48:18] this truth this truth
[1:48:21] let's let's let's let's let's look at
[1:48:22] this from different angles i gave you
[1:48:23] aluminum now i'm giving you
[1:48:25] greek lexicon and in the greek lexicon
[1:48:27] they use the word
[1:48:29] uh alathia when you talk about truth
[1:48:32] allah fire
[1:48:34] right and and it is and it just simply
[1:48:36] means
[1:48:37] uh that candor of mine
[1:48:43] which is free from affection
[1:48:48] pretense i ain't pretending
[1:48:52] right simulation falsehood
[1:48:55] or deceit right it's a state of mind
[1:48:58] that's just free
[1:48:59] of i ain't trying to deceive nobody
[1:49:02] right i i'm not trying to pretend i'm
[1:49:05] just going to be myself
[1:49:07] and also say it's free of affection i'm
[1:49:09] not using
[1:49:10] amen uh my my emotions
[1:49:14] to try to evoke some type of response
[1:49:17] amen truth is simply truth
[1:49:26] they had some scriptures here that were
[1:49:28] related to this this um
[1:49:31] uh uh aletheia alithia i think that's
[1:49:34] how they pronounce it i'm not a greek
[1:49:36] scholar so i don't know
[1:49:37] amen but uh but they had some uh some
[1:49:40] scriptures here and
[1:49:41] and one of the scriptures that they used
[1:49:43] was a man the woman with the issue of
[1:49:45] blood
[1:49:47] and how this woman had gone from doctor
[1:49:50] to doctor
[1:49:50] trying to find somebody that can deal
[1:49:53] with her
[1:49:54] situation and for 12 years the lady
[1:49:57] found
[1:49:57] no doctor no specialist could handle her
[1:50:00] circumstance
[1:50:01] and here this lady still had a condition
[1:50:04] she's out of money
[1:50:05] amen and just doesn't know where to turn
[1:50:08] but one day it just so happened in her
[1:50:10] city
[1:50:11] jesus christ was passing through and as
[1:50:14] jesus is passing by the lady saying now
[1:50:16] what's all the noise for what what is
[1:50:18] everybody doing this and why everybody
[1:50:21] running and gathering what's going on
[1:50:22] here
[1:50:22] and maybe she's on the way back to the
[1:50:24] house uh after the last doctor's visit
[1:50:27] somebody say jesus is in touch she say
[1:50:29] what
[1:50:30] jesus is here and say say yeah yeah
[1:50:32] jesus here
[1:50:33] so this lady amen was a little late
[1:50:36] getting started
[1:50:37] and the reason i say she was late
[1:50:38] getting started because the bible say
[1:50:40] she pressed through the crowds come on
[1:50:43] somebody
[1:50:44] and sometimes you got to press through
[1:50:45] some doubt
[1:50:47] sometimes you have to press through some
[1:50:49] some disappointment
[1:50:50] sometimes you have to press through
[1:50:52] things that didn't go your way
[1:50:54] but press through the crowd and no
[1:50:56] matter how you press just as long as you
[1:50:58] touch the hem of his garment
[1:51:01] the bible says she came from behind
[1:51:04] and she touched him of his garment
[1:51:07] and instantly the lady was made whole
[1:51:11] amen her touch was so real
[1:51:16] that jesus stopped in his tracks and
[1:51:18] said who touched me
[1:51:20] peter's saying now jesus all these
[1:51:22] people touching you why would you ask a
[1:51:23] question like that he said he said no no
[1:51:25] no no no peter
[1:51:26] i i some i i felt virtue leave my
[1:51:29] body i know somebody has touched me
[1:51:32] hallelujah nobody else in that
[1:51:36] that that that audience nobody else in
[1:51:38] that group of people
[1:51:40] oh hallelujah amen could understand what
[1:51:43] jesus was really saying but this lady
[1:51:46] oh hallelujah church everybody i said
[1:51:49] well yeah i'll touch you no no no no
[1:51:50] you're not the one
[1:51:51] yeah i touch you no no no no you didn't
[1:51:54] touch me like somebody else touched me
[1:51:55] now now not that he didn't know who
[1:51:57] touched him but
[1:51:58] he was waiting for her to tell the truth
[1:52:05] he was just simply waiting for her to
[1:52:08] tell the truth and
[1:52:09] can i tell you god is waiting on some of
[1:52:12] you to tell the truth with no pretense
[1:52:19] come on somebody amen no ulterior
[1:52:22] motives
[1:52:23] just speak truth
[1:52:30] bible saying mark 5 33
[1:52:36] jesus was looking around trying to find
[1:52:38] who this was
[1:52:42] he stopped the crowd and said i need to
[1:52:43] find who this is that touched me
[1:52:46] in mark 5 33 the bible says by the woman
[1:52:48] fearing
[1:52:50] and trembling knowing what was done in
[1:52:54] her
[1:52:57] she knew that thing had stopped that she
[1:52:58] was healed right then
[1:53:00] just by touching him she said she you
[1:53:03] got to understand something about this
[1:53:04] lady
[1:53:05] she realized because of the levitical
[1:53:08] laws and things of that nature
[1:53:10] he could not come and touch her
[1:53:14] because of her condition he could not
[1:53:15] come and touch her he can visit her at
[1:53:18] her house
[1:53:19] this lady say now the levitical law said
[1:53:21] he can't touch me
[1:53:22] but the law didn't say i can't touch him
[1:53:28] so that's why she came from behind and
[1:53:30] touched the hem of his government and
[1:53:31] when she did she turned the water away
[1:53:33] he said no stop the crowd
[1:53:35] stop the crowd stop everybody stop what
[1:53:36] you're doing right now i need to know
[1:53:38] who touched me
[1:53:41] i need to know this i need to and now he
[1:53:44] was doing this for a reason
[1:53:45] he was putting late in the spot because
[1:53:46] her testimony
[1:53:48] when she shared it now he could have
[1:53:50] told her since you touch me you got this
[1:53:52] and you got that and god just delivered
[1:53:54] you from that that would have been one
[1:53:55] thing but it's a different thing when
[1:53:56] you share your own testimony
[1:53:58] [Applause]
[1:54:00] it's one thing when somebody else share
[1:54:02] your testimony
[1:54:04] but it's a whole nother thing when you
[1:54:06] speak it yourself
[1:54:09] amen she said but the woman fearing and
[1:54:11] trembling knowing what was done in her
[1:54:15] came and fell down before him
[1:54:19] and told him oh the truth
[1:54:25] see i mean when we talk about this word
[1:54:28] uh
[1:54:28] alethea right this was an example of it
[1:54:32] how this woman came she told all the
[1:54:33] truth look i i did this i did that
[1:54:36] i did this and i said within myself if i
[1:54:38] could just touch the hem of your garment
[1:54:40] i'll be made whole and jesus i was just
[1:54:43] made whole something happened on the
[1:54:45] inside of me just by touching the hem of
[1:54:47] your garment
[1:54:48] she was also fulfilling scripture
[1:54:50] because the bible said that there would
[1:54:52] be healing
[1:54:54] in his wings come on church
[1:54:58] and the wings were actually at the
[1:54:59] bottom of the garment
[1:55:01] there was healing in his wings
[1:55:06] can i tell you something if you can't
[1:55:08] even touch jesus
[1:55:10] touch his wings
[1:55:20] they had a couple more scriptures on
[1:55:23] this truth
[1:55:26] in john 4 24 amen it said god is a
[1:55:30] spirit come on somebody
[1:55:34] and they that worship him must worship
[1:55:37] him
[1:55:38] in spirit and in truth
[1:55:42] that was identified in amen the greek
[1:55:44] lexicon
[1:55:46] and i want to just go a little further
[1:55:48] with that
[1:55:50] because you know worshiping and spirit
[1:55:53] and in truth is not just
[1:55:54] a church but it's a real place in christ
[1:56:00] come on somebody it's a real place in
[1:56:03] christ
[1:56:03] first you need to understand why you
[1:56:05] worship him
[1:56:07] amen you need you need to know who god
[1:56:09] really is he he's unfolding and revealed
[1:56:12] himself so that we know what we're
[1:56:14] worshiping
[1:56:15] [Music]
[1:56:17] brother we're not worshiping christ in
[1:56:18] the manger
[1:56:21] but the prophet said we're worshiping
[1:56:23] christ in you the hope of glory
[1:56:28] god needed flesh and he's using your
[1:56:30] flesh brother adam say
[1:56:31] this redeemed flesh
[1:56:34] is not housing god
[1:56:40] spirit and truth
[1:56:43] is not just a church but it's a place in
[1:56:46] christ
[1:56:48] however google is a little con confused
[1:56:54] because i i went to google i said i need
[1:56:56] to know what
[1:56:57] truth is i just put in the search truth
[1:57:01] at my house and google brought me back
[1:57:04] some results it gave me 1 billion 20
[1:57:07] million results
[1:57:10] in about six in about uh six seconds i
[1:57:12] think something like that point six
[1:57:14] seconds
[1:57:15] um and uh i noticed here in the results
[1:57:20] that the name of the church was located
[1:57:24] eighth in the list
[1:57:30] out of 1 billion 20 million results
[1:57:33] looking for truth google said the eighth
[1:57:36] place
[1:57:36] spirit and truth
[1:57:38] [Applause]
[1:57:45] i'm sure the search amen is simply of
[1:57:48] his
[1:57:49] vicinity is vicinity related because i
[1:57:52] was at my house
[1:57:53] and i'm very close to the church so it
[1:57:55] was vicinity related
[1:57:57] the church was listed number one amen as
[1:58:00] far as churches that had the word
[1:58:02] truth within their name
[1:58:07] come on somebody no not now google is
[1:58:10] the one that gave these results
[1:58:11] i didn't put that there but google said
[1:58:14] it
[1:58:14] oh hallelujah so i thought to myself
[1:58:17] could it be
[1:58:21] that google is quite aware where one
[1:58:24] will discover truth
[1:58:29] if you're looking for truth you got a
[1:58:31] question why not
[1:58:33] go according to google to spirit and
[1:58:36] truth
[1:58:37] oh hallelujah somebody
[1:58:42] that was google's suggestion
[1:58:46] you see there's another thing here in
[1:58:49] john 8 32 when we want to know what
[1:58:51] truth is and i base my faith on this
[1:58:53] particular statement
[1:58:55] john 8 32 says ye shall know the truth
[1:58:59] and the truth will make you free so the
[1:59:02] truth
[1:59:02] is the lord jesus christ he is the way
[1:59:06] the truth and the life
[1:59:07] right i was just thinking on this and
[1:59:12] i want to go back now and just hit uh
[1:59:13] john for a little bit if i can
[1:59:16] amen amen amen let's pick this up in
[1:59:19] john 1. we were just reading this
[1:59:21] earlier
[1:59:22] truth i mean vindication is is clear of
[1:59:24] suspicion
[1:59:27] we want to clear all the suspicions
[1:59:30] thank you lord jesus john 1 verse 21
[1:59:35] says this uh
[1:59:38] they asked him what then are elijah
[1:59:42] now this is the the the pharisees
[1:59:45] sadducees religious leaders of this day
[1:59:47] they're asking
[1:59:48] they're confronting john with questions
[1:59:52] uh uh wha well i thought elijah
[1:59:55] and he said i am not arthur
[1:59:58] that prophet and he answered
[2:00:02] no now now first of all i want you to
[2:00:04] understand
[2:00:05] just the mere fact that they're asking
[2:00:08] john these questions they know there's
[2:00:11] something special
[2:00:12] about john they know there's something
[2:00:15] spec
[2:00:15] this ministry is very unique right that
[2:00:18] i mean there's something to this we we
[2:00:20] want to now
[2:00:21] they're looking at scripture they know
[2:00:23] that an elijah
[2:00:24] is supposed to come they're also looking
[2:00:26] at scripture when they say
[2:00:27] art thou that prophet what prophet they
[2:00:30] referring to
[2:00:32] there was a prophet that moses spoke
[2:00:34] about in deuteronomy 18
[2:00:36] the lord your god will raise up a
[2:00:39] prophet like
[2:00:40] unto me and here they thought john was
[2:00:43] that prophet but john said no no no no
[2:00:46] that's not me
[2:00:48] let's keep reading verse 22
[2:00:52] they said unto him who art thou we know
[2:00:55] you're somebody
[2:00:56] but who art thou glory to god and uh he
[2:00:58] says
[2:00:59] uh uh that that we may give and answer
[2:01:02] to them that sinners
[2:01:03] what says thou of thy self
[2:01:07] love this i love this this statement
[2:01:09] because see you got to be able to
[2:01:11] identify yourself
[2:01:13] in scripture hallelujah now i know the
[2:01:16] devil got all kinds of things to say
[2:01:17] about you
[2:01:19] the devil call you a loser the devil
[2:01:22] called you defeated
[2:01:24] the devil say you in his back pocket
[2:01:28] right the the devil got all kind of
[2:01:30] things that he's saying about you
[2:01:31] you a fake you are phony
[2:01:35] i don't even know why you even go to
[2:01:37] church
[2:01:38] you're a hypocrite that's what the devil
[2:01:41] got to say about you
[2:01:42] but but but god got a i mean a question
[2:01:44] that comes out of the scripture
[2:01:46] what says
[2:01:50] of thyself i say i'm more than a
[2:01:53] conqueror
[2:01:55] amen i say i will not be defeated
[2:01:58] i don't care how down i feel i'ma still
[2:02:01] enter his
[2:02:02] courts with his gates with thanksgiving
[2:02:05] into his course i'm going
[2:02:06] with praise
[2:02:10] i i tell the devil like that like like
[2:02:13] brother branham told the total devil say
[2:02:14] even if i go and serve god with
[2:02:16] everything i got and at the end
[2:02:19] he tell me that he gonna send me to hell
[2:02:20] i'ma still serve him
[2:02:23] amen
[2:02:26] look at this what says thou thyself
[2:02:28] verse 23 he said i
[2:02:30] see he identified himself now i am the
[2:02:32] voice of one crying in the wilderness
[2:02:35] make straight the way of the lord as
[2:02:38] as said the prophet isaiah going back to
[2:02:41] prophecy
[2:02:42] all right it says and they which were
[2:02:44] sent were of the pharisees
[2:02:46] and they asked him and said unto him why
[2:02:48] baptize us doubt then
[2:02:50] if thou be not that christ nor elijah
[2:02:54] neither that prophet watch this they're
[2:02:57] trying to get him to stop baptizing
[2:02:59] says john answered them saying i
[2:03:01] baptized with water
[2:03:02] but there standeth one among you whom
[2:03:05] you know not that means christ is
[2:03:07] already here that christ that you're
[2:03:08] looking for
[2:03:09] he is he is among you who you don't even
[2:03:11] know he already been born
[2:03:13] he's standing in your midst and you
[2:03:15] don't realize who he is
[2:03:18] let's keep going here it is
[2:03:21] who coming after me is preferred before
[2:03:24] me
[2:03:24] glory to god whose shoes latch it i am
[2:03:27] not
[2:03:28] worthy to unloose these things were done
[2:03:31] in bar
[2:03:31] and that that the fabric uh beyond
[2:03:34] jordan where john was baptizing the very
[2:03:36] next day i like this scripture
[2:03:39] right here john is telling them they
[2:03:41] they brought these questions and just
[2:03:42] said no i'm not the one
[2:03:44] but i know this much he's standing in
[2:03:45] your midst
[2:03:47] i can't tell you who he is but i know
[2:03:49] he's standing in your midst
[2:03:50] if you hang around church long enough
[2:03:56] then i'll reveal to you who he is
[2:04:03] all right i mean and and
[2:04:06] and i could say that because john was
[2:04:08] given a special
[2:04:09] key to recognize who christ was
[2:04:13] amen when john amen saw certain things
[2:04:16] happen
[2:04:17] all his suspicion would be gone
[2:04:21] watch this watch this the next day
[2:04:25] john see of jesus coming unto him
[2:04:28] and said behold the lamb of god which
[2:04:31] taketh away the sin of the world
[2:04:34] this is he of whom i said after me
[2:04:37] cometh a man
[2:04:38] which is preferred before me for he was
[2:04:40] before me can you imagine that
[2:04:43] john just preached a sermon yesterday
[2:04:47] oh glory to god and on the next day the
[2:04:51] sermon
[2:04:52] was vindicated
[2:04:54] [Applause]
[2:04:56] see i i i believe amen like like the
[2:04:59] prophet said you know
[2:05:00] the dynamics to the church will be a
[2:05:02] refilling of the holy ghost and whether
[2:05:04] that's god coming and vindicating his
[2:05:06] word
[2:05:08] the very next day that john preached the
[2:05:11] sermon
[2:05:12] his sermon was vindicated when jesus
[2:05:14] showed up
[2:05:15] watch this now watch this verse 30
[2:05:19] amen 31 it says and i knew him not but
[2:05:22] that he should be made
[2:05:23] manifest to israel therefore am i come
[2:05:26] baptize him with water and john bear
[2:05:29] records saying i saw the spirit this was
[2:05:32] the key that john had
[2:05:33] i saw the spirit descending from heaven
[2:05:36] like a dove and it'll bowed upon him it
[2:05:39] stayed with him
[2:05:41] praise god this is the key god gave me
[2:05:44] when i see the spirit deceive
[2:05:46] and stay oh glory glory glory
[2:05:50] church that's what we're looking for we
[2:05:52] want to see the spirit
[2:05:54] come and stay
[2:05:58] we don't want just something on our
[2:06:00] flesh but we want this to go home with
[2:06:03] you
[2:06:04] something that'll cause you to live
[2:06:06] right when you go outside
[2:06:09] an anointing that will come and stay
[2:06:13] oh praise god amen
[2:06:16] thank you jesus glory to god
[2:06:20] look at it it says uh uh it abode upon
[2:06:22] him and i knew
[2:06:25] amen and i and i knew him not
[2:06:29] but he that sent me he that
[2:06:32] sent me to baptize with water
[2:06:35] the same saturn to me glory to god is
[2:06:38] the same voice it's the same voice
[2:06:40] the same said unto me upon whom thou
[2:06:43] shalt see
[2:06:44] the spirit descending and remaining on
[2:06:46] him
[2:06:47] the same as he which baptizes with the
[2:06:50] holy ghost
[2:06:51] and i saw and bear record that this
[2:06:55] is the son of god all of john's
[2:06:57] suspicions
[2:06:58] were gone when he saw the spirit
[2:07:01] rest on jesus and abide
[2:07:05] to john
[2:07:08] can i put it that way to john
[2:07:11] not the pharisees not not the others
[2:07:15] not not the sadducees but to john
[2:07:19] vindicated
[2:07:22] there was actually two vindications that
[2:07:24] took place in that one scripture
[2:07:26] when john saw amen the the anointing
[2:07:28] rest on jesus
[2:07:30] he was very he knew jesus was the one
[2:07:32] that god spoke to him about
[2:07:33] it was vindicated all suspicion was gone
[2:07:38] but the mere fact that jesus
[2:07:42] came to john oh come on somebody
[2:07:46] the mere fact that jesus came to john
[2:07:50] to be baptized vindicated
[2:07:53] john's ministry and they said i had no
[2:07:57] questions as to who he was
[2:08:00] because jesus just vindicated john's
[2:08:03] ministry
[2:08:04] we got two vindicated truths
[2:08:12] two vindicated truths
[2:08:17] oh glory to god i want to just say
[2:08:20] something here just them in fact see the
[2:08:22] reason that jesus
[2:08:24] had to go to john to be baptized is
[2:08:27] simply because the sacrifice
[2:08:29] that's why john said john say look i'm
[2:08:31] not even worthy
[2:08:32] uh to baptize you i need to be baptized
[2:08:35] of you you're preferred before me
[2:08:37] you say i'm not worthy this he said he
[2:08:38] said jesus jesus had to get him said
[2:08:40] little
[2:08:40] john suffered to be so
[2:08:44] suffering to be so there's a reason that
[2:08:45] i'm doing this you might not understand
[2:08:47] okay even a prophet john
[2:08:52] didn't catch it all right
[2:08:55] oh glory jesus had to tell him to say no
[2:08:58] suffer to be so and the reason god god
[2:09:01] sent us a prophet that told us
[2:09:02] why this had he said because the
[2:09:05] sacrifice
[2:09:06] had to be washed before it could be
[2:09:08] offered
[2:09:09] so christ had to be and and and we just
[2:09:12] read the quote brother branham say even
[2:09:13] before that time he was just a man
[2:09:17] but when he got baptized in the spirit
[2:09:18] of bold on him he became a god man
[2:09:25] something changes when you receive the
[2:09:27] holy ghost
[2:09:29] amen truth you see you've been you've
[2:09:32] been defeated the reason you live in the
[2:09:34] life that you live in because you don't
[2:09:35] have the holy ghost
[2:09:36] [Applause]
[2:09:39] you you thought you had it just because
[2:09:41] of feeling
[2:09:42] but your your your life proves you don't
[2:09:45] have it
[2:09:46] so now it's time to get desperate
[2:09:50] you understand don't just come to church
[2:09:52] and play games
[2:09:53] now it's time to get desperate can i can
[2:09:57] i tell you
[2:09:58] come on thank you brother don't pretend
[2:10:01] don't don't don't act like you got it
[2:10:03] because anybody can put on a show but
[2:10:06] it's not
[2:10:06] time to tell the truth because when you
[2:10:10] tell the truth
[2:10:11] the truth will set you flee
[2:10:15] when that woman came to jesus she told
[2:10:18] the truth
[2:10:20] and god is waiting on some of you to
[2:10:22] tell the truth
[2:10:23] god i ain't got it but god i want it
[2:10:27] god i need it lord i'm being honest with
[2:10:30] you
[2:10:30] i'm telling you the truth

[2:11:03] it can't be no other way it's time to be
[2:11:06] honest with god

[2:11:09] been i've been i've been faking and
[2:11:10] fooling and
[2:11:11] and i i i they put a sign i was telling
[2:11:14] you tell everybody this couple weeks ago

[2:26:12] amen i don't know where i was i'm i'm
[2:26:15] just all over the place
[2:26:18] i'm all over the place i know i talked
[2:26:20] about by the woman
[2:26:21] at the well but what it was that
[2:26:25] jesus knew that her testimony would have
[2:26:26] a greater impact
[2:26:28] in the city when the people saw her go
[2:26:30] free right right
[2:26:32] my god my god
[2:26:35] brother joseph they went free a three
[2:26:39] three-day revival the people said jesus
[2:26:41] don't leave don't go nowhere stay right
[2:26:44] here we need this
[2:26:46] when y'all gonna get to the point saying
[2:26:47] i ain't going nowhere i'ma stay right
[2:26:49] here i need this
[2:26:58] i was talking about somebody else before
[2:26:59] i talked about that woman at the well
[2:27:01] yeah
[2:27:04] no i talked about i went from the woman
[2:27:05] at the well to rehab right
[2:27:07] and so that's not my note so i'm now my
[2:27:10] 50-something year old mind is trying to
[2:27:12] just recollect where where am i lord
[2:27:16] one with the bloody i talked about
[2:27:17] her did i finish her i think i did
[2:27:24] brother it's still not coming
[2:27:28] all right
[2:27:37] it's like this when god wants to speak
[2:27:39] to he speak to you it's not it's not me
[2:27:41] because i can't even tell you what i'm
[2:27:43] saying right now
[2:27:44] i don't even know what i'm saying i do
[2:27:46] know this much
[2:27:47] that we got to get our hearts right with
[2:27:49] god
[2:27:51] i know this much that we need the holy
[2:27:52] spirit to come and abide
[2:27:55] i know that much and if i if i can't
[2:27:57] drive any other point home make sure
[2:28:00] the truth was vindicated jesus
[2:28:02] vindicated john
[2:28:03] john vindicated jesus it was two
[2:28:07] vindicated truths took place right there
[2:28:09] so those people had no more questions
[2:28:10] about john jesus just identified them
[2:28:12] the problem was they probably was in
[2:28:14] church the next day
[2:28:19] john just preached the sermon and john
[2:28:21] told us and the next day
[2:28:27] what you got planned that's going to
[2:28:30] cause you to miss service next week
[2:28:36] see it's time to get our priorities
[2:28:38] rearrange
[2:28:39] shift it get into the house of god
[2:28:42] and get serious about god get serious
[2:28:45] about god
[2:28:46] right i mean otherwise the devil just
[2:28:48] gonna be using you for
[2:28:52] foolishness god won't
[2:28:54] use your body but the devil will take
[2:28:56] advantage of you
[2:29:00] so i i i i i don't even know where i'm
[2:29:03] at so i'm just i'm gonna have to let it
[2:29:04] go there
[2:29:05] there is something that i want to say
[2:29:08] about
[2:29:12] john but lord knows i don't know if i
[2:29:15] can get there to say it
[2:29:16] maybe i'll just read a quote and i'll
[2:29:17] just i'll i'll cut this off
[2:29:21] lord jesus yeah
[2:29:25] my thought is coming from spoken words
[2:29:27] original seed and
[2:29:28] uh i i'm not where i want to be but i
[2:29:30] just i'll set you up for where we're
[2:29:34] going
[2:29:36] john
[2:29:40] because he saw the spirit rest and abide
[2:29:42] on jesus
[2:29:46] knew that this was the one he was
[2:29:50] preaching about
[2:29:50] right but can i tell you something
[2:29:54] and this happens to christians sometimes
[2:29:57] you can be sure in your faith
[2:30:00] you can be certain but trials
[2:30:05] have a way of shaking you
[2:30:09] and john a prophet
[2:30:12] went through a tremendous trial he's
[2:30:15] suffering for the cause of christ now
[2:30:18] he'd already said i must
[2:30:19] decrease so that he can increase now
[2:30:21] he's already spoiled his word
[2:30:22] and now he's decreasing and when he
[2:30:25] decreases he goes through something
[2:30:28] that brother branham say it caused his
[2:30:32] eagle eye
[2:30:35] just to go a little damp
[2:30:39] because he went to prison john was taken
[2:30:43] to prison
[2:30:44] you know after baptizing on having this
[2:30:46] having this great ministry
[2:30:47] you know and and being used of god now
[2:30:50] john finds himself
[2:30:51] in prison yeah
[2:30:55] john had two disciples come visit him in
[2:30:56] the jail
[2:30:58] so now look um this jesus you know
[2:31:02] this is happening that happens like you
[2:31:03] know i'm just i know i know the spirit
[2:31:06] of bold on it but i you know i have been
[2:31:07] hearing too much
[2:31:08] but do me a favor go ask him
[2:31:11] the eagle eye john go ask him
[2:31:15] is he the messiah
[2:31:20] or should we look for another
[2:31:26] the same one that saw the vindicated
[2:31:29] messiah
[2:31:30] is now asking the question and let me
[2:31:33] tell you the reason that you get into a
[2:31:34] situation where you start asking
[2:31:35] questions
[2:31:36] your trial
[2:31:42] your trial produces the questions
[2:31:46] but i'ma tell you he the same yesterday
[2:31:48] today and forever
[2:31:50] he the same before your trial he the
[2:31:52] same in the midst of your trial
[2:31:54] and he gonna be the same after your
[2:31:56] trial
[2:31:59] i'm gonna tell you jesus was jesus
[2:32:01] received disciples come on boys y'all
[2:32:03] you know
[2:32:04] come on have service come on to the
[2:32:06] church come on
[2:32:07] sit down enjoy yourself say well we got
[2:32:09] a word from john okay
[2:32:13] after service i'll i answer the
[2:32:14] questions that you got now jesus knew
[2:32:16] what that question would jesus know
[2:32:17] why they came to church oh my jesus knew
[2:32:21] why they was in church
[2:32:24] so without the service i asked i
[2:32:26] answered the question went through the
[2:32:28] service
[2:32:29] healing line come discernment line and
[2:32:32] telling this one and telling that one
[2:32:33] and this one getting healed and that one
[2:32:34] oh what just the power of god moving
[2:32:37] then after the service
[2:32:38] y'all said y'all had a question yeah
[2:32:40] john wanted to know are you the one
[2:32:42] or should we look for another
[2:32:46] he said just go tell john
[2:32:50] the lame walk the blind
[2:32:53] sea the death have their ears
[2:32:56] unstopped and they start hearing say the
[2:32:59] dead are even race
[2:33:01] go tell john that
[2:33:04] not not i am the one just tell john
[2:33:07] about the manifestations
[2:33:09] because the manifestations is the
[2:33:18] vindication
[2:33:20] and when john heard about the
[2:33:22] vindications
[2:33:24] even in jail john could be encouraged
[2:33:30] because his end result was not like his
[2:33:33] beginning result
[2:33:34] his end result was that his head was on
[2:33:36] the platter
[2:33:39] all because he told
[2:33:42] amen
[2:33:45] the truth can hurt you but the truth
[2:33:48] will also
[2:33:50] set you free god bless you
