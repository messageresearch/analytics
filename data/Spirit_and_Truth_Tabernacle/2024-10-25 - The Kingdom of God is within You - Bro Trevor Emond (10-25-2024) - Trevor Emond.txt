regarding the service on Sunday and just you know just uh encouraging us as we see the Lord moving don't don't don't fight it and brother brandom you know he he was he made a statement says when you see a a man with the ball and he was given a football analogy he says if you're if the guy running with the ball you don't as a he's on your team you don't run to him and try to take it from him but you just protect him try to get him to the goal line you know the Finish Line the the a touchdown you know that's what that's what the objective is and so you know we want to we want to Rally around what God is doing this hour amen and not not not say things and do things that's going to go against what God is doing you know we know we got to watch out for stuff we've been talking about that we don't want things to go into um fanaticism but there's a right way to do things and what we're trying to do is find that right way to do things and I believe God showed us that on Sunday that there he found the we found the right way and he come down and manifest himself so may he continue to manifest uh himself I'm so glad amen this weekend um to have uh my dear friend and you know we were just kind of talking brother Trevor I've been on the journey with him and he's been on the journey with me for for years for years and um and just what I've seen that Lord do in his life I remember when he used to come years ago my my daddy uh told me he said you know my favorite preacher is brother Trevor now my daddy telling me that I'm like well uh that where where does that leave me but I he was saying it because brother Trevor is so relatable you know and uh just the way the Lord uses his ministry cuz my dad comes from a background where they used to make this message so mysterious it was so mysterious that nobody could understand what they were saying the titles were mysterious we had no idea what the title even meant right but uh but but but when you get a minister to take this this message and and just puts it on the the lower shelf so the cookie the the so the the kids can eat the cookies that means a lot that means a lot so I appreciate him and so happy that amen he's here with us also he brought his better half amen praise the Lord sister anime God bless you we appreciate you amen amen so let's stand to our feet amen and let's prepare to welcome God's servant uh to the pull pit on tonight Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved a Wretch like Me amen let's sing with all of our heart How Sweet the Sound will that say [Music] [Music] I was blind but now I see let's do that last verse Oh when we then there 10 th years bright shine as the son we no l to sing God's praise [Music] and when we first be [Music] Hallelujah think about the most amazing praise and worship service that you've ever been to in your entire life how amazing it felt how your heart just lifted up and excitement how how you just you connected with the Lord and just Lord yes I worship you oh God all right Hallelujah but we'll have no l days glory to sing God's praise and when we and how how Glory when when this when this old fleshly body has changed and we're not we're not inhibited by fleshly thoughts anymore yes sir that's going to turn that's going to just amp my praise up that much more praise God because I've been delivered out of that body and because I'm no longer hindered by that body glory to God when we there 10,000 years bright shineing as the son we no Les to seeing God's praise there and when we first be amen hallelujah praise the Lord you have your Bibles we'll turn to Acts chapter 1 thank you musicians [Music] hallelu certainly a pleasure to be back amen here in South Florida and West Palm Beach amen among my good friends amen acts chap 1 we'll look at verses 6-8 when they were therefore come together they asked him saying Lord wil thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel and he said unto them it's not for you to know the times or Seasons which the father hath put in his own power but ye shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you and ye shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of the earth um just before we turn to Luke chapter 17 just a couple of comments they what were they looking for they were looking for the restoration of the kingdom of heaven right that's what they wanted Lord restore the Kingdom right right but he says it's it it's not for you to know the times or seasons and and it's almost as if he doesn't answer the question but he does answer the question he says you're going to receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you and when that Holy Ghost is upon you you're going to be Witnesses all right so turn to Luke chapter 17 just before we have prayer neither shall they say Lo here sorry Luke chapter 17 verse 21 guess I should tell you that part neither shall they say Lo here Lo there behold the kingdom of God is within you so they wanted to restore the kingdom of heaven but where did he say the kingdom of heaven was yes sir so if it's if the Kingdom of Heaven is within you and it's going to be restored where should we expect it to be restored all right that's what I'm talking about instant replay cam this brother right here thank you okay let's just go to the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father Lord we love your scripture Lord we love to be in Fellowship together we love to sing the songs of praise and worship to the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ and father we're we're just glad to be assembled together Lord Jesus we ask your blessings upon this service Lord that you would speak to the hearts of the people encourage us strengthen our faith Lord Jesus uh Lord we're striving for the Mastery we're striving father for that rapturing Faith to take hold in our hearts Lord that we might come up to you when that trumpet it sounds we love you father bless our service now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen amen you may be seated so um just a little disclaimer before we get going too far uh I think it was back in March um brother Jack and I were talking and um I was just relating to him an experience that I had um at this church and something that the lord gave to me and I was just starting to speak to it and I was like you know I just just had this thought of restoration and just started you know telling him a little bit about it and you know he did what brother Jack does and he started going woo brother brother brother brother and he told me that it was your all's theme this year for restoration and so he said we're just going to have to get you down and we're going to have to do this and so we've been trying to to make it happen but um and but here it is you know so if you're if you're thinking that wow like how did he know well we just it's been a long time coming so I I knew the theme was restoration so I just you know glory the lord it's just as Supernatural as ever it just that that happened months ago and not like right now all right so that you can know that um couple of couple of caveats um just as we kind of go through some of this content I I I want everybody to understand uh very very much that though I want to talk about the Kingdom of Heaven being within you that does not mean that I am not expecting the literal coming of the Lord Jesus Christ to take us home with him to meet him in the air I am expecting that I am not spiritualizing all of this in any way I actually I don't know more than spiritualizing it I want to almost emotionalize it but not emotion in the in the in the in the sense of happiness or crying but actually in the sense of the fruits of the spirit in your heart amen okay so I believe those should be restored in our lives right so I and so and and so from that context I believe Jesus is saying behold the kingdom of God is within you um so that's that's kind of how I want to approach this a little bit tonight and I feel like there was one other thing oh and then as I talk about us being in him before the foundation of the world um I don't believe in the preexistence of souls all right but if you can tell me where Jesus died before the foundation of the world then I'll tell you where I was amen before the foundation of the world does that does that work out okay so just cover some doctrinal basis so that no one misunderstands cuz that's happened before and I just want to make sure that that's all very very clear come on is that all right okay John Chapter 13 I'd like to look at here as we approach our our thought together so I like it everybody's happy people are smiling it's wonderful yes sir we have plenty to be happy about amen John chap 13 we're going to start at verse 33 all right John Chap 13:33 and we're going to continue on into 14 little children yet a little while I Am with You ye shall seek me and as I said unto the Jews whether I go ye cannot come so now I say to you we on we together yeah John 13:33 okay perfect a new commandment I give unto you that ye love one another as I have loved you that you also love one another by this shall all men know that you're my disciples if you have love one to another Simon Peter said unto him Lord wither go thou Jesus answered him whether I go thou cast not follow me now but Thou shalt follow me afterwards Peter said unto him Lord why can I not follow thee now I will lay down my life for thy sake and Jesus answered him wil thou lay down thy life for my sake verily verily I say unto thee the shall not Crow till thou Hast denied me Thrice continuing on into verse 14 into chapter 14 this the same conversation here let not your heart be troubled ye believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there ye may be also and whether I go ye know and the way ye know Thomas say unto him Lord we know not whether thou goest and how can we know the way Jesus saith unto him I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me if ye had known me ye should have known my father also and from henceforth ye know him and have seen him so we look at this scripture and Jesus has been telling his disciples you know uh in veiled language and getting less veiled and more concrete that he was going to leave and that that was starting to look like he that meant he was going to die and of course they couldn't understand this they wanted him to stick around and you know eventually Drive the Romans out that's what everybody wanted everyone wanted the restoration of the Kingdom of Israel which meant we want things like it was in the days of Solomon when all the gold was here and silver count was counted as nothing and Israel was the you know the the center point of the entire Commerce and and and of the politics and culture of the world that's right and that's what they were looking for and and so they realized they they felt like they had a problem with Romans and that was the biggest problem they had because after after all they had the the word of Moses wow um and from the word of Moses they had developed a very strong and uh deliberate Moses culture yes yes and they all were well versed in moses' culture and and so they you know they felt like things were going along just fine the only issue they really had was a Romans problem and if they could get rid of the Romans then that would solidify their place again they could just be free people they could rule themselves again then you know everything else that that would be the restoration of the kingdom and so that's what they were looking for and and that's what they kind of wanted and then but then Jesus now he's he's kind of throwing them curveballs and he's saying look I'm going away and they're like who you have a few things you you're I just don't no if you know Jesus but um we believe you're Messiah right come on now you have you have spent so long convincing us that you're a messiah right and so this like and and we know what Messiah is supposed to do all right he is supposed to drive out the Romans all right come on now so you got some things left to do and he didn't tell them this but he's like yes uhhuh that's fine I'll I'll do it on my second coming no no problem and they didn't understand that there was two comings thank God we have a prophet and we live in a day we can look back we see all of these things now right that's right but they they didn't have the ability to see these things and so I'd like if we could just start to just try to put ourselves in the in the disciples shoes this evening and and begin to think what does this conversation must have gone like and how do you think and how do you feel if you're one of the disciples there and he's saying I'm going away and um but where I go you can't come and it's like well we wanted to like but we wanted to keep following you come on it's like well you can't come yet whether I go you can't follow me now wow wow you see you see before you can go to where I'm going I got to go first right amen because there's something I but you're going to come later because there's something I have now that I have to go away so that you can have it later glor am Glory yes sir right sir if the kingdom is going to be restored in you well where's the kingdom now my God hallelujah amen but you can follow me afterwards yes sir sir well he knows what's about to happen right he knows he's going to die he knows he's going to raise again he knows he's going to pour himself out upon his children and then they can follow him that's right amen glory so he says but let let not your heart be troubled ye believe in God believe also in me amen glory in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you amen I got to make it so that you can come too that's right amen amen amen cuz right now at that moment sitting there on the Mount of Olives I believe it was is they're there they can't go to heaven that's right amen there's no atonement yet for them and more than more than just that there's no atonement that they they they their their their sins could be covered they kept bringing a lamb and bringing a lamb and bringing a lamb but the restoration of the Kingdom in their heart still couldn't come cuz Paul tells us in Hebrews chapters 9 chapters 10 that the worshipper once purged still had the I of sins when they well you know when they brought the lamb they still had conscience of sins but now because of Jesus Christ one time the worshipper Pur has no more conscience of sins prise God no more identity with sins they may struggle in their flesh they may up and down but inside of them there is no more identity no more conscience of that sin that sin's no longer a part of who they are amen amen hallelujah amen so I got to go and prepare a place for you amen yes sir but if I and if I go and prepare a place I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am ye may be also glory and whether I go you again put yourself in the disciple shoes here try to strip away all of your message understanding and all of your Gentile understanding Jesus has not died yet you know the the Paul's letters have not yet been written all right brother brandham has not yet come right and you're standing there and Jesus is like but you know where I'm going oh and you know how to get there my and Thomas you know we give him a bad time because he's you know doubting Thomas and all that but in this chapter like Thomas is my man cuz like like he cuz he asks the question I'm like I think I would have been Thomas because I just have that knack for asking the question everyone else is thinking but no one else had the courage to actually say come on and and so Thomas so thank you Jesus for Thomas Lord we don't know where you're going just Lord come on brother it's not you Lord it's us you're a fine teacher Jesus we're just not kidding we have no idea where you're going right now I just and I have no that's the truth no idea how to get there that's the truth like if you Jesus if you want to tell us you're going to you're headed to Jerusalem and you want us to come later no problem I know where Jerusalem is I just need to know that you're going to Jerusalem and I know how to get to Jerusalem so I know the way if it's like Jerusalem or Bethany lazarus's house maybe you know where we headed Jesus because but right now I have no idea where you're going and if I don't know where you're going how can I figure out how to get there wow wow cuz it sounds like you're going to go die and then you're telling us we shouldn't do that come on or maybe that's just my brain and Jes Jesus answers the question but he doesn't answer where he's going he answers how to get there yes sir and when he answers how you can get there he'll tell you where he's going and he says I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me so what is he telling you if he had known me he should have known my father also from hence forth you know him and have seen him he's saying I am the way and we're and if and if and if you're going to get to the father I'm the way there and so he tells us that's me I am the way I just I just love how many times Jesus says I am something and I in my mind especially when he's talking to the Pharisees I always I always just feel like he's always just like I am the true bread like I I always feel like surely he paused every single time like surely he was just like I am and then mine's like finished that I am and then he says you know the true bread I am the Water of Life you know I just I don't know so Jesus says I am the way right the way to what glory to God yes tell you what find the way amen it'll take you to where you're going right right yes sir so what is he telling us if he's saying I am the way and and then and then he's saying I'm going to this place I'm going to prepare these Mansions but if but I am the way and if you knew me you'd know my father so if if where you're trying to get to is God himself I'm the way I am if you've seen me you've seen the father so so what he's telling us here is you know and it's so funny because we have to wait till 1963 before we actually understand or 64 I think before we actually really start understanding this and we get messages like Christ is the mystery of God revealed we get messages like unveiling of God and mighty God unveiled before us and what is he telling us well he's telling us that there's you know where's the quote here here we go Christ is the mystery 1963 that that God he says in the back part of his mind before the foundation of the world world had a threefold purpose there was three things he wanted to do so first to express himself completely amen so so before I even finish that statement I want to say like he says to express himself completely now let me ask you after God created the sun and the moon and the stars after he created the world and he created all life that was in there and everything that's there and he creates the Garden of Eden and sticks Adam and Eve there has he expressed himself completely yet no sir it's been a lot of expression yes sir he's created galaxies upon galaxies upon galaxies brother to ex to express the the the vastness of who he is think about it but has he expressed himself completely not yet come on brother first to express him self completely God in Christ oh my come on until he expresses Christ he has not expressed himself completely all right now as he writes his first Bible in the skies has he expressed himself completely no no he hasn't as he begins to dictate to Moses to write the first five books of the Bible and go all the way back to Adam and everything that happen happed in the Garden of Eden and Moses uhhuh yeah okay right I got that down okay Enoch went up oh man that must have been great and okay I got this stuff down I got it all down all the way up to you know Moses was a Meek man Lord okay if you want me to write that that's fine you know and and he's writing all this down and then David comes pens the Psalms Solomon comes Song of Solomon the great love story yes sir is written right all of these things the wisdom of Solomon written down in Proverbs Glory has God expressed himself completely yet sir has he expressed himself oh he's expressed a lot but even in the expression of God as God is is expressing who he is because that's that's his whole purpose and what he's been doing is to express himself so he's been showing people from from the from the the foundation of the world who he is that's that's been his purpose and so but then the the the Pharisees and the Sadducees and the scribes they pick up this expression and what do they do with it they take the partial expression now at this point before Jesus comes was God love yes has he is has he has he been expressing himself as love to this point yes amen was God righteous yes had he been expressing his righteousness amen was God Justice and he had been expressing his Justice was he Holiness and he'd been expressing himself as holy Glory was he peace yes was he Joy were these things being expressed then someone tell me how on Earth were those Pharisees so clueless as to miss the expression of God as to turn it into such works and such laws and and almost the exact opposite of everything God had been trying to express Lord they got it it was expressed but they got it wrong why cuz God had not yet and God was even showing us that all of these things until I can express it completely and step down into human flesh you still don't understand the picture amen amen but then he comes to Mary and speaks a word and Mary by faith receives that word and it begins to grow in her in her womb and and God comes and he steps that's the created body of God created by the spoken word of God being believed the very blood and flesh of God himself that's right amen that's right and God steps in to that just as he expressed himself in Genesis 1:1 and said let there be light and a logos came out was a spiritual expression of who he was but then in bc4 glory in a little manger in Bethlehem all right the same thing that was expressed as logos and spirit form now is expressed in flesh body form and suddenly God has expressed himself completely because now you can see that everything that he was what that meant not just to the cosmos but what it meant to a human being Glory last I check right you human sir oh God praise God hallelujah we haven't found alien life yet all right so what does that mean God expressing himself in the same form that you and I are in which means that the the the the complete picture if we wanted to understand what God when you express all of this what does it mean to a human being well now we know because he came and expressed himself completely God in Christ do you want to know what the Holiness of God looks like look no further than Jesus Christ do you want to see what the justice of God looks like oh the Pharisees oh we know what the justice of God looks like big Stones bashes people's heads in when they do wrong that's justice of God you want to know what the justice of God looks like huh start writing on the ground my God Amen he that's without sin cast the first stone amen yes sir yes sir you want Justice let's do True Justice who among you deserves to die yes sir you see now all of the go everything that God was trying to express that was in the back part of his mind about I want to see I want people to see who I am and so he begins to express it but that expression was never complete until he steps onto this Earth in body form and suddenly we see all that God was trying to express in the form in which we can truly understand that expression in and so then second he says to have the preeminence by this in his church which is in which is his body that's it the bride till he could have the preeminence to express himself Glory through them that's it brother amen you see now we go back to acts that we read and he said but Power will come unto you and I will make you Witnesses right true what what what not just not look not just like yes go and deliver tracks and tell people Jesus came but what but I'm talking but more than that more than just more than just man age evangelicalism and you know great revivals and all of this more than that be the expression of who Jesus Christ was now in you because the Holy Spirit has lived in in your heart and now the expression of who he is is coming from from through him out of you and all those other prepositions that I can't get out glory and that's who you are that's right and that's the kingdom of God coming inside of you the Kingdom of Heaven is in you amen and that's what he's trying to do and so thirdly to restore the kingdom all right to its rightly position that's it that's it so the kingdom used to have a position that needs to be restored how did it how did it lose that position that fell by sin all right the first Adam back to where he walked in the cool of the evening with with his people talked with him fellowshipped with them they got it all wrong the kingdom has nothing to do with Romans being in Israel or not the Kingdom of Heaven has everything to do with is he walking in and with you praise God Amen have you seen the express and has that expression come in and through you this is the restoration of the Kingdom o try not to get on Sunday's notes so so so this is the the progression that we're talking about we see the father we see that he's expressed himself right we see the father there but but but we know there's more we there there's got to be some way we can see it better because Weck its manifestation as when God expresses himself in spirit form and expresses these galaxies we we we we can only grasp it at who he is and try to take things and and understand bits and pieces but we can't put it all together so so we we we can only know in part because we don't exactly see how it all works but then we see the sun and the manifestation of all that the father was all that that that he could be amen I'm talking about the the potentials the the the the the my how do you express it in words the the power the the the the all that God was you know that that could that could literally just breathe out galaxies now that much power that much Essence is now being placed in the Sun so that all that power and expression is can be there laid inside of Jesus Christ so that you can see I mean can you can you just imagine being one of the disciples and hey Jesus you know you know I I learned a few things about astronomy I'm not too educated Jesus but I I learned a few things about astronomy and uh and did you know that star right there that's this star and it's in this constellation and you're trying to tell Jesus about one of the stars in in the sky that you can see and Jesus is like oh yeah that's reallyy really come on and Jesus is like you know I created about 300 others that are exactly like that one and I sprinkled them through all of these other galaxies that you can the next closest yeah you can't see that one never mind come on brother my God because all that God was he poured into Christ yes his entire everything that he was is now like can you imagine like latent there in Jesus Christ all the power that truly he could say Lazarus come forth and it's like it's like if we begin to think about that it Like H like yeah it's like that was a miracle it's like well yeah to us but to Jesus with that kind of like all that God was right there to say just Lazarus come forth It's not a miracle anymore it's just obvious there is no way Lazarus cannot come for my that's right amen amen hallelujah like who are we dealing with here Lazarus can't stay dead right there is no way and so from another's perspective it's it's you know it's it's just obvious now we look at it and go what a miracle it's never been done and it's like but yeah but who's talking oh yeah yeah that's definitely has to happen yeah yeah yeah no problem Glory hallelujah amen so now we could see all of this you know and and so we can we we have a standard you know we have a we have a we have a humanization of all that God was so that we can understand that if the Kingdom of Heaven is supposed to be restored inside of us what is it going to look like when that happens and there's no Gra grasping at straws anymore we absolutely know because we see him praise God and so seeing and so that's why Jesus is saying I am the way do you want to know the father I I am I am the complete expression of the father do you want to get to a place where you know the father no well then you should know me [Music] amen and then if the whole idea was to restore the Kingdom of Heaven within you because that's what Jesus said the Kingdom of Heaven is within you amen and the Kingdom of Heaven is what fell by sin so now it's within you and it can be restored in you that Fellowship can come back in you the expression of God can start to begin to happen within you yes sir amen glory glory so then the full potential that was all there there from eternity before the found foundation of the world begins to be expressed then begins to be then comes and is fully expressed in Christ then he dies and rises again to pour out his Spirit upon All Flesh then where is the expression then now we have now now now so understand like like we have sermons and we get we get really happy about these things because we start to it's like don't you know who you are you're the Bride of Jesus Christ come on somebody let's get happy amen that is exactly what I'm preaching tonight but what I want you to understand is is what put you there in the first place why that's a part why you're the bride it's because of the expression of God because God wanted to express himself and he's going to express himself in his bride so when so the whole idea is not just cuz you walked in that door and said well I'm in a message church I decided I believe God sent a prophet boom look at how bright I am oh my oh it's when the the the the expression the the I'm going to kick something it's it's when from before the foundation of the world all that God was all of that all of that potential all of that power he's going to take and Express in Jesus Christ then Jes you know because look before Jesus died the spirit of God could come on like in the Jud in judges you know the spirit of God moved upon Samson you know spirit of God moved did this right but but but was that the same that we have now as the Holy Spirit Well no because that Spirit couldn't you know brother brandham said the spirit of the Lamb they kept sacrificing a lamb and the spirit of the Lamb couldn't come back on the person but the spirit of a human could come back on a person Hallelujah and so when Jesus who is God God himself expressed rest comes down he it's like I I don't know how I don't like I don't know how else to express it other than to say that Jesus humanized the spirit of God so that it could come on you thank you Lord amen hallelujah hallelujah so that so that look but again what's the progression start here start start eternity what is coming into you he is all that he is he expresses into Christ who then now you can have that spirit once he dies and resurrects and sends the spirit down to Quicken the life of God that he put inside of you yes sir amen because because the Kingdom of Heaven is as a grain of a mustard seed right and so you may have that little Mustard Seed and maybe all you are is just a little Mustard Seed of that and you don't feel like you're amazing and you don't think you're all that great and but if that little Mustard Seed has been quickened then all of the potential you know how the prophet says I love this part you know how the prophet says you know you have in you now the power to create a world right and go live on it right but of course he says that works by a law right but how does the prophet know that you have that power in you now well well I don't know could it be because Jesus himself had the power within him to create a world and go live on it did it's already been done that's right he's already showed us the way Glory that's right brother Glory so so so then if that's true then the full potential that we see that was in God that now makes it obvious that here's Jesus standing here with all of that power with all of that potential and it's obvious that Lazarus has to rise again then is now coming to be expressed in the body of his Believers praise God hallelujah then who are you Amen brother then what then what do you have then what is he asking of you then then it is not that you just come in like then then suddenly our purpose is so much more uh Rich so much more full than merely coming and just hey you know what live right okay can you do that brother can you just just live right you see all the things like keep your hair cut and clean and obey your daddy but this is right live long good you're a Christian good we solved all that like no it's like and well what else do I do I don't know just sit there and be good all right that's man if we could just get you that far my God there's so much more there's so much more yes sir yes sir Express him if you are if if you decide to be good in your life it's because not because well yes it maybe early on it's because your parents are are are trying to mold you and trying to shape you and trying to keep you from all kinds of problems that you might get into because he gives us the best way to live but but at some point in time that way of living isn't just a way of living anymore but it is actually life it has actually become like no I now I I I live this way because of of whom I'm expressing yes sir blessed be the name whom am I expressing the the one that was there throughout all eternity amen that always was that had that kind of power so so 1 Corinthians chapter 13 if you would 1 Corinthians 13 we'll start at verse 9 [Music] for we know in part we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then I shall know even as I am known now so well you could say well Paul what does it matter how you're known doesn't it just matter how you know that about him but Paul is tying his own identity with his ability uh uh uh to know Christ come on well well why can Paul say then so the as if he's saying so then the more I know him the more I can be known myself all right so my identity is tied to who to to my ability to know him and the greater I know him the more I know about him why because because if if the bride is the body of Jesus Christ if I am in him if my identity is found in him then the more I know him the more I know me exactly right yes sir Hallelujah exactly right amen the more I know his potential the more I know my own potential amen amen and in this age we find so many young people trying to find their identity here and there and who am I you know I'm just someone you know I'm a I'm a I I I'm I'm I'm someone with ADHD or I'm someone with this thing or that thing and we give all man we give all kinds of labels identify Yourself by this label and this this label and that'll help you cope you know that'll that'll help you cope with this thing and that thing and then you know you'll just you know and then you can you know get in front of people and as as a person with such and such and such and such and you know right uh this is how you know I have to live my life as if there's no Bal in Gilead as if you know as if as if self-discipline wasn't a thing as if you know now I'm I'm not saying there's not all kinds of mental disorders but I'm saying there you know they're all kinds of like like we have tried to find labels for all of these things just so that you'll accept them Lord Merc and that is not your identity then the other thing is well I don't feel this way and I don't feel that way and I don't and I just say your identity is not your feelings your feelings are just feelings you know man I I loved it oh couldn't if I can remember how you know brother um Michael Ray was at a at a youth banquet earlier this year and he was talking about how you know like he he made a comparison of bungee jumping you know and if you and if you went bu like one day you felt good enough you know and so you're feeling you anchored that feeling and you felt like yeah I'm I'm courageous enough to go bungee jumping you know and so you anchor that down and then you jump off the cliff with this you know anchor for your bunge jump you know and then what happens if you do the same thing feeling a different way and I don't have the courage and so now I anchor this down and I bungee jump but you didn't you know that feeling changed and so here's the anchor here's the anchor but then you the feeling you didn't have the feeling and so then the anchor wasn't there anymore and now what happens right don't bungee jump off a cliff without the Anchor Man and so if your anchor is based on your feelings and you're going to go bungee jumping that's a bad idea you should should actually be anchored in something solid amen amen your identity is not your feelings your identity is not who you think you are who you feel you are who all this because those things change then then then man some of us are the most bipolar schizophrenic all kinds of things like one day we're the greatest thing ever and the other the next day we're like you know the Biggest Loser That Ever Walked the face of the Earth and everywhere in between it's the truth brother you laugh because it's true okay good like at least it's okay at least it's not just me right so so so you're look I'm going to I'm just going to say your identity is not your feelings your identity is not the labels that some doctor would love to put on your identity is found in Jesus Christ so then the more that you know him the more you would know yourself and so aren't you glad then that we live in a day then where we had a Prophet come along and finish and tie up all the Loose Ends and all the Mysteries to unveil to us who Jesus Christ was to tell us that God had a three-fold purpose in the back part of his mind before the foundation of the world so that now you can know fully who he is Sir amen am amen that's it right because because Paul is saying now I see through a glass Darkly but then now there may be more then from here on out so don't again don't say I'm trying to trivialize the Rapture or anything like that but but Paul is seeing through this glass right but but but the so then the more light that comes through that glass the more he can see Jesus Christ the more then I'll know him even as I am known and so today by God's grace we have the perfect interpretation of the word of God with Divine Vindication the wind of the glass has been my goodness God has taken some wind X yes sir and polish that glass up and you can see who Jesus Christ is and then when you see all that he is and all of his potentials that they now are residing and have been quickened inside of you though you're man you're some of us look hey we we're all there our flesh hasn't figured out who we are yet right that's right right good am drives me crazy amen but guess what me Owns My Flesh My Flesh isn't me I'm going to put off this body yes right it's going to be changed it's going to be quickened it's going to be glorified right glory to God so who am I I am the potential that I can see from the foundation of the world if I in Jesus Christ if the Holy Spirit has come and quickened that life and a new birth inside of me and I have been born again just as Jesus himself was born sir why didn't Jesus have to be born again well cuz he came right the first time you and I didn't come right the first time but the Born Again peace is the same thing as Jesus being born praise God Amen and all the potential that was there before the foundation of the world now residing in Jesus Christ and now then being in you born again who are you I can the more I see him the more I see myself so so so now because of that we see God now now God can be fully seen so all of the power of God all of the emotion of God or all of the the spiritual qualities of God his love his Joy his peace his patience right like all the that God is like all of those things right that were in him before the foundation of the world yes that were on display for us in Jesus Christ the Kingdom of Heaven is within you Jesus Jesus and you think well I'm I'm just a human but I'd like I'd like to ask you something like we talk about humanity and we talk about how you know you you hear the the expression like oh my what a display of humanity and when we say that what do what do we mean we mean somebody did something exceptionally kind somebody did something exceptionally Brave or exceptionally heroic right I mean a dog doesn't help a little lady across the street and we go what a display of humanity you know doesn't happen you know Lions they they don't display Humanity like why not well cuz duh brother Trevor they're not humans well but okay so what what what's the difference between like okay a dog is going to go and you know he a dog might console you if you you're feeling bad the dog might sense some Instinct be able to come and you know snuggle up next to you and but we still like the dog can be kind but we still don't say what a display of humanity no it's not a display of humanity but when someone else who actually chooses and can go oh I looks like you're feeling down right now oh I have a choice I can make now I can choose to be kind to you or I could choose to not be kind to you because it's not just Instinct because I've been given that choice that Humanity where did I where did I get that from where why do I have that and dogs don't why do I have that and lions don't well I think because what image was it that humans were created in amen so all the humanity of God can be in you and it's like that's just an interesting statement because it's like wait go like God wasn't human is he we say can we can we reduce God down to humanity God is trying to express himself in humanity he's choosing the appropriate vessel to display his qualities he created us in His image to display his qualities so this is the whole idea and this is what we're we're we're trying to we're trying to talk about here I want to turn to Romans chapter 4 really quick as we wind this to a close the timer still ask says I have some time but but you all have had a long week I can tell with as interesting as I am um it's been a struggle that's okay cuz we're all [Laughter] humans Glory therefore it is of Faith Romans chapter 4: 16 and 17 therefore is a faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not to Only They which is not not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all as it is written I have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even God who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were now so I I want to take this in the context of that identity as in as that Kingdom of Heaven is within you Abraham you know he called things as they weren't as though they were well was he lying when Abraham said well my wife and I are going to have a baby like Abraham you're 90 it's not going to happen right but he called things that were not as though they were and so Abraham could and and so we look at this and we think about this in flesh terms and we we could say well you know I'm going to call things as as they that that that are as though they weren't or aren't as though they are like whichever it is you know I'm sick in my body I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to call it that it might be sickness but I'm going to call it health because that's that's what my promise is that's what Abraham could do but I wonder about your heart and I wonder about the things in your heart I wonder about your Joy I wonder about your peace I wonder about your patience I wonder about all of the fruits of the spirit you know that you know some of us would you know some of us need to start calling things that be not as though they are like I am a man of patience Hallelujah and we can laugh about that we can say well I struggle with that but but but but hang on just a moment is that any different than what Abraham was doing to say that he and his wife were going to have a child it was not something that was currently Laten you know like like that it was currently expressed in his body but the potential of that was there because of who he was and so I wonder if sometimes we need to start recognizing that the Kingdom of Heaven is within you that the restoration of that kingdom is coming into your heart and into your life and so that so then patience is there in you then hope is there in you then love is there in you then all then everything you get up wishing for more of in the morning is there in you when you want life to be more peaceful it's there amen yes sir when you want more hope it's there when you want more love it's there when you want more joy it's there because why because because it was here uhhuh before the foundation of the world all the love yes sir I am love amen I am peace I am Joy I am hope Hallelujah I am patience I am awesome I am amazing and now I'm going to express it completely yes sir and so that now you can see the complete expression all of that now in a person why because I want to restore it in you amen amen all that he was he poured into Christ all that Christ was he poured into his church so I think we should stop saying well the doctor said blah blah blah this condition and mental disorder and blah anxiety come on it out amen amen amen it has no place no sir and if it's and if you're struggling with that what I would say is go back to what Paul said so I'm seeing then I would say you're looking too Darkly through that glass and maybe you need to polish up your you know your message app maybe you need to polish up you know your Bible and begin to look through it because I tell you what the glass is clean right now the glass is clean you can see who he he is and so if you haven't seen who you are it's cuz you haven't been looking at who he is because today we have it the full complete restoration of all of what his word has meant to us has been completely expressed completely known and so if you want it like I'm not a person with anxiety I am not a person with this thing or that thing or this disorder no I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ which means I have hope which means I have peace but if I don't see it in me it's cuz I haven't seen it in him yet wow amen glory glory a they make fun of me for saying it I've been not really fun of it but you know um impersonated by saying this but I just like I can't help it dive into Jesus Christ I know no better way to express that dive into this message find out who he is look through the glass and know him even as I am known hallelujah amen glory to God this is what it means to know who you are this is what it means to you know the next time a preacher comes and and we get excited because we're the Bride of Jesus Christ and we have a little Jericho March which would be hard we'd have to move some chairs but you know and we get and we get excited well well good get excited but but understand that the reason you're getting excited is not because the preacher by by virtue of his own words and by virtue of that he believes the message has now anointed you all into the bride no you've become the bride by a new birth and the more and to know like that like so that you don't struggle the next day you're like man yesterday I was praising God cuz I was the Bride of Jesus Christ and today I'm flat on my face and I don't know Who I Am Lord and now I'm getting worried because you know which is it my God Amen polish off the glass look through the glass know him amen and you'll known yourself amen amen it brothers and sisters it cannot be that we can live in a day of a voice of a seventh angel and not hear the voice it it cannot it cannot be that we would just we just that that that we'd go back to some Baptist doctrine that we'd go back to some Pentecostal experience that that's not that God hasn't left us there but got it but God came down in Revelations 10:1 to express fully who he was amen Amen brother Ram says here in from that time in 1962 How many knows there's a difference between the appearing of Christ and the coming of Christ it's two different words now is the appearing the coming will soon be he's appearing what clean the glass I'm hitting on something apparent ly okay coming soon will be is appearing in the midst of us the works doing the works that he once did in his church now you're a part of the church by Grace you believe I am a member of that church couple paragraphs later but this is my Ministry to declare or to express him sir that he is here praise God because we're living in the days that Revelations 10:1 is fulfilled Revelations we're living in Revelations 10:7 amen 101 came and gave us seven yes sir do you want to know him he's given you everything you need to know him do you want to know who you are you want to find yourself in him find him find him dive into Jesus Christ dive into this word dive into this message because what what is it restoring the Kingdom of Heaven in you Hallelujah amen let's go to the Lord in prayer musicians you can come Heavenly Father Lord we love you so much it's so good to hear the word of God it's so good to be found in the pages of scripture Lord God and to be found in the voice of the seventh angel that that was sounded in our day to reveal all these Mysteries oh God it's so it's so amazing to find Lord God that we can be uh restored back and Lord and to to have all the potentials that you were uh and that you are are now found in US Lord and we don't realize those well enough we don't express it properly enough but father I as we know the days and the hours are drawing short Lord Jesus um we find it so much more necessary father that you be expressed yes not only for our own health but father for those that are lost so father may you find in US those who would Express you who would willingly father know who you are and to know who we are father that we might Express that Lord when our flesh gets in the way of your expression forgive us oh Father and may we die daily to that flesh and dive into you Lord that that you might heal us Lord God father there's many that need healing in their hearts Lord Jesus their emotions their minds have been hurt Lord God plagued by anxieties plagued by fears plagued by all kinds of things but father the answer we find in you and who you are Lord Jesus that you want to restore that in us oh Father Lord we're unworthy vessels but willing Lord may I be willing Lord even if I'm unworthy may I be so willing that you might use this expression this this this body to express you oh God blessed be the name of the Lord father enrich our hearts by your word may our our vision be renewed Lord to to look into this word Lord God to know you better and to know you more father we're amazed by Your Love we're amazed by Your Word father

Lord may you continue to do it as we grow into you father we love you and Praise You In the lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen amen God bless [Music] [Applause] you bless brother praise the Lord um certainly appreciate brother Trevor on tonight and uh he was just um making a couple statements one in particular is diving into uh Christ and it just kind of took me back to the uh Olympics and how um that was one of the competitions and when you're the diving you actually have to make a conscience effort to leave the platform as to where you are and um you have it's a it's a a a a grand step of Faith to leave that platform and jump into the water knowing you know that the water is going to be there to um it's not going to hurt you you know it's going to be there to um you know just kind of protect you but when you're diving into Christ you kind of have to leave just where you where you were where you are in order to go all the way in Him Praise God you can't hold on to nothing you can't hold on to anything but I mean give it 100% everything you got and and here's the other thing that I love the more you know of him then the more you'll know of you cuz your identity is found in Christ everything God was he poured into Christ and everything Christ is he's pouring it into to us right now you talk about a full expression of God I mean his complete expression is found inside of us all we got to do is let go and let God have his wonderful way brother Trevor God bless you Amen on tonight what a wonderful thought what a wonderful thought amen so much for us to

walked us through Lord What You Did In the Garden of Eden what how you created the Galaxy and Lord the universe and all these great things that you did father but uh ultimately you want to express yourself through Christ and then Lord Christ told him he had to go and prepare Place father and by doing that by leaving now another expression could occur and that expression is the one that you
