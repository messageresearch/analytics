[47:47] seventh chapter
[47:48] and there were there was war
[47:52] in heaven michael and
[47:55] his angels fought against the dragon
[48:00] and the dragon fought and his
[48:03] angels and prevailed not
[48:07] amen neither was there place found
[48:12] anymore
[48:15] in heaven and the great dragon was cast
[48:18] out and the old serpent called the devil
[48:21] and satan which deceiveth
[48:24] the whole world
[48:27] he was cast out into the earth and his
[48:30] angels was cast out
[48:32] with him if we turn out you may be
[48:35] seated
[48:36] you may be seated maybe all that a
[48:38] blessing to the reading of his word
[48:40] let us you can go with me uh we're going
[48:43] to go to matthew 24.
[48:45] i don't want to keep you standing
[48:47] matthew 24
[48:49] chapter and we're going to read
[48:53] amen from the third verse
[49:01] and it reads on this wise that uh
[49:05] and as he sat upon the mount of olives
[49:08] the disciples came unto him privately
[49:11] saying
[49:13] tell us when shall these things be
[49:16] and what shall be
[49:20] the sign of thy coming
[49:24] and the end of the world
[49:27] now i want you to notice they asked
[49:29] jesus three
[49:31] questions
[49:34] they they they we receded these
[49:36] disciples they
[49:38] they had they had they had questions
[49:41] in their mind they had need
[49:45] of an answer so
[49:48] what they did if we noticed here they
[49:51] went to him
[49:52] privately and i just want to
[49:56] i just want to punctuate this this
[49:58] morning by saying that
[50:00] if you have a question
[50:03] in your heart and in your mind
[50:07] go to him privately
[50:11] and ask him lord what would the
[50:14] what are these things this is what the
[50:17] disciples did
[50:18] so many times people have questions
[50:22] and they what happened is they allow the
[50:25] devil to come in
[50:28] and they tell you uh all kinds of things
[50:32] amen and you leave without your question
[50:35] being answered
[50:37] but i'm here to tell you that jesus
[50:40] christ
[50:41] is the same yesterday
[50:45] today and forever
[50:48] if he answered the disciples questions
[50:51] he'll answer your questions
[50:54] he'll ask you a question all you have to
[50:57] do is go
[50:59] privately and ask him amen
[51:02] so we see that there were three
[51:04] questions that he asked they asked him
[51:08] say lord uh uh
[51:12] let's see here the privilege saying tell
[51:15] us when shall these things be
[51:20] and tell us what shall be the sign
[51:23] of thy coming and
[51:28] of the end of the world now jesus
[51:31] answered their questions as jesus
[51:33] answered and said unto them
[51:34] take heed that no man deceive you
[51:42] and ye shall hear of wars
[51:46] rumors of wars
[51:49] and ye shall not be troubled
[51:53] and all these things must come
[51:57] to pass but the end
[52:00] is not yet now i want you to notice that
[52:04] but he was telling them
[52:06] these things must come to pass
[52:09] but he was speaking in the present term
[52:11] on this scripture saying
[52:13] but these things are not yet
[52:16] let's read on he say for nations shall
[52:18] rise against
[52:19] nation kingdom shall rise against
[52:22] kingdom
[52:23] and there shall be famines and
[52:25] pestilence
[52:26] and earthquakes in diverse places
[52:30] i say to you this morning this day
[52:34] this scripture is fulfilled
[52:39] this day he told them then
[52:43] these things but the end not yet
[52:48] he was speaking of things to come
[52:51] but i say to you this morning my
[52:53] brothers and sisters we are here
[52:57] we are here as we look into this a
[53:00] little bit
[53:01] uh we i want you to notice that uh a lot
[53:04] of times when we look at this we're
[53:05] looking at it
[53:06] uh uh uh on on a carnal spectrum
[53:10] we look at these things on on a broad
[53:13] spectrum
[53:16] with our educational thinking cap our
[53:19] ecclesiastical thinking cap
[53:21] but what what i want you to do this
[53:23] morning is is put on your spiritual
[53:25] thinking cap
[53:27] he's talking about wars and rumors of
[53:30] wars now let me tell you something
[53:31] there's many different types of wars
[53:35] because he that was a that was a there
[53:37] was a wars and rumors of war then he
[53:39] said their nation to be against nation
[53:41] then he said kingdom of this kingdom i
[53:43] want you to know the kingdom of god is
[53:44] within you
[53:48] and there's certainly a war going on
[53:52] amen i'll read it to you later we'll get
[53:54] to it but there's a war going on for
[53:56] yourself
[53:56] this war i read to you and revelations
[53:59] didn't start here
[54:01] this war started in glory long time ago
[54:06] okay but this war what it did is it came
[54:10] down here and just continued on earth
[54:15] the scripture says that in in revelation
[54:17] he said
[54:18] take heed uh uh uh he says uh
[54:22] let the devil in satan which deceiveth
[54:25] the whole world
[54:26] then when they turn around and ask him
[54:28] his question in matthew he's
[54:29] first thing he said take he that know me
[54:31] and deceive you
[54:35] it's telling you something that there's
[54:38] a great deception going on
[54:41] there's a great deception going on there
[54:44] are wars
[54:46] rumors of wars many types of wars
[54:50] there's corporate wars there's wars
[54:53] uh uh uh uh within that with
[54:57] political wars wars right now within our
[55:00] own nation
[55:02] one side against the other they warn in
[55:05] the streets
[55:07] they warn on the airways oh my gosh

[55:13] tell you something there's wars going on
[55:15] in your family
[55:17] children against the parents mothers
[55:20] against fathers
[55:22] there's a war going on that's wise
[55:24] against husbands
[55:26] and see who is the author of these wars
[55:30] satan is the author of these wars
[55:34] we're going to get somewhere let's look
[55:36] at something here
[55:39] uh
[55:42] in 1954 the message was preached
[55:48] and the statement was made now you know
[55:51] that in revelation 12th chapter the
[55:54] woman standing in the sun the red dragon
[55:57] put his tail
[55:59] around two-thirds of the stars pulled
[56:02] them to the earth
[56:05] we realized that satan
[56:08] in the beginning set up a kingdom
[56:12] in the northlands to be more beautiful
[56:16] than what that of michael's were
[56:19] amen and there was then
[56:22] declared a war in heaven
[56:26] and he pulled two thirds of the angelic
[56:29] beings
[56:30] with him amen
[56:34] with his tale it says
[56:38] he's not talking about t-a-i-l
[56:43] he's talking about a t-a-l-e
[56:47] he is the father of lies
[56:50] so what he did was he went and he
[56:54] by his lies deceived a third of the
[56:58] angels
[57:00] to believe his deception
[57:03] but see it was painted up so pretty
[57:08] painted up so pretty that even the
[57:10] angels
[57:12] believed him there's a place that the
[57:14] prophet said that those were the seeds
[57:16] of abraham
[57:18] i'll read it to you he said those were
[57:20] seeds of abraham
[57:22] amen so i want you to pay attention
[57:26] and he said nation against nation those
[57:28] seeds of abraham he told abraham you'll
[57:30] be the father of many nations
[57:33] there's a nation against a nation
[57:37] amen the bible says that ye
[57:41] are a peculiar people
[57:44] a holy priesthood
[57:48] a nation amen
[57:52] the nation is in you you are the
[57:56] you are the war the war
[58:00] against right and wrong now let me tell
[58:02] you something right and wrong got done
[58:04] got so convoluted
[58:06] to where people don't know right and
[58:08] wrong anymore
[58:11] everybody thinks they're right but there
[58:14] is a right
[58:16] and there is a wrong and the only way
[58:20] look the prophet said this right here he
[58:22] said one thing he said the devil
[58:24] he said you cannot you are no match for
[58:27] the devil
[58:28] without the baptism of the holy ghost
[58:30] the only one that has whooped
[58:32] him is our lord and savior jesus christ
[58:35] when he hung on calvary went down into
[58:37] hell
[58:38] whooped him and took the keys and
[58:40] without the baptism of the holy ghost

[1:03:31] it it it let us know exactly how these
[1:03:34] things were gonna
[1:03:35] we're gonna take place and he says here
[1:03:38] now the fifth seal is 24th matthew 24
[1:03:42] 9-13
[1:03:45] and when he had delivered up the
[1:03:47] afflictions and shall kill you
[1:03:50] there you are and ye shall be hated
[1:03:53] of all nations for my namesake
[1:03:58] matthew 24

[1:04:05] is fulfilled amen and many shall betray
[1:04:10] many shall be offended and shall betray
[1:04:15] one another and shall hate one another
[1:04:20] if this is not going on today
[1:04:25] if this isn't that i hate to see when
[1:04:27] that come on
[1:04:30] my god many false prophets shall
[1:04:34] rise and deceive many
[1:04:39] he said first he showed you that satan
[1:04:42] deceived the whole world with his
[1:04:45] tales i read it to you again the other
[1:04:48] place he called it fables
[1:04:50] in second timothy amen
[1:04:54] and then the first thing when they came
[1:04:55] to jesus and oh and they asked me to say
[1:04:59] be not deceived let no man deceive you
[1:05:04] there's a great deception going on
[1:05:07] and then it says here again in
[1:05:09] revelation it says
[1:05:10] that this many shall rise false prophets
[1:05:14] shall rise and deceive many
[1:05:16] and because that iniquity of bound
[1:05:20] the love of many shall wax cold

[1:05:29] i i'm just building a platform
[1:05:33] amen and we're gonna show you some
[1:05:35] things
[1:05:38] see because the bible say the weapons
[1:05:42] of our warfare are not carnal
[1:05:48] gun cells is through the roof
[1:05:52] everybody is arming themselves
[1:05:56] they're buying bullets they buy machine
[1:05:59] guns
[1:06:00] long guns and they standing on the
[1:06:02] corner saying it's my
[1:06:03] right people are going and they're
[1:06:06] taking classes and say i gotta get my
[1:06:09] permit i got to get my gun everybody
[1:06:11] loading up
[1:06:13] getting ready for the war
[1:06:16] but the bible says the weapon of our
[1:06:19] warfare is not carnal
[1:06:23] it's not carnal but it's mighty through
[1:06:26] god to the pulling down strongholds
[1:06:30] we're gonna get into some of that this
[1:06:32] morning and show you some of the weapons
[1:06:34] of god
[1:06:36] show you how just how to fight the enemy
[1:06:39] amen in the first seal he says now
[1:06:42] remember
[1:06:44] amen the antichrist is a smooth fellow
[1:06:48] he's smart just takes the holy spirit
[1:06:52] the only thing
[1:06:54] that can figure him out
[1:06:58] now he says here on
[1:07:01] the first seal 6303 18 135
[1:07:06] he said notice trumpets means
[1:07:10] political disturbance
[1:07:13] wars matthew 24 jesus spoke of
[1:07:16] it now he said this is what jesus was
[1:07:18] speaking of
[1:07:20] you hear of wars and rumors of wars see
[1:07:23] all the way down through
[1:07:25] you remember jesus speaking that wars
[1:07:27] rumors of wars
[1:07:29] wars and rumors of wars come on down to
[1:07:31] the end
[1:07:33] now that's the trumpet
[1:07:37] sounding that's
[1:07:40] the trumpet sounding
[1:07:45] now when you get on those trumpets we'll
[1:07:48] get back there and pick up each one of
[1:07:50] those
[1:07:51] them wars and show you
[1:07:54] that the father they followed them
[1:07:57] churches
[1:07:59] show you how they follow the seals
[1:08:03] wars and rumors of wars but trumpets
[1:08:07] denotes a political disturbance
[1:08:14] i just want to make it real to you
[1:08:17] amen now
[1:08:20] we want to look at genesis the 17th
[1:08:22] chapter
[1:08:25] genesis the 17th chapter abraham
[1:08:31] amen
[1:08:35] abraham was 90
[1:08:38] years old and nine the lord appeared
[1:08:41] unto abraham and said unto him
[1:08:44] i am almighty god before walk before me
[1:08:47] and be thy perfect and i will make a
[1:08:49] covenant between
[1:08:50] me and thee and will multiply thy seed
[1:08:54] exceedingly and abraham fell on his face
[1:08:58] and god talked to him saying as for
[1:09:02] me behold my covenant is with thee
[1:09:05] and thou shalt be a father of many
[1:09:08] nations thou shalt be a father of many
[1:09:13] nations

[1:09:19] and isaac hold that thought
[1:09:25] neither shall thy name any more be
[1:09:27] called abram
[1:09:28] but they shall be called abraham for

[1:10:06] thou
[1:10:07] art a stranger in all the land of canaan
[1:10:11] for an everlasting possession and i will
[1:10:14] be
[1:10:15] their god amen and god said unto abraham
[1:10:18] thou shalt keep my covenant thou
[1:10:21] thou shall keep my covenant therefore
[1:10:23] thou and thy seed after thee
[1:10:25] in in their generations it is my
[1:10:28] covenant
[1:10:29] which i shall keep between me and you

[1:10:46] covenant between me and you
[1:10:51] and he had uh and he that is
[1:10:54] eight days old shall be circumcised
[1:10:56] among you every man
[1:10:58] child in your generation is born of the
[1:11:00] house and brought money
[1:11:01] uh in any stranger this is not
[1:11:04] of thy seed he that is born in the house
[1:11:08] and he that is brought the uh thy money
[1:11:12] must needs be circumcised and my
[1:11:14] covenant shall be
[1:11:15] in your flesh for an
[1:11:18] everlasting covenant and the circle the
[1:11:21] uncircumcised man
[1:11:23] shall whose flesh uh of is not the
[1:11:26] foreskin is not circumcised
[1:11:27] the soul shall be cut off from his
[1:11:30] people
[1:11:31] he has broken my covenant amen you know
[1:11:34] circumcision
[1:11:35] is is a type of the holy spirit amen
[1:11:39] and god said unto abraham
[1:11:42] and to sarah thy wife
[1:11:45] thy shall not call her name sarah
[1:11:49] but sarah shall her name be
[1:11:53] and i will bless her and give thee
[1:11:56] a son also of her ye
[1:12:00] uh uh i will bless her and
[1:12:03] she shall be mother of nations kings of
[1:12:08] people
[1:12:09] shall be of her now
[1:12:12] i i made the statement early and say
[1:12:14] well we know he had it was isaac and it
[1:12:16] was ishmael
[1:12:18] amen but he said through sarah
[1:12:22] that he will make her mother
[1:12:25] of nations amen mother of nations
[1:12:29] so yeah we got many nations we're
[1:12:32] talking about
[1:12:33] uh uh of the seed of abraham
[1:12:36] amen and then you got ishmael and the
[1:12:39] ones and they're still fighting today
[1:12:42] in palestine and israel we got there's
[1:12:44] still bickering going on today but see
[1:12:46] god was talking about
[1:12:47] the nation through sarah
[1:12:51] abraham i make you a father of many
[1:12:53] nations but he specifically
[1:12:54] was talking about the covenant amen
[1:12:58] between sarah and abraham amen
[1:13:01] let's go on nation against nation
[1:13:06] now in 1961 he preached abraham and his
[1:13:10] seed after him
[1:13:12] reading from paragraph 84 he said
[1:13:16] and do you know uh i'm in some that the
[1:13:19] joneses live in a certain
[1:13:22] uh that don't have one thing to do with
[1:13:25] it
[1:13:26] god called you and you accepted the call
[1:13:32] and by your faith by accepting christ
[1:13:36] the royal seed of abraham which
[1:13:39] calls you then you justified by
[1:13:43] faith that's the only way
[1:13:46] that that i know of it that's the
[1:13:49] scripture
[1:13:49] as far as i know it i know
[1:13:53] i was a sinner ring god stopped me
[1:13:56] in the middle of my sin knocked at the
[1:13:59] door
[1:14:00] of my heart and turned and looked back
[1:14:03] and i said
[1:14:04] who is it he said i'm the lord
[1:14:08] and i said then lord let me come
[1:14:11] amen and i never stopped and said
[1:14:14] hey lord uh hey uh where
[1:14:18] where you at i want to talk to you a
[1:14:20] while see
[1:14:21] no you don't do that it's
[1:14:24] god that stops you so now it's by the
[1:14:27] grace of god that called you
[1:14:30] and not what you did what you could do
[1:14:34] what you will do if you were the seed of
[1:14:38] abraham
[1:14:39] god spoke to you by his amazing grace
[1:14:43] just like he did adam i'm sorry abraham
[1:14:48] just like he did abraham so you are a
[1:14:51] part of that nation
[1:14:52] amen even though it wasn't by physical
[1:14:56] birth amen but you are about he knocked
[1:14:59] at your heart and you accepted the call
[1:15:02] that makes you a part of that nation
[1:15:05] amen that nations are
[1:15:09] against amen nation against nation
[1:15:13] amen i just want you to understand who
[1:15:15] you are this morning
[1:15:17] amen so we look here
[1:15:22] politics low down
[1:15:26] nation corrupt that's going to put
[1:15:30] soldiers in shorts
[1:15:34] politics war politics
[1:15:38] is at the end dictators
[1:15:42] is wrong politics is
[1:15:45] wrong why didn't they stay with
[1:15:48] a godly king like david
[1:15:51] the great lord of england said this
[1:15:55] when democracy was formed it's all right
[1:15:58] now
[1:16:00] it's all right now but it'll come a time
[1:16:03] he said
[1:16:04] it'll be nothing it'll be all
[1:16:07] sales and no anchor and he's
[1:16:11] right said politicians stand on their
[1:16:14] soapbox
[1:16:15] on every corner and key and all kind of
[1:16:18] crooked things and corrupt government
[1:16:21] and the man and the man
[1:16:24] was right exactly what's going on right
[1:16:27] now
[1:16:31] a lot of empty promises
[1:16:35] amen so we
[1:16:38] look we we see that we can't put our
[1:16:42] faith
[1:16:43] we can't hang our soul on politics
[1:16:46] we can't hang our soul on politics
[1:16:50] there's three kinds of of of of
[1:16:53] uh i'm not sure what to call them but
[1:16:56] you have a democracy
[1:16:59] amen you have a monarchy
[1:17:02] and then you have a theocracy
[1:17:05] amen a democracy we see what it is it's
[1:17:09] uh uh uh one side and the other side and
[1:17:12] then these two
[1:17:12] war back and forth with each other and
[1:17:15] they hope to find somewhere
[1:17:17] a middle ground but when the whole thing
[1:17:20] is corrupt how do you find a middle
[1:17:22] ground of corruptionists
[1:17:25] when both sides are corrupt you just
[1:17:27] find a middle ground of corrupt
[1:17:33] amen now a monarchy is when you have a
[1:17:36] king who makes all of the decisions
[1:17:39] he says what it's going to be but a
[1:17:43] theocracy is when they take
[1:17:46] a prophet's word like a a
[1:17:51] samuel prophet samuel and when they
[1:17:53] always consult the
[1:17:55] prophet amen of the hour
[1:17:59] amen i want to be a part of a theocracy
[1:18:02] amen i'm not a part of no democracy
[1:18:05] or monocracy amen i'm going to take the
[1:18:08] word
[1:18:08] amen of a true prophet amen amen
[1:18:12] so we see here you must study your enemy
[1:18:17] you must know the tactics of your enemy
[1:18:20] amen in this war
[1:18:24] that we're fighting amen we'll look at
[1:18:28] here
[1:18:29] uh uh uh uh go with me to joshua the
[1:18:32] 24th chapter
[1:18:34] amen start at the 14th
[1:18:39] we're going to look here
[1:18:42] now therefore the lord
[1:18:46] and serve him
[1:18:49] i'm sorry now therefore fear the lord
[1:18:52] and serve him in sincerity and in truth
[1:18:56] and put away the gods of your fathers
[1:18:59] serve on the other side of the flood
[1:19:05] and in egypt and
[1:19:08] serve the lord now you see this is
[1:19:11] joshua talking to the children of israel
[1:19:14] after they had done
[1:19:15] sojourn amen after they hadn't been
[1:19:18] delivered
[1:19:19] a man out of bondage
[1:19:22] now he what he's doing at this point
[1:19:24] he's he's preparing them for a war
[1:19:28] he's he's he's gathering he's uniting
[1:19:31] his troops
[1:19:33] he's saying now look y'all we got a
[1:19:35] mixed multitude here
[1:19:38] but i want you to therefore fear the
[1:19:40] lord
[1:19:42] and serve him in sincerity and in truth
[1:19:46] notice he didn't say just serve him in
[1:19:48] sincerity
[1:19:50] because this day and our brothers and
[1:19:51] sisters you got to be more than just
[1:19:53] sincere
[1:19:56] you can be sincere and sincerely wrong
[1:20:00] cain was sincere
[1:20:04] and cain thought with everything within
[1:20:06] him that he was right
[1:20:09] but see god told him that if you do like
[1:20:12] your brother i'll accept your sacrifice
[1:20:14] too
[1:20:15] and he rejected it he rejected truth
[1:20:20] he rejected truth so joshua goes on here
[1:20:23] and says serve him in sincerity and in
[1:20:25] truth
[1:20:27] and put away the gods of the father that
[1:20:29] on the other side of the flood and in
[1:20:32] egypt and serve ye the lord
[1:20:36] if it seems evil unto you to serve the
[1:20:38] lord
[1:20:39] choose jesus day whom you will serve
[1:20:44] whether the gods of your father served
[1:20:48] that uh were on the other side of the
[1:20:50] flood
[1:20:51] or the gods of the amorites in whose
[1:20:53] land we dwell
[1:20:55] but you see joshua made a claim and he
[1:20:58] said it but for me and my house
[1:21:00] we're going to serve the lord so what
[1:21:03] joshua was doing
[1:21:04] joshua was calling his troops together
[1:21:07] joshua's saying who's willing to fight
[1:21:09] on the lower side make your claim be
[1:21:13] known
[1:21:14] right now today where are you standing
[1:21:17] at
[1:21:18] amen do you serve the idols do you serve
[1:21:22] false gods
[1:21:22] or are you going to stand with the
[1:21:25] righteous
[1:21:26] are you going to stand with the lord
[1:21:28] amen
[1:21:30] he made his declaration right there amen
[1:21:33] now in the message
[1:21:37] conflict between god and satan
[1:21:41] i want to show you here
[1:21:45] that uh uh satan has many weapons
[1:21:49] we're talking about a warfare and when a
[1:21:52] warfare
[1:21:53] amen we got all kind of tactics they got
[1:21:56] spies they got central intelligence amen
[1:21:59] and they have
[1:22:00] they they always constantly trying to
[1:22:02] produce a greater weapon
[1:22:04] amen than the other side always trying
[1:22:06] to have a bigger
[1:22:08] something else or a bigger gun amen
[1:22:10] we'll see here
[1:22:11] prophets say we started out throwing
[1:22:13] rocks
[1:22:17] we moved up to to bow and arrow
[1:22:20] then they went to the sword amen then
[1:22:24] they went to the
[1:22:25] to the to the powder gun
[1:22:28] then elevated to to the revolver
[1:22:31] then they elevated to the machine gun
[1:22:34] and now today my brothers and sisters we
[1:22:37] got an atomic
[1:22:38] bomb that was back then and this time
[1:22:41] here in 1953 said we have an atomic bomb
[1:22:44] now we got something nuclear that'll
[1:22:45] just destroy
[1:22:46] everything man is going to destroy
[1:22:49] himself
[1:22:50] trying to destroy each other
[1:22:56] amen but the weapon of our warfare not
[1:22:59] come
[1:23:00] amen we are most certainly
[1:23:04] in a battle amen
[1:23:08] in a ba i ain't gonna say that yet in a
[1:23:11] battle we don't even have to fight
[1:23:13] amen take the war
[1:23:16] he says one general goes out to meet
[1:23:18] another general
[1:23:20] i mean as i said before that general is
[1:23:22] always sizing up the other general
[1:23:25] amen they're always spying he studies
[1:23:28] his enemies attack
[1:23:29] he know what he is doing where he's
[1:23:33] uh uh what he where he's going how he's
[1:23:36] going to work
[1:23:38] because he went over and spied it out
[1:23:42] we got spies everywhere here in america
[1:23:44] spies in
[1:23:45] england france germany
[1:23:48] they all got spies no matter how
[1:23:51] friendly we are
[1:23:52] we got spies on one another
[1:23:56] amen
[1:24:01] now we look at here cain
[1:24:05] amen accepted
[1:24:10] the devil's lie churches set themselves
[1:24:14] up
[1:24:15] as fountains of truth amen
[1:24:18] and yet their begotten children swear by
[1:24:21] them
[1:24:22] and will even kill to uphold
[1:24:25] their error if you think of that
[1:24:30] is an exaggeration this is where i was
[1:24:33] going at
[1:24:34] he said read second timothy the third
[1:24:36] chapter
[1:24:37] and the five verses uh uh the fourth
[1:24:41] chapter
[1:24:42] i charge thee therefore
[1:24:46] before god and the lord jesus christ
[1:24:52] who shall judge the quick and the dead
[1:24:54] at his appearing
[1:24:56] and his kingdom preach the word
[1:24:59] be instant in season out of season
[1:25:02] reprove
[1:25:03] rebuke exhort with a long suffering and
[1:25:06] doctrine
[1:25:08] for the time will come when they will
[1:25:10] not endure sound
[1:25:12] doctrine but after their own lusts
[1:25:15] shall they heap unto themselves teachers
[1:25:18] having itching ears
[1:25:20] and they shall turn away their ears from
[1:25:24] the truth and shall be turned
[1:25:27] to fables fables
[1:25:31] tales lies from the devil
[1:25:35] amen why because see satan
[1:25:38] he knows how to dress things up so
[1:25:40] pretty
[1:25:42] he tell a lie behind a stone by behind a
[1:25:45] nice
[1:25:46] pretty pulpit and
[1:25:49] nice and he tell it he'll tell a lie
[1:25:52] in the cathedrals of gold
[1:25:56] but coming forth he he builded things up
[1:26:01] it's one of his tactics let me tell you
[1:26:03] another tactic
[1:26:04] of the devil one of his weapons
[1:26:08] misunderstanding he will come and he
[1:26:12] would
[1:26:12] tell you that the the if you don't
[1:26:14] understand and and
[1:26:16] and and you would get it all twisted up
[1:26:20] he will come and and just get you all
[1:26:22] mixed up on the inside
[1:26:25] he'll get you warm back and forth in
[1:26:26] your mind this one don't like me
[1:26:29] that one don't like me this one's going
[1:26:30] to sit next to me that one won't do this
[1:26:32] for me
[1:26:35] and get your mind all caught up in all
[1:26:37] those kind of things
[1:26:38] and when it boils down to it it's a
[1:26:40] misunderstanding
[1:26:43] what is he trying to do my brothers and
[1:26:45] sisters he's trying to distract you
[1:26:48] from your weapon one of the tactics in a
[1:26:51] battle
[1:26:53] is that if i can get the drop on you in
[1:26:55] a physical battle
[1:26:58] distract you say for example i throw
[1:27:01] something in your eyes
[1:27:03] now i can draw my weapon faster than you
[1:27:05] can draw your weapon because i
[1:27:06] distracted you
[1:27:07] that's all it is it's a distraction
[1:27:09] don't fall for it
[1:27:11] he want to get you so upset all day
[1:27:13] looking at the wrong things
[1:27:15] and he come right in next thing you know
[1:27:18] he done defeated you
[1:27:20] why because he distracted you from
[1:27:22] watching him
[1:27:25] he got you over here thinking something
[1:27:26] else misunderstanding
[1:27:30] tell you another one of satan's weapons
[1:27:33] of mass destruction you know he
[1:27:37] he he he he in heaven it started out
[1:27:40] because he wanted to have
[1:27:42] a kingdom more beautiful than michael's
[1:27:47] so he come down amen
[1:27:51] and he take eve the prophets say the
[1:27:54] most
[1:27:56] dangerous tool to a son of god
[1:27:59] is an ill-famed woman she dresses
[1:28:03] herself
[1:28:03] don't you know that that that satan is
[1:28:05] the woman's designer
[1:28:10] we used to at one point in time our
[1:28:12] nation
[1:28:13] used to get our clothes and our designs
[1:28:16] and our fashion material
[1:28:18] from france
[1:28:22] and most of those designers they're not
[1:28:24] people filled with the holy ghost of
[1:28:28] them
[1:28:28] i don't know no
[1:28:32] i don't know all these designers people
[1:28:34] clothes people be wearing anything
[1:28:36] but let me tell you something it is they
[1:28:39] are controlled by an evil spirit
[1:28:43] why because what he wants to do is to
[1:28:46] cause men to
[1:28:48] lust what he wants to do
[1:28:51] because see that's that's the devil i'm
[1:28:53] going to read it for you
[1:28:55] i'm going to read it for you in the
[1:28:57] bible
[1:28:59] i'll read i'm going to get to it but he
[1:29:01] what he wants to do is destroy
[1:29:05] he wants to destroy you with those kind
[1:29:07] of things
[1:29:08] let me tell you something i've been
[1:29:11] right here
[1:29:13] right here in the church and people
[1:29:17] have come to me and asked
[1:29:20] to be moved can i sit somewhere else
[1:29:23] because i don't want to be distracted
[1:29:25] with what this person is wearing
[1:29:27] in front of me
[1:29:31] watch how you dress when you come to
[1:29:32] church
[1:29:35] don't let the devil use you
[1:29:38] modesty modesty

[1:29:55] wearing it out yeah

[1:45:09] he never misses amen
[1:45:16] took the weapon amen
[1:45:19] and defeated the enemy amen
[1:45:23] another weapon that god gave us to our
[1:45:26] disposal
[1:45:28] amen he gave us prayer
[1:45:31] he gave us the word of god
[1:45:34] he gave us love
[1:45:37] he gave us love the prophet said is one
[1:45:40] of the most greatest weapons ever given
[1:45:43] he gave us love
[1:45:46] thinking about the prophet when he came
[1:45:48] across that killer bull
[1:45:52] he was going over to do the work of the
[1:45:53] lord he had to remember that the brother
[1:45:56] over there needed prayer
[1:45:58] but he said i'll just go across this
[1:45:59] bull go across this field
[1:46:01] and he forgot that this killer bull that
[1:46:04] had killed
[1:46:05] a colored fella uh or someone and they
[1:46:08] had bought the bull and the bill
[1:46:09] bull was in that field now this bull was
[1:46:12] a trained
[1:46:14] murderer he had killed before
[1:46:20] so the prophet is going on across the
[1:46:22] field and he got within
[1:46:24] feet of the bull
[1:46:28] and the bull stood up he immediately
[1:46:31] looked
[1:46:32] for a tree the tree was too far away
[1:46:34] he'll never make it
[1:46:36] he reached for his carnal weapon
[1:46:41] and realize he had left it in the car he
[1:46:43] said god did that
[1:46:46] because he had to build his faith
[1:46:48] muscles
[1:46:51] so you leave your whip in the car so he
[1:46:53] became mr bull
[1:46:56] i'm so sorry to disturb you
[1:47:00] you are creature of god as am i
[1:47:04] i am following the will of the lord to
[1:47:06] go over and pray for another creature
[1:47:08] of god if you'll allow me to pass
[1:47:13] when love projects
[1:47:17] grace sovereign grace
[1:47:20] takes over
[1:47:25] when love projects we just read
[1:47:29] quote out the core that what devil is
[1:47:32] doing at this time
[1:47:34] the love of many a wax coal but there's
[1:47:37] nation against nation
[1:47:39] but this nation we fight with love
[1:47:44] amen love is in our arsenal
[1:47:47] it is so different to what what what the
[1:47:50] other nations are doing
[1:47:52] amen that's why we're hated
[1:47:55] a hated nation amen
[1:47:58] so therefore we see that love
[1:48:02] is one of the weapons that god gave us
[1:48:04] another weapon
[1:48:06] that god gave us to our disposal amen
[1:48:10] is confession and committal
[1:48:14] confession and committal
[1:48:17] when you confess your faults come humbly
[1:48:20] before the lord
[1:48:21] and confess your faults and you can
[1:48:24] commit whatever you're going through
[1:48:26] into the hands of god he said that i can
[1:48:29] read it let me read
[1:48:32] let me read this he said that's the
[1:48:33] greatest weapon
[1:48:35] amen
[1:48:41] at thy word 1954 1207.
[1:48:46] only by your confession can you be saved
[1:48:49] that is the most powerful weapon
[1:48:52] that god put in the hand of man
[1:48:56] is a committal and a confession
[1:49:00] it'll do every time if you believe it
[1:49:03] accept it on those bases and believe it
[1:49:07] and stay
[1:49:08] with it keep confessing it
[1:49:11] when you confess it in other words the
[1:49:14] devil is always
[1:49:15] he'll
[1:49:19] john ryan came through the prayer line
[1:49:23] and was prayed for he was blind
[1:49:26] amen but his healing didn't happen right
[1:49:30] away
[1:49:31] but john ryan kept confessing it thank
[1:49:34] god i can see
[1:49:36] thank god i can see he's sitting in the
[1:49:39] barber chair
[1:49:41] thank god i can see people thought he
[1:49:43] was going crazy losing his mind what are
[1:49:45] you talking about man you still
[1:49:46] blind as a bad he said i thank god i can
[1:49:49] see
[1:49:50] his confession amen all of a sudden his
[1:49:53] eyes
[1:49:54] popped open and he ran at the bible shop
[1:49:57] still with foam on his face and the
[1:49:59] thing around him and running and said
[1:50:00] thank god i can see i can see
[1:50:03] i can see
[1:50:06] his confession if you
[1:50:09] have a misunderstanding because see
[1:50:12] we're talking about a natural
[1:50:14] eyes of seeing but see what we're really
[1:50:16] talking about is a spiritual opening of
[1:50:19] your eyes of understanding
[1:50:20] amen if you're confused if you have
[1:50:23] questions go
[1:50:24] to them and keep confessing i can see
[1:50:27] keep confessing i can see keep
[1:50:30] confessing i can see
[1:50:31] and one day your eyes will pop over
[1:50:38] you have to do is ask i want to know
[1:50:39] true there has to be a hunger and a
[1:50:41] thirst for righteousness
[1:50:43] he said if you all do that hunger and
[1:50:45] things for righteousness shall be full
[1:50:48] amen we talk about a lot of these things
[1:50:49] on a natural basis but put your
[1:50:50] spiritual thinking caps on
[1:50:53] amen confession
[1:50:57] and commitment now there's a perfect way
[1:51:00] in a permissive way
[1:51:02] and i feel that if god had on the
[1:51:05] platform can
[1:51:06] show me things that has been and in my
[1:51:10] room and so forth he's able to tell me
[1:51:13] just where he wants me
[1:51:17] and what he wants me to do but if
[1:51:21] but i feel as long as i
[1:51:24] got it all hooked up i have it all
[1:51:29] i feel like then he won't put his hands
[1:51:33] on it
[1:51:34] as long as i'm doing it
[1:51:39] should i read that again
[1:51:43] he want me to do but i feel
[1:51:46] as long as i've got it all hooked up
[1:51:51] or i feel like then
[1:51:54] he won't put his hands on it
[1:51:57] as long as i'm doing it in other words
[1:52:01] committed to him david
[1:52:04] when he slung his slingshot once that
[1:52:08] that rock left that sling he committed
[1:52:10] to the lord
[1:52:12] and said well lord now it's up to you
[1:52:14] i've done my part
[1:52:16] i'm leaving in your hands and i'ma go on
[1:52:20] loading the next rock amen
[1:52:23] loading the next rock and that's the way
[1:52:26] it is with anything
[1:52:27] as long as you're going to do it if
[1:52:29] someone talks about you
[1:52:32] and you talk back about them god can't
[1:52:34] fight your battle
[1:52:38] if you're fighting it yourself just let
[1:52:42] loose and let him do it

[1:56:36] amen 15.
[1:56:40] but when they had commanded them to go
[1:56:43] aside
[1:56:46] out of the country they conferred among
[1:56:49] themselves saying what shall we do
[1:56:53] with these men see
[1:56:56] the the the the sadducees and the
[1:56:59] pharisees and things they were
[1:57:00] they was upset because they were
[1:57:02] preaching about jesus
[1:57:05] he says uh but they spread no further
[1:57:08] among the people
[1:57:10] let us straightly threaten them
[1:57:13] that they speak henceforth to no man
[1:57:17] in this name they are putting
[1:57:20] pressure on the saints of god you bet
[1:57:24] not say the name of jesus that's what
[1:57:27] they saying man
[1:57:28] you bet not say the name of jesus
[1:57:32] say it again we gonna do something to
[1:57:34] you
[1:57:36] and peter and john answered and said
[1:57:38] unto them
[1:57:40] whether it be right in the sight of god
[1:57:43] to hearken unto you
[1:57:45] more than to god judge ye
[1:57:48] for we cannot speak the things
[1:57:51] which we have seen seen and heard
[1:57:55] we cannot but speak the things which we
[1:57:58] have seen and heard
[1:58:00] so when they had further threatened them
[1:58:03] they let them go finding nothing
[1:58:07] how they might punish them
[1:58:10] because of the people for all men
[1:58:13] glorified
[1:58:14] god for which for that which was done
[1:58:18] for the man was above 40 years old
[1:58:21] and whom this miracle of healing was
[1:58:24] shown
[1:58:25] and being let go he went to
[1:58:28] uh their own company and reported

[1:58:34] elders
[1:58:35] had said unto them
[1:58:38] spies amen
[1:58:42] every good war happened and when they
[1:58:45] heard that

[1:58:50] one accord
[1:58:51] and said lord thou art god
[1:58:55] which has made heaven and earth and the
[1:58:58] sea
[1:58:59] and all that in that is in them
[1:59:03] by whom mouth and thy servant david has
