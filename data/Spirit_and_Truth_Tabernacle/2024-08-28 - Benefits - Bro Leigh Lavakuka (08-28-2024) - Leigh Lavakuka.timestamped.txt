[9:22] back in the house of the
[9:24] Lord um once more and uh I was
[9:29] contemplating whether we would have the
[9:32] service tonight after such a
[9:35] weekend uh but uh when I was talking to
[9:38] brother Lee and realized that he didn't
[9:41] fly home until tomorrow and I'm like
[9:44] well my if he's going to be here that
[9:45] long we need to have a service and we
[9:47] need to have brother Lee preach for us
[9:50] uh his first time uh in the US and uh he
[9:54] came for um these um the meetings the um
[9:59] uh his wife precious wife two daughters
[10:01] some of the Saints from the church uh
[10:04] you know came along with them and we're
[10:06] so happy to have you all with us Amen on
[10:10] tonight amen uh so I won't take too much
[10:14] time I'll just go through the
[10:15] announcements and that way we'll have
[10:17] brother Lee come uh shortly uh so Sunday
[10:20] don't forget we'll have uh prayer from
[10:22] 9: to 10 and then the service will start
[10:25] at 10:30 uh Sunday school um from 9:30
[10:29] 10 uh for our youth and young adults and
[10:32] our streaming continues through Twitter
[10:34] Facebook and our church website I wanted
[10:38] to make mention that um so we we
[10:41] streamed the night of
[10:43] worship um and the service on Sunday and
[10:46] that is currently on you can find it on
[10:50] on our Facebook Channel sat
[10:53] Tabernacle however over the weekend we
[10:56] will be um kind of taking it down
[10:58] temporarily the the brothers want to
[11:00] make some edits to the video in order to
[11:03] improve uh just the quality of it and uh
[11:07] you know so they ask that we just kind
[11:08] of take it down so you'll see it go away
[11:11] for a few weeks so I I would I would
[11:13] suggest that if you want to see it
[11:16] relive The Experience try to do it over
[11:18] the next couple days because it will go
[11:20] down temporarily until we get the edits
[11:23] done uh so keep that in mind also uh we
[11:27] have the combined service coming up uh
[11:30] in Miami September 29th that's going to
[11:32] be at Eagles temple with uh brother
[11:34] Bernard so uh keep that that service in
[11:37] mind as well um and our
[11:41] giving is uh online Zale cash app or
[11:45] PayPal zel is the preferred giving
[11:47] method s simply because cash app and
[11:49] PayPal takes fees uh from the giving so

[15:04] rich like
[15:08] [Music]
[15:13] me was
[15:18] lost
[15:24] now was blind
[15:29] but
[15:32] now I
[15:35] see amen God bless you brothers and
[15:37] sisters
[15:40] [Applause]
[15:41] amen God bless
[15:44] you so good to be in the United States
[15:48] and it's my first trip outside of
[15:51] Australia as a minister of the gospel
[15:54] and it's always challenging and it's
[15:56] always nervous that's why I don't like
[15:58] to travel when I see a elder or senior
[16:01] that comes down H I take full advantage
[16:04] of it and um you know you don't know how
[16:08] precious brother Jack is I um you may
[16:11] have your seats I take Liberty th this
[16:15] evening um because how I got to know
[16:18] brother Jack was for a sister that we
[16:22] had seen and we were just overwhelmed on
[16:26] her
[16:27] product Propet of God said you let the
[16:30] product sell itself and so when Brenda
[16:36] Lewis I was looking up on YouTube I saw
[16:39] Mahalia Jackson arita
[16:43] Franklin and then I saw this little lady
[16:46] all right on a record cover Brenda Lewis
[16:49] yeah well I hadn't heard of Brenda Lewis
[16:51] so I just tapped it on and lo and behold
[16:54] I heard the song it's already done and I
[16:58] I knew Cloverdale had sung that song I
[17:01] Knew Cloverdale I said nah that's
[17:04] Cloverdale so I got a little bit more no
[17:07] nosy so I saw Jack's mom you know say
[17:12] Thumbs Up Click on so I clicked on roses
[17:15] yeah and and from there I
[17:18] saw brother
[17:20] Wesco now brother Wesco was in the
[17:23] service and they were having some
[17:24] meetings and I believe you were all
[17:26] there because brother Jack was there and
[17:28] so when brother Jack sung the song
[17:33] speak into the app that was my favorite
[17:36] song at that time and I said no they
[17:39] can't be right I I'm hearing something
[17:42] that you know I'm not accustomed to
[17:44] because back home we grew up on you know
[17:47] the traditional gospel singers and
[17:49] there's nothing wrong with them but
[17:51] that's how we grew up on and I showed
[17:53] brother Molly and brother mly goes you
[17:55] sure I said well there's a tall brother
[17:58] and there's brother brother Brandon
[17:59] they're a message
[18:01] Church they have to be a message church
[18:04] and um so we we this and I say this this
[18:08] is the only time we said I wish and
[18:11] brother M and I said I wish we could
[18:14] have him over here and lo and behold
[18:17] Joseph chosi yeah started the ball
[18:20] running that's right but Brenda Lewis
[18:22] put the seed in and even beyond the
[18:26] grave she put the seed in and that's why
[18:29] I always encourage and I always say to
[18:32] our young ones you learn from your
[18:34] elders right you learn the trade from
[18:37] the elders because the elders have set
[18:39] the path for each and every one of us
[18:42] and sometimes we disrespect them because
[18:44] they say they're oldfashioned all right
[18:47] but brother Bram said it's the oldtime
[18:49] Holy Spirit and the devil won't go near
[18:51] it that's why he fears it but for us we
[18:55] don't fear anything of God because we
[18:58] are all the Hallelujah so when we hear
[19:01] that same song and we hear that same
[19:03] message we can't help but say Amen to
[19:07] every time we hear because it's a part
[19:09] of our DNA so when we gather together as
[19:13] Believers and understand that Jesus
[19:15] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[19:18] forever it can never change it don't
[19:21] matter if you're in New Zealand it don't
[19:23] matter if you're in America it don't
[19:25] matter if you're in Zimbabwe the same
[19:28] God is still the same yesterday today
[19:32] and
[19:33] [Applause]
[19:35] forever now that's the sister that sung
[19:38] a song All Right singing heals amen
[19:42] singing protects you we're afraid to
[19:45] sing because we're afraid of what might
[19:48] happen in our lives it might get exposed
[19:51] all right all right yes sir Prophet said
[19:55] you leap as high as you love all right
[19:58] there too many leapers that ain't living
[20:00] the right life but you don't have to
[20:03] stay in that condition you don't have to
[20:06] stay in that same place all you need is
[20:09] the Holy Ghost and Fire and it'll keep
[20:12] you
[20:14] alive Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday
[20:19] Friday 7 day
[20:22] week praise God he ain't a dead God Amen
[20:26] he's a living God yes he is yes so when
[20:29] we heard and brother
[20:32] chosi brother Wesco came yes now we call
[20:35] him Papa Wesco all right so that's the
[20:38] reason partly why we're here cuz his
[20:43] boy that's right he said he told me he
[20:47] isn't too
[20:49] well now they didn't give me too much
[20:51] information but I don't need
[20:53] that I just said is he well yeah he said
[20:57] he's well
[20:59] and so we came and and we that's why
[21:02] we're here and the girls said why don't
[21:05] we go with the
[21:09] concert brother Jack left Australia his
[21:13] last favorite words in
[21:14] 2019 double
[21:19] double you know when he said that double
[21:22] double Melbourne went down for two years
[21:25] under Co
[21:30] oh so they came over and we had the
[21:34] concert and I'd have to say that was
[21:37] that was something that was
[21:40] [Applause]
[21:42] something I like to say God bless you
[21:44] young men and it's good to see you and
[21:47] when I stream and sometimes I have a
[21:50] peeky poo and have a look at brother
[21:52] Jack and you know I sometimes hear how
[21:55] brother Jack say you know when young
[21:57] ministers want to come they ring him up
[21:59] they want to preach here you know how
[22:01] brother Jack feels I said praise God I
[22:04] might get under that
[22:06] radar and I got a shock when he rung me
[22:09] up but I always see the young
[22:13] man you know it's going to take the
[22:15] young men yes sir amen and and you you
[22:19] keep pressing on it does it gives me joy
[22:22] one soul and when brother Jack La left
[22:26] last year we we had three marri
[22:28] marriages straight after it and you know
[22:32] these were young men young men that were
[22:35] that weren't Christians they don't have
[22:37] a family Christian background these are
[22:40] three men that were born under Catholic
[22:42] in influence one young man is a Chinese
[22:46] but straight after the service one of
[22:49] the brothers said I need to get married
[22:52] I said wow that that's good that's good
[22:55] he felt a conviction amen he wanted to
[22:58] get married and I and I always encourage
[23:00] young people if you you get married
[23:03] don't leave it too long so one the first
[23:06] brother he didn't take too long he took
[23:09] one
[23:10] month gave me one month to prepare my
[23:14] God now his brother was no better he
[23:16] gave me one day
[23:18] wow and then when brother Gabriel he
[23:20] gave me two weeks God so I gave a
[23:23] warning I said Brothers give me time to
[23:26] be able to prepare myself
[23:29] so you know when you have a Revival yes
[23:32] and the prophet God said you need a
[23:34] killing to have a Revival that's what he
[23:37] said now these boys had a killing they
[23:41] at the meeting they said those was the
[23:42] best meetings they've ever gone
[23:45] to the best meetings they have ever gone
[23:48] to in their whole life and they're just
[23:50] young menow and straight away the first
[23:52] thing they want to do is getting married
[23:54] wow wow and two sisters Three Sisters
[23:57] had been there had been waiting and they
[23:59] got
[24:00] married so this is the marriage amen

[24:06] the land sir but you got to be married
[24:08] right here hallelujah don't let no
[24:11] nothing discourage you my God don't let
[24:14] uh other things discourage you and

[27:12] going to read to 1 to 17 but I just feel
[27:15] to read from 1 to
[27:16] three it says he bless the Lord oh my
[27:21] soul and all that is within me bless His
[27:24] holy name bless the Lord all my soul
[27:27] forget and forget not all his benefits
[27:30] yes sir who forgiveth all thy iniquities
[27:34] and health all thy diseases you may have
[27:37] your seats turn your brother and sister
[27:38] and say God bless you and welcome one
[27:41] another again
[27:43] amen God bless
[27:48] amen
[27:50] Lord hallelujah
[27:59] amen the scripture says here bless the
[28:02] Lord oh my soul and I I certainly
[28:04] believe that sometimes we feel like that
[28:07] as Brother David did you know to bless
[28:09] the Lord all my soul and his and he's a
[28:12] holy God and and we should never ever
[28:14] forget all his benefits that he bestows
[28:17] upon us and many times we we do forget
[28:20] because we as we've had Co for two years
[28:22] and one Minister say we we shouldn't be
[28:25] afraid of Co the thing that we should be
[28:27] afraid of is TB and TB is we too
[28:33] busy amen and and sometimes I say to the
[28:36] church don't be a CEO of a church that's
[28:39] a Christmas Easter only Christian so we
[28:42] should be always a Believer all the time
[28:45] and we not we should never ever forget
[28:48] God's goodness and his grace and mercy
[28:50] that is shared upon us and you know you
[28:52] could have had tonight you could have
[28:54] had a nice peaceful night and you
[28:56] wouldn't have to listen to me but you

[29:00] wanted to be in church you know with a
[29:03] deer cth unto the he he's calling this a
[29:06] deer calleth unto the water Brooks so my
[29:09] soul is calling unto thee and that's our
[29:12] expectation daily that God that we
[29:14] should live as though he's coming right
[29:17] now Hallelujah we don't want to look to
[29:20] the the future we see the politics and
[29:22] certainly the whole world is looking at
[29:24] America but you know we should be
[29:26] looking to Israel because she is our
[29:28] time piece Hallelujah and if she's our
[29:31] time pieace Hallelujah it should put
[29:33] something in us tonight that we should
[29:35] be into battle with the devil Hallelujah
[29:38] we shouldn't make peace with the devil
[29:40] we shouldn't put things in place with
[29:42] the devil we should be able to say devil

[30:16] cannot forgive you right now that's

[45:10] blessed assured Jesus is M cuz I know
[45:13] the same Jesus is here is the same Jesus

[45:34] your your
[45:36] character that's why I always say to
[45:38] young people you enjoy your single life
[45:42] you do have some responsibilities you do
[45:44] have certain things that you have to be
[45:47] responsible that's right giving to God
[45:50] 100% but when you become married and you
[45:53] have children that's when the challenges
[45:56] stop
[45:58] amen all right and sometimes God's got
[46:00] to put you through
[46:02] things that you don't want to go through
[46:05] but God's got to have a perfect bride
[46:08] he's got to have a perfect prde without
[46:10] spot or
[46:12] wrinkle so we come to the understanding
[46:15] that David would pour out his heart he
[46:17] would say th you are my Hiding Place
[46:21] amen amen he's got to be The Hiding
[46:23] Place amen praise God hallelujah amen
[46:27] says here I've heard in Matthew it says
[46:30] you've heard that it have been said Thou
[46:32] shalt Love Thy Neighbor hate thy enemy
[46:36] but I say unto you love your
[46:40] enemies amen right bless them amen that
[46:45] curse you amen that's hard when somebody
[46:49] is giving you a one finger salute on the
[46:52] freeway
[46:53] Brothers what do we do do we ch the
[46:57] cheek or do we Chase up and say I want
[47:00] to have a talk with him or do we say God
[47:04] bless you all right now all right they
[47:07] may do one we do five all right that's
[47:09] Grace Hallelujah the more you do it the
[47:12] better you become Hallelujah because the
[47:15] devil knows that when you go to service
[47:17] like tonight I apologize for being late
[47:21] we were just on time just then we went
[47:24] to the petrol station pet pump didn't
[47:27] work on this pump went to the other pump
[47:30] was difficult working the pumps my God
[47:34] and two weeks ago I said to the church
[47:36] when you're when you're wed to come to
[47:38] church and you're so blessed during the
[47:40] week you're so calm he puts the slowest
[47:43] driver in front of you and when you pass
[47:47] him there's another one there's another
[47:50] one there's another one praise God that
[47:53] was just like that
[47:55] tonight I didn't I know how many people
[47:57] were slow drivers but they were slow but
[47:59] I said to the church God is working his
[48:02] patience in you and I so he's got to use
[48:05] somebody for you to overcome he's going
[48:08] to use your brother and sister that's
[48:11] right they might step on your toe and
[48:12] say I ain't coming back to church he
[48:15] stepped on my toe but proper of God said
[48:18] the church is your
[48:20] protection he says when you come to
[48:21] church that's your protection now
[48:24] brother Ben also says Church don't save
[48:26] you
[48:27] but if there's something inside of you
[48:29] you can't wait for the doors to open
[48:32] that's what he's talking about he's
[48:33] talking about that in the man that
[48:35] dwells within you you can't help but
[48:38] come to church you can't help but praise
[48:40] God you can't help but lift your mouth
[48:42] and say Lord I'm dead to the world and
[48:46] as soon as you walk out that door the
[48:48] devil's going to say okay I'm going to
[48:50] prove
[48:51] it he tries the brothers
[48:55] first yeah come on soon as the brothers
[48:58] all go out he going to cut you off he
[49:00] going to put people in front of you he
[49:02] going to rob your joy yes and when he
[49:05] robs your joy your wife can't even make
[49:07] you happy anymore all right now come on
[49:11] all right that's how the devil Works he
[49:13] he he only knows one thing he knows how
[49:16] to bring heartache he knows how to bring
[49:18] pain but when there is pain and heart
[49:20] there's joy in the
[49:22] morning my my my my my there's joy in
[49:25] the morning
[49:27] it's easy to love those that love
[49:30] you but when those that hate
[49:33] you and you might say that brother Lee
[49:36] how do you
[49:37] know in the last 50 minutes going to say
[49:39] this this a personal testimony you say
[49:42] to me how do I
[49:43] know there's a young man in our
[49:46] church this young man he'd come to a
[49:49] camp in Florida in
[49:52] 2018 he was with a Pentecostal girl they
[49:55] were just friends since the age of 14
[49:58] there was another sister in the church
[49:59] by the name of Naomi now she liked this
[50:02] young man but this young man when he was
[50:05] trying to make his acquaintance people
[50:07] around him would say discouraging things
[50:11] she's not he's not your type he's too
[50:16] chubby you can get somebody better I
[50:20] said to the young sisters if you have a
[50:21] holy ghost filled man that's good enough
[50:23] for you don't matter what he looks like
[50:27] he'll look after you he'll pray for you
[50:31] but don't discourage anything all right
[50:33] now that may be happening because there
[50:36] might be something that God
[50:38] ordains and you might put your foot in
[50:40] it and draw some
[50:44] conclusion so
[50:46] 2018 they come to Camp brother Jack
[50:49] meets this young man this girl is
[50:51] ringing him up in Australia she's
[50:53] complaining to him where are you I'm at
[50:56] a church came no you're
[50:58] not he's one foot in the camp one foot
[51:03] on the
[51:04] out God that's what happens when you
[51:09] [Music]
[51:10] compromise now he tells the
[51:13] Lord when I go back lord if we break up
[51:17] Lord I know it's the will of God he had
[51:20] enough sense to say that enough sense to
[51:24] say that wow so he comes back from
[51:27] 2018 from Camp they break
[51:30] up they break
[51:33] up when they break up he's he's
[51:36] heartbroken it's his first
[51:38] love yes sir so he breaks up with her
[51:43] but he's still FRS now you know the
[51:45] worldly girls you know worldly girls
[51:49] they probably discard him but they still
[51:51] want to keep in
[51:55] communication so she keeps oh how are
[51:58] you I'm so sad how we I got a new
[52:03] boyfriend but he's not really new we've
[52:05] been dating for over a
[52:10] year and your mind goes who you see
[52:14] that's what the world
[52:16] does to believers they manipulate them
[52:20] they try to strip them of every
[52:23] Integrity they have as a human being
[52:25] that's exactly right
[52:27] but it can happen in the
[52:30] church true so the church can also be
[52:33] guilty of the same thing but God knows
[52:36] the beginning from the end brothers and
[52:38] sisters he knows what's good for you
[52:41] even though sometimes you may feel oh I
[52:44] don't feel it Lord but that's your
[52:45] benefits
[52:47] God so what happens and I'll cut the
[52:50] story short because it drives a
[52:54] situation has driven him back into his
[52:58] her
[53:02] arms and that's a personal
[53:05] bit now you may ask what happened people
[53:08] weren't happy with just being friends I
[53:10] understand that but when he's a 24 year
[53:13] old he's an adult he's no longer a child
[53:17] he's an adult he has a right to make his
[53:20] decisions as much as we love to beat our
[53:24] children or smake or dis
[53:28] plan come
[53:30] on we like to keep them here but they
[53:34] end up being there all right sister
[53:37] brandham said that to brother brandham
[53:40] when Rebecca wanted to play some Boogie
[53:42] wogie Blues yeah and she slammed the
[53:44] door and and what did sister Brown said
[53:47] she needs a
[53:48] weapon some of the mothers would have
[53:51] said that too yes sir but brother
[53:53] Brandon knew that he wasn't fighting it
[53:55] flesh and blood
[53:57] huj he was fighting against demon
[53:59] Spirits amen God knows what's best for
[54:03] you so he goes back into a situation
[54:07] that he the Lord told him remember what
[54:10] I said he he made a
[54:13] promise God hears the promise brother
[54:17] Jack counseled me on this bit he said
[54:19] you know brother Lee he has been given a
[54:21] chance and God had broken it up now he's
[54:24] going back to the fire he will have to
[54:26] deal with God it's a what is it in the
[54:30] Bible it says it's a horrible thing to
[54:32] be in the hand of an Angry
[54:36] God so he goes
[54:39] back but she's still got a
[54:42] boyfriend he's just a friend don't you
[54:46] hate that young
[54:49] man I like you as a
[54:53] brother but I don't like you as a
[54:56] boyfriend all
[54:59] right all right come on I I'm saying
[55:03] something that's really personal
[55:05] here so on Easter
[55:12] 2020 he gets a phone call from this
[55:15] Pentecostal girl who they have been
[55:18] staying in the same house remember what
[55:21] you said brother Jack he will have to
[55:23] deal with God that's the coin that's a
[55:27] the uh that's the that's the trouble
[55:29] with young people when God gives you a
[55:32] clear
[55:34] Direction you refuse to listen to God
[55:37] and we ask God he's rich in Mercy but
[55:40] when Mercy's there we want
[55:43] judgment when God when brother said we
[55:46] fight our way to hell when God has given
[55:48] us
[55:50] Mercy my
[55:52] God so he goes back he gets a me message
[55:57] he's heartbroken brother
[55:59] Jack and this is the reason why I wanted
[56:01] to come and talk about this particular
[56:03] subject to brother Jack because brother
[56:05] Jack was a was a part of that
[56:10] 2018 when this young boy met brother
[56:12] Jack he was Star
[56:17] Struck you ever a pray sister should be
[56:20] proud of your son when young men can get
[56:23] Star
[56:24] Struck and he said he said you know when
[56:26] I saw Jack brother Jack I was lost for
[56:30] words I said that's good that's good
[56:33] enough for
[56:35] me so when Jack gave me the counsel and
[56:39] I knew what I was up against so in
[56:41] Easter of 2020 just before is it 2022
[56:46] what year was it
[56:47] honey
[56:50] 21 he goes and he makes a a nuisance of
[56:54] himself he goes and Facebook and he
[56:57] writes a message on Facebook he said Mom
[57:02] Dad I'm sorry that I'm not the son that
[57:06] you want me to
[57:08] be his father's a me his grandfather is
[57:11] a
[57:12] pastor his grandfather is a deacon so he
[57:17] has a good plant for him but brothers
[57:20] and sisters it doesn't matter if you've
[57:21] been in the message 30 40 years until
[57:24] you have a personal experience right
[57:26] that's right then it's just another
[57:28] church it's just another
[57:30] fellowship so at this point he takes off
[57:34] and then the message is relay to the
[57:37] family that he's going to do something
[57:40] fairly stupid CU at the end of his
[57:43] message he says I just want to sleep
[57:46] I've wasted my life see when we realize
[57:51] when it's all is said and done when we
[57:53] come to the end of it what really matter
[57:56] matters is Jesus
[57:58] Christ that's what really matters and he
[58:01] came to the realization that since the
[58:03] age of 14 now he's 24 he's 10 years he's
[58:08] wasted all his life and he just wants to
[58:10] end it so the mother when she receives
[58:14] the
[58:15] message as you all mothers know that's
[58:18] something that you cannot bear your
[58:20] firstborn your firstborn the love of
[58:24] your life the the first
[58:27] born you try to get somebody to try to
[58:30] talk you out of his wrongs that that
[58:32] ain't going to work because mothers know
[58:36] beneath the heart lies a little child so
[58:39] she's crying and
[58:42] wailing and then the husband turns you
[58:44] know the husband doesn't know what to
[58:46] say but the only thing he can say the
[58:49] lord giveth the lord taketh blessed be
[58:54] the name of the Lord because you never
[58:56] now in a situation cuz now he's in God's
[58:58] hands and if he's elected seed if either
[59:01] he repents either he comes back to
[59:04] Christ with repentance if he doesn't and
[59:07] resist it God will take him off so
[59:10] there's no other Comfort but by by Jesus
[59:14] Christ so he he relays it she cries she
[59:17] hollers there's nothing she can do
[59:20] they're traveling 3 hours to go see him
[59:24] they get to his destination brother Jack
[59:26] he's nowhere to be found so we they ring
[59:29] the police officers the police officers
[59:32] there's nothing they can do after 72
[59:35] hours unless we unless they sign a a
[59:38] document of insanity but he said he's
[59:41] not
[59:41] insane but while this is all happening
[59:45] it's an uncertain battle cuz you just
[59:47] don't know which way it's going to go
[59:51] but that is the that is the most
[59:53] sweetest time when you can go to
[59:55] Heavenly
[59:56] father that's the time you can say Lord
[1:00:00] I've proved you in the small things this
[1:00:03] is a giant if you can be with David you
[1:00:06] can be with this young man but you just
[1:00:09] got to keep swinging it and you got to
[1:00:12] let it Loose brothers and sisters it's
[1:00:14] no good going around the same message
[1:00:16] over and over and over again you got to
[1:00:20] let it Loose you got to let the word
[1:00:23] work Glory when it works by faith praise
[1:00:28] God so when they had it go and then they
[1:00:31] pinged them off you know how police
[1:00:33] taking they can find you and you think
[1:00:35] you can run away from them they hide in
[1:00:39] places where you don't think they're
[1:00:40] hiding they give you tickets where you
[1:00:43] least
[1:00:45] expected but they just have a way of
[1:00:48] finding somebody so they said we don't
[1:00:52] know where he is he said give me a cell
[1:00:54] number I'll text you know police
[1:00:57] detectiv he's
[1:01:00] answering they pinged him off the towers
[1:01:04] they find his position now this young
[1:01:07] man when he was young now he's in a
[1:01:11] weight
[1:01:12] of60
[1:01:14] kgs depression
[1:01:17] weight he goes out of this vehicle
[1:01:20] brother Jack and while he's going out in
[1:01:22] this vehicle he puts a rope around
[1:01:25] around his head that was a blessing in
[1:01:29] disguise cuz sisters he broke the
[1:01:35] branch at the time he he didn't tell us
[1:01:38] but when he had calmed down he told us
[1:01:41] Yeah I broke the
[1:01:46] branch so he ends up going back to the
[1:01:49] car and he's sitting in the front seat
[1:01:52] with a knife in his lap and at that
[1:01:54] moment the police turn
[1:01:58] up God will use the authorities for you
[1:02:03] amen amen like I said there's a
[1:02:07] glitch there's a glitch praise God so
[1:02:10] when he came back they escorted him to
[1:02:14] the the the hospital brother Jack they
[1:02:19] got him there and he didn't want to go
[1:02:22] home brother Jackie said I ain't going
[1:02:24] home the police said yes you are he was
[1:02:28] forced back home oh literally and I tell
[1:02:32] you you know when the child is had some
[1:02:34] things from the world they pick up bad
[1:02:36] habits bad habits brother Jack and you
[1:02:39] want to do the Holy Ghost and Fire
[1:02:43] thing that's what One Pastor said to me
[1:02:46] he said brother I know you want to do
[1:02:49] the quick way but you got to let God do
[1:02:52] it you got to let God do it
[1:02:56] sometimes he would be in the back room
[1:02:57] and we would we would preach on Sunday
[1:02:59] brother Jack you may run but you cannot
[1:03:03] hide if you're an elected seed God will
[1:03:06] work on you God will strip you God will
[1:03:09] bring you to the end of yourself because
[1:03:11] his word said so am hallelujah amen so
[1:03:15] he comes to a
[1:03:18] place I'm winding it up now brother Jack
[1:03:21] no I'm winding it up he comes to a place
[1:03:24] brothers and sisters he's coming to
[1:03:30] church he's sitting in
[1:03:35] church that's all he's doing he's
[1:03:37] sitting in
[1:03:39] church you know some people do sit like
[1:03:41] that in
[1:03:43] church they do sit like that in
[1:03:46] church but the spirit of
[1:03:48] prayer one day there's going to be a
[1:03:52] change one day in the atmosphere there's
[1:03:54] going to be a change
[1:03:56] he used to come to choir practice
[1:03:58] brother Evans would have choir practice
[1:04:00] he would call the young man up and he
[1:04:01] would
[1:04:03] go you see this young man can sing he'd
[1:04:06] been singing in the church since the age
[1:04:07] of four he'd sung in front of many many
[1:04:12] great pastors that have come through but
[1:04:15] it doesn't matter unless you have a
[1:04:17] personal experience you can be naturally
[1:04:20] gifted but if you don't let that gift
[1:04:21] under God's
[1:04:22] hands so he sits there and the sister
[1:04:25] Taps him on on the shoulder sister he
[1:04:27] comes up to him and says Michael that's

[1:10:53] your fellowship brother Westco brother
[1:10:56] uh um brother
[1:10:59] um no um Israel
[1:11:02] po they were there at our meetings a lot

[1:11:07] when he came to Florida he really
[1:11:10] enjoyed himself because he was around
[1:11:12] the
[1:11:13] Believers and so what happened he

[1:11:39] God brother bradam said if you're a
[1:11:41] Christian you long to go where other
[1:11:45] Christians are that's in the message of
[1:11:47] thirsting for Life en closing the
[1:11:50] fellowship with others Christians so you
[1:11:52] cannot stay away from church
[1:11:56] you see he could have stayed home but he
[1:11:58] couldn't there's a deep call to the deep
[1:12:01] and if there's a call a deep calling
[1:12:02] this got to be a
[1:12:05] response you can't do it because it's he
[1:12:08] says here I'm hungry but I'll never go
[1:12:11] to the table I'll never I'll I'll never
[1:12:14] eat I'll just keep going to it you've
[1:12:17] got to go and feed on the word of God

[1:12:38] months after everything had died down he
[1:12:41] said Dad I know not to kill myself I
[1:12:45] know that because the Bible says it and
[1:12:47] brother brandom also gives us that
[1:12:49] Blessed Assurance but Dad I just wanted
[1:12:52] the pain to go

[1:13:43] little bit short of cash brother wisco

[1:13:50] brother Michael said to me how's brother
[1:13:52] Wesco I said he's good you just keep
[1:13:55] praying for him so this October we're
[1:13:57] going back to do a wedding for Michael

[1:14:03] testimony but most of all to encourage

[1:14:09] parted the Red Sea he's still the same
[1:14:12] God right now Hallelujah whatever your

[1:14:25] [Applause]
[1:14:31] Hallelujah
[1:14:32] Lord thank you Lord bless you thank you
[1:14:35] so much amen my God God bless you
[1:14:40] amen praise the
[1:14:42] Lord amen appreciate brother Lee on
[1:14:46] tonight um I
[1:14:49] was I I knew a portion of his
[1:14:53] testimony and uh and knowing the family
[1:14:56] and just remembering back in 2018 when
[1:14:58] we first met the Saints from Australia
[1:15:01] they came here to brother West go
[1:15:03] services and everybody's trying to
[1:15:04] figure out who them people on the second
[1:15:06] Road and sisters that is just so on fire
[1:15:10] and uh a couple Brothers showed up and I
[1:15:12] believe Mike was playing the guitar you
[1:15:14] know and and and everything but um I
[1:15:18] knew that
[1:15:19] um when I went to um Australia and he
[1:15:23] wasn't serving the lord at the time time
[1:15:25] and we're just trying to encourage the
[1:15:27] pastor um you know you just you say
[1:15:31] things but you know you're going through
[1:15:33] yourself while while you're trying to
[1:15:35] encourage somebody else and uh but when
[1:15:38] I when I see how the season change and
[1:15:42] and and if you all don't know Sister
[1:15:44] Naomi once you meet her you'll never
[1:15:47] forget her right when she shake your
[1:15:51] hand when sister Naomi Shake Your Hand
[1:15:55] and she she give you a good
[1:15:58] handshake and uh but but you know uh
[1:16:01] precious saints that are just I mean
[1:16:03] there's so much encouragement that we
[1:16:04] can get from there and I I love this
[1:16:06] because uh even though brother Michael
[1:16:07] went through this season his life when
[1:16:10] he comes back and he surrenders
[1:16:11] everything to the Lord the scripture
[1:16:14] applies forget not
[1:16:17] all his
[1:16:19] benefits there are benefits in serving
[1:16:23] God
[1:16:26] yeah
[1:16:28] benefits and and and the first thing God
[1:16:30] wants from us is is just a a surrendered
[1:16:33] and dedicated life uh because see unless
[1:16:37] you're dedicated to God it's going to be
[1:16:39] hard for you to be dedicated to a spouse
[1:16:42] right right uh whether that's husband or
[1:16:45] wife you have to be dedicated to God
[1:16:47] first before you can actually you know
[1:16:49] be able to serve somebody else so uh but
[1:16:52] there there there's so much even you
[1:16:54] know uh the spirit of suicide has been
[1:16:57] busted here tonight amen um just uh the
[1:17:01] love of God where everybody was telling
[1:17:03] you know the sister he's too heavy you
[1:17:06] know and you don't want a guy like that
[1:17:08] he well the heaviness is what saved his
[1:17:13] life so God God specifically designed
[1:17:19] him with the weight that he had because
[1:17:23] God knew he was going to go through
[1:17:24] through a
[1:17:25] trial and then when he start going
[1:17:27] through that trial he he didn't want to
[1:17:29] tell nobody but I broke the
[1:17:32] branch and for us we say praise God you
[1:17:35] broke the branch cuz had you not broke
[1:17:38] the branch it' be a different story
[1:17:40] right but the the very thing that he was
[1:17:42] criticized over is the thing that saved
[1:17:44] his life
[1:17:55] there's a lot said here tonight there's
[1:17:57] a lot said here tonight and and and as
[1:18:01] brother um Lee was sharing when when
[1:18:04] Michael came back to church and he
[1:18:05] wasn't just still wasn't there he showed
[1:18:08] you how he was sitting down but when the
[1:18:11] sister walked up to him in church and
[1:18:13] said the Lord told me that you are
[1:18:16] supposed to sing the prodigal
[1:18:18] son this this week this Sunday and he
[1:18:22] said he looked at that with the life he
[1:18:24] was Liv say ain't no way the Lord told
[1:18:26] you that I went home said no I got and
[1:18:28] he tried to get get out of it by telling
[1:18:30] his daddy you know that you know Dad I I
[1:18:32] got unclean hands I'm not CU unclean
[1:18:35] hands don't supposed to be doing nothing
[1:18:37] right but uh but the Lord said it yeah
[1:18:40] and uh he still was trying to get out of
[1:18:41] it and when he um when he finally got up
[1:18:44] there and did it it caused him to break
[1:18:47] and and I I remember um uh my brother
[1:18:51] used to say that when he would when he
[1:18:53] wasn't serving the lord Lord and they
[1:18:55] would come into the house of the Lord it
[1:18:58] would he said the devil would fight him
[1:19:01] don't you lift your hand in this
[1:19:03] atmosphere don't don't lift your hand in
[1:19:05] this atmosphere and he would sit there
[1:19:07] just fighting and keep that hand down no
[1:19:11] I ain't going no I'm not going to enter
[1:19:12] in and the music just just moving all on
[1:19:15] the inside like no no I cannot enter in
[1:19:18] I got to be tough in an environment like
[1:19:21] this before you know it
[1:19:23] uh just a and sometime you get it down
[1:19:27] here like this you know just just a
[1:19:29] little bit and nobody can see it but God
[1:19:31] see it and before you know it's it's all
[1:19:34] the way
[1:19:35] up and and whatever that devil was that
[1:19:38] was trying to keep you from praising
[1:19:40] your God that devil just has to loose
[1:19:43] you and let you go he said there
[1:19:45] something about getting into that
[1:19:47] atmosphere and oh my
[1:19:50] god thank God I'm I'm so happy to hear
[1:19:54] this this beautiful testimony I was you
[1:19:56] know one one of the uh beautiful things
[1:19:59] from the weekend is that uh my
[1:20:01] son-in-law and my daughter were there on
[1:20:04] um on Saturday night and my son-in-law
[1:20:08] was absolutely blessed prise
[1:20:14] uh he was blessed and and since he won
[1:20:18] little
[1:20:20] drawing they they caught him on
[1:20:23] camera yeah with a little
[1:20:26] shout and so he gonna go all over the
[1:20:29] world it's recorded you know and and if
[1:20:33] God on Judgment Day have to play it back
[1:20:36] remember what you was
[1:20:38] doing that shout you know but but I just
[1:20:41] believe that was the beginning that's it
[1:20:43] of something that God is getting ready
[1:20:45] to
[1:20:46] do Amen in my in my family and I see
[1:20:50] what God has done in brother Lee family
