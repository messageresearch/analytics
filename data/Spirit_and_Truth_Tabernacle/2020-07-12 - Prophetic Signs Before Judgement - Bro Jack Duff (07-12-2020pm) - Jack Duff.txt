Shonda we certainly appreciate that a wonderful song amen today praise the Lord Thank You sister Rachel man I certainly appreciate your gift a man we certainly appreciate the Lord I want to just read a scripture here and then we will just go into our little topic for today a man I want to read from Exodus chapter 3 praise the Lord man our God is good and I forgot to say it's good to have brother Quentin back he was away a man for a few weeks there and good to have him back with this law it brought him back safely a man Exodus chapter 3 and I want to read just verse 1 through 10 if I can praise the Lord [Music] yes okay Exodus 3 and in verse 1 through 10 it says now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law the priest of Midian and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the mountain of God even to Horeb the angel of the Lord appeared unto Him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed praise the Lord and Moses said I will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burn and when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God called unto Him out of the midst of the bush and said Moses Moses and he said hear mine and he said draw not nigh hither put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground moreover he said I am the God of thy father the God of Abraham the god of Isaac the God of Jacob and Moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon God and the Lord said I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt and have heard their crime by reason of their taskmasters 5 know their sorrows a man knows all about it it says and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land with milk and honey unto the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the amorite and and the perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites now therefore behold the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them come now therefore and I will send thee unto Pharaoh that that means bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt a mental ordered a blessing to the reading of his word let's just bow a man in a word of Prayer over the Word of God father we thank you for this privilege and opportunity we have to Lord read scripture and we pray to the Holy Spirit with MAO just give us the inspiration God for what you want shared here today and Lord we just pray you take complete control over every thought so good to have all the Saints in the house of the Lord and those that are joining us online speak to each and every one through your word bring encouragement bring correction bring Lord bring that the Spirit of God upon the word let the Holy Ghost fall as it did in a Amen in the book of Acts as Peter yet spake the word the Holy Ghost fell on them so Lord just bring deliverance whatever is needed God brings healing let it come through your word God even today we're careful to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory we take every spirit that's against the Spirit of God underneath the control of the Holy Spirit even right now in Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you you can be seated Amen praise the Lord we want to just take a topic today prophetic signs before judgment a man prophetic signs before judgment a man and as you know we just kind of get started as we were just reading there in the book of Exodus you know that the whole story of Moses a man and what we read III would assume a man that all of us believe what happened to Moses a man all of us believe that he met God at a burning bush it's not just a story that was told to us but we actually believe this happened to Moses and and and you know and one of the things that that I think that's striking to me is that you know we could believe a story about Moses and this happened probably some I mean years ago 4000 5000 years ago yet we believe it by faith that it occurred but when we see God doing similar things a man in another ministry that was only roughly you know a hundred years even less than that a man from this time God doing the same thing we still got to have the you know we still got to have that same belief because it's the same God moving glory to God it's the same God that the same he's not just a God of history we heard that this morning but he is man he's the same yesterday today and forever and the reason that I could believe that he can move a man the same way today because I see them doing the exact same thing so mark my confidence is that it's the same God hallelujah glory to God but as we as we look at this a man I want to just kind of just bring a couple of statements in and a couple quotes but we're talking about prophetic signs before judgment here in this discernment the ten virgins and the 144,000 Jews brother Branham speaks and he makes a statement says six days a man he labored he's talking about Almighty God there at the beginning six days he labor and and seventh he rested a man that's complete C seven six days he is labored in the world for 2,000 years it was destroyed by water second two thousand years Christ come and this is the third 2000 now and the end of every two thousand something happens the world is shook back again in six thousand years he built the world six thousand years to church Labor's against the world and the seven thousand is that thousand years millennium ring understand it now he says now the church has seven church ages also a man who says God and that's the complete number of the churches that's all seven seven is God's completed number seven church ages seven thousand years of creation everything deals in seven now since we're talking about a man prophetic science before judgment in the first two thousand years God shook the world a man with with a flood and that flood actually took us off of our tilted the earth a little bit took us off our axis this is what causes some of the weather patterns that we have nowadays amen because before they and everything was perfect the seasons were perfect everything just right actually that time it had never rained on the earth the weight of the earth goddess its irrigation is out from underneath my god God did things so perfectly when he designed it's like the earth had its own sprinkler system hallelujah Amen a perfect sprinkler system glory to God everything was just right it had never rained on the earth glory to God because everything was so perfect but but when sin came in God sent a prophet to try to call the people from their sinful conditions and then I'm not only than his city center with a word to preach 120 years they may he warn the people of the rain that was coming but he also built a boat that the people had the opportunity that come and get on the boat if they want to protection they had two hits listen to that prophetic sign that God had given him just before he was gonna judge the earth in the first two thousand years Noah had a message Noah had a boat Noah a man had word from the Lord nor had everything the people needed all they had to do was follow up nor was saying hallelujah and the other thing we need to understand nobody else during that time had a message nobody else during that time had a boat how long you had to get on Noah's boat if you wanted to be spared amen from the judgment that was coming hallelujah Noah himself was a prophetic sign hallelujah for the first 2,000 years every two thousand years something happens every two thousand years now now after the days of nor we had another two thousand years glory and this is when the Lord Jesus comes on the scene amen and I mean I hate to just call him a prophetic sign but he was the sign of old signs amen a virgin conceived and bore a son hallelujah and Jesus Christ coming to see but but here in Jesus day of that second two thousand years transmitted began to strike the Jews because they rejected their prophetic sign Oh hallelujah just begin to come upon the Jews because they rejected something it was during that time after Jesus died and rose again that Paul said we turn from the Jews to the Gentiles hallelujah we've been in that time a man where the turn is taken to the Gentiles we've gone through seven Church ages and we're in that time where we had the end of the end glory to God we're at the end of the end because now we're at another 2,000 years 6,000 years amen and we've actually gone over time when you really calculate it we've gone over time just a little bit but you know I thank God and His grace has allowed us to go over time for a little bit because he's still trying to reach somebody amen while God is trying to reach you to pull you in the devil trying to do everything he can to pull you out hallelujah you know I don't know us both they were still doubting a man they were inside the ark with the door locked and still doubting whether nor had the truth or not a man but the good thing about is that by them being in the art ever since God locked the door there was no way they were gonna get out can I put it this way your bow can take you out I said your doubt cannot take you out if you belong to God that you belong to God hallelujah glory to God amen so here we are two thousand years late the last two thousand years God is ready to shake the world again but God says the Prophet Amen on the scene and this time as he promised the quarters worked amen before the great and terrible day of the Lord amen our send you Elijah the prophet and he'll turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers amen and and the ark that we find today is the Ark of the word of God what we need to do is stay inside the words stay inside the ark we'll be safe Amen at this time of judgment hallelujah I look at let's look at another quote here glory hallelujah this is coming out of the the message spoken words original seed and I just want to read a things here by the grace of God spoken words original seat and this is kind of picking up from where we were last week says so it's at that time in this country that the person that that person will appear force in the scripture and is thus saith the Lord that in the latter rain there will come forth a Mount Carmel showdown a showdown Bible for field that's what happened in the days of Elijah he had the Mount Carmel showdown amen a Bible fulfilled to the letter glory John the Baptist his messenger his message before its face in Malachi 3 planted a former rain and was rejected by the churches the denominations the pharisees and the sadducees in his day Jesus came and had the Mount Transfiguration showdown glory this forerunner of the last days will sow for the former rain and I love the statement Jesus will be the showdown between denominations and creeds which is his word when it comes a man a showdown the rest of his bride so Jesus will be the showdown to prove who's right and who's wrong you don't have to prove it Oh glory to God I don't have to prove it amen I just I just preach it and I live it but I don't have to prove it it is not my job to prove it Jesus himself will prove this Laurie the guy say that first was Mount Carmel the second was Mount Transfiguration the third will be mountain sighing glory now I wanna I just wanna the scripture just kind of came to me let's just go to mark 16 real quick hey man I knowing that quote brother branham said Jesus would be the showdown between denominations of Crete a man which is his word when he comes a showdown the rapture is bright so the showdown is going to be those that go in the rapture knows that thoughts amen but I want to just show you how Jesus became the showdown man back in the in the early church here mark 16 I was reading the scripture this week and it just blessed my heart verse 9 says when Jesus says mark 16 verse 9 says now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week he appeared first to Mary Magdalene out of whom he had cast out Seven Devils and she went and told them that had been with him as they mourned and wept now I love this because this business Mary Magdalene is going with the testimony of how she has seen the Lord she's going to testimony that's how she has experienced the Lord amen she's not talking about something past tense I'm telling you that he is risen again hallelujah says she went and told them that had been with him as they mourned her wealth and they when they had heard that he was alive and had been seen seen of her believed not now Jesus had already given them scriptures he had already prophesied that he was going to be rising and he kept telling after the third day this was gonna happen after the third day that was gonna happen but it was something new they never heard a sermon like that they never heard a message like that so really challenged their thinking so here upon his resurrection the first person he appears to is Mary Magdalene now they refuse to believe her testimony so here comes here comes this next verse and says after a man after that he appeared in another form unto two of them as they walked and went into the country this is Cleopas and his friend and they went and told it until the until the residue neither believed they them I'm looking at this glory to God so here Mary Magdalene comes with the testimony Cleopas and his friend comes with the testimony and you know the Bible actually tells us I don't amount the two or three witnesses let every word be established but you know even after they heard these powerful testimonies the disciples the men that were living with Jesus the man that were fishing with Jesus the me that were praying for the sick with Jesus the men that experienced so many miracles they still did not believe that he was risen even after this hallelujah and I'm looking at this because no matter how much we give people are supernatural no matter how much we give them the word we still find a group of people on the earth today that refuse to believe but I want to tell you something Jesus himself will be the showdown watch this a man in verse 14 afterward he appeared to the eleven as they sat at meat and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart I was thinking about this here at his resurrection the very first time that he sees the disciples the other eleven abdi he was resurrected he rebukes them oh I don't want that to be my testimony amen I wanted to be a very exciting experience when I feel for the first time I don't want him rebuking me I want to be able to express my love to him hallelujah look at this add to it he appeared unto the of the eleven as they said at me and I braided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen Jesus himself became the showdown for the testimonies that had preceded him you don't have to believe that God sent a prophet but Jesus himself will be the showdown when he calls his bride into and its bride will be father with a prophet sing hallelujah amen we don't have to prove it Jesus himself is gonna prove it he will be the showdown all right stay with me church glory to God amen this pork goes on to say in spoken words original seed he says he largest behavior and in this quote that I'm reading to you now I'm still in the the channel of pick up your pen and write this is still part of that entire a man's statement that the angel the Lord told a prophet to write to the church so I'm still reading amen I'm taking it almost section by section trying to make sure that we get what the Lord is trying to give to us in this season it says Elijah's behavior Moses's behavior John's behavior leaving their field of service many of the people didn't understand them it was because they was rejected and their message said the seed had been sown judgment was next glory and they was assigned to the people from God that judgment was at hand planting was over it was over now you know I'm looking at this a man on today and and I just want to just kind of we you know we've talked about Elijah and we can go back and just touch it just for a brief moment but you know during the time of Elijah what trigger the showdown and Elijah's day was that the people got away from the Word of God and I don't did they get away from it you know this just kind of flows and connects with last sermons I mean last week's sermon you know how history is repeating itself hey man what happened was that they had a leader they had godly leaders that started out Israel with you know where people like David and Solomon and so God was just moving the muscles free but even in Solomon's day how look we can see how seeds were so where it was going to get worse and worse because Solomon merits some women that he should not have Mary Sullivan mayor of these foreign women caused him to build houses their gods he built one for the God of Israel but then he got a man he got a little relaxed and and then he started building houses to the gods of his wife and he started bringing in idolatry hallelujah into Israel where God was supposed to be the only God of Israel but here they got that's why I have no other gods before me but they've been given to bring it in even in Solomon's day till the Galilee we down my 1/2 and the scripture say he was the worst of every King that ever amen our seventh of throne and in Israel this man hallelujah married a Jezebel though the worst one the worse between could mirror he caused an affinity of the kingdom by Mary meanness later Jezebel and she was a true Optometry she wanted nothing to do with the God of Israel killing the prophets and everything my god what a woman that this man married but you know brother Branham you know tells us how Israel's history is it's typed into the US history a man and when a.m. comes on the scene and Israel got to the worst act that it had ever been God used a prophet a man by the name of Elijah they're trying to call the people back to the word he's saying a God that answers by fire let him be God I'm tired of y'all following all these false cops y'all guys can't answer prayer y'all guys can't do this but yet y'all choose the phone he said let the gods answer by fire let him be God the people agreed to it they accepted the showdown and when God showed up on the scene hallelujah all the priests and prophets out there cutting themselves and trying to get their God answer prayer he loud you just sitting back saying look you're guiding he ain't done that yet maybe he's on vacation maybe he's dead maybe this you know he said y'all just wasting time okay I'm no now it's my time here he's standing by his self against all these other prophets let me tell you something in the South you may be spending by yourself but if you're standing with God you're not alone hallelujah greater see that singing than he that's in the world glory to God Elijah stood myself it brought on a Mount Carmel showdown God showed up God demonstrated that he was with Elijah Amen when he consumed the sacrifice hallelujah but it's because the people that got away from the Word of God now brother Adam say notice Elijah's behavior aunty Elijah did thereafter his mighty my you know supernatural move Elijah took off running from Jezebel Elijah went to a cave to hide from a woman that he thought would take his life hallelujah notice his strange behavior now I want to you know just kind of focus our attention today on Moses behavior a man we see are Elijah a man but we want to focus on Moses behavior I want to go back and say a couple things about Moses God gave Abraham a vision of the people of Israel coming out of bondage Genesis 15 verse 13 and 14 this is a vision that God gives a man Abraham he says and he said unto Abram know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and shall serve them and they shall afflict them for hundred years and also that nation whom they shall serve will I judge see judgment is gonna come hallelujah amen but before a judgment they will receive a prophetic sign glory to God amen it says and also that nation whom they shall serve will I judge and after what shall they come out with great substance this is a prophecy that God has given Abraham and when Moses is poured hallelujah not just when he's born but when he begins to recognize who he is Oh glory to God because there's a lot of folk on earth that's been born but still don't understand their purpose glory to God they running here and they running there but you don't know why God has placed you on this earth you don't realize were you thinking the economy of God Moses Moses didn't reel his mama tried to tell her mama I want to just kind of take my time and just share this you know his mama tried to tell him Oh God his mama trying to help him understand a man some of the things that had happened glory amen at his birth how she couldn't keep them they met at the house because they either kept going out that they want to kill all the children to it all of male children two years old and under hallelujah and I somehow someway mama was able to get him in a basket put them in the Nile River Moses I'm telling you your story amen here here he gets in the nile river and it just so happened his basket ends up in the house of Pharaoh pharaoh's daughter gets a hold of the basket maybe she's a woman that can't have children so when she sees this baby come out of nowhere she feel like her prayers being answered hallelujah but God allowed the deliverer to be raised in the house of Pharaoh glory to God ain't his mama telling him all these stories it and Moses was like mama I never heard that but you tell me that's my story mom I believe it and based on his mama's revelation Moses tried to deliver the people based on his mama's revelation glory God yet she was to deliver but he could not go to Egypt and get anybody free old Mahmut revelation Moses was not going to do anything till he came in contact with Almighty God and what many of us meet today it's our own personal experience with Almighty God we've been trying to go on Mama's revelation we've been trying to go old dannis revelation but we need our own personal revelation hallelujah when Moses came on the scene what was happening is that God was answering his word through the life of Moses and Moses himself was stepping into a vision the vision that God gave Abraham years ago Moses himself was a man that stepping into the vision and I pray as a church that we would begin to step into a vision that an angel saw before we were even born most of us were even born look at this Moses I want to make this statement here hallelujah glory to God glory to God amen Moses was a great prophet but Moses mentioned to the people he prophesied about something he was a prophet coming before judgment because judgment was giving strike Egypt a man but he propers I have something in his days and we're gonna look this up in Deuteronomy 18 and 15 Moses beginning to prophesy he meant after his ministry had been vindicated amongst the people he gave them a statement saying he said this in Deuteronomy 8:18 15 says the LORD thy God will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee of that brethren like unto me unto Him ye shall hearken now I'm one that believes scripture has a men dual meanings glory to God here we can clearly see that Moses is talking to the Israelites we can see that and it is telling them that God gonna raise up a prophet like unto Him in the midst of them amen right an image to them that brother in him you should hearken now we noted that that that scripture was related to the life amen in the prophetic Ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ but I also believe Amen that scriptures also related to life amen in the prophetic ministry of William Marion Brennan glory to God the Lord raise up a prophet a man like unto Moses hallelujah now let's look at this look at a quote here God is his own interpreter a man the Prophet makes a statement here and this message God as his own interpreter thank you Jesus God help us here it says watch what he did one day he was standing there the first beginning of his ministry there was a man came to him by the name of Simon Simon Peter and when Peter looked upon him and saw him jesus said to him your name is Simon you're the son of Jonas he should have known that Moses said the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet like unto me and you Tomas here now know ha brother branham I did I mean identified a man the Ministry of Jesus with the ability to be able to a men are just kind of minister to it I mean know the heart set the heart heart sort of people know where they come their name and where they come from they may hear the secrets of their hearts this this is part of brother Branham second pool right so here at through the second pool ministries identifying Jesus ministry amen he said this was a prophet like unto Moses when Peter looked at him in Psalms said Jesus said your name is Simon and you're the son of Jonas he should have known that multitude the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet like unto me and him you must hear and there was a man that had never seen him in his life said your name is Simon and you're the son of Jonas why he know right then that there could be no more they hadn't had a prophet for hundreds of years and here was a man telling him who he was no wonder he could receive it glory to God now let's go he says Phillip at that time found anything on the tree brought him back to Jesus Jesus said Behold an Israelite in whom there is no guile said rabbi when did you ever know me he said before Philip called you when you were under the tree I saw you he said rabbi thou art the Son of God you're the king of Israel he knows that was why it didn't need any interpretation Jehovah said that so this very scripture that Moses says in Deuteronomy 18:15 that the Lord your God will raise up a prophet like unto me brother Branham a man looked at the discernment that Jesus demonstrated his own ministry and said that was the Prophet a man that was like unto Moses that Moses prophesied about Jesus himself was stepping into a vision hallelujah glory to God Amen Jesus himself was stepping into a vision let us go on a little further hallelujah hallelujah glory to God amen now I wanted to just saw hit this say man just for a little bit glory just give me a second here my Lord Jesus enemy attack louia we go back to Exodus 3 and I picked this up because I want to just kind of just just think about this here God is calling Moses on he was on the backside of the desert and as I was thinking about this now Exodus has a number of chapters I believe over over 30-something chapters amen and Exodus and uh Moses is calling on the backside of the desert its found in Exodus chapter 3 and in and as I look at it you know the first two chapters first chap to come talk about the condition of Egypt the second chapter kind of talk about Moses birthing and what his mama Dean and what his daddy did and how he was raised in Egypt and in the chapter 2 he actually took off from Egypt do you know amen pretty much the first 40 something years of Moses life is all included in the first two chapters I want you to get that the first 40 something years is only included in two chapters can I just say something you ain't even started writing your book yet hey man yeah yeah yeah God and even started using you yet right and you all worried about this and worried about that you'llyou'll chapter - praise God I've got so much more to do in your life Amen it get greater after chapter 2 the devil tried to wipe you out before you get to chapter 3 hallelujah but once you step into chapter 3 great things are about to start happening a man church I hope you catch that but mouid didn't really begin for Moses till he got to chapter three that's when the excitement started glory to God a man when he really found in place when he found this place in God and not not only this Amen when he was at the burning bush he was no longer going on his mama's testimony come on somebody now he's got his own personal testimony and now when he got his personal testimony everything begins to change hallelujah see when it was going on Mama's testimony he could only write one chapter and actually killed one one Egyptian with Mama's testimony but now God given use them in a mighty way with his own personal testimony all right watch this now we look at Exodus chapter 3 hallelujah and Moses is met by God in the burning bush God uses this bush to get his attention God is attention he's talking to him and and he's saying you know what I've heard that groans in the cries of my people and I'm coming down to bring delivers to the people and I'm gonna send you now now here's the problem Moses is here having a supernatural experience but yet he has excuses as to why he can't do what God called him to do now I want you to stay with me reason I need to say this the reason Moses is even on the backside of the desert Amen is because Moses lost feeling for the people Oh God help us there the reason Moses is here at this burning bush is because he lost feeling for other people he left Egypt and went out to the backside of the desert and forgot all about the people but God said I remember my people and I'm sitting you I don't care about you losing feeling let me tell you something man may forget about you hallelujah woman may forget about you but God has not forgot about you glory to God daddy may forget about you mama fate may forget about you but God has not forgotten [Applause] I remember my people I'm gonna send you Moses right back down to the people that you forgot about now I want you to understand something Moses say now who you want me to go say I don't even know your name and he's having a conversation with God I don't even know your name Who am I gonna tell them sent me hallelujah and God got thunder back to Moses a tell him I am that I am he said that does shut down say unto the children israel i am have sent me unto you now what is that what is that because you look at the children of israel a man in bondage and see when you're in bondage you you need an I am glory to God you need a real I am you don't need I will you don't need I will be praise God and Moses was representing a right now god I want to tell you something here in the midst of this pandemic we needed I am a man and I'm here I was reminded of the song I am hope and they capitalize that so in the midst of your pandemic I M is on the scene I am hope I am peace I am joy I am rest I am your comfort amen relief from your stress I am strength I am faith I am love I am power and your freedom this very hour I am is on the scene church not I was not I will be but I am is here he's present kids come believe that I believe that right oh my god Moses when representing the god of the past he was representing God of right now I am I am telling him that I am sent you down there hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God Moses was given two signs before he went back down into Egypt one was to throw down your rock a man and throw down your rod and pick it up and he threw it on the rod it turned into a snake he picked it up and returned to a stick again also Moses a man was told to put his hand down in his bosom and when he pulled it out it was widest leprous and then God toasted and I put it back down there again and he put it back down and it was healed praise God he had these two sides glory that he was given a man but even with all the supernatural the burning bush the stick turned into a snake and turn him back to a stick again a man the putting his hand in his bosom and then turning lepers and then putting it back in it and it being here with all those supernatural manifestations Moses still was reluctant to go down a man and deliver the children of Israel he began to talk about his inability to speak let's pick this up in perfect strength by perfect witness with our perfect weakness because you know we've seen supernatural - we've heard supernatural testimonies we've experienced it right in our church but some of us some of us are still giving God excuses as to why we came do what we need to do a man some us giving excuses where we can't accomplish some of the things that God has laid before us to accomplish and I want to tell you that two excuses a man only satisfy you but they don't satisfy God when you praying to God and presenting him your excuses let me tell you something God does not feel sorry for you hallelujah you only feel sorry for yourself you got to shake that spirit a man of defeat and and and and and doubt you got to shake that yourself cuz God don't feel sorry for you and I'm gonna give you a quote brother Branham says this is perfect stream power perfect weakness says did God feel sorry for Moses with all of his weakness I said poor little Moses something sure has happened to you you fail from your degree oh my here ya are you was a great man and intellectual there wasn't nothin going to stop your brother you had all your PhDs and ll DS and everything else and now here you come confessing that you are nothing you can't do a thing you're just so weak no God wasn't sorry for him God never took pity on him God had him cured then all of that stuff he wasn't sorry for him but we found out if you're putting it down Exodus 4:14 the anger of God was kindled against him God wasn't sorry for him because he was weak look at this it says you say Oh Lord I just feel so bad I don't believe I could do it God don't feel sorry for you God don't feel sorry for you actually it's what God feels feels like kicking you around a little bit oh my you've given God all your excuses of God ready to kick you around a little bit look it's that see sure sure God don't feel sorry for you he gets angry with you you're just getting in shape then to where he can use you yeah Moses getting Curt cured up God can use him he had the cure he was he was away from his human ability since he didn't have nothing he could rely upon then because he was ready then for the service now you see Moses now was ready to go down into Egypt get rid of all of his excuses God's done the supernatural and now God is ready to use this prophetic sign and Moses Amen that's judgment to the Egyptians and when Moses goes down and throws this rod in front of pharaoh and pharaoh says that's a cheap magician trip rather than moses get afraid and mul just feel like oh god something on something that went wrong Moses stood still I want to tell you to do the same thing stand still and see the salvation of the Lord glory to God don't get all frustrated don't get flustered that stance still watch God bring you out so he threw down the rod and and when when Pharaoh threw down is had his magicians turn on the rocks they rise also unto snakes but before you're not Moses snake ate up thick rope snakes hallelujah now you know in many churches they telling the same story today Lord I got many churches people are excited about what God did for Moses way back then but many of them cannot bring it closer mininum cannot see God using a ministry the same way today we might not be throwing down sticks but we still see the same supernatural God moving on the scene hallelujah glory to God God you just a prophetic sign before judgment right before it's rare I mean for each it was jerked a profit within the land the prophet Moses Moses Moses was told by God said not now they're not gonna receive you went to go down to Egypt even when you throw it on the stick they're not gonna see but God told most saying that when this happened and that happened he said call for blood turn their waters into blood Moses had the power to speak out of his own mouth then change the situation he had the power to bind and he had the power to loose Moses called for blood Moses called for frogs Moses calls for lice or gnats and you know and the thing about it is that uh some of the magician magician's of Pharaoh's court was trying to do the exact same thing but Moses every time he just kept stepping it up another level stepping it up another level step until he got to report them I'm just saying we can't do nothing with this he call for blood he called for frogs it called the licen at sea it called for flies amen the livestock of Egypt was actually destroyed and in the livestock of there in Goshen amongst that the children Israel theirs was spared God was showing the difference all the time he called for Boyles he called for hell he called for locusts he called for dark and the last thing was depth to the firstborn if you did not apply the blood or the token amen to your door something struck me and I want to just present this to you ten plagues struck Egypt ten hallelujah glory to God if we were living in that time a man we just got one right now on the earth and we can't handle that if 10 was to strike us what would it do to the people now I want to tell you something like and I can almost assure you ten plagues struck Egypt and not one Egyptian repented know each if she's repented think about that ten plague struck Egypt drove nobody to repentance and I want to tell you a man coronavirus has hit the earth and the churches are not full yet people still thinking about partying my god scene is on the increase in the midst of a virus how nobody even thinking about God it shows there was something wrong somewhere something wrong with the people's spirit but I do have some good news for the bride even though amen the Egyptians never came to repentance just like today the world itself Amen is represented in Egypt they have not come to repentance but when those planes struck hallelujah it did create an exodus for the children of Israel hallelujah look at why this plague is striped it may create a third Exodus for the pride of Christ and Exodus to get out of here praise God it might not have an impact on the Egyptians but it certainly had an impact only Israel's I Israelites it might not have an impact on the world today but it's certainly gonna have an impact on the Bride of Christ glory to God hallelujah it was a judgment rocked it was a judgment robbed let me just read this out of take the rod and gather the people Moses was a prophetic sign before judgment was to strike Egypt look at this the Prophet says in the robbed that Moses had in his hand it was not the rod of Moses a man it was the rod of God God's judgment wrought a man Moses held it out over Egypt and flies came up he held it out and fleas came up wherever he dumped this robbed it robbed it was a judgment rock it brought judgment upon a disobedient people and the rock was Christ the substitute for sin and sickness glory and Moses took the judgment rod and smote the rock to bring forth water therefore it was the judgment rod of God that smote Jesus and killed him the innocent one and brought from him flowed the holy spirit to a perishing people now that we'd have life no more do we smite the rock but we speak to the rock no more do we smite the rock but we speak to the rock and watch denounce a man in pronouns he said speak to the rock and it shall bring forth his personal pronoun his water speak to the rock and I shall bring forth his water brother branham just giving us the types there we no longer strike the rock you know even in Moses day he he struck the rock twice and and by him striking it twice it caused Moses to miss going to the promised land I want to say this church a man above everything here the church we're gonna keep the Word of God at the forefront amen we're gonna keep the commandment of God at the forefront Moses gift actually caused him to miss the promised land hallelujah if Moses would have kept his gift and checked with the word he would have been alright but he got ahead of the Word of God and and even though he struck the rock twice and he got results amen amen I want you to catch that somebody may may have a gifting life they may get results even with a gift but if their gift is not in accordance to the word forget about the gift a man as spirit and truth we gonna put the word before the gift I'm gonna say that again we're gonna put the word before the gift hey man the gift must come in line with the word glory to God what's the use in having all these manifestations and mr. promise land Alleluia not me I don't want that that my objective and this is the problem many people they're their main objective is just to be seen that's not my objective my objective is to make a rapture hallelujah I don't need to be seen as long as I make a rapture I'm brother Coleman said it years ago you can call me this and you can call me that but whatever you do just don't call me late for the rapture praise God hallelujah can we go a little further hey man I'm going back picking up this quote out of pergamene church ancient the angel wrote to the Prophet told him pick up his pen and write and he wrote this the Prophet wrote this to us say the strange behavior scroll down there a little bit for me it should be the next paragraph right there the strange behavior a Moses Elijah and John withdrawing from the people into seclusion left many confuse they did not realize that it was because their messages had been rejected but the seed had been sold the planting was a judgment was next they served their purpose a sign to the people suggestion was next when we look at Exodus chapter 3 Moses had felt that when he killed that one Egyptian he felt that his brothers knew that he was there to be their deliverer but he was gonna try to take one Egyptian out at a time that was his plan that wasn't God's plan and when he rose up and he told her brothers you say brothers why y'all fighting among ourselves don't do that don't do this and one guy say oh you're gonna kill me like you killed the Egyptian and you say he realized that those guys I mean that is present his countrymen we're not ready to receive his gift so Moses took off running and and here he is sitting on the backside of the desert for he lived 40 years in Egypt on the backside of the desert for 40 years and here this man has spent all this time amen in chapter 1 and chapter 2 finally getting to a place where God can use them 80 years old before God can really use it he's in seclusion he's in isolation and the reason that he's in seclusion and in isolation is because he's built his own complex hallelujah stay with me here Church he has built his own complex that's why he had the burning bush experience because he built a complex hallelujah glory glory glory glory glory I think I want to just touch on that a man just for a little bit if I can just find this definition of a complex it's it's a related group of emotionally significant ideas that are completely or partly repressed that cause psychic conflict leading to abnormal mental state or behavior now now pretty much what happens that you make this stuff up in your mind you make up how people gonna receive you you make up how people are gonna respond and how this gonna happen you make it up in your mind Moses made up in his mind say you know what I don't think they're gonna be able to receive me so I might as well leave Egypt he was going off his mama's experience he's going off his mama's testimony of who he was hallelujah and and even though he had Mama's testimony it was not enough to stabilize Moses when the pressure came when them brothers say what you gonna do kill us like you're kill of the other Gyptian Moses decided in time take off running but when it came back with a stick in his hand hallelujah there was nobody strong enough to push Moses Amen off the scene a man he had his own personal testimony his own experience with God our complex is something you build yourself now let me just kind of go back I'll come back to that in just a second oh no I'm a sadist now I'm a sadist now this complex it's something that brother Branham had oh my he built it himself he was having a problem with the people he just couldn't get him to line up with the word of God call them Ricky's Andrew Kenneth and and all kind of names and God told say don't you know he told he told he brother Branham used to preach to say if you got a child named Ricky change the name you say change name they say because names Kerry speaking spirits and he says say I would never call my mother my child Ricky I think Ricky meant rat that's something like that say don't call it don't call it the child Ricky so he said he wouldn't even say he kept calling the people Ricky's and Rick ettus hallelujah he built a complex he forgot the feeling of the people now you know there's a time brother branham gave a testimony about a young girl and I want to read just a little bit about her this has come out a message an uncertain sound coming out of the message an uncertain sound hallelujah it says this says just come in from California the other day hadn't gotten my suitcase in hadn't been home for two months right at two months he says I got about the second suitcase in the phone ring it was a lady well she used to be the kind kind of a girl friend of mine years ago when I used to pastor the Milltown Baptist Church now I want y'all to understand what brother Branham just said he's been away from his family for two months he just got home I'm packing his suitcases and a telephone call comes let me tell you something you don't even realize the responsibility that goes with the anointing amen people don't realize the responsibility that goes with the North you don't realize the sacrifice that must be made when you when you're carrying the anointing hallelujah most folks just and stent here but it's what happens when you get back home that's what really matters the reason people support you here is because what they see oh yeah hallelujah the Prophet here a man just getting home been away for two months and his phone rings now now now most of us if it was our house we'll say just let it ring yeah especially nowadays you got caller ID you can see who callin we'll just let it go to voicemail and then they call back let it go to voicemail they cut let it go - I know they need something but I I'm a packing my suitcase you can't be that way when you're carrying the anointing you got to pick up the phone night or day you got to pick up the phone no matter what they got to say pick up the telephone oh Jesus hallelujah look at this it says well she used to be a girlfriend of mine years ago when I used to pass in a midtown Baptist Church she had two lovely daughters she married a fine man a brother huff now this is another one just to help some of the some of the saints out a man brother branham say this girl lady used to be a girlfriend of her he didn't marry her so it's okay if you don't marry the person glory to God and you if they don't work out it is okay brother Branham went through that all right I'm just leaving it out there people people feel like they got to get men oh you don't a man know what you're getting yourself into all right he says brother huff and he was a meal right he had it one of his fingers and thumbs cut off a very nice brother and they had two twins and another girl making three children and the twins were staunch Christians see III I like that word we need start creatures vote that enemies just move by whatever come this other girl wasn't staunch now look at this says that the twins a man they were starts Christians they were ube people but they really how they really believe God if so one little girl going to school she got a complex the girls tell her well why don't you smoke like we do you think you better than we are why don't you go to dances now they didn't go to dances neither did they smoke smoke a drink and they made fun the healthier girl she said when you try help you're spiritually healthy the healthier girl she said who let them jump in the river I'm the one serving Christ so she freedom I stand you wanna smoke you wanna drink you go do that on your own you ain't got nothin to do with it that's what I starch Christian will say hallelujah but somebody's a little weak and wishy-washy look at what happens now says let him trumpeter I'm the one I'm the one serving Christ they don't want to let him go ahead and we need people like that they said by the little but the other one she began to think so just by her beginning to think she actually had a complex that she was developing it was something in her own mind says oh maybe I could do something and she built a complex got nervous she went insane and I want you to notice that just by building a complex just by saying you know what you know these people think that we better him I'm not better than I can just be amongst them I can just be with them I can do this I can do that building a complex not even realizing it amen and she got that and she begin to compromise the girl lost her mind through compromising and I noticed the people that brought her out there they still doing exactly what they was doing but the one that went amongst them lost her mind loss of mine look at this she the one went to the insane institution so they had her in an institution two years and so they was trying to doctor her by giving a little little kinds of stuff in treatments and everything it didn't work now so I was I was looking at this a man this young lady I couldn't read the quote is quite long to view if you want to go back in and beyond the screen on certain sounds you can go back in just and and just just just listen to the message to read the quote but I just kind of took it in that and and summarized a little bit but this this young lady built the complex because of the peer pressure that she was under she and her sisters were real strong Christians but she began to listen to the outside influences and by listening to the outside influences she developed a complex that complex caused her to end up in isolation because complexes will do that complexes the complex caused Moses to go to the backside of the desert isolation Jesus help us brother branham was also thinking about going to the to the to the wilderness isolation complexes will cause people to go into isolation amen he or she was an isolation in an insane institution but what happened is that they called for the Prophet to come he pick up picked up the telephone call and I went when he went a man down to the house and and met with the family he rode down to this insane institution with with the other two daughters the two twins there was in the car with brother branham and then also the mom and dad was in another colony they took going down to this institution to go talk to the that the youngest daughter and when they got down there a man as they were on the way brother branham just began to talk with the girls in the car just having a conversation with him and and the girls just began to say you know brother branham at church today pastor was talking and all of a sudden the Holy Spirit just turned and he began to start talking about healing and he was just really talk about healing and we knew that you were coming so when they started talk about healing it was a confirmation to us that God was gonna do so say mom and start crying and daddy start crying we start crying in church because we knew God was gonna do so if the girl said say say brother branham you thank God gonna do somebody say well let's just wait and see let's just wait and see what the Lord does so when they went on down there to the insane institution brother Branham beginning to talk to the girl him and it says sister you remember me I'm I'm bill Branham the girl just looking at him like she crazy couldn't couldn't figure out who he was I'm bill Branham you don't remember me said I remember you as a little child he was dis she was that he said he kept talking to it trying to pick up her spirits hallelujah and the girl just was not responding to him and then I finally say he felt the Spirit of God come in and a vision showed up Oh glory glory glory glory now I remember I read you earlier a man how brother branham identified the minister of Jesus Christ when he told Philip who he was when he told Nathaniel who he was when he told Peter who he was he said that was the ministry that identified God was gonna raise up a prophet like unto Moses it was identified in Jesus Christ when he begin to share the secrets of the heart that same ministry was identified in brother Branham because he told this young lady say now you know you might not remember me he says but I remember you as a young say say the Lord just showed me that you had a desire in your heart as a young girl that was going to marry a preacher and say soon as he told a girl that something snapped on the inside of her hallelujah you had a design your heart that she was gonna raise up and marry a preacher hallelujah just that little information nobody else knew that but that girl knew soon as that was revealed to her she was set free from the spirit that had her in bondage the complex that that she had developed now she got delivered because a secret of her heart was revealed I am praying that God will again begin to reveal the secrets of people's hearts then they will know that God is on the scene she was delivered from a complex because of the secret of her heart being revealed Moses was given two sides throw the rock down pick it up put your hand and your bosom pull it out brother Branham was also given two sides one was touch people with your hand and you'll be able to tell what their troubles is that was his first pull then the second pull was that he would have the ability to reveal the secrets of the heart that was his second pool to science but also God gave brother Branham a man another level he says you're gonna also have a third pool which would be the opening of the word every mystery according to revelation 10 7 will be revealed by this ministry oh how I love the Lord Jesus brother branham developed a complex he developed a complex his ministry was to come before judgment moses ministry came before god brought judgment to egypt brother branham's ministry was to come according to Malachi chapter four verse five and six amen we'll read it real quick it says behold I will send you Elijah the Prophet before the great and dreadful day of the Lord that is a day of judgment so so before judgment God promises to send a prophetic sign before judgment verse six a man says and he shall turn the heart of the father's to the children and the heart of children to their fathers lest I come and smite the earth with a curse we can see a man Moses ministry we can get excited about how God used Moses but there's other scriptures that God is also manifesting a man in Malachi four five and six was applied for this day by God's thinness Elijah a man before this last 3,000 years I mean last 2,000 years where this this this last another judgment is about to strike the earth we're we're actually feeling some of the signs of it right now but you know brother Branham had a complex just like Moses had a complex that caused him to go to the desert and get met by burning bush amen brother Brandon himself had a complex and he was losing the feeling for the people glory to God now I want to read this is going to take us a little time so y'all just y'all just bear with me on this amen let me just see how far I can go with it oh my this is gonna be important I want to read this I'm gonna start it for a standing in the gap paragraph 115 amen I'm gonna just read it to you I can tell it to you but i'ma read it to you and just let you catch it it's good to catch Moses but we got to catch the day that we live in it's good to thank God for what happened in Noah's day but we better catch the day that we live in in look at this is this he coming to the restaurant and order some pancake there was about 15 20 people he had to sneeze you know some people will a brother brother brother Bramblett brother branham imitates a stifling sneeze says part of me but he let out a great big healthy would sneeze her Chewie you know it says my looked like the windows blasted when he did nobody dare say nothing no sir said Billy there's a man after my own heart he said all daddy you don't want to be like that so that's what that that's me in the future see I said that's me brother branham's already calling out what his future gonna be he gonna be a wilderness man he's leaving the ministry and he's gonna working he's going to the wilderness and just hunt all the time only come out and speak when he feel led to speak look at this so you can do what you want to do hey man it's not it's not your life is not your own but it belongs to God he says nice at there a little bit and Billy looked up at me kept on eating his pancakes now this is during the time brother branham got this complex says and I was finished mine in a few minutes somebody in a booth right around right around front of us with the board's this way and and back back back of the booth I couldn't see around a man got up that looked exactly my profile about 75 years old a little bitty fella his clothes tied on a rag and the Buddy that got up with them was was Fletcher brought exactly gray hair hanging in his face and Billy looked around said daddy that looks like you inflection that when brother when Billy says this brother branham had already had a dream about him and Fletcher being like this one they stand around a campfire he say if brother Brett got a tone say with your complex if you go on with your plans your wife gonna leave you he says you're gonna be standing around a campfire and pretty much all the things that I've used you for him and have I bless you all that stuff would be forgotten a man you won't just be coming out of the wilderness when you want to come out say my aunts are to leave you everything to be going if you're going with your plans hallelujah look at this he says close tight on me and him ragged and the buddy that got up with him Fletcher boy exactly gray hair hanging in his face and Billy look around said dad dad looks like you're Fletcher you can imagine how I felt and a little fella look look like me wobbled up says they had been standing over a campfire with smoke all over them faces dirty I think they're breakfast together the man must have had must have paid 20 cents maybe a cup of coffee or something my heart bounced within me I watched and Billy said what's the matter with you I said nothing and I watched and if they went around and went out he said daddy what's the matter I said nothing he's got and he got in the car said he said do you mind driving again I said no he said I'm still sleepy so he went to sleep and I went speed down the road about 55 miles an hour in the truck over the mountains coming on towards the border now coming out coming home to Arizona and but I was coming now into Utah and as I got there coming down from the mountains about 20 miles out of City just heard it as I told you about about the morning about the squirrels and all these things how something somebody went to talking to me a voice just the same as you hear my not notice how brother I'm saying somebody went to talking to me if we can believe that a voice spoke to Moses out of a bush then we can also believe brother branham was talking to that same God while he was driving down the street in his car Sarah Mary went to talking to me a voice just the same as you hear mine I know it sounds neurotically but as I've got through expressing have I ever told you anything but what was right and a voice got to talking and I was talking to him it said carry out your plans and you'll be like that I said lord I don't want to be like that said your wife will go - she won't live up there in them heels like that you'll become a bum just a shoot at just as the dream showed you would I said I don't want to be that I want to be I don't want to live like that I don't have to live like that I don't want to do something different but I was told that you had called me to be a prophet not brother branham is starting to reason God now this statements gonna be very very important as we come up to it just get his reason with God he's still in his complex right and his reason guy says you you know I was told that you had called me to be a prophet and I want to live in the wilderness like the prophets but I was using my own excuse so I could hunt my own good God can read through that I'm looking at what God tell the Prophet and he said but that was the prophets of the Old Testament you've been called to be there in a much higher office than that how are you office than what Moses Act now you think about that one because we can believe Moses we can rejoice over Moses but the Prophet that God sent you call you he was called to a higher office than what all Old Testament prophets had and I'm gonna tell you why he was called to higher office because he's introducing Messiah you've been called to be up there in a much higher office in that he said you have more gifts besides that you was called to pray for the sick not only that and to preach the gospel and in the apostolic forum you know of greater things many great yes so how do you why do you wait for me to movie every time you move where's your reward then I seen and then I said do you remember I told you do you remember what brother Robeson told you in your dream in his dream or vision that you had done like Moses you forgot the feeling of your people you forgot the call that I called you to I let the sick lay I want the Lord to tell me where to go and not to that's wrong I had built myself a complex because the people did hear my message and if God forbid that I'll try to compare the life of now like Moses but it's exactly what Moses did a man my god exactly what Moses did the people were listening to him when he come to deliver them so he just left them alone and went into the wilderness but God turned him around and he had long forgot the suffering he long forgot the suffering people he says and then I said Lord how could I that's right with no education that's the same excuses that Moses used I can't speak I came this I came that since with no education with a grammar school education be able and the people are standing and rose and everywhere to hear the simple gospel it's more it's greater now than it was under the Old Covenant he is sending on high he gave gifts unto man Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever then I was talking I heard of talking to me and it left me Moses had a complex brother Branham had a complex we all get complexes but I tell you what it doesn't stop God from manifesting himself in our lives amen the reason Moses on the backside of that desert is because of the complex that put him there brother Branham was on his way to the to the wilderness to the backside of the desert because of a complex that was putting there that girl went to a insane institution because of a complex that put there but God had a prophetic voice to go to the insane institution pull that girl out God also had a prophetic voice to come to us to pull us out of our insane institutions denominations hallelujah pulled us out hallelujah amen and we're free because God has set us free I want to tell you something church listen and obey the prophetic sign that God has sent us before judgment thank God for his prophetic sign god bless you let's pray over the word of the Lord father I thank your God your words Lord Jesus it's really your word is true God we can we can go back and pick up the Bible as many have picked up their Bible and just looked at Exodus chapter 3 today and told the story of Moses and what happened at the burning bush the Lord can they see a prophet but their day come and Lord a man according to scripture God to bring a truth to the people to bring them out Lord and and and just as Moses even said the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet like unto me brother Branham identifies Jesus Christ as that prophet that was like unto Moses and we can see it clearly in Scripture we believe that but the way he identifies him is through a man the ability Lord to reveal the secrets of the heart God and how we saw the same thing manifested in your prophet today revealing the secrets of the heart that one girl they're 18 years old stuck in an insane institution because she let down the bars father of Lord of her convictions she caught a complex and it drove her crazy a demon drove a crazy got because she let down the bars one time Oh God but a prophet went in with a mind of Christ the sermon of spirit Lord that second pool ministry manifesting itself Lord and that girl and one sit reveal that she she had a desire when she was a young woman to marry a preacher that was her desire that was in her heart and maybe she looked at a condition and she said how am I gonna do it in this insane institution but God went when the word came forth and it set her free Lord she left that institution I pray that same word with come forth and set captives free Lord many of us have complexes many of us have things that we're going through and maybe we've let down the bars maybe we have given in and and by giving in Lord to some of the things that people have placed on us God amen now we're dealing with things that we never thought we'd deal with but God you're able to set us free just as you set that girl free I pray Lord Jesus that this message would be a message of freedom and liberation now your your word God would do the work even for those that are listening in on the stream got me the word go forth and do the work in their hearts set them free from every complex God Lord is my prayer me anointing just fall upon him right now God set the captive free Jesus Oh God we want to be found in the ark we don't want to be found outside Lord I kind of trying to get in and and the rain is falling we don't want to be too late God you send prophetic signs before you send judgment help us to be spiritual and catch look what you've done in this hour let us run for safety God is our prayer in the name of Jesus we ask it amen amen praise the Lord thank you Jesus hallelujah see how say yes Lord I agree my desire here passionately is to be what you've called me

like that not going off of just Mama's testimony but when he come in contact with you on the backside of the desert Lord and had that burning bush experience it was a different man that's what we need
