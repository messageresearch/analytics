planning on being here tonight but uh the lord had planned it so we appreciate the lord for his grace um i'm not gonna waste any of your time let's just get straight into the word whilst you're standing i don't know whether they've got my slides ready but i want to just yeah wonderful in the book of hebrews um we we're gonna look um starting from verse 13. the bible says for when god made promise to abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely blessing our bless thee and multiplying or multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured you obtained the promise for men verily swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation is to them and end of all strife wherein god willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his council confirmed it by an oath that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for god to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast and which entereth into that within the veil appreciate the lord for the word father this is your word we ask you that you can now grant us a context in jesus christ's name amen we may be seated um just want to take a title and for a title i want to speak on anchored by a sworn promise amen anchored by a sworn promise and for an objective i want to be looking at possessing your enemy's gate amen i don't know what your enemy is tonight i don't know what satan has robbed you off i don't know what you desire before god is but i'm one person that believes that when i come to church i must command expectation i can't come to church and expect to go out the same there's got to be a change nobody ever met the lord jesus christ and remained the same if he came across a sick somebody they go healed if he came across a dead person they resurrected whatever the situation was when god stepped into it there had to be a change and i believe coming to church is coming to an encounter with your god so when you come for an encounter with your god there's got to be a change so i want to believe tonight that if you're under expectation there's going to be a change in your life so i don't know what it is that you came for we sing the song i don't know what you came for amen but i came to possess i came to take what god wants me to have can you say amen praise the lord let me just start by reading what the prophet of god says in this story and the message the infallible word of god he said i said wait there was a king one time that had a great kingdom and he made all the rules and laws he was a just man a man of honor and he made rules and penalties of punishment and so forth and one day a slave committed a crime he was brought up before the king and the king said my law reads here that you must die for this penalty i have to take your head and the poor fellow began shaking and he said what can i do for you before i have your head taken and he said a glass of water so they give the slave the water and he was shaking so hard he couldn't hold the water he said now before i take your life you drink the water or i won't take your life until you drink the water and the slave threw the water on the ground i said now what is the man going to do his law says that the man must die but his word said that he is not going to take the man's life before he drinks the water and he can't drink the water now what all right let's pack that and we will come back to it amen praise the lord i believe on a wednesday it's normally a bible study right so we're just going to have a little bible study and then just a bit of a little preaching amen so hebrews chapter 6 the scripture says for when god made promise to abraham because he could sway by no greater he swear by himself for men verily swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife now here in verse 13 we find that paul brings the aspect of god swearing yes and he says god saw by himself now this swearing that paul is referring to here the full statement it actually means swearing an oath all right yeah yes to say he swore is just a shortcut all right but the full statement is actually swearing an oath and this is what paul says when you look at um your head just just step back yeah this is what paul says in verse 16. in verse 16 here he says and an oath yeah let me just be sure that this is working right praise the lord so he says and an oath for confirmation yeah so he's talking about swearing someone swears by a greta but he says for men very this way by the greater and an ought for confirmation so the swearing is actually the swearing of an oath now this is very common at law and in this country i think the most common application of this is when your senators take office or when the president takes office that they've got to take the the out of office isn't it they've got to swear the oath of office yeah now when they're taking office they've got the option of either swearing the author of office or they can affirm the oath of office now the difference between swearing and an affirmation swearing is known as swearing an oath that's the full statement an oath is a form of words spoken by a person to promise that they are telling the truth an auth refers to the god recognized by the religion of the person swearing the oath on the other hand an affirmation has the same legal effect as an oath but it does not refer to god now this is the difference between an affirmation and a swearing when you are swearing you are referring this back to the god of the religion that the person who is swearing if it's an affirmation it does not refer to any god all right now and the reason why they bring this to god in in this respect it is because you are saying the consequences of me not telling the truth let it go to god and let god deal with me and that's the reason why they actually swear and you also find the prophet many times he sways an oath as he's preaching you hear him say in in jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he says you remember it's not me i say with my hand on my bible over my heart it is not me what the prophet is actually saying in this statement is i'm swearing an oath it is not me with my hand on the bible over my heart it is not me that that's actually swearing in earth and what he's saying by by doing that he's saying what i'm saying now is the absolute truth and if this is not true then let the god of my religion take responsibility over this statement if it means i die let me die right on the spot if it is not true then let me die and be utterly lost through eternity never to be found again that's what it actually means to swear an earth and that's why paul then comes and he says that this is the end of all strife hebrews chapter 6 he says for men verily swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife why because if they respect their religion then they would never get to a place where they will swear and say let god deal with me when they know their god is real they can only lie if they know their god is not real but when you know your god is real and you are saying i'm taking this to my god and i'm saying this before god so i'm swearing this before god and that's why paul says when you swear an earth it should end all strife so as christians when we come to a place where we are now saying i'm holding my bible and this is the truth before my god if you're a true christian what you're actually saying is this must end all strife if you want to know whether i'm saying the truth or not when i come to my god i mean exactly what i say glory allow me to get rid of this praise the lord and that's why he says now it's an end of all strife but paul also says right here that men verily swear i'm still on that one verily swear by the greater so when men are swearing we swear by somebody that is greater yes and in reality what you're actually saying when you're swearing by one that is greater you are saying i'm passing the responsibility of my statement to that one that is greater and that is why you have to sway by one that is greater you are saying the one that i'm swearing by is the guarantor of my statements amen hallelujah so the finality of the guarantors of statements is got to be god so when when man is swearing they swirl by somebody that is they swear by somebody that is greater but when it comes to the finality of it then it comes to god and when men swear now by god he's the greatest now but paul says here when god made promise to abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself amen so paul is now telling us that when it came to god god wanted to swear but when god wanted to swear he looked on his left and there was no greater he looked on his right and there was no greater he looked in front of him and there was no greater he looked behind him there was no greater he looked above and there was nobody he looked underneath and there was no greater and then god finally says because i can't find nobody greater i can only tend to myself so then he swore by himself and this is why you find in the book of isaiah 46 he says i am god and there is none besides me i am god and there is none else in other words i've got no one that is greater when i swear i can't transfer the liability of my statement to anyone else because i'm the ultimate so he then tend to himself and he swore by himself glory then paul goes ahead to tell us why god saw here why was god swearing amen now in god's swearing the bible tells us he wanted in verse 17 he wanted wearing god willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of the promise the immutability of his cancer so the reason why god then swore according to paul is he wanted to show us the immutability of his cancer then he confirmed it by an oath now this word immutable it means the state of not changing or being unable to be changed so when god wanted to show us the immutability of his counsel what he was actually saying is that i want to show you the state that this cannot be changed immutable is the state of not changing or being unable to be changed now it is one thing for something to be for for one not to change but it's another for that one not to be changed by an external force all right all right now immutable is the state of not changing but it is also the state of not being able to be changed and that's why in the book of malachi chapter 3 6 the bible says i am the lord and i change not in other words i fulfill that part the first part but in isaiah 46 10 then he says my counsel will stand and i shall do all my pleasure in other words when you read that scripture he says i am god and there is none besides me i'm god and there is no one else then he says declaring the end of a thing from its beginning and from ancient times the things that shall be saying my counsel shall stand and i'll do all my pleasure in other words what god was saying is i'm gonna tell you the end from today and i'll give you six thousand years satan go do whatever you want to do run as fast as you want jump as high as you want go wherever you're gonna go but you're not gonna be able to change because my statement cannot be changed it is immutable i can't change it he can't change it no devil can change it that's immutable so when god speaks praise be to god what is speaking amen it gets into the realm of immutability in other words no devil nothing can come around and can change what god has already done so god wanted to show the immutability the unchanging nature praise the lord of what he had said so he swore by himself amen and paul tells us when exactly that god swore when did god swear he was swearing let's read hebrews chapter 6 verse 13 he says for when god made promise to abraham because he could swear by no greater his word by himself so this is when god was making a promise to abraham amen so he swore when he made a promise to abraham amen now paul takes here an aspect of what god says to abraham in verse 14 and he says surely in blessing i'll bless thee and multiplying our multiply thee and paul then leaves it there and it doesn't give us the full context of what god said in genesis so if we want to get the full context then we go to the book of genesis in the book of genesis chapter 22 then we read the full statement praise god and the angel of the lord called unto abram out of heaven the second time and said by myself have i sworn sayest the lord for because thou has done this thing and has not withheld thy son thine only son that in blessing i'll bless thee and in multiplying i'll multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the sea show and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies so watch church he he he swore when he was making this promise to abraham and watch i highlight this was when he was dealing with abraham when he was giving a promise to abraham but i want you to watch something here though the reason for his swearing was speaking to abraham but i want you to watch something very interesting here though the swearing was addressing abraham but yet the target of it was not abraham well i love the word he is speaking to abraham but the target is not abraham what do you mean preach i mean verse 17 he says wherein god willing more abundantly to show unto the airs of promise so he is speaking to abraham but the ones that he wants to show the immutability of his counsel is not abraham he is now looking at the heirs of the promise oh praise the lord so though he's speaking to abraham but the target hallelujah that's where he wants to show they meet a bullet of his counsel it is not abraham he was looking now at the seed of abraham and we are the seed of abraham through jesus we become the seed of abraham so he was looking at you and i so when god saw to abraham the target was not abraham the target was not in that year but the target was in 2022 he was looking at somebody that is in spirit and truth tabernacle he was looking at somebody that is in florida here and he was saying i'm giving you this as the confirmation of the immutability of my counsel amen glory glory amen praise the lord amen hallelujah so it's not targeted to abraham but god wanted to show it to the seed of abraham amen and then the target being the seed of abraham and we we are the seed of abraham so we are the heirs to this praise the lord now when god did this he then turns to two things as the scripture says that by two immutable things in which it is impossible for god to lie amen the word is so sweet now the scripture says that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for god to lie now where are the two things because when i read the scripture it tells me that god saw by himself but when paul says it he says there are two immutable things so where are the two because the scripture only says god swore now to understand where the two are coming from we go back to what swearing is all about now when one is swearing there are two things that are happening there is a statement which is the words that you are saying this is the truth and then after you have said the words or somebody has read the words whatever it is then there is the swearing part which is when you lift up your hands and when they are taking an oath of office then they put one hand on the bible and they lift up the other hand that is the swearing amen but the swearing does not come on its own the swearing comes first with words that are spoken so in swearing there is two things already there is the statement glory to god which is the wording that you are saying this is the truth and then there is the action which is the actual swearing so two things happen when you are swearing so god hallelujah wanting to show the immediate bullet of his counsel he turned to these two things what was the first thing in swearing there is the word so which means god was take turning to his word first and then after his word then he turns to the actual action i don't know what god did on that day glory but if we would see a vision i believe glory to god god showed a sign hallelujah to say i am swearing now after i've made a statement and then paul says in the two things that it is impossible for god to lie what is the first thing in which is impossible for god to lie god cannot lie about his word praise the lord and god once he swears he cannot alter what he has sworn so the two immutable things in which is it impossible for god to lie so the first one being his word when god has spoken his word barricades him now i'm back to the first thing that i read the story of that king when that king had given his word to this slave and he said to this slave you drink this water or else i will not be able to kill you and then now the slave because it's shaking he throws the water and the glass on the floor and there is no more water to drink and the question now is asked what is this king going to do the king has already said i cannot kill you that is the word of the king what is higher praise the lord the laws of the land or the word of the king what is the king going to do now so the king had to let the man go why because the king cannot lie his word cannot be reversed so is it the same church tonight with the king of glory when the king of glory gives his word he cannot reverse on his word he cannot backslide on his word he cannot change his word once he gives it it has already gone it can only return unto him after it is accomplished that which it purposes before it accomplishes it cannot return oh glory to god amen so when god speaks he's barricaded by the words that he has spoken and god is not a man that he should change his mind god is not a man that he should lie about his word and brother sister when god speaks it is impossible for him to lie it is enough just to have his word oh praise the lord but though it is enough for us to have his word on that day to abraham god then turned to the second thing then he lifted up his hands i can almost see him praise the lord now swearing that by myself i am now swearing that this that i have said praise the lord it is going to happen and the target as i said was actually the heirs of the promise hebrews chapter 6 he says he swore by himself why that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for god to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us which hope we have as an anchor of the soul but sure and steadfast and which enter it into that within the veil so why is god swearing that by two immutable things we might layer hold hallelujah and then when we lay hold we will then be anchored so we can layer hold praise the lord we can take hold on that which god has already said so i can finish right here god tend to these two immutable things and the target of what he was doing was not abraham he was dealing with you and i and why is god turning to this too so that we when we now hear what god spoke on that day we can lay a hold on that and we can have a strong consolation and we can be anchored praise the lord we can find our anchor and we can say if god say this it is his word number one if god swore on this then this is a finnish thing we can be anchored church when a ship is anchored it cannot go anywhere when a ship is anchored it does not mean that it is now out of stormy waters it does not mean that the waves are no longer coming out the waves might still be there but when the ship is got an anchor let the storms arise let the belows rise let whatever come but the ship is got an anchor it is going nowhere oh glory to god those forces might be there but the sheep is got an anchor when a believer a true child of god when they found their anchor it don't matter what they're going through in life it don't matter what is happening in their life it don't matter what the situation is you can say come rain come sunshine i'll be in the message come next year come whatever come he believe the sign and whatever i'll be in the message why because i found my anchor i'm anchored in the world i found my refuge i'm anchored in the world i'm not in there i'm not a believer because i have not seen a certain trial but no matter what the storm is going to be no matter what the trial is going to be i found my anchor and i'm resting solid praise be to god in jesus christ i got an income when a seed of abraham is anchored brother they are unmovable now god turned to two immutable things to show the immutability of his counsel so god turned to his word first right god tend to his word first which is what he would say to abraham that's the first thing that he turned to now what do we know about the word of god peter writing he says unto your faith at virtue unto your virtue ed knowledge amen and what is that knowledge the prophet of god in the stature of a perfect man he says you judge whether the word is right or wrong and if you can lay aside all your creeds and all your unbelief everything that you claim you have done then you have knowledge to believe that god cannot lie let every man's word be a lie but mind be true see now you are getting knowledge that's supreme knowledge what is supreme knowledge it is when you get a level where you know that god cannot lie it is when you get to a level when you know that if i read a scripture this scripture is a reality it is when you get to a level that when you hear the prophet speak praise be to god you can rest your soul upon it oh come on church what we need is a supreme knowledge that one statement is enough for god hallelujah god don't need to tell me twice about the thing that i'm looking for if i find one caught that should be enough if i find one scripture that should be enough god cannot lie or glory to god then you can be anchored on what god has said praise god in the highest you can rest your soul on just that one statement i like what the prophet of god says he says talking of the lord jesus christ that the reason why he say destroy this temple and i'll raise it up in three days he says he was resting on just one promise and what was that one promise i will not suffer i will not leave my my son in hell or suffer my holy one to see corruption he says that's all that jesus was resting on he did not have anything else he knew that god said he would not leave his son in hell or suffer his holy one to see corruption that was enough now brother sister we don't have one scripture we've got scripture upon scripture we got caught upon quota we got taped up on paper how much more or we do find the perfect anchor in what god has already said to us oh glory to god now god he swore by himself but i want you to look when god swore this was very specific amen he was dealing with a specific thing genesis chapter 22 the bible says and he said by myself have i sworn says the lord for because thou has done this thing and has not withheld thy sign then only son that in blessing i'll bless thee and in multiplying i'll multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the sea i want you to watch this first part god is dealing with abraham he's speaking to abraham but when he now comes to the second part thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies now he's no longer dealing with abraham he is finished with abraham i'm going to bless you and i'm going to multiply your sin there shall be as the the stars of the heaven this is your part abraham but now i'm dealing with those that are coming in 2022. i'm dealing with those that are gonna be reading this word in 2022 and what is my word to those praise the lord thy seed which is these people here shall possess the gate of his enemy and this is what god turned to two immutable things in which it was impossible for him to lie glory to god so when god wanted to show us the immutability of this promise what promise that you shall possess the gate of your enemy he turned to two things in which it was impossible for him to lie he turned to his word and he says i've given you my word of promise i'm barricaded by my own word this cannot change then he swore and he says thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemy therefore let me say to you tonight possessing the gate of your enemy is not an if it's a wind did you get what i said possessing your enemy's gate is not an if if you possess no it's not an if it is a win because as for it happening god swore by himself and god cannot lie god tends to do things in which it is impossible for him to lie this is immutable glory to god he says now what i am saying here it shall happen therefore let me say to you tonight possessing the case of your enemy it is going to happen i don't care how long you have suffered i don't care how long you have waited i don't care how high the mountain is i don't care how much it looks impossible but i want to tell you if god turned to two things in which it is impossible for him to lie he's not gonna start lying with you he's not going to start lying with your situation therefore tonight i can tell you you shall possess the gate of your enemy i don't know what you came to church for but you can possess the gate of your enemy i don't know what your challenge in your life is but you can possess the gate of your enemy pray spirit of god in the highest when the seed of abraham recognizes that when it comes to possessing the gate of my enemy this is a sworn promise you can be anchored in that you can anchor your soul you can say you know what i can afford to be reckless in faith what do you mean preacher man the prophet of god says now joshua in all this knowing that the command was great but having the assurance he could be fearless he could be as we call it reckless as long as he was pointed in the right way he might break up against a hill that would knock him backwards but he was carried the right way so can the church of the living god be reckless and fearless in faith if we are pointed the right way i want to say we are pointed the right way because god tends to two things in which it is impossible for him to lie we have the word of promise and we have his sworn statement praise the lord oh hallelujah if a president of united states of america can swear and out of office and can hold to that office what more of the king of glory when he swore and he says your seed shall possess the gate of his enemy brother sister you can afford to be reckless on that you can afford to go all the way on that you can face every enemy believing amen that it is gonna be done oh come on church of the living god come on church of the living god you can afford to be reckless with faith hallelujah when we can look at the seed of abraham that we find in the bible we can now begin to understand those that understood that god swore god gave his word they could afford to be reckless now i can understand my brother caleb together with his friend joshua that when they went to spy the land when the others came back and they were shaking and they were quivering because of the giants that they had seen let me tell you it's not like there were no giants the giants were there the walls were there with chariots running on top of the walls it was a fearful spectacle but brother sister caleb hallelujah he said i'm not looking at the giants up i'm looking at a sworn promise i can anchor my soul upon what god said i'm not looking at how high the walls are i'm not looking at how big the giants are i'm looking at how big the god that make the promise is oh come on church of the living god tonight don't look at how big your problem is that sister that is going for a procedure don't look at how big the problem is you can only look hallelujah at the promise of the living god i'll never leave you no forsake you but i'll be with you right through to the end of the world don't look at your challenge look at the god that is with you look at the promise that is standing with you let every man's word be a liar but my word be the truth praise the lord so caleb could say the giants be there my way to hinder but god will surely give me the victory oh hallelujah i might be 85 years old but i still have strength within me but to go in and to come out now joshua give me my mountain i want my mountain i wish somebody tonight can recognize that this is mountain taking time this is possessing gates time you can also say to joshua the holy ghost tonight i won my mountain huh i'm not gonna let the service call before i receive my mountain i'm telling you giants get off my land oh you can give that devil a notice right now you can give that devil a notice right now he's been sitting on your mountain for too long but enough is enough things that gotta turn around things that gotta change at a certain point it can't always be this way there's gotta come a time when there will be a change in life and i'm here to announce i believe in spiritual food that comes in juice season tonight is someone's season i don't know who his season it is let it be my season lord let it be my season lord but it's got to be someone's season amen you can be reckless when you know that god swore i can understand my brother david praise the lord in the eyes but when he gets to the valley and he sees oh israel is shaking because there is a giant that is standing somewhere and everyone is afraid because of the size they are looking at this man and they are saying how big he is but david looked at the man and he says oh i can see what the whole all of them are seeing but i can also see something else that they are not seeing i can see the promise of my god i can see god say that we can possess the gates of our enemies who is this uncircumcised philistine that is defying the armies of the living god he looked at that giant the giant came and he says i'm gonna feed you to the beds and david says you liar your head is coming off you liar look at your enemy in the face tonight speak to your mountain and tell you you liar you have been around me for much too long but i know who you are you liar your head is coming off this is my season this is my time this is my period hallelujah i'm stepping in to possess what god gave me our david was looking at this goliath and david says who is this uncircumcised philistine by that he was saying i am circumcised and by being circumcised he was saying i'm a seed of abraham and by saying i'm a seed of abraham he was saying god swore to father abraham all glory to god that the seed of abraham shall possess the gate of the enemy they tried to say oh this man he has been trained right from these youth and you are only just but a young man he says yes i might not be trained in the weapons of this warfare which are these kind of weapons but i'm trained in the word of the lord or tonight church of the living god we might not be trained in anything else but we are trained in malachi first gospel we are trained in the word of the living god the weapons of our warfare they are not canal but they are mighty through god even to the pulling down of strongholds and i want to say tonight let strongholds come down i don't know what your stronghold is but let that stronghold come down i don't know what your pedal is tonight but let that stronghold come down i don't know what mountain you want to possess but let me finish by coming to this to say possess your mountain possess your gator if there is anything that you got to take out of this service you gotta take a super faith a super anointing praise the lord that you'll be able to look at satan in the face and say after tonight things cannot remain the same i'm taking what is mine my children are mine my grandchildren are mine my parents are mine my mama is mine i'm going out with all that god gave me not a hoof is remaining speak like moses of oda and say we are going with our we are going with our order we are going with our cattle there is not a hoof that shall remain behind let me finish by reading this quarter if you have got an enemy tonight i'm just reading our situation into it if you've got an enemy tonight if you are a seed of abraham after hearing this there is not enough devils in hell can keep that gate before you it will open now this is the words of the prophet and i believe this prophet was anointed i believe this is the word of the living god after hearing this there is not enough devils in hell there is not enough gates hallelujah that will stand before you after hearing what that god swore he turned to two things in which it is impossible for god to lie hallelujah there is not enough devils in hell can keep that gate before you it will open let me say it's opening right now i don't care what it is you walk up there as a promised seed say i claim this for mine this is mine because god swore that you raise up jesus and through jesus i would conquer it i come in the name of that conqueror jesus christ step back i'm passing through amen he shall possess the gauge of the enemy then stand up there with your shoulders back and your shield are shining covered by the blood of the lord jesus the enemy will recognize it yes tonight the enemy is already recognizing it now i don't want you to leave your enemy where he is now possess the gate of your enemy now possess the gate of your enemy i'm gonna stop right here but i want you to possess the gate of your enemy your enemy is now in your hands this is a sworn statement it is not an ether it is a win hallelujah but the when you can define when the wind is supposed to be you can say let it be tonight you can say i've waited for too long you can trigger it to start happening right now how many believe this tonight so your enemies in your hands praise be to god your enemies in your hands i told you to give him a notice a few minutes ago i

mouth and amen i'd be anchored by that sometimes the devil just said a little bit too long on what belongs to us and sometimes you got to drive them off amen you know if the children of israel would have never got an action they would have just stayed the people just stayed and they land but they had to get an action and go drive them devils off if this is what god promised me i'm sorry he didn't promise to you but i'm taking what god gave me amen we got to get an action church i i thank god for the word tonight i thank god for the word [Applause] so much amen so much in that and as brother brother whispers saying just you know you can just imagine god looking around no no one he can look to so he swore by himself and and you know and all we have is just our imagination as to what we do here in the u.s we lift our hand and you know and put a hand up and i think his right hand on the bible right and then the left hand up in the air can you imagine god doing something like that but he don't have a bible like this but he has his word that he releases out of his mouth and that word is just as amen just as real is what you see on the pages of the bible oh my god swears by himself i'm going to bring it to pass i'm not dependent on man you know even i hate to say it like this but one time i got in trouble but your doubt can't even stop god your doubt can't even stop god god did not include your doubt in this amen he didn't include any of that he he knew that we would stumble sometime at the promise but he swore by himself anyway and he's gonna bring it to pass your doubt might delay it but it can't stop it hallelujah church it's time like brother wesker say doubt your doubt it's time to doubt your doubts believe god for the impossible and i love that we can have reckless
