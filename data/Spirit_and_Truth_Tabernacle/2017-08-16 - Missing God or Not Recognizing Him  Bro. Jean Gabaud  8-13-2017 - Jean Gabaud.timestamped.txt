[19:52] bless you
[19:56] the song I'm going to sing it's a song
[20:00] that I'm little brother Mike gave me I'm
[20:06] sorry he's not here to hear it hopefully
[20:08] he can pick it up in here in some time
[20:10] the future the song is about someone
[20:16] living in the world and because the Sun
[20:21] is so bright outside and it makes the
[20:24] world look really good they're not
[20:27] really sure of the life that they're
[20:30] leading and he's facing his songs that
[20:35] because there in the world they think
[20:37] everything is really great and but they
[20:41] don't realize that they're living in
[20:42] darkness and not feeding on the light of
[20:44] God he also states that because they
[20:49] live in the world so much that their God
[20:51] is down and they don't realize that
[20:53] they're living in a life of hopelessness
[20:55] and that they're choosing the devil's
[20:58] Mirage he also states that because they
[21:02] are living in the world that they're
[21:05] they can't keep focused on trying to
[21:07] serve the Lord and that the more they're
[21:11] in the world the more that their
[21:13] spiritual light is burning out and once
[21:17] they realize that they are not being
[21:21] focused on the world and that they're
[21:24] falling away from the Lord that they
[21:26] start to cry out to God and they ask God
[21:29] to begin the journey to turn themselves
[21:34] back to God and Jesus answers this
[21:40] person and says that he has come down
[21:43] into the world to save him in a set set
[21:46] his person free and that all the
[21:49] struggles and trials that this person
[21:52] goes through he they belong to him and
[21:56] this person doesn't need to cry or fight
[21:58] the battle alone so he named the song
[22:03] life is a traffic jam without Christ
[22:06] insurance
[22:08] and I cold titled it come to me and be
[22:11] free I hope it's a blessing to you just
[22:21] because the sun is shining doesn't mean
[22:26] the world is bright your ever take a
[22:31] bite of darkness then feed on the light
[22:37] your guard is down and you live in a
[22:41] life of hopelessness choosing after The
[22:48] Devil's Mirage yeah yeah you're choosing
[22:55] after The Devil's Mirage so you can't
[23:01] keep focused cuz your light is burning
[23:07] up and now you are crying trying to gain
[23:14] this whole world mmm you're trying to
[23:22] gain this whole world but then you
[23:28] realize that your light is burning out
[23:34] so you cry out to Jesus to save you from
[23:40] you'll need the real oh whoa
[23:46] save you from your missile beanie and
[23:52] Jesus said I come down from heaven to
[23:58] say it are you free all your struggles
[24:02] and try your

[26:07] was real nervous about it but I became a
[26:10] part of an agency that sent me on a

[59:03] here this morning we think you dealer
[59:06] for your blessings that you've bestowed
[59:07] upon us this week and father the Lord
[59:11] there's no other place that would rather
[59:12] be but in the house of God the Lord my
[59:15] heart just burned within me the Lord
[59:17] just knowing the Lord I was going to
[59:18] come to a place of worship father the
[59:21] Lord I pray I pray that you would remove
[59:23] any distraction from our midst the Lord

[59:27] receiving a blessing this morning may
[59:30] you come and speak to every hungry heart
[59:32] the Lord and minister to every need the
[59:33] Lord and father I pray that your people
[59:36] would just lay the burden at the foot of
[59:38] Calvary their Lord knowing the Lord that
[59:40] our debts have been paid the Lord Father
[59:43] we thank you for your grace and your
[59:44] mercy now as we reverently approach your
[59:47] word the Lord I pray the Lord that you
[59:49] would open up the word on to us I'm
[59:51] reminded of what you're profited at any
[59:52] man within the ability of his own can
[59:54] flip back the pages of the Bible but it
[59:57] takes the Lamb of God to come and break
[59:58] bread with him father may you come and
[1:00:00] just reveal your word one more time to
[1:00:02] us the Lord will be careful to give you
[1:00:05] the praise and glory that only you are
[1:00:06] worthy of and the bride says amen amen
[1:00:11] god bless you sing to certainly get to
[1:00:13] be in the house of the Lord that's all
[1:00:14] the singing for my part so preachers
[1:00:16] appreciate the positions
[1:00:18] turn with me revelations chapter three
[1:00:20] just one opening Scripture and I'll let
[1:00:21] you have your seats and shush y'all had
[1:00:25] a good week amen I was uh I was running
[1:00:32] a little bit behind got a late start and
[1:00:34] my mom is with me so I was happy that I
[1:00:37] was able to swing by and pick her up
[1:00:40] amen so really excited to have her with
[1:00:42] us and I tell you what I mean you know
[1:00:45] your your your already running late as
[1:00:47] it is and feeling really bad and here
[1:00:50] you're stuck behind every slow car you
[1:00:52] catch every red light you know you don't
[1:00:54] see a cop for days and then that one day
[1:00:57] that you're running late they're
[1:00:58] everywhere
[1:00:59] you know they're following you there
[1:01:01] ahead of you so it's expressional you
[1:01:06] but they've got God's grace right here
[1:01:08] this morning amen
[1:01:11] Revelation chapter 3 verse 21 opening
[1:01:13] Scripture and I'll let you have your
[1:01:14] seats and it reads behold I stand at the
[1:01:18] door and knock if any man hear my voice
[1:01:21] and open the door I will come into him
[1:01:24] and what's up with him and he with me
[1:01:27] Amen me the Lord has his blessing too
[1:01:29] reading of the word he may be seated
[1:01:33] amen
[1:01:34] i ministered on this not too far back
[1:01:37] I'm a home church and really looking at
[1:01:40] some key scriptures that I may or may
[1:01:41] not have shared with this little flock
[1:01:44] here but it's really missing God or not
[1:01:47] recognizing them and we're living in a
[1:01:51] day where you know men's agenda is is as
[1:01:56] such that they're so preoccupied with so
[1:02:00] many things that's taking place and
[1:02:02] they're missing the very movement of God
[1:02:05] the very essence of God and and it's
[1:02:08] amazing because it's nothing but the
[1:02:11] tactics of the devil where he's throwing
[1:02:15] and bombarding us with so many forms of
[1:02:19] distraction things that occupies our
[1:02:21] time impulses redeem the time for the
[1:02:25] days are evil
[1:02:25] so things that occupies our time things
[1:02:28] that occupies our mind things that just
[1:02:31] occupy
[1:02:31] you know are walking so it's just that
[1:02:35] it just God is moving on the scene and
[1:02:39] man is missing the very the very acts of
[1:02:43] God and and it it's it's striking and
[1:02:46] it's remarkable and that's what we're
[1:02:48] going to dig into a little bit is you
[1:02:50] know how man is missing God or not even
[1:02:54] recognizing him in in their midst you
[1:02:58] know it's interesting because we live in
[1:03:02] a we live in a modern day society and we
[1:03:07] have at our disposal so much technology
[1:03:11] and you know we could look at and know
[1:03:17] that there's a storm that's brewing and
[1:03:21] we make preparations for the storm
[1:03:25] we know the strength of the storm we
[1:03:28] know if it's a tropical depression we
[1:03:30] know if it's a category one two three
[1:03:33] four five so we know the strength of the
[1:03:37] storm
[1:03:38] we even have instruments that can
[1:03:40] predict the path of the storm so if the
[1:03:45] storm is if the storm is not heading
[1:03:48] towards us then it gives us moments to
[1:03:51] relax but if we're in direct path of the
[1:03:55] storm it creates a sense of urgency
[1:04:00] because you know we don't want to not
[1:04:02] trust the news the news anchor or the
[1:04:05] newspaper or the the source in which
[1:04:07] you're getting the information from you
[1:04:09] just know that there's a storm that's
[1:04:11] coming and you want to make preparations
[1:04:12] and like any man or woman would do they
[1:04:16] would board up the house they would make
[1:04:18] sure that everything is hunkered down
[1:04:20] and that there's not anything loose you
[1:04:24] could think you could spiritualize this
[1:04:27] so because this is important
[1:04:29] right you you want to make sure your
[1:04:31] family is safe so you board the house
[1:04:35] you want to make sure that nothing you
[1:04:37] know the Bible says lay aside every
[1:04:39] weight and sin that so easily beset us
[1:04:44] so so when we know that there's a storm
[1:04:47] that's coming we take precautions we we
[1:04:52] built things down we make sure that
[1:04:54] there's nothing loose around we take
[1:04:57] inventory of making sure that the home
[1:04:59] is in order we make sure that our
[1:05:02] children's in order why because there's
[1:05:05] a storm that's approaching now jesus
[1:05:09] said you know of the Pharisees you can
[1:05:12] discern the sky but the signs of the
[1:05:17] time you can't discern pondering that
[1:05:21] for a little bit so with all the
[1:05:23] technology that man has they can discern
[1:05:27] the the sky they know when things are
[1:05:30] going to get bad they know if conditions
[1:05:34] are right for a tornado they know
[1:05:38] conditions are right for a hurricane
[1:05:40] they have the instruments but yet they
[1:05:44] fail to look at an anointed word and
[1:05:46] draw the same type of spiritual
[1:05:49] conclusion they have they lacked
[1:05:52] spiritual urgency and so therefore
[1:05:56] naturally they take precaution but
[1:05:58] spiritually the searle is void of God
[1:06:03] but there's been a prophet in the land
[1:06:06] who told us that there's a storm that's
[1:06:10] coming I don't know about you but I'm
[1:06:12] going to echo what John would say up for
[1:06:14] me in my house we're going to serve the
[1:06:17] Lord we're going to make preparations
[1:06:20] let me tell you it's more than me coming
[1:06:23] to church to showcase that I just bought
[1:06:24] a new suit it's Laura
[1:06:28] let me tell all my track I said you know
[1:06:30] coming to church is much more than
[1:06:32] fulfilling your spiritual obligation you
[1:06:36] don't come to church on Sunday just to
[1:06:38] get your spiritual fix
[1:06:42] I hope y'all can still call me brother
[1:06:45] after church is done it's much more to
[1:06:48] entertain it's much more to show one
[1:06:50] another my soul is at stake the soul of
[1:06:53] my family is I think let me say if you
[1:06:56] don't want to take this seriously then
[1:06:58] you shouldn't be right here worshiping
[1:07:00] God but let me tell you I know what the
[1:07:02] Bible tells me and I've laid aside every
[1:07:05] weight and sin and I'm going to take
[1:07:06] this gospel very seriously can we sit
[1:07:15] braise the Lord there's a storm that's
[1:07:19] brewing and people are dismissing the
[1:07:23] signs of the time it's no mere
[1:07:27] coincidence that we have things that
[1:07:29] happening in the world today we're
[1:07:34] living in the end time in spiritual
[1:07:38] darkness are coming at play there the
[1:07:41] gatherings are forces and people are
[1:07:45] looking for something thicket sense it
[1:07:48] in the atmosphere but for us it's more
[1:07:52] than just sensation my soul is anchored
[1:07:57] on the promise word that the Bible says
[1:08:00] this mortal must put on immortality
[1:08:02] someone has to fulfill that Scripture
[1:08:06] the Bible also says that God is not
[1:08:08] slack concerning his promises at some
[1:08:11] men will count slackness because usually
[1:08:15] in that we're usually in that approach
[1:08:17] people tend to get lazy they get relaxed
[1:08:22] and they miss God so I just like to draw
[1:08:28] some examples from the scripture of of
[1:08:32] opportunity that people have missed and
[1:08:36] John chapter 5 if your turn there with
[1:08:40] me real quickly
[1:08:47] John chapter 5 the Bible says this and
[1:08:53] verse 1 after this there was a feast of
[1:08:57] the Jews and Jesus went up to Jerusalem
[1:09:03] now there is at Jerusalem by the Sheep
[1:09:06] market a pool which is called in the
[1:09:08] Hebrew tongue Bethesda having five
[1:09:11] porches in there in these lay a great
[1:09:17] multitude of impotent folk a blind Hulk
[1:09:23] withered waiting for the moving of the
[1:09:27] water for an angel went down at a
[1:09:33] certain season into the pool and
[1:09:37] troubled the water whosoever then first
[1:09:43] after the troubling of the water stepped
[1:09:46] in was made whole of whatsoever disease
[1:09:50] he had so pausing there real quickly you
[1:09:55] find that there was a spool and within a
[1:10:00] certain season an angel would come in
[1:10:04] and with trouble the water
[1:10:08] and can you just imagine the throngs of
[1:10:12] people that sat around waiting for an
[1:10:16] opportunity for healing to take place
[1:10:19] and the Bible says that the conditions
[1:10:22] of the people varied from impotent to
[1:10:25] blind hole withered and their salvation
[1:10:30] was resting upon the moving of that
[1:10:35] water and that was where they received
[1:10:39] their blessings if you will and the
[1:10:43] Bible talks about that the first one
[1:10:45] that got into the water after was
[1:10:49] troubled they were made whole of
[1:10:52] whatsoever disease they had man can you
[1:10:55] just imagine so when when the water was
[1:10:58] troubled an angel
[1:10:59] in trouble that water one person made it
[1:11:02] in then the rest would have to wait but
[1:11:07] the Bible goes on and says in a certain
[1:11:09] man was there which had infirmity 38
[1:11:14] years 30 years 38 years he had this
[1:11:20] infirmity now I want you to kind of
[1:11:24] ponder on this a little bit this man was
[1:11:28] amongst the people waiting for an
[1:11:32] opportunity to dip into the pool so that
[1:11:35] way he could receive the healing that
[1:11:37] he's been battling with for 38 years
[1:11:41] this man didn't have anyone there to
[1:11:45] support him he did have family members
[1:11:48] he didn't have friends he was alone in
[1:11:52] this situation it's all he knew that his
[1:11:56] only salvation was was to make it to the
[1:12:01] pool in order for him to receive his
[1:12:03] complete healing so everybody was
[1:12:07] waiting for a return angels ministry to
[1:12:12] come in trouble the water always been
[1:12:17] together so but while they were waiting
[1:12:20] for a return ministry Jesus was in the
[1:12:24] midst of the people because God knows
[1:12:30] who his chosen ones are I'm not looking
[1:12:34] for a return ministry I'm looking for
[1:12:36] Jesus on the scene it's all you find
[1:12:42] that you know this man
[1:12:44] year after year he was at position but
[1:12:49] one day there was a visit that was going
[1:12:52] to change his life completely and so why
[1:12:57] he sat there just waiting year after
[1:13:01] year first year
[1:13:03] no opportunity second year no
[1:13:07] opportunity third year I mean think
[1:13:10] about it you have to fight with people
[1:13:12] he had to wrestle he had to struggle in
[1:13:16] order to have access to the pool but he
[1:13:20] was just not quick enough perhaps he was
[1:13:22] not forceful enough perhaps he was
[1:13:25] enough he didn't have enough fight in
[1:13:27] him
[1:13:28] but he stayed close to where the
[1:13:30] blessing he thought was that hereafter
[1:13:34] year he came the church got nothing
[1:13:38] he after year heard a message it was
[1:13:42] troubling but did nothing yesteryear let
[1:13:46] me tell you your condition does not
[1:13:49] change stops pursuit after you just
[1:13:55] because it didn't happen the first year
[1:13:57] you hold on to that the second year you
[1:14:00] hold on to that the third year you hold
[1:14:03] on to that because one of these days
[1:14:06] it's going to be different
[1:14:08] one of these days it's not going to be
[1:14:10] the same and the Bible says and and when
[1:14:18] Jesus saw him live there the Bible says
[1:14:25] he saw neither in you that he had been
[1:14:29] now a long time in that case he said to
[1:14:33] him will thou be made whole you know I
[1:14:40] like about that scripture the Bible says
[1:14:42] when Jesus saw him he knew his diagnosis
[1:14:46] he knew the situation it's different
[1:14:52] when you go to a doctor and they got a
[1:14:54] picture of these smiley faces from happy
[1:14:56] to really sadness that how you feeling
[1:14:58] I'm like I don't know I'm somewhere
[1:14:59] between seven and eight but it's really
[1:15:02] really bad and they try to they try and
[1:15:06] get you to pull you how do you feel the
[1:15:07] day if I may I don't know that the
[1:15:09] reason why I'm here is because I don't
[1:15:10] feel good but the Bible says Jesus is a
[1:15:14] great position that could be touched by
[1:15:17] the feelings of my infirmities your
[1:15:20] brother may not know the pains of what
[1:15:22] you're going through but
[1:15:23] I could interject and those exactly
[1:15:26] what's going through your heart and do
[1:15:28] your soul he could diagnose your
[1:15:32] situation before you sit out of one word
[1:15:34] of what your problem is and not only
[1:15:37] that but he has an answer for your
[1:15:39] problem he has an answer for yourself
[1:15:41] for your situation he has an answer for
[1:15:44] your question he could look at you let
[1:15:50] me say you could be sitting here in
[1:15:51] church with a smile in your face but
[1:15:54] your soul is full of pain your heart is
[1:15:59] aching you can fool everybody yes but
[1:16:02] you cannot fool Jesus Christ he has
[1:16:05] diagnosed the situation and he knows
[1:16:07] exactly the burden that you're caring
[1:16:12] Sunday after Sunday you could come to
[1:16:14] church with a smile but your heart is
[1:16:16] heavy I may not be able to well
[1:16:23] articulate what you're going through but
[1:16:25] the moment you open up your mouth to God
[1:16:27] he's able to dissect he's able to desert
[1:16:31] all your situation and provide a remedy
[1:16:36] for your problem this man his focus in
[1:16:42] attention was with everybody else think
[1:16:46] about that Jesus sifted through a crowd
[1:16:50] of people you know how many people he
[1:16:53] bypassed just to find that one man and
[1:17:01] as Jesus brushed the side of the group
[1:17:04] of people they were still looking at the
[1:17:07] water and meanwhile he was sifting his
[1:17:11] way through the crowd the word was
[1:17:15] looking for his alexia
[1:17:18] the Bible says when Adam fell there did
[1:17:22] not change God's opinion about his son
[1:17:24] this is not a message of replacement
[1:17:27] this is a message of restoration when
[1:17:31] word got back to God that your children
[1:17:34] are fallen brother branham illustrate
[1:17:36] these licenses I'll step in and go help
[1:17:38] out give us as I step in as will help on
[1:17:41] and progresses gorgeous perspectives on
[1:17:44] this is Michael this is not your job
[1:17:47] Gabriel this is not your job these are
[1:17:49] my children and the policies without
[1:17:52] controversy great is the mystery of
[1:17:54] godliness of God became flesh and he
[1:17:58] came walking he came looking after his
[1:18:01] own children because another law will
[1:18:03] not do he has to restore you back to
[1:18:06] your condition so he sifted through the
[1:18:13] crowds of people press his way people
[1:18:18] want to push the Messiah whether they
[1:18:20] were just looking at the water because
[1:18:22] that was more important than recognizing
[1:18:23] God in their mid but that's okay for the
[1:18:29] other people that miss God I think Donna
[1:18:32] he was looking for me I think God that
[1:18:35] he came and gave me and on him then he
[1:18:38] came and sought after me because let me
[1:18:40] tell you how was it looking for God but
[1:18:43] God was looking for me
[1:18:48] the Bible says long we were yet sinners
[1:18:51] Christ died for you when you were
[1:18:56] drinking your beer in the world God will
[1:18:59] get you that I made the right decision
[1:19:00] about you when you had a farm ah just
[1:19:07] that I make the right decision about you
[1:19:10] when you were smoking your cigarette
[1:19:12] just still saying I made the right
[1:19:14] decision about you let me do when people
[1:19:17] saw you and thought that you all
[1:19:18] finished up God look at you sir this is
[1:19:21] a promise child I have made a promise
[1:19:24] and I will redeem him and
[1:19:26] back to the phone what man failed to see
[1:19:33] God saw in me everybody else did that
[1:19:43] man but he had no opportunity he had no
[1:19:47] friends there's a friend in G he had no
[1:19:54] support the support in Jesus and in
[1:20:00] Jesus can you just imagine just the
[1:20:02] thousands of people that probably stood
[1:20:04] there waiting for an opportunity to just
[1:20:07] have an audience with God to have an
[1:20:10] audience to just just dip into that pool
[1:20:12] and receive their healing and me like
[1:20:15] Jesus say excuse me I'm looking for
[1:20:17] someone he knew who he was looking for
[1:20:22] it was God who says Adam where are down
[1:20:28] God who said Adam where that God is it's
[1:20:32] all so God who called Jeremiah from
[1:20:36] looking room of his mother God knew you
[1:20:39] by name before you uttered your first
[1:20:41] word before you breathed your first
[1:20:43] breath God said I put your name in the
[1:20:46] Lamb's Book of Life and Jesus came to
[1:20:53] this man he asked him one question will
[1:20:57] you be made whole this guy's was not
[1:21:01] complicated when I asked you to put your
[1:21:06] name in the books always you could be
[1:21:07] joined to a church we're not asking you
[1:21:10] to do back flips and somersaults we're
[1:21:12] not even asking you as a requirement to
[1:21:14] speak in tongues before we need to put -
[1:21:16] you're part of the body that's not part
[1:21:20] of the requirement Jesus kept it simple
[1:21:23] he came to the man he looked at him he
[1:21:25] diagnosed the situation you he's been in
[1:21:27] that situation for a long time let me
[1:21:33] say something
[1:21:34] there's not one prayer that you pray to
[1:21:36] God that he didn't know about
[1:21:40] lord I don't know if you know but uh
[1:21:47] there's not one word that you can honor
[1:21:50] to God that he didn't know about the
[1:21:54] Bible talks about again he begins to
[1:21:56] pray for the Church of Israel and try to
[1:21:58] understand the vision that he had and
[1:22:00] the Bible talks about how 21 days later
[1:22:03] the angel Gabriel comes and tries to
[1:22:05] insert the prayer for Daniel and finally
[1:22:09] when he gets the Ganga
[1:22:10] he says Daniel highly favorite unless of
[1:22:13] God he says the first day that you
[1:22:17] inclined yourself to pray God heard you
[1:22:25] the first time you ever get on your
[1:22:29] knees about your issue God heard you two
[1:22:31] years ago he heard you five years ago
[1:22:34] but the glory of the Lord is with the
[1:22:37] right time when with the right season
[1:22:39] but you gotta stay pressing or believing
[1:22:42] that the moment that God comes on the
[1:22:44] scene he's more than able to do
[1:22:46] exceedingly abundantly then all that you
[1:22:50] have ever expected let me say praise the
[1:22:59] Lord
[1:22:59] so yes a man would I be made whole just
[1:23:04] one simple question
[1:23:05] and then the airplane man answered him
[1:23:08] and said you didn't say yeah he said
[1:23:12] well you see what happened was I have no
[1:23:14] man when the water is troubled to put me
[1:23:18] in the pool but while I come well I am
[1:23:21] coming another step down before me and
[1:23:23] they just get chaotic I went to the
[1:23:25] doctor and the doctor said well we all
[1:23:26] know we don't have the right medication
[1:23:28] and then you know it runs in my family
[1:23:30] and this stand the other it's a really
[1:23:32] difficult situation I've been like this
[1:23:34] hole for the longest he's just imagine
[1:23:35] Jesus in there he Jesus didn't know how
[1:23:41] he got how he came how he came with that
[1:23:43] explanation from one question he has it
[1:23:47] was a yes/no question do you want to be
[1:23:50] made whole
[1:23:52] yes or no but this man he misunderstood
[1:23:57] it says well let me cling to you you
[1:24:00] know thirty years I've been seen here no
[1:24:01] one came by I don't got no family you
[1:24:04] know the doctor said this and you know
[1:24:06] they've been in school and they got
[1:24:07] degrees and everything who are we to
[1:24:09] really capture addicted doctor and you
[1:24:10] know I just you know I don't know what
[1:24:12] we I've seen a lot of specialists I've
[1:24:13] seen experts and I seen their experts
[1:24:15] I've seen a psychiatrist I've seen their
[1:24:17] psychiatrist I've seen a bunch of people
[1:24:19] I talk to everybody and no one really
[1:24:21] has an explanation but I don't know what
[1:24:22] you're gonna do for me but I'm telling
[1:24:23] you what it is a very complicated
[1:24:25] situation
[1:24:26] I maintain different I mean it not much
[1:24:33] different from you and I today after I
[1:24:38] went to the doctor the doctor oh you
[1:24:40] know this came from discouraging you let
[1:24:42] me take every time the devil opens up
[1:24:44] his mouth ezel I the Moses that every
[1:24:49] man be alive and God be true I don't
[1:24:53] care how many degrees you have I don't
[1:24:55] care what school you went to
[1:24:56] if you ever went to the school of the
[1:24:58] baptism of the Holy Spirit where the
[1:25:00] Bible says by His stripes I am healed I
[1:25:03] have no reason to get here to things
[1:25:06] that contradicts the structure jesus
[1:25:14] asking one question do you want to be
[1:25:16] made whole
[1:25:16] my response is yes feet alone to me
[1:25:19] according to your word that should be
[1:25:24] your attitude Lord be it unto me
[1:25:26] according to your word no matter how
[1:25:30] difficult the situation looks you might
[1:25:33] the brother Jean I'm going after a job
[1:25:35] and there are two people down much
[1:25:36] better than I am beat it up to me
[1:25:38] according to your word God deals with
[1:25:43] the impossibility I don't want to miss
[1:25:50] God this morning
[1:25:51] he's walking by are we staying together
[1:25:57] so this man said that he offered Jesus a
[1:26:00] whole explanation you know the when the
[1:26:04] foolish trouble like as if Jesus doesn't
[1:26:06] like he's telling Jesus things like as
[1:26:08] if Jesus doesn't know himself cuz
[1:26:13] obviously you didn't make it to the
[1:26:14] water I get that that's the reason why
[1:26:16] you still in the situation that you're
[1:26:17] in but I'm not looking for that
[1:26:20] explanation do you want to be made whole
[1:26:27] because he was looking at all of these
[1:26:30] people and he probably reasoning how is
[1:26:33] this man gonna get me down to the water
[1:26:36] now realizing that he was speaking to
[1:26:39] the very killer himself to the very one
[1:26:43] who who's responsible for you and I
[1:26:50] Jesus didn't entertain it too much he
[1:26:52] just responds like some anniversay and
[1:26:54] says man rise up take up your bed and
[1:26:58] walk
[1:27:01] rise rise take up thy bed and walk you
[1:27:12] know the reason why that's so important
[1:27:14] is because the devil's sole ambition is
[1:27:19] to knock you down when someone is tired
[1:27:25] they get this they sit down they need
[1:27:28] rest when someone's beaten the beam down
[1:27:33] when someone is sick sickness just
[1:27:35] brings you down physically emotionally
[1:27:39] and sometimes it spiritually brings you
[1:27:43] down and so the reason why that is is
[1:27:48] because remember Satan anointed the
[1:27:51] beats who used to walk upright so he had
[1:27:57] an advantage over man and so when he
[1:28:02] brought man when he interfered with
[1:28:05] man he he he interjected Timmy
[1:28:07] introduced sin and men spiritually fell
[1:28:11] and God looks at man it is because this
[1:28:17] has occurred I will curse the ground for
[1:28:20] your sake and the Beast that walked
[1:28:24] upright the Bible says how he God
[1:28:28] brought down his body broke down his
[1:28:31] composition and in physique and had him
[1:28:35] go and crawl on the ground so he's
[1:28:41] identified with the curse so that's the
[1:28:45] reason why when when saying he his
[1:28:49] demons are an attack they tried to bring
[1:28:51] you down to the ground because they want
[1:28:54] you to be identified with the curse but
[1:29:00] thanks be to God the grave is that what
[1:29:04] I'm supposed to be I'm not identified
[1:29:06] with the ground that's the reason why
[1:29:08] there has to be a resurrection there has
[1:29:13] to be a spiritual resurrection that's
[1:29:15] the reason where we got begins to bless
[1:29:17] you he raises you up the Bible says
[1:29:19] you're seated in heavenly places in
[1:29:21] Christ Jesus because you're not
[1:29:25] identified with the curse of the ground
[1:29:30] God has risen you up you're seated in
[1:29:34] heavenly places
[1:29:38] let me count upon them kind of play with
[1:29:40] this a little bit when when the first
[1:29:42] piece came out it was a lion a
[1:29:47] four-footed beast he still walked on the
[1:29:51] crown that was anointing with in the
[1:29:55] first future changes the second beast
[1:29:58] was an ox he was still connected to the
[1:30:02] ground
[1:30:04] that was within sight area in the third
[1:30:08] beast he rose up a little bit with a man
[1:30:11] he walked him two feet you see that
[1:30:14] men's beginning the rise up a little bit
[1:30:16] but he was still connected to the ground
[1:30:19] but in this age God has given us the
[1:30:24] anointing of an eagle there were no
[1:30:26] longer identify with the course of the
[1:30:28] girl
[1:30:29] but God has resurrected you and I up
[1:30:31] then we just fly and soar above the
[1:30:34] custard land and see the impending
[1:30:37] judgment your quickened with the Eagles
[1:30:42] of nineteen praise be to God so Jesus
[1:30:51] saw them rise that's your message when
[1:30:56] God speaks to you you no longer have to
[1:30:58] be bounded by your problems binded by
[1:31:02] your circumstances the viruses W the
[1:31:05] chains are broken you're no longer tied
[1:31:07] to those things in the business world
[1:31:12] the illustrate how one should try to
[1:31:16] exercise realize their full potential
[1:31:19] they talk about that in business and on
[1:31:23] a side note a lot of people that prosper
[1:31:26] prospers under the philosophy of
[1:31:28] business but the inspiration comes from
[1:31:30] God you used to tie a lot of these
[1:31:36] motivational speeches and things of that
[1:31:37] nature
[1:31:38] from the very things that dig in the
[1:31:39] scripture don't let the devil rob you of
[1:31:41] what God has for you they said man that
[1:31:44] is design that's not anything new
[1:31:46] underneath the Sun it's from the Bible
[1:31:48] but they use this illustration but this
[1:31:52] a baby elephant and they they take this
[1:31:58] chain and they tied it this baby
[1:32:00] elephant to the tree and time and time
[1:32:03] again that baby elephant will try to
[1:32:05] pull but the tree would hold him back
[1:32:08] that baby elephant would try to pull but
[1:32:11] that tree would hold him back year after
[1:32:14] year he would try to do it
[1:32:17] and at some point he'll give up and stop
[1:32:21] trying saying you know what this
[1:32:23] situation is much bigger than me and he
[1:32:27] sits there and by the over the years
[1:32:30] he's grown into this ambassadors
[1:32:33] enormous gigantic elephant house strong
[1:32:40] and still chained and bound he stopped
[1:32:46] trying he stopped making efforts because
[1:32:51] he believed that he can't break that
[1:32:53] chain and in the business where they say
[1:32:59] you don't recognize your full potential
[1:33:03] what I'm telling you this greater is He
[1:33:06] that is in you than he that is in the
[1:33:08] world do you recognize your full
[1:33:11] potential
[1:33:13] don't be binded by the thing that the
[1:33:17] devil's told you in the past were you so
[1:33:20] real over the sins of the past and God
[1:33:23] so that can fit into the fear
[1:33:25] forgiveness but the devil want to replay
[1:33:28] that image into your head and you refuse
[1:33:31] to walk a little bit closer to God
[1:33:33] because you're haunted by the sins of
[1:33:35] your past if you put him underneath the
[1:33:38] blood and you've made it right you know
[1:33:40] that devil is just a lie and the Bible
[1:33:45] says in immediately the man was made
[1:33:48] whole and took up his bed and walk
[1:33:52] and on the same day was the Sabbath so
[1:33:55] immediately he was made whole Matthew 17
[1:34:02] does those scriptures points the
[1:34:04] scriptures let me make sure I'm not
[1:34:05] keeping you past three o'clock with his
[1:34:07] 12 amen
[1:34:11] Matthew 17
[1:34:20] [Music]
[1:34:21] now I'll just bring this point this is
[1:34:24] where Jesus brings up Peter James and
[1:34:27] John up to mount transfer your Mount
[1:34:32] Transfiguration and he illustrates how
[1:34:36] the the end times going to be with the
[1:34:39] the resurrected Saints those that died
[1:34:41] and went by the way of the grave and
[1:34:42] those data that are alive and took a
[1:34:46] change in the body a type of Moses and
[1:34:48] Elijah and so he brings them on the
[1:34:51] scene and he's transfigured before them
[1:34:54] but then in verse 10 the Bible says and
[1:34:56] his disciples asked him saying why then
[1:34:59] say the scribes that Elias which is
[1:35:02] Elijah must first come and jesus
[1:35:06] answered and said unto them truly shall
[1:35:10] I Elias truly shot first come and
[1:35:14] restore all things so he's talking about
[1:35:17] this inside ministry says look Elijah is
[1:35:19] really supposed to come and restore all
[1:35:21] things but I say unto you that Elias
[1:35:26] Elijah is all is come already and they
[1:35:30] knew him not but have done her to him
[1:35:34] whatsoever they listed likewise also
[1:35:38] also also the son of man suffer of them
[1:35:43] then the disciples understood that he
[1:35:46] spake unto them of John the Baptist
[1:35:48] so I correlated this scripture with the
[1:35:51] study I was doing with the church around
[1:35:52] us and I was tiny with missing with
[1:35:54] missing God they were looking for
[1:35:57] Alliance to come and yet they were
[1:35:59] missing what he was doing brother he
[1:36:05] says this he says we think up for what
[1:36:07] he's done in the past we look forward
[1:36:09] for what he's going to do in the future
[1:36:11] but we often time miss what he's doing
[1:36:13] right now and so the world is completely
[1:36:19] missing the very acts of God in what
[1:36:21] he's doing right now uh when I was a tad
[1:36:25] bit younger um
[1:36:29] dudas I used to read a lot of comics and
[1:36:32] so when the paper came I always looked
[1:36:34] forward to it and that was the only
[1:36:35] thing I read with the comics and then
[1:36:37] there's this comic that it was a Charlie
[1:36:40] Brown comic it was a peanuts and it went
[1:36:45] across it went across the the u.s. it
[1:36:48] was a famous car it was the probably
[1:36:50] still live the famous comic and this
[1:36:52] newspaper went across the US and in this
[1:36:56] in this comic you find that this so this
[1:37:00] little boy he's watching a television
[1:37:02] and and and he's watching as this golfer
[1:37:06] is getting ready to make his last putt
[1:37:09] and the announcer says you know here it
[1:37:13] is there's no tomorrow and the little
[1:37:17] girl walks in and that's all she heard
[1:37:20] those no tomorrow she screams and she
[1:37:24] runs out she's like I heard it for
[1:37:27] myself it's the end there's no tomorrow
[1:37:30] this is it the world's coming to an end
[1:37:33] they're panicking in the book the little
[1:37:35] girl and the little boys are panicking
[1:37:37] in the last clip were their top of
[1:37:40] Snoopy's house and they're reflecting on
[1:37:42] what they just heard and Snoopy little
[1:37:45] bubble is the thought process was I
[1:37:47] thought Elijah was to come first I have
[1:37:53] the article I could show you this wood
[1:37:56] across the u.s. millions of people
[1:38:00] probably read the comic and saw that and
[1:38:03] went right over their heads they were
[1:38:07] looking for something and missing it and
[1:38:11] there he was saying
[1:38:13] I thought Elias I thought Elijah was to
[1:38:16] come first in the world missed it and
[1:38:20] yet God has showed it to a low bride you
[1:38:25] have an opportunity to see something
[1:38:27] that that that the scholars had missed
[1:38:31] the theologians overlooked Luke chapter
[1:38:37] 24
[1:38:38] we'll wrap up with this Luke chapter 24
[1:38:43] you love the Lord Luke 24 I loved
[1:38:53] reading the scripture because there's
[1:38:54] just so many there's so much points to
[1:38:56] this in verse 13 and behold two of them
[1:39:01] went that same day to a village called
[1:39:04] Emmaus which is from Jerusalem about
[1:39:08] threescore furlongs so let me just kind
[1:39:10] of set the stage for you you have two
[1:39:13] individuals one of which will learn his
[1:39:15] name is Cleopas and they're leaving
[1:39:18] Jerusalem where the word kind of sprung
[1:39:21] forth and then we're making the way to
[1:39:24] Emmaus and this is after this is coming
[1:39:29] out of the heels of of the death of
[1:39:32] Jesus and then not only that but you
[1:39:35] they were witnesses to all the miracles
[1:39:37] how he fed the multitude how he did all
[1:39:40] these grander things and so then were
[1:39:43] somewhat saddened in the toll estate and
[1:39:46] they will work and they were making
[1:39:47] their way back weatherman says that
[1:39:49] there was going back to the occupations
[1:39:51] that will come back to their job and
[1:39:53] basically he says that you know though
[1:39:55] you know people say that the days of
[1:39:57] miracles are past it's all over there's
[1:39:59] no more revival so these men were
[1:40:03] heading to Emmaus and you know like
[1:40:06] anything misery breathe company so it's
[1:40:08] not enough for one person to kind of
[1:40:10] walk along in their tears of sorrow but
[1:40:12] they want somebody else to kind of join
[1:40:14] with them because they want you to know
[1:40:15] their pain so they say so they're
[1:40:18] walking back and they talked together of
[1:40:21] all these things which had happened how
[1:40:23] he healed the sick he he raised the dead
[1:40:26] he fed the multitudes he walked the
[1:40:29] water-heater waters reward to wine he
[1:40:31] did all these miraculous things in a
[1:40:35] cage the past verse 15 that while they
[1:40:37] commune together in reason Jesus himself
[1:40:41] drew near and went with them let me tell
[1:40:45] you if you haven't experienced Jesus
[1:40:47] this week did you talk about him
[1:40:52] because if you talked about Jesus it
[1:40:55] brings him on the scene Gee's ability
[1:41:00] not just had a self the presence of the
[1:41:02] Holy Spirit when's the last time you
[1:41:04] talked to God because if he's talked to
[1:41:08] God enough I'm sure that's going to
[1:41:10] invite God to come into your realm of
[1:41:12] atmosphere don't only girl God when
[1:41:15] you're in trouble don't only call God
[1:41:20] when you're down but let me tell you
[1:41:23] when the bills are paid when the job is
[1:41:26] good and the teak is full and your
[1:41:29] family Posse still call upon God don't
[1:41:37] wait till you're down on your bottoms
[1:41:39] only to when you're distraught but when
[1:41:41] things are going well you are to give
[1:41:43] God praises you're to holler shout if
[1:41:46] they like thank you for my health
[1:41:48] thank you for my well-being thank you
[1:41:50] for my finances thank you for my car
[1:41:53] thank you for my job thank you for my
[1:41:55] children thank you for my marriage
[1:41:57] you are to holler scream when the things
[1:41:59] are good
[1:42:00] [Applause]
[1:42:02] [Music]
[1:42:06] start talking about them it's easy to
[1:42:09] talk about politics but politics could
[1:42:12] divide us it's easy to talk about social
[1:42:16] issues but social issues could divide us
[1:42:18] but when we get to gathered around this
[1:42:21] anointed word praise be to God when you
[1:42:24] start a coup my brother Brennan said and
[1:42:26] you start telling me what Jesus says I
[1:42:28] have an affinity with what you're
[1:42:30] talking about
[1:42:31] you will not offend me because you're
[1:42:33] talking about what I am interested in
[1:42:40] people get upset because people are not
[1:42:43] including them in certain clicks at work
[1:42:45] I don't get a bit when they scatter like
[1:42:50] roaches because they see me I don't get
[1:42:53] offended
[1:42:56] the Spirit of God is so great in my life
[1:42:59] I want to be a beacon I want to be a
[1:43:03] living testimony talk about them so I
[1:43:13] you know I've been kind of sharing these
[1:43:15] those thoughts and points you know it
[1:43:16] takes me about 40 minutes to get to work
[1:43:19] 40 minutes back I just read to you I
[1:43:21] just act look quoting see what the Bible
[1:43:23] says redeem the time for the days are
[1:43:27] evil so 40 minutes what do you do in
[1:43:31] your commute you get caught up in the
[1:43:36] frustration of traffic what do you
[1:43:40] listen to when you're driving into work
[1:43:42] now only look around I just look at me
[1:43:49] what do you listen to when you get off
[1:43:52] work and things are really difficult I
[1:43:57] want I want to voice I could cleanse my
[1:44:00] spirit I want to voice I could cleanse
[1:44:03] my soul that could put me in the right
[1:44:05] mind frame so I'll put on a I listened
[1:44:11] to a sermon a brother branham because I
[1:44:13] think about and I did the math you know
[1:44:14] I'm like 40 minutes you know to and fro
[1:44:16] you know that's about 80 minutes you
[1:44:18] know it's been five days within a week
[1:44:20] that's a lot of hours that's a lot of
[1:44:23] time and you come you'll have time to
[1:44:26] find time to talk with God how do you
[1:44:30] fill your lost time if you're so
[1:44:34] uncomfortable that's okay God dealing
[1:44:37] with you cuz I just waste time I used to
[1:44:42] listen to the new station and my wife
[1:44:44] would tell me every time you hear like
[1:44:46] all these distraught things things
[1:44:47] around the world how does that really
[1:44:49] encourage you it I got to thinking about
[1:44:50] like I guess it does it by the time you
[1:44:53] get to work you're frustrated you're
[1:44:55] upset the boss say I want to talk to you
[1:44:57] about what
[1:45:01] because you have no sweetness about you
[1:45:04] your mind is animal is not in the right
[1:45:07] place your spirit is not in the right
[1:45:08] place but if you can fall into the right
[1:45:10] channel no matter what the devil throws
[1:45:13] at you you're ready for the day because
[1:45:15] you're sunny the day with God just talk
[1:45:21] about him a little bit let's talk about
[1:45:24] Jesus the king of King is you can never
[1:45:29] talk enough about Jesus it sets the
[1:45:34] right stage it's that's the right
[1:45:36] atmosphere I'll come to church you know
[1:45:38] I try to condition myself that way and I
[1:45:40] was you know what it was 2002 Thursday's
[1:45:43] ago I was preparing myself for one of
[1:45:45] the most challenging Thursday's of all
[1:45:47] my career and it was one of the best
[1:45:49] Thursdays I've ever had I said well I
[1:45:53] trusted God going into it and if you
[1:45:59] have made week service lord knows you
[1:46:00] need to start your day right because
[1:46:04] Monday nothing happens we have church on
[1:46:06] Wednesday Monday nothing happens
[1:46:07] Tuesday nothing ever happens Thursday
[1:46:10] nothing happens Friday nothing happens
[1:46:13] but Wednesday the devil shows everything
[1:46:16] in the kitchen sink action you know you
[1:46:22] got to get off for it by five o'clock
[1:46:23] you're talking to you talk to someone I
[1:46:25] did o'clock they don't say none me
[1:46:27] you're seeing my 9 o'clock I don't say
[1:46:29] none of you I 3 o'clock don't say none
[1:46:31] of you 459 AG you got quick second I
[1:46:37] don't blame that person is the devil
[1:46:40] trying to stop you from being a church
[1:46:45] now it's one thing if the if the Ox is
[1:46:48] in the ditch but open the reason why the
[1:46:51] Ox is in the disco put it in the ditch
[1:46:53] you gotta have an attitude with the Lord
[1:46:56] I am so excited to go to church tonight
[1:46:59] I want to be there and receive a
[1:47:01] blessing that's I could make it a church
[1:47:06] my ox was in the ditch and me while
[1:47:07] you're falling feeling guilty because
[1:47:08] you put the Ox there
[1:47:12] can we say praise the Lord
[1:47:14] I tell church when you get to the
[1:47:17] stoplight you gotta go go right and go
[1:47:19] home or go left and go go to church when
[1:47:23] you decide to go left to go to church it
[1:47:25] was the Holy Spirit I was that guy that
[1:47:27] was guiding you I let you draw your own
[1:47:31] conclusion if you would the other way
[1:47:34] but they got to talking about Jesus ah
[1:47:37] here's an interesting thing they were
[1:47:38] going in the wrong direction they were
[1:47:41] going to amazing last Jerusalem they
[1:47:44] were going in the wrong direction but
[1:47:46] that didn't stop Jesus from coming to
[1:47:51] their attention he still came looking
[1:47:55] for them and the Bible says in the eyes
[1:47:58] were were holding that they should not
[1:48:01] know him
[1:48:02] now listen to this because I just like
[1:48:04] to dig into the scripture and he jesus
[1:48:07] said unto them what manner of
[1:48:09] communication are these that you have
[1:48:12] one with the other as ye are as you walk
[1:48:15] is our sag so he's asked him what were
[1:48:21] you guys talking about now
[1:48:23] that's that's that's just how God is
[1:48:26] he's knows what they're talking about
[1:48:30] sometimes you just want to hear from
[1:48:32] your lips he drew it to their attention
[1:48:37] and meanwhile keep in mind the world is
[1:48:40] still functioning the world is still
[1:48:43] moving along people you know
[1:48:46] transactions are taking place life is
[1:48:49] continuing but they're missing what God
[1:48:52] was doing so Jesus draws them suffices
[1:48:56] what are you guys talking about when I
[1:48:59] told you ain't nothing that you're gonna
[1:49:00] tell God that he doesn't already know
[1:49:02] there's not one thing that you could
[1:49:05] tell God that he doesn't already know
[1:49:07] that prayer requests that you got this
[1:49:09] morning he wrote about God already knew
[1:49:10] about it he knows about the prayer
[1:49:13] requests but you're gonna write next
[1:49:14] week
[1:49:14] he knows what you're gonna face tomorrow
[1:49:17] this is how God is but he plays in the
[1:49:21] moment he wants to hear from you
[1:49:23] why are you so sad about talk to me a
[1:49:27] little bit because we want to tell
[1:49:30] everybody else they would feel happy
[1:49:31] talking to each other but let's talk to
[1:49:34] him a little bit and one of the most a
[1:49:38] was clear open sensory sit on them all
[1:49:40] right now only a stranger in Jerusalem
[1:49:43] it has not known the things which are
[1:49:45] called to pass in these days and Jesus
[1:49:47] said unto them what things are you only
[1:49:52] a stranger they even know that it was
[1:49:54] Solomon Jesus and that these things
[1:49:58] seems assassin Jesus what things and
[1:50:00] instead of them concerning Jesus of
[1:50:02] Nazareth which was a prophet mighty in
[1:50:04] deed and word before God in all the
[1:50:07] people and how the chief priests and our
[1:50:10] rulers and our rulers delivered him to
[1:50:13] be condemned to death and have crucified
[1:50:16] Him now I want you to follow this next
[1:50:19] verse because here they are expounding
[1:50:24] to Jesus all these things that the
[1:50:28] rulers did that the chief priests did
[1:50:31] and how they conspired so they're
[1:50:35] telling them all these things and then
[1:50:38] in verse 21 it says but we trusted that
[1:50:41] it would have been he which should have
[1:50:44] redeemed Israel now listen to this and
[1:50:47] beside all this today is the third day
[1:50:53] since these things were done why did
[1:51:00] they say that because Jesus said you
[1:51:03] destroyed his body and in three days
[1:51:04] I'll raise it up he says I have the
[1:51:08] power to lay my life down and I have my
[1:51:10] power to raise it up so they held on to
[1:51:13] that word now follow this real carefully
[1:51:19] their doubts about the word did not
[1:51:23] prevent the manifestation from coming to
[1:51:26] pass
[1:51:30] because here was Jesus walking alongside
[1:51:33] with them and listen today's the third
[1:51:37] day where's the act we were looking for
[1:51:42] him we thought he would have been here
[1:51:44] with us he said he wasn't going to rise
[1:51:46] up here he was the manifested word so
[1:51:51] let me put you this way do you believe
[1:51:53] what you're saying amen to or does this
[1:51:59] message just sound good to you how
[1:52:03] deep-rooted is this how incurred is your
[1:52:07] faith because these men they were they
[1:52:11] were regurgitate it back to Jesus the
[1:52:14] same scripture and besides this today is
[1:52:17] the third day we thought you would have
[1:52:19] been here it was looking for him but
[1:52:24] they had doubts they had unbelief they
[1:52:28] struggled I don't know how they imagined
[1:52:32] it in their mind but here Jesus was
[1:52:36] walking with them now I say this to say
[1:52:40] there are things that's happening in the
[1:52:43] world today these events where the Bible
[1:52:49] says Martin events made clear by
[1:52:51] prophecy that's what the prophets
[1:52:53] reached what we see happen in the
[1:52:56] political system it's not by mere
[1:52:59] coincidence but God ordained it what's
[1:53:05] happening in social environments what's
[1:53:07] happening in technology the distractions
[1:53:12] it's happening right now and people are
[1:53:16] distracted by these things and yet Jesus
[1:53:20] is on the scene and their eyes are
[1:53:23] withholding but we'll find out soon as
[1:53:29] they continue to walk with Him he opens
[1:53:32] up their eyes but the Bible talks about
[1:53:34] Laozi's here they're blind miserable
[1:53:37] wretched naked and don't even know it
[1:53:41] and they put Jesus outside they put him
[1:53:48] outside the age so therefore Jesus has
[1:53:52] no value to the age that we're living in
[1:53:57] there are destory why people could say
[1:53:59] certain things and do certain things and
[1:54:02] not be so troubled in the spirit and the
[1:54:08] world is crumbling and falling apart
[1:54:10] like I was saying I was listening to a
[1:54:11] program I saw about the world falling
[1:54:13] apart he's inside my house just falling
[1:54:15] into pieces how sin has gotten worse and
[1:54:18] this was back in the 60s how the world's
[1:54:24] just falling apart and I was something
[1:54:26] the church this is the reason why there
[1:54:28] is such pains and agony and frustration
[1:54:32] and sin is because the bride is getting
[1:54:35] restless she's tired of living in this
[1:54:41] world my spirit grown is within me every
[1:54:47] day I wake up I anticipate a body change
[1:54:49] and when that doesn't happen I grown
[1:54:52] within myself waiting for the change of
[1:54:56] a body and don't you know that you're
[1:55:00] the blood that word that flows to you is
[1:55:02] the reason why this whole earth hasn't
[1:55:04] come and come into full complete
[1:55:06] corruption you're the salvation that's
[1:55:14] preventing this world from completely
[1:55:17] deteriorating but the moment that
[1:55:19] rapture takes place the Bible says you
[1:55:23] remove the salt you are the salt you
[1:55:25] remove the salt and the whole thing goes
[1:55:27] into corruption but the world is missing
[1:55:33] what God is doing to an individual elect
[1:55:36] group so they put Jesus outside of the
[1:55:41] age where is Jesus in your home where is
[1:55:47] he in your Christian walk or are you
[1:55:51] only a Christian when you're in church
[1:55:53] are you only a son of God when you're
[1:55:56] sitting here and people could see what
[1:55:57] you do let me tell you this is just a
[1:56:00] training field the battle is when you
[1:56:02] leave those church doors
[1:56:04] do people see Christ or do they see
[1:56:07] somebody else do people hear Christ or
[1:56:11] do they hear somebody else do you carry
[1:56:14] yourself with the sweet aroma or do
[1:56:17] people want to stay away from you they
[1:56:24] said today's the third day and they were
[1:56:28] missing what was happening in the Bible
[1:56:32] today in certain women also of our
[1:56:34] company made us astonished which were
[1:56:37] early as a Sepulchre and when they found
[1:56:39] out his body they came saying that they
[1:56:41] had also seen a vision of angels which
[1:56:44] said that he was alive and certain of
[1:56:47] them which were with us went to the
[1:56:48] Sepulcher and finally even so as the
[1:56:50] women had said but him they saw not
[1:56:53] Jesus as a gentleman the processes the
[1:56:56] electro lament he'll let you complain
[1:56:58] they'll let you say what you have to say
[1:56:59] just like the man did he'll hear you out
[1:57:05] and when you're done with all your
[1:57:08] reasoning and all your explanations the
[1:57:11] Bible says he said unto them o fools
[1:57:16] slow of heart to believe all that the
[1:57:21] prophets have spoken all that the
[1:57:28] prophets have spoken do you believe all
[1:57:31] this message
[1:57:33] even the one that makes you kind of
[1:57:36] squirmish a little bit you believe that
[1:57:39] when the Prophet Whitman when you pass
[1:57:41] will start preaching about your home do
[1:57:43] you still say Amen when you start
[1:57:46] talking about how you need to conduct
[1:57:47] yourself at work do you still say Amen
[1:57:50] when he talks about your dress attire
[1:57:52] did you still say hey man all that the
[1:57:56] prophets spoke this business this
[1:57:59] message this is not a buffet you can't
[1:58:01] just pick and choose what you want what
[1:58:03] you don't like when the Prophet the bass
[1:58:09] was preaching life after at least when
[1:58:10] he's preaching and things are going good
[1:58:12] I say Amen when I'm when I know I'm
[1:58:16] aligned to what he's preaching I'm a man
[1:58:20] but once in a while you know I get kind
[1:58:22] of beaten into the right path buzzer
[1:58:26] yeah I gotta get straight enough to and
[1:58:29] the baskets are saying something you
[1:58:30] start times going down my alley a little
[1:58:33] bit hurts it's not as loud but I do say
[1:58:37] a man may hurt oh they put a whooping to
[1:58:47] me man I and I'm looking to see who else
[1:58:48] knows about this
[1:58:53] and I left every courage I have amen
[1:58:56] amen
[1:58:59] and meanwhile you send a reflecting as
[1:59:01] if he just was walking with you that
[1:59:03] whole week the attitude that you caught
[1:59:07] that you should have caught the thing
[1:59:09] you say that you shouldn't have said the
[1:59:11] innocent thing that you did that it's
[1:59:13] all so innocent come on somebody I don't
[1:59:17] need to see if a God is watching
[1:59:19] everything you do and so is a devil so
[1:59:27] when you come to church and your pastor
[1:59:29] begins to hit on something that only you
[1:59:32] only you and God knows you got into
[1:59:35] devil God just whispered something into
[1:59:37] your passes here to make that spirit
[1:59:41] uncomfortable
[1:59:44] we as ministers we have an obligation
[1:59:46] they may not be anything going in the
[1:59:48] church but their spirits within the
[1:59:50] atmosphere and they're looking for a
[1:59:53] vessel to anoint it's the ROI given a
[1:59:56] certain thing what hit is strong work we
[1:59:58] will preach against it work we're hidden
[2:00:01] we hit it and you say and people looking
[2:00:02] around on a Hui Tama
[2:00:03] we talking about nobody this is not for
[2:00:06] a particular person but we want to make
[2:00:08] sure that you don't make yourself a
[2:00:09] willingly a willing vessel for that
[2:00:11] spirit because the Spirit is as weak
[2:00:17] until it finds a vessel to use and so
[2:00:21] God why is a man so that we can preach
[2:00:23] against so sin that's out there at that
[2:00:26] in the atmosphere that would be cast
[2:00:28] away from this place and sometimes the
[2:00:32] pastor has to just drive it straight
[2:00:34] home and know that there seems to be
[2:00:36] dealt with and he drives it straight
[2:00:38] home why because he has to clean out the
[2:00:41] church that's his role he has to present
[2:00:45] the church as a chaste virgin unto Jesus
[2:00:46] Christ can we say praise the Lord
[2:00:52] all right another two hours I'm wrapping
[2:00:57] it up I am I'm wrapping it up he says
[2:01:00] all fools and small parts of slow of
[2:01:03] heart to believe all that the prophets
[2:01:04] have spoken all that Christ to have
[2:01:06] suffered these things into inner to his
[2:01:08] glory and beginning at Moses and all the
[2:01:11] prophets he expounded unto them in all
[2:01:14] the Scriptures of things concerning
[2:01:15] himself as they drew nigh unto the
[2:01:18] village whether they win and he made as
[2:01:20] though he would have gone further but
[2:01:23] they constrained him saying abide with
[2:01:26] us for destroyed evening in the days
[2:01:29] it's far spent and he went in and tarry
[2:01:31] with them now in type you look at the
[2:01:37] journey of the seventh church age it's
[2:01:39] not until the seventh church age where
[2:01:41] the Prophet talks about that there's
[2:01:42] there be light in the evening time so
[2:01:45] the day has far been spent and we're
[2:01:48] living in the evening time and meanwhile
[2:01:51] along this journey Jesus is talking to
[2:01:53] them and they don't realize that it's
[2:01:54] Jesus they've heard a noise in Martin
[2:01:57] they heard of noise in John Wester you
[2:01:58] heard a noise in Pentecost but they
[2:02:00] really didn't recognize what that was it
[2:02:03] was not until the end time prophet came
[2:02:04] and talked that was Jesus throughout the
[2:02:05] ages and so by this time the heart is on
[2:02:09] fire
[2:02:10] so the getting ready to go into quiet
[2:02:11] place and it came to pass as he sat at
[2:02:13] meat with him he took bread and he
[2:02:16] probably said it's about hearts and
[2:02:17] praying he probably pray like this our
[2:02:18] Father which art in heaven hallowed be
[2:02:23] thy name and he's breaking the bread and
[2:02:25] meanwhile Cleopas probably sitting with
[2:02:28] his friend open one eyes like I
[2:02:29] recognize that prayer sounds so familiar
[2:02:34] and he goes on say hallowed be thy name
[2:02:37] thy kingdom come that's exactly how
[2:02:39] Jesus were prayed something in that
[2:02:44] prayer brother and says there was
[2:02:46] something he did as he was breaking
[2:02:49] bread with him something in that message
[2:02:56] when you first heard good evening
[2:02:58] friends and the word started to come
[2:03:02] forth something one true in your heart
[2:03:06] yes I'm identified with this message I
[2:03:08] recognize it it sounds so familiar to me
[2:03:13] you never hunger for something unless
[2:03:16] you unless you first had it before I
[2:03:21] love that analogy I never once hunger
[2:03:24] for chicken unless I had chicken because
[2:03:26] I know how chicken tastes like I'm the
[2:03:28] hot fried chicken tastes like I know how
[2:03:30] big chicken tastes like I know I saw a
[2:03:31] chicken things like whenever I'm hungry
[2:03:33] free that's just because I tried it I
[2:03:36] know how fish taste like I know how
[2:03:38] steak tastes like I know how to shrimp
[2:03:40] tastes like but whenever I have a
[2:03:41] craving it's because I tried it before
[2:03:44] when I had a hunger for God when I was
[2:03:48] hoping for something more than
[2:03:49] denominational teachings when I was
[2:03:52] hungry for more than worthy ism it's
[2:03:54] only because way back before the
[2:03:56] foundation of the world I had an
[2:03:58] experience with God I tasted him before
[2:04:01] I recognized that message and its word
[2:04:06] so in the prosper Caymans and begin to
[2:04:08] kind of speak to my soul there was a
[2:04:11] recognition I recognized this word I'm
[2:04:17] like my goodness
[2:04:18] sounds so familiar and they probably
[2:04:22] looked one they probably looked at each
[2:04:23] other at the corner da and 100 escapa
[2:04:27] sizes they're women or to cheat in the
[2:04:29] Bible says he disappeared him vanished
[2:04:31] out of their sight can you just imagine
[2:04:36] the joy that overwhelmed these man that
[2:04:40] Jesus just vanished out since it zips up
[2:04:45] that was it it was so whole excited like
[2:04:50] this do you think it was him but I'm so
[2:04:52] excited and then the Bible talks about
[2:04:55] how did not our hearts burn within us
[2:04:58] while he talked with us by the way and
[2:05:02] he opened up to us the things in the
[2:05:05] scriptures let me tell you they got so
[2:05:10] on fire for God because the Bible says
[2:05:11] that God is a consuming fire I don't
[2:05:14] know about you but a fire doesn't cause
[2:05:15] you just to sit still when I come to
[2:05:22] church I get excited because my god is a
[2:05:26] consuming fire brother and says a church
[2:05:30] without emotion is is dead
[2:05:34] that's the reason why when the devil
[2:05:37] tried to put the Hebrew boys decided to
[2:05:38] a fiery furnace he couldn't kill them
[2:05:40] boys God is a consuming fire that's the
[2:05:44] reason why God defines every laws of
[2:05:46] science that's the reason why Moses
[2:05:47] could explain why burning bush didn't
[2:05:49] burn up because God is a consuming fire
[2:05:52] that's the reason why when you first
[2:05:54] came in contact with this message
[2:05:55] you weren't exciting to cross your legs
[2:05:57] that wall built praise be to God no such
[2:06:00] a fire inside of you such as zeal such a
[2:06:03] determination such privacy the Bible
[2:06:06] says that these men they couldn't sit
[2:06:08] put they ran all the way back to
[2:06:10] Jerusalem to go let the other disciple
[2:06:14] so what's the place and they came
[2:06:17] busting into the room
[2:06:19] and they start sounds the Lord is risen
[2:06:21] indeed he's appeared to Simon it's true
[2:06:23] if they got so excited and what they
[2:06:28] were trying to catch the breath I'm
[2:06:31] closing up whether catching whether
[2:06:32] trying to catch the breath and he tries
[2:06:35] to make activation sigh we saw him he's
[2:06:38] alive who did you see Jesus how do you
[2:06:41] know you saw him he talked with me how
[2:06:43] you know with him he did something that
[2:06:45] we all recognize that was so excited
[2:06:47] they have to share the word with someone
[2:06:51] you know why I had to be - because even
[2:06:54] if he took those two and you put them in
[2:06:55] opposite sides of the earth they were
[2:06:57] both still have the same testimony the
[2:07:03] God that you preached ears the God that
[2:07:04] I preached in Orlando they can
[2:07:07] interrogate brother Duff and Nicollet
[2:07:09] arrogate bilging they'll draw the same
[2:07:10] conclusion jesus is alive and well they
[2:07:14] preach the same thing they believe in
[2:07:17] the same word and I don't need that but
[2:07:18] Jesus back your testimony while these
[2:07:21] men were talking and tried to explain
[2:07:23] what was going on the Bible talks about
[2:07:24] how Jesus came on the scene and by that
[2:07:28] time they were all afraid they were
[2:07:31] looking one to another trying to be
[2:07:32] scientifically explained because I mean
[2:07:34] that's the thing I don't get the Bible
[2:07:35] talks about how Jesus says I will rise
[2:07:37] up in three days
[2:07:38] and yet when these things start to
[2:07:40] happen they got spooked
[2:07:42] I believe there's gonna be a change in
[2:07:46] the body
[2:07:47] I believe he's coming back again
[2:07:50] I believe the Dead will rise don't get
[2:07:52] scooped if you suck see people that you
[2:07:54] recognize start to rise up again because
[2:08:01] I'm under expectation don't be blind if
[2:08:03] I want Hollywood have you believe in
[2:08:05] zombies and supply I'm believing in a
[2:08:07] resurrection I'm believing that we're
[2:08:09] going to return back to a glorified body
[2:08:11] to our body that world where we're
[2:08:13] completely intact not what Hollywood
[2:08:15] paints I'm not gonna get spooked on why
[2:08:18] Hollywood paints I'm looking for someone
[2:08:20] that I've drawn by the way of the grave
[2:08:22] of Saint to rise up and I know that my
[2:08:25] redemption draweth nigh
[2:08:30] it becomes much more than something that
[2:08:34] we come to church and we hear a message
[2:08:37] that a prophet preached a ministry that
[2:08:40] a pastor exhibits a word that that
[2:08:43] encourages it actually becomes a reality
[2:08:47] can we say praise the Lord
[2:08:49] let's all stand to our feet the world is
[2:08:53] missing God these men almost missed them
[2:08:58] in the days of Noah it was sold to build
[2:09:02] an ark in the middle of a hot desert and
[2:09:06] yet the people were criticizing him why
[2:09:07] because the Bible talks about how he
[2:09:08] never rained a do one from the ground
[2:09:10] and watered the face of the earth but
[2:09:12] water never came from the from from from
[2:09:14] the sky but the very idea that water
[2:09:17] would come from the sky it went above
[2:09:20] the people but that's what Noah believed
[2:09:22] and so Noah was in the middle of a
[2:09:24] desert just building a boat just
[2:09:27] hammering away he endured criticism he
[2:09:32] endured laughter he endured these things
[2:09:35] and then not only that but when he got
[2:09:39] into the ark it didn't even rain
[2:09:42] immediately for a period of seven days I
[2:09:47] believe the boat just sat there can you
[2:09:51] just imagine he was like he built this
[2:09:53] boat surely we saw we're gonna see
[2:09:55] something they won nothing happened they
[2:09:58] - nothing happened three nothing
[2:10:01] happened
[2:10:02] four nothing happened five nothing
[2:10:06] happen people went back to man's man's
[2:10:07] undying the boat having this old family
[2:10:11] on the way he was taking crazy
[2:10:14] they five nothing happened they six
[2:10:17] nothing happened that man if you saw a
[2:10:19] lot man get your family out of boat Bay
[2:10:24] 7 my man this is crazy it was
[2:10:32] Oh things started to change a little bit
[2:10:39] they've never experienced water falling
[2:10:41] from the sky and then we're looking at
[2:10:44] that first part like this is very
[2:10:46] unusual and this is pretty awesome
[2:10:49] didn't know what the judgment of God and
[2:10:52] then the rain started to come down they
[2:10:56] won it wasn't so bad they - the water
[2:11:00] kept on getting bigger day three day
[2:11:03] four and nah no I listened to apologize
[2:11:09] I'm sorry day five the water started to
[2:11:13] get bigger the flood started to say
[2:11:16] there's no there's no stronger force in
[2:11:19] the power of water nothing can stop it
[2:11:22] you did you get an ambulance of water
[2:11:25] going through and it's just going to
[2:11:26] plow its way through so the whole earth
[2:11:29] in and out of the water it's no doubt
[2:11:31] know us that the boat started to crack a
[2:11:33] little bit give away a little bit and
[2:11:34] then finally broke loose and by the time
[2:11:36] people crying out judgement was in the
[2:11:40] land and they were missing it so what
[2:11:47] the Bible says they talked about pieces
[2:11:48] safety you'll go back to your work
[2:11:50] tomorrow you'll go back to your regular
[2:11:53] routine your clock-in you do what you
[2:11:57] need to do you go to the grocery store
[2:11:58] life will probably be as the same but
[2:12:02] you need to live it differently you
[2:12:05] can't live it like the people in the
[2:12:06] world something is different you gotta
[2:12:10] be like Noah you got to constantly be
[2:12:12] building that Ark building your family
[2:12:15] building the altar building that prayer
[2:12:17] life building that sacredness you got to
[2:12:20] be vigilant your life got to be
[2:12:22] different can we say praise the Lord we
[2:12:26] turn back to you soldier with by our
[2:12:28] hearts and prayer Lord Jesus we thank
[2:12:31] you for the opportunity that you've
[2:12:32] given unto us the Lord just to share the
[2:12:34] word with your people a little bit
[2:12:36] father I pray in trust that something
[2:12:39] would stay that was of encouragement to
[2:12:40] your people
[2:12:42] the Lord that this was the word that you
[2:12:44] put in my heart today to just expound on
[2:12:46] and I pray the Lord that folks will take
[2:12:49] it pretty seriously we obviously are
[2:12:52] living in the endtime men's hearts the
[2:12:56] Bible sense is showing them for fear we
[2:13:00] see the disturbance in the land both
[2:13:01] here in abroad the rise of faction
[2:13:05] groups that's causing terror but we know
[2:13:07] the type of though of devil that's
[2:13:08] rising that's causing that's trying to
[2:13:10] terrorize your people the word fortifies
[2:13:13] by your spoken word fortifies by your
[2:13:16] blood keep us shielded and protected
[2:13:20] dillard help us to walk circumspectly
[2:13:23] according to your word the world is
[2:13:27] falling apart and we know that the Bible
[2:13:29] says according to Hebrews 13 that
[2:13:31] anything that could be shaken will be
[2:13:33] shaken help us to have an inker help us
[2:13:37] to be grounded and rooted into your word
[2:13:40] in the Lord help us to just echo not
[2:13:44] only echo but also truly believe what
[2:13:46] Paul says that this mortal the living
[2:13:49] must put on immortality that the
[2:13:52] corruptible the dead shot put on
[2:13:54] incorruption of which the Bible is
[2:13:58] saying the Bible says a grave was not
[2:14:00] victory o death where is thy sting
[2:14:03] father keep your people here until the
[2:14:06] appointed time and father we trust that
[2:14:09] even today there could be a change in
[2:14:10] the body but should should life proceed
[2:14:12] as normal tomorrow help us to live a
[2:14:15] life that's so different a life that's
[2:14:18] so called out a life that's worthy of
[2:14:21] the gospel we are peculiar people a
[2:14:25] called out group our spiritual diet is
[2:14:29] different we can't hear everything we
[2:14:32] can't see everything we can't get digest
[2:14:34] everything you've built us up
[2:14:36] differently we know that the Bible says
[2:14:39] were the temple of the Holy Spirit and
[2:14:40] as a result the Bible says that you and
[2:14:43] have it the praises of your people bless
[2:14:46] us all now in Jesus Christ and we pray
