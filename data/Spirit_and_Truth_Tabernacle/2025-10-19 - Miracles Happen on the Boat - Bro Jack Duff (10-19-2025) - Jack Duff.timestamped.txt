[47:38] even know he was in here. Uh but we
[47:41] appreciate him and his wife, Sister
[47:43] Grace. Amen. Being with us.
[47:46] a man from
[47:49] uh the UK there, brother Gwenna's
[47:51] church. Uh brother Kusai was one of the
[47:53] ones that when we would go, we usually
[47:56] always go stay at um uh before the
[48:00] meetings, we stay at Premier Inn down in
[48:05] Earl's Court and um and so Brother Kusai
[48:09] would always uh help us get up to the
[48:11] church. Uh so we appreciate that and
[48:14] it's good to have you. Amen. Uh here
[48:16] with us on today.
[48:18] Praise the Lord. And uh Brother Russell,
[48:22] he don't need no introduction. Amen. Um
[48:26] this is brother Simba's brother, but
[48:27] good to have you, brother Russell. Amen.
[48:29] With us.
[48:31] And I think brother Tro is having a
[48:34] little trouble with the name Muren Gami.
[48:38] Murin Gami.
[48:41] Yeah. Yeah. We got to know them names.
[48:46] Amen. Cuz the sweetest sound that the uh
[48:49] ear ever hears is when somebody
[48:54] calls your name.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we thank God for them. Sister

[49:02] Sister Cindy. So good to have you with
[49:06] us. Amen. Here in uh South Florida. I
[49:10] want to say you're visiting South
[49:12] Florida at the right time. Uh when
[49:15] people experience these weather
[49:17] conditions, it usually pulls them Amen.
[49:20] into South Florida. But the summertime
[49:22] is a little different,
[49:25] but we thank God. Good to have you. Um
[49:27] Sister uh Cindy, God bless you. And I
[49:30] saw two other sisters here. Wait a

[49:43] Now, I'mma I'mma I'mma put Ashley on the
[49:46] spot. I'mma put on the spot because she
[49:48] she blessed me something. She text me
[49:50] this week. Um I was referred to her, me
[49:54] and Sister Erica were referred to her
[49:56] and her husband just to offer some um
[49:59] just marital I don't want I don't like
[50:02] to call it counseling, just advice,
[50:04] right? Because when you tell a man he's
[50:05] going to marital counseling, he think he
[50:07] broke and he need to be fixed and and
[50:10] you can't get him to do nothing but no
[50:12] advice. You got people that's been
[50:14] married 32 years that can tell you
[50:16] something.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; So just take some advice, right? And uh
[50:20] so we we got together and she text me.
[50:23] She say, "Pastor, me and uh my husband
[50:26] still uh using the advice that y'all
[50:29] gave us and we're doing well." And um
[50:35] that blesses me because some folk won't
[50:38] take your advice.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; But uh she stands as a testimony. Our
[50:45] marriage is flourishing
[50:47] &gt;&gt; because we took advice.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. So good to have you, Sister
[50:53] Ashley. Now, who you brought with you?
[50:55] All right. Cynthia, you say God bless
[50:58] you, Sister Cynthia. So good to have you
[51:00] with us on today. Amen. We thank God for
[51:04] all things. And Trell, Trell was here
[51:06] last week. He was out in the parking lot
[51:09] listening and soon as brother Jean
[51:11] finished, he come running up. Brother, I
[51:13] I was listening. I was listening. So
[51:16] this this week he came from the parking
[51:17] lot inside.
[51:20] Good to see you, brother Trellic. God
[51:21] bless you. Amen. You and your son. Amen.
[51:25] Praise the Lord. So we we thank God for
[51:27] all things. Uh, one other thing I just
[51:30] need to make mention of before we get
[51:32] into the word. Uh, I was here with the
[51:35] musicians on Friday night and we were
[51:38] rehearsing and um, I thank God for our
[51:41] musicians. Amen. Just appreciate them so
[51:45] much. Uh, but while I was here, I got a
[51:47] text message uh, telling me that uh,
[51:50] Sister Anderson up in South Carolina,
[51:52] she's the pastor's wife, brother Charles
[51:55] Anderson there at Jesus Christ
[51:56] Tabernacle. uh sister Anderson had
[51:59] passed away and um you know so yesterday
[52:04] I uh uh my my wife just sent me a little
[52:08] reminder say I think it'll be good to
[52:10] call brother Anderson you know just or
[52:12] text him or something. I said yeah I'll
[52:14] certainly do that. So I I jumped on it
[52:16] and and me and brother Anderson probably
[52:18] talked for about 30 minutes and uh he
[52:21] was just sharing you know a lot of
[52:22] little things that that had just you
[52:24] know happened and how they the the
[52:26] church just bought a bus and he said
[52:29] they got seat 37 pastors and they can't
[52:31] wait for something to happen in Florida
[52:33] cuz they want to bring the bus to
[52:35] Florida. And I say well praise the Lord.
[52:37] He he said we just went to Indiana to go
[52:40] to Jeffersonville and and all of that.
[52:41] And he says, "And I didn't want to go
[52:43] because I knew Sister Anderson wasn't
[52:45] feeling well and she wouldn't be able to
[52:46] make the trip." And she said, "If you
[52:48] don't go, you make me feel worse." And
[52:51] uh she say, "So he say so she put
[52:53] pressure on me and made me go on that
[52:55] trip. It was like the first time us
[52:56] taking the bus out and we had a
[52:58] wonderful time, you know, there at
[53:00] brother Nathan Bryan's church and um um
[53:04] you know, so when they they got back,
[53:06] you know, he knew that she wasn't
[53:08] feeling, you know, her best and uh she
[53:11] wasn't eating the way she should. And um
[53:14] you know, but he says um you know, she
[53:17] had been going through cancer uh for
[53:19] over a year and um but he said that uh I
[53:25] guess Friday morning, Friday afternoon,
[53:28] something like that. He she called him
[53:29] into the room and uh when he came into
[53:32] the room, he saw her on her knees uh
[53:36] praying uh to the Lord. And uh he says,
[53:40] "We helped her get back in the bed."
[53:42] head. He said, "But it just the just the
[53:44] it was taking so much out of her just to
[53:46] move around like that." And he says, "Uh
[53:49] she was just laying her in the bed and
[53:51] all of a sudden she just stopped
[53:53] breathing and uh the Lord had called her
[53:56] home." And uh you know, he was he was he
[53:59] was saying it was just so peaceful uh to
[54:02] see her. And I thought of the scripture
[54:04] um precious
[54:07] in the sight of the Lord is the death of
[54:11] one of his saints. And uh you know and
[54:14] how she just she just she just slept
[54:16] away you know so peacefully and uh you
[54:19] know he was just um you know said there
[54:21] was many you know go coming in and out
[54:23] of the house but uh he was just blessed.
[54:25] I think God gave them 52 years of
[54:29] marriage. Um uh something like that. He
[54:32] told me he met her in the ninth grade
[54:35] and uh you know but but they knew each
[54:37] other for 56 years but 52 years of
[54:40] marriage and uh God God was good. Amen.
[54:44] So we want to remember brother Anderson
[54:47] and the family uh in prayer as well as
[54:50] the church. We know it's not easy and
[54:52] and I was just thinking, you know, man,
[54:55] it would be nice if, you know, I could
[54:57] try to slip up there, but I don't know.
[55:00] Uh my wife had to help me realize where
[55:03] I was on the calendar. And uh on next
[55:06] Sunday, I'll be here uh to minister, but
[55:09] as soon as I finish preaching, uh me and
[55:12] some other saints are jumping on a plane
[55:14] and we're headed to Australia for some
[55:16] meetings. Amen. And so, uh, I don't know
[55:19] how I'll be able to navigate this. And,
[55:22] uh, but if I can't, hopefully I can send
[55:24] somebody from the church to be
[55:26] representation, amen, of Spirit and
[55:29] Truth Tabernacle, as the church there in
[55:33] uh, um, uh, Colombia, West Colombia.
[55:36] Jesus Christ tabernacle has been a
[55:38] blessing to us. Amen. And brother
[55:42] Anderson was the one that opened this
[55:44] pullpit to me uh to allow me to preach
[55:47] there. And from him opening that
[55:48] pullpit, I've got many invitations uh
[55:51] throughout South Carolina. But I always,
[55:54] amen, pay respect to him because he was
[55:57] the one to take a step of faith. And and
[55:59] I remember a time where there were
[56:00] brothers in South Carolina telling other
[56:02] brothers, "Don't go visit Spirit and
[56:05] Truth Tabernacle."
[56:06] They said it, "Don't go visit them." and
[56:10] brothers brothers disregarded what they
[56:13] said and came on here anyway. And
[56:15] brother Diggs is one of those brothers
[56:16] that came anyway. And he came when we
[56:19] didn't even have musicians,
[56:22] &gt;&gt; but we worship with our mouths,
[56:25] &gt;&gt; right? And we would just we just make
[56:27] them sweet harmonies
[56:29] and um and and people would come and
[56:31] just hear that like, boy, it's something
[56:33] about this. Now, y'all don't stop
[56:35] singing when we get the music now. Y'all
[56:36] keep singing. But uh but but but I I
[56:39] just remember those times where brother
[56:41] Anderson was there as a um an
[56:43] encouragement and strength to us. So
[56:46] very very uh appreciative of his
[56:48] ministry and even with the um uh we've
[56:51] done for the past couple years we've
[56:53] gone there and we've done some of the
[56:54] marriage uh seminars there and uh I I'm
[56:58] I'm grateful for them opening the doors
[57:00] allowing me and sister Erica to come. We
[57:02] took brother Jonathan and sister Sarah
[57:04] with us uh early this year, but I'm
[57:06] grateful for that. But I want to do it
[57:08] here in Florida. We want to do the same
[57:11] marriage seminar here in Florida. So uh
[57:13] but brother Anderson's been very very uh
[57:15] him and sister Anderson very supportive
[57:17] of of us and we've been, you know, just
[57:18] very appreciative. So let's keep the
[57:21] family in prayer and the church in
[57:22] prayer. Amen. During this season, um
[57:25] we'll rise to our feet. We'll read a
[57:28] scripture and then um we'll have a word
[57:32] of prayer over the word as well as we'll
[57:34] pray uh for brother Anderson and the
[57:37] church. Um this scripture comes out of
[57:40] James 3 and I will tell you um that I'm
[57:44] reading this
[57:47] but you know I I couldn't find the
[57:49] scripture that I was really looking for
[57:51] to really nail this down. But I'm I got
[57:53] to give you something out the word of
[57:54] God. Uh but this scripture that we're
[57:56] reading is really more related to how
[58:00] you should control your tongue.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; That's that's that's what this scripture
[58:04] is related to. Now I'm not preaching
[58:06] that today, but when you read it, it's
[58:08] talking about your mouth.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; All right. Amen. But but it's it's it's
[58:16] it's uh I'm using it in a different
[58:18] context today. Amen. But uh here in um
[58:22] James 3 and verse 4 uh it says, "Behold
[58:27] also the ships
[58:30] which though they be so great and are
[58:34] driven of fierce winds, yet are they
[58:37] turned about with a very small helm,
[58:40] whethersoever the governor
[58:43] listeth." Amen. Let us pray uh over
[58:48] God's word. Father, we come in the name
[58:52] of Jesus.
[58:55] We thank you that we have felt your
[58:58] presence thus far in the worship. And um
[59:02] as we come, Father, to approach the
[59:04] word, we trust that the spirit of God
[59:07] would now speak through your word to
[59:09] each and every heart. Uh help us, oh
[59:13] God, to draw closer to you uh through
[59:15] the understanding and revelation of the
[59:18] scripture. We we ask Lord that um you'd
[59:23] not only remember us as we're gathering,
[59:24] but the church there in South Carolina
[59:28] is gathering and um the matriarch has
[59:31] been called home. The pastor has lost
[59:35] his his wife. And God, I know that
[59:39] church needs your strength and they need
[59:41] your comfort. They need your help. They
[59:43] need your direction. I pray that you
[59:46] would help them, Father, that you would
[59:47] just minister to the needs of the
[59:49] pastor, his children, grandchildren,
[59:52] Lord, the entire family, entire body of
[59:54] believers that are gathered there. May
[59:56] your spirit, Lord, bring comfort. And we
[1:00:00] ask, oh God, that you would just move,
[1:00:02] Lord, in in supernatural ways for them.
[1:00:05] There's also saints in our midst. I got
[1:00:07] text messages from saints that are not
[1:00:09] feeling well in their bodies. I pray
[1:00:11] that you would touch
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; power oning
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; completely whole. God, we give you all
[1:00:16] the glory, the honor, and the praise.
[1:00:19] It's in Jesus' name that we pray. Amen.
[1:00:22] You can be seated in the presence of the
[1:00:25] Lord. Um I want to just start by reading
[1:00:30] this is on the back page, Sister
[1:00:31] Shereice. Uh there's a a little quote
[1:00:34] here from a sermon why Christ speak. And
[1:00:37] uh my inspiration uh comes from uh this
[1:00:41] little quote. Our title today is
[1:00:44] miracles happen in the boat. Amen.
[1:00:48] Miracles happen in the boat. Praise God.
[1:00:53] Amen. Um the why Christ speak there was
[1:00:57] a sermon preached and little statement
[1:00:59] made says now today we are expecting uh
[1:01:02] a great time in the Lord and it says and
[1:01:07] I had uh two or three different texts
[1:01:10] here that I was looking at and I and I
[1:01:13] this is very um uh real to me even
[1:01:16] though this sermon was preached back in
[1:01:17] 1963. I was uh there's I got a little
[1:01:21] sermon that I had in my heart that I
[1:01:23] wanted to minister and I said, "Well, I
[1:01:25] didn't want to bring it today because I
[1:01:26] thought so many saints was going to be
[1:01:28] missing." Uh I knew some that was going
[1:01:30] to be be missing and uh but I said,
[1:01:33] "Well, I I'll maybe go a different
[1:01:34] direction and save that uh when when
[1:01:37] everybody's home." Praise the Lord. Uh
[1:01:40] but uh but so he says he said I had two
[1:01:42] or three different texts here that I was
[1:01:44] looking at and I couldn't couldn't
[1:01:45] figure out just which one I would talk
[1:01:48] on this morning. Says one of them was
[1:01:50] cast your cares on him for he cares for
[1:01:53] you. Now if he cares why not you
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; right? So then another one he says Billy
[1:02:00] Paul not Billy Paul my other son Joseph
[1:02:02] brought me this text a long time ago. He
[1:02:04] was sitting in the room one day and he
[1:02:07] said looking up towards the picture. Uh
[1:02:10] it says Joseph is very fond of boats uh
[1:02:13] like like little boys, boats and horses,
[1:02:15] you know. And he said to me, "Daddy,
[1:02:18] has Jesus got a boat? Has Jesus got a
[1:02:23] boat?" And I said, "I don't know." So
[1:02:26] then after he got up and went out, I
[1:02:28] happened to think,
[1:02:30] "Uh, has he got a boat?"
[1:02:33] And it says, and I took a text from that
[1:02:35] and just marked it down here in my book.
[1:02:37] Has Jesus got a boat? So, Brother
[1:02:40] Brandham's looking to preach that
[1:02:41] sermon. Has Jesus got a boat? Says, and
[1:02:45] I happen to think when he was here on
[1:02:47] earth, he had to borrow a womb to be
[1:02:50] born, I mean to uh to be born in and
[1:02:53] also borrow a grave to be buried in
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; and a boat to preach from. But he's the
[1:03:00] pilot of the old ship of Zion.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we are taking this little
[1:03:07] thought today. Amen. On miracles happen
[1:03:11] in the boat. Glory to God. Miracles
[1:03:14] happen in the boat. So um you know we
[1:03:19] want to just take a quick journey. Amen.
[1:03:23] back in scripture because we there was
[1:03:26] um a boat that God used at the very
[1:03:29] beginning in Genesis. Amen. Uh to save
[1:03:33] uh just a few human beings. But let's
[1:03:36] let's pick up this out of Genesis
[1:03:38] chapter 6. Praise God. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:03:43] Hallelujah. Uh Genesis 6 and we'll we'll
[1:03:46] read. Amen. From here starting at verse
[1:03:49] 14. Now uh we know this uh particular
[1:03:53] passage is really talking about Noah and
[1:03:56] um uh and we we know the story of Noah.
[1:04:01] We we've heard it many a times and uh
[1:04:03] Noah was a man actually the scripture
[1:04:06] says he found grace in the sight of the
[1:04:08] Lord. The earth was at a time where
[1:04:11] there was so much wickedness.
[1:04:14] Uh it was so corrupt uh on the earth in
[1:04:17] Noah's day that that actually God got to
[1:04:20] the spot where he was actually
[1:04:22] disappointed that he had even created
[1:04:25] man, right? Uh and and and and and being
[1:04:29] in such a situation uh God just so fed
[1:04:32] up with sin. Hallelujah. Uh he was so
[1:04:36] fed up with sin that he says, "You know
[1:04:37] what? Uh, I'm going to destroy the earth
[1:04:41] because of the way that men are living
[1:04:43] on the earth. I'm going to destroy it.
[1:04:45] And he decided to destroy it with water.
[1:04:47] But because Noah found grace in his
[1:04:50] sight, he wouldn't destroy Noah and his
[1:04:52] children or whoever else would uh would
[1:04:56] would would hear Noah's message and get
[1:04:58] on the boat.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; Because you see, the miracle happens in
[1:05:03] the boat.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; You can't be off the boat and expect a
[1:05:07] miracle. You have to be in the boat.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And and the Bible clearly
[1:05:13] tells us that as it was in the days of
[1:05:16] Noah, so shall it be in the coming of
[1:05:18] the son of man. So if if if the
[1:05:21] barometer of God was getting amen so
[1:05:23] high that he just could not stand sin on
[1:05:26] the earth. He had to destroy them.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; He'll have to do the same exact thing
[1:05:32] now.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; But I'm going to tell you, there's
[1:05:34] safety if you can get yourself
[1:05:37] in the boat.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; Let's read. Amen. From the scripture.
[1:05:43] Um God gave this message of it's going
[1:05:48] to rain to Noah. And he gave him
[1:05:50] specific instructions of how to prepare
[1:05:52] for this rain and how to sustain through
[1:05:56] these flood conditions. And here he
[1:05:58] tells him, amen. Uh actually, let me go
[1:06:01] back to verse 13. Uh let's just look at
[1:06:04] this because we we see some comparisons
[1:06:07] to where we're living at. Amen. God said
[1:06:10] unto Noah, "The end of all flesh has
[1:06:13] come before me, for the earth is
[1:06:17] filled."
[1:06:19] Hallelujah. The earth is filled with
[1:06:22] violence uh uh uh through them. And
[1:06:25] behold, I will destroy them with the
[1:06:27] earth. It says, "Make the make make thee
[1:06:30] an ark of gopherwood.
[1:06:32] room shalt thou make in uh the ark and
[1:06:35] shalt pitch it within and without with
[1:06:38] pitch. That's so the water couldn't get
[1:06:41] in. He says, "And uh and this is the
[1:06:44] fashion which thou shalt make it of. The
[1:06:48] length of the ark shall be 300 cubits,
[1:06:50] and he says, "The breath of it 50
[1:06:52] cubits, and the height of it 30 cubits,
[1:06:55] a window shalt thou make to to the ark,
[1:06:58] and and and a cubit shalt thou f finish
[1:07:01] it above, and the and the door of the
[1:07:04] ark shalt thou set in the side thereof
[1:07:07] with lower second and third stories
[1:07:09] shalt thou make it." He says, "And
[1:07:11] behold, I even I do bring a flood of
[1:07:14] waters upon the earth to destroy all
[1:07:16] flesh, wherein is the breath of life
[1:07:19] from under heaven, and everything that
[1:07:21] is in the earth shall die." This is
[1:07:24] God's words that are spoken over the
[1:07:26] earth. He says, "But with thee,"
[1:07:29] Hallelujah. Amen. And will I establish
[1:07:31] my covenant, and thou shalt come into
[1:07:34] the ark, thou and thy sons, and thy
[1:07:36] wife, and thy sons wives with thee, and
[1:07:39] of every living thing of all flesh, two
[1:07:42] of every sort shall thou bring into the
[1:07:44] ark, to keep them alive with thee. They
[1:07:46] shall be male and female, of the fowls
[1:07:49] after their kind, and and of cattle
[1:07:51] after their kind, and of every creeping
[1:07:53] thing of the earth after his kind. dew
[1:07:56] of of every sort shall come unto thee to
[1:07:59] keep them alive. He says, "And take thou
[1:08:02] unto thee of all the food that is eaten,
[1:08:04] and thou shalt gather it to thee, and it
[1:08:06] shall be for for food for thee and for
[1:08:08] them." Thus did Noah according to all
[1:08:11] that God commanded him. So did he. So we
[1:08:14] see, you know, Moses following the
[1:08:16] instructions of God and through his
[1:08:18] obedience, we know the end of the story.
[1:08:21] Moses, I'm sorry, Noah survived the
[1:08:25] flood. Not only did Noah survive the
[1:08:27] flood, but his children survived the
[1:08:30] flood. Amen. His his his the the the
[1:08:33] boy's wives, they survived the flood. Of
[1:08:35] all the people that were on the earth,
[1:08:37] these were the only ones that survived
[1:08:39] the flood. Now, now you got to you got
[1:08:41] to go back, Amen. and and and and just
[1:08:44] think about this because um you know as
[1:08:46] as Noah was building this ark uh I I'm
[1:08:50] sure there were other boats that were
[1:08:52] built during that time.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. I'm sure that you know
[1:08:57] there was a lot of uh criticism and why
[1:09:00] would a man build a boat out of gopher
[1:09:02] wood and and why would he do the things
[1:09:04] that he's doing? Mo I mean Noah was
[1:09:06] building according to Amen. a revelation
[1:09:08] that he received from God. And in spite
[1:09:11] of how much criticism he went through,
[1:09:14] how much laughter and how much Amen. how
[1:09:16] much people made fun of him, Noah kept
[1:09:19] hammering away until he got that ark
[1:09:21] established.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; We know the story. It was 120 years Noah
[1:09:26] preached a sermon to the people. He
[1:09:29] would come out and say, "Uh, my sermon,
[1:09:31] my title today is it's going to rain."
[1:09:33] And uh he would come out next Sunday and
[1:09:35] preach the same sermon, it's going to
[1:09:37] rain. And and year after year, it's
[1:09:39] going to rain. And I can imagine the
[1:09:41] people in Noah's church
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; getting very disappointed with pastor,
[1:09:46] you ain't got nothing new to preach
[1:09:48] because you're always preaching by this
[1:09:50] going say, "I got a new sermon next
[1:09:52] week. Come in. I got one for you next
[1:09:54] week. I got a new title." And the title
[1:09:57] is Get in the B.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; My inspiration is going to rain.
[1:10:02] [Applause]
[1:10:03] Hallelujah.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; Here here Noah finds himself just
[1:10:08] preaching and finally get to a spot
[1:10:11] where you know what he had preached had
[1:10:14] become reality
[1:10:16] and all the people that saw the animals
[1:10:20] coming two by two to get on the boat
[1:10:24] and um they're looking at it. I mean,
[1:10:26] Noah's not Noah's not doing anything to
[1:10:28] bring them, but God is sending the
[1:10:30] animals two by two. And these people
[1:10:31] seeing maybe animals crossing through
[1:10:33] their backyards.
[1:10:35] Why they coming two by two? Why they
[1:10:37] headed to that boat? They should have
[1:10:38] known something was going wrong.
[1:10:40] Something was something was up at that
[1:10:41] time. But the people because of the
[1:10:43] hardness of their hearts.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; They they they they couldn't receive
[1:10:48] Noah's message, if I can put it that
[1:10:50] they couldn't receive what Noah was
[1:10:52] saying. Why would God speak something
[1:10:53] like that to him? who was Noah, right?
[1:10:57] He was God's chosen man at that time.
[1:10:59] And here here Noah, amen, has prepared
[1:11:02] this uh this ark and the animals are
[1:11:04] coming. And then all of a sudden, while
[1:11:07] the people are standing outside, they
[1:11:08] see the door to the ark close.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; And it was God himself that brought
[1:11:13] closure to this ark.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; They're knocking on the door asking,
[1:11:17] "Can we come in?" And Noah says, "No, I
[1:11:20] can't. There's nothing I can do because
[1:11:22] this thing has been sealed by Almighty
[1:11:23] God. There's not one thing I can do for
[1:11:25] you now. That's why I want to tell you,
[1:11:27] Amen. Why you got ears to hear what the
[1:11:29] spirit is saying to you? It is time for
[1:11:32] you to get on the boat.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Because miracles happen in the boat,
[1:11:38] sir.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Not not off the boat, not outside the
[1:11:41] boat. You got to be in the boat.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; If you want to be protected, you got to
[1:11:46] be in the boat.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you if you if you want
[1:11:49] salvation, you got to be in the boat. If
[1:11:51] you want deliverance, you got to be in
[1:11:53] the boat.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; Hey, hallelujah. To the lamb of God.
[1:11:58] Here we find Noah. Amen. And and and it
[1:12:02] seems just like an old fairy tale story,
[1:12:04] but it was reality. People lost their
[1:12:06] lives because they did not follow the
[1:12:09] instructions of God. They did not hear
[1:12:11] the word of God. They did not hear the
[1:12:12] message of God. They did not respond to
[1:12:14] it and get themselves on the boat. God
[1:12:16] had prepared a way for the people,
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; but it was up to them to go in the boat.
[1:12:21] Just like they saw the animals go in,
[1:12:22] they had the same opportunity to get
[1:12:25] inside that boat. What are you going to
[1:12:27] do with the opportunity that God has
[1:12:30] given you?
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Here
[1:12:35] we see also in this story of Noah, the
[1:12:39] rain came for 40 days and for 40 nights.
[1:12:43] And um
[1:12:46] you know after the rain subsided, Noah
[1:12:49] decided to send out a a crow. And you
[1:12:52] know and when he sent out the crow, the
[1:12:55] crow's responsibility was to go out and
[1:12:57] and maybe come back and to let Noah know
[1:12:59] whether whether we can come out there
[1:13:01] and live now because you know what
[1:13:02] what's going on, you know, with the
[1:13:04] earth because we we can't see nothing.
[1:13:06] All we see is water. Well, uh the crow
[1:13:08] never came back. And the prophet tells
[1:13:10] us the reason that crow didn't come back
[1:13:12] is because the crow actually had a uh a
[1:13:16] digestive system that would just eat
[1:13:18] anything.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; And all the dead bodies that were all
[1:13:22] over the land, that crow was having a
[1:13:24] smorgas board.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; And and that crow was eating so much say
[1:13:28] I ain't going back to tell nobody
[1:13:30] nothing. I'm going I'm going to eat all
[1:13:32] this dead stuff. But let me tell you
[1:13:33] something. As believers, we don't eat
[1:13:35] dead stuff like that.
[1:13:38] We don't eat that kind of stuff. It does
[1:13:40] not satisfy our appetite.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; So Noah Noah had to send out a different
[1:13:46] type of bird. That the second time he
[1:13:48] sent out a dove and a dove don't eat all
[1:13:50] that dead stuff like that.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; Dove went and got a a a leaf off of off
[1:13:56] of a tree and brought it back and said,
[1:13:58] "You know what? There's life out here on
[1:13:59] the other side of this ark." Now, the
[1:14:02] miracle happened. The miracle was that
[1:14:04] God spared a whole family. Amen.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; Because they got inside
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; the boat.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; There's a statement here that I want to
[1:14:18] read from the sermon, the ark.
[1:14:22] Here it says, "Don't be scared.
[1:14:25] God's driving the winds. God's driving
[1:14:29] the ark. He has all things provided. Why
[1:14:33] Noah wouldn't have," and I like this. He
[1:14:35] says, "Why Noah wouldn't have had any
[1:14:37] victories." Noah would not have had uh
[1:14:41] wouldn't have have had any victories.
[1:14:43] Wouldn't have had storms. It wouldn't
[1:14:45] have been storms and trials if we're
[1:14:48] just put through a little safe tunnel to
[1:14:51] run through. There's no joy. So, if
[1:14:54] we're just kind of put through things, a
[1:14:56] little safe tunnel, the prophet said
[1:14:58] there's no joy to our experience. So
[1:15:01] sometimes you have to go through things
[1:15:03] in order to experience the joy of the
[1:15:05] Lord. Now let me tell you something.
[1:15:07] There's a difference in having the joy
[1:15:10] of the Lord and having happiness.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; See happiness comes because something
[1:15:17] happened to you.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; But joy comes regardless of what is
[1:15:22] happening.
[1:15:25] Oh, I I remember the old song that the
[1:15:28] songwriter wrote say, "I still have
[1:15:30] joy."
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Oh my God. I I still have joy after all
[1:15:36] the things I've been through. I still
[1:15:39] have joy.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Joy, joy, joy is something real.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; And you can have it that that you know,
[1:15:47] like like my God. I mean, God will just
[1:15:49] give you a little song that'll just kind
[1:15:51] of carry you through whatever you're
[1:15:52] going through.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me just finish reading
[1:15:55] this. I want to mention something here.
[1:15:57] He says, he says, um, uh, while Noah
[1:16:00] wouldn't have had any victories,
[1:16:01] wouldn't have had wouldn't have been
[1:16:02] storms and trials, if we just put
[1:16:05] through a little safe tunnel and run
[1:16:06] through, uh, there's no joy. The storms
[1:16:09] of life will make us have the the the
[1:16:11] the storms of life. What makes us have
[1:16:13] the joy? We never know what daylight was
[1:16:16] unless we had some dark.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; We never know what a hilltop was unless
[1:16:21] we had a mountain, right? We we he says
[1:16:24] we never know what good health was
[1:16:26] unless you had some sickness. He says
[1:16:29] you never know how to enjoy salvation
[1:16:32] unless you was once a sinner.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Right. He says God made all
[1:16:38] things the law of contrast. He loves
[1:16:41] you. He loves you. So, don't worry.
[1:16:43] Don't worry about whatever you're going
[1:16:45] through. God's God's got everything
[1:16:46] under control.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; I was looking at Amen. this um
[1:16:52] uh the the role cuz you know that that
[1:16:54] first quote that I that I read to you
[1:16:56] was it says he's the the the
[1:16:59] uh the pilot
[1:17:01] of the old ship of Zion. And I was just
[1:17:04] looking at a man what's what's the role
[1:17:06] of the captain of the ship?
[1:17:09] And you know quick Google search AI
[1:17:12] always comes back with a summarized you
[1:17:14] know version and sometimes you have to
[1:17:17] go deeper than the summarized version.
[1:17:19] Don't just take everything AI said.
[1:17:21] Remember AI is only gathering what other
[1:17:24] people have put out there.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So you just you don't know
[1:17:28] what folks have put out there and AI
[1:17:30] just grabbing from everything.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; So just sometimes go a little deeper
[1:17:33] than your AI search. But but in this
[1:17:35] one, you know, the the captain of the
[1:17:37] ship is responsible for the vessel's
[1:17:39] safety. The captain of the ship is
[1:17:42] responsible for the navigation and the
[1:17:45] well-being of everybody that is on board
[1:17:48] the ship. Hallelujah. I'm so glad he's
[1:17:51] my captain.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; The the captain of the ship, Amen, is is
[1:17:55] also responsible for the well-being of
[1:17:57] the crew and the passengers. Amen. uh he
[1:18:00] also has to he has to give command and
[1:18:03] and crew management and extreme ad
[1:18:05] administrative duties like handling
[1:18:07] cargo and navigating routes and ensuring
[1:18:09] compliance with uh maritime laws and
[1:18:12] regulations. He says they must be
[1:18:14] prepared to make critical decisions. It
[1:18:17] says particularly during emergencies and
[1:18:19] serve as the primarily with external
[1:18:22] authorities. This captain has a lot of
[1:18:24] responsibility and I'm like I said I'm
[1:18:26] so glad that God is the captain. He's
[1:18:28] responsible for all of us that are on
[1:18:30] board.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. I I was I was I was
[1:18:35] inspired to write say he he's not only
[1:18:37] God of what's happening in the land.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; He's also God of what happens on the
[1:18:42] sea.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He's also God in the
[1:18:46] heavens.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's God of the entire universe.
[1:18:50] So no matter where you find yourself,
[1:18:52] he's still God.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. I
[1:18:56] was I was listening to a little video
[1:18:58] this week. Amen. Uh something passed
[1:19:01] through on my feed there on Facebook and
[1:19:03] it was a preacher. Amen. Talking about
[1:19:06] um you know he was on a flight and uh
[1:19:10] and as he was on this flight this they
[1:19:11] experienced some tremendous turbulence
[1:19:13] and you know it was a storm out and and
[1:19:15] and he was you know all in the middle of
[1:19:17] the storm. He says but he was just one
[1:19:19] of those people that didn't really like
[1:19:21] sitting on a plane and uh having the
[1:19:23] window shade closed. So he had a pilot
[1:19:26] sitting next to him. Happened to be on
[1:19:28] this plane. There was a pilot there. And
[1:19:30] he say he asked the pilot said, "Could
[1:19:32] you just open up the the window shade,
[1:19:34] you know, because I I just don't like
[1:19:35] sitting here and I just need to see
[1:19:37] what's happening out there." So he said
[1:19:39] he said, "Well, open up the window
[1:19:40] shade." So the man lifted up the window
[1:19:42] shade and says, "Okay." And as he's
[1:19:44] looking and he can see lightning here
[1:19:46] and and and and and a rock here and and
[1:19:49] just a rumble here and and he like, "Oh
[1:19:51] my goodness." He said, he said, "Do they
[1:19:54] see what we see up there at the at the
[1:19:56] at the in in the pit?"
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; He said, "No, no, they don't see it. Not
[1:20:00] the way you see it." He said, he said,
[1:20:02] he said, "They trained not to look at
[1:20:04] it."
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said what they trained to
[1:20:08] do is to look at what the flight plan
[1:20:10] says.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; He say they trained to also look at,
[1:20:13] amen, what the what the navigation
[1:20:15] system is saying. He said, "So they keep
[1:20:18] their eyes on the flight plan and they
[1:20:20] keep the eyes on the navigation and they
[1:20:22] not looking at what you're looking at."
[1:20:24] He say navigation system told them that
[1:20:28] they were going to be approaching a
[1:20:29] storm before they even got to it. And
[1:20:32] the navigation system shows them how
[1:20:34] they going to get out of the storm.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; He said, "You only looking at what's out
[1:20:39] the window, but you got to look at the
[1:20:41] navigation system."
[1:20:44] Hallelujah. You only going through the
[1:20:46] storm. You You're not going to stay in
[1:20:48] this. You coming out of this somehow.
[1:20:52] Just stay inside the boat.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Stay in the boat. Don't get out the
[1:21:00] boat. Stay in the boat because miracles
[1:21:03] will happen inside.
[1:21:05] [Applause]
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Inside the boat.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:12] the the governor got this thing under
[1:21:14] control. He's taking instructions from
[1:21:17] the captain.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; You ain't got to worry about it.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; And you I'm going to try to steal this.
[1:21:23] No, you don't even know what you're
[1:21:24] doing. Just
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; sit down. And maybe the best thing you
[1:21:27] should do is lower your shade.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; That way you can't see and get
[1:21:32] distracted.
[1:21:40] We get too distracted by what other
[1:21:42] folks saying and what other folk doing.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I I I got a little something
[1:21:48] here and I don't know if I I'm going
[1:21:50] just see it now. You know there's you
[1:21:52] know before a storm actually happens
[1:21:55] u the way a storm is is is designed is
[1:21:58] that one cloud
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; connects with another cloud.
[1:22:04] And then them two clouds connect with
[1:22:06] another cloud.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; And then them three clouds connect with
[1:22:09] another cloud. And say when you get all
[1:22:11] these clouds together, that's when the
[1:22:12] storm begin to brew.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; And here's what I want to tell you. When
[1:22:16] you just get one cloud of doubt, don't
[1:22:18] let that cloud connect with another
[1:22:20] cloud of doubt.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; Now you got two clouds of doubt. And
[1:22:25] before you know it, you got another
[1:22:26] third cloud. And when they all get
[1:22:28] connected, you have a storm brewing in
[1:22:30] your life.
[1:22:32] Hallelujah. And when the storm get to
[1:22:34] brewing, you thinking about getting off
[1:22:36] the boat. But I'm here to tell you,
[1:22:38] don't you get off the boat. You stay in
[1:22:41] the boat because miracles will happen in
[1:22:44] the boat.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; Let me
[1:22:56] look at a scripture here out of
[1:22:59] Luke 5.
[1:23:03] miracles happen
[1:23:05] in the boat
[1:23:10] and I'm so glad that he's the pilot
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; of the ship of Zion.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; There's u this story in Luke 5 and let
[1:23:21] me just kind of set this up. I'll start
[1:23:24] reading at uh verse
[1:23:27] one. But
[1:23:30] um brother Brandham gives us a
[1:23:33] description of this in the sermon at thy
[1:23:35] word. I won't read the quote. Let me see
[1:23:37] here.
[1:23:40] It gives us a description of what was
[1:23:43] going on on this day as we approach Luke
[1:23:46] 5. What what happened here is um
[1:23:52] Peter and his his
[1:23:56] co-workers
[1:23:58] had come in from a night of fishing and
[1:24:01] they caught nothing.
[1:24:03] I mean all night fishing
[1:24:06] and there was nothing. And I I don't
[1:24:08] know if they had Garmin systems like we
[1:24:11] have nowadays to kind of tell you where
[1:24:12] the fish are. And and I have I've even
[1:24:14] seen I've been on boats where the
[1:24:16] garment garment tell me that fish over
[1:24:18] there and we get there and still you
[1:24:20] ain't get nothing.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; Peter them they knew the sea. They knew
[1:24:26] they understood a lot of things about
[1:24:28] it. And as they're out fishing that
[1:24:30] night they were this was their their
[1:24:32] business. They needed they needed fish
[1:24:35] in order to sell to the market so they
[1:24:37] could sustain their families. They they
[1:24:39] need these things.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We need certain things in
[1:24:44] our business to sustain our families.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But but when you get into a
[1:24:49] spot where you need now just just
[1:24:51] remember, don't get out the boat.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God will bring the fish to
[1:24:56] you if you stay in the boat.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. So so so Peter. Amen. They're
[1:25:02] they're they're what happens is that
[1:25:04] they uh they go through this situation
[1:25:07] where there's no fish and and and you've
[1:25:09] gone through a night like this where I I
[1:25:11] didn't man I didn't catch nothing. I
[1:25:13] can't I I I was thinking about that bill
[1:25:15] that I had to pay and I ain't got no I
[1:25:18] was expecting to get enough money. Amen.
[1:25:21] Out of selling these fish so I can go
[1:25:22] pay that bill and I ain't caught
[1:25:24] nothing. I done wasted all my bait. I
[1:25:29] done I mean I man this ain't this ain't
[1:25:32] this ain't going to work at all. I I
[1:25:34] really needed me something.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; Anybody ever been there?
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; But but but but but Peter, so you know,
[1:25:43] he just happens to dock his boat at a at
[1:25:46] a particular spot and it just so
[1:25:48] happened on that day where he docked his
[1:25:50] boat, Jesus came to that area and he be
[1:25:53] to preach a sermon.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Oh my, I love this. And
[1:25:59] and and brother Adam say, "Peter," he
[1:26:02] said, "You know what? I ain't caught
[1:26:03] nothing, but you know what? Let me go
[1:26:05] hear what this guy got to say."
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Let me just see what he going to say. I
[1:26:09] mean, I I've been hearing a lot about
[1:26:12] him. So, you know, he church is
[1:26:14] happening right here. So, why don't just
[1:26:15] go and just check him out and see what
[1:26:17] he got to say. Peter's sitting there,
[1:26:19] but he's sitting there with the wrong
[1:26:20] attitude in church. Oh, Lord. He's
[1:26:23] sitting there with an attitude of, you
[1:26:25] know, let me just see what he going to
[1:26:26] say. And if he say the wrong thing, I'm
[1:26:28] up and I'm out of there.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; He had a very discouraged disposition as
[1:26:37] he was sitting in church, you know, and
[1:26:38] we're not supposed to come to church
[1:26:39] that way. We should come to church with
[1:26:41] expectation, believing God is going to
[1:26:43] speak to our needs.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; You you you know, in the in the in the
[1:26:49] in the Old Testament, Amen. And I
[1:26:52] believe it was Nehemiah, they could not
[1:26:53] go into the king's presence
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; discouraged.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; In the book of Nehemiah, you'll find
[1:27:00] they could I mean, the king said, "What
[1:27:02] you doing? I mean, you ain't never been
[1:27:03] like this. What's going on with you?"
[1:27:05] And he had to explain what was
[1:27:06] happening. But you couldn't go into a
[1:27:07] king's presence discouraged. No matter
[1:27:09] what you was going through, you still
[1:27:11] had to come in with a smile on your
[1:27:12] face.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; What about coming into the house of God?
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:27:19] Like brother brother Westco say, you
[1:27:20] know, don't don't don't tell us you in
[1:27:23] the fire. We smell the smoke.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; We see smoke signals going up all around
[1:27:27] you.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Don't tell us you're in the fire. We see
[1:27:29] it. We see it. But I tell you what, you
[1:27:32] want to get to a spot where no matter
[1:27:34] what I'm going through,
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; You know, oh Lord have mercy.
[1:27:41] I
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; sometimes we got to get to a spot where
[1:27:43] our best shout
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; is not after we done overcome something.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; Our best shout should be in the middle
[1:27:52] of what we going through.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you got to let the devil know
[1:27:56] whose side you on.
[1:28:00] Brother, I can shout whether I have it
[1:28:02] or not. The reason I shout because I
[1:28:05] know what I'm looking for is on the way.
[1:28:07] And I'm praising God before it happens.
[1:28:10] And I'll praise him after it happens. He
[1:28:13] going to get two praises.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; But Peter had a very very discouraged
[1:28:26] Amen. approach as he went into the the
[1:28:28] service.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Very discouraged. And let's just kind of
[1:28:32] pick them up here, you know, in
[1:28:34] scripture in Luke 5:1. And it came to
[1:28:38] pass
[1:28:40] that as the people pressed upon him to
[1:28:42] hear the word of God, he stood by the
[1:28:44] lake of
[1:28:46] Janoserate,
[1:28:48] and saw two ships standing by the lake.
[1:28:51] But the fishermen were gone out of them
[1:28:53] and were washing their nets.
[1:28:57] And he entered into one of the ships,
[1:28:59] which was Simon's,
[1:29:02] and prayed him that he would thrust out
[1:29:04] a little from the land. And he sat down
[1:29:07] and taught the people out of the ship.
[1:29:10] Now, you know, the beautiful thing about
[1:29:12] this is Jesus knew exactly what he was
[1:29:14] doing.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; He'd already known what Simon's night
[1:29:18] was like. He already known that the man
[1:29:20] ain't caught no fish. He already known
[1:29:22] that was his business. Didn't even know
[1:29:24] Simon like that. But but but but him
[1:29:26] being God,
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; he knew all things.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; And it was not by accident that he just
[1:29:33] happened to step up on Peter's boat.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; And then he then he tested him a little
[1:29:39] bit. He said, "Now just, you know, these
[1:29:41] people as as I'm preaching, they pushing
[1:29:44] me further and further into the water
[1:29:45] and I got to get on a boat and and just
[1:29:48] get a little separation from the people
[1:29:49] so they don't even have they don't come
[1:29:51] out here and try to get in this boat."
[1:29:52] He said, "But just just push back just a
[1:29:54] little bit." Now, this is a little test
[1:29:56] for Peter. Are you going to be obedient
[1:29:58] to what the man is saying? Have you
[1:29:59] heard enough in his sermon that you can
[1:30:03] be obedient?
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; It says, he says, "Okay." And he pushes
[1:30:07] back. Verse four.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; No, I'm sorry. Uh, yeah. Yeah. Thrust
[1:30:16] out a little from the land, and he sat
[1:30:18] down and taught the people out of the
[1:30:19] ship. Verse four.
[1:30:22] Now when he had left speaking,
[1:30:25] he said unto Simon,
[1:30:28] "Launch out into the deep
[1:30:32] and let down your nets
[1:30:34] for a drought." That means a a big
[1:30:37] catch.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; A big catch. I mean, you know, now now
[1:30:41] in order for in order for Simon to get
[1:30:45] this drought, he going to have to follow
[1:30:48] the instructions
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; clearly.
[1:30:51] Launch out into the deep. Hallelujah.
[1:30:55] And get your nets ready for a big I know
[1:30:57] you just finished getting your nets all
[1:30:59] prepared. I saw you over there working
[1:31:00] on the nets and you just and you're so
[1:31:02] discouraged like you hanging these
[1:31:03] things up. We'll try to go back out
[1:31:05] tonight. No, no, no, no. I ain't say
[1:31:06] tonight. Right now, launch out into the
[1:31:10] deep
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; and get ready for the drought.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; Look at what Peter say. Because Peter
[1:31:18] there, I'mma say it like this. There's a
[1:31:20] little bit of all of us
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; inside of Peter.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; we can see our own characteristics
[1:31:27] inside this man.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; You if if you would have been one of the
[1:31:30] disciples, you would have been Peter.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Simon answered,
[1:31:41] answering said unto him, Master,
[1:31:45] we have toiled all the night. Pretty
[1:31:48] much we tired. We ain't we done put our
[1:31:50] put we done put our nets up. No, no, no,
[1:31:52] no. We was just coming to church just to
[1:31:54] hear this sermon. Now we going home. No,
[1:31:56] no, no, no, no. Launch out into the deep
[1:31:59] and get ready for the trout.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; And Simon answered, said unto him,
[1:32:04] Master, we have we have toiled all the
[1:32:06] night and have taken nothing.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Oh my my my my. Look at this. Look at
[1:32:11] this. And I can just, you know, you got
[1:32:14] to pause sometimes when you're reading
[1:32:16] the scripture because I can see him tell
[1:32:18] Jesus this and Jesus just looking at
[1:32:20] him.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; Did you hear what I said, Jesus? We
[1:32:27] tooured all night and we caught nothing.
[1:32:35] Didn't say a word to him. So then the
[1:32:37] next words that come out of Peter's
[1:32:39] mouth is nevertheless.
[1:32:41] Oh, good God almighty.
[1:32:43] Nevertheless, I'mma tell you, God need
[1:32:46] one of your nevertheless.
[1:32:47] [Applause]
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; I I don't care what you going through
[1:32:52] this morning. Give God a nevertheless.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; I I'm going to move at what you tell me,
[1:33:01] Father. If you spoke it in your word,
[1:33:03] I'mma move out with that. I can't figure
[1:33:06] it out. I don't understand it, but
[1:33:08] nevertheless,
[1:33:10] Amen.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Look here.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; Peter is about to experience something.
[1:33:17] But notice now, this experience would
[1:33:19] not have happened had he been on the
[1:33:21] shore.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; Peter needed to be
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; in the boat
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; because miracles happen
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; in the boat.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; Look at what he says.
[1:33:40] I just love it. Nevertheless,
[1:33:43] at thy word,
[1:33:46] I will let down the net. Like you're
[1:33:49] doing God a favor.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; You ain't doing God no favors.
[1:34:01] When when you come to church, you are
[1:34:03] not doing God a favor. Amen.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; God doing you a favor
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; by speaking to you when you get here.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; But you got to have the right attitude
[1:34:14] when you're approaching the Lord. If you
[1:34:15] want to see miracles in your life, you
[1:34:17] got to have the right attitude.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Look at this. It says
[1:34:25] verse six. And when they had this done,
[1:34:30] they enclosed a great multitude of
[1:34:32] fishes
[1:34:34] and their net
[1:34:36] break. Went from nothing
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; to your nets breaking.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; And and and look at this. It was it was
[1:34:44] so bad that that the the nets this is
[1:34:46] what we call overflow.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; When when when the nets were breaking,
[1:34:50] look at what they had to do. They had to
[1:34:51] call some neighbors
[1:34:53] to come and help them with this. When
[1:34:56] your business get to moving so much, you
[1:34:58] got to get somebody else to help you
[1:35:00] with the business.
[1:35:02] [Applause]
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. This is what overflow
[1:35:05] looks like.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; It says, "And they and they beckoned
[1:35:12] unto their partners which were in the
[1:35:14] other ship that they should come and
[1:35:17] help them, and they came and filled both
[1:35:19] the ships.
[1:35:20] So they so that they began to sink.
[1:35:23] Typically what would cause a ship to
[1:35:25] sink is that if water gets into the
[1:35:27] ship,
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; but this was happening because they had
[1:35:30] an abundance
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; of fish.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; I'd like for my bank account to begin to
[1:35:39] sink.
[1:35:45] Amen.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; Woo Lord
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; because of abundance.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; Not sinking the negative but sinking the
[1:35:54] positive.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; When Simon saw it, when Simon Peter saw
[1:36:03] it, he fell down at Jesus' knees,
[1:36:04] saying, "Depart from me, for I'm a
[1:36:06] sinful man, O Lord." for he was
[1:36:08] astonished and all that were with him at
[1:36:12] the drought of of the fishes which they
[1:36:15] had taken.
[1:36:17] And so is also James and John the son of
[1:36:20] Zebedee which were partners with Simon.
[1:36:22] And Jesus said unto Simon, "Fear not,
[1:36:24] from henceforth
[1:36:27] thou shalt catch men."
[1:36:29] And when they had brought their ships to
[1:36:31] land, they forsook all
[1:36:34] and followed him. One miracle
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; caused them to forsake everything and
[1:36:40] follow him.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; I mean, look, he's concerned. Everything
[1:36:43] in your life, he is concerned about. And
[1:36:46] just just just he knew that this was
[1:36:48] their business. And he blessed them in
[1:36:50] their business with overflow.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; But it was all a test to see if they
[1:36:55] would just be obedient. Look, look,
[1:36:57] look, look. Miracles happen
[1:37:00] in the boat.
[1:37:02] In the boat. And I'm I'm sure Peter is
[1:37:06] happy he had his boat on shore that day
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; in order to experience this great
[1:37:10] miracle. Hallelujah. There was a
[1:37:13] statement that was made in the sermon um
[1:37:17] at thy word. I'm going right to
[1:37:19] paragraph 29 on that sermon at thy word.
[1:37:23] Just put in the u the quote that I that
[1:37:26] I told you, but just scroll down to
[1:37:27] paragraph 29. Uh
[1:37:31] says this. He says, "I can just see him
[1:37:33] moving up just a little closer all the
[1:37:36] time, and the crowds got great. I can
[1:37:38] hear him get into the boat, thrust out a
[1:37:42] little from the bank, and look at this.
[1:37:44] And he borrowed a ship from Simon."
[1:37:48] After he got through speaking, he said,
[1:37:50] "Simon, now you launch out into the deep
[1:37:53] and let down for the drop." And this is
[1:37:55] a statement I want you to get. Jesus
[1:37:58] never
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; powering
[1:38:01] But what he will pay you back a
[1:38:03] hundfold.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus
[1:38:10] never borrows nothing from you that he
[1:38:14] will pay you back
[1:38:17] a hundfold.
[1:38:19] This is where I invoke
[1:38:23] my promise.
[1:38:25] He told me that if I was to be a
[1:38:28] faithful tithe payer,
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; then what he promised me is that when I
[1:38:34] ran through some stormy seas in my
[1:38:37] finances that he would rebuke the devour
[1:38:41] for my sake. Not only did he promise me
[1:38:44] that, he also said that he would open
[1:38:47] the windows of heaven and pour me out
[1:38:50] blessings where I would have room not
[1:38:52] enough to receive. So, I'm invoking my
[1:38:55] inheritance on that promise.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; Jesus
[1:39:02] never borrows nothing from you
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; but what he will pay you back a
[1:39:08] hundfold.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; I thank God for that. Let me move on.
[1:39:14] We find in the book of Mark
[1:39:22] chapter 4.
[1:39:28] Another situation here
[1:39:31] where our Lord is on the boat.
[1:39:36] Now, um
[1:39:40] verse 35 it reads as follows. It says um
[1:39:46] I'm sorry. Yeah. Yeah. Verse 35.
[1:39:50] And the same day
[1:39:54] when the evening was come, he saith unto
[1:39:56] them, let us pass over unto the other
[1:39:58] side.
[1:40:02] And it says, "And when they had sent
[1:40:03] away the multitude, they took him even
[1:40:05] as he was in the ship. And there also
[1:40:10] with him other little ships." Now
[1:40:12] remember that the captain of the ship is
[1:40:14] responsible for all those that are on
[1:40:16] board.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; It it's his responsibility to take care
[1:40:20] of them. No matter what the conditions
[1:40:23] are, the captain has to make sure he
[1:40:26] takes care of you.
[1:40:28] Look at this now. It says,
[1:40:31] "There arose a great storm of wind and
[1:40:35] the waves beat into the ship so that it
[1:40:38] was now full.
[1:40:41] And he was in the hinder part of the
[1:40:42] ship asleep on a pillow.
[1:40:46] And they awake him and say unto him,
[1:40:48] "Master,
[1:40:52] carest thou not that we perish."
[1:40:57] And sometime we feel like God ain't
[1:40:58] going to bring us through this. I don't
[1:41:00] know how I'm going to get out. Let me
[1:41:01] tell you something right now. Lower your
[1:41:03] shade.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; Lower your shade. You looking at the
[1:41:07] wrong thing.
[1:41:09] Amen.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; Do you know who on the boat with you?
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; And and and can you
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; on tell something? When I look at this,
[1:41:21] there's a couple things I grab. First of
[1:41:23] all is when we're going through, he want
[1:41:25] us to act the way he was acting. You
[1:41:27] know what he did while he was going
[1:41:28] through?
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; Why you up at night?
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; Why you walking the floor at night?
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; Go to sleep. Amen.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; He He the Bible say he gives his beloved
[1:41:42] sleep.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You need to recognize
[1:41:46] who you are in him. No. No. Don't be
[1:41:48] worried about how this going to get paid
[1:41:49] and how that's God going to God going to
[1:41:51] meet the need.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; God going to do it.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; I know. I know. I know he will. I know
[1:41:57] he will. I've seen him do it.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; It says here, "Carest thou not that we
[1:42:06] perish?" And he arose
[1:42:09] and rebuked the wind
[1:42:12] and said unto the sea, "Peace."
[1:42:16] See, I like this because Sister Tina
[1:42:17] told me, she heard somebody say, "When
[1:42:19] he spoke peace," he was talking to the
[1:42:21] wind.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; And when he said, "Be still," he was
[1:42:24] talking to the sea. So both elements
[1:42:28] had to bow at his voice.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; Peace be still.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; Right? He says, he says, "And and the
[1:42:34] wind ceased and there was a great calm."
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; Now, notice this. Now, all this happened
[1:42:40] through the spoken word.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; And they would have never heard the
[1:42:46] spoken word had they not been
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; in the boat.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; Look at this.
[1:42:55] He says, um, and he said, and he said
[1:42:58] unto them, why are ye so fearful?
[1:43:01] How is it that you have
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; Jesus? It's a storm out here and we
[1:43:09] dying. We about to die out here. And you
[1:43:10] say we got no faith. Yeah. I say you got
[1:43:12] no faith because you looking at the
[1:43:14] wrong thing.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; You should have been looking at the
[1:43:16] storm. You should have been looking at
[1:43:18] who was in the boat with you.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; That you have no faith. And they fear.
[1:43:25] They feared exceedingly said one to
[1:43:26] another, "What man of man is this that
[1:43:30] even the wind and the sea
[1:43:33] obey him?"
[1:43:35] Let me just read out of a a sermon here.
[1:43:40] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[1:43:42] and forever. And I want to just kind of
[1:43:44] catch this one because
[1:43:46] Jesus did something here that we all
[1:43:49] need to be able to step into.
[1:43:53] God's prophet made this statement. He
[1:43:54] says, um, now Jesus crossing in the boat
[1:43:58] quickly now, just a few minutes crossing
[1:44:00] the sea. I can just imagine how that he
[1:44:03] was. He preached all day and that night
[1:44:05] a big storm come up in on the sea and
[1:44:08] and like to sunk the little boat and
[1:44:10] weary and tired. Look at this now. He
[1:44:14] was weary. He was tired but never
[1:44:18] afraid.
[1:44:22] You might be weary. You might be tired,
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; power on, caring,
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; weary, tired, but never afraid. He says,
[1:44:31] I like that. Look at this the statement.
[1:44:33] He says, Jesus didn't have to go out and
[1:44:37] fast all day.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about when he was in the
[1:44:40] middle of a storm.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, you you know the problem is people
[1:44:45] try to pray up when they get in the
[1:44:46] storm. You need to already be prayed up
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; before the storm storm come,
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; right? He He says Jesus didn't have to
[1:44:54] go out and fast all day and pray all
[1:44:56] day.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that?
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; The first thing we want to do is as soon
[1:45:03] as trouble hit us, let's fast.
[1:45:07] Let's let's pray. No. If you had a
[1:45:09] rhythm already in your life where you
[1:45:10] were already fasting, like I I I take
[1:45:13] Tuesdays, that's my day. That's my fast
[1:45:15] day. It's a rhythm in my life. So when
[1:45:17] storms come, I ain't got to go try to
[1:45:18] fast. I've already been fasting,
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; right? I already been fasting. So, so,
[1:45:24] so, so now watch this statement. Watch
[1:45:25] this statement that the prophet's going
[1:45:26] to make because we need to move into
[1:45:27] this this arena. Watch this. Now, he
[1:45:29] says, he says, Jesus didn't have to go
[1:45:31] out and fast all day and pray all day
[1:45:32] and then say, now I wonder if I got
[1:45:34] faith enough to do this. He was
[1:45:36] unconscious of the faith that he had.
[1:45:38] Amen.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; It's time for us to move to unconscious
[1:45:44] faith
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; that when things happen, we just
[1:45:48] respond.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; No, not not respond with I'm I'mma fast
[1:45:52] about it. I'mma pray now. I'mma open my
[1:45:53] mouth and I'mma speak to this thing.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; Because I know he is greater is he
[1:45:58] that's in me than he that's in the
[1:46:00] world. So, I'm going to open my mouth
[1:46:02] and speak.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; It's unconscious faith.
[1:46:10] He says any man or woman that ever make
[1:46:13] a real warriors in the kingdom of God is
[1:46:15] perfectly unconscious to their faith.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord have mercy.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; He said you keep trying to test your
[1:46:26] faith.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; When your faith going to pass the test?
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; How many years you've been testing your
[1:46:32] faith?
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; No. No. You already know you got it. Now
[1:46:35] it's time to become unconscious of it
[1:46:37] and just operate and act in the way God
[1:46:39] has ordained you to do.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; Power on pairing.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; Unconscious faith. That's a sermon
[1:46:46] already all in itself. Unconcious
[1:46:49] faith.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; When Jesus was walking on the water,
[1:46:55] that's unconscious faith,
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; right? He not he not worried about
[1:46:58] whether whether he gonna sink or not.
[1:47:00] And when when Peter got out the boat,
[1:47:02] that was unconscious faith. He looking
[1:47:04] at what Jesus doing said. Now if it if
[1:47:06] it's if it if it's you
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; connected
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; if it really be you bid me to come.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; When Jesus said come on come on right
[1:47:11] here. And Peter get out there walking
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; in a storm y'all. This was not what
[1:47:18] peaceful this was a peaceful conditions.
[1:47:20] This was in a storm. Peter was walking
[1:47:22] under water.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; The only reason Peter sunk is that he
[1:47:25] started looking out the window.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; He was looking out the window. He should
[1:47:31] have lowered the window shade.
[1:47:34] and just kept walking.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; Keep your eyes on Jesus
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; and keep on walking, Peter.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; But I'm telling you, I I'm just one, the
[1:47:42] Bible does not say this, but I'm one in
[1:47:44] my own imagination. When when Peter
[1:47:46] began to sink and Jesus reached down and
[1:47:48] picked him up, I do not see Jesus
[1:47:50] carrying Peter back to that boat.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; If you walked out here, you're going to
[1:47:55] walk back.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; We got to be unconscious of our faith.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; Says, "Wonder if I got enough faith to
[1:48:09] do this. Have I got faith?" Don't test
[1:48:11] your faith.
[1:48:13] God said so. Do it anyhow. God said so.
[1:48:18] Have you ever tested your faith whether
[1:48:20] you have enough faith to come uh to the
[1:48:22] meeting or not tonight? Did you test
[1:48:24] your faith to see if you had enough
[1:48:26] faith to to eat your supper tonight?
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; Have you test Do you think you have to
[1:48:31] fast a while and test your faith to see
[1:48:33] if you got enough faith to drive your
[1:48:35] car home? It don't make sense,
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; It's not I mean, you know, you get out
[1:48:41] there like like like brother Jean told
[1:48:43] us on last week say if you if you
[1:48:45] believe in God, Amen. If you you know,
[1:48:48] you going through something, well,
[1:48:49] pastor, the reason I can't come to
[1:48:50] church is because I ain't have no gas
[1:48:51] money. He said that should never be a
[1:48:53] Christian's excuse.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; He said, "But it happens." He said, "But
[1:48:57] it should never be excuse. I ain't got
[1:48:58] no gas money." He said, "And now when
[1:48:59] you do get gas money, believe God for
[1:49:02] the full thing."
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; Not just enough gas. Lord, give me
[1:49:04] enough gas to get to church.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; No, you got to go home from church and
[1:49:10] you got to go to work next week. Believe
[1:49:12] God for the whole thing.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; Stop limiting God.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; God, I need overflow.
[1:49:22] Truth, brother.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; I'm going tell you, God going to give
[1:49:26] you what you ask for.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm about to say some things. I'm
[1:49:30] about to say
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; God God going to give you what you ask
[1:49:33] for. you. I I I I I I I I was studying
[1:49:38] and I have a couple different Bibles
[1:49:40] that I that I use and I pulled out this
[1:49:42] old Bible that I had and um and inside
[1:49:46] this Bible, I had a a check pinned to a
[1:49:51] scripture.
[1:49:52] You know, somebody had wrote me a check
[1:49:54] and they wrote me a check for $40,000.
[1:49:58] And so I took the check and I pinned it
[1:50:00] on the scripture. And when I saw it last
[1:50:03] night, I said, "Lord,
[1:50:05] I'mma cash this check from this family
[1:50:08] for $40,000.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; God going to somehow bless this family
[1:50:13] that this check going to be cash."
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; Now, how God do that, that ain't up to
[1:50:20] me.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; But I'mma just speak it. This check
[1:50:23] going to be cash.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Right. So I I I I begin to
[1:50:30] speak life over that family
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; that could do that because God gonna
[1:50:34] have to bless them so they can fulfill
[1:50:36] that
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; because God don't write blank checks
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; and God checks don't bounce.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; Hello somebody. Not not the checks that
[1:50:48] God provide. They don't bounce.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; So
[1:50:55] we have to have unconscious faith.
[1:50:58] the situations arise. Amen. Let us let's
[1:51:00] let let us let us operate and act as who
[1:51:03] we are as sons and daughters of God.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; And he was talking about testing your
[1:51:09] faith. Y'all, when you all come in,
[1:51:12] Amen. This this morning, nobody tested
[1:51:15] the chair
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; to see whether they could sit in it.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; Nobody. Nobody.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; Is this thing going to be all right?
[1:51:24] Everybody just plop right down in the
[1:51:26] chair.
[1:51:28] I mean just just sat down and and had it
[1:51:31] had it not held you
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; then that's when you would have had some
[1:51:35] questions
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; but what you actually operated in when
[1:51:38] you sat in your chair you operated in
[1:51:40] unconscious faith
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; when you go get in your car and and and
[1:51:44] and crank it. Some of us got the old
[1:51:46] crank system. My my truck got the old
[1:51:48] crank system. Some of y'all got the
[1:51:49] little push button. Hallelujah. Some of
[1:51:52] y'all can talk to your car and some of
[1:51:54] y'all started with a app on your phone
[1:51:56] and all kind of stuff no matter what.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; But you know whatever button you pushing
[1:52:01] and whatever thing you turning your
[1:52:03] expectations that when I get there it's
[1:52:05] going to work.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; That's what we call unconscious faith.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; What am I saying? When I get into a
[1:52:13] trial, when I get into a situation, when
[1:52:15] I get into a circumstance, my faith says
[1:52:18] God is going to work it out.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:22] unconsciously.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; And that's I ain't got to stay home from
[1:52:26] church because I'm going through
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; that's when I go to church.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; All right, let me
[1:52:39] let me move on.
[1:52:41] Oh, let me let me keep reading this. Let
[1:52:43] me keep reading this. He says, um,
[1:52:47] "Do you think you have to fast a while
[1:52:49] and test your faith to see if you got
[1:52:51] enough faith to drive your car home?"
[1:52:53] Certainly not. It's just automatically
[1:52:55] you believe it. And there's that's the
[1:52:58] way you believe healing. Believe
[1:53:00] anything God said. Just don't fight at
[1:53:02] it and shake at it and rebuke the devil
[1:53:06] every minute.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; Boy, ain't that something? That That's
[1:53:11] me. Satan, I rebuke you in the name of
[1:53:13] J. Stop wasting your time talking to the
[1:53:15] devil
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; and start giving God praise in the midst
[1:53:21] of it.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; God, I thank you. I I I I had somebody
[1:53:25] text me and say, "You know what? We made
[1:53:26] a decision to go into another
[1:53:27] direction." Say, "Oh Lord, Father, I
[1:53:30] thank you for all the hours that you've
[1:53:32] given me. These people may not be a part
[1:53:34] of those hours that you want me to have
[1:53:36] in the future." So rather than start
[1:53:38] complaining, I start thanking God for
[1:53:40] what he's getting ready to do.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, every time you lose one,
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; we heard brother brother Jose testify
[1:53:51] that when he lost one customer, then God
[1:53:54] blessed him with many more. If God did
[1:53:56] that for him,
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; what he want to do for you?
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, get get ready for your blessing.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; But I'mma tell you something. You got to
[1:54:05] stay in the boat. Amen.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; Cuz miracles happen inside the boat.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; All right, let me finish reading this.
[1:54:12] He says, he says, "That's that's the way
[1:54:14] uh you believe. Believe anything upset.
[1:54:16] Just don't fight at it. Shake at it.
[1:54:17] Rebuke the devil every minute. You just
[1:54:18] accept it and go on. That's it. There's
[1:54:20] nothing to be alarmed about. God said
[1:54:23] so." And and and that settled it. So, we
[1:54:25] just go ahead. Nothing is knowing is
[1:54:28] going to happen. It says just forget
[1:54:31] about it. God said it. That proves it. I
[1:54:34] believe it. That settles it. That's all
[1:54:36] you have to do.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; He goes on. It says Jesus laying in the
[1:54:42] back of the boat and he was asleep and
[1:54:44] he raised up and still the waters. Now
[1:54:46] look, he's crossing that stormy sea and
[1:54:48] when he gets over to the other side, he
[1:54:50] come all the way across that stormy sea
[1:54:52] through that dark, dark, dismal, rainy,
[1:54:56] stormy night when perhaps 10,000 devils
[1:54:58] of the sea swore they'd drown him. And
[1:55:01] there he was out there in that little
[1:55:03] old boat bouncing around like that.
[1:55:06] Through the night, tired and weary, he
[1:55:08] come all the way over to Gdara for one
[1:55:10] purpose. There was one person needed
[1:55:14] help. That was a maniac of Gera, a crazy
[1:55:18] man. He come all the way across the
[1:55:19] stormy sea. It took him all night to
[1:55:23] help one person.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; Listen to this. He come all the way from
[1:55:31] glory tonight to manifest himself to
[1:55:35] heal any person that's in here. That's
[1:55:38] the loving heart of the Lord Jesus. If
[1:55:41] you have a need, he'll cross stormy seas
[1:55:43] because he's the pilot
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; of this ship. He'll cross the stormy
[1:55:47] seas just to get to you,
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; just to get to your need.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; That's our God.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:54] There was another
[1:55:56] passage and I want to just read this and
[1:55:59] then um maybe a couple other things that
[1:56:02] I want to I want to share. Um
[1:56:06] let me skip here. Uh Acts 23 and 111.
[1:56:10] Let's just read that really quick. Acts
[1:56:12] 23 and 111.
[1:56:23] And I want to slip back to something if
[1:56:24] I can. Acts 23:11.
[1:56:31] The Bible says,
[1:56:33] "And the night following
[1:56:36] the Lord stood by him and said, "Be of
[1:56:39] good cheer, Paul, for as thou hast
[1:56:42] testified of me in Jerusalem, so must
[1:56:44] thou bear witness also at Rome."
[1:56:48] Now when we look at this
[1:56:52] um God gives Paul a promise here in Acts
[1:56:55] 23
[1:56:57] and visits him uh supernaturally and
[1:56:59] tells him this thing that you know
[1:57:01] you're going to bear witness of me at
[1:57:02] Rome. But what God didn't do is tell
[1:57:07] Paul everything he was going to have to
[1:57:09] go through
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; before he got to Rome.
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; So this is what God does. Sometimes he
[1:57:14] gives you a promise, but he does not let
[1:57:16] you know all the things you have to go
[1:57:17] through before that promise is
[1:57:19] manifested in your life. But you have to
[1:57:21] be determined to hold to what God spoke
[1:57:23] to you.
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; When when when the trouble come, don't
[1:57:27] jump out the boat.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; Stay in the boat.
[1:57:31] One of the things happened in Acts 24,
[1:57:33] Paul was taken to uh uh Felix. Uh, and
[1:57:38] before he was taken to Felix, there was
[1:57:39] there was the Bible told us that there
[1:57:41] was a a bunch of Jews, several Jews had
[1:57:43] banded together and say they were going
[1:57:45] to kill Paul. They were going to kill
[1:57:46] him. Now, I don't care what they banding
[1:57:48] together to do. If God say you're going
[1:57:50] to Rome, they can't kill you until after
[1:57:52] you get to Rome.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; So, so if you're not in Rome and they
[1:57:56] threaten to kill you, nuh-uh. When God
[1:57:57] say you going to Rome, you going to
[1:57:59] Rome. Forget about what everybody else
[1:58:00] is saying.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; Right? So, here here Paul is told this
[1:58:04] and and and this these Jews band
[1:58:05] together, man, we're going to kill this
[1:58:07] man. And they doing they coming up with
[1:58:08] all kind of schemes to try to kill Paul.
[1:58:10] Acts 24, he was taken to Felix who who
[1:58:13] prolonged his judgment. The man was
[1:58:15] supposed to be judged. But Felix
[1:58:17] prolonged Paul's judgment for two years.
[1:58:20] Two years he stuck there. Amen. But
[1:58:22] again, Paul ain't in Rome. So I don't
[1:58:24] care how long he stay is going. He got
[1:58:26] just like he had he said just like you
[1:58:28] you bore witness of me here in
[1:58:29] Jerusalem. And I don't care how long he
[1:58:30] get kept in Jerusalem. He's got to get
[1:58:32] to Rome somehow
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; cuz the Lord told him he's going. He
[1:58:36] kept him there for two years hoping that
[1:58:37] Paul would try to give him money to buy
[1:58:39] his freedom. In Acts 25, uh Paul stood
[1:58:42] before Fesus who had replaced Felix and
[1:58:45] he had he appealed to stand before
[1:58:46] Caesar because his the prophecy said
[1:58:49] that he was to bear witness also in
[1:58:51] Rome. Listen, he stood before King of
[1:58:54] King of Gri and began to give his
[1:58:55] personal testimony of his conversion.
[1:58:58] And uh and and I like this because when
[1:59:00] Paul stood before Grippa, he never did
[1:59:02] expound upon mysteries of the scripture.
[1:59:05] What he did was just begin to tell amen
[1:59:07] a gripper how he became a Christian. And
[1:59:11] sometimes that's all we need to do is
[1:59:12] share with people our personal testimony
[1:59:14] how we became a Christian. You ain't got
[1:59:16] to tell them about the message just yet.
[1:59:18] Tell them how you became a Christian.
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; The Bible says he almost persuaded a
[1:59:24] gripper to become a Christian in Acts 26
[1:59:27] and 28. But in Acts 27, we see something
[1:59:30] that happens here. Praise the Lord. In
[1:59:32] Acts 27, the Bible says that he set sail
[1:59:35] for Rome. But as they were on their way
[1:59:38] to Rome, this is years later after God
[1:59:42] has given them this promise. As they're
[1:59:43] on their way to Rome, they get caught in
[1:59:45] a storm. They're sailing on a boat.
[1:59:48] They're sailing on a ship. They get
[1:59:50] caught in a storm called Euroclaidon.
[1:59:53] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And Paul had
[1:59:56] already told these men, you know, in in
[1:59:58] Acts 27, he says, "I don't think we
[2:00:00] should be going out selling right now."
[2:00:02] He says, "Because uh, you know, I I feel
[2:00:04] like this is going to be a very
[2:00:05] dangerous time, and we shouldn't we
[2:00:07] shouldn't set sail." But but somehow the
[2:00:09] captain of the ship told him, "No, he
[2:00:11] told he told he told the uh the the
[2:00:12] centurion that was watching over." He
[2:00:14] said, "No, we need to go ahead and set
[2:00:15] sail. We need to do it right now." Well,
[2:00:17] the centurion I mean the the the captain
[2:00:19] I mean the centurion believe the captain
[2:00:20] rather than believe in Paul. Hallelujah.
[2:00:23] Now what happens here is that they get
[2:00:24] out there and they get they went out in
[2:00:26] smooth sailing seas and before you know
[2:00:28] it a storm was on them
[2:00:31] and the storm got so bad
[2:00:36] they had to take all the stuff out the
[2:00:38] ship and try to get it light stuck out
[2:00:41] there for 14 days.
[2:00:44] But Paul, while he was in that
[2:00:46] condition, the angel Lord came and told
[2:00:47] him, he says, "You know what?
[2:00:51] Um, everybody that's on this boat going
[2:00:55] to be spared
[2:00:57] because of you."
[2:01:00] He said, "I'm giving you everybody on
[2:01:01] this boat." So, so what happened to some
[2:01:03] of the some of the some of the people,
[2:01:05] he said, but but here's the thing. In
[2:01:06] order to be spared, oh my.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; In order to be spared, they had to be
[2:01:14] willing to stay in the boat.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; And and and what happened was that, you
[2:01:20] know, as they were lightening the ship,
[2:01:22] they saw some they had some other little
[2:01:23] life rafts and they said, "We going to
[2:01:25] jump off and get in the life raft." He
[2:01:26] said, "No, no, no, no. What he told me
[2:01:28] is that if you want to be spared, you
[2:01:29] got to stay in the boat." So So the
[2:01:31] centurion say, "Well, cut the life rafts
[2:01:32] away." Oh my god. every here they're all
[2:01:35] they're the the safety is gone
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; and all them just watching to go say no
[2:01:40] no no I'm telling you I had told y'all
[2:01:42] that we weren't supposed to come out
[2:01:44] here now I'm telling you now that if you
[2:01:47] want salvation
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; if you want protection
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; if you want your life amen to to be
[2:01:54] spared you better stay inside this boat
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; Paul got them all stay in the boat and
[2:02:02] he began to encourage them and try to
[2:02:03] get them to eat something. All this
[2:02:04] said, "Don't worry. God said we" And
[2:02:06] they didn't realize the reason that all
[2:02:08] this was happening because Paul was
[2:02:10] supposed to go to Rome. And since y'all
[2:02:12] just so happen to be with me,
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; y'all going to be spared.
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; Well, they got to a spot where they
[2:02:20] drove that ship into a little spot where
[2:02:24] it just caused the whole ship just to
[2:02:26] fall apart. And there was a some land
[2:02:28] ahead. And uh and and and Paul said,
[2:02:30] "Now tell tell the tell the the the the
[2:02:33] passengers and Amen. the prisoners, tell
[2:02:35] them that those that can swim,
[2:02:39] go ahead and swim up to to shore." And
[2:02:41] and then here's the thing. If you can
[2:02:43] swim, you you're not going to drown. I
[2:02:45] promise you that because God already
[2:02:46] told me everybody that was on this boat
[2:02:48] was going to make it. Now, if you can't
[2:02:51] swim, Paul gave them some instructions.
[2:02:53] He say, "Just grab a piece of
[2:02:57] a piece of the boat.
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; Anything you see floating by.
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; Just grab a piece of that
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; and just begin to move on up towards the
[2:03:06] shore with your broken piece.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; You know, brother brother Wesco first
[2:03:10] sermon that he ever preached.
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; He went to the pull pit. He said, "You
[2:03:14] can make it on broken pieces."
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; And I'm here to tell you, you can still
[2:03:19] make it on broken pieces. I don't care
[2:03:21] what is going on in your life. You can
[2:03:24] still make it on broken pieces.
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; Amen,
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; man. They got themselves up there to
[2:03:30] that shore and every last one of them
[2:03:33] was accounted for. God had spared all of
[2:03:36] them because Paul was on his way to
[2:03:38] Rome. But you know what? Even though
[2:03:39] they got to safety,
[2:03:42] Paul was still going through trials. out
[2:03:44] of all the people on the on the island.
[2:03:49] Paul is there with a fire and just
[2:03:52] trying to get warm. I'm wet and I'm just
[2:03:54] trying to get warmed and all this and
[2:03:56] all of a sudden while he's sticking a a
[2:03:58] a maybe sticking a a stick or something
[2:04:01] towards the fire, a snake comes out and
[2:04:03] bites him.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; But you know why Paul could just
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; Do you want to know why he could do
[2:04:10] that?
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; He wasn't in wrong.
[2:04:15] Amen.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; He was in Rome yet.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, when God has given
[2:04:20] you a promise,
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; you can shake off some of the things
[2:04:24] that the devil is trying to attack you
[2:04:26] with because you're not where God told
[2:04:28] you that you would be.
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; I wrote this. You're still in the
[2:04:36] perfect will of God even when you are
[2:04:39] enduring
[2:04:41] your role.
[2:04:44] All you got to do is just be patient.
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; Wait on God. He's going to bring you
[2:04:49] through.
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; I want to go back to the first quote
[2:04:53] that I read
[2:04:55] and I'll bring this to a close.
[2:05:00] Why Christ speak?
[2:05:02] It says, "Now today we're expecting
[2:05:05] a great time in the Lord." And I had two
[2:05:07] or three different texts here that I was
[2:05:09] looking at and I didn't I couldn't
[2:05:11] figure out just which one I would talk
[2:05:14] on this morning. One of them was Cashia
[2:05:16] cares on him for he cares for you
[2:05:21] and if he cares why not you.
[2:05:25] So then another one Billy Paul says my
[2:05:28] other son Joseph brought me this text a
[2:05:30] long time ago. He was sitting in the
[2:05:33] room one day and he said looking up
[2:05:35] towards the picture,
[2:05:37] Joseph is very fond of boats like little
[2:05:40] boys, boats and horses, you know, and he
[2:05:42] said to me, "Daddy, has Jesus got a
[2:05:45] boat?"
[2:05:48] So then after he got up and went out, I
[2:05:50] happened to think, "Has he got a boat?"
[2:05:54] And I took a text from that, just marked
[2:05:56] it down here on my book. Has Jesus got a
[2:05:59] boat?
[2:06:02] I happen to think while when he was on
[2:06:03] earth, he had to borrow a womb to be
[2:06:06] born in,
[2:06:08] a grave to be buried in, a boat to
[2:06:12] preach from, but he is
[2:06:16] the pilot
[2:06:18] of the old ship of Zion.
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; You know, I read that some time ago or
[2:06:26] heard that on the tape listening to why
[2:06:28] Christ speaking. kind of inspired me and
[2:06:30] I while I was in prayer a few years ago
[2:06:33] in church this whole sermon of miracles
[2:06:36] happened in the boat came to me while I
[2:06:37] was in prayer but just didn't get a
[2:06:39] chance to preach it until now but as I
[2:06:43] was looking amen at these notes again
[2:06:46] last night and I underlined under had
[2:06:49] took an underline to that part he's the
[2:06:51] pilot of the old ship of Zion and um I
[2:06:55] was just trying to figure out where
[2:06:57] where did this term come from
[2:07:01] this old ship
[2:07:04] of Zion? And there are a number of
[2:07:06] songwriters out there that have written
[2:07:08] songs about the the old ship of Zion.
[2:07:11] But uh from my understanding, Amen. It
[2:07:14] was this old ship of Zion was birthed
[2:07:17] from
[2:07:19] um the slaves
[2:07:21] coming across, Amen. the Atlantic Ocean,
[2:07:25] the come from Africa to become slaves
[2:07:27] here in in the US. And not just the US,
[2:07:30] but you know, we know that there's a
[2:07:32] triangle. Amen. And slaves ended up in
[2:07:35] some of the uh some of the islands, you
[2:07:38] know. I mean, we we we we they all over
[2:07:40] these all over the islands. So, it's not
[2:07:42] just the US that that was involved in in
[2:07:44] the slave trade, but it was many of the
[2:07:45] islands that also, you know, that got
[2:07:48] impacted by this, you know. But but here
[2:07:50] you know um the what would happen is
[2:07:53] that the somehow they said the some of
[2:07:56] the the slaves came up with this song uh
[2:08:00] t the old ship of Zion.
[2:08:03] They say t the old ship of Zion.
[2:08:07] T the old ship of Zion. Get on board.
[2:08:12] Get on board.
[2:08:14] And they asked a question in in in the
[2:08:16] verse of the song because see they
[2:08:18] didn't have they didn't have um the way
[2:08:20] we write verses and things like that.
[2:08:21] The songs they just had they just had
[2:08:23] just a few words that they put together
[2:08:24] and uh and that was the whole song.
[2:08:27] Right. T the old ship of Zion.
[2:08:31] T the old ship of Zion.
[2:08:35] T the old ship of Zion.
[2:08:38] Get on board.
[2:08:41] Get on board.
[2:08:44] Do you think she will be able? They're
[2:08:47] saying, "Do you think the B the boat
[2:08:49] going to make it? Do you think she will
[2:08:51] be able?
[2:08:53] Do you think she will be able? Get on
[2:08:57] board.
[2:08:59] Get on board." They encouraging. It's
[2:09:01] going to make it. This boat gonna make
[2:09:03] it.
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; And they say it has landed many
[2:09:08] thousands.
[2:09:10] It had landed many a thousand. It has
[2:09:13] landed many a thousand.
[2:09:16] So get on board.
[2:09:19] Get on board.
[2:09:23] And what they're saying is that not only
[2:09:25] did they make it to their destination,
[2:09:26] but one day this ship of Zion going to
[2:09:28] take us to heaven.
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; But in order to get to heaven, we going
[2:09:31] to have to stay in the boat.
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:37] Ain't no danger in the water.
[2:09:41] &gt;&gt; They say ain't no danger in the water.
[2:09:44] Ain't no danger in the waters. Get on
[2:09:47] board.
[2:09:49] Get on board.
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; Then they had this one verse said, "King
[2:09:53] Jesus
[2:09:55] is the captain."
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; King Jesus is the captain. King Jesus is
[2:10:03] the captain. So get on board. Lord,
[2:10:08] get
[2:10:09] on board.
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; he's the pilot
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; of the old ship of Zion.
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; And as long as Jesus is controlling
[2:10:21] where we're going,
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; we ain't got nothing to worry about.
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; Church, don't get at it.
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; Get in the boat because miracles happen.
[2:10:35] in the boat.
[2:10:38] &gt;&gt; God bless your church.
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; Let the musicians come. Let us have a
[2:10:50] word of prayer.
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; Father,
[2:10:56] we're grateful for your word.
[2:11:00] We're grateful for your strength that
[2:11:02] comes to us through the word.
[2:11:04] to encourage us, to help us,
[2:11:08] Father. No matter what it is that we're
[2:11:09] going through, we can
[2:11:12] we can rest because we know that you
[2:11:14] have everything under control.
[2:11:19] As believers, sometimes don't let the
[2:11:21] storms of life get us to a spot where
[2:11:24] we're thinking, "Oh, we got to jump off.
[2:11:26] We got to get out. We don't know if this
[2:11:28] thing is going down or not." But help us
[2:11:30] to trust, God.
[2:11:33] You you have everything under control.
[2:11:36] Everything, Lord. You You have already
[2:11:39] navigated this storm. You knew it was
[2:11:43] coming. You also know that we're going
[2:11:45] to make it through. So Lord, help us to
[2:11:48] trust you. You're the pilot. You're the
[2:11:51] captain
[2:11:55] and you're responsible for all of us, oh
[2:11:58] God. So Father, I just pray that Amen.
[2:12:01] and we would take courage in the word
[2:12:03] and that we would begin to operate in
[2:12:05] unconscious faith
[2:12:08] knowing that what you have spoken it
[2:12:10] shall come to pass.
[2:12:13] Every promise that you've given is yes
[2:12:15] and amen and not one word you spoke will
[2:12:18] fall to the ground and return void.
[2:12:21] Father, we're careful to give you all
[2:12:23] the praise even in the midst of
[2:12:25] everything we're going through. As David
[2:12:26] said, I will bless the Lord at all
[2:12:28] times. His praise shall continually be
[2:12:31] in my mouth.
[2:12:33] That's We're not going to sit here and
[2:12:35] rebuke the devil all the time. We're
[2:12:38] just going to give you praise because we
[2:12:39] know you got everything
[2:12:42] under control. Songwriter say, "You got
[2:12:44] the whole world in your hands.

[2:12:48] hands. You got me and you, brother, in
