here ministering uh for the church amen and I know the church will be blessed amen how we again we thank God for that um so this morning before I would um go into the word amen I want to do something this morning that has never been done at Spirit and Truth Tabernacle amen but um I pray that today will be the first of many days uh where this will happen uh at Spirit and Truth Tabernacle um we were I I want to say it was a the combined service that we did in um uh December we were there at um at Rapture and Faith Tabernacle we did the combined service and and brother Mike uh asked you know for all the ministers in the congregation to stand and uh you know so all the ministers stood and uh and during that time uh brother Jerry stood brother Troy stood and um and you know and and brother Mike just acknowledged you know the ministers that were that were present and it just kind of struck me at that time uh that we had never uh forly ordained our ministers amen and so uh today I want to formally ordain our ministers praise God um we thank God for these brother others that have been a tremendous help uh to Spirit and Truth Tabernacle and uh you know I I I just go back to just my early days and things like that um you know I was ordained actually in Georgia by brother uh Larry Brown and um and I just remember you know just um um even you know that time of my life where I was kind of uh trying to find the will of the Lord for for me I just I I didn't I just didn't know what direction I was headed in I I was I was quite confused quite confused but um you know I thank God that the Lord just had different ones that were in my life at that time to kind of help me you know through that phase of my journey and uh and when I look back uh over uh the the step of faith that we took way back then uh to see where God has brought us to now uh all I can say is I am grateful amen I am truly truly grateful amen uh God I believe has proven himself um in more ways than one uh in all of our lives uh God has proven that this has been a church that he has established amen this is not the work of a man but this is the work of almighty God and and we're we're we're just want to give him glory and honor amen and what he's doing so uh years ago I would have never known that I would be here today uh ordaining these brothers we have four brothers in our church that uh Minister for us on a regular basis but never officially been ordained so today uh we want to uh take time to do that amen so I want to read a couple scriptures and uh I'm going to have um uh our brothers just kind of come maybe uh do me a favor and um just just give me one chair and just put it right on that end there just one chair there you go there you go perfect just put it on the end and I'mma ask um brother uh brother Troy brother Jerry brother Mark and brother Quinton if they would come and take these first uh four chairs here on this side brother Troy brother Mark brother Jerry and brother Quinton Jr amen I have a few scriptures that I want to read amen uh today praise God amen amen um 1 Timothy 4 um is the the first um scripture that I'll read amen 1 Timothy 4 um and I want to start here at verse uh [Music] 14 first Timothy 4 verse 14 scripture says uh um neglect not the gift that is in thee which was given thee by Prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the Pres uh presbyter um meditate upon these things give thyself holy to them that thy profiting may appear to all take heed unto thyself and unto the doctrine continue in them for in doing this Thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee and when I think about what Paul wrote there as far as uh take heed unto thyself and unto the doctrine um brother Brandon when he did um ordination there was um he did this once before and and um as he was ordaining these brothers uh there were some people that start walking up some other brothers start walking up and and uh saying hey I never been ordained I want to be ordained too I want to be ordained too so brother random made it very clear he says now um we are we are ordaining people to preach this message that we believe amen and he says now you know uh because you can go anywhere and get ordained you can go to the Internet and get get get get ordination certificates but but we talk about the doctrine it's this message that we believe and we we believe God is calling ministers to help amen spread this word uh to the Nations amen so Brothers as we are uh uh approaching this this ordination is that we would stay true to this message that God has given us amen Stay True to this word that God has given us another scripture amen that I want to read um for you praise God is coming out of the book of um Jeremiah amen this is going to be Jeremiah verse 20 amen Jeremiah verse 20 and uh verse 9 I pray God would just continue to uh flood you Brothers with inspiration and that uh his word would be as it was to Jeremiah amen and your souls Jeremiah 20 and verse 9 it says uh then I said I will not make mention of him nor speak anymore in his name now Jeremiah was going through a number of Trials uh uh difficulties in his life and um and and and I want to help help I want our brothers understand it's it's not going to be easy um you know you're going to have to go through some things but in the midst of going through I was telling you when I went up there to um Georgia and I got my ordination um I think the time I went my wife and I we got all the way to the exit uh one of our trips up to Georgia we got a flat tire next trip we got all the way to the exit and realized we left our clothes back home in Florida and uh had to immediately go to the store and find something I'm like Lord what why would I come all the way out here and I'm thinking why I why I got these trials but you know these trials are just there to make us strong all right and uh and just because you go through a trial don't mean God is not with you amen it does not mean God is not with you brother random say the Cloudy Skies amen and the um the storms of life that don't mean that God is not with us neither do clear skies mean that God is with us you know the reason we know he's with us because he told us that he'll never leave us nor forsake us but here Jeremiah says then I said I will not make mention of him nor speak anymore in his name but his word was in my heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones and I was weary with forbearing and I could not stay so Jeremiah got to a spot where he just could not help but preach the gospel and I trust that that'll be your experience my brothers that God would just put that in your heart it'll be like fire shut up in your bones let me give you amen uh Proverbs 18- 16 this is one of my favorite and um and I want to say this uh over each of these brothers brother brandom you know told us that um when it comes to Ministry uh one of the big things is that you have to watch your motive and your objective uh what's the purpose why why are you doing it and uh for the time that um all of these brothers have been here ministering um their motive and objective has been very pure it's been very clean they have not done this for any other reason but to try to further the gospel uh they not it's not a popularity contest uh it is it is it is you know not trying to force themselves goes into pull pits they they don't do that they haven't done that not one of these brothers have ever called me and said brother Jack I got something to say so when you're going to let me say it none of that happens with these brothers uh they wait for their opportunity when God opens up the door they step right in and they do what they're supposed to do right and uh and and one of the things that I that I that I love about is that um um it it's it's according to the scripture and Proverbs 18 uh and 16 tells us this a man's gift maketh room for him glory to God and bringeth him before great men and uh and even with uh us having seven ministers in this church uh each one waits for their opportunity and you know while they waiting the amen and the other brother that's going forth I appreciate these these brothers I I really really appreciate these brothers [Music] Glory you sometimes you go to churches and people just fighting to try to get into the pull pit I got something to say no no no no often when you when you pushing to get in you ain't got nothing to say Amen when you doing that you really ain't got nothing to say but you just waiting on the Lord that's when we want to hear from you praise God um you know I I'm going to share this well let me I want let me just share this other scripture and I I'll share something else else later but the last scripture I want to read is out of Mark uh 15 amen Mark [Music] chapter just make sure it might be Mark 16 Mark 16 um Jesus gives us these instructions and I just want to read the words of Our Lord over our brothers Mark um 16 and verse 15 Jesus says and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover this is Jesus uh commission uh to all of us amen and uh I pray brothers that the Lord will open up doors for you to go in and preach the gospel in all the world may it go forth from Spirit and Truth Tabernacle West Palm Beach Florida amen I want to ask brother Smiley and uh brother quu if they would just join me here in the front uh we will um pray over each brother amen in their Ministries and um and I do have um something I just want to just give to each one and this just a little certificate that you'll be able to keep but it just says um certificate ordination um certifies that the said brother has been set apart and called to the ministry of the Gospel on the second day of March in the year 2025 at Spirit and Truth Tabernacle West Palm Beach Florida it says and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature uh Mark 16:15 and uh we have it signed amen and um just with our logo and everything on it uh my wife helped me get all this together so I thank God for her amen um well we go in alphabetical order brother Troy would be first Amen to be ordained Amen on today brother Smiley and brother quu would you all come uh and join me uh here brother Troy just come and stand here uh By Me praise the Lord just stand on my right side right here on my right side and you face the audience amen uh I want to I was just going to mention earlier that um when I say a man's gift make room for himself um brother Troy has been invited to minister uh Easter services at a church in Indiana um praise the Lord he didn't go knocking on doors but they came to him and he's got two services that he has to preach there so first time ever that he's doing it you all please pray for him um this is New [Music] Territory but he has been a blessing to Spirit and Truth Tabernacle and uh and I'm excited to see what this next season of life looks like amen for him so uh we know the scripture tells us to uh offer our brother the right hand of Fellowship so I have him standing on my right side because I want you to stretch your right hand uh towards brother Troy he's been a blessing to this church and we identify that there is a gift in his life amen and we want to lay hands on him and pray for him Brothers if you would lay hands on our brother church if you stretch your right hand this way father we come in the name of Jesus on this day we thank you for brother Troy God you have used him in a very special way he is a deacon of our church but God as a deacon he also has accepted uh the responsibility of being apt to teach and being apt to teach Lord you have proven yourself Lord uh in his life we have heard you speak through his lips to our hearts so God we ask that you would go with him that you would go before him that you would bless him this opportunity has to bring the gospel father there to Indiana we don't know where else you will take them but we are committed to praying for our brother Lord and being there with him we lay our hands on him father uh to ordain him into the ministry father and just knowing father that you have called him for the for such a time

Quinton has been going forth and and um with all these Brothers um brother random say sometimes um a minister uh fights knowing whether he's been called and not been called so the devil always PR play tricks and he'll tell the one that has been called that he's not been called and then he tell the one that had that that that he think he been called that you know the one that's really not called but he think he been called right so it's always tricks like that that you got to kind of fight through and the way that you uh kind of navigate that is when you put them behind the secret desk you watch and see what comes out and a lot has come out of our precious brother a lot a lot lot has come out um so much so that we can stretch our right hands towards this brother amen and we can lay hands on him to ordain him amen officially father we come in the name of Jesus Lord on behalf of our brother Quenton Lord Jesus a young man that was sent to us um some years ago and God just just remains

God for all things thank God for all things and y'all keep me in prayer because it's when you're dealing with uh a number of ministers you you want to make sure that they all get the opportunity uh to speak so that their their gifts are cultivated amen and um and and in order to do that I got to share the pull pit I can't I can't hog it praise God Amen I have to share the pull pit and and we and it's one thing when I have guest ministers coming in but you know I can't neglect the ones that we got right here in our midst so pray that God would give me wisdom on how to just help you know each brother cultivate that they would be used for the glory of God Amen that is that is that is very very important so we thank God Amen I will uh read a a scripture here today and and uh we will just um continue our journey if you don't mind standing with me uh we'll turn to the Book of Revelation uh chapter uh 14 I believe amen Revelation 14 [Music] I don't know why the words in my Bible seem to get smaller something's changing here and I and I'm I'm trying I'm trying to adapt to it um but um Revel 14 and uh verse 6 I'll get started in the start and I'll see how far I can go today um but we we trust the Lord just to help us uh Revelation 14:6 says and I saw another angel fly in the midst of Heaven having the Everlasting gospel to preaching un to them that dwell on the earth and to Every Nation and Kindred and tongue and people Sayang with a loud voice fear God and give glory to him for the hour of his judgment has come and worship him that made Heaven and Earth and the Sea and The Fountains of waters and there followed another Angel saying Babylon is Fallen is Fallen that great City because she made all nations drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication uh and the third Angel followed them saying with a loud voice if any man worship the Beast and His Image and receive his Mark in his forehead or in his hand the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation and shall be tormented with fire and Bre Brimstone uh in the presence of the Holy Angels uh and in the presence of the lamb and the smoke of their torment ascended up forever and ever and they have no rest day uh nor night who worship the beast in His image and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name here is the patience of the Saints here are they that keep the Commandments of God in the faith of Jesus Jesus Amen Let Us bow in a brief word of prayer father we are grateful for this opportunity we have Lord to read the word but we know it takes the Holy Ghost to uh help us understand what it is that we have read so we trust father that the spirit of the Lord would come now and anoint us father uh not only the the the the speaking but also anoint the hearing uh of the word make it clear to us God uh and Trust Lord Jesus that uh you would just get the glory and the honor we take every Spirit that's against the spirit of God underneath the control of the Holy Ghost even right now in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you uh you can be seated um we continue our journey amen through the uh sermon the series get back in Step uh and um [Music] there I think it's important to understand that um we are not the first group of people to walk the face of this Earth that needed to get back in Step amen um there has been others that have come uh on the scene and and uh and in one particular instance God used a prophet to try to bring the people back into step and um that instance was uh somehow the the children of Israel after all these tremendous uh victories that they had uh things that God had done uh for them and um opening up the Red Sea and the and the plagues in Egypt and you know they they saw the supernatural it was so common Amen to the children of Israel and some of the things that happened to to this group of people when we read it in scripture uh it brings inspiration to us I I for me I'll say it brings inspiration to me when I'm facing amen a a great trial my mind always goes back to God you open up a Red Sea right I mean I I start I start talking like that you open up a Red Sea you you shut the mouth of lions you took heat out of a fire I mean I mean I just go back to things that happen with the children of Israel and my faith get inspired right and uh so when we look back at children of Israel I mean somehow they got to a a a place where maybe they forgot about those things that God had done and uh and here in the Days of Elijah praise God the Prophet Elijah here Ahab is on the throne he has his wife Jezebel and and and they are in a they are in a backsliding condition amen underneath the leader of Ahab they're in a backsliding condition but uh Ahab has to come down amen uh God sends him out of out of hiding he comes into amen the uh into the nation and he says look we going to have to we going to have to get back in Step hallelujah amen we going we going to have to we going to have to uh uh uh set up a challenge here amen he say he say I'm tired of seeing people serving an idol God Amen I'm tired of uh uh I mean uh hearing about how baale is impacting the people especially with all that God has done for us amen I'm TI say we going to have to we going to have to set up some altars here and now he say say when you set up your altar and all these prophets of Bale let them call on bail and and the god that answers by fire let that God be the god of Israel and what what what what Elijah was doing was trying to bring the children of Israel back in step with the word of God we're not the first generation Amen to to need a sermon like this I also think of Amen what happened in the days of Joshua and and again here God not only you know uh uh here the children of Israel you know they they they saw what happened with their parents and now or their grandparents but now they're going into the the the promised land and and and when they get there they they see how God destroys the enemy right before the very eyes all the great things God was doing in the midst of the people but yet Joshua comes to a spot amen where he he has to uh uh uh put a choice before the people praise God I like this because amen that that when when Joshua brought them to this place amen we take these statements from Joshua and we hang them in our houses Hallelujah we hanging in our house and and and there Comes A Time that sometimes we have to we have to put our foot down with our children right and when we have to kind of let them know where we stand and and we have to tell them things like you can't do that in this house Hallelujah and and we go back we we fall back on the words of Joshua we say because because as for me in my house hallelujah amen we going to serve the Lord and when Joshua came up with that statement it because the children of Israel were getting out of step and Joshua made a statement to try to bring them back in Step we're not the first generation to have to go through these things so it's a very important amen series that we're in because the history just has a strange way of repeating itself as I said in the Days of Elijah God was using a prophet to bring the people back in line with his word and uh and what we've been doing here is just kind of walk through a a a series of of of of scriptures and amen I want to just uh uh uh fall back a little bit and and and um I'm I won't quote the full quote here from the exposition exposition of the seven Church ages but I want to just make it make uh reference to a couple things brother random said in her will be the fullness of Pentecost for the spirit will bring the people right back to where they were at the beginning and her that means us the bride he says that is thus sayth the Lord another statement that he makes amen God isn't going to plant a new church amen but is going to bring his original planting back to original seeds amen and I believe brother uh Caper saying the original life the original word right that's what we believe God has brought us back to that Original Seed and look God wasn't raising up a new church oh my amen God was restoring the church and in order to restore the church he had to pull us out of certain places oh Hallelujah we were in the denominational systems but God had to pull us out of that in order to start this restoration process hallelujah amen so he say he says God isn't going to plant a new church but it's going to bring its original planting back to Original Seed he is doing it as stated in verse 23 talk about Joel 2:23 but by the teaching or former reign next will come the Harvest rain of the Rapture and Faith now let me let me let me hone in on that just for a little bit God is doing the restoration by the teaching of former Reign so it's very important that we take time to lay certain things in we have to teach it because that's how God is doing the restoration now I want I mentioned this before this restoration is not just for us that's inside the four walls here but there are people listen on the line that have never heard these things before they don't realize that they have tapped into amen a prophecy that God was going to restore them and it's happening as they're listening to the word oh my my my my my the word is powerful y'all amen you know it's the word that created uh everything that we have the seat that you sitting in is created by the spoken word of God hallelujah so the the word the word the word brings things into existence so you know it's very important that we understand that that that restoration is happening right now glory to God he also says uh when he's talking about the denominational Church uh in this day he said that they will outshine the elect and effort and Zeal cuz sometimes you know people will look at us and say now brother y'all talk about y'all got all this but look at look at y'all look at where you at look at look at and and the problem is they don't understand that it's not a it's not buildings that bring the presence of God it's not buildings that do that oh my the prophet told us that amen it's the character of the people amen that is actually the beauty of the church it's not the building that's going to get it done but it's the character of the people that will get it done and the people's character has been formed and shaped by the word of God oh blessed be the name of the Lord we realize is more than the building we done been in buildings before and we've been miserable inside a building oh my I thank God for Freedom Church amen but but but but but we're not looking at buildings we're not looking at things like that I mean I you know I I I had the opportunity to kind of you know uh uh uh uh put all this to the side I I was offered I was offered to come on staff and be a pastor at a big church Hallelujah they they said we we we we want somebody like you and and I had a tell him say no no no no no no no no no um I mean it's like I I the only example I can say it's like a a woman you know God I mean here she been waiting to have this baby for a long time God finally give it a baby and then you're going to tell the lady to give the baby away no said no I can't do it like that I just have to just I'm no God ain't told me that and I don't care what the offer is God ain't told me that I'm going to stay right with what God gave me and here's the other thing I'm I'm going to let you I'm going you see something when Jesus came to Earth did he go to a king's Palace to be born no he went to some place very humble amen and let me tell you the place that you going to find Christ today in some humble place if they found if Shepherds found them in a humble place then you will find them in a humble place now because God hides and reveals himself in Simplicity glory to God so don't look at a building don't look at that you want to go beyond the building you want to hear what's being said in the [Applause] [Music] building so brother brandom tells us to they have Shine the the the the the elect and effort and Zeal but it is layer the see and out of Christ for it looks for big crowds big programs and Starling signs amongst them they preach the second coming of Christ but deny the Advent of the Prophet messenger this is the the point that I that I want to keep making here deny the Advent of the Prophet messenger though though in power and sence and true true Revelation he eclipses them all now brother brandham amen makes this statement about the Advent and what that means it's the arrival uh the arrival of a notable person amen a notable thing or event they deny the Advent I can I can tell you amen the scripture that I just read to you out of Revelation 14 is a past tense scripture now uh and I I'll get there in a second but I I'll tell you this I just I I when I pick up my Bible and you know sometime they have little notes and things like that in the Bible and uh and as I was reading you know the notes in my Bible it was saying Revelation 14 was something that's going to happen during the tribulation period amen and and as and if you were to take that studying your Bible if you were to take that that's what most people go preaching cuz actually most people when they pick up the Book of Revelation they don't they have no idea what it mean anyway so since they don't know what it mean they just kind of take what some learned man would say hallelujah glory to God now you have a choice amen you can take what a learned man has said amen a theologian you can take what a learned man has said or you can take what a prophet has said and and I'm one that firmly believes if prophets wrote the Bible they would take prophets to reveal the Bible Hallelujah so so I I'll tell you based on what a prophet tells us this scripture has already been fulfilled all right let me keep going so the Advent amen of this Prophet messenger I have been walking through a few scriptures with you all and uh we're continuing our journey uh here in Revelation the the we've talked about what brother bram's Ministry is all about he is the prop messenger that God sent on the scene and and and he's not coming glory to God just to say he's coming but he's coming because scripture said he was coming amen and if he does things according to scripture then we know we standing on the right foundation so so what are some of these scriptures that promised that brother brandom would be coming now now now now now now now now let me just also make it very clear cuz most people would go to their Bible and they would read say now I don't see his name in the Bible I don't see his name in the Bible so how y'all say that's him well let me just ask let me just help you understand you would not have saw the name of John the Baptist in the Old Testament now how would you know that was him you in the S named John the Baptist Glory I I can go a little further you won't even even see the name Jesus in the Old Testament so how do you know that's him come on now I can tell you that the way that you're going to find out that it's him God got to give you a revelation of who Jesus Is God got to give you a revelation of who John the Baptist is and the same God is able to give you a revelation of who William brandom is Oh Glory to God Amen it takes Revelation to understand these things so I I need you I need you to be able to go a little further with me when we look at it so when we're not looking for his physical name we're looking at his ministry hallelujah oh my here we found I I I I I've preached and I'm giving you some of the scriptures now about the Advent so here's one scripture that I've preached to you thus far Malachi 4 verse 5 and 6 and when I preach that also gave you the five comings of the spirit of Elijah that would come amen according to scripture and I and I keep using that term according to scripture according to scripture because I it's not what I think it's what the Bible says it's not what you think it's what the Bible says so Malachi 4: 5 and 6 I also gave you amen Revelation 3 and14 amen that was a scripture that we we ministered on Revelation 10 and 7 is another scripture that refers to this ministry coming amen uh I I also preached on St Luke 17 verse 26-30 that's another scripture amen that refers to brother brandom's Ministry amen and the time that this ministry would be on the earth these scriptures prophesy of it amen also I gave you Revelation 18 that was the last one that I gave you now I want to pick up on Revelation 18 I want to read that really quick and then we're going to go forward amen because uh the next scripture that we're we're dealing with today that speaks to brother brandom's Ministry is revelation 14 Hallelujah so I said Revelation 18 and now Revelation 14 look at all these past tense scriptures now watch this church Revelation 18 let's read verse 1-4 glory to God Amen and after these things I saw another Angel come down from Heaven having great power and the Earth was lightened with his glory amen and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the great is Fallen is fallen and has become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the Earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the Earth are are wax Rich through the abundance of her Del abundance of her delicacy it says and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins that you receive not of her plagues now now brother brandom clearly uh helps us understand that this this act pertains to his ministry where he's calling us out of denominational systems we heard the voice of God through his Prophet call us out of denominational systems amen come out of her my people you want to know why we Gathering a school because we heard a voice a voice called us to this little place right here Amen to hear the pure word of God Amen no more mix with this and mix with that no more men controlling things amen a bishop trying to control things no we we a got worry about that no more amen we got the word of God controlling us and we're going back to the original word what was written in scripture we're going back to that everything we believe we can show you in scripture the way that we dress we can show you in scripture why we don't have women preachers we can show you in scripture now now you know the church done got away from it amen the church done got way away from it I mean we not not a church calling women Bishops when now now have y'all read the Bible about what a bishop is anybody read their Bible and and and because it's in the King James they have to change and give us new well trying to give us new Bibles me I ain't taking none of the new Bibles I'm staying with my KJV but the but the Bible say a bishop must be husband of one wife so how's a woman going to be a [Music] bishop I mean just tell me how we get how did the church get so far off this is why God gives a sermon get back in Step In step with what in step with the word of God God going to judge us according to his word it's not be judg we're not going to be judged according to no denomination we're going to be judged according to his word and you know people in denomination systems they actually they can see the spirit is wrong they they actually they hate seeing division this church and can't Fellowship here and can't do this and can't do that and I mean they hate seeing that they want they want they want to see it togetherness glory to God but it's hard to bring it togetherness amen when we when we when we can't get together on the word how can two walk together except they be agreed all right all right so when we look at this scripture here Revelation 18 was saying a angel coming down from heaven and often time when we look at things like this the first thing we think about is like a being with with wings and and all of that coming down but you know we got to understand that according to scripture give me Galatians 4:14 according to scripture a man can be an angel and and and in Revelation 2 and 3 uh you'll see in and to the angel of the Church of Ephesus and to the angel of the Church of this and the angel of the Church of of Philadelphia the angel of the Church of saris the angel of the Church of pergamus VRA amen the angel of the Church of Leia right you'll see when when it's speaking of the Angel of the church it is not talking about a being coming down from from from from from heaven with wings now now now I will tell you it is a being coming from Heaven I'll tell you that far you you you do got that much right but it's not one with wings amen it's a man and and the reason I say it's a being coming from Heaven because actually we all we came from God and we going back to God so we come from heaven and we going back to heaven we just drop down for a span of time to to prove that this word is right oh my my my my but here here just just take this this scripture amen out of out of Galatians 4:14 this is Paul speaking and I and I I I've preached this before but sometimes it's good just to go back over it so to make sure that we get it it says and my Temptation which was in my flesh ye despise not so Paul had a problem with his eyes it says nor reject it but receive me as an angel of God even as Christ Jesus so here Paul say that people received him as an angel of God Amen and Paul was the messenger to the first church age he was the angel to the Church of Ephesus Revelation two all right I got to go forward so Revelation 18 tells us amen that an angel was coming down and he was going to have a his message was to call us out come out of her my people come out of that denominational system which was started by the Catholic church that's that that's the thing it's the Catholic church when you read Revelation 17 is it's the Catholic church that's identified but as I said this great had daughters harlots and who are the the harlots that the that the the gave birth to is the rest of the denominational churches now I I'mma just have to be honest with you it's the Baptist Church it's the Pentecostal church it's the Presbyterian Church it's the Episcopalian Church it's the Methodist Church any other of those denominations amen that got a denominational crown that they they they worshiping under that's what the that's what the the gave birth to praise God now let's go a little further I read this for you out of the first seal watch this watch this my God out of the first seal I read this it says um we've been warning him we got it to this nation it says uh notice he'll conquer the whole religious World he'll conquer make a covenant with Daniel's people now he's talking about the uh the pope and it's talking about the Catholic church now um and you all I know you all been keeping up with things we have a a pope that is eill amen and it's it's you know we don't know which way things are going to go but we do know something else that we had a prophet tell us that there could be a pope come up out of the United States and with the new leadership that we have uh we got to watch things that's all I can say argument in the white house probably the first time we had something well I I shouldn't say the first time because I know that uh kushev and and Eisenhower uh they got into it too I think kushev threw a shoe at Eisenhower praise God and and the prophet typed those things the prophet typed those things so when I mean I I I'm sorry I can't type all that but I know it's something significant about all these things praise God Amen I I believe the leader from Ukraine is of of of Jewish [Music] descent oo so we have to just watch a few things amen there's there there's a king of the north and brother random told us who that King of the North is Russia is the King of the North and and Russia will drop a a bomb on the Vatican that's what the prophet told us right so so we're watching all kind of stuff amen nothing nothing getting by us but uh but but you know I'm not so busy watching all that that I I also want to watch my life and make sure my life is right with God so I can be ready Amen to go when he cracks the sky let me read this amen uh first seal says uh now notice he'll conquer the whole religious World he'll conquer make a covenant with Daniel's people here it is both in the Gentile and in the Daniel people the Jews to the last week and we are and here we are even draw out on the boards and you see it perfectly there's where it is thank God there is that organization system is of the devil that's the that's that's denominational Church the organizational system is of the devil and that's no punches pulled on it either see it's exactly it's a root of the devil amen and now not people not people in there them are God's people when we speaking this we not speaking to the people we're not calling you the devil just like Jesus amen when he was uh on Earth and and and and and Peter come to him and and and rebuked him for some of the things he was saying Jesus told Satan Jesus said to Peter get thee behind me Satan now he wasn't calling Peter Satan he was just saying Satan is using you and you don't realize that that's a devil using you so I'm casting that devil lot of you amen we're not calling the people into Den denominational churches Devils why I was in the denominational Church glory to God you were there we weren't Devils we were Eagles in a in a chicken coup we just needed to hear the voice of the mother Eagle scream out and call us out of that condition and the mother eagle has scream come out of her my people we heard heard it and we came out that's why we here we heard something glory to God we heard the voice of God it's not brother Brandon's voice that we heard it was the voice of God coming from my background coming from my background brother Brandon's voice wouldn't have been able to get it done all right I'm just being honest from my background not just the man's voice see my background they sung their sermons that's right and when I played a tape I was listening hey when you going to wind this thing up was no wind ups was no organ playing in the background it was nobody yeah it was none of that and you you see you waitting oh you waiting on the show right but but but what we had to do is realize no this ain't no show this is a coming back to the word and when we come back to the word it you won't you won't see all that stuff going along with it oh hallelujah hallelujah but as we start listening to what he was saying like wait a minute wait a minute we ain't never heard things like this before in our life even even even in Sunday school they wouldn't teach Revelation and you go there to try to get into the deeper things of God hallelujah but I can come up come up here and take a scripture out of Revelation 14 and say this this has already been fulfilled and I'm going to prove it to you all right let me just keep going that organization systems of the devil that that's no punches pulled on it either it's exactly it's the root of the devil and now not people not people in there there them are God's people many of them but you know what when you get over here to uh to where we get in these trumpet sounding and the next time I come by these trumpet sounding you remember when the when them last angels that third Angel come across come out of her my people when that angel flies at the same time that message drops here for the last trumpet the last Angel's message not there's oh Lord there's there's a lot here you know oh Lord Jesus there are people still waiting for the trumpets to sound people in the message still waiting for the trumpets to sound but a prophet told us that all six trumpets sounded underneath the sick seal and it said they were all to the Jews and see so so here's the here's the here's the thing that we that that some of us missed some of us caught it but some of us missed it what God was doing was working a work in the Jews at the same time he was working a work in the Gentiles and there were certain things pertaining only to the Jews getting them ready for the seventh trumpet but the other six have already sounded when you go back and look at scripture brother random said that six trumpet sounded under ikan under Hitler that's what he told us that it sounded underneath those guys so if if if Hitler has already come and gone that is a past tense scripture Oh My My My but he says in between all this this is what he he says when that angel flies at the he says you remember when when them last angels that third Angel comes across come out of her my people that's that's Revelation 18:4 he says the third Angel comes across come out of her my people when that angel flies at the same time that message drops for her drops here for that last trumpet last Angel's message last seal open all happens at the same time last trumpet last seal open last Angel's message everything happening simultaneously all right he says yes sir seals up goes over into eternity now let's pick up this now he and I just like how he say third Angel okay because when we read Revelation 14 it talked about Three Angels the first Angel did something second Angel did something and the third Angel did something now let us go a little further here mark of the beast and SE of God now I'm going tell you when when when I when I read this or when I heard this for the first time for me to help me understand my Bible when I don't have the quotes there to my side to be able to go back to I write little notes in my Bible that would give me a key to what I was reading so uh I'm giving you a little heads up it would be good for you to write a little note in your Bible to understand what the first Angel is what the second Angel is and what the third Angel is and if anybody ever come to you and want to have a Bible study about Revelation 14 you'll already have a little note in your Bible so you can explain a little something to them hello somebody now I'm getting ready to read to you the answer you want to be ready for the quiz here it is now out of the message the mark of the beast and the Seal of God Part Two Brother R says this now you see how it was represented in Ezekiel the 9th chapter at Jerusalem and we come to revelation and I like you to I I I he says now I like you that got your pencils didn't I just give y'all a little uh lead in I like for you that's got your pencils write this down watch I like you to write down Revelation 14: 6-12 that's the last three that's the the that's the the the the three Last Angels Three Angels after the the seven last Angels there were three special angels come forth did you notice that now now now I don't want y'all to be lost on this I'm going just I'm going have to explain this to you but I I'll read a little bit when you read about the seven Church ages Revelation 2 and Revelation 3 now Revelation 2 at the very end the theran church age the age goes into complete darkness and actually actually uh in history we actually have a period of history that we call the Dark Ages and those Dark Ages actually tie right into Revelation 2 to theran church age brother brandom connected what what what we've been teaching in history connects right with the scripture hallelujah amen but but when the church and and scripture says that they went into the depths of Satan during those Dark Ages Hallelujah but what happens in Revelation 3 light begins to come back in to the church and it starts in the ministry of Martin Luther glory to God oh my um Lord have mercy uh let me so let me just read the scripture here really quick so that that you you you might catch this out of the out of the Bible Revelation um uh 14:6 and I I saw another angel fly in the midst of Heaven having the Everlasting gospel to preach unto the uh unto them that dwell on the earth and to Every Nation um and to every nation and Kindred and tongue and people saying with a loud voice fear fear God and give give glory to him for the hour of his judgment has come and uh worship him that made Heaven and Earth and the Sea and the foundation uh and and and and and the foundation Fountains of waters now um I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm ahead of myself but to let you know that Ministry of the Everlasting gospel was the ministry of Luther and it connects to Revelation chapter 3 when Luther came coming out of the Dark Ages he came nailing 95 thesis to the church door and that's when light began to Spring forth and because Luther did what he did let me tell you something that's the reason we we're able to have the denomination churches the way we have today before then it was only Catholic or death but because Luther did what he did that's how they were able to get all the denominational churches however they got away from the word of God and we had to get back in Step oh my we thank God for what happened in Luther's day but there's more to it than that we thank God for what happened in Wesley's day but there's more to it than that now now now now I just I just gave you the first Angel was Luther who you think the second Angel going to be mhm and uh remember there was four death Messengers that took the life out of the church the palmerworm the cankerworm the Locust the caterpillar but there was four life Messengers that brought it back into the church and one was Luther the other was Wesley the third was the Pentecostals and the fourth was the word itself which came through a prophet William brandham let's go a little further let's go a little further in this quote amen you're already got the answers to your three Three Angels that are there so uh in that scripture um that's why it say it's already a past tense scripture Lu is already come Wesley's already come brother brandom's already come all of them are gone this is passed in scripture look at look at he says um that's the last three Angels these three angels and the and the Seven Last Angels there were three special angels come forth did you notice that now I I want you to notice them three Last Angels the first angel that's Revelation 146 to12 it says the first angel had sounded The Trumpet of the gospel and had the Everlasting gospel to preach to all the world and it says the second Angel kind of preached a Holiness gospel now um and brother brandom is spot on with this he spot on if if um I I'm a I'm a ver 8 I want to just catch uh um Revelation uh 14 and8 and I want you to just kind of see where where the Prophet brings these things watch this Revelation 148 there followed another Angel this is Wesley saying Babylon is Fallen is Fallen that great City because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication now watch what the prophet does in tying that word fornication into Wesley's Ministry he said he preached a Holiness gospel cuz uh you know if you fornicating you ain't living holy right and if it's spiritual fornication it's not holy amen praise God so here brother Brandon watch watch what he does here now he says he says um uh the second angel cter preached a Holiness gospel because he said that the church had committed fornication and the third Angel roared out to escape the mark of the beast watch the first Angel at the Reformation Luther preached the gospel second Angel Wesley sanctification the fornication he straightened up of the church but the third message the Pentecostal message should be the true Messenger warning them to escape the mark of the beast saying whosoever receives the mark of the beast the same will drink the wrath of God poured out without mixtion to the cup of indignation be poured out upon the people that's the very look at that statement right there that's the very message today the third Angel the third message the last message the Lutheran message of justification the Wesley message of of sanctification and the Pentecostal message of the Seal of God Escape The Mark of the Beast come out of them big walls of Babylon be sealed into the kingdom of God what I want you to understand is that this scripture is being fulfilled by Brother bram's Ministry I'm giving you scriptures to show you how God identified where this ministry what it would do amen and when it would come forth brother bram's Ministries identify as the third Ang angel of Revelation 14 we got the first M the first Angel was Luther the second one was Wesley the third is William brandom and look how he tied the Pentecostals in with that now remember when brother Brandon was born the Pentecostal Revival amen was just kind of coming to an end but God was raising up a prophet with the word to bring the people back to the word what what happened with Pentecost that we thank God for the gifts that was part of the the life that came back into the church we we we we received that with everything we got but you know listening to a tape this week what what happened is um the church has been going through a stage of maturity you see and and see it's just like a child I one of the children this morning I was sitting there in the back and when one of the children come in here and Bo they just got they was excited back there they was I don't know who it was but they was pretty excited they was they was they was ready to talk and said this is how the Pentecostal did they didn't know when to talk they were like little children right and and they didn't they didn't know when to talk they just get so excited about the presence of the Lord they just let it fly whenever the pastor could be behind the pull pit preaching but because they so excited they just let it fly now now now now now when that little child is doing that just letting it fly the Deacon's not going to go tap that little child on the shoulder hey little Johnny you going to have to hush the pastor's preaching no they just they If the child get too unruly they just take it to another room have the mama take it to another they don't rebuke the child they don't un christianize the child praise the Lord but but but they realize is just a child now as this child develops as the child gets older then there's a another set of expectations that is set on the child amen and and as they get older you ought to be old enough now where you can sit there and hear the word of God and don't blurt out unless you're blurting out an amen right don't interrupt the the preaching don't do this and and and and and and and just based on maturity level you you understand that amen that that the child is expected to act a certain way and this is what has happened to the church amen not that we re rejecting the gifts but now they''re been operated with maturity it it won't be no disrupting the preacher no no no no no no no we don't learn more than that it won't be the I mean yeah the gifts are welcome but it won't be to disrupt the preacher no because the the the the the the the the the the the uh the spirit of the prophets is subject to the prophets Hallelujah we understand what Paul was writing see so brother brandham told us that said all all we're seeing now is it's simply a maturity of that so so when when when when things are happen when when things are happen kind of underneath this level of maturity then it just happens differently but it's just as precious as it was it's and it's not it's not um let me put it off so it's not the amount of tongues that go forth we're not here trying to we not it's not a race it's not you know this not this not uh uh what what what what we're doing here is just just operating the way God has actually called us as a church to operate so you know what sometime in in in being a mature Christian oh Lord help me Jesus being a mature Christian you even understand where you come to church every service not going to be a jumping up and down service you don't have to jump up and down to know whether you done receive the word or not you ain't got to do all of that to know whether the word went forth or not every service not going to be you know like like that so so so so sometimes in the Pentecost Church boy they work that thing up they work that thing up to make sure that we have the same experience that we had yesterday no we don't have to do it that way glory to God when he comes he comes and we welcome him whenever he comes and and here's the other thing that we know amen just because the gifts didn't go forth in one service don't mean the gifts are gone the gifts are still here the gifts are still here but they might not operate all the time and it's that's okay hey glory to God we're not going to manufacture nothing here but we know we stand with the word of God oh my my my I I'm I'm glad that I can look in at this word I can pick up Revelation 16 and when it talk about the first Angel oh that that's the message of Luther and when you go back to I had it right here let me let me um give me Revelation uh 31 Revelation 3:7 Revelation 3:14 these are the three angels that that were spoken of here in Revelation um 14 look at this the very first verse Revelation three this is Martin Luther it says and unto the angel of the church another man a man Angel not not not not not not somebody coming down not a being coming down with wings no a man that God sends to the Earth with the the word of the Lord and you know his job is I'm going tell you specifically why this man was sent I'mma tell you it was to help the people of that day get back and step Revelation I mean Revelation 3:1 and unto the angel of the church and Sardis write these things sayith he that ha the seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars I Know Thy works that thou Hast a name that thou livest and art dead now and that's just so important because when when the reason that it said that that they had a name that that that said that they live is because Luther broke away from the Catholic church and the Lutheran formed not Luther didn't form it but the people that followed Luther formed that and the Lutheran form which which which gave birth to so many other denominations praise God and and all I could say there was a freedom to get away from the Catholic we thank God for that part but we the reason that says that they they had a name that they live is but are dead is because they went right back into the same system of things and when they go back into the same system of things God leaves it Hallelujah Revelation 3:7 here's the second angel with that Holiness gospel look at him this is John Wesley Revelation 3:7 and it says and to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write these things say he that is Holy now now look at that remember brother brand said he had a Holiness gospel look at look at what what what it said about about Wesley and and look at look how God how Jesus describes himself to this messenger he that is Holy Holiness gospel my God he that is true he that hath the Key of David he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth that's the second angel that we found there in Revelation 14 but the third Angel is found in Revelation 10:7 look at the connection of the scriptures I can just tell you right now a um a theologian a theologian can't make these connections but a prophet that's why I said you could take what a theologian said or you can take what a prophet said a prophet makes these connections look at this the lab look at this uh Revelation 3:14 this third Angel and unto the angel of the Church of the leans write these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God this Revelation 3:14 angel is connected and tied into a revelation 107 Angel they actually are the same Angel so let me read you Revelation 10:7 again I know you all are familiar with it but there somebody else that is unfamiliar and and I like going through this because we people know that we just not here uh just to be here but the word of God is what called us to this place amen Revelation 10:7 tells us this but in the day of the voice of the seventh angel that's the angel of Revelation 3:14 the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he have declared to his servants the prophets we are preaching from an open book because God has revealed these secrets to us through his Prophet we willing to receive that Prophet that's why we can take Revelation 14 and tell you it's past tense all right I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I think I'm done but let me uh I I I was reading oh oh um could I have mark of the beast um the mark of the beast the quote out of the mark of the beast now and let me just read this now and I'll I'll finish right here um other thing that I I want to make mention of so so I'm I'm reading from a sermon the mark of the beast and um everybody's so concerned about a chip in the hand or uh you know something in your forehead and they're G to scan you they G to scan you they G to scan you they got to chip in your body they're gonna scan you and get on don't don't you take that Mark of the Beast and and people just so afraid just fear fear fear fear fear it's not a tattoo in your head it's not a tattoo on your hand the mark of the beast is not a chip in your hand they they may need to do that I I you know they you got chips in your wallet right now on your on your uh your your credit card your debit card those are chips right now and and look when you go to that machine and you tap with that chip they know everything they got all your information and you're going to have to use that in order to buy buy grocery praise God some places won't even take cash no more and the reason that the reason a lot of that happen because of the crime high crime but folk don't want to have cash because they don't want to be robbed right so so so uh don't be afraid of little things like that that come out I can tell you right now and I don't have time to get all into this day but the mark of the beast is actually rejecting the mark of the beast and I'm going to go a little further I'm going go a little further because I it it's going to it's going to help somebody it's not just rejecting the word of God you got a lot of Sinners out there that did that and and they they they you know that they don't believe God you got people call themselves atheists they don't believe it's not it's not just rejecting the word of God that's the mark of the beast the mark of the beast is a religious mark so with it being a religious Mark the mark of the beast is rejecting the reveal word of God for your day I'm going tell you somebody in the Bible that that had the mark of the beast and didn't even realize it the Rich Young Ruler because he had an opportunity to receive the word he was in the presence of the word he was standing talking to the word and when he stood there talking to the word the the word told him sell everything you have and then come and follow me can I tell y'all what the word said today come out of my people and then come and follow me Hallelujah when when when when the Rich Young Ruler walked away from the word that day the Rich Young Ruler accepted the mark of the beast and we found out later on in Scripture that he lifted up his eyes in Hell oo Lord oo let me just try to read this one quote and I'm I'mma Be I'mma Be Done mark of the beast watch this so now this is the third Angel's message to the world and you know what the third Angel's message is going forth now in this day Revelation 14 has been fulfilled he says this is the flying of the third Angel message if you're a Bible reader there was three Wes follow it the first one happened in World War I second one happened in World War II and look at what the prophet say you see what we're going in now so the woes happened that triggered a World War and we having problems in the White House big problems big problems I Lord have mercy I I know if I say things like this I might get my my we might get our uh license revoked and don't say things about and now now now when they tell us that we can't say certain things then we we've lost some freedoms haven't we weren't we supposed to have some freedoms to that we can say certain things what what's some freedoms y'all tell me freedom of speech what right I mean didn't we didn't we create a a constitution that say we had these things and now they want to be taken away because somebody calls out the fallacies right but but when you see that I mean how you going to tell a man that got that's having his his country invaded oh Lord help us Jesus how you going to tell that man that he he he you know something wrong with him my country is being invaded my friend these guys just come out out of nowhere trying to take over my country what would you do if if they showed up at your at your Country Door trying to take over your country man said no I'm not going down like that man say he ain't going to be bullied and and if y'all w't fight with fight with me I I find somebody else to fight with me all right but but here the prophet tells us these things he says you see what's going in now it says all right we're at the end of the road now let's get this on our mind just before we read the scripture position we are bound to be at the End of the Age how long I don't know no one does and and so here's the thing when um when we see all these signs of the time Church uh it's very important for us to understand by scripture what God has done in this hour it's because look God ain't going to do nothing outside of the word he's not going to do it he it was this this word was written for any of us in here was born this word was already here so these things was already laid out the the the beautiful part about this is God has given us the privilege to see the manifestation Hallelujah of these scriptures with our own eyes we ought to thank God for that we we are we ought to serve God for that we ought to worship God Amen with everything we got knowing what God has done for us ain't nothing but the grace of God that has been given to us we can we can we can walk without fear here we can we can hold our heads up high we know uh scriptures told us that you know look up because our Redemption is drawing nigh and um uh I'm one that I I feel like there is one more Vision uh that we waiting to be fulfilled seven Visions before the coming of the Lord God gave it to the prophet in 1933 there's just one more waiting to be fulfilled and as that one is being fulfilled I'm praying that there's an exit at the same time time of the Fulfillment praise God You Know Before Destruction struck Sodom lot and his family were out and and and they could they could actually they were told not to look back his wife did but they could hear what was going on back there but they weren't in there and as we accident might hear some explosions but we won't be here we'll be on our way out church that's what I'm looking forward to amen I've I've given you some scriptures I got more I got more coming but we we we receive the Advent of the Prophet messenger and the reason we receive it is because we can see it in the scriptures God bless you Church praise God all right let's pray amen amen amen father I thank you for your word thank you for your truth thank you God that uh you have helped us to clearly see what you have done not just an our hour but we can look way back hundreds of years ago in the days of Luther the the days of Wesley we can see how you manifested yourself and how you use those Ministries but we also see how you use the Minister William brandom he helped us to be able to see these things God it's not uh happen stance it's not by chance it's that's not some uh it's not a cult that people would call it but it is a return to truth it's getting back in step and Lord we see it is very clear here in the word sometimes it's been misrepresented but God it's it's still true and Lord we pray that you would help us Lord to just hold uh Faithfully to the truth that has been given to us we trust oh God that uh you would use our lives may we be like a city upon a hill which cannot be hid may we be mindful of the opportunities we have to be able to share truth with others Lord is um the jobs the uh business contacts the people that you have us come in contact with there's purpose for all of that so help us to be mindful Lord of what your your spirit is doing in
