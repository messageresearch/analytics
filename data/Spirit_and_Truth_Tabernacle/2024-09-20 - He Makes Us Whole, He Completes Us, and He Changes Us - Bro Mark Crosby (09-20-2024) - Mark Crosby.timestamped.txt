[30:39] Lord and Lord we give you full control
[30:41] Lord take preeminence of your service
[30:43] take preeminence uh of all Spirits Lord
[30:46] we ask all these things in Jesus
[30:47] Christ's name we pray amen amen amen let
[30:51] turn our Bibles to Luke chapter 9 read a
[30:54] couple verses out of there and then I'll
[30:55] have you be seated
[30:59] so we'll start with verse um Luke 29:
[31:02] 23-
[31:05] 26 amen say Amen when you get
[31:13] there start my timer I
[31:17] forget amen and he said to them all if
[31:20] any man will come after me let him deny
[31:22] himself and take up his cross daily and
[31:25] follow me for whosoever will save his
[31:28] his life shall lose it but whosoever
[31:29] will lose his life for my sake the same
[31:32] shall save it for what is a a man
[31:34] Advantage if he gain the whole world and
[31:36] lose himself or be a cast away for
[31:39] whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of
[31:41] my words of him shall the son of man be
[31:43] ashamed when he shall come in his own
[31:45] glory and his father's glory and the own
[31:47] Holy Angels you may be seated may the
[31:49] Lord add the blessings to his word and
[31:52] then we'll jump to Mark
[31:54] 8:
[31:56] 34-38 so mark 8:
[32:03] 34-38 so the Bible says in verse 34 and
[32:07] when he called the people unto him with
[32:08] his disciples also he said unto them
[32:11] whosoever will come after me let him
[32:13] deny himself and take up his cross and
[32:15] follow me for whosoever will save his
[32:17] life shall lose it but whosoever shall
[32:19] lose his life for my sake and the
[32:21] gospels the same shall save it for what
[32:24] shall it profit a man if he shall gain
[32:26] the whole world and lose his own soul
[32:27] Soul or what should a man give in
[32:29] exchange for his soul whosoever
[32:31] therefore shall be ashamed of me and of
[32:33] my words in this adulterous generation
[32:36] sinful generation uh the son of man
[32:38] shall be ashamed when he cometh in the
[32:40] glory of the father of His Holy Angels
[32:42] so the title of this little sermon is he
[32:44] makes us whole He completes us and he
[32:47] changes us amen and so it's going to be
[32:49] a little different approach tonight um
[32:52] but just looking at my life as a young
[32:55] person just seeing the things that you
[32:57] guys are combating
[32:58] that I never that we never had to combat
[33:00] when I was growing up so especially as a
[33:02] young person today um we could try to do
[33:05] a lot of things we can strive for
[33:07] popularity we can be the most uh popular
[33:09] person in our school and our friend
[33:11] group um we can look to fancy things we
[33:14] can dress along with the Fashions of the
[33:16] world um we could even have the idea of
[33:18] how we want our life to be based upon
[33:20] the pattern of uh somebody famous um so
[33:23] we see all these things nowadays these
[33:25] get-rich quick schemes you got all these
[33:27] YouTubers and all these ticktockers and
[33:30] and they're making it look like it's so
[33:32] easy but what they're doing is they're
[33:33] influencing these young people to do the
[33:36] wrong thing they're they're showing this
[33:37] this image that is a false image of who
[33:40] they really are and it's causing so many
[33:42] people to try to make it big you got all
[33:45] these Instagram models and and you name
[33:47] it and our kids are trying to go after
[33:50] these things they're trying to pattern
[33:51] pattern after these things and what
[33:53] they're pattern after is a false life
[33:56] and and so it doesn't matter that you
[33:58] have the check mark or not it doesn't
[33:59] matter how much money you make but the
[34:01] thing is is it worth exchanging your
[34:03] soul all right because so many people
[34:05] that're exchanging their soul for these
[34:07] things and the end of the line they're
[34:09] going to regret what they did so just
[34:11] just talking to the young people today I
[34:13] remember uh I had a dream once um when I
[34:16] was uh in my early 20s I want to be the
[34:18] mo motivational speaker I Used to Love
[34:21] Les Brown you might know some of them
[34:22] and and Eric Thomas and I even uh went
[34:25] to a couple Eric Thomas' um convention
[34:28] he used to do free conventions in
[34:29] Michigan State and I had a desire and
[34:31] aspiration to be a motivational speaker
[34:33] and I used to make videos and everything
[34:35] and then I got to a point where I was
[34:36] like I don't think I'm going to make
[34:38] this because I wasn't will I wasn't
[34:40] willing to to put forth the effort the
[34:42] effort to do that but but I look back
[34:44] and see if I would have pursued that
[34:47] what would have really mattered oh
[34:49] because I would have been doing it for
[34:50] the money and for the popularity and so
[34:53] I thank God that he put a stop to that
[34:56] um because I could have went down a WR
[34:58] path and so just telling you guys that
[35:00] it's the same influence as that
[35:02] influence is today with the the
[35:03] ticktockers and the YouTubers and the
[35:05] same thing so let's keep it going so um
[35:08] let's go to Mark
[35:09] 10: 17 or Mark chap 10: 17 or chapter 17
[35:14] I'm sorry and we'll read verses 17- 22
[35:17] so I look I love this story of the Rich
[35:19] Young Ruler in Mark chapter 10 because
[35:22] it really uh typifies us as young people
[35:25] because this man had the same uh
[35:27] opportunity you have tonight which is
[35:29] eternal life laid before you and we're
[35:31] going to see what decision this young
[35:32] man made in chapter 17 so and when he
[35:35] was gone forth into the way there came
[35:37] one running and kneeled to him and ask
[35:39] him good Master what shall I do that I
[35:41] may inherit eternal life so this young
[35:44] man knew that he was lacking something
[35:46] he knew that something was missing in
[35:48] his life he he went to church he
[35:50] probably prayed he probably gave his
[35:52] arms offerings tithes Etc but something
[35:55] was missing deep down inside he he
[35:57] didn't feel whole he didn't feel
[35:59] complete he knew something had to change
[36:01] him so that's why he came to Jesus
[36:03] running glory and so we see this and
[36:05] Jesus said unto him why callest thou me
[36:08] good there is none good but one that is
[36:10] God thou knowest the Commandments do not
[36:13] commit adultery do not kill do not steal
[36:15] do not bear false witness defraud not
[36:17] honor thy father and thy mother and he
[36:19] answered and said unto him master all
[36:21] these have I observed from my youth up
[36:23] so this wasn't some uh ill-fame person
[36:25] but this is a man who who who who feared
[36:27] God because he respected the
[36:29] Commandments and so we see in um verse
[36:32] 21 then Jesus beholding him loved him so
[36:35] Jesus loved this man and he said unto
[36:37] him one thing thou lackest it wasn't
[36:40] many things but it was one thing that
[36:42] stopped him from inheriting eternal life
[36:44] and so I say to you guys tonight don't
[36:46] let one thing get in the way of you
[36:48] inheriting eternal life cuz this man
[36:51] after he made his decision he thought
[36:53] that he was all good to go but the end
[36:55] of his line he woke up
[36:58] uh and and he woke up in torment and he
[37:00] realized that his decision wasn't the
[37:02] best decision he's made and he he asked
[37:04] Abraham can you send one can you send
[37:06] one up from the dead Lazarus he said if
[37:09] they wouldn't believe one from the dead
[37:10] if they don't believe the prophet so
[37:11] just saying this that we got to make a
[37:14] decision tonight right sir because this
[37:17] could be your last chance to make a
[37:18] decision amen and living for God is the
[37:21] best thing you can do as a young person
[37:23] I wish when I was your age that I I was
[37:25] serious with God and live for him I
[37:27] could avoid a lot of scars that I have
[37:29] in my life a lot of things I got into
[37:31] because I decided to turn away from God
[37:34] but you guys have such a beautiful
[37:35] support system here see I didn't grow up
[37:38] in a home we went to the message church
[37:39] but the it wasn't the church what we
[37:41] learned in church wasn't brought into
[37:42] the home so we could do what we want at
[37:44] home play any kind of games watch any
[37:46] kind of TV and uh I had such a bad
[37:50] influence that we went to church but it
[37:52] it wasn't that wasn't enough amen
[37:54] because your parents are your biggest
[37:56] influence what what you see them doing
[37:59] is going to be what you're going to do
[38:00] as you grow up and so I I my parents did
[38:03] the best they could I thank God for my
[38:05] parents but but I looking back there's a
[38:08] lot of things my brother and I that we
[38:10] we saw that I wish we could unsee that
[38:12] we saw my mom and our dad doing but but
[38:15] but but going forward with that is I'm
[38:17] thankful that I went through these
[38:18] things because I can share these things
[38:20] with you guys that I went through these
[38:22] experiences that you don't have to go
[38:23] through the same thing that I went
[38:24] through amen let's finish this little
[38:27] story
[38:28] uh then Jesus beholding him loved him
[38:30] and said to him one thing thou lackest
[38:32] go thy way sell whatsoever thou Hast and
[38:35] give to the poor and thou shall have
[38:36] treasure in heaven come up and take the
[38:39] cross and follow me and he was sad at
[38:41] this saying and went away grieved for he
[38:43] had great possessions so just say we may
[38:46] not have riches tonight but there's
[38:48] something in our life we could be
[38:49] holding on to just as this young man was
[38:51] holding to his riches so saying here
[38:54] tonight is don't let anything get in the
[38:56] way of your walk with God I I can tell
[38:59] you that don't let anything because this
[39:01] man wish he could go back and change his
[39:03] decision because the decision is so
[39:06] vital one decision can impact your whole
[39:09] entire adulthood so you got to be
[39:12] careful the decisions that you make um
[39:14] because one decision canot only impact
[39:16] you but your parents your church family
[39:20] sir and so that's why we really careful
[39:22] decisions that you make um I thank God I
[39:24] look back in my life there's some
[39:26] decisions that I made that should
[39:27] destroyed my life but thankful the hand
[39:29] of God was there to protect me amen and
[39:33] so let's go read into a quote now and
[39:36] this Rich Young Ruler um as we call it
[39:39] in the Bible he passed up a great
[39:41] opportunity he had the opportunity to
[39:43] put his riches of this world into a
[39:45] guaranteed plan but he failed to do it
[39:49] this is investment uh message investment
[39:51] so I look at this we may not be
[39:52] investing money right now but we're
[39:54] investing our life so what are you
[39:56] investing your life into right now are
[39:58] you investing your life into Tik Tok
[40:01] YouTube are you investing your life
[40:03] trying to make a name for yourself
[40:05] popularity are you trying to impress
[40:06] somebody cuz we're not here to try to
[40:08] impress somebody only person we want to
[40:10] please is God himself because if you're
[40:13] a people pleaser you can never truly
[40:15] please a person because the person is
[40:17] going to keep wanting more from you more
[40:18] and more and more so make sure that
[40:20] you're not trying to please somebody by
[40:22] your image or or trying to act cool or
[40:24] or trying to sound like something you're
[40:25] not this be who God made you to be God
[40:29] made everybody specific way so you're
[40:31] fearfully and wonderfully made as the
[40:32] Bible says so but he failed he didn't do
[40:36] it he was given opportunity that he
[40:37] could draw interest on it make a great
[40:40] investment but he failed to accept that
[40:42] opportunity so much as many of us do
[40:44] today we find out that it's too bad but
[40:47] we do it now although this plan he was
[40:49] offered was perfectly Vindicated it was
[40:52] sound when Jesus came to the Earth he
[40:54] proved that he was what he said he was
[40:56] he was God
[40:57] manifested In the Flesh he brought it a
[40:59] showdown and said if I do not the works
[41:01] of my father then Believe Me Not So this
[41:04] young man was like the great Rich leoan
[41:06] age that we live in they see a great
[41:08] opportunity to invest in something but
[41:10] it's not popular Jesus was not a popular
[41:13] man in his days only amongst the poor
[41:15] and illiterate the church of his day the
[41:17] denomination of his day or the
[41:19] secondaryan religions had nothing to do
[41:21] with him but there must have been
[41:23] something about him that this Rich Young
[41:25] Ruler seen in Jesus then he did not see
[41:28] in others he didn't not have the common
[41:30] good sense to come and ask what he might
[41:32] do because he had seen in Jesus there
[41:34] was a quality that he didn't see in
[41:36] anyone else notice that but you see he
[41:39] was very rich with the things of this
[41:40] world we have a lovely picture of this
[41:42] in later see in age in Revelations 3
[41:45] because you say you are rich and have
[41:47] need of nothing and yet knowest thou not
[41:49] that thou wretched poor miserable blind
[41:51] and naked so just going back we're going
[41:53] to go to Ecclesiastes 12: um 13 through
[41:57] 14 so I look back and just seeing how
[41:59] you guys have such a beautiful uh role
[42:01] models in your life parents a wonderful
[42:05] Pastor brothers and sisters so all all
[42:07] these things that you have and it's also
[42:09] brought into your homes I wish I would
[42:11] have had that when I was growing up I
[42:13] believe it would have it would have
[42:14] helped me a lot from not making some
[42:16] decisions I made in my life that they're
[42:18] still affecting me today so I just tell
[42:20] you that's how how serious a decision is
[42:22] decisions I made in my youth that are
[42:24] still affecting me today because I made
[42:27] that bad decision I didn't know better
[42:29] but now since I know better I can say to
[42:31] you guys like brother Smiley said don't
[42:33] do the things that I did and we we'll
[42:35] get later into that I'll explain some of
[42:37] my my story of the things I did so let's
[42:39] go to Ecclesiastes chapter 12 and we'll
[42:42] read verse one oh my I'll read it from
[42:45] here so remember now thy Creator in the
[42:47] days of thy youth so right now this the
[42:50] days of your youth right now while the
[42:52] evil days come not so you're not
[42:54] tarnished like I was I got in the things
[42:56] I wish I did I didn't see so while the
[42:59] evil days come not nor the years draw
[43:01] nigh when thou shalt say I have no
[43:04] pleasure and so right now you have no
[43:05] pleasure in so I'm telling you right now
[43:08] is remember thy Creator in the days of
[43:10] thy youth right now don't wait until
[43:12] your 25 and 30 when when everything is
[43:15] just is falling apart let's go to verse
[43:17] um let's go to verse uh 13- 14 please oh
[43:20] my so let us hear the conclusion of the
[43:23] whole matter it's simple we got to keep
[43:25] it simple when serving God fear God keep
[43:28] his Commandments for this is the whole
[43:30] duty of man just keep it simple don't
[43:33] make it harder than it has to be for God
[43:35] shall bring every work into judgment
[43:37] with every secret thing whether it be
[43:39] good or whether it be evil so don't try
[43:41] to hide things from your
[43:42] parents God has a way of bringing those
[43:45] things you're trying to hide every time
[43:47] I remember um uh a precious friend of
[43:49] mine brother John I remember uh his wife
[43:52] uh sister Cheryl was at home one day and
[43:54] the Lord spoke to her that her son was
[43:56] hiding weed in a in a a pot somewhere
[43:59] around the house and she looked in there
[44:01] and found it so just like something like
[44:03] that she never knew that he never told
[44:05] her but God told sister chery personally
[44:08] so you can't hide anything from God God
[44:11] is going to bring it up to the surface
[44:13] you might as well just be truthful
[44:14] because I remember um you remember the
[44:16] story brother BR was talking about this
[44:17] young man um his mom asked if he smoked
[44:20] cigarettes and he said no and he put
[44:21] coffee on his breath and he said that
[44:23] one lie destroyed his whole life he
[44:26] became a habitual
[44:27] that means he kept lying and lying and
[44:29] lying off one little lie so the same
[44:31] thing with that is don't try to cover
[44:33] things up just be truthful cuz it's only
[44:35] going to hurt you in the end all right
[44:37] brother let's go praise God so now I'm
[44:41] speaking from experience I wish I would
[44:42] have given my heart to the Lord at the
[44:44] early age I wish I would because I would
[44:46] avoided a lot of things in my life that
[44:48] I I have to deal with now because the
[44:50] what the devil likes to do is he likes
[44:52] to bring up your past likes to beat you
[44:54] in the head with it so I'm telling you
[44:56] guys is don't make don't make a past
[44:59] that that the devil can use as
[45:01] ammunition against you because God will
[45:04] forgive you he will but the devil won't
[45:07] he's going to bring it he's going to
[45:08] bring it up over and time and time again
[45:10] so I'm saying now is don't make a pass
[45:13] like I made a past amen
[45:16] so so my advice to you is don't test the
[45:19] waters don't go out and test what the
[45:21] world can offer you cuz the world ain't
[45:23] got nothing but death and destruction
[45:25] the world will spit you out don't go
[45:27] trying after uh fellas after girl after
[45:29] girl no don't do that girls don't don't
[45:32] try after guy after guy don't do that it
[45:34] it's not worth it that's right keep
[45:36] yourself amen keep yourself until it
[45:38] it's time to be married cuz it's not
[45:41] worth it glory
[45:44] glory god amen so just so now just just
[45:48] remembering out there life it's death
[45:50] out there just remember there always
[45:51] death out there the devil can paint some
[45:53] beautiful picture to you but ain't
[45:55] nothing but death it ain't nothing it's
[45:57] like an apple that looks good but when
[45:58] you bite it it's rotten to the core just
[46:01] like that
[46:03] amen so let's go to Hebrews
[46:06] 11 and we'll read uh verses 23- 27 So
[46:09] it's talking about another young man who
[46:12] had the same choice that this Rich Young
[46:13] Ruler had Moses had the opportunity he
[46:16] he even tasted some of those riches
[46:19] being in in in Pharaoh's Kingdom he was
[46:21] next in line of pharaoh could have had
[46:23] any woman that he wanted but he chose
[46:25] not to choose those things
[46:27] he he had he had opportunity placing his
[46:30] hands like the Rich Young Ruler to take
[46:32] life or death and Moses chose Life by
[46:34] faith Moses when he was born was hid
[46:36] three months of his parents because they
[46:38] saw he was a proper child they were not
[46:40] afraid of the king's commandment by
[46:42] faith Moses when he was come to years
[46:45] refused to be called the son of
[46:47] Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to
[46:49] suffer Affliction with the people of god
[46:52] notice this statement right here than to
[46:54] enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season
[46:57] sin does feel good to the
[46:59] flesh but it only lasts for a season and
[47:02] you'll regret all the pleasure that you
[47:04] had cuz I I I've been there before it
[47:07] doesn't feel good it may feel good in
[47:09] the moment but after you do it it does
[47:11] not feel good you feel disgusted you
[47:14] feel disgraced and so I'm telling you is
[47:16] don't try to enjoy the pleasures of sin
[47:19] for a season it's not worth it amen the
[47:22] devil the devil will call you and then
[47:24] once you get into it he'll Point his
[47:26] finger at you laugh at you that's how
[47:28] that's how the enemy Works yes sir so
[47:30] choosing rather suffer Affliction with
[47:32] the people of God than to enjoy the
[47:33] pleasures of sin for a season esteeming
[47:36] the approach of Christ's greater riches
[47:38] than the treasures of Egypt so he didn't
[47:40] care about being the the next YouTube
[47:43] Star we could say he didn't care about
[47:44] being the next tick tocker he didn't
[47:46] care about those things but what he care
[47:48] about is his call that he felt inside
[47:50] his heart of God and there is a calling
[47:53] your heart right now to God and you can
[47:55] either choose to quench it or you can
[47:57] choose to to build it so by faith he
[48:01] forsook Egypt not fearing the Wrath of
[48:04] the king for he endured and seeing who
[48:05] is invisible so tonight is don't try to
[48:08] impress your parents by putting on some
[48:10] front of you walking with God you got to
[48:13] have a personal experience for yourself
[48:15] you can only fool somebody for so long
[48:18] your parents can tell if you really have
[48:19] a walk with God you can't fool them I'm
[48:23] sorry you just can't fool them so I
[48:25] suggest this see God for yourself come
[48:28] come and taste what God really is see
[48:30] what what benefits he has give your life
[48:33] to him see how he directs you and leads
[48:34] you yes and go to Psalms
[48:38] 1199 now I'll share a little bit of my
[48:53] testimony so the Bible says in verse 9
[48:55] where wether shall young man cleanse his
[48:58] way by taking heed there into according
[49:01] to Thy word so start at young age
[49:04] getting just falling in love with the
[49:06] word cuz when you fall in love with the
[49:08] word you fall in love with God they're
[49:09] one and the same and so I just remember
[49:12] growing up um we I started going to a
[49:15] message church when I was about 9 years
[49:16] old I'll never forget um my uncle found
[49:19] this church when he was living in South
[49:20] Carolina and he found a church for us
[49:23] and um we would go to church all the
[49:25] time we go to Wednesdays and Sundays we
[49:27] would go to youth youth service or or
[49:29] like youth um like youth outings and
[49:31] stuff like that but it was never
[49:32] something that was really practicies in
[49:34] the home and like I said when we got
[49:36] home we could listen to any kind of
[49:37] music like rap bet you name it Snoop
[49:40] Dogg all that stuff we could my Dad
[49:42] loved Tupac so I love Tupac so all these
[49:44] influences I had in my home but one
[49:46] thing I do appreciate my dad for many
[49:48] things is he would always make us go to
[49:50] church on Sunday I never wanted to go to
[49:52] church on Sunday sometimes I just wanted
[49:54] just to stay home but he would always
[49:56] make us go to church and I'm thankful
[49:57] for that amen but anyway so during that
[49:59] time growing up um I listen to all kind
[50:02] of music from Under the Sun and um
[50:04] anyways I I remember um as I was growing
[50:07] up um I always see always see my stepmom
[50:09] always go to church even when I wasn't
[50:11] going to church and and so I I looked up
[50:13] to that and see my grandma go I always
[50:15] looked up to that seeing my mom and my
[50:16] grandma always going to church and one
[50:18] thing I really appreciate that the
[50:20] Saints at my old church would always
[50:21] pray for me like I told you a statement
[50:23] before um my Sunday school teacher would
[50:26] always set a timer in her phone to pray
[50:28] for my brother and I every single day
[50:30] and that that really touched my heart um
[50:33] because I believe that God was honoring
[50:35] those prayers you know and keeping me
[50:37] from certain things and um I remember
[50:40] back in the day one of my best friends
[50:41] Doug my best friend Doug we would um
[50:43] always go to his house on the weekends
[50:45] and uh we would drink underage drinking
[50:47] I would I was underage but um I would do
[50:49] things like that and it seemed fun and
[50:51] harmless at the time but I look back and
[50:53] I remember my brother was saying back in
[50:55] the day Mark youed should to drink like
[50:57] a pirate I was like really did I and
[50:59] this this statements like that I was
[51:00] just seeing myself get into and and my
[51:03] parents you know never discouraged it
[51:05] you know we would be at their house
[51:06] drinking sometimes they would never
[51:07] discouraged it just all fun in games and
[51:10] and so there certain things that I got
[51:12] into because I knew I believed in God I
[51:15] knew God was real but I didn't want to
[51:17] live the life because I thought the life
[51:19] was some like in the Box boring life and
[51:22] so so so the devil painted some picture
[51:24] to me that being a Christian isn't fun
[51:27] go test the waters you know go go you
[51:29] you believe in God you good and so I got
[51:31] in a lot of addictions and things like
[51:33] that in my life and I was looking just
[51:35] you know how the devil just got in my
[51:37] life and just told me all these lies
[51:40] because I thought being a Christian
[51:41] wasn't fun at all but being a Christian
[51:43] that's really living life to the fullest
[51:45] right there that's living life to the
[51:47] fullest because the devil will paint
[51:49] some pictures saying go out go out
[51:50] clubbing over here party over here
[51:52] womanizing over here that's fun no
[51:54] that's not fun that's just death that's
[51:56] right leading you one step closer to
[51:57] death and and so looking back I'll tell
[52:00] you this one Testament was my friend's
[52:02] house um his name was Steven and um he
[52:04] gave me a beer and I was drinking it and
[52:07] I I'll never forget this voice I went to
[52:09] take another Sip and this voice said
[52:11] don't drink anymore and mind you what
[52:13] that probably was in 2016 and was it
[52:16] going to be to another year I would
[52:17] start serving God and so so I just he I
[52:19] just heeded to the voice right and when
[52:21] I he to that voice I'll tell you this
[52:24] God works even when you don't realize
[52:26] he's working working in your life cuz
[52:28] when I heeded to that voice I lost all
[52:29] desire to drink when I say it just left
[52:32] it left just like that but mind you I
[52:34] still wasn't serving God then but God
[52:36] was doing a small little work and so I'm
[52:39] looking back to um so my my job at
[52:41] Costco back in Michigan we could listen
[52:43] to any kind of music we want to you name
[52:45] it but they said one thing you have to
[52:46] do is censor it if it has profanity and
[52:49] so I was like all right that's fine and
[52:51] so it was funny how God was working so I
[52:54] I agreed to it I was like whatever
[52:55] that's fine and so it was funny so when
[52:57] I started listening to censor music I
[53:00] didn't want to listen to cussing anymore
[53:02] so God was just like slowly just like
[53:03] working in my life on that it's slowly
[53:05] working in my life and so and so but I
[53:07] look back all these things that got into
[53:09] was was my fault it was my decision I
[53:11] couldn't blame anybody else because I
[53:13] made the decision to do it and so God
[53:16] was just working slowly and I'll never
[53:18] forget
[53:18] 2017 um I just felt like a a strange
[53:22] call cuz I remember I I would go to
[53:24] church and then I would leave and go to
[53:26] church and leave and I felt like a
[53:28] really strong calling in my heart that
[53:29] year just that I needed to get back in
[53:32] get back in church and get back on God
[53:34] and so around September um I was uh I
[53:36] had this addiction for many years and um
[53:39] and so I just was praying to God that
[53:41] month Lord I just can't do this anymore
[53:43] Lord this addiction is just tearing me
[53:45] up nobody knows about it but me and you
[53:47] but lord it's it's hurting me mentally
[53:50] physically and I I just can't do this
[53:51] anymore and I'll tell you this when when
[53:53] a person's addicted with something and
[53:55] you want God to really do something you
[53:57] got to show God that you really mean
[53:58] business because it's many times that
[54:01] you can you can say God I want
[54:02] Deliverance but you're still holding on
[54:03] to it and I told God I can't do this
[54:06] anymore I need your help I don't care
[54:07] what I got to do but I I need to be
[54:09] delivered from this so anyway so during
[54:12] that time that month um I started da I
[54:14] started um I started talking to this
[54:16] girl at the Costco at the time and we
[54:18] started connecting and come to find that
[54:20] she was a Christian a non-denominational
[54:21] Christian and I was like okay maybe let
[54:23] go somewhere and so I started dating her
[54:26] and everything and and um it it kind of
[54:29] didn't work out because we had different
[54:30] views you know what I'm saying because I
[54:32] was starting to get back into the word
[54:34] cuz even when I was in the world when I
[54:36] would take long trips I would still
[54:37] listen to the message of the hour you I
[54:39] was still cuz I knew it was I knew it
[54:40] was the truth like knew deep down inside
[54:42] that the message was the truth and so
[54:44] I'll I'll play the tape on and listen to
[54:46] it you know for a couple hours and but
[54:47] anyway so during that time I was dating
[54:49] this girl and um it was many red flags
[54:51] and I was like ah don't worry about the
[54:53] red flags we get into arguments and one
[54:55] thing I realized when I was dating her
[54:57] that we had same upbringings almost
[55:00] because um one thing I inherited from my
[55:03] dad I didn't realize till um God showed
[55:06] me because it would be brought out in
[55:07] certain situations that I would be very
[55:09] Petty sometimes argumentive and um it
[55:12] would come out only when I was put under
[55:14] pressure and so during that relationship
[55:16] God showed me that I had all these
[55:19] things inherited from my dad and my mom
[55:21] seeing what they did in the home and not
[55:23] even realizing that it was embedded
[55:25] inside of me because I I saw them do it
[55:27] all the time arguing uh yelling cussing
[55:29] you name I used to cuss like a sailor
[55:31] like at work all the time and so anyway
[55:33] so we were getting arguments all the
[55:35] time and finally we kind of like end up
[55:37] breaking it off and um I never forget it
[55:40] was a Saturday it was a Saturday that we
[55:42] went to this this church that she wanted
[55:44] to go to it's called like it's 242 like
[55:47] we walk into church I kid you not you
[55:49] look to the left it's a big soccer field
[55:51] then you see this nice little coffee bar
[55:52] over here and I'm like man like I'm I'm
[55:54] in recess
[55:58] so yeah you see this big old church and
[56:00] we we go in here and I never forget
[56:02] because another thing that was a red
[56:04] flag too is that she smoked weed and it
[56:06] was that was another red flag FL yeah
[56:08] all these red flags y was just show them
[56:10] I'm like n she the one no she the one
[56:13] you
[56:15] know
[56:20] brother and so so so after the sermon um
[56:23] after the sermon I forgot the sermon was
[56:25] even about it was like it it was crazy
[56:27] CU like at those churches they have like
[56:29] a certain program set up and they'll
[56:30] have the same thing again and anyway so
[56:33] it was about like some I can't remember
[56:34] what it was about so we were driving
[56:36] together in a car and she asked me this
[56:38] question she was like do you think I
[56:41] have the Holy Ghost and I told her
[56:44] no
[56:46] I I was like
[56:49] no so I told her straight up no because
[56:52] I was looking at you know certain things
[56:54] that it wasn't lined up with the word of
[56:56] God so anyway so we ended it mutually
[56:58] and everything so we we ended
[57:02] mutually to tell the truth
[57:06] truth so we ended it mutually so during
[57:09] that time um so one thing I was addicted
[57:11] to um during that one one time I was
[57:13] addicted to in 2017 before I started
[57:15] dating her I used to be really addicted
[57:17] to working out like when I say addicted
[57:19] to working out I literally would be at
[57:21] home I would take my shirt off do
[57:22] push-ups and look at the pump in the
[57:23] mirror that that's how bad it was I
[57:25] literally I was working out because I
[57:27] wanted to show off what I had to other
[57:30] other girls and the funny thing was my
[57:32] goal was to pull girls and I didn't pull
[57:33] one
[57:36] girl the Lord knows what he's doing
[57:40] stop did not pull out one
[57:43] girl not one but so but anyways I I
[57:47] remember this um during that time I
[57:50] started dating that girl and I I asked
[57:52] the Lord too to deliver me from this
[57:53] thing I was struggling with and um so
[57:56] anyways we ended up on a Saturday and
[57:57] then Sunday goes by and then Monday hits
[58:00] at that time I was working two jobs I
[58:02] work in a Costco in Target probably
[58:03] about 65 hours a week working like a mad
[58:05] man going to the gym 5 days a week I
[58:07] don't know how I did it working like 11
[58:09] hours a day I was a crazy man anyway so
[58:12] it was a Monday and I was just leaving
[58:14] from Costco into my second job at Target
[58:17] I never forget I was just um I was
[58:20] literally in my car just sitting and
[58:22] kind of like reality just like hit like
[58:24] cuz you know you know how guys sometimes
[58:25] like to be like this little tough roll
[58:27] like you know that breakup didn't affect
[58:28] me and so I'm in my car and I just start
[58:31] crying I just start just literally start
[58:33] crying like a little baby and um and I
[58:36] was just like you know Lord I I just
[58:37] can't do this anymore Lord I just I was
[58:39] like Lord I don't care what I have to do
[58:42] I don't care what I have to give up Lord
[58:44] I want to serve you and I'll never
[58:46] forget I I gave my heart to that day I
[58:47] gave my heart in a in a car that day and
[58:50] I just told God like Lord just lead me
[58:52] and guide me and I remember I got out
[58:54] that car and and I tell you I was
[58:58] changed I felt complete I felt whole I
[59:02] felt
[59:03] changed Hallelujah and I'll never forget
[59:05] that ever in my life and when the devil
[59:08] tries to like uh you know how the devil
[59:10] does all these baggage I look back in
[59:12] that day and said Lord I know I met with
[59:14] you in that car I know I met with you in
[59:15] that car I have not been the same and so
[59:18] and so that that that that week was the
[59:19] week of Thanksgiving I never forget
[59:21] it'll be seven years this day seven
[59:24] years I never forget cuz my uncle was
[59:26] always recommending me to read the
[59:28] church age book and I was like all right
[59:29] I'll read it so I started Thanksgiving
[59:31] and what I did was um so when I was
[59:32] working I would wake up two hours before
[59:34] I had to go to work I'll hit my knees
[59:36] and pray I'll read the word in the in a
[59:39] church age book Faithfully every day and
[59:41] the Lord just started to reveal things
[59:43] to me his word started to become I used
[59:45] to read the word I like man I don't
[59:46] understand this all these these and THS
[59:48] and these and arts and Nows and so as I
[59:51] was start reading the word and asking
[59:53] God to reveal it he start just revealing
[59:54] himself to me man the church age book
[59:56] God just opened up door I was just like
[59:59] wow and so so anyway so we we broke up
[1:00:02] so the hardest thing was when we broke
[1:00:04] up was I worked in this depart the
[1:00:06] produce department and she worked in the
[1:00:07] deli department so I literally would see
[1:00:09] her every single day and that was like
[1:00:12] the hardest thing it it was just so hard
[1:00:15] every day I it' be a constant struggle
[1:00:18] and so the funny thing was that um I
[1:00:21] remember um so she she asked me if I
[1:00:24] wanted to um she's going to do Bible
[1:00:25] studies at her house and if I wanted to
[1:00:27] come in my mind I'm like no I don't want
[1:00:29] to go and so the funny thing was she did
[1:00:31] it on Wednesday nights but we had
[1:00:33] service Wednesday night so I was like I
[1:00:35] can't do it because I got service so I
[1:00:37] didn't have to tell her like I didn't
[1:00:38] want to do this but
[1:00:41] anyway so so anyway so that happened and
[1:00:44] um is the funny thing was this this this
[1:00:47] random thing happened like out of the
[1:00:48] blue so she actually ended up have
[1:00:50] having to move um out of the blue
[1:00:53] because her mom had to sell the house
[1:00:55] she was living in so literally she had
[1:00:58] to move all the way to Florida and it it
[1:01:00] it was funny it wasn't funny but it was
[1:01:02] I could see the Lord was just moved and
[1:01:04] separated us for a reason and um I was
[1:01:07] just looking back and seeing like thank
[1:01:08] you Lord because Lord knew I was just
[1:01:10] struggling like it was so hard every day
[1:01:12] and so anyway so that happened and that
[1:01:14] was 2017 that was like probably like uh
[1:01:17] November and then uh also I was getting
[1:01:19] knee surgery um come in January cuz I
[1:01:21] tore my ACL had like no meniscus it was
[1:01:24] a lot of stuff going on on my knee and
[1:01:26] so January 3rd went around and um I I
[1:01:29] remember that time from January to May
[1:01:32] that was a time that I really got a
[1:01:33] chance to really get a hold of God
[1:01:35] because I was like at home I couldn't
[1:01:37] really do nothing so what I did was I I
[1:01:39] put it in my heart that I'm going to se
[1:01:41] God with all my heart I'm going to bathe
[1:01:43] and soak in the message of the hour the
[1:01:45] word of God prayer CU all this free time
[1:01:48] I'm going to use this free time for God
[1:01:50] so every time the devil would attack me
[1:01:52] when I was going through that um I was
[1:01:54] asking God for deliverance I would just
[1:01:55] every time the devil would tempt me I'll
[1:01:57] just go in my head and just pray to God
[1:01:59] say Lord just give me the strength to
[1:02:01] overcome this every time God would be
[1:02:02] faithful every single time so during
[1:02:05] that time from January to may I I love
[1:02:07] that time because I can't tell you the
[1:02:10] exact day it happened but I remember one
[1:02:11] day it was maybe like in the springtime
[1:02:13] maybe early summer I just remember I
[1:02:16] just felt free and that that made God
[1:02:19] even more real for me because he
[1:02:20] delivered me from this addiction I had
[1:02:21] for over 12 years plus and so I it
[1:02:24] showed me how real God was cuz now I
[1:02:27] experienced him in a car I experienced
[1:02:29] him in Deliverance in healing of my need
[1:02:32] all these things I was experien in God
[1:02:34] but I had to seek Him for myself because
[1:02:37] I heard about him in church I heard him
[1:02:40] preach ACR the pulpit many times I heard
[1:02:42] many times uh the pastor saying God can
[1:02:44] deliver you through this God can do this
[1:02:46] but I never experienced for myself so it
[1:02:48] wasn't real to me amen but when I when I
[1:02:51] asked God to to give me this Deliverance
[1:02:53] Lord please he came in and gave it to me
[1:02:56] Hallelujah and ever since I never forget
[1:02:59] that day I I just felt changed it felt
[1:03:01] it felt like 1,000 lbs was lifted off of
[1:03:03] me and so I just see that moment I have
[1:03:05] from January to May that's what really
[1:03:08] established me and as young people why
[1:03:11] you don't have jobs you don't have this
[1:03:13] get established in God get established
[1:03:16] in
[1:03:17] God and so I just see I just see God
[1:03:20] just moving in my life but all these
[1:03:22] things I had to extra things I had to
[1:03:24] endure because I got into with the
[1:03:26] getting the wrong group of friends G
[1:03:29] getting the wrong I was dirty jokes
[1:03:31] galore I would all the time dirty jokes
[1:03:33] F Bombs all these things but but look
[1:03:36] where it got me it it got me in trouble
[1:03:39] and I thank God I never got in legal
[1:03:41] trouble or law trouble I thank God that
[1:03:43] he protected me from these things and so
[1:03:45] just saying these things is young people
[1:03:49] have a personal experience with God and
[1:03:51] don't stop there get filled with the
[1:03:54] Holy Ghost it's the greatest thing that
[1:03:56] you can ever do in your life because the
[1:03:59] world doesn't care the world will just
[1:04:02] destroy
[1:04:03] you and so don't let the world destroy
[1:04:06] you amen let's go to Proverbs 18:24
[1:04:10] praise God so it says a man that ha
[1:04:14] friends must show himself friendly and
[1:04:16] there's a friend that Stith closer than
[1:04:18] a brother so Jesus Christ he he know
[1:04:22] let's go to Hebrew go Hebrews I love
[1:04:23] this Hebrews thing cuz as a young person
[1:04:26] you got to realize that there's somebody
[1:04:28] who understands you when you think your
[1:04:30] parents don't understand you Jesus
[1:04:32] Christ was tempted above all measure he
[1:04:34] been through he been through sexual
[1:04:36] Temptation he been through rich tempt
[1:04:38] all these things he's been through so he
[1:04:40] can relate to you don't think we don't
[1:04:41] have a God that can relate to us he
[1:04:43] literally was on this Earth and
[1:04:45] experienced all the things that you're
[1:04:46] experiencing so he can relate to you so
[1:04:49] let's go to Hebrews real quick it was
[1:04:51] not on my notes
[1:04:54] but one second
[1:04:56] so it's Hebrews 4 and we'll go to uh
[1:04:59] 4:14 seeing that we have a high a great
[1:05:02] high priest that is passed into the
[1:05:03] heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold
[1:05:07] fast our profession for we have not a
[1:05:10] high priest which cannot be touched with
[1:05:11] the feeling of our infirmities so he
[1:05:13] knows what you're going through right
[1:05:15] now maybe some of you guys tonight are
[1:05:17] on the line if you want to be a
[1:05:18] Christian or not maybe some of you guys
[1:05:20] say I don't know if I want this life I
[1:05:21] don't know if I can do this life I'll
[1:05:23] tell you this God knows how you're
[1:05:25] feeling just pour out to them because
[1:05:28] it's not worth missing this opportunity
[1:05:30] tonight maybe tonight be the last
[1:05:32] opportunity you have so don't miss the
[1:05:34] opportunity to give God your allwe for
[1:05:36] we have not a high priest which cannot
[1:05:38] be touched with the feeling of our
[1:05:39] infirmities but with an all points
[1:05:41] tempted like as we are yet without sin
[1:05:45] so it said look it says he says it says
[1:05:47] in all points so what you're going
[1:05:50] through right now he can relate to you
[1:05:52] he can give you guidance he can give you
[1:05:54] strength to overcome it right but you
[1:05:56] got to let him into your heart your
[1:05:58] parents can't do it for you you got to
[1:06:01] let him into your heart cuz know your
[1:06:02] parents will love for you to serve God
[1:06:05] but they can't force you into it cuz if
[1:06:07] some brother Braham say somebody can
[1:06:08] talk you into it they can talk you out
[1:06:09] of it so you got to have the like
[1:06:11] experience I had your parents had you
[1:06:13] got to have that same type of experience
[1:06:15] because when I met God in my car I I I
[1:06:18] was changed amen I wasn't going back to
[1:06:20] the world anymore I knew what was in the
[1:06:23] world cuz I I've been in the world so I
[1:06:25] can tell you guys I experienced it for
[1:06:26] you you don't need it you don't need it
[1:06:30] you don't need it you don't need it at
[1:06:32] all I I smoking weed uh alcohol I did it
[1:06:37] wasn't worth it amen trying to impress
[1:06:39] ladies wasn't worth it all these things
[1:06:41] wasn't worth it all it did was it it C
[1:06:45] more things that I had to overcome in my
[1:06:46] life don't add extra things that you got
[1:06:48] to overcome while you're young just stay
[1:06:51] young and
[1:06:52] undefiled keep it man wave that Banner
[1:06:55] High you got to you got
[1:06:58] to got to I wish I had what you guys had
[1:07:02] tonight I wish I had somebody that would
[1:07:05] care about me and put these events and
[1:07:08] do this and my parents care about my
[1:07:09] walk with with with God I I would love
[1:07:12] to go back and have that but you know
[1:07:14] what sometimes we got to go through
[1:07:15] things for other people so I'm thankful
[1:07:17] I went through this so I can tell you
[1:07:19] ain't nothing there ain't nothing there
[1:07:23] ain't nothing there amen
[1:07:27] gory
[1:07:29] amen and so I remember too as I was as I
[1:07:32] was growing in God I remember my best
[1:07:33] friend Doug we used to you know drink
[1:07:36] together video game together and as I
[1:07:38] was as I was getting closer with God I I
[1:07:40] started to realize that our relationship
[1:07:41] was kind of just going south a little
[1:07:43] bit and I realized that there's two
[1:07:47] different spirits that are operating
[1:07:49] he's going one I'm going the other way
[1:07:50] and so I been I haven't talked to him in
[1:07:52] a long time you know every time I like
[1:07:54] kind of bring up the Lord he be like you
[1:07:56] know kind of cringe a little bit but um
[1:07:58] anyways I I look back and and this you
[1:08:01] know many friends that I you know that
[1:08:03] in the world that I lost but I'm okay
[1:08:04] with that because when God calls us to a
[1:08:08] total separation I see Abraham he
[1:08:10] probably had lots of friends and uh
[1:08:12] where he lived at but God callus a total
[1:08:14] separation because he knows those
[1:08:16] friends if you keep them in your life
[1:08:18] they going to influence you the wrong
[1:08:19] way so I tell you this be careful the
[1:08:21] friends that you have because they can
[1:08:24] influence you the wrong way
[1:08:26] because they're operating by a spirit
[1:08:27] you're operating by a spirit so I don't
[1:08:30] care how nice they are if they are
[1:08:31] influencing you away from God you don't
[1:08:33] need that friend you you don't it's not
[1:08:35] worth it it's just not worth it let's go
[1:08:38] to verse uh let's go to Proverbs 29:19
[1:08:41] where there is no vision the people
[1:08:42] perish so God has a plan for your life
[1:08:47] he has a predestinated plan for your
[1:08:49] life you could choose to follow it or
[1:08:50] not follow it and I'm so thankful that I
[1:08:52] followed his plan I didn't realiz
[1:08:55] realized that you know I had a had a
[1:08:56] desire to be a motivational speaker and
[1:08:59] and I was like I was just like why do I
[1:09:01] even try to pursue that I didn't want to
[1:09:02] be a preacher I'll be sure to honest
[1:09:04] with you I I I did not want to be a
[1:09:06] minister and and God has a funny way of
[1:09:08] doing things but it's his perfect plan
[1:09:10] amen I'll tell you a little testimony in
[1:09:12] that so um I didn't tell you this
[1:09:13] testimony before but I remember so the
[1:09:15] first time I met brother hos and brother
[1:09:17] Maris so at that time I told you I got
[1:09:19] kicked out of my house and um for for
[1:09:22] for serving God and believe the message
[1:09:24] of the hour and so I told I asked the
[1:09:27] Lord if you want me to go to the men's
[1:09:28] meeting Lord just make a way and I was
[1:09:30] so thankful that I I prayed that cuz I
[1:09:32] forgot I prayed that and God has a
[1:09:35] amazing way so brother Franco calls me
[1:09:38] and says hey Mark um I I can't go to
[1:09:40] men's meeting when go to my place I'm
[1:09:42] like no I'm good I'm like no I don't
[1:09:43] think so and I was like wait wa wait no
[1:09:45] I'll go brother Fran so and so God just
[1:09:48] opened the door and that and I thank
[1:09:49] brother Fran so I thank God for putting
[1:09:51] that in brother Fran heart to call me
[1:09:53] because I go there and I meet brother
[1:09:54] hos
[1:09:56] I meet brother I see brother Jack again
[1:09:57] cuz he came to my church and preached
[1:09:59] before I see brother Maris and little
[1:10:00] did I know that God just connects things
[1:10:03] little or know I'll be here and brother
[1:10:05] Jack be my pastor now so I look I look
[1:10:07] look back and never forget brother Paul
[1:10:09] preached this message what Sons do with
[1:10:11] authority I'll never forget that that
[1:10:13] changed me I was just like that still
[1:10:14] rings in my heart today I still remember
[1:10:16] I remember that and so I I get back um
[1:10:19] from the men's meeting just realizing
[1:10:21] just I see all these things I look back
[1:10:22] and I can see what God was doing just
[1:10:24] connecting me brother brother Maris
[1:10:27] and little did I know I would be here
[1:10:29] today preaching in spirit in the truth
[1:10:32] Tabernacle as a
[1:10:33] member I did see that and so I remember
[1:10:38] getting home and um brother John asked
[1:10:41] me to share some of the things that was
[1:10:43] spoken at men's meeting and so I was on
[1:10:45] my bed and I was like okay let me try to
[1:10:47] get these notes together and I remember
[1:10:49] I remember a voice saying I want you to
[1:10:51] preach and I'm like nah that's just me
[1:10:52] that's just me you know thinking things
[1:10:54] and then it kept getting stronger and
[1:10:56] stronger and stronger I was like okay
[1:10:57] Lord I know it's you and so I talked to
[1:10:59] Brother John I'm hat brother John um the
[1:11:02] Lord's calling me to minister he's like
[1:11:03] okay brother Mark well we got a couple
[1:11:06] meetings first and after we'll get you
[1:11:07] to we'll get you to minister I'm like
[1:11:09] huh I'm not ready he's like don't
[1:11:11] worry and then I I remember never forget
[1:11:13] I preached my first message it was um
[1:11:15] what's the most valuable currency which
[1:11:17] is time and so I just see God then just
[1:11:20] start opening doors because God didn't
[1:11:22] call me to minister until first I
[1:11:25] totally separated myself from my parents
[1:11:28] that's when God started to open doors
[1:11:30] and bless me because my blessings were
[1:11:32] being hindered because I was in a bad
[1:11:35] environment so just like when a tree is
[1:11:37] planted if it's not planted in a good
[1:11:38] environment it will not grow so God had
[1:11:41] to uproot me and put me in a place where
[1:11:45] I wasn't influenced by my my parents or
[1:11:47] my brother even though they were good
[1:11:49] good people and so I see after that
[1:11:51] moment God just started to just lead me
[1:11:55] and and and the same thing you guys you
[1:11:56] got to make sure you're putting yourself
[1:11:58] in the right environment and when I say
[1:11:59] that you got a good environment with
[1:12:01] your parents they're perfect but you got
[1:12:02] to make sure that you you you watching
[1:12:04] the right things cuz your parents can't
[1:12:06] watch every little thing you're doing so
[1:12:09] you now you got to be careful what
[1:12:10] you're watching because I know one click
[1:12:13] can destroy your life cuz it cuz it
[1:12:15] destroyed my life I can tell you one
[1:12:17] click destroyed my life and in many
[1:12:20] years it destroyed my life and so I I
[1:12:22] tell you this I'm just I'm telling you
[1:12:24] guys be careful what you watch on
[1:12:26] YouTube be careful what you post be
[1:12:28] careful who you're looking at be careful
[1:12:30] who you let influence you because what
[1:12:32] you let influence you is going to lead
[1:12:33] into your teenage years and into your
[1:12:36] adulthood amen so now I know a lot of
[1:12:39] times we're as young people were worried
[1:12:41] like what I'm going to do when going
[1:12:42] grow up what's my future going to be
[1:12:44] like what's this what's that what's that
[1:12:45] what's that and I'll tell you this the
[1:12:47] greatest thing you can do is ask Lord
[1:12:49] what do you want my future to be what do
[1:12:51] you want me to do what is your perfect
[1:12:52] plan for me and I love Jeremiah 29:11
[1:12:56] says for I know the thoughts that I
[1:12:57] think towards you sayeth the Lord
[1:13:00] thoughts of peace and not of evil to
[1:13:02] give you an expected in so the Lord know
[1:13:05] the Lord wants to bless you he wants to
[1:13:07] lead you he wants to guide you but you
[1:13:10] got to let him do these things and I
[1:13:12] love brother Jack mentioned this uh
[1:13:13] quote that brother brandom um mentioned
[1:13:15] about your future is clear so we'll read
[1:13:17] that in early spiritual experiences
[1:13:19] paragraph 56 so I was lying there one
[1:13:21] morning about 3:00 in the morning and I
[1:13:23] was thinking oh what would my future be
[1:13:26] what will my outcome be and while I was
[1:13:27] laying there I fell into a trance and
[1:13:29] here come one walking to me oh I looked
[1:13:32] at him he walked straight to me Stern he
[1:13:34] said as thou was thinking of me what
[1:13:36] your future will be he grabbed a piece
[1:13:38] of paper it was like folded them like a
[1:13:41] typewriter paper like that and he held
[1:13:44] it out like this and Stood Beside Me
[1:13:45] like that and he swirled that like that
[1:13:47] and went Plumb into the heavens and said
[1:13:49] your future is clear so I want to tell
[1:13:52] you young people if you let God in your
[1:13:55] life your future is
[1:13:58] clear so don't don't try to go make it a
[1:14:01] name for yourself let God lead and guide
[1:14:04] you because if you let him lead and
[1:14:05] guide you the prophet said your future
[1:14:08] is clear Jeremiah 9 Jeremiah 2911 says
[1:14:11] the same thing your future is clear he
[1:14:14] has plans to prosper you and give you an
[1:14:15] expected End Amen sir amen let's jump to
[1:14:19] Psalm 16 uh or Psalm
[1:14:22] 1611 thou will show me the path of life
[1:14:25] in thy presence is fullness of joy I'm
[1:14:28] me say it again in thy presence is
[1:14:31] fullness of joy see the world can bring
[1:14:33] happiness but what happiness is
[1:14:36] happiness is based upon circumstances
[1:14:38] but joy is not based upon circumstances
[1:14:41] you can have joy in a trial joy in a
[1:14:44] storm cuz when I when I kicked out my
[1:14:46] parents house I had Joy I did I was kind
[1:14:50] remember I remember when I kicked out
[1:14:51] the the first scripture the Lord brought
[1:14:52] to my mind was I didn't come to bring
[1:14:54] priests by I came to bring a sword I
[1:14:56] came to bring a man variance against his
[1:14:58] dad and etc etc etc so I remember that
[1:15:00] and that just brought me great that gave
[1:15:01] me peace when he spoke that to me that
[1:15:04] gave me peace I went my Bible and I was
[1:15:05] like Wow and that gave me peace cuz I
[1:15:08] wasn't willing I told you guys before
[1:15:10] that when I made that decision my
[1:15:11] relationship with my dad is closer than
[1:15:14] it's ever been because I made that
[1:15:15] decision amen and and so I'm I'm
[1:15:19] thankful I made that decision because
[1:15:20] that's that's why I'm here tonight
[1:15:22] because God gave me that decision I
[1:15:23] could have made a decision to stay but
[1:15:25] it wouldn't done me no good so I'm so
[1:15:27] thankful that that uh that I had that I
[1:15:29] had a personal experience with God God a
[1:15:32] ceiling a sealing away with God because
[1:15:35] there's a lot of things I could tell you
[1:15:36] I went through with my mom and all these
[1:15:38] things and only reason why I'm here
[1:15:39] today to to overcome those things
[1:15:41] because of God he he held me he he's my
[1:15:44] anchor amen amen so let's go to um let's
[1:15:48] go to acts so let's talk about the how
[1:15:50] he changes
[1:15:51] us I look at Peter we look at Peter take
[1:15:54] we got a couple more minutes I look at
[1:15:55] Peter look at his life before he got
[1:15:57] converted and filled away he he denied
[1:16:00] Jesus Christ he cursed but but when he
[1:16:05] received acts 238 so let's go to acts 1
[1:16:08] 18 but you shall receive power after
[1:16:10] that the Holy Ghost has come upon you
[1:16:13] you shall be Witnesses unto me both in
[1:16:14] Jerusalem in all Judea and in Samaria
[1:16:17] and he unto the uttermost parts of the
[1:16:19] earth now when Peter received that Peter
[1:16:22] was not the same anymore he wasn't the
[1:16:24] same same Peter that was running away
[1:16:26] but now he's running into Christ and so
[1:16:29] the same thing is you need the Holy
[1:16:31] Ghost you can try to be a good person
[1:16:33] but that's not good enough there's a lot
[1:16:34] of good people that going to hell
[1:16:36] there's there's a lot of Muslims who
[1:16:38] have better um better morals in the half
[1:16:41] of the United States has that's right
[1:16:43] but but God isn't looking for people who
[1:16:45] just have good morals he's coming back
[1:16:47] for his Spirit he looking for looking
[1:16:49] for the spirit inside of him that's what
[1:16:50] he's looking for and so I tell you
[1:16:51] tonight is don't just try to be a good
[1:16:53] person don't try to be good moral person
[1:16:56] but have a personal experience have a
[1:16:58] personal experience and don't just stop
[1:16:59] at one personal experience have
[1:17:02] multiple you got to have multiple cuz
[1:17:04] there's a lot of there's a lot of people
[1:17:05] who have a personal experience that turn
[1:17:07] away from God I'll give you one Judas
[1:17:10] isar right Judas iscar saw Jesus heal he
[1:17:14] he saw Jesus do all these Miracles the
[1:17:16] loaves of fishes all these things but
[1:17:18] where is he at today yeah exactly so you
[1:17:21] can't just stop at one personal
[1:17:23] experience amen cuz he went to
[1:17:25] sanctification he went to justification
[1:17:26] sanctification but he never went to get
[1:17:28] filled with the Holy Ghost so you got to
[1:17:31] go past
[1:17:33] justification because even the Bible
[1:17:35] says this that uh this man his his house
[1:17:37] was swept and garnished but he never got
[1:17:39] filled and guess what happened seven
[1:17:41] other Spirits came back worse so I tell
[1:17:43] you this don't just stop a
[1:17:45] sanctification a lot of people stop
[1:17:47] there and they miss it and they go back
[1:17:49] into the world go to the full be sealed
[1:17:52] until the day of your Redemption as Paul
[1:17:54] said yeah amen amen let's go to um let's
[1:17:58] go to 1 Timothy
[1:17:59] 4:2 so young people start building a
[1:18:02] strong Foundation today you're never too
[1:18:05] strong to build a strong pray prayer
[1:18:06] life you're never too young to seek the
[1:18:09] Lord with all your heart you're never
[1:18:10] too young to dedicate your life to God
[1:18:12] in fact you can dedicate your life right
[1:18:14] now in your heart to God right now amen
[1:18:16] let's go to 1 Timothy 4:12 let no man
[1:18:19] despise thy youth I I see all these
[1:18:21] young people playing the instruments and
[1:18:23] all these things um sound back there it
[1:18:26] brings joy in my heart so don't let
[1:18:28] anybody despise your youth keep serving
[1:18:30] God with all your heart in fact this a
[1:18:31] beautiful time to start serving cuz it's
[1:18:33] going to carry over and you can teach
[1:18:35] somebody else how to do that and other
[1:18:37] people see how you're living and you
[1:18:39] going be an example to them yes amen so
[1:18:41] let no man despise that youth be but be
[1:18:43] thou an example of Believers in the word
[1:18:45] in the word in conversation in charity
[1:18:48] in spirit in faith and Purity and we'll
[1:18:50] just close here with a with a quote and
[1:18:53] if you got something in your heart for
[1:18:54] God and you won't express it and so
[1:18:56] forth and just keep putting it off well
[1:18:58] later and later on that little desire
[1:19:00] that you once had to serve God will be
[1:19:02] taken from you the devil will come in
[1:19:04] and steal that away and then you won't
[1:19:06] have any desire to serve him I'm telling
[1:19:08] you tonight don't brush that desire off
[1:19:11] God is calling right now don't keep
[1:19:13] brushing it off that last brush might be
[1:19:15] too late I told you that year in 2017 I
[1:19:18] just knew in my heart that if I didn't
[1:19:20] give my life to God that year I just I
[1:19:22] just knew they' be the last time he
[1:19:23] called me I just I just felt it in my
[1:19:25] heart if I did this is the last chance I
[1:19:27] had because I brushed it off over and
[1:19:29] over again I went into the world went
[1:19:31] back out went into the world back out
[1:19:33] and and you can't keep playing with God
[1:19:36] you can't keep playing with God Amen so
[1:19:39] so if you have that least desire there
[1:19:42] must be something that even brought you
[1:19:43] to this breakfast this morning or
[1:19:45] something to this youth service this
[1:19:47] tonight Faith cometh by hearing and
[1:19:49] hearing of the word and there must be
[1:19:51] some desire or you wouldn't even be here
[1:19:53] now don't let that desire Trinkle off
[1:19:55] into some little joint or shaking in
[1:19:57] hands or being sprinkled or something
[1:19:58] out there let's find the real firm
[1:20:01] that's established that something that's
[1:20:03] really all right and just in closing you
[1:20:06] have an opportunity life has been
[1:20:08] presented to us tonight we can either
[1:20:10] take it life or take death so like I
[1:20:13] said there may be some here tonight that
[1:20:14] might be on the fence you may not want
[1:20:15] to be a Christian but I tell you this

[1:21:24] short term parents looking at long term
[1:21:27] they're going to say like if you make
[1:21:28] this decision this is going to happen to
[1:21:30] you they can see into the future because

[1:22:01] right so this en close and give God a
[1:22:02] chance sir I promise you if you really
[1:22:05] seek God and say Lord make yourself real
[1:22:07] to me he will make yourself real to you
[1:22:09] cuz he made himself real to me and God
[1:22:11] is not a respector of persons I will
[1:22:13] tell you that and I'll tell you this
[1:22:14] that's the best decision I ever made in
[1:22:16] my life in that car it's a 2010 Jeep
[1:22:19] Patriot stick shift never forget it
[1:22:22] never forget that day and and so I many
[1:22:24] times I go back to that day and just
[1:22:26] remind myself what God did to me in that
[1:22:27] car that day and it it just it it it
[1:22:30] changed me and that's why I I said
[1:22:32] that's why I'm here today and I'm
[1:22:33] thankful that that God called me one
[1:22:36] more time one more time he called me and
[1:22:38] I'm thankful for that I'm thankful I
[1:22:40] heed to that call because he's taking me
[1:22:42] like for instance I would never would
[1:22:44] ever guessed in my life that I would be
[1:22:47] going to Puerto Rico to have an
[1:22:49] opportunity to minister or going to uh
[1:22:51] to Mexico in Peru next year I never
[1:22:53] would in a million years is ever imagine
[1:22:55] doing that and and so I I see God just
[1:22:59] opening doors cuz I told one thing I
[1:23:01] remember I telling the Lord I asked the
[1:23:03] Lord I was like Lord um this is your
[1:23:05] gift this you you've given me this gift
[1:23:07] it's yours I'm giving it back to you so
[1:23:09] Lord if you want me to go preach
[1:23:10] somewhere Lord you open the door and so
[1:23:13] I don't I don't force myself I don't say
[1:23:14] hey I'm a minister I don't I say Lord if
[1:23:17] you want me to go somewhere Lord you'll
[1:23:18] open that door and God's been opening
[1:23:20] doors and I'm thankful for that even at
[1:23:23] work God's been opening doors to talk
[1:23:24] with people you know about him and I
[1:23:26] just see the like one of my friends at
[1:23:28] work is funny cuz I listen to gospel at
[1:23:30] work I be blasting gospel we we can
[1:23:32] blast music they be blasting all this
[1:23:34] heavy metal and rock and all that stuff
[1:23:35] why can't I blast my music huh why can't
[1:23:38] I blast my music and so people make fun
[1:23:41] of me sometimes that's okay but this one
[1:23:42] person at my job her name is Vanessa
[1:23:44] keep her in prayer but um it's funny
[1:23:46] because I start listening to it she now
[1:23:48] listen to on her own now and she started
[1:23:50] asking questions like like deep
[1:23:52] questions about about the Bible and
[1:23:54] about the Lord and I to see the Lord
[1:23:55] just like slowly working on her and
[1:23:57] everything so I see cuz she listen to
[1:23:59] like I I love um old school like um I
[1:24:03] can't think of his name Kurt Franklin
[1:24:05] that's the best and and many other songs
[1:24:07] and I got I heard her listening one day
[1:24:08] I'm like you listen to Kurt Franklin I
[1:24:10] was like what you listening to I I even
[1:24:13] got her I even got her I sent her a live
[1:24:15] live link to the um night of worship and
[1:24:17] she watched that so I I just see God
[1:24:19] just moving you know K told the Lord
[1:24:21] even if it's one Soul at Costco Lord
[1:24:23] even one Soul one soul and so I'm just
[1:24:27] thankful for God just for the
[1:24:29] opportunity um because like I said I
[1:24:31] wouldn't be here tonight it wasn't for
[1:24:33] God you know just the person I used to
[1:24:35] be you know I thought I was a good
[1:24:36] person I remember many time remember the
[1:24:38] devil even told me you're going to hell
[1:24:39] and then but but God said no he said no
[1:24:43] and so I'm so thankful that I listen to
[1:24:45] that voice and I can just see God just
[1:24:47] protecting me in my life from certain
[1:24:49] things even where I should have been
[1:24:51] destroyed God his tender hand of grace
[1:24:52] and mercy even when I was in and wrong
[1:24:54] he still loved me and protected me from
[1:24:56] Rolling in my life so let's just close

[1:26:21] [Applause]
[1:26:27] [Music]
[1:26:33] bless praise the
[1:26:36] Lord I appreciate brother Mark on
[1:26:40] tonight uh
[1:26:44] amen
[1:26:47] amen
[1:26:48] um I um I have to say that it's not easy
[1:26:54] sometimes to stand and give your your
[1:26:57] testimony um to others you know you just
[1:27:01] cuz you make yourself vulnerable uh when
[1:27:03] you're sharing you know just things that
[1:27:05] the Lord has brought you through but I
[1:27:07] think on um Wednesday night kind of at
[1:27:11] the close and even through brother um
[1:27:13] whisper sermon was talking about how
[1:27:17] um uh Elizabeth had to go through
[1:27:21] something so it' be an encouragement for
[1:27:23] Mar
[1:27:25] right and um and we all have to go
[1:27:27] through something to be an encouragement
[1:27:29] to somebody else so I think that was a a
[1:27:32] statement that probably brought some
[1:27:34] freedom to brother Mark just to kind of
[1:27:36] come and just share his heart uh and you
[1:27:39] know as as he was say and I can tell you
[1:27:41] he's not the only one in this room that
[1:27:44] has things that he had to overcome I
[1:27:47] could tell you things that I had to
[1:27:49] overcome sometimes you look at you know
[1:27:51] the the the ministers behind the pull
[1:27:52] pit or anybody that's standing here
[1:27:54] behind the pulpit and you just thinking
[1:27:56] oh they've been holy all their life no
[1:27:58] we were all born in sin we were shaped
[1:28:01] in iniquity come into the world speaking
[1:28:03] lies and we had something to overcome
[1:28:06] and and each one of us amen had to come
[1:28:08] to a spot where we decided to make
[1:28:13] Jesus our
[1:28:15] choice amen I'm going to serve you Lord
[1:28:18] I'm G to follow you I'm going to live
[1:28:20] for you and and and and I'm going tell
[1:28:23] you um
[1:28:24] uh if your worldly friends don't feel a
[1:28:28] little bit uncomfortable with you
[1:28:30] something is wrong
[1:28:33] somewhere amen because you should have
[1:28:35] so much light on the inside of you that
[1:28:37] it shines up all their darkness and uh
[1:28:40] and they should run from you because of
[1:28:42] all that light right but uh but if they
