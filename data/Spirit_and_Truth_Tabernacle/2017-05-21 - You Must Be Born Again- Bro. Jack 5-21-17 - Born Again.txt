we had a wonderful time with the youth on last night it was a real real real pleasant blessing and something that I was suddenly young people last night that I'm looking to do a man a little bit more this year it was just brought to my attention that we need to do this a little bit more and you know I said you know I'm just trying to figure out ways to you know we got so much on our schedule and and you know just brand do it and the Lord just kind of begin to show this little things that we could do here and there but it's just an opportunity what my what my vision is but we will be doing another one in July and then another one in September we'll give you the dates and everything I'll and I think it's going to be the third weekend in July and also the third weekend in September if I'm not mistaken but we'll be doing our special youth fellowship type of events and our hope and our goal is not only to just get our youth but even so I'm going to use that used to attend this church I still got them on the list right what I'm going in putting all y'all information in the database let me while I'm there I ain't got everybody card back there by supposed to give me a card back oh no

connection card make sure you do that don't don't leave the day without doing that get it back to my wife I've been entered all the information to the database it's getting real real good not I lost my fault I'm trying to get it back okay so my objective is even you know some of the young people that I might not see them here every Sunday but I still call them active members in this church I'd say that by Fetty I call you an active member you can't go nowhere you don't ride you know where home is right so so we call them active members and what we're what we're looking to do sometimes you can't get people to come to church but you can get into fellowship and if we create a right environment in a fellowship the next thing you know you'd be whipping them right back to church you got to get them in for me and surround us and you can have good Holy Ghost clean fun you can do that and you know a member when we're doing this we're parents want you to know we're including you know even the little ones we want them growing up in these environments right we want them we'll have things for them to do and but uh but we got something you know that we want to do we got two more times this year that I know that a plan we also mentioned to the young people there would be opportunities we're looking at doing a man a possibly make look for the young people and and then also we have you know a little something that we we heard about when we were in Africa a couple years ago we were in Ghana and it had some young people do like a debate and they took a little subject and they debated you know that the subject that they had to use scriptures and quotes and they got points based on based on what they use to support their position though but I something that we want to just kind of bring up nothing and we don't want to get too out of control praise the Lord but but something then just kind of just just make it a little fun for the young people here and there and I will be bringing that you know bringing more that to you in the future but I want you to put it on your calendar and I want you to when we have these things invite your loved ones amen to come and be a part of these things they meant it even if they you know like well you know they've been to church a long time they let them come get them get them on out here get them on out here we want them to be a

us and no matter what it is that we're going through we've learned as Christians to still bring our priests the Bible tells us that you inhabit the praises of your people so when we find ourselves in dire straits if we could just find the way just to give you glory to give you honor to give you praise then that's where we'll find our God dwelling I pray father that you would just give us strength

hand of praise Thank You musicians certainly appreciate you all man and if you all would get your Bibles and stand with me we'll read a portion of Scripture out of the book of John chapter 3 a man praise the Lord John chapter 3 and starting here verse 1 John 3 starting at verse 1 says there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from God for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except God be with him jesus answered and said unto Him verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God and Nicodemus said to him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born jesus answered verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit Marvel not that I said unto thee ye must be born again a man the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated and man here today and we want to take our subject amen our title from the words of Jesus ye must be born again amen you must be born again I this topic had come upon my heart some time ago and I had a little I preached this respect it was my mind I want to say my first sermon that I preached when I was invited out side to go preach I went to church Stan Riviera Beach and my cousin was pastoring he invited me to come preach and you know and I went in and I said I took this topic and he must be born again and we had a wonderful time but you know after I preached the sermon I went home and as I was home I just felt all this weight you know on my shoulders and I just could not understand what was really transpiring eyes man I just I don't know if I said something wrong if I did something wrong I had no idea what it was so I called my cousin back I said you know I want to apologize if I said something in the pulpit that was wrong this morning then please forget me because I'm just not feeling you know something just don't feel right I don't know what it is and they say oh you're just the young preacher you got apologized to nothing at the Bible say you know if the Bible said then we all say Amen till you apologize and letting in the scripture and I tell you what when he told me that iron follows and nobody but nothing in the Bible cuz I ain't put it there Amen I'm just repeating what Jesus said and he said you must a man be born again and then that that applies to everybody in here right from the pulpit to the back though we all got this requirement that we must be born again and and I just want to just try to deal with that but you know I found out later on what that weight was it was a weight of the people a man that uh that the Lord had allowed us to kind of feel that we'd be carrying the weight and the burdens of the people you know so we thank God for that he just kind of kind of brought us through that for a little bit but I want to talk about this on today the other other of the prophet preached on this sermon you must be born again but at the beginning of the sermon he did something and he told the people say go home and read Ephesians go home and read Ephesians chapter 4 and a few verses there so you know we're gonna read that this morning as we get started just turn with me to Ephesians chapter 4 praise the Lord and remember our topic is you must be born again and must be must be there is no way around it a man this is this is a requirement from God of that each one has to a man meet and the other thing about this requirement many churches you go to and you hear them preach this sermon and everybody got their own definitions that's the hot a field this applies or what they think it means you know what does it really mean to be born again right and now and we want to try that we want to try to give it from a scriptural standpoint what this really means a man to be born again because this something that everybody got to come to oh hallelujah glory to God I mean the other thing I want you to understand about this this dis dis this statement this is Jesus first doctrine right this is his first doctrine when you read the book of John and you know in John just kind of laying out what happened in the beginning there in John 1 and then John to Jesus turning the water into wine and beat some people out the temple and things like that but when he opened up his mouth and began to preach the first thing come out as ye must be born again his first doctrine right and so Jesus is gonna say something like that we better take heed to what Jesus trying to tell us he must no no no no no if ands buts no shortcuts it is it's absolutely impossible for you to go to heaven if you not born again oh my god Amen we got we got to get this thing right yes I you know I was I was I'm coming here he feeders for but the Lord was all sharing me is people going to church every day and they dive and going the hell going to church right in the church the Advanta going to hell the reason is because they have not come to this place where they've been born again the reason you see all kind of pumps and things like that in life because that person has not come to a complete death oh yeah they religious we got that people people know how to do the part but we've not talked about being religious we talked about being born again come on it's gonna take a new verse hallelujah God ain't happy just with people just going to charge God want to birth a man there's got to be a new nature comes alive inside of people we talk about being born again let's let's read this Ephesians 4 he picked this up and they start reading at verse 11 it says that he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers and man this is what God did he gave apostles he gave prophets he gave evangelists he gave pastors who gave teachers now now when God you know let me just put it this way there's a lot of people that a man went but not everybody was sent so it's a lot of folks you hear on the radio preached by God and call their people to preach amen hallelujah we might as well just be on it's a lot of tests got up and went but God did not send them people but when he gave you an apostle when he get oh my god they may not somebody making themselves an apostle right not somebody making themselves a pastor a teacher or anything though you can't make yourself this God got to send you got got some night you to be this and when he ignored you to be that he has a purpose for doing it and that purpose is found in verse 12 for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ verse 13 goes on also say to we all come into the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ who are going to church it's not going to be good enough God is trying to bring us to a place of perfection in him and the ministry is supposed to help you get there I'm going on verse 14 this also is further when it when it gives you a pastor gives you a property gives you an evangelist he gives you you know a teacher he gives you that said that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men hallelujah and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive hallelujah but speaking the truth in love may grow up and I'm turning into him and all things which is the head even Christ now you know the Prophet just used this this description saying I go home and look at it but he kept making a few points there when I went back and listened to the sermon you must be born again he said now notice the Paul says that we have to grow up into him because what happened that people come to the Lord and they think they grow soon as they come oh my god amen but but you got to grow up hallelujah you I mean when Pete Wentz when children are born they're born babies not born man let me say it again when children are naturally born they are born babies and not man so when they're pennette pennette we're born and baby those feelings reading and staying here recently and it was a you know man what's up I he had a little oh nice and he had in his arms and he was just huge a Gaga and googoo women and just smiling and and he looked at Infeld man man she's so sweet daddy look at how sweet this girl is I just I just I just really love my little niece here where he said all that he had glasses on and the girl grabbed ahold of his glasses snatched them off and when she got him off before he could grab a seat on drop them on the ground and they done broke right and the athlete I said oh yeah she was so sweet she was so distant she was so back now he want a spanker but his daddy told you'll need to spank her for that because she didn't know no better Oh hallelujah when you're a baby you know mama baby you might not get no spanking but we do know better huh when you know better till we get you back better Oh y'all leave me they don't hear that because you'll know no better praise the Lord so some of y'all this morning is we talking to some babies but suddenly a grown folk grown folk some y'all teenagers in the gospel and this word gonna hit you in different places but it need they hit you right where you ask amen and no matter where you act on the journey you still got to be born again a baby got to be born again teenagers got to be born again an adult got any phone again everybody got to be pulling again all right now stay with me so you know he was saying that people are you know people come to the church and they go through an experience where they go to the alternate accept Christ or maybe they lift their hands and accept Christ and that's good that's not that's the beginning that's not the end just because you lift your hands to accept Christ that mean God put something in your heart where you can respond to the word but after you've responded to the word now there's some growing up to do hello somebody if I got a little babies amen and I don't mind Tok them at you know as a toddler but eventually start putting on weight amen and then lands get big enough where they can walk early on and you got to watch a baby because if you and you don't train that baby right that baby will always be trying to be

church you get heavy we can't carry you like that you gonna have to carry yourself that baby got a lot of PD until mommy go spend their feet a lot not just reading something did you get overlooked where you can cook for yourself you ain't just get the meal when you're coming on Sunday morning how about you go grab and eat yourself you don't read your Holy Bible you don't do no Bible study let me please I'll take I just wait for the first body hallelujah you gotta be born again you got to grow up then you see a child and growing up yet I'm like wait a minute here I mean here you want me to

you're nice and healthy child we want you to develop the way you supposed to the villain yeah right and that's in every aspect of life whether it's walking whether it's talking with us you know eating whatever it is you want to see that child develop in every aspect of their life same thing applies spiritually it's not just when you when you when you when you say Lord I accept into my heart that's the beginning but last time to grow up and as you grow up guess what some things fall off you amen they're things I've done fall off you because you growing up hallelujah and we all we got rebellious kids everybody done with and you've been a rebellious kid right I mean you got things to go through where you begin to rebel against the Word of God but number I mean a parent that's dealing with a rebellious child that parenting them going to be where too much that parents going to establish alone and it's going to be this way I'm no way and when you come if you want to leave the house leave the house I don't care but when you come back guess what the love ain't change it's the same thing with God you want to repel against gonna do some difference with you perfect the Word of God is building out of God hello somebody Amen that you got to be born again you got to be here we see this with with Nicodemus here he comes to the Lord Jesus you know at night you don't want nobody to know that he coming so he sneaks in there but the good thing about it he got there right where he had to sneak to get there or whatever it took but Nicodemus got into the presence of the Lord Jesus because Jesus was the only person that could give him light in the midst of its darkness a man and you know here here here here Jesus tell us thing now you know you got to be born again he said and I just love the way these words to put here in the scripture in verse 3 he said there and you know let me just work with it just a little bit here from the scripture verse 2 it says John 3 it says that the same came to Jesus by night and said to him rabbi we know that thou art a teacher from God for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except God be with him now III think Jesus appreciates these words that Nicodemus is saying a man and and oftentimes even me as a minister you know people would come say pastor I really enjoyed that and pastor I really thank God for you and pastor a pastor you know and and all that's great but you know what amen I can't be moved by flattery Jesus could not be moved by flattery right I mean it's nothing wrong with saying a good compliment up to somebody people enjoy hearing good compliment but if you use that compliment try to to try to butter up if you're using that compliment to try to you know uh I mean just maybe maybe I'm a sadist because if I said this way to him then maybe they let me get by with this not another gospel still the gospel the gospel the gospel my house your house everybody has the guys were super gospel I mean the guys for my wife be the guys for my children either gospel my momma my brother my sisters all of us be the gospel ain't no buttering up when they come in I mean can you Jesus here is this great leader Nicodemus been a greatly speaker we know you a teacher I tell them what they're talking about we know that your teachers that come from God nobody could do miracles like you Jesus oh no no no that don't mean nothing to me what you just said at night look at what he tell them verse 3 Jesus answer sent the barely better which means absolutely absolutely right he says I send to thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God now this man was religious but what I want to understand God is not calling for religion he was relationship my religion relationship right and and we got it we got a week we gotta be willing to give him that and like I just said earlier you know Church I'll be careful you know you gotta give people you see them Jeff coming to church give them chance to grow you gotta let people grow they supposed to grow up and you're supposed to be able to watch that just just spot forward amen it ain't gonna happen overnight I had a you know I was telling a couple people this and I would tell saying that when you grow it's a way to grow amen when you grow grow like a oak tree but not like a mushroom because both of them grow all three girls and a mushroom girls both of them will grow the same ring will make both of them grow but the problem is the mushroom it come up overnight in his kick down just like that it ain't got no real roots I mean a lot more go over the top of that that mushroom is done but you try to take your lump against a big old oak tree your lawnmower be done we want Christians to be like Oh trees rooted and grounded in piloting gods but you got to get people time to grow not not no 1 week 2 week no no give them time to grow praise the Lord hallelujah glory to God and when they're really in the presence of God they can grow you know I mean their growth don't take 40 years it can be a little faster I know some of y'all already think my brother Jack what about in in Moses day when they put the branch inside the from the warden overnight it blossom that was a miracle just to prove who God was with but that ain't no way he want Christians growing overnight hallelujah all right you got to be born again barely realized anything except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God so it's impossible for you to see the kingdom god amen if you haven't been born again now let me go a little further with that so Nicodemus said to him how can a man be born now he's trying to figure this out you know what you mean Jesus by being born again how is this right I mean you know your stand being born again that a man can't even go to heaven without being born again this is that's that's a very hard statement as avera I mean but it's the truth it's what Jesus saying you have to be born again y'all just work with me here work with me see so Nicodemus said to him how can a man be born when he is old because and what brother Brahim saying Nicodemus come maybe about 80 years old to Jesus can you imagine man 80 years old and Jesus Hope says you got to be born again now wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute I have never heard of anybody talking anything like this born again born again how does this work here Jesus come so you got you got to be born again so nobody can even enter can't even see the kingdom of God can't even see it unless you're born again Nicodemus said to him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into the mother's womb and be born so he's trying to figure it out Jesus goes on to explain a little bit more verse 5 said Jesus was barely barely out sanity except a man be born of water and of spirit he cannot enter to the kingdom of God see that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit so to be born of the water and of the Spirit now what so when when we talk about being born the water is talking back to natural birth right and this is the way I'm you coming out of the womb and you're born one way now now the other thing you need understand by - the natural birth there's certain characteristics that go with your natural birth there's certain genes that come hallelujah amen you can't help but I mean you might you might try your best not to look like a certain parent you might get upset when people tell you that you look like a certain parent but because that gene is there it's going to dominate your life and you cannot separate yourself from that parent and then there's blood that that that attaches you two together holla I don't care how much you want to disassociate yourself there's something there that gonna keep you connected Nautilus now I just want to kind of work with that just a little bit if I can oh god help me help me here you know um because I'm you know the thing about being born again is that you know here you can you can you can the reasons you say now you hear you you can be born of the flesh that's your natural birth I mean here he say you say born of the water that's your natural birth but when you born of the spirit now that's a spiritual birth that's the Holy Ghost birth that's the changing up your entire nature and then when the spirit comes in you stop making excuses that my people always been this way see but just by you being born from a certain uh lineage or into a certain family certain time there's certain things that certain characteristics that just well with their family my god some families everybody drinkers everybody smokers everybody got these wrong I mean everybody got that and you want to say well whether I get this this desire for it is something that came in you at your birth hallelujah not only just because of the family opponent because she was born in seeing you had that desire to sin but that's why Jesus would say you got to be born again it takes the desire away and that's what you're waiting to see people grow up into are you grown up to a place where that desire is dead you see if people nature don't change what happened that they come to church they make a confession and then they go right back out and keep doing the same thing was doing Oh hallelujah brother branham talk about the pig and how you put a you know a let's answer a female Pig and here you know you say I'm going to take this pig out this pin and I'm going to dress this pig up and I'm going make this pig act like a lamb and hear the pig come out and you put a nice dress on it some nice perfume on it and say now you go out there and be like the Lambs as soon as you let the pig go hallelujah Lucy let the pickle the pig will not go fellowship with the lambs the pig will go right on back over that to the hog slop with that dress on with that perfume on the pig will go right back into that fat pimp in and just have some fellowship but if you want to pick the act like a lamp did some nature on the inside of the pig has to change the lamb nature save it or act like a live look like a pig but acting like a lamb because the nature has changed and when God comes in and gives you a new spirit a man not just a new spirit but gives you a new heart and then puts his spirit in there then you then we work with something then we work with let me say I give you a new heart I'll give you a new spirit that imma put my spirit in there when that process takes place being that's when we talk about being born again if you if you just if you just make a confession and I mean that I'm just oh my god just been baptized in water but still doing the same old thing that they was doing before they got that time it shows that there was no real birth the Holy Spirit never really came in yeah you look look it's not nobody judging you you judge yourself your actions I mean you know you tell you I'm an orange tree emotions but we see apples you can keep saying you're sure all you want to we know what we see your apple tree and ain't nobody gonna argue with you Alleluia I want you to understand you know there's there are certain things that that kind of come along with this because of your birth just I mean you'll steal sinner because he was born one all of us was born sinners we read the scriptures morning all have sinned and come short of the glory of God everybody in here everybody at Kent King one person point they forgot another ones where you were sitting I am no I don't care how bad your sin is your sin will take you to hell lying will take you to hell just like murder right so I mean you ain't no ain't no degrees to sin we do that we do that here in our in our society you know because we want to put these people in this part of the prison and these people own hell and got sections in it it don't I'm just being honest with you if you plan on going brother Brando made a statement and I love the way you put a say there's not a person in here that wants to go to torment and I just thought about that how many how many in here actually wanna go to hell so come on lift your hand high you really want to go ain't nobody put their hand up stop stop living that weight in stop living that way and stop acting that way if you really don't want to go I think the reason we come to church because we want to get right and we try to playing games that fake churches that ain't tell us how to get right huh it is we might as well tell the true church glory to God it's only the truth I'll make people free Jesus said you must be born again so see your your your your your first birth right your natural birth that you came to this earth with you know that I mean that brought certain things it brought the line it brought the cheating they brought the stealing you know you can you know you can grow up so innocent in an environment but if around you as all this seeing you know what any many auctions attest to this you if you grew up an environment everybody drinking when you get old enough you're going to be doing the same thing they doing even even if you go to church and you back try the first thing you do is go back to that old nature that you were born in oh my hallelujah you go back to that all nature because that's what your people did the only thing that separates you from them the reason that you can go amongst in there and not feel the same way that they feel because a bird has taken plate but she has people growing up you want to see how to respond when they get back amongst a family Oh glory to God because family members oh my most of God has got got involved with something because a family member introduced it to us a family member did it family members will bring drugs to you family members will bring alcohol to you family members in their in you trust them I know nowadays the world is crazy I'ma be honest the world is crazy people do all kind of crazy stuff with people they need to never met one time in a life they still doing so that's that's crazy to me but for the average person you ain't just gonna meet somebody off the street Lee offer you any man you want to hit from this I don't know you like that well you ain't gonna take it from them but let a family member I close friend do it you'll be right there all over it and that was the devil annoyed to them to get to you let's see when you grow up you can look that thing in eyes and said no no no no no no no no I don't do that number and the reason you can say I don't do it no more because I had a new purse see the new birth is an experience I mean it's a real experience that God does something on the inside of you and what happens when the birth happens on when it truly happens on the inside what what what happened is that you become like a dove you begin to take on the nature see when John saw the Spirit come down like a dove on Christ that same nature wants to come in you and when when you got true dumb nature on the inside of you I love don't have to take the bath a bath don't have to go wash itself the dog has something inside that washes it outside hallelujah somebody and when you really got holy spirit of nature it will it will it will be an experience on the inside that will reflect itself on the outside I'm going I'm going on absolutely absolutely you got to be born again not just reciting a prayer not a Crete but it's a it's an experience that you got to have with God and see the new birth goes beyond your good intentions you know some people have got good intentions they just want to be church members can I go a little further than that some people even go further and just be in church minutes they were painting tithes and offerings to the church they will support the church but they won't get right with the Word of God God don't want you to do that why why come that father come that close the truth and don't go all the way with y'all gonna let me preach alright I got a couple of things I wanted to share here let me let me read something out of a hidden life with Christ's hidden life with Christ praise the Lord since this the Bible said that he would give us a new heart and he would give us a new spirit and many people even Pentecostal people in full gospel people has been deceived in that many times God said I'll give you a new spirit that wasn't his spirit right the new spirit wasn't his spirit that's your spirit right so when you say I'll give you a new heart and I'll give you a new spirit that's that's your spirit right it says I then I'll put my spirit in you I'll give you a new spirit then I will put my spirit in you and many times you get the new spirit and think you got the holy spirit and trusting upon emotions and signs and things when your life doesn't give you up to that now that's just a little role but remember is the truth many people the spirit the new spirit God God had to give you a new spirit to get along with his spirit well some people so mean in church some people saw me they can't even get along with themselves that's bad when you don't want to hang with your own style that's bad they're so mean they can't even get along with themselves all right let me go he says let alone with God if he come in so you won't even be able to agree with God that's right so doubtful and up and down God has to give you a new spirit gives you a new nature so you can get along with his spirit when it comes a man I hope you see it God gives you a new spirit for yourself and then puts his Holy Spirit in there amen to dwell with you and to abide with you now um there's a you know I was as I was just listening to the sermon here on you must be born again you know the Prophet just kind of went on to share some things it started say how it's the pastor's duty to make sure that the flock is staying right right you know sometimes as a pastor you'll see little things you see this you see that and you just kind of okay up say nothing start just praying for the people but I found out as being pastors that people will not make change unless you say thanks from the pulpit and that's a shame that you just can't reads out of the word for yourself and say Lord I'm aligned up with that but the pastor gotta actually say things from the pulpit to help people get in line amen right so you know up and your life makes me do that I want you to get that your life what you do with your life makes me come up here and say certain things I just want to come up here and preach for some time I got to stop and preach message like this because our life is backsliding it's back fine I mean going to church every day yeah I know but still backsliding hallelujah you might not look like everybody else in the world but you so act like them a man church and I should say we act like them oh my car when the last time you went less amount of Christ at the water cooler but when you last let me talk by the football game of the water cooler basketball at the water cooler huh but she let nobody to Jesus hey man y'all think we're gonna be in heaven talkin about yeah what'd y'all think we're gonna talk about three portland's and touchdowns and all not even going to happen Church that's not where heaven gonna be like right I mean we got to die to that at some point in time all right I'm going on that's part of my nature my nature's I like sports I love it I played it I love sports but I know the devil want to use that against me ain't no by the truth Church I'm gonna read a scripture for you in a little bit the devil want to use that against you oh my god y'all level impiously seen the news different parents that be at games and they beat up the referee y'all heard these type of a may be over in South South America a referee calling a soccer game and he make one o lunch that man missed that call it they caught the man at a bar the fans caught him at a bar you the one that was resting tonight beat the man two up off kill them fans that's what you call a fanatics that you kill people over over your team loses that's what is ever want to take it to a man churches ain't number the truth you fight people over your team I want to tell you off something that just happened to me recently I was I was in the I had to get my car repaired without repair but a new radio put in and then I went to the radio I went to the repair shop that where they're going to do to replace a radio and I'm sitting there and I was the only one in the waiting room and they had the TV going and it was just this you know like sports thing that they were showing and I was you know I'm just sitting there and and these guys were just talking about different subjects but when they talk when they talk they fuss and argue so hard it's a spirit behind it and as there was I was trying to read you know just something like spiritual I couldn't even read because of these two guys talking on the TV the way that they was talking and in my day in my day it used to be people didn't curse on this regular television you had to get a special channel to get the curstyn I guess y'all some of y'all ain't been in my day you had to have a special channel to go to the cursing now just whatever channel is cursing this cursing and now we don't we don't classify curse words well that's not really Kurt no that's Kirsten and if you if you if you're if you're Harry step up on your neck when you hear it you need to be born again so these guys are gone they just going and and when I'm his name was Stephen a Smith I want to say that it's particularly cuz I know some of y'all listen to Steven Eastman Steve Naismith start cursing and that don't y'all act like they're the first time y'all know that man curse when he with me what's this other radio personality that people be listening to not sports guy but Tom Joyner Stern you name them name them all that be on your radio curse them you just be sitting there just eating it up now you wouldn't let nobody come in your house and talk like that so you got to watch what you feed known well you just got it turned up but soon as the pastor call you turning your radio down you need to be born again somehow to get in the car with you let me change the radio station hello somebody we talking real good right now this what that's what I mean by being born again that nature got to die in you know sometimes you use you I mean if you're not careful you pull right back over into that you can have a powerful service after the service should be let me go get this do something that's that nature knew that got to die so I'm listening to this man he just sees just curse nothing man I just can't take it man so I went up I found I want my TV but since I'm a customer and I'm paying and I'm lonely went in here I found the thing on the volume turn it all the way down man walk back into shop you see my dick did I put that on mute or did you I say I did it I did it you're not even in here I'm in here I'm trying to read something here get it gets up gets another word but I'm listening and I said notice I'm the man the way these guys was arguing and fussing it was a spirit coming and saying and you know what if you don't care for you if you you listen to that you come out all that conversations go right to your job and stop talking about and you got the same spirit that they got on them only thing you ain't done yet it's curse but you got the same you're fussing argue about everything some of y'all got most fax box forces you know about your Bible that's that nature they got to die right and that's imma get there i'ma read a scripture for you on that one okay let me go on it's my duty as a pastor to make you make sure you're fit right brother branham say when a horse get to eat local we then you can't do nothing with them local we will kill a horse so as the pastor and I'm watching on the flock I got to keep the local weed out it might start with sports huh it might be a lot of other things in your life that local weed and I got to keep it at you know when you get born again it changes your outward appearance because when we when we of the world we dressed like the world we look like the world but we come to Christ we don't look like the world no more y'all know holiness is still right and come on now y'all y'all grew up on holiness yeah we knew Pentecostal people when we saw them we knew them some of us grew up Pentecost and when they started letting the world coming to the pinnacle search they start looking just like the Baptist's and everybody else and now the Pentecost searching what it used to be the power ain't there no more there used to fear God walking into the Pentecostal church if you have sin in your life you didn't go in there like that you got you you repented before you hit the dull not people just bring seeing right on into the church don't even care nothing about it can I just y'all gonna let me talk this much folk drink in front of a preacher used to be time your hide you hide no no no no no I'm you see people walking and you know they have those something if they put in the bag they hide it they got it they got it and you already know what they doing but they trying to hide it and they certainly went drinking in front of you but now what's up preach Church we need a new birth and anybody sailing so I might as well be the first one to see it right cuz ain't nobody gonna say nothing about it right I mean how we expect to go to heaven living like that good ain't gonna happen and in st. second just fellowship a little stuff like that all the time something wrong with your spirit that oughta bother you I know my spirit just get upset no no I can't do this I cannot do this I don't do so much of it and I'm out because my spirit just can't handle it hey man some of us just look forward to it something wrong we need to be born again local weed let me tell you a little bit about local weed because if you start eating locally it'll kill you a horse get ahold of some local wheat here to do some damage it's a local wheat is toxic for two reasons the first is that it has a toxic compound called swain so 9 that is an alkaloid and this alkaloid causes swelling of components of the nervous system after it accumulates in the body for time it must be consumed for a period of at least two weeks before it causes a reaction the second reason they are the reason that local we can be forces is because some species are selenium accumulators horses can tolerate very little selenium above the recommended intakes and accumulator plants often have levels drastically beyond the safe level now I might not know too much about that but brother Josue know everything that I just say it because he's work with horses right now listen some of the symptoms of our horse Enslin that he's on ate local weed you might not even know he ate it you might not have no idea but he'll start showing symptoms of it notice now it took two weeks before the bank start manifesting stuff halle-loo yeah one of the things that happens with the horses we see excessive validation he don't got a whole local week this one was kind of strange to me if you see the horse aimlessly wandering just Darren what you looking at that's what happened when y'all look at TV you can't even get people attention oh you don't got a host of local wheat do you need deliverance do you need to be born again you see that kind of a and I'm so so you get to delegate you don't give her on everything on TV ain't bad everything but some of it most of it most of it 98% of it 90% of it is bad even the news is bad but here we just sit on feet on that all day long you ain't read no Bible you ain't done nothing just you got to change your diet and all the way you can change your diet that you got to be born again aimlessly wandering on coordination and altered gates chronic weight loss another another thing symptom is if it's a horse got vision problems vision problems Lord some of us don't have some local weed I guess it's lethargy followed by extreme outbursts in response to mild stimuli you know that these are things that happen so we try to keep the local weed out you know of the body of Christ as well because we don't want to see all this I mean your outburst you get that from I mean if fffff I want a Christian well what were you going to I mean really what were you gonna do if you weren't a Christian see churches it's not hi Christians even supposed to talk it showed that we lost something along the way we need a new bird this is not nature sinful to begin with we were born and stand shake through the neck we came into the world speaking live if you got your father's nature you'll do the things your father didn't but when you're born again your nature changes let me just read something here about this family they had a trait in this family and what made them different was that they were born again you know there are certain things I mean if you're you know certain things happen in a family like I said people start tending to start going down those paths if you had a loose lady in the family praise the Lord she was always in some man's face always had a bunch of men in and out of the house that girl that grew up in that household if she's not born again she gonna end up just like that loose lady if you had it you had a boy watching the daddy play on every lady that he could that boy gonna grow up with the same spirit on him y'all know it's the truth the only thing stops that it's because we might have this a generational curse know if you born again that curse will be broken a man you can break the curse just get born again and let me tell you something when you truly born again like I say that does have something inside that manifest on the outside when you truly born again all that stuff that you fighting with it'll go away by itself because your nature changes your desires change Oh God amen amen Holly Lou yeah let me let me read about this little boy here stay with me on this one let me just find it glory to God you've got to be born again amen Lord Jesus when brother Brandon was talking about this birth he said now when when he was a born-again there were certain things that his conversion never took out of him and one of the one of the things was he still liked to hunt right so when I when I thought about I'm going to the message of paradox but I thought about that see hunting is sport right he enjoyed hunting the conversion doesn't take that out of you however the conversion does help you to manage it I like sports but my conversion helps me manage that right because if I'm not then I just end up just my who you know you talk about father's becoming couch potatoes and stuff like that I mean you did it's Saturday comes you can't get that man to do nothing he just stuck there to TV and can't wait for that season but when you're born again search become more important we got church I'm going to church ain't no church first God always first people know when you're born again praise the Lord search a man a man all right but see your conversion what the conversion is it's the Holy Spirit that moves the old nature out of you and gives push to new nature in you right the Holy Spirit takes that old nature the things of the world you know if you love the things of the world that a love of God is not in you yeah I know that that's the Bible if you are in love with the things of the world the love of God is not in you praise the Lord hallelujah all right I'm going on a little further yeah the Holy Ghost gonna make you live holy yes it will we might as well be true phenoms about the Holy Ghost would make you live holy it'll make you dress only at holy talk holy the asset will a man I mean when many of you young ladies in here y'all receive the Holy Ghost old it goes it calls you to change the way you dress a man you put on your dress and you skirt and took off your pants that's what the Holy Ghost did to you hey man the Holy Ghost told you to take off your makeup you took that off you took off your earrings the Holy Ghost did that no man made you do that the whole y'all know that number the truth because without the Holy Ghost you desire to do those things amen amen Holy Ghost should make a young man come out them tight clothes hello somebody I mean Holy Ghost I'll have you out here dressing like that and just because you a little got yourself a little body you got to put yourself on something real tight to make sure everybody can see your cut now the Holy Ghost undo that hello somebody a man your pants too tight now the Holy Ghost I'll make you do that brother brings it to everything you know they had a preacher that he was so cut so tight he stand in the pulpit with certain clothes on the mixture Everett the cameras can get every angle that when the Holy Ghost y'all know that's the truth and I'm wrong what you lookin right but look at the Bible straight viola exercise profiteth little in the wrong should be you know I'm not telling you don't exercise but if you're exercising just to try to make you look better in front of people something wrong with that something wrong with it and then take care of your health I understand that but not not not not the way that you doing it the Holy Ghost to make you dress dress different you so so some of us don't we don't we doesn't yell okay they lured them delivered us from makeup but you know then we put it on our on our toes it's the same thing y'all it's the same spirit it's the same spirit right well I can't allow to see my feet God see him hey man it's the same spirit praise the Lord somebody I got men out there putting the stuff on these toes and on their hands and I what is this this is a devil that's what if people need to be born again it's the truth anyhow amen I know I'm preaching like this all the time but I might as well sell it till today I want I'm gonna preach the same thing Jesus preach you must be born again right God see it God see it God see it all amen and see the reason that you do this because that's nature nature is its nature for a lady that want to look look good and and there's nothing wrong with nature wanting to let I praise the Lord every husband want his wife looking good but look good according to the Word of God amen it's got to be according to the Word of God if it's against the Word of God now we can't go with that we can't do it and even as a pastor I would want everybody look you know broke down tore up that's not look good look good I want you to look good but look holding the process see it's a full letter word it's a four-letter word holy and with a wife but not the rest of us got another four-letter word in with a why that we focus on sexy you choose which four-letter words you're gonna be sexy or holy which one you think God is is is doing hallelujah but you got to be careful you know everything you wear is that going to make me look more sexy or look make me look more holy you trying to pull somebody at the church in others at a church wherever you go don't you know look you gotta kind of fool nobody got a sin unto you when he ready for you to have them y'all just let me talk today a man a man a man you got to be born again glory to God get washed all over again you know when Jesus said that uh that he that's born of the water and of the spirit when a child is born of the water you know the first thing to do it that's how before they give it to the mama why should and the baby is born they go wash it and they bring it back to the mama same thing in the spirit when you watch it when you get born of the Spirit you're going to be washed by the Spirit then you'll be presented I want to talk about this just give me a few more minutes I'm gonna talk about this this thing that this boy was born with but the Holy Ghost is what changes then I'm in the message paradox so now this young fellas parents his mother's German no reflection on the German but there is a strain in that family and that is they'll just sit and you can talk to them and they'll just stare you right in the face that's the strain in the fam now I'm reading about this family but every family got strength and you can leave in five stars to start just really looking back in from you know all of us do this almost did that all strange that's in that family all right listen it says uh but there's a strain of em and that is they'll just sit and you can talk to them and they'll just stare stare you right in the face the the goodness girl system mother dasboard her sister I've come down the street many more in this young lady be setting out in the yard and I say good morning to you she just looked at me and I stop and I say surefire morning she was just standing looking right at you an intelligent woman and I say come up to see it sometime she's just standing look when her brothers are that way father and mothers that way now the father of the boys is strictly an Irishman Moody and high template you know sometimes your conversion do take some of those things away from me sometimes you're still left with some of that there's some people we're gonna win an argument there was that way before they came to Christ and they still that way not and i'ma take some time that's needed God can use that characteristic some time but you gotta know when God using it all right I'm going on it says up the father that boy is strictly an Irishman and and moody and high template high strung that's his whole family like that except one other elders family converted now and this this boy this father and mother both are Christians feel the Holy Ghost and they have brought this young man up in the way of the Lord and now the about 17 or 18 years old something along there very fine kid he's got a real model boy at home nice kid he's got a brother that's just vice versa but the girls the mother family lives close to a fine church but do you think they'd ever come over there no and they know it's right but it's just not in them ask forgiveness or ask partner I want y'all to catch that because there's some people they'll say the reason I don't go to that church because y'all talk about a prophet I can show you in the Bible where God say you'll spin the prophet I'll show you that writing your own Bible the reason that you don't come is because what it's going to require you to live that's why let's be honest I know what it's going to require me to live and I don't want to live that way okay fine I respect that but you know praise the Lord if you don't heard the truth and you die in that condition don't expect nobody to put you in heaven you rejected the word and you know what comes from rejecting the word praise the Lord Amen Church I'm I'm just I got to be honest with people well what good would it be for me to be up here just trying to take money I mean I thank God that people pay their tithes and offering that supports this church that that helps my family eat I appreciate that but about do all that and let y'all go to hell what kind of preacher would I be I got to stop and tell the truth you got to be born again and this message goes to your family to let your family know you got to be born again that's what a stopped us in a bird very good you can't beat this out of nobody Amen you can't fake it out of a child they need a new birth you're gonna have to preform that gotta give them the Holy Ghost birth all right I'm going on it says you think that come over there no and they know it's right but it's just not in the ask forgiveness or acts Parliament they just won't do it it's just not in them now the genes in the father and the mother that's born no matter how much they are converted still remains the flesh that's been interbred out to this boy therefore the boy has has got a complex in him just like from his mother's family and they are not forgiven so this boy's carrying something even though he go to church he's still carrying the same thing right into you know the church now look say they're not forgiven they will not apologize and that's where that boy stands now I can identify with that because I grew up with that same type of spirit I couldn't apologize for nothing I could be wrong as I as wrong could be proven wrong but I still would apologize my mom would have to twist my ear to get me to go to apologize but when the Holy Ghost came in that's what man are you wrong about that one go back and apologize on that now I can do it but it's the new birth that causes me to be able to do that before that I couldn't do it all right listen he says this now I sent to the Father no matter how much you raised him up I said now look at you out of your family out of your family all of them drunks and fighting and shooting and cutting and so forth now look at your family to the mother they're a bunch of people they just just sat there won't speak now you got to be honest with these people tell them this what your family is can you imagine that or what about you know how I'm sitting down with your family like this and everybody got family like that come on y'all yeah stop it you know if some families that easily get offended easily that's a strain in the family so anything less that's just who they are and others another family they speak rough to one another oh come on y'all y'all they speak rough and when they come a charge they speak rough to people I'm just trying I'm trying to get you to see if you can understand these things then you don't get so offended so easily right people got strains in them that the Holy Ghost don't take out them you need people like that oh my god and I just bear with me just for a few more minutes I've seen their certain people come to church and they got a certain spirit and then I see another person I got an opposite spirit not see them to connect they help each other and that sometimes as a pastor I don't even have to get in the middle of it because I know these two right here they're gonna sharpen each other you know God do that she let opposites attract that's the bring our better parts in you all right oh my god so sometimes it's good that a person got that as long as they doing it in the right way but everybody you know some easily fit it others man they don't care about who they offend and you need people like that because you know I think you need mothers in the church that are come to you saying I'm sister the way you dressing that's just not you know that's not of God and you know just please you know you need to you know you need to change that you need a mother in the church like that you also need one stay now what do and they were dressing like that you need that one too because you think the one that talked to your suite and saw you what you overlook that now you need one to get in your face pull your face Nath prays a lot somebody God give you both of them then put them in your life for a reason get that off your feet get down off your fingers you need one like that too I can I could when I say something some of y'all got on your mind which this is in the church there to tell you something like that they come from that family with that strain thank God that we got them here the conversion don't take everything out of you God uses some of that for his glory you know I can sum up there's people that would just run over you but then you got some esterases no no no no you can't do that here and maybe the first one to let you know thank God for that thank God for it let's go let's go on I'm going on I'm going on hallelujah now that don't give you a right to just do people in the kind of way you want to do them ain't no license for that you need to be born again but I'm trying to get you to understand I'm bringing a balance with this amen I want to read this I want to read a scripture and i'ma let y'all go y'all probably say Lord this preachers long-winded I told y'all this ain't no fast food Church here boy the same fast food we sit down and we enjoy our meal aid man that's why terse the way it is because they nobody takin no time to really deal with things a man listen says I now says now look at your family to the mother they're a bunch of people just set there one speak very independent so forth irreverent to religion but I said it's not you you're the only one of all your sisters and brothers and you were sweet kind and forgiving what does that your your your tree part of the family tree yet you received the Holy Ghost that's the thing that made you tender and sweet it's not your people anymore it's your Christ that lives in you see she was born again I said to the boy look at your family practically all of them are drunks and so forth I said and how Moody and hot-tempered and how strong but you're not you're kind forgiving what is it the Holy Spirit you're no more what you are is Christ in you I said now that's the same thing has to happen to your son yes son got to be born again that goes on he says and the father raised up and said my son went to the altar like that didn't he was baptized correctly in the name of Jesus Christ and water baptism in the pool so I know my son has come to Christ the prophecy I said that may be all right all the outward motions he might be identified as a believer with the believers but until he is regenerated born again I'll advise that young man never to marry a woman look at what he said he'll make hell on earth for ha you better lost what'd you get yourself involved with you better make sure that they've been born again because they'll make hell on earth for you he'll make hell on earth for her and to that gentle sweet forgiving Spirit of Christ comes in then that would be a paradox in itself to take the very nature of a boy that's bred between father and mother and yet in his intellectual his trauma is best to overcome overcome it he can't do it he'll never overcome it Christ will have to overcome it when he lets Christ in then he's already overcome then it'll be a perfect paradox when a man is born of the Spirit of God I just want to read this last script and I'm let you go turn with me to Galatians chapter 5 see again if you love you love the world the things the world and love God's lighting you we're always constantly battling with old nature and you all heard the story the black dog and the white dog the Indian chief of Santa I'm always battling with this black dog and white dogs is how you getting along say I'm getting along all right but this back dog and white dogs always balance saying I got one on one shoulder speaking one thing another another children speaking something else and says I will which one when he says the one I feed the most so we want the light dog to win you have to feed them feed on the word of God amen your conversion doesn't take certain desires from you the Prophet still like the hunt you may still enjoy sports but your conversion helps you can keep those things under control right so brother Brandon would not just hunt to kill right he didn't do that now if the lion got among some sheep or something like that then he might be hired to do that but he would just go hunting just to kill animals that's not what it was and and and and I want to just share this when I when I when I talk about you know his conversion changed things I want to just I want to bring something about lying hunting into the scripture and then I'll close it off Glacius five verse 16 when we're born again it changes our nature it changes our nature the Bible say this this I say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh said for the flesh lusteth against the spirit see that's that white dog and that black dog constantly fighting the let the lust the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that you cannot do the things that you would listen but if you be led of the Spirit ye are not under the law now the works of the flesh are manifest we want to know when we want operating in the flesh these things are going to manifest which are these adultery right now that that'll be when you walk in after the flesh adultery comes with it right fornication young people having sex and not being married praise the Lord uncleanness praise the Lord and I want to break some of these words down as we get to them just bear with me just for a few minutes uncleanness is immoral living right uncleanness it says lascivious Sevilla sness that's that's just unbridled lust you got to get control over the lusts amen but these are works of the flesh praise the Lord idolatry and we got all kind of things that we put the folk art we put our jobs before God you praise for the job now you get you the job but you let your job become your God idolatry witchcraft now you know what had to stop on that one cuz I got a definition on that one that I don't think most of us even know you know what I just clicked on that word witchcraft and you know it talked about sorcery magical arts often found in connection with idolatry and fostered by deceptions and the seductions of idolatry but also had a second definition it says the use or the administering of drunks witchcraft the use of drugs you got you got that you got the old when you born again you don't have that desire anymore you don't have a desire to practice witchcraft to do drugs hatred variance well what is variance variance is strife debate that's why I said earlier that we got to watch the spirit of debate variance right emulations there's the big one right there big words but that's competitiveness and when you get involved with sports it create brings that spirit right back out of you it does you hate the loose not only had it I remember you know that events that I used to see man the I want to call it karate or whatever that Taekwondo they go out there they have Taekwondo everybody win now look out there you know and and my nephew Caleb look good Caleb was good he was beating people like it up and he don't put somebody on the mat and they freeze them up you're the winner no they got beat they not the winner and when you go around telling everybody they win all the time in life and that they never lose then they can't handle life but the other thing happened when you get into that Dunham emulations emulations but that's why you got to see the conversions what keep that thing on the track next thing you know you're just doing all kind of stuff your cheat to win I want to give an example here you know before I go further I promise you I'm leaving I'm leaving in a second I'm leaving a second but one time for the Brandon was out hunting and while he was something they had a they were going to give out this award to the person that got the the largest lion and this man went out and shot a lie about nine foot four inches and he was so happy he shot this lion and brother Brandon had shot a lion his line was nine foot eight inches and he just you know just he just he knew had a nice trophy but he didn't you know he the same and so when they got back to the camp and they started announcing you know how big the Lions was it's one man he was just oh yeah I got the biggest one nine foot four inches I got nine foot four inches I know I got the bigger I'm taking home this trophy well one of brother branham's campaign say no no no these brother answer's no don't stay like that what's it means on sexy brother branham's you got the largest of note don't say nothing that means so much to him let them have it and I know in God no but you let them have it that took a death because we always want to be first place at one time in our family Union we had these little things that we was doing we've given out money you know talent show and and we had to look talent show going and and and this one guy come out I forget what he did think of the praise dance it wasn't it wasn't it just wasn't and some hot Caleb being Caleb Caleb come out and and just did a flip some kind of way forward and backward and and and and something with this Wanda moved in it then he started playing saxophone after he done flipped and when he played whatever song you played the anointing came down in the place when I ought to she bought ready to prophesied Spirit of God just moving like crazy and somehow you know we knew Caleb it one but befo you know we call that the the the the prizes I said Caleb let him win let them win that boy really wanted that you let them win don't don't don't worry about it and it did two things that humbles Caleb down because all that stuff is just deeds and now we're going to bring it back down it humbles you down because you got to watch the spirit of emulation sports produces that spirit sports will do it to you when you're born again it helps create a new nature let's keep going idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulations wrath strife seditions that's division and dissension heresies envyings murders now let me tell you somethin bout murder you don't have to necessarily take a gun and shoot somebody and take a knife and kill somebody but were you talking about somebody that's like taking a knife and stabbing in the back and you just murders if you murdered their character but the Holy Spirit a new birth helps you control that oh you just can't just be saying whatever you want to say to your mouth you need to get control over that drunkenness oh I got I got scripture you're not supposed to be drinking I got cokes l'viyah to people not supposed to be drinking brother branham's they drinking is a sin first thing I heard people say Jesus turn the water in the wine but he didn't drink it show me what he drunk it and then one one fella told us there but they did call him a wine-bibber okay you telling me the devil called Jesus a wine their blood and you're going to take that and use it to be a drink so you can drink they also call Jesus Beelzebub what did you believe about them drunkenness revellings let me just tell you know what revellings mean and we just read this but I want to give you meanings the Revel is a Caracara so nocturnal and riotous procession of half-drunken frolicsome fellows half-drunken now I don't know is it okay to be half drunk in a full drunken and drinking is a sin half drunken and frolicsome fellows who after supper because everybody want to get a little sip of wine after supper but when you get the Holy Ghost you don't have his eyes anymore praise the Lord somebody the wine bottles leave a man somebody you got to be born again right they say after after supper will parade through the streets with torches and music and honor of Bacchus that's what that's the false god idol God and I'm a Bacchus or some of the deity and sink and played before houses of male and female friends hence used generally of feasts and drinking parties that are protracted to late at night and indulge in reverie sure they doing suddenly not supposed to be doing something that got me pleased with so God wants to avoid rebel miss ret revellings right and suchlike of which i tell you before as i have also told you in time past that they which do look at this the bible state is they which do such things shall not exact can I go to head it's not me putting you there not the Bible say whether you go there and the Bible says you shall not you are not going like that hello somebody now I'm just preaching the wrong gospel I'm a preacher at all just this just this I mean you know people people want it wrong nowadays but I got to give you the raw gospel I gotta tell you just like it is I might only get one check one chance to preach to you and I'm gonna tell you I'm gonna take advantage of this chance because when you get to heaven your God said you heard the truth I had my servant day he preached it to you he's gonna replay this whole service alright it says they that which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God but the fruit of the Spirit so when you're born to spit when you've wanted to flesh you do those things but when you're born in the spirit it changes the fruit of Spirit is love what you can talk about people and love them at the same time they're fruit and I'm time I believe us this what believers opposed to be producing and if you ain't producing this it's time to be born again the fruit of the Spirit is love joy peace you ain't stirring up strife you actually try to find a way to get peace to it a lot yeah no damn number the true some of us got wheat some of things you look I'm gonna close this up but you know the Bible actually say that a where there is no wood the fire season which means the fire stops if there is no rule what that mean the things that you say either add to or take wood from the fire a soft answer turns away wrath not not a hard Oh can't talk to me that way who you they talk to Jesus in a kind of way and they even spit on him I wonder Jaime that's can handle that you know you can't handle it you need to be born again this this need to be born again am I wrong been honest but that's why God so you got to be born again because if you if you can't take the heat get out the kitchen right but but God requires a life I bet my remember had my best pants on I'm walking down the street hanging out with the young people I better come down the street and just throwing out rotten eggs and just hit me with one messed up my pants I'm ready to let's go find them find them for wets the fruit of spirit is love joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance I such there is no law nobody got no complaints about people operating like this and they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts if we live in the spirit let us walk let us also walk in the spirit let us not be desirous of vain glory provoking one another envying one another Church so don't don't let that be a testimony when when Christ say we got to be born again these the things that he's expected to come forth from our lives and you can't produce that without the Spirit of God on the inside of you if you know that Lord ain't ain't where I need to be that's where you need to start praying God get me where I'm supposed to be because this word ain't changing for nobody everybody from the pulpit to the back dogemoney absolutely if you want to inherit you want to get to heaven you must be born again that's just our heads and musicians you all make your way I want to have word of Prayer born-again is going beyond just a confession that you're making Church and we've done that time and time again but now it's time to get down to business with God if you just know your life is just not where it needs to be and like Lord I know you're speaking directly to me then I pray the day will be a day where you begin to make a difference Bible tells you to lay aside every sin and every weight that so he's the deception that means there's things that you're gonna have to give up God and gonna take it from you have to give it up every system here that gave up a pants she did them alone every system here that gave up her makeup she did that on her own gave up her earring she did that on her own he gave up her toenail polish and picking up all she did that on her own every sister that's done that that's done own every brother that decided I'm coming out of these a clothing that's not right dressing in appropriate ways even shorts I'm coming out of then I'm gonna put on my long pants I'm gonna look holy walking around in muscle shirts I'm not gonna do that tight jeans and things no I'm not doing that to bring attention to my body but I want to bring glory and honor to my god every person that did that has done that on their own everybody here has to make their own personal decision as to how they're going to serve God but I tell you what I can show you in Scripture what it requires them here if your heart is right with God to just submit yourself to his word the commandments of God are not creamy they're not creamy is not hard they're not difficult and we don't do it because God told us we had to do it we do it because we love Him pray that you just got a pricked your heart today I pray that you just get down to business with him don't don't play games with God you don't serve Him go all the way with them but don't go halfway because he didn't go half way to the cross he went all the way but I pray that as the word of God has been preached to our hearts here today that we Lord Jesus would come to a place of complete surrender god life is too short things happen so fast and we don't have time to to play games with it we got to be real the Bible says what the Bible says we can't change it it was here before any of us were here you wrote these things told us that we want to inherit the kingdom of God if you're operating in certain areas we cannot inherit the kingdom of God is it's plain and simple the only way our lives can be changes that if we are truly born again the nature on the inside has to change God we're praying that you would do exactly what you said you said to give us a new heart according to the Book of Ezekiel instead I'll give you a new heart I give you the spirit and then I'll put my spirit in the mystery that so God let that process take place there's not a person in here that raise their hands and say that they want it to go to hell not one nobody is looking forward to that God we come here because we want to be right so thank you for a word that you would give us today that would speak truth into our lives the first doctor that Jesus spoke you must be born again every area of my life where we're back five men we're going back to things God that we that you delivered us from we're going back into it God deal with this and don't let us don't let us Father be at rest until we begin to bring those things back under control of the Holy Ghost [Music] please Lord we don't want to come this far and listen it's not about us just coming to church and giving our money as important with our presence it's about getting right with God and that's what we want we want to be right so I pray God that there's one that has heard the word did they made the word do only with the word to do so as many as believe them me of them I gave power to become sons daughters of God so I pray that people would believe on you the word to a smoke may they accept it or may they walk in it I ask it from the mighty name of the Lord Jesus [Music] a man Romans 6:11 says likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto God through Jesus Christ I learned we got a diet ourselves got to those things that keeping us from serving God the way that we're supposed to serve them the words of Jesus do not change Marvin I am to you you must be born again [Music] but the Salah no would you come in as closes out with a song or solely say God bless your church thank you so much for hearing the word of the Lord today and I pray the word will have its preeminence in your life god bless you [Music] I need I need to I need the

Ghost so God we ask for refilling North Lord not just one more time but Lord daily Lord we need more help us O God we need I pray O God that as we leave this place we're not your presence Lord that
