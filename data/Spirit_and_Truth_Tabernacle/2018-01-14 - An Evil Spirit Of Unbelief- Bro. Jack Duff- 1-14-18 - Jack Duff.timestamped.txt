[54:41] and he just written it you know Paul
[54:44] said follow me and and we always quote
[54:47] follow me as I follow Christ yes he said

[1:02:16] you know I'm just you know there's a
[1:02:19] there's a lot that has happened there's
[1:02:21] a lot that has happened one of one of

[1:02:24] the youth services I wanted to give
[1:02:26] young man opportunities a man to
[1:02:29] minister and speak you know just just

[1:02:46] diet that we eat a man we have we have
[1:02:50] some food that we eat and and and I can
[1:02:53] tell what you serve in a man I can tell
[1:02:58] what you're serving now just because you
[1:03:00] pick up the Bible reason scriptures
[1:03:02] don't mean you saying what the Bible
[1:03:04] said all right now yeah I better be
[1:03:08] careful about this just because I'm
[1:03:10] gonna pick up a bar but you better be
[1:03:11] careful but are they really saying what
[1:03:14] the Bible say they've got something
[1:03:15] injected in there alright so you know we
[1:03:18] just we got to be a little careful in
[1:03:20] that area and and and and I mean I have
[1:03:23] preached some youth services before so I
[1:03:25] don't have no problem preach them again
[1:03:27] a man alright so but that's you know we
[1:03:33] we're going back to what God gave us and
[1:03:35] we're gonna keep doing these youth
[1:03:36] services praying that God will raise up
[1:03:38] help and I see God raising up help right
[1:03:40] here in our midst and and we're grateful
[1:03:42] for the help y'all pray for the help not
[1:03:44] pray for the help that we don't like
[1:03:48] that devil don't like nobody to get not
[1:03:50] here helping as soon as it soon as they
[1:03:52] do something but it that would be right
[1:03:53] there but you know you got like I said

[1:03:56] here to look cute you you need a fight
[1:03:58] and soon as it they will throw something
[1:04:00] then you got to be ready to
[1:04:01] counter-attack that demo
[1:04:02] they don't unload everything in your
[1:04:05] pack you know don't don't don't don't go
[1:04:08] back at the camp with weapons unleash
[1:04:10] all lap down the tail go back to get
[1:04:13] some more ammunition you know but but
[1:04:16] we're not gonna be afraid instead we're
[1:04:17] gonna stand up we're gonna we're gonna
[1:04:18] do all we can a man in the name of the
[1:04:21] Lord Jesus so alright i'ma let y'all go
[1:04:23] musicians thank y'all so much
[1:04:25] hey man appreciate appreciate you all a
[1:04:28] man we will stand and we will read a
[1:04:35] scripture own today and I'm not sure
[1:04:43] what's your name my brother Christopher
[1:04:47] I know you've been here before
[1:04:49] okay good to have you again Christopher
[1:04:52] yeah very very good to have you again a
[1:04:54] man I'm reading we're going back to our
[1:04:59] thought from last week and I'm reading
[1:05:02] from Hebrews 3 verse 12 through 13 and I
[1:05:07] want to maybe bring in you know just a
[1:05:11] couple other things here one of the
[1:05:15] other things I've noticed about brother
[1:05:17] Troy in his and his thought that he
[1:05:20] prayed a prayer there was like Lord let
[1:05:23] me just kind of get into a man the same
[1:05:25] channel and so a lot of things that he
[1:05:28] was bringing if you go back and look
[1:05:30] they were reiterating some of the things
[1:05:32] that were said in Bible study
[1:05:34] reiterating some of the other things
[1:05:36] that was said and not just in the
[1:05:38] preaching and that says a lot okay
[1:05:42] because if you have some times in
[1:05:45] ministry or you have different people
[1:05:46] that you know working together in
[1:05:49] ministry if they pull an apart then that
[1:05:52] divides the church but when they working
[1:05:55] together it keeps everybody United right
[1:05:58] is long glory to God sometimes there's a
[1:06:02] message in the message and we got to be
[1:06:08] sensitive to these things right but I
[1:06:11] appreciate that brother Troy I really
[1:06:13] appreciate that it was
[1:06:14] good to see that we as we starting out
[1:06:18] this new year we just trying to get all
[1:06:20] the right people in the right places and
[1:06:23] you know because god got great things in
[1:06:26] store and I mean before we leave here we
[1:06:29] go we're gonna get the devil some Fitz
[1:06:31] that's our plan give the devil some Fitz
[1:06:35] a man I rang Hebrews chapter three and I
[1:06:41] read from verse twelve and thirteen on
[1:06:44] last week I read that again this week
[1:06:47] take heed brethren lest there be in any
[1:06:52] of you an evil heart of unbelief and
[1:06:56] departing from the Living God all right
[1:07:00] but exhort one another daily this is
[1:07:05] this is important exhort one another
[1:07:07] daily while it is called today lest any
[1:07:11] of you be hardened through the
[1:07:14] deceitfulness of sin a man for we have
[1:07:19] made partakers of Christ if we hold the
[1:07:21] beginning of our confidence steadfast
[1:07:23] unto the end so we're looking at this
[1:07:27] this this this evil heart but I'm kind
[1:07:30] of changing the title a man today to
[1:07:33] evil spirit a man of unbelief not just
[1:07:37] evil heart but evil spirit of unbelief
[1:07:39] and if you would just turn with me to a
[1:07:42] man a passage of Scripture I got I got a
[1:07:44] couple that I need to read y'all just
[1:07:46] bear with me i'm i want to go to first
[1:07:49] seventy or eighteen and then second
[1:07:51] thessalonians to first samuel 18
[1:08:03] verse 10 just one verse here first
[1:08:07] samuel 18 and look at this it says and
[1:08:09] it came to pass on the morrow that the
[1:08:13] evil spirit from God came upon us all
[1:08:18] and he prophesied in the midst of the
[1:08:21] house and David played with his hand as
[1:08:24] at other times there was a javelin in
[1:08:27] Saul's hand let's just stop there maybe
[1:08:31] towards somewhere in the sermon will
[1:08:33] pick up 2nd Thessalonians and bring that
[1:08:35] in - but we want to title it today an
[1:08:38] evil spirit of unbelief and evil spirit
[1:08:41] not just an evil heart but an evil
[1:08:42] spirit of unbelief that's supposed to
[1:08:45] have word of Prayer father we're
[1:08:46] grateful for this time to be able to
[1:08:52] hear your word thank you for the
[1:08:53] anointing that has been in this place
[1:08:57] thank you God for all that has been done
[1:09:03] and we trust that the Holy Ghost would
[1:09:06] now take us further in the gospel that
[1:09:10] you got will reveal your truth to us
[1:09:13] that you got with have your way in the
[1:09:15] midst of this portion of the service we
[1:09:18] take every spirit that's against your
[1:09:19] spirit underneath the control of the
[1:09:21] Holy Ghost even right now encourage
[1:09:23] every heart in Jesus name we pray amen
[1:09:25] amen god bless you can be seated
[1:09:44] we want to again take for our subject an
[1:09:48] evil spirit of unbelief because that's
[1:09:56] that's what this really is a man it is
[1:09:59] it's a spirit right and last Sunday I
[1:10:02] was telling you how we were we were
[1:10:04] gonna get our flying here but we're
[1:10:07] gonna get our guns trained and we're
[1:10:11] gonna try to attack a spirit right
[1:10:14] because uh you know if we can get the
[1:10:16] spirit you know cast out then the people
[1:10:19] of God can be free and sometimes you
[1:10:22] have to be able to see things you know
[1:10:23] from from the scripture you know
[1:10:25] perspective but we we want to do the
[1:10:27] best we can to help us to see those
[1:10:29] things I want to start with a quote here
[1:10:32] today out of the message Christianity
[1:10:35] versus Dollar Tree Christianity versus
[1:10:39] Dollar Tree something that God's prophet
[1:10:43] tells us here and I want you to try to
[1:10:45] catch this a man says I was reading here
[1:10:49] where one came to I believe it was
[1:10:51] Iranian or Martin won some of the Bible
[1:10:54] students that's better versed in this
[1:10:56] and this then I'm had a gold crown on
[1:11:00] his head white robe own shoes and late
[1:11:03] with gold and said I am the Christ
[1:11:06] confess me that Saint wouldn't do it
[1:11:09] that real prophet of God stood there
[1:11:13] waiting and they said two or three times
[1:11:15] up to him I'm the Christ confessed me he
[1:11:19] said our Christ don't come like that it
[1:11:22] says that's right you got to know the
[1:11:25] word stay on the words see the great
[1:11:30] battle is at hand
[1:11:31] now we play church for years and years
[1:11:35] but the hours come now that when jamjam
[1:11:39] breeze and Janice will withstand Moses
[1:11:44] as the Bible sent they would now notice
[1:11:47] what the Prophet is telling us say this
[1:11:48] is the hour where Janice and Jambres
[1:11:50] will withstand Moses as the Bible said
[1:11:54] they would and it's going to be a
[1:11:56] spiritual battle
[1:11:57] I'm a just I'm gonna drop this off for
[1:11:59] you a them further proof that brother
[1:12:03] branham's ministry is also a type of
[1:12:05] Moses ministry I'm saying something I
[1:12:09] know it's gonna be a little deep for
[1:12:10] everybody but Moses said the Lord your
[1:12:13] God will raise up for a prophet like
[1:12:15] unto me that actually has dual meaning
[1:12:18] and man that was revealed multiple times
[1:12:21] it was fulfilled in the Ministry of
[1:12:23] Jesus Christ
[1:12:24] it was also fulfilled in the Ministry of
[1:12:26] Paul and it was also fulfilling the
[1:12:28] Ministry of William Branham and further
[1:12:31] proof that brother branham's ministry
[1:12:34] fulfills that is when you see the spirit
[1:12:37] of Janice and Jerry's will standing the
[1:12:41] Prophet that lets you know that's
[1:12:42] exactly in the word alright let's go on
[1:12:47] a little further it says Janet who says
[1:12:49] now those hours come that jammers
[1:12:51] Jambres and Janice will withstand Moses
[1:12:54] as the Bible said they would and it's
[1:12:55] going to be spiritual battle my it's
[1:13:00] going to be spiritual battle conflict Oh
[1:13:05] see we have to confront the opposition
[1:13:08] right it's going to be spiritual battle
[1:13:11] conflict they'll be they'll they'll be
[1:13:13] just they'll be just continue on the
[1:13:16] denominational Church will just move
[1:13:19] right on into the denomination and go on
[1:13:21] the way it goes but I mean the real true
[1:13:24] believer it's coming to that battlefield
[1:13:27] you know the denominational Church is
[1:13:28] not feeling what we feel it and then
[1:13:31] they have no idea what these things is
[1:13:33] that that's really going on the true
[1:13:35] believers coming to the battlefield we
[1:13:38] actually in the battle a man but this is
[1:13:40] the key thing say you better be versed
[1:13:43] and know what you're doing why because
[1:13:48] for you can take an evil spirit so easy
[1:13:53] and not know I'm gonna work with that
[1:13:58] you better be verse and know what you
[1:14:01] doing that's why everybody can't be
[1:14:03] going to believe the Sun everybody can't
[1:14:06] go to see kita truth everybody can't be
[1:14:09] at
[1:14:09] websites amen sometimes you get the
[1:14:12] reading of thanks and the Holy Spirit
[1:14:13] will tell you stop you better listen to
[1:14:17] the Holy Ghost because if you keep
[1:14:19] reading that stuff you yourself will
[1:14:21] take on an evil spirit and not even know
[1:14:27] it
[1:14:29] I'm just I'm just being honest because
[1:14:32] everybody goodness evil spirit they got
[1:14:34] it two years ago
[1:14:39] and I'm saying that I'm saying something
[1:14:42] without saying something
[1:14:43] these are key words two years two years
[1:14:47] if somebody starts saying I just I mean
[1:14:51] two years ago I started two years what
[1:14:54] everybody all of a sudden got this
[1:14:55] revelation two years ago that didn't
[1:14:58] happen to me two years ago amen two
[1:15:03] years ago I went full time ministry
[1:15:04] right so I mean but I don't know what I
[1:15:06] bet when you hear key words like that
[1:15:08] two years ago that is that showing that
[1:15:10] an evil spirit has come in you were you
[1:15:13] were entertaining something that you
[1:15:15] should not have been entertaining and
[1:15:17] see sometimes you know we you know we
[1:15:19] got to be careful Church I gotta be I
[1:15:21] gotta just let the church know these
[1:15:22] things you can't you you can't try to
[1:15:25] take on these battles yourself
[1:15:28] hallelujah Amen you know even in the
[1:15:31] Army they Spain they trained certain men
[1:15:34] for certain things if you ain't never
[1:15:37] drove a tape don't try to kill it I take
[1:15:39] mine and try to defend us right Amen you
[1:15:46] got to know your place and if you don't
[1:15:49] have the answer say I don't know where
[1:15:50] we can get the answer but why they keep
[1:15:53] avoiding the pulpit you can tell this a
[1:15:57] spirit and
[1:15:59] variance and there's evil spirit
[1:16:03] produces things it produces things it
[1:16:07] produces a very very hard heart
[1:16:09] [Music]
[1:16:11] extremely hard heart you know and you
[1:16:14] know I mean I was just reading a quote
[1:16:16] here just yesterday brother these
[1:16:19] brothers was accident by the Brandon it
[1:16:21] was in church order he was asked him how
[1:16:22] do I'm certain things that the brothers
[1:16:25] they were just promoted are actually
[1:16:27] performed officers Deacon yeah they were
[1:16:30] actually Saints to do certain things and
[1:16:32] other people would get upset with them
[1:16:34] and some of them just stopped coming to
[1:16:36] church because the Deacon acts gonna do
[1:16:38] something and they so they just they
[1:16:40] just got mad evil hearts weaken hearts
[1:16:42] right and and and so brother Brandon
[1:16:46] told the brothers say they say are we
[1:16:47] out of our place so you know what's
[1:16:49] funny he said he said no no you're not
[1:16:51] out of your place that's exactly what
[1:16:52] you're supposed to do as the Deacon of
[1:16:53] the church do it that way and it says I
[1:16:55] will you know we'll get those things
[1:16:57] straightened out with them you know but
[1:16:59] you know but what happens is that that
[1:17:01] you know as people kind of take on these
[1:17:03] these spirits he say he say the same way
[1:17:05] that they get mad at you they get mad at
[1:17:08] me all the time
[1:17:12] you y'all know why people get mad at me
[1:17:16] y'all know why huh
[1:17:24] I'm the one I'm the one that got to see
[1:17:27] it when nobody else won't see it I'm the
[1:17:32] one that's forced to see it
[1:17:34] and because I say it you offended all
[1:17:39] our acts is that just showed me in the
[1:17:42] Bible where I'm wrong that's it now
[1:17:45] don't get me wrong I mean I'm able to be
[1:17:47] corrected I was corrected a precious
[1:17:50] sister corrected me one time and I'll
[1:17:52] never forget it I thank God for her
[1:17:54] corrected me now I'm saying that and I
[1:17:57] must say this too so you don't get a
[1:17:58] spirit on you know he was good I don't
[1:18:03] think that everybody could just run up
[1:18:04] and correct now don't don't think that
[1:18:06] otherwise I wouldn't be the pastor all
[1:18:10] right stay with it stay with it but but
[1:18:13] but a sister told me one time she said
[1:18:14] she said you know pastor the Bible say
[1:18:17] that the wrath of man does not work the
[1:18:19] righteousness of God that's all she said
[1:18:22] James 1:20 past that's all just she
[1:18:25] didn't try to interpret it she just gave
[1:18:27] it to you know the Bible say that the
[1:18:29] wrath of man does not work the righteous
[1:18:31] of God I start reasoning okay thank you
[1:18:38] sister
[1:18:39] and what that was telling I can get up
[1:18:41] here and and and I'm not doing this I'm
[1:18:44] not get up here to just be mad and say
[1:18:46] things to people that's not that's not
[1:18:47] mine and now when I preached I do raise
[1:18:49] my voice that's just who I am
[1:18:51] if I was in Baptist I grabbed my ear and
[1:18:56] I was saying my sermon to you if I was
[1:18:59] still a Baptist come on I grab me an
[1:19:05] hour sing that thing to you but that's
[1:19:06] not God called me out of that and he
[1:19:09] brought me here so a lot of times I
[1:19:10] preach out you know I go up and down
[1:19:12] they constantly walk peaking all over
[1:19:15] the place everywhere I go to like
[1:19:16] brother Jack man we can't keep up with
[1:19:18] you know the decibels that that you I'm
[1:19:21] sorry that's the way God made me some
[1:19:22] preachers get up in it just you know
[1:19:24] just coast right alone don't they never
[1:19:25] raise their voice That's not me
[1:19:27] something yeah let's you all the time
[1:19:30] that's not me I just go up and down like
[1:19:33] this and you never know when I'm going
[1:19:36] but I'm trying to take you up with me
[1:19:39] all right but but church when we look at
[1:19:42] some of these things without what I want
[1:19:43] you to see is that you can you you you
[1:19:45] need to be versed right Oh Lord Jesus
[1:19:49] don't don't don't don't you know if
[1:19:53] you're not versed if you a babe in
[1:19:55] Christ don't go out there to the
[1:19:56] websites you're babe in Christ don't do
[1:20:00] that and and now you come back telling
[1:20:01] us what what the Prophet meant you just
[1:20:04] got here
[1:20:04] no don't do that don't do that right
[1:20:08] we've been following this for a number
[1:20:10] of years don't don't don't do it like
[1:20:12] that
[1:20:12] right so so here you know you know when
[1:20:16] even even a a believe that's been around
[1:20:19] for years can take on an evil spirit and
[1:20:22] not know it now the way you know it's an
[1:20:26] evil spirit watch the actions by their
[1:20:30] fruit you shall know them so that's how
[1:20:32] you know no no no no that ain't the
[1:20:34] Spirit of God that's not even in the
[1:20:35] word that right no that ain't no no
[1:20:38] that's an evil spirit now you might not
[1:20:40] be able to go and tell us about that
[1:20:42] cast I bet he was for no you can't do it
[1:20:44] like that you can keep praying but also
[1:20:46] know that the same way that the devil
[1:20:48] got them he's trying to get you so just
[1:20:52] don't give no no I'm not gonna pay no
[1:20:54] attention to that I mean you know there
[1:20:56] there's just even recently there was
[1:20:59] something that I was I was reading and
[1:21:01] you know I was just getting ready to
[1:21:03] study on it and I felt the Holy Spirit
[1:21:05] ever saying uh stop right there
[1:21:06] don't go no further with that so no okay
[1:21:10] I'm gonna just stop right there I'm not
[1:21:11] gonna look at that anymore because these
[1:21:13] fears are released in that and you open
[1:21:16] up your womb to stuff that you just
[1:21:19] never imagined that you'd open up to and
[1:21:21] not now you got questions in your mind
[1:21:22] but you open your womb to that listen
[1:21:25] that's what happened to Eve when she
[1:21:28] sent there listening and kept listening
[1:21:30] and kept listening that and notice she
[1:21:32] was listening when Adam was not around
[1:21:33] when the pastor was not around she was
[1:21:38] researching without the pastor that's
[1:21:42] what she was doing and then she got the
[1:21:43] research research without the pastor she
[1:21:45] thought she got a revelation and she
[1:21:47] brought it to the pastor
[1:21:49] introduced it to a pasta now he
[1:21:54] willfully went out and did what he did
[1:21:55] but he knew it was wrong all right
[1:21:58] Church listen this you better be versed
[1:22:01] and know what you're doing or you could
[1:22:03] take an evil spirit so easy and not know
[1:22:06] if it's contrary to his word don't
[1:22:08] believe it stay with that word
[1:22:10] now I'm gonna skip down go to paragraph
[1:22:12] 82 on that he says so many people today
[1:22:17] are opening their hearts to the wrong
[1:22:20] thing
[1:22:21] he says you get a spirit all right you
[1:22:25] get a spirit all right but many times it
[1:22:28] contradicts the word listen saying the
[1:22:31] days of miracles is past there's no such
[1:22:33] things such thing as this or that
[1:22:35] remember that's a devil under the
[1:22:38] disguise meant of Christianity oh I hope
[1:22:41] the church here it is you can own mind
[1:22:44] you have Devils out there in personating
[1:22:45] Christians right it's a devil on the
[1:22:48] disguise meant of Christianity god help
[1:22:51] us as help us when we get down to this
[1:22:54] and after bit that you see it that it's
[1:22:57] an evil spirit in the disguise of
[1:23:00] Christianity it taught sweet humble salt
[1:23:08] I mean you know I've had people brother
[1:23:11] I'm so open to fellowship with you you
[1:23:13] got such a good spirit I'm so open a
[1:23:15] fellowship to you with you at any time
[1:23:17] I'm so open I'm saying fellowship I'm
[1:23:20] open to answer your questions but I
[1:23:21] throw I told the person I told multiple
[1:23:23] food since all y'all got all these
[1:23:25] questions that get everybody together
[1:23:27] and settle the questions at one time but
[1:23:29] I can't be having individual meetings
[1:23:31] with everybody you know what you're
[1:23:32] trying to do drain me you're trying to
[1:23:35] drain me I'm not gonna be drained like
[1:23:37] that if people won't help I'm here to
[1:23:40] help but I'm not gonna let you drag me
[1:23:42] and especially if the questions are
[1:23:44] going nowhere I'm just I'm just being
[1:23:50] honest there's some questions that you
[1:23:52] know that I hear it ain't got nothing to
[1:23:54] do it the prophecy it's got to do what
[1:23:56] you heard one preacher say that you
[1:23:58] different with that preacher that in
[1:23:59] between me and you I mean me you and the
[1:24:01] preacher that's between you and the
[1:24:02] preacher
[1:24:02] but don't bring that to me alright tell
[1:24:05] me what you disagree with the Prophet
[1:24:07] and I want to go a little further with
[1:24:10] that the prophets the prophets
[1:24:12] responsibilities was to restore truth
[1:24:16] right here is his responsibility was to
[1:24:19] restore truth right so so you know when
[1:24:22] I look at that I mean God said the
[1:24:24] prophet not to talk about Amen a lot of
[1:24:27] unnecessary things but he came to talk
[1:24:30] about what happened in the Garden of
[1:24:32] Eden cuz somebody told me that you know
[1:24:33] if they say well then got nothing to do
[1:24:35] my salvation say okay okay you're saying
[1:24:37] gotten under yourself as y'all just bear
[1:24:38] with me hold on I'm going so if they say
[1:24:41] say so you ain't got nothing said but
[1:24:42] but when you get safe the first thing
[1:24:45] they give you is a Bible where you gonna
[1:24:49] turn to in your Bible to start reading
[1:24:51] Genesis look I hit the Garden of Eden
[1:24:54] somebody gotta explain to you what you
[1:24:56] just read because if you ain't got the
[1:24:58] picture right in the beginning you can't
[1:25:00] end up with a right in the end so yes
[1:25:03] what happened in the garden is just not
[1:25:05] important it's important everything in
[1:25:10] the script is important we want to just
[1:25:12] extract Calvary but that's not what God
[1:25:15] did he put it all in there right don't
[1:25:18] just try to take and just put it yes we
[1:25:20] thank God for Karen but there was other
[1:25:22] things happen after Calvary and you know
[1:25:25] and this one hit me I'm just I'm coming
[1:25:27] I'm coming back I'm coming back but this
[1:25:29] one just hit me last night because I
[1:25:32] said something about you know you got it
[1:25:34] you got to believe the word for your day
[1:25:36] you got except to work for your date so
[1:25:38] when I got a problem with that okay all
[1:25:41] right I understand and say well Moses
[1:25:43] you're not living in Moses day you're
[1:25:45] not living in Noah's day you're not
[1:25:48] living even in the days that Jesus
[1:25:51] walked the earth you're not living in
[1:25:53] John the Baptist team you're not living
[1:25:55] in Paul's day so what day are you living
[1:25:58] in now you don't have an answer to that
[1:26:01] but I do and I got a Bible answer my
[1:26:04] Bible answers that I'm living in the
[1:26:06] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[1:26:11] and when he shall begin to
[1:26:15] the mysteries of God would be finished
[1:26:18] that's what they I live in I can
[1:26:23] identify my day according to the
[1:26:25] scripture so when you see that they want
[1:26:28] to take that word day away they take in
[1:26:31] revelation 10 7 from you
[1:26:32] I remember sister told me this I guess I
[1:26:36] couldn't find my name in the Bible she
[1:26:38] said oh your name is all over the Bible
[1:26:39] brother Jack so every time you see you
[1:26:43] he was talking to you I said oh yeah
[1:26:47] thank God I didn't need to see my
[1:26:49] personal name I just needed to see you
[1:26:51] so when he said behold I send you Elijah
[1:26:56] the Prophet before the coming of the
[1:26:59] Great and dreadful day he might not have
[1:27:02] been talking to you but he was talking
[1:27:04] to me that's why I think of it is it
[1:27:09] might not be for you it's for me
[1:27:11] hallelujah can I keep going
[1:27:14] so many people today are opening their
[1:27:18] hearts to the wrong thing be careful you
[1:27:25] get a spirit all right but many times it
[1:27:27] contradicts the word saying the days of
[1:27:30] miracles has passed there's no such
[1:27:31] things as this or that I'm at the same
[1:27:33] quote paragraph 82 remember that's a
[1:27:36] devil under disguise meant of Christian
[1:27:38] 'god help us when we get down into this
[1:27:40] after bit then you see it then it's an
[1:27:43] evil spirit and disguise men of
[1:27:45] Christianity but it isn't the Spirit of
[1:27:47] Christ because the Spirit of Christ
[1:27:49] comes to the to the word every time he
[1:27:52] can't deny his own word now I want to
[1:27:54] just give a little example of an evil
[1:27:57] spirit okay that can overtake somebody
[1:28:00] and them not realize that it's an evil
[1:28:01] spirit religious religious church-going
[1:28:05] folk but could actually take on an evil
[1:28:08] spirit one time brother Branham was
[1:28:10] having some meetings and as he was there
[1:28:12] praying for the sick there was a boy
[1:28:14] with epilepsy that come up to be pray
[1:28:16] for him and brother Branham said you
[1:28:19] know he start praying to a man in spirit
[1:28:20] just one ghost like man it's just
[1:28:22] something wrong here so they start
[1:28:23] looking around the audience and as he
[1:28:25] looked over the audience he saw this
[1:28:27] group
[1:28:27] people in the audience with their heads
[1:28:29] up and if they say please put your head
[1:28:31] down
[1:28:32] he said please reverence you know what
[1:28:35] God is doing this moment please put your
[1:28:36] head down don't don't have your head up
[1:28:38] have their head up anyway heydo so
[1:28:40] didn't the pastor of this group right
[1:28:43] let's see I'm leader a man of God good
[1:28:47] man
[1:28:48] had great intentions he just didn't
[1:28:50] believe this but with his with his good
[1:28:52] intentions taught his congregation that
[1:28:55] they did not have to put their head down
[1:28:56] when when the Prophet actually put the
[1:28:58] head down he said we don't have to do it
[1:29:00] he'd say this is a public place and we
[1:29:02] can do whatever we want to do the brand
[1:29:06] Imam he says okay and he prayed you say
[1:29:10] lord please don't let this child suffer
[1:29:12] because of their irreverence and it told
[1:29:14] a spirit that was in it I said man you
[1:29:16] and he cast a spirit out so we can cast
[1:29:19] evil spirits out and he cast the spirit
[1:29:21] I said now he said now I'll tell you
[1:29:23] what you got to come out of this child
[1:29:25] but you are free you are free to go to
[1:29:30] them that are irreverent can I can I can
[1:29:33] I tell y'all something because of how
[1:29:36] how how how real this message is I would
[1:29:43] rather for you not to come to church and
[1:29:45] be irreverent then the come and sit here
[1:29:48] and be irreverent I rather if you just
[1:29:50] don't come right because you never know
[1:29:52] when something like that could happen to
[1:29:54] you but when that spirit left when
[1:29:57] brother Branham gave the spirit I say
[1:29:59] you can you certainly have access to go
[1:30:01] into whoever's irreverent twenty eight
[1:30:03] people at one time was bound with
[1:30:06] epilepsy and they brother Bram say I'm
[1:30:09] not even praying for him he said oh I
[1:30:14] got the cold here he said God allowed
[1:30:15] that spirit to come on now either keep
[1:30:18] statement God allowed that spirit I'm
[1:30:22] saying something now God allow that
[1:30:26] spirit now let's go back and look at
[1:30:30] Samuel
[1:30:35] look at this because this just kind of
[1:30:38] you know huh you know God God is a good
[1:30:40] god nothing bad about God you're right
[1:30:44] ain't nothin bad about him but these
[1:30:46] evil spirits can't come from God
[1:30:48] woo no that's heavy
[1:30:51] listen and it came to pass verse 10 say
[1:30:53] first time you 18 percent and it came to
[1:30:55] pass on the morrow that the evil spirit
[1:30:57] from God came upon us all and any
[1:31:02] prophesy in the midst of the house and
[1:31:04] David played with his hand and as as at
[1:31:08] other times and there was a javelin in
[1:31:10] Saul's hand now I want to just just stay
[1:31:13] with me you know on this you know we
[1:31:16] don't we gonna break into this in a
[1:31:17] little bit but you know last week we
[1:31:20] were just kind of sharing how brother
[1:31:23] branham made a statement how their
[1:31:24] hearts were hardened just like it was in
[1:31:27] the time of Joseph and so forth right
[1:31:29] you talked about how the hearts were
[1:31:30] hardened right and and and when we went
[1:31:33] back and we looked at Joseph we noticed
[1:31:36] that the hardened heart does a couple
[1:31:37] things a hurting heart will hate a
[1:31:40] hardened heart cannot speak peaceably
[1:31:43] amen and in this particular situation
[1:31:46] we're set with Saul he had a heart hurt
[1:31:51] or he had an evil heart and that heart
[1:31:54] became a jealous heart mine and and
[1:31:57] because of his jealousy he was trying to
[1:32:00] slay David now you mean remember now
[1:32:03] remember before a day that came into
[1:32:05] Saul's presidents David had already been
[1:32:08] pre anointed the King Oh God he was
[1:32:13] already pre in order the king now Saul
[1:32:15] may not have known that David was the
[1:32:17] pre anointed king but he was slow or
[1:32:20] Satan inside us all trying to destroy
[1:32:23] the PIA anointed king Oh hallelujah
[1:32:28] right so oftentimes you might not
[1:32:30] realize about they they know that just
[1:32:32] like he knew and maybe he didn't know
[1:32:34] but God knew David was coming to power
[1:32:36] God was gonna use data for great things
[1:32:38] guess what God wants to use this
[1:32:41] for great things but it's an evil spirit
[1:32:45] trying to destroy the box trying to stop
[1:32:50] the bra it's an evil spirit trying to do
[1:32:52] that oh my god see we coming against the
[1:32:57] spirit church I mean we man we love
[1:33:00] people we love people but we hate
[1:33:02] spirits hate them hate them and I'm not
[1:33:08] ashamed to admit I hate spirits I mean I
[1:33:10] don't like to see people get entangled
[1:33:13] with bad spirits and you know one of the
[1:33:16] worst fears that a person had happens a
[1:33:17] religious spirit it's terrible it's
[1:33:23] terrible but listen a hardened heart or
[1:33:25] evil heart will become a jealous heart
[1:33:27] now and what happened here was saw you
[1:33:29] know this evil spirit that were coming
[1:33:31] and anoint him at different times men
[1:33:34] they'd have to get somebody said look we
[1:33:36] need some American play some music I
[1:33:38] said I mean they couldn't stand up in
[1:33:40] his presence it wasn't it one when this
[1:33:44] man he just he just lose it oh my god he
[1:33:49] weren't able to kind of keep his
[1:33:50] emotions under control I'm talking real
[1:33:52] good because this is what happened to
[1:33:55] people when they get II was feeling I
[1:33:56] mean they just all over the place they
[1:33:57] they totally imbalance with the emotions
[1:34:00] that they just can't control themselves
[1:34:02] it's the devil anointing them right the
[1:34:07] devil nor them and then the devil get
[1:34:08] them so worked up then they start making
[1:34:10] bad decisions they start doing I mean
[1:34:12] it's a devil all alone and we're trying
[1:34:15] to catch that Devil out here this man
[1:34:18] this man Saul had this feared on them
[1:34:21] say they say look that the people around
[1:34:23] him cement you soul you so bad off we
[1:34:25] gotta find some matters of knowing it
[1:34:27] with music that can play and they just
[1:34:30] need to play in your presence and maybe
[1:34:31] them spirits to calm down
[1:34:33] so if David didn't apply for the job
[1:34:37] David didn't apply for the job
[1:34:39] but what David did David they were just
[1:34:41] out there just playing as me like you
[1:34:43] normally do and somebody recognized that
[1:34:44] this boy is anointed
[1:34:47] sometimes just walking around and man
[1:34:49] this guy is anointing hallelujah
[1:34:52] say wouldn't it wouldn't it be so nice
[1:34:53] that you could create an atmosphere if
[1:34:57] you couldn't do it at home
[1:34:59] can you do it at church that we can
[1:35:01] create an atmosphere for people no man
[1:35:03] this place is anointed and that if you
[1:35:05] coming here at one speed you gotta leave
[1:35:07] free he say he say he say you say they
[1:35:11] said man we know somebody and it wasn't
[1:35:13] just one person multiple multiple people
[1:35:15] hurt David play so this kind of North to
[1:35:17] say Saul we need to get this guy here
[1:35:19] let him play for you I guarantee them
[1:35:22] spirits to be cast out of you and and
[1:35:24] and David Saul get all in a fix
[1:35:26] you don't know what's giving what's
[1:35:28] getting ready to happen he got that
[1:35:29] javelin in his hand and maybe people on
[1:35:33] Singlish javelin once we say any time he
[1:35:35] did that jab in something ready to
[1:35:36] happen y'all better run for cover right
[1:35:38] and here you got that javelins damage
[1:35:40] they said no it's David start playing
[1:35:42] that heart and play that music mistaking
[1:35:43] of that that spirit calm down he put the
[1:35:45] javelin down but one day because of
[1:35:47] jealousy Dave was sitting in his
[1:35:49] presence and and you know he had come up
[1:35:51] with some some scheme a man about you
[1:35:57] know if you go and uh if I mean you go
[1:35:59] in your slaves so many Philistines and
[1:36:01] you know we'll I'll give you a give you
[1:36:02] my daughter to wife and our son David go
[1:36:05] and slay double the amount that he gave
[1:36:08] up and the ladies come back with that
[1:36:10] song the sisters of the church returned
[1:36:16] into Saul's Church with a new song they
[1:36:19] was freshly inspired solace latest
[1:36:24] thousands and may be solved as the oh
[1:36:26] yeah glory hallelujah so let's latest
[1:36:29] thousands and each and he just demand
[1:36:31] that's a wonderful song and then then
[1:36:34] then they they changed an ad of the
[1:36:35] second verse and when they added a
[1:36:38] second verse say but David solace latest
[1:36:42] thousands but david that's latest ten
[1:36:45] thousands and when we Nate when he heard
[1:36:47] but David say that evil spirit ain't
[1:36:50] that old song right - II wanna kill
[1:36:54] David the same man
[1:36:56] just broke him deliverance now he wants
[1:36:59] to kill that evil spirit did that say
[1:37:06] you were spared from the Lord now wait a
[1:37:07] minute if there's from the Lord if it's
[1:37:09] from the Lord God must have purpose I
[1:37:12] can tell you already what God's purpose
[1:37:15] is he has another king yet God already
[1:37:22] had moved on from song he had another
[1:37:24] king and and and David was gonna be that
[1:37:28] next king let me let me just let me work
[1:37:35] with this a little bit more the evil
[1:37:37] spirit from the Lord because I can't
[1:37:42] just leave you it's not gonna it's not
[1:37:46] gonna work the way I'm I'm gonna let it
[1:37:48] work i'ma tell you why that evil spirit
[1:37:51] from the Lord happened with Saul because
[1:37:54] God had another king but today there's
[1:37:57] an evil spirit from the Lord
[1:38:11] second Thessalonians chapter 2
[1:38:20] and I also I want to leave you like that
[1:38:23] cuz I know some of y'all but just might
[1:38:24] not catch everything I'm saying the
[1:38:27] reason that the evil spirit comes from
[1:38:29] the Lord is because the evil spirit has
[1:38:32] to have permission before it can do what
[1:38:37] is doing so the last place that a god is
[1:38:41] permission was in the presence of the
[1:38:44] Lord
[1:38:52] 2nd 2nd Thessalonians chapter 2 look at
[1:38:55] this verse 1 now we beseech you brethren
[1:38:59] by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:39:02] and by our gathering together unto him
[1:39:04] that ye be not soon shaken in mind or be
[1:39:11] troubled neither by spirit nor by word
[1:39:16] nor by letter as from us as that the day
[1:39:23] of Christ is at hand verse 3 let no man
[1:39:29] deceive you I like this by any means by
[1:39:36] any means not nothing don't let them
[1:39:38] deceive you but let no man deceive you
[1:39:40] by any means for that day shall not come
[1:39:45] except there come a falling away first
[1:39:48] and that the man of sin be revealed the
[1:39:53] son of perdition who opposeth and
[1:39:56] exalteth himself above all that is
[1:39:58] called God or that is worshipped so that
[1:40:01] he as God sitteth in the temple of God
[1:40:04] showing himself that He is God now I
[1:40:08] want you to just kind of understand this
[1:40:10] and and and don't get me wrong
[1:40:12] when I read this I mean you know
[1:40:15] sometimes things happen let me I've
[1:40:17] heard it many times somebody you know
[1:40:21] what rise up a man and and and feel that
[1:40:24] too I mean they go from one message
[1:40:27] Church to another
[1:40:29] message Church I want you to get it they
[1:40:32] go for one message church to a another
[1:40:35] message Church and what the people would
[1:40:39] say is that they went out from us
[1:40:40] because they were not of us they went
[1:40:44] from one message church to another
[1:40:47] message church and you are miss applying
[1:40:51] the scripture so I'm not doing that
[1:40:57] but I am trying to help you see that
[1:40:59] this is an order for God's Word to be
[1:41:01] for feel and evil spirit has to come
[1:41:05] from the Lord to bring it to pass and
[1:41:10] unfortunately people don't realize that
[1:41:12] it's an evil spirit when when it when it
[1:41:15] got started on the websites it was an
[1:41:16] evil spirit behind it and they had no
[1:41:19] idea and and that's right you know I'm
[1:41:20] sorry I'm for me I'm not I'm casting I'm
[1:41:23] casting all I'm casting away evil
[1:41:25] spirits specially when it comes to those
[1:41:27] that I love the Prophet told me well he
[1:41:30] didn't tell it to me but but the angel
[1:41:32] told him and I'm taking that if the
[1:41:34] angel told you then he must have been
[1:41:35] talking to me - because you said it
[1:41:37] secret things belong unto the Lord our
[1:41:39] God but once they reveal they belong
[1:41:45] unto us that's what the Bible's saying
[1:41:48] if you want to keep that a secret you
[1:41:51] should've kept it a secret but soon as
[1:41:53] you revealed it I'm taking it for myself
[1:41:55] [Music]
[1:41:58] into telling me you see all that you
[1:42:00] love and all that ever loved you God has
[1:42:05] given to you they're gonna be on the
[1:42:08] other side I might not know how they're
[1:42:11] gonna get there but I must know my
[1:42:13] promise if you say they're gonna be I'm
[1:42:17] looking for so I'm not putting I'm not
[1:42:21] putting my loved ones in this I'm
[1:42:23] telling you the spirit that is in my
[1:42:25] land today sometimes people get wrapped
[1:42:28] up and stuff and don't know what they
[1:42:29] wrapped up into they just don't
[1:42:30] understand the God is able to deliver
[1:42:34] and if it wasn't for God's grace I would
[1:42:36] be all wrapped up not only that and that
[1:42:39] does grace some time we tempt God
[1:42:41] y'all know how we tiptoe let me see what
[1:42:44] they saying let me see if I can let no
[1:42:47] no no no no don't don't do it don't do
[1:42:49] it look too many people don't went down
[1:42:51] too many and you are not going to be
[1:42:54] able to withstand them you're not best
[1:42:58] thing you can do is pray
[1:42:59] that's just your greatest weapon not
[1:43:03] your intellect your prayers can I go on
[1:43:09] a little further here I want to read
[1:43:12] that that's 70 70th week of Daniel a
[1:43:16] quote here where brother Brandon brings
[1:43:19] us in I'm just kind of tying all these
[1:43:21] thoughts together if we can I'm gonna go
[1:43:25] back and show you how you know that
[1:43:27] spear got to get permission that
[1:43:30] scripture down somebody might have to
[1:43:32] help me find that one but I want to go
[1:43:36] and find micaiah a mastermind I might
[1:43:38] have to help me find that one and I'll
[1:43:41] get it but let me read this quote the
[1:43:44] 70th week of Daniel brother Adam said
[1:43:46] now a revelation 13:14 Jesus in Matthew
[1:43:49] 24 warned them of it and image them to
[1:43:52] the beasts Paul the second Thessalonians
[1:43:54] the second chapter third and fourth
[1:43:56] verses let's get it see Paul what he
[1:43:58] says here about it that great holy
[1:44:00] spirit on this great prophet of the Lord
[1:44:03] see what he said about it in the last
[1:44:05] day and thest and second Thessalonians
[1:44:07] the second chapter is what it is alright
[1:44:10] sermon began with the third verse I
[1:44:12] believe it is alright let's read now
[1:44:14] listen close everybody how many believes
[1:44:16] that Paul was filled with the Holy
[1:44:17] Spirit watch here let no man deceive you
[1:44:20] by any means for that day shall not come
[1:44:24] except there come a falling away first
[1:44:27] he's trying to get it out of their head
[1:44:30] that he's coming right then so there's
[1:44:32] got to be a falling away from the church
[1:44:34] first see come over in the Laodicean age
[1:44:37] and that's that man of sin be revealed
[1:44:40] the man of sin and unbelief in the Holy
[1:44:43] Ghost the man of sin that's what brother
[1:44:45] Branham call unbelief and the Holy Ghost
[1:44:47] unbelief be revealed the son of
[1:44:50] perdition like Judas was the treasurer
[1:44:52] of the church who opposes and exalts and
[1:44:54] stuff
[1:44:54] above all of that's called God or that
[1:44:57] is worshipped so that be as God sitteth
[1:44:59] in the temple of God brother is their
[1:45:01] personal Earth outside the Vatican that
[1:45:03] does that where is it at and notice now
[1:45:06] there is a there's a great falling away
[1:45:09] right there's always this great falling
[1:45:12] away before something tremendous is
[1:45:14] about to happen and if I can just go
[1:45:16] back and use Judas he fell away before
[1:45:19] Jesus went to the cross right he fell
[1:45:21] away and you know and here here we're
[1:45:24] gonna have the same thing kind of
[1:45:25] happened today a great falling away
[1:45:28] glory to God it's an evil spirit in
[1:45:31] order for God's Word to be fulfilled
[1:45:32] this evil spirit has to anoint somebody
[1:45:35] in order to bring it to pass
[1:45:37] can I go and just bring that out to you
[1:45:38] amen let's first kings wet 22 thank you
[1:45:44] very much first Kings 21 22 all right I
[1:45:48] found it thank you so much for
[1:45:50] forgetting that amen
[1:45:51] see you know we read the Bible we
[1:45:56] believe the Bible
[1:45:57] hey man I'm giving you the quote from
[1:46:00] the Bible first Kings 22 hallelujah I
[1:46:05] like this now I'm not gonna read the
[1:46:08] whole chapter but let me just try to
[1:46:10] find exactly where I want to be yet this
[1:46:13] is um oh yeah
[1:46:15] verse 35 I think is where where is that
[1:46:19] says okay thank you
[1:46:24] a man I forgot to look this one up y'all
[1:46:27] say first Kings 22 okay alright I had 20
[1:46:31] 21 okay thank you very much yeah I think
[1:46:36] I got to go before that
[1:46:39] we're in the book we in the book so let
[1:46:43] me let's start at verse 13 when I'm
[1:46:45] without what I'm showing that these evil
[1:46:47] spirits that they can come from the Lord
[1:46:48] but their purpose for coming is God has
[1:46:52] certain things that he needs to fulfill
[1:46:54] my an order for David to become king an
[1:46:59] evil spirit came from the Lord to get
[1:47:01] Saul all out of whack now I got
[1:47:05] something else to say about song so die
[1:47:09] with the spirit all that's all made it
[1:47:16] [Music]
[1:47:19] Saul still made it with a evil spirit on
[1:47:23] him because when he died what Saul did
[1:47:27] he told he said we don't kill all the
[1:47:29] wizards and witches and everything we're
[1:47:31] gonna get them out of there
[1:47:32] he said we burned all of that we found
[1:47:34] anybody doing their gonna die but when
[1:47:35] Saul could not hear from God he went and
[1:47:39] found himself a woman a man that had
[1:47:42] familiars that worked him for me his
[1:47:44] spirits and she called up the spirit of
[1:47:46] Samuel she curled it up and she say she
[1:47:49] say wait a min you deceive me you the
[1:47:51] king and you dressed in disguise and you
[1:47:53] you do you deceive me I'm not supposed
[1:47:55] to be doing so I say so what you see say
[1:47:57] I seek God's coming up they said what do
[1:48:00] you look like start this problem with
[1:48:02] the problem I said that standard please
[1:48:03] call him up from me shame it came up
[1:48:06] said why you wake me on my wrist talking
[1:48:10] to him it's a you say okay by this time
[1:48:11] tomorrow still a prophet already dead
[1:48:15] but still a prophet come back and say
[1:48:17] say by this time tomorrow you and your
[1:48:19] sons will be with me
[1:48:22] so wherever samuel was saul with an evil
[1:48:28] spirit went to the same place
[1:48:38] and if so make it then I know everyone
[1:48:44] that belongs to me gonna make it okay
[1:48:51] that that right there give it
[1:48:54] Dabo my own battles with everything that
[1:48:58] you've been allowed to do you still
[1:48:59] couldn't separate them but I'll show you
[1:49:02] how powerful Greece is the man died with
[1:49:07] an evil spirit the last thing he did was
[1:49:11] working something evil went to battle
[1:49:14] and died now his death it wasn't good it
[1:49:18] wasn't good
[1:49:19] don't lord it even in his death because
[1:49:22] people you know got this thing well you
[1:49:23] know if a man commits suicide
[1:49:25] you know he's not gonna make it well you
[1:49:29] read your Bible that's why you got to
[1:49:30] read all your Bible because you read one
[1:49:33] chapter it look like Saul committed
[1:49:36] suicide and if you stop there you'll go
[1:49:39] around preaching Saul committed suicide
[1:49:41] and you know what if you just aim that
[1:49:43] you'll be exactly right on that
[1:49:45] Scripture but if we take you to the next
[1:49:48] look in the next chapter you see a story
[1:49:52] was told about this young man say and he
[1:49:55] come telling David said no no no I got
[1:49:58] the throne I got the kid I got I got
[1:50:00] this up this this this the crown I got
[1:50:02] all this man here you know I'm David
[1:50:04] it's all yours I'm bringing it to you
[1:50:06] like he had done something David said I
[1:50:09] tell me the story say I saw Saul and he
[1:50:13] hit following sport but he did not die
[1:50:15] and he asked me to slay him anything
[1:50:21] they say mmm-hmm you did what yeah he
[1:50:25] asked me to stem and I sprayed him I
[1:50:26] made sure he was dead and I took his
[1:50:28] crown and I brought it straight here to
[1:50:31] you David he was looking for position
[1:50:35] David began to accent some questions now
[1:50:37] who you were you from who you people we
[1:50:43] Amalekites
[1:50:47] malachite these were the same people saw
[1:50:51] was supposed to stay and because he did
[1:50:54] not slay them guess what God allowed
[1:50:56] when the malachite to come back and slay
[1:50:57] em so you better kill your mama cocksman
[1:51:00] for your Amalekites before your
[1:51:06] malachite kill you you better kill them
[1:51:08] but here Saul didn't do that but but
[1:51:11] salt salt here this man so he didn't die
[1:51:13] a man kill himself he tried to but it
[1:51:16] wasn't successful
[1:51:17] another a malachite killed him and David
[1:51:20] David even and all that grief David was
[1:51:25] not happy that Saul died that's why you
[1:51:29] know you can't get up talk about no they
[1:51:30] went out from us because he was not of
[1:51:32] us you don't do nothing like that you
[1:51:34] don't you have the Spirit of God
[1:51:38] some people rejoice seeing somebody fall
[1:51:42] you got a devil on you you got an evil
[1:51:45] spirit
[1:51:46] you don't rejoice in that like that the
[1:51:49] Angels rejoiced when people repent
[1:51:51] how you come rejoice when people fall
[1:51:57] but here you know look at this and I
[1:52:02] don't even know where I was I don't lost
[1:52:03] myself I'm Gary I was getting ready to
[1:52:06] go I'm going back to Makai but I was
[1:52:07] saying something else there but yeah the
[1:52:10] suicide stuff so Dave I mean Saul did
[1:52:12] not commit suicide right so so when you
[1:52:15] say we say and I'm so glad I that's why
[1:52:18] so I'm good to go to church y'all go to
[1:52:20] church you don't know when you hear
[1:52:22] other preachers not just your pastor get
[1:52:24] to meetings and go out there and hear
[1:52:25] things I went to a meeting last year and
[1:52:28] the brother got to preaching about
[1:52:29] suicide and how how folks say out you
[1:52:32] know you can't make it less you I mean
[1:52:33] if you commit suicide you ain't gonna
[1:52:34] make it
[1:52:34] there cuz the Bible say thou shalt not
[1:52:36] kill say now you got to be careful yes
[1:52:38] the Bible just say that should I kill
[1:52:39] but there was a man that made it that
[1:52:40] committed suicide who Sampson
[1:52:49] now wait a minute
[1:52:50] I am not condoning people committing
[1:52:55] suicide
[1:52:58] see I'm sorry I raised it up every once
[1:53:00] in a while I am NOT sitting here
[1:53:03] condoning it I come I catch that evil
[1:53:06] spirit and don't sit there and well
[1:53:13] brother Jack see it don't you do that
[1:53:17] and if you if you if you don't tell God
[1:53:19] that's right you said that do that you
[1:53:21] might not make it but I'm just telling
[1:53:27] you how that you've got to make sure the
[1:53:28] scripture aligns with Scripture it's the
[1:53:32] grace of God
[1:53:33] hey man you don't know who's gonna get
[1:53:35] it who ain't gonna get it
[1:53:36] amen see so you know but when you look
[1:53:40] at something like that you know Samson
[1:53:42] Samson said you know God let me die with
[1:53:45] these Philistines and when he pushed
[1:53:46] them pilis samson died i was suicide
[1:53:51] that's what it was they meant it was not
[1:53:54] murdered it was suicide
[1:53:55] all right I'm back over here in 1st
[1:54:00] Kings I'm talk about these evil spirits
[1:54:03] that come from God evil spirits Eve's
[1:54:09] fear from the Lord a man and there's
[1:54:12] many others that I could read but here I
[1:54:16] want to talk about this evil spirit
[1:54:19] brother Branham makes a statement said
[1:54:21] he said look at job a perfect manner
[1:54:23] just man God permitted the evil devil to
[1:54:25] come upon him and chastise him and
[1:54:27] everything else for the perfecting of
[1:54:28] his spirit see so evil spheres God uses
[1:54:32] evil spheres many times to work out his
[1:54:34] plan and his will God uses the evil
[1:54:40] spirit to work out his plan and his will
[1:54:44] I'm going on but you know one time in
[1:54:47] the Bible there was a man that was
[1:54:50] sinning in the church he was sleeping
[1:54:54] with his mother-in-law
[1:54:56] that's just downright wrong sleeping
[1:55:03] with it it's in the book of Corinthians
[1:55:04] he was sleeping with his mother-in-law
[1:55:06] and and Paul had to set things straight
[1:55:09] Paul had to set it straight said no you
[1:55:12] don't you don't do nothing like that and
[1:55:13] and just let him come to church or just
[1:55:15] let him just you know no no no no no no
[1:55:17] we got to get this thing straight right
[1:55:18] so so Paul Paul Paul said said what
[1:55:22] y'all need to do is turn him loose
[1:55:24] turn him over to the devil and what
[1:55:27] happens that God will God will relief in
[1:55:30] evil spirits own that may say you know
[1:55:33] what happened we cover people too much
[1:55:35] under the blood we cut them under the
[1:55:38] blood so our prayers come sometimes some
[1:55:40] people you gotta stop praying for when
[1:55:44] you don't turn them over to God let God
[1:55:46] handle it and say say what God would do
[1:55:48] yield he'll release an evil spirit to go
[1:55:52] bring that person right back to where
[1:55:53] they supposed to be evil spirit will
[1:55:57] chase them later on that same man that
[1:56:01] they did that to over the next chapter
[1:56:03] the next book he repented and he was
[1:56:05] back in line after an evil spirit come
[1:56:07] on oh that happened brother band have
[1:56:09] talked about I'm going but you know he
[1:56:13] talked about how this church did that
[1:56:14] one time that the son preaches boy
[1:56:19] sometimes preachers have a lot of
[1:56:21] problems but the preachers boy had had a
[1:56:24] problem with his daddy in and he didn't
[1:56:26] want to get things right and the daddy
[1:56:28] tried to talk to him I know I'm making
[1:56:30] that right they went some other deacons
[1:56:31] Western I ain't making nothing right I
[1:56:33] don't care I'm not doing it
[1:56:34] they've tried to talk to him about what
[1:56:36] he was doing it was wrong and and so the
[1:56:39] daddy came and said I'd give that boy
[1:56:40] just such a such a time to come come
[1:56:42] back to church and make that thing right
[1:56:44] if he don't we gonna turn him over to
[1:56:45] the Lord his own boy and he stood up
[1:56:49] there they gave they looked at the watch
[1:56:50] okay as at this point in time we turn in
[1:56:54] store and so over to the Lord everybody
[1:56:56] start praying for him his own boy say
[1:56:59] all of a sudden few weeks go by few
[1:57:02] months go by boy ends up in the hospital
[1:57:06] and when he got to the hospital doctors
[1:57:08] had no idea what was going wrong with
[1:57:10] big trying to figure we don't understand
[1:57:12] what's going on go get his daddy well
[1:57:15] what what what does daddy got to do it
[1:57:16] is we gotta try to figure the gold get
[1:57:18] his daddy
[1:57:19] you know what just go get his daddy
[1:57:22] daddy come to the room doctors walk out
[1:57:27] daddy I'm sorry that's what he was up at
[1:57:33] the back going on about his business
[1:57:35] had he not repented he would have died
[1:57:37] right there then let me tell you
[1:57:39] something God got a weird getting hold
[1:57:40] of people he can give you a dream if you
[1:57:43] neglect the dream you got other ways you
[1:57:46] can put your flat on your back and
[1:57:47] you'll be calling for somebody would
[1:57:50] y'all come pray for me cuz ya'll believe
[1:57:51] in divine healing brother Branham used
[1:57:54] to had in prayer cloths anybody got one
[1:58:00] of course yes of course
[1:58:10] because I got a evil spirit I'm here to
[1:58:14] help you
[1:58:14] and I realize a number the devil made
[1:58:17] you do what you did that ain't Jude
[1:58:19] that's the devil ain't coming against
[1:58:22] you I'm coming against the devil I love
[1:58:25] what brother Shawn I said he said I
[1:58:27] ain't picking on you I'm picking off you
[1:58:33] so I'm back over here how evil spirits
[1:58:36] can come from the Lord
[1:58:36] yeah y'all bear with me and I'm gonna
[1:58:39] read this and I think I got one more
[1:58:40] quote to read and I'm I'm just it's all
[1:58:43] chopped up I feel but nonetheless I
[1:58:46] think that the message got home all
[1:58:48] right look at this and and evil spirit
[1:58:51] income would come from the Lord but it
[1:58:53] has a purpose for doing that let's read
[1:58:55] first first Kings 22 let's start at
[1:58:57] verse 13 a man anytime you see a man
[1:59:01] something like this occurring God is
[1:59:04] doing that for a reason is to work out
[1:59:06] his wheel a man is to work out his will
[1:59:09] so here it says in verse 13 the
[1:59:14] messenger that was going to call Micaiah
[1:59:17] and just to step this up a little bit
[1:59:20] they had already a have want to go to
[1:59:23] battle and he had all these prophets
[1:59:25] about 400 of them come up and they they
[1:59:28] were saying and even even Jehoshaphat
[1:59:30] was with them so the two kings of Israel
[1:59:32] was divided but here the two kings
[1:59:35] Jonathan here a habit come together and
[1:59:37] they decided they're gonna go to battle
[1:59:39] together Jehoshaphat you know he should
[1:59:41] have prayed first before he got out
[1:59:42] there right but here he didn't pray
[1:59:44] first and and then he actually acts
[1:59:47] before you got involved if we got
[1:59:48] connected as he should have prayed first
[1:59:50] but before I went to Bali say is there a
[1:59:53] prophet that we can hear and four
[1:59:56] hundred I'm coming let's dance the Lord
[1:59:58] you know all I mean just my god you can
[2:00:01] imagine the service that they had let's
[2:00:03] tell the Lord you're gonna destroy take
[2:00:05] these horns with us you can destroy
[2:00:06] you're gonna do this to time do that
[2:00:07] you're gonna be victorious and 400 of
[2:00:10] them said the exact same thing so
[2:00:11] hostile that said wait a minute 400 men
[2:00:14] saying the exact same thing something
[2:00:16] wrong with this picture he actually
[2:00:19] means it at least one more profit
[2:00:21] and they have tried to hide that profit
[2:00:24] evil spirits try to hide that profit I
[2:00:28] mean I yeah there is one but I hate him
[2:00:32] evil spirit will hate truth I hate him
[2:00:37] you hate him why cuz everytime we
[2:00:40] prophesy he always prophesied against me
[2:00:43] every time you know I'm just letting you
[2:00:48] know right now watch this man gonna be
[2:00:50] against us everybody else that go this
[2:00:53] men gonna be against us just go get him
[2:00:54] let's pick it up and the messenger that
[2:00:59] was going to call mkhaya 70m saying
[2:01:02] behold now the words of the Prophet
[2:01:03] declared good unto the king with one
[2:01:05] mouth
[2:01:06] let thy word I pray thee be like the
[2:01:07] word of one of them and speak that which
[2:01:09] is good so see there coaching him on
[2:01:11] what to say but a true prophet don't say
[2:01:15] what men tell him to say and micaiah
[2:01:19] said as the Lord liveth what the Lord
[2:01:22] saith unto me that will I speak so he
[2:01:25] came to the king and the King said unto
[2:01:26] enter him macaé shall we go against
[2:01:29] ramoth-gilead to battle or shall we
[2:01:30] forbear and he answered him go and
[2:01:33] prosper for the Lord shall deliver it
[2:01:34] into the hand of the other king notice I
[2:01:37] mean he just ain't even pray about it
[2:01:39] none yet going prosper now you know what
[2:01:42] something coming out of McKay's mouth
[2:01:44] even 1/2 knew even a hab knew that that
[2:01:50] one right look at what happened here it
[2:01:53] says I go across for the Lord shall
[2:01:55] deliver them to enter unto the hand of
[2:01:57] the king and the King said unto Him how
[2:01:59] many times shall i adjure thee that thou
[2:02:02] tell me nothing but that which is true
[2:02:04] in the name of the Lord now he notice he
[2:02:06] never used the name of the Lord just
[2:02:09] going prosper oh my god verse 17 he said
[2:02:16] I saw all Israel scattered apartment
[2:02:18] Hill as a sheep that have not a shepherd
[2:02:19] and the Lord said these have no master
[2:02:22] let them return every man to his house
[2:02:24] in peace and the king of Israel said of
[2:02:28] Jehoshaphat did I not tell thee that he
[2:02:32] would prophesy no good
[2:02:34] concerning me but evil see some people
[2:02:38] are like going to churches like that
[2:02:39] where they're gonna get told the truth
[2:02:40] [Music]
[2:02:44] and they said here thou therefore the
[2:02:46] word of Lord I saw the Lord sitting on
[2:02:48] the throne his throne and all the host
[2:02:50] of heaven standing by him on his right
[2:02:52] hand and on his left all the hosts of
[2:02:54] heaven all the angels everything there
[2:02:56] look at this and the Lord said who shall
[2:02:58] persuade a hat that he may go up and
[2:03:01] fall that Rhema feel yet there was a
[2:03:03] scripture that was already promised for
[2:03:05] this to happen right he was already it
[2:03:07] was spoken against that I mean the dogs
[2:03:09] gonna lick up his blood and all of the
[2:03:11] kind of stuff would happen some kind of
[2:03:12] way that had to be that had to come to
[2:03:14] pass and in order for God's Word to be
[2:03:17] fulfilled evil spirit made it happen and
[2:03:22] for evil spirit made it happen in the
[2:03:24] days of 8 1/2 if an evil spirit made it
[2:03:27] happen in the days of Saul to get him
[2:03:28] off the throne and evil spirit will come
[2:03:30] along the day it comes people to fall
[2:03:32] away let me go on verse verse 20 says
[2:03:40] the Lord said who should persuade II
[2:03:42] have that he may go up and follow that
[2:03:44] ramoth-gilead in one setting mr. banner
[2:03:46] and another set on that manner and there
[2:03:48] came forth a spirit and stood before the
[2:03:53] Lord and said I will persuade him and
[2:03:56] the Lord said unto Him where with let me
[2:04:01] tell you let me just drop this off with
[2:04:02] y'all it's not that God didn't know how
[2:04:05] to get this done just understand how
[2:04:09] things happen in the spiritual realm
[2:04:11] right since then the Lord said unto Him
[2:04:13] where with and he said I will go forth
[2:04:15] and I would be a lying spirit and the
[2:04:17] mouth of all his prophets what one
[2:04:21] spirit of knowing that 400 prophets I
[2:04:23] would be a lying spirit in the mouth of
[2:04:26] all his prophets and he said thou shalt
[2:04:28] persuade them and prevail also go forth
[2:04:31] and do so got permission from God the
[2:04:34] lion spirit needed permission the evil
[2:04:36] spirit can I tell y'all something when
[2:04:38] y'all going through stuff on your job
[2:04:41] them spirits got permission
[2:04:47] got permission before they even came to
[2:04:49] you they had permission and the reason
[2:04:53] God allowed them because you were just
[2:04:55] like Jobe in his eyes go ahead and do it
[2:04:58] go ahead and do it they will not curse
[2:05:00] me the devil can't do nothing to you
[2:05:06] without God's permission and then when
[2:05:10] he do it
[2:05:11] let me tell you another thing he got
[2:05:12] boundaries stopping points say you can
[2:05:21] you can you can touch his family you can
[2:05:23] touch this but you can't act his life
[2:05:24] you can get sick but you can't take his
[2:05:27] life stopping points
[2:05:31] verse 23 now therefore behold the LORD
[2:05:36] hath put a lying spirit look at that the
[2:05:38] Bible say the LORD hath put a lying
[2:05:40] spirit in the mouth of all these that
[2:05:41] prophets now it was a notice micaiah
[2:05:44] stand the Lord put this spirit there no
[2:05:46] the spirit actual permission and God
[2:05:47] said you can have permission just like
[2:05:51] brother Branham gave permission for them
[2:05:52] at the Epilepsy to go into them
[2:05:54] twenty-eight people if we behold the
[2:05:58] Lord hath put a lying spirit in the
[2:06:00] mouth of all these my prophets and the
[2:06:01] Lord has spoken evil concerning thee but
[2:06:03] Zedekiah the son of Janina went near to
[2:06:06] see he if I'm not mistaken yeah this is
[2:06:09] the one that he said Akaya
[2:06:11] is the one that had his forms you find
[2:06:13] him in verse 11 he had the horns he had
[2:06:15] did something so magnificent and now now
[2:06:17] now he'd been told that he was a liar a
[2:06:19] line prophet so look at what the line
[2:06:22] prophecy a seal Spirit will hit you
[2:06:34] strike you down with an ax consumption -
[2:06:43] jimana went near and spoke Macario on
[2:06:47] the cheek and said which way to went the
[2:06:49] spirit little hard for me to speak unto
[2:06:51] thee you can tell you ain't got the
[2:06:54] right spear you hittin preaches you
[2:06:55] didn't hit the prophets you know you
[2:06:58] ain't got the right spirit you know this
[2:07:00] ain't come from God my guys never hold
[2:07:06] thou shalt see in that day when thou
[2:07:07] shalt go into inner chamber the heart
[2:07:09] that still and the king of Israel said
[2:07:11] take Makai and carry him back I'm - I'm
[2:07:13] on the governor of the city and and -
[2:07:16] joash the king's son and say thus sayeth
[2:07:19] the king put this fellow in in the
[2:07:21] prison and feed him with bread of
[2:07:23] affliction and with water of affliction
[2:07:24] until I come in peace now hey you know
[2:07:27] he figured he would punish him for
[2:07:29] speaking thus saith the Lord
[2:07:31] you don't know when when the pastor's
[2:07:34] speak through people try to punish the
[2:07:35] past
[2:07:43] all right I hope you can read between
[2:07:45] their lives look I got other ways we got
[2:07:51] to just see what God says say what it's
[2:07:53] worth seeing right man what kind of
[2:07:55] church you want to go to a church with
[2:07:56] sinking huh a church where people just
[2:07:58] do whatever they want to do and only way
[2:08:00] the hell amen being I have no no no
[2:08:06] praise the Lord I'm being nice today I'm
[2:08:10] being real nice today but I see
[2:08:12] everything I ain't crazy I'm being nice
[2:08:16] I'm being hospitable but I see
[2:08:23] everything hallelujah glory to God and
[2:08:28] like I said I'm getting rid of Eastern
[2:08:32] bread of affliction he came ready to go
[2:08:34] to prison he gave me and he still won't
[2:08:35] stop talking like I said if thou return
[2:08:40] at all in peace the Lord have not spoken
[2:08:42] about me and it's that harken of people
[2:08:45] every one of you on his way to prison
[2:08:47] pretty much terms that you're gonna make
[2:08:49] it back from the battle and and what my
[2:08:50] kind said you're going to read they have
[2:08:53] died in the battle even trying to
[2:08:55] disguise himself but God saw and had an
[2:09:00] arrow just come out of nowhere and he
[2:09:03] died fulfilling the Word of God and an
[2:09:05] evil spirit helped bring that thing to
[2:09:08] pass so I see a great falling away it's
[2:09:12] an evil spirit helping to bring that
[2:09:14] thing to pass I want to just read one
[2:09:16] quote cat alone kind of lengthy but I
[2:09:22] think it would be very helpful this is
[2:09:24] out of the message
[2:09:26] Ephesians sure change and I want y'all
[2:09:29] to see something this brother branham
[2:09:30] brought something out there and I'm just
[2:09:32] gonna read it I'm gonna try not to make
[2:09:33] too many comments but hopefully you can
[2:09:35] have your spiritual you can see right in
[2:09:36] there and and pick up on these things no
[2:09:40] less I have somewhat against these
[2:09:42] quoting revelation 2 4 nevertheless I
[2:09:44] have somewhat against thee because thou
[2:09:46] hast left thy first love to understand
[2:09:48] this you must realize that the Spirit is
[2:09:51] not speaking to the original Saints in
[2:09:53] Ephesus alone
[2:09:54] when it's when we're talking about
[2:09:55] Ephesians two I'm sorry revelation two
[2:09:58] for that scripture nevertheless I have
[2:10:00] somewhat against it because left that
[2:10:02] first level the Spirit was not just
[2:10:04] speaking to those in Ephesians church
[2:10:06] age all right this was this was a
[2:10:09] message actually coming all the way down
[2:10:11] to our age now look at this nevertheless
[2:10:13] I have somewhat against thee because
[2:10:14] thou has left that first love to
[2:10:15] understand this time must realize that
[2:10:17] the Spirit is not speaking to the
[2:10:18] original sex of Ephesus as long this
[2:10:20] message is to the entire age which
[2:10:23] lasted about 120 years its message then
[2:10:25] is to all the generations in that span
[2:10:28] now history keeps repeating itself and
[2:10:33] the generations of Israel we see revival
[2:10:36] in one generation only to see the fires
[2:10:39] fading in the next in the third
[2:10:40] generation embers maybe glowing slightly
[2:10:43] but in the fourth there being there
[2:10:45] there may be no vestige whatsoever of
[2:10:48] that original flame okay all right y'all
[2:10:53] start counting generations from the time
[2:10:55] the Prophet was here to where we are
[2:10:57] right now and see what's going on I mean
[2:11:00] it's getting to a point where people
[2:11:02] trying to actually act as if God never
[2:11:06] sent a prophet if they could erase his
[2:11:10] name they would that's an evil spirit
[2:11:14] thank God even people in denominations
[2:11:17] acknowledge they acknowledge his
[2:11:22] ministry but here you got people are
[2:11:24] still my god and so I'm Betsy the people
[2:11:27] that were close to there at that time
[2:11:28] what they saw is not what we saw we're
[2:11:31] believing it just based on what we heard
[2:11:33] right but but there were some people
[2:11:35] that saw some things that you'll never
[2:11:37] be able to convince them you'll never be
[2:11:39] able to convince but as that group is
[2:11:41] dying off there's another group coming
[2:11:42] up and the ones that unfortunate did not
[2:11:45] get a chance to experience it they're
[2:11:47] fading they're fading and you know
[2:11:50] whereas the generations go by is gonna
[2:11:52] be more and more fading all right stay
[2:11:55] with me stay with me
[2:11:57] not everybody gonna fade and the fourth
[2:11:59] generation a man but in the fourth there
[2:12:02] may be no vestige whatsoever of that
[2:12:04] original thing then God lights the fire
[2:12:08] so even though it might fade this is
[2:12:10] what I'm looking for God to light the
[2:12:12] fire again amen so thank God likes to
[2:12:18] fire again and the same process is
[2:12:21] repeated it is simply the manifestation
[2:12:25] of the truth that God has no
[2:12:26] grandchildren salvation is not passed on
[2:12:30] by natural birth any more than is there
[2:12:34] any truth to apostolic succession it
[2:12:36] isn't in the word you start out with the
[2:12:39] truly born again believers and when the
[2:12:41] next generation comes along they're no
[2:12:43] longer just plain Christians but they
[2:12:45] have taken a denominational name and are
[2:12:47] now Baptist Methodist etc that is
[2:12:50] exactly what they are - they are not
[2:12:53] Christians you have to be born of the
[2:12:55] will of God not the will of man to be
[2:12:56] saved but these folks are all all coming
[2:12:59] together now by the will of man I don't
[2:13:01] say that some of them aren't right with
[2:13:03] God not for a minute do I say that but
[2:13:06] the original fire ain't staying right
[2:13:10] with Garland yeah you may love God but
[2:13:12] the original fire guy has died down and
[2:13:18] they're not the same anymore
[2:13:22] can I just keep reading the fervent
[2:13:25] desire to please God the passion to know
[2:13:28] his word the cry for reaching out in the
[2:13:31] spirit all begins to fade instead of
[2:13:33] that church being on fire with God it
[2:13:35] has cooled off and become a bit formal
[2:13:37] that is what is happening that is what
[2:13:39] was happening back there to the
[2:13:40] Ephesians they were getting a bit
[2:13:42] formula the abandonment to God was dying
[2:13:44] out and the people weren't too careful
[2:13:46] about what God thought to them as they
[2:13:48] began to be careful about what the world
[2:13:49] thought of them people don't want to be
[2:13:54] identified as Christians anymore they
[2:13:56] just want to go right along with the
[2:13:57] rest of the world amen my god sisters
[2:14:01] want to put on the pants and wear to
[2:14:03] make wear the earrings they want to be
[2:14:05] like the world glory to God look around
[2:14:07] look around look around we don't do that
[2:14:10] amen
[2:14:11] right I mean and it's just it's a shame
[2:14:14] you know you know when you start you
[2:14:17] start seeing this spirit just kind of
[2:14:18] released amongst the people right you
[2:14:20] start seeing
[2:14:21] that's not that's not who you are that's
[2:14:24] never been who you are you won't accept
[2:14:26] it from the world you'll never get it
[2:14:27] from the church never cuz we don't
[2:14:30] believe that amen praise the Lord I mean
[2:14:35] I see stuff posted on Instagram I'm not
[2:14:38] liking that I'm not liking that you in
[2:14:42] pants ain't got nothing to say on that
[2:14:45] but pray that's what I do I pray when I
[2:14:47] see stuff like that somebody I mean here
[2:14:50] you know the pastor following you you
[2:14:55] know that why you gonna post something
[2:14:57] like that
[2:14:57] somebody posting curse words and stuff
[2:15:00] the pastor following you other believers
[2:15:03] are following you
[2:15:05] you want us to read that nonsense you
[2:15:09] need to watch what you post if you can't
[2:15:13] do it for yourself do it for others and
[2:15:17] if you can't handle it thing why don't
[2:15:19] you just get off line and what you're
[2:15:22] telling me is you can't stop following
[2:15:24] me I can do that but the Holy Ghost
[2:15:26] won't stop calling you and he can do a
[2:15:30] lot more damage than I can and when you
[2:15:33] end up flat on your back somewhere then
[2:15:37] then let's see if you stand tell the
[2:15:39] pastor to stop following me y'all better
[2:15:46] stop playing with God
[2:15:50] you have to live a life 24/7 never I'm
[2:15:57] coming home I'm coming home these some
[2:15:59] time I got to do things like this I love
[2:16:01] I love I love this I love God and I love
[2:16:06] helping God's people a man look I'm
[2:16:08] going on I see he said there is exactly
[2:16:11] what they are - they're they're not
[2:16:13] Christians you have to you have to be
[2:16:14] born of the will of God not the will of
[2:16:16] man to be saved but these folks are all
[2:16:19] coming together now by the will of man I
[2:16:20] don't say that some of them are not
[2:16:22] right with God not for a minute do I say
[2:16:24] that but the original fire has died down
[2:16:25] they're not the same anymore
[2:16:28] oh I'm fun that's okay needed to say it
[2:16:32] again the fervent desire to please God
[2:16:34] the passion to know his word the cry for
[2:16:36] reaching out and the spirit all begins
[2:16:38] begins to fade and instead of that the
[2:16:39] church being on fire with but with the
[2:16:41] fire of God it has cooled off from
[2:16:43] become a bit formal that is what was
[2:16:45] happening back there to the Ephesians
[2:16:47] they were getting a bit form of the
[2:16:48] abandonment to God was dying out and the
[2:16:49] people weren't too careful about what
[2:16:51] God thought of them as they began to be
[2:16:53] careful about what the world thought of
[2:16:54] him thus that second generation coming
[2:16:57] on was just like Israel they demanded a
[2:16:59] king list that they demanded a king to
[2:17:02] be like the other nations my god
[2:17:05] you know they demanded a king to be like
[2:17:11] the other nations the brother branham
[2:17:13] told us how to do Church 20 I'll stay
[2:17:16] with me they were just kind of fold this
[2:17:17] right here brother branham told us how
[2:17:20] to do church order he told us to give a
[2:17:22] song leader up there let the song leader
[2:17:25] sing a few songs didn't agree to come
[2:17:27] out and and all those things like that
[2:17:29] he didn't tell us to have a priest team
[2:17:32] you know what appraised income from
[2:17:34] looking at other churches and see we
[2:17:37] want to we want to em and and what what
[2:17:40] happens eventually go from the praise
[2:17:42] teams do we have the sisters leading the
[2:17:44] service and if you don't stop there you
[2:17:48] have the sisters preaching free the Lord
[2:17:51] so somewhere you got to have a stopping
[2:17:53] point and we're not gonna cross this
[2:17:55] line but oftentimes we look at what
[2:17:57] other people do and you
[2:17:58] and tell me the circus this song sir is
[2:18:00] not anointed we ain't got no wind got no
[2:18:02] praise team but it's still anointed well
[2:18:06] what's the matter what happened praise
[2:18:08] team you go ahead we just not doing it
[2:18:12] here what's the matter with not
[2:18:17] happening what's the matter what doing
[2:18:23] it the way the prophecy man Lorna God

[2:18:30] dance team it stopped being just a
[2:18:34] little you know people up in worship and

[2:18:37] and we got choreographed dance sin we
[2:18:40] got all those things

[2:18:44] here no we don't we do not there would
[2:18:47] be no praise dancing none now I mean

[2:21:37] holes in the carpet from that song
[2:21:40] y'all know shouting one of the oldest
[2:21:42] oldest ways of worshipping God
[2:21:45] that there was I'm talk about before we
[2:21:49] even came to earth because the question
[2:21:53] was asked where was that when the sons
[2:21:56] of God shouted for joy and the morning
[2:22:01] stars sing together so don't let nobody
[2:22:03] take your shout if there ever was a time
[2:22:06] to shout this is the time now yeah if

[2:23:03] boy y'all would be able to stop me I'm
[2:23:05] gonna let y'all know right now that
[2:23:06] maybe that's why God didn't give me one
[2:23:08] because I I will disrupt the service
[2:23:12] hallelujah
[2:23:14] sometimes you know and you see other
[2:23:15] people shout it just you try to get a
[2:23:21] little piece of hallelujah
[2:23:25] alright let me finish this up Church
[2:23:27] come on come on come on
[2:23:29] hallelujah where was I had on that quote
[2:23:38] man the king
[2:23:51] I see thank you very much so that was it
[2:24:00] the second generation was coming on I
[2:24:03] was just like Israel okay
[2:24:07] are they demanded King to be like the
[2:24:09] other nations when they did that they
[2:24:11] rejected God but they did it anyway now
[2:24:14] when they started trying to be like
[2:24:15] everybody else
[2:24:16] they actually rejected God that's some
[2:24:19] evil spirit don't realize the heights
[2:24:21] but they rejected God but they did it
[2:24:24] anyway that is the history of the church
[2:24:26] when it thinks more of conforming to the
[2:24:29] world instead of conforming to God it is
[2:24:31] that long until you see them stop doing
[2:24:33] the things they used to do and start
[2:24:36] doing things they wouldn't do initially
[2:24:39] you will never see some people wearing
[2:24:42] pants never still wearing makeup and see
[2:24:45] I got a message that I got a preach on
[2:24:47] that about conviction right because that
[2:24:50] people lose that conviction now but they
[2:24:52] do have it because when they get around
[2:24:54] you like old Lord they get right they
[2:24:57] try to avoid you and all the other kind
[2:24:58] of stuff because they do have some type
[2:25:00] of conviction when people stop calling
[2:25:02] you they don't want to hang out with you
[2:25:04] no more something going wrong somewhere
[2:25:06] Amen because they know you ain't gone
[2:25:08] you ain't gonna put look look if garden
[2:25:10] gave me nothing else if I don't even
[2:25:12] understand the message I know that
[2:25:14] dressing like that ain't right
[2:25:17] glory to God hallelujah
[2:25:20] hey man hallelujah we don't dress that
[2:25:24] way not the sisters from this church not
[2:25:28] under this pastor we don't dress that
[2:25:31] way amen glory to God let the church say
[2:25:38] man somebody's hey man
[2:25:45] so yeah if you want me to sing it I sing
[2:25:47] it to you they put in a choir instead of
[2:25:51] singing on the Gulf in themselves they
[2:25:54] put gowns on the choir they organized a
[2:25:56] moment and ran and ran it by man they
[2:25:59] soon began to read books
[2:26:00] what read books that weren't fit to read
[2:26:05] they stopped reading a Bible they read
[2:26:07] another stuff right let's read books or
[2:26:09] if I could just say they read websites
[2:26:11] they go to websites that they should be
[2:26:13] going to spiritual websites stay there
[2:26:16] stay there stay there I'm going on with
[2:26:17] the stay some began to read books that
[2:26:20] weren't fit to read they let down the
[2:26:21] bars and ghosts came in and took over
[2:26:23] the cry of joy was gone the freedom of
[2:26:25] the Spirit was gone
[2:26:26] oh they kept on with the form but the
[2:26:30] fire had died down and the blackness of
[2:26:33] ashes is about all that is left
[2:26:35] paragraph 89 - - is where I met a few
[2:26:40] moments ago I mentioned that John
[2:26:41] understood what it was to love God that
[2:26:45] great apostle of love would certainly
[2:26:48] see it when the church began to lose
[2:26:50] that first love of God and first John
[2:26:52] 5:3 he says for this is a love of God
[2:26:54] that we keep his Commandments his word
[2:26:57] one little deviation from that word was
[2:27:00] a step away from Christ let me say it
[2:27:02] again
[2:27:03] one little deviation from that word was
[2:27:07] a step away from Christ so often people
[2:27:09] think they're going to find Christ you
[2:27:11] actually just left them and what happens
[2:27:14] that you don't have to go pick them up
[2:27:17] where you're left people say they love
[2:27:21] God they go to church they even shout
[2:27:24] and rejoice and sing and have a great
[2:27:27] emotional time but when it's all over
[2:27:29] watch and see if they are in that word
[2:27:31] walking in it living in it if they go
[2:27:35] through all the other and then don't
[2:27:37] walk in that word they can say they love
[2:27:39] God but their lives tell another story
[2:27:42] I wonder if John didn't see a lot of
[2:27:44] that before he died people saying they
[2:27:46] love God but not obeying his word oh the
[2:27:50] Ephesian Church something is happening
[2:27:53] to you someone is trying to either add
[2:27:55] to that word or
[2:27:57] take from it but they are doing it so
[2:27:59] subtly that you can't see it they
[2:28:02] haven't made a move so big you can see
[2:28:04] it out there in the open it is under
[2:28:06] cover and they're bringing it by way of
[2:28:09] reason and human understanding and it
[2:28:12] will take over unless you refuse it go
[2:28:16] back to Pentecost before it's too late
[2:28:20] that is an evil spirit of unbelief that
[2:28:24] is coming in so subtle and destroying so
[2:28:27] quickly Church I advise you a man like
[2:28:33] the proper setting this first quote that
[2:28:34] we read so you've got to be versed to
[2:28:35] know what you're doing or you could take
[2:28:37] an evil spirit so easy and not know if
[2:28:39] it's contrary to the word don't believe
[2:28:41] it you stay with that word god bless you
[2:28:45] let's pray father this is a hour that's
[2:28:52] so series and how the Holy Spirit wants
[2:28:57] to continue to warn the church there's
[2:29:01] an evil spirit and as we just brought
[2:29:05] out sometimes that that that spirit has
[2:29:07] to get permission from God in order to
[2:29:09] be able to produce the fulfillment of
[2:29:15] Scripture we can see it all around us
[2:29:19] not only see it all around us but we are
[2:29:21] impacted by what we see loved ones that
[2:29:24] are impacted some that just do not know
[2:29:27] what the devil is doing but God help us
[2:29:30] to to receive revelation and instruction
[2:29:32] that in doing so we would be able to
[2:29:35] withstand and discern the attack of the
[2:29:38] enemy in this hour I'm so glad that uh
[2:29:44] Saul
[2:29:46] might have had that evil spirit a Saul
[2:29:49] still made it so glad that but your
[2:29:53] profit share these things with us that
[2:29:55] we could have hope in this tower God we
[2:29:58] we won't give up hope even when we're
[2:30:01] gets hope we still believe in hope help
[2:30:04] us
[2:30:05] to stand firm understand true on the
[2:30:08] Word of God not to isolate a separate
[2:30:10] ourselves but to continue to be who
[2:30:12] you've called us to be and Father and
[2:30:15] being that that we might win some to
[2:30:18] Christ we trust Lord that something was
[2:30:22] said hearts would be edified hearts
[2:30:26] would be a man
[2:30:28] Lord Fayette and Lord Jesus we could we
[2:30:32] could we could walk out of here and that
[2:30:33] we got could take warning to these
[2:30:36] things that are going on all around us
[2:30:38] if there's one that's not living the way
[2:30:40] that they're supposed to be living amen
[2:30:42] and your presence Lord let him take
[2:30:43] warning to these things help us look to
[2:30:47] align ourselves but the hour is too late
[2:30:49] for us to play games with the devil it's
[2:30:51] time to live right we must live right
[2:30:55] some Jesus name we pray amen amen
[2:31:03] thank you Jesus
[2:31:07] glory to God
[2:31:10] amen
[2:31:16] amen
