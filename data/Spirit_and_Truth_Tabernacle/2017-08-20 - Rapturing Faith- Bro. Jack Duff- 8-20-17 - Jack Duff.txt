don't mind [Applause] hear me okay this song I'm going to sing was written by brother Andrew it's called 40 souls and it's about 40 Christians who are about to become martyrs for their faith they were forced to stand out I believe on a frozen pond to freeze to death and one of the Christians became overwhelmed with facing death and retreated he surrendered and denounced his faith and one of the soldiers who was standing there saw the faith of the 39 and was instantly converted and went on to take on the punishment along with the other 39 to become the 40th one who would actually give up his life for his faith so this song is about becoming like that soldier to see the face of others and to enter into that faith and to give my all for what I believe in so that's what this song is about I pray it's a blessing to you I believe the words are in the system I think the song is called forth 40 soldiers [Music] forty soul bound in whole hearts of flame for their thing one a coward one a shame he leaves and it is to me don't even know his name lest I fall lest I flee me let's meet me for me for me [Music] let me say let me be like the soldier who falls to with me fall to his knees for

you've given us Lord just to be able to gather in your house and just feel your presence but as the songs are going forth and lore even the special has gone forth about the 40 soldiers Lord God reacts

closing that won't be nobody else coming in but they're gonna be crying out giving you and it's going to be too late he that's filthy it's filthy still he there's holy as holy ain't that's righteousness righteous still and we're at that time that doors about to close and I get so concerned you know I look at my children and just speaking about the rapture knowing that only those with the Holy Ghost are going at that time and I want to add my sphere where they can be under the anointing whether the Lord God can just move in not just here but at home I just want them to have him and

songs like that and the unfortunate thing is many of them just don't have the truth that we have and they could they could see it and put it in song but not actually experiencing and but we are people that are a man a children generation a royal priesthood an holy nation and songs like this a man of songs they're written for us and not just us the same but for us to act on it man for us to enjoy if

sister Rebekah and sister Rachel thank you all so much for that and praise the Lord so just a couple other announcements that I need to make mention of one is I'm glad to be back home we had a wonderful time out in Tucson Arizona on last last week and just you know opportunity minister in the Word of God and also in song and and we just enjoyed ourselves a man and I brother Steven went out with me he was a just a ram in the bush told the pastor there said you don't have to worry about coming to pick us up and and do this and do that say brother Steven got a car and we're gonna be alright hello and and and brother Steven proved to say we say we're gonna be ready at this time he'd be there five ten minutes before we ready and and and ready just it's taken me in brother Diggs and brother Brooks you know so is a real real blessing a man just just to be there and we're very grateful but there Caleb and his wife's and the greetings to them and the church and they're hoping that when they do it again that more Saints to be able to come out and enjoy themselves there so just a there were a couple testimonies that were shared there and I'm hoping to get them and bring them back here because I thought they were very significant to some things that we had gone through and and I got a call of this brother to get all the details you know of it but I was I was really blessed by some things that I heard a man while we while we were there and I'll try to make sure I get that and bring it to you a couple things that'll be happening here you all heard the announcements on next week but let's go having the combined meeting for the churches that will be there for the West Coast Church on next next Sunday night so don't forget that I mentioned that I want to do questions and answers a man session and we got some questions that were given to us so on this Friday night this Friday night we will be doing the questions and answers a man on this Friday night so keep that in mind amen also I want to you all heard about brother for the brown a man and his celebration I think I got about five people that have come to me to say that they are going and announcement saying if you are planning to go to let me know so at this time I'm only expecting five right so if y'all going I need to know that don't assume that I know that I don't have that kind of discernment amen so five people so far so if you're going you need to let me know one get word to me quickly X or something just just let me know that that you're going so I can let the church know up there and those that are going a man and those if you can't go but you still want to be a part of it I was getting as a church I don't know why this is just going in and out on me it might be channel something I can't leave I could get this other one other mic here um but I was I was just thinking to my myself that we would as a church as a church maybe we can now give an offering amen towards this they have some expenses that are that are coming up amen okay I'm taking up the service over there and I know I would be I know comfy so no va voom capital equal-to Mohammed and say I wanna Blodgett senior woman cell community that's what about this one I won't have that problem I can guarantee you that a man yeah well they gotta be changed on both sides but that's fine and and also I just give this one to them as well they can change that one as well praise the Lord God is good so I was thinking that we as a church could maybe give an offering to help with some of the expenses amen there for what they're going to do for the brown there's a number of things not just expenses of the meetings but I told you all the Lord is blessing them with a a brand-new mobile home something brother Brown mr. Brown I've never experienced brother Brown being 90 years old and God wait till he get 92 give him a brand-new house what a god right what a God and you know so I was thinking that maybe we could just give a man towards that and what I'll actually to do if you want to be a part of that just just grab one of the envelopes and just you know write on it for brother Browns a love offering for brother Brown just write on it you can either stick it in the box or or just put an offer but I'm going to try to give something next week you know for them and if you want to be a part of that that blessings and just something Amen and I'll blow them to decide the box and we'll we'll take care of it also I just want to make mention a couple other things here we summertime was a rough time fourth you know the church but we're grateful that God brought us through but as as we're moving back into you know this didn't the next part of the year I'm still asking 37 people to give faithfully a hundred dollars a month and offering 37 people give a hundred dollars a month an offering that'll take care the expenses here in the church so please continue to do that a man that'll be a big help also we have the Sioux City flyer there for Holy Land we're planning on doing that next year of 2018 June 2018 and I'm already receiving deposits for that if you desire to go to the Holy Land in 2018 there's a deposit of 300 dollars that you need to get to me right away and and we got I got to spend that money too brother George so if you want to write a check you write it to believers tours but please if you plan on going to a Holy Land please get with me right away to let me know and we'll need to get the deposit so we can send it on there brother George the cost is everything is there on the board for you if you have any questions please see me now I'll get that for you so we plan on going to Indiana September 3rd is the date that we will be there in Indiana September 1st 2nd and 3rd there's some some flying some driving but uh there'll be a great portion of the church that will be missing I think over two thirds of the church is going to Indiana so with that in mind the Saints that will not be going eh man I certainly wish that everybody could go I know to be a blessing to you but those that will not be going we won't have service on that day September 3rd amen the first Sunday in September we won't have service here at the church because most of the church will be gone so I want to encourage a man those that are that are not going please go to church somewhere don't take that as a holiday right let go go to church whereby the Wesco has service brother smiley has service brother gene has service and oftentimes you get invitations from your family and friends you tell them I can't come well guess what that would be a perfect thing that you can say I can come with you today because you know I don't like to miss my church but since you know our church is not having service I can come with you today so please take advantage of that on the 3rd September 3rd that's that we won't have service here so keep that in mind and for those that are going we have been given the responsibility of on Saturday night they having a singing service a worship service and so I was told they were maybe y'all kissing about a hour and a half of songs y'all think y'all got that in y'all so hour and a half of songs I've kind of already sent out a list a man of the songs that I was thinking you know thinking on for for us some will be with the choir some would just be solos but nonetheless it's something for us too to be able to go out and just be a blessing to the people there a man and not in New Albany so we need for those that are going I need to do some rehearsals and and I was actually hoping that we might be able to get one today and one next Sunday after service that would be very very helpful that way we can you know we can we'll be prepared for what we're doing you know when we go out there but they say they just want to move to the side and they just want us to just just take it and just sing I say well praise the Lord we'll do what the Lord has called us to do so so y'all be prepared if y'all can stay the day after service please do that let's do that today and let's get a couple songs together and and and you know just stuff let the Lord use that alright okay so two other things I need to make mention of a man and one of them a man is that our precious brother wisdom will be he's retired from working naturally and is also retired from song leading and and and he has been serving this church for well over ten years brother wisdom has been so faithful so faithfully he was an answer to prayer for me when we just did not have anybody and I was you know song leading and preaching and doing everything God sent brother wisdom and he stepped in he's just been you know just a real real blessing a man to me and I know to this church he's carried us for a number of years a number of years ladies alone and we were so so happy a man that God has used him for this time and and brother wisdom I really wanted to do more but I got a little something for you that I wanted to present to you a man here just in front of church and socialism you can come with them to receive it so it's the wisdom y'all might not know what she was in the background helping a man brother wisdom with a lot of things and we just we just appreciate them can they get a standing ovation [Applause] so this is something that I just wanted you to have for it for your home it just it's a little Eagle here and says brother Rodrick wisdom and appreciation for your dedicated service in the work of the Lord this is 2017 from Pastor Jack Duff and the Spirit of Truth Tabernacle family a man thank you [Applause] [Applause] praise the Lord thank you brother need a little power but no we thank God and just continue to pray for brother wisdom as well to thank God for all this service and and brother Branham even told us a man that like we have deacons and things of that nature in church they have a term that they serve and an after their term is finished and they have every right to retire all right so we just thank God for the service a man at that brother wisdom has given us in the way of some leading it so you'll see brother Solomon carrying a man a heavier load you know we appreciate him just kind of stepping in and doing that praise the Lord but if anybody know me have a word that I like to use anybody know that where it is replication and and that's not just a song that's even in preaching right I'm believing God either to send gifts or to raise up gifts in this church amen so that we don't have to call people all the time right I mean we got preachers here and we need them to step up raise the Optus right but uh you know I'm believing God for that and I'm believing God for helping the song leading area for brother Solomon as well but I'm one not just I like replication a man in every area I was reading a book recently and or Roberts life story and he made a comment there that that's become of just a theme of mine he said success without a successor is failure success without a successor its failure right so you have to plan properly in order for the church to go to keep going on the church ain't built on a one-person right so when that one person moves on then you got everybody got the kind of step in right that's that's the way it's supposed to be and when it you know I love the way this happen for brother wisdom goes like he didn't just leave and what nobody here no everything was just right everything right when when brother robliz gave us well enough time right say I'm gonna be leaving in a year I'm remember time when he did that people were here to step right into this place that's the way God do things right so so search I'm on the expectation for more preachers a man and more song leaders amen we under expectation for a man God God donut mighty worked with with our musicians we got replication going on there and I just meant I'm just I'm grateful for that so but I like the replication I like seeing a little differences you know and things like that don't don't wait for something drastic to happen before you get involved and man somebody following now I'll do it no no do it before that praise the Lord right so Amen we just we just we just we just we want to see a man dot just moving in all areas other thing I need to announce to you all today we want to welcome a man to spirit and truth Tabernacle brother Jimmy and sister Verna King a man we want to welcome them with his fellowship praise the Lord we thank God formed we got some history lots of history amen and you know we just we just thank God as the Lord has let them to take fellowship amen here and we just we just welcomed them as part of this family a man so you see them around you know that a man this is business brother Jimmy and sister Verna they got some chilling to that we expect them to be sitting right there next [Applause] hallelujah but we thank God for God bless you god bless you you know there was something else with brother si would you look in my office I think it's on the table right next to where this little printing table I got a card on that table that I need to read amen to you but we just man God is so good we are coming to the end of our church age study for Sunday school as well as for our Wednesday night services and just letting everybody know I'm fill in land to go back in through it again and the purpose is we have some for Sunday school there was something that did not get the opportunity to to get in at the beginning and then they came in towards the end but they didn't get in at the beginning so we're going to take them through that you know again the dinners there's others also that have been joining us online and we just kind of released this what we're doing periscope and we kind of did that at the beginning I mean towards the the the ending part of it but we've been getting a lot of comments and people just saying how they've been blessed by you know the what they've been learning online so we want to do that and we also expect them just to lose some new Saints that will be here in fellowship so we just you know everything new we want to kind of start afresh again I think that's it yes thank you and so we'll we'll start that again and I'll just let you know exactly what I know certainly by the first of the year is our plan to get that to get that started all right this is a thank you card says our thanks to you says to the spirit and truth Tabernacle Church family with warmest thanks grateful hearts and deep appreciation for your thoughtfulness me and my family are so grateful for all you all did for us you all did a beautiful job with the repast everyone was talking about how nice everything was and how how good all served everyone the singing was wonderful in all the kind thing said about pop I love all of you who came and supported us no one could ask for a more loving and supportive church family thank you all from the Daugherty family so sister Emma sent that card a man to to the church and just expressing her things a man for everything that was done therefore for pops so keep her continue to keep her in prayer amen right now she is by herself she has some family but you know her closer family or some son or daughter they live away so she's just praying just seeking the Lord as to what her next step is a keeper in prayer a man just let the Lord director steps amen praise Lord all right I think that's all I need to announce and yeah that's it so let's read the word of the Lord start with me to mark chapter 11 verse 22 and I'll also pick up a scripture from Hebrews 11 to on today if we can mark chapter 11 starting at verse 22 all right and Jesus answering said unto them have faith in God verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he says therefore I say unto you what things soever you desire when you pray believe it's a critical word there key word when you pray believe that ye receive them and ye shall have him now that's that's if you believe you're gonna get it then you're gonna get it but the key thing is not whether God don't give it to you the key thing is you believe that he's going to give it to you amen no matter what it is if you would believe it you can get it alright so then when you stand praying forgive and if you have aught against any of that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses let's start over here to Hebrews 11 as well and just pick up a couple scriptures and then I'll start reading here verse 29 says by faith they passed through the Red Sea as by dry land which the Egyptians are saying to do were drown by faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they were compassed about seven days by faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believe not when she had received the spies with peace and what shall I say what shall I more say for the time with fail me to tell of gideon barak and of samson and of jetha and of David also on Samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrote wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions if I was to put you and this scripture today if they were writing about you and through faith they made a rack right that that's our title rapture and face a man quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed valiant and fight turn to turn to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised to life again and others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection a man and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings a moreover bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were sawn asunder were tempted were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins being destitute afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise dot haven't provided some better things for us that they without us should not be made perfect amen the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word let's just bow and a quick word of Prayer God we're thankful for the opportunity to read Scripture but we know the Holy Ghost is what makes the scripture live to us so father we pray that you would make it live as we read there in prayer this morning from the book of Jael to before the Sun was darkened and the moon to blood there was an outpouring that was promised to the people so God as the world is getting ready for this eclipse on tomorrow God we're getting ready for an outpouring of the Spirit a man before the Eclipse so father we ask that you would just help us all to move ourselves on in a way and that you Lord Jesus would just get the glory in the honor out of everything that would happen here today and Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you can be seated amen our title thank you our title is rapturing faith amen we want to just take that title today rapturing faith and if I could just read from this message spiritual food and due season I happen to be listening to this this week and I heard this statement from the Prophet and it just kind of started me down this path a man of rapture and faith so let's look at this it says though I know many of you are standing again tonight and outside met groups that said they couldn't get in and they're listening to the radio in two different cars and now we'll try to make just as quick as we can tonight on Sunday night we give over to pray for the sick and have a prayer have a prayer line as we can get one up here but we are dedicating this service tonight for prayer for the sick and I want I want I want you to get built up now and this holy Oracles of God interface the faith of this hour is what it says it says the faith it's going to take more faith than ever was in any age for this has to be rapturing faith to be taken up amen and I like what he's saying here this age that we're living in is going to require more faith than any other and any any other age that is going long before us this faith will require rapturing feasts hallelujah amen not just headache things right not not to think faith come on somebody a man not not not not not I mean this is faith to have your body change right Amen if you don't have faith to just get get over a headache right I'll get over some of the illness or something like that attacking your body you're missing and you can just you can take that down there the thing of it is I absolutely believe that everything that comes against you no matter what it is everything that comes against you is there to challenge your faith and as is challenging your faith you may not realize it but your faith is developing your faith is growing into the faith that you need for this owl which is raptured thing a man so rather than complain about your problems rather than sit and get down about about what you going through and and you know you get certain people in your corner and you can have that whiny conversation and they'll cry with you amen not everybody on cry with you and that some people going to tell you just you know you happened you got to endure that you're gonna have to absorb that because God don't give you more than you can bear right and you need to understand that the reason that you got it because God is actually preparing your faith you might not realize that but he's preparing you whatever the sickness is God is preparing your faith and you gotta have something to strengthen your faith so thick dog I mean I believe it was changed a count it all joy and then don't don't get sad about it count it all joy no matter what you go through count it all joy I know gotta bring you out brother branham say in this hour we don't need more faith than we ever ever have it's got to be wrapped in faith to take us up and in and I was I was just looking at something as I was just kind of going through this and there's a prayer line that the Prophet was having and I he was praying for different people and various things was going on and man just know it was all over the place any any acts of question say what about up in the balcony there you know it's like its face up on this side and it's based on that side but what about up in the balcony there and then like in trying to get the people up there in the balcony to get a hold of faith because if you have if they have faith in the audience they can pull the angel off the platform right to their seat and brother Randall often times you will see him say oh this first of all means you got this you got that and the person behind you they got this in the person I'm using you just see how paints just moving all over the audience so I think what about in the balcony and it's a I feel one of them she don't even realize she's got that thing playing say I feel a woman he said what about in the back say I see a woman in the balcony she don't even realize that she's got that big it's a hidden face right she don't even confess it that that's what he said she don't even confess it but she's got thing and I feel woman this woman the church is the woman that I see and she may not realize it but she's already got the rapture insane it's already only inside of you everything you need for the watch is already inside of you hallelujah somebody see you know we've been we've been taught for years at this and add that and add this and add that but you know it's not adding brother branham say when you truly born again it will automatically automatically add to you if you're truly fall again you gotta work this up this is this is automatic it's already in you God places it in you you live in a day where people got to catch the rapture see back in that day they repaired the Lions and they had to have a faith to be able to stand there from a lions that song that that was written here brother and you wrote it you all heard it and you know and the song is inspired from these forty people right here that you know that they said look we're gonna throw you in this this reason water but Andrews given me some more history on that I said Maya I didn't get a chance to read it but he was giving me some history on his play here they here to be throwing in some frozen water I mean really cold water and they would freeze to death for tiem if you don't denounce your faith in Christ we're gonna put you in this cold water well it was 40 of them and the 39th guy he said that they had water that was I mean cold water or they had some like some BAPS that they had created say if you denounce the faith in Christ you can go get into one these baths that's a little blood the waters a little warmer right and you'll be able to you'll be able to kind of handle that but but if you if you if you if you don't announcer faith you're going to the cold water well this one guy jumped up and say well man I ain't going in that cold water man I mean I can't be faithful unto death I can't be they ain't saying I I thought I had some faith I thought I believed this thing but not a talk about my life right so this man fixing I can't do so he jumped up and say no I'm gonna leave it I'm going to jump in this in this little bath y'all going to cold water but I'm jumping in the back for the Andrew told me to say that the story goes that when the man jumped into the bath the man died he went into something that was comfortable and he died something happened to his heart and he died and didn't realize that he died right after he's and now Cicely the other ones lived hey I mean unless died but they had captivate but that's when God has to denounce in the face right so you know all you know when the soul just saw only 39 going in the soldiers say I'm taking off all my clothes and I'm jumping in with these guys and I'm going to die right here I'm confessing that I accept Christ as my savior I believe him and i'ma die right here for and he says 39 say can't be third and I got to be 40 I got to be the 40th one I soldier got converted just like that I want you to understand that it took faith it took faith for those people to do what they did in that day but the same faith that kept him is the same faith that God is giving you to keep you for action it's not a different base it's the same thing it's his face glory to God I just appreciate I appreciate the Lord now let's look at another statement here from the Prophet Laurie to God amen oh Jesus let me uh I wanted to skip down here to have something this yeah here it is in Moses and man this message Moses Oh glory to God look at this it says now the only thing that is for you is to stimulate things to stimulate faith of the people that they might see God's willingness to heal the people now as far as it comes to healing it's your faith in God let me just inject this real quick while we were there amen and it just blessed my heart while I was out there in Tucson I was at a ministers meeting and a brother was sitting down across from me and he he began to share a couple testimonies and one of his testimonies that he shared he said how he had developed cancer behind his eye he had cancer right behind his eye young man probably in his 40s and so he was there you know and kind of Dilla Winston and was growing it was growing it was growing and and everybody's kind of looking certain about you know what he gotta do any like well I really don't know what imma do you know I just don't know and he didn't really tell too many people about what he was going through you know but but one night you know I mean I think he had finally gone to the doctor begin to give him some medication he would take to try to help this thing shrink and and one night you know he was there at the church and and because he hadn't told anybody he was just he was there and he was the interpreter for the sermon that night he was interpreting in Spanish and and as you know the brother was preaching brother Caleb was actually preaching just begin to preach and and he was just saying this and stand and and then in the middle of the sermon and they say just stop to say just start saying and right now if you believe it God God is healing you of this and God is healing you of that and God is telling you this and God is doing that and the brother is hearing brother Caleb and he kept you know repeating interpreting what was being saying but in the middle of his interpreter interpreting he heard a voice say and God just healed you of your your cancer behind your eye and say you heard a voice but he said like I didn't hear brother Caleb see that he said but I know I just heard a voice say that but I didn't hear brother Caleb see that so now he's processing all this within milliseconds so brother Caleb stopped and he looked at the brother saying I just heard a voice thank God just healed you of the cancer that you had in the brother say I heard the same voice a cancer gone behind his eye he said I just heard the same wolf and you didn't say it it was God that said it and there was two or three people sitting in the audience and as they were in the auditor for the whole church got to be on another level not just the people in the pulpit but even it's even the church two or three people the audience say when you stopped I saw a black shadow leave so in the mouth of two or three witnesses let every word be established it's not Hartley sorry say okay if they pray and say now you know what we not we want him to go back to the doctor let the doctors testify that it occurred so he went back to the doctor and you know and he went in for a little test or whatever and and he they were give them something because if I fight was getting bad you know because of this so he stopped taking whatever was here was giving them and went to the doctor say doc you know I don't think I need to take this because my eyesight is actually improving the doctor looking say look with your condition that never happens you better take this medication right it's a stock just just do me a favor let me take a test to see if my eyesight improving the test I said obviously wait a minute your eyesight has improved lycée say doc thank you but I need I need one more test from you I need one more if they say okay what is that he said it's that doc you actually put this little thing in my eye and you were able to tell me this cancer that you saw the high my eye you able to tell me that I need you to do the same thing do that same test and tell me whether it's there not doctor did the test it was gone it's based on our pain Oh hallelujah Church I told her brother I thank you for sharing that with me I needed to hear because I know my God is a healer hurry up but that was a lie above my God is a healer glory to God amen so we need testimonies like that the stimuli pain see see if we can't believe God can bring here and how are we gonna leave for a tenth of a body all right we need that antibiotic or through anything you believe God last night brother brother Brent brother being preached the wonderful message you know he talked about wins and losses right and in our Christian walk there are some wins and losses amen in some wins and losses we all go through things like that but it does not negate the fact that our God is still God the doctor don't lose his license when his patient dies and God not gonna lose so credibility he still of saying yesterday today and forever glory to God he said another testimony with me it's brother had a gun somehow the brothers son got ahold of the gun gun went off did some damage to this little baby's body and it was so bad that the doctors came in and say look if we operate on him you know what what he we don't know how he's going to respond to the operation we just really don't give much hope to this at all they said if we say say the way that the the damage in his leg and everything that has happened it's just you know y'all can just forget about it this he will not have a normal life after this so the brothers say you were wow you know this is really something and his brother had been in a backslidden condition and they just begin to you know just he just began to think and pray on it and and so he's like lord I you know we just don't know what what what we're gonna do here and I don't know how to approach this and god we just don't know you know so he said he said while he was there praying inside the chapel at the hospital say the voice of the Lord told him to stand up and speak to the situation that's what he did he stood up and he said was in there by stuff he stood up in you're spoken now after he's spoken he began to rejoice he began to praise God for what he had already spoken see that that's what that does fake calls things that food I've no they already work he began to rejoice and say some lady walked into the room and he just kept praising God while she was dancing say he's who she probably sat by whatever he was giving God praise for what God just spoke to him now he was the only one heard that his family had not heard that he was all alone heard it but he was operating with what God revealed to him because faith is a revelation as you begin to operate like that and just begin to you know worship he walked back into the room to look he's a little nephew and he got up to the nephew and it looked at the daddy daddy saying man they just they don't give much hope but he had he had the revelation he had the faith on the inside that I know what the doctor said but I got something here so they got up to his look he say he said you know the boy weren't able to really move he was just really in a bad situation so he said you know the debt the bullet that done so much damage it just just just not not much there so here he um yeah he said he got up to the board if they did something that he said now y'all gonna think I'm crazy for doing this he said but I know the little boy likes Batman he enjoys watching Batman he said so what I did is I went to him in my Batman voice and I began to ask him say if you can hear me just shake your leg and the boy begin to shake his leg if you can hear and just just do this and do that and the boy everything he acts the the boy to do he did so after the board did it the boy I mean the brothers faith even increased a little bit more like I know God spoke to me this thing on BR I know what the doctor said but it's gonna be all right and then he turned to the poverty it's gonna be okay God just told me it's going to be okay it's gonna be alright and he walked or not the room well few weeks went by that same boy that the doctor said wouldn't be this and wouldn't be that that boy was up being everything they said he wouldn't be and and as a as a you know a finalization to the testimony they took the board that the daddy took the board Bhavana present for the doctor that performed just a little mine operation on and he took them bottom and president and the board ran up to the doctor and gave the doctor the president say that the doctor just dropped it just dropped in and just like I can't believe it's they these types of things don't happen it was a miracle all because of somebody's face I'm talking about things that's happening now not just reading quotes from 40 years ago but things that are happening right now that's the stimulate thing so the trials that you're going through right now artists in early fight and you may not realize about that pastéis becoming watching pain I'm talking to a woman she's sitting in the balcony she don't realize she already got the faith hallelujah because the devil always try to put it out so far but it's in you right now well that's not the end of it that daddy had a gun that his son got ahold of daddy got to face some charges now daddy was looking at about 10 to 15 years because of this accident so the brother began to praise like like I believe in the law he told his brother I believe in the law I believe they they wrote laws for a purpose and and they got things set up and the law is the law I believe in I support it but we still don't pray they see you know we don't want to tell people you did the crime you have to do time but God can give you some mercy but you need to accept what you did so he told his brother Smith a I'm just we just don't pray we don't know what not going to do so the brothers in this backslidden state and i think he came to church before he went to court and they kind of prayed over some things you know and and and God just began to do with his heart a little bit like we were just going to lead us in God's hands so they prayed and the brothers prayers like lord I believe in the law I believe that the things that they put in place that's exactly right Lord I accept that it's a lord and if you're going to allow my brother to go to jail in order to touch his heart then God let your will be done let your will be done God and he had pieces he had peace with that type of prayer he say but also God if it's your will for him to be touched on the high side of the tail then touch him God on the ipod of the tail well brother went to court judge pass the sentence so we're going to give you six months probation went from a ten year sentence to six-month probation and when if you get through this probation we gonna drop all the charges but but but but the thing that I like about it that God began to touch this man heart and he actually wanted to serve God from what he went through I need you to get that one I need you to really get that one now sometimes folks go through something hearts still don't change towards God so why would God do something if your heart not on things it is not God doing something for you it's what God's doing to you you gotta have a heart to want to tell them you don't do things just to do things amen when this brother shared this thing with me and told me what I said brother I needed to hear that had to go all the way to Tucson to get it but God knew I needed because that would stimulate my fame look at this in the message Moses now the only thing that is for you is to stimulate to stimulate the faith of the people that they might see God's willingness to heal the people now as far as it comes to healing it's your faith in God your pastor can anoint you with oil at your own church and you have faith in God it will bring the same results that's right Gazza healer no man's a healer God's a healer these gifts are only to show what God's attitude towards the people to get you people back to believe in God because if you haven't got faith enough to believe for your sick body how are you going to have faith enough for the rapture see the people got and he said Jesus access question when I return to the earth will I find faith oh my god there's got to be a a great church full of play and God says these things down to stimulate date to bring out pigs to pee but paint this see what I mean those things that's the way it can it can operate a man let me just kind of get down a little bit here I want to go to another quote here and God has a provided way just just bear with me oh my see Church we got to have this and in every situation every trial every tribulation don't don't don't don't don't complain but can it joy God is using that to stimulate your faith everything the Bible say all things work together brother Jack you mean the fam yeah all things are working together for your good everything oh my god sometimes it don't look like it sometime it don't feel it but it is working together for your good you got to have faith listen to this one rapture and fee listen listen to this quote God has a provided way brother Branham says this since now God set in the church let's see here glory to God technology on you so God setting the church some teachers of pastas profit tips of healing now you don't mind we can work in that but that's a gift to the church that's a gift to the church oh lord help us god help us god help us god help us ah profits gifts of healing and all different kinds of gifts he put that in the church for the perfecting of the church getting the church together and nowadays has passed since the round assist of is the first round of the apostles they had all the nine gifts working in the church I got a I got a say T six if they had it at the beginning it shall be at the ending every tip will be manifested inside the church don't run from a church run to it listen it says I says up now stand all night just working in church the second round they begin to cool off the third round was about although then went out interest of the fifteen hundred years of dark ages then come the Reformation after the Reformation comes sanctification after justification comes on Wesley preaches sanctification and there come Calvin not Calvin Knox and all those who came down into the Pentecostal Nazarene that age and now we're moving right on into another great age coming for the rapture of the church and in this we're living in the time of the restoration of the gifts it's doubled many of the big five searches it's it Nazarenes backward it made fanatics powder out of a lot of Pentecost but just the same us moving right old bringing in the rocktron thing for his church that's right so tonight look at listen look look at this statement so tonight I represent that face the purpose there tonight ah represent that face Oh help me Lord right here so if the Prophet is representing that place we're gonna listen to the poppet so we can get some of that way I represent that paint the faith that was once delivered to the things in the way of a divine gift well I'll tell you what I just I just begin to think about that I begin to think about that so now you start looking you know while we you know why do we talk about the Prophet so much he represented the faith that we're looking for also you know some church is just happy about just a little healing but we're going beyond the healing we talk about the changing of a body some some just rejoice on the healing but how do I get my body change oh my my my you know there was a statements made you know I want to just kind of take a little time to go through this Oh hallelujah brother Branham talked about faith one time and he was working with a little situation it was a person a young lady was sick and he went to the house with this young lady to talk to her and they wanted him to come pray and when he walked into her house the young lady was sitting there and she was like you know brother branham I got faith I got faith I got faith he said oh yeah you do sisters yeah yeah I got faith I got faith I do they say just kind of kept talking to this and he knew just by the weight when he was starting to he could pick up a spit and he knew that she did not have it she was saying she had it intellectually she was having it but she didn't really have it oh yeah work y'all stay with me please if this is the time to fight the devil fight them right now oh my we talked about rapture face something that's going to get you out of here right so so the young lady said nice to know I got I got and all these people sitting around and brother branham together just kind of work with a little bit and and then he looked at he looked at hanging in the in and in the ceiling he said there was a string hanging in the ceiling hanging down and it's a he said now you gonna have to prove to me your faith she said okay all right I'll prove it so now I need the rescue I'll just turn your back just for a little bit I need to work directly with her everybody just turned around let me let me let me talk to her so he said sister I need you you're on this bed you're gonna need God to move I need you to prove your faith he said she'd say well how can I just say see that string there in the ceiling he said what I want you to do is with your faith I want you to take the string and move it back and forth in the room and then with your faith stop it she say I can't do that since I I can't do that brother Branham said say that's spiritualism see he said he said yeah I thought I felt she was gonna say that I thought you don't say that sister no it's not spiritualism it's faith it's faith she said now I can't do that say I don't know where you get that from but that ain't that ain't the word and he knew the teacher that she was getting actually limited her faith the church that she was under the teacher that she was getting in that courage to limit at her fame so she says she say well brother Brandon if you got afraid you do it say okay just watch he said but now don't look at me to look at the string and he's actually looking at the string that string went stop so you know what to do she said brother branham that's uh that spiritualism she said he said no it's not she say she'd say I'm gonna need a scripture if that's not spiritualism I'm gonna need you to give me a scripture on Nach say I was hoping that you would ask I was hoping that you asked is that because Jesus Singh ji preparing our sensei that who solar suspense it is mounted not just to the string but to a mountain o church when we get this the devil going to be in trouble if Jesus a whosoever say to the mountain be thou removed in our constituency and shall not doubt in his heart Amen but shall believe that those things which he said shall come to pass who shall have whatsoever he saith he put it right back on mark 11:23 say jesus said that sew sew sew sew sew your faith actually has to be able to do things like that if you really got it now I want you to understand because you don't when we look at things like this this type of faith is controlled by your motives and your objective oh my god now there's a lot of folk out there got all I mean they do in this case brother Branham one time went to the witch doctors and they they showed they had faith they had a table that they just picked up and just had the thing twirls all around in the room and challenged people to knock the table down nobody in the room could bring the table down brother Branham got up to leave the room and they say hey hey you're preachers yeah yeah I'm a preacher's so what you think about who say this is of the devil say uh why you say that you if you use so bad not to take knock it down say I ain't bad I can't ain't got no power to get it down see what Jesus can bring it down so you so bad you see say well I tell you what y'all challenging me I'm a challenge y'all see motive and objective he was leaving he was just gonna get out of it he wasn't he wasn't standing up trying to say well you know y'all praise God I'm a prophet I like none of that motive and objective you don't go around talk about you the bride they know you're the bride you got to know when to use it so we're not to use it so as they challenge him he say say in the name of the high Holies tell me if this is right say nothing at didn't speak he said in the name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost tell me if this is right say nothing after meeting speed set in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ tell me if this is right say the table fell down by itself all four legs broke and then which is an essay no this ain't right this ain't right the power was in the name of the Lord Jesus quite but he had faith faith to walk into the situation like that and knew that God was going to be VP with them you know when you when you believe that mean you got trust you got competence that what God said cannot fail Oh hallelujah you got confidence in what God speaks to you you got confidence in in a vision do that positives in the tree you got confidence in the Word of God if God bet that settles it that's where your fake the doctor come to ou know if God say I'm a captain I'm a captain I'm not looking at one of my mistakes not you can't get me to focus on a mistake I'll focus it on God's promise for me that's a Amen dish we got everything else and only look at what God says that's what Abraham did I'm not even considering how old I am I'm not considering that this has ever happened before I'm not considering any of that God promised me I might have a son and I'm gonna have me a son Sarah get ready we're gonna have a boy same God spoke to the prophet and told him he was going to have a Joseph but everybody criticizing saying maybe you met Josephine when his daughter was born see when you got faith you don't let no body no matter what happens no matter what comes up what comes what goes you don't let none of that dictate your faith see rapture and faith gonna be the same nothing on dictators no this happened that happened I still got faith I might have some Winslet's of losses but like like the brothers say we might lose some battles but we're not going to lose the war see the private saying he's saying say he represents that faith by divine gift he represents that faith that's why you want to hear what he's saying so when he's sharing this is the story you know with this young lady by how he took the string and stops and I don't look at me just look at the string string with hanging and stop when it stops you say now you got to show me that in the Bible he took a right to Maki Lennon so you see that that that that same scripture Mark E Levin produced squirrels when brother Branham was out there hunting it and God actually said now what she's hunting for squirrels so how many won't three he said do you believe mark 11:23 God asked him do you believe that so yeah oh I believe it well you know we'll go ahead and speak to the squirrel I mean say what you want the square and as he starts speaking squirrels and everything the scores coming from out eternity when God was using the property shadows things that was to stimulate that's not just a good story but that's the stimulate something inside of you we're in the stimulation should bring it to a poem you say that is for me that's not just a story from the top of the dance for me that that face that that he represents that faith that faith produce swirls that that faith raised the dead that faith a man spoke before the doctors hand touches my wife's body she'll be healed of that tumor that that faith did those type of things he wasn't even there to pray for her but he spoke the word only and it produced the healing you say when he pretty when he spoke to he didn't even call to check on his way huh he spoken on the inspiration and went on and preach the gospel didn't even call to check on his life waited I mean can you imagine such control Witney here today such control that he speaks about the holy spirit say rise to your feet speak to the condition he speaks it into the atmosphere and he goes to church and preaches swimming like nothing ever happened that's confidence that's believing you receive when you play I'm not calling to see didn't happen yet no it's going to happen because it's the same job that said let there be light when he spoke it had happened brother Branham said it might have took billions of years but God never God never wondered whether light was going to come he started working on something else so when you speak it release into the atmosphere start working on something else oh that faiths that before the doctors hand touches my wife's body should be heel of her tumor that faith calmed a Colorado storm that fade said that we could we had enough power to create another world and go live on it that faith told us that I'm a redistricting go give me faith is the substance that faith release certain things to is searching and as we begin to fellowship around this this is what stimulates and brings us to a place where we know that we'll be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye the church has lost that faith the church don't even believe in a rapture anymore because they lost the faith but God God's God's gonna profit net profit represented V faith that was once delivered to the Saints and we fighting to keep that face look at listen at this story hear this testimony faith is the substance says all right now you see faith is if something now look friends I know that all of you are at least know this this body is controlled by five senses please stay with me on this this body is controlled by five senses is that right all right it's got five senses is everything that controls this human body now listen real close and give me your attention now the the fence five senses is this right see taste feels smell here is that right then five senses control the entire human body is that true see taste feel smell and hear now there's none of them that declare faith faith is the sixth sense no to some people as you want to as mental telepathy or whatever you want you want a wish to call it many of them call it names but to me it's faith my god that's why people could go to Beatles concerts and get healed it was their faith that was doing it faith is powerful y'all it's powerful we if we don't use it we don't really use it now I'm not saying when you leave here go try to move all the strings that you see don't go out but but but when motive and objective the reason brother Bradley move that string because he had to prove to that girl - even half faith that was that was a motive and objective behind it oh my like you might find yourself in a hospital room one day and you might see a string Haman and all of a sudden that that did this call to come back to your mind and not just a quote but the scripture mark 11:23 goes with the quote and when that's quickened to you King you begin to begin to work with something but wait on that oh lord have mercy Oh God let me let me just hold on there hold on for a second while we were there and in Tucson for the digs took the liberty to preach on me and he he was sharing a testimony and see these things happen Church and sometimes you forget what God do for you and you have to be reminded we were on our way to London for the first time we got to the airport just a little bit too late we got that thing 30 minutes before the plane was going to go in and because we thought it was national before it became internationally we were going to Detroit before we went to London so right well we don't have to be hit on three hours ahead of time we got there about thirty minutes ahead of time I believe mom and sister Brown were already on the plane playing with loading ups they were we at the gate you know we at the front desk trying to get our luggage down there so we can go to the gate and the latest that no you y'all ain't going to no gate what planet even less yet this is right that no y'all ain't going no gate y'all gonna stay right here y'all can be rebooked on the plants and no no no no you don't understand how much them tickets cost we ain't got that kind of money to be rebook nothing we got to get on this plane so we just begin to just work with them and talk to them that ladies didn't know y'all and getting on this plane they shut everything down shut the system down and mom and sister Brown wonder what in the world going on like they won't they won't let us all we can't get on the plane so you know they set there and and my wife was talking to the people and trying to get some things and I said you know I just kind of pulled back and got quiet before the Lord I got quiet before the Lord and I got quiet before the Lord I heard the voice of the Lord tell me see sometimes when you're waiting on God you can't be all in disarray yourself and you can't be on you don't just just so so worked up that you came here the spirit of time you got to settle yourself down because he's peaceful when he comes in so I just kind of settle down and I know what it is I Lord they getting ready to take this plane and we don't pay this money and we got no money for nothing Lord what you know what do we do and I heard the voice let's say remember the woman in Memphis Tennessee so yes you say well pretty much the same God that grounded that plane for that woman that lady was in Memphis you say Lord I am your shunammite she say where is your Elisha she put God to the challenge I know who I am but in the zip she found her situation in the Bible she say I'm the suta my where is surely Elisha not knowing that allows you was flying over the top of Memphis at that time you want to know my lodgers I got something for you and that woman's player took the pain out EAM brought it down to the Memphis Airport where pulled it down they pulled it down that that plane landed she said I I'm looking for your logic I live with no plane I want any like logic goes to a hotel getting a hotel and he's there you know doing doing whatever he's doing and they've got to come back in the morning we get the plane off the ground the morning get y'all home well before he lies to get on the plane he hear the voice let's say start walking just start walking and brother jigs brought it out he stayed now this one no just five block whoa this was about a five mile walk and brother dig said in the first mile he was singing I'm one of them I'm one of them and I'm so glad that I can see I'm one of them hallelujah one mile second mile starts I'm one of them on one of them and I'm so glad that I can see I'm one of them third mile I'm one of them I'm one of them I'm so glad that I can see I'm one of them fourth mile still singing the same song for four miles get to the fifth now ladies say good morning parson why he's still singing I'm one of them good morning person how you know that I'm a person I mean ain't got no Bible in my hand I mean how do you know all the people that don't walk this neighborhood and I'm the parson you know that so they got told me that you I told the Lord I actually Lord safe you know where she said say I'm a shooter might say but where's your Elisha and God showed me the Jews come the only thing missing is your briefcase why can't we have experiences like that anymore I know that God is not dead that was not just something that happened back there that was something to stimulate faith and a woman that day ladies LSL you know I got us born here healing got wrapped up with the wrong girl and I got a disease and he died saying person I'm not even asking God to heal him I just want the boy saved see God knows if your motive and your objective right God would give you more than you asked for he did it for him Solomon he'll do it for you so that what he said I just I just actually I just want to know that he's saved they say well auntie let's go inside the house and they say God man he said he done been in King's palaces but he never been in the place where he felt the president got so real then when he got in that place he says he knew that that lady don't talk to God say aren't you if you don't mind would you lead us in prayer if she just began to pray and and and after she prayed while she's praying the Prophet just in there crying just tears rolling down his eyes and just can't believe somebody could pray like this say see she talked like she knew him he said then he uh he said he say he'd say okay auntie I pray and say Lord I don't know she say by a dream that you showed her this and you showed her that and you just told me that you start walking I didn't know where I was walking in and I don't know what I'm here but Lord I'm just praying for this boy that she raised the boy up cuz he even acts would say say have you ever heard of my ministries they know I never heard no one thing by till ministry I know nothing about you I asked God for Elijah and you happen to be Elijah now I'm gonna tell you something if she was living today and somebody tried to take her Elijah from her believe the sign couldn't take it ceased you but you couldn't take him whatever website would not be able to take her your I job and he might not have been sent to you but even sick haha she say she say she say she said I never heard her but I just I know God showed me that she was coming so they pray in brother Branham at the freight and they say the boy was just on the bed saying it's dark in here it's dark in here it's dark if you see but after a word of Prayer see I'm not about know you know we got to yell and scream at the devil I'm telling somebody know who they are when you know who you are you know you don't you don't you don't scream as a parent I got a child over you're acting up ain't yelling and screaming when when I was coming up my mom and it has to do a lot of yelling screaming she just gave me a look the look the look was the screen yeah some of y'all know what that look is it you get that look no I mean you just over there giggling and laughing and smiling playing with your put your friends and your cousins and everything you get a look just you're laughing stop you're giggling stop I mean it it was funny but you stop laughing because of the look it's time for the devil to stop laughing at the black hit that devil to look tell that tell you feel [Music] [Applause] thank God Church teleporter blah blah elevate so rapture and face that's what God is putting inside of his people so let that look can you knew it was serious business it looks at so much it's it when we get home look says you better sit down right now find somewhere and sit down I mean she never you have to let out her mouth just to look dead at all in if you ain't got if you if you're apparently you can't give your kids would look something wrong somewhere every area tile in here out of nobody look they'll know not now say how to know that and you keep laughing you keep let them get off out of out of control if you won't give them a look it'll be a whole bunch of other people right around them and everyone and why everybody looking at me like that mama why he looking at me like that just just sit down John Patricia that man raised up off that sick bed because his mama's faith pull a plane down and God reminded me while I was there too at the airport you see so you remember you remember how that that plane got grounded so now if you would if you would speak saying that's what God do he put he leave it up to you he first remind you then you gotta let it out you gotta speak it into the atmosphere so I got quiet for Laura I said the same God that kept that plane on the ground because brother Brandon Matthew pray for me went running back to the loot the play like I noticed play none left me I know it done left me they say he got all the way to the airport and he her last call for Louisville Kentucky God held the plane up until the prayer not only was pre until the prayer was answered God holding some things up until the answer comes the Holy Spirit says same God that held that plane to Memphis Tennessee can do the same thing to you so I say okay Lord I'm taking you at your word and I spoke out of my mouth that's not nothing loud and boisterous and I everybody in the airport I'm a son of God and I got something to say that's that's not that's not how you do it that's the wrong motive and the wrong objective oh come on y'all I feel like I'm preaching anyway I just feel like I'm preaching but but it's the same type of confidence in prayer that Jesus had when they looked at a tree and saw no fruit on it and they say no man eat no more from you anymore anymore that that's it that's it it's the last this is it and he just spoken in the disciples a line he they just didn't pay no attention to it like why would he say that to a tree the next day they come back and saw that tree all shriveled up it had died at the roots and I'm telling your situation is changing in the roots oh my so at you know when they trusted Jesus the tree that you spoke to yes they look at this they say no if you have faith and you would only believe you can say to the mountain be thou removed I can see dull down the heart you can have it it's not for me that's for you I did that to stimulate your faith Peter was there Peter have a space stimulated and when it comes time for Jesus to leave the stand and Peter was going to church that man was sitting at the gate called beautiful Peter Som Peter and John walking it and I don't know how many times they walk by the same man but all of a sudden this dais something just rose up me now it was the faith of Jesus not only was that faith in of Jesus inside Peter and John but that same faith jump inside that man and calls him to believe the word that man's faith did not get him up go back and listen to the church age but brother Branham said it was Jesus faith in that man that got that man and I'm telling us Jesus faith enough this come take us into a rapture feet in John 6 live and go have our number such as I have I give unto the rise up and walk in the name of Jesus for them to say such words they had to have something on the inside come on church but I heard the Holy Spirit say the same God that held that plane down see that's not just a testing one that's full to be way back you know fifty years ago the same God that held that plane down is the same God is able to hold this plane down I released it out of my mouth I say the same God that held that plane down in Memphis Tennessee the same God is going to hold this plane down here for me five minutes go by plane still there ten minutes go by plane still there 20 minutes go by plane still there and they start getting telephone calls up at the front desk well we can't get the plane out we can't get the plane out into what y'all can't get the plane out so we don't know what's going on we can't get it out and then they came up with a little plan they didn't want to tell the people that they get ready take this flight overseas and they got a some mechanical issues on the plane they they don't want to confess that so what they decided to do they decide to announce we got some international passengers that need to get on this flight and if y'all Jeff gives them a little minute we'll get them all along and then they called my family over to say come on come on come on we want to get y'all on the place and oh my mother my cousin all know y'all even get me oh like that my motives and my ejected was right so I got to go over here to England I'm invited to preach it I'm going over there to preach so whatever you got to do to get me on that plane I'll take it and we got on and and our luggage got all mixed up and messed up but we made it to England and we come on the plane everybody looking but didn't know we had two witnesses already sitting in the plane that knew what was going on God strategically plates everybody and when we sat down guess what the planes are backing out here is the same God [Applause] look at this since uh whatever you wish to call the faith is the six things not known to some people as you want to as mental to left telepathy whatever you want to whatever you want to wish the call that many of them call it names but to me it's fact and that is in and above all five senses of the human body you see what I mean faith is the only direct and positive sense it's the sixth sense faith is more than sight faith is more than feeling you do not feel faith you don't taste faith you don't smell save but you got it it might not realize you have it you don't see faith faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen so when you can see it by faith then you start operating based on what you see here see this Bible now I I want that Bible so you remember bream say I represent that faith now watch what he says here in the statement says that I want that Bible now I'm looking at it now I want it faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things I do not see see see what I mean here in my pocket I think those are key words I think there's an old Barlow knife I've carried for years now I do not see that nice I do not feel that nice I do not taste that knife I do not smell that knife but I know that knife is in there how do you know because I believe it's in there now if it's not I believe it's in there but if it's not I want you to understand this that if it's not in there faith not dealing not emotions not good thoughts but hey we'll put it in there [Music] if it's not in their faith we'll put it in there nobody say that jokes you see this is why I felt that's what I say he represented that faith I'm sorry I heard everything Billy Graham said but I don't think he was preaching like this I just read all Roberts book he wasn't talking like this this is another level of faith so you know there's different levels of love I got a quote on that you got God's love and and then then you got the love that a man would have for his wife right then you got the love that a man think you have for another woman that's not his wife is not love it's love and then brother branham keep brain say that didn't say get so filthy til the man start loving another man that's filth that's not love oh but he just love him no he don't love him he don't love him and she don't love her not like that that a love that is spelt said also a call came off of the great degree of God who God is love it all flows down from man he said Schaffer that there's a spirit of honesty in saying they say say say you know you get a person that's very honest and man like anything God so you can depend on because God is honest he don't lie God is not a man that he should lie he's honest so but then that thing just start working out you get a man you know he try to do the best he can but sometime he can't come through and then you get a guy brother and so you get a guy you know that you got to watch everything you do around him they say it just keeps getting perverted more and more perverted same thing happen with our faith what we're reading about and script to what Jesus spoke down scripture what we're reading about these people reach a certain level of faith and they were honored by by their faith that's why the written in Hebrews chapter 11 that was just a Hall of Fame and if you were to we rewrite the Bible going backwards you were being there as a group that had phase to catch a rapture you look at Abraham you think about how to do how can the Bible record this man have faith we saw all the stuff that this man did but God didn't look at that I said I'm looking at Abraham's faith and I'm if God did look at Abraham's mistakes he won't look at mine you know they used to have a saying get your eyes off me yelling about anybody remember that would get your eyes off me don't look at me you better look at God look at this if it's not in their faith we'll put it in there if it's not there that chokes you I know but that's true if you believe all things are possible you're afraid to take God friends you're scared now I might I might have left that knife laying on the dresser where I changed clothes a while ago but just as sure if that knife is on the dresser right now if I be leave I wish I could underline it give it highlighted on the line to give it to you put it on the on the move your car if you believe if I believe it with all my heart it'll be in my pocket I mean I left it on the dresser but I need it here faith can pick it up off the dresser bring it through the different realms like a text message [Music] something as physical as a knife and nobody even see it coming through in the pocket and it reaches down and he picks it up and there it is and I'm talking about this all happens within a millisecond they says I've needed in the name of Jesus bring me my knife and the knife just gets up thank God for my knife I'm not talking about a new knife I'm not talking about going to college Emeril and pine a new tonight I'm talk about the knife I've been carrying for years faith brings it say does that remember sister Tina had a situation when she was looking for a jump drive she was in school she needed that jump drive it had all the date on it don't tell her to go buy another jump drive the new jump drive don't have the data on it that I need my face say I need my jump drive Lord I don't know where it's at but I need my god you know where it's Hannah she's just fat Dipper in and just pray it had the weight had to wait had to wait within a couple of days she said she was just sleeping in her room woke up and the jump drive was right on top of her who put it there I believe God got angels that's a hot son angel she need to jump drive drop it see the motive el objective was right one time brother wisdom got into a situation he was away from his house long way away and he needed he knew that that he was showing on his and his tank and didn't know how he was going to get to the gas station he spoke by faith and that car kept going to the got to the gas station brother let's go one time locked his keys in the car is back with Ho triple-a and all young people you need tripoli when you got gone they say he didn't know how he was gonna get in the costoday was cold in New York he he needed to get his family in that car and get that getting that kylief Lord ain't mean to lock my keys in his car he freaked and as he prayed his faith unlocked of the locks on the car and he got in church I'm sorry if we would believe these things say all this happened to stimulate to give us rapture but we talk about the changing of a body and he came to none else at least claim his word over your over your sicknesses at least at least do that you can't do nothing that's by strikes I'm here by strike something I'll feel no better but by strikes on here there's two things I will never confess that I don't feel better even though I'm in pain right now ain't gonna confess that but I'm a confessed by expects I'm here by straps I'm here every day I buy especially even if I die i'ma die on by his stripes I'm healed put that on my green maybe somebody that is sick will see my grave marker and they'll get healed that's the way we got a V search face that just just just not moved by no matter what happens I'll take my wins and I take my loss but I'm not going to be moved because this faith is producing faith for the rapture don't run from the trial run to it be like David take his head off if I die let me down the battlefield but I ain't like like brother being said last night he's looking at David just thought man maybe this guy you're not gonna go man think is you is what everybody go David saw either only ones standing saying none of y'all gonna go King God done did this for me and Gotham did that for me I stay the line I stay the bear and I this Goliath is just like one of them I take them out give me a chance well if you can't like they're you to you to this and you to that so if you gonna go if you gone gone here's my arm and I just I just like to ask the question oh why you gonna give David army that you didn't even trust yourself you didn't even have confidence in your own mama if you had confidence in it you will put it on it you would get out there why you gonna give me something you ain't got no confidence in saying I got this ain't been proven I've been tried I can go to battle like this just giving my sling and my rock I'm going out hit picked up five smooth stones just in case you might need five scriptures just give them five smooth scriptures that you just quote real quick if you get yourself a song to that you can sing while you're going through captain stone Lee said just in case I'm you know I see brother branham say that those stones represented FAI th and j esus they took the stone he just slugging it said brother branham said god gavin stone made the stone go a thousand miles per second a man came through that fast but he threw that rock thousand miles per second and the way the armour was designed it was only one place David could hit and he slung it hit that man right down his forehead brought the life down and when he told saying that the day I'm a feet drill files today you thought I'd feed my body I'm a feet Jill I'm a feet Jill Barta to the farms of the air didn't have a sort but went and took Goliath's sword that's a bad man took the lights forward cut his own head off with it and held it up and like brother dig see why we liked in Tucson next time the battle come up with the Philistines David would come out with this bang we had that bag in his hand they wonder what in the world they got a bag but we got swords we got we got shields as men got a badge and they come out with this bag and they just reach in the bag and he pull out a head so y'all want some of this say the philip starting to start taking off running back in the other direction because they remember what happened to the champion we got to remind the devil what we already done you've already overcome in some areas you're not going to be defeated your face is being stimulated not challenged stimulated and as you get it stimulated it's going to produce rapture and faith in you I believe that with all Mart let me read one more we'll close out today here in countdown Oh glory this message countdown it says this don't don't miss it friends remember listen at my voice it will haunt you all your life if you haven't got in out yonder when you're suffering for your punishment and we're weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth that voice will spring back and forth you hear it all the time in the weary spooky place of Hell don't fail now is your opportunity now there is just so many I wonder if I could get it would it be all right you brothers to pray with me to help help help me pray for them uh now is these ministers over here I wouldn't wouldn't leave this place now look I've said some pretty rough things about airplane automobile remember they are horsepower to all of it is horsepower the church is just moving up Holy Ghost power say it is the Holy Ghost that we're justified by your ministers know that don't you the Holy Ghost sanctifies us I like that see when you get your you're saved by grace kept saved by the blood justify sanctified by the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost feels us notice this now the Holy Ghost the same Holy Ghost that filled you the same Holy Ghost that justifies you the same Holy Ghost that sanctifies you the Holy Ghost gives us rapture faith as we move up I like that church so as the Holy Ghost a man that we've been are holding on to preaching Amen that Holy Ghost is the same Holy Ghost that's gonna take you right into the rapture God can give you healing in your body he can give you faithful rapture a man it's not a different faith it's the same thing but every time a trial comes is to stimulate and anoint that pain that's why when brother Branham share these things you know that's not just something for us to sit around just talk about but these are things to be manifested in our own lives right when we when you can hear just 40 50 you know 60 years ago that God was doing these things with a a man here on earth right here in the United States that should stimulate something is that God you can do the same thing for me if I have need of it if I got a mountain that need to move it's gonna move brother and say even if it's moving one spoonful at a time one grain of sand at a time it's still moving it's still moving I don't know what you're going through but you got the first thing you have to get yourself in position spiritually we're God can anoint you to speak and once you're in a position spiritually where God can anoint you then speak it and watch God do what they say you done to if you say to the mountain be thou removed be doubt cast into the sea don't doubt in your heart you can have what you say when you pray believe that you receive when you pray let's pray father we are thankful for truth we're thankful for the word of the Lord that has been given to us I believe and and there's many folks didn't get a chance to read them all but the Prophet told us that we're moving in a time where the people are being anointed if faith is being anointed to believe you for a rapture we've we know that your healing we know that that's why I'm so grateful that you shared those testimonies with me there and Lord in Tucson you allowed that brother to be here to share that unit exactly what we were going through here I needed to hear that it stimulates my faith helps me to realize that yes you are the same yesterday today and forever so help us God no matter what it is that we're going through help us to speak the word only and knowing that the same God that spoke let there be light at the beginning is the same God that is speaking in and through us now if we would just believe what we're asking you for we can have it Lord don't let this just be a sermon that just you know we kind of
