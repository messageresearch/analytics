name of the lord jesus christ um and while you stay standing we might just read the scripture so that we can save time just wanna read from the book of from the book of matthew thank you very much mrs from the book of matthew chapter 8 matthew chapter 8 starting from verse 28 amen praise god and when he was when he was come to the other side into the country of the genesis they made him to possess with devils coming out of the tombs exceeding fears so that no man might pass by that way and behold they cried out saying what have we to do with the jesus the son of god and thou come he that determined us before the time and there was a good way off from them in head of many swines feeding so the devil besought him saying if thou can if thou cast us out suffer us to go away into the head of this wine and he said unto them go and when they were come out they went into the head of this wine and behold the whole head of swine ran finally down a steep place into the sea and perished in the waters and there that kept them fled and went their way into the city entered everything in what was befallen to the possessed of the devil may the lord add blessing to the reading of his word shall we just pray father in the name of jesus christ we thank you appreciate you we thank you lord for your gift of life and we thank you lord that we've made it this far father we never knew that we'll be here but lord we are here further because of divine providence father there is over you know my heart you know father dejoh over given an opportunity i wouldn't want to stand here father you know that my plans it canceled and i and i asked the lord that lord i i didn't want to come but lord you made me to come here and i just pray you commit everything into your hands father this opportunity i took it lord father because i wanted to give it to you father so lord you have your own way father these are your children they are great people father may speak to them in a mighty way i just pray to jehovah may you do something new today for the judge over to encourage them lord father we're here in this same vineyard working lord and laboring father is the label on this side father may you bless them father may you do something lord to us today father may those that are troubling may they grant them safe travel in passage and we thank you lord for our precious pastor brother jack to give her this opportunity to speak to your children father is a short of this ministry father we thank you for everything father we feel really humble and we thank you we give you praise we give you one and wonderful and precious demon for king and savior jesus christ we pray amen um god bless you since you may be seated thank you very much brother jack for for the confidence uh and the opportunity to comment and administer the word of god amen i really feel small especially when you've got all these big giants around you big minister so i i would have preferred i normally just want to do sunday school and and prayer meetings so preaching is not my it's not my cup of tea so so please please just bear with me you know i i heard in in finance they said high risk high returns i pray that brother check your risk you have right returns tonight amen so that was a big risk i mean um i have just come here with my with my two son i left my wife mother two children uh shamga in bethel so i come with joel and sharma and today is sharma's birthday yes so yeah so god knew that when i get old i always forget the anniversaries so god made sure that he comes on our anniversary so praise god amen um i have enjoyed my my time here the fellowship ministers and everything you guys have treated us very very well am i clear yeah and you know i think this was more than hospitality if my brother here would have said they would have been put into into a hospital with intensive care so we have been intensively cared for by by west palm beach and for everything god bless you there's no way that can express the prophet said the best ways you can say is god bless you and god richly bless you uh tonight we just want to just go on a little text that i've entitled the the impossible way i know it's uh english it's not my first language so please please forgive me uh but i think uh it makes sense the impossible way or in another ways it's a blocked way so it's a way that has been blocked so but we want to speak on the impossible way but for for for a little thought at the end we want to say once is not enough so so this road has been blocked if we are to take the journey into the scriptures in matthew chapter eight in the we hear the story that there was two maniacs and they say these people they said they blocked the way until people they wanted to pass but this is no man could pass that way so regardless of if you wanted to go you could not go through there because they say those maniacs they were there and they said no men could do anything they say they tried to tell them they could not tell them they tried to the nurses the psychiatristic want to to section them and they could not section them there was no hospital that could be able to contain them so that way you know that way it was this these money they stood in the way right the operation was in the way until that way was impossible so if it is coming to church this way in the maniac sign that way you knew that you have to go the long route regardless how much the shorter it is now you have to divide you have to real you say what reroute right so you have to go around it you can't you can't go there because that way has been blocked and everyone knew that if you go there you are a dead man because they say they tied with faith as they tried with chains and those maniacs they were breaking them so they didn't intention that no man they are coming short way every man has to go the wrong way whether you like it or you don't they impose their authority but this story is so important that even jesus hate about it that there is a way that is blocked and no man could pass it and at that time if you look in in matthew chapter 7 he was already on a healing campaign he was already preaching and he heard about this way and the prophet said he had to cross the commercial sea to make sure that he comes and addressed that impossible way brother i want to tell you there is a way that is blocked all right there is a way in your life that may be blocked there may be things that you want to achieve today but you could not achieve it today there are things that you want to achieve you want your healing today but your healing has been blocked but because it has been blocked you are going the wrong way you are going the right way you are going the wrong route so that you can be able to make your destiny i want to tell you when god blesses you you are blessed if god says i viewed you you are healed but why you are not healed it's just the devil he's delaying the devil is good and delaying and he's good at delaying tactics so he can delay he cannot take you brother jake i want to tell you the chest cannot be taken from you no he can only delay it so he's just taking the long routes because there are maniacs that are in the way so we want to deal with the maniacs that are in the way today because they are blocking because if you're going to school it's five minutes to go to school it will take you 30 minutes because someone is sinister someone has got no intentions for you to enjoy life he says why were they standing there they said the people they tried to bind them the people they decided to to to to to to give them some psychiatric treatment but they could not do it right they said they failed every way but god did a good way i want to tell you that regardless of you're gonna get somewhere by the devil he keeps on delay you need to watch the delaying tactics of the devil because you're already healed why does he want you to be huge tomorrow because that's pharaoh that's pharaoh's idea when do you want healing tomorrow because we know we don't walk by faith walk by sight and faith is now faith is not tomorrow faith is what it's now healing is not tomorrow healing is want it's now so but the devil keeps on telling you he wants to give you a painkiller solution he doesn't want you to get healed he just wanted to give you panadol it says we take two a day you'll be fine for two hours after six hours the pain is back again and gives you he doesn't want you to get healed he tell you that i give you a painkiller solution and i want to tell you the people what they had for those maniacs was a painkiller solution they said they let us bind them so that we can go they didn't care about the people they didn't care about the two minors they said no the people must be bound so that we can go what happens to them we don't mind but i want to tell you you are so so important in god that he does not pay any cost about your life when it comes to you god does not spay costs church can you hear me when it comes to you god does not spare he breaks the bank of heaven to make sure that you have your your you have your heart's desire good does not stay but the prophet he says in the mind if you give me the next quotation the prophet he says that about the maniac of god he says and we find him now out in a little ship coming across the sea because over in another land in gadara one soul was calling for him thing across the sea in a mighty storm all through dangerous peru as he went that night to save one soul and to heal one person he came from one side he came from one side of the lake through the storm all night long to the next to the storm that great tide that might to heal one person he traveled all that long just to heal one person because god he wanted a solution for the people that the people that you know that have not been working to change that people that have not been going that way is possible i want to tell you in your life you might have a situation maybe you are sick and your way to healing has been delayed i want to tell you that way is possible because the doctors they say stage cancer full stage cancer for it cannot be healed so they now put an impossible way they impose it and it says you cannot make it they tell you that the statistics of this disease you cannot make it they make sure that that way is impossible but i want to tell you jesus he still got you in your mind jesus you are an investment of god god cannot lose you because god is not a poor investor that cause you today and lose you tomorrow right god is the only that's the only business that is in profit today if you want shares don't buy tesla don't buy another i want to tell you you need to buy good shirts because those shades they never go down they never depreciate they are always in profit every day so you might as well buy as many as possible because you can live an inheritance for your children i want to tell you there is an impossible way tonight not tomorrow because the faith is now because it says let us go and he says he says he traveled the stomach so that he can only heal one man brother i want to tell you we are servants of god but you are the children of god because we you are the most important and we we minister we work for you we wake we are servants of your father so you are the son you are the daughter of god so you so much while he says i'm not a preacher i'm not a singer but no you are the most important because we are here to save you god did not spay any course he says i have to fly here i have to come here at my own course so that i can come and preach to you so that your healing can be ministered so god is not saving and sparing any cost about this way that's why he's making a way is regardless of who is there regardless of how much they are posting regardless of how many there are but i want to tell you you are more important don't worry you may be a little flock but i want to tell you god's people they are not numbered oh hallelujah god's people they are not numbered but i want to tell you god's people they are weighed by what is inside of them because the greater is he that is in them than he that is in the world because the bible says you have come on to mount zion you have come under the face into the church of the first born you have come to innumerable campaign of angels when we gather in this place they will the one with us they are modern with the enemy the one that are in us they're more than the ones that are in your way brother i wanna tell you healing is in the way for you healing is you you are in the touching distance with healing you might have this you might be discouraged all along but i wanna tell you healing is now because that way tonight is possible because jesus is here regardless of how many how many tables are they they may be they may be a maniac they may be they may be a true point on care because there is more with us than with them there is innumerable campaign with us tonight to make sure that every promise in the bible is fulfilled i want to tell you tonight there is a numerical campaign and we are going to make it regardless we are not here to negotiate no we are here to take what belongs to us we are here to talk about it because the faith is the biggest is the biggest occurrence that never goes down it buys any shades at any time and we know our faith is this nature faith is a bully it does not negotiate it's just nations i want to tell you we are not going to negotiate your healing we are finishing your healing we are not negotiating your blessing we are snatching your blessing because faith is destination because when we take by faith then we maintain by prayer because we know that prayer it keeps every blessing the prophet says you don't need to live a clean life to be healed he says you need you need just faith to be healed but you need a clean life to maintain healing so i want to tell you that way that healing whatever you want you are you you are just two you're just too close brother sister your day zero and eight are numbered so you know your days are numbered by months you don't have time to waste you don't have time to be huge tomorrow you don't have time to be old next week no because your days they are so short you might as well enjoy i want to tell you there is a there is a possible way tonight during the time of moses in the book of exodus chapter 14 we hear about the red sea they say the god of moses is a poor general because they said the red sea he just laid them into the red sea because the red sea was an impossible way they said for you to cross the red sea they say they had to open for two million people to go through the red sea they need to open a cable five kilometers and they said the people it would take them four hours to cross it and they said it's impossible that these people will be able to make it they said pharaoh started rejoicing and says and now i have caught them now i have cornered them i'm bringing them my cheap labor is coming back home but they surprised they they surprised that that way that was impossible that day it become possible that way that one seems as if no one do they will make it everyone just told the probability of making it was zero but that way was possible in that day because god of moses was in them and they said when they were crossing they say the sheriffs of pharaoh they started coming and they started riding furiously and they say the angel of the lord removed their wheels oh hallelujah they said the wheels of the chariots they were removed and they started making a lot of dust brother i want to tell you when you hear so much that's when you hear the screaming of the devil don't worry he doesn't have to run flat sir he's running on wheels the wheels are gone that's why the dust that's why the noise when you see sickness just keep on bouncing on you when you see situation keep on binding and squeezing you brother just know just he's just running on no wheels he's just running that's why the dust is making that's why the noise because he's running off no wheels why because gold has made a way that is possible brother god is going to take care of you if he took care of 2 million people brother you took care of 2 million people for 40 years and people in transit look you didn't take people to me it didn't take care of people 2 million people in west palm beach no you took care of people 2 million in transit people that to manage and to heal and to provide for 2 million people that are working for 40 years you change the budget america will run bankrupt by just maintaining the healing just those people they were huge they were fed they had water from the rock they had miracles they the pillar of fire they the pillar of god they were a blessed people and god made a way for you i want to tell you if only these red sea would be thinking per adventure god chanced it but the next thing we hear about jericho we hear about joshua when he took over from from from moses praise be to god amen if you can go to the next slide please okay okay okay okay joshua chapter 3 18. joshua the same two million people they came to the red sea they came to to jericho and it shall come to pass as soon as the souls of your feet of the priest that bear the ark of the lord the lord of the air of all the earth shall rest in the waters the jordan the water jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above in the shall stand up upon him now we hear that god jordan they said at that time it had overflown his banks and it was impossible no one knew that that road was blocked and they could not make it but they say god says you send you send the priest let them take the word and that way was possible he with two million people joshua he learned something from moses and he said regardless of what is in there what's in our way we are going to make it and the sure is anything he went through them and if they stop on there then the next target you know the devil just keep on throwing these blockades blockades after blockades you know for you just to come to the message you are blocked here you are blocked there they were blocked by the red sea they were blocked by jordan and the next stop was jericho my my ipad is just playing up here praise the lord joshua chapter five and he said nay but he kept as the captain of the lost horse am i come and joshua fell on his faith on his his face on the earth and did worship and said what saith my lord unto his servant the captain of the lost was said unto joshua loose thy shoe from the effort for the place where to understand this is a holy ground and joshua said and lord the lord said unto joshua i've given into thine hand jericho and the king thereof and the mighty men of hell now jericho they said it was so wide the wars that they could they could do some drug racing on top of it but they said it was in the way no one knew that that way it was going to be possible but it was only brought down just by a shout out so sometimes when you see that the devil is trying to just keep on shouting when sometimes when you are here when you are sick and you don't see the way out just keep on shouting because in that shout there is a victory so you just keep on praising god and praising god they were in the first time the second the third fourth sixth day and on the last day they said they went seven times and the walls of jericho came tumbling down even yours and the challenge that is before you i want to tell you tonight he's a victim tonight good is looking for the victim and i want to tell you the reason why we are here is to make sure that if as if he has done it before he's going to do it again then this jericho jericho corn we find that jordan has been crossed and then came elijah and elijah said no i have heard about this and this river is standing in my way again and what does elijah do in the book of kings all right and elijah took his mantle and roped together and smote the waters they were divided heather in this so that they they too went over on the dry ground brother red sea was crossed once by this river jordan is now being crossed for the second time amen so to prove jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever so sometimes then elijah had that it was it was done then he says if it was daniel yesterday it can be done again then he came and he smote it and he crossed it and as if as it is not enough oh my i felt sorry for jericho for for jordan elisha on the same chapter praise god second kings chapter 2 18 and he took also the amendment of elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank jordan and he took the men of elijah and fell from him and they smote the waters and said why is the lord god of elijah and when he when he also had smith in the waters they parted he the entity and the elijah window and the prophet he says jordan simpler symbolize death sometimes death comes and knocks on your door sometimes death comes and knocks on the church but the church now needs to know that this river has been crossed before this river has been closed before because you find the prophet he says he said one time there was a sister or a believer that died they bring him tabernacle and they said the prophet was not in the place but the elders of the church they have heard that the jordanians raised the storms again and they said they went to the undertaker and says give us our our believer don't empower me and they prayed for that believer and he rose up again and we have seen it over and over again so as long as you see death knocking brother sister i want to tell you that way is possible don't worry about how much it is overflow don't worry about the statistics just look on the weight of god as the children of israel told you look and live look to jesus and live there's a simple solution don't look at the snake whether it's a python whether it's a black mamba where there is white just look and live so you did not need to look at what the statistics no just look on the scripture if you look on the scripture your possible your impassable way tonight is possible the only need you just need the only small small currency you don't need to have money in your bank the only thing you need is faith faith is a current that you can purchase anything in any country and at every good rate praise be to god i want to tell you that the prophet he says um sometime you know we as christian and along the way some we make mistakes and sometimes the devil he tells us there's no way for you to go to church there's no way you can come back to church there's no way you're going back to god and he says he's the same person that made you to sin he's the same person that influenced you to do the sin and he's the same person that prosecutes you but you need to tell him tonight there is a way begged for me because jesus died on the crew of cross of calvary to make way for sinners brother if you know a brother a sister that is far away of whatever the condition whatever whether they are in drugs whatever they're in what just going to them there's hand in the hook there is a way to come back to god god is calling you god is ready to forgive god is ready to give you a chance the prophet in the message over jaire he says now you talking about someone that you think you've got a little something that you can't get back to god look at abraham out there what he had done he lied about his wife setting out to one side any man would act like that too about his wife there he was out here out there he was backslid you say but brother branham i made a mistake last week or last month i don't care how many mistakes you make we have all sinned and come short of the glory of the lord if you are a child of abraham you are ready to realize to recognize that is sin and come back to god again god's messy steals hangs to you straight away the lord the prophet he says no matter how far you got and you think this way to come back is impossible he says god he says our father abraham he even lied about his own wife but the lord said that's my prophet let him pray for you brother regardless you are my brother regardless of your condition i saw an advocate he says he is my brand that says my brother has got cancer but he said he's still my brother whether your brother is big sweden he's still your breath whether he is so he has done so many things but his blood is ready to forgive and give him because the lord does not want the death of a sinner scriptural god does not want the death of a sinner that's the reason why he makes a way in the provision to make sure that that impossible way become possible in jeopardy he says and i thought oh god how can you look at such is that i thought my little sarah and rebecca are going to have to be raised up in a world like that you know the situation the prophet said when he went to a restaurant and he saw the old lady that was not dressed well and the policeman playing on the slot machine and they said the the the the teenagers doing what teenagers do and he said when you look at that the prophet condemned this is not a pastor this is not a brother like me this is the prophet himself he says wow lord my my daughters are they going to raise up in this and says i don't see how you can stand in to look at such a thing i was standing there criticizing the two drunks with the hair caught up and i went out i went out to to be going just for a while just then i felt something moving on me i went back and i sat down a little bit to the side nobody had a pay attention to me yet it was kind dark in the corner and the and there god gave me a vision and changed my mind and things now the prophet he says god gave me a vision that changed my mind you say those people you did not give them a chance he had already condemned them but he says god changed my mind and things that there is a way back he didn't know how they're going to make and he was given the vision of the blood bomber i want to tell you there is a blood that speaks better things than the blood of abel because it will never cry versions it always creates mercy messy messy so no matter what you must be able to outreach and tell the violence of sin there is room for you we need to be able to preach and tell west palm beach that there is room in the end there is a room for everyone this is the place that each and everyone is pastor here is the pastor to the community the man here is his pastor that drunk that you see on the street that's his pastor the man that you see that behaves misbehaves that's his pastor so you need to tell them that you must come to where you belong because the prophet says elijah was jesus pastor regardless regardless whether they like you they don't their pastor is here their church is here so you must be able to tell them and says brother you need to come back home amen you are not a visitor but you are coming back home because this is where you belong maybe in closing because today is wednesday just to keep our time i want to read in the message mighty congress he says there is so little spoke of this ascension is one of the greatest days when he ascended up because all over the earth since the day in the garden of eden that sin was committed all heavens was shot off from mankind the prophet he says since the days of eden the heavens were shut off and they said this ascension is not spoken too much about but he says but it is one of the greatest days when he ascended up the sea christ with his own blood is a high priest anointed with the power of god raised from the dead and he tore down the dominion of satan and he broke the domain and went through the heavens beyond heavens and he was come to the lowest one earth every angel archangel every principality and power you tore down and spoiled it it is crucifix and resurrection everything saturn head he broke through the veil of scene he tore it apart with with the high priest's blood and of his own body now there was an impossible way that when people want to pray remember daniel he was with stood for 21 days because they said the scene like pollution it was polluting and polluting until people could their prayers were not hindered they were being blocked by the sins of the world but they said the lord jesus christ when he ascended they said that impossible way they said he pulled a hole so that my prayer and your prayer cannot be hindered so now when we pray there is nothing that can hinder there because that impossible way is already when he ascended he made a way for our prayers so no matter what the devil can say or how much he can shrink it does not matter because that way is already being put that way has already been made so my prayer today cannot be hindered whatever i've requested the lord has to give you to the prophet said the lord has answered all my prayers if you didn't tell me you told me why he said so your prayers he said if you agree with anything if you bound anything when it is bound in heaven so if you pray your prayer cannot be stopped brother when you prayed when a little girl your prayer is still violent okay let me explain this there was a president called eisen and the english word yeah that one thank you faster praise be to god they said he said when you fire a shell he says if he does not best what do you do he said you fire another one right and he says if you fire a shell and it does not base what you do you fire another one he says at the end one of them is going to what is going to best so in other words your prayer is just like a bomb so when you release the girl says lord i want a good marriage that was firing a pump so when you seek you fire you will pray remember that it's a law of ammunition that if you fire a bomb a bomb is a bump whether it's is the either say is exploded or unexploded but it's still a what a pump you cannot take it and put it in the display you cannot take it home it becomes a what a prompt so when you pray in the morning you are just chilling the place when you pray in the evening you are standing the prayer brother sister i want to tell you that impossible way is full of your bombs so your bombs are lengthy you have prayed for the past two years your bombs are lazy you fasted your bombs are lengthy i want to tell you your prayers is your a bomb is a bump ah brother i want to tell you a bomb is a bomb regardless wage length even up today we're still in london we're still dealing with the bombs of truth of world war one when we found them we don't treat them like like like artifacts no we even if i killed houses and accommodation they are left people they run away because a bomb is a what is a bump so your prayer regardless when you pray just make sure that you are bombing yeah just bombing that place i want to tell you your prayer is not in vain your prayer every day is hitting the target it's hitting the target the devil is just telling it's an exploited bomb it's an exploited bomb but i wanna tell you one thing one secret of bombs one of these days there is a bomb that is going to land when one bomb explodes the rest of them are going to explode when you all we need tonight is to fire that last one igniting bomb we want to fire that thing so that is all your prayers okay now every prayer that you have prayed we are now firing the last bomb i want to tell you church tonight we have come here to support you to make sure that you fire the last bomb are you really church are you ready says don't get scared of praying just keep on firing in the morning or evening when you're tired just keep on go to your ammunition and just fire it hallelujah just wake up in the morning and pray just fire the bump i wanna tell you in the evening just fire the bump wake up at three o'clock in the morning just fire the bump just make sure you look clear the bump one of these days all of the bombs are going to ignite it may be too nice it may be tonight that we are firing the last bomb oh i want to tell you moses he fired the bomb first time and he says let my people go they say detain the water into into blood that was the first bomb pharaoh says i'm not going but that bomb it landed hallelujah and they said when he turned it into blood that says all the fishes they were destroyed and moses said okay hold on i fired the bomb here and the pharaoh is not moving but i want to tell you one thing that was happening to the egyptian he took away fish from the table the fish industry he already closed it so the egyptian the fishing industry was closed and he says oh they don't hear that let me fire the next bomb he fired the next bomb he sent the frogs and they did not hear says okay let's fire the let's send the next bomb he fired the next bomb it was the locust they said they ate all the greeneries they ate all the vegetables so the egyptian the pharaohs they are no longer eating any greens because it was removed from their table but moses didn't see the effects of his bombay brother it did not stop there so the agriculture was now put to settle the fishing industry was gone and he says okay let's keep on firing and he says let me fire the next bomb they say there was hailstone they said every animal that was out there they said it was hit and destroyed brother by the time that moses left egypt the fishing industry was gone the the agriculture was gone the animal industry was gone and the next thing he said okay let me kill all their first bones so that was the last igniting problem until pharaoh says okay let me tap out you win you can cope brother i wanna tell you tonight let's make sure we hit the table so that he can tap out we are tapping out make sure that nice you fire the bomb until he taps out if he doesn't turbo don't stop just keep on firing in the morning fire it's evening fire just keep on praying because i wanna tell you moses he fired and the last time he says okay i'm going to put you on your knees he says i'm taking all your ship labor he says i'm going with him brother when he left egypt there's no resources to follow each israel after that they never followed that that was the end of being a superpower brother so when you pray when you're so discouraged you don't know what your prayer is doing he's destroying your enemy so that they cannot follow your children so that they cannot follow your current shooting so we need to make sure tonight we fire enough to protect the future generation we fire enough to make sure that we save something for our children to make sure there is a worshipping place for our suit to make sure that our children they have some way to go i want to say you don't get science don't get tired that impossible well tonight it is possible in the book of corinthians it says in the amount of two or three witnesses let everything be accomplished i want to tell you if god has done it yesterday he has to do it again because doing it once is not enough if god feeling with the holy ghost yesterday he has to do it again lest last time people say it's his emotion if god heals you he must heal you again because when he healed you lasted time lest the people say it was chance lest you think it was it was yes you think that it was a pineapple unless he think it was a medication no if he did it yesterday he must do it to say brother jake because god gave you a house yesterday he must give you twice because to prove that it was him because he must repeat it because it is it is hebrew stating this age which is the same yesterday today and what forever so that means he must be repeating repetition is powerful brother you cannot call yourself a musician because you've played once you must play twice you must play three times you must play in different conditions you must play you must sing in england you must stay in london you must sing in your shower to prove because doing it once per adventure we say it's a chance i want to tell you a preacher cannot preach once he has to preach twice because we think the first time he's taught that knows how he's a chance but the repetition is what is powerful i want to tell you tonight we are here to break records because it has already been done because there is no new thing under the sun so what has been do it has already been done you're only breaking the record how many times it's been down cancer has been healed so many times we are here to break the records i want to tell you people have good homes but you are here to break the records so we are here to make sure there is a standing record that the children was crossed two times and elisha said i have to break that record and make it number three because we are the elijah we are the elijah of the dead elijah is gone and we are here what the what he did with the prophets we need to make sure we break that record because there is many of us like dvdq the giants by the mighty gender warriors they started breaking the records so tonight i wanna tell you church we must break records we must break records of healing in west palm beach we must break hair records of deliverance we must break records of having young people in church i want to tell you we must see young people in church that record must be broken because there must be a sustainability there must be future ministers those children that belong to isa they are our children we claim them another talking by the vicaria suffering and the argument of the cross of calvary i want to tell you once is not enough i wanna tell you once it's naughty enough if you did it yesterday if you prayed and breakthrough yesterday i wanna tell you once it's not enough because yesterday it might be better when it was chance so you need to make sure that you pray at home and break through you need to make sure when you come to church like this you must make sure you break through if you have been filled with the holy ghost you say lord feel me again even because the one man was they said he was healed they said he said i started seeing people as trees he was already seeing the vision was there and jesus said once is not enough he touched him again jesus one time he he raised someone from the dead and they said ah that person we don't think he was dead we think adventure they dragged him he was dust next time he said okay you waited for four days whenever i need proof of it that this man was dead until some people they said you stink it and he said once is not enough he raised lazarus out of the dead no matter your situation no matter what you are going through i want to tell you that god all things are possible with god they said in the book of something said they spoke evil of god that says god cannot so when you say god cannot provide for you that's when you are speaking evil they say you cannot finish temples in the wilderness god said what you know the moment you limit god that's where the problem starts because they said one king one king he said he said he said god of israel is only god of the mountains and god had him and god took it personal you know when when the doctor said you cannot be healed god takes it personal he says what this is my daughter i bought you i put it with my own blood and this man says god just do it to prove their point we are here i want to tell you brothers and sisters victory is so addictive when you when you got healed once you can stand on that platform and says god can do it again if he has if he ever provided for you yesterday all it is is building your faith every day is building your faith that's how it works because once is not enough if he heals you of a toothache next time when you have a headache you know that god can hear me the next time when you have god when you've got cancer you know that god can heal me because doing it once is not enough i want to tell you west palm beach there is more you are here to see what god can do with people your blessing you know it's you know it does it does not make god rich to keep your blessing he doesn't increase in value because he didn't give you a blessing he is still good neither does he make him poorer to that he gives the way it doesn't make him rich to keep it neither does it make him poor because it gives it away so he has no reason why he has no grudge why he cannot give to you it's only you that needs to realize that good is more willing and the prophet said there is a craving god is so they say the god is is paining inside he's just looking for a crevice where he can just a way he can explode and empty out himself good he wants to bless someone beyond measure he wants to feel someone beyond measure but he's only looking for someone who can believe it because he has damaged in the past and he's here to do it again as dwight mood says he says the world is here to see what god can do with empirement that is fully surrendered to god i want to tell you if you're fully surrendered to god you're here to see what god can do in this place regardless of the impossible way no don't look at the circumstance look at the promise look at the promise of god he is more than able to fulfill each and every promise in this book every promise every chapter every verse it belongs to this church and this whole book is a love letter full of promises to you that is send a prophet messenger so that he can explain it and break it down to you that the bible healing and everything else to know that god is a god of souls of power you do not only save your soul but it is here to save your soul and to heal your bodies to make sure that you have got plenty god does not want you to beg no god he wants you to be you you should be plenteous in good and what the prophet says he says i wish you to be prosperous spiritual material physical and financial so god he wants you to be prosperous in all those four factors of life so you are not doing god a favor by not getting them tell your neighbour you are not doing god a favor by not taking your blessing you are not doing god a favor by you not receiving the holy ghost god is more willing to give it to you and for you to receive it and when i tell you just look to jesus look to jesus and we're here to reinforce it we are here to stand with you we are here to increase the fire power we are here to make sure that everything is fulfilled we are here to make sure that whatever maybe maybe your situation is just used for you to pray in english today we are here we pray in all times i want you to make sure that you call that 999 we just make sure that each and every one of you today we want to pray i want you just to call upon the name of the lord you know the cheapest curry the cheapest phone call which never struggles is prayer jeremiah 3 3 3 call unto me and i answered thee and show you great and mighty things which thou know has to know brother there are things that you don't know you never you have seen sickness but you don't know what's called healing you have seen how to be troubled but you have never known our school joy but the bible says call unto me i want to introduce you tonight to a good lifeline i want to introduce you tonight to a connection this connection is the best connection ever this is the connection of jesus christ he's on the other side and i tell you sayings god is ready he's willing he's he is positing he can't wait to give it to you he can't wait to see a smile on your face brother god is not that unjust no he's not that that dad that you think you always when you sin is ready to bounce on you but when you do things which are right why is he i want to tell you you don't serve god for not god is ready to bless you god bless you west palm beach they've been a pleasure to be here god bless you over to your persons glory glory glory [Applause] my what a bomb that was dropped tonight i think brother brother teach start out by saying high risk high returns and what a return amen on on um just you know the the thought to have him speak tonight and i certainly leave here uh encouraged just just seemed like a faith has been elevated to another level through these meetings and and everything and i know as a brother teach was just speaking there i just thought about i always kind of joke about uh getting married and um and um when we got married i bought a ring for my wife and thought okay this is good and i think we hit the 15-year ten-year 10-year warrant 10-year mark and um she started looking at some other rings and uh and i thought to myself like oh my i thought the first one was uh you know i thought that was it that was so you know and you know over time i'm like okay all right let's let's let's let's get the ring you know when and uh and then we hit the 25-year mark praise the lord and we start having those conversations again amen once is not enough [Music] [Applause] and as a husband i'll just be honest with you uh when a husband's able to provide for his wife when she has a desire like that it just it just it puts something a little smile on his face uh it's just an accomplishment that okay we we did it you know we did it and uh and and i just i just began to think if i can feel that way as a normal man what does god feel like when he provides for every one of our needs amen it puts a smile on his face it it don't it don't make him less i mean uh more poor i think uh richer or poorer it doesn't make him poor to give it and it don't make him richer to keep it but i think it puts a smile on his face when he sees his bride bless oh i tell you the truth amen i just feel like dropping bombs amen every prayer is another bone glory and man one of these bombs gonna go off and when that gonna go off it triggers all the other bombs so i i tell you just keep dropping church whatever just keep dropping bumps brother branham told us that the weakest christian when they hit their knees all hell begins to shake glory to god brother teach god richly bless you [Applause] um we have been blessed um [Music] i don't know i guess a couple weeks ago it started and uh it's hard to see it all come to an end it's just hard um my my prayer my desire uh even so come lord jesus because uh we we just need fellowship like this for eternity and man we need it for eternity i know on tomorrow amen we have some of the saints that will be traveling back but uh brother gwen we are so appreciative amen that you made it over you and sister gwynna [Music] amen [Applause] and you you brought some mighty warriors with you uh brother steve and sister precious god bless you all we really really appreciate your ministry um just just just just you know so many things since um even you know last wednesday just the supernatural god came down and spoken and i i told the church there that we had a building that we were we had four brothers that were scheduled we're not lepers but uh but it was four of us scheduled to go and visit a building and um and we went to see the building and you know just um um sister tanya just randomly sent me a text she'll say brother jack this building's available we gotta look at it i say it's just the tiny that's the very building that i was talking about last night and i say well you know i said here that all i can tell you all churches we're dropping bombs and uh one of these bombs gone gone it's gonna explode and we we we are moving by faith we're engaging the different people that we need to engage we're doing everything we're just getting in action amen and i just love what he said you know it's don't don't you know when when you're looking for god to bless you with something you don't necessarily need to look at the price tag that you know why that's not your concern that's god's concern so so don't say no don't don't don't don't say no because you looked at a price tag now give god an opportunity to do something great hey the same god that provides five dollars is the same god to provide five million dollars it's not a different god amen we don't go to one god to get five dollars and another god to get five no it's the same god the earth is the lord's in the fullness thereof the world and they that dwell therein so it's his responsibility amen we just leave it all in his hands but we uh we're just moving by faith and and uh and we accepted the challenge uh last week brother brother steve we accepted that challenge now this week we've been encouraged and we're just gonna keep dropping bombs [Music] something gonna strike at at some point in time lord have mercy so i told brother gwen i said now our desire is uh you know we usually do easter in uk but we're trusting that the lord is going to open the door for us to do easter here and we'll have to bring all the preachers back they told us now it's going to be a lot more coming next time they've already warned us about that so we'll be ready for him praise god we'll be under expectation amen amen hallelujah i was just telling my wife i said i was just looking around i said i was watching the saints just rejoicing and worshiping and just something about that worship you know um and uh i said you know i i i don't like to just have services like that during the meetings i want that just be a normal or occurrence for us so uh we might have to update some things amen but
