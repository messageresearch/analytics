[34:48] just how much he loved. He loved He

[47:46] Lord has got something for us.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; Shall we pray? Our heavenly father, we
[47:53] thank you this day. We bless your name.
[47:56] We magnify you. For there is none like
[47:59] unto you. Father Lord, whenever we meet
[48:01] Lord Jesus Christ, you have a portion of
[48:04] eternity prepared to unfold to our
[48:06] hearts. Lord, we thank you for the song
[48:09] services, Lord, testimonies, Lord,
[48:11] different things you've done in our
[48:13] lives individually and as a body of
[48:15] Christ. We give all the praise and honor
[48:17] to you, Lord Jesus Christ. Father, even
[48:19] we are privileged to be here, Lord
[48:21] Jesus. Some have beneath the earth,
[48:23] Lord. Some just passed away this night,
[48:26] but Lord, you've given you've been so
[48:27] gracious and you have ordained us for
[48:30] this day to manifest your glory in this
[48:32] hour. Bless our dear pastor, brother
[48:34] Jack, Lord Jesus Christ, and bless the
[48:37] body of Christ even as we listen to your
[48:39] word. May the word come from the throne
[48:40] of heaven, not from a man, Lord Jesus.
[48:43] We are not here to see a man, but we are
[48:44] here to see you, Lord Jesus, and have
[48:47] conference with you, the Lord of God.
[48:49] Lord Jesus, you know the hearts and the

[48:56] afflicted, Lord Jesus Christ. And lift

[49:13] we pray. Amen.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Praise be to the Lord.
[49:18] Amen. Amen.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; We can take our seat.
[49:25] Thank you for our musicians and all that
[49:29] you do. The Lord bless you all.
[49:32] We thank the Lord. We want to just speak
[49:36] uh go on with the the the topic that we
[49:38] had the other time scriptures pertaining
[49:41] to eternal attributes and those of
[49:42] temporal qualities. We want to speak on
[49:45] the second part which is a part two and
[49:48] we want to have a little subtitle or our
[49:50] concentration on press the eternal
[49:52] button. Amen. Press the eternal button.
[49:56] And as we go on we will I believe the
[49:58] Lord will give us more about what we
[50:01] mean by press the eternal button or
[50:05] click the button. Amen. Glory be to the
[50:08] Lord. Let's uh
[50:11] go just be on our feet and just take a a
[50:15] scripture just to set ourselves rolling.
[50:18] Let's go to the first slide. And we've
[50:20] already gone through that scripture
[50:21] already. So we just read it just for the
[50:23] sake of maybe those who were not here
[50:24] the first time to get a foundation of
[50:27] what we mean by scriptures pertaining to
[50:29] eternal attributes and those of temporal
[50:32] attributes. So let's go to Ephesians
[50:34] 4:1, Ephesians 1:4 instead.
[50:40] Ephesians 1:4,
[50:48] right? He said, "According as he has
[50:50] chosen us in him before the foundation
[50:52] of the world that we should be holy and
[50:54] without blame before him in love." I'll
[50:57] go over according as he has chosen us in
[51:01] him. When you see the word according
[51:03] mean there's a reference to something by
[51:05] a certain rule or regulation or certain
[51:08] order. The Lord chooses in him before
[51:10] the foundation of the world that we
[51:12] should be holy and without blame before
[51:14] him in love. So this choosing wasn't
[51:16] done on earth. It was done before the
[51:18] foundation of the world. Amen. So this
[51:21] scripture is a scripture that pertains
[51:22] to eternal attributes. Amen. It's not
[51:26] something that you decided to do
[51:27] something as a human. You can take out
[51:29] your seat. God bless you. It is not
[51:32] something that you made that choice but
[51:34] it's something that the Lord choose or
[51:36] the Lord did before the foundation of
[51:37] the world. Amen.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; So your salvation has got nothing to do
[51:41] with your with your abilities on this
[51:44] earth.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; So your salvation you can't delete your
[51:47] salvation by your mistakes on this
[51:49] earth.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; Neither can your good works produce your
[51:53] election. It's purely the choice of the
[51:55] almighty. Amen. And then when we read
[51:58] the next uh scripture which is
[52:00] revelation 138, it says, "And all that
[52:02] dwell upon the earth shall worship him
[52:04] whose names are not written in the book
[52:08] of l in the book of life of the lamb
[52:10] slain from from the foundation of the
[52:12] world." Again, this is not an a time
[52:16] attribute. He said those people their
[52:18] names were not written in the lamb book
[52:20] of life. Not because of what they did,
[52:22] what they didn't do. God has got his
[52:23] prerogative to do what he want to do.
[52:26] Amen. It's just like the women maybe if
[52:29] you have done some sewing you buy a
[52:32] material maybe whatever how much you buy
[52:34] it and then you take a scissor and cut
[52:36] through the material
[52:38] &gt;&gt; and then you put some aside
[52:40] &gt;&gt; right
[52:40] &gt;&gt; they can go to the trash they can become
[52:43] a a you can use them as a duster to
[52:45] clean the floor. You can use do whatever
[52:47] you want
[52:48] &gt;&gt; and then the the one that you elect you
[52:50] sew skirt shirt blouse whatever you want
[52:54] out of it. Amen. because you bought with
[52:57] your money.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; And so God created us according to his
[53:00] own for his own purpose. Glory
[53:02] hallelujah to the Lord.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; And then we read Genesis 1:1 in the
[53:07] beginning God created the heaven and the
[53:11] earth.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; So when you see beginning, beginning of
[53:13] what? Time.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; Because eternity has no beginning, has
[53:17] no has no ending.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; It's not a time attribute. So beginning
[53:21] in this war, the Lord God begin to uh I
[53:25] mean uh break himself down to the earth
[53:27] because he wanted to become part of
[53:29] earthly creation and manifest himself
[53:31] here. Amen.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; I would say the greatest manifestation
[53:35] of God is right here on this earth.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; All right?
[53:38] &gt;&gt; Because heaven is right here.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; And we will find out uh as we go on.
[53:44] Let's go to the next slide and then we
[53:46] going to dwell on the dimensions. But I
[53:49] we go by it quickly and then we come
[53:50] back to it God willing. So when you talk
[53:52] about dimension, dimensions are just
[53:54] realms that we live in that exist in the
[53:57] universe. So the first dimension
[54:00] actually is supposed to be the seven uh
[54:01] the seven dimension which is Elohim
[54:04] Christ the eternal attribute. But
[54:06] because human beings we learn by
[54:08] progression, God put our dimensions
[54:11] first. Glory hallelujah. So the first
[54:14] dimension is the universe that we
[54:15] occupy. The second is the material that
[54:18] occupies the universe which is the
[54:20] matter and the earth. And the third is
[54:22] the time attribute which is the temporal
[54:25] dimension for us to eternity unfolding
[54:28] here to manifest ourself right here.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; So it's not eternal. No matter what you
[54:32] go through good or bad in time is not a
[54:35] turner.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; And the fourth dimension is a dimension
[54:40] of records. Science, communications,
[54:43] internet, all the technology that you
[54:44] see, the microphone, they operate from
[54:46] that dimension, which is the dimension
[54:48] of record. And when you come to that
[54:50] dimension, I call it the free access
[54:52] dimension. Everybody can use it. The
[54:55] devil uses it. God uses it. Saint uses
[54:58] it. Demons uses it. It people of evil
[55:01] character can use it. Amen.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; That's right. You can preach through the
[55:05] microphone the word of the lord and send
[55:07] people to heaven.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; And demons can operate through
[55:10] microphone to send people to hell just
[55:13] by the music
[55:14] &gt;&gt; because the music is coming from the
[55:16] from the fifth dimension which is hell.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; And you can talk think about all these
[55:21] great some of these great musicians I
[55:22] mean in America and all over the world
[55:25] when they sing what do they do? They
[55:27] unleash demons in people. the kind of
[55:30] dancing and if you go to the clubs,
[55:33] demons, cigarette, drugs, they unleash
[55:36] that dimension through the microphone
[55:39] upon the people
[55:40] &gt;&gt; and the people respond to it and they
[55:42] take it and then that become their life
[55:44] form.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; So we have the temporal h the uh the
[55:50] fourth dimension which is record. We do
[55:52] have the fifth dimension which is hell
[55:54] which is Satan, unbelief, realms of the
[55:57] souls. People have asked you sitting
[55:59] here. Thank God you've got a sanity of
[56:01] mind. Somebody's on drugs.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; He doesn't he or she doesn't know where
[56:05] he is.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Maybe he's been he's been he's on the
[56:08] street sitting there.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; He has got He doesn't even know where he
[56:11] is.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Right.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Because demons from that dimension are
[56:14] operating. They have taken over his
[56:16] mind, his heart, his soul and they are
[56:19] operating in him.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; He cannot exist without doing drugs.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; He has to inject and keep injecting and
[56:25] keep injecting. I had a I used to live
[56:28] in England, London and I work in a
[56:30] pharmacy and they have a we had a
[56:32] program called
[56:34] uh needle exchange where people they
[56:37] people do the drugs. So instead of using
[56:39] the same needle to inject themselves you
[56:41] can come to the pharmacy gra needles
[56:45] bring back the old needles and we take
[56:47] it and then give you new needles.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; Wow. So the pharmacy where I work uh
[56:51] boots the chemist I'll call it and so we
[56:54] start around the pharmacy open the
[56:56] pharmacy open at 8:00 but we no open at
[56:59] 7 but we don't open to customers till
[57:01] 8:00. So this lady came in and said I
[57:04] want noodles and I said oh you got to go
[57:06] go and come back at 8. He said I need my
[57:09] needles right now.
[57:14] And she got the needle right away.
[57:17] I didn't question because the attitude
[57:20] and the spirit that is coming. You just
[57:21] better give her her needles
[57:23] &gt;&gt; and take the old one because without the
[57:25] needles she need to inject.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; She cannot cope with it.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; When the medication is withdrawal
[57:30] symptom going out of the body
[57:32] &gt;&gt; the de that's the demon.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; So you have to keep you get anxious
[57:36] anxiety and what have you. So you have
[57:38] to put in more drugs to be able to
[57:40] survive.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; So that is what powers from the fifth
[57:43] dimension. That is demons that were
[57:46] operating in people.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And those dimension is also
[57:50] temporal dimension. Then let's come to
[57:52] the dimension that we want to focus on.
[57:54] Glory hallelujah. That is the sixth
[57:57] dimension which is what the theophony
[58:00] which is you
[58:01] &gt;&gt; right
[58:01] &gt;&gt; heaven the word body the logos h which
[58:05] is where the the saints are saints here
[58:08] and saints on the other side. Yes,
[58:10] &gt;&gt; we are in the region of the blessed
[58:11] where we enjoy the blessing of the
[58:14] seventh dimension.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; And the seventh dimension is nothing but
[58:17] Elohim or Christ himself,
[58:19] &gt;&gt; fountain of all living things. Amen.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; He's the one who created all things.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; And that's where I want you to crest
[58:25] your heart.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; That which which dimension do you want
[58:27] to dwell?
[58:28] &gt;&gt; All right.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; Where do you want to focus?
[58:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; Do you want to be influenced by the
[58:32] fifth dimension?
[58:33] &gt;&gt; All right. to do drugs, to fornicate, to
[58:35] drink, to smoke,
[58:36] &gt;&gt; to lose your sanity or you want to give
[58:39] all of your heart
[58:40] &gt;&gt; to the Lord Jesus Christ
[58:42] &gt;&gt; that the powers of the fifth, sorry, the
[58:44] powers of the sixth and the seventh
[58:45] dimension will manifest in you.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; Our young ladies, our young sisters and
[58:50] young brothers, you are at the age where
[58:52] you have to make a decision for
[58:54] yourself.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; Your parents cannot make that decision
[58:56] for you.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; You have to come to a point that you
[58:59] decide to give all of your heart to
[59:01] Jesus Christ.
[59:03] And if you don't do that,
[59:04] &gt;&gt; another power will take a hold of you
[59:07] &gt;&gt; and twist your mind, twist your heart
[59:09] &gt;&gt; and put deceptions of the faith
[59:11] dimension in you,
[59:12] &gt;&gt; telling you you are beautiful, you are
[59:14] handsome,
[59:15] &gt;&gt; have girls, have boys,
[59:17] &gt;&gt; and when you get HIV and you are dying,
[59:19] you're going to find a result. Amen.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; You can do abortions. I mean, get
[59:24] pregnant, the government will even pay
[59:25] for you. It used to be
[59:27] &gt;&gt; to abort your babies. But when you come
[59:29] to your point where you want children,
[59:31] you're going to find out that you
[59:32] destroy the blessing the Almighty gave
[59:34] to you. Amen. So you have to take a
[59:37] concrete and discrete decision. Either
[59:39] to give all of your heart to the Lord
[59:41] &gt;&gt; or the devil will take your heart and
[59:43] destroy you. Amen.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; There's no in between. No.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; You can't say I'm trying to I don't I
[59:49] don't want to give my heart to the Lord
[59:50] and I I don't want to give my heart to
[59:51] the devil. No. One of them will take
[59:54] over your life.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Praise be to the Lord. So the the
[1:00:01] seventh dimension is Elohim and Christ.
[1:00:03] Then we have the eighth dimension. The
[1:00:05] eighth dimension is actually what we as
[1:00:08] human beings created.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, how can you create?"
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. I'll
[1:00:13] break it down for us.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; Takes it. Let's say you have a wife and
[1:00:17] your children. On your children's
[1:00:19] birthday, what do you do? You buy them
[1:00:21] gift. Christmas, you buy them clothing
[1:00:23] and toys and what have you. Yeah,
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; but then they know daddy and mommy's
[1:00:27] birthday is coming up. The money that
[1:00:29] you give it to them, they plan that, you
[1:00:30] know what, let's surprise daddy. Let's
[1:00:32] surprise mommy. You don't even have a
[1:00:34] clue. They buy some, they know stuff
[1:00:35] that you love. They might not be able to
[1:00:37] maybe buy you Mercedes-Benz at that age,
[1:00:40] but they know that they could buy some
[1:00:41] shoes, a pair of shoes and and something
[1:00:44] simple, t-shirt or whatever, watch,
[1:00:46] iPhone, something
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; and your children buy this iPhone, wrap
[1:00:49] it, you are not aware, and then you come
[1:00:52] home on your birthday, they blindfold
[1:00:54] you and give you the give you the
[1:00:55] iPhone.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; You wow. So my kids think about me,
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; they don't even have money.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; The pocket money that I give to them,
[1:01:02] they take some of it and give me
[1:01:03] surprise. And that is what the A
[1:01:05] dimension is all about.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; The salvation God give it to us. The
[1:01:09] eternal blessing that we look at you
[1:01:11] Lord, you give all of your life to us.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; You sacrifice on Calvary. You died for
[1:01:16] my sin. What can I give it to you?
[1:01:18] There's nothing I can do to compete.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; But I can give the little praise that is
[1:01:22] on my heart.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; I can give the worship to you.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; I can give all of my heart to you.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; And that is the eighth dimension. That
[1:01:30] is the praise and worship and songs of
[1:01:32] adoration that we give unto the Lord
[1:01:34] Jesus Christ.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; And the greatest praise and worship and
[1:01:37] song is to give your heart to the Lord.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; Say, Lord, just take me over.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; Just do whatever you want to do with my
[1:01:44] life.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; And when you let the Lord take you over,
[1:01:48] the praises and the songs will come
[1:01:49] spontaneously.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; And if you don't give your heart to the
[1:01:55] Lord, two uh we have two fires. One is
[1:01:58] called the pillar of fire
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; and one is the lake of fire.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; And without one you can't skip one or
[1:02:05] the other.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; You either give your heart to the to the
[1:02:08] pillar of fire
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; to deal with you and give you the Holy
[1:02:11] Ghost baptism
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; kill the old person
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; or if you don't do it at a point in time
[1:02:17] when you're about to leave this earth
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; the lake of fire will take a hold of you
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; and you're going to be unhelated. In
[1:02:23] other words, you not exist in any
[1:02:24] dimension.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; You're going to be destroyed completely.
[1:02:27] Amen.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; So you better give your heart to the
[1:02:30] Lord. And that is the scriptures
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; that I have it over there for you.
[1:02:33] Revelation 20110-11,
[1:02:35] Revelation 218, Matthew 25 to 41. The
[1:02:38] lake of fire which is the burning fire.
[1:02:40] What fire can consume the consume
[1:02:42] things. The natural fire can consume,
[1:02:44] but you're going to see ashes.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; But when the lake of fire consumes you,
[1:02:49] you never exist in any dimension. Amen.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; And that's why God is, the Bible said
[1:02:53] that God is patient and he doesn't want
[1:02:56] nobody to get lost.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; So God give us time.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; To repent
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; to give your heart to the Lord.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; But then if you make your the you make
[1:03:05] the the the world become so sweet to
[1:03:07] you. You make America the influence of
[1:03:09] this world become so sweet
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; that you don't want to give your heart
[1:03:12] to the Lord. Then when you die, you
[1:03:15] can't go to eternity because you are not
[1:03:17] represented there.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; And your time is finished on earth.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; You can't leave here. And that is what
[1:03:23] create hell
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; unrest. You can't have final peace in
[1:03:27] any of the dimension.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; And it's more than physical fire burning
[1:03:30] you.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; Imagine you are alive, you are not dead,
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; and somebody set a fire and you are
[1:03:36] burning.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; That is worse. Billion times worse than
[1:03:39] that.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. That unrest that you have, hell is
[1:03:43] more than a burning fire.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Cuz the burning fire will burn you after
[1:03:46] a while. You die.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; But this is not the case.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; You are there. You are still a human.
[1:03:51] You are not in this flesh, but your
[1:03:53] spirit is still there.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; Glory hallelujah to the Lord.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; Let's break down some things. Uh let's
[1:04:02] go to the next next slide. Of course, we
[1:04:05] read this scripture and I want to break
[1:04:07] something down. Now when the Lord we
[1:04:09] have dimension that was created we have
[1:04:12] eternal dimension the dimension that is
[1:04:15] eternal is eternity that is Christ
[1:04:16] himself
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; but just like electricity if you want to
[1:04:19] use electricity in your home you can't
[1:04:21] connect your electricity to the is what
[1:04:23] uh 10,000 volt
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; at electric station what is it going to
[1:04:27] do it's going to blow you to pieces
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; you're going to be a fried chicken
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; you don't want to do that
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; but then they use the transformer to
[1:04:35] step it down Right.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; And then even to your home, they step it
[1:04:39] down to what? 110.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; I think UK and certain countries use 220
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; but here they use 110.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; They step it down so that you can
[1:04:46] comfortably plug in your cell phone,
[1:04:48] your stove, refrigerator, whatever you
[1:04:50] want and use it.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; Now eternity is so great that if the
[1:04:53] Lord comes in that dimension, the earth
[1:04:56] will be scooped.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; It will dissolve. It will dissipate.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; So God breaks himself down.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; From the Elohim form. Uh-huh.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; He broke himself down to uh the pillar
[1:05:09] of fire
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; or to the logos. The logos is the
[1:05:11] thought
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; and then he brought himself to the word
[1:05:14] form the theopan
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; which is the same thing in the sixth
[1:05:17] dimension. Then he wanted to become more
[1:05:19] human be part of the earth.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; So now he formed himself into a human
[1:05:23] form called the Rama. I I will we go
[1:05:25] there and show you. So now the eternal
[1:05:28] person which is eternity which is the
[1:05:31] theophony step himself down to the human
[1:05:33] spirit.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Theophony has got only one mind.
[1:05:37] It doesn't have two mind.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; The mind of God or the mind of Elohim is
[1:05:41] one. Christ eternity. That's why God
[1:05:44] doesn't see your mistake.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; All right?
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Because his mind for his son, brother
[1:05:48] Solomon, is eternal person. You are
[1:05:51] spotless. It doesn't matter what
[1:05:52] somebody can see about you. Oh, I know
[1:05:54] that. Oh, maybe. Oh, you were crooked
[1:05:55] here. Oh, you did this here. But the
[1:05:57] mind of Christ doesn't see nothing but
[1:06:00] perfection in you.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; That is our perfection. Amen.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; And then the human spirit has got five
[1:06:07] senses. It's got memory, affection,
[1:06:10] reasoning, imagination, and conscience.
[1:06:13] That is the outlet that it operates.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; And then the human spirit will step down
[1:06:17] even further to the flesh body.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. The flesh body is
[1:06:22] part of the earth.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; The earth is our mother.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; And our flesh is part of our mother.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; That is the new Jerusalem. Amen. So now
[1:06:30] the the flesh has also got five senses.
[1:06:34] What are the five senses? Seeing,
[1:06:36] hearing, touching, what else? Feeling
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; and tasting.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; And that's the senses that we operate
[1:06:42] in. Now there are certain condition that
[1:06:45] so you have more or less if you put it
[1:06:46] together five from the human spirit,
[1:06:49] five from the flesh and then one from
[1:06:51] the theopani. So which is 11. But there
[1:06:53] are certain situation that all the 10
[1:06:56] senses, 10 outlet cannot help you. You
[1:06:59] have to move to the to the only
[1:07:01] dimension that can help you. That is the
[1:07:03] 11th sorry not dimension the 11 sense
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; which is what that's what you press
[1:07:08] eternal button.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Glory hallelujah.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; And we go more further into that. Let's
[1:07:14] go to yeah the uh this uh slice said
[1:07:18] scriptures of temporal and time
[1:07:19] qualities the soul the human spirit and
[1:07:22] the flesh. Psalm 82:6-7
[1:07:25] I've said a gas and all of you are
[1:07:27] children of the most high but you shall
[1:07:29] die like men and fall like one of the
[1:07:32] princes. So you are twofold. You are
[1:07:34] eternal being
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; brother Solomon is always 18 years old
[1:07:39] between 18 to 25 years old.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; Nothing changes no matter how old you
[1:07:43] get.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; You still have that being which is 18
[1:07:46] years in you. Sister Sister Nomi is
[1:07:48] always 18 to about 25 years old.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; You can grow to be 200. That is your
[1:07:52] eternal age.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; But then you we put this flesh on oursel
[1:07:57] to manifest here.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; And this flesh and the human spirit they
[1:08:02] have the ability to die.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; So what is this? That is when the the
[1:08:06] tufunni is eternal. It can never die.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; The human spirit is bridging the the
[1:08:13] flesh. Now when your life is done on
[1:08:15] this earth, the human spirit leave the
[1:08:18] flesh
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; and the theophony. So now the flesh is
[1:08:21] laying there.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; It cannot talk. It doesn't feel nothing.
[1:08:25] Because the flesh is more or less
[1:08:27] neutral.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; What operate the flesh is the human
[1:08:31] spirit and the
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; theophony.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; But when you die, you haven't died. You
[1:08:36] just change your dwelling place.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; You change your clothes.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; It's like after service you go and
[1:08:41] change your clothes. You are not dead.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; Your clothes is hanging on in the
[1:08:45] wardrobe. But you yourself, you might be
[1:08:47] eating. Go put on another clothes and go
[1:08:49] to the restaurant to eat.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; So you just change your dwelling place.
[1:08:52] You change your garment. Amen.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; So now all that you learned from this
[1:08:56] flesh,
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; you put it back through the human
[1:08:59] spirit. Put it back in the theophony.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; On the other side, you're going to
[1:09:02] remember everything that you happen
[1:09:03] here.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; It is still there. The record is still
[1:09:06] there.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; And eternal ones are still there. Amen.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; You don't lose your memory. You're still
[1:09:12] going to have your affections,
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; not the flesh affection. your family,
[1:09:16] your parents, your your mother, your
[1:09:18] children, your wife, your husband, your
[1:09:21] grandchildren. You're still going to
[1:09:23] have that relationship on the other
[1:09:24] side.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; But not the way we operate here.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; You're not going to have your dad having
[1:09:28] king and chasing after you.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; It's not going to happen. Your mother is
[1:09:32] not going to give you whipping because
[1:09:34] you were telling lies.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Because it doesn't happen in that
[1:09:37] dimension.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; But your mom is still your mom.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; You're going to be at the same age as
[1:09:41] your mother.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; But you still know that she's my mother.
[1:09:45] He's my father. He's my grandmother.
[1:09:47] He's my great great grandmother.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; You're still going to have that
[1:09:49] relationship.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Just that in the eternal dimension
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; and that is going on right here in this
[1:09:55] dimension.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Only this eyes cannot see.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; Let's break it a little bit further.
[1:09:59] Let's take care. Remember the I think
[1:10:01] it's Camden Ael the blind man colored
[1:10:05] man that was healed prayed for Abraham
[1:10:07] and he got healed.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Remember that story.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. This man was blind
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; and all of us even the children
[1:10:13] understand blindness. What is it? You
[1:10:15] are blind. You cannot see. Isn't it?
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Maybe somebody has to hold your hands to
[1:10:19] walk you around or you have to have your
[1:10:21] king and be walking around because you
[1:10:22] cannot see.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; But now this man was blind.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; And then a dimension open up.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; And this man saw his mom.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; And he was able to recognize his mother.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; How could a blind man see
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; when he was blind?
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Preach.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; Can somebody help me? Maybe some
[1:10:40] doctor's science h technology can help
[1:10:44] me that a blind man is able to see his
[1:10:46] mother
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; because what there's another dimension
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; brother
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; another eyes
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; not this eyes
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; but another eyes way higher
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; with that one you can see all things.
[1:10:58] Amen.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; This one could be scooped out of your
[1:11:01] eyes out of the socket but you still
[1:11:03] have another eyes
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; in your celestial body that you can
[1:11:07] communicate. Amen. Yeah.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; So this man was able to see his mother
[1:11:11] and he said, "Mom," he said, "Get up and
[1:11:12] put on, get ready and go meet a man
[1:11:14] called William Bra. You pray for you and
[1:11:16] you get your eyes."
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; When this woman didn't even meet Abraham
[1:11:20] on earth,
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; how could you know that there was a man
[1:11:22] called William Brah on earth
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; praying for the sick?
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Somebody can tell me, balance this
[1:11:27] equation for me.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; My God, brother.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; How did she know?
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; That there's a human being called
[1:11:35] William. is a prophet of God on earth
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; and that man can pray for his son
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; who was blind and his son will receive
[1:11:42] his eyes.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to raise us to something.
[1:11:45] Amen.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; That you don't panic. I'm not there yet.
[1:11:48] You don't panic when you have situation.
[1:11:50] Amen.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; When you have whatever situation, my
[1:11:52] brother, my sister, just press the
[1:11:54] eternal dime the eternal button.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; Whatever you go through, just press it.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; So, brother, I don't have my You don't
[1:12:02] even have hands. You don't need your
[1:12:03] hands to press that dimension.
[1:12:06] You don't need your foot to to press it.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Just press it from your heart.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Press it from your thought. Amen.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; And just just relax.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; Don't worry. Don't trigger stress
[1:12:17] hormones.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; We trigger stress hormone because we
[1:12:21] don't we don't connect to that
[1:12:23] dimension.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; We don't press that dimension. But when
[1:12:26] you click that dimension, my brother, no
[1:12:28] stress.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; There is no biggie. There's no
[1:12:31] situation. There's no problem.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Everything is a deal done. Amen. Amen.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; Because there's an eye, the allseeing
[1:12:37] eye
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; way than this eyes that the devil is
[1:12:40] pointing that the problems in your
[1:12:42] family to you,
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; you see something better in your
[1:12:44] children. You see something better in
[1:12:46] your marriage. You see something better
[1:12:48] in your business. You see something
[1:12:49] better in your brothers and sisters.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; Because there's an eye which sees beyond
[1:12:53] this eyes.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah to the Lord.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; So we are human. We are gods. On the
[1:12:59] flesh we can die. But in your celestial
[1:13:02] dimension, death does not exist.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; Crying does not exist.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; Pain does not exist.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Healing does not even exist because you
[1:13:12] can't get sick. How can you be healed
[1:13:13] when you don't get sick?
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; Forgiveness doesn't exist in that
[1:13:16] dimension.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Here we get forgiveness. Amen. We get
[1:13:20] repentance. You can cry. You can be sad.
[1:13:23] But the funny cannot cry
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; because it's eternal.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; He's got one mind looking at you.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. And when you
[1:13:31] drop here on this earth because you are
[1:13:33] eternal dimension there was a portion of
[1:13:36] eternity that was in you when your your
[1:13:39] you pop from your mother's womb
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; right here
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; regardless of how you were born
[1:13:44] regardless of your family background
[1:13:46] regardless of your situation.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; There was something eternal about you.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; Remember the story of Abraham when he
[1:13:54] was born and a pillar of fire came to
[1:13:56] the room.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; Because he was a prophet. that he's
[1:13:59] going to go around the world seven times
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; to vindicate the word of the Lord.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; So the Lord let the pill of fire come
[1:14:04] physically for the parent to see.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Even still people struggle. They still
[1:14:08] don't believe.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; They still feel like certain things that
[1:14:11] happened were not real.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; But for you, the same thing happened to
[1:14:14] you.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; When you were born, the Almighty came
[1:14:18] down and placed himself in you.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; A portion that you find, the celestial
[1:14:22] being that was in you before the
[1:14:23] foundation of the world was placed in
[1:14:25] you. Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; Though you have your physical form,
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; your physical senses, you had your
[1:14:32] mistakes going through life not even
[1:14:34] knowing who you were.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Did you know you were a child of God?
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; The devil was controlling your life,
[1:14:39] drinking, smoking, partying, and
[1:14:41] whatever you were doing because the old
[1:14:43] man was in you.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; But when the time came that the control
[1:14:47] tower,
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; the owner of you,
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; the one who made this flesh to dwell in,
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; you said, "Okay, it's my time."
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; It's just like you buy a house or you
[1:14:55] build a house. Somebody can go.
[1:14:57] Squatters can go live in there.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; You just let them let them live in
[1:15:00] there. But when it's time,
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; you just take your key and then you go
[1:15:04] to the place and you drive all the
[1:15:06] squatters away.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; And then you what? You begin to inhabit
[1:15:09] your room.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; When the true owner, the Lord Jesus
[1:15:14] Christ is ready,
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; then he gives you what you call the new
[1:15:17] birth, the Holy Ghost baptism.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost baptism is death and
[1:15:22] remarry.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. You die to the old husband,
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; which is the old soul, the old nature,
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; and then you remarry to Jesus Christ.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible said, "Repent
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:15:34] Christ
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; and it shall be forgiven of your sins."
[1:15:37] That's Acts chapter 2:38.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; And the gift of the Holy Ghost because
[1:15:41] it's a gift. It's not your choice.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; It was ordained for you before the
[1:15:44] foundation of the world.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; That's why we call it a gift.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; It's not a gift of tongue speaking,
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; but this is eternal gift to you.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. the true you. Amen.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; That is your identity.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; That was pronounced on you that came
[1:15:58] into you to dwell in your flesh body.
[1:16:00] And right away we became a twofold
[1:16:01] person. You are still a human being.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; You could still feel pain. You can still
[1:16:06] get angry. You can get angry. But
[1:16:08] there's another person in you that can
[1:16:11] connect to the eternity.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Angels of God begin to deal with you.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; Eternal dimension begin to operate in
[1:16:17] you. You begin to sing songs that you
[1:16:18] don't even think about. God shows you
[1:16:20] dreams and visions and it begin to
[1:16:22] something in you greater than yourself,
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; greater than this flesh begin to control
[1:16:26] your life.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; And connect you to know that you are not
[1:16:29] from this world.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; You are always in eternity. Amen.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; You are always a daughter of God.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; You are always a son of God.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; And you begin to manifest the glory of
[1:16:40] the Lord in your life.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Let's go to the next slide.
[1:16:47] The next slide is theomi. Theo means
[1:16:49] just theophony or Christ. Morphe means
[1:16:52] changing forms
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; and God can change his forms in
[1:16:55] different way. He can change his
[1:16:56] attribute. And so God wanted to mix the
[1:16:59] tenor attribute which is a theophony and
[1:17:02] the temporal attribute the earth to
[1:17:04] manifest in this earth to come into
[1:17:06] time. So if you read 2 Corinthians 5:1-4
[1:17:10] let's just pick the first verse. For we
[1:17:13] know that if our earthly house of this
[1:17:15] tabernacle were dissolved, that is a
[1:17:17] temporal attribute. We have a building
[1:17:19] of God, which is a tenor attribute, or a
[1:17:21] building of Elohim, and house not made
[1:17:24] with hands, a tener in the heavens.
[1:17:26] Let's just crest on this one. A house
[1:17:29] not made with hands. This is not the
[1:17:32] human being that was born through the
[1:17:34] attribute of your father and your
[1:17:35] mother.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; That is a house made with hands. You can
[1:17:38] decide when you marry, you can decide,
[1:17:40] okay, I don't want to have children. I
[1:17:41] mean a couple of years I want to work I
[1:17:43] want to have fun I want to travel with
[1:17:44] my husband my wife whatever and then
[1:17:46] when you are ready to give birth to
[1:17:48] children that is not the the house that
[1:17:51] is not a ch child that child can go back
[1:17:53] to the earth
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; but now there's another child on the
[1:17:56] inside that is the the building wasn't
[1:17:59] made by men and women
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; that building didn't come through sex
[1:18:03] but that building came by what the
[1:18:05] spoken word of the living Christ
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; blessed be the name of the Lord and when
[1:18:09] you were created you were made God on
[1:18:12] this earth. Our original purpose is to
[1:18:14] root the earth.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; Go let's go. I don't have time to read
[1:18:18] but go reference to Adam. When Adam was
[1:18:21] was put on earth, he was an eternal
[1:18:23] theophony.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; But now Adam and his wife, Mrs. Adam,
[1:18:27] their names were called Adam, Mr. and
[1:18:29] Mrs. Amen. There was nothing like Eve.
[1:18:31] Eve came in when the four came in.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; So when Adam was on earth, he could
[1:18:37] speak. If Adam wanted to play
[1:18:38] instrument, he doesn't need to get a
[1:18:40] manufacturer to put together some
[1:18:44] guitar, some piano, whatever. But Adam
[1:18:46] can just speak just by thought. Guitar
[1:18:48] will come from the earth and you place
[1:18:50] and strum it and and just glorify the
[1:18:52] Lord. And then after he's done, it will
[1:18:55] bring back to the earth.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Adam and his wife were not naked.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; They had clothes. It wasn't sewn by
[1:19:03] seamstress. It wasn't by what are small
[1:19:06] the designers by by um Calvin Klein and
[1:19:10] Versace and whatever
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; sisters you name them where you where
[1:19:14] your ladies bags and expensive clothes
[1:19:16] are from. No, that's not the one. This
[1:19:19] one is by what? From Adam's own mouth
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; because he was a son of God. Adam can
[1:19:25] switch into the celestial form and come
[1:19:27] back to the earthly form. Just like
[1:19:29] Mechisedc when the Lord came to visit
[1:19:32] Abraham, he was eternal being but he
[1:19:35] came in a human being. Even his feets
[1:19:36] were dirty walking on on on the street
[1:19:38] of Palestine cuz it was desert and
[1:19:41] Abraham had to wash his feet.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; That was I think if that was the first
[1:19:45] feet washing and Abraham gave him milk
[1:19:48] and and food. How can almighty how can a
[1:19:50] spirit eat milk?
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; The theophony cannot eat milk.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; But then when the theophony put on flesh
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; yes sir.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:58] wear suits, wear clothing,
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; that the can put on can drink milk,
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; can eat cheese,
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; can do whatever a human being can do.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. And Adam had that power in him.
[1:20:09] The spoken word power. But when the fell
[1:20:12] came, that power was gone.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; That's when Adam begin feel like I could
[1:20:16] speak and and and do things. I could
[1:20:19] speak white clothes, rose dresses, blue
[1:20:22] dresses, whatever you want. But Eve
[1:20:24] realized, Mrs. Eve or Mrs. Adam realized
[1:20:26] that things are different. Yeah.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; When you speak, eternity is not backing
[1:20:30] the word.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; If you don't live the life of Christ,
[1:20:33] your word is nothing.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; God cannot operate in in in lies and in
[1:20:39] deception and in filthiness.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; That is not God. Amen.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; You have to give yourself as a
[1:20:45] consecrated vessel to the Lord to use
[1:20:47] you. Amen. That's why the prophet, one
[1:20:49] of the quote said, "Young ladies,
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; keep your morals,
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; Keep yourself clean. Young men, keep
[1:20:55] your morals
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; and let the Lord take over your life.
[1:20:58] Amen.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Don't rush yourself. If you rush
[1:21:01] yourself, you're going to crash.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; But if you wait on the Lord, the Lord
[1:21:05] will give you everything that you need.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; Whatever you have, just press the
[1:21:10] button. And so, brother, I've pressed
[1:21:12] the button. I've been sick for maybe a
[1:21:13] year, a month. Just relax. You're
[1:21:15] already healed.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; Whatever you need, husband, wife,
[1:21:18] children, money, houses, business,
[1:21:20] millions, billions, it's already in you.
[1:21:23] Amen. Amen.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Press the button and just wait on the
[1:21:26] Lord.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; So, brother, I've been waiting for
[1:21:28] years.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; God is preparing it for you.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you a story of a preacher in
[1:21:33] America. This preacher after preaching
[1:21:35] went to the restaurant with his family
[1:21:36] to go get some food to eat. They ordered
[1:21:39] their food, waiting for their food. 5
[1:21:42] minutes, 10 minutes, 30 minutes, the
[1:21:44] food wasn't coming. And people come in,
[1:21:46] people just came in within 5 minutes,
[1:21:48] they've got their food, 2 minutes. and
[1:21:50] he was getting upset like probably did
[1:21:52] they forget about my order. So he went
[1:21:54] to uh the receptionist and said you know
[1:21:57] I ordered such and such for my family.
[1:21:59] We've been here for 45 minutes but I see
[1:22:01] people coming in here and get their
[1:22:03] food. What's going on here? So oh we
[1:22:05] haven't forgotten about you. Your order
[1:22:07] is in process. Yours is a special order.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; You ordered homemade food.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; So he opened the window said look at the
[1:22:14] chef. He's preparing your order.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. And the preacher said, "When my
[1:22:20] order came, it was exactly the way I
[1:22:22] wanted it.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; The chicken was fried just right. The
[1:22:26] whatever the spices, I mean, the fries,
[1:22:29] the rice, everything was just right,
[1:22:31] just spot on, the way you wanted it.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; And when you pray to to God for
[1:22:35] something and you think it's delaying,
[1:22:36] no, God is yours is a special order.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; It's not a it's not a 5 minutes fast
[1:22:44] food. It's a homemade homegrown
[1:22:46] tomatoes. And God has to water it and
[1:22:49] and and just nurture it and take care of
[1:22:51] it and the right time. He said, "My son,
[1:22:53] my daughter, this is what I prepared for
[1:22:55] you."
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; God.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; You don't have to rush. Amen.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; Be patient. Amen.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; Before even you prayed and cried out,
[1:23:05] the Lord knows what you need.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; But you have a special order before the
[1:23:09] Lord. And he prepared a special order
[1:23:10] for you.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; Just be patient. And when the Lord
[1:23:12] brings it to you, God will give an
[1:23:14] angel. If you rush, you're going to get
[1:23:16] a devil
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; who painted himself as an angel.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Because you wanted, you just wanted an
[1:23:22] angel.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; I want to be Nobody. My friend, don't
[1:23:24] tell me I'm beautiful. Oh my goodness. I
[1:23:26] met this this guy. He said I'm so
[1:23:29] gorgeous. I'm beautiful. I'm the queen
[1:23:31] of West Palm Beach. Oh my goodness. My
[1:23:34] dad never told me I'm the princess. My
[1:23:36] mom never told me so. And he gives you
[1:23:38] flowers. Brother Jack said flowers from
[1:23:39] from the gas station, right?
[1:23:42] and you fall for that flowers and oh my
[1:23:45] goodness, guess what? I've got this guy.
[1:23:47] He's an angel. I've got my angel from
[1:23:49] heaven. He's so handsome. He's so cute.
[1:23:51] You just give him time.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; When the time comes, when he get you
[1:23:55] pregnant,
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; he doesn't remember you no more.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; There was this this happened and a lady
[1:24:05] found a guy in club and this lady got
[1:24:08] pregnant. So, and the guy was in
[1:24:10] college. So they went to the college to
[1:24:12] find out who is this guy because they
[1:24:15] met in club. So they they as a the
[1:24:17] mother went to the to the principal that
[1:24:20] one of your student got my daughter
[1:24:21] pregnant. Okay. I've got many students.
[1:24:23] Which one of them? And he said he has a
[1:24:25] daughter. He said it's called copper
[1:24:26] sulfate. Copper sulfate. Copperate is a
[1:24:29] chemical in the lab. So the guy used his
[1:24:31] nickname. He didn't give give the girl
[1:24:33] the right name.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Who is copper sulfate? If somebody comes
[1:24:37] Jack one of your one of your sons called
[1:24:39] copper sulfitit copper is in the the lab
[1:24:42] it's not in the church
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; and they couldn't find who got the the
[1:24:46] girl pregnant cuz the guy gave his name
[1:24:48] as copper sulfit
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; and there's nobody called copper
[1:24:51] sulfate.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; You see how the devil can be can be can
[1:24:54] can be shed
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; can deceive you and destroy your life.
[1:24:59] So if you want to get married to copper
[1:25:00] sulfate go get yourself a husband from
[1:25:02] the club.
[1:25:04] You're going to get a copper sulfit.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; That's why God said, "Wait on me." I
[1:25:22] say, "Wait."
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; For he knows what he's doing. Amen.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; You have to have trust in the Lord
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; that if he molded you to get to this
[1:25:31] age, he has something for your life.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; He's teaching you patience and
[1:25:35] character.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; And when God before God will give you
[1:25:38] blessing, he want you have to form
[1:25:39] himself his character in you
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; so that when the blessing come, you can
[1:25:43] handle it to the glory of the Lord.
[1:25:45] Amen.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Praise be to the Lord. Let's go to the
[1:25:48] next slide.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; I think we did this one.
[1:25:51] H it's also talking about the some of
[1:25:53] the temporal attribute which is death.
[1:25:55] But when we receive the word we believe
[1:25:57] the word we move from life into we move
[1:26:00] from death into life. Same thing
[1:26:02] Ephesians if you go there. So let's go
[1:26:04] let's go to the next slide. Praise be to
[1:26:07] the Lord. Now this talking about Jesus.
[1:26:09] Jesus was made made better than the
[1:26:11] angels. Hebrews 1:4 which is in the
[1:26:14] celestial form as the almighty God. He
[1:26:17] was way beyond even the angels of
[1:26:19] heaven. Right?
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; He was way beyond any person because he
[1:26:22] was the king of kings.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; But now this person turned himself
[1:26:27] unmorphed himself, theomorph himself
[1:26:30] from that celestial glorious attribute
[1:26:33] to a form of a servant
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; right
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; to die for you and I.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; He became the lowest of the lowest of
[1:26:38] the low
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; till even his creation couldn't
[1:26:42] recognize him.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; He was despised. One time the Grecians
[1:26:45] wanted to see God and so they arranged
[1:26:48] with the disciple. We've heard that you
[1:26:49] you guys have Jesus Christ one a man
[1:26:51] called Jesus. He's the almighty God. And
[1:26:54] they came to see Jesus Christ. Spanish
[1:26:56] people call it Kakara face to face. How
[1:26:59] language in Africa said Ghani Ghani face
[1:27:01] to face. They saw almighty God but they
[1:27:04] couldn't recognize him. They saw a man
[1:27:07] they couldn't see the character of
[1:27:08] Christ in Jesus. They saw the Jesus the
[1:27:11] flesh but the Christ they didn't see.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; For you to see the Christ you have to
[1:27:16] have something in you called Christ.
[1:27:18] deep calling onto the deep.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; If there's no deep in you, when the word
[1:27:22] of the Lord is revealed to you, you
[1:27:23] won't see it. You're going to see
[1:27:24] brother Jack. You're going to see Erica.
[1:27:26] You're going to see Brother Solomon.
[1:27:27] You're going to see Brother Quinton Jr.,
[1:27:29] but you will see Jesus Christ. But when
[1:27:31] there's something there, when brother
[1:27:34] Smiley is preaching, you're not going to
[1:27:36] see Brother Smiley, but you're going to
[1:27:38] see Jesus Christ speaking from Brother
[1:27:40] Smiley to your heart.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; When a sister is giving a testimony,
[1:27:44] you're not going to see the sister.
[1:27:45] They're going to see Christ
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; manifest himself in the sister.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. So the
[1:27:50] Lord become lower than the angel. Move
[1:27:53] himself from the theophony form to the
[1:27:55] earthly form to manifest himself. Praise
[1:27:57] be to the Lord. Let's keep on going.
[1:28:02] Oh, I love this scripture. John 5:1
[1:28:04] 17-19. That's my script. There are
[1:28:07] certain scriptures I I we go there. He
[1:28:09] said, "But Jesus answered and said, my
[1:28:10] father worketh hitherto and I work."
[1:28:13] That is learning to be sensitive to the
[1:28:15] spirit that is in you. You don't go
[1:28:17] ahead of God.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; You let him lead you step by step.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; And what are the ways to find the will
[1:28:23] of the Lord? Prayers. The word number
[1:28:26] one. You know when God made you, he put
[1:28:28] a what do you call it? Aon the high
[1:28:30] priest. What was in Aeron's robe is it
[1:28:33] urim urim. Right
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; now that was able to detect lie. It's
[1:28:38] like modern day lie detector. That was
[1:28:42] kind of order of that.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; The lie detectors is is a type of the
[1:28:46] urine theme.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; So if you prophesy something is truth,
[1:28:48] you you speak it before the urine theme
[1:28:50] is going to reflect the lie. If it
[1:28:52] doesn't reflect, my brother, it's a lie.
[1:28:55] The devil spoke to you.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; So God put the urine in you
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; as a lie detector
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; so that when the devil speaks a lie,
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; right,
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; it doesn't ring a bell here.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; Exactly. Right.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; It doesn't Theophan in me doesn't eat
[1:29:08] this. Amen.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; There's something in me that reject
[1:29:10] this. It's not of the Lord.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; I cast it to the bottomless pit.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; But when it's Christ and you see the the
[1:29:17] the the glistening of the light,
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; there's a spark. Then you know that this
[1:29:21] is the Almighty speaking.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; And you take that word and you can run
[1:29:25] the whole world with it. Amen.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Because it's not you. It's the Almighty
[1:29:28] manifesting himself.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the Lord.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Glory. And verse 18. Okay. And they were
[1:29:35] accusing Jesus of being himself, making
[1:29:36] himself equal with God. Verse 19 is my
[1:29:38] scripture. Then answered Jesus and said
[1:29:41] unto them, verily, verily, I say unto
[1:29:43] you, the son, which is the flesh, Jesus
[1:29:46] can do nothing of himself, but what he
[1:29:49] sees, the father, the Christ on the
[1:29:51] inside doing soever Jesus does.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; Whatever he see the father, the pillar
[1:29:57] of fire in him, direct him to do, that's
[1:30:00] what the sun doeth. And if you can
[1:30:02] partner ourel, if you can grasp the
[1:30:04] revelation in this scripture that in
[1:30:06] your life, if God put something in your
[1:30:08] life to do and he said this is the Lord,
[1:30:11] nothing can stop you.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; But if it's not of the Lord, just pack
[1:30:14] it aside.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; Because God is not going to back it.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; So Jesus even walk with what? With
[1:30:19] reference, with sensitivity to the
[1:30:20] spirit. And the Lord help us and teach
[1:30:22] us to be sensitive to the Holy Ghost
[1:30:24] that when he moves, we move, when he
[1:30:26] stops, we stop
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; because that's where you have your
[1:30:28] victory. Amen. Amen.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; If you go ahead ahead of yourself and do
[1:30:31] something that's not of the Lord, God is
[1:30:33] not going to back you.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; If you go and slap the police and fight
[1:30:37] the police,
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; you're going to get yourself in trouble.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; God is not going to back you on that.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; Cuz the Bible said respect authority.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; But then if you go, you don't respect
[1:30:47] the authority and you get shot, that is
[1:30:49] on you.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; But if you stand on the word, the police
[1:30:53] can shoot you.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; Nothing will happen.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; Because there's somebody in you. There's
[1:30:59] a bulletproof around you.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Let's
[1:31:03] keep going
[1:31:05] now. God, let me see. I think I went
[1:31:08] over.
[1:31:10] Give me one moment. I think I went over.
[1:31:27] Okay, here we go. Yes, that is Matthew
[1:31:30] the the one of the scriptures that is
[1:31:32] temporal attributes when the Pharisees
[1:31:34] came to Jesus and they were talking
[1:31:36] about I mean I'm not going to read it
[1:31:38] because we read it already they were
[1:31:39] talking about a man had a wife and he
[1:31:42] died and in those time when you die and
[1:31:44] you don't give birth to children your
[1:31:46] brother has to marry the wife and all
[1:31:47] the seven brothers married this wife and
[1:31:50] none of them and so they were asking
[1:31:51] Jesus on the other side in the
[1:31:53] resurrection whose wife is going to be
[1:31:55] because all the seven had a all the
[1:31:57] churches.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said that you you don't you
[1:32:01] don't know the scriptures.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; But on the other side, there's nothing
[1:32:04] like marriage.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; That's what he said.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Marriage is what? Here.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; And what is marriage?
[1:32:12] When you talk about marriage in the
[1:32:14] Bible, of course, we know the natural
[1:32:15] marriage, weddings, not no talking about
[1:32:18] supernatural marriage.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; Marriage is between a man and a a woman
[1:32:23] and a man, a man, which we all know.
[1:32:25] Right.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; So marriage is what? The new birth. When
[1:32:29] you act 2:38, repent and be baptized in
[1:32:33] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. When
[1:32:34] you get when you repent and Brajak
[1:32:37] marries you to the Lord,
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; all right,
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; he takes you to the pond or the river,
[1:32:40] the lake, wherever, and you confess that
[1:32:44] this day I take the Lord Jesus Christ as
[1:32:47] my lawful husband.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; I'll be faithful to him and I'll give
[1:32:51] all my heart to him. Amen.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; And the Lord also already made his
[1:32:54] confession that Lord in your name the
[1:32:56] pastor will baptize you. The minister
[1:32:58] will baptize you in the name of the Lord
[1:33:00] Jesus Christ. And now you have a name
[1:33:02] change. Your name is changed from the
[1:33:04] earthly name to the heavenly name.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; What is a name? Not name.
[1:33:09] That is that's a type of a name.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; But a true name is what? It's a nature.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; It's an identity.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; So what is that nature? Is the celestial
[1:33:18] nature that comes to you? And when a man
[1:33:20] marries a wife, the man plant his life
[1:33:21] in the woman to what? To be pregnant and
[1:33:23] bring forth after the kind of the man
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; and the woman.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Amenise.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; When you get married to the Lord Jesus
[1:33:36] Christ, what does he do? He does the
[1:33:38] same thing. He plant his life. What is
[1:33:41] life? The Holy Spirit baptism,
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; the new birth
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; into your heart and you become a brand
[1:33:46] new person. Amen. All the old stuff is
[1:33:49] gone away.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; Let's keep going.
[1:33:55] Just give me a moment.
[1:34:01] Let's uh the code is 64313.
[1:34:03] He said when the eyes were open
[1:34:06] they knew in him paragraph 16. And I
[1:34:08] said and I and as I said late night last
[1:34:12] night God loted that scripture his
[1:34:14] scripture from the beginning before
[1:34:16] there was any time when he was eternal
[1:34:17] I'll skip some of them I'll go and the
[1:34:19] whole thing is God unfolding himself in
[1:34:21] his attributes and then God being made
[1:34:23] material tangible that we can talk to
[1:34:26] speak and his whole church the body and
[1:34:29] everything therefore your name was in in
[1:34:31] his thinking that that's how you have
[1:34:34] eternal life
[1:34:36] you can't come no other way. If you got
[1:34:38] eternal life, you always was.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; And I want you to absorb the scripture
[1:34:42] that if you got eternal life, you always
[1:34:45] got because it's eternal. It didn't have
[1:34:46] a beginning on earth. It begins in you,
[1:34:48] but you always was. If you go to the
[1:34:51] bottom, he said anything that had was
[1:34:53] anything that was eternal never did
[1:34:54] begin and cannot end. So you were only
[1:34:56] in his thinking. Your name, who you are
[1:34:59] and what you are, that is the only way
[1:35:01] you could ever have eternal life cuz you
[1:35:04] always was.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. That is your predestination
[1:35:07] eternal blessing that you cannot go away
[1:35:10] from your your salvation. You can lose
[1:35:12] the joy of your salvation.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; You can do something that God will give
[1:35:15] you enough time. You had enough time to
[1:35:17] do what you did right. He'll give you
[1:35:18] enough time to pay for it. But your
[1:35:20] salvation, your redemption is always
[1:35:22] intact.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to the next one.
[1:35:28] That is the logos step down processes of
[1:35:30] Elohim. God broken himself down from the
[1:35:33] logos from which is the thought the
[1:35:34] seventh dimension God hardness in his
[1:35:37] thinking then it's means he change
[1:35:40] himself move itself step down into the
[1:35:43] theopanic which is the sixth dimension
[1:35:45] which is the word body
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; and then that wasn't sufficient God
[1:35:49] become object of worship we were
[1:35:50] worshiping him angels were worshiping
[1:35:52] him but he wanted to become more
[1:35:53] tangible in this earth
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; so now he broke himself he move himself
[1:35:57] back down further into the rama just
[1:36:00] like electricity from uh 10,000 volt
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; into a,000 volt and then to 110
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; to the usable form because in those
[1:36:08] forms the earth cannot contain it.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; So he step himself down even further
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; to the remma which is the expression in
[1:36:14] earth
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; which is the first second and third
[1:36:16] dimension where we dwell in the physical
[1:36:18] form
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; blessed be the name of the lord
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; god.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Let's go to the next one and I think
[1:36:24] this one we read it over and over. He
[1:36:26] said talking about he said you are you
[1:36:29] are in Tennessee. God is going to give
[1:36:30] us more blessing in 2026.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; I believe
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; and as we going to go more blessing
[1:36:36] we're going to eat more than we have
[1:36:37] been eating already.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why Jack started a new
[1:36:41] series. Amen. He's going to give more
[1:36:43] word. And the more we eat, the more we
[1:36:45] drink, the more we grow fat. We get we
[1:36:48] put on flesh.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:36:51] If you don't eat, if you don't drink,
[1:36:53] we're not going to be able to produce
[1:36:54] what we supposed to produce.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; So now you talk about use Tennessee said
[1:36:58] they grow apples and what do they do?
[1:37:00] I'll skip to the uh the blue line. He
[1:37:02] said it drinks and drinks and then just
[1:37:05] drink
[1:37:06] till just it can't drink no more and it
[1:37:08] pushes out a limbs. You drink and drink
[1:37:11] and drink and then you bring out
[1:37:12] justification. Then it drinks some more
[1:37:15] and push it out leaves. Then you bring
[1:37:17] out sanctification. It drinks some more
[1:37:19] and push it out blossoms. Then it drinks
[1:37:21] some more and he push it out peaches.
[1:37:23] Then he drinks some more and push it out
[1:37:25] more peaches. He keep drinking and keep
[1:37:27] pushing out and you can read the rest.
[1:37:29] He said and now that's the way that
[1:37:31] Christian life is. What when a man or a
[1:37:34] woman or a child is born of the of the
[1:37:35] spirit of God then everything that you
[1:37:37] have need of in this world and the world
[1:37:39] to come is given to you.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; Can we absorb it?
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you are born by the word of
[1:37:46] the Lord, whatever you need on this
[1:37:48] earth and the other dimension is given
[1:37:50] in you.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; Glory, you will receive the Holy Spirit
[1:37:54] and you are planted in Christ. And to my
[1:37:56] estimation of Christ, he's the
[1:37:57] inexhaustible fountain of life and you
[1:38:01] are just planted in him and drink and
[1:38:03] drink and push it out some more and
[1:38:04] drink and push it out some more. Amen.
[1:38:06] So you drink the word of the Lord and
[1:38:09] you push it out limbs.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; You drink more and you push it out. Let
[1:38:12] me use Peter for example. When the Lord
[1:38:14] called Peter, he wasn't perfect the
[1:38:16] first day.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; He didn't even understand who he was.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; What he knew was cutting ears. If you
[1:38:22] mess with him, he'll fight you. And
[1:38:24] that's what to defend himself. And so
[1:38:26] somebody got got mess with his master.
[1:38:28] What did he do? Pull his dagger, cut off
[1:38:31] his ears.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; That was Peter.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; But the Lord was showing that no, Peter,
[1:38:35] this is not a battle we are in.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; It's not a physical battle. We don't cut
[1:38:38] ears. We don't sleep people. So the Lord
[1:38:40] took the years and put it back to him
[1:38:42] and Peter learned I never knew that. So
[1:38:45] he learned forgiveness
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; that when somebody does something
[1:38:48] against you, there's something in you to
[1:38:50] forgive
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; because you are eternal being. So Peter
[1:38:53] begin to learn. And as he was walking
[1:38:55] with Jesus, he be now he drink he drank
[1:38:57] that uh he keep on drinking and push out
[1:39:00] for forgiveness. And then one time he
[1:39:02] saw Jesus Christ walking on water and he
[1:39:05] they were scared to death. How can a man
[1:39:07] walk on water? Right.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; And the Lord said, "It is I be not
[1:39:10] afraid and said, Lord, beat me to come."
[1:39:12] Said, "Come on in."
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; Son, come on in.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; And Peter begin to walk.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; Walk step by step. He was excited. All
[1:39:18] the people, Andrew and the brothers,
[1:39:20] wow, brother Peter, you're doing
[1:39:21] awesome. And then he got to the middle
[1:39:23] of the river and said, "hm, this is
[1:39:24] dangerous. What about if I sink?" And
[1:39:27] then when doubt came in, he began to
[1:39:29] sink.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; And then he the Lord helped me. And the
[1:39:32] Lord helped him.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; He was training him. Amen.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; And then he was able to what? go to the
[1:39:37] other side.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; Same thing in our life. We might not be
[1:39:40] perfect the first day God called you.
[1:39:42] He's still working on you, but keep
[1:39:43] drinking.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; When you drink,
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; it's going to the first miracle is you
[1:39:48] had a headache.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; And you prayed a simple prayer and the
[1:39:50] headache was gone. Wow. I've never
[1:39:52] experienced anything anything like that
[1:39:53] in my life.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; I've always have headache. I have to
[1:39:56] take a Tylenol, but this time I prayed
[1:39:58] and it worked. Wow.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; So that sunk in your heart. And now your
[1:40:02] brother is sick. Oh, I can pray for you,
[1:40:04] bro. Your sister, sister, I can pray for
[1:40:06] you.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; And you pray and the sister is healed.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; Wow. Who am I? I can pray for people to
[1:40:12] be healed.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; You keep drinking.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; And now you pray for cancer. The cancer
[1:40:17] is healed.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; Wow. This is way out of control.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; Somebody misplaced something money.
[1:40:24] Don't worry. You prayed and the p came
[1:40:26] back to where it was.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; No. Lord, this is like too overwhelming.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; Keep drinking. And the more you drink,
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; the more the attribute come out of you.

[1:40:43] same thing. Keep drinking. Oh, let me
[1:40:45] see. It looks like I jump. Okay, I think
[1:40:48] I need to read this one. I have How many

[1:40:53] God.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; Okay, praise God. Earthly body
[1:40:56] dissolved. The spiritual body goes
[1:40:58] celestial. Now this is uh questions and
[1:41:00] answers paragraph 19640830e
[1:41:04] number four uh 57 said notice a mother
[1:41:07] she can be ever so mean and cruel but
[1:41:11] just before the baby is born there's
[1:41:13] certain kindness that is certain did you
[1:41:15] ever notice a mother when she's to be a
[1:41:17] mother there's something sweet about her
[1:41:20] she always takes on that sweetness
[1:41:22] because that the little angel little
[1:41:24] spirit a little messenger to this little
[1:41:26] tabernacle is ready to come forth into
[1:41:29] the world. And then uh when this little
[1:41:32] angel comes into the body, the there's
[1:41:35] the that's the little angel of the
[1:41:37] earth, a spirit that is ordained of God
[1:41:39] to take to take up this body. That baby
[1:41:42] has to have a choice. It makes a
[1:41:44] decision. It makes its decision. Then
[1:41:46] when this takes place, then you see the
[1:41:48] angel of the Lord now comes in. Sorry.
[1:41:51] Now comes in here. Yes. Okay. Let me
[1:41:53] read again. Then when this takes place
[1:41:55] then you see the angel of the lord now
[1:41:58] comes in here which is a spiritual body
[1:42:01] that is eternal.
[1:42:04] Amen. Remember I read a code that your
[1:42:06] eternal life. You were always eternal.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; When you were born on this earth because
[1:42:09] you eternal in that dimension that angel
[1:42:12] who is that angel? The Lord himself
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; comes into you and as the baby is going
[1:42:18] around, yes, he's going to grow, make
[1:42:20] mistake, do all kind of stuff, but
[1:42:22] there's a turner about him. Whenever he
[1:42:24] goes to sleep, oh my, let pause here and
[1:42:26] show you something. How precious you are
[1:42:28] before the Lord. God has got one mind
[1:42:31] and that man is brother Solomon Johnson.
[1:42:34] Brother Solomon Johnson has got one
[1:42:35] mind. That one man is sister knowing me.
[1:42:37] God has got one mind is on brother Jack
[1:42:39] Dav and sister Eric Kadav. The mind is

[1:42:43] Let me use what Abraham Abraham in his
[1:42:45] meeting the early stage he was very poor
[1:42:47] man you know and he goes to I think some
[1:42:49] of the hotels they didn't even have a
[1:42:51] bathroom in the in the room you have to
[1:42:52] go and take shower outside like the old
[1:42:55] school way so one time he was in in in a

[1:43:00] younger brother and Billy Paul the same
[1:43:02] bed he was just a simple I mean man and
[1:43:05] then the angel of the lord came to speak
[1:43:06] with him before the before the meetings
[1:43:09] the angel of the lord will come and tell
[1:43:10] him that you're going to see a minister
[1:43:12] called Jagdav he's wearing this suit

[1:43:30] wall when you were a little child a
[1:43:32] little girl around 15 years old because
[1:43:34] you were younger nothing happened but as
[1:43:36] you grow to about 45 now that this pain
[1:43:39] no morphine no Tylenol no surgery is
[1:43:42] able fix it and you don't even know and
[1:43:44] he see you sees you as a younger h 15y
[1:43:46] old lady and oh I can see you become you
[1:43:49] becoming younger in in my presence you

[1:44:03] your healing
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; so one time the angel of the lord came
[1:44:08] and said he as the angel can my brother
[1:44:10] and my son see That's right.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; And say, "Your son can see me." He works
[1:44:14] for you.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; How blessed. Even if you don't have the
[1:44:17] Holy Ghost, work for your ministry.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; Do the assignment your pastor assigns
[1:44:22] you to do.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; If he tells you to play drum, wash the
[1:44:25] wash the clean,
[1:44:28] do it.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; It is reged in heaven like greed.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; The the pastor assigned this young man,
[1:44:35] this this young lady to to whatever he
[1:44:37] assigned to be a Sunday school teacher.
[1:44:39] There's a blessing eternity. Take note
[1:44:41] of that.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; And so say your son can can see me. So
[1:44:46] put a pillow in the face of Billy Paul
[1:44:48] because he's going to he it will scare
[1:44:50] him to death. He'll pass out. And he
[1:44:51] told he said, "Billy, you remember the
[1:44:52] angel that talked to you about it? He's
[1:44:54] here. Do you like to see him?" Say,
[1:44:55] "Yes, I'm going to take off the pillow
[1:44:57] and kind of slowly get him to kind of
[1:44:59] kind of get acclimatized." And so I
[1:45:01] believe Paul said he took the pillow off
[1:45:03] and the angel was standing at the at the
[1:45:06] corner of the building and he said his
[1:45:07] eyes was on brother Abraham. His side
[1:45:10] wasn't going anywhere. He said his eyes
[1:45:11] is when Abraham is going his eyes is on
[1:45:13] him. His eyes is on Abraham.
[1:45:16] That is how the Lord has set an angel of
[1:45:18] the Lord on you.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; Wherever you are on earth on the flight
[1:45:23] in journey when you are broke when you
[1:45:25] are rich there's an angel of the Lord
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; around you. If you can be sensitive to
[1:45:31] that angel, my brother, you'll be the
[1:45:33] happiest, my brother, you be the
[1:45:34] happiest man.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; You be the happiest woman that is eyes
[1:45:37] on you.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Wherever you go, he's watching you in
[1:45:40] whatever situation.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; He's guiding and protecting you. When
[1:45:43] you move, he move a step. He goes ahead
[1:45:45] of you. He's behind you.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; Whatever he has to do, he will take care
[1:45:49] of you.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; When you can't take yourself, he takes
[1:45:52] care of you.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:45:59] Amen. Let's go to the next one.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; We read I think I read that one already.
[1:46:03] In inexustible fountain. Let me see.
[1:46:06] Yeah. Let's go to the next one. I think
[1:46:09] I go too fast. Let's see. Great. Great.
[1:46:11] I want to I want to finish on time.
[1:46:13] Yeah. Revelation chapter 10. Now, we're
[1:46:15] going to drink a scripture that is for
[1:46:17] you and I our day. If you read
[1:46:19] Revelation 10, I want you to study
[1:46:20] Revelation chapter 10. You can break it
[1:46:22] in three parts. The first part is the
[1:46:24] mighty angel, who was he? The almighty
[1:46:26] Jesus Christ. He put one foot on land
[1:46:29] and one foot on the sea. Do you think
[1:46:30] it's a natural land? West Palm Beach,
[1:46:32] Miami Ocean and then one foot on West
[1:46:34] Palm Beach. No, that's not the kind of
[1:46:36] sea. What is What is sea?
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; Multitude of people,
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; land people. He planted himself in his
[1:46:44] elected seed.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; That was Jesus Christ. And if you read,
[1:46:49] you read up to six is Jesus Christ in
[1:46:51] different forms. Then seven, the scene
[1:46:53] changed. He finished his ministry. He
[1:46:55] gave the baton to what? He's the head.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; He gave the baton to what? To the hand.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; The hand is what? The prophet of the
[1:47:01] Lord.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; In the Old Testament, when the Lord sent
[1:47:03] a prophet, he said the hand of the Lord,
[1:47:05] the judgment hand of the Lord is on
[1:47:07] earth.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; He sent a prophet to uh West Palm Beach
[1:47:10] called Jagdav.
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; And his word is judging the people.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; I don't want to branch. I can branch
[1:47:16] somewhere else. Do you know that you are
[1:47:17] an investigation angel?
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; You.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; Do you know talk about investigation
[1:47:23] angels on earth?
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; That's right. We do have supernatural
[1:47:26] angels
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; that watches over the nations.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; By you, by the spirit of the Lord in
[1:47:31] you, you are an angel. You are
[1:47:33] investigating the earth.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; You're not going to judge the people in
[1:47:35] the time of Solomon. No.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; You're not going to judge the people in
[1:47:39] the time of Abraham,
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; But the people in your time,
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; there's something in you that take
[1:47:44] records
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; of things around you,
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; politics, religion,
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; and transmit you to what? To the
[1:47:50] celestial dimension. Yes. Yes.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; So in that day when the judgment begins,
[1:47:55] the wife through judgment,
[1:47:57] brother Solomon Johnson is going to
[1:48:00] stand as a witness in his community.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; Did you see this man and his family? Did
[1:48:04] you see this young lady and her family?
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; How they conducted himself? Do you see
[1:48:07] this pastor? He could have been a world
[1:48:10] televangelist and get all the money on
[1:48:12] the planet if pastor Jagdav wanted to do
[1:48:15] it. But do you see that he was working
[1:48:17] hand in hand with me,
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; lock with me?
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why were you using the people for
[1:48:22] the money?
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; Why were you deceiving the people?
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; Why were you telling doing fake
[1:48:26] miracles?
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Why were you raising that were
[1:48:29] not
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; Plant people that were not and
[1:48:32] made them pretending to be
[1:48:34] And then he said, "Oh, you
[1:48:36] shake them and say they are healed."
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; And you bring Dallas and buy private
[1:48:39] jet.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; Now he is going to be a judge.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; He's an investig investigation angel in
[1:48:46] West Palm Beach. My sister, wherever you
[1:48:47] are, my brother, you are an angel of the
[1:48:49] Lord that your life, things that go
[1:48:52] around you, it's what? It comes to you
[1:48:54] and you keep it and transmit it to
[1:48:56] heaven. Amen.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; We need a scripture for our day. Let's
[1:49:03] read the scripture. Revelation 10. Now,
[1:49:04] if you come to the verse 7, that was
[1:49:06] William Brah's ministry. Now, verse 8 to
[1:49:09] 11. This is a scripture that we don't
[1:49:10] use that much, but that's you and I our
[1:49:13] scripture for this very day. and you
[1:49:15] want to use it and man let the Lord
[1:49:17] manifest himself. Now let's read it.
[1:49:19] That's the ministry of the wife of
[1:49:20] Christ. God never will never do a man
[1:49:22] will never do nothing and leave his wife
[1:49:24] out.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; The wife is the first person. So William
[1:49:27] Brown was working for what? To bring a
[1:49:29] bride to be married to Jesus Christ.
[1:49:31] Amen.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; So verse 8, and the voice which I heard
[1:49:34] from heaven spake unto me, and said, go
[1:49:36] and take a little book which is open in
[1:49:39] the hand of the angel which stand upon
[1:49:40] the sea and the water. And I went unto
[1:49:43] the angel and said, give me the little
[1:49:45] book and said unto me, take take and eat
[1:49:47] it up, and it shall make that belly
[1:49:48] bitter. It shall make be as sweet as
[1:49:51] honey in their mouth. And I took the
[1:49:52] little book out of the angel's hand and
[1:49:54] ate it up. And it was in my mouth sweet
[1:49:55] as honey. And as soon as I had eaten up,
[1:49:57] it became bitter in my belly. And he
[1:50:00] said unto me, "Thou must prophesy." This
[1:50:02] is where I want us to note. Thou must
[1:50:05] prophesy again before many peoples,
[1:50:09] nations, tongues, and kings.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; So, brother, I'm not a preacher. I'm
[1:50:13] just a sister. Your life prophesies.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; Your character prophesies.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; Your love prophesies. Your deeds
[1:50:21] prophesy. Amen.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Another scripture, Isaiah 2:3, we
[1:50:25] won't have time to break break it
[1:50:27] through, but he said, "And many people
[1:50:28] and many people shall come and say, come
[1:50:30] ye, let us go to the mountain of the
[1:50:32] Lord and to the house of God of Jacob."
[1:50:34] You can put the house of God of William
[1:50:36] Abraham. That's the prophet God sent to
[1:50:38] you. And he will teach you of his way.
[1:50:39] Take William Abraham's message and we we
[1:50:42] walk in his path. For out of Zion shall
[1:50:45] go forth the law and the word of the
[1:50:47] Lord from Jerusalem. Do you know Zion?
[1:50:49] Zion is the wife of Jesus Christ. All
[1:50:51] right.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; Jerusalem is Israel.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; 42. And in that day shall, if you read
[1:50:56] 41, it's talking about seven women who
[1:50:57] said we wear our own clothes. They don't
[1:51:00] want to wear Jesus clothes. They eat
[1:51:02] their food, but only be called by your
[1:51:04] name.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; They want to be called Methodist,
[1:51:07] Christians, Baptist, spoken word, anti
[1:51:10] whatever. But they do not want to eat
[1:51:12] the word coming from the Lord.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; They do not want to wear the wedding
[1:51:15] garment provided by the the the groom.
[1:51:17] They just want to be called Christians.
[1:51:19] And there are millions of people on
[1:51:21] earth. Oh, I'm a Christian. I'm a
[1:51:22] Baptist. I I belong to Spirit and True
[1:51:25] Tabernacle. I belong to whatever you can
[1:51:27] belong to. But that doesn't what make
[1:51:29] you the wife of the lamp.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; The the wife of the lamb receive the
[1:51:33] clothing and the food from the husband.
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. But then this your verse Isaiah
[1:51:39] 4:2 41 is what I talk about the seven uh
[1:51:42] the seven women. But then he said verse
[1:51:44] two he said in that day shall the branch
[1:51:46] of the Lord be beautiful and glorious.
[1:51:49] Who is the branch of the Lord? The wife
[1:51:50] of Jesus Christ. And the fruit of the
[1:51:52] earth shall be shall be excellent and
[1:51:54] comely for them that are escape of
[1:51:56] Israel. God call you from the nations
[1:51:58] and you are escape from the judgment of
[1:52:00] Israel.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; You are not going to be part of the
[1:52:01] judgment of America and the world. Let's
[1:52:03] go on
[1:52:05] now. We're going to eat uh something
[1:52:07] else that the Lord provided for our day.
[1:52:11] uh uh our hope is in God. Verse 23 said
[1:52:15] there there never was an age there never
[1:52:18] was an age any two major prophet on
[1:52:20] earth at one time. There were one minor
[1:52:22] prophet but there were one major
[1:52:25] prophet. There were many minor prophet
[1:52:26] but there were one major prophet and
[1:52:28] Elijah was a prophet unto Elisha came.
[1:52:31] Then Elijah was taken off a double
[1:52:33] portion musicians I think it's do I have
[1:52:37] like five 10 minutes?
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you. God bless you. And then
[1:52:42] Elijah was a a prophet onto Elisha. Then
[1:52:44] when Elijah was taken off, a portion, a
[1:52:46] double portion came to him. So this was
[1:52:49] even before the Ram said that God never
[1:52:51] sent two prophet at the time. Sorry, two
[1:52:53] major prophet and verse uh let me read
[1:52:55] the next one 65 trying to do God a
[1:52:58] service without it being the will of the
[1:53:00] Lord. 65 1127b said not a man god but it
[1:53:04] will come through a prophet. He said now
[1:53:06] he never had two major prophet at the
[1:53:08] same time. Never in the world. See, no
[1:53:10] matter how much two heads cannot be, it
[1:53:13] has to be one head. God has to get one
[1:53:16] man under his control. Amen. He was
[1:53:18] talking about Moses and Elijah. God is
[1:53:20] not going to send two physical prophet
[1:53:22] because God can never it will be
[1:53:23] contrary to the word of the Lord. But as
[1:53:25] we read on, you're going to find out how
[1:53:26] God is going to send it. Now, you can't
[1:53:29] have two pastors. You can't say when you
[1:53:32] are going to preach, he said, I'm going
[1:53:33] to preach for who? Brother Jack. Because
[1:53:35] he's the pastor. But when Jack is going
[1:53:37] to preach, he's not going to say, "I'm
[1:53:38] going to preach for Jack."
[1:53:42] I don't think Raj has ever done it. 20
[1:53:44] something like, "Oh, brother Jack, why
[1:53:45] are you going? I'm going to church. Who
[1:53:46] are you going to preach? I'm going to
[1:53:46] preach for Jack."
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; Which brother Jack? He's the one called
[1:53:50] here to be the prophet of of of the
[1:53:52] church.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; So, he doesn't he preached for the Lord
[1:53:54] to the people of the Lord.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; Even if Jesus in his flesh comes here,
[1:53:57] he's going to recognize brother Jack.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; Remember Jesus went to h went to the
[1:54:02] temple. He sat there until they given
[1:54:04] the scroll
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; and he read a portion that pertain to
[1:54:07] him and he gave it back.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; So God doesn't have to be heard because
[1:54:12] every man is made in his different
[1:54:14] order.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; Our thinking, our personalities, our way
[1:54:18] of doing things.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; If I give you 10 mill $10 million don't
[1:54:21] work for 5 years. Take your first
[1:54:23] vacation.
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; Let me know what will be your bucket
[1:54:25] list. Maybe you want to go go to Dubai.
[1:54:27] I would like to go to the Pyramis in
[1:54:29] Egypt.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; I would like to go to South America. I
[1:54:31] would like to go to in Europe. certain
[1:54:32] places but your vacation list will be
[1:54:34] different. You want to go to Hawaii
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; because we are our humanness. We are
[1:54:38] different.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; We have the same theopani the same Holy
[1:54:41] Spirit
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; the same Christ in us but our human way
[1:54:44] of doing things is never the same.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; Even in family can you can let me you
[1:54:49] can tell me maybe in lunch or dinner the
[1:54:52] mother want to eat this the father want
[1:54:53] to eat this the children want to eat
[1:54:55] this because they are they have
[1:54:56] different hunger different thirst
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; and taste for different things. So let's
[1:55:00] go to the next verse.
[1:55:03] Now this is what the Lord taught us
[1:55:05] here. Oh, wonderful. Most enlarger
[1:55:07] ministry repeats 640802
[1:55:10] future home of the heavenly bridegroom
[1:55:12] and the earthly bride. 474. Remember God
[1:55:15] took Elijah the scriptures if you want
[1:55:18] to note it down. God took Elijah after
[1:55:21] the rapture and translated and I want
[1:55:23] you to underline the word translated and
[1:55:25] transported. Say translated and
[1:55:27] transplanted. Sorry, not transported.
[1:55:29] translated and transplanted him back
[1:55:31] among the people to take the place as a
[1:55:33] prophet among his people. Pretty soon he
[1:55:36] will do that. Oh my brother, this is
[1:55:38] glorious,
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; my sister. And he has kept him alive
[1:55:41] this 2500 years. 2,500 years they alive.
[1:55:45] He is to appear again. 475. Notice
[1:55:48] again, he raised up Moses from the dead.
[1:55:51] Where is his grave? Can anybody find it?
[1:55:53] Read the Bible. Read the book of Jude.
[1:55:55] See Satan the archangel disputing with
[1:55:57] the archangel. Satan said the Lord
[1:55:59] rebuke you. He's speaking over the body
[1:56:00] of Moses. And here Peter, James, and
[1:56:03] John was standing there looking at him
[1:56:05] on Mount Transfigration.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; Exactly. Right.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; So now that's how the Lord brought and
[1:56:11] Elijah about 2500 years ago to man
[1:56:14] transfiguration
[1:56:16] in the aophony body right there in the
[1:56:18] land where the mountain is to be raised
[1:56:20] up again.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; He said, and then 478, and there was
[1:56:23] Moses, the dead has been raised. There
[1:56:26] was Elijah the rapture was still alive
[1:56:28] and there was both represented on this
[1:56:31] holy mountain and Jesus the redeemer
[1:56:33] when God up above him like this
[1:56:36] overshadow him and said this my beloved
[1:56:38] body. Amen.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; And see go further to explain that when
[1:56:42] you die here when when you leave this
[1:56:44] this dimension brother Jack will still
[1:56:46] be a pastor.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; He'll still be breaking words into
[1:56:48] people.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because when when we go to the
[1:56:51] other side all the glorious revelation
[1:56:53] that we have here is going to be a type.
[1:56:55] Wow.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; What is a type? A type is something God
[1:56:57] used before. It was the real word of
[1:56:59] God. But God has progressed further
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; and that become a platform that you step
[1:57:03] upon.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; Just like the Old Testament when Moses
[1:57:05] were killing lambs and Aaron. That was
[1:57:07] the word of the Lord for the hour.
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; Like if you commit sin, every year you
[1:57:11] bring your lamb for your family, they
[1:57:13] kill the lambs and boos and things like
[1:57:14] that. That was yay and aiming for that
[1:57:16] hour. But for us, it's a platform.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; It's a type. It's it's already gone and
[1:57:22] manifested.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; I don't care lambs. You don't kill
[1:57:24] lambs. The lamb is already killed on
[1:57:25] Calvary.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; We just claimed the lamb that was killed
[1:57:29] for us. So become a type. So all the
[1:57:30] glorious thing that we have here is
[1:57:32] going to be a type on the other side.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; Glory. Let's finish and wrap it up.
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Let's
[1:57:38] see. Break it further. Look at Sam. He
[1:57:40] said 4:82. Death doesn't change you.
[1:57:43] Death only changes your dwelling place.
[1:57:46] Remember Samuel when he was dead and
[1:57:48] been buried for two years. He was in
[1:57:50] paradise. Those six dimension has not
[1:57:52] been open like now. And with the witch
[1:57:54] of Endo called him up and Saul
[1:57:57] recognized him. Wow. The man was dead.
[1:58:01] But Saul was able to recognize him.
[1:58:04] Wonderful. And she did too. That's a
[1:58:07] witch. And fell upon her face. He hadn't
[1:58:09] changed one bit. He was still the same
[1:58:11] Samuel after being dead two years. And
[1:58:14] he was still a prophet.
[1:58:17] This should give you hope that when we
[1:58:19] have loved ones, one will go before the
[1:58:21] other. Yes, we are human being. Even
[1:58:23] Jesus cried when his friend Lazarus
[1:58:25] died. I think John 10:30. And Jesus
[1:58:27] wept. That was the scripture. Jesus
[1:58:28] wept. But after weeping, know that your
[1:58:30] mother, your grandmother, your father,
[1:58:32] your children is not dead.
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; He's right there.
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; His clothing is what lay laying in
[1:58:37] state.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; But he or she herself is another
[1:58:40] dimension watching you cry. Oh my my
[1:58:43] son, my daughter, my grandbaby doesn't
[1:58:45] know. She she she doesn't remember
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; that I can't die.
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; Exactly. And he said and he was still a
[1:58:53] prophet and tomorrow that was somewhere
[1:58:55] now someone still prophesied. Remember I
[1:58:56] said I went by Jack lives here. Is it
[1:58:58] going to be a pastor? Is he going to be
[1:59:00] singing songs
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; whatever attribute is going to do it on
[1:59:03] the higher order.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; So Samuel was in the prophesying to the
[1:59:07] witch of Endo and Saul. And he said
[1:59:09] let's go on. He said he was still the
[1:59:11] same Samuel after being dead two years
[1:59:13] and he was still a prophet. He said
[1:59:15] tomorrow you fall in battle your son
[1:59:17] with you and by this time tomorrow night
[1:59:19] you'll be with me. In other words,
[1:59:20] you're not going to perish. You did
[1:59:21] something wrong. You pay for it on this
[1:59:23] earth. Your life is cut short, but
[1:59:25] you're going to be in eternal dimension.
[1:59:28] A Christian, God can never lose one of
[1:59:30] us.
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that is just what happens.
[1:59:33] See, when Moses and then he said when
[1:59:35] Moses and Elijah returns back, Elijah,
[1:59:38] Elijah for Revelation 10, they will be I
[1:59:41] think I didn't I cut the code short. Let
[1:59:43] me see. Oh, they will be prophet.
[1:59:44] Hallelujah. So God will not send then
[1:59:47] God has to bring their parents to be
[1:59:49] born again and then their parents Aaron
[1:59:51] and and not Aaron Job is it Job Moses'
[1:59:55] mother and his father is Amram and his
[1:59:58] great-grandfather Abraham to be born
[2:00:00] into no God will translate them from the
[2:00:02] dimension and they'll manifest here how
[2:00:05] he's going to do it's not my job it's
[2:00:06] not your job man is to believe it's not
[2:00:08] even our scripture
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; amen
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; and we can go further but talk about
[2:00:13] when in his ministry said Mos and Elijah
[2:00:15] were here. A woman, Baptist woman
[2:00:17] prophesied. I said the spirit of Elijah
[2:00:20] will be here. Brother, what's the name?
[2:00:22] Jack Jack
[2:00:24] Mos church and they manifested right
[2:00:27] there. God is so manifesting. Let's go
[2:00:29] to the next slide. I want to share a
[2:00:31] little testimony. I'm done. And uh I
[2:00:35] didn't even have time to go over but
[2:00:37] like I want to share this testimony with
[2:00:39] you.
[2:00:44] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; You are an eternal dimension.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; There was a time in this was uh this was
[2:00:52] this took place in let me see if I can
[2:00:54] remember the date. I think I have the
[2:00:55] date somewhere.
[2:00:57] It was
[2:01:02] one moment.
[2:01:06] I know it was 2023.
[2:01:09] I think April the somewhere in April.
[2:01:13] Let me see.
[2:01:16] Praise be to the Lord. Anyway, the date
[2:01:18] doesn't matter, but it was in 2023. I
[2:01:20] think it was in April. April 2023, if I
[2:01:24] quite remember. When I get off work, I
[2:01:27] put my key and my wallet. This a drawer.
[2:01:31] The first is three compartment, three
[2:01:33] cabinet. I put my key and uh my key and
[2:01:36] a wallet in the first drawer. And one of
[2:01:39] the days I was looking for my wallet.
[2:01:41] The wallet wasn't there. And I always
[2:01:43] when from work I just put it right there
[2:01:45] and that's where I keep it in the
[2:01:47] morning when I'm going to work I pick it
[2:01:48] up. It wasn't there. So I was like it
[2:01:50] looks like maybe I left it at work. I
[2:01:51] went back to the work set through my
[2:01:53] drawers it wasn't there. I said okay
[2:01:55] maybe it might be home. I came back home
[2:01:58] did I went home did thorough search
[2:02:00] everywhere I couldn't find it. And so I
[2:02:02] was like my ID is in the wallet my bank
[2:02:05] cards in the wallet. Musicians you can
[2:02:07] make your way here and all the stuff is
[2:02:09] in the wallet. So what do I do? I have
[2:02:12] to maybe call the bank, right, to cancel
[2:02:14] my card, call the police to report my ID
[2:02:17] and what else? And all the document that
[2:02:19] I have, it's in the wallet. So I said,
[2:02:22] "No,
[2:02:24] Elisha is my father supernaturally.
[2:02:27] I'm the son of Elisha. Lord, this is
[2:02:29] where I put the first drawer is where I
[2:02:31] put my wallet. However, I don't know
[2:02:33] what happened, whether I misplace it,
[2:02:36] whether somebody stole it. I want to be
[2:02:38] returned exactly where I keep it." Amen.
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; So I prayed and left it to the Lord and
[2:02:44] I was going to work back and forth. Hey,
[2:02:46] my gas was running out. I didn't have
[2:02:49] money to buy gas and couple of days keep
[2:02:52] searching. It still wasn't there. I
[2:02:54] pulled the drawer back and forth. Of
[2:02:56] course, it wasn't there. It was just
[2:02:57] transparent drawer. And one of the night
[2:03:00] my was getting lower and lower. My thank
[2:03:03] god my work was quite kind of close to
[2:03:04] where I live. And I said, I'm still not
[2:03:07] going to call the police. I'm not going
[2:03:08] to report. I'm not going to call the
[2:03:09] bank. I want to be placed where I keep
[2:03:12] it.
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; So one night I was sleeping. I got up
[2:03:15] like probably around midnight 2 or 2:00
[2:03:17] a.m. I couldn't sleep anymore. I was
[2:03:19] thinking about it and I knelt out to
[2:03:21] pray and the inner man said go back to
[2:03:24] the drawer.
[2:03:26] My brother, my sister, I went back to
[2:03:27] the drawer. This same drawer that I've
[2:03:28] been it's not anything mysterious. I
[2:03:30] pull it and the wallet was right there.
[2:03:33] Say glory hallelujah.
[2:03:41] We have a being that works for you. You
[2:03:44] are not alone. You are not by yourself.
[2:03:46] That's right.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; There's a being in you. And if we can
[2:03:49] let him, we drink more and we can let
[2:03:51] this be manifest himself. You are prince
[2:03:54] uh God on this earth.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; I will give another short testimony. I'm
[2:03:58] done.
[2:04:00] This seals book is my first book that I
[2:04:03] my brother who was a minister gave it to
[2:04:05] me when I came to the message and I love
[2:04:07] it. I've used it is the the pages are
[2:04:09] turn off. I've got it highlighted. I've
[2:04:11] got it uh written. I have different
[2:04:14] things. I remember one time brother Jose
[2:04:16] remember I went to a hosted about a year
[2:04:18] and a half ago. Brother Jose Abi Linda I
[2:04:21] think you were there right? And brother
[2:04:23] somebody called me. I keep receiving
[2:04:24] this call but you know we do get scam
[2:04:26] calls. So I I wasn't paying attention. I
[2:04:28] came back home and I saw the brother
[2:04:30] wrote his brother do you remember me?
[2:04:32] You preach years ago in a basement
[2:04:34] church and he said that the there are
[2:04:37] there is blue grasses in heaven and I'm
[2:04:40] looking for that quote. Is it in church
[2:04:41] book? I said, "Oh no, it's in seals
[2:04:44] book." So I just open it. It's right
[2:04:46] here. Blue grasses in heaven in my book.
[2:04:49] I don't know the pages but it's in a
[2:04:51] revelation of the seven seals. That is
[2:04:53] the let me see paragraph
[2:04:56] 358. That's my paragraph. I don't know
[2:04:58] if it's the same. He said, "Sir, I turn
[2:05:00] and it looked like a great That was
[2:05:01] Abraham." He said, "So I turn and it
[2:05:03] looked like a great big great big field,
[2:05:06] something like a green spreading field
[2:05:07] of blue grass." When the Lord show him
[2:05:10] one vision, he could see he was sleeping
[2:05:12] in his bedroom with his wife and he
[2:05:14] said, "I could see my body laying down
[2:05:16] with my wife." Mid was fast asleep and I
[2:05:18] could see me being a young person and
[2:05:20] walking on blue grasses. Has anyone ever
[2:05:22] seen blue grasses on this earth before?
[2:05:24] like call it blue, blue as in blue. I
[2:05:27] did a search and I had a there's no like
[2:05:30] blue grasses but in Kentucky they have
[2:05:32] they call it Kentucky blue grass in let
[2:05:35] me see when it was a spring it's kind of
[2:05:38] have a tint you know kind of tint bluish
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; but blue as in blue they don't have wow
[2:05:44] that's wonderful that's where was born
[2:05:46] that's the only place that we could get
[2:05:48] something close to bluish grass
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; and but then on the other side he was
[2:05:53] walking on blue grasses so one day I
[2:05:55] remember in Texas that was I think 20 23
[2:05:58] as well. I was not in the night the
[2:06:01] daytime I think I don't know what I ate
[2:06:02] maybe some fufu or something like that
[2:06:04] and I knocked myself to sleep. I was
[2:06:06] sleeping on it. I didn't sleep on my
[2:06:07] bed. I had a blue mattress just just
[2:06:09] taking a rest taking a nap after taking
[2:06:11] some heavy meal. So I was gone and slept
[2:06:14] and as I was sleeping something hit my
[2:06:16] I'm left-handed dominant. I use my left
[2:06:18] hand. I can barely write my name with my
[2:06:20] right hand. I use the left hand for
[2:06:22] everything you know. and something hit
[2:06:25] my hand and I opened my my eyes and this
[2:06:28] s book was firmly in my hand and I was
[2:06:31] looking around there was nobody around.
[2:06:34] I said, "Lord, do you want me to read a
[2:06:35] book?" I started reading and praying. We
[2:06:38] have a dimension
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; that's in us.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; When you can't take care of yourself, it
[2:06:43] will take care of you.
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; One day I was uh I think after lunch
[2:06:46] right here in West Palm, I ate at
[2:06:48] dinner. I was sitting I have a glass
[2:06:49] table, dining table and I was I think I
[2:06:51] fell asleep without even knowing and I
[2:06:53] had my patio or balcony opener and I was
[2:06:56] gone. I was sleeping on the table and
[2:06:58] probably people were driving by and
[2:07:01] somebody tapped me. I think I was facing
[2:07:03] this way on this right shoulder and I
[2:07:05] got up and I said, "Oh, wow. It's
[2:07:07] already night and I have my party open.
[2:07:10] When I couldn't take take care of
[2:07:11] myself, I sleep."
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; The five senses of the body couldn't
[2:07:15] take care of himself. The five senses of
[2:07:17] human spirit. The theophony tapped me to
[2:07:20] get up and go sleep in the bedroom. My
[2:07:22] brother, what is your need? My sister,
[2:07:23] what is your need?

[2:07:37] little sisters

[2:07:40] specific assignment and he's trying to
[2:07:42] achieve that assignment. And what you
[2:07:44] have to do is give all of your heart to
[2:07:46] him.

[2:07:50] when you give your heart to him, he ask

[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; And you'll be manifesting things that
[2:07:55] are beyond. There's no time to to talk

[2:07:59] the word for the sake of time. But my

[2:11:06] will be what you call me to be. Oh, I

[2:11:17] And I'll say yes.
[2:11:23] Oh Lord, I agree.
[2:11:27] I desire
[2:11:30] your hey
[2:11:33] passion
[2:11:36] is to be what you've called me to be.

[2:13:39] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:13:45] Uh we certainly appreciate God's word uh
[2:13:48] on today and uh just appreciate brother
[2:13:52] Quu and how the Lord uses him just to
[2:13:55] kind of break some of these things down
[2:13:57] to us. And one thing that I'm I'm taking
[2:14:00] away as just the testimonies he was
[2:14:03] sharing there just how God wants us to
[2:14:05] experience that supernatural uh in our
[2:14:08] own lives. Uh we are not limited
[2:14:12] uh by what's in this natural realm. We
[2:14:14] have we have so much more at our uh
[2:14:17] disposal if we would just tap into it.
[2:14:19] Like you say, just just take the word
[2:14:21] and keep drinking. Keep drinking.
[2:14:23] Eventually, these things just push right
[2:14:24] out of you. And uh you know, one thing
[2:14:27] I'm taking away is I am not going to
[2:14:30] trigger stress hormones.
[2:14:36] &gt;&gt; I'm not triggering stress hormones. That
[2:14:38] mean I'm not going to be worried and up
[2:14:40] at night and worried about No. God going
[2:14:42] to make a way if God could bring his
[2:14:44] wallet back,
[2:14:47] right? I mean, what else can God do for
[2:14:49] you if you would just only believe? And
[2:14:51] and the thing about God is that he don't
[2:14:54] he don't move in microwave time. But if
[2:14:56] you just hold on to what you what you're
[2:14:59] holding on to, God going to make a way
[2:15:00] somehow. So, I'm telling you, I ain't
[2:15:02] going to trigger no stress hormones. I'm
[2:15:04] I'm I'm I'm going to I'm going to live
[2:15:06] in God's uh freedom, you know, that he
[2:15:08] has for me. So we appreciate the word of
[2:15:10] the Lord on today. Amen. We thank God
[2:15:12] for brother quake group.
[2:15:14] Praise God. As I was there in Ghana, you
[2:15:17] know, um um for Christmas, I found out
[2:15:23] uh so they you get you get a name for
[2:15:27] the day that you're born. So, Brother
[2:15:29] Quu being born on Wednesday, that's how
[2:15:32] he got the Quu name. And uh I come to
[2:15:35] find out I was also born on a Wednesday.
[2:15:37] So guess what? I'm brother Quu.
[2:15:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; God is good.
[2:15:47] Amen. Let us have a word of prayer.
[2:15:49] Amen. Father, we thank you for your word
[2:15:51] that has gone forth uh on this day. I
[2:15:55] thank you for your servant, Lord, just
[2:15:57] getting himself out of the way to bring
[2:15:58] these thoughts from heaven uh to us, to
[2:16:00] help us, Lord, to think at a higher
[2:16:02] level. Uh to respond at a higher level,
[2:16:06] God, to walk at a higher level. Uh we we
[2:16:09] thank you for uh Lord, just um just
[2:16:12] helping us to see, Lord, just what it is
[2:16:14] that you want us to be. We don't have to
[2:16:17] be limited, Father, by these five
[2:16:19] senses, Lord. We can go to that six
[2:16:21] sense of faith and operate there all the
[2:16:23] time. the prophet has laid these things
[2:16:25] out. And Lord, just as brother Quaker
[2:16:27] was just kind of sharing um just
[2:16:30] different things that happened in
[2:16:32] Brother Brandon's ministry, how the
[2:16:33] angel Lord would say, "Hey, you're going
[2:16:35] to go to such and such a meeting. This
[2:16:37] person's going to be there and dressed
[2:16:38] like this and they're going to be
[2:16:40] sitting over here and they're going to
[2:16:41] be doing this." Lord, it just show how
[2:16:43] you you know everything about us before
[2:16:46] we even know about it. Uh we don't even
[2:16:49] know, Lord. Sometime we're wondering
[2:16:51] what we're going to put on and going
[2:16:52] through the closet and I'm not sure. Try
[2:16:54] to wear this and I can't put that on and
[2:16:56] I got to wear something else. But you
[2:16:58] already know before the foundation
[2:17:00] world, Lord, every detail about us,
[2:17:03] Lord, if if you have those things under
[2:17:05] control, help us, Father, to realize
[2:17:07] that we don't have anything to worry
[2:17:09] about. We don't have to trigger stress
[2:17:10] hormones because, Lord, you're you're
[2:17:13] you're in perfect control of every
[2:17:14] situation. Let us keep walking by faith
[2:17:16] and not by sight, knowing, oh God, that
[2:17:19] you will turn everything into our favor.
[2:17:20] I pray your blessings upon your people
[2:17:22] as they leave this place, but not your
[2:17:24] presence. May you bring us back at the
[2:17:26] appointed time on Wednesday night. Uh
[2:17:28] it's our prayer. It's in Jesus' name we
[2:17:31] pray. Amen. Amen. Let's give the Lord a
[2:17:34] hand of praise.
[2:17:39] Amen. And again, we want to thank God
[2:17:42] for Brother Wy and sister Aliana. God
[2:17:44] bless you all. Amen. Please come see us
[2:17:47] again. Amen. Brothers will come at this
[2:17:50] time to dismiss you. You can be seated.
[2:17:52] Amen. The brothers will come to dismiss
[2:17:54] you. God bless you.
