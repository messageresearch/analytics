so we just want to continue to keep the family uh in our prayers amen the lord be with him i also wanted to just make mention that um sister eric and i just want to express our gratitude and our thanks to everyone again for the love offerings and the beautiful cards a man a lot of times uh i'm just a person that i like to read in the cards i think i get that from my mama a man i i learned a long time ago with my mama you didn't have to buy her she wanted to give she want the gift and i don't i don't want to say that that you don't have to buy a gift you you really need to buy that gift but there there must be there must be a car to go with that gift and uh and mama just like reading her car she hold on to him and i got a big old bag in my closet just full of cards amen and sometimes you never know you might go through you might see something that encourages you all right so so many of the things that were written and what we read every last message and uh and we just want to say thank you so much it really meant a lot to both of us that you all would just show your love to us in that way and amen the lord richly bless you and return back to your hundredfold amen as you gave to be a blessing to us amen for ministry appreciation thank you so much thank you so much uh for that praise the lord uh i'ma i'm gonna release the musicians because you're playing another one that i like and uh before you know it it's gonna turn into a concert amen god bless you god bless you musicians thank you all so much we really really appreciate y'all amen so if you would stand with me we will read a scripture on today and uh for the past couple weeks i have been blessed by uh brother troy speaking on last week amen what is truth and just a wonderful wonderful thought that i believe the lord gave him a man to be a blessing to us and and um and then brother smiley just a couple weeks ago is he was just kind of talking about the generation of the upright you know and and uh and i i just want to be a part of that generation i'm standing standing upright you know before the lord's presence uh but i appreciate appreciated that and amen and and i um just been sitting back and just waiting on the lord and i felt like the lord just gave me a little little thought here today and i kind of go a little different it'd be more along the lines of faith but i think we can never have enough of that uh with the things that we face on a day-to-day basis our faith got to be ignited got to be charged all the time amen it's like when your cell phone dying you got to put it on a charge sometimes you come to the house of god to get a charge right amen we need that as we're as we're facing different things and uh they they uh i heard them pray for brother travis and i'm i'm grateful for that i've been he's been calling me and we've been talking and um i've been giving him some scriptures to read and he's been going through the book of psalms and then through the book of um uh uh proverbs yeah uh proverbs he was going through proverbs and then i told him about first samuel ii samuel he started going through that and as we got to talk and he started making connections from samuel to david and psalms i said yes that's exactly right that's the way it's supposed to be right there you know some of the things that david was going through in the book of samuel wrote the songs right so uh so you know we were just really fellowshipping around that and i was i was just just really blessed and i told them now god is represented in numbers i said some sometimes you got to find the numbers where god is i say what what day you go to court you say the eighth and i said he told me he's been a hell seven months seven eight eleven you know there's numbers here that that god can work with so i say i just trust the lord to give you favor amen on that so uh sometimes you got to give people hope you got to give them faith something to hold on to amen amen all right let's read here out of mark 11. very familiar uh passage amen here mark 11 verse 22 is where i want to start from amen um actually you know what let's let's go back to verse 20. let's start at verse 20. and it says and in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots and peter called into remembrance saith unto him master behold the fig tree which thy curse is withered away now you got to understand when jesus spoke this to the fig tree he was not speaking out loud it was a very uh just you know curse curse no many uh fruit from the from here here i mean from here after just very soft words nothing nothing major but the bible say that the disciples heard it right so so it wasn't that he was trying to say it to get their attention he just said it but the disciples heard it so now this next day one day later uh peter noticed that the fig tree that he cursed is dried up it's withered away what i'm trying to tell you is that the situation changed in less than 24 hours all right it changed just like that and peter noticed it amen amen i'm praying that some of our situations will change in less than 24 hours hallelujah and verse 22 says in jesus answering death unto him have faith in god that whosoever shall sin to this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast him to the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith now now now the key to this is that you have to be the one to speak it because you're going to have whatever you say if you speak negative you receive negative you speak positive you receive positive it's based on what you say so therefore i say unto you what what things server you desire when you pray believe that you receive them and ye shall have them and when you stand pray and forgive if you have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses hallelujah that's why some of us have not received our blessing yet we're still holding out against somebody amen says but if you do if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses the lord had a blessing to the reading of his word let's pray father we thank you for the ability to read scripture but it takes the holy ghost to anoint it uh for the season and time in which we're in thank you father for what you have done already in the service we've felt your mighty presence but as we come to this uh critical moment where the word of god must go forth we pray that you bring strength and encouragement uh to each one uplift every heart uh correct where we need correction uh encourage where we need encouragement lord heal if somebody needs healing deliver somebody needs deliverance whatever the need is move by your spirit in this place we ask that you be glorified and magnified here today lord we uh exalt you we praise you we thank you it's in jesus name we pray amen and amen god bless you can be seated amen we want to just take for a topic today uh somewhere between here and there amen somewhere between here and there amen uh uh just follow me here this morning i was uh i guess reading uh a little little quote or something like that that somebody put on um in one of the the whatsapp groups that i was in and as i was reading and i was just so inspired so encouraged by you know some of the words that that was spoken and i pray today amen that we'll just be able to kind of bring some of the inspiration encouragement to you as well amen uh coming out of the the sermon perfect faith is where i want to start a man this first quote coming out of perfect faith and and when i when i was looking at some of these quotes out of perfect faith that was shared i said well what scripture did brother branham use when he preached perfect faith i said what what i had to go back and find and and there he was reading out of mark 11 amen uh 22 through 26 that was his that was what he was reading and uh i say well my you know for him to take a a a message like perfect faith and tie it down in that scripture say there's got to be something there for us and uh so i just want to just maybe coast a little bit and just hope this will be a blessing but coming out of this sermon perfect faith this first quote says notice now another perfect faith is a master of all circumstances i i need to ask you a question do you have a circumstance this morning do you have something that you're facing this morning where you need to know your faith and perfect faith masters that circumstance right perfect faith is a master of all circumstance perfect faith masters all circumstances no matter what it is amen it masters it now just watch when you believe anything do anything and you got faith in what you're doing no matter what the circumstance is that don't have one thing to do oh love rules like this the devil don't have a chance when we get a revelation amen that our faith can master whatever whatever we're facing and man it says uh don't have one thing to do with it see it masters that circumstance it is um it says if it's in a room of sickness the lord revealed that there's certain things going to happen you just speak it and go now now that that's that's that's a good lesson to learn sometimes when you speak it it don't change immediately and since it doesn't change immediately our faith begins to dwindle hallelujah but here the prophet tells us speak it and then go on you know when god said let there be light in the beginning brother branham said it could have took millions of years before a light came but when god spoke it he went on and start working on the next thing hallelujah amen and here's what i want to encourage you speak it out of your mouth and start working on the next thing glory to god amen that same god that spoke this world into existence he dwells inside of you amen you just speak it and go on oh just don't ask any questions it's already over oh i love this it's already over just keep going see it masters all circumstances well if you do this so-and-so's gonna do see you see it's already got it massac faith believes that god will work it out i don't know how he's going to do it but he'll do it anyhow see it masters all circumstances all right i say amen to that myself my faith is what's gonna master this thing all right let me go on to another little statement here in the message uh why christ speak amen glory glory glory somewhere between here and there somewhere between here and there see i mean you got yo your faith is actually saying that right i mean this is wherever you're standing at and whatever your circumstances you're standing in a particular position but your expectation is over there it's going to change right and somewhere between here and there there has to be a change and your faith is what's going to produce that change hallelujah church amen if you're sick in your body amen the doctors have given up on you and then somewhere between here and there you're healing something has got to take place glory to god if you're behind on the bill and you need god to pay something for you amen maybe they threatened you like they threatened me to come take my house but somewhere between here and there god had to move amen because god promised me that he was going to rebuke to devourer for my sake and all i got to do is hold god's word up to him and watch god move somewhere between here and there i know god is going to move for me oh hallelujah glory to god amen amen amen amen maybe a child is wayward this morning but you gotta you gotta grab a hold of a promise somewhere between here where i'm standing at right now i might not be sitting with them and seeing them in church but somewhere between here and there my child has got to come in hallelujah faith masters the circumstance glory to god amen let's look at what the prophet says here and why christ speak it says for you see faith sees what god wants done oh i hope this goes in he says our faith doesn't look at the present time see that's why you can sing the song god in my present god in my future you write my story you hold it all together right faith doesn't look at the present time faith doesn't see this here not even looking at it not even considering it amen it says uh it says uh our faith looks to see what god wants and it works accordingly that's what faith does it sees what god wants and what god wants done and faith operates through that faith glory to god is a long-range vision i love this look at this it don't lower its sights y'all believing god for a house is here don't lower your sights you believe in god for a job don't lower your sights praise god if you believe in god for a car don't you lower your sights faith does not lower its sights come on church amen look it says it don't lower sights it holds to the target amen any good shooter knows that see that's a long range it's a telescope it's a binocular that you don't look around here you don't use binoculars to look to see what time it uh what time it is you pull out binoculars looking at you watch something wrong with you right hey man you have to pull bananas out to see something far off maybe you sitting up in the nosebleed section and you want to see what's really happening on the field in the corner play you got to pull the binoculars out to bring it closer to you now you know you're there in the place you know the game is happening amen but you really can't see but pull those binoculars out and begin to i focus them a little bit amen your binoculars is the old testament in the new testament find yourself a in god's word and focus on that promise and no matter what happens don't you lower your sights glory to god amen he said she says uh it's a binocular that you don't look around here you don't use binoculars to look and see what time it is see you don't use that but you use binoculars to look way off and faith does that faith picks up god's binoculars both of them both sides the new and old testament and sees every promise that he made and faith sees it out yonder and faith chooses that regardless of what the present tense says here he looks at the end he don't drop his sights down to look this away he looks out yonder he keeps the crossbar there centered on the word that's what faith does that's the faith that's in a man that does those things all right amen i got my faith anchored i got it set i got it focused and i'm expecting god to do what god said he gonna do now uh this uh next quote that i want to use out of be not afraid is a testimony and this is kind of where i got my my my thought from as uh this was being shared and uh you know let me just just just read it here brother branham was talking about he was when i was leaving south africa recently there was about 10 000 at the airport and they was out there standing out there weeping and crying wailing screaming come back and tell us again about jesus you see so many great things and a little doctor that had seen a miracle perform a little cross-out boy started on the platform just to cross side as he could be and before he got to me his eyes come straight now now um there was a you know the the testimony about brother branham's uh daughter's first daughter that passed away she died cross-eyed she died cross-eyed and uh and when brother branham saw his daughter in that condition it just really did something to him that you know anytime he saw a child or any any person with cross eyes uh sometimes he didn't even have to pray sometimes all he had to do is just look at him and the eyes would come straight he had a compassion for people that had these cross eyes hallelujah amen now here this boy amen there in africa uh with the cross eyes and he says uh before he even got to me his eyes come straight says go on just just took him on off the platform and a british doctor come back set him back there and he comes saying what did you do to this boy what did you do to that boy did you hypnotize him says i said hypnotize them i said and they give you a license to practice medicine you know more you know you know more about hypnotism than that and he said i put the boy on the platform he was cross-eyed and here he is his eyes are straight and said something happened between there and he there and there something happened hallelujah amen amen i want you to get this if something happened for that boy between here and there something's about to happen for you between here and there [Applause] oh glory to god he says that something happened between there and there i said he met jesus see i said he i and i said i never touched him and he said did you hypnotize him i said certainly not sir i said if hypnotism will straighten cricket eyes haven't you fellas better get to practicing hypnotism you see i in a better it'd be better uh than any operation you could do if hypnotism will do it i said no i did not hypnotize the boy god straighten his eyes he says i know there's a god he said i know that's what god said there that lily there's literally uh lily's their sisters uh if you might know some of them with them big cala lilies are 18 inches across big yellow and white ones and most beautiful thing growing wild right in the jungle they had big bouquets of them setting all over the platform said i know there's god's life in them lilies because the lily couldn't live without life he said but tangible enough to perform an operation on those eyes i said who made the eyes in the first place where did they come from and he said well yeah and just then dr bosworth come and said you have to leave us sir you you call's a riot see he said his time is valuable now while the nautilus on our brother usually coming to the meets to make it better effective mr back to mr baldwin them the managers they do the speaking i just come right straight to the platform call the prayer line and then after it's over leave but now of course i'm just alone there with just the boys and so i have to try to stumble around over uh speaking myself so when the doctor he started to take him away and he said he said just a moment it said mr branham do you mean to tell me that god the great creator is somewhere between here and there oh you could be this close to death but somewhere between here and there god will step in i said almighty god will step in i don't care how close you are to being defeated god will not allow you to be defeated they could have threatened all kind of things i'm going to take this and i'm going to take that don't matter what they say god is in between here and there and he can step in and change everything around just like that look at this this man asks a question the doctor says you mean to tell me that god the great creator is somewhere between here and there brother brandon said he's everywhere and he said well there's got to be some tangible force to straighten that boy's eyes i said that it was god and they started to take him off then mr baxter walked up to him he said just a minute he got up to the micro and said i i too will receive jesus christ as my personal savior once he saw god manifest himself between here and there it changed his heart and he stopped he stopped approaching god with the intellectual conception amen some reality struck when this man experienced god in that place of hearing there i want to just kind of uh uh give you a couple of scriptures here this is not just something that was just you know uh in brother branham's ministry but i got i kind of you know as i looked at the quote i said man we're going to be able to find this all over the scripture you know and and there's things that happen god begin to step in you can be in a situation over here but you know you're on your way there and before you get there before you get to the place called there you need to see the supernatural you need to experience god in a way that you never experienced and i am here to tell you if you just take a step of faith you will find god right in between the spot of here and there here we find it in in the book of uh luke amen uh chapter 17. let's look at this amen verse 11 luke luke 17 and verse 11 hey we gonna find them between here and there glory glory glory glory amen my here uh we find this in the bible luke 17. i got the wrong verse okay all right luke 17 verse 11 says and it came to pass as he went to jerusalem that he passed through the midst of samaria and galilee and as he entered into a certain village there met him ten men that were lepers amen which stood afar off hallelujah glory to god it says uh and they lifted up their voices and said jesus master have mercy on us and when he saw them and i noticed that they standing way back because you know as leopards they were kicked outside the city they couldn't come in contact with anybody but it just so happened jesus was passing their way and they recognized who was coming the the very man that could change their situation was coming down amen right down their street amen and there he was standing there saying oh jesus have mercy master have mercy on us and when he saw them he said unto them go show yourselves uh unto the priests and it came to pass that as they went i like that oh glory as they went they were cleansed amen so here they were standing here with leprosy but as they were on the way to there [Music] there was to go show yourself to the priests and all they had to do was be obedient here and as they begin to walk to there to get to the priests the bible says that all of them recognize that they have been healed by the word of god because they were obedient amen and i want to encourage you in between here and there be obedient to god and watch what god does watch the supernatural happen amen watch your sickness disappear if you just be obedient between here and there hallelujah glory glory glory now there's something that should happen once you recognize the supernatural once you recognize it has occurred to you once you know god has done something for you there should be something happen there is a amen uh uh thanks hey man that's in store and some of us amen we already know god has already done it so we can start giving god thanks now [Applause] man i ain't gotta wait till the battle is over my mama used to sing it out shout now [Music] [Applause] gloria shout while i'm in the battle i shout after the battle praise god i ain't gonna let the devil take my shot hallelujah [Applause] oh jesus there is a fainting order once god does something for you and look at let's just keep on reading here amen in verse 14 and when they saw it saw when he saw them he said unto them go show yourselves unto the priests and it came to pass that as they went they were cleansed and one of them when he saw that he was healed turned back man this man didn't come to church this man then come to church amen with nothing to say notice what the bible say when he came to church the bible says with a loud voice hey when god has done something for you that's the least you can give him is your loud voice glory to god you know it's a loud voice that gets his attention because amen as he was on his way to the cross amen blind bartimaeus did not realize this would be the last trip and he could not see with his eyes glory to god but he heard that jesus was passing by and he began to screen out jesus have mercy on me and somebody say he can't hear you bartimaeus you might as well be quiet he can't hear you he's not gonna stop he can't see and you can't see him but jesus thou son of david have mercy on me and the more they discourage bartimaeus the louder he got to finally say jesus jesus jesus had mercy on me and that loud voice called jesus caused attention to stop in his tracks one more miracle one more miracle one more miracle before our town across what would you have blind bottom is lord i want to receive my sight [Applause] and somewhere between here and there may have received his sight [Music] and somewhere between them [Applause] cool [Applause] [Music] [Applause] glory hallelujah [Applause] [Music] when you recognize that he's done something for you it should produce a thanks it should produce a thanksgiving [Applause] and when you come to god with your thanksgiving come with a loud voice [Music] hallelujah amen i can see this man just disrupt the service maybe jesus was teaching and thanking jesus and people don't want to know what this man thinking him about he just entered the city he just got here what is this man thinking him about thank you jesus [Applause] let's just interrupt the service but i'm going to chase you when you got something to praise god for [Music] people people don't understand what you've been through look you weren't blind i mean you didn't have a lot of person like i had leprosy you weren't cast out away from your family the way i was cast out from my family [Applause] jesus i just come to let you know i never made it to the priest [Music] i know you told me to go to the police but in all actuality i am coming to the peace [Applause] the high peace look at it look at it look at it look at it he says and and one of them when he saw that he was healed turned back and with a loud voice glorified god and fell down on his face at his feet giving him thanks and he was a samaritan and jesus answering said where were there not 10 cleanse now now here it is they all got a miracle and jesus knew that every one of them was going to get the miracle he said just go show yourself to the priest never lay hands on them never never never even spoke a word just go show yourself to the priests and as they obeyed here and was going there they every last one of them experienced a miracle but only one could return and offer thanks look at this look at this look at this jesus said were there not ten cleanse but where are the nine they are not found that return to give glory to god save this stranger and it says and he said unto him arise go thy way thy faith have made thee whole oh hallelujah hallelujah stranger heard the commandment of the lord jesus was obedient to it and received his miracle we've got to learn to be obedient what god tell us amen that's how we see miracles this was not the only time this happened like i said we're going to walk through the scripture i re reminded a man of the story of these people gathering at the pool of bethesda and the bible the bible would tell us amen that when they would come to this pool they sat there because the scriptures say at a certain season and so that's the thing you you know when i come in here this morning and uh just first to start starting with the prayer and i just kind of feel the anointing in here just just the way things was going i mean god is moving in this place you know and then uh then you know at the uh uh uh as was just going through the song service and amen and just listening at the different songs out of saints was entering i say oh we gonna have church in here today and we're gonna have church today i know god is here right you know and so sometimes when you when you feel services like that that's the angel of the lord that's troubling the water amen and so so here the story in the scripture tells us that you know at a certain season the angel would come down and begin to stir up the water and and and and the way it went is that the first person that jumped into the water while the angel was there that's the person that received their healing now no matter what their condition was no matter what their circumstance was all they needed to do was just get in the water that's all they had to do just get in and the first person got it walked away here did not have to lay in the water anymore well this one day jesus comes and it begins to have a conversation with this man amen that's laying on a cot and he walked by all the other uh sick people and you think you think that he'd be a compassionate god that he'd go to all them no he only go to those that are predestinated for him to go to amen hallelujah so so so here we are uh he walks down to this man and says uh will that be made whole and he's asking me a question now uh i was just kind of uh uh thinking about this this man never stepped into the water this man amen never all he did was just begin to give jesus some some uh some some excuses as to why he couldn't be made whole god don't want to hear your excuses i got one question sir will thou be made whole now see his favors that when this water stirred then if i can get in the water i'll be made whole no he don't realize that the angel that came to trouble the water was standing in a person in the person of the lord jesus and he actually say will you be made whole and as he's asking the question he said no no no i don't even want to hear it i'm not going to sit here and debate with you about all your excuses he said take up your your match pick up your mat and just go on and as he told the man the man man got some strength in his balls picked up his mouth and he went out never stepped in the water to the gods but somewhere between where he was standing and where the troubled water was somewhere between here and there jesus was standing the supernatural was standing and all he had to do was be obedient to the supernatural and he'll receive his healing i'm telling you god can get right in between the little itty bitty space actually he'll make space for himself he'll get right in between a little itty bitty space to make a difference in your life that man received this healing somewhere between here and there oh hallelujah hallelujah can i just read another one here let's go to luke 7. oh thank you jesus now uh start at verse 11. jesus has a way of just getting in between here and there this was a very very bad situation that we're getting ready to read this was a mother that already lost her husband and now she's lost her only son to death she's standing by herself but it just so happened the bible tells us and it came to pass the day after that he went into a city called name and many of his disciples went with him and much people now when he came nigh to the gate of the city behold there was a dead man carried out now i tell you she had a funeral at the right time there was a dead man carried out the only son of his mother and she was a widow and much people of the city was with her my god so we got these two crowds meeting amen some that's following jesus and someone that's following her just comforting her because they realize what she's gone through glory to god and when the lord saw her he had compassion on her and said unto her weep not now wait a minute wait a minute now it's a proper time to cry when you don't lost a loved one it is a proper time to cry but see listen you gotta you gotta you gotta understand you got to learn to be obedient when you stand in here because what's really in your heart is to be over there and you got to learn to be obedient now hear this lady probably bawling with tears and she hear the words of jesus stop crying weep not my can you imagine you got pretty much what he said get control of yourself get yourself together hallelujah hey man when you crying and all uncontrolled out of control anything can happen amen your mind just start going everywhere when you crying like that it's okay to cry but at some point in time get yourself together hey man get your head set right glory to god you get you start thinking differently when when you when you when you when your emotions are under control hallelujah somebody so jesus say weep not and he came and touched the buyer this was the casket that the man was landing all jesus did was just touch it he never said a prayer all he did was just touch the buyer look at this now it says and uh the bible says uh and he touched the buyer by the buyer and they that bear him stood still that mean they stopped walking jesus is here now glory to god i i mean what can you imagine they just kept walking with them we don't care what this we're gonna go bury this stop man everything you're doing stop stop crying stop walking stop whining stop stop stop [Applause] [Music] [Applause] just stop god can't do nothing until you stop the bible say peace t [Applause] [Music] be still and know that i am god you keep trying to fix it yourself that's why you ain't got no be still and know that i'm gone [Applause] stop crying stop whining stop running here and there stop calling everybody on the phone stop walking stop stop stop please god stop [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh [Applause] and he came and touched the buyer and they that bare him stood still and he said young man i say unto these he is based on what you say out of your mouth young man this man is a dead man this man is in the casket going to be buried young man oh hallel now notice now notice notice even even even in this you know because we know that when he went to raise lazarus from the grave brother branham said if he not if he wouldn't have called lazarus by name says everything and the grave would have come out so he was being very specific to this young man young men and we got some young men in bondage this morning we have some young men and buyers this morning praise god but jesus speaks young man praise god i say unto thee [Applause] and he that was dead set up [Music] [Applause] he sat up and began to speak and he delivered him to his mother see somewhere between here and there i mean this man was on his way to graveyard here was a funeral service there was a graveyard we can't leave you at the church my brother we can't leave you here we're gonna have to take you to the graveyard but somewhere between here and there it just so happened that jesus came to town that morning it happened in walking by this feudal procession and as he walked by he just laid hands on the bus say young man i say arise and he stood up he set up and he began to speak that's time for you to sit up speak [Music] [Applause] but i read verse 11 verse 11 says and it came to pass the day after means something happened the day before now i'm not going to take time to read it but i'll just give you a synopsis on the day before there was this ruler his name is centurion and the centurion he knew he had confidence in jesus he was not one of the jews so he couldn't he didn't feel like he had the right to approach jesus the way the jews could so he says if y'all don't mind he has some jewish servants said y'all don't mind i got a servant that i really love oh hallelujah says i really love him and i want to see him get well amen i don't want to see him die in the condition that he's dying in he says but i want to just see him get well and he says if you don't mind would you go to jesus on my behalf and would you ask him to come here to the house and pray for this this this uh this uh that this servant of mine they say yeah say we'll go we'll go quickly they went to jesus they begin to encourage them you need to come this man built us a temple this man did this this man this is a worthy cause please come at his request jesus said i'll go with you jesus starts moving in their direction and as he's coming amen the centurion recognizes oh my jesus is almost at my house i got this man here sick and i didn't think he would come but he's coming to my house he'd say but i ain't worthy that jesus would come underneath my roof he got up and went out to jesus and he said now lord he said jesus now i'm not worthy that you come under my roof but i will say this i am a man i'm the authority hallelujah and i recognize that you're also a man that has authority he says i tell this one to come and he come i tell this one to go and he'd go whatever i say that's exactly what they do he says and what i recognize is when you tell a devil to leave he leaves whether you present or not present that devil will still leave it says all night that you come underneath my roof but jesus [Music] if you can speak or wrong amen now and then in luke 7 just speak a word now i know speak the word only but this i want you to get he said just speak a word y'all i don't know if we got it yet he said just speak a word you don't have to speak a paragraph you don't have to give me a whole quote you don't have to give me a whole sentence give me one give me one and i know say here god just give me one word it'll change my situation give me one word it'll change my circumstance and my perfect faith is mastering my circumstances [Music] [Applause] he said jesus speak in a word [Applause] because remembers what you say at your mouth if you want your mountain to be moved you can speak in a word and sometimes all you got to say is move mountain [Music] move i don't i don't care where you go just get out my way move [Music] [Applause] hey hallelujah move move move move you know when the family going to the court tomorrow move just move move move now you know what people ain't gonna know what you what you even talking about [Applause] i just need a word i got my word move [Applause] [Music] [Applause] whatever you face if if bad news from the doctor move right need a new car move and that move got so many definitions to it satan move out my way god move on the scene angels i release y'all and move move got so many his hands going devil get back w bound in the name of jesus [Music] oh my oh glory to god amen amen yeah i'm gonna go to verse seven on that map luke 7 7. ain't that a good place to put it wherefore neither thought i myself worthy to come unto thee but say in a word and my servant shall be healed now that's faith that's what we call perfect faith because this man say now all i need you said just one word and going to change and and all i i know my perfect face says somewhere between here and there somebody to change it it's going to change amen hallelujah but this man said just saying a word and that's what we need god just just saying a word god let's keep on reading the rest of it it says uh and uh for i also my man set under authority heaven under me soldiers and i say unto one go and he goeth unto another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he do with it when jesus heard these things he marveled at him can you can you imagine marveling jesus i mean jesus but he had to do that to give like an effect to the to the others that were around say this the kind of faith i'm looking for this is what i'm talking about he said he said he says jesus heard these things and marveled at him and turned him about and said unto the people that follow him i say unto you i have not found so great faith no not in israel and they that were sent returned into the house found the servant whole that had been sick so somewhere between here where jesus was standing and where that sick man was laying somewhere between here and there the supernatural took place glory let me uh look at something here in the message perfect faithless paragraph 218 i want to go to there oh my see this this man uh did not he just didn't feel comfortable having jesus come into his house but the man was his servant was too sick to go get prayer for himself so he had to send somebody on his behalf to just just have jesus saying a word for my servant and that's all you need sometimes sometimes you know a prayer line come stand in the gap for somebody else all you need is just a word to go just a word hey glory here the message says the great physician who is here who said these signs shall follow them that believe if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover and if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but can believe if he can create squirrels who has no way and and and don't doubt and uh and who has no way at all or nothing there to believe it's my own faith that goes and does that my faith and what he challenged me to ask he challenged me to ask it and this brother branham talked about when he was uh the the holy spirit challenged him to ask for squirrels sometimes god he didn't he didn't he didn't he wasn't out there thinking about it but the holy spirit challenged them do you believe the scripture if you say to the mountain beat our moon beat our countenance yeah lord i believe it i believe say do you really believe the scripture so yeah lord i believe it said well he said what you hunting for what you mean when i'm hunting for my humble squirrels you got any no how many you want three they say where they gonna be at see god just kept walking him through the process now you're gonna have to open up your mouth now i can put them there but you say where they gonna be at well i'm gonna say something crazy it's gonna be one right here next thing you know within 30 minutes there was shot it picked it up say man he said i thought i was in a vision but when i picked up the squirrel and realized it was bleeding he says visions don't bleed this was reality you say where the second one gonna be at okay i'm gonna say this he just said it and they shot it there was and he said okay he was he said where the third one gonna be he said i'ma say this it's gonna just something crazy i off the wall he knows squirrels don't do nothing like that but since you're gonna challenge me i'ma challenge you said it and and that he said he said he waited waited waited squirrel didn't show up picked up the first two and he opened his loud voice he had a loud voice he said lord i thank you for these two squirrels god i'm going back he's saying no no no no no no no no you ain't going nowhere how many you told me how many you got will you sit there and wait there's another word there's another word that's another word that's another word that's another word all you need is just one word this word says wait you sit there and wait until i do it and as he sat there just waiting because all of us some of us don't want to wait we want to get in front of god we want to get ahead of actually we want to lead god rather allow god to lead us so god say wait you say move he say wait move wait move he's not saying he's not gonna move he just wants you to wait for him to move did not david have to wait underneath the mulberry tree when you hear the mulberry bushes when you hear the sound in the moment that's when it's time for you to move until then you sit there and wait [Music] you sit there and wait and before you know it here come that third squirrel and this happened in brother branham's ministry two times over the same scripture if we say to the mountain be thou removed be thou cast and see don't down the heart we can have whatsoever whatever we say let's keep reading let's keep reading if he can create squirrels was who has no way at all or nothing there to believe it's my own faith that that that goes and does that my faith in what he challenged me to ask he challenged me to ask it and i i received his challenge in obedience to his word i asked it and it appeared god in heaven knows that that's true can he also heal the sick if he can lift me with the faith up this way even for the people listen listen to this statement even if they can't climb to that bracket if they can't do it if they can't get there all this preaching they just can't get there look at what they say he can use my faith he can use my faith he can lift me to that place and i'm climbing for you now you know god gives somebody the gift of faith some people have the gift of faith and god will use their faith to get you what you need because your faith won't get there but god will anoint the next person with their faith let me keep reading i'm gonna give you an example of it let me give you an example oh hallelujah he says he says uh if he can lift me with a faith up this way even even for the people if they can can't climb to that bracket if they can't do he can use my faith he can lift me to that place and i'm climbing for you i'm believing for you i'm speaking for you remember he said in another quote he says brother need rain he said say with the adopted sons and daughters of god will have the power to say brother i give you rain see that that's your perfect faith see stop putting people down you just ain't got no faith you just use your faith if they ain't got no faith you show faith for them since you got all the faith see but you you want to put you you god got to know your faith no god anointed your faith so you can believe the impossible for them [Music] oh i i i'm i i i just want to i just want to say we're not we're not up here just preaching for our health you know you don't you don't realize sometimes what it takes to try to get a word from the lord and god know exactly what many of us are facing as we come to church and god got a word just one word can change all god wants to do is be obedient here be obedient right here because you're on your way to there and in between here and there you're gonna meet the supernatural and if you ain't got faith to believe it since god gave me the sermon i got faith to believe that god gonna meet you somewhere between here and there whatever your there is god gonna meet you look at this he says uh he can lift me up to that place and i'm climbing for you i'm believing for you i'm speaking for you i'm your brother standing as your brother an intercessor trying my best to hold you before god and i'm standing here right before the white throne now and staking that pointing my finger to that bloody sacrifice there and speaking through his name that is done it has to happen and it has to happen uh you know it's happened i know it's happened so do you know it's happened and it's so that's right amen you know i was just you know we just we just uh told a story of uh of the centurion that was standing in faith for his servant see his faith was was and jesus i ain't found faith like this amongst nobody he said he said not amongst israel i said but this right here this is what i'm talking about say man go find it the way that you believed it but to say it happened with another man in scripture his son couldn't get to jesus we talked about this a few months ago he couldn't get to jesus and the man it was the second miracle that happened in canaan and the man the man was they said jesus i need you to come to my house you know my my child is dying he said you you just want to see you want uh miracles that's all you want is mirror miracles say look i ain't got time to argue with you about none of that i just know that you can take care of my situation i'm here to ask you to hear my son he says look uh why don't you go home and find the way that you believed it wouldn't it be nice to go home today leave church today wouldn't that be perfect of god that that you go home and find it the way you have believed it like brother trump said that's somewhere between here while you're hearing the word of god and then before you get home god now work something out so the man was obedient he got up and left jesus and started on his way home and as he was on the way home and one of the servants came and said oh you you got to worry about troubling jesus say yes your son be made whole say oh praise god he said no i just need to know something what time what time did he begin to make men's he said about the seven thousand that's exactly the time that jesus spoken somewhere between here and there it was that man standing in faith for his son and his son was made whole or you want to see your children made whole you stand in faith for them oh glory to god glory to god glory to god amen all right uh i want to just uh bring let me read out of this message jairus and i want to just maybe bring a couple more things and i'm going to try to find a closing spot here uh here out of the message gyrus brother ramsay the roman centurion that had a friend that was sick a servant he said i'm not even worthy that you come under my roof just speak the word if i'm a man under authority and i say to this man do this and he doeth it do this man do that and he doeth it see the roman recognized that jesus his word had all the power that was needed for the healing of that person he knew that in him was invested the power of jehovah god and he knew that whatever jesus said that he mastered diseases he mastered the sea he mastered the universe that's what he is tonight the same yesterday today and forever if we could only recognize that his word has supremacy over every demon every power every all everything every sin every sickness every disease every jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever believe what he said so they said i'm a man under thorne and i know that anybody's under me has to obey me my word is law and order he has to do it and he knew that jesus christ had sickness on his feet he had every disease on his feet and how much more after he died for that purpose and purchased it for you and i are we to believe his word amen there you are what jesus says is right you can triumph over every devil every sickness every disease if you'll just claim your god given authority that jesus christ said whatsoever you ask in my name that i'll do amen that's what we need tonight is a group of people to rise this people who call themselves pentecostal can unite their hearts together and one big effort and say jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever his power supreme and what he said in his word he'll back it up amen then you'll see a church rise in the power of the glory of god and move on amen i was thinking you know we we we can look at many of these examples in the scripture and go and even in the message uh i think of the gentleman john ryan that was just claiming his healing he got prayed from the prayer line and blind got prayed for and he says you know uh uh brother random told you know you're gonna be healed brother and he left that uh prayer lines i thank god for my healing came back the next night it says uh i thought you said i was healed but i'm still blind he said i thought you said you believe he said he said this is what you need to do he says just keep confessing your healing if you believe you're he'll just keep confessing he says just go and say thank god i'm healed thank god i'm healed thank god i'm healed so he was selling newspapers and uh he would go out on the street says extra extra read all about it thank god i'm healed extra actually read all about it thank god i'm here he just kept confessing it kept confessing so weeks go by found himself at the barber shop in the barber chair and barbers start talking some doubt you got to watch people that talk down and i'm going to tell you another thing that's how you know god is getting ready to move when you start hearing all these people talking doubt amen that's it brother marcus [Laughter] glory to god that's it brother amen and that's how you respond to the word when god gives you a word you respond back to god so so so he said he said he said he said the the barber said you need to stop you bringing reproach on the cause of christ by saying that you healed and telling everybody here you blind as i don't know what he said man i don't care what you say extra extra read all about it i am healed in jesus name [Applause] man he spoke it for the last time and somewhere between here and there the supernatural met him in a barber chair the supernatural met him that man jumped up took off running out the barber chair and the barber running down the street having to testify with the tools in his hand you don't just criticize now you're running with the tools in your head come back you got hit back you're going to get hit by cars and no you don't understand i can see the car i can see this i can see that i told you i was healed gotta make your enemies testify of his glory he'll make the doubters testify [Music] [Applause] but i was thanking god for that and y'all get ready for this last quote just get ready for it uh as i set this up uh but uh i was thinking about that it's it's good to be able to go through scripture it's good to be able to go through some of the testimonies in brother branham's day but we got our own personal testimony one time we went to a meeting in indiana since italian was here waiting on surgery and she told the doctors now before y'all do any surgery i need to go to the the meeting first i want to go to the service first and i just want to have them pray for me oh hallelujah you say so before so so let's put this off until i get back and then we'll do the surgery when i get back whatever y'all want to do we'll do it when i get back and say she said it's just they say okay we'll wait we'll set up a tuesday we went to the meeting on friday friday service saturday service sunday service sister turner said i came to the meeting to be prayed for before i go back to the doctor so she said brother trump trump says now tonight i want to be prayed for y'all ain't praying for me yet i want to be prayed for tonight before i leave here say okay we're gonna do it right after right after the right of the sermon so so we preached and after sermon brother brother nathan uh went and he called for and he prayed for so as the time went and sat down in a seat gotta close together the next day got on the plane and went on back home getting ready that was a monday we flew back tuesday she was supposed to go and have that procedure hallelujah but somewhere somewhere between here and before it was time for that surgery god had removed it before the doctors could hallelujah so we saw god after prayer faithless prayed the supernatural took place before the doctor's hand could touch her body [Applause] hallelujah and that same god is living today i don't care what you faint saying god is able to move somewhere between here and there i had a rather long quote that i wanted to read and i contemplated i said well do i want to read this uh i think what i'll do is just play it and um this one amen is talking about brother branham receiving that silver tip grizzly somewhere between here and there let's play it right already i'm gonna follow you here he comes and these boys said we'll stay here now until we see you get the caribou and i said then we'll we'll blow him down take the horses and go on in we'll meet you down at the end of the draw about about four or five miles down he said all right so we started around bud night in about a half hour we worked right around and that caribou land right there looking right at us never seen us he must have been asleep and went up over a little cut and come back and come up within 30 yards of him there he laid this mammoth big animal rose up from there and i got him while we're sitting there taking the cape and so forth from it like that bud said did you say these horns was 42 inches i said that's exactly right he said brother brown they must be 142. great big head and i said no it's just exactly 42 said i got a tape measure down there i said you doubt it he said no sir he said but wait a minute didn't you tell me that you were going to get a big grizzly bear before you got back down it'd be a silver tip before you got back where that boy was a green shirt on i said that's the truth you look back down the hill well there is a thing that high nothing always boss all you see miles and miles just rolling hills a mosque he said where's he at brother graham i said he can provide one if he said so i said you doubt that bud he said no sir well coming down there he'll come like this he had packed the rifle a while and i'd packed the head and then vice versa he just had to walk sideways coming down that big horn just raking into the moss and we got within about a mile of it we stopped looking i said that old bear baby showing up at me i said what's this what's he bothered about he said nothing we went on till he hit a little glacier coming across we sat down and got cooled off a little he said brother brown just think of it say we haven't got over about oh less than a half an hour we hit that voice and somewhere between here and there you're going to kill a silver tip i said that's right that's right he said i said you're doubting that bud you raised up took me with a hand he said brother branham my brother has never had a fit from that day to this he said that god that could tell you my brother wouldn't lying to you i said but he'll be there he said where will he come from i said i don't know god said but i'm 52 then and i said i saw vision since a child and when i saw this caribou here killed and you see if his horns isn't 42 inches and then the same vision uh on my road back down to where that company was that i was with i killed this silver tip that grizzly he said brother brown i can see for 20 miles he said god's gonna have to pull him up by the ground or bring him down out of the skies or something i said don't you worry he'll be there we went about another hundred yards he has just about wore out to this we weighed about 150 pound this trophy so coming down the hill and you set it down he said i'm about to give out i said yep we come into a little pygmy spruce center about that high there's a few grouse flying around and there's automations and so i throw some rocks at him like that so he said um jeremy lam tommkins and i said no i don't believe so he said they're fine as good as grouse he said brother branham talk about his big old black hat fan himself he said about time that old bear show up any boy and i said i said but you're doubting that he said no i'm not but brother graham i i just can't understand i said you can ah it's not for me to understand it's for me to believe amen god in heaven knows these things are true would i stand here and say this it wasn't true then i started to turn around to give him the rifle and me pick up the head as i turned i said bud you got them glasses right here why does that stand up on the side hill he threw the glasses up he said oh help me said if it ain't somebody's milk cow ain't no such a thing in the country so that's the biggest grizzly i've ever seen in my life and so help me look at that yellow sun shiny one and he's a silver tip but how far you say he is i said about two mile up there where's about wore out he said i said what are we waiting on let's go he said you're sure getting him i said sure i'm worried again he said what's that gun you're using i said i never mind about that the little bitty gun some brother gave me in a meeting one time several years ago i said a little cheap 270 and i said all right i got i it's going to be we kept going a little closer i'm sure he got bigger that bear looks like he said oh he looks like a mammoth haystacks up there on that marshall stink great big mammoth thing he hit about that wine you know very big paws and he just poked out these little blueberry advantages i catch them eating them and so great big fella we got about all about 800 yards of him he said hey brother brandon did did you ever shoot a grizzly before i said i'll shop manny bear bud but i never did shoot a silver tip grizzly before he said you know the silver tip is the biggest fighter of all of them i said yeah i understood that he said he don't know how to die and i said well he said don't how how far you have i call chef get to him with that uh you just ask him write him a letter i'll give you that address he said let anybody write me about it won't steer any of them things let me tell them and so on and i said uh well i said uh he said now i said oh no i was closer than this but i was right up close to him he said we're getting pretty close now he can charge at any time i said i know it but i said but i said he'll be all right he said when you shoot a bear he said now brother bram you're shooting in the back you have to break him down because he'll keep on fighting he can't get up then i said no according to vision i shot him in the heart she said i hope you didn't make no mistake on that and i said i said i didn't i said i remember that because in a in a vision you're in you're in one conscious and both we explain it the other night you're two you can't forget it so there you are so we got in again about about 250 yards as just the last little cooley we went over and i said that's just about it now look at him isn't he a beauty yeah i guess he is i said all right bud now when i raise up from here he's coming i said you just watched and he said i'll be watching so i put a shell up in the barrel a gun you know that was down under this little coulee just as i raised up here he come i stopped shot and this sound like a pea shoe i never a bit more checked him up and nothing in my before you talk about speed i never seen anything like that he did not run a horse deer or anything a bear came like that him coming right down that hill right towards us okay and before i could get another shell and a gun he dropped it about oh about 30 40 yards from me just turned the end over in tucked heart lungs and all from him as the nozzler bullet you hand loaders so it uh load him up and he fell over bud's standing there and looked over his real wide mouth he said brother branham i didn't want him on my lap [Laughter] he said he said but i won't tell you after it's over boy if that hadn't been one of them visions and i'd seen it happen before i'd never come up here without close to that bear with you and neither one of us could budge me weight around a thousand pounds i guess so mammoth big fella we couldn't cleaning we got skinny we started on down and we said brother branham we picked up the horns he said if them horns are exactly 42 inches so i'm just going to have a run and fit i said you better have it right now then because that's what it is he said i have never seen i i it seems to me like i'm dreaming this and when we got down there and i said to um to eddie i said now you watch blaine will put his hands i remember there's a little hand around that horn remember brother freda i told you it would be and i said you watch it to eddie and so bud said wait you got his horse over there and we had bear i want to show them horses just tearing up everything you know how they do when they smell a grizzly or any kind of a bear so i i went over there help trying to hold a a saddle horse trying to get away and he went over and got his tape measure come walking across there looking at me like that he said come here blaine i punched eddie put it down on this and so it helped me 42 inches on the nose now them horns shrink about two inches when they dry up that grizzly bear is laying in my den room and the horns are hanging on the wall the taxidermists have fixed them and fix them up there's a tape measure hanging on them 42 inches exactly now what would god tell a man something like that for about a hunting trip when i got back mother praise the lord somewhere between here and there and you just see the confidence that brother branham displayed after god had given him a word uh he didn't let anybody discourage him and and i want to tell you if god has given you a word today don't you let nobody discourage you somewhere between here and there you will see the supernatural amen god will make a way let's put our hands together for jesus hallelujah amen let's have a word of prayer and i
