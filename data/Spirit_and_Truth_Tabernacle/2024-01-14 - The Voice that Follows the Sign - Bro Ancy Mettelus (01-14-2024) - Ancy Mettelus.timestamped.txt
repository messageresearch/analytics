[43:17] opportunity just to kind of share Christ
[43:19] uh with those that are just not thinking
[43:22] about uh they got to leave this place
[43:25] one day
[43:26] and uh and and and yesterday the
[43:29] question was asked um in in the eulogy
[43:33] you know uh what has life taught
[43:37] you there's a man the doctors told him
[43:40] that he had cancer stage four and he was
[43:42] dying and in his late 60s and his
[43:45] brother asked him said what has life
[43:46] taught you what lessons have you learned
[43:49] and he said what lessons have I learned
[43:51] I don't nothing I I I don't know what
[43:54] you're talking about so you ain't
[43:55] learned nothing and All These Years of
[43:56] Living what have you
[43:58] learned and he says I I I couldn't tell
[44:01] you he said well I learned I learned
[44:03] something I learned that after you leave
[44:06] here you going somewhere
[44:08] else and you need to be prepared for
[44:12] where you getting ready to go to and uh
[44:15] and if you're not prepared I'm here to
[44:16] help you get prepared you see so I think
[44:19] it's always an opportunity to talk to
[44:21] people uh when you're going through
[44:23] things like this get them closer to
[44:25] Christ
[44:26] amen it's very very important that to

[52:34] seriously
[52:38] because the bride in
[52:41] general is the bride of Christ
[52:44] am but in each local
[52:47] church brother Jackie here is the is the
[52:50] spiritual husband the
[52:52] leader that is
[52:54] why I never understand how a
[53:01] minister the husband let you in says you
[53:04] can come
[53:06] forward and you come and create
[53:10] chaos you cannot come and create

[53:29] bride amen every true
[53:33] Minister we watch over the king's bride
[53:36] that's why I tell the Beloved at
[53:40] Boon the greatest gift you can give
[53:43] us is when you live what we
[53:46] preach that's the greatest
[53:50] gift all the ministers want to see
[53:53] that that's why this morning
[53:56] morning pray for
[54:00] me the subject that the Lord has placed
[54:02] upon my
[54:04] heart sometimes I want to lean towards a
[54:07] teaching of it sometimes I want to
[54:09] preach
[54:12] it sometimes it makes me a little
[54:15] uncomfortable
[54:16] because there are certain
[54:20] ministers God can give you more than one
[54:22] gift amen that's right but the
[54:26] fullness is in Jesus Christ but it can
[54:32] happen God can give you more than one
[54:37] gift but there's one that always shows
[54:39] more amen so may the Lord richly bless

[55:27] next Sunday after I made the commentary
[55:29] to the
[55:31] church I appreciated the Simplicity and
[55:33] the humility that they
[55:35] had and there's one thing that I
[55:39] said it's as if in the weddings of the
[55:42] message
[55:43] churches the people tell
[55:46] God let me try being a pagan but just
[55:49] for the
[55:51] day I'm not leaving you behind
[55:54] completely but just give me a few today

[56:19] means it's what's inside that will
[56:22] reflect outside amen amen gory amen
[56:27] no we won't give the devil an
[56:31] inch when you give him an
[56:33] inch the devil doesn't overtake you that
[56:37] quickly he T he starts with the little
[56:42] inch and little by little until he
[56:44] completely takes you over in this
[56:47] message the seals have been
[56:51] broken you know what the seals mean is
[56:55] unmasking the
[56:58] devil the devil is
[57:01] unmasked we know what the devil
[57:03] is now we can serve God even better that
[57:07] is the goal of the
[57:08] seals to give the bride rapturing
[57:12] Faith that's why the message is here
[57:15] amen may the Lord richly bless
[57:17] you let's read let's read in
[57:23] Exodus praise
[57:32] God Exodus chapter
[57:35] 4 verse
[57:43] 1-8 Exodus 4 verse
[57:46] 1-8 and Moses answered and said but
[57:49] behold they will not believe me nor
[57:52] hearken unto my voice for they will say
[57:55] the Lord have not appeared unto thee and
[57:58] the Lord said unto him what is that in
[58:01] thine hand right he said a rod he said
[58:05] cast it on the ground and he cast it on
[58:08] the ground and it became a serpent and
[58:10] Moses fled from it and the Lord said
[58:12] unto Moses put forth thine hand take it
[58:15] by the tail and he put forth his hand
[58:18] and caught it and it became a rod in his
[58:21] hand that they may believe that the Lord
[58:24] God of their fathers and God of Abraham
[58:26] and God of Isaac and the god of Jacob
[58:29] has appeared onto thee and the Lord said
[58:32] further more unto him put now thine hand
[58:35] into thy bosom and he put it his hand in
[58:38] his bosom and he took it out behold his
[58:40] hand was leprous as snow and he said put
[58:43] thine hand into thy bosom again he put
[58:46] it into his bosom again and plucked it
[58:48] out of his bosom and behold it was
[58:50] turned again into his other flesh it
[58:53] shall come to pass that that they will
[58:55] not believe thee neither hearken to the
[58:57] voice of the first sign they will
[58:59] believe the voice of the latter sign
[59:02] amen
[59:04] amen may the Lord God add blessing to
[59:06] the reading of his word we ask brother

[1:01:52] crowd God through the sign
[1:01:56] signs the
[1:01:58] signs are to capture your
[1:02:01] attention to let you
[1:02:03] know that God is
[1:02:07] here that's what the signs are
[1:02:09] for that's
[1:02:12] why it's difficult to convert a
[1:02:18] Muslim you can't show up to them and
[1:02:20] tell them accept the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:02:21] as your
[1:02:22] savior you see the
[1:02:25] example Billy Graham went
[1:02:28] somewhere and they challenged
[1:02:30] him because many Muslims read the
[1:02:34] Bible many read the
[1:02:36] Bible they say this man you speak of the
[1:02:40] word says those who believe in him these
[1:02:43] are the signs that shall follow
[1:02:46] them brother Bram says I don't know if
[1:02:49] you ever read it he
[1:02:52] said Billy Graham is guilty
[1:02:55] the reason is the gift was
[1:02:59] there Billy Graham and brother
[1:03:02] Bram they were
[1:03:05] contemporaries they lived in the same
[1:03:07] age in fact but the brandom says Billy
[1:03:13] gram when he saw the
[1:03:16] supernatural
[1:03:18] manifest through brother bram's
[1:03:21] Ministry he said he must go to Sodom
[1:03:25] and tell them that time is
[1:03:29] here that
[1:03:31] means God gives the gifts to the
[1:03:35] church Billy Graham should have called
[1:03:40] them God gave the gift that's
[1:03:45] right some have the gift of
[1:03:48] healing God never call anyone to be
[1:03:51] worthless no
[1:03:53] no
[1:03:54] God doesn't call anyone to be worthless
[1:03:57] if you're here in the
[1:03:58] church if you
[1:04:00] believe you will be sealed with the Holy
[1:04:03] Ghost and once you are sealed with the
[1:04:05] Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost will lead you
[1:04:08] to what you ought to
[1:04:10] do don't just
[1:04:12] sit you cannot just sit no you must work
[1:04:16] for the Lord
[1:04:18] sir believe the
[1:04:22] word you can't show up to these Muslim
[1:04:24] countries and say accept the Lord Jesus
[1:04:27] Christ as your Savi no you need to show
[1:04:29] them Jesus
[1:04:31] Christ so that Jesus is not in the
[1:04:34] grave you must show them this
[1:04:39] morning speak of a Jesus in
[1:04:42] history we speak of Jesus Christ the
[1:04:45] Christ that was
[1:04:47] crucified that still
[1:04:49] heals that still
[1:04:51] saves that still delivers amen
[1:04:55] amen that is the Jesus we speak of that
[1:04:59] is manifested in this end time in the
[1:05:02] form of the spoken word amen amen that's
[1:05:06] the form he has right now amen
[1:05:10] amen the voice that follows the signs
[1:05:16] Glory the
[1:05:19] signs are just a part of the message
[1:05:22] right right
[1:05:25] what did John see John being a type of
[1:05:27] the
[1:05:28] Bride he says swallow the whole
[1:05:32] book he didn't say
[1:05:35] true he said
[1:05:39] swallow if you choose
[1:05:42] something you'll taste it if it's bitter
[1:05:45] you'll spit it
[1:05:49] out he said swallow
[1:05:53] it
[1:05:55] if it's a truth just swallow
[1:06:00] it do not reason with the
[1:06:04] word God didn't even ask you to
[1:06:06] understand he said
[1:06:10] believe he said
[1:06:13] believe I spent a few days at
[1:06:17] school method there's something called
[1:06:19] the scientific
[1:06:21] method that
[1:06:22] means a problem is
[1:06:25] presented so you need a
[1:06:27] solution so you start to collect data
[1:06:31] they start to observe and
[1:06:34] then then they do
[1:06:36] trials for example a
[1:06:38] vaccine
[1:06:40] until they accept it God doesn't work
[1:06:43] that way God says believe the
[1:06:47] word that's all he
[1:06:49] says later on he will reveal to you
[1:06:55] why if God says it if it's a truth from
[1:06:59] the Lord this morning your job is
[1:07:02] believe
[1:07:04] it we are completely different from
[1:07:07] science amen that's why in
[1:07:12] Eden the devil disarmed
[1:07:15] Eve he gave her a
[1:07:17] PhD from
[1:07:19] then men have been guessing they left
[1:07:22] God behind they're guessing through
[1:07:26] science
[1:07:28] until science
[1:07:31] proves that Jesus
[1:07:34] Christ he's the
[1:07:38] answer Jesus Christ is the only
[1:07:41] answer Corona virus it proved
[1:07:46] that there is only one hope for this
[1:07:49] world that is the Lord Jesus Christ it
[1:07:52] was always Jesus
[1:07:54] it will continue to be
[1:07:56] Jesus nothing
[1:07:59] else it's a
[1:08:01] medication that's the medication the
[1:08:03] world is rejecting right now that's why
[1:08:05] this
[1:08:07] morning I present you Doctor Jesus
[1:08:11] amen he's the
[1:08:13] one he's the one answer to every
[1:08:17] problem that can deliver you this
[1:08:20] morning no matter what condition you
[1:08:22] find yourself in
[1:08:25] Jesus can set you free Jesus can heal
[1:08:28] you amen
[1:08:30] amen no matter what stage you are in
[1:08:34] sin no matter what stage you are in your
[1:08:38] sickness the Lord Jesus Christ drct
[1:08:42] Jesus look to him take the
[1:08:46] prescription what is the
[1:08:48] prescription by his stripes we were
[1:08:52] healed that's all it is
[1:08:55] by his stripes we were healed amen
[1:09:00] amen amen amen the
[1:09:04] voice that follows the
[1:09:09] signs let's go back to Exodus
[1:09:12] 4 verse
[1:09:14] 30 we can start in verse
[1:09:18] 29 Moses and Aaron went and gathered
[1:09:21] together all the Elders of the children
[1:09:23] of is
[1:09:24] Israel and Aaron spake all the words
[1:09:26] which the Lord had spoken unto Moses did
[1:09:29] the signs in the sight of the
[1:09:32] people continue verse 31 and the people
[1:09:35] believed when they heard the Lord had
[1:09:38] visited the children of Israel and that
[1:09:40] he looked upon their Affliction and then
[1:09:43] they bowed their heads and
[1:09:46] worshiped so what do you see
[1:09:51] here Moses met the
[1:09:56] angel he gave Moses a
[1:09:59] mission Moses had a calling that was
[1:10:02] true but he got ahead of himself and he
[1:10:06] started he tried to start his ministry a
[1:10:07] bit too
[1:10:09] early you may have a
[1:10:11] calling you get ahead of
[1:10:15] yourself and you
[1:10:17] fail wait on the
[1:10:21] Lord there is a time for all things
[1:10:25] that is
[1:10:26] why a minister growing
[1:10:28] up you need to grow up through an
[1:10:32] assembly you must have a church you must
[1:10:35] persevere
[1:10:36] somewhere you must learn
[1:10:38] order you must learn to accept
[1:10:40] exhortation
[1:10:42] otherwise you will go through every
[1:10:45] assembly and only cause
[1:10:49] chaos and you won't even be aware of it
[1:10:52] you need to have an assem
[1:10:54] that raised you you you have a
[1:10:58] calling but you must
[1:11:01] wait that God
[1:11:03] himself he gives you the time to start
[1:11:06] and you start at that
[1:11:08] time Moses got ahead of
[1:11:11] himself that's
[1:11:14] why he ran away from the
[1:11:17] people so now if God sending him back to
[1:11:19] the people he need to have something
[1:11:22] different he needs a sign
[1:11:24] to manifest in front of the
[1:11:27] people so that then the
[1:11:30] people verse 31 what does it
[1:11:34] say and they
[1:11:38] believed when they
[1:11:40] heard that the Lord has visited the
[1:11:43] children of
[1:11:44] Israel and that he looked upon their
[1:11:46] Affliction
[1:11:47] amen they bowed their heads and
[1:11:51] worshiped the people believed
[1:11:54] what did they believe
[1:11:57] in here what did they believe
[1:12:00] in they believed in the
[1:12:03] sign but that's not all God
[1:12:06] wanted that's not where God wanted to
[1:12:10] stop
[1:12:11] God wants to move forward take them all
[1:12:14] the way he calls
[1:12:17] you there's somewhere he takes you from
[1:12:20] and there's somewhere he's taking you
[1:12:24] he's trying to take you
[1:12:27] somewhere God knowing this very
[1:12:30] well this is the
[1:12:36] sign did this same group of
[1:12:40] people it says here in verse
[1:12:45] 4 verse
[1:12:47] 31 it says the people
[1:12:51] believed the people believed right
[1:12:56] there's something Apostle Paul
[1:12:58] says in 1 Corinthians 15 I believe verse
[1:13:03] one let's read it you'll see where I'm
[1:13:10] going preaching is to take the people
[1:13:12] somewhere and land somewhere
[1:13:15] else you don't just come and say words
[1:13:18] preaching after the Beloved leave the
[1:13:21] service something must set in
[1:13:24] there's a lesson that must set
[1:13:26] in don't just speak
[1:13:29] words it's led by the Holy Ghost take
[1:13:33] the people from somewhere and bring them
[1:13:36] somewhere else closer to the Lord that
[1:13:39] is the goal of every
[1:13:40] teaching and every
[1:13:44] preaching the
[1:13:46] people they believed and they bowed and
[1:13:52] worshiped
[1:13:55] let's look at the
[1:13:58] exhortation Exodus
[1:14:04] 23 Exodus
[1:14:08] 23:20 and then we'll go back to First
[1:14:16] Corinthians Exodus 23:20 behold I send
[1:14:20] an angel before thee to keep thee in thy
[1:14:22] way and to bring thee into the place
[1:14:25] which I have
[1:14:27] prepared you
[1:14:29] see I send the angel before
[1:14:32] you to protect you in your
[1:14:35] way this morning did you call
[1:14:40] yourself God calls
[1:14:44] you you know what brother
[1:14:47] says even if you were to get
[1:14:51] sick until the Lord is done with
[1:14:57] you even if the doctor gave up on
[1:15:01] you your cancer is past the
[1:15:06] limits until God is
[1:15:09] done the
[1:15:11] devil the
[1:15:13] devil cannot take you before your
[1:15:19] time I want to tell you to trust in God
[1:15:24] a man did not call
[1:15:27] you don't look at your own
[1:15:30] weaknesses don't look at your own
[1:15:33] faults God chose you and he chose you on
[1:15:38] purpose he chose you the word says those
[1:15:43] he
[1:15:44] chose he
[1:15:46] predestinated predestin
[1:15:49] predestinated to do what is right yes
[1:15:52] Hallelujah
[1:15:54] but you must
[1:15:56] eat you must believe the word and take
[1:16:00] God at his
[1:16:02] word he exorts them
[1:16:08] here the message has
[1:16:12] protection only if you believe it only
[1:16:15] if you live
[1:16:16] it the message has
[1:16:19] protection he
[1:16:22] says
[1:16:24] bring to bring thee into the place which
[1:16:26] I have
[1:16:28] prepared the word
[1:16:29] says when I come Jesus Christ says this
[1:16:34] will I find faith on the
[1:16:37] earth will I find
[1:16:40] faith that
[1:16:42] means you'll be tested upon every word
[1:16:45] that you
[1:16:46] hear and every word that you
[1:16:49] sing you'll be tested on it that's why
[1:16:53] the brandom
[1:16:54] says every Son of God must be tested and
[1:17:00] tried that's
[1:17:02] why God is not going to catapult you
[1:17:05] into
[1:17:06] heaven no
[1:17:08] no you got to go through the path you
[1:17:11] got to walk through the
[1:17:13] path and you must pay the
[1:17:16] price there's a price to pay yes yes
[1:17:20] there's a price to pay he says if one
[1:17:23] would follow me let him take up his
[1:17:29] cross that's why this
[1:17:31] morning your first
[1:17:34] husband you need to die to
[1:17:37] him and then let God work with
[1:17:40] you the world was your first
[1:17:43] husband you can't love God and still
[1:17:46] love the world your first husband your
[1:17:50] first nature it needs to die
[1:17:55] right even God Israel was his first
[1:17:59] bride he didn't violate his own
[1:18:02] word he took the form of a man and he
[1:18:06] died after he got up he chose a
[1:18:08] different
[1:18:09] bride you see
[1:18:12] because once he died he fulfilled the
[1:18:15] law that
[1:18:17] means he couldn't be living when he came
[1:18:22] he told the disciples
[1:18:26] go only to the to the Sheep of
[1:18:28] Israel he wasn't he hadn't died yet
[1:18:32] because he came to his own
[1:18:35] bride but then his bride crucified him
[1:18:39] the Jews crucified
[1:18:40] him with with their own Bible in their
[1:18:43] hands They Crucified him he says well I
[1:18:48] died now I have the right to choose a
[1:18:50] different wife amen amen the word says
[1:18:55] He
[1:18:56] chose among the Nations a new
[1:19:00] people that carries his
[1:19:02] name that is
[1:19:05] why we inherit all things in Jesus
[1:19:08] Christ amen
[1:19:11] amen a Sanctified life that is your
[1:19:15] inheritance the holy spirit that is your
[1:19:20] inheritance a life that is consecrated
[1:19:24] that is your
[1:19:25] inheritance healing is your
[1:19:29] inheritance we inherit all things in
[1:19:31] Jesus
[1:19:32] Christ that is why also
[1:19:36] you if you want to serve the Lord you
[1:19:39] need to die to
[1:19:43] yourself the old husband must
[1:19:47] die that's right amen
[1:19:51] amen
[1:19:56] to bring thee into the place which I
[1:19:58] have prepared verse 21 21 this is the
[1:20:01] exhortation the
[1:20:04] warning beware of
[1:20:07] him and obey his
[1:20:11] voice what what must they obey the
[1:20:16] voice not the
[1:20:18] signs they believe the signs they saw
[1:20:21] the supernatural
[1:20:23] and they still died in the wilderness
[1:20:26] why they believe the
[1:20:28] signs but with believing in the signs
[1:20:31] they still died why you need to listen
[1:20:34] to The
[1:20:38] Voice you need to listen to The
[1:20:44] Voice provoke him
[1:20:46] not for he will not pardon your
[1:20:49] transgressions for my name is in him
[1:20:53] but if thou shal indeed obey his
[1:20:58] voice and do all that I shall speak then
[1:21:01] I will be an enemy unto thine
[1:21:04] enemies and an adversary unto thine
[1:21:08] adversaries he says
[1:21:11] here he promised to
[1:21:13] destroy multiple
[1:21:16] Nations he will destroy the other
[1:21:21] nations and he will give others in
[1:21:23] Israel's
[1:21:24] place that's why it says in Isaiah
[1:21:27] 43 he says why do you live Israel
[1:21:30] because I have given others in your
[1:21:32] place why are you living this morning
[1:21:35] Jesus took your
[1:21:38] place that's why you still have breath
[1:21:42] because you should have went to the
[1:21:45] cross from your
[1:21:48] birth from the crib you are guilty of
[1:21:51] his blood yes
[1:21:54] am born
[1:22:01] condemned even a child a child has never
[1:22:04] seen a lie
[1:22:06] spoken but
[1:22:08] nonetheless we always say
[1:22:12] this a parent always has another child
[1:22:15] that is called I don't
[1:22:21] know SF who did this I don't know I
[1:22:24] don't know call the other one who did
[1:22:27] this don't know I don't know that's why
[1:22:30] this morning both adults and children we
[1:22:34] all must be born again
[1:22:36] amen all must be born again
[1:22:42] amen you see what he
[1:22:45] says he
[1:22:47] says verse 24 Thou shalt not bow down to
[1:22:51] their gods
[1:22:54] nor serve
[1:22:56] them nor do after their
[1:23:00] works but Thou shalt utterly overthrow
[1:23:04] them and quite break down their images
[1:23:08] verse
[1:23:11] 25 and you shall serve the Lord your
[1:23:15] God he shall bless thy
[1:23:19] bread let me tell you
[1:23:21] something
[1:23:24] any father of a
[1:23:28] home you don't have to wait on your
[1:23:30] child to say they're hungry to know you
[1:23:32] have to feed them that is your
[1:23:34] responsibility as a
[1:23:35] father that is your responsibility the
[1:23:38] responsibility of a
[1:23:39] father God promised them
[1:23:43] this this is what he's promising them he
[1:23:46] will bless their bread and the water you
[1:23:49] must listen to The
[1:23:51] Voice
[1:23:55] not only will he bless their bread and
[1:23:58] their
[1:24:00] water what does man
[1:24:02] need you need to eat you need
[1:24:06] health
[1:24:08] right I would say these are the two most
[1:24:10] essential things and he promised it to
[1:24:12] them right
[1:24:14] here the Bible tells you that even the
[1:24:16] shoes on their feet was not worn out
[1:24:19] even their clothing was not worn out at
[1:24:23] night God through the
[1:24:26] cloud projected he through the cloud he
[1:24:29] gave them light in the
[1:24:31] night so that they don't live in
[1:24:34] darkness he gave them
[1:24:37] electricity he gave them
[1:24:39] light in the
[1:24:41] daytime the blazing sun and there was a
[1:24:45] cloud that covered
[1:24:47] them God owed them
[1:24:49] protection because he called them he
[1:24:52] will take care of
[1:24:54] them he will take care of you the
[1:24:57] problem
[1:24:58] is when Jesus Christ said when I return
[1:25:02] will I find
[1:25:05] Faith don't tell me you believe this
[1:25:09] message
[1:25:10] and you work three jobs and you don't
[1:25:14] spare a day to come and worship and you
[1:25:16] say you
[1:25:18] believe you say you believe you have no
[1:25:21] time to worship no time to read your
[1:25:24] Bible but you say you trust in God when
[1:25:28] I shall return will I find faith on the
[1:25:34] earth that's what he
[1:25:36] says let me tell you this morning the
[1:25:39] word says it is
[1:25:42] impossible without faith to please the
[1:25:45] Lord all things that we do we must do it
[1:25:48] by faith we're Saved By Faith we're
[1:25:51] healed by faith
[1:25:53] all that we do we do it by faith you
[1:25:56] want a job you take it by faith isn't
[1:25:59] that right you need you want to M get
[1:26:02] married may your faith provide you your
[1:26:05] spouse a husband or a wife Facebook it's
[1:26:09] not on
[1:26:09] Facebook you got to publicize your
[1:26:13] body I'm single I'm single I'm looking
[1:26:16] for a boy and I need a boy or I'm
[1:26:18] looking for a girl or I need a
[1:26:21] girl you have no
[1:26:25] faith Rebecca was at
[1:26:28] home and her faith brought Isaac to
[1:26:37] her will he find faith on the earth
[1:26:41] everything you do is done by Faith by
[1:26:45] faith
[1:26:47] means I trust in the Lord on his word
[1:26:53] I trust in God through his
[1:27:03] word
[1:27:06] amen verse
[1:27:09] 25 I Will Bless thy
[1:27:12] bread and thy
[1:27:15] water and listen to this and I will take
[1:27:20] sickness away
[1:27:24] where you see the promises he's making
[1:27:27] didn't Jesus make you the same promises
[1:27:29] but what's the problem when I return
[1:27:32] will I find faith on the
[1:27:36] earth faith on the
[1:27:38] earth who can believe these
[1:27:41] words who can believe in what the Lord
[1:27:43] is saying in the end
[1:27:51] time
[1:27:55] I will take sickness away from the midst
[1:27:57] of
[1:27:59] thee there shall
[1:28:01] nothing cast their
[1:28:04] young nor be Barren in thy land you want
[1:28:08] children may my faith give me
[1:28:12] children my faith will give me children
[1:28:15] I remember there was a brother in my
[1:28:17] assembly that I grew up in in Haiti he
[1:28:19] spent many years not having children
[1:28:22] seven eight years after
[1:28:24] marriage every time he
[1:28:26] eats he put a little a little table a
[1:28:29] little chair next to the
[1:28:30] table he said what he wanted he said I
[1:28:34] want a
[1:28:35] son he said my son will be called Joseph
[1:28:38] he said little Joseph come and eat with
[1:28:43] Daddy he spent years doing
[1:28:47] that his wife had a child a son he
[1:28:51] called him Joseph now Joseph is eating
[1:28:54] with
[1:28:58] daddy that is the problem for us
[1:29:01] Christians
[1:29:02] today they don't really
[1:29:06] believe that is the
[1:29:11] problem they don't
[1:29:19] believe see Peter
[1:29:24] Peter spent all day fishing in one
[1:29:27] spot Jesus came he said
[1:29:32] Master where you're telling me to cast
[1:29:34] The Net that's the same spot I've been
[1:29:35] doing it all day okay all
[1:29:38] right but on Thy word but on Thy Word on
[1:29:44] Thy word I will cast The Net in the same
[1:29:47] spot
[1:29:48] sir on Thy word Glory
[1:29:55] beloved it's very
[1:29:58] easy take God at his word and you will
[1:30:02] be blessed for
[1:30:03] it you see the exaltations they
[1:30:07] receive what was this this there were
[1:30:10] the
[1:30:11] signs but when they got to the part of
[1:30:14] the
[1:30:15] voice let's look at what the prophet
[1:30:17] says the voice
[1:30:19] is let's look and see we have some
[1:30:23] quotes we're going to go a little bit
[1:30:29] quicker in this message called the
[1:30:33] token March 8th
[1:30:38] 1964 we'll lay a foundation and then
[1:30:40] we'll move
[1:30:42] forward we'll read a few of these quotes
[1:30:45] paragraph
[1:30:47] 72 see there was a message just before
[1:30:51] the taking out out of the
[1:30:55] church there always has to
[1:30:58] be same
[1:31:00] now everything spiritual spiritual
[1:31:04] happening is a sign from
[1:31:07] God do you believe that congregation
[1:31:10] says amen like the message there is a
[1:31:13] sign and then the message follows the
[1:31:19] sign the
[1:31:20] sign
[1:31:22] is not the
[1:31:24] message but the
[1:31:26] message follows the
[1:31:28] sign I see many
[1:31:31] preachers in my
[1:31:34] experience that shook all the kingdom of
[1:31:37] hell that had gifts of
[1:31:40] healing that preach under anointing and
[1:31:43] then later on they then Deni the
[1:31:48] message I've seen brothers and sisters
[1:31:51] sing in the Spirit Worship in the spirit
[1:31:55] and then later
[1:31:57] on when the voice starts to
[1:32:00] speak they deny the
[1:32:05] message so that brought me
[1:32:08] back I said let me
[1:32:10] look in the old Covenant let's let's see
[1:32:12] what
[1:32:14] happening the people believe the sign
[1:32:17] and we read
[1:32:18] that but they all died once the voice
[1:32:21] started to speak
[1:32:22] they didn't believe
[1:32:25] but it's the
[1:32:28] voice it's the word of
[1:32:32] God that's what was going to get them to
[1:32:34] the other
[1:32:35] side you see let's look at what he says
[1:32:39] here every spiritual happening is a sign
[1:32:42] from
[1:32:45] God do you believe that like the message
[1:32:49] there is a
[1:32:50] sign then the message follows the
[1:32:53] sign God bless you Sister
[1:32:56] Esther yes God told
[1:33:00] Moses if they won't believe the voice of
[1:33:04] the first
[1:33:08] sign that's what we just read maybe
[1:33:10] they'll believe the voice of the second
[1:33:12] sign what is God looking for he's trying
[1:33:16] to capture their attention so that he
[1:33:18] can speak to
[1:33:19] them he's trying to get your ATT the
[1:33:23] signs are just to capture your
[1:33:25] attention the PS are an
[1:33:28] attraction and brother brandom says
[1:33:30] this and the message possessing the
[1:33:33] gates of your enemy paragraph 69 he
[1:33:37] says I'm waiting for
[1:33:40] something better
[1:33:44] higher that's not just
[1:33:47] discernment he says I'm waiting on
[1:33:49] something I know it's coming I'm waiting
[1:33:52] on it you see that's why if you
[1:33:58] look there's nowhere in the
[1:34:01] Bible that seven angels visited the
[1:34:03] Earth all at
[1:34:05] once only in our
[1:34:08] generation that brought forth a
[1:34:12] message you had the two
[1:34:15] pools one angel
[1:34:19] came when the seven Angels came down to
[1:34:24] bring forth to reveal and bring the
[1:34:28] message it took seven angels that's
[1:34:31] never happened
[1:34:33] before that's the message you have right
[1:34:36] now seven angels visited the
[1:34:40] earth when they took brother
[1:34:42] brandham something came into his
[1:34:47] hands he says this is the
[1:34:49] sword not the sword of the king
[1:34:53] King not the sword of a king the sword
[1:34:58] of the
[1:35:00] king that is the spoken
[1:35:03] word that will give the
[1:35:06] bride rapturing
[1:35:09] Faith that'll give the bride what
[1:35:12] rapturing
[1:35:20] faith yes now when you see the signs
[1:35:23] going
[1:35:25] on and no message behind
[1:35:29] it just the same old
[1:35:33] theology you
[1:35:35] see what does it
[1:35:39] say if if the sign is going
[1:35:43] on and there's no message behind
[1:35:48] it just the same old Theology and on
[1:35:51] down
[1:35:52] what does that mean that's just
[1:35:56] denominations what is it just another
[1:36:00] denomination you'll
[1:36:05] understand the evidence of the Holy
[1:36:08] Spirit but makes it very
[1:36:12] clear is when you can believe the
[1:36:14] message for your
[1:36:16] day not even
[1:36:19] love believing
[1:36:22] right a
[1:36:24] brother let me tell you
[1:36:27] something do not be
[1:36:29] deceived don't let the devil deceive you
[1:36:35] sanctification is very close to the
[1:36:37] baptism of the Holy
[1:36:40] Spirit just because you live a
[1:36:42] Sanctified
[1:36:44] life does not mean that you you've made
[1:36:48] it because sanctification
[1:36:52] is very
[1:36:55] deceiving you can see a brother making
[1:36:58] mistakes but in his
[1:37:00] heart he truly believed the message
[1:37:04] 100% that's why theand
[1:37:06] says the evidence of the holy
[1:37:09] spirit is not the fruits of the spirit
[1:37:13] the evidence of the Holy Spirit I have
[1:37:16] the quote here let me see if I can find
[1:37:20] it don't have a
[1:37:23] message I don't have a
[1:37:25] message but I believe the
[1:37:28] message the message comes from God if I
[1:37:31] come
[1:37:33] here I have a responsibility of telling
[1:37:35] you the truth the reason being brother M
[1:37:39] says I'd rather you be angry with me
[1:37:42] today but be happy with me when we get
[1:37:44] to the other side on the other
[1:37:47] side and you don't have to call me a
[1:37:49] deceiver when you come here when you
[1:37:52] come here you're not here to hear what
[1:37:56] you want to hear you're
[1:37:59] here to hear God
[1:38:02] speaking through the
[1:38:04] servants that were
[1:38:06] chosen the foundation of the
[1:38:09] world said the fivefold
[1:38:12] ministry were there before the
[1:38:14] foundation of the
[1:38:15] world which is different the nine gifts
[1:38:19] of the
[1:38:19] Spirit that can
[1:38:22] have because of your
[1:38:25] consecration because of a certain
[1:38:27] spiritual
[1:38:28] atmosphere but a five-fold Ministry but
[1:38:31] Brom
[1:38:32] says they were preordination
[1:38:34] before the foundation of the
[1:38:36] world but the brandom calls them the
[1:38:38] army of
[1:38:40] God the five-fold ministry I won't have
[1:38:43] time to read that
[1:38:44] part he calls them the army of God they
[1:38:47] watch over the enemy they watch from the
[1:38:50] enemy
[1:38:51] God will place ministers here place a
[1:38:54] pastor here to watch over your
[1:38:59] soul the the
[1:39:02] duty that we have is to put the devil
[1:39:06] out he'll come he'll show up he'll be
[1:39:10] here but the one
[1:39:14] thing you must have the spoken
[1:39:17] word so that when he's here
[1:39:21] he can be paralyzed and he's unable to
[1:39:25] operate who would have told you that
[1:39:27] Judas would be in the Church of
[1:39:30] Christ
[1:39:32] see in every Church brother brandom says
[1:39:34] there is three types of
[1:39:36] Believers three types of Believers don't
[1:39:39] forget what I'm showing you what kind of
[1:39:42] believer are
[1:39:44] you let me make it
[1:39:47] clear the whole group left Egypt
[1:39:52] I was going to read the quote I know I
[1:39:54] have it here but the ROM
[1:39:57] says the evidence of the holy
[1:40:00] spirit that someone has the Holy Spirit
[1:40:03] when they're able to
[1:40:05] believe without a without any doubt the
[1:40:09] message for their
[1:40:12] day that's
[1:40:15] why a sister was
[1:40:19] Disturbed she was saying do I have the
[1:40:22] Holy Ghost or do I not but the BAM says
[1:40:25] he called her by her name sister so and
[1:40:29] so you know he's the prophet he
[1:40:32] discerned her he SE that it was
[1:40:35] bothering
[1:40:36] her do I have it or don't I say sister
[1:40:40] you have
[1:40:41] it do you believe the message for your
[1:40:44] day
[1:40:45] amen that is the evidence that you are
[1:40:49] sealed with the Holy Spirit let's look
[1:40:51] and
[1:40:54] see let's go to Exodus
[1:40:58] 12 we're going to move a little
[1:41:03] quicker Exodus
[1:41:15] 12 verse
[1:41:19] 37
[1:41:24] the subtitle is what kind of believer
[1:41:26] are
[1:41:32] you and the children of Israel journeyed
[1:41:36] from Ramses to
[1:41:38] suth about
[1:41:40] 600,000 on foot that were men besides
[1:41:45] children and a mixed multitude went up
[1:41:48] also with them and flocks and herds and
[1:41:51] even every and even very much
[1:41:55] cattle
[1:41:57] okay
[1:42:02] here around
[1:42:05] 600,000 but the M says once you count
[1:42:07] the children and the
[1:42:09] women how much were they two
[1:42:14] million
[1:42:17] but there's a group here
[1:42:25] they went into the Exodus but they
[1:42:26] weren't called by
[1:42:28] God and it says
[1:42:32] here verse 38 called them a mix
[1:42:36] group mude that's what it says a mixed
[1:42:42] multitude they were
[1:42:44] baptized like because they went through
[1:42:46] the Red Sea like everyone else they were
[1:42:49] baptized
[1:42:51] they were
[1:42:53] baptized the word says they
[1:42:55] baptized in the name of their Liberator
[1:42:58] which is Moses
[1:43:00] Moses they were
[1:43:02] baptized and kept moving
[1:43:05] forward you'll
[1:43:09] see this group is the first group to
[1:43:11] start to
[1:43:12] complain start to
[1:43:15] murmur and then they infected the
[1:43:18] children of
[1:43:19] Israel they got infected
[1:43:24] this these are not true
[1:43:27] believers there were
[1:43:29] unbelievers that were
[1:43:31] baptized but they're sitting in Moses
[1:43:36] Church they're the first one to start
[1:43:38] the
[1:43:40] complaining they start the
[1:43:44] revolting sitting in the assembly did
[1:43:47] God call them no no but
[1:43:51] they say they believe they were baptized
[1:43:55] they went through the Red
[1:43:56] Sea they even ate the
[1:44:00] Mana they even ate the
[1:44:03] Mana they were being benefiting from all
[1:44:06] the
[1:44:07] protection when the
[1:44:12] sun when God became the cloud they're
[1:44:15] protected from the
[1:44:17] Sun at night they had the pillar of Fire
[1:44:21] they benefited from all the
[1:44:24] blessings but there were unbelievers in
[1:44:26] the
[1:44:28] church they didn't
[1:44:31] believe but
[1:44:33] now kept moving
[1:44:35] forward the children of Israel got
[1:44:38] infected they also started to take part
[1:44:41] of the
[1:44:43] complaining and then they started to
[1:44:45] rise up against
[1:44:48] Moses against the orders the the
[1:44:50] Commandments that Moses was giving to
[1:44:53] the
[1:44:55] people let's go to numbers
[1:45:05] 11 numbers 11 verse
[1:45:12] 4 verse
[1:45:16] four and the mixed multitude that was
[1:45:19] among them f
[1:45:23] austing they started
[1:45:25] it they started it and you see later
[1:45:29] on and the children of Israel wept again
[1:45:33] and they started to
[1:45:38] revolt so
[1:45:44] now the
[1:45:48] reason this is the worst thing that that
[1:45:50] you can
[1:45:53] do doubt the power of
[1:45:58] God th the word of
[1:46:01] God they saw the
[1:46:04] Miracles they saw the Lord deliver
[1:46:07] them so if you're
[1:46:10] hungry just go back to
[1:46:13] God speak to God brother brandham
[1:46:18] says when they got before the Red Sea
[1:46:23] they didn't even have they didn't even
[1:46:24] have to
[1:46:26] pray you
[1:46:28] pray when you don't know God's will the
[1:46:31] word came out God said he's going to
[1:46:34] take
[1:46:35] you Egypt and lead you to
[1:46:38] Canaan so that
[1:46:40] means so any obstacle in between you and
[1:46:43] Canaan he said why do you
[1:46:47] cry
[1:46:49] speak
[1:46:51] you must
[1:46:52] speak because you already know God's
[1:46:55] will so if you
[1:46:57] get in front of an
[1:47:01] obstacle that obstacle shouldn't be
[1:47:03] there just
[1:47:08] speak
[1:47:10] speak we you already know the will I
[1:47:13] said you're going to Canaan so anything
[1:47:16] in between you and Canaan whether it's a
[1:47:19] sea whether it's other nations whether
[1:47:22] it's problems whether it's hunger just
[1:47:25] trust in
[1:47:30] me you already know God's will the word
[1:47:35] says it is not the will of God that any
[1:47:38] should be sick
[1:47:41] but the sickness can
[1:47:43] come because of
[1:47:45] sin or maybe you didn't do
[1:47:47] anything if you're sick you check your
[1:47:51] life and you're good just know you're
[1:47:54] being
[1:47:55] tested if you're
[1:47:57] sick and it's not because of your own
[1:47:59] sin you're living a Christian Life just
[1:48:03] know you're being
[1:48:04] tested and exercise your
[1:48:08] faith exercise your faith
[1:48:12] because on the other side those who will
[1:48:15] go to the
[1:48:16] Rapture you must have a
[1:48:19] testimony not a single person will be
[1:48:21] raptured with no
[1:48:25] testimony if you didn't know that I'm
[1:48:27] letting you know
[1:48:28] today no one will be raptured without
[1:48:32] having a
[1:48:33] testimony
[1:48:35] because only Overcomers will go that
[1:48:39] means I was in a
[1:48:44] battle it could be a battle against a
[1:48:46] sickness and possessing the gates of
[1:48:48] your enemy it can be
[1:48:50] a battle against a
[1:48:53] sickness or a battle against my own
[1:48:58] personality when you ask the Lord for
[1:49:01] patience you ask him for more
[1:49:04] tests if you ask God for
[1:49:06] temperance it's a more
[1:49:08] test why is it that when the test come
[1:49:11] you all you do is
[1:49:13] complain why do you
[1:49:15] complain he
[1:49:18] says you say you want to like the statue
[1:49:21] of a perfect
[1:49:23] man he's not going to catapult you into
[1:49:26] heaven Overcomers you must overcome sin
[1:49:30] overcome sickness overcome
[1:49:36] vices in every
[1:49:39] age if you read up
[1:49:41] Revelations the end of each chapter to
[1:49:45] them who overcome to he who overcome in
[1:49:48] every
[1:49:49] age
[1:49:50] all the church ages in Revelations to he
[1:49:53] who overcomes that's the end so I'm
[1:49:56] telling you you must overcome
[1:50:02] Leia that's
[1:50:04] why God gives you the anointing of an
[1:50:08] eagle not just any eag a flying
[1:50:13] eagle not just any ego ego in the
[1:50:17] air that's the anointing you have amen
[1:50:20] you see
[1:50:22] here
[1:50:25] now you'll see
[1:50:32] that even the 70 that receive the spirit
[1:50:35] of Moses and also prophesied they all
[1:50:38] died
[1:50:41] too 70
[1:50:43] ministers they all died
[1:50:48] too when it come to the point where they
[1:50:50] have to go explore the
[1:50:52] land they chose
[1:50:54] 10 10
[1:50:57] ministers only two actually believe the
[1:51:01] message only two believe the message
[1:51:04] what was the message
[1:51:07] Canaan whatever what I see with my eyes
[1:51:10] in Canaan God already spoke God said
[1:51:13] this is ours and he gives us the land he
[1:51:16] gives us the country so what more do we
[1:51:19] need to believe
[1:51:21] are you believing the Giants or are you
[1:51:22] believing
[1:51:23] God Giants that your eyes
[1:51:26] see that's the problem today we have to
[1:51:29] see
[1:51:30] it
[1:51:32] no trust in
[1:51:36] God take God at his word when I shall
[1:51:40] return will I find faith on the
[1:51:46] earth because the
[1:51:48] rapture
[1:51:50] you must have
[1:51:53] faith Enoch had Faith that's what it
[1:51:58] says a man of like
[1:52:00] nature born of a woman just like us and
[1:52:05] then he had believed his Rapture so
[1:52:09] much in his
[1:52:12] generation there were many things
[1:52:14] happening in the generation of Enoch
[1:52:16] mixed marriages many things on the earth
[1:52:18] going on
[1:52:20] you
[1:52:22] see and he overcame
[1:52:25] everything if you tell me you have faith
[1:52:28] you must overcome
[1:52:31] sin
[1:52:32] until I can see you overcome sin
[1:52:37] overcome the
[1:52:38] world overcome the vices of the flesh
[1:52:42] then because we're saved by
[1:52:45] faith if we're saved by
[1:52:47] faith we must live the life of someone
[1:52:50] who is
[1:52:51] saved live the life of someone who's
[1:52:54] saved so you see
[1:52:57] here they set
[1:53:00] out they saw the
[1:53:03] land they even came with evidence of
[1:53:06] what was said of the
[1:53:08] land what God Said is
[1:53:11] true the land
[1:53:13] exists we have evidence of its existence
[1:53:16] and they still didn't believe
[1:53:18] God
[1:53:22] they still didn't believe when they
[1:53:27] came then they went to the assembly to
[1:53:35] preach 10 ministers bringing 10 reports
[1:53:39] they disturb the
[1:53:40] people they taught the people something
[1:53:45] contrary and then an uprising came they
[1:53:48] up they tried to uprise against Moses
[1:53:51] to the point two other
[1:53:54] ministers they said be
[1:53:56] still be
[1:54:00] still let's read
[1:54:02] it let's read
[1:54:07] it Exodus
[1:54:10] numbers numbers
[1:54:17] 14 yes okay
[1:54:20] does MH numbers
[1:54:28] 14 the
[1:54:33] unbelievers is people the mixed crowd
[1:54:37] the unbelievers they came in with the
[1:54:38] with the children of
[1:54:40] Israel and then the make
[1:54:46] Believers is those
[1:54:48] 10
[1:54:51] among the 10 people that Moses
[1:54:55] chose they believed a separate
[1:54:57] message and they were teaching the
[1:54:59] people a separate message and the people
[1:55:01] lost their faith and they didn't make
[1:55:07] it million two out of two
[1:55:10] million million two out of two
[1:55:13] million that must mean something to us
[1:55:17] today I don't know how much time
[1:55:23] we got to get to the New Testament we're
[1:55:26] going to go
[1:55:27] fast two out of two
[1:55:30] million that's how many believe the
[1:55:32] message Mo Moses believed
[1:55:36] it Moses didn't make it not because he
[1:55:38] didn't
[1:55:39] believe because he didn't listen to the
[1:55:41] voice of God his anger
[1:55:43] issues but how many made it two out of
[1:55:48] two million
[1:55:51] that
[1:55:53] left unbelievers was among
[1:55:56] them there were make Believers among
[1:55:58] them because they saw the signs they
[1:56:02] believed at some point they believed in
[1:56:05] God that's
[1:56:07] why Paul told
[1:56:10] Timothy he says watch over
[1:56:12] yourself and watch over your teachings
[1:56:15] because when you do that you save
[1:56:17] yourself and you save those listen to
[1:56:20] your
[1:56:21] teachings Paul said that to
[1:56:25] Timothy there's a quote that I didn't
[1:56:27] read I'll read that
[1:56:28] one let's read this
[1:56:36] quickly brother bradam explains you what
[1:56:39] the voice
[1:56:42] is scriptural signs of the
[1:56:48] time April 10th 1964
[1:56:53] yes we're going to finish I'm trying to
[1:56:57] put it together I'm trying to
[1:56:59] close because I want you to learn
[1:57:01] something this
[1:57:02] morning paragraph
[1:57:04] 23 say for
[1:57:07] instance his denominational voice
[1:57:09] followed a certain
[1:57:12] sign God never sent
[1:57:15] that we've had denominations all these
[1:57:18] years it's got to be something
[1:57:23] different when I hear a preacher
[1:57:26] say I stay with the Bible I put brandom
[1:57:29] to the side I'm GNA stick with the
[1:57:31] Bible you always had the
[1:57:36] Bible you always had the
[1:57:39] Bible said all these years you had your
[1:57:43] denominations but now something must be
[1:57:48] different
[1:57:50] glory to God it's got to be thus said
[1:57:52] the
[1:57:53] lord it's as if when they say this
[1:57:56] brother brandham doesn't preach the
[1:57:58] Bible beloved
[1:58:06] beloved did it say to know if someone's
[1:58:08] a prophet you got to find it on
[1:58:12] Google as
[1:58:14] Siri his brother Prophet his brother
[1:58:17] Bram the
[1:58:18] prophet
[1:58:20] is that what he
[1:58:21] said I go even further even the
[1:58:25] Bible even the
[1:58:29] Bible even the
[1:58:31] Bible will not say such and such is the
[1:58:36] prophet let me give you an
[1:58:41] example the adulterous woman the ill
[1:58:44] Fame
[1:58:47] woman when Jesus Jesus started to speak
[1:58:51] with her she stopped She said Lord I
[1:58:57] perceive I
[1:59:00] perceive did she Google it did she read
[1:59:04] it in her Bible no
[1:59:06] no God reveals himself to his people
[1:59:11] that's
[1:59:12] why you're sitting here let's thank
[1:59:16] God for the revelation
[1:59:20] Revelation is worth more than
[1:59:22] gold Revelation is worth more than
[1:59:26] silver Jesus told Peter blessed are thou
[1:59:31] Peter not because Peter won the
[1:59:34] lottery Christians shouldn't be playing
[1:59:35] the lottery anyway you need to have
[1:59:39] faith the lottery is not going to solve
[1:59:42] your problems you need to have
[1:59:45] faith everything you need take it by
[1:59:49] faith
[1:59:51] he said blessed are thou
[1:59:53] Peter because Flesh and Blood did not
[1:59:55] reveal this to you you
[1:59:58] see did Peter read it in a
[2:00:01] book to know who the person in front of
[2:00:04] him
[2:00:05] was Jehovah on the earth did he read
[2:00:08] that in his
[2:00:10] Bible you see
[2:00:13] today if you read what people say
[2:00:14] brother brandom on
[2:00:16] YouTube or I don't know where
[2:00:20] and that's what's going to make you
[2:00:21] accept it or not you're just confusing
[2:00:25] yourself
[2:00:27] Revelation is
[2:00:31] personal when you when you have a
[2:00:33] revelation you don't waste your
[2:00:35] time
[2:00:37] revelation will help us know God's
[2:00:40] will what pleases the
[2:00:43] Lord by faith Abel offered
[2:00:49] an offering that was more
[2:00:54] excellent a more excellent
[2:01:00] sacrifice we're not
[2:01:02] guessing we are people with
[2:01:07] Revelation people who don't have a
[2:01:08] revelation they waste time you don't see
[2:01:11] what can does he was
[2:01:14] tired he climbed every tree in the
[2:01:17] garden to pick out every single every
[2:01:20] single
[2:01:21] fruit uh
[2:01:23] mango Apple because he doesn't know
[2:01:26] which one the Lord
[2:01:28] wants if he if God doesn't like this
[2:01:31] mango he'll take this avocado if he
[2:01:34] doesn't like this avocado he'll take
[2:01:36] this coconut people don't serve God this
[2:01:38] way you serve God by faith what is Faith
[2:01:44] it is a revelation a personal
[2:01:47] revelation that's what faith
[2:01:53] is what you
[2:01:57] see to
[2:02:00] finish it's got to be thus said the Lord
[2:02:02] in the
[2:02:04] scripture God got to promise it by the
[2:02:10] word then a sign is to attract the
[2:02:13] people's attention to it the sign is to
[2:02:16] attract the attention and then the voice
[2:02:19] follows the
[2:02:21] sign that's the
[2:02:26] doctrine what's the
[2:02:28] voice the
[2:02:30] doctrine the doctrine will make you lost
[2:02:33] it will also save some I will take one
[2:02:37] example in the Old
[2:02:44] Testament let's go to Deuteronomy
[2:02:47] 7
[2:02:53] Deuteronomy
[2:02:59] 7 starting in verse
[2:03:04] two we can start in verse one to save
[2:03:07] time we'll start in verse
[2:03:10] two this is one of the things the voice
[2:03:13] started to say which is the
[2:03:16] doctrine do not go into mixed
[2:03:20] marriages mix unions the day that they
[2:03:23] did
[2:03:26] it tens of thousands died that very
[2:03:29] day they failed to listen to The Voice
[2:03:33] Moses already told
[2:03:35] them if they have unions with these
[2:03:38] other nations you see they will
[2:03:43] die and they didn't just do it that
[2:03:45] easily that simply it was from a
[2:03:48] minister
[2:03:52] bam he taught them
[2:03:55] this you
[2:03:57] see God said
[2:04:00] this God does not like
[2:04:03] mixture that's
[2:04:04] why make
[2:04:07] sure it's your faith that gets you a
[2:04:10] husband or that gets you a wife through
[2:04:12] the
[2:04:15] word when you go to the New Testament as
[2:04:18] I
[2:04:24] finish Jesus started healing with a
[2:04:26] healing campaign isn't that
[2:04:30] right and a great multitude is following
[2:04:33] Jesus in John 6 let's look at that John
[2:04:38] John
[2:04:43] 6 can I get five more
[2:04:47] minutes
[2:04:56] a great multitude follow Jesus through
[2:04:57] his healing
[2:05:00] campaign I'll quote it for you I won't
[2:05:02] read
[2:05:03] it brother Bram
[2:05:14] says he says the people always want to
[2:05:18] accept the sign and then reject the
[2:05:23] voice voice of the sign the voice of the
[2:05:29] sign March
[2:05:31] 21st
[2:05:33] 1964 paragraph 206 you can read it
[2:05:36] yourself he
[2:05:40] says once the signs come you become you
[2:05:42] become popular right mtit a multitude
[2:05:47] followed Christ
[2:05:49] because they're seeing the
[2:05:51] signs
[2:05:53] healing where were all those people when
[2:05:55] they crucified Christ not a single
[2:05:58] person took a stand for
[2:06:00] him thousands of
[2:06:03] people where were
[2:06:07] they and
[2:06:11] then they got
[2:06:13] hungry Jesus multiplied the bread and
[2:06:15] the
[2:06:16] fish Supernatural in the
[2:06:19] manifestation that's still not the
[2:06:24] voice they continue to follow him in
[2:06:27] fact they even wanted to make him
[2:06:31] King they say man if this man takes
[2:06:34] herod's
[2:06:36] place we'll never go hungry
[2:06:41] again that
[2:06:43] means in regards to eating that's taken
[2:06:46] care
[2:06:47] of
[2:06:49] why are you here this
[2:06:52] morning what brought you here this
[2:06:57] morning you must come with the right
[2:06:59] intentions the right
[2:07:01] motive when you come into the house of
[2:07:03] the Lord to
[2:07:05] worship that
[2:07:07] me your motive is to want to look like
[2:07:12] him that's the only reason you should
[2:07:13] leave home that's why when they preach
[2:07:20] they say a
[2:07:21] word you say that's for the
[2:07:24] neighbor because you know what the
[2:07:27] neighbor did and you say
[2:07:31] amen that's that's not a good
[2:07:35] amen a true
[2:07:37] amen is when God speaks to your
[2:07:41] case when God speaks to your case and
[2:07:44] you know you're
[2:07:46] guilty and then
[2:07:49] and you have enough strength to say
[2:07:53] Amen that mean you prophesy on
[2:07:57] yourself you prophesy on yourself that
[2:08:01] means you say Amen
[2:08:06] Lord yes this is me I'm in this
[2:08:09] condition I don't like to
[2:08:12] forgive I have bitterness in my
[2:08:16] heart and it shouldn't be that way I am
[2:08:20] a Son of God I want to be the I want to
[2:08:23] be this
[2:08:25] way so I say Amen to
[2:08:28] it one good day you will look for that
[2:08:31] demon it'll be nowhere to be found
[2:08:34] you'll be
[2:08:35] delivered because you prophesied on
[2:08:38] yourself you see the adulterous
[2:08:40] woman she
[2:08:43] rejoiced she said behold I found a man
[2:08:46] that told me all that I've done
[2:08:48] when you come to church if God doesn't
[2:08:51] speak to you and what you've done you
[2:08:53] were not blessed that day you did not
[2:08:55] have a good service for me if I go to
[2:08:58] church God don't speak to me that was
[2:09:01] not a good
[2:09:02] service the service is good when God
[2:09:05] speaks on my
[2:09:07] case maybe it was good for you God spoke
[2:09:11] to your case for it to be good for me
[2:09:13] you got to speak to my case am
[2:09:16] amen that's how it ought to be
[2:09:20] you must be you must have the right
[2:09:22] motive amen amen I don't come to church
[2:09:26] because only I can get healed there no
[2:09:29] no what if God doesn't heal you do I you
[2:09:32] abandon him then no
[2:09:35] no even if he doesn't heal me I'll say
[2:09:39] devil I'll say
[2:09:41] devil I love the Lord I'll continue to
[2:09:44] serve
[2:09:46] him even if I'm hungry I
[2:09:52] pray like the three Hebrew boys they
[2:09:55] told the king even if he doesn't come
[2:09:58] for
[2:10:00] us we still won't bow because the word
[2:10:05] says I only
[2:10:07] bow before almighty
[2:10:11] God he is the only one worthy to be
[2:10:14] worship that's the only one I worship
[2:10:17] that's the only one I elevate
[2:10:19] that's the only when I sing to because
[2:10:21] he's my Creator he created me for that
[2:10:24] and I will not worship the
[2:10:26] devil Christians must have
[2:10:30] conviction you must have
[2:10:33] conviction you can't serve god without
[2:10:35] conviction you must show God you believe
[2:10:39] and you believe it 100% no matter what
[2:10:41] and no matter what
[2:10:43] situation I am am on the road with God
[2:10:46] by myself friends forsake you your
[2:10:49] husband forsakes you your wife forsakes
[2:10:51] you I will still keep
[2:10:54] moving I will still serve the Lord amen
[2:10:59] the voice said Don't
[2:11:02] Stop The Voice told lot don't look back
[2:11:06] the wife want to look back her business
[2:11:10] brother BR says you
[2:11:13] know the reason why Lot's wife perished
[2:11:17] because because she
[2:11:21] doubted she
[2:11:23] doubted when lot told her an angel
[2:11:28] visited me the wife didn't believe in
[2:11:30] him that's why keep
[2:11:34] moving
[2:11:35] nothing nothing nothing nothing should
[2:11:40] not separate us from the love of God
[2:11:43] amen
[2:11:45] amen should it be
[2:11:47] hunger should it be
[2:11:49] persecution whatever it may
[2:11:51] be is it because they slander your name
[2:11:55] brother Bram says if you're a
[2:11:58] Christian and no one never says a bad
[2:12:00] thing about you he says go to the
[2:12:04] Altar and ask if you're one of
[2:12:07] them go ask yourself ask God if you're
[2:12:10] one of them because
[2:12:13] everyone who would live for
[2:12:16] God is subject to persecution
[2:12:19] that's why after I read the quote after
[2:12:22] I read the quote where brother
[2:12:26] says it is what is in your
[2:12:29] hand the message that he preached he the
[2:12:32] message's title is what is in your
[2:12:35] hand paragraph 51 I believe if you serve
[2:12:40] God and no one ever says a bad word
[2:12:42] about
[2:12:43] you no one ever persecutes you go to the
[2:12:47] altar and ask the Lord am I one of
[2:12:52] yours after I read that
[2:12:55] quote I don't smell
[2:12:57] nothing I don't taste
[2:12:59] nothing you want to talk
[2:13:02] talk but as long as I know in my heart I
[2:13:05] am right with the Lord keep talking I
[2:13:08] don't smell it I don't taste it I will
[2:13:12] move forward in the word amen amen may
[2:13:16] the Lord richly bless you Before I Let
[2:13:18] You
[2:13:19] Go this
[2:13:23] group Jesus puts them through tests he
[2:13:26] says if one doesn't eat my flesh and
[2:13:28] drink my
[2:13:32] blood see another another 70 number 70
[2:13:35] chosen
[2:13:37] disciples 70 +
[2:13:42] 12 if you take 70 and you divide it by
[2:13:46] 82
[2:13:48] he had
[2:13:50] 12 and he had another
[2:13:53] 70 that's 82
[2:13:57] disciples not even 20% of the church
[2:14:00] stayed after that message after one
[2:14:06] preaching did Jesus say I'm sorry let me
[2:14:09] explain what I meant let me take it back
[2:14:13] I want to keep the church together
[2:14:14] that's not what he did Brother Bram says
[2:14:19] the devil counts his the devil we God
[2:14:22] weighs
[2:14:24] his what is God doing right now he's
[2:14:27] weighing his Christian he weighs each
[2:14:33] person he's
[2:14:35] looking he just wants one
[2:14:38] person that can take him at his word and
[2:14:41] depend on him and someone he can use
[2:14:45] that's all he wants he doesn't need a
[2:14:48] group they all left he had 12
[2:14:55] left if you wanted to get married in
[2:14:57] that
[2:14:58] church if you would have took one of
[2:14:59] those 70 ministers that would have been
[2:15:01] a mixed marriage because they don't
[2:15:03] believe for
[2:15:06] real 70
[2:15:09] left you want to get
[2:15:11] married let's say you would have chose
[2:15:13] out of the 12 you chose Judas that's
[2:15:16] still a mixed marriage
[2:15:18] in the church in the
[2:15:22] message there's always three types of
[2:15:26] Believers three types of
[2:15:31] Believers I'll read a verse where Peter
[2:15:33] makes one commentary then I'll let you
[2:15:39] go after that
[2:15:41] preaching they all
[2:15:46] left
[2:15:49] John
[2:15:52] 6 verse
[2:15:57] 67 forgive me I took a bit of
[2:16:04] time John 6 verse
[2:16:10] 67
[2:16:11] Jesus said unto the 12 after the 70
[2:16:16] left will you go also go
[2:16:20] away this morning I want to remind
[2:16:24] you Jesus only wants
[2:16:28] Believers he's looking for a
[2:16:31] Believer someone who can believe him at
[2:16:32] his
[2:16:33] word and depend on him
[2:16:37] completely and forsake theirself in his
[2:16:40] hands that's all he's looking
[2:16:43] for 12
[2:16:46] left 80% of of the church
[2:16:51] left this what he says
[2:16:53] here then listen to what Peter
[2:16:56] says Simon Peter answered him
[2:17:01] Lord to whom shall we
[2:17:06] go did Peter understand what Jesus said
[2:17:10] either no
[2:17:12] no but there is one thing that Peter
[2:17:17] realized
[2:17:18] if I leave Jesus I
[2:17:21] die it's
[2:17:24] over that's the Revelation that he
[2:17:27] had the one in front of him the person
[2:17:29] in front of him that is the one with
[2:17:32] eternal life let me tell you this
[2:17:35] morning there is no
[2:17:38] Life Baptist Pentecostals
[2:17:43] Catholic even if you say a message
[2:17:46] Church there is life in Jesus
[2:17:50] Christ even if you sit
[2:17:53] here you can sit here and only have a
[2:17:55] religious spirit no when you're here
[2:17:59] it's good to be here but while you're
[2:18:02] here you must meet the man Jesus
[2:18:07] Christ meet the man Jesus Christ he
[2:18:16] says
[2:18:18] he says we in verse 69 We
[2:18:21] Believe listen we
[2:18:28] believe and are sure that thou art that
[2:18:33] Christ when a Jew they know when they
[2:18:36] say the Son of God the
[2:18:39] Messiah the
[2:18:41] Christ the only thing they
[2:18:44] knew is that that was a promise from God
[2:18:48] that he would come himself in the
[2:18:54] flesh so that's why when they accuse you
[2:18:56] they say you said you are the Son of
[2:18:58] God so you said you're the Son of
[2:19:01] God that may that means you're saying
[2:19:03] that you are equal to
[2:19:05] God they knew that God would be the
[2:19:08] Messiah
[2:19:09] himself and Peter had that
[2:19:11] Revelation he says this man in front of
[2:19:13] me right now if I leave him I will die
[2:19:17] that's right that is a True
[2:19:20] Believer that's all God is looking for
[2:19:23] someone who can believe no matter the
[2:19:26] circumstance that's why
[2:19:32] faith it will jump over anything evil
[2:19:34] someone would do to
[2:19:37] you because you're looking for
[2:19:41] something this
[2:19:43] morning weigh the
[2:19:46] Rapture and weigh your pride and make a
[2:19:49] choice between the two may Jesus Christ
[2:19:52] richly bless
[2:19:53] you may the Lord deliver
[2:19:55] you from all vices from all
[2:19:59] demons sicknesses of the soul and
[2:20:03] sicknesses of the Flesh in Jesus Christ
[2:20:05] name we condemn them we condemn them all
[2:20:09] in Jesus name and be free in Jesus
[2:20:14] name keep believing the voice of God for
[2:20:19] this
[2:20:20] hour keep believing the voice of God for
[2:20:25] this
[2:20:26] hour don't just watch the signs believe
[2:20:29] the message with all the doctrine may
[2:20:32] Jesus Christ richly bless
[2:20:41] you
[2:20:46] glory
[2:20:50] we thank the Lord for the word of the
[2:20:53] Lord on today amen and um I know that
[2:20:57] brother ansy was a
[2:20:59] little uh concerned about how much time
[2:21:02] he would take today uh but sometime God
[2:21:05] gives you a word that you have to
[2:21:08] deliver uh to the people and you cannot
[2:21:11] worry about the
[2:21:12] time and uh I wanted to say that if um
[2:21:16] if you leave here today
[2:21:17] and uh you were concerned about the
[2:21:20] amount of time that uh our brother took
[2:21:22] and you begin to complain about that
[2:21:24] that put you in the group of the mixed
[2:21:27] multitude because they're the ones that
[2:21:30] complained and uh you know recently I
[2:21:33] had a chance to you know we listened to
[2:21:35] a tape um few Friday nights ago the
[2:21:39] first Friday the month and um brother
[2:21:41] Brandon made a statement on the tape he
[2:21:43] said every Revival produces twins amen
[2:21:48] and um and now uh on that tape he said
[2:21:52] the way that you can identify the twin
[2:21:55] is that they approach things from an
[2:21:57] intellectual
[2:21:59] perspective and uh and then as I was
[2:22:01] following that thought through some
[2:22:02] other sermons he said another uh way
[2:22:05] that you look at the Revival producing
[2:22:07] Twins or the twin spirits that come out
[2:22:09] of it the mixed multitude is also one of
[2:22:12] those twin spirits that comes out of a
[2:22:14] re of Revival so they have the same word
[2:22:17] that you have they have the same prophit
[2:22:20] that you have but yet when it comes to
[2:22:23] The Showdown they don't have everything
[2:22:26] that you have and it's very important
[2:22:28] that you uh you know you just hear what
[2:22:30] the Lord was really trying to say to us
[2:22:32] on today no matter no matter what I'm
[2:22:34] I'm sorry now I don't care who they are
[2:22:38] I don't care how close they are to me
[2:22:41] there's not one person on this Earth
[2:22:44] that's worth me losing my Soul
[2:22:49] amen not not one not mama daddy wife
[2:22:55] children nobody worth me losing my soul
[2:23:00] this is a one onone relationship with
[2:23:04] Jesus praise the Lord and you know as I
[2:23:07] was you know I was just so much was said
[2:23:08] here today I just appreciate brother an
[2:23:11] I re I really do I I I I'm very very
[2:23:16] grateful
[2:23:18] I'm very grateful and and and I'm glad
[2:23:21] that uh he could come here and and just
[2:23:23] preach his heart um we we believe the
[2:23:27] message that God sent us we believe the
[2:23:29] prophet that God sent us and I know that
[2:23:32] sometimes you when you you go into a
[2:23:33] church and you know and and and some get
[2:23:35] offended because we say that and we're
[2:23:37] not trying to offend it we not this not
[2:23:39] an alternative to denomination that's
[2:23:42] not what this is you know we're not just
[2:23:44] uh I used to be Baptist I used to be
[2:23:46] pentec cing I'm the message no that's
[2:23:48] not it what happened is that a
[2:23:50] restoration took place in
[2:23:53] me I told y'all last week I am the
[2:23:56] restoration a restoration took place in
[2:23:59] me and how did that happen because God
[2:24:01] said that he was going to send Elijah to
[2:24:05] turn restore the hearts of the children
[2:24:08] to their fathers and when that happened
[2:24:10] in me I
[2:24:12] became the restoration when it happened
[2:24:15] in you you became the restoration you
[2:24:18] became the very word that God promised
[2:24:21] right so so so you know we're we're not
[2:24:23] we're not ashamed this and I'm happy
[2:24:24] that the brother could come and just
[2:24:26] just lay his heart out because sometimes
[2:24:28] you know we we we I know churches that
[2:24:30] they say well we got new people so we
[2:24:32] don't quote the prophet no when are they
[2:24:36] going to ever hear about it I mean who
[2:24:38] going to tell them if if we don't tell
[2:24:41] them who going to tell them they coming

[2:27:58] God bless you God bless you God bless
[2:28:01] you well let's just bow our heads in a
[2:28:03] word of prayer amen and we'll prepare to
[2:28:06] dismiss you on today amen father we are
[2:28:09] grateful for the word of the Lord that
[2:28:12] has come to our hearts the voice that
[2:28:16] follows
[2:28:17] the
[2:28:18] signs and Lord we can look at this
[2:28:20] message that you have given us and we
[2:28:22] can see various signs Lord uh that that
[2:28:27] happened even the supernatural that
[2:28:28] would that happened but but there was a
[2:28:30] voice there was a a word spoke that we
[2:28:33] have to follow that word and God that
[2:28:36] was the thing that restored our hearts
[2:28:38] that turned our hearts back to the faith
[2:28:39] of the fathers you promis these things
[2:28:41] in scripture we're not just following
[2:28:44] something just to follow it even we look
[2:28:46] at uh the the great Army that was sent
[2:28:49] amongst us the Palmer worm the
[2:28:51] cankerworm the Locust and the
[2:28:54] caterpillar caterpillar Lord you said
[2:28:56] that you would send those uh uh uh
[2:28:59] insects amen into the midst and and the
[2:29:02] prophet was able to go in and dissect
[2:29:06] what happened spiritually so we can
[2:29:09] understand the scripture it's not just
[2:29:10] something amen random that's being
[2:29:13] spoken but something happened in the
[2:29:14] church throughout the years and and God
[2:29:18] uh you promised that when these things
[2:29:19] would occur you would restore so we
[2:29:23] thank you Father that we are a living
[2:29:25] manifestation of the restoration of the
[2:29:28] word of God that's what this message is
[2:29:30] all about it's not amen anything less
[2:29:34] it's just following the word and that's
[2:29:36] the proof that the Holy Ghost amen is
[2:29:38] present in our life that we're able to
[2:29:41] follow the word because the Bible says
[2:29:43] that when he the Holy Ghost comes he
[2:29:45] will lead us and guide us into all truth
[2:29:50] hallelujah if we can't receive truth
[2:29:52] then we can't say that we receive the
[2:29:53] Holy Ghost so Lord we thank you Father
[2:29:56] that we were able to accept truth and
[2:29:58] and Lord just Rejoice over that has been
[2:30:00] given to us I pray that you would
[2:30:02] continue to bless brother ancy Lord his
[2:30:04] ministry amen his family we thank you
[2:30:07] for him sacrificing and coming Lord just

[2:30:12] believe you had everyone here amen that
[2:30:14] needed to be here those that heard it
[2:30:16] online I pray to be strength amen and
[2:30:18] and and and Lord vitamin to the soul oh
[2:30:21] God that they would they would realize
[2:30:23] amen we got to self-examine ourselves
[2:30:25] and realize Lord what type of believer
[2:30:28] are we amen We Want To Be True Believers
[2:30:32] staying with the word no matter what the
[2:30:34] the the majority is saying we want to
[2:30:36] stay with what the word is saying Lord
