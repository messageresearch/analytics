you're just actually father that you just saw just give us strengthen the bodies tonight don't be a weak service a lot of times it's difficult and you're just going all day long and sometimes 7:30 is the first few minutes you have to really sit down but we just ask that you just said a special anointing anoint me O God I just kind of just been going all day long but we hear the fellowship around the Word of God and we ask that you ignored us and the nor the heroes of the word in Jesus name let's get our Bibles out tonight it's good to be here tonight just remember brother jacking in prayer man you're gonna join himself over in Israel just grab a hold to his coat tear one of these days and I'm going along with him second Corinthians chapter 11 but just remember him and press just a whole lot going on in the world today and traveling abroad talking about a guest Jack have this idea about doing things go to tap or there go you know and their leader resting everybody who want to do it I feel the same way sometime but I still want it going look it overseas but I pick and choose you know I know missionary that straight right quick I'm not going back in the jungles and all of that you got to be built for that I'm to Americanize to culture but we appreciate him Lord just remember exact second Corinthians chapter 11 we want to start at the first few verses there now y'all just gonna have to bear with me it says would to God ye could bear with me a little and my father and indeed bear with me says for I'm jealous over you with godly jealousy before I have exposed you to one husband that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ but I feel this by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through subtlety so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ for if he that cometh preaches another jesus when we have not preached or if you receive another spirit which ye have not received or another gospel which you have not accepted you might well bear with him I'm gonna stop right this it's a lot of reading you may be seated tonight we want to use as a little topic tonight the theater ministry as a little topic and as a maybe a subtopic the commission of the Father to present the right kind of woman now I've been I've been working with the book of second Corinthians for some months now and y'all pray fun because they can get lifted but I want to maybe for a few moments so that you can get the picture I think when it comes down to really understanding the Bible it really takes going back and really picking up the history and the whys I think my understanding has been revolutionized over the last few months this this entire year I've done something that I haven't done probably in all my years of preaching but I just felt inspired to maybe go back and just take a scriptural approach to help us to really understand the Bible and pull out different things to help us to see that this just we we know that and I'm a preacher on something tonight and this is I don't want to just necessarily look at it from a historical standpoint because one of the things I do believe that the Scriptures are irrelevant the things that were going on in the days of the Apostle Paul we can clearly see a lot of things transpiring now and I miss that right and one of the one of the things that we find in looking at the scripture maybe in the previous few chapters um one of the issues that Paul had was that were influences outside influence clergy related that were trying to influence the church about Paul's ministry and and a priest a priest a lot of stuff on this line and one of the things that I did preach was spiritual warfare leadership a lot of times I think people misunderstand leadership when it came down to Paul's Apostleship it was harshly harshly criticized and I made a statement to it to the church at home and I are kind of preached on these lies that brother Remy on Sunday I think you should not judge anything haphazardly I think sometimes we we judge things that we know very little of and about and especially especially when it comes down to to to ministry a lot of times we we judge ministers and week we judge pastors we we just the different offices real harshly but I think a lot of times the the approach is intellectual and not spiritual a lot of times you know I don't that try not to fight with folks over things but a lot of times and I realized that people are taking a intellectual approach and feelings and I feel and you know the Prophet preached the message for us not to lean to our own understanding but but I think a lot of times we link to our own understanding and we totally totally miss God we met you miss God when you lean to your own understanding and and one of the things they they were they had this thing where it were Paul at one point Paul they had an issue put it this way you know how he is you know how Foca they had issues with the past about all kinds of stuff issues with the ministry I don't like how he look I don't like I don't like he always got something going on but one of the issues were was the fact that Paul when Paul was with them Paul he operated a little what they thought was timid and and humble and things of that nature but then when when Paul wasn't with them it seems like his writings right his writings to the church was harsh was was worded strong and and one of the things I was telling my church you know I was saying that you you know people say well be direct be straightforward but then when you're directing you straightforward people can really handle it right I wanna priest weeping tonight right people say give it give it to me straight but then when you give it to them straight they've been out of shape huh see and when people people don't realize you know if you really look at Paul's ministry the thing that they were missing was the fact that Paul was being led by God right because you don't want anything I don't like all up in my faces right I you know all right you know you want people to have tact I've been I've been working this week with a guy started for Monday to the day where I almost quit every day old fella and and he just kind of been getting under my skin it's like whew why don't he know I'm 55 I mean just the way that he he'd been you know just talk to me talk to me and I hang on you know he this and and it's like and then I got a I got a Jamaican guy working then he he have to catch them is like oh Jesus I'm being tried I'm being tried you know it's like man but you know it just really shows you something the church should have really been able to appreciate Paul's approach because what Paul's concerned mostly was about them realistically pause entire ministry if we look at Redemption was really trying to get them in a place in a position to line them up right i'ma say this and I pray be they don't really hurt your feelings I've really come to a place after 20-some years and sometimes we take it for granted we think because people have been in the church 20 or 30 years they understand they do not and sometimes we might think because people have been in been in the church and around the you know the message of the hour that their spiritual and their mature if they're not I'm realizing that more and more as we we get closer to the rapture right the the light is shining and explosive things that you realize wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute the seem like we're going backwards instead of all right but Paul they date harshly justice ministry with no real you shouldn't judge anything unless you fully understand it - its - if that's a word with Rebecca and I had to watch that stuff with Rebecca Uncle Willie what was that word y'all ought to know I ain't graduated from high school so it felt good coming now then I said the smallest detail but but watch this if you're looking at something from the mind of God you'll get yourself to a place where we won't judge it unless we're judging it on the world we judge a lot of things in the flesh right I'll tell you I'm human I look at things sometimes and and you know we we get so caught up in the flesh and God it's like wait a minute what you're doing you're supposed to be able to adopt this son you're supposed to be a mature son you're supposed to be writing the checks right but but look at your approach look at how you comment and what you comment now gonna have to get on brother Jack he invited me but I'm not saying this I'm not I'm not here to beat beat me harsh anything that's just where I am I'm preach this full five time right if you can't with just things we'll see they were judging Paul because of outside influences right be careful in this hour who's feeding you be careful of whose table that you eaten from right come on because because the devil still the devil right and people might be alright but people might be anointed right just took just so see right but let me Clemmy move on how much time I got at least 45 minutes Paul says here I work to God that you would bear with me a little in my folly and indeed bear with me and and and in so many words and studying the the commentaries on the scriptures and everything that I could find it's right be patient in so many words he said you know I hate to even and you'll get into the twelfth chapter a little bit in some instances he's sarcastic like it's sad that I have to be here trying to explain to the people that I brought to the message of the hour my my ability look if you really start to look at the the Corinthians right he said power all apostle of Jesus Christ call the things that like that's just not writings this is this is a man in the defense of his calling and then one thing about it I learn mr. state me say you cannot be what you're not hmm you know no matter from the outside looking in no matter how much you might look at brother Jack and say well well you know what uh I can faster if God has an ordained for you from the foundation of the world to be a pastor you'll never be able to accomplish it you won't be able to do it you accept that you won't be able to do it properly I'm Jason it's difficult to manage people huh I'm gonna say that again it's difficult to manage people but because you know we got a different upbringing as our different thought patterns are we're all different and and then you you have one one objective in one goal and you're looking at the people and the people looking at you and the people look at you so he picking on me then he go again why he'd have to say that why he had to say it like that right and he's looking like Lord I need just I need inspiration I need your leadership one thing I could say over 20-some years 20 years now of working with a group of people I'm totally trusted in the leadership of the Holy Spirit right I'm not perfect God is the word is and my whole objective has been to point the people to the Word of God see let me bring us 2017 a lot of people look at the promise ministry and grossly misunderstanding right not not realizing what his ministry just like Paul what's the point to people back to the Bible back to God right because like the Corinthians the Corinthians had drifted right God sins Malachi form the scene because the people had drifted right the people the people no longer resembled the APUs time trying to I said the original life we're gonna strike it tonight huh see the doctor God was working in the star masterpiece see wait wait I don't know about folk I don't know about folk anymore but but I believe that we needed Malachi 4 if that we're realistic and we're not in the flesh and in God is giving a spiritual insight you could look at you this has nothing to do with people cuz we get caught up on people there's good people might make a statement I'm gonna make a real strong statement here big because I know that people do not understand we just talk people don't realize good people died in the days of Noah y'all gonna come talk with me see I hear people talking I just get y'all get you're missing the entire picture you're missing God we know God God is long-suffering in because he is in this age but what we better realize you look at dated and quarter when they got away from the word when they got out of source and they started coming against God serving up what God did open up the earth and swallowed up people see weekly sometimes we think the God is and he is this great loving God but God is a God of judgment you right look at look at the days of life right look at the days of life when the two angels went down the side and that's hold like to come hither because we can't do that to you come on Oh blacks wedlock they had to drag that drag you out I and his wife got to looking back turned into a pillar of salt right look look what happened it would good folk right and in in the midst in the midst of in the midst of a bunch of bad folk that was some good folks but some of those good folks when it came down to the light of the day they missed it days of days of Noah everybody ain't bad but that sometimes that's our concept they go to church and they good people don't doubt it don't doubt it but see God has called us to positionally place us amen in the body right amen not saying that you know everybody in denomination is only way to hell right cuz when it comes down to eternal life and and and rapture things of that nature that's all been predetermined by God before we haven't even got here right see you just got to know where you stand your your place in scripture see but sometimes folks try to worry about other folks place in scripture and don't even know what their own place in scripture right see the hardest thing the hardest thing outline even at home a lot of times is you know they they get me brother Smalley you know that get people because you know we got good friends and all that hey listen I'm not gonna put the people in Hell right but in every age they had to hear from the spirit of that day right he that has an ear let him hear what everybody's not gonna everybody's not going in the rapture everybody's not in the body but everybody is not in the body they start going to the rocks ain't going the hell let me move on somebody say move on brothers yeah you gotta take a text so net right look what Paul was like let me move from there now watch he says I remember our texting like the fear of the ministry right and the Commission of the of the Father to present the right kind of woman right now not here he says for I am jealous over you now this jealousy that he's speaking of is it's not carnal jealousy right - see that's an effect of human jealousy in its negative right humanistic and pilots not dealing with anything calm anything natural but it's all spiritual right but you human negativity is is negative the results of it is all negative but but godly jealousy watch this is is a concern for holiness integrity purity of ethics and the whole of the Christian standards right and that's the thing that sometimes laypeople miss right relevant jack just I tell you what he did we just can do nothing but you got to understand godly jealousy right golly jealousy the concern for holiness see cuz without you will see the Lord integrity purity of ethics which this world has done right in the whole of Christian standards see if that wasn't a man that that stood for something could you imagine the condition of spirit and truth and Bible true tabernacle the we could look back in some of the oldest a system arose and some of them system Brown them that kind of group came up you know looking at I could mother burns Church foot for instance many further living when he was a little boy right Pentecost um but that was a time where it was just pure holiness integrity and everything else but but look what happened when the standard was was dropped but when one person one person came through the trust with Larry King huh one person came through the church when Larry Cain probably was a prominent person in the church huh and look what happened over time see and God trying to move a church you know into the head but then somebody anointed that comes in with Mary Kay and in a ministry I'm telling you it's hard to manage people huh me because something uses this time well you know I'm telling you something no matter whether it's your children whether it's your spouse it's hard to manage people it's hard to keep a a word standard because there's so many impulses it was influences in the days of power right it was influences I wish I could get to it tonight it was it was seducing clergy spirits in the days of Paul that were it through us in the church and sometimes and sometimes you know they call to it sometimes they parking lot and sometimes they work out women preacher hat song but you know it's all the same especially in the days that we're living in about to say move on brother smother now I've got a lot now my mom I got a whole lot here I'm loaded now this tablet fool hmm but so so that what what is Paul trying to do powerless trying to get them to see his position and what his concern is and what he's actually trying to do that's the hardest thing to get people to see we we have an objective we have something that we are looking at based upon the word of God and sometimes you got to be patient because people people sometimes just don't see it and I learned that hey you know I change that I try that doctor yeah I have to really be patient right because you don't want to damage the people sometimes people get spiritual amnesia it's just a whole lot that goes along with it right and you want to be long-suffering with people because sometimes God is long-suffering with you see I'll tell you man I can't flip the script because I know that God is long-suffering with me now I'ma preach with me see you see how sometime we was short with sharp at the preacher we shot with our children with you with this short and I realized and what if God was just short somebody said move on brother smiley huh we've got to have we've got to have have patience right but he said I'm jealous over you with Garland Jeff jealousy for once he says for I have espoused you to one husband right what hit you cannot serve God and Mammon at the same time right yeah you know what church we went we're right ever we're right at a place where you gotta make a choice right everybody's given a choice we choose the church and the children of a ride he choose to church you choose the man you choose the woman it's all about a choice you but you gotta make a choice right young people gotta make a choice huh see look what do you thing one of the things that spanked me that I used at church all the time you've got to come down from right away you've gotta find God to provide it with you know that would seem like well don't look like God's doing nothing don't look like let happen in this age of what happened to all the young people who look like you Oh preachers y'all missing a boat ain't one of those I'm not one of those I'm clear in my understanding huh people just gotta make a choice right who you've got to be married to it's a choice see you can't force people to serve God younger olá in between we got all these all kind of little spirits going on on around on the right around the message now huh everybody rising up young preachers and young folks with all kind of nonsense let me tell you something you've gotta find God for body weight right okay something's really powerful no matter what you do right what you do what you say you can't come that God call you that's scary to think about if we scripturally look at this age scripturally the days of noah look how few went in the ark out of literally million see all of these things you know people got to keep in keep in mind the old folks the old folks and the old preachers and the old shows they missing it no you just got to find out what God provided way is you got to come the same way right that everybody else through the Bible came make a choice I'm gonna live for God period i'ma live for God period if I fall I'm gonna get back up because I'm a righteous man of a righteous man follow a lot of times a righteous man now we talk about us in weeks we talk about a righteous man what by 70 times or something like that huh but they got back up again because they righteous see but you gotta make a choice I don't care you're young old eighty years old you got to make a choice right my resolve is that i'ma live for God we got regardless of facebook in this book in that book you know what I just saw I told some no I got so sick of Facebook so I got off it I deleted my page now y'all gonna have to go delete your page I'm telling you dad this ain't no delete your page doctrine I'm talking about me I just got so sick of it I just said you know what and then so I don't know what what's going on what everybody said I I just got off it I just got off it I'm I took my journal on she was like you did I can't I will work I put into my days and this is that I got it all right guys you keep yours I got all finger I'm not sick you know I'd be this close to blasting people I'm tell me when I read something I'll be like boy I'll tell you what lord help us help me bleed he's us I'll just be and I said I ain't going to help nobody can take oh say brunch valiant roll controlling people page and all I say you know imma just get off it so know what these people doing so so so I could have a Liberty that when I go anywhere and preach I don't know if you're posting what you're doing if the Holy Spirit leave me I'm just just gonna say it and it's gonna be up to you alright let me move on moving but he espoused them to one hand right you gotta make a choice you can't love to mean at the same time it's totally you cannot do it you can't love two people not correctly but I love to you deceive you D help you can't do it it's impossible to privacy right hey man if we could make you know what I told my church I said if if we could get people to make a choice right I say you know cuz I can't help nobody younger old until they make a decision to serve God and from that point I can work with them to bring them to a place of perfection other than other than no matter how much emotions you know we don't we don't did the emotional thing but for 20 years right and I I'm not against emotions up that's wonderful but I realized if you scripturally look at the damn penny crops right Peter preached and the other brothers stood up and Amen the word the the per it was the preaching of the gospel come on it was the preaching of the gospel that prick the heart of the people huh and they said you know meaning brother what must we be saying they was willing to make a choice they heard something that they identify with that they have greet with men and brethren what must we do to a man be sane right come on that has not changed it still takes the preaching of the gospel how can you hear less a preacher preach he got to be sin see how this other stuff is nonsense you got it because because if we don't approach it this way then what we saying is that we're smarter than God come on come on come on when God set the standard when there was nobody but for God to communicate with God set the standard it's God's program God's plan God's a you if you follow it amen you you know it's almost like following a yellow brick road you get back to Kansas you'll find your way back but what if you deviate from the plan of God's plan see it can't be you're planning your thoughts and all of this stuff and your pillow well if we will do it it will not work it really won't work if I implement anything outside of a goddess implement it will not work right God will have to reject him cuz I say what smiley you were smarter than me your plan was was a hole it don't work right there if if from from point eight from the bad Pentecost when they came out they preach souls were printed came in and really receive something right see a lot of time people be screaming and hollering and rolling around down then when they get a copy me I did I mean my first experiences it you know before I came to Florida I had some experiences know I was in Florida it's right I was a foot well I had different places but I was in Florida I remember what they had me in pretty this is come on baby come on come on come on come on him geez I'm a slob cause y'all telling me to sky but when I got up I went straight back to the corner and got a deal that's right but I came to a point where I made a decision right I say Lord you know what you'll do something for me today I don't like John Ranas I'm one of them guy whoever that was you saying you don't do stuff for me right there you go come back you'll find my balls in the field you see people just saying desperate enough cuz cuz when you hit desperate desperation moves God move God on the scene but I can't people be playing see they think they come to church thing and that's why they stopped coming because they come in and the word they become condemned they be condemned right beat me because they they know better so they say when we went with we right but the problem is the image I'm gonna keep moving how much time I got Troy I got about 30 more minutes what's how about that close don't tell me that tonight now I'm not home so I feel a little freedom on Sunday I had an interpreter that I ain't got no interpreter sir well but he says why I'm jealous over you I have exposed you to one husband that I made now let me let me read this and then we come in I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ right Wow what what inspiration see you said what I was trying to do Paul is trying to really get them to see and understand what his ministry entails what he's actually doing right something that parle is looking back to I was I was telling the church and then I was thinking about the scripture there in in Genesis just dealing with a version and and I was telling them you look at Eloisa right see you you can't break you cannot break the theme of the Bible when you go back to go back let that watch Redemption Redemption takes us all the way back to the beginning right and what we find if we go back to the G to Genesis the first first church right what God gave his son was a version right she played the part of a harlot but what but what God presented to Adam was pill was perfection right that's what God presented that thing can't change that thing can change I'm getting this up in a second that thing cannot change Paul Paul white Paul Paul's looking back to Genesis right then he picks up he picks up Eloisa right could you see the responsive bit I don't realize this and people want to be preachers you want to be discipline you don't really realize the responsibility that goes along with me that's a real serious responsibility you've gotta have to give up our real true ministry ain't about being popular because a lot of times you aren't popular right it went with Abraham called Eloisa and told him to go get a bride for his son Isaac could you imagine the pressure go back and redo the press sure the elegies was up under like whoa this is a big task this is a big task it's like because I can't bring I cannot present right what will be I cannot present to my master son anything outside of a version outside of what is pill outside of what is hopeful huh because it deals with character right look at the fella who was looking for a little bride right rich man the rich man's son went to the culture all right and what was he looking for what was wholesome what was peeled coz what was his Chicago was horrible y'all don't talk to me now I see how easily that he could not present to Abraham son a horse something that something that was already tampered with in touch it had to be clear it had to be a version and you see the responsibility is like old man like oh god this is pressure Abraham told him look let me tell you something but you know it's good that they get follow the instruction well all right I guess because kids don't want to follow the father he he's old fogey he'll understand and he didn't need that we'll leave that alone somebody say boom oh brother fire I took responsibility that he had maybe he'll say listen don't you go to the streets don't you go to the world well I go to the world and and it's uh no you go to you go amongst my people we've changed that since the brown the one that happened to folk now folks we brought to our folk used to believe that we used to you know folk used to but now we go to the world I heard it's been a good little minute ago I heard your sister grew up around a message say I don't want no message boy you want to talk huh somebody go slap that head up five or six time cause you daddy to go to jail huh what you should want somebody to love the Lord somebody's gonna treat you right I don't want no Christian boy oh mercy anybody have said but should go much my people right amen and you what but what was he looking for he was looking for character something that was hosting something that was a virgin because he can't break it can't break amen the the the types of description right it's what is it still the father went up what the father is gonna present to his son it can't be horrible right it can't be a heart right Amen didn't watch the Prophet watch the Prophet I said what's the process he picks up cuz he said people Paul preached right watch inspiration see Bible School theology don't give you this what but the thing that the prophet of God had he didn't get some theology right amen he he looked back to the beginning say man the first time God God gave his son a wife he gave her version right looks down and evening time if if my son is going to get anything it's got to be a version it's got to be untouched it's got to be pure come on come over this is why the prophet of God constantly we're trying to drop it in showing the fallacy in all of this all of this all of this all of this right see a man why trying to get us back to the world back back to the Bible back to the word not denominationalism right you can't approach God when I miss not even in the message that's a tight statement now if you approach when I'm just in the message you gonna miss it you you gotta come you gotta come down with God provided wait no that's not no strike got some revelation I hope that didn't go over your head right because some people some people have that same type of mentality and attitude but you still gotta be born again see the Prophet never took us outside of the way he brought us back to the Bible back the Pentecost right back to the word because he realized what's got to be presented the crisis got because what came look what came the thing that God gave Adam came from right amen anything that Christ is getting come from him I might take off through here I got soft shoes on tonight I'd like to take off and run right now right see what came from Christ at Calvary this smitten bride was a perfect work bride it's got to be worried on work right now ain't got a bunch of clothes up here but I know what I'm talking about now if y'all need them I got a phone and Jack got a computer but I hope y'all don't need them I hope I hope y'all got our spiritual thinking cap song right amen we could we talk about Christ and any time we're looking at Christ we're looking at perfection we're looking at purity we're looking at ethics right we're looking at Holy Week we're looking at all things good right see there's no way that Christ will ever marry a hearty come on come on there's no way that Christ ever marry a harlot something that's been manhandled test for winning touch hang on do it right chica she's got to be worried upon world upon world upon world upon word upon word brother branham crazy no gang he's a false prophet no he wasn't the man had spiritual insight huh the man that spiritual insight don't take some I couldn't couldn't have saw all of this the things that I've seen I danced but wasn't for the message of the hour amen then watch this I got 15 minutes okay so then he says I made position as they changed version to Christ but watch this he says but I fear lest by any means right as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety now watch Paul see Paul still working with Genesis look at look at inspiration look at Paul Paul looking at the church right look at brother smiling looking at the church the fear the fear of the ministry power looks Paul looks back a minute and Genesis at the first church and he see and then the serpent which was to some slavery something but but but a man well apart beast apart man closest thing was the man right that could speak that that could reason that could talk right the prophet of God said the problem that Eve had was she stopped to listen hmm amen she opened up the water her mind so you watch you watch people in this hour this stopping and then they're opening up their mind they opening up their mind that sounds reasonable that's exactly what he did but that's enough Eve the simplicity of God the perfect interpretation of the word of God as long as she went to stay with that she would have lived she would have lived but the moment she stopped she opened up the wound of her mind I go back to spoken words the reason you see right he sold the scene right look at the look at the see that he sold it when it was a seed of dead it was a hybrid seed a seed of discrepancy from from from that to the adultery and then look at the wreckage the oneness was broken the hymen in the family was broken why because she stopped huh comeback a reading right she stopped she opened up the water her man saving right subtle Paul comes on the scene safe huh I see the same thing happening here right I see it's the same spirit right that's a just anointing men in this day when I would I brought y'all the reveal word of the hour right I can't y'all the hidden mysteries things that were seeing from the foundations of the world is that what Paul said then what I got what I'm getting is that the things that's been here from the foundations of the world huh and then these anointed was right these are anointed ones they come on this scene and say well who was Paul who was Paul science fair who was Paul who is Paul I mean if in part how can power say he's something when when he look at him he got him one coke huh he got one coat he kind of work hey that's the to what time you know his buddy his buddy walked away from him Dean missing the saint that you a man of God God was here to reveal the simplicity we missed God and simplicity I'm here with the kind of ministry that you've been given the kind of revelation that you've been given even you going to the twelfth chapter second Corinthians chapter 12 where Paul was just kind of playing with in mind I was talking about how could have had something to boast but God gave him because of the abundance of revelation a messenger of Satan to buffing him to give him blow out the blow huh because of the depth of the revelation power operating upon the amen uh-uh a lion anointed a teaching anointed to rightly divide the word of doctor to the church but then those folks annoyed it was come the upon by inspiration inspiration picks him up and looking a man the Genesis right he sees the serpent he sees this the serpent amen uh-uh-uh approaching the church from an intellectual standpoint you can't reason with the devil huh look what he did at lasya that same devil after the church was established on the world right from the correct Godhead the correct order baptism I mean watch you see it the book of Acts you said they had everything in common one mind they believe the same thing but then the devil you can see in the Seventh Seal when the prophet of God he makes this statement he said what why why God kept that thing back because he said he'd Allah if he to put it out through the Angels he said the devil did a lot of damage look what the devil has done since the seals has been open look at the damage that he's done since the seals has been open so could you imagine what it would have been and he would have released those things in the first age Oh Lord we wouldn't know how to get back to God yeah he says I fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve we spiritually huh through his subtlety not right in your face right just a little like look at look at look at you know the Ephesian age right went with a little little seed a little little something that seems so in offensive this ain't gonna hurt nothing right a little little deep and that age a little bit Dean a little sin you know say that but look but look at look at the thing it was taken from it wasn't added to the church it was taken from the church right taking your position taking your place where we give it to one man I just finished in search engines or something we'll give all the the ability and anointing and everything to this just one man and and and and everybody that's kind of you know we sit we try to sit and absorb the things that he's saying and then you know we could just kind of live any kind of life we want to live you know it just seemed like it's like you see whether that's era the devil trying to take your position your place your authority to do that to do that to give all of the the power in the position to one man what that does for you where's your adoption what's your adoption where's your places where's your power huh you know I said it's in that one fella they in right there see you see the error we go back we go back 30 years right when we were up under a certain ministry well well you know all of the power and the position was given to this one man in this one-man church but then where's your power where's your position where's your place in the body and the show that it was error one year after the man goes off the scene the whole thing is in rumors huh why because it wasn't based upon the word right look at the hour that we live in in look at the subtlety of the serpent this is the thing as a ministry I fear right look keep moving keep it moving right close up the wall of your mind right so with when people say well well brother branham a Elijah and brother branham ain't this keep moving don't try to reason I'll study I'll study I'm a study let's see that's the same thing - II did watch Eve try the steady with the serpent without Adam [Applause] details imma jump through these chants huh each had to have Bible study witness Shepherd with Adam and look what happened broke the church everything don't you do it don't you do it God gave y'all ahead huh you can't you can't study with everybody you can't listening everybody just because things sound good you gotta have discernment okay some listen to some times with people you know I focus ain't some stuff that won't be sounded so good see you young people young preachers huh I'll have Bible study without the pastor okay you keep feeding on that foolishness if you want to your kidney sir don't realize is that definitely set them up see and this is what people people miss you they don't come God's provided way and when you don't come God provided way amen you you call somebody to get killed look at Daisy bar gotta go huh look at David God David had good intentions but look we consulted y'all gonna pretty sweeping that did he consult the pastor yeah because I'm the master here I said the Prophet huh I'm a I'm a consult it selects you mean the captains are so many so many what people people who vote bet you on the back but my dog my boy people that you know they're afraid to hurt your feelings or with no real true concept of the word go up David huh do it go get it go get it and bring it back huh praise God the sound of the key is in the captain get up a song shout of the king is in the cap the shine of the king the shout of the king sound of the King is in the camp huh broke the word right and instead of them fighting what the will of God is and coming God providing wait right god never process of approach the thing they

that thing start tilting a man of God made a good man got killed because of wrong inspiration see if they would have consulted Nathan Nathan with a consulting God and God would tell me go get it but remember to bring it back on the shoulders of the Levites because it's the Levites that touch the Word of God you know what just go but feeling good you're not as when Joshua was punching over into the land right God told him look you tell people whatever they do you put them preachers at first tell them standing a little bit back don't get too close let not in carnality now I believe I'm
