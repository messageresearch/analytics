[54:33] that you just come and meet every need

[54:38] I pray the Lord as I flip back the pages

[54:42] and bring bread with us the Lord and
[54:44] remove me from the scene but use this
[54:46] Temple of mine to God to minister into
[54:49] the needs and desires of your people to
[54:51] God I pray the Lord that you just make
[54:53] this word alive in our hearts father we

[54:57] work a miracle amongst Our Lives of god
[54:59] father we'll be careful to give you the

[55:03] worthy of and the bride says amen amen
[55:08] amen it's good to be in the house of the
[55:10] Lord Saints bring one another and say
[55:12] welcome into the house of the Lord amen
[55:15] just so good to be in the house of the
[55:16] Lord r
[55:29] amen can you hear me pretty good
[55:32] all right praise the Lord so good to be
[55:35] here and uh Came Here solo without my
[55:37] family they miss you all very much so
[55:39] they told me to make sure that I extend
[55:40] their greetings so uh when I went to
[55:43] greet them on their behalf so God bless
[55:45] you just certainly get to be back in the
[55:46] house of the Lord won't keep you
[55:48] standing too long turn with me to
[55:49] Ezekiel chapter 37.
[55:53] foreign
[55:59] just a little simple thought that I'd
[56:01] like to kind of I like this particular
[56:03] scripture because it's just so
[56:04] meaningful and so many nuggets that's
[56:07] embedded within there
[56:08] and so we'll just take our time and just
[56:10] let the Lord has have his way with us
[56:12] amen
[56:16] Ezekiel
[56:18] 37.
[56:21] and it reads
[56:22] the hand of the Lord was upon me and
[56:24] carried me out in the spirit of the Lord
[56:27] and set me down in the midst of the
[56:29] valley which was full of Bones
[56:31] and caused me to pass by them round
[56:34] about and behold there were very many in
[56:36] the open Valley and lo they were very
[56:38] dry
[56:39] and he said unto me son of man can these
[56:42] bones live
[56:44] now God doesn't ask a question unless he
[56:46] knows the answer
[56:49] and I answered all oh Lord God
[56:53] that's wisdom there
[56:54] he didn't try to reason with guys like
[56:56] God you know
[56:58] again he said unto me prophesy upon
[57:00] these bones and say unto them
[57:03] oily Dry Bones hear the word of the Lord
[57:06] now this is interesting right because
[57:09] you have a prophet that God is speaking
[57:12] to
[57:13] and he's telling his Prophet to speak to
[57:15] these dry bones
[57:17] that they may hear well these bones have
[57:19] no ears
[57:21] but somehow they're able to respond to
[57:24] the word of God
[57:27] thus saith the Lord verse 5 thus saith
[57:29] the Lord God unto these bones behold I
[57:32] will cause breath to enter into you and
[57:35] ye shall live
[57:38] now whenever God speaks he speaks with
[57:42] authority
[57:44] and it's affirmative
[57:46] there's no questioning when it comes to
[57:48] God's word
[57:50] he doesn't speak with the degree of
[57:52] doubt in his voice
[57:54] oftentimes we talk and we end our we end
[57:57] our sentences with a question not so
[58:00] with God
[58:02] and so this is very important because
[58:03] I'm trying to bring you I I'll
[58:05] eventually bring you to a point where
[58:07] you see yourself in the scripture
[58:10] so God says unto these bones behold I
[58:13] will cause breath to enter into you and
[58:16] you will live
[58:19] and I will lay sinews upon you and will
[58:22] bring up flesh upon you and cover you
[58:25] with skin and put breath in you and ye
[58:28] shall live and ye shall know that I am
[58:30] the Lord because no man is able to do
[58:33] this
[58:34] so I prophesied as I was commanded and I
[58:38] and as I prophesied there was a noise
[58:40] and behold a shaking
[58:42] and the bones came together bone to his
[58:45] bone
[58:46] and when I beheld low the sinews In the
[58:49] Flesh Came Upon them and the skin
[58:51] covered them above but there was no
[58:54] breath in them
[58:57] then City unto me prophesy unto the wind
[59:01] prophesy son of man and say to the wind
[59:04] thus saith the Lord God come from the
[59:06] come from the Four Winds o breath and
[59:09] breathe upon these slain
[59:12] that they may live
[59:15] so I prophesy as he commanded me
[59:20] and the breath came into them and
[59:25] they lived and stood upon their feet in
[59:29] exceedingly great Army
[59:32] then he said unto me son of man these
[59:35] bones are the whole house of Israel
[59:36] behold they say our bones are dried in
[59:40] Our Hope
[59:41] is lost
[59:43] we are cut
[59:44] off for our parts
[59:47] therefore prophesying saying to them
[59:48] thus saith the Lord God behold all my
[59:51] people I will open your Graves and cause
[59:53] you to come up out of your Graves and
[59:56] bring you into the land of Israel
[59:59] and ye shall know that I am the Lord
[1:00:01] when I have opened your Graves o my
[1:00:04] people and brought you up out of your
[1:00:06] grace
[1:00:07] and they shall and shall put my spirit
[1:00:09] in you
[1:00:11] and ye shall live
[1:00:13] and I shall place you in your own land
[1:00:16] then shall ye know that I am the Lord
[1:00:18] that I the Lord have spoken it and
[1:00:22] performed it
[1:00:23] saith the Lord
[1:00:25] may the Lord add his Blessing to the
[1:00:27] reading of the word you may be seated
[1:00:31] you know oftentimes I kind of Wonder to
[1:00:33] myself you know if I've ministered on a
[1:00:35] particular topic or not and I may
[1:00:37] but just because you had chicken last
[1:00:39] week doesn't mean that you're not you
[1:00:40] won't have chicken this week
[1:00:41] [Music]
[1:00:43] tasted good last week so I'm sure it's
[1:00:45] gonna taste good again this week as long
[1:00:47] as it has the right ingredients
[1:00:49] the right spices and everything else
[1:00:52] amen so if you heard it before you said
[1:00:54] amen don't stop saying amen now
[1:00:57] because it's still the truth God's word
[1:00:59] don't change
[1:01:01] but I love this scripture because
[1:01:04] there's so meaning that you and I can
[1:01:07] draw from when it comes to this passage
[1:01:09] of scripture and albeit it's talking to
[1:01:11] Israel as a nation but the prophet says
[1:01:13] the way God deals with Israel as a
[1:01:15] nation is the way he deals with you and
[1:01:17] I as individuals
[1:01:20] and so this message is uh is is
[1:01:24] enshrouded it's it's it's it encompasses
[1:01:27] nothing but life
[1:01:29] and it's really important for us to
[1:01:31] understand that
[1:01:32] because we find that in this lesson
[1:01:35] itself that there is a valley of dry
[1:01:37] bones and things seems like it was kind
[1:01:40] of hopeless for this uh for this nation
[1:01:43] but you know let me take you back to how
[1:01:46] the creation process began
[1:01:48] and it's just interesting how kind of
[1:01:51] things kind of play itself out
[1:01:53] in Genesis the Bible talks about how God
[1:01:55] begins his form of creation
[1:01:59] and this was all God creating
[1:02:02] and he was uh bringing his form of
[1:02:06] creation to a sort of Pinnacle and that
[1:02:10] Pinnacle was the creation of man
[1:02:13] and so God reached to the point when he
[1:02:16] lay the foundation of the earth when he
[1:02:19] created when he brought the seeds
[1:02:21] together the animals that dwelt therein
[1:02:23] and so there was one piece that was
[1:02:25] missing and God wanted that fellowship
[1:02:28] with man so he began to take a clay off
[1:02:30] the off the Earth and begin to kind of
[1:02:33] form it and the Bible talks about how in
[1:02:36] the forming and the creation process the
[1:02:38] Bible says in the Lord God formed man of
[1:02:42] the Dust of the ground
[1:02:45] and so when God's for men there was
[1:02:47] really nothing much more to man other
[1:02:49] than just thus
[1:02:51] he was just a piece of the Earth
[1:02:53] and so he was not mobile he was not
[1:02:56] there was no physical activity within
[1:02:58] him he couldn't shout the Praises of God
[1:03:00] he couldn't respond all he was was just
[1:03:03] a clay object it's like having a car but
[1:03:05] no no spark it's not like having a car
[1:03:07] with a full tank of gasoline but there's
[1:03:09] no spark it's no good to you
[1:03:12] and so God the Bible says and God
[1:03:15] breathed into his nostrils the breath of
[1:03:19] life and then the Bible says that men
[1:03:22] became a living soul
[1:03:25] and so as a result of that he was no
[1:03:28] longer just an object that just comes
[1:03:31] and just uh assume a position he's now
[1:03:34] an object that could respond to his
[1:03:36] creator
[1:03:37] he's now an individual that could
[1:03:39] respond to that creep that which created
[1:03:42] him and so he became a living soul but
[1:03:45] the only way that he became a living
[1:03:47] Soul was because God breathed into his
[1:03:50] nostrils the breath of life and the
[1:03:52] Bible says men became a living soul
[1:03:57] and the reason why that's important is
[1:03:59] because there's something to be said
[1:04:00] about the words of God that when God
[1:04:03] speak it breathes life to an individual
[1:04:07] it breathes life into a situation it
[1:04:10] breathes life into a circumstance
[1:04:13] Jesus said the words that I speak to you
[1:04:16] they are Spirit in their life
[1:04:20] now we're we're The Offspring of God and
[1:04:24] so we ought to be very careful how we
[1:04:26] use our words because the same words
[1:04:28] that Jesus used we can use the same
[1:04:30] words and we could bring spirit and Life
[1:04:32] to someone
[1:04:33] amen all right that's the reason why the
[1:04:36] Bible says be quick to listen and slow
[1:04:38] to speak because in your lips as the
[1:04:41] power of life and death
[1:04:43] you can say something unknowingly
[1:04:45] careless about what you're saying and
[1:04:47] bring death to someone not realizing
[1:04:49] what you've done but in the same vein
[1:04:51] you can say something not even realizing
[1:04:53] what you said and be uplifting to
[1:04:55] someone that's the reason why we should
[1:04:57] be very guarded about what we say not
[1:04:59] only around the world but what we say to
[1:05:01] one another
[1:05:03] because in your lips holds the power of
[1:05:06] life and also the power of death
[1:05:10] you could go home right now and in any
[1:05:12] demonic Spirit that's inhabiting the
[1:05:15] home you have authority in your words to
[1:05:18] speak life into your home
[1:05:21] because God has equipped you with the
[1:05:23] same power to speak life or to speak
[1:05:26] that
[1:05:28] you could be troubled in your job I
[1:05:30] declare unto you Monday morning go to
[1:05:32] your word and put your feet down and say
[1:05:34] hi I speak in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:05:37] Christ and every demon in Hell
[1:05:39] ought to come into subjection
[1:05:46] the words that we speak
[1:05:49] have power
[1:05:51] it could bring life to someone you don't
[1:05:54] know what people are going through
[1:05:55] Saints
[1:05:57] they can be straggling here and there
[1:05:58] Holding On by a thread and one word you
[1:06:02] say could either Make It or Break It
[1:06:05] that's the reason why we as Sons and
[1:06:07] Daughters of God always ought to be
[1:06:09] positive edifying someone lifting their
[1:06:12] spirits up
[1:06:17] Elisha was in a situation
[1:06:21] well he blessed this woman that didn't
[1:06:23] have a child
[1:06:25] and as a boy grew up he was in the field
[1:06:28] with his father
[1:06:29] and he complained about his head
[1:06:32] and the father told one of the servants
[1:06:34] to bring him to his mom and there he
[1:06:35] died
[1:06:38] and the mom runs to Elisha
[1:06:42] and Elisha looked at her as she was
[1:06:44] making her way to him
[1:06:46] he said it's all well with you she said
[1:06:49] all is well
[1:06:52] it's all wrong with the household all is
[1:06:55] well
[1:06:56] let me tell you say she had a dead boy
[1:06:58] and a home but when the prophet of God
[1:07:00] said is all wrong with your son her
[1:07:03] testimony was all is well
[1:07:06] [Applause]
[1:07:07] the devil will bring disruption in your
[1:07:10] life but there's no reason for you to
[1:07:12] pout and to have a pity party you ought
[1:07:15] to have a testimony that despite the
[1:07:17] fact All Is Well with My Soul
[1:07:22] no matter how difficult situations get
[1:07:25] and it's gonna get worse
[1:07:27] but I live I worship a living God I
[1:07:31] worship a resurrected God I worship with
[1:07:34] Savior King that when I speak he listens
[1:07:38] I could declare and not imagine that
[1:07:41] when I say those words all is well
[1:07:43] [Applause]
[1:07:45] [Music]
[1:07:47] don't let the devil rob you of your
[1:07:49] testimony
[1:07:50] you don't judge how you are but how you
[1:07:52] feel in the body you judge how you are
[1:07:55] by your promise of God yes
[1:07:57] man
[1:08:04] the mother was still with Elisha
[1:08:06] she explained the situation
[1:08:09] and Elisha says look I'm gonna send my
[1:08:11] service he's like you can send the
[1:08:12] servant but I'm gonna need you to come
[1:08:13] with me
[1:08:16] there's a thought that I'm working on
[1:08:18] called the force of a mother
[1:08:20] written throughout the scriptures
[1:08:23] the Unstoppable force of a mother
[1:08:27] he says he's like you could go kahasa
[1:08:30] could go but I need you to come with me
[1:08:33] Elisha fell the Blige
[1:08:36] and went back to the home
[1:08:37] close the doors
[1:08:39] removed any doubt any disbelief come on
[1:08:43] somebody
[1:08:44] people might look at you like you're
[1:08:46] crazy remove every doubt
[1:08:48] remove every disbelief you're not here
[1:08:51] to impress one another you hear it to
[1:08:54] him believe in the word of God
[1:08:59] I don't know man no explanation my life
[1:09:02] is predicated on what God has done for
[1:09:04] me
[1:09:08] he shut the door behind him
[1:09:11] he's put everybody away
[1:09:14] they're the corpse laid
[1:09:16] emotionless
[1:09:20] not a heartbeat
[1:09:22] nothing
[1:09:24] people would have ridden It Off
[1:09:28] but when God comes on the scene Saints
[1:09:32] when God is on the scene
[1:09:35] he looked at the situation
[1:09:37] there's nothing too too impossible for
[1:09:40] God
[1:09:41] too difficult
[1:09:43] to observe two two two two unreasonable
[1:09:48] just believe in the word of God
[1:09:52] it was Elisha and the boy
[1:09:55] and there
[1:09:57] the Bible talks about how
[1:09:59] he stretched himself over the boy
[1:10:04] if someone would have Peak then that
[1:10:05] would have looked unorthodox
[1:10:07] that would have looked weird
[1:10:10] that would have looked unnatural
[1:10:13] yeah but God is not here to show you
[1:10:15] what's he doesn't go with the way the
[1:10:18] world goes he doesn't do the things the
[1:10:20] world does he stretched himself the
[1:10:22] Bible says eyes with his eyes nose with
[1:10:24] his nose moths with his mouth hands with
[1:10:26] his hands
[1:10:27] and the Bible says the boy his body his
[1:10:30] chorus began to wax warm
[1:10:33] that life was pulsating
[1:10:36] from the prophet unto the boy
[1:10:38] [Music]
[1:10:40] and no doubt Elijah must have offered a
[1:10:42] word of Prayer
[1:10:43] under the word of prayer too
[1:10:46] and called upon the name of Jehovah
[1:10:49] and the boys in the Bible says that the
[1:10:51] boys needs seven times
[1:10:56] seven times
[1:10:58] and the Bible says his eyes were open
[1:11:03] this defies the laws of a physician
[1:11:07] who wrote the death certificate
[1:11:10] just because you got papers on it
[1:11:11] doesn't mean that God agrees with it
[1:11:15] I can't tell you how many times I've
[1:11:18] gone to the doctor and they've looked at
[1:11:20] this document they've looked at this
[1:11:22] paperwork they've done this analysis I
[1:11:24] don't care how good your machine is if
[1:11:27] God doesn't agree with it then I don't
[1:11:29] accept it
[1:11:33] you don't have to agree with everything
[1:11:35] the devil tells you
[1:11:36] [Applause]
[1:11:38] must remember Gene I feel a certain way
[1:11:40] but that's not the way God tells you
[1:11:44] amen
[1:11:48] life was ushered in
[1:11:51] under that Elisha Ministry
[1:11:54] you know
[1:11:56] as I think about the concept of life
[1:11:59] and how God breathed
[1:12:02] life into man hi Elisha brought life
[1:12:07] the Bible talks about and bear with me
[1:12:09] Saints the Bible talks about in
[1:12:11] Ephesians
[1:12:13] the Bible says you hath he quickened
[1:12:20] and you have to quickened
[1:12:23] who were dead in trespasses
[1:12:29] you were dead and trespasses and sin
[1:12:34] the moment you were born
[1:12:36] you came into this world speaking lies
[1:12:40] the odds were stacked against you
[1:12:43] there was no likelihood that you would
[1:12:46] be sitting here this morning
[1:12:48] when people look at your history you did
[1:12:51] not have the resume of being a child of
[1:12:53] God
[1:12:55] you did not have the resemblance of
[1:12:57] being the child of God
[1:12:59] you shun every churches you slept in the
[1:13:03] church you heard one thing and then when
[1:13:05] when and went on one year it came out
[1:13:07] the other you barely responded to the
[1:13:10] Gospel of Truth oh my you had nothing to
[1:13:13] do with God but God had everything to do
[1:13:15] with you
[1:13:16] because God is not going to lose out on
[1:13:19] his investment I heard the brother pray
[1:13:21] that we came to church that business
[1:13:23] with god well God's a businessman and
[1:13:25] he's invested in you and God is not
[1:13:27] going to lose out on his investment
[1:13:31] you are too valuable for God
[1:13:36] you were dead in sin
[1:13:39] we were in time past
[1:13:42] walked according to the courts of this
[1:13:44] world
[1:13:45] that was our ways
[1:13:48] we acted like the world
[1:13:51] we did things like the world there was
[1:13:53] no differentiation between you and how
[1:13:55] the world acted you and how the world
[1:13:57] looked like you and how the world behave
[1:14:00] the language was the same let me tell
[1:14:01] you the moment someone begins to
[1:14:03] backslid I could tell the reason why the
[1:14:05] language start to change
[1:14:07] the language starts to change
[1:14:09] think about the moment that Adam felt
[1:14:12] the very first thing the very first
[1:14:14] thing he said was that we heard you but
[1:14:17] we was afraid
[1:14:19] God never taught them that
[1:14:21] what did that word free come from where
[1:14:24] did you get that in the language
[1:14:26] all right
[1:14:27] right
[1:14:29] you watched someone before it's like are
[1:14:31] you gonna make it in the Rapture praise
[1:14:33] the Lord
[1:14:34] speak with such confidence and boldness
[1:14:37] are you a child of God Amen I'm 100
[1:14:39] child of God the moment they start
[1:14:42] skipping around and missing out on
[1:14:44] church a little bit and start
[1:14:45] bacheloring a little bit asking the same
[1:14:46] question and now the response is a
[1:14:49] little bit different God knows all
[1:14:50] things
[1:14:52] what happened to the confidence what
[1:14:55] happened to the boldness
[1:14:57] oh God knows all things
[1:15:00] something's wrong right there
[1:15:03] in the face of the enemy you got to
[1:15:06] uphold your testimony
[1:15:08] don't judge us you're gonna make it on
[1:15:10] the Rapture how you feel one day and how
[1:15:12] you feel the next judge how you're gonna
[1:15:14] make it based on the promises that God
[1:15:17] has given to you
[1:15:18] [Music]
[1:15:21] I remember I became a a steadfast
[1:15:24] Christian and I was always relying on
[1:15:26] the elders to kind of make sure that my
[1:15:27] faith was in check
[1:15:30] back in the day we didn't have cell
[1:15:31] phones
[1:15:32] so when you call somebody and you
[1:15:34] couldn't get a hold of them naturally
[1:15:35] for me I was thinking that I don't miss
[1:15:37] the rapture
[1:15:40] so I called brother so-and-so and they
[1:15:42] wouldn't pick up oh I was upset
[1:15:46] because you would just say you were I
[1:15:47] was young in my faith I didn't have
[1:15:49] enough confidence in the word of God to
[1:15:51] believe in what God has said about me so
[1:15:52] I had to rely on others when brother
[1:15:54] so-so didn't pick up his phone because I
[1:15:56] mean you know someone we didn't have
[1:15:57] cell phones so he didn't pick up the
[1:15:58] phone I started question what happened
[1:16:01] I called another brother so-and-so he
[1:16:03] didn't pick up his phone by that time
[1:16:04] two people didn't pick up the phone for
[1:16:06] sure the Rapture happened
[1:16:09] you start to pace around and start
[1:16:11] wondering and finally he called a third
[1:16:13] brother and it took a while he finally
[1:16:14] picked up you're so relieved but so
[1:16:16] upset because it took so long
[1:16:18] and that's the sweetest voice that you
[1:16:20] could ever find on the other phone
[1:16:21] brother I'm so happy you picked up God
[1:16:22] bless you how are you gonna you don't
[1:16:24] give praise though you're gonna be
[1:16:25] interested I'm gonna be in church on
[1:16:26] Sunday I won't miss church you're gonna
[1:16:27] be in church he's just so relieved
[1:16:30] because your faith
[1:16:32] was based upon that they were around
[1:16:34] but let me tell you as you mature as a
[1:16:36] Christian and you know where you stand
[1:16:38] and you know the promises that God has
[1:16:40] for you and my faith is not predicated
[1:16:43] on what you believe it's based upon what
[1:16:45] God says about me
[1:16:48] I was a sinner that was saved by grace
[1:16:52] okay amen
[1:16:55] amen
[1:16:56] and thank God for cell phone I could
[1:16:58] text you too now so I mean
[1:17:03] when in time pass you walked according
[1:17:05] to the course of this word according to
[1:17:07] the prince of the power of the air let
[1:17:08] me tell you when you look at the ocean
[1:17:10] the only reason why the ocean is wild up
[1:17:13] is because of the Winds
[1:17:15] that causes the ocean to kind of cause
[1:17:17] emotion
[1:17:19] the reason why you were the way you were
[1:17:21] there was a seed that was planted within
[1:17:24] you before the foundation of the world
[1:17:25] so when you were born there was a seed
[1:17:27] that was there there was a germ of life
[1:17:29] that was there but you were you were
[1:17:31] shrouded in darkness
[1:17:33] you were shrouded in darkness and so
[1:17:35] therefore your behavior was influenced
[1:17:38] by the by the Demonic Powers within the
[1:17:41] air
[1:17:44] and so even though in your mind you said
[1:17:46] I could never come to terms of accepting
[1:17:48] the word of God God had different
[1:17:50] opinions about you
[1:17:53] that's the reason why I go back to the
[1:17:55] very beginning in Genesis when the Bible
[1:17:56] says let there be light
[1:17:59] it was never a question it was never
[1:18:02] spoken without doubt but it was spoken
[1:18:04] with such a a a such Authority
[1:18:07] and the Bible says the Bible says there
[1:18:10] was light
[1:18:12] it came to pass
[1:18:14] and so the Bible goes on to say among
[1:18:16] whom also we had our conversations in
[1:18:18] time past and the lust of our flesh
[1:18:20] fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and
[1:18:23] of the Mind
[1:18:24] felt good we did it if we thought about
[1:18:27] it we did it
[1:18:28] and we're by Nature the children of
[1:18:30] Wrath even as others but God who is Rich
[1:18:37] not only a god who's merciful but a God
[1:18:41] who is Rich
[1:18:42] and mercy amen amen let me tell you we
[1:18:45] were so far in darkness
[1:18:48] we were so much into sin
[1:18:51] the things that we used to do if we were
[1:18:53] to play back your life half of you would
[1:18:55] be embarrassed
[1:18:58] but thank God for the blood of Jesus
[1:19:00] Christ
[1:19:01] that when people try to remind you of
[1:19:03] your past God doesn't even see your past
[1:19:06] because the blood erases your past
[1:19:10] removes it all completely
[1:19:15] and so God brought you to life
[1:19:18] and Ezekiel
[1:19:21] where my thought was at
[1:19:24] the Bible talks about this valley of dry
[1:19:26] bones
[1:19:29] we live in a world right now
[1:19:32] where man is trying to play God
[1:19:38] man is trying to flee God
[1:19:41] so ezekiel's looking at this valley of
[1:19:44] dry bones and we're going to dissect
[1:19:45] this a little bit
[1:19:47] and God looks to Ezekiel
[1:19:49] and see the dead situation
[1:19:53] and he says can these Dry Bones live
[1:19:56] and he says Thou knows
[1:19:59] there is a desire in men
[1:20:03] to be a creator
[1:20:08] there's a desire in men to be a creator
[1:20:11] and so back in the beginning
[1:20:14] God had told Adam
[1:20:16] that you should eat only of the Tree of
[1:20:18] Life
[1:20:21] but men slipped up
[1:20:23] and ate off the tree of knowledge of
[1:20:27] Good and Evil
[1:20:30] Stand Together
[1:20:32] so the tree of knowledge produces some
[1:20:34] good
[1:20:35] and it produces some evil
[1:20:39] and so there is evidence of this we are
[1:20:42] recipient of this
[1:20:44] we have been a recipient of the tree of
[1:20:47] knowledge of Good and Evil
[1:20:50] in the gospel
[1:20:52] has been intended to bring us back to
[1:20:55] the Tree of Life
[1:20:56] while we're reaping the benefits of the
[1:20:59] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[1:21:02] let me help you understand
[1:21:04] we find that throughout history
[1:21:07] man has uh man has come up with
[1:21:10] technological advances
[1:21:13] bringing them to life
[1:21:14] we move from the horse and buggy to the
[1:21:18] car
[1:21:19] we move from the car to the rocket
[1:21:23] we have progressed
[1:21:25] in our understanding all that's been
[1:21:27] through the through the knowledge of the
[1:21:30] of Good and Evil that's how you were
[1:21:32] able to come to church
[1:21:33] we drove our cars there
[1:21:35] but we also know what could I the the
[1:21:38] outcome of such these things
[1:21:42] it's not until here recently
[1:21:44] that man says you know what I want to go
[1:21:46] beyond just the mechanics I want to take
[1:21:49] this to another level
[1:21:52] the reason why they're doing that is
[1:21:53] because they're motivated by a spirit
[1:21:56] and the prophet says as what we see
[1:21:59] happening in the world is the same type
[1:22:01] that's happening in the spirit Realm
[1:22:04] so there's been a lot of talks which I'm
[1:22:06] sure many have heard called artificial
[1:22:08] intelligence
[1:22:10] it's no stroke of a of coincidence that
[1:22:14] conversations like this has beginning
[1:22:16] are beginning to happen in our time
[1:22:19] and man is trying to tap into a realm
[1:22:22] where they can say how can we position
[1:22:24] ourselves and they won't tell you like
[1:22:26] this they're spinning Every Witch Way
[1:22:28] but how can we position ourselves to be
[1:22:31] creators of our own crafts
[1:22:34] and so therefore they've created
[1:22:37] they've evolved technology to the point
[1:22:41] where you have now artificial
[1:22:43] intelligence and what's artificial
[1:22:45] intelligence is that it's artificial
[1:22:47] it's not real but it's a form of
[1:22:49] intelligence
[1:22:51] and so they're using that intelligence
[1:22:54] to create
[1:22:56] some sort of life
[1:22:58] that could speak for itself
[1:23:01] that could think for itself
[1:23:04] that can do for itself
[1:23:07] that could replicate itself
[1:23:10] are we staying together
[1:23:11] [Music]
[1:23:13] and so they're looking at these things
[1:23:15] and they're introducing what is called
[1:23:18] artificial intelligence they're trying
[1:23:19] to bring forth artificial life
[1:23:24] so they're bringing a substitution for
[1:23:28] something that is real
[1:23:30] and so at the same time that man is
[1:23:32] trying to tap into a higher Dimension
[1:23:34] God is calling a bride and trying to tap
[1:23:38] her into a higher dimension
[1:23:40] that's the reason why we're no longer
[1:23:42] living under just justification you're
[1:23:45] no longer just Justified that's not good
[1:23:47] enough to say I'm a Believer being
[1:23:49] Sanctified is not good enough to say I'm
[1:23:51] a Believer being baptized of the Holy
[1:23:53] Ghost that's just not enough you got to
[1:23:55] be it's you gotta be saturated having
[1:23:57] the mind of God
[1:24:01] having the intelligence of God
[1:24:03] having the understanding of God
[1:24:06] to separate you from the world
[1:24:09] are we staying together
[1:24:12] man is creating
[1:24:15] his own devices
[1:24:17] he's creating his own ways and meanwhile
[1:24:21] God is creating a bride
[1:24:24] that doesn't think like the world but I
[1:24:26] think it's just like God
[1:24:28] that you can walk into a situation and
[1:24:31] assess it and say this is not Godlike
[1:24:36] the Bible says shouldn't every
[1:24:37] appearance of evil it doesn't have to
[1:24:40] say evil written over it if it just
[1:24:42] appears like it's the devil the Bible
[1:24:44] says have nothing to do with it
[1:24:48] because the Bible says your spirit Bears
[1:24:51] testimony with his spirit that you are
[1:24:53] the child of God
[1:24:55] there's been times that you can walk
[1:24:56] into a situation and not have a
[1:24:58] scripture to back it up but you know
[1:25:00] it's a wrong situation
[1:25:07] so man
[1:25:09] is trying to be creators of their own
[1:25:11] selves
[1:25:12] and yet God has instilled within you the
[1:25:16] power of creation through the words that
[1:25:18] you speak by the spoken word
[1:25:21] are we staying together
[1:25:24] so by the Bible says God looks through
[1:25:26] Ezekiel says can these Dry Bones live
[1:25:29] they were in the valley
[1:25:31] and the reason why they were in a valley
[1:25:34] that means that they were there for a
[1:25:36] long time that's the reason why they
[1:25:38] were dry bones
[1:25:40] they were in between mountaintops
[1:25:43] they were from one Revival to the next
[1:25:46] sometimes you feel like you're in a high
[1:25:48] sometimes you feel like you're in the
[1:25:50] low
[1:25:52] and what happened is that between the
[1:25:54] mountaintops one Sunday you're coming
[1:25:56] you feel all revived you feel all
[1:25:59] edified you feel that God has spoken
[1:26:01] unto you and then the rest of the week
[1:26:03] you go through the valley
[1:26:05] you get hit on every side you get
[1:26:07] bombarded on every side you're faced
[1:26:10] with family situation job situation Bill
[1:26:12] situation uh Health situations you name
[1:26:15] it and you come back to church you're
[1:26:17] back on the high
[1:26:18] pastor preached me happy he preaches his
[1:26:21] best heart out you feel all excited you
[1:26:24] feel pumped and you get knocked out
[1:26:25] again on Monday
[1:26:26] and you go through the cycle again
[1:26:29] rather than carrying that inspiration
[1:26:31] throughout the week you lay inside on
[1:26:33] the Shelf
[1:26:35] the only scripture that people have
[1:26:37] often read is the scripture that they
[1:26:38] hear from the from a sermon that's
[1:26:40] preached on a Sunday morning
[1:26:43] that's horrible Saints
[1:26:45] you ought to know the scriptures
[1:26:46] throughout the entire week not just what
[1:26:48] is preached on a Sunday morning or
[1:26:49] Wednesday night amen you ought to live
[1:26:51] and breathe this thing
[1:26:55] so here you are between two mountaintops
[1:26:57] and there you are in the valley the
[1:26:58] Bible says yea though I walk through the
[1:26:59] valley of the shadow of death
[1:27:01] I fear no evil
[1:27:03] start with me start writing thy staff to
[1:27:05] comfort me
[1:27:07] but what happens is that when we go
[1:27:09] through this Valley
[1:27:11] sometimes the the journey up
[1:27:15] to that Mountaintop
[1:27:17] gets so burdensed up
[1:27:19] it's a lot of work
[1:27:21] that you get tied to go up to that
[1:27:23] Mountaintop and you fall back
[1:27:26] and there you are in this Valley
[1:27:30] you stop worshiping God Like You should
[1:27:33] you stop praising God like you should
[1:27:34] you stop being an example like you
[1:27:37] should
[1:27:38] and the only thing that people know
[1:27:40] about you is what they see here in
[1:27:42] church
[1:27:44] don't live no higher than what you
[1:27:46] preach
[1:27:47] don't live no higher than what you're
[1:27:48] saying don't live no higher than your
[1:27:50] testimony
[1:27:52] because God has a way of finding you out
[1:27:54] it's easy when we blame in one another
[1:27:56] here it's easy when we can look at one
[1:27:58] another say praise the Lord I'm with you
[1:28:01] sister I'm with you brother but when
[1:28:02] you're out there
[1:28:03] that's a different story
[1:28:05] this is just training ground you don't
[1:28:07] have to impress me you got to impress
[1:28:09] God out there
[1:28:14] in that Valley people get cold
[1:28:17] because they've been in the journey for
[1:28:19] so long
[1:28:20] they go through the motions of the
[1:28:22] church
[1:28:23] they come to church they see people
[1:28:26] praise God they praise God
[1:28:28] they see people shout they shout they
[1:28:31] see people holler they holler they see
[1:28:33] people buy their heads and pray they
[1:28:34] pretend the body of their heads and they
[1:28:36] pray
[1:28:38] was the reality of it all right
[1:28:41] but God comes across the situation and
[1:28:43] he looks at it and he sees Ezekiel and
[1:28:45] he says look look at the valley of these
[1:28:47] Dry Bones God doesn't leave a situation
[1:28:49] the way he sees it
[1:28:53] can these Dry Bones live
[1:28:56] and he says you know it's Lord
[1:28:59] and he spoke the words
[1:29:01] he says prophesy unto these bones
[1:29:05] prophesy unto these dead bones that has
[1:29:09] no Flesh on them
[1:29:11] that can't hear they can't listen
[1:29:14] but it takes the movement of God
[1:29:17] to come on the scene and begin to make
[1:29:20] these bones move
[1:29:22] and it's no longer that you're
[1:29:24] motivating yourself it's God that's
[1:29:27] coming on the scene
[1:29:29] and creating life
[1:29:31] where people thought there was no life
[1:29:36] you know brother bear talks about the
[1:29:37] story he says you had this one mother
[1:29:40] who had this boy
[1:29:41] he was off in a seminary School
[1:29:44] and he was on for a few days
[1:29:46] and he got word and he heard that his
[1:29:48] mother was sick
[1:29:49] so
[1:29:51] as it were he made his way back home
[1:29:54] in a long story short his mother got
[1:29:56] well
[1:29:58] and then he looks at his mother said Mom
[1:30:00] I got your letters
[1:30:02] and I understood that you weren't
[1:30:03] feeling too well and that you were sick
[1:30:05] she's like yeah I was on the Brinks of
[1:30:08] death but there was a Revival that was
[1:30:10] going on
[1:30:12] he says there was a preacher down there
[1:30:13] that was preaching on healing
[1:30:15] so I went down there and I began to uh
[1:30:18] have some uh healing services with that
[1:30:20] preacher and then she says that he
[1:30:23] started to quote Mark 16 and off off of
[1:30:26] that scripture I received my healing
[1:30:30] and the boy looks at his mom's like Mom
[1:30:32] I want you to know something I learned
[1:30:33] in the Seminary
[1:30:35] he's like we learned that that scripture
[1:30:38] that that preacher quoted to you has no
[1:30:41] inspiration it has no life is no power
[1:30:44] behind it
[1:30:47] it's not even anointed
[1:30:51] and the mother looked and she began to
[1:30:54] shout and she began to praise God she
[1:30:57] began to holler and the boy says mom
[1:30:59] what is wrong with you she's like I
[1:31:01] started to think if that scripture is
[1:31:04] uninspired and was able to heal this
[1:31:07] body how much more the inspired word of
[1:31:10] God
[1:31:13] what the world doesn't like I take every
[1:31:16] bit of word of God and bring it into my
[1:31:19] soul
[1:31:23] life could become so routine for us
[1:31:27] it could become so common for us
[1:31:34] in between high mountains
[1:31:37] in between
[1:31:39] scriptures in between revivals
[1:31:42] can these bones live
[1:31:46] Apollo bones God saw something
[1:31:48] that people didn't see
[1:31:52] so he prophesies I was commanded and I
[1:31:55] and as I prophesied there was a noise
[1:31:58] Behold a shaking and the bones came
[1:32:02] together bone to his bone let me tell
[1:32:05] you Saints when the word of God was
[1:32:08] first preached to you there was a
[1:32:10] Revival that took place
[1:32:12] you responded a certain way
[1:32:16] if I lit a fire underneath you you won't
[1:32:18] sit still
[1:32:20] I've never been a kitchen where I
[1:32:22] haven't heard something sizzling and see
[1:32:24] it just laying there motionless
[1:32:25] something was happening
[1:32:28] when God comes on the scene let me tell
[1:32:30] you when God comes into your life it
[1:32:32] doesn't cause you just to stand around
[1:32:33] you react to the promises of God because
[1:32:36] you envisioned where you see yourself at
[1:32:39] amen let me tell you when I get to the
[1:32:41] other side I'm not going to be casual
[1:32:43] about it
[1:32:47] every battle that I've gone through
[1:32:49] every Star that I've gotten every wound
[1:32:52] that I've endured the last thing I do is
[1:32:54] when I get to the other side and say
[1:32:56] thank you Jesus
[1:32:59] I'm so glad that I made it
[1:33:02] let me tell you there's not enough
[1:33:04] excitement
[1:33:05] that could contain a Believer to know
[1:33:08] that every battle that you've endured
[1:33:10] here was for the reason that you made it
[1:33:12] on the other side
[1:33:14] [Applause]
[1:33:16] that you've endured when you have a scar
[1:33:19] it tells me that whatever that was that
[1:33:22] tried to get hold of your life you were
[1:33:24] stronger than that thing
[1:33:25] amen
[1:33:27] every time the Devil comes and tries to
[1:33:29] growl at you like a roaring lion you let
[1:33:31] the devil know I see that scar but
[1:33:33] greater is he that is in me than he that
[1:33:36] is in the world
[1:33:41] so God spoke to these bones and these
[1:33:43] bones begin to come alive let me tell
[1:33:45] you Saints you are a child of Prophecy
[1:33:49] before you were born God knew you
[1:33:53] before you spoke your first word god
[1:33:56] knew you amen amen
[1:34:00] when you took a when God took a family
[1:34:03] picture way back before the foundation
[1:34:05] of the world you know whenever you took
[1:34:07] a group picture people just try to make
[1:34:09] sure that they you could see them you
[1:34:10] know you kind of catch the little head
[1:34:11] just want to make sure that they're part
[1:34:13] of the photo don't worry God sees you
[1:34:17] know you might be hiding behind somebody
[1:34:18] God sees you in the picture
[1:34:21] God sees you God recognize you you have
[1:34:23] your place in the word of God no one can
[1:34:26] take your place you are not a
[1:34:28] substitution you're the original you're
[1:34:31] unique you're authentic
[1:34:35] God Made You the Way You Are God didn't
[1:34:37] make me to be like brother jacked up and
[1:34:39] he could never be me God made me the way
[1:34:41] I am
[1:34:44] don't try to be somebody that you're not
[1:34:46] supposed to be
[1:34:48] right don't try to impress somebody that
[1:34:50] you're not be yourself because that's
[1:34:53] how God sees you
[1:34:55] [Applause]
[1:34:58] God didn't cause you to be nobody but be
[1:35:01] your unique self
[1:35:04] the world is trying to conform to a
[1:35:07] certain place a certain way of thinking
[1:35:09] a certain way of doing things I'm not
[1:35:11] here to conform to the world the Bible
[1:35:13] says be ye transformed by the renewing
[1:35:16] of your mind
[1:35:19] when these bones started to come
[1:35:21] together
[1:35:22] these bones were scattered across the
[1:35:23] whole valley
[1:35:25] if it was me my bone was probably way
[1:35:26] down there my leg bone was way down
[1:35:28] there my thigh bone was way down there
[1:35:30] my shoulder bones were way down there my
[1:35:32] skull was way down there my neck my knee
[1:35:34] you name it I was all over
[1:35:37] [Applause]
[1:35:38] your life was scattered in a million
[1:35:41] pieces many of you did have no direction
[1:35:44] in the sense of life you had no idea if
[1:35:46] you were coming or going
[1:35:49] your life was every bit of a confusion
[1:35:52] but the Bible says God is not the author
[1:35:55] of confusion
[1:35:55] [Music]
[1:35:57] if you don't understand something it's
[1:35:59] not God it's you
[1:36:02] take it back to the scripture and God
[1:36:04] will line it up for you
[1:36:09] bones were crossed over a pile of bones
[1:36:13] scattered into probably miles and miles
[1:36:15] of this Valley
[1:36:18] and God says to Ezekiel
[1:36:21] speak these words to these bones they
[1:36:23] may not have ears but they were listen
[1:36:25] they may not have ears but they'll
[1:36:27] respond
[1:36:30] when you were born into this Earth
[1:36:32] your life was scattered into a million
[1:36:34] pieces
[1:36:36] you try to fit in with this crowd
[1:36:39] you try to fit in with that crowd you
[1:36:42] try to act this way talk this way you're
[1:36:45] trying to put pieces together make sense
[1:36:47] of the meaning of your life where do you
[1:36:48] fit in society would he fit within your
[1:36:50] family would he fit with your friends
[1:36:51] would he fit within your peer group how
[1:36:53] does your future look like how does my
[1:36:55] family look like you try to make sense
[1:36:57] of all these things and then people tell
[1:36:59] you go see a psychiatrist go see a
[1:37:00] therapist let me tell you even they
[1:37:01] themselves need help
[1:37:04] amen they're listening to your problems
[1:37:06] and have problems of themselves let me
[1:37:07] tell you I'd rather go to a great
[1:37:08] position that can be touched by the
[1:37:10] feelings of my affirmities who knows my
[1:37:12] problems it doesn't have a problem
[1:37:14] himself
[1:37:15] [Applause]
[1:37:18] and when God said we got spoke those
[1:37:20] words
[1:37:22] going back to your unique self every
[1:37:25] bone
[1:37:27] that was in the far distance came
[1:37:29] rushing back
[1:37:32] the the skull bone connected to the neck
[1:37:34] bone
[1:37:36] not my skull bone connected to your neck
[1:37:38] bone it was my neck bone
[1:37:41] my neck bone connected to my shoulder
[1:37:44] not his shoulder
[1:37:46] God's making me unique I am my
[1:37:49] individual person
[1:37:51] my shoulder bone connected to my rib
[1:37:53] bone now your rib bone
[1:37:55] amen my remote connected to my hip bone
[1:37:58] now your hip bone God is forming me I'm
[1:38:01] in the hands of the Potter I'm in the
[1:38:03] hands of the creator
[1:38:06] amen my hip bone connected to my leg
[1:38:09] bone not your leg bone
[1:38:12] the balls started to come back together
[1:38:15] from the distance what was God doing
[1:38:17] he's putting the pieces back together
[1:38:18] again
[1:38:21] God was putting to Pieces he's a great
[1:38:24] surgeon
[1:38:26] putting the pieces together let me tell
[1:38:27] you things I don't know if there was
[1:38:29] pain that was felt but I know there was
[1:38:31] some shouting the bones were clapping
[1:38:33] together
[1:38:35] they were making a lot of noise
[1:38:39] when God started opening my eyes I
[1:38:41] started to get excited my bones started
[1:38:44] to clap together I started to shout I
[1:38:46] started to holler because I started to
[1:38:48] see an image of who I was supposed to be
[1:38:52] beautiful
[1:38:55] and if he looked at me I was just
[1:38:56] numbered a skeleton I was not a pretty
[1:38:58] picture to look at back in my day you
[1:39:00] would look at me say oh he's one ugly
[1:39:02] fella that's all right God didn't when
[1:39:04] God started God will finish the Bible
[1:39:06] says he that has begun a good work in
[1:39:08] you will finish it
[1:39:12] amen I didn't look too attractive I was
[1:39:15] a messed up boy
[1:39:17] number please number skeletons
[1:39:20] but he that started the good work in you
[1:39:23] what men can see God saw God sees the
[1:39:27] Finish Line when you say you can't make
[1:39:29] it God has seen you here already you've
[1:39:32] already crossed the Finishing Line
[1:39:38] go back and read the ending of the Bible
[1:39:41] and then when you're free when you read
[1:39:43] the ending of the scripture the ending
[1:39:44] in the Bible don't walk around so sad
[1:39:46] that's your promise
[1:39:48] that's your Victory amen
[1:39:52] the leg bone connected to the anchor
[1:39:55] bone
[1:39:56] and they're just bones
[1:39:59] lay there
[1:40:00] a formation of different bodies
[1:40:04] then the Bible says send you upon sinew
[1:40:08] because God
[1:40:09] when he does something he does it
[1:40:11] completely
[1:40:13] the muscles started to form around the
[1:40:16] bones
[1:40:20] creating the muscles let me tell you
[1:40:21] it's it's a form of pottery I took in
[1:40:24] our class and you know when we did Art
[1:40:26] one of the things that we did was we we
[1:40:28] did pottery and I took this massive
[1:40:31] piece of clay
[1:40:33] and we put it in the center of the wheel
[1:40:34] and you can move the wheel like this if
[1:40:36] you want and then they have the the one
[1:40:38] where you could just press with your
[1:40:39] feet and it just goes and then this this
[1:40:41] thing you gotta center it
[1:40:44] got to be right there in the center it's
[1:40:46] not where God has a good grip on it
[1:40:48] guy got to get a good grip on your life
[1:40:50] because you have a tendency of not
[1:40:52] staying in place the Bible says be still
[1:40:55] and know that I am God quit trying to
[1:40:58] solve the problem yourself be still and
[1:41:00] know that I'm God quit trying to do it
[1:41:03] yourself be still and know that I am God
[1:41:10] as a Potter you grab a hold of that clay
[1:41:12] I'm talking from experience to grab a
[1:41:14] hold of that clay and the only way that
[1:41:16] you you don't just let it stay there it
[1:41:18] has to be emotion
[1:41:20] it has to be constantly in motion
[1:41:23] God got to spin you around things look
[1:41:26] kind of funny you don't know whether
[1:41:27] you're coming or going and so things
[1:41:29] might look confusing to you but God is
[1:41:31] in control of the situation
[1:41:33] [Applause]
[1:41:35] and you're just spinning around you're
[1:41:38] just spinning around and God got a hold
[1:41:40] of you right there when you think you're
[1:41:42] gonna fall guys like I got you
[1:41:46] in all the meanwhile you're spinning
[1:41:48] around that's how the world's just
[1:41:49] constantly spinning things at you
[1:41:51] throwing things at you you're being
[1:41:52] bombarded with all kinds of things and
[1:41:54] God says I got control of this
[1:41:57] and all it is is just a lump of clay
[1:42:00] doesn't look like anything but God sees
[1:42:03] a finished product as he's working on it
[1:42:07] yeah and you know what you know what we
[1:42:08] do also as we're working with the clay
[1:42:11] we got to put some water on it
[1:42:15] we gotta keep it moist
[1:42:18] so that way it can move
[1:42:20] it's pliable
[1:42:23] if it doesn't look the way it needs to
[1:42:26] look it looks like it's on the right
[1:42:28] track but it doesn't look sometimes we
[1:42:30] have to break it up again
[1:42:32] y'all didn't catch me sometimes it looks
[1:42:35] like it's looking like something I have
[1:42:37] to break it up because it's not exactly
[1:42:39] what what I want it to look like
[1:42:42] just because someone's going through
[1:42:44] some hardship doesn't mean that God is
[1:42:46] done with them he said well he used to
[1:42:48] walk so circumspectly such like a
[1:42:51] Christian and now he's all broken up God
[1:42:53] is redoing him again
[1:42:56] God is reshaping her again
[1:42:59] he's still in the hands of the Potter
[1:43:01] [Music]
[1:43:04] we take that Potter
[1:43:06] and it begins to kind of shape it and
[1:43:09] then we break it down
[1:43:10] we let it take form and we break it down
[1:43:13] meanwhile the wheel is still spinning
[1:43:15] and we're dropping more water we're
[1:43:18] filling it with more of God's words
[1:43:19] we're letting them know that God's with
[1:43:21] you he's giving you some reassurance
[1:43:23] your life is spinning around you don't
[1:43:25] have any sense of what's going on you
[1:43:26] don't feel like you're in control but
[1:43:27] God's in control
[1:43:32] that's the reason why people don't like
[1:43:34] to fly because it's easier to stay
[1:43:36] behind the steering wheel and be in
[1:43:37] control of the driver's seat but when
[1:43:39] you're in the plane 30 000 feet up in
[1:43:41] the air and you're just sitting there as
[1:43:42] a passenger and the plane goes dead like
[1:43:44] this you're all your confidence is in
[1:43:46] that pilot
[1:43:48] and it makes you scared because you
[1:43:50] don't have a steering wheel to grab on
[1:43:53] and so you have to relinquish
[1:43:55] give up that trust and trust that that
[1:43:58] man's experience could take you from
[1:44:00] point A to point B let me tell you give
[1:44:02] up your trust on yourself and give it to
[1:44:04] God and he can take you from point A all
[1:44:07] the way to point B
[1:44:09] [Applause]
[1:44:12] itch and we keep spinning that wheel
[1:44:16] and then
[1:44:18] we go in we punch a hole if we're making
[1:44:20] a vase
[1:44:22] and it's just a little hole just a small
[1:44:25] little hole and then we slowly as it
[1:44:27] spin begin to widen it a little bit
[1:44:30] widen it and we're controlling how wide
[1:44:34] this base has to be we're controlling
[1:44:36] how deep how thick this vase needs to be
[1:44:43] only when we start
[1:44:45] to get to that image
[1:44:48] what we have in our head
[1:44:50] do we start to slow up a little bit
[1:44:53] because this vessel is not becoming
[1:44:56] mature
[1:44:59] sinew upon seeing you
[1:45:03] and when that vessel is done the Potter
[1:45:05] carefully takes out that vessel
[1:45:09] he looked at that vessel it looks
[1:45:11] everything
[1:45:12] that he has in his mind
[1:45:16] but it's not done yet
[1:45:20] it's not done yet
[1:45:23] God went through a lot of work
[1:45:26] looking for you
[1:45:28] took a chunk of dirt
[1:45:30] they said this ain't it
[1:45:34] thousands of people laid in the days of
[1:45:36] Jesus by the pool of Bethesda
[1:45:39] and Jesus waited his way past thousands
[1:45:41] of people looking for one man
[1:45:46] seven billion people on planet Earth
[1:45:48] Saints and God came looking for you
[1:45:51] that's how special
[1:45:54] you want to God that's how unique you
[1:45:55] are to God that God didn't look for
[1:45:57] someone else he came looking for you
[1:46:00] when Adam felt God didn't just say hey
[1:46:03] you where you at God says I am where are
[1:46:06] you at God knows your name
[1:46:10] before you were born before your mom or
[1:46:12] your dad had a name given to you God
[1:46:15] called you by your name
[1:46:18] thank you Lord Jesus
[1:46:20] picked up
[1:46:22] that clunk of dirt
[1:46:24] that clay
[1:46:26] molded
[1:46:29] he started working with me a little bit
[1:46:31] he made you cry a little bit he broke
[1:46:34] you up you left church and came back to
[1:46:36] church you left church and you came back
[1:46:38] to church
[1:46:40] y'all can look at me like I'm crazy
[1:46:41] because I've been through myself in and
[1:46:43] out of church
[1:46:44] I'm not gonna praise God no more I come
[1:46:47] back praise be to Jesus
[1:46:50] because God knows how to put situations
[1:46:52] in my life since I'm running right back
[1:46:54] to him he's not going to lose on his
[1:46:56] investment
[1:46:58] you're too important for God to lose you
[1:47:01] he's invested too much in you
[1:47:06] he breaks you up builds you back up
[1:47:11] and then there he has this vessel
[1:47:14] this vase that looks gorgeous
[1:47:18] but she's not done yet
[1:47:21] what God getting ready to do
[1:47:23] what we had to do when we used to do
[1:47:25] stuff like that we had to put it in the
[1:47:27] fiery furnace
[1:47:29] yeah
[1:47:32] you thought you went through something
[1:47:33] so God put you in the fiery furnace
[1:47:36] Shadrach back now I have been the the
[1:47:38] Hebrew boys
[1:47:40] I can finish the names but y'all know
[1:47:42] who I was talking about
[1:47:44] I started too
[1:47:49] I'm in the fiery furnace
[1:47:52] God has to do that he has to break all
[1:47:54] of that greenness out of us all of that
[1:47:56] immaturity getting upset for no reason
[1:47:59] because someone didn't shake your hand
[1:48:01] someone looked at you a certain way they
[1:48:03] acted a certain way you got to serve
[1:48:05] feelings about somebody God is trying to
[1:48:07] make that out of you because that's not
[1:48:09] going to cause you to have a change in
[1:48:10] the body
[1:48:12] let me say it again the way you feel
[1:48:15] about somebody having those little
[1:48:16] feelings that's not going to be over
[1:48:17] there
[1:48:19] having certain looks are not going to be
[1:48:21] over there
[1:48:22] that's right brother
[1:48:24] perfect love
[1:48:28] perfect Fellowship
[1:48:30] it's the only thing
[1:48:32] that's gonna be over there now when I
[1:48:34] say God bless you I mean it
[1:48:37] that when I say I'm praying for you I
[1:48:39] mean it
[1:48:41] now when I see that God's blessed you
[1:48:44] I'm happy for you hey man
[1:48:48] and that I don't feel a certain way
[1:48:52] God's trying to bake all of this stuff
[1:48:54] out of you
[1:48:55] say Lord make me stronger he put
[1:48:58] situations to make you stronger
[1:49:01] Lord grant me patience he put situations
[1:49:04] to build patience
[1:49:07] Lord Give Me Love he put people around
[1:49:09] you so that way you could love
[1:49:13] it's like brother I don't know I'm
[1:49:14] trying to love and I'm trying to
[1:49:15] exercise and God put me with the with a
[1:49:18] horrible boss he's trying to teach you
[1:49:19] love
[1:49:21] you did ask for love
[1:49:23] [Music]
[1:49:24] God doesn't give you more than what
[1:49:26] you're capable of
[1:49:27] God has confidence in you let me say
[1:49:30] again God has confidence in you
[1:49:35] think about it Satan doesn't even think
[1:49:37] about you unless God directs him
[1:49:40] he said Bridget what are you talking
[1:49:41] about
[1:49:42] in the day of job
[1:49:44] Satan was minding his own business
[1:49:47] just mind his own business and God said
[1:49:50] let me ask you a question have you
[1:49:51] considered my servant job he's like you
[1:49:52] never even crossed my mind
[1:49:54] my mind
[1:49:56] that's not God I'll praise
[1:49:58] he's like you got all this has a
[1:50:00] protection about him you got all this
[1:50:02] protection around your sons and
[1:50:03] daughters don't even cross my mind I got
[1:50:04] other people to deal with
[1:50:07] it and then feign looks to God he says
[1:50:09] if you remove the hedge of protection
[1:50:10] I'll give them a curse you to your face
[1:50:14] I'm sure God kind of laughed a little
[1:50:15] bit he's like all right you're on on
[1:50:16] this one let's do this
[1:50:18] because God had confidence sometimes let
[1:50:20] me tell you sometimes the battle that
[1:50:21] you're going through has nothing to do
[1:50:24] with you it's God proven to Satan Who
[1:50:27] You Are
[1:50:28] yeah
[1:50:30] amen your battle may not even be for you
[1:50:33] it could be for somebody else
[1:50:35] sister I was watching how God dealt with
[1:50:38] your life and how you have dealt with it
[1:50:40] I'm just so inspired
[1:50:44] sometimes what you go through is for the
[1:50:46] benefit of others
[1:50:48] because if they see how God works in
[1:50:50] your life that gives them confidence
[1:50:52] that God can work in their life
[1:50:54] [Applause]
[1:50:59] let me say not only here in church but
[1:51:01] in the jobs
[1:51:03] in the job people watch it they know
[1:51:05] what you stand for
[1:51:06] they know what you believe
[1:51:09] they may not say anything to you but
[1:51:11] Lord prevent the day that's you you slip
[1:51:14] up and do something that you ain't
[1:51:15] supposed to you say something you ain't
[1:51:17] supposed to say they come out there hey
[1:51:19] I thought you said the Bible said
[1:51:21] [Music]
[1:51:22] they know the scripture they know when
[1:51:25] you said it
[1:51:28] they're watching you they may not read
[1:51:31] that Bible but they're watching your
[1:51:32] biblical life then watch how you hold on
[1:51:35] to God's word then watch how you react
[1:51:37] to a negative situation
[1:51:43] sinew
[1:51:45] upon Sindhu
[1:51:48] God puts that that pottery and that
[1:51:51] fiery furnace
[1:51:54] let me tell you when God puts you
[1:51:56] through the Heat
[1:51:57] the devil could try to put you through
[1:51:59] in the fire
[1:52:00] but God's control
[1:52:02] of how hot it gets
[1:52:06] let me say one more time you could be in
[1:52:08] the fiery furnace and the devil could
[1:52:11] holler and shout and say he's happy
[1:52:13] about this but God controls how hot it
[1:52:15] gets
[1:52:16] he knows what what's enough to build you
[1:52:20] because he doesn't want to break you he
[1:52:22] just want to make you stronger
[1:52:28] he burns all that thing out of you
[1:52:30] he takes it all out
[1:52:34] when you take that thing out
[1:52:37] this is this ashy White
[1:52:40] clay
[1:52:44] and people are looking at him might say
[1:52:45] man that is awesome God's like I'm not
[1:52:47] done yet
[1:52:48] it's still working
[1:52:52] he's still working
[1:52:54] God's looks at it and says I'm not doing
[1:52:56] yet
[1:52:57] then God takes
[1:52:59] this
[1:53:01] paint
[1:53:02] he begins to paint it
[1:53:05] put certain colors around it
[1:53:09] he's made us all different
[1:53:11] black white Chinese Indian European you
[1:53:14] name it God's made us all different
[1:53:17] he respect our individuality
[1:53:22] it's our collectiveness I worship God
[1:53:23] but he respects our individuality he
[1:53:26] made you the way he made some tall he
[1:53:28] made some short
[1:53:30] he made us a variety of people
[1:53:34] and God blessed us that way
[1:53:37] and what we used to do because we
[1:53:40] thought that was this like oh that's
[1:53:41] nice
[1:53:42] we're not done yet
[1:53:43] we put a coat over it
[1:53:46] so we could have like this this this uh
[1:53:49] not shine but like this this glow this
[1:53:51] gloss to it
[1:53:53] so that when God looks at it God sees a
[1:53:55] reflection of himself
[1:54:00] throughout the process God conceived his
[1:54:03] reflection so you weren't done yet
[1:54:08] so he takes this uh this this this this
[1:54:11] glaze and he puts it over
[1:54:14] and he puts it back
[1:54:20] saying we're gonna go through the battle
[1:54:22] we're gonna go through the struggle but
[1:54:24] the Bible says I would never leave you
[1:54:26] nor forsake you I'll be with you all the
[1:54:29] way to the end
[1:54:33] when the Hebrew children was in the fire
[1:54:35] furnace when they looked they thought
[1:54:37] they would have seen just three men the
[1:54:38] Bible says they saw four and the fourth
[1:54:40] one was the son of man
[1:54:42] when you're in your trust God does not
[1:54:44] leave you by your trance by yourself
[1:54:46] God's with you in the trials
[1:54:48] amen
[1:54:52] once
[1:54:54] that's done
[1:54:56] he set it aside
[1:54:59] and he gives it time to rest
[1:55:02] and then when he looks at this pottery
[1:55:06] the gloss begins to come through
[1:55:08] he sees a reflection of himself
[1:55:12] God's trying to get you through the
[1:55:13] trials
[1:55:15] the tribulation
[1:55:17] the persecution
[1:55:19] the things that you go through
[1:55:21] a reflection of himself
[1:55:25] sinew upon sinew
[1:55:29] and then
[1:55:31] what God does is that he puts the skin
[1:55:33] over them
[1:55:35] and all you saw was just nothing but
[1:55:37] corpse
[1:55:39] laying there
[1:55:41] that's what we that's that's where we're
[1:55:43] at now don't come to church and just be
[1:55:45] a corpse
[1:55:48] don't come to church and just be dead
[1:55:50] the Bible the prophet says the church
[1:55:51] without emotion is death
[1:55:54] sometimes I don't feel like stinging but
[1:55:56] I sing anyhow
[1:55:58] because I want to let the devil know
[1:55:59] that greater Z that is did me than he
[1:56:01] does in the world sometimes I offer like
[1:56:03] saying amen I say Amen anyhow sometimes
[1:56:06] I don't feel like shall not shout anyhow
[1:56:07] sometimes I don't feel like praise not
[1:56:09] praise anyhow because when I was at new
[1:56:11] out there in the world when I didn't
[1:56:12] feel like doing it I did it now that I'm
[1:56:14] on this side of Glory I'm not gonna let
[1:56:16] the devil rob me of giving God the
[1:56:19] praise and glory that he deserves
[1:56:22] you don't feel like praising God praise
[1:56:24] Him anyhow let the devil know whose side
[1:56:27] you are
[1:56:28] if the devil no it's not a matter of how
[1:56:30] I feel I'm still going to praise him I'm
[1:56:33] still going to worship him I'm still
[1:56:35] going to glorify him
[1:56:41] and don't just do it here do it in your
[1:56:43] house
[1:56:44] [Applause]
[1:56:44] [Music]
[1:56:47] cast out those demons from your house
[1:56:49] praise the Lord
[1:56:51] praise it to him when no one's looking
[1:56:53] shout the Praises of God and watch those
[1:56:56] Devils flee your home is your domain
[1:56:58] it's God's Kingdom
[1:57:03] amen the Bible says the inhabit the
[1:57:05] Praises of his people
[1:57:11] even in your car praise the Lord
[1:57:13] [Music]
[1:57:14] in your job praise the Lord when your
[1:57:18] Walmart praise the Lord
[1:57:19] when things are going good praise the
[1:57:21] Lord when things are going bad praise
[1:57:24] the Lord everything that has breath
[1:57:26] praise the name of the Lord
[1:57:28] [Applause]
[1:57:30] [Music]
[1:57:34] praise confuses the enemy he's asking
[1:57:37] what do you have to be so happy about if
[1:57:39] you know what I've gone through if you
[1:57:41] know the weak I've had if you know my
[1:57:43] trials and tribulations if you know what
[1:57:45] it took for me to be here then you would
[1:57:47] know why I'm praising the Lord
[1:57:51] devil try his best to stop me from being
[1:57:54] here but it's my God's grace
[1:57:59] by his Mercy
[1:58:01] that I'm able to stand on my two feet
[1:58:05] it's God's blessings
[1:58:11] if you're gonna take time to come to
[1:58:13] this place and worship God then worship
[1:58:16] Him
[1:58:20] don't go to the house of God because you
[1:58:22] have to come to the house of God because
[1:58:24] you want to amen
[1:58:29] God's called you
[1:58:31] for a certain purpose
[1:58:33] he called you for a certain reason
[1:58:37] this congregation
[1:58:39] of bones that were now flesh
[1:58:44] they were laying there
[1:58:46] God looked across the Spectrum
[1:58:49] and saw his reflection his people
[1:58:53] he could have just moved on
[1:58:55] but that's his creation
[1:58:58] no one else cared
[1:59:01] no one seemed to be bothered by it
[1:59:03] but it bothered God
[1:59:06] when people don't care
[1:59:09] God cares
[1:59:11] when people don't notice
[1:59:13] God noticed
[1:59:15] when people don't recognize God
[1:59:17] recognized
[1:59:22] he said Ezekiel
[1:59:25] prophesy
[1:59:27] your children
[1:59:31] amen
[1:59:32] this day was spoken of you
[1:59:35] this day was spoken of you
[1:59:39] you were meant to be born in this era
[1:59:42] all right
[1:59:44] you could have been born in any age
[1:59:47] at any time
[1:59:49] at any moment in history
[1:59:51] but God's so I fitting that in this era
[1:59:54] you were to be born
[1:59:57] you were to come on the scene
[2:00:02] at any other time in history
[2:00:04] but God chose you for this time
[2:00:07] he knew the battle would be tough
[2:00:09] right he knew the enemy would come in
[2:00:11] like a flood but the Bible says when the
[2:00:13] enemy comes in like a flood the spirit
[2:00:15] of God raises up a standard
[2:00:18] God has risen you up as a standard in
[2:00:22] this age
[2:00:27] we live in a world where people are not
[2:00:29] embarrassed of the gods they worship
[2:00:31] [Music]
[2:00:33] they don't care the gods that they
[2:00:35] believe in
[2:00:36] they threw they saw God out of the
[2:00:38] schools they throw God out of the homes
[2:00:40] there's no example but I declare to you
[2:00:43] there's an army that's rising up there's
[2:00:46] a generation that's been called for this
[2:00:47] age
[2:00:48] that is not a shame of the Gospel of
[2:00:51] Jesus Christ
[2:00:53] [Music]
[2:00:58] I'm not ashamed when I'm in a restaurant
[2:01:05] to pray over my feet
[2:01:08] amen it's a little thing since but it
[2:01:10] goes a long way
[2:01:18] pray over your food have a testimony
[2:01:21] people just jump into poison but I want
[2:01:23] to pray that there's no poison in my
[2:01:24] food
[2:01:27] not only do I trust the people that's
[2:01:30] cooking the food back there but I got
[2:01:31] more trust in God
[2:01:32] they might have missed something they
[2:01:34] might have added something come on
[2:01:37] somebody but when it comes in front of
[2:01:39] me I said Lord remove all impurities
[2:01:41] bless the smell that I'm about to
[2:01:43] receive I don't care who's looking at me
[2:01:45] as for me and my house we will worship
[2:01:48] God
[2:01:52] if they're not ashamed of their God I am
[2:01:55] not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus
[2:01:57] Christ
[2:02:01] amen
[2:02:05] I remember one time when I worked at
[2:02:07] Bank of America I might have shared this
[2:02:09] story years ago I worked at Bank of
[2:02:11] America in North Carolina
[2:02:12] I went down to go get me something to
[2:02:14] eat and it was just a Chinese restaurant
[2:02:16] that was down there right and it was
[2:02:18] kind of hustling and bustling it was
[2:02:19] just a lot of movement
[2:02:21] so I go up there and I patiently wait
[2:02:23] when you're hungry your stomach growls
[2:02:24] you know you just you're just patient
[2:02:25] you only got a certain amount of time
[2:02:26] and the line's a little long and you
[2:02:27] just you know trying to get up there and
[2:02:30] then finally I get up to the to take
[2:02:31] account and I'm like well give me a one
[2:02:33] lo mein
[2:02:34] add some shrimp with that give me this
[2:02:36] community
[2:02:37] so they got me the lady in front of me
[2:02:40] she was all bewildered and you know
[2:02:43] she's taught giving people hey you know
[2:02:45] this is what we want everything's
[2:02:46] happening so fast so she's like it's
[2:02:49] about eight dollars and something I
[2:02:50] changed I'm like all right no problem I
[2:02:51] looked in my wallet and I've down to my
[2:02:52] last ten dollars
[2:02:56] it's kind of tough to separate with your
[2:02:57] money
[2:03:00] so I gave her my ten dollars
[2:03:03] I gave him my ten dollars
[2:03:05] and then the movement of things she spun
[2:03:07] around and she exists something and she
[2:03:09] extended the 20 back to me
[2:03:12] things slow down
[2:03:18] the Bible says War to them that call
[2:03:20] evil good
[2:03:22] in good evil
[2:03:24] I looked at that twenty dollars coming
[2:03:26] back to me it was me and that twenty
[2:03:28] dollars everything was slow motion I I
[2:03:30] know this is gonna sound funny but I
[2:03:32] know that face looked at me and winged
[2:03:37] my head started to move in slow motion
[2:03:40] [Music]
[2:03:41] and in my mind I say praise the Lord
[2:03:44] [Applause]
[2:03:47] my pastor was not there
[2:03:50] I'm on somebody y'all look at me like
[2:03:52] I'm crazy my Deacon was not there
[2:03:57] my brother in Christ was not there with
[2:03:59] me that lady in that twenty dollars
[2:04:04] praise the Lord this is where the battle
[2:04:07] begins
[2:04:09] [Music]
[2:04:10] this was not a sermon that was being
[2:04:12] preached to me at that time
[2:04:15] like that it was the longest she did not
[2:04:18] realize what she was doing I just saw
[2:04:20] that twenty dollars I'd like praise the
[2:04:22] Lord
[2:04:25] but greater Z
[2:04:27] [Applause]
[2:04:30] I didn't need a passive tummy like
[2:04:32] brother Gene you know better than that I
[2:04:34] didn't need a beacon to remind me what I
[2:04:36] believed in I didn't I didn't know Bible
[2:04:37] that I was holding into everything that
[2:04:39] God wanted me to understand was in me
[2:04:46] no one would have known anything about
[2:04:49] it
[2:04:49] I would have walked away twice as
[2:04:51] blessed
[2:04:52] [Music]
[2:04:53] the Bible says woe to them that call
[2:04:55] evil good and good evil
[2:04:59] this was a moment for me to be honest
[2:05:03] with myself
[2:05:06] with the word of God
[2:05:10] amen yes because there was nobody to
[2:05:12] hold me accountable
[2:05:14] but in the day of judgment I don't want
[2:05:15] the devil coming like what are you crazy
[2:05:17] look at here I got some on you
[2:05:20] let's rewind real quickly
[2:05:22] do you remember this incident
[2:05:25] God is catching me and that very moment
[2:05:30] I whispered to the lady at first
[2:05:33] because I tried to justify it
[2:05:36] excuse me
[2:05:40] in my attempt to say to get her
[2:05:43] attention if she didn't respond while it
[2:05:44] wasn't my fault
[2:05:46] foreign
[2:05:48] those are battles that's going through
[2:05:50] your mind
[2:05:52] you try to justify things
[2:05:55] excuse me
[2:05:57] and I know it's loud in there and I'm
[2:05:59] talking even lower than I should
[2:06:01] and then I realized you know what this
[2:06:03] can't be
[2:06:04] I said
[2:06:05] ma'am excuse me
[2:06:07] and she spun around I'm like you're
[2:06:09] giving me too much change back
[2:06:11] she looked and she was astonished
[2:06:17] she was astonished
[2:06:19] that someone could be so trustworth
[2:06:22] someone could be so honest
[2:06:25] can you think about the repercussion
[2:06:27] that that could have had on that
[2:06:28] individual
[2:06:29] your actions because have a repercussion
[2:06:32] without you knowing because at the end
[2:06:34] of the day they gotta balance that
[2:06:36] drawer
[2:06:38] and if that drawer is not balanced and I
[2:06:40] said what did you do
[2:06:41] they could have lost her her job
[2:06:43] she could have been a single mother
[2:06:45] trying to bring him food and now she
[2:06:46] doesn't now she she doesn't have the
[2:06:48] means to do that your actions
[2:06:51] you're inappropriate non non non-word
[2:06:55] abiding actions right to have a
[2:06:58] consequence of someone
[2:07:01] greater is he that is in me
[2:07:04] than he that is in the world
[2:07:06] with the courage to speak up
[2:07:08] no matter how difficult it is when the
[2:07:11] devil put Temptation he knows how to put
[2:07:13] the right Temptations in front of you
[2:07:15] let me tell you since that wasn't the
[2:07:17] last time that happened there's there's
[2:07:18] many a times that this happens
[2:07:21] we come here we we congregate we
[2:07:23] assemble and we encourage one another
[2:07:25] but this is not where the battle's at
[2:07:28] I'm not fighting you I'm fighting a
[2:07:30] devil and that battle starts when you
[2:07:32] walk through those doors
[2:07:35] every amen you said this morning the
[2:07:39] devil's gonna test it tomorrow morning
[2:07:42] that's the reason why you got to have a
[2:07:44] sure Foundation let me tell you there's
[2:07:46] a lot of things I'm not certain of but
[2:07:48] the Bible tells me one thing be ye
[2:07:50] certain of God
[2:07:55] I'm wrapping it up
[2:07:58] and there are these bodies were laying
[2:08:00] there in the valley
[2:08:03] and God looks at Ezekiel and say
[2:08:06] speak unto the winds
[2:08:10] the north south east west
[2:08:13] the Four Corners speak unto the winds
[2:08:16] because it was not sufficient for the
[2:08:17] bodies just to be laying there
[2:08:20] we more we're more than just corpse
[2:08:23] we're more than just a vessel or Temple
[2:08:28] the wind started to come across
[2:08:30] I'll put it this way
[2:08:32] there was a mighty there was a sound of
[2:08:34] a rushing of A Mighty Wind like it was
[2:08:36] in the day of Pentecost
[2:08:39] A Rush of A Mighty Wind
[2:08:43] that came rushing through
[2:08:46] and every
[2:08:48] body
[2:08:50] you start to hear a heartbeat
[2:08:56] God breathed into his nostrils the
[2:08:58] Breath of Life
[2:08:59] you started to hear heartbeat
[2:09:04] the Miracles of life
[2:09:06] well my wife and I first heard that
[2:09:08] heartbeat or the heartbeats of our kids
[2:09:12] you realize this is beyond science
[2:09:16] Beyond man's ability to replicate
[2:09:19] there's a Creator somewhere yes
[2:09:24] and these Hearts started to pulsate
[2:09:28] and one by one
[2:09:30] these soldiers started to get up
[2:09:34] they came back from the dead
[2:09:37] they were once alive
[2:09:39] they were slain
[2:09:41] they were killed in battle
[2:09:45] God sees you where you were at
[2:09:49] he brings you back to life
[2:09:51] let me tell you something Saints
[2:09:54] death does not change you
[2:09:57] it changes your Dwelling Place
[2:10:02] when Samuel died as a prophet and they
[2:10:05] called Samuel back to life again he was
[2:10:07] still a prophet amen
[2:10:10] but the Blood
[2:10:11] changes
[2:10:13] in that same example I'm closing in that
[2:10:15] same example
[2:10:17] we know that we're going to be changed
[2:10:18] young again right that's what that's
[2:10:20] what the prophet teaches that's what the
[2:10:21] Bible teaches let me give you an example
[2:10:23] when Samuel died
[2:10:26] and Saul needed him
[2:10:29] he consulted the witch of Endor
[2:10:32] he came sneaking in and
[2:10:34] she's like we ain't supposed to be doing
[2:10:35] this because you know so I'll put a knee
[2:10:37] dick out there
[2:10:38] and he's like don't worry about this I
[2:10:40] I'll take care of it
[2:10:42] she called
[2:10:44] Saul I mean saw it called Samuel and
[2:10:47] when she saw Samuel Saul says what do
[2:10:49] you see and the Bible says I see an old
[2:10:51] man
[2:10:53] an old man
[2:10:55] showing that the blood of bulls and
[2:10:56] goats was not strong enough
[2:11:00] to change you in the Old Testament
[2:11:03] but there was a lamb that came
[2:11:07] there was a lamb that went to Calvary
[2:11:10] when his blood was shed on Calvary
[2:11:14] and he went down into that place
[2:11:16] and he brought back those individuals
[2:11:18] that blood
[2:11:20] was powerful enough
[2:11:22] to change you from an old person
[2:11:25] to a young person
[2:11:29] that's the power of the blood
[2:11:33] that's the reason why our Prophet when
[2:11:34] he looked at this and he looked beyond
[2:11:36] the curtains of time
[2:11:38] he says does the land that is called
[2:11:40] Forever
[2:11:43] it's that sweet place that we want to go
[2:11:45] to
[2:11:47] the winds came
[2:11:49] and the Army rose up
[2:11:53] and God looks ezekiel's Ezekiel
[2:11:57] you see when you looked at those people
[2:12:00] there was no hope for them
[2:12:03] there was no way
[2:12:05] there was no opportunity
[2:12:08] but God says when I looked at them
[2:12:10] I saw something completely different
[2:12:16] you were written off Saints
[2:12:19] the devil was done with you
[2:12:23] he says like the story with job he says
[2:12:25] if you remove the hedge of protection
[2:12:27] I'll get him to curse you he's like you
[2:12:29] want that won't happen
[2:12:32] so he did everything to job
[2:12:35] took his kids
[2:12:37] took his land
[2:12:39] took all this
[2:12:41] got him sick
[2:12:43] his marriage was falling apart
[2:12:47] and even though he was down to his last
[2:12:49] breath
[2:12:51] he refused
[2:12:53] to curse God
[2:12:58] will get you down to your knees if he
[2:13:01] has to
[2:13:02] he'll get you down to where you're
[2:13:04] laying in bed and all you have to do is
[2:13:05] look up to him
[2:13:07] but he's going to get your attention
[2:13:10] but that seed on the inside
[2:13:13] that was planted before the foundation
[2:13:16] of the world
[2:13:18] that seed the devil cannot touch
[2:13:23] he can make you feel your
[2:13:26] worse
[2:13:28] have you think you're the worst
[2:13:31] physically all these different things
[2:13:33] but down to it when it comes to that
[2:13:35] life on the inside
[2:13:37] God says you don't touch that life that
[2:13:39] life belongs to me
[2:13:45] we're a work in progress
[2:13:49] I thank God I'm not what I used to be
[2:13:52] and I'm on my way what he wants me to be
[2:13:55] he's not done with me yet and he's not
[2:13:57] done with him
[2:13:59] so I stand to our feet
[2:14:07] Mercy
[2:14:12] re-rolled my life
[2:14:15] [Music]
[2:14:18] Mercy
[2:14:22] rewrote my life
[2:14:27] I should have fallen
[2:14:32] my soul
[2:14:36] cast down
[2:14:39] but
[2:14:40] Mercy
[2:14:43] [Music]
[2:14:44] re-roll My Life One More Time Mercy
[2:14:53] we wrote my
[2:14:59] love Mercy
[2:15:02] [Music]
[2:15:05] rewrote my life
[2:15:09] [Music]
[2:15:11] I should have fallen
[2:15:16] my soul cast down
[2:15:23] but Mercy
[2:15:25] [Music]
[2:15:31] as they play that softly it's nothing
[2:15:33] think about that when you think about
[2:15:36] your life
[2:15:37] and what you've gone through what you've
[2:15:40] come through
[2:15:42] what a miracle it is
[2:15:45] you are a miracle of God
[2:15:47] [Music]
[2:15:48] people are looking for miracles all they
[2:15:50] have to do is just look at you and say
[2:15:53] that's a miracle of God
[2:15:55] when they say I'm looking for healing of
[2:15:57] God I'm a healing of God
[2:16:00] I'm the salvation of God I am everything
[2:16:02] that God wants I am
[2:16:06] the Bible says while we were yet sinners
[2:16:11] Christ died for us
[2:16:14] think about what that means election
[2:16:17] predestination
[2:16:19] [Music]
[2:16:20] when you are out there in the world and
[2:16:22] you drunk you were drinking your beer
[2:16:24] God looked at you and said I made the
[2:16:26] right decision about you
[2:16:28] imagine that when you were running with
[2:16:31] the wrong crowd God says I've made the
[2:16:33] right decision about you you sitting
[2:16:37] here this morning is a vindication
[2:16:40] that God made the right decision about
[2:16:43] you
[2:16:46] God will go through Great Lips
[2:16:49] through the deepest depths to find his
[2:16:53] elect
[2:16:54] and so when I reflect on what God has
[2:16:57] done in my life
[2:16:58] that's the reason why I could sing that
[2:17:00] song
[2:17:02] Mercy
[2:17:05] free
[2:17:06] [Music]
