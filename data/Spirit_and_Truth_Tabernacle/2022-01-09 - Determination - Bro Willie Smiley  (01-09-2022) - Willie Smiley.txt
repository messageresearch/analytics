amen amen let's just get our bibles out this morning it's good to be in the service of the living god this morning to remember brother jack and the family amen i guess i missed the concert i think he sent me a link i thought it was for the other day and i'll check it out later by the grace of god amen we're going to be looking at a scripture in the book of ephesians i was uh i was thinking about brother solomon as uh he was reading that the other day uh thursday it was brother burley called me and uh he was telling me about brother dwayne and he was teary and he was about making me teary uh just talking about it because man i've been knowing brother duane for about 30 years uh way we go way way back and the the crazy thing is i called brother dwayne maybe three weeks ago we talked and laughed and and when he uh when he heard me on the phone he like first ride it cause he got that deep voice what'd i do wrong i said you ain't doing that wrong man i just i just uh thought about you i thought i had heard from you a while i thought i'd give you a call and we chatted it up for about an hour laughing old times and everything and uh so when brother burley called me i was like huh he didn't mention nothing about cancer nothing like that and uh so he said man just being being prayed for him and i say i will and so uh i was at work the next day and brother burley called me and i was like oh lord i'm about 10 i'm about 10 up 92. uh um uh they tell me that he doesn't pass to something but when he caught he said brother spider you don't believe he had a 180 degree turn his body started we was praising god on the phone and he he he you know he passed it brother dwayne for a little while and he was kind of teary and everything we laughed and he said he just raised up and told people don't let the devil fool you don't let it ever fool you i tell you what almighty what a mighty god we serve amen we serve almighty god like the songs say when when it don't we we don't see him he working he he always on his job amen he never sleep or slumber ephesians chapter six now y'all pray for me this morning um i'm i i want to just kind of do something this morning by the grace of god see i pray let's look at the 10th verse we've been having some wonderful services and we've been appreciating the brother and brother troy preached a real masterpiece of the wednesday and you know what can we say like they used to say the thunders what can we say about brother jack amen brother jack has been uh putting together some things that has been um really a blessing and brother quiku and so we appreciate i just appreciate being identified with the preachers of the church and you all just being here has been one complete year i've been a part of spirit and truth uh tabernacle and uh so we we thank god for that [Applause] i i was talking to i was talking to i don't know maybe brother danny uh or could have been brother fred and they would say man you just sound uh refreshed and i say i am refreshed i ain't got to do all this preaching and i ain't got to do all the wearing i'm leaving that to somebody else so i i feel like we're starting to get on the right track we have a few months of meeting set up already and uh so y'all just continue to pray for me um it says finding my brother and be strong in the lord and in the power of his might put on the whole arm of god that she may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities power against the rulers of darkness of this world spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole arm of god that you may be able to withstand in the evil day having done all uh to stand um let's just buy our heads for a word of prayer gracious father we just come to give thanks and praise this morning for your grace and your goodness and uh your mercies to us lord you brought us uh through another year and we just in embarking on another year and uh we just want to continue to keep brother jack and the family and prayer in arizona may he just be a blessing to the saints out that way and we just thank you for uh what you've done in in the brothering and the prayer request that's before you lord thee the brother and lord god you know we know that healing is a process and may you take them through this process and and raise them up for your glory and we'd be so careful to give you praise glory and i in jesus christ's name amen amen uh you may be seated we like to uh use one word this morning uh and preach from a subject probably an odd scripture that i use but uh we'll just see how how things go uh we want to use as a subject this morning determination determination is it's the beginning of a new year and uh i didn't i didn't i didn't for the first time since i've been a christian since 1988 i didn't go to a watch tonight i was debating i was having a hard time i knew he wasn't having a service and i didn't know where to go and i had to work anyway and i just got so tired i said well lord you know uh i think i'll be all right if i miss a watch night service and uh but i in thinking about um where would i go and everything and sometimes you go places and people want you to give a word or to say something and sometimes they they they'll they'll put you on the spot doc it's on you tonight and uh so i got to studying a few things and i started looking up new year's and things that the prophet of god maybe mentioned a prayer or something like that just to have something you know if i'm called on a lot of times i don't i don't like to do little uh i'm not a sermon that type of guy or sometimes i'm not you know some brother brothers give it you know get up i i ain't built like that i need time to kind of elevate you know uh uh but as i was as i was looking at uh some quotes and different things i i ran across uh something that that brother branham uh said i thought wow that's that's that's that's needed i need that i need that because you know uh every every year has its own challenges right is that right we we no no in 30 maybe 34 years of of being a christian i don't i don't think any year has been the same my challenges uh haven't been the same but every year has been filled with challenges i've faced a lot and you all have faced a lot of of challenges we we we've there's been a lot of changes in our life whether good or bad i mean that's that's just every year has his its own thing right it has his own thing but i i i i think that you know we we can really clearly see we're in the winding up time think things is winding up and and i think you know the you know what i'm i'm grateful for that we are following a message i don't know about you but i'm grateful for that because we we could we could look at modern events from a different standpoint than the world uh we we probably had a few issues uh when we saw prophecy me and me and brother jack we kind of went to a minister's meetings and they were sharing a different thing about uh uh the vice president harris where brother branham talked about you know the prophecy of what he saw it could be a woman you know she could be president vice president or something like that to say well it could be the catholic church but she'll be wearing the purple dress and things of that nature and i don't know who posted it it could have been brother solomon uh about the this this woman from i think she was from africa and and she was she was uh echoing back the prophecy of brother branham uh uh over there and and she was seeing where the prophecy uh was being fulfilled is that right so all of these different things is just an indication of where we're at right we're further up the road than what what we once were we're we're coming closer to the change of our bodies is that right and and and we know the prophet of god he makes another statement he talks about the squeeze he talks about a squeeze and we we we're no longer looking for a squeeze they are squeezing us right but you know one thing i i've learned about pressure pressure is needed right pressure we so many so many things we we use pressure for right pressure has has its purpose it took the pressure to drive the children of israel into the homeland because they were all right they was feeling good about things life was good as long as there was a pharaoh that knew joseph and knew what joseph meant to the kingdom man the children of israel was sitting egypt wasn't all bad come on they was just kind of relaxed setting zion but there was a prophecy that had gone out right that y'all you know your children will be in a strange land for a little bitty minute but by mighty head i'm gonna bring them out and see after you know sometimes when years go by we begin to uh get sedentary and and relaxed and comfortable in in our situation and things of that nature and it took pressure god said hey dalen forgot all about it y'all stay with me now god god say god say you know looking down at the children of israel and saying man they look lately eating listen if you look at the scriptures watch when they got out of egypt and and got under pressure they said man we was not so bad we was eating garlic leaves and we had you know go look at you know the environment that they were upon it wasn't so bad but it wasn't the promise either it wasn't a promise either no my sometimes no matter how a thing look if it's not the promise come on they see that was comfortable in god god let years go by and then he god a lot of man to raise up say bro no nothing about joseph who joseph huh who's he no nothing about him and then he started to put the pressure but the pressure was working in accordance to the purpose of god god had destined for the children of israel to go into a land that was better y'all didn't hear me this morning see some sometimes i'm gonna preach this morning sometimes we get so caught up amen you know looking looking looking at the situation and sometimes looking at our past but god dropped some stuff down in my spirit uh you know last night and this morning even driving i was driving and i had to just kind of stop it the light and and pull over almost the kind of right because sometimes sometimes you know god god allows god allows things to happen in in our lives right but see here's the thing um um one of the things you you you can't look back and go forward at the same time regardless of what has happened in your past you you have got to make a choice you're going to either live in your past or you're going to live in your future that's your choice this morning i choose because i believe that my future is looking better it's going to be better see no matter what god allowed job to go through he had a whole lot of loss is that right but his future was better because god gave him a double portion right amen the one of the problems job had you know we try on being i hope i can get where i want to go we we try on beings is that right and and and because of that you know we have a a tendency of an allowing the the first two realms to dictate to us our action set our our mindsets right come on now y'all can shout shout and shout shout shout and run around and shout the devil don't care nothing about none of that huh the devil wanted to see what you gonna do amen in the midst of what you going through see he'll let you shout in church and dance on one leg and say glory to god then brother smiley preached boring i did brother jack oh brother quake woah brother troy they dropped boy they put magog and gargan but then when when god allows him to do something right he steps back and says okay i saw you i watched you shout i watch you stand up and pump your fists but what you gonna do with this how you gonna go how you gonna uh uh go through this we can't live in our emotions and fulfill the purpose of god in our lives right see i i you know i started thinking about something i've been i've been preaching for man it's been a while now maybe shoot about 30 years or so and i realize i've preached on a lot of topics i've preached on a lot of things i preached the church a book the sealed book i mean from from one aspect to the other but i realized you know that's just a gift and that's trying to feed the people but then you you have to realize okay now you're faced with something what's your response to the thing that you're facing right what's your reaction to the action right and and here's the thing right here's the thing we and we got to realize we there's spiritual warfare we we're all in a battle we're all going through something we all face through with something we we're all triumphant unless y'all something that i'm not right and and it's in it's in the outward and the inward where where we sometimes we we lose the battle right glory to god we lose the battle uh uh we we we operate not in accordance to the word and fulfilling the purpose of god is that right see i start to realize you know what even even in the scripture says forgetting those things cuz listen let's face it we can't change the past come on we cannot change what god allowed to happen in our past but we can do something about our future right i i see i can't go forward and backwards at the same time come on you know you can't drive a car amen looking amen in the review mirror and and you gonna wreck up you you'll never get to where you're going you got to look forward in order to go forward right amen you you can't you can't look backwards you got to look forward right if if we're going to fulfill you know the purpose of god in our lives uh our destiny see our destiny in god supersedes our emotions it's gotta be the word y'all didn't catch that see we could make a choice this morning to just live in our emotions in a well i'm hurt i'm i'm this and i'm that right instead of and let me tell you something church without the baptism of the holy ghost that's hard to do because it takes something to help you elevate yes you might have been hurt you know we all know we all have dealt with hurt we we've all dealt with with so many emotional uh things right but we could we could either allow those things amen to dictate to us our actions about the baptism of the holy ghost in the world we could raise up realizing man i'm here for a bigger purpose than that right amen you raise up like brother duane don't let the devil fool you see because we can be deceived in our emotions and god don't want us as believers to live in our emotions that's the preacher that's the deacons that's the lay member right preachers preachers go through stuff don't think brother jack don't go through things don't think brother troilem don't go through things we go through things right but but we we have got to we've got to raise up to fulfill the purpose of god we're we're in warfare this is this is this is real real warfare but we got to be determined we got to be determined in in the midst of listen listen in the midst of everything that's coming against the the the believer the entire world we got to be determined right and to be determined is the definition is defined as a firm intent what you're intending on doing what you're intending on accomplishing right i was as i've been talking i was thinking about sister bernice i hope she don't mind me using her in in this uh that sister right there is one of the most determined sisters that i think i've ever seen right i i've passed it i passed it up for 20 some years i've been around her for 30 some years i've watched on highs i've i've watched her in the midst of loss i've watched in the midst of some of everything but you you know uh i've watched her i watched you know she had a desire to to be a nurse but she's a nurse because of determination i watched i i watched her i watched i think she she kind of flunked out of class if you don't mind me saying that praise the lord excuse me she kind of i'll put it to you like this she kind of got knocked off the horse she dusted herself off got right back on determined to ride away to being a nurse huh amen for a lot of folk they would have quit there's a lot of people that's giving up right quitting walking away but she was determined she had a firm impact and it's been bittersweet right the thing to think of all of the things that you know you go through and you get knocked down but you you you get back up right because it's like i i'm i'm intending on right becoming a nurse if i got to be a nurse at 80 i'm going to be a nurse if ain't nothing else but have a degree that says nurse i'm gonna get it i'm determined right come on i'm determined a firm intent a decision which has been made has been reached right what kind of decisions do have we made have we given up right have we quit you you you can't be a quitter and determined at the same time there's got to be something in you that that that's a bounce back even when you get punched to heart i still like that little balloon thing when i was a kid man it was weighted at the bottom and bobcat how hard you hit it how you laid on it when you got a profit it stood right back up huh man [Music] it'll weeble wobble but it won't fall down it'll lean over and it'll stand back up that's real determination i've been hit hard but i'm still standing can you say that i suffer loss but i'm still see when when the devil has done certain things he said my god this this is a hard folk this this ain't this for some folk he can push over and they just never get up right we you're watching people right now today just falling away giving up quitting everybody's in a battle don't think that that you're something special you're the only one you'll get to talking sometimes to people and you realize man they going through more than what i'm going through my god i thought i thought i was going through something none of us has been on the death bed this year come on i ain't been in icu i started out last year uh with covey right dizzy but god brought me through amen i started out last year the beginning of last year pastoring the church by the next week and last year i wasn't a pastor no longer right y'all don't mind if i preach this morning let me tell y'all something here's here's a y'all i don't know if y'all i'm a realistic preacher i like to deal with realistic things i ain't sugar coated so don't ever expect me to sugarcoat for you right i try to watch y'all feelings because i know sometimes yeah i'm a little strong but but listen listen listen there's emotional ties to all of that come on church come on and sometimes sometimes you just got to make a choice that i'm not gonna allow my emotions not preaching by experience this morning right because things can happen so unexpected right amen when i started out amen 23 years ago i thought i'd still be pastoring this year right but i'm an associate i'm fine that's not what i'm preaching but just to show you just just to show you things can happen and listen realistically i've been last year i was on an emotional roller coaster right sometimes people can can smile and shake hands and going through emotionally right amen i was in a place i ain't know what to do right i didn't know whether you know i had a multiple of invitations i took none i preached when i went out with brother jack a few times because i was i was going through an emotional battle right and that was my problem i made it emotional come on man in in my emotions and my feelings instead of instead of taking the word but i ain't doing that this year [Music] i i was determined that either i either right now this is what i said to myself either right now you're going to get out of your feelings and get out of your emotions and do what god has called you to do and that's the preach right are you just going to sit here and wallow in your emotions and i say i ain't never been a wallowa i've always been a fighter if you jump on me i'll fight you back that's right well i'm a christian yeah just don't jump on me cause i'm gonna get you up off of me if nothing else i might not plummet you but it's the oh y'all will too oh praise the lord somebody about to kill you oh praise the lord i mean christian just stop it sister wasting a fight if you jump on her she ain't with a hundred pounds probably soaking wet but she'll get you a profile is that right sister waisted hey after that i'm i'm like here why should we here die no i'm gonna get you back if nothing else i'ma get you apart from me if it ain't nothing but long enough to get my feet to moving but we we have got to be determined right it's got to be intentional brother jack said that that's right right come on church see this the beginning of the year let me keep it uh we got to be intentional right set you know set our face like flint i shall not be moved right i'm intentional this year right we we one of the things i'm i i'm learning like i said i've been a christian for a good while but those things has nothing to do with it how long you been a christian i've been saved sanctifying holy ghost field how about okay yeah that sounds good to tell that to somebody who ain't been nowhere don't know much right that's a part of it y'all just y'all have to follow me right but but okay and being a christian and amen in the word things of that nature how are we operating right and so you know i had to take a a step back sometimes and say uh all right buddy you don't preach the lie here's where you went here's what you face and what we gonna do with that and it's all about a choice it's all it's all about choices and it's it takes god now it takes god to speak to you and it takes god to help you or you'll be consumed come on that's the heart's reality you know just like god was working on brother dwayne i like the scripture said that he talks about he's standing in the midst of the seven golden candle sticks and in the church age book he said he's not standing there and it's just a you know just uh like an onlooker god is at work we certainly saw when you don't see him he's working he never stopped thank you jesus he never he never he never he never he never stops working right sometimes sometimes you know uh sister birds just sing this song when i don't feel nothing cause sometimes it's like you just feel bad sometimes you feel like you've been forsaken by god and and sometimes here's the thing why we've been getting to ask god why see i'm going somewhere church we we i ain't got that yet but i'm going somewhere i'm still i'm still on a journey right we we this if god is i'm gonna say something here if god is allowing us to have allowed us to go through something or if we're going through something it's all for a purpose right god will ultimately get you where he's trying to get you because the footsteps of the righteous is ordered by the lord right and sometimes you know we we look at we look at uh oh god i'm trying to think now he just he jumped off the boat y'all helped me jonah there we go somebody read the bible huh jonah john went i like you know what i thank god for for inspiration because because a lot of people they look at jonah but we had a prophet right we had a prophet jonah thought he was escaping the commission huh but he was right in the will of god jumping over boy huh he thought well i'm out of here them people down there rough i'm not going down up in there god i say but god in his mind say you going you going and when you get there they gonna hear you because when you're when you when you arrive and you step out the wells the whales belly see that was their god so so when when they saw when they saw a man jonah's stepping walk out and get him to decree of god they say wait a minute wait a minute it's more than just a man speaking here it caused them it caused them to repent and cyclots and ashes and then job got mad cause they repented a lot joke noah not noah either jonah y'all help me huh see what he thought sometimes sometimes we might think like you know just seem like i've been sidetracked no the footsteps of the orders are the righteous is the order of the lord see god don't tell you everything all at once god wants us to walk by faith and be determined that you know what i'm i'm i'm when it even don't when it don't even look like it i feel like i'm still in the will of god even when i don't completely know what the perfect will of god is for me right now i i i i can do one or two things i could just sedentary i know brother branham says you know the bride don't move till she got thus said to lord see we take all of these quotes and sometimes we take things out of context too right uh god god wants us because he said it just should walk live by faith and so sometimes god wants us to walk by faith and not by sight brother bible said he got in a lot of trouble because he was always sitting around waiting on god to show him something right y'all heard that nah now i'm preaching off my head my inspiration so but somebody got a computer we could pull it up for you right but we we've got to be determined right amen so he says this uh determination is defined as a firm intent or a decision which has been reached an example determined is the strength to keep applying for jobs after being turned down by a dozen potential right because you can get so discouraged but you say what somebody is going to give me a chance see having a strong feeling that you are going to do something that you will not allow anyone or anything to stop you right and and that's the way that we got to live as christians church nothing is going to be handed to us right amen see it's it's it's uh uh not weak or uncertain right or having having a show of determination brother branham he says in here in jesus christ's name i mean in shalom what i'm talking about lord help us in the message shalom in 1964 he said oh lord let me stay with the word let me tell you something church when i read that i said that's that's a real powerful statement see maybe y'all don't y'all should understand it whether you're a preacher don't are not a preacher it's difficult to stay with the word more difficult than we realize see as as a as a man of god because we've seen it scripturally where servants of god has has uh bit the word or left the word because of the pressure right right look look at look at uh saul right the people's the people's king right under under the pressure he did something that the word told him not to do god god said sent the messenger down said you saw and saul was like man what you talking about not me man i did everything that god said dude i would say what's all that bleating that the sheep then what's all of that that well then then watch what he do with the people the the pressure see y'all don't even really know the pressure of a pastor the the the the pressure of the people and you're trying to you know y'all pray for brother jack it's not easy this is a very diverse group of people we've all come from different backgrounds we all educated different cultures and it's it's hard to just try to uh keep a balance right and because every individual and every individual in that family is different right come on husbands and wives y'all might be together as a union but most often you've been raised up different from different backgrounds come on church different backgrounds right but but god brought you together from a union and and over here this one might have been hurting this and that from his daddy and over here this one might have been hurt from his mama and god brings them a man together in a union and then he places them in spirit and true tabernacle and say brother duff they're yours feed them by inspiration feed them bring them to this place of maturity because you're out of the ephesians 4 ministry feed them and he get up quite scratches his head and say lord what am i going to do and that's why you got to depend on the world see as a shepherd even as a minister you cannot be an emotional person you you can't allow the emotions of the church to dictate your actions or you're going to be in trouble come on i'm going to let y'all on a secret right when i shepherded i was probably harder on family members than i was on lap other folk why because people was gonna look at how he treating his family i'm preaching now y'all don't quit on me huh how what is he gonna do about his family how is he going to handle his family look look at look at look at you know the priests the eli look how he handled his family his sons was ravishing taking the money from the people and everything else and he just kind of sat there come on when it it was his job to to to correct right that the hardest part about this is because it's so many emotions and and so many things and and and man you know people are easily offended it makes it difficult come on maybe y'all don't know what i'm talking about it makes it difficult to to stay in the middle of the road with the work because that's the only thing that's going to bring change that's the only thing that's going to rapture i'm going somewhere now right watch watch this see we we take a a simple statement we just say well no it's a depth because we in between the lines this morning right let me let me stay with him the word right come on church now put yourself in the minister's place because we have all of these expectations for the ministry but y'all real quiet on me huh we we we place all of these expectations on the ministry well you know brother jack got to have this standard and if he move away from that man let me tell you and sister erica she has to maintain this certain you know uh status and and then we get real legalistic and the bible says right a bishop oh then we start quoting the scripture we start quoting the scripture when it's the when it's the bishop and the bishop wife and then when it's the deacon because his qualification is kind of the same right well you know they supposed to be hospitable and and and this and they supposed to do this and they supposedly died but things change when it comes to us well praise the lord brothers come on preach with me lights glory to god about the priests of the lights because y'all ain't gonna preach with me this morning come on that that's a powerful statement more powerful than we than we realize right glory to god see if he has to stay with the word then we have to stay with the word see apart from the word fulfilling the purpose of god is not a void you'll never be able to do it that's right and see let's take our expectations we all we listen we're in a battle now right because the word can't change for you and it means one thing for you and another thing for you and another thing for this family and another thing for that family and y'all blame brother jack he he got me up here so president he told me he wanted me to do this i was trying to back out but he said no nobody ain't gonna let you do it right let me stay with the word not now this is new this is new year thought right from shalom he said let oh let me stay with him the word watch this and manifest his light right right the word is light right the the manifested word is light in its age when we can see it it ain't light when you can't see it it's light when you can see it see church i'm never preaching religion and i you know really realistically i'm not even preaching to y'all flesh i can work y'all up that's easy right but i try to deal with the seed of the soul and bring the reality from the word because that's light that's light and if we're ever going to manifest anything it's got to come from the word right see i even me on a personal note i can't sit back and and you know all it is it's like it's not gonna work for me like that come on the same god that deals with me got to be dealing with you in the same line right right look son you know your pity parties and your emotions and and and your why's and all of that forget about that stuff bro forget about that stuff here's the harsh reality you just got to be determined is that right intentional to move forward if if something happened god allowed it had to happen if she said this and he said that if they did this god allowed them to do that right the same god that allowed that allowed job to go through the same god that's allowing you to go through right but here's the thing that's a double portion at the end of the trial right there's a manifestation after the trial take your child up and and and you know offer him up all right wow big trial final test but then once he says and and manifests his life through all of us as we set forth in this new year with a determination that's all of us right because you know what there's there's parts of me that that that will not go anywhere i watch everything y'all probably watch me but i watch y'all too i watch people i watch people as they come and go i watch people as they hit and miss right well praise the lord come on lights and then you know i wonder what's wrong so what well what's wrong okay why this why i question a lot i sit in that back over there and i'm in my business my mind i've been there i don't bother nobody huh but it's just the wheels it's it's you know it's it's the watchman in the tower watchmen what of the night come on now watch me one of the night well [Applause] it look is all right see the watchman is trained right to detect whether or not it's the enemy are they coming in peace right glory to god it came watch me why didn't i oh that's just jayhew come on see the watchman is trained the watchman brother jack has been trained over what 20 years 20 years of trial and error trained as the watchman in the tower to watch over your souls right to try to make sure that you don't get in the local weed come on train that little phone call hey god bless you hey i ain't seen you in a week little gesture wondering if y'all miss a few services don't think that that brother jack ain't like wheels ain't turning he may not even say nothing you ever but he's talking to god about it and god dropping down in his spirit this is what it is that is what it that is what it is is that right brother quaker no i'm talking about he passed to the church right amen if if god allows shepherd to be blind sight blindsided it's for a purpose sometimes he don't always reveal everything amen i'm trying to go somewhere i still this watch working so i still got a little time y'all bear with me praise the lord but he says we as we set forth this new year with a determination watch this not knowing what this year holds we don't we don't we don't know what this year hold but we're holding to him and that's the word amen amen all right see listen church let's let's let's think about something who would have thought we'd be sitting up in churches with masks on all that kind of stuff but here here's where we that's the harsh reality right and and just everything you know uh uh uh and i'm not against nothing but just hear me out right just hit me out for a second right we can't see sometimes it's a forcing but it's working for our good they force kind of indirectly force us all to take these shots and all that and then after a while and there's nothing wrong with it that's not what i'm saying then after a while they say you need a booster and then they then they almost want to tell you that that what you took ain't even no good just trying to get another kind of shot because because when when when one thing right and here's what we got to keep in mind the lid of hell has been loose here's the good thing though all of god come down too i'm going somewhere but but as soon as one thing calmed down they i lose something else we we dealt with covet covert coleman 19. and then then they they get watch this terminology means something variant right first it was coveted 19. when that started dying down and everybody started kind of trying to get back to normal then they got come out with a variant huh then then that start dying now now we got what's that omni yeah they be naming it they already got names for all of foolishness it's just devils that they unleash right and and see it's a part of the squeeze but we got a third pool huh see let me tell y'all something when when you think it's okay to get from under this eagle of anointing you have been deceived because this is the thing that's been ordained to carry you through the pressure this this eagle anointing has been on gain right it's the thing that carries me when i can't carry myself [Applause] huh glory to god so you know we should sing that song how can i walk away huh glory to god you you can't walk away from god come on church god realizes listen church if we you know brother jack been preaching on understanding if we really understand what this message has come to do not just to make us smart and deep preachers but but to give us something to be able to withstand the onslaught of the enemy in this age one thing after another thing just another variation of another devil that's been loosed against us but all of god come down is that right in the form of the revealed word come on how can i walk away i can't how i'm gonna make it by the word come on church see you know people people people you just watch some time it's like church we kidding ourselves people that have walked away and things of that nature maybe maybe some of them haven't been apart some of them are that ain't for me to know because i can only work out my own soul salvation with fear and trembling but but i realized personally my walk is a personal walk it's it's gonna take this revealed word this eagle anointing to get me through this age of gross darkness if y'all listened to the message of shalom the other night brother branham talked about how dark dark it was is that right it's dark for the world but it's peace it's light come on rise and shine light has come the glory of the lord has risen thank god for the glory of the lord that is risen upon me now y'all got to say that i rose because of the light brother bantam say brother man say people want to do writing cake people want to do right but kate the only reason you can live right is because of the work because because outside of the word you can't live right amen you can't live right outside of the word no man can we keep ourselves because of the word it's the word that's keeping us i know y'all think y'all something and and all of that and praise the lord let me tell you something no that's nothing if god take his holy spirit from us we'll be messed up just like everybody else in the world it's god that keep brothers smiling not brother smiley keep in himself [Applause] god has kept me since the day i came to this word right amen no matter how the devil fight god keeps me because i'm a part of him i was an attribute in the mind of god before the foundation of the world [Music] let me keep going praise the lord amen not knowing what this this new year holds but we're holding to him the word that no watch this that knows the the whole symphony from the beginning to the end he's the writer of it right we'll power this great symphony symphony right amen he knows every move every junction right we're just watching him keeping our eyes on him right let me tell you something that's the only way we're going to get down to the end right you know sometimes people look at you and they wonder well you know this brother brother told a story about the young boy who won the bicycle and and and he probably didn't look like much didn't look like he was gonna make it come on talk to me somebody didn't look like he was gonna make it and all these folk with pride and and all of this kind of stuff they got on a little bicycle and they got to ride down to the end and fell off this one get on lift it up fell off this one got fell off fell off and it's that unlikely person right didn't probably look like much didn't you know act like he didn't really know much he got on that thing and just ruled all the way to the end got his bicycle and and and all the people that was lifted up and everything around him you know they're like let me talk to you for a minute man how you do that he said see the problem y'all had y'all was looking to the side y'all was looking at this he said you know what i wasn't looking at none of that i wasn't looking at one on the left i wasn't looking there on the right i was just looking at that bicycle i was looking at that box at the end and i just got on that thing and i just wrote i said and i claimed my prize because amen i was just looking to the end i was looking to the prize at the end i wasn't looking at that i wasn't looking at well he got to this point and he fell off and he got to that point and he fell off and she got to that point she fell off no i had my eyes on the coming of the lord i felt bad to see them brother troy y'all gonna make me preach up in here huh he just had his eyes on the end we got a man be intentional determined keep our focus watch because our emotions here's a thing can be a distraction from the from the purpose of god we can get so wrapped up in self and po me and pity me and they don't know what i've been through don't nobody really care come on come on sitting around and waiting on folk to pat you on your back a lot of times we don't even need sympathy we need determination [Applause] if i've been waiting on most of these people to pat me on the back forget about it i'll be been to the house somewhere probably back on the street somewhere getting high chasing women come on preach with me somebody but emotions is a distraction amen from the reality of god and what god has for you i believe god regardless of regardless of anything i still believe the best is yet to come we used to sing that song right since the time back in the day brother west coast the best is yet to come i remember brother jack i'm feeling good now i can't normally move like this until i get anointed huh man and brother jack you know y'all know blendtec is a little dance uh we used to dance back then i still feel like dancing this morning cause i realized the best is yet to come i am determined [Applause] i'm determined to reach the end that's right i'm determined to get the best that this life has to offer i'm trying to rip it out of the hands of the devil that's been holding on to it for far too long [Applause] the development holding on to amen what god has promised us for far too long [Applause] and he ain't trying to give it to you you gotta go over there and take it [Applause] take it out of the hands i don't know what it is but you gotta take it amen we gotta take it out of the hands of the enemy i'm determined i'm determined right i'm determined to continue to watch my ministry elevate i'm watching doors open people that said they they wouldn't preach me now they're ready to preach to me glory to god when the world the devil thought that my world was all topsy-turvy and all of that and then i was finished and y'all know you know y'all know y'all know how people is god said not so that was just his season that was just his season my season is changing huh were you worried about your wife nope god got hurt god got my children is that right glory to god amen if the word is right then everything has got to line up with the word is that right glory to god well what's happening to gina she going through a test is that right but god's gotta god's got my children i raised my children in church and they might be okay oh i hope y'all don't y'all forgive me cause y'all get nervous when i talk like that oh i ain't bashing them but it's the truth i'm not worried about them god got them everything you know what i'm here today it could be y'all tomorrow so be careful what you're thinking what you say be careful i'm here because god allowed me to be here right amen but you know what i'm determined amen to be intentional right to watch things change this is a season for change right i mean listen it got to we can't listen hold up stop wait a minute we can't stay in the schoolhouse and get the promise at the same time at some point god's got to open the door for us to leave here because this is only a temporary a temporary dwelling see and and and you know just like there over there that was only temporary that was for a 19-year season we don't realize this is just a part of the journey to the next phase but watch brother jack his determination every every week every other week he he comes up and he starts out and he start talking about that church in that school huh see you got to speak it before you see it let me tell you something this i'ma say this this there's a lot of and it shouldn't be this way because it's the word but this is the reason why

behind us and we won't write nancy not one not one right god be sitting there like if you adopted you got the checkbook write it what you what whatever what you want jack said church in the school and

carrying the burdens of the people for a long time i wouldn't even talk to my pastor about what i was going through because i saw what he was going through made it hard for me to even confide with brother jack when i moved here but we should be praying for them all the time all the time you don't know how these brothers their hearts beat for you they live and die to feed you they give their all labor before the lord just to bring you a message to give you something to sustain you till the next time they can bring you something else to sustain you we need to pray for our brethren always
