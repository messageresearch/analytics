of a doubt that that great eye opener is here What did he say in the book of Revelation he said by of me I said that I staff is Revelation friends the only way that you're going to be able to see Jesus Christ today or any other day is that he would open your eyes is that right glory to God was I'm sitting here in the back room just playing and just trying to seek the Lord a little bit and hearing the great songs of Zion friends I know without a shadow of a doubt that Jesus Christ is here you know why he's here because he said he would be here is that right glory to God he said whether two or three would be gathered together in my name I that's a personal pronoun I will be in their midst that's Jesus's promise to you now friends what could come before you this morning with death with sickness with sin drug abuse alcoholism what could come before you when Jesus Christ is here glory to God I tell you what we've come to have Church here this morning hallelujah [Music] hallelujah oh my [Music] thank you Jesus gracious Heavenly Father truly you're here this morning and it's your great amazing grace Heavenly Father that you have reached down that great hand to us dear God growing up in church all my life I remember him singing a song when he reached down his hand for me Oh God I was once lost I was once deep and sinned the muck and mire this world but Lord Jesus you saw something inside of there that you wanted dear Heavenly Father I'm so thankful for that this morning Heavenly Father Lord as I stand before this group of believers here in West Palm Beach Lord I I just know without a shadow of a doubt that Lord there's people here this morning that have heard the great call of Jehovah Eagle Lord I know that you here this morning Heavenly Father and it does great it does my heart such good to know that there's a light shining in this part of this country Lord when the world around us is bleak and dark but Lord you said a lighthouse here it's spirit of life Tabernacle with brother Jack Duff is the pastor here Lord you shining your light to a world that's lost and dying now dear God my prayer is this morning Lord that you would just be with us Lord and part your word to us your believers near God and Lord speak through me I'm just a man I can't do anything but when Jesus Christ is here that's what makes the difference your word says that I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me sweet Jesus we also just want to remember brother Jack up there and I believe he's in ocala this morning just be with our precious brother Lord anoint him and may the services go really really well and may you dear God just use your servant maybe just to reach up to that last that little lost sheep that last one world room it would be maybe it'd be there this morning Heavenly Father but just you your servant brother Jack this morning Everly father's up where we love you dear God and we commit ourselves to you now and Jesus wonderful name we pray amen so if you turn in your Bibles we're just going to read one quick verse there this morning and you can have your seats revelations chapter 19 verse 7 it's good to see everybody this morning by the Jack mentioned there may be some visitors different ones here this morning so we just want to make you all welcome I want to speak on this morning by the grace of God make preparation make preparation so revelation 19 verse 7 says this let us be glad and rejoice and give honor unto Him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready and his wife has made herself ready may the Lord at his blessing to the reading his word this morning you can have your seats now he says this the prophet of God says this the hour has come his bride has made herself ready Oh made herself ready she laid aside all the things remember Esther was chosen and the others was rejected and only those that's born again that's got the Spirit of God will be chosen that day that the crown of glory will be set upon her head and all others will be rejected my so what he's saying here is the selected the one that has been elected and selected by Almighty God that clean-living little lady that's put on the robes of his righteousness not anything that she could offer him is that right we know that Cain tried that very same thing he tried to bring his fruit he tried to do it his way and we find that many churches are doing that today they're saying God we're gonna serve you our way friends it don't work that way you've got to come God provided way and we know that that's through Christ and Christ is the word you can only come Christ's way amen the way of the word let's just turn in our Bibles this warning to Matthew 25 very very familiar passage of Scripture nonetheless it's very very beautiful Matthew 25 verse 1 then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took the lamp and went forth to meet the bridegroom in front and five excuse me five of them were wise and five foolish and they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept and at midnight now notice it was at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps and the foolish said unto wise give us of your oil for our lamps have gone out but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and then and and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut afterward came also the other virgin saying Lord Lord open to us but he answered and said verily I say unto you I know you not watch therefore for you know for you know neither free I'm sorry what watch therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh so our subject manner this morning is be prepared now in this parable Jesus is talking to two different groups of people is that right he's talking to two different churches no doubt the one was a good living lady the Bible says she was a virgin she had received through the world in the things of the world she was brother Brandon was very clear he said she's a clean living lady so he's talking to two different groups here no doubt good I want to get that through your mind this morning she was good she was a girl right but friends she had something lacking in her life she was lacking something she was lacking that token that would take her from here and get her to there although she was good she was lacking the oil and we all fully understand that the oil is the typify does the Holy Ghost is that right so although she was good she didn't go all the way in with God and received the baptism but the Holy Ghost in her life friends without the Holy Ghost without that token without the new birth without being adopted sons and daughters of God you stay right here and go through the tribulation that's all there is do you say brother Joel that's awfully hard preaching my friend's dad is none other than but the Word of God there was one that God laughed friends I pray with all of my heart this morning that I'm talking to a group of people the heeding the call of God in your life if you've not made that decision if you've not gone all the way in with Christ do it now while you still have a chance while there's still breath in your body you have a chance to serve Almighty God you know I grew up in this message my great-grandparents were message believers my grandpa's my parents raised me in church some of the same church meetings of brother Jack was in I was in as a young man didn't know brother Jack then he didn't know me you know probably literally thousands of people back then but you know what that did for me it made me a good boy I'm not saying that it made me a real good boy but that wasn't good enough at that point in my life I was foolish virgin at best foolish virgin the best but when I was 20 years old the Lord Jesus Christ dropped down into my car where I was I wasn't looking for God he was looking for me he says you're my and you're not going down that path anymore Joel you're gonna serve me from this day forward now I'd like to tell you from that day forward I never send another day in my life I'm glad like to tell you I never made a mistake I never did nothing wrong but that means that'd be a lie you know why cuz we're still in flesh we're still in Tabernacles the flesh that are never born again when you live here you don't take that with you aren't you glad you don't oh my you've got a glorified body one like it under his old body man that ought to do something for us glory to God a word body one was wise one was foolish although a good person so many people tell you today I'm a northerner I had a brother introduced me one time he says if you ever never seen a ganky this is what they look like and he pointed at me I felt that we're all brothers and sisters you know the foot of the cross is level when we get there friends I'm gonna be with you you're gonna be there with me we're gonna be with all the saints globally from every Church age all the way down through in that right hey man and at that point we can all say that we came from the mind of God there was not some geological place we came from here we're up do we have eternal representation we were with him in the beginning and if I was with him then I've got to go back so the Bible says that Christ bride has made herself ready you understand there's something you've got to do you've got to do something the bride has made herself ready now I love the story that he tells about the armoire company you're familiar with the story the rich man from Chicago his daddy owned all these different ranches and things like that and this young man he come of age and he was quite frankly seeking a wife and he wanted somebody that reflected his innermost being somebody that would be like him have his same values have his same goals somebody that would raise his children in a christ-like manner somebody that would have that token applied over her door and there would be us a soldier with him and work alongside of him so he goes on this journey he goes on this search he says I've got to find her if God put this yearning inside of me she's out there somewhere so I'm going to look for he goes out west and they knew he was coming they knew he was coming to look for his wife and boy they all dressed stopping oh my back in the Old West and they oh brother Branham says that they just really had their six shooters on their sides and the ladies hall painted their faces and did all these things and look just like the world and tried to attract this boy because he was rich he said to himself not gonna have this back in Chicago I didn't come looking for that he was walking the streets of the town one day and he sees this little girl come out of the back of the place dressed in rags she was an orphan there was nothing to look upon her her visit she would say oh she's beautiful oh man that's the one that Hill for sure pick she's an orphan she couldn't say that my daddy owns this and my mama has such a social standing or anything like that she comes out with the wash water dishpan hands maybe water downer that's how I get when I'm washing dishes just water done just wetting and she walks out with that pot of dirty dishwater and she throws it out something caught his eye so whoo that's what I'm looking for somebody that's not afraid to just get down and dirty in life and to raise a family and to ratio now something that's worried about breaking oh we gotta have a nanny that's not what he was looking for he was looking for real true character and character real truth character is what it's fit to rule he wanted a lady that would rule his home well the next day he didn't say anything to these these are out there again but this time he's standing in front of the gate because he wants her to see him oh Jesus want you to see him he's coming Plainview he wants you to know him oh my so this time he gets in her way he says excuse me do you know who I am oh she's kind of bashful she's kind of shy she just kind of yeah I know I know who you are scare in the perfume don't smell the greatest and she kind of cowered down he says do you know why I've come here yeah I know why you're here sir he says I've come looking for a wife and I see something in you oh my he saw something in her that he wanted the world cannot produce that the world could not give that to him he says sweetheart will you marry me Oh glory to God sweetheart will you marry me she says yes yes I mean this great man has come down from his glorious palace this beautiful place and he comes down Stoops down and human flesh and he says will you marry me she says well yes what do I have to lose this great prince has come down he says I want you she says yes I'll marry you he says let me tell you something I'm gonna give you my word I promise you one year from today one year from now he didn't say one hour that they are one minute or one second he just said one year from today I'm coming back and you be ready I'm coming back and you be ready oh my the joy bells and her soul begin to ring he fits me now you know what the other denominational girls didn't see that happen they didn't know they didn't see him go to her why because it was a personal revelation just too hot he can't justify glory he came to her so will you marry me she says yes I believe you what you were so one year from today sir fine sir I will be ready oh man she began to put her wash money together her nickels her dimes or whatever she made she says he's coming back for me all the other girls begin to make fun of her she says I don't have one and I don't care he promised me he's coming back and I believed them no matter their ridiculing no matter the scuffing no matter their mocking she says he promised me and I believe it he's coming back he's a man of his word I know he is a year later she gets her trunk maybe just a little bag of some sort plops it down on the porch and I bet she was out there before the Sun come up in her wedding dress prepare to meet him you know 5:00 in the morning he was still dark she sits there waiting on him to come looking down the road no no no comes along the other girls just now begin to wake up and what are you doing out there on the porch and that wedding dress boy you looks at you know they tell you you look silly too they tell you that you look a little old-fashioned they tell you that you look funny oh but you're a reflection of the glory of God don't let the world tell you you look funny they're the ones that have changed not you you go back a hundred years ago the girls look like you the men look like you they have to like you they talk like you they're the ones that are out of their minds guy pull up next to me yesterday and I'm just in my little family van and his music was shaking my car and they might think I'm crazy watch are you why if it's shaking my car what's it doing to his head I can't be healthy noon comes along 1 2 3 o'clock 4 o'clock of the other girl she looks at her wedding dress it's not even a good wedding dress it's just some white plain thing I mean we could have got one with gold and sparkles and glitter on he's not looking for glitter and sparkles he's looking for real true true holiness the gospel this is sparkly all the clothes and she was glowing with the glory of Almighty God you understand what I'm saying this morning midnight five minutes to midnight they begin to poke their heads out the windows of the little house I see you're still waiting yes he promised he promised he was coming I'm taking him at his word one minute to midnight she hears the buckboard coming down the road the gravel rattling underneath the wheels of that of that buggy he says I'm here honey she leaps off the porch he might have left that old bag there she didn't need it anyhow where she was going he had more clothes and more things that she could ever imagine she didn't need to take the things of the world with her she was going to her heavenly home with her heavenly bridegroom but you know she took him at his word she believed him now in our church back in Sarasota we've had a one wedding take place and we've got a couple others that are coming up upon us real real shortly and the wedding coordinators and different ones are getting though getting the wedding getting this great celebration ready to happen and it got to thinking about that you know the church gets decorated and everything's in order you know the tencel the tulle the tulips whatever you have whatever kind of decorations you like it's all prepared the groomsmen are here the bridesmaids are here you know maybe brother Jack is here in his nicest suit and he's got his Bible standing here ready to marry this couple the groom is standing here and you know friends he's looking better than he's never looked in his life he might be 20 years old and they took my five showers but last night was one of them he's got his teeth all brushed and he's smelling better than he's ever smelled before why because he come down to his wedding night wedding day rather he's got his teeth brushed he even wore dirt that's what that stuff's called yeah he even wore that because he wants to look good all dressed up in his rental tux he don't even realize that half the pictures he ain't even be in but there he stands ready everything's completely ready the the piano player the sisters and different ones are softly playing the wedding music and everything is in order but it's time for the bride to enter the building but think about this maybe she didn't prepare maybe she didn't prepare for this wedding maybe she slept in that day and comes to the church with her hair just sticking up every which direction that's kind of a style nowadays but it shouldn't be her hair just sticking up everywhere she's wearing an old jeans skirt that looks like she slept in the thing and a t-shirt maybe on backwards and oh what sneakers look like she walked on top of him that walked in him and shows up at the back of the church in town don't it on they open the doors and there she see his popping bubble up she didn't come prepared know that boys standing here may hate me presented his best he's got a place to take her he done worked hard everybody every bit of money that he's made the last six months is going to prepare a home for her and to put everything in it that he thinks she likes he's gonna find out shortly that there's some things that he missed I missed a can opener I thought I had it all I had two forks I had two knives I had two spoons where she can't hurt me she's like but he's done everything and here she comes maybe he begins to think to himself what kind of home I thought I knew her what cut if she didn't prepare this for me she didn't prepare any better for me how's she gonna care for my children what kind of wifey what kind of soulmate is she gonna be how is it gonna be our life together because you understand marriages till death do we part and that vow binds you to one another forever that's what he said he's gonna think what am I getting myself into what am I doing here if she didn't prepare but no he wants to see her in that gown I'll never forget I've been married almost 16 years my oldest son Jonathan sitting here with me today my traveling buddy I'll never forget the day that they open that door now you may look at my wife use most most of you've seen her you may look here and say well that's just sister see whatever you know 36 year old lady whatever three children but when I see her when I see her I see her the day I did on our wedding day I see when that door opened and I saw the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in my life and I can say like she's not even here I'm a trying to flatter the most beautiful thing I ever seen in my life they opened that double doors and there stood her daddy one of my best friends loved brother John Stephen he's gone to be with the Lord now but though I see her that way and you know Jesus Christ sees you that way like he did at the very beginning of time before time ever began before the foundation of the world is that right you were with him amen now the Bible is very clear what kind of a bride the Christ is gonna come back for when he returns it's very clear what type of a lady was she will be in how she will be dressed and how she adorns herself she loves him therefore she is obedient to his word no denomination no preacher no friend no family member no child can convince her to leave this word she is abiding by every word that God spoke is that right not compromising on any part of it you see when you compromise on the Word of God now listen to me when you compromise on the Word of God you take away the fact of the word in your life you can't just obey part of it you've got it the whole book John a type of the bride a revelation tan he was to take not just the parts of the book that he wanted he said take the book and eat it up in friends it was an open book it was revealed is that right let me say it like this a hybrid word cannot produce the Bride of Christ I've had so many tell me how many people tell me that they just didn't think that God meant what he said in his word friends that's sad jesus said I will have a bride this without spot or wrinkle her sins washed completely away in the depths of his of the depths of the sea friends in his friend and his forgetfulness you know he cannot even reveal your sin was forgiven he cannot even reveal your sin to his prophet he can't there was a little girl one time going through the Prophet the prayer line and man she'd been going behind her mom and dad's back smoking cigarettes and she didn't want her mama to know that what kid does is doing things like that and uh she sees the discernment take place and and brother Brandon begins to tell the person in front of her all about her life and she says oh my oh my is for him to tell mom in this little church what I've been doing so she kind of repents in her heart dear Jesus please forgive me I don't ever want to do that no more God please forgive me you know what you stood before the Prophet it was gone he never once brought it up you know why because he can't it is gone friends that's a revelation I talked to a man one time and he believed in God he believed thing you know on his level he believed things pretty good but he told me because I'm trying to get him to come to church and man it seemed like he was grasping things he says but you know what he says I can't come I've been too bad I can't come he says I've just done too many things in my life I said don't you believe in the power you brothers sing about it this morning there's power in the blood of Jesus he says yeah I believe there's power in the blood of Jesus for you but he couldn't believe it for me he believed it for me but he couldn't believe it for himself and I thought to myself how sad a life how sad him in existence is that thinking that he's just gone too far friends you can't go too far as a predestinated seat of god you can't go too far your children if they leave this assembly they can't go farther than what the arm of the Lord Jesus Christ who reach out turn them around and bring them back you've got loved ones out there you've got children that have left you hold on to that profession you hold on to your faith in Jesus Christ you put them before the blood put them under the blood of Jesus Christ apply the token for them before they can apply for themselves you be their Holy Ghost until they get it for themselves and then watch God move friends it may not happen when you want it oh you want to hear right and I do too but friends when that eagle flies over speaks right to that one it's like I'm coming home I'm coming home I was that one that's how I know talking to a man recently now we're construction I was talking to a man recently but it was talking about the tribulation and he said that uh he says you know the tribulation is about to start are you ready I said yeah I'm ready and I didn't realize he was one of these prepper people that him got himself three and a half years worth of food I'll tell you what I don't know it's gonna be like six months after eating cold peas but that's what he's planning on doing got him a generator and gasoline stocked up and he lives out in Timbuktu and he says I said brother that is not how I'm preparing I'm preparing right now my time I purging is right now he says you're going through the tribulation I said no no the Bible promises a rapture he says now Isis I just can't hardly wrap my mind around a rapture he says yeah I ease as I can kind of see but he says I think it's more spiritual I said yeah it's spiritual but watch me go well watch me go cuz there's gonna come a day when I'm gonna walk with God and I'm not gonna be any longer that's what's God's promise to me you see that was a personal revelation to Joel when I was 20 years old that there's gonna be a rapture take place and I'm going with that and he's talking to the wrong person he says now you're going through a tribulation I said excuse me what for when the Bible says that I'm washed in the blood of the Lamb that I my sin are not there any longer that my Senate are gone why do I need to be purged from this is why I never thought about that I said brother you need to start thinking hey just a second I don't need to go through the tribulation for my purging I'm being purged right now you know brother Branham said to take the inventory every day of your life you take inventory every day you're passing everything continually through that thinking man's filter the devil's gonna drop all kinds of stuff in your head you know I know it does it to you cuz he does it to me too I'm gonna drop all kinds of things but you pass it through that thinking man's filter and you know what's the devil and what's not basically when he tells you you're not saved Jesus wouldn't say you're not saved Jesus would just say get saved Jesus would say get the Holy Ghost Jesus would say you need healing get your healing he's not gonna ever tell you you're sick and you're gonna stay sick and you're never gonna be healed that's not God my God did not tell that to you but I told him that I'm going in a rapture you might say that's bold God wants us to be bold you know once you couldn't even enter into the Holy of Holies it was death if you did that under under the Tommen of bulls and goats you understand that but now under the Tommen of the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ it's deaf not to go into the Holy of Holies it's been open to you you can go in and receive the whole book every mystery everything of God that the rest of the world all of they they cannot understand it's not mysteries to you it's not thunders to you any longer it's voices friends we are not living in a day of silence God is not silent any longer but he's speaking to you he's saying it's me I'm Jesus I'm right here from Genesis to Revelation there I was and I'm the same yesterday today and forever it shows you who you were but he also shows you who you are and he also shows you where you're going amen let's turn in our Bibles to first Corinthians I've completely lost all track of time I'm sorry Bibles to first Corinthians 1 1st Corinthians 1 for tonight we'll speed along this morning I know some of the brothers are kind of tired talk to brother Troy he drove farther and I did this morning she appreciated her brother amen 1st Corinthians for 1st Corinthians 1 rather verses forward and 9 he says I thank my god always on your behalf for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ that and everything he are enriched by him in all utterance and in all knowledge even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you so that you come behind in no gift waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ who shall also confirm you unto the end that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ God is faithful by whom you were called unto the Fellowship of His Son Jesus Christ our Lord now I'll read verse 7 to you in the amplified it really was really meant a lot to me says the GR not consciously falling behind are lacking in any special spiritual endowment or Christian grace he's given it all to you the reception which is due the power of divine grace operating in your souls by the Holy Spirit while you wait and watch constantly living in hope for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and his being made this to all the Bible says that every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord and there that bride is looking to the coming of the Lord Jesus which that secret secret coming of Christ shall come and catch away his bride in the night the Bible says that he'll come as a thief in the night and just like the third pole of brother branham's ministry it will not be a public show only the bright now listen to me only the bride Oh know anything about it only the bride will understand that revelations six and eight have been opened but these aren't mysteries any more that it's open only the bride is going to understand that why because just like the little girl he came back and told her it wasn't the public show and neither is your going away Enoch walked with God he walked with God alone and you know the name enoch means dedicated it means dedicated he was dedicated to God he lived 365 years the Bible says 300 of that he walked with God and you know that word took if you look it up and the Greek and different things like that I'm not one of these deep spiritual teachers I'll let your pastor do that he he preached some services back in Sarasota I'm telling your brother they were wonderful but that word took means he married they got married he was dedicated he believed God took God at His Word and then God married him he just took him away there's a Bride of Christ your example Amen now I'm just gonna read this to you for times sake this morning it's a Matthew chapter 13 starting to verse 10 if you want to read along and the disciples came and said unto him why speakest out to them in parables he answered and said unto them because it's given unto you know to giving unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it's not given for whosoever hath to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but whoever but whosoever hath not from him shall be taken away even that he hath therefore speak I to them in parables because they seeing see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand and then them has fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah switch's says but hearing you shall hear and shall not understand and seeing you shall see and not perceive for this people's heart is waxed gross in their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes have they closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and I should heal them now listen right here 4:16 but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear for verily I say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which you see and have seen them and have not seen them and to hear the things which you hear and have not heard them my-my-my many righteous men and prophets all down through the Old Testament have desired to see your days you know brother Branham said if I'd have been given the opportunity to live in any age he said how to make this day the most glorious of all days you think that Oh what would it have been like to walk with Jesus in his earthly ministry Oh am I to see the lame walk to see the Deaf hear to see the vine received their sight what would that have been light but friends it's a greater hour right now because jesus said these things that I do shall you do also and also greater which means more why because there's more of a science little Jesus's Jesus Christ going out and doing the very same thing she's taking him at his word and saying God you said I believe that settles that I was talking to a man recently he was just plan to praying for somebody the man had a hearing problem and he couldn't hear he says do you mind if I pray for you the man says sure go ahead and pray for me you know God honored his faith right then and at that very moment the man he was playing for received perfect healing and he says I was kind of shocked it happened he says no you know what he kind of reveals himself he says I should not have been shocked Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever he worked in his ministry he's working his ministry and you right now don't be surprised when he does it Prince you see it's only the elect that will know the mysteries of God the world and the denominations are another thing about it why not I just got back from up north and just pick something up there but I'm giving it back I'm not claiming that one it's because they've added to the Word of God it's a hybrid word at that point and you know what a high drop come from corn country up north that hybrid corn it grows up it looks real good it's real big juicy ears but if you take one of those kernels out and put it in the ground it ain't gonna produce nothing you know why cuz it's dead it's because a man took a good seed that had real life in it and he began to tamper with it he began to post up in there that God did not intend to be there and he made something that not only is it dead but when we eat it it brings death upon us - is that right find our bodies fall I remember my grandpa he was just a little man probably way stronger than I've ever been because he ain't real good food I grew up on all this trash hybrid corn and all this garbage and you know but the Branum said if it's doing that to the body what's it also doing to the mind that's why we hear about all these shootings and all these horrible things their minds are gone Jesus said let this mind be in you the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead if it dwell in you it'll quicken your mortal body and also quicken your mind to the things of God you see that's why you're the only one that's saying you're the only one that's normal because you have the mind of Christ and you and it a hybrid with man anything man has to offer it's not the Word of God and no and as a conjunction where you could add something to it it's the Word of God only amen the Word of God is that seed now that's the same position position that we see tonight we have heard about God we've been taught about God through the years we've had churches great churches great men great evangelists but I believe we're living in the shadow of the coming of the Lord Jesus when this church has come from justification under Luther sanctification under Wesley and to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and coming to the perfect church without spot or wrinkle that through that church that God might redeem back all the blood wash Saints and take them home down through the ages we're becoming more christ-like and I love this statement right here he says we're becoming more christ-like and more in the minority all the time wow what a statement that is you become like Jesus Christ you're going to be different you're gonna become more and more and more in the minority every time Wow I used to work in a great big Factory up in Ohio thousands of people work there probably heard of it called Honda and we built the cars for Honda and you know I wore the same uniform or the same hardhat I wore the same Red Wing boots and everybody else I had no idea then I stood out I had no idea but you know friends you stand out there's something different about you like I said the world glitters you glow and you know my last day of here at that place is about 12 years ago I quit move down I said I'm gonna fellowship with some believers in Florida there's believers in Ohio too but I chose to live here my last day there and a factory so the whole time if any of you work in effect but you know it's kinda like being back in a public high school again you got your proper the people you got your unpopular people you got those that are just in between you got those I want to be popular it's just like being in school all over again all that politics all that craziness all again but I said that to say that the most popular guy on my sembly line the one that everybody liked who wanted to be like him cuz he drove a Corvette not a Honda and he came up to me with tears in his eyes I had no idea that's my name and had big green happens at Hunt across the top dorky pocket protector with an ink pen in it but you know what the ego never fits it in with the chickens you're not looking back but for a good reason last day I was there he came up to me with tears in his eyes he says I want you to know that I respect everything you stand for I told him all about this message that taught him about everything I believe with tears in his eyes he came up to me and said that I respected you know he still calls me once in a while with his prayer requests 12 years later he still calls me so-and-so said would you pray for him I said oh absolutely there's a line of people formed in front of me like I said I'm nobody I'm just an assembly line worker the line form I'm reading my Bible today because of you I'm going to church today because you my aunt mom I want to tell me tell you thank you because I come back to church but it's because of you talking to me about the Lord Jesus that I'm going back friends I had no idea they felt the need to tell me that my last date because I knew that they probably never see me again but friends no matter where you go I don't care if you flip burgers at Burger King if you're there is because Jesus Christ wants to be there you have a greater calling than what your job is you have a greater calling than making money in this life you got your call to display Jesus pride your call to emulate Jesus Christ to world this lost and dying you may say I bought my shirt my shoes at Goodwill you at the goodwill that day because Jesus Christ wanted to display his light to the world the Bible says that the footsteps of a good man are ordered of the Lord and he delights your way nothing happens to you by chance you say well I'm going through great trial I have heavy things that I'm dealing with the Bible says that all things all things work for the good for those who love the Lord and who are the called according to his purpose amen amen as a believer no matter where you go you're there because Jesus Christ wanted to be there and you have no idea the lives that you're reaching out to friends you young people in your neighborhoods and your schools or wherever you may go you may say well if I could just preached like by the jacker brother smiley or brother Nathan Bryant was here what a week or two ago something like that if I could just preach like brother Nathan no brother Nathan care not reach the people that you reach you can we cannot reach your neighbors friends they're looking at you they're looking at your life they're looking at every Sunday morning they get up and they go to spirit and truth every Sunday everyone Zac I think Friday - I was here with brother bill Hershberger here one Friday night because we consider watched by the boy that family but you know what if there's a seat of God in there that light will quicken that and you know who they're gonna come talk to they're gonna come talk to you say me I just live on my street my houses the same colors everybody else's I've got the same worn out forward in the drive that's what I have that's why I use that I got the same mm wore out forward with 80,000 miles on it my drive with everybody else why would they come to me because they see the life in you you say but they see Christ my if God could open her eyes and get us to realize you young people you are called to live for Jesus Christ not to act and to be like the world he doesn't want you to be like that he bought doesn't want you boys with your pants all the way down here to where you can hardly walk he wants you to be a gentleman he wants you to be a real true child of God living for Jesus Christ he didn't want you be-bopping to rap and R&B you know all that met back in my day it was a Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown anybody forty-two in here you know who those people were that's who I liked boys too man yeah I think they stayed boys but that's what I like to Bobby Brown man he was his prerogative it was I don't think his prerogative got him where he wants to be today his wife and his daughter are dead what they might be in church today serving God using their talents for Almighty God might say oh she's saying yes jesus loves me once in a while I mean live for the devil the rest of the time that's a sacrifice your God can't receive the Bible says the humble can tried hard there's a sacrifice your God will receive and had she given it to Jesus Christ I hope in her last moments she did I don't know I'm not her judge that's Jesus Christ very talented people Church nominal they want to build these big old cathedrals and fill them up with thousands of people I had a guy tell me he had out of pride he was dumb that goes the biggest Church around your baby Shore Community Church he said have you heard of it who hasn't signs everywhere trying to get people to show up there you are God's eyes friends you are this is Jesus is sign the world reads you glory thousands of people but our lives change and I asked him that my life changed because I met other people that went to that same megachurch you couldn't tell him from the world that's even higher yet walk along like about to fall over on her face hi I'm pastor so-and-so what a mockery what a mockery I thought you know there's nothing about that that draws me to Jesus Christ because their mind I know him and he don't look like that but you see that church you can't tell them from the world no I see you and I see a difference a huge difference in the world the Bible said the brand says this and the flashing red light of his coming I'm closing friends flashing red light of his coming right after he preached the seals he says in the days of lot they built they sold look at it today is the days of Noah women becoming pretty the sons of God falling human flesh being worshipped in the form of females and all these things has taken place that were talked about tonight the flash the lights of flashing the coming of the Lord is at hand you know brother Branham made that statement 1963 that they would worship females and you know I listen to that as I became a more mature adult but there was a time like I said a moment ago I didn't always worship God like I said like I should have rather went to church but I've got caught up in music and friends music isn't just something light I feel led to tell you that this morning music is just as powerful as any drug out there I want to tell you that right now what before they go out and play their basketball games and things like that what do they do they get up early what's the first thing they do they put on their music they begin to get pumped up you know that music raises your heart rate I want to say 30% something like that I read a statistic on it it raises your heart rate it gives you pumps so where you can just go out there and brother Jack preached a sermon one time on invincible we are invincible they think there invent Cybil now music works just like a drug I'll tell you what I remember driving down the road is he my son's here how member driving down the road just as fast as I could drive in the name of the song was I can't drive 55 I wasn't going 55 I going 105 stupidity absolute stupidity but it was under the anointing of that music you say oh I don't affect me I can listen to this I can listen to that it don't affect me well listen to this friends as I read this quote it reminded me I think the group was called off for one or something like that and I had to look up the lyrics to the song and I actually watched a portion of it and it was just beyond I'd forgotten that it was that bad you know because in that state I was in I was in line with it I was in the groove of the thing if that makes sense it and I was like just all swaying and going along with it and this guy begins to sing these eyes who worship and adore you these arms won't let your heart break you know and I began to read those lyrics begin to come back to my mind and then my prophet said if the flashing red light of his coming at the end of all time that would literally worship a woman's flesh and I begin to think yes they're doing that they're doing that they're openly doing that you know the saw the words of that song as I begin to read them seem like a praise in a worship song like somebody would be worshiping their God the one that died on the cross and shed his blood but it wasn't that it was because of some adulterous relationship that he said these I will worship and adore you such filth such filth that's not popular preaching today but it's the truth worshipping other people and and ever even says they got married never it wasn't a marriage relationship with some fornication relationship and you know I've been working in a dentist office and they have that light music playing all day and I'm with customers and things like that I cannot wear my earbuds that I like to wear because I listen to some good gospel music I'm gonna listen to brother Jack I'm gonna listen to some of these good godly brothers and sisters some of our church music or listen to the prophet or something like that and you know every single song has the same undertone if you think about it those of you that have come out of the world every single one of those songs has the same undertone the pinnacle of your happiness is found in another person and once you get to that relationship all of your needs every all everything they'll be satisfied you'll be satisfied for the rest of your life oh it's empty lies because would you get in that relationship its emptiness its hollowness their true happiness the joy the peace the satisfaction you were looking for can only be found in Jesus Christ another person going to let you down you brothers and sisters you young ones out there looking for a wife or a husband you go out to the world and pick the one but the biggest shoulders are picked the one with the prettiest eyes it can move the world things like that friends you're setting yourself up for heartbreak that's all I've got to say you've got to have the Holy Ghost in your life it must be the Holy Ghost in him drawing you to her and the Holy Ghost in her drawing you to him that's a relationship they don't last till death do we part cuz trial problems are gonna come the Rays gonna par but it's only if you're anchored in Jesus Christ and have the Holy Ghost abounding in your life that you won't separate and go out to the world you say brother Joel that don't happen a message unfortunately it does I've seen too many broken homes boy goes out to the world he bet some pretty little girl come to your church and she came and acted like the message believer maybe for six months after they got married you forget this I got him now he ain't even I thought he was gonna be so she goes back to her old friends and begins facebooking with her old boyfriend and this and that and here he is heart broke because marriage to him was so death do we part to hurry with just entail just entail somebody better bye-bye now he's at all raising this girl their daughter that they have together my my my my my it's a serious thing Jesus Christ too sure who he's gonna marry you better be sure who you're married to the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is rather long-suffering to us-ward not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance let's think of the latest thing in church age in its condition today as far as I know I don't see anything to hinder at this time the coming of the Lord Jesus outside the readiness of his church outside of the readiness of his church you see friends I've heard people say oh we're waiting on Jesus to return no he's waiting on you he's waiting on me you know I've been listening to the sermon and I listened to it on the way your desperations God will honor a desperate heart and unfortunately my brother branham said the only thing that puts us in desperations as mortal human beings it's emergency it's trial and turmoil go to cnn.com sometime friends you want to be put in desperation see what's going on there's people talking about blowing us up blown America up they're talking about doing it in according to science they have the capability now you know how to put us in desperation did get out of here but you know what you don't have to worry about that because you have a bomb shelter the Bible says in Psalms 91 that you can be hid under the wings of great Jehovah Eagle you've got a bomb shelter and that's in Jesus Christ he said I will protect you I will care for you you are mine all that little woman he loves oh my he's not gonna put her through all that he just gonna gently say come home the rest of the world's not gonna see it but you are it's gonna mean something to you just a couple more clothes if that's all right and what are we coming here for what are we doing are we coming here playing a game are we coming here meeting people is a lot Christ can't come until his church is perfectly right he is waiting on us I believe we're at the end believe the Lord Jesus Christ for your house applied the token to your house then what do you do when you apply that token to your house move out all the trash get the short skirts the shorts the cards the cigarettes might you go through a list here the cigarettes the television and what more he says kick it out the door when you go apply the token he says it won't stand for it yes sir take it all out all the dances the parties the rock and roll the old vulgar newspapers and stuff that's of the world and kick it out the door and say we're cleaning out this house around here right now we're cleaning the place up you see full obedience to the full Word of God entitles you to the token you say brother toal you started preaching on being prepared and you end up with the token that's exactly right you must have the token in your life in his ass preparing this sermon the devil begin to talk to me you say does he talk to you he absolutely does he says old there you go again talking about that token don't you know the church is sick of hearing about the token and that's what he began to say in my mind I begin to reason with me and I got to thinkin to myself you know what that's not God told me that the Church of Christ wants to hear about the token he's the one that don't want to hear about the token anymore because when the token supply he cannot enter death was stopped at that token when the Bloods there he cannot go across that's why it's up to you daddy's new mommies to apply the token to your home and that devil cannot come near your dwelling death has to pass over you the Passover happens on your street wherever you live we'll pass over because life is on display there and today the token is the Holy Ghost today that token is his life and you you say can I be so surrendered to God he said you could he said you could let's just stand this this morning do the do we know this song in Jesus name we press on if the musicians would gently play that god Bless You Heavenly Father the Lord we love you with all of our hearts Lord we believe dear God that what you have put in this book to be true and if there would be something more powerful that you could have given us Lord you would have done it but Lord you've given us overcoming power and what is overcoming our prophet said it's recognizing the devil in his tactics it's recognizing what he's doing Heavenly Father especially to your young sheep Lord give them the eye salve of the Holy Spirit to recognize how the devil's coming against them because that's soul that's embodied in that young person maybe that teenager whoever they are is worth 10,000 world's to our God Lord Jesus you would have gone up the Via Dolorosa that way to Calvary for that one little child Heavenly Father my prayer is that you would just open their eyes just now may they not wait till they're 20 like I did but they have the greatest opportunity right now to never go get the scars of the world to never go back out there and come back Oh as a child of God they come back we know that but may they not go get the scars come back with all this shame and this guilt Jesus you offer a way that that could be avoided and my prayer is I my heart cries to that one it's not surrender dear God the two would just reach out you would leave the ninety-nine and go out to that one and drawn to your fold Lord Jesus let them know how much they're loved how much they're cared for all the rest of the world wants to tell them they're alone you're alone or you you you don't have any worth you don't have but that's not the truth their value is high Lord you're not alone Jesus Christ said I will be with you I am a friend that sticketh closer than a brother I will be in you until the end of the world Lord that was your promise to us you people fear God and as we see these events wrapping up as we see bombs getting ready to fly around the world to hear God we your people you said look up for a read you read emption draw with night we your people look up and say God come into my heart come into my life come into my home come into my ipod my iphone my computer whatever it would be Lord we open it all to you your prophet preached a sermon one time called the doors in the door Lord we throw wide every door and ask you to come into our lives just now dear God completely wash us fill us with the baptism of the Holy Ghost in fire as you said that you would do to your draw us near to you dear God Lord go with each and every one as we depart from this place to be many sick that weren't able to make it today my prayer is that your Holy Spirit would just go out to them this morning Lord just be with brother Jack and maybe some of the saints
