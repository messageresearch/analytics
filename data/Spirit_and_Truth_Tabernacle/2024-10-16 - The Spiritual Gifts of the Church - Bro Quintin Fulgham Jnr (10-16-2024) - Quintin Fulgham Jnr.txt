you be with the service from the beginning to the end in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen so we are going to continue our lesson on um the spiritual gifts of the church uh and we're going to do our scripture reading from uh 1 Corinthians uh 12 8-11 just so we can kind of um look at those uh look at the next gifts that we're going to talk about amen all right just say Amen once you get there and I'll just start reading it amen so it says here for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by The Same Spirit to another Faith by The Same Spirit to another the gifts of healing by The Same Spirit to another the working of Miracles to another prophecy to another Discerning of spirits to another diverse kinds of tongues to another interpretation of tongues but all these worketh the one and the self-same spirit dividing to every man severly as he will and you may take your seats so so so far we've talked about the gifts of wisdom knowledge Faith um the gifts of healing Miracles and so now we're going to uh turn to the gifts of Prophecy uh I think brother Jack has done a real good job of talking about the gifts of tongues and interpretation uh telling you what they are how they're to be used into the church uh so we're going to start with this gift of Prophecy um and I looked online at a definition on Miriam of what prophecy meant and the prophecy what they said was an inspired utterance of a prophet right so a prophecy is a is a two-way street where it tells you of things that are going to happen and it also can tell you about past events as well so prophecy doesn't care what happens in between right it already sees the outcome done that's all that it's looking at so and we heard the story from our brother um that preached on Sunday about the man that was blind he went up to the prophet and we know he said all right you got your sight when the prophet said that he had already seen the with the eyes so when the man went back and started doubting and he started doubting and he came back with the prophet he said hey I thought you said that you were healed the prophet said I thought that you believed so the prophet had already saw him with eyes and couldn't see nothing else so this gift of Prophecy is a mighty prophecy in that when we can find an individual that can come to you and speak a word to you it doesn't matter what happens in between right doesn't matter what you go through it doesn't matter how you feel doesn't matter how long it takes that's all that God looking at and God expects us to just look at the same thing right so I want to kind of give an experience because I remember one time I was with the youth I think it was Joseph and um and his sisters we were at the uh we were at the basketball court on H Hill cuz we were having like a little youth outing and I was you know I was out there just you know being with the youth and this one lady had seen me with the youth and um so I got to talking to her and she's you know she's uh she's a Christian uh I was talking to her she said she was a minister and stuff like that and so I'm kind of hearing hearing her and stuff like that and she admired the way that I was working with the youth uh and so she kind of spoke a word over me and said you know you're going to be doing something for the Youth somewhere along that lines and I kind of It kind of struck me and I was like okay that just sounds interesting um I'm always careful about those things especially when they come from people that I know don't have the fullness of the word but then some month later or I think it was the next year later brother Jack had come up to me and said hey do you want to start teaching for the Youth and so that made me think back to the time where she kind of spoke that word because gifts and callings are without repentance don't need the Holy Spirit to have a gift if you have the gift of Prophecy and that Spirit comes over you utters a word to somebody and it's God's word it'll come to pass and so that made me look back and say oh wow okay so she spoke that word over me and the gift of Prophecy is not um it's not gender exclusive like other Ministries no females can speak a word get a speak get a word of Prophecy and speak it over your life that's right right and so it uh um and so but we have to put an emphasis on this gift because the spirit of Prophecy is an interesting gift and it's an easy gift to understand they speak a word it's a word given by God you believe it it comes to pass how do and how did I know how do I know of confidence that what she said was true well it came to pass amen it's simple as that when God speaks word amen it just comes to pass there's no question about it because it's a living thing now because God's word is a living thing right amen but we have to put a real emphasis on this gift and caution uh because it's tied to um end time um uh prophecy and stuff so we're going to turn to Matthew uh 24:24 we're going to go through some Bible verses that kind of help us kind of understand because it's it's not just important to understand what a gift is but it's important to understand how it has to operate within a church how it can be used because it can be used for good and it can also be used for bad right so reading from Matthew 24 it says for there shall rise false christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect and I like how the Bible puts this inside of here that when you are elect and you've received the baptism Holy Spirit don't ever think that you're above the point of being deceived right don't ever think that just because you're going to church and this is one reason why you're young folk you have to get the baptism Holy Spirit you can't depend upon your parents experience coming in church every single Sunday as to hold you no you need the word of God inside yourself to be able to shift through the deception right so and the Bible clearly says that it will come through false proph prophets with false prophecies and it would deceive the very elect meaning that things would look so close to being the real thing that and that it would very test you and God and and the reason why that Jesus Christ um Jesus Christ could actually say this thing and give us confidence that what the Holy Ghost will overcome is because when he was tempted he was taken up to the mountain now Satan didn't tempt them with drugs didn't tempt them with women didn't tempt them with any kind of uh you would think as sin he temped him with the word of God he gave him the word of God and when it says tempt that doesn't mean that Jesus just brushed it off the devil just came into his head and he said hey this is this say and Jesus said all right just get the behind me whatever no Jesus sat there and tempted was like oh hold on a second this thing sounds really really really close and we know that temptation is not sin but you're still kind of going through and you're understanding the weaknesses and the Bible says that Jesus had to be tempted so he can help those that are tempted so you're going to need the baptism Holy Spirit in order to un uh to get past uh some of these uh gifts especially this gift of Prophecy all right right so we're going to turn to Jeremiah 14:14 just to read some more bible verses to further understand this point and it says here then the Lord said unto me the prophets prophesying lies in my name I sent them not neither have I commanded at them neither spake unto them they prophesy unto you a false vision and divination and a thing of not and the deceit of their heart right we're also going to turn to Jeremiah 23 uh 616 right and Jeremiah reads in uh verse 16 thus sayith the Lord of hosts hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you they make they make you vain they speak a vision of their own heart and not out of the mouth of the Lord so God gives These Warnings because prophecy has a strong uh what you call convincing Spirit behind it to believe that something is true right right so we need to understand how this gift of Prophecy uh Works in order for us to be able to know when we're in a correct prophecy and when we're not in the correct prophecy right and in the first thing that you have to do when you understand the difference of a gift of Prophecy and uh uh the difference for the gift of Prophecy is when when I was doing my search in uh when I was looking up the gifts of Prophecy looking in the message doing searches the prophet does mention gift of Prophecy but he also mentions a prophet with that as well to show you what the difference is between them and that kind of helps you to understand how this gift is to be used and what the difference is now a prophet which is a capital P they're born a prophet right that is someone that has been hand selected by God through every single generation through every single age that a certain mother a certain father and mother would come together and create this person and he would be built in such a way that he would be a prophet he would be someone that is built physically because when brother brandham before he received the baptism of the Holy Spirit the voice of God still spoke to him when he was a kid he would hear things uh telling them not to drink and not to smoke and that was God's gift and just to show that it was born a gift and it's not something that you just come into the you just become a Christian oh I want to become a prophet that's not how it works God creates you a certain way to be able to handle the word of the Lord and hear the word of the Lord right the prophet said that the word of the Lord comes to the prophets amen meaning that you can't correct a prophet when a prophet says something that's it that's God's voice that's God's mouth right so we're going to turn to uh the Rapture the message Rapture 651 1204 starting from paragraph 136 see prophecy is a is a is a mighty mighty thing there has to be order to it and it reads here in 136 now prophets there's such a thing as gift of Prophecy in the church that's what God gives certain individuals in the church they have a gift of Prophecy but a prophet is predestinated and for ordained amen not just coming anywhere but for a specific hour amen which means Moses couldn't be coming couldn't come to our day brother brandham couldn't go to his day Noah couldn't go to Jesus day Jesus couldn't go to Noah's day right they're born for a particular hour see yes sir now if a prophecy Goes Forth now he's talking about Prophecy in the church yes two or three has to set and judge whether that's right or not amen it's no different than uh uh speaking in tongues where you got to make sure that uh if someone's speaking in a Tong you got to make sure that thing lines up with the word there has to be an interpretation Lins with the words and this gift of Prophecy that comes into the church that some of you may have it has to be judged two or three people have to judge that to make sure that it's thus save the Lord the prophet says here whether that is right or not before the church can receive it so before we even receive a prophecy we have to make sure that it's righten verse um in paragraph 3 137 says but nobody set before Prophet cuz he was he was absolutely the word of God he was the he was that word in his day you seeing God reflect now God has promised to send that again in the last days to bring the bride out of the ecclesiastic mess and the only way it can be done and the reason why you said that because he says in the next paragraph We just read the first sentence it'll never be done the church can't receive Christ because during the time when the gifts were being restored the gift of Prophecy was there but it still didn't bring them back to the true word right God had to raise up a individual right hand selected to be able to bring the fullness of the word while the gifts are being restored as well right so that's why we believe in the gift of prophecies but there's a place that you still have and you have to follow uh in order for it to be received praise God right um let's see where we're at okay so the gift of Prophecy has to be judged by two or three before it's received uh and the prophet doesn't have that limitation right what he says is what he says is thus sayith the Lord and what we're going to do is we're going to see in the Bible how we have to be careful about this gift of Prophecy and even for people that come into the church with gifts as well you have to kind of be careful about that so we're going to turn to numbers um 12 and uh we're going to read verses 1-8 amen all right and it reads and Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Ethiopian women he had married for he had married an Ethiopian women and they said notice the attitude because you have to remember here that Aaron was a was a a priest but he also was kind of a representation of a prophet because when God when Moses told God that hey I'm not an elegant speaker he said okay fine then you'll be God Aaron will be your Prophet that's right right so Aaron kind of represented a prophet that's right um and then also Miriam was a propheus as well right so they knew the gifts that they had but you have to be careful about it cuz look at the attitude here and they said hath the Lord indeed spoken only by Moses hath he not spoken also by us and the Bible says and the Lord Lord heard it now the man Moses was very Meek above all men which were on the face of the earth and the Lord spake suddenly unto Moses now here's God speaking directly unto Moses and unto Aaron and unto Miriam it should have been that God speaks to Moses and then Moses speaks to the people right says come out ye there unto the Tabernacle of the congregation and the three came out and the Lord came down the pillar and the cloud and stood in the door of the Tabernacle so you can imagine how they felt that God is now descending into a cloud and now he's coming to church to speak to them and called Aaron and Miram and they both came forth and he said here and he said hear now my words if there be a prophet among you now this isn't major prophet right this is not a major prophet I the Lord will make myself known unto him in a vision and I will speak unto him in a dream and I like how it says dream because we're going to get to that later because some of you have the ability to dream and brother Jack as brother Jack has said when a dream has been interpreted it becomes a vision and it is a prophecy if it's telling of something to come right so this is how this is God telling like you know I'll deal with you guys in visions and dreams verse 7 says my servant Moses is not so who is faithful in all my house with him will I speak mouth to mouth even apparently and not in dark speeches and what I believe that dark speeches is you can have a dream and not really understand understand what it is and it seems like man this thing is just confusing you need someone to come and interpret it which we'll get to that later on or you can receive a word from the Lord just man I'm just I just don't understand what this thing is I just I just got to pray about it I got to fast about it to really get clarification but when God speaks to a prophet it's clears day there's no need for interpretation there's no need to go fast about it God speaks the word and that is the word for the day amen right amen and the similar to the Lord shall he behold wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses right so we have to really understand how these gifts uh operate in the church and we're also going to turn to numbers 16 just to read some more about this order of the gift uh we're going to read verses one just one just one through three it says here now core so core was a priest as well says now cor the son of isar the son of Kath the son of Levi and Dayan uh um and ab bam the sons of eliab and on the son of paleth Sons of R Rubin took men and they rose up before Moses with certain of the children of Israel 250 princes of the assembly famous in the congregation and Men of R now and that and so one thing you have to realize about these gifts especially you know Gifts of Prophecy people love to make themselves famous with it you go on if you go you go on Instagram and you'll see you'll see Prophet m or Prophet Angela you know with a word for the day and everybody wants to be famous with it everybody wants to have Renown use their gift to have Renown with it but God doesn't operate in those things and I'm not saying that they don't have a genuine gift oh my they have a genuine gift amen but there has to be an order to it amen so verse three says and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron and said unto them ye take too much upon you seeing all the congregation Are Holy every one of them and the Lord is among them and the prophet said he was right when K had said that what he was saying was right the congregation is Holy right because it's a holy God it's not it's not holy people but it's a holy God in individuals but they're still in order of things that you have to follow and it says wherefore then then lift Ye Ye yourselves above the congregation of the Lord and that's where the problem came because God had designated Moses as the head man and so when these gifts get to operating because what you'll see later down is what it did was it split the congregation right and so when these gifts begin to operate in the church we have to be careful about how they're operating especially Gifts of Prophecy and stuff like that because that's how the churches get split in half and and one of the things that I like about the true leadership uh um because whenever you see someone trying to divide a church that right there that birth of the idea when you're when something is born wrong it can't be right am and so when your intentions is to split a church and you don't care about nothing else it is not going to be right but when the so when the congregation has split themselves and God said I'm going to go and Destroy everybody Moses who had been bir from the right way of starting a church said no should one person sin and everybody else perish and he stood in the Gap and God said okay go over to the church tell them people to come on your side because I'm about to do something to these people right cor and them didn't care about none about that he didn't care if they perish and everybody else perish and that's how you can tell if something is a Birthright so that's why you have to be careful about uh uh about these gifts that can uh that can that can rise up in the church even though they're genuine they're genuine gifts and we're going I'm going to turn to the Le of thean church age is not up there I couldn't find the paragraphs associated with it but I wanted just to read through a section here it says but he um brother brandham says before we close this section on the messenger of the Le of theen age we must seriously consider these two thoughts seriously consider first this age will have one Prophet messenger Revelation 10:7 says when he singular shall go shall begin to sound there has never been an age where God gave his people two Major Prophets at one time yeah right so a gift of prophet having a gift of Prophecy doesn't make you in charge so that's why I was kind of skeptical when skeptical when this lady prayed over me when when she called herself a minister I said oh wow you know because gifts can cause people to get themselves out of place you know then you have female a female that can have a honest gift of Prophecy females can have the Bible says there are prophe they can have gifts of Prophecy right but when you elevate yourself into a Ministry position that's held for a particular position you're out of order and it's not it's the same for um and it's it's the same for this day when you have people that may be prophets and then you try to elevate yourself of the prophet of the day and try to replace what he said come on now with what he did not say that's right right that's right there has never been and I'm not saying that people are not prophets to have gifts I believe they're genuine gifts but they're just not operating in place we want prophecy to operate in order right so there there has never been an age where God gave his people two Major Prophets at one time amen he gave Enoch alone he gave Noah alone gave Moses and this is the one we want to talk about he gave Moses he alone hath the word though others prophesy so we're not taking away prophecy we want the prophecies to come they just have to line up with the word for the day so you can't be prophesying saying hey I I saw all of us at Ruby Tuesday fellowshipping drinking alcohol you know uh having a good old time in uh in the in the name of the Lord when the prophet said you ain't supposed to be drinking alcohol amen that wouldn't be a prophecy that we will follow all right um so prophecies uh the prophecies are supposed to work with the word when you receive a prophecy or you have a gift of Prophecy it's supposed to work with the word so that we know it's something that we could uh we can stand on um and so and and another thing that we kind of want to look at is because now we live in a we live in a day and age where the Prophet is no longer here right and a lot of times people can get very remin reminiscent of The Times They had when the prophet was here and they you know how they wished he was here um and I know that there are some there are certain instances where people will experience that they're going through something right and they'll play a tape of and brother Brandon will be in a prayer line and they'll hear while he's praying over someone he'll he'll pray out their condition that's right and speak their condition and I believe that's well and fine and that can happen but if you don't hear nothing don't think that a word of Prophecy still can't come over for your position when you come to church that's why God placed the gift of Prophecy in the church so that because uh God realized that sometimes when you're going through a situation you need a particular Avenue to hear the word and that's why you have the gifts come through faith you have gifts come through healing gifts come through the ministry and then the gift of Prophecy God knows that for a particular situation or particular challenge you'll need a particular gift and some people you know when they're going through you'll need a gift of Prophecy in order to get you through and we're going to read about that uh uh a little bit later on down the word right um so you don't question a prophet for your day right you have a gift of Prophecy we judge them by the church um the end time it talks about how we're uh this Pro these false prophets would try to deceive us uh so the other thing that makes a prophet different from a gift of Prophecy uh is um the way that they see prophecy all right so we're going to turn to um the message Serv be of a good cheer preached in 54 and paragraph 29 through 31 and I'll just start reading so it says now on this subconscious when this outer conscious becomes active so he's talking about the subconscious so you so basically you have a conscious every one of us are conscious right now because we're seeing everybody and we're perceiving everything and then you have the subconscious that is also in the back of your head right so now on the subconscious when this outer conscious becomes act inactive this conscious becomes active to a dreamer now let's give just a little illustration here's the first conscious here's a normal man his subconscious when this one is active inactive at night when he's asleep then this one's then this one's active so what he's saying is that while you're awake your conscious is active and you're able to perceive and see things and uh uh experience the real word but when you're asleep your subconscious then takes over over right and that's why some people can see dreams and have dreams that are very very Vivid where they actually feel stuff because it's the subconscious working right and the prophet said many of you people that dreamed dreams years ago you still remember it don't you and I and I like how it ties in this dream because we're going to get to we're going to get to the dreams uh as being kind of a gift as well for some people it says well there was some part of you somewhere because after you're awake you remember what you dreamed of is that right and sometime when you're dreaming you dream of things that you did when you was conscious is that right but now the man that doesn't dream a dream so people that don't dream his subconscious is way back even an aesthetic wouldn't throw him back there cuz he sleeps real sound so if you sleep in real sound you probably not a dreamer right if if you going to bed and you having a real good night's sleep you probably not no dreamer right am so and it says now a dreamer doesn't sleep sound he's not altogether sleep and so I don't know if any and I know I don't know if anyone here has experienced there's a there's a concept out there called sleep paralysis and sleep paralysis if you go on line and you and you read of what it is sleep paralysis is when you're in a state when you're asleep but you're not asleep and what people describe it as is that your body is in a state where you're Frozen you can't move and a lot of people and I'm not trying to scare anybody but a lot of people see some crazy stuff uh in those sleep prises I remember I was online and I was reading through and some people one person had saw this woman that was running toward him screaming and another person that saw like a dark figure um that was by the kitchen or something so people see some really scary things uh because they're in they're I'm they're kind of perceiving another dimension right um so that's what he's kind of talking about when he's saying uh when you dream dreams and you're kind of conscious of what you remember because while you were dreaming you actually remembered and saw what you had saw it's not something you made up in your mind right yes so now in verse uh ver but paragraph 30 now but a Seer or a prophet now I admit there's a gift of Prophecy that goes into the church but that's not a prophet a prophet's born see now he must be from childhood up in every word right see now the Seer his subconscious is not not backed by the wall neither is it here it's right here they're both together so a prophet is born with his conscious and his uh his conscious and his subconscious are together all of us our subcon and our conscious is separated we in order for us to dream things we have to go to sleep right but the prophet his subconscious and conscious is together right that's what makes him different you see what I'm saying no one can impersonate that you can't you have to be born that way right God has to select certain genes in order for that thing to be activated for you to be called a prophet of your day so it's not even it's not even about the word you bring even though that's important it's about how you're born and how God made you that's how God selects the person uh for their day right the messenger for their day right so he says it's right here they're both right together he doesn't go to sleep he just breaks from one to another see it's like a dream yet you're conscious you're St you're you're standing here yet it's just like you was dreaming something and yet you're conscious enough that you can talk about it and you know what you know your voice is coming back in the building yet you're somewhere else here's another key part maybe 30 40 years back or forward or wherever would be so that's why we can trust that's why we can trust people that have this gift and uh brother Jack had talked about you know when Moses wrote the Book of Genesis yeah he was not there amen but provided so much detail of what happened right and how did he get that detail he had a vision and he exactly saw what happens and the problem with man is that when man reads the Bible and gets an interpretation they don't see anything so it's kind of like when you go to court and let's say you have a man that you have two people on the side you have a man that has stole something or allegedly stole something and someone and his lawyer is saying no he didn't steal anything and you have another lawyer over here saying no he did steal something right and so they're just going back and forth and this Lord that's trying to defend the thief is saying you know the the people say you know he people saw he was wearing a red shirt and he stole these things he said well there was probably a lot of people in the store wearing a red shirt so he's doing everything he can to defend him and they're just going back and back and forth and finally someone pulls up video evidence now when the video was played and they see your face stilling something the argument is over and that's what a vision is like from a prophet when they see something it's no longer just something they're making up or they're trying to theorize or they're trying to hypothesize about no they saw what happened so when you look at a lot of denominations today and I've been to this uh my at my old church we went to this play called sights and sounds and they did the play of Jonah and so when Jonah was ready to get swallowed up they had this big old whale out there and and he was in the in the belly of a big old whale but when Moses had a vision he saw a fish he didn't see a whale so you see how people can interpret the wrong thing when they read it but Moses it wasn't some Theory to him he saw Jonah in a fish and said hey Jonah was in a fish right so they see these things uh as clear as day uh which gives them confidence and that's why brother brandham when he would break out in vision just to show people that it wasn't something he was making up he would give a description of you to a tea he says you're wearing white socks pink shoes I see you in a blue blouse it's sunny outside but it looks like it's about to rain over there there's a deer in the back the dog is barking right because he's right there just seeing at these things happen and that's how we can have confidence that you know for your situation and even it's still the same for a word of Prophecy when someone in the church gives you an inspire that's why I like the definitions it's inspired it's not something they're making up when someone gives you an inspired word that your situation is taken care of you can rest just as much as if it was a vision that the prophet had given you Hallelujah right Glory God's already seen the Victory and you can rest in that amen right and so so we're going to go down to this um this concept of dreams as a form of Prophecy right because brother Jack has said when a dream is interpreted correctly it's it's it becomes a vision um now dreams have to be uh judged as well so we're going to turn to Genesis uh chapter 41 and read a couple of verses in here and we're going to read verse eight and it says and it came to pass in the morning that his Spirit was troubled so they're talking about the Pharaoh the Pharaoh had the Pharaoh had a dream and this dream had troubled him and his Spirit was troubled the Pharaoh and he sent and called for all the M The Magicians of Egypt and all the wise men thereof and Pharaoh told them this dream but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh right so and that's kind of goes that kind of goes back to when God was telling uh Miriam and them that you know when I talk to prophets I don't talk in dark sayings or things that like you don't understand and you're troubled and you need some kind of help to understand what this thing is so this this uh this dream of pharaoh he was troubled by it but he didn't understand what it was so turning to uh verse 15 and and uh 15 verse 16 I want you I want you to see the attitude of of Joseph because this is this is this is the kind of people that we want operating gift that's why you don't just want to have a gift you want to have character that goes with a gift because that'll make sure that the church is running smooth right so it says and Pharaoh said unto Joseph I have dreamed a dream and there is none that can interpret it and I have heard I heard say of thee that thou can't understand a dream to interpret them and Joseph answered Pharaoh saying it is not in Me God shall give Pharaoh an answer of Peace so here is uh Joseph not trying to Puff himself up but turning it back to God exactly and and that's what we try to do so even when you have a dream and that's why and this is me personally I believe if you have a dream it still has to be judged even if it was a prophecy it's still got to be judged you can't just believe that thing and run with it we need to take it back to God right because uh I like that I like the answer that that Joseph said God shall give Pharaoh an answer of Peace God will let you know if this thing is real or not and that is settl it right so gifts um dreams prophecies always have to be judged but if it's a prophet saying something you don't have to worry about amen trying to interpret that or not interpret that and so during this in this example this was an example of of Joseph he uh interpreted the dream of some turmoil that was coming into Egypt that exactly came to pass and contrast that to Noah when God told Noah of a tmal that was going to come God told Noah and Noah saw it directly and told the people there was no interpretation needed no hey we need to pray and ask God is this thing right that Noah gave us no that was the word of Lord and it and it came directly to pass right so the gift of Prophecy is an utterance is an inspired utterance that has to be under the word of God has to be by the pro it has to be under according to the word of the Prophet so you can't have a prophecy outside of the prophecy that's how you'll fall away in the end time and the Holy Spirit helps you to stay with the word for your day amen and so what we want to do is we want to see this gift of Prophecy and action in modern times in a very interesting uh situation so we're going to turn to question and answers number three um uh it's 64830 and paragraph 221 amen okay I'll just start reading and it says um I think our and this is brother brandham cuz someone had uh someone had asked a question he said uh this person said dearly beloved about the scripture of emphasis 4:11 through1 13 do we all do we do we get all perfecting of saints through the tapes or should we be here where the gifts of the Spirit are operating and the different offices of the church to help perfect us our hearts have believed all the word of the Lord and that's the kind of the question but I want to see I want to tell you what brother brandham has says uh uh and this is just accordance to the gift of Prophecy in the church and this is his church he says and this is what he's referencing he says I think our brother Higgin Boo Here everywhere he's at he's got a gift of speaking in tongues and we got our we got our brother Junior Jackson with us and he speaks with tongues and then we got two or three of them interprets brother Neville here also our pastor speaks with tongues and sometimes prophesies and the Lord brings upon him just the other day he said something he called he called upon a phone in the house where I was at that he prophesied over a person told them that a drunken man would there will be a great change in him right away or something like that and the man had come out of Alcohol Anonymous which is a group that tries to help people to recover from becoming alcoholics and he the brother Brandon said he came out of Alcohol Anonymous still an alcoholic but after he received that um prophecy and it says and for 68 days hasn't even touched alcohol or no medicine for it or anything that was brother Neville prophesying over him so you see how the gifts work with the Prophet The Prophet didn't have to question that like oh that that sounds kind of iffy no he recognized that okay this is a gift of Prophecy working in an individual and you know he prophesies that thing came to pass it lines up with the word and it's and I like this because this was in brother brandom's church and brother Brandon was able to identify who had the gift of Prophecy and if brother Brandon was able to do it we should be able to do it God we should be able to identify who has the gift of Prophecy in the church we should be able to identify who has a gift of speaking in tongues and the gift of healing and the gift of knowledge we should be able to identify those things and I mean brother brandom just said it like it was something that was I mean I want to say common but normal it wasn't like you were trying to achieve it it was just hey this is what's in our church right now right right amen all right so now we want to move on and I know I don't have a lot of time left um but we want to move on to this uh this gift of discerning Spirits uh and uh this is a this is a very this is a very important one um so it says here in uh 1 Corinthians uh I'm just going to read it um it says to another Discerning of spirits right so Discerning of spirits uh and what that means is it's letting you know uh what Spirit you're dealing with when you're uh when you're encountering a person or you're en countering a situation it lets you know the spirit of the person that you're dealing with and there's an emphasis on the word spirit so it's not a gift of gossip and assumption you're not assuming that somebody is doing wrong or you're not assuming that someone is uh uh uh has done something wrong or someone is living life or not a life right just because you don't like someone you know or that doesn't mean that you can just go around and just speak bad about them right you know you know you'll have you'll have you'll have people in the church you know they'll see someone that's in church go out maybe on a Thursday they driving behind a grocery store or whatever and they see him smoking a cigarette and all they like I always knew you was a demon you know I always knew you wasn't safe I I just I just had a feeling and just knew that that's not what a gift of discernment is right that's not what a GI that that actually shows you have the wrong spirit cuz the the prophet said when you see someone in the church uh going or dealing with something you go and you pray for them right you go and you pray for them because you don't know what challenge or what trial or what thing that they're dealing with right so that's that's not a gift discernment a gift discernment doesn't judge by the flesh it judg by the spirit so we're going to turn to um well we're going to pull up the message discernment of spirit preached in 60 and we're going to read from uh paragraph uh 11 let me pull it up all right so this is what the prophet said it says now we now we do have and I think it's a good thing for us as ministers to follow our order when we see such things in the world as we see today and we have order from God is for the Discerning of spirits trying the spirit you're not you're not you're not even looking at the person when you're trying the spirit or when you're Discerning the spirit you shouldn't even be looking at the person you shouldn't be looking at their their uh uh their personality their skin color what clothes they got on you're just looking at what spirit is in them driving them to do whatever they whatever they're doing says I believe that is a very great lesson for the church today is to try the spirit of anything have discernment of the spirit I do not think that we should ever by any means ever try to judge a person by the denomination they belong to or by the group that they are assembled with whether they are methodists Baptist Presbyterian Pentecostal or or whatever they are we should never judge The Man by the denomination that he belongs to we should always judge him by the spirit that he has the spirit whether he's latter re or former Reign or inner outer Reign or no r or what whatever it might be we should never judge him by that but by his Spirit we are to discern Spirits watch the man watch what the man has in has in his mind what he has what he's trying to achieve if the man has uh if a man buy a gift no matter how great the gift is so and that kind of goes back to you know when you're wa when you're when you're looking at these gifts of Prophecy that are that will operate in the church and the gift of healing you always kind of want to discern the life of behind it and you're not actually looking at the gift being performed right because that'll take you off of the word if you're only focusing on the gift amen right so discernment can show you how uh discernment uh one way discernment is is used is to uh to tell how something will stand the test of things right so you're not a minister because you decide you want to be a minister amen right amen God has looked in you before you even knew what um in the beginning the word was with God before you even looked in the Bible God looked in your spirit and saw how well you would stand the test right and be able to speak the word God saw that in you right and when you're choosing some to marry right it's uh um God knows how you would how that relationship would work out amen right the church that you choose to go to God knows right how how you would act with inside of that church because every church has its good things that's right every church has his problems and God knows how you would act during those bad times and if it would bring a disc to the church or not bringing disgrace to the church right so God so discernment is used to tell how things would test stand a test of time we can see that in the choosing of King David right Samuel didn't use discernment when he was choosing the king he looked at all the the tall Brothers the strong ones and said man this got this one's got to be the king you know God said nope he said well okay and he told the next one to come out big old muscles biceps just popping out the shirt was like this got to be the king he look like he can throw down and just tear somebody up God said nope and Samuel was like what in the world like okay and he just went down the line went down the line and S said is there anybody else that you got exactly right and yeah we got this little radio fell out there but he ain't no King trust me he's not no King Samuel said look God told me to come here and pick a king I need to see him and so they said all right David come in here and here come David I mean just a skinny little wimpy guy you would have never thought nothing of him just come here hey what's going on Dad and they just looked at him and Samuel was like okay well just pour the oil poured it over and the oil just spilled and poured over it was God's discernment God saw David's heart God knew that when God would put David into a test that he wouldn't crack under the pressure God knew he would stand on the word right and so that's why when you're going through your test and battles you don't even pick your test and battles that you go through God allows those battles to come to you don't never try to put yourself in in a position where you're trying to fight a battle that God has not called you to God knows you'll break under it God knows exactly what tests what trials God knows your limit the Bible says he'll never give you more than you can handle so when you put yourself in a position where you cannot handle it God has already discerned you from the beginning if you would be able to handle this thing or not handle this thing right amen right God already saw that his brothers wouldn't be able to stand up to Goliath and so we're going to read 1 Samuel's 21- 29 just to kind of go through that a little bit um just the story of David right here just to show you just to show how God could discern that this could be my king so I'll just start reading it says verse 21 it says for Israel and the Philistines had had put the battle in Array Army against Army and David left his carriage in the hand of The Keeper of the carriage and ran into the army and came and saluted his uh Brethren and as he talked with them behold there came up the champion the Philistine of gath Goliath by name out of the armies of the Philistines and spake unto the same words and David heard him and this is why God could could discern and knew that David was the one because David now hears these words of what he's saying in verse 24 it says and all the men of Israel when they saw the man fled from him and were sore afraid that included David's Brothers as we're going to see and the men of Israel said have you seen this man have you seen this man that that is come up surely to defy Israel is he come up and it shall be that the man who kth him the king will enrich him with great riches and will give him his daughters and make his father's house free of Israel and and it just goes to show you that incentives won't still don't make you good for the job wow so a lot of times people will try to pick a job like oh I want to be a lawyer you know they make like $2,000 2,000 uh $200,000 I see him with a Ferrari man I see him with a a two a three story house man that is just you know he gets to work whenever he wants to work and then they'll pick that job and then when they get in the job and they're dealing with the stress and they're dealing with the problems and it's daily day all of a sudden you know I don't want to do this anymore right you have to be built for a particular job pray and ask God for the job he gives you he knows what you can handle he knows what you can't handle he knows how smart You' be able to handle things or not so and and and it's not going to put you in a position where you're you feel like you're being crushed all the time right and so 20 verse 26 says and David spake to the men that stood by him saying what shall be done to the man that kth um the Philistine and taketh away the approach from Israel for who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defile the armies of the Living God and I like that in David because he didn't care about the riches he didn't care about the daughter all he cared about was I see this guy that is mocking God and ain't nobody doing nothing about it right in his heart he was just wanted to do a good job he didn't have to be incentivized to do a good job right and the people answered after this manner saying so shall it be done with the man that kth him and eliab his eldest brother the one that was rejected the one that uh when when the prophet came up and uh said this one has got be the one and God said nope not him well why did he reject him cuz CU a lot of times the spirit of discernment you have to understand we're going to get to that later the the spirit of discernment is not to hurt your feelings oh my it's not it's not aimed at your flesh but it's looking at the spirit is looking at the Spirit of the thing right and elab his oldest brother heard when he spake unto the men and elb's anger was kindled against David and he said why comest thou why comest thou down hither and with whom with with whom hast thou left thou few sheep in the wilderness I Know Thy pride and the Ness of thy heart for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle so here we have Eli that was also afraid to fight and God could discern that when he told Samuel no this one isn't the one because he been saw that when Goliath would come out there he'd be hiding in the bush right but when he saw David he said oh no no no this is the one this is the one when he runs toward goli he ain't going to hesitate and say well maybe I can do it or not now he ran right forward right uh to overcome so God used that spirit of discernment uh to uh to show him to God can use a spirit of discernment to show who is uh good for a job and who is not good for a job not only that spirit and we're uh in closing in a little bit uh not only can the spirit tell you how something will stand the test of time but the serment can tell you why people deal with the troubles that they have and the prophet had the spirit of discernment cuz you will come to the prophet with a problem you say hey I'm dealing with this this this this and that and this is that help me out right but then the prophet using the spirit of discernment was say hold on a second that's not the whole picture you got some other things that you're dealing with as well and this is what's causing issue so the spirit of discernment doesn't just agree with things that face value it looks at the spirit amen and you can take an example of you know either a um like a girl or a boy or a girl trying to a girl that's getting getting that's constantly in like she's always complaining about being in wrong relationships like man I'm always getting the wrong guy I'm always getting the wrong guy Lord no matter what and she could be in her heart honest trying to get a good relationship and if you take a man uh that knows the word uh and the spirit of discernment he can look at what she's wearing and be able to discern why you are getting the wrong people that's right that's right why you're getting the wrong people because of what you're wearing and what you're attracting mhm cuz the prophet said that a man filled with the Holy Ghost which is the guy that you want when he sees someone dressed like that the Holy Ghost causes him to turn his head that's right so he can't even look at you amen he can't even look for you right so that spirit of discernment and it's when you say that to somebody it's not to hurt your feelings right they're not looking at your feelings they're looking at the Spirit that's causing you to to dress or act a certain way saying hey if you get rid of that Spirit things would be better for you amen right um and so we we also know um the spirit of discernment can be used to also tell uh the intentions uh the heart this is the last thing we'll talk about um you know the prophet there was a story in the Bible there was a well there was an incident where the Prophet had went to a church and he saw uh in the church the gifts were coming down and people were speaking in tongues and people were interpreting tongues and after the service he went and went and talked to these people that had these gifts and as he was talking to the one guy he said I was trying to catch a spirit like the woman at the well he said wow this guy is a Bonafide Christian right he's a Christian through and through and then he went and talked to the other man and as he talked to the other man he realized oh hold on a second and the thing about it is he described the uh that I think he said that is his wife had black hair and the woman that he was cheating on had belond here right so that spirit of discernment came down there and kind of uh uh showed the intentions or this the uh the seed behind what was in the per person just as Jesus could uh look at the Pharisees and Sadducees and say hey you're of your father right because he was able to discern that thing and so you have to be careful with this the spirit of discernment because the spirit the spirit of discernment is to edify the church it's not to pick on you it's not to uh to uh talk down on you or say that you're a bad person it's looking at your spirit and so if you if one of you in here has a spirit of discernment you awful you have to be very spiritual about it right because you can't just look at stuff at face value because when Paul or I'll say Saul when God had selected Saul to be his end time messenger and now God went over to these Believers that were filled with the Holy Ghost they said hey hey Saul I'm sending Saul your way I want you to baptize him he's going to be filled with the Holy Ghost he's going to do a work for me they were like hold on a second I know you're not talking about this guy this guy Saul right they were trying to look at the man's fruit all right they were trying to look at the man's fruit and say no no no this guy over here Hees he just persecutes Christians he does this he does that he does this so you have to be careful with the spirit of discernment because the spirit of discernment looks at the at the uh at the Spirit of it of what is and I remember brother Jerry had um preached he preached about this before where he says that fruits are good and you look at fruits but what somebody is is the seed that's inside of him and a seed is a potential the seed isn't fruit yet but is a potential and so that's why you have to use a spirit of discernment to see the actual seed inside the person God saw that Paul would believe the word 100% the word even though he was not bearing fruits there and that's why we need to be filled with the Baptist and the Holy Spirit brother brand I mean brother Jack had talked about that how the Holy Spirit comes for you to bear fruit without the Holy Spirit yeah you're a seed of God but you ain't bearing any fruit right but with the Holy Spirit Will comeing and the bare fruit so the spirit of discernment in the church to help us to discern Spirits uh and this gift has to be really relied upon when you begin to see prophecies coming forth and you got ministers uh preaching the word to make sure that everything all the motives and things are lined up so that the church doesn't get in uh disarray so if you have a dis Spirit if you do have the spirit of discernment you have to say something if you notice something that is going on because a lot of times the problem is if you don't have the spirit of discernment you just get involved in the thing because you don't know what's going on if you have the spirit of discernment and you see something going on and you're worried about something and you prayed about it you have to say something if you don't say anything it can be of detriment amen all right so we're going to say a prayer just uh in this service Lord God lord your word has come forth full Lord God lord we know that these gifts that you have given oh Lord God are still in the church today we know that Lord God that your word is true oh Lord Jesus Christ and we're gathered here not of our own accord oh Lord Jesus Christ but according to your leading and to your Gathering and to your choosing oh lord your forn knowledge oh Lord God saw us here oh Lord God and you saw us here with a purpose oh Lord God a lot of people have things that they're struggling with oh Lord God a lot of people have needs in their heart they have sickness oh lord lord they've been dealing with sickness for days and days and days and they've been struggling but yet they still been holding on to your word Lord Jesus Christ Lord you place these gifts in the church oh Lord God to be able to speak a word over someone's life oh Lord God to end the suffering oh Lord Jesus Christ Lord your children oh Lord God they're holding on oh Lord Jesus Christ they're holding on to your word and they're praising you through the hard times but Lord help us oh Lord God to identify the gifts oh Lord God Lord give give the people the spiritual knowledge oh Lord God God to know what they have oh Lord Jesus Christ that we can identify what his gifts are oh Lord God and that the church can be a healthy Church oh Lord God the health of the church is dependent upon the gifts not just the gifts but the gifts used in order and in the correct way oh Lord Jesus Christ that is what sustains and keeps the church healthy oh Lord Jesus Christ Lord give us discernment oh Lord God give us the ability to recognize the gifts and to receive them oh Lord God in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen amen [Applause] God bless you praise the Lord amen we thank the Lord uh for the word of God tonight thought brother Quenton did an excellent job amen with uh just talking about this this Spirit of Prophecy and um you know there's um he he a really really good point that no and and and I think it goes back to a scripture in the book of um um Proverbs I think we uh we always kind of apply the scripture to just people preaching but it's a scripture that actually applies to every gift because the scripture says a man's gift will make room for itself and um uh whether God has given you a gift of of Prophecy a gift of uh tongues interpretation of tongues uh whatever and and and and just like a prophet is born that way I believe God gives people you know gifts at Birth they come without repentance uh but um you never have to push your gift and and and I love how he brought in the the the scripture of daythan and cor they were gifted people but they were not uh concerned about breaking up a church I mean um and I'm going just be honest with you if you see a gift like that come run if you get a person that will come in with a gift and you know they gift it but they're not concerned with breaking up a church and because if the if the if the all uh the motive is if the objective is I'm going try to start my own own thing right but I got to break this up in order to start my own thing something wrong somewhere with that I'm just I'm just being honest with you uh I I can tell you this much when spirit and Truth started it wasn't us breaking up nobody other church we didn't do that to get started here spirit and Truth Tabernacle and and and most of the people uh all you know most of your Saints especially some of the original Saints y'all know I didn't do no pulling on nobody I didn't do that God had to lead people you know to this church and when God LED them they knew where they were supposed to be and God is proven himself to them right but uh but I'm telling you the truth we we we we you never want to be found guilty of um taking your gift to use it to divide I'm going tell you where that gift come from it come from hell right and and Satan was a was a gifted individual was he not was Satan was very gifted in the music program I think he was probably directing the choir amen they were having nights of worship hello somebody right and he had them just going and and and next thing you know he just got tired of them giving all the glory to God and he wanted some of that praise himself right and and often times what happen if you get too gifted you oh Lord have mercy Jesus help me God you want your name called from the pull pit all the time we want to thank God for sister so and so being in our midst and God has gifted her and go ahead and do what you do you got to watch things like that I'm telling you the truth but but if if if you don't have any any um um feeling for people and and wantan to see people stay together and and all that something's wrong with your gift and anytime a church is built like that like daythan and Cory did it don't last it don't last another thing about you know he talked about the the spirit of Prophecy versus being a prophet brother Brandon was born a prophet if somebody has the spirit of prophecy on them now there's another quote brother random say that Spirit of Prophecy can go from one person to the next person inside the church but if you get a person with the spirit of prophecy on them and maybe something they say come to pass and maybe another thing they say come to pass and maybe another thing they say come to pass but if they come to the point where they're trying to replace brother brandom y'all just run away from that because we got to know that this is a body work we all have to work together and brother brother random had a very specific purpose and each one of us have a very specific purpose but we work together for the kingdom of God so anybody trying to say well you know I got something that the Lord showed me that no no no God ain't show you nothing remember remember the scripture Revelation 10:7 that all the Mysteries will be reveal to the seventh angel now where you fit in there amen where you fit in there cuz we know who the seventh angel was and and and and ain't no you you cannot tell me that there were some Mysteries left that were not uh taken care of otherwise the word of God is broken right there so we're not looking for anybody to come with anything else and I'm going to tell you another thing I'm going to just be honest with you if you prophesying about the coming of the Lord is supposed to happen at a certain time and it ain't happened at the time that you said it's was going to happen we cannot hear your prophecies amen amen amen we can't do it right because this thing has got to hit every time we don't want to play games in this area we want to be real with God we want to be I believe this has been restored back to the church and I believe this is a season for it to go forth but it must be done correctly I I've been thinking and you know just processing this will restore say the Lord and and and and I just I just keep thinking in my mind the Pentecostals should become into our church to see things done correctly my God and just just that's something I feel the Pentecostals should be coming to our church to see things done correctly I'm

Lord for uh taking me and brother Quinton way we went last week last weekend to um brother Mike walls there in Virginia it's a church that brother brother Quinton used to attend and uh and our first time there and uh I tell you the truth we had a wonderful wonderful uh uh time you know there in service and we just thank God for just taking us there bringing us back safely and just you know meeting um you know just just meeting us in a special way I and if you know we get a chance to go back again that is one church I would love to take uh some of our Saints too I think y'all would really really enjoy yourself it was just a real good atmosphere uh the Lord has just blessed them with a new building they've been ministering there in that area for 32 years and uh and just been going from place to place the pastor showed us some of the places that they had worshiped in and one specific place they had was a a church uh a sday Adventist Church that they were worshiping in and recently uh I want to say within the past two years a new pastor came into that church and told them uh y'all too big to be here and we don't want y'all here no more y'all got to find somewhere else to go and um and even the pastor told him said we we need we need a group that we can control and we can't control y'all all right so they they kicked them out to church and they ended up going to a school and uh worshiping and then um the Lord just provided a place for them uh to purchase and you know they they went in they saw this place it was a church church that had um in like a warehouse a warehouse district and uh a Pentecostal group had the church and they had they got down about eight members and this place could seat maybe about 250 people and they got down about eight members and they said you know we just need to sell this cuz you know this nothing really happening so um I think the the church showed up on the market it was on the market for about 2 hours they went they saw it and then they said we want to come back tomorrow when it came back there was like two other groups wanted to come see it and one group was um a Muslim and um so you know they they put in the offer then the Muslims put in a higher offer then they put in an offer then the Muslims put in a higher offer and they were just and they got to the point where they got they could not offer any more than what they could so they felt led to write a letter to the pastor of the church and say look we've been 32 years in Ministry just waiting on the Lord to open up a door for us and we we we we really feel like we found a place but we just cannot uh compete with the the offers that keep going this is much as we can give and we just pray y'all consider it said when they wrote the letter that touched the people's heart and they said we don't we're not going to take the higher offer we're going to give it to y'all because we want a church to have this not turn it into a mosque right so the Lord blessed them with this building and I tell you it is so nice uh I said I'm leaving here encourag um and I feel like amen just letting the devil know we next we next so we we thank God for amen what the Lord has done for them amen we got a a hand up here anybody else need to okay all right we'll get around we got a couple hands all right praise the Lord uh just a testimony from uh last week with the hurricane uh so place I live at so a tornado actually uh hit around our backyard and it only took down like uh two trees didn't do too much damage and took down like a couple fruit trees but in the next door's neighbor it flipped their whole trailer over turned it into the canal ripped their whole water system out and then the person behind us um other the person behind them ripped some of the roof off and as you go to the neighborhood uh Big Trees were uprooted but in our little place that we live at that's the only thing that was done no damage to the house and the Lord just protected us cuz the that's literally the tornado came through the backyard you can see where it came from and it didn't do any damage to the house and so just let's praise the Lord for that amen praise God God bless a couple of weeks ago I am I asked for prayer for a young man that came to my job that was 2 4 years old um he he passed away and his family is actually going through a lot they was getting ready to celebrate his birthday so instead of them celebrating his birthday they c um getting ready to bury him so just keep the parents of the family in prayer okay all right amen sure sister Brown I just want to Pig you back off what sister Verna said um come to find out uh that young man Dante is my bonus son terence's nephew his sister April that's her child it's a first child and um the family is really going through quite a bit right now so we ask him for prayer anybody else amen I just want to give go praise also for the um storm I was um I I I was out a couple of nights late trying to get water and gas like everybody else and so I would get home late and I didn't have time to get the things in in the yard so on Wednesday when they let us go home early Mike um I'm sorry Mike Ashley had to work and I wasn't able to get the things in the house um with her help so I had to do everything by myself and it it it started to rain and I'm like Lord I need you to hold up this rain I can get these things in it drizzled a couple time like Lord I need few more minutes I'm not done stop I mean it it did this on and off for several times and I'm and I'm like no I'm not done yet Lord I need just a few more minutes and and I tell you I was out there for about 2 and a half hours and then Ashley came home and helped like the last 30 minutes and after we finish got in the house and it started raining so and God has done that for me several times since I've been at that location and I just thank him for that praise God praise the Lord amen any any other praise reports prayer requests okay all right okay all right let's uh let's have a a word of prayer amen father we um thank you that we can come to you and um know that you are everpresent help in the time of trouble we hear the testimonies Lord of how you watched over us through the storm it could have been a whole different story but God you you proved um uh that it shall not come nigh our dwelling a thousand may fall at our side and 10,000 at our right hand but it shall not come nigh our dwelling thank you Father for your promised word thank you for uh sustaining us and and just um Lord just watch Nos and uh we it's it was unprecedented some of the things that that they reported but uh but God you prove faithful uh once again you always do it over and over again so God we we're just so grateful uh for that and and we we do want to remember those that are suffering uh those that have lost houses and they've lost cars and and got even some families there where life is lost loss we pray that you would just sustain and help the people and and uh even help us to minister to those that might be uh in need father this uh family that's lost um um this young man young very young uh we know that you don't make mistakes we know that you uh have purpose in everything that you do but we pray that you will underg each and every one of them uh we realize that sometimes in order for someone to live something else has to die so God we pray that life would come out of this that someone would come to know Christ as their savior uh may they be reminded that uh Lord we don't know when we're going to be called
