[34:59] I'm gonna read a scripture here tonight
[35:02] Thank You musicians appreciate you
[35:04] although close dear but before we
[35:09] actually read this and I want to pray a
[35:13] prayer I was listening to the Prophet
[35:17] law earlier today and the message it's
[35:21] actually adoption part three but the
[35:23] original title was manifested sons of
[35:26] God and he was just talking about going
[35:31] after different ones that that kind of
[35:35] got away a little bit from the faith and
[35:37] there was a brother that told him said
[35:40] why you why you keep going after while
[35:42] you keep going after them and I say you
[35:45] know it's just the love of God in my
[35:47] heart that just keeps me going after
[35:49] different ones he said I'm gonna keep
[35:52] going after me until I catch him right
[35:55] about how the Lord just let him just to
[35:58] keep going after this person just you
[35:59] know kept after him kept after him till
[36:01] finally he called him and brought him
[36:02] back amen to the fool and the devil is
[36:07] busy a man that that was busy and after
[36:10] he made that comment he said there was a
[36:11] prayer that he prayed for a sister that
[36:14] had lost a mind and he prayed a prayer
[36:16] and say the Holy Spirit went after her
[36:19] and brought her back a mentor a right
[36:22] mind so tonight I just have a burden in
[36:24] my heart I know the devil fighting folk
[36:26] I know we're going through trial
[36:28] that's why I was trying to encourage the
[36:30] church one more battle for justice you
[36:32] don't know if this is the final wine
[36:34] right just just keep persevering Goten I
[36:36] mean somehow press through this thing a
[36:39] man and I mean you will overcome so I
[36:42] want to just pray a prayer that I'll
[36:44] just go after a man different ones that
[36:47] might be going through and we also I got
[36:49] a prayer request earlier a man for
[36:58] sister Tanya sister shonda's
[37:01] brother-in-law I understand he had a
[37:03] heart attack
[37:05] a man earlier today so we want to pray
[37:08] for him and that God would just touch
[37:10] his body a man during this time
[37:13] praise the Lord so I want to read the
[37:16] same scripture that we read on Sunday
[37:18] just Ephesians part of it because we've
[37:20] never really got a chance to go there
[37:22] and I just want to share from that
[37:26] tonight a man I'll tell you what if you
[37:31] would just stand with me and I'll read
[37:32] Amen this I'll just read the first two
[37:38] verses of this region 6 verse 10 to 11
[37:42] but I will comment on all of it so let's
[37:47] just read this we'll have word of Prayer
[37:48] and I'll let you be seated verse 10 says
[37:50] finally my brethren be strong in the
[37:52] Lord and then the power of his might put
[37:54] on the whole armour of God that you may
[37:56] be able to stand against the wiles of
[37:58] the devil
[37:58] Amen let's pray tonight father we thank
[38:01] you for the word that we can read but we
[38:05] pray the Holy Spirit would bring clarity
[38:08] and understanding to us as we proceed
[38:12] down a little thought here tonight and
[38:14] and got our arm we have a burden a heart
[38:17] to go after those that are in battle
[38:20] maybe somebody's been wounded in the
[38:22] battle and God it's our responsibility
[38:25] to try to strengthen them through the
[38:27] word somehow just get them to to keep
[38:30] pressing the baton this hour and Lord to
[38:32] get back out on the battlefield we want
[38:35] to send a prayer to go after those that
[38:37] are that are in the midst of it right
[38:39] now just don't know which way to turn
[38:40] may they turn to you God
[38:42] and may you bring clarity and
[38:44] understanding to them the enemy that is
[38:47] troubling their minds we bind father
[38:49] right now in the name of Jesus you told
[38:51] us what we bound on earth shall be bound
[38:53] in heaven what we loose on earth shall
[38:54] be loosed in heaven so we lose the
[38:56] Spirit of God to go after those sons and
[38:59] daughters of God and bring them to a
[39:01] place Lord of remembrance and father
[39:04] made a Holy Ghost just get all the glory
[39:06] and all the honor from restoring sons
[39:09] and restoring daughters and God we just
[39:11] we just trust that you would do the work
[39:12] that amen that only you can do we see
[39:15] you're already working in our midst and
[39:17] anytime we see you at work we know the
[39:19] devil is gonna come and try to do
[39:21] something but father we we recognize him
[39:23] and and we we call his bluff
[39:27] and father we we thank you for victory
[39:29] in advance in Jesus name we pray amen
[39:32] amen god bless you you can be seated
[39:36] amen let me just read a little something
[39:40] here I want to go back to this scripture
[39:41] if we can I didn't read this on Sunday
[39:44] but a couple of things that I'd like to
[39:46] try to read here out of time-tested
[39:47] memorials of God a man just a few quotes
[39:50] here and we want to just look at the
[39:53] scripture time-tested memorials of God
[39:56] brother Branham said if he went to that
[39:58] much trouble to be sure that the bridge
[40:01] would be safe how much trouble do you
[40:03] think God went to to be sure this church
[40:05] would be safe says yes sir there's a
[40:08] memorial to the death of Christ amen
[40:11] that's his church some people don't want
[40:14] to live it some people will but it's
[40:17] testing time God's testing people today
[40:20] for his memorials a man a lot of times
[40:25] people say oh I'm so tempted blessed it
[40:27] be the name of the Lord for the
[40:28] temptations now that's really something
[40:30] I says I'm so tempted but blessed be the
[40:33] name of the Lord for the temptations
[40:35] right don't-don't-don't complain about
[40:37] them but thank God that you being
[40:39] tempted a man says when I am weak then
[40:42] I'm strong said Paul every sum that
[40:46] cometh to God must first be tried and
[40:49] tested and these things are more sweeter
[40:52] to you and dearer to you than precious
[40:54] gold is
[40:56] testing time I love I love the way he
[40:59] puts that and and often times we run
[41:01] from the test but Amen God wants us to
[41:03] embrace it because that's what's
[41:05] actually proving our character right one
[41:09] of the things that the prophets say a
[41:10] person is who they are when they're
[41:12] under pressure right when you see a
[41:15] person get under pressure the decisions
[41:17] that they make at that point in time
[41:19] that that demonstrates that shows who
[41:21] they really are right you can mask it
[41:24] you can make people thank you one way
[41:26] but let's put you under a little
[41:27] pressure and see how you respond then we
[41:30] know who you are right so so don't run
[41:32] from it let me just keep going he says
[41:34] long years ago before they had the
[41:35] smelters they used to take the gold and
[41:39] how they would know how it was right or
[41:41] not with all the but with all the
[41:45] sludge was out of it all of the iron
[41:47] pyrite that's fool's gold all the fools
[41:51] out of it the beaters beat it and beat
[41:53] it and turned it and beat it and turned
[41:57] it until the beater sees his reflection
[41:59] in the gold right and there's a
[42:01] statement there in Malachi I believe the
[42:05] book of Malachi where they talk about
[42:06] being underneath the refiners fire and
[42:09] there was a a person a young lady access
[42:12] this man she saw him working at her
[42:14] refiners fire with these different
[42:17] materials and and he would just sit
[42:19] sitting in the fire then he walk away
[42:21] from him right then he put just come
[42:23] back to it and just turn it a little bit
[42:25] then he walk away from it
[42:26] then he turn a little bit morning walk
[42:27] away from it and the girl just kept
[42:29] watching this process go on and on and
[42:31] she finally actually say now now sir I
[42:33] just need to ask when is it time to
[42:37] bring it out of the fire yeah I see you
[42:39] keep turning in everything but when is
[42:41] it time to bring the thing out of the
[42:42] fire he said oh that's easy and she said
[42:46] well when is it time you should say as
[42:47] soon as I can see my reflection in it
[42:49] then I know it's time to come out to
[42:51] fire right and and until God sees its
[42:55] reflection in us we're gonna get turned
[42:57] this way and we're gonna get turned that
[42:59] way and we're gonna get turned this way
[43:01] and and we it's just gonna be a constant
[43:03] turning in the fire notice the turning
[43:06] does not happen out the fire
[43:08] the turning happens inside the fire amen
[43:12] the turnin happens in the test the
[43:15] turning happens in the trial so don't
[43:18] run from the trial run to it because
[43:20] gosh trying to get his reflection out of
[43:22] you glory to God you say that's the way
[43:25] God does his church he gives you trial
[43:28] after trial test after test test after
[43:32] test until the life of Christ is
[43:33] reflected in your life until you become
[43:36] peaceful sober meek gentle humble ready
[43:45] submissive willing to turn your hair
[43:48] from the things of the world now though
[43:50] these are key statements here right
[43:52] because some of us we still got our eye
[43:54] on things in the world but when you
[43:56] willing to turn your head from the
[43:57] things the world and look straight to
[43:59] Calvary to the one who's doing the
[44:01] beating many times you think it's
[44:03] strange because fiery trials and
[44:05] sickness and persecutions it's only done
[44:08] to test you to get the dirt out of you
[44:11] to get the sludge out of you to get the
[44:14] slowness out of you to wake you up to a
[44:18] place where you can look and see the
[44:19] reflection now I love they say so or
[44:21] make you see the reflection of Christ in
[44:23] you Christ in you the hope of the hope
[44:24] of glory and I love that to get the
[44:26] snowless out of you you know I'll tell
[44:28] you what when you're going through
[44:29] trials you're going through tests you're
[44:31] going through tribulation it calls you
[44:33] to pray a little bit more right when you
[44:35] got everything good you don't pray as
[44:37] much as you do
[44:38] glory to God Amen there's a lot I mean
[44:42] when you're going Easy Street right amen
[44:45] it takes to press out but when you when
[44:50] you're going through it man I'm pressing
[44:51] into the house of God and I'm believing
[44:53] God it make you worship a little
[44:56] different glory to God amen your prayer
[44:59] is more sincere when you're going
[45:02] through
[45:02] all right glory to God so God know how
[45:04] to get these things out of us and and
[45:06] it's it's necessary in order to bring us
[45:09] into the place where he wants us to be a
[45:11] man number of other quotes here that I
[45:15] won't just want to read let's look at
[45:16] this side of smyrnaean church age glory
[45:19] to God Smyrna church age and I want you
[45:22] to
[45:22] Stannis there's one of my favorites to
[45:24] cloudy skies and the storms of life are
[45:29] no signs of God's disapproval o blessed
[45:32] be the name of love she not see
[45:34] sometimes we start going through and we
[45:36] think what god don't love me no no no no
[45:38] no no no no you're missing it the cloudy
[45:40] skies and the storms of life are no
[45:43] signs of God's disapproval right
[45:46] neither are bright skies in still waters
[45:49] signs of his love and approval his
[45:52] approval of any of us is only in the
[45:55] beloved his love is elective which he
[45:58] had for us before the foundation of
[45:59] world does he love us ah yes but how
[46:03] shall we know we shall know because he
[46:07] said so and manifested that he did love
[46:11] us for he brought us to himself and
[46:13] Galya gave us of his spirit placing us
[46:16] as sons and how shall I prove my love to
[46:19] him I love this by believing what he
[46:22] said and conducted myself with joy midst
[46:26] the trials that he and his wisdom allow
[46:28] us to come to pass now that means while
[46:30] you're going through you got to put a
[46:31] smile on your face Amen why are you
[46:33] going through no complaining right why
[46:36] are you going through give God glory
[46:37] amen give them praise give them up no
[46:39] matter what it is that you're facing a
[46:41] man like my brother say take it like a
[46:43] man right I like that a man take it like
[46:47] a man Lord okay this what you gave me
[46:49] I'm gonna I'm gonna embrace it I'm gonna
[46:51] keep pressing on hallelujah I ain't
[46:54] talked about quittin a man I'm talking
[46:56] about pressing on thank you Jesus
[46:59] a man I'll write a couple more here and
[47:01] then I just want to bring this just
[47:03] scripture actually I to it let me let's
[47:07] let's let's read the scripture here go
[47:09] back to Ephesians 6 and verse verse 10 I
[47:12] was I just got some notes here in my
[47:15] Bible the Study Bible that I used and
[47:18] and I'm not one that's really big on the
[47:20] notes in the Study Bible sometime they
[47:22] hid things that are that are good
[47:24] because I know that these are just
[47:25] thoughts of theologians and and I don't
[47:28] necessarily like to promote the thoughts
[47:30] of theologians when we got to vindicate
[47:31] a prophet but sometimes people say
[47:34] something that's right
[47:35] and you know and I don't mind Amen if
[47:38] it's right the Holy Spirit ain't you can
[47:40] agree with what's right and even the
[47:42] Prophet taught us that when we when
[47:44] we're eating pie if we hit a seat just
[47:47] push push it to the side right if we
[47:49] eaten chicken we hit a bone just push it
[47:51] to the side but he said just make sure
[47:52] it's a bone all right
[47:55] so sometimes we run into some things
[47:57] that other people might say hey that's
[47:58] alright that'll help me that'll
[48:00] strengthen me so I don't mind you know
[48:02] using that so there's there's a couple
[48:03] comments that I want to make here that
[48:05] these theologians made as they were
[48:07] presenting the scripture verse 10 says
[48:10] finally my brethren be strong in the
[48:11] Lord and in the power of his might a man
[48:19] and and just a statement on the word
[48:22] finally okay that I have here in my
[48:25] Bible says finally maybe render from now
[48:28] oh right what finally means it's from
[48:31] now on okay or henceforth all right from
[48:36] now on or henceforth that means and it
[48:38] says the spiritual battle Christians are
[48:40] engaged in exists from now on a man
[48:47] finally means your battle exists from
[48:50] now on that means you gonna get victory
[48:52] and you're gonna get another victory and
[48:55] you're gonna get another victory and the
[48:56] reason I get a victory and another
[48:58] victor in another victors because you're
[48:59] gonna have a battle and another battle
[49:01] and another battle right from now on
[49:04] finally means from now oh oh my god it's
[49:09] not gonna stop here it's not gonna stop
[49:13] it's just getting started and let me
[49:15] just read you you know these notes here
[49:17] says the spiritual battle Christians are
[49:20] engaged in exist from now on look at
[49:22] this until the Lord's return until we
[49:27] get out of here amen that the battle
[49:29] exists from now on until the Lord's
[49:30] return and look at what they say there
[49:32] is no quarter given
[49:34] right there is no ceasefire oh my god
[49:40] amen there there is no no temporary
[49:43] truce that's what they say no no no
[49:47] quarter given no cease
[49:49] you can't you can't make an agreement
[49:51] with the devil here you got it you got
[49:53] it
[49:53] what are we just gonna have to stop this
[49:54] fighting Satan we got the stuff I'm
[49:56] gonna draw up an agreement a contract
[49:58] that we gonna ceasefire as soon as he
[50:01] signs the document he'll start firing on
[50:05] you you can't trust the devil so rather
[50:10] than trying to drop a contract with the
[50:13] devil destroy the devil no ceasefire in
[50:20] this church right when you when you look
[50:22] at that finally that's what we're
[50:23] looking at no ceasefire no stopping amen
[50:26] and and I read the quote on Sunday how
[50:28] you know Satan gonna fight until he's
[50:31] cast into the lake of fire yeah that's a
[50:34] job you know some of the so maybe some
[50:37] of my young people don't realize this
[50:39] but as you get older you're gonna
[50:40] realize this y'all complaining about
[50:43] what happened on your job and you want
[50:46] to get a new job go ahead go ahead get
[50:49] one get one but I don't care where you
[50:52] work that person that was driving you
[50:56] crazy
[50:57] not a name gonna change when you get to
[51:01] the next job it's gonna be a different
[51:02] one with a different thing you want to
[51:04] know why because you're not it sit right
[51:09] here in verse verse 12 for we wrestle
[51:11] not against flesh and blood this is why
[51:19] you need to understand you're finally
[51:21] right there is no ceasefire there is no
[51:24] truth there is no change it's gonna be
[51:27] in a same old devil no matter where you
[51:31] go is the same ol devil you can you can
[51:34] even be in a Christian environment and
[51:41] you still gonna fight Devils yeah it's
[51:44] not the person that you're coming up
[51:46] against it's the devil and every time
[51:49] he'd come to bring some ministers he's
[51:51] actually bringing that greatness in you
[51:54] you understand that God allows the devil
[51:57] to bring greatness out of you but you
[52:00] don't you do you don't you know you're
[52:01] missing it you're not getting
[52:03] yes right so that this way you gotta
[52:05] finally your final is that that there is
[52:07] no ceasefire there is no stopping there
[52:10] is no truth there is no there's no
[52:12] getting away from it I'm gonna run from
[52:15] this I'm getting out of this sitting at
[52:16] you I'm stepping out this fire actually
[52:20] they say out of the frying pan into the
[52:22] fire
[52:22] you know I'm getting out this frying pan
[52:25] you ain't firing out you ain't fire you
[52:31] actually had a little son protecting you
[52:32] before it was hot but you had a little
[52:36] protection
[52:37] but now you you up in the fire you can't
[52:42] run from it and when you're getting the
[52:45] fire guess what's gonna happen little
[52:46] turn here another little turn then
[52:49] another little turn here turn here and
[52:53] every time we turn it's a reason we turn
[52:55] it because I'm waiting to see my
[52:56] reflection one more bad or y'all right
[53:03] Amen I mean you got to keep fighting and
[53:05] this is what we talk about when we when
[53:07] we're putting on this whole arm of God
[53:08] and you know just you got to understand
[53:11] this is this is until you get out of
[53:13] here
[53:15] amen amen glory to God well I thought
[53:18] for sure I had it made oh boy they did
[53:23] me wrong 14 years on a job and I'm like
[53:26] man this is just wrong the way these
[53:27] folk just did me I thought I had myself
[53:31] a a place of refuge a place where I
[53:37] could be healed from my hurt for years
[53:49] but the devil's gonna do it in Jesus
[53:53] name
[53:56] it's the same exact trial in the same
[54:00] Devils in our Lord okay God ain't no
[54:02] sense to me fighting this you know all
[54:04] right I'm gonna just take you at your
[54:05] word but I'm just I'm just here to tell
[54:08] you Church it's there is no ceasefire
[54:10] there's no stopping right and after you
[54:13] come through this one this one actually
[54:15] preparing you for the next one
[54:17] amen I'm not saying don't go get another
[54:21] job go get one just understand when you
[54:24] get it that devil that you saw you gonna
[54:27] be working there he actually might find
[54:32] out the other person unchanged got saved
[54:33] and everything now you got there's a new
[54:36] devil over here that devil just just I
[54:39] mean he got cast out of this one and now
[54:41] he own this one alright don't run from
[54:45] it run to it alright let me keep going
[54:47] so so finally is it maybe render from
[54:51] now on or henceforth the spiritual
[54:53] battle of Christians you are engaged and
[54:55] exist from now on until the Lord's
[54:57] return there is no quarter given no
[54:59] ceasefire no temporary truce no
[55:03] cessation of hostilities right there
[55:08] from now on to the end there is all-out
[55:12] war from now on to the end there is
[55:18] all-out war the remainder of the verse
[55:22] maybe pair of a paraphrase let
[55:25] yourselves constantly be strengthened by
[55:28] the Lord more precisely by his mighty
[55:31] power because it's gonna be all-out war
[55:36] amen
[55:37] forget about your peace agreement with
[55:39] the devil it ain't gonna happen
[55:42] alright let's let's look at this put on
[55:46] the whole armour of God that you may be
[55:48] able to stand against the wiles of the
[55:50] devil and what they're saying here to
[55:52] stand has military overtones right to
[55:57] stand it has military overtones this
[56:02] verb was used in classical Greek meaning
[56:04] to resist the enemy and hold a critical
[56:08] position in battle right so when you're
[56:11] in battle you got to hold your critical
[56:13] position don't don't give that to the
[56:15] enemy once you got it once you've gone
[56:17] into something you know don't give up
[56:18] that little spot amen it might be it
[56:21] might be the the difference between
[56:23] defeat or victory glory to God I mean I
[56:26] was telling you how George Washington
[56:28] got those guys
[56:30] for battles like look if they give up if
[56:32] they retreat they go back now then we're
[56:34] gonna lose but they took a critical
[56:37] position in the hail to their position
[56:39] go over to God and by them holding to
[56:42] their position it calls George
[56:43] Washington even George Washington wrote
[56:46] amen in between the battle the battle
[56:48] lines he was shot at many times they
[56:51] even said they saw bullet holes in his
[56:53] jacket but don't know how he didn't get
[56:55] his horses went down his jacket is all
[56:59] got bullet holes through it but he
[57:01] didn't go down it took courage for a man
[57:04] to do something like that but when the
[57:06] went went went when his soldiers saw him
[57:08] doing that it caused him to want to
[57:10] fight a little bit more too and because
[57:12] they held their position they overcame
[57:15] the British Army and America is America
[57:18] today because of that battle so to stand
[57:22] right to stand has military over terms
[57:26] or overtones says this verb was used in
[57:30] classical Greek meanings to resist the
[57:32] enemy and hold a critical position in
[57:34] battle the wiles of the devil so you
[57:36] stand against the wiles of the devil and
[57:38] this says the wiles of the devil is is
[57:41] or the devil strategy Satan carefully
[57:45] devises schemes and tactics against
[57:49] believers I want y'all to catch that one
[57:52] Satan carefully devised the schemes and
[57:55] tactics against the enemy and notice
[57:58] what the next verse says so if Satan is
[58:00] carefully devising schemes and tactics
[58:03] against the believers catch this next
[58:08] verse for we wrestle not against flesh
[58:12] and blood so what that should tell you
[58:16] that sometimes Satan uses those that's
[58:19] closest to you and if you're not able to
[58:24] discern and withstand and you get
[58:28] emotional you're gonna get defeated
[58:36] remember Jesus he has somebody really
[58:39] loved him Peter Peter loved them Peter
[58:43] would fight
[58:44] do all kind of stuff but we know Peter
[58:46] Peter made a comment and then Jesus
[58:49] telling how he had to go to the cross
[58:51] and he had to do this and he had to do
[58:52] that in appealing like no no no no you
[58:53] came to that he just kind of rebuking
[58:55] the Lord and Jesus had to tell Peter
[58:59] actually he wasn't talking to Peter he
[59:02] knew who was talking through Peter so he
[59:05] just said get thee behind me Peter he
[59:07] said get thee behind me Satan because
[59:10] Satan was talking through Peter yeah
[59:15] our families can't be anointed by the
[59:17] devil they can be anointed by the Holy
[59:20] Ghost or they can be an honored by the
[59:22] devil the devil will use those that's
[59:25] closest to you hey man that's why yeah
[59:31] you're not you're not wrestling against
[59:32] flesh and blood that's not what they
[59:34] said that's why I said it's not a flesh
[59:35] and blood affair and then the Bible
[59:38] actually tells us who we're wrestling it
[59:39] look at it say for we wrestle not
[59:40] against flesh and blood but against
[59:44] principalities against powers against
[59:49] the rulers of the darkness of this of
[59:52] this world against spiritual wickedness
[59:55] in high places all right
[1:00:00] so you know here we're wrestling and we
[1:00:03] got to understand that this is not a
[1:00:06] flesh and blood affair this is a
[1:00:07] spiritual battle
[1:00:08] therefore we need spiritual armor in
[1:00:11] order to overcome hallelujah so the
[1:00:14] spiritual armor is found here in verse
[1:00:16] 13 Estelle tells us wherefore take unto
[1:00:23] it says wherefore wherefore take unto
[1:00:26] you the whole armour of God that you may
[1:00:28] be able to withstand in the evil day and
[1:00:31] having done all to stand stand all right
[1:00:35] now let me just work with verse 13 for a
[1:00:38] little bit but again we have to have a
[1:00:40] almost remember I said this has military
[1:00:44] overtones okay that this has military
[1:00:47] overtones so when you got a military
[1:00:50] overtone then you have to approach it
[1:00:53] with a military approach
[1:00:57] now most most soldiers in there with a
[1:01:00] military approach there is serious
[1:01:02] business with them right it's not joking
[1:01:04] it's not laughing it's not it is serious
[1:01:06] business and and and and I mean you got
[1:01:08] a job to do you work for the army right
[1:01:11] so you got you just I mean it's it is
[1:01:13] what it is you get an order you got to
[1:01:15] carry it out bottom line right and we
[1:01:18] got orders from heaven that we got to
[1:01:20] carry out we got to stand for this
[1:01:22] worked hey man look at it glory to God
[1:01:25] now I I want to just I just want to it's
[1:01:27] a little note here that says we're for
[1:01:29] out of verse 13 wherefore means because
[1:01:32] of this that is because we face such a
[1:01:37] formidable foe we must avail ourselves
[1:01:40] of God's provision lest the enemy
[1:01:42] destroy our Christian witness and
[1:01:44] ministry right the evil day refers to
[1:01:47] the periodic demonic onslaught and
[1:01:50] satanic assaults having done all
[1:01:52] includes both dressing oneself in God's
[1:01:54] armor and resisting Satan so not only do
[1:01:59] you dress yourself in the armor but then
[1:02:01] you got to resist the devil and this
[1:02:03] this is every believer right says I am
[1:02:05] resisting Satan having done all these be
[1:02:08] ready for the devil I'm just reading a
[1:02:12] nose I'm reading a nose look he says
[1:02:14] having done all includes both dressing
[1:02:17] oneself in God's armor and resisting
[1:02:20] Satan haven't done all these be ready
[1:02:23] for the devil will attack again and
[1:02:26] again no break no letting up he gonna
[1:02:34] attack again and again glory to God
[1:02:36] glory to God if I was the accident
[1:02:38] question how many of y'all left Sunday
[1:02:40] and went under attack right after the
[1:02:45] service if I was accessed telling you
[1:02:48] how to devil do things you in church
[1:02:50] amen
[1:02:51] glory as soon as you leave here he don't
[1:02:58] care you don't care I mean this just
[1:03:04] just just the church we got to
[1:03:06] understand this is this is a real battle
[1:03:08] this is a real battle and
[1:03:10] and we have to we have to prepare
[1:03:12] ourselves accordingly
[1:03:15] hey man it's not gonna stop so don't
[1:03:18] don't don't even don't don't worry about
[1:03:20] the truce hey man this is all-out war
[1:03:22] unto the end
[1:03:25] glory to God all right can I go I like I
[1:03:30] like some of these other things they set
[1:03:31] here so a verse 14 says stand therefore
[1:03:36] stand therefore take a military stance
[1:03:39] stand therefore having your loins Girt
[1:03:42] about with truth and having on the
[1:03:45] breastplate of righteousness now I want
[1:03:48] to just want to bring out a couple of
[1:03:49] things here they say truth is a
[1:03:51] knowledge of the truth of God's Word
[1:03:54] right so truth is a knowledge now
[1:03:56] remember I share with you on Sunday how
[1:03:58] when Jesus defeated the devil heeding
[1:04:01] you superpowers he used he uses the one
[1:04:05] thing that the weakest Christian can
[1:04:07] always use and that's the word of God he
[1:04:09] used it is written and that put the
[1:04:11] devil in his place but if you read your
[1:04:13] Scripture carefully after Jesus defeated
[1:04:16] those three wall attacks of the devil
[1:04:18] amen the Bible says that the devil left
[1:04:21] him for a season I mean here come the
[1:04:25] devil again with another trial if the
[1:04:29] devil wouldn't stop messing with Jesus
[1:04:32] you're not gonna stop messing with you
[1:04:35] I'm in brother Billy Paul please daddy
[1:04:38] I'm just so tired of the devil he always
[1:04:39] owned me he always only say son stop
[1:04:42] complaining just stop complaining say
[1:04:44] what'd he say he said son if he's always
[1:04:47] after you and always owned you that mean
[1:04:49] he don't have you another statement that
[1:04:58] they made here that I want y'all to get
[1:05:00] because it taught us that stand
[1:05:02] therefore having your loins Girt about
[1:05:03] with truth now it says the ancient
[1:05:06] soldiers lowens the waist right we're
[1:05:10] gird about with a leather belt which
[1:05:12] he'll most of the other pieces of its
[1:05:14] armor in place right and so this you
[1:05:18] know if you don't have truth of the word
[1:05:21] of God then it's not gonna hold
[1:05:23] everything else in place
[1:05:24] right if you don't know if you don't
[1:05:26] know the scripture amen the devil can
[1:05:28] just throw anything at you but you got
[1:05:30] to know where you stand
[1:05:31] any man Church right so so I mean come
[1:05:34] in and notice I told you that the devil
[1:05:36] used somehow to try to bring the word to
[1:05:38] you
[1:05:38] they just twist it up a little bit
[1:05:40] that's why you got it you better be
[1:05:42] listening to the tapes yourself you
[1:05:44] better be getting to understanding for
[1:05:45] what the prophets saying yourself you
[1:05:47] better be reading your Bible yourself
[1:05:49] glory to God let God speak to you
[1:05:51] because otherwise you'll be all confused
[1:05:53] amen
[1:05:54] he says this the breastplate of
[1:05:56] righteousness it represents a holy
[1:06:01] character holy character and moral
[1:06:04] conduct now I'm reading their notes I'm
[1:06:06] reading notes from my Bible the
[1:06:07] breastplate of righteousness all right
[1:06:10] is found in verse 14 their stand
[1:06:13] therefore having your loins gird about
[1:06:14] with truth and having having on the
[1:06:16] breastplate of righteousness they say
[1:06:17] the breastplate of righteousness a man
[1:06:20] represents a holy character and moral
[1:06:23] conduct obedience to the truth now I
[1:06:27] want to make sure we get this for
[1:06:28] obedience to the truth no produces a
[1:06:34] godly life righteousness obedience to
[1:06:38] the truth no hallelujah
[1:06:44] obedience to the truth no produces a
[1:06:48] godly life of righteousness everybody
[1:06:51] that I have seen come against this truth
[1:06:55] that's known the one that's revealed
[1:06:58] through God's prophet William Marion
[1:07:00] Branham everybody that forsakes that
[1:07:02] stops living a holy life I didn't think
[1:07:07] that this just theologians no theologian
[1:07:11] said obedience that's what the
[1:07:13] breastplate of righteousness is that
[1:07:16] almost tells me that you can't even put
[1:07:18] on the armor if you not follow the truth
[1:07:28] if you're not gonna follow truth how you
[1:07:30] gonna put on the armor right how you
[1:07:33] gonna be girded about if you don't if
[1:07:35] you don't have the true knowledge of the
[1:07:37] Word of God you don't have true
[1:07:38] revelation how you gonna be dressed
[1:07:39] properly you know that this word is what
[1:07:43] dresses us for the rapture the reveal
[1:07:45] word dresses us a man Church so so
[1:07:50] without truth you you you already defeat
[1:07:52] it but obedience to the truth no the
[1:08:00] obedience to the truth known produces a
[1:08:03] godly life of righteousness that was to
[1:08:07] me very powerful and it goes on to say
[1:08:11] this in verse 15 and your feet shod with
[1:08:19] the preparation of the gospel of peace
[1:08:23] now they made a statement that the
[1:08:28] preparation of the gospel of peace means
[1:08:30] eagerness that comes from the gospel of
[1:08:32] peace that is as the Roman soldier wore
[1:08:35] special shoes called Cala Gate on his
[1:08:38] feet this DS D shoes and able him to
[1:08:42] advance against his enemy not a shoes
[1:08:45] that they were they were wearing it
[1:08:46] helped them advance against the enemy
[1:08:49] now they made a statement says so the
[1:08:52] Christian must have on his feet a sense
[1:08:55] of eagerness or willingness to advance
[1:08:59] against the devil and take the fight to
[1:09:02] him so when your feet is a sharp with
[1:09:05] the preparation of the gospel of peace
[1:09:06] you can actually take the fight to the
[1:09:08] devil I don't mean you have to always be
[1:09:12] on the defence but sometimes you can be
[1:09:15] on the offense now
[1:09:16] remember David David saw Goliath come
[1:09:20] out and right now this guy just keep
[1:09:22] defined you know and let me just put it
[1:09:24] this way I'm not saying go look for

[1:11:05] delivery this went into my hand to say

[1:11:14] fight the enemy now if Saul gonna give
[1:11:17] him his armor sword and even trust his
[1:11:20] own armor but gonna give it to David
[1:11:23] David said I can't fight with none of
[1:11:25] this I never proved none of these things
[1:11:28] keep your armor I got a slingshot and
[1:11:31] I'm picking five rocks on my way and I'm
[1:11:34] gonna fight this devil see he was ready
[1:11:37] to advance against the enemy and there
[1:11:40] comes a time when sometimes you just got
[1:11:41] to stand up now I just say go looking
[1:11:44] for it but sometimes you got to stand up
[1:11:47] I can give you two quick examples from
[1:11:49] the Prophet one time he was in a meeting
[1:11:51] and he saw demons man
[1:11:53] vesting in the supernatural it was
[1:11:56] manifesting it was take they took a
[1:11:57] table and picked it up in the in the
[1:11:58] middle of the room and and they say
[1:12:01] anybody here strong enough to pull it
[1:12:03] down pull it down they got a couple of
[1:12:04] men and walk up and try to pull the
[1:12:06] table down could not get the table down
[1:12:09] demons manifested but brother branham
[1:12:12] you know look they say that's the devil
[1:12:13] they say they say you know you say this
[1:12:15] w pull it down said no ain't got time
[1:12:18] for this this is devil and so finally
[1:12:20] they try and say you you you your
[1:12:22] preacher the Gospels yesterday you you
[1:12:23] think is the devil he said yeah it is he
[1:12:26] say he said but it's not of God he said
[1:12:28] you think you know I'll tell you what he
[1:12:30] say
[1:12:31] it says I'm an axe you some questions he
[1:12:35] says he says he said I can't pull it
[1:12:38] down but God can you know and he says he
[1:12:41] says in the name of the Father come down
[1:12:45] nothing in the name of the son come down
[1:12:49] nothing in the name of the the Holy
[1:12:52] Ghost come down nothing in the name of
[1:12:59] the Lord Jesus Christ come down say the
[1:13:00] table fell and broke the pieces and I
[1:13:03] didn't do that
[1:13:04] and today challenge him he had to stand
[1:13:07] up for who he was he was a believer in
[1:13:09] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:13:12] they begin to confess own again this was
[1:13:14] of the devil another time you know I was
[1:13:19] just listening recently and there was a
[1:13:21] fellow that was he was he was
[1:13:24] criticizing the Word of God and he had a
[1:13:27] whale that he had dissected that dissect
[1:13:30] it and they looked at the throat on the
[1:13:31] world and they said it's impossible for
[1:13:34] the throat of a whale to swallow a man
[1:13:37] so that story about Jonah was incorrect
[1:13:41] so brother Branham sitting there
[1:13:43] listening say something just rose up in
[1:13:44] him that he just could not let that man
[1:13:47] get away with that he'd say pardon me
[1:13:49] sir excuse me I'm sorry
[1:13:51] he said he'd say but but the Bible said
[1:13:53] that it was a a special fish prepared
[1:13:57] for Jonah that's what it didn't say well
[1:14:00] is that a special prepare fish he say so
[1:14:04] maybe not that well Consuela but the one
[1:14:07] I prepare it swallow them man you have
[1:14:11] nothing else to say everyone smile God
[1:14:13] would give you an opportunity to step up
[1:14:15] and say something now let me let me just
[1:14:17] make that clear because some of us put
[1:14:19] ourselves out there everything that go
[1:14:22] on on social media you don't have to be
[1:14:24] a part of your name ain't got to be in

[1:14:30] to be friends sometime you need to let
[1:14:36] some things come to you rather than
[1:14:37] you're going to it hello somebody

[1:16:29] gospel of peace okay and and this is so
[1:16:33] these are these are special shoes so
[1:16:35] that you can advance on the enemy when
[1:16:37] you need to all right so the other one
[1:16:40] says here above all taking the shield of
[1:16:43] faith a man and what that means it's
[1:16:47] taking God at is at his word by
[1:16:50] believing his promises and and when you
[1:16:53] have trust like this it will protect you
[1:16:55] from doubt induced by Satan take guard
[1:17:00] editors were believing all this promises
[1:17:03] it'll help protect you from doubt
[1:17:05] induced by say it was in my daily Bible
[1:17:34] reading a scripture that I ran into
[1:17:38] today and I was just going just give it
[1:17:41] to you all real quick maybe my daughter
[1:17:47] might remember what what what book an
[1:17:50] Old Testament we gone through where it's
[1:17:51] talking about these first kings what
[1:17:55] what chapter 14
[1:18:02] first Kings 14 you always throw
[1:18:08] something at you that's why you can't
[1:18:10] approach God with intellect you you have
[1:18:16] to you have to just take it take some
[1:18:19] things by faith take it by faith look at
[1:18:24] something here actually I think I want
[1:18:28] to go to chapter 15 let me just see
[1:18:32] something here or it might be in 14 I
[1:18:34] just I'm looking for yeah verse 21
[1:18:55] okay it's over in chapter 15
[1:18:59] okay yeah verse 9 and then the 20th year
[1:19:09] of Jeroboam king of Israel reign Asha
[1:19:12] over Judah forty and one years no I got
[1:19:19] it I got to go back gotta go back to
[1:19:21] verse one because I missed something
[1:19:23] okay now in the 18th year of king
[1:19:26] jeroboam the son of nebat
[1:19:28] reign a Bijan over Judah three years
[1:19:32] reign he in Jerusalem and his mother's
[1:19:35] name was Makkah
[1:19:37] the daughter of Absalom and we're
[1:19:42] talking about Abidjan our Abbey Jam
[1:19:46] reigned over Judah and his mother's name
[1:19:49] was Makkah the daughter of Absalom
[1:19:53] now let's I'm gonna go to verse 8 I'm
[1:19:56] just skip it a little bit and it says an
[1:19:58] Abidjan have slept with his fathers and
[1:20:01] they buried him in the City of David a
[1:20:03] nasa his son reigned in his stead and
[1:20:07] the 20th year of Jeroboam king of israel
[1:20:10] reign astha over Judah and 41 years
[1:20:14] reign he and Giroux
[1:20:15] and his mother's name was maka the
[1:20:18] daughter of AB Absalom who was Oscars
[1:20:26] mother
[1:20:28] maka the daughter of Absalom his daddy's
[1:20:34] name was Abby jam and his daddy's mama
[1:20:38] happen to be named maka the daughter of
[1:20:42] a bichon oh I looked at that and say
[1:20:49] wait a minute
[1:20:53] now is there a mistake here in the
[1:20:56] scripture or can see this how the devil
[1:20:58] will start playing with your mind write
[1:21:01] this how the devil start playing with
[1:21:02] your mind and if you're not if you're
[1:21:03] not careful and just wait on God just to
[1:21:05] reveal things to you see and I'm using
[1:21:07] this because these are people come
[1:21:09] against the message they find something
[1:21:11] just this small and they're trying to
[1:21:13] say it was the message must be wrong no
[1:21:14] no you go you go if you're gonna take it
[1:21:17] from that approach then you have to look
[1:21:19] at these scriptures too and actually I
[1:21:23] don't want to give the answer because
[1:21:26] it's just go out on out you find the
[1:21:30] answer or you come see me privately all
[1:21:36] right but but I want you to notice
[1:21:38] sometimes you see little things like
[1:21:39] that in Scripture and if you're not
[1:21:40] careful the devil throw you off on that
[1:21:42] but you got to wait on the Lord in order
[1:21:45] to reveal all things and one thing I
[1:21:47] will tell you this is talking about a
[1:21:49] position that this lady was having okay
[1:21:52] this was a position sometimes as mother
[1:21:55] it's a it's a position of influence
[1:21:57] glory to God and she had a certain
[1:22:00] amount of influence that asar had to
[1:22:04] come and actually tear down her idols
[1:22:06] and everything else and take her from
[1:22:07] her position right because it was a
[1:22:10] position of influence now I put this a
[1:22:14] grandma it was his grandmother but she
[1:22:17] had a position of influence now and I
[1:22:18] can also show you the same scripture
[1:22:20] where let me let me let me also this
[1:22:22] keep reading here verse 11 and acid did
[1:22:27] that which was right now as the Lord as
[1:22:29] David his father I thought Abidjan was
[1:22:34] his father Louis if you're trying to put
[1:22:41] things together with your intellect
[1:22:42] right but but all it is it's just it's
[1:22:45] it's you know you got to see things from
[1:22:47] the spirit you got to be able to read
[1:22:48] between the lines when you reading
[1:22:49] scripture and if you got to read between
[1:22:51] the lines of read scripture sometime you
[1:22:52] have to read between the lines I
[1:22:54] understand this message oh praise the
[1:22:57] Lord but watch out for that devil
[1:22:59] alright because what he's trying to do
[1:23:01] is is get you off of the Word of God
[1:23:04] and and if you can just kind of give you
[1:23:06] a little speck of doubt get you doubt in
[1:23:08] here and doubt in there then he's got
[1:23:09] you where right where he need you put on
[1:23:12] the whole armor of God all right let me
[1:23:14] finish reading this a man the shield of
[1:23:18] faith means taking God at His Word
[1:23:20] believing his promises such trust will
[1:23:24] protect one from doubt induced by seen
[1:23:27] and this helmet it says and take the
[1:23:30] helmet of salvation in this water spirit
[1:23:32] which is the word of God praying always
[1:23:34] with all prayer and supplication in the
[1:23:36] spirit and watching thereunto with all
[1:23:38] perseverance and supplication for All
[1:23:40] Saints now just a quote and we'll we'll
[1:23:45] bring it to a close here tonight a man
[1:23:47] this the Prophet makes some comments
[1:23:51] here praise the Lord this is out of the
[1:23:55] message Redemption by power so it's
[1:23:59] usually in the old soldiers when they
[1:24:01] put on those ornaments of war they had a
[1:24:03] big belt that buckled it together
[1:24:04] holding over their low ends these
[1:24:05] shields to keep the enemy Spears off
[1:24:07] what a real lesson that is to us and
[1:24:10] when the Lord begin to get weak hang
[1:24:11] down the shield they tighten up on their
[1:24:13] belt bring them up tight again what a
[1:24:16] perfect picture today when you begin to
[1:24:17] feel like you're slacking or the devil
[1:24:20] says it's no use when you feel like
[1:24:24] you're slacking or the devil says it's
[1:24:25] no use reach down and tighten up the
[1:24:28] belt a little bit pull up the sward a
[1:24:30] little tighter in the hand and go for it
[1:24:32] I like that be ready for the March okay
[1:24:36] and and this other one here I want to
[1:24:38] bring to you how the greatest battle of
[1:24:40] a fault and we'll bring it to a close
[1:24:41] here
[1:24:42] a man he says how you're going to let
[1:24:45] this helmet what what was it what was it
[1:24:48] does it's a protection what does the
[1:24:51] helmet made out of brass brass can't
[1:24:53] even be tempered hard harder than iron a
[1:24:56] brass headpiece the what the salvation
[1:24:59] knowledge of knowing this and my healing
[1:25:01] comes from my God my salvation comes
[1:25:03] from God my experience matches his word
[1:25:06] not the church's idea the word amen
[1:25:09] there you are covered over with a
[1:25:10] protection the helmet of salvation
[1:25:12] delivers take that then go marching

[1:27:38] in there and he says you know you're
[1:27:41] dead your life is here what is dead
[1:27:43] you're dead to your senses

[1:27:48] human will would say yes I guess dead to
[1:27:50] your reasoning dead to all those things
[1:27:52] and you were buried in the name of Jesus
[1:27:54] Christ and raised with him and wherever
[1:27:55] he is there you are also what happened
[1:27:59] when them one of them doubters God in
[1:28:01] heaven God kicked him out and what did
[1:28:04] he say to the soldiers that raised in
[1:28:06] Christ when a devil when when a devil
[1:28:09] comes along kick him out look notice
[1:28:13] those those words didn't say pet him and
[1:28:15] play with him and compromise with him
[1:28:18] kick him out
[1:28:19] cast him out when Jesus trained
[1:28:22] disarming commissioned him to the ends
[1:28:23] of the world go into all the world
[1:28:25] preach the gospel to every creature he
[1:28:26] that believeth in his baptized shall be
[1:28:28] saved and he that believeth not shall be
[1:28:29] damned and these signs shall follow
[1:28:31] follow the believers my soldiers in my
[1:28:33] name they shall cast out Devils speak
[1:28:36] with neutrons take up serpents or drink
[1:28:37] deadly things it wouldn't harm them if
[1:28:39] they lay their hands on the sick they
[1:28:41] shall recover onward Christian soldiers
[1:28:43] marching as to war with the cross of
[1:28:46] Jesus going on before I'm crucified with
[1:28:49] him nevertheless I live not me that
[1:28:51] lived but he that liveth in me the word
[1:28:53] going on before God cutting away with
[1:28:57] this sharp two-edged sword Church I
[1:29:00] encourage you put on the whole armor of
[1:29:02] God as you go into one more battle a man
[1:29:07] keep fighting we're gonna fight to the
[1:29:09] end
[1:29:09] after we leave here another battle some
[1:29:13] so y'all get out of church somebody
[1:29:14] gonna call you and got something to sing
[1:29:17] glory to God and sometime I find it so
[1:29:20] strange how people that don't even go to
[1:29:22] this church know everything that go on
[1:29:25] in the church that much do you watch the
[1:29:32] videos if so praise the Lord then one
[1:29:37] day something gonna strike revelation is
[1:29:40] striking and you come out of that thing
[1:29:41] one more battle Church keep pressing on
[1:29:44] let's bring father we thank you for your
[1:29:48] word and got just a few things here that
[1:29:51] we could glean from and how we just we
[1:29:55] realized that like that that finally
[1:29:58] finally it means there's no stopping no
[1:30:03] truce no no break it's all-out war from
[1:30:11] here from now until the time we leave
[1:30:14] this earth it's all-out war so since the
[1:30:17] devil is trying to defeat us we gotta be
[1:30:19] just as motivated to defeat him and God
[1:30:23] we got it sometimes take the battle
[1:30:24] right to them not running from them all
[1:30:26] the time but sometimes taking it right
[1:30:27] to them and realizing that even after we
[1:30:30] overcome he's coming back with something
[1:30:31] else so we'll overcome that too and will
[1:30:34] constantly be victorious that is what
[1:30:37] you called us to do and you didn't call
[1:30:39] us here to be on a picnic you called us
[1:30:42] to fight
[1:30:43] we're soldiers in the army of the Lord
[1:30:46] and as we look back in Scripture and see
[1:30:48] all those that have overcome then God we
[1:30:51] are also in the in that line and we
[1:30:54] shall overcome because you overcame we
[1:30:57] can't overcome our song help us to take
[1:30:59] the word use it it's the greatest weapon
[1:31:02] that you could give us Lord
[1:31:04] and I believe the trial Lord is the
[1:31:07] greatest greatest greatest gift that you
[1:31:09] could give us so help us Lord to welcome
[1:31:11] it and not to embrace it not to run from
