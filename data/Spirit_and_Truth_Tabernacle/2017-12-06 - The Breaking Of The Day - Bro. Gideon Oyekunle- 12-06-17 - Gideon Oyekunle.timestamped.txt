[19:09] parable a man and just began to talk
[19:12] about forgiveness and one person did
[19:15] this and they were forgiven and another
[19:16] person did that they were forgiven and I

[19:20] appreciate him to must come to find out
[19:23] the one that was forgiven the most
[19:25] appreciated it the most and see what you
[19:28] think about a song like that you think

[1:53:53] praise the Lord the breaking of day just
[1:54:00] appreciate brother Gideon and just
[1:54:05] breaking out just so much they're in for
[1:54:08] our souls to just feed on those
[1:54:12] testimonies there the end just just what
[1:54:14] a mighty God we serve
[1:54:16] what a mighty God we serve and we all
[1:54:22] got to leave here encouraged no matter
[1:54:24] how dark your night is it may you keep
[1:54:28] holding on because the day's about to
[1:54:31] break amen that day is about to break
[1:54:37] hallelujah I was just thinking that
[1:54:39] scripture the Bible say weep in me and
[1:54:41] do it for the night but joy comes in the
[1:54:44] morning a man let's give the Lord
[1:54:48] another hand of praise her
[1:54:49] [Music]
[1:54:51] but his his word I'm gonna do there
[1:54:59] shall be light in the evening time a man
[1:55:02] here in a second you know before you can
[1:55:06] actually have a morning you've got to go
[1:55:09] through an evening you gotta have a
[1:55:12] nighttime before you have a morning
[1:55:14] right and you know as he was just kind
[1:55:16] of sharing there just our calendar just
[1:55:20] got us all messed up young can don't
[1:55:22] gonna be seated just for a little bit
[1:55:23] but this the Roman calendar that we're
[1:55:26] we're under a man in the way that we
[1:55:28] start our days and things like that
[1:55:31] it just really got things just really
[1:55:33] messed up it's so messed up it would be
[1:55:35] hard for people even understand what
[1:55:37] truly happened at the resurrection right
[1:55:40] because we look at it from our Roman
[1:55:42] calendar system but you got to be able
[1:55:44] to look at it from the way that the
[1:55:46] Saints in I mean that the people in
[1:55:48] Israel when this when when the Sun Goes
[1:55:51] Down that's the beginning of a new day
[1:55:52] right and that's that's how they kind of
[1:55:55] it that's how they start things so you
[1:55:56] have to always look at it from from that
[1:55:59] perspective and you know and it just
[1:56:01] kind of helps you understand just just a
[1:56:04] little bit more of the scripture our
[1:56:06] Western approach sometimes hinders us
[1:56:09] I'm just be honest with you it really
[1:56:11] does hinder us but me just coming back
[1:56:15] from Israel I'm a witness of many of the
[1:56:18] things that he was just sharing there
[1:56:19] and I tell you whenever you get a chance
[1:56:21] just to kind of see it from a man that
[1:56:24] the eastern culture perspective the
[1:56:26] Bible becomes a new Bible to you and man
[1:56:28] there's things that you read and there
[1:56:30] was like wait a minute I'm missing that
[1:56:32] just just Genesis one how many you all
[1:56:38] caught that he would just be brought
[1:56:41] that out tonight just right there in
[1:56:43] Genesis 1 the statement was made I just
[1:56:47] want to read it again I don't I don't
[1:56:49] want to miss it but it said uh-uh
[1:56:53] [Music]
[1:56:55] what was that he was bringing out how it
[1:56:57] was dark first and then then it was no
[1:57:00] it's evening and the evening in the
[1:57:02] morning were the first day
[1:57:04] right the evening and the morning not
[1:57:06] the morning in the evening of the
[1:57:07] evening in the morning it just you know
[1:57:11] another little little secret
[1:57:13] that the way that the the the Israel
[1:57:16] Israelis they get married on most lot of
[1:57:19] them get married I think on Tuesdays
[1:57:21] I think it's Tuesday and and the reason
[1:57:25] like well you know cheering you know our
[1:57:28] culture we kind of get married on on
[1:57:31] Saturdays you know that that's that's
[1:57:33] the that's a good day to get married but
[1:57:36] they choose Tuesday and I saw the
[1:57:39] question was actual why do y'all choose
[1:57:40] Tuesday say when when you read your
[1:57:42] Bible the book of Genesis that was the
[1:57:44] only day God said it was good at twice
[1:57:47] so if God said it was good twice on that
[1:57:49] thing we're gonna get married on that
[1:57:50] day say what I mean you know just little
[1:57:54] things that that they do that just just
[1:57:56] just blow our culture away and they'll
[1:57:57] shut down stop working and do everything
[1:58:00] else because they're doing it God said
[1:58:02] it was good twice on that day so I'm
[1:58:04] gonna do things on that day and I tell
[1:58:05] you just it just really blesses your
[1:58:07] heart when you just see these little
[1:58:09] nuggets tear Scripture it just really
[1:58:11] upsets you you know just just moving in
[1:58:14] a different direction and I tell you
[1:58:15] what we're so grateful for the message
[1:58:17] of the hour amen because every last one
[1:58:20] of us in here was in darkness before the
[1:58:25] darkness rolled away when we heard God's
[1:58:28] voice through his prophets and now we
[1:58:31] see things that others just cannot see
[1:58:34] in Scripture and and I'm really so I'm
[1:58:37] so wrapped up and tied up in this
[1:58:39] message that uh you might as well just
[1:58:41] not talk to me about anything else cuz
[1:58:44] I'm not even looking at it
[1:58:45] not even entertaining it you know and
[1:58:48] even though you know as he was saying
[1:58:49] there is probably even as we go into
[1:58:51] 2018
[1:58:53] more and more darkness cell in front of
[1:58:55] people many are struggling a man in this
[1:58:58] hour but I have a promise telling the
[1:59:02] church on Sunday when that when the
[1:59:04] children Israel were leaving a man Egypt
[1:59:07] they told Pharaoh that they were not
[1:59:09] gonna even leave a cows hoof behind man
[1:59:13] if God was so concerned about a cows huh
[1:59:18] don't you think he's more concerned
[1:59:20] about your loved ones so no matter how
[1:59:24] much darkness they in there Shelby likes
[1:59:27] their shared me light I don't know how
[1:59:30] it's gonna happen but there shall be
[1:59:32] light and they will begin to walk in
[1:59:35] that light anybody believe that a man
[1:59:39] let's give a lot a hand of plays a man

[2:03:06] about the watchman and how he would sit
[2:03:09] on the tower
[2:03:10] she said higher than all the other
[2:03:13] people when he could see a lot more than
[2:03:16] what they could see and maybe through
[2:03:18] the night they would be so worried about
[2:03:20] what was what was happening but as we
[2:03:22] were told tonight just just for us just
[2:03:24] rest
[2:03:25] just sleep because the day is coming

[2:03:33] tremendous trials and tremendous tests
[2:03:35] and and God just wondering how are they
[2:03:38] gonna come through but help us work just
[2:03:39] to have faith in your words when you
[2:03:42] speak Lord things are transformed things
[2:03:45] have changed all it takes is one word
[2:03:48] from you
[2:03:50] and things will change so help us God
[2:03:53] just to maintain our faith and not look
[2:03:55] at father to darkness but look at the
[2:03:57] promise of light that's going to shine
[2:04:00] forth in the midst of that darkness we
