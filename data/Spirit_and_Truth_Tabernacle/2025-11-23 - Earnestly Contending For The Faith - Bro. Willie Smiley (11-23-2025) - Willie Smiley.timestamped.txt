[44:52] &gt;&gt; Brother Troy had it a little turned up
[44:54] in here.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; All right. I was in the back there and
[44:58] I'm like, "Well, let me go, you know,
[45:00] PEEP AND SEE WHAT GOING ON IN THERE."
[45:03] &gt;&gt; HEY, that's that's what it's all that's
[45:06] what it's all about. I tell you what,
[45:08] [snorts] you know, uh just being We
[45:11] going to be looking in the book of Jude
[45:13] and the book of Revelation is is just
[45:15] trying to be free in the spirit.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; We used to think we used to sing that
[45:20] song, free in the spirit of free.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; Ain't no change. Ain't no change this
[45:26] morning, is it?
[45:27] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes I'll be telling
[45:32] myself now, if I could act or sing the
[45:36] way that I feel it
[45:38] &gt;&gt; and hear it in the spirit,
[45:40] &gt;&gt; oh my God.
[45:42] &gt;&gt; Cuz I be feeling some stuff and I be
[45:45] hearing some stuff in the spirit, but it
[45:47] just won't come out these lips the same
[45:49] way. [laughter]
[45:52] But if I could get it all together, OH
[45:55] LORD have mercy.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. It be I be saying I said brother
[46:00] so just trying to bind me up where I
[46:02] just can't be free. Amen. The way that
[46:04] that I desire to be free.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; But let's remember the brothers this out
[46:10] brother Jack and the Quintons this
[46:14] morning. Let's start from the first
[46:16] verse of uh Jude chapter 1. Uh it says
[46:21] Jude the servant of Jesus Christ uh
[46:24] brother of James to them that are
[46:28] sanctified by God the Father and
[46:30] preserved in Jesus Christ and called
[46:33] mercy unto you and peace and love be
[46:38] multiplied.
[46:39] Beloved, when I gave all diligence to
[46:42] write unto you of the common salvation,
[46:46] it was needful for me to write unto you
[46:49] and to exhort you that ye should
[46:51] earnestly contend for the faith which
[46:53] was once delivered unto the saints. For
[46:58] there are certain men crept in unawares
[47:00] who were uh before of old ordained to
[47:04] this condemnation, ungodly men turning
[47:07] the grace of God into luxiousness and
[47:12] denying the only Lord God and our Lord
[47:15] Jesus Christ. Now let us uh also look at
[47:19] revelations
[47:21] uh chapter 2.
[47:24] And uh we want to start at
[47:27] the first verse. It says uh unto the
[47:31] angel of the church of Ephesus, write
[47:33] these things, say he that holdeth the
[47:35] seven stars in his right hand, who
[47:38] walketh in the midst of the seven golden
[47:39] candlesticks. I know thy works, and thy
[47:42] labor, and thy patience, and how thou uh
[47:45] can not bear them which are evil, and
[47:48] has tried them which say that they are
[47:50] apostles, and are not, and has found
[47:52] them liars, and has borne, and has
[47:55] patient for my name's sake, has labored,
[47:58] and has not fainted. Nevertheless, I
[48:01] have somewhat against thee, because thou
[48:04] has left thy first love. Remember
[48:08] uh therefore from whence thou art fallen
[48:11] and repent and do the first work or else
[48:13] I will come unto thee quickly and I will
[48:15] remove the candlestick out of his place
[48:18] except thou repent. Let's bow our heads
[48:21] for a word of prayer. Gracious father,
[48:23] we just thank you and we praise you, oh
[48:25] God, this morning for uh your grace and
[48:28] your mercies and how you've uh blessed
[48:31] us thus far in the service. Lord, we
[48:35] just want to remove the human part to
[48:37] one side that the Holy Spirit can take
[48:40] control. And uh Lord, bless uh the
[48:44] brethren, Lord, uh up with Tim Puit this
[48:47] morning, brother Tim Puit this morning.
[48:49] And uh just get them traveling mercies
[48:51] also uh when they prepare to come back.
[48:54] We just thank you. We praise you. Uh
[48:56] restore brother Troy and his strength
[48:59] this morning. We thank you for all
[49:00] things in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. May be
[49:03] seated there. Um we like to use as a
[49:07] topic this morning um earnestly
[49:10] contending for the faith and as a
[49:13] subtopic we want to um use the complaint
[49:17] of God. I'm going kind of squeeze two
[49:20] messages. I don't know how much time I
[49:22] got this morning but uh uh we we going
[49:26] to do the best that we can uh by God's
[49:29] grace. Um when we look at the book of
[49:32] Jude, um one of the things we find is
[49:36] that uh Jude is trying to
[49:41] encourage the the
[49:43] uh the church
[49:45] to uh contend for the faith. And you
[49:50] know, in in one of those contending for
[49:52] the faith messages, Brother Brandham, he
[49:55] says it it means that you kind of got to
[49:58] wrestle. you you gota you gotta fight.
[50:01] You got to do everything that you
[50:03] possibly can to uh uh you know stay with
[50:09] what was initially given. And you know
[50:12] as I was riding to church this morning,
[50:14] I'm I'm constantly my wheels is always
[50:17] turning. Uh a couple of um words just
[50:21] kind of popped out. Uh sustainable and
[50:25] maintaining. And you know, one of the
[50:28] things that that you know, we find in
[50:30] looking at the scriptures,
[50:33] it's a real and not just in the
[50:35] scripture because there's there's
[50:37] parallels. There's a natural and there's
[50:40] a spiritual. Is that right? And and we
[50:42] we we just always got to keep it keep
[50:45] those things in mind like we were saying
[50:48] um uh the last couple of weeks ago when
[50:50] we preached uh you know our our our
[50:54] minds has got to be transformed. I I
[50:57] know we we're we're we're you know we're
[51:00] living a a natural life but there's a a
[51:04] spiritual
[51:05] element that goes along with our our
[51:08] natural life. And one of the things
[51:10] that, you know, for me that I always
[51:13] have to consider, I don't do everything
[51:15] right,
[51:17] but it's a battle.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; It's it's a struggle. Y'all ought to say
[51:21] amen to me this morning.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; Uh uh it it's it's a real battle. It's a
[51:27] struggle to uh maintain,
[51:32] right? or or substain
[51:38] uh which which means maintaining
[51:40] sustainable means maintaining
[51:43] uh the the capacity to maintain AND AND
[51:48] YOU MIGHT YOU MIGHT THINK to maintain
[51:50] something or keep something in order is
[51:53] is an easy task.
[51:57] It's not. If you if you got a house with
[52:00] children
[52:02] running around in it, no matter how you
[52:04] try to keep it all nice and and and and
[52:08] everything in order, that's difficult
[52:13] &gt;&gt; and and it can be frustrating
[52:16] &gt;&gt; trying to maintain some sort of, you
[52:19] know, order or some sort of, you know,
[52:23] condition, right? And and the same thing
[52:26] is in the spirit,
[52:28] &gt;&gt; right? Just trying to maintain
[52:33] &gt;&gt; biblical integrity.
[52:35] It's not easy.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; You say, "Why is it NOT SO EASY?"
[52:41] BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY VOICES.
[52:44] Especially now, we got access to so many
[52:48] things that we didn't have ACCESS TO
[52:52] WHEN I GOT CONVERTED CUZ WE DIDN'T WE
[52:54] DIDN'T have phones the way that we got
[52:56] them. WE DIDN'T HAVE LAPTOPS. WE DIDN'T
[52:58] HAVE, YOU KNOW, all of the the the
[53:00] podcasts and and we WE JUST DIDN'T HAVE
[53:04] ALL THAT. We might have just had, you
[53:06] know, um the books and the tapes in our
[53:09] local ministry.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; And and some people, you know, maybe put
[53:15] out tapes, but you wasn't always privy
[53:18] to a lot of that. So, we we didn't have
[53:21] all of this this information to grapple
[53:25] with. Is that right?
[53:27] &gt;&gt; That's right. Uh it it was more easier
[53:29] for us to to hear our shepherds
[53:33] &gt;&gt; and and not try to, you know, UH UH
[53:36] WELL, BROTHER SO AND SO said that
[53:38] BECAUSE NOW WE GOT SO MUCH access
[53:42] &gt;&gt; and THERE'S THERE'S SO MANY THERE'S SO
[53:44] MANY voices
[53:45] &gt;&gt; and and we kind of pitting one voice
[53:48] against another voice.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; IS THAT RIGHT? SO, SO SOMETIMES IT IT
[53:53] MAKES IT A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT FOR
[53:57] for the local shepherd to to
[54:01] uh uh keep us in with one MIND AND ONE
[54:06] ACCORD.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[54:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; And because you know we we we listen to
[54:12] we listen to you know and AND WHO AM I
[54:16] TO SAY WHAT YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO? But
[54:18] I'm just throwing this out there because
[54:20] I don't think everybody spiritual enough
[54:23] &gt;&gt; to listen to everybody out there.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; And and even WHEN THEIR MESSAGE
[54:28] PREACHES, I STILL DON'T THINK THAT
[54:30] EVERYBODY'S SPIRITUAL ENOUGH
[54:33] &gt;&gt; OR SOUND ENOUGH IN DOCTRINE to listen to
[54:37] everybody,
[54:39] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? BECAUSE BECAUSE EVERYBODY'S NOT
[54:41] ON THE WORD,
[54:43] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? because they say that they're
[54:44] preaching, you know, uh, God sent a
[54:48] prophet, but it's like God sent a
[54:50] prophet and what else?
[54:53] &gt;&gt; Come on, y'all preach with me, church.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; Don't work me too hard.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; Uh,
[54:59] &gt;&gt; right.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; And and so I I think it's it's it's a
[55:03] very difficult job for the ministry
[55:07] just trying to set uh boundaries,
[55:12] &gt;&gt; right? set set boundaries. Uh lay lay a
[55:16] platform
[55:17] for us to build upon,
[55:20] &gt;&gt; right? BECAUSE LISTEN, CHURCH, we we we
[55:23] we LIVING A NATURAL LIFE AND WE'RE
[55:25] LIVING A SPIRITUAL life and and YOU
[55:28] KNOW, WE GOT TO BE SOUND.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. AND AND AND EVERYTHING
[55:33] HAS GOT TO BE COMING THROUGH A THINKING
[55:34] MAN'S FILTER.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; Is that right? BEC BECAUSE IF IF WE
[55:40] START THE FILTERING I'M GOING SOMEWHERE
[55:42] but I I just kind of got to preach my
[55:44] inspiration first.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; Right. WE WE WE WE GOT TO BE FILTERING
[55:50] YOU KNOW OUR LIFE THROUGH A THINKING
[55:52] MAN'S FILTER.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Glory to God.
[55:57] BECAUSE IF NOT IT SHOWS WHAT kind of
[56:00] tastes we have.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. See, WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE I'M
[56:07] NOT SAYING THIS TO BE NEGATIVE, BUT I'M
[56:09] saying this to be positive be because WE
[56:12] GOT A WHOLE YOUNG GENERATION THAT'S
[56:15] GROWING UP,
[56:17] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? Uh um and you you want them to
[56:22] have a foundation in which to build
[56:24] their lives upon.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; You want them to have a a foundation,
[56:30] you know, UH TO FILTER THEIR THOUGHTS
[56:34] THROUGH.
[56:36] IS THAT RIGHT? BE BECAUSE IF IF IT'S NOT
[56:39] ONE OF THE THINGS WE DON'T WANT AS
[56:41] CHRISTIANS.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; NOW, I can't speak for the world, but
[56:45] the world do whatever they want to do.
[56:47] But I'm talking about being we're
[56:48] Christians. Is that right?
[56:50] &gt;&gt; We I'm not here to discharianize or tell
[56:52] nobody who's a Christian and who not a
[56:54] Christian. You ain't no Christian. Well,
[56:57] that's not my job. My job is to uh uh uh
[57:02] you know bring us to to to this place
[57:05] you know right of stability according to
[57:08] Paul in the book of Ephesians. Yes sir.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; But we we want we we want you know for
[57:15] for the younger generation and all of us
[57:17] to be able to filter you know our
[57:20] thoughts and our actions through the
[57:22] word.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; Is that right? THAT'S THE ONLY WAY that
[57:25] we're gonna be successful as
[57:27] individuals. Is that right?
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because one of the things you know
[57:32] you you find is if not it's it's the
[57:36] flesh should be the thing that's
[57:38] dragging you.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[57:41] &gt;&gt; And and we don't want to be dragged. We
[57:44] want to be led by the spirit of God. Is
[57:47] that right?
[57:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So, so Jude is trying to
[57:52] uh in the best way possible TO ENCOURAGE
[57:56] THE CHURCH.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[58:00] &gt;&gt; TO LOOK TAKE TAKE A TAKE A stand for uh
[58:05] the word of God. Is that right?
[58:08] the the prophet in in earnestly
[58:10] contending for the faith
[58:13] um
[58:15] 1956419
[58:18] he says what a solemn scripture we got
[58:21] here under consideration
[58:24] no doubt setting in here is is clergymen
[58:29] from different phases of faith supposed
[58:32] to be one Lord one faith and one baptism
[58:35] because that's that's that's what it
[58:37] started out with. Is that right?
[58:40] &gt;&gt; But then look at look at look at what we
[58:42] got now.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; He says, "Usually an evangelist stir
[58:48] causes many to come." And I'm speaking
[58:51] to many brethren and at first I want to
[58:55] say to to you, I represent this church.
[58:59] He says, "If if you're Methodist,
[59:01] Baptist, Pentecostal,
[59:03] Nazarene, Pilgrim, Holy, whatever you
[59:06] may be, I represent this church for,"
[59:09] watch this, for we preach Christ and him
[59:13] crucified. That's what we believe.
[59:16] Is that right?
[59:18] &gt;&gt; So you you say he he's making, you know,
[59:22] it it seems simple, but it's a profound
[59:24] uh statement. Is that right? TO LET YOU
[59:29] TO LET US know you KNOW WHAT A PART OF
[59:33] WHAT WE stand for and and what we're
[59:36] doing. WE WE DON'T WE CANNOT JUST BE
[59:39] RANDOM,
[59:42] [snorts]
[59:43] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? WE JUST CAN'T BE RANDOM. OUR
[59:45] APPROACH JUST can't be be random.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; We've been random LONG ENOUGH. WE GOT WE
[59:52] GOT TO BE INTENTIONAL. THIS IS A word
[59:54] that brother Jack has used, RIGHT? WE WE
[59:56] GOT TO BE INTENTIONAL.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. In in our approach to things, we
[1:00:01] we we got to kind of know
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; know and understand when we're growing,
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; right? Amen. We we give we give room for
[1:00:10] for growth,
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; right? But you know, when when I'm by
[1:00:15] myself and I'm thinking about things and
[1:00:17] I'm thinking about the next generation,
[1:00:20] you know, you for me, THIS IS ME. THIS
[1:00:23] IS my mindset, you know. uh is that you
[1:00:26] you you want them to be uh uh different
[1:00:32] than what you were.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; YOU YOU HOPEFULLY YOU DON'T WANT THEM TO
[1:00:36] GO THROUGH THE kind of struggles that
[1:00:38] you you've gone through be because of of
[1:00:42] uh like brother Brandham say in marriage
[1:00:44] and divorce uh uh backslitting
[1:00:47] preachers,
[1:00:49] [laughter]
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; right? Glory to God. And he even talking
[1:00:52] about imagine divorce drunken
[1:00:54] magistrate. But see, you you you you
[1:00:58] want you want, you know, I was I was
[1:01:01] listening to uh something this week and
[1:01:05] and the guy was just talking about um
[1:01:08] his his father and different things and
[1:01:10] he says, "You know what? Your father is
[1:01:13] the only man, but I I'll put myself in
[1:01:16] here too with you. Is the only man that
[1:01:19] really wants you to to do better
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; than what he did. Is that right? Your
[1:01:25] father
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; wants maybe not no other man, you know,
[1:01:30] may not want you to do better than them,
[1:01:32] especially in the natural, but it's it's
[1:01:35] SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR FATHER AND AND JUST
[1:01:39] and and and growing for a younger
[1:01:42] generation of young men,
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; right? You you want for THEM TO BE
[1:01:48] BETTER. YOU you you want for these YOUNG
[1:01:51] GUYS TO BE BETTER THAN THEIR FATHERS.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. TO GO FURTHER THAN THEIR FATHERS.
[1:01:58] Is that right?
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Young sisters, you know, uh you want
[1:02:03] them to uh and that's a that's a fine
[1:02:08] line in there cuz we so far away from
[1:02:11] scripture,
[1:02:13] right?
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Because everybody's kind of out of
[1:02:17] place. Yeah.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; Come on, y'all quiet this morning
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; cuz cuz how many still believe a
[1:02:24] prophet's message
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; and and now we can't change things. But
[1:02:30] he said, you know, and it's biblical
[1:02:33] that that when you get out of the
[1:02:35] kitchen, you kind of got out your place,
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; BUT THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; AND AND I THINK I THINK HE had
[1:02:45] understanding.
[1:02:47] I mean, we we know with inflation and
[1:02:50] everything, it it's a things has gotten
[1:02:53] to be a little bit different and and the
[1:02:56] influence of the pits of hell,
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; right? Come on, church.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; To to uh uh steal, kill, and destroy,
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; right? It it's IT'S SO MANY IT'S SO MANY
[1:03:10] factors
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; at play,
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; right? cuz you know we just kind of
[1:03:16] going along and we're we're not
[1:03:18] sometimes considering IT'S SO MANY
[1:03:21] THINGS at at work against us,
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; right? Uh we know that so many demons
[1:03:29] has been loosed.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; TURN TURNED LOOSED IN THIS AGE. RIGHT.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; We we could WE COULD SEE RIGHT FROM
[1:03:37] GENESIS WHAT WAS TURNED loose against A
[1:03:40] A PERFECT FAMILY.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. A PERFECT CONNECTION. BUT WHAT
[1:03:46] WAS TURNED loose and see SATAN'S ALWAYS
[1:03:51] MAINTAIN AND BROTHER BRANDON SAY he done
[1:03:53] fulfilled it.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; To be above,
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; right? Come on, church.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; TO TO TO BE ABOVE THE STARS OF GOD.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. AND HE SAYS THE PROPHET SAYS THAT
[1:04:09] HE'S DONE DONE IT.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. AMEN.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; HOW HOW DID HE DO IT? BY GETTING THE
[1:04:15] PEOPLE AWAY from real true biblical
[1:04:19] principle,
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? GLORY TO GOD. THAT'S THAT'S HOW
[1:04:23] HE'S DONE IT. HE'S ALWAYS WORKED, AMEN.
[1:04:27] from a religious standpoint and trying
[1:04:30] to get the people away from the WORD OF
[1:04:33] GOD.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; CUZ IF HE GET YOU FROM THE WORD OF GOD,
[1:04:37] HE GOT YOU.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. I mean, WE WE COULD FOLLOW IT
[1:04:42] RIGHT DOWN THROUGH SCRIPTURE DURING THE
[1:04:44] DAYS of Balum and Bailac, right?
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. See,
[1:04:51] THE DEVIL KNOWS
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; THERE'S A REACTION THAT GOD AMEN. HAS
[1:04:57] WHEN HE SEES the true church GETTING
[1:05:00] AWAY FROM THE WORD.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. THAT THERE'S A AND THIS IS
[1:05:07] why our inspiration is the complaint of
[1:05:10] God. You know, we ain't got to it yet,
[1:05:13] but he he says, you know, BOY, I GOT I
[1:05:15] KNOW Y'ALL DONE DID ALL OF THIS. Y'all
[1:05:16] done did all that. Boy, I got something
[1:05:18] against y'all, though.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:05:23] SEE, BALAM [screaming] BALAM GOT THE
[1:05:25] CHURCH TO DO SOMETHING CONTRARY TO THE
[1:05:29] WORD OF GOD, AND IT UPSET GOD.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT, BROTHER. AND AND AND THE
[1:05:35] PROPHET MAKES A STATEMENT. HE SAID,
[1:05:36] "BOY, GOD, HEY, GOD ain't forgave him
[1:05:38] for that one, right?" GLORY TO GOD. SO,
[1:05:42] SEE, SO SEE HOW
[1:05:46] AND THIS IS IMPORTANT, CHURCH, RIGHT?
[1:05:49] IT'S JUST NOT ENOUGH. WELL, I'M A
[1:05:50] CHRISTIAN. THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S A
[1:05:52] STARTING POINT. BUT, BUT WE'RE TRYING TO
[1:05:55] LIVE CHRISTIAN LIVES and build Christian
[1:05:58] families. And you know, uh,
[1:06:03] YOU GOT TO GO A LITTLE BIT FURTHER THAN
[1:06:05] THAT, RIGHT?
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; IT IT REALLY KIND OF BOILS DOWN TO, UH,
[1:06:10] our understanding
[1:06:12] of of WHAT GOD
[1:06:16] LIKES AND WHAT GOD DOES NOT LIKE.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? AMEN.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; And see just I guess for for me and I'm
[1:06:25] quite sure brother Jack also is is is
[1:06:30] you know we're NOT JUST RANDOM. WE'RE
[1:06:32] WE'RE trying to get us to maintain some
[1:06:36] sense of uh standard.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; I I'm going tell you church, the church
[1:06:42] ain't like it used to be now.
[1:06:46] things things is not like they used to
[1:06:48] be.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; When I got converted in 1988, things
[1:06:53] have changed.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; The the mindset and and things of that
[1:07:00] nature of people have changed. The the
[1:07:03] things that people once used to do and
[1:07:06] the places that people once would not
[1:07:09] go, WE GOING
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; AND WE'RE DOING. NOW, I'M GONNA get to
[1:07:13] that in the message right this morning.
[1:07:15] If I get that far, I already know what's
[1:07:18] on there, so I could preach it from
[1:07:19] within here.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; But I'm gonna read y'all some some
[1:07:22] quotes this morning,
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; right? Glory to God.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; Uh the prophet says, "And and if we
[1:07:31] could only find out what kind of faith
[1:07:33] they had, right? If we could only find
[1:07:37] out, you know, if they were the uh
[1:07:40] Presbyterians, Baptist, Methodists,
[1:07:42] Luther, Catholic, whatever it was, then
[1:07:46] we could contend for that.
[1:07:50] See,
[1:07:52] I [screaming] fight for what I
[1:07:53] understand.
[1:07:55] And I MIGHT BE MISUNDERSTOOD,
[1:07:57] BUT I DON'T CARE
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT I UNDERSTAND. AND I
[1:08:03] KNOW WHEN I STEP UP HERE, I AIN'T
[1:08:04] PREACHING YOU NO false doctrine,
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; IT IT MIGHT BE AGAINST OUR human
[1:08:11] reasoning,
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; right? But we COULD WE COULD HAVE
[1:08:16] DIALOGUE.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; ANYTIME I FINISH PREACHING, WE COULD
[1:08:20] TALK ABOUT IT IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU
[1:08:22] DON'T understand or something you don't
[1:08:23] believe,
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; right? But you know,
[1:08:28] I COULD SUPPORT IT BY THE SCRIPTURE and
[1:08:31] and the message,
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; right? AND THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. See, we we could kind of
[1:08:42] see the same spirit at work as it's
[1:08:45] always worked down through the history
[1:08:47] of scripture. Look, look at the degree
[1:08:49] of difficulty that the prophet of God
[1:08:51] had and trying to get us to see where
[1:08:55] the church has fallen
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; and where is right.
[1:09:03] Glory
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; y'all. All right, y'all still with me?
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; See, he says, um, so then the only way
[1:09:10] that you can do it is to go back and
[1:09:14] find out what it was. This this is the
[1:09:17] thing. This was brother Brandham's
[1:09:19] ministry,
[1:09:21] right? Fighting to take us back to what
[1:09:24] was, to show us what was. BECAUSE HE
[1:09:28] REALIZED WHAT WHAT what it was during
[1:09:31] this time when he came on the scene, it
[1:09:33] wasn't what was.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; You you you could see how the church had
[1:09:41] drifted, right?
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; And see, IT'S A BATTLE CONSTANTLY to
[1:09:48] keep us from drifting,
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; right? BECAUSE BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T SAY
[1:09:53] CERTAIN THINGS, RIGHT, uh the church
[1:09:57] will drift,
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; glory to God,
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; BY HUMAN NATURE AND THROUGH THROUGH THE
[1:10:05] MANY BATTLES THAT WE GO THROUGH.
[1:10:09] G glory to God. WE WE'LL FIND
[1:10:12] OURSSELFVES leaning to our own
[1:10:14] understanding
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; and and our own human reasoning which is
[1:10:19] a uh do will do a disservice to us.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; WHAT LOOK AT EVE. LOOK AT ALL OF WHAT
[1:10:28] SHE HAD. BUT IT WAS her human reasoning
[1:10:31] and her lust and things of that nature.
[1:10:34] She stopped when she shouldn't have
[1:10:36] stopped the reason. And look what it
[1:10:39] did,
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. It's it's the same spirit
[1:10:46] at work,
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; right? Trying to get us to the to Well,
[1:10:51] it don't mean that.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; It It don't It's You know, that was the
[1:10:58] reason why God set us sent us a prophet
[1:11:01] so that we would know.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; Because we definitely did not know.
[1:11:07] Amen.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; APART FROM A PROPHET, I DIDN'T KNOW. I I
[1:11:12] DIDN'T KNOW where to stand as as a
[1:11:15] Christian. I I got kind of converted,
[1:11:18] had my first experience in Pentecost and
[1:11:21] and
[1:11:23] I didn't last long because I I just just
[1:11:25] didn't have nothing to stand on,
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; right? I had an experience, but I didn't
[1:11:31] have no word. I had I had no basis,
[1:11:35] right? CUZ BECAUSE FAITH HAS GOT TO HAVE
[1:11:38] A PLACE to rest itself.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; It can't be just shifting sands of some
[1:11:47] theology of man's wisdom. That won't
[1:11:50] work.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; That won't work. Our feelings and our
[1:11:54] opinions, we get into trouble with that.
[1:11:57] You know, you know, uh, in the scripture
[1:12:00] it talks about there was a time when the
[1:12:03] people didn't have A PROPHET AND THEY
[1:12:05] DID WHAT WAS convenient in their own
[1:12:08] sight,
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; IT'S WHAT THEY COULD FIGURE OUT,
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? You know WHAT WE COULD REASON
[1:12:16] THAT DON'T WORK FOR CHRISTIANS
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE'RE PREACHING FROM AN OPEN
[1:12:21] BOOK. THE MIGHTY ANGEL DESCENDED
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; TO GIVE US CLARITY.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. AMEN.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. Let me keep going. Boy, my time
[1:12:29] going to get get gone.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. Um,
[1:12:36] so he says, "SO THAT ONLY JUST WAY TO do
[1:12:39] it is to go back and find out what it
[1:12:41] was that gets every man and asks every
[1:12:45] man a chance and gives God a chance.
[1:12:48] Give me a chance tonight to defend what
[1:12:51] I'm standing for by the scriptures."
[1:12:55] Right? And you do. You got to you got to
[1:12:57] defend what you standing for by the
[1:13:00] scriptures. IS THAT RIGHT?
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; FOR I TRULY believe that any doctrine
[1:13:04] that is not based upon the Bible is a
[1:13:08] heretic. It's not right. It must come
[1:13:12] from this Bible. Not from uh one
[1:13:16] scripture but from every scripture
[1:13:18] completely through the Bible or it's not
[1:13:21] right.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; God doesn't make mistakes. He's infinite
[1:13:26] and he cannot make mistakes. He's
[1:13:29] infallible,
[1:13:31] omnipotent, omnipresent, omnipotent. He
[1:13:34] cannot make mistakes and he does not
[1:13:38] write one thing in one time and
[1:13:41] something to contradict it over here.
[1:13:44] There's no place in the scripture. He
[1:13:47] can't do that. God don't operate like
[1:13:49] that.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Is that right? He he he does not um
[1:13:54] operate that way. Right. It's it's it's
[1:13:57] it's got to be uh one scripture on top
[1:14:01] of the other scripture.
[1:14:04] Is that right?
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Glory to his wonderful name. Y'all
[1:14:08] right.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; Y'all y'all a little quiet this morning.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; We ain't at no funeral.
[1:14:18] That's all right. And I just be messing
[1:14:20] with y'all about the quietness cuz I'mma
[1:14:22] preach anyway.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; Don't really matter because he here now
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; and I don't need y'all help. I need his.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Y'ALL Y'ALL Y'ALL HELP make it a little
[1:14:35] easier.
[1:14:37] But uh he's here now.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; So that's that's that's the only thing
[1:14:42] you know that I be waiting on. But in in
[1:14:45] the church age, the Ephesians church
[1:14:47] age, uh page 68,
[1:14:51] uh the prophet, he says, "Here it is,
[1:14:55] uh here it is, an unchanging God with
[1:14:59] unchanging ways."
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; That's been the basis of of Brother
[1:15:05] Brandon's message, right?
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; He's God and he don't he don't change,
[1:15:10] right? Amen.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; See and and once we find these different
[1:15:14] things out uh you know THESE THINGS HAS
[1:15:18] GOT TO BE maintained
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; right we we just can't you know think uh
[1:15:26] God don't you know God God understands
[1:15:28] why he does a certain things and
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; he wanted to remain the same
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; right
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; not not not changing
[1:15:39] you know Well, you know, that was for
[1:15:42] that day. You hear all kinds of stuff,
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; you know, uh they try to make standards
[1:15:47] traditional now.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; The the theologians, we we they make
[1:15:53] standards traditional. That's what they
[1:15:55] taught in the day is gone by.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; You know, it's like, BUT WHAT ABOUT GOD?
[1:16:01] RIGHT.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; And I think I I'll say this too. The
[1:16:06] people back then with the standards were
[1:16:09] kind of better off than the folks are
[1:16:11] now.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Come on now. Be because
[1:16:16] because you know when they broke the
[1:16:19] standards, the devil came in
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; and took THE THING OVER. AND NOW LOOK
[1:16:24] WHAT WE GOT.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; LOOK, LOOK WHAT WE GOT. YOU CAN'T HARDLY
[1:16:29] TELL. IS THIS CHURCH? Is this the club?
[1:16:32] Is this the the this and this?
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And and see, we're
[1:16:39] starting to, you know, trade the word
[1:16:43] for
[1:16:44] enthusiasm
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; in the church, right? And I watch
[1:16:49] things, right? It just kind of goes
[1:16:52] along with who I am um as as a servant
[1:16:56] of God. I watch things and I watch
[1:16:59] trends and you KNOW YOU START WATCHING
[1:17:02] THE THING NOW THE BIG THING now if you
[1:17:04] you look at most churches is that jump
[1:17:07] thing
[1:17:09] everybody and I I ain't got the energy
[1:17:11] in these legs to do all that
[1:17:13] y'all would be getting me off THE FLOOR
[1:17:16] BUT EVERYBODY
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; AND THIS THE big thing
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; YOU I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU WHAT CHURCH
[1:17:22] YOU LOOK AT ONLINE THAT'S THE BIG THING
[1:17:25] NOW
[1:17:28] IT'S A WHOLE LOT of
[1:17:33] and very little word.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Don't talk to me.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; See, I be like, "Oh, I see the a little
[1:17:45] pattern now. A little trend of the day.
[1:17:48] Everybody want to be bouncing and
[1:17:49] jumping and this, that, and the other."
[1:17:52] And then
[1:17:54] you listen to the words, you like, "Oh,
[1:17:59] oh,
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; right. Let me leave that alone."
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; WHICH I ENJOY JUMPING AND SHOUTING AND
[1:18:08] THIS AND THAT AND THE OTHER, BUT YOU
[1:18:09] GOING TO HAVE TO STILL GIVE ME THE WORD
[1:18:11] AFTER ALL OF THAT.
[1:18:13] BODILY EXERCISE DOES [screaming] PROFIT,
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; but I'm benefited more
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; BY BY WHAT YOU SAY FROM THE PULL PIT.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; SEE, it's hard for me to jump an hour
[1:18:27] and get a 30 minute sermon. That
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; less than them 30 MINUTES IS POWER PACK.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Leave me leave cuz I Yeah, some brothers
[1:18:38] can leave you in 30 minutes. She be
[1:18:39] like, "Grad,
[1:18:41] woo."
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; Feel like a wrestler. Woo!
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; But watch. He said, "Here it is." Now,
[1:18:53] now y'all keep your spiritual thinking
[1:18:55] caps on.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; He said, "Here it is. An unchanging God
[1:19:01] with unchanging ways."
[1:19:04] WHAT he did at the first,
[1:19:07] right?
[1:19:09] He will have to keep on doing it until
[1:19:13] it's done for the last time.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; See, WE WE'RE WE'RE GROWING IN CHURCH,
[1:19:19] RIGHT?
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; Just say we're we're new we're new
[1:19:23] converts,
[1:19:24] right? and and we're trying to
[1:19:26] understand, you know, the faith and what
[1:19:31] we're contending for,
[1:19:33] THEN WE GOT TO FIND OUT WHAT GOD
[1:19:37] [screaming] STARTED THE THING OFF WITH
[1:19:40] in the beginning,
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; right? YOU GOT TO HAVE A YOU YOU KNOW,
[1:19:45] CUZ IF Y'ALL ANYTHING LIKE ME, UH WHEN I
[1:19:48] FIRST GOT CONVERTED, I DIDN'T KNOW
[1:19:50] NOTHING. I HAD A BIBLE, BUT I DIDN'T
[1:19:52] KNOW ANYTHING. I didn't know who Abraham
[1:19:55] was. I didn't know where you didn't know
[1:19:58] nothing.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; You know, I I didn't have a place to
[1:20:05] rest my faith,
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; right? BUT THEN BUT NOW, YOU KNOW, he
[1:20:11] say changing God with unchanging words
[1:20:14] and what he did. THEN YOU GOT TO FIND
[1:20:17] OUT WHAT HE DID THE FIR AT THE FIRST
[1:20:19] TIME. SEE, AND THAT'S WHY YOU ALWAYS GOT
[1:20:22] TO POINT THE PEOPLE BACK TO THE BOOK OF
[1:20:24] ACTS.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; Right. You you always got to go back to
[1:20:29] the book of Acts because that's where
[1:20:33] you find God's first and perfect acts
[1:20:36] at. Is that right?
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. BE BECAUSE OUTSIDE OF
[1:20:40] THAT, YOU KNOW, YOU you kind of be
[1:20:43] wishywashy
[1:20:44] like a tree,
[1:20:47] you know. Glory to God. But we we wanted
[1:20:51] to be we want we want for folks to be
[1:20:53] rooted and grounded
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; because we want our WE WANT OUR BAPTISM.
[1:20:58] RIGHT.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. BUT THAT THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT. IT
[1:21:02] IS IMPORTANT.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; It is important because THERE WAS A
[1:21:06] GROUP THAT WAS BAPTIZED UNDER uh John's
[1:21:08] baptism,
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; right? [screaming] Didn't didn't HAVE
[1:21:12] THE HOLY GHOST. DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT
[1:21:14] THE HOLY Ghost was,
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; right? Amen.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; And and THEN THE APOSTLE PAUL CAME AND
[1:21:20] THE FIRST THING HE ASKED HIM, YOU KNOW,
[1:21:22] how was you baptized?
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; AND ONCE THEY TOLD JOHN, John commanded
[1:21:29] them to be rebaptized,
[1:21:32] NOT IN IN TITLES OF FATHER, SON, and
[1:21:34] holy ghost.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Right? That proves that a man does not
[1:21:39] understand scripture. If he take you
[1:21:41] down in titles of father, son, and holy
[1:21:44] ghost, he didn't get. Amen. Uh what
[1:21:50] Jesus was trying to relate, AMEN. TO HIS
[1:21:54] DISCIPLES,
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; THEY GOT IT.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; THEY GOT IT. CUZ IN THE BOOK OF ACTS
[1:22:00] CHAPTER 2, WHEN AFTER THE HOLY GHOST
[1:22:04] CAME ON on the 120 AND THEY BUST OUT OF
[1:22:08] THERE, YOU KNOW, NOW THEY WERE BOUNCING,
[1:22:11] BUT THEY HAD SOMETHING TO BOUNCE
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; you know, the manifestation of the
[1:22:16] SCRIPTURE CUZ CUZ THE PEOPLE AROUND SAY,
[1:22:19] "OH MAN, THESE PEOPLE DRUNK." AND PEOPLE
[1:22:22] SAY, "WELL, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.
[1:22:24] WE ARE DRUNK, [screaming] BUT NOT LIKE
[1:22:25] Y'ALL SUPPOSED.
[1:22:28] WE WE ARE FEELING GOOD
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; BUT NOT LIKE Y'ALL THINK.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. BUT THIS IS THAT
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS [screaming] SPOKEN.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; SEE, THIS WAS THE MANIFESTATION OF WAS
[1:22:42] SPOKEN BY JOEL.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE FULFILLMENT OF BIBLE
[1:22:47] PROPHECY.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; BOY, I tell you what, THEY STIRRED THEM
[1:22:51] FOLK UP. RIGHT.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; I COULD IMAGINE, BUDDY, the the 120 with
[1:22:56] Peter with no microphone probably stood
[1:23:00] up on something and got to breaking
[1:23:02] bread. I COULD IMAGINE THEM PREACH PETER
[1:23:06] PREACH DAY.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; SEE, THAT'S HOW WE USED TO HAVE CHURCH.
[1:23:11] WE AIN'T HAVE STAND CONTESTES. AND Y'ALL
[1:23:13] KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. IF Y'ALL
[1:23:15] WAS IN THE THUNDERS,

[1:23:19] YOU ALL THESE NO PRAISE DEMONS UP IN
[1:23:22] HERE. NOW, WE DON'T DO THAT. WE DON'T DO
[1:23:25] THAT HERE. BUT BOY, BROTHER COIN, AND IF
[1:23:27] YOU WASN'T PRAISING GOD, YOU FEEL LIKE
[1:23:30] HE TALKING TO YOU.

[1:23:33] PRAISE SPIRIT ON YOU.

[1:23:42] PEOPLE THAT COME TO CAUSE SOMETHING TO
[1:23:44] HAPPEN, THEY WAS ON THEIR FEET
[1:23:47] [screaming]
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; PUMPING AND PULLING, TELLING THE
[1:23:49] PREACHER TO PREACH.

[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; SOMETHING THAT ENCOURAGE YOU, SOMETHING
[1:30:21] THAT'LL ILLUMINATE YOU,
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; SOMETHING THAT'LL TRANSFORM YOUR MIND,
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:30:30] You know, uh, they sang the song, he did
[1:30:34] it for my good.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; Sometime in the flesh, you be like, boy,
[1:30:37] I don't know what good that
[1:30:42] this don't seem good. It don't feel
[1:30:44] good. Glory to God.
[1:30:49] But you realize something's good is
[1:30:51] coming. Something's good is coming out
[1:30:54] of this.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; You're gonna COME OUT OF A BETTER
[1:30:57] PERSON. You know, hey, YOU I'M GOING
[1:31:00] TELL YOU SOMETHING. In the last few
[1:31:03] years, man, I I think different,
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; right? I process different. I think
[1:31:10] different. Um
[1:31:13] I, you know, there was a time I would
[1:31:16] let people do certain things to me. I
[1:31:18] won't let you do that to me now.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; I'll be ready to have a conversation.
[1:31:23] and let's let's talk about this thing
[1:31:26] because uh you know certain things I
[1:31:28] realize it's not who I am and I and I
[1:31:31] can't be defined by you know you can't
[1:31:35] define one another by by periods of
[1:31:38] growth [snorts]
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; right
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; because because IF WE REALLY SAT DOWN we
[1:31:47] we we AND TALKED WITH FOLKS folks have
[1:31:50] realized that they ain't really where
[1:31:52] THEY THINK THEY THEY ARE.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; WE ALL GOT ROOM TO GROW. And even EVEN
[1:31:57] EVEN SOLOMON SOLOMON WAS TRYING TO TEACH
[1:32:01] his sons
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; about information if I'm just
[1:32:05] paraphrasing,
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; right? AND AND THE IMPORTANCE OF OF GOOD
[1:32:10] INFORMATION.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; I just said something
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THERE'S BAD INFORMATION
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; AND THERE'S GOOD INFORMATION. AND IF YOU
[1:32:21] GIVING ME INFORMATION,
[1:32:23] I gotta be able to take it through a
[1:32:25] thinking man's filter.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; Because if it won't work through the
[1:32:29] filter, it's bad information
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; AND IT'S GOT TO BE WEEDED OUT.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. SEE, I'M I'M IN THE ERA WHERE I'M
[1:32:36] NOT STOMACHING EVERYTHING,
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? HALLELUJAH.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; IF IF IF WE'RE HAVING A MATURE
[1:32:45] CONVERSATION,
[1:32:47] WE GOING TO FILTER IT RIGHT THROUGH A
[1:32:50] THINKING MAN'S FILTER.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; NOT REASONING, NOT EMOTIONS, BECAUSE WE
[1:32:56] AIN'T GOING NOWHERE. NEVER. YOU AIN'T
[1:32:58] NEVER GOING NOWHERE, CHURCH, in in THAT.
[1:33:00] IT'S IT'S GOT TO COME THROUGH. THAT'S
[1:33:03] WHY God gave us this.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE PROPHET SAID, YOU KNOW, WE'LL
[1:33:08] BE DECEIVED IN OUR EMOTIONS,
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; SEE, if those things if those things
[1:33:19] don't don't line up with the word, we
[1:33:21] got to cast that stuff down.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; I like that song, Sister Bernese.
[1:33:26] Anything that try to arise,
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; we cast it down. AMEN.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; SEE, WE SHOUT OVER PSALMS AND we operate
[1:33:35] differently.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; And you say, you saying that you you
[1:33:41] sounding arrogant. Nope.
[1:33:43] I'm revealing.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; We exposing.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Right. We're transforming the way that
[1:33:50] we think.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; SEE, CHURCH AIN'T WHAT WE WE WE WE WE
[1:33:55] THOUGHT IT WAS.
[1:33:57] SEE, I'M I'M IN A I'M IN A SPACE NOW
[1:33:59] WHERE I REALIZE, BRO, church ain't what
[1:34:03] what you know, cuz in our early days, we
[1:34:06] used to boy, I was deep preaching.
[1:34:09] That's all we wanted. Boy, I tell you
[1:34:11] what, that brother, praise God. He
[1:34:15] preached dark
[1:34:18] and but then we can't stand.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; So, what good did that do?
[1:34:25] See,
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; BUT BUT YOU KNOW WHEN WE COULD WHEN WE
[1:34:28] COULD take our time and kind of try to
[1:34:33] reprogram and program,
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; right? Yes, sir.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Cuz for for A LOT OF US, ESPECIALLY US
[1:34:40] ADULTS, we got to reprogram,
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; right? Glory to God. BUT FOR THESE
[1:34:46] YOUNGER ONES, WE GOT TO TRY TO program
[1:34:51] program,
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; right? Because they they growing up and
[1:34:55] and they looking,
[1:34:57] right? Come on.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, have mercy.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah. The little sisters, you know,
[1:35:06] they trying to be cute for a reason.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[1:35:11] You you walk you you kind of watch them
[1:35:14] walk around with that little air like
[1:35:16] you know I'm cute.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; Watch the way they you know play with
[1:35:20] their hands. Throw that thing back and
[1:35:23] you know
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; what ARE THEY DOING THAT far
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; and and the little fellas you know they
[1:35:30] they they looking too.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; They getting of age,
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; you know, but then we want to program
[1:35:37] them,
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; right? So they understand how to go
[1:35:44] about approaching and what to look for,
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; right? These young guys getting older,
[1:35:52] you know, and and you know, they got to
[1:35:56] know what to do. And and and and you
[1:36:00] know, if the devil send one to heels,
[1:36:02] they got to know what to do.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Cuz them nobody and women
[1:36:11] look good.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; Lord, help me to preach this morning.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; They the ones that's all doled up and
[1:36:26] this and that and then they got them
[1:36:30] heels and they know how to and the
[1:36:32] scripture said it. They'll be mincing.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; They know how to mince just right.
[1:36:41] Well, y'all didn't come to preach with
[1:36:42] me. I know.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; But it's it's it's it's
[1:36:47] transforming.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:36:51] And forming,
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; right? See, I you know, you you just for
[1:36:57] me AND I CAN'T JUST HINDSIGHT IS 2020. I
[1:37:00] could wish all I want to wish, but it
[1:37:03] ain't going to do me no good,
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:37:06] because I got more years behind me than
[1:37:08] I I I do in front of me. But here here's
[1:37:11] the thing that I've come to this this
[1:37:14] place now. Y'all y'all know I'm just a
[1:37:16] preacher. I just let him use me.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; BUT IN THE I HERE'S WHERE I'VE COME TO.
[1:37:22] I've got a lot of regrets,
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; all right, about my past.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; But in my future,
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; I want to live life not having regrets.
[1:37:34] Amen.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. SEE, WE ALL COULD SAY AMEN
[1:37:40] TO THAT.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; WE WE ALL COULD LOOK BACK AND AND
[1:37:43] THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE COULD
[1:37:46] HAVE DID BETTER, BUT we didn't.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU'RE YOU YOU'RE NOT DEFINED BY
[1:37:54] THAT. YOU JUST WANT TO BE ABLE TO SAY,
[1:37:57] YOU KNOW WHAT, FROM THIS POINT FORWARD,
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; SEE, I WANT TO LIVE A LIFE OF NO
[1:38:04] REGRETS.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; SO, I I I WANT TO TAKE MY TIME
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; AND PROCESS
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; AND ANALYZE THINGS SO THAT IT'S NO
[1:38:16] REGRETS.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; IF IF IF I MAKE A MOVE,
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; I've prayed about it. I've thought about
[1:38:25] it. I've I've taken it through the word.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Because I don't want regrets. You know,
[1:38:33] when when now it's like running it
[1:38:36] running across information, you know,
[1:38:39] you start doing things different.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Um uh I guess the other day
[1:38:46] I sent all of my kids a text,
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; right? I did I DID SOMETHING THAT I
[1:38:54] NORMALLY, you know, I communicate often
[1:38:57] with my kids, but sometimes
[1:39:01] there's certain things that they need to
[1:39:04] hear from me,
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. They need to and and THAT
[1:39:10] THEIR THEIR RESPONSE was overwhelming,
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; was encouraging,
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; is that right? Amen.
[1:39:20] you know, because I guess at one point I
[1:39:23] was a disciplinarian and I was
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; and I still am.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; But, you know, I realized too, you know,
[1:39:33] at this stage and the stage that they
[1:39:36] living in, I got to be different.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; I I it's it's imperative that I mature,
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:39:48] I'm I'mma say this. I'm kind of off now,
[1:39:50] but
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm on and I'm off.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; It's imperative for parents to grow,
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; IT'S IMPERATIVE FOR HUSBANDS AND WIVES
[1:40:06] to grow,
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? IT WITHOUT QUESTION, YOU YOU YOU
[1:40:13] CAN'T TAKE THINGS FOR GRANTED. AMEN.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; IT'S IT'S SO IMPORTANT
[1:40:19] uh to get AS MUCH POSITIVE information
[1:40:24] as you possibly can.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; UH BECAUSE IT IT'LL IT'LL MAKE YOUR
[1:40:29] SITUATION
[1:40:30] UH A WHOLE LOT BETTER. THE SPACE THAT
[1:40:34] YOU YOU'VE created for yourself
[1:40:37] TO BE BETTER.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Is that right? That's right.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; We error because we lack knowledge,
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; right? We we we make messes and
[1:40:50] different things just because of our
[1:40:52] lack and us not seeing the importance in
[1:40:57] educating ourselves on every level
[1:41:00] possible.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; Right. Glory to God. It's it's it's
[1:41:05] true.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:41:08] think things that IN IN ORDER FOR US TO
[1:41:11] SAY, you know what,
[1:41:13] in my future, man, I ain't going to be
[1:41:16] able to have to worry about looking back
[1:41:18] and saying, "Boy, I regret this and I
[1:41:20] regret that. I regret this and I regret
[1:41:23] that." I'll say this this morning. Let
[1:41:25] go your regrets this morning.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Let go your past regrets.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I I I heard a quote and
[1:41:35] I'm going paraphrase it from Martin
[1:41:37] Luther King and he he said um you know
[1:41:41] don't allow anybody
[1:41:44] to take you
[1:41:46] you know
[1:41:48] I'll have to say it like this because I
[1:41:50] can't remember it all to take you down
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; right
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; come on church
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; uh uh uh belittle you and this you know
[1:42:01] y'all know what I'm talking about Y'all
[1:42:03] smart my people. Y'all read between the
[1:42:04] lines.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. ALWAYS KNOW WHO YOU ARE AS A
[1:42:08] PERSON.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; So that YOU YOU COULD STAND UP AS A
[1:42:15] PERSON,
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; Only thing I could tell anybody is this.
[1:42:20] You know, I'm still growing.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; You, brother, you kind of all your you
[1:42:24] be white, but I'm still growing.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; And I ain't shamed, you know. No, I'm
[1:42:30] not. I ain't never told nobody I was a
[1:42:32] knowit- all or that I knew it all,
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; you know. And and as much as as much as
[1:42:37] hindsight, you know, I I I've come to a
[1:42:40] place where it's it's
[1:42:44] 2020. It's like we all wish we could,
[1:42:48] right? Come on.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. But we didn't.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; We' have made better decisions. We wish
[1:42:57] we probably sometime wish we would have
[1:42:59] married better people or DIFFERENT
[1:43:01] PEOPLE. AND SOMETIMES IT JUST BOILS down
[1:43:03] to two people, you know, lacking
[1:43:07] understanding
[1:43:08] and and and
[1:43:10] uh how how would I say this? No real
[1:43:15] forgiveness
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; and no real grace. BECAUSE SOMETIMES WE
[1:43:22] DON'T GIVE ONE ANOTHER GRACE,
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; BUT WE EXPECT A WHOLE LOT OF GRACE FROM
[1:43:26] GOD.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; WELL, praise the Lord.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm I'm just, you know, this
[1:43:37] morning, I'm just your your brother,
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; right? Trying to give us what, you know,
[1:43:45] by the spirit I feel that we need as a
[1:43:48] body,
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; right? just kind of, you know, with with
[1:43:53] uh Brother Jack and the brethren just
[1:43:55] trying to, you know, dovetail with with
[1:43:59] their inspiration. And if I could have
[1:44:01] gotten a little further, you know, but
[1:44:04] but we're we're
[1:44:06] WE'RE CONSTANTLY BUILDING,
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? I I believe I believe Brother
[1:44:11] Jack has a has an objective, right?
[1:44:15] uh in the restoration it's it's
[1:44:19] giving us an understanding okay we going
[1:44:22] back right BECAUSE BY GOING BACK we find
[1:44:27] out where our foundation is and that's
[1:44:32] Christ
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; right like the first quote that I read
[1:44:36] you know the prophet of God wanted the
[1:44:38] people to understand something here's
[1:44:41] here's what we stand for we stand for
[1:44:43] Christ
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; sir Amen.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; We preach Christ,
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; right? We don't preach a man,
[1:44:51] right?
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; THE THE MAN'S SOLE purpose was to to to
[1:44:58] open up to us the scripture.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; IS THAT RIGHT? THAT'S WHAT IT'S MEANT TO
[1:45:04] ME.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. IT AIN'T IT'S NOT A
[1:45:08] WORSHIP OF OF A MAN. BECAUSE IF YOU GO
[1:45:11] TO THE BOOK OF REVELATION, WHEN JOHN
[1:45:13] BOWED DOWN, HE SAID, "BOY, DON'T GET UP.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; DON'T don't you ain't here to worship
[1:45:19] me."
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? SEE, IT'S IT'S NOT A MAN,
[1:45:24] RIGHT?
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; But it is a man, the man Christ Jesus,
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHO WE WORSHIP,
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? Cuz cuz people be curious,
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? AND THEN SOMETIMES PEOPLE ARE
[1:45:39] NEGATIVE AND IT'S LIKE, "NO, YOU YOU
[1:45:42] just misunderstood."
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; And and we want TO GIVE YOU CLARITY. WE
[1:45:47] WORSHIPING CHRIST,
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? We we WE'RE WE'RE GOING BACK.
[1:45:52] BOY, I wish I had another hour.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; I feel like a long- winded
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; African preacher this morning.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; Boy, I ain't lying. And I ain't done
[1:46:03] yet, boy. I ain't done. I ain't done. I
[1:46:06] ain't done, boy. I got a whole lot. I
[1:46:08] got I got a I ain't even open my
[1:46:11] computer yet. I ain't even read. But uh
[1:46:15] Oh, Lord.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; I'mma read two or three things and I'm
[1:46:19] going to go. But boy, I know we got to
[1:46:21] go. Them other folk going to be looking
[1:46:23] at us funny if I stay up here. Good day.
[1:46:26] I WISH I COULD TAKE THEIR TIME THIS
[1:46:28] MORNING.
[1:46:30] Y'ALL COME ON IN HERE AND SIT DOWN CUZ
[1:46:32] WE PREACHING.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; WE PREACHING.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; WE'LL FEED YOU SOMETHING THIS MORNING.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; COME AND DINE THE MASTER'S CALLING. COME
[1:46:42] AND DINE. [screaming] YOUR FEAST AT
[1:46:44] JESUS TABLE THIS MORNING.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:46:50] Oh, I tell you, I
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; only the Holy Ghost can make me do that.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Okay, I can't do that on my own.
[1:47:05] Okay. He says, "Now we know exactly from
[1:47:07] the word which was recorded by the Holy
[1:47:09] Spirit. Watch this. How the first of the
[1:47:12] original church was founded and how God
[1:47:16] manifested
[1:47:18] himself in her. The word cannot change
[1:47:21] or be changed because the word is God."
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; Right? Thus, what the church was at
[1:47:30] Pentecost is the standard. Yes sir.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; That is the pattern. There is no other
[1:47:38] pattern. No matter what the scholars
[1:47:41] say, God has not changed that pattern.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; Say, "I'm God and I don't change."
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; What God did at Pentecost, he's got to
[1:47:49] keep on doing it until the church
[1:47:52] closed.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Giving the Holy Ghost. Is that right?
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; Those scholars may tell you the
[1:48:00] apostolic age is over. Don't you believe
[1:48:03] it? Such a statement is wrong on two
[1:48:06] counts. First of all, it is wrong to
[1:48:09] suppose there aren't any more apostles
[1:48:12] just because the original 12 are dead.
[1:48:14] Any an apostle means a sent one and
[1:48:18] there's are many sent ones today, but
[1:48:20] they're called missionaries. As long as
[1:48:23] men are being called and sent forth with
[1:48:25] the word of life, there is an apostle
[1:48:28] age going on.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. Right. Secondly, uh they
[1:48:34] refer to an age of manifested Holy Ghost
[1:48:38] power as being over. Boy, it can't be
[1:48:42] over.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; Not all this that I feel this morning.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; That's wonderworking power.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; That that is untrue. There is is not
[1:48:51] even one script to suggest, but many
[1:48:55] conclusively state otherwise. Here is
[1:48:58] our proof that both of these charges are
[1:49:02] false. The promise of power with which
[1:49:06] the apostles were endured with at
[1:49:08] Pentecost is to you,
[1:49:11] right? The Jews and to your children,
[1:49:15] the Jews, to all them that are fall
[1:49:17] Gentiles, to as many as the Lord our God
[1:49:20] shall call. He stops calling the
[1:49:23] Pentecostal message and power will not
[1:49:27] cease. What the church had at P I like
[1:49:30] this quote
[1:49:33] uh at Pentecost is her inaliable rights.
[1:49:38] Originally
[1:49:39] she had the pure word of God. She had
[1:49:42] the power of the spirit manifested
[1:49:45] in the uh diverse signs and wonders and
[1:49:49] gifts of the Holy Spirit. So as a as a
[1:49:53] new convert, you got to go back, Amen,
[1:49:56] to uh Pentecost, right? See, the
[1:50:00] original church was not organized by
[1:50:03] men.
[1:50:05] It was led by the Holy Ghost.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; It wasn't very big. It was hated and
[1:50:11] despised.
[1:50:13] It was oppressed. It was persecuted unto
[1:50:16] death. But it was true to God,
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; right? See, it stayed with the original
[1:50:24] word pattern.
[1:50:27] So, so you you you you see, you know,
[1:50:30] when when we're when we're preaching,
[1:50:32] WE'RE JUST TRYING TO SHOW US what was
[1:50:34] the original order of things. What was
[1:50:37] the original? CUZ IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE
[1:50:39] A CHURCH, AMEN. YOU GOT TO GO BACK TO
[1:50:42] THAT. YOU GOT TO FIND THAT.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; CUZ YOU YOU can't build on nothing else.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; Let let the musicians make their way.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; YOU YOU CANNOT BUILD on anything else
[1:50:53] out outside of that. Right.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "Now don't get led astray
[1:50:59] here. When I said that God and his ways
[1:51:02] never change, I didn't say that the
[1:51:04] church is the messengers could not
[1:51:07] change. The church isn't God. So that's
[1:51:09] why they always changing. See, so she
[1:51:12] can change. But what I said was that
[1:51:15] because of the unchanging God with
[1:51:18] unchanging ways, we can go back to the
[1:51:22] beginning and see the first and perfect
[1:51:25] acts of God and then judge by that
[1:51:29] standard. This is how it is done. Right?
[1:51:33] You got to go back to how the thing
[1:51:35] started.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; If not, you got yourself a mess,
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; right? You get you GOTA YOU GOT YOURSELF
[1:51:42] A MESS. I WISH I COULD STILL PREACH, BUT
[1:51:44] I'm going to go. Uh uh um you got to go
[1:51:47] BACK TO THE BEGINNING, RIGHT? And see,
[1:51:49] this is why Jude WAS LIKE, "BUT Y'ALL
[1:51:51] GOT TO FIGHT TO MAINTAIN."
[1:51:54] AMEN. This word standard,
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; right? THE THING THAT GOD STARTED A
[1:51:59] CHURCH OFF BECAUSE TO YOUR to your
[1:52:04] surprise, you'll find that the church
[1:52:06] starts to die.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; WHEN WHEN YOU START TO GET AWAY FROM the
[1:52:13] word, you start to slowly die,
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; right? See the the moment that Eve the
[1:52:20] the moment that Eve uh ptook of Satan's
[1:52:25] lie, right? Death death sat in
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; immediately. Death sat in. That's a
[1:52:34] quote.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; DEATH SAT IN. AND AND AND WE, YOU KNOW,
[1:52:39] IT MIGHT BE GRADUAL,
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? It might be gradual, but you
[1:52:45] dying.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; Spiritually, you dying.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; And I got it in this same Ephesian
[1:52:53] church age. I just ain't going to be
[1:52:54] able to get to it. Well, brother Banner
[1:52:57] start to say, you know, just things
[1:53:00] start changing,
[1:53:01] right? We we get these new ideas and we
[1:53:04] get all of this stuff and it's like,
[1:53:07] bro, to your detriment.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; To your detriment as a Christian.
[1:53:13] Right?
[1:53:14] And if if YOU KEEP GOING THAT WAY AND
[1:53:17] NOT come back and repent, man, you won't
[1:53:20] even resemble,
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; right? You won't even re resemble a
[1:53:26] Christian
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; a word abinding Christian. If you
[1:53:29] continue to go that route,
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; right? Come on.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; SEE THAT THAT'S WHY SERMONS LIKE THIS IS
[1:53:37] NEEDED.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. SO, so that we could show people
[1:53:42] the original Bible standard.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; And if if you're going to be a
[1:53:48] Christian, YOU YOU YOU GOT TO START OUT
[1:53:51] RIGHT.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; In order to end up right,
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; is that right?
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; Because if you just KIND OF MAKE IT,
[1:53:59] WELL, I'm I'm I'm Baptist. I'm this. I'm
[1:54:02] that. But that don't mean you're a
[1:54:04] Christian.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; That just mean you just went and joined
[1:54:08] something.
[1:54:10] Well, praise the Lord.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; That just mean you just joined something
[1:54:14] and you can't join this.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; You got to be born into this.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; VERILY, VERILY, I SAY TO YOU, A MAN GOT
[1:54:22] TO BE BORN AGAIN.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; See all this joining, but I'm not
[1:54:29] joining nothing. I I done been born into
[1:54:32] something and that's how I feel like
[1:54:34] this is all I need for the journey that
[1:54:35] I'm on.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:40] Somebody say, "Preach, Brother Smiley."
[1:54:43] Y'all got real quiet on Brother,
[1:54:45] brother. He f to go. But you know what?
[1:54:49] It's important. It's important for us,
[1:54:52] right? BECAUSE THE DEVIL, WHAT I TOLD
[1:54:56] Y'ALL LAST WEEK, last two weeks ago.
[1:54:59] See, the devil still wants to steal,
[1:55:01] kill, and destroy.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; HIS HIS AGENDA HAS NOT CHANGED.
[1:55:07] SEE,
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; and and and AND WE DON'T WANT OUR
[1:55:10] APPROACH JUST TO BE RANDOM and conno and
[1:55:13] mixed with feelings and this
[1:55:18] devil would be like, "Well, I got me
[1:55:19] one.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; I got me one."
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; Right? I know you got feelings and and
[1:55:26] all that. I ain't doing away with that.
[1:55:28] And and
[1:55:31] Right. But you It's so easy. I'm a
[1:55:34] living witness. I'm not preaching this
[1:55:36] because I ain't gone through nothing.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching this because I've gone
[1:55:40] through some stuff and and I I realize,
[1:55:43] buddy, if you let your feelings
[1:55:48] dictate your actions, you going to be in
[1:55:50] trouble.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; You You're going to be in trouble.
[1:55:56] You'll end up finding yourself back out
[1:55:58] there with a Newport and a bottle of
[1:56:02] Henny and and everything else.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; Huh? Not me. No. All right.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:56:13] Okay. Y'all think I was just born on
[1:56:18] yesterday,
[1:56:19] but I wasn't.
[1:56:23] I've been preaching this gospel for 32
[1:56:25] years
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; and I'm still growing.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; And and when it when it when it come to
[1:56:33] the gospel, I'm not going to short
[1:56:36] change you. I'll quit before I start
[1:56:39] short changing.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; Right. I would quit preaching. I sit in
[1:56:45] the back of the church. Amen to
[1:56:47] brothers. But I can't do it. I ain't
[1:56:49] built like that. God didn't build me
[1:56:51] like that.
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm I'm here to be shouldertosh
[1:56:57] shoulder with brother Jack to preach the
[1:57:01] gospel. Yes, sir.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; I'm not concerned about our feelings.
[1:57:06] You know, God will take care of your
[1:57:08] feelings
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; if they get hurt. But the Bible say,
[1:57:11] "Blessed is he that is not offended in
[1:57:13] me." How could you be offended at the
[1:57:16] word?
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; Right. It may be just something that's
[1:57:22] beyond what you ever even imagined,
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; right?

[2:05:57] Lord, he was talking about the the
[2:06:00] youth, those coming up behind us, Lord.
[2:06:04] Oh, we all feel a sense of
[2:06:05] responsibility,
[2:06:08] Lord God, to pass it down, Lord.
[2:06:13] Now, he said something. He said, "Your
[2:06:15] father is the only one that that that
[2:06:18] that want you to be better than them."
[2:06:22] And Lord, we all feel like spiritual
[2:06:24] fathers here this morning.
[2:06:27] We want to leave it in a better than
[2:06:30] when we found it. Lord,
