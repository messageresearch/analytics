may a man thank God for an enforcer appreciate many men Lord Jesus I mean let's just stand to fading man on this morning Thank You musicians who certainly appreciate you very very grateful for how God is blest feared a man he's been real good to us throughout the years amen and just just just appreciate all of all the help that God has given the church I want to let managers read a couple scriptures if you won't just bear with me we will go back to our scripture out of second Peter chapter 1 we have been making our journey through war strategies and we're gonna pick up a different angle we preached war strategies patience with God last time and then we were together and this morning I want to use the subject war strategies patience with each other a man patience with each others won't have want us to have patience with God but another is to have patience with each other so we want to minister on that this morning and just for our foundation of scriptures here second Peter chapter 1 starting at verse 4 whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and this is what we're focusing on amen here today patience glory to God and to patience godliness to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity but if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore there brother brethren give diligence to make your call in an election sure but if you do these things you shall never follow a turn with me also over to Genesis chapter 14 in man and I forgot to mention to you all I had a Papa to me to talk with brother Oh bless this week and he told me to make sure that I let the church know that he sent his greetings to you all amen also brother brother Walker a man also sent his greetings to the church here amen Genesis 14 and we're using the platform of the statue of a perfect man because this is what God is given to us as believers a man this is what brings us to a place of perfection this is what gives us overcoming power these are things that we should be striving for daily and you know just constantly constantly don't describing just to look more like Jesus but I'm using it as a platform and then I'm going back and showing a man maybe in the Old Testament where this was applied to a man a war strategy was applied but will need this war strategy or strategies to overcome the enemy and our daily walk so here Genesis 14 verse 1 Stinson came to pass in the days of rafael the king of shinar arioch king of ellasar cheder a lot more king of elam and tidal king of nations that these made war with their king of sodom and with bersia king of gomorrah shine f king of admah and sham eber king of the boehm and the king of bela which is or all these were joined together in the Vale of Siddim which is the salt sea about 12 years they serve General Omar and and the third and the thirteenth a year they rebelled and in the fourteenth year came General Omer and the kings that were with him and smote the fame in Ashtaroth qarnain and zoos em and ham and the Imams in Sheva kyria thing and the whole rice in their mouth in their Mount Seir m2l Paran witches by the wilderness and they returned and came to and mish and mishpat which is Kadesh and smote all the country of the Amalekites and also the amma rights that dwell in hazen the hay haze on tomorrow and there went out the king of sodom the king of gomorrah and the king of admah and the king of zeboiim and the king of bela the same as so are and they joined battle with them in the Vale of Siddim with cheddar cheddar a lo more the king of elam and with tidal king of nations and amraphel king of shinar arioch king of ellasar four kings with five and the Vale of Siddim was full of slime pits and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled and fell there and they that remained fled to the mountain and they took all the goods of sodom and gomorrah and all their vittles and went their way and they took lot Abrams brothers son who dwelt in Sodom and his Goods and departed a man and there came one that had escaped and told Abram the Hebrew for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite brother of ash coal and brother of a nur and and these were Confederate with Abram and when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive he armed his trained servants born in his own house 318 and pursued them unto damned and he divided himself against them and he and his servants by night and smoked them and pursued them unto Hoba which is on the left hand of Damascus and he brought back all the goods and also brought again his brother lot and his Goods and the women also and the people a man let's uh pray father we thank you O God for the abilities to read the Word of God may the Holy Spirit come now upon the word and Lord just give us understanding like quicken to us Lord the things that would draw us closer to you thank you for each and every heart that has come Lord to hear the Word of God today bless those that were not able to be a part of the service we want to remember the the johnston's as they're traveling God and they're to Denver this weekend just be with them or God and I believe brother Caleb is also with them so be with them Oh God and just watch over and let them all arrive and return back home safely is our prayer get glory out of all that is done in this service today in Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you you can be seated praise the Lord again we want to use the subject war strategies and patience with each other that is our title for today amen in the statue of a perfect man brother branham tells us about these two TV speaks on two different types of patience he talks about patience with God and then he also talks about patience with one another and you know just a brief I want to read a quote that we read at the end of patience with God just to kind of hit that again he hit seven different examples in scripture about patience with God one was Abraham how he had patience with God Noah and how he had patience with God Moses had patience with God and I believe he said with Moses and when you've done what you know God has told you to do then just stand still and be patient amen when you've done everything that God told you to do just stand stand still and be patient don't worry about it God will take care of everything else right a man sometimes we find ourselves fighting trying to prove ourselves no stand still and be patient right God will vindicate you let me tell you when God vindicates you that's better than you vindicating yourself a man so easy use Moses it used the Hebrew boys who used Daniel they use Paul and and I love the story of Paul because as the Lord was showing me that I came out my preach tip and I said you could be in the midst of euro-crime and still in the perfect will of God a man we come out and see that one Sunday in the next Sunday we didn't have your cloud on it they had a different name they've called bori and a man but we was in the midst of torreón and still in the perfect will of God hallelujah yeah you can go on to Indiana still in the perfect will of God even though door is bare on you you can still be in the perfect will of God facing a tempestuous storm the holy God you've got to know who you are in Christ and I'm gonna tell you every quite some patience a man for me to go and my family stuck here I had to have patience and just wait on the Lord God did some God this America's force y'all ain't man I might as well since I'm here I might as well just shared i'ma get into my subject but you know we had three two flights canceled on us we were trying to come back home and one our flights cancelled I think on Friday night Lord what we gonna do so we got up the next morning figured out a plan and then we got on got on board with Delta and Delta was gonna bring us home and say okay it's all work time let's go on and keep reaching and and we get to the last service preaching the gospel and the last service comes up and and after the last service everybody said he man I'm talkin chirps let out a great shouts I mean it was it was you know as I say I said Joshua told him to shout they require patience that can talk as they walked around the malls the walls of Jericho but when they let out that shout God brought the walls down I say on the count of three let out a shout I counted the three in the whole church erupt in us that was that was that was some church you know and right after we had this great shout we get a text or email saying your flight was just canceled I say Lord we supposed to fly it in the morning you know and so we like okay how are we gonna do this and you know we're trying to work through some things and and finally you know we come together amen that Monday morning and and we got everybody you know all situated and we called him we found out that they were still flying to Miami they weren't flying to Fort Lauderdale they weren't flying to West Palm but they're flying to Miami and we had already paid I think a couple hundred dollars for the change another flight but to fly to Miami was gonna be $500 you know we called Delta on the phone say that we want to just get off this flight let's go in the front lot of them being cancelled please reroute us to Miami and say okay we'll do it and they did it for free hallelujah right so I said God is working $500 just gotta race went went no I mean went to nowhere land I'm like okay thank you Lord I see you're moving right so I jumped don't be jumped on that plane and said I think we was on the phone with Delta at 10 in the morning the flight was leaving at 12:48 they said can you get that said yes we can and they went running up the stairs getting all these stuff together and running back out out the hotel we trying to run to the airport and we made it there just in time come to find out that was the last flight that was coming to Miami God put us on the last flight hallelujah glory they told us to expect turbulence and by and the worst thing I felt is when the plane was landing God protected us on the plane hallelujah amen out of the winner the plane airport night they go to storm right over there Huck you see that right out the window I say Lord her and we come laying there right on the other side of that now III I'm certainly I see how do I want to say this the right way I certainly feel for the people in the Bahamas Amen I feel very very I feel bad I wish I wish some of us could have been there to welcome some of them yesterday Amen here to South Florida with us if you need a church I know your church your church has been wiped out but if you need a church hallelujah here's some where you can come right I wish we could have been there in Miami doing something like that I mean when they come in yesterday but but but wow you know Bahamas was certainly suffering I do say God was holding things up to allow our plane to get right in and when that plane got in we thought it was going to be a very terrible conditions but it was so calm in Miami and so calm in Fort Lauderdale our cars were parked in the Fort Lauderdale Airport and we like how we gonna get the cars out they have told us not to even show up at the airport because we're not going to let you on the property and as I'm driving by the airport I say I got to try I say you know my cars and then I don't want to have to come back down here Lord just give us favor we we drove right on up on the airport and we got there and right where the police was stopping everybody the man walked up to my casa are you here to get your car sir I say yes sir he say father this officer right on in and he'll take you there to get your car I say glory to God and we come right on home with no problems and then the next day no storm I'm talking about God is good god is good just just stated our coast right so I just believe God did that because we did something for him I'm crazy enough to believe that I told people a man there in our indy and i say the reaiiy mean paul the people that was on the boat with paul they were spirit because Paul was on the boat huh they were spared because Paul was on the boat so I'm crazy enough to believe that South Florida could have been spared from Miami all the way up to West Palm Beach because we had to get home I'm crazy enough to believe that hallelujah now that don't that don't mean that every storm come pass us hallelujah God did God showed us favor for that moment but there's gonna be some storms coming because judgment is strike in the land huddled it's just sometimes I hate to say it's the only way God can get people's attention Amen when judgment when these acts of judgment come comes you can't even explain how a storm like this just just come out of nowhere they got another one out there right now hallelujah amen everywhere we turn it's just judgment judgment just somebody ought to get serious about God's alright Amen so you know I thank God for that but but you can be in the midst of your Clyde on and still be in the will of God brother Branham also talked about the believers on the day of Pentecost amen and how you know they were patient waiting on the Lord but today we want to pick up another aim an example of this patience patience with each other let me read a couple statements here Amen a quote or so from statue of a perfect man I'm starting at paragraph 275 glory to God stay with me it says we should have patience with one another to see it says one time we get so much impatient with one another I love the statement we get so much impatient with one another we think we got to be like Moses Moses had patience with the people look that's what caused him not to go over see if you're trying to do something like I've tried to get this message over at the Tabernacle to see that each member of the tabernacle become this and he's talking about the statue of a perfect man become this amen it's hard to do I've tried to have patience this is 33 years see have patience women still Bob their hair still just the same but just have patience just see just have patience wait have to if you ain't got it don't try to build on this down here have patience oh my I know what that's like you know a brother branham being a pastor and and shepherding the people and you come and you bring a certain truth to the people and but everybody keep going on doing the same thing everybody and you don't know how much it requires patience not to say nothing Amen not that you don't see it you see it all but it require patience oh my god a man a man it's something that I all shy wasn't thinking about sharing this but it just came to my spirit and it's something that I appreciate I won't i won't i won't i won't say who it is but I'll say this I was helped I was held at the younger stage of my ministry amen when I first started out I remember a man a sister just showed me a scripture you know all she did was do I love the way she did it she just showed me the scripture and the scripture said the wrath of man does not work the right to of God and when I read that script I see who that's a yes Lord ain't number and it just showed me see you got to have patience with God's people right don't come out attacking everybody just because it ain't done the way to to want it done just preach the word and God will take care of the rest of it right just have patience with God people Oh a man somebody I learned that lesson a long time ago because you know I mean you can come out Minister can get something in his spirit and just kind of carry that thing and he actually ended up reaching to you know the one person that ain't doing right and forgetting about the 99 that's doing right right the one you preach to the one that's wrong and forget about the 99 let's do it right so the 99 let's get that's do right I'm not being edified hallelujah glory to God and you just chased them and how do you know whether you're chasing a goat or sheep because they both played the same hey man you don't know what you're chasing just preach the word I ain't gotta go out of my way you know what's right and wrong right and when the Holy Spirit wanted to be said he'll say it glory to God he'll say it if you cutting your hand should be cutting he'll say it you putting on makeup and sin let me put on makeup he'll say it your skirt too short he'll say how do you miss somebody amen the Holy Ghost know exactly when to say what he want to say you know what's right and you know what's wrong but as a pastor I gotta be patient hey Lambie met because somebody ain't struggling with makeup so I can't preach the make up sermon every week hello somebody somebody somebody not overcame that thing and they trying to go deeper in cards hallelujah somebody but we gotta learn to be patient with one another brother Branham say what MP I mean he say say we're so impatient amen he says we got so much emphasis I said now the word impatience means to be quickly irritated or provoked quickly irritated all right I mean you can't allow yourself to get quickly irritated now you know I mean like what the Peter asked Jesus how many times I forgive my brother seven times anybody has some seven times is that enough Jesus say seven times seventy hallelujah 490 times so that requires patience Oh hallelujah we we need that this is where God is trying to take us to we can't be quickly irritated and easily provoked come on somebody not not not not not what your brother and sister Amen actually not even at down the streets as Christians we should be the example hallelujah amen we should be the ones in the arguments come on church we should be the ones Amen I just got to say something why why you as the Christian got to be the one to say something why can't you answer Christian just close it up and say nothing commit it to God I mean it's all kind of situations come up and I'm just gonna let know be patient with others hallelujah praise God I think God for that it meant so so he said where we get so impatient with one another and I'm just you know let me just preach this morning y'all just let me preach now this is this show happens in families parents impatient with the kids kids impatient with the parents husband impatient with the wife wife impatient with the husband and we just have all kind of you know if we practice patience it would be less arguments on the way to church uh-huh and I'm not you know old glory to God let me just say it to say this to you know in order to avoid an argument don't mean you have to drive in separate cars huh hey man you ought to be able to come together to church without argue because you know you already know that the devil like to use that time so it might be a good time not even talk about anything that could career could create an argument hallelujah you gotta recognize the devil when he coming come on church all right all right all right we got to learn to be patient with one another some things you just put in the parking lot say we'll talk about that later all right all right let me go on so you know let me let me read a quote here questions and answers part three gotta learn to be patient with one another hey man the Prophet says this this is a question that comes to him and says brother branham how am I supposed to show my wife that I really care for her and yet stay with the word so that's that stay with the word but still having a question like this said why don't you practice what you preach I believe so his wife is always telling why don't you just practice what you preach so the husband is like how do I show my wife that I really care for her and yet stay with work because you know as a husband I got the I got to put my foot down you know this is the Word of God you know that's where we are as husbands right you know but but here the question is acts how do i how do I do this because my wife is telling me why don't you practice what you preach Oh hallelujah when it when it gets silent like that brother Devon you know you in there you know you in there women I'm gonna get real quiet halle-loo you know God's speaking then let's just read the quote he says well then if the wife it's the way to send this to you when she has a right to see it can we read the quote the wife is sending because she got a right to say it all right saying you better get right so what the prophets say you better get it right cuz she got a right to say that to you ain't man hallelujah better get since you see things that other people don't see glory got so she has a right to say you better get right see then it is saying it just to be evil remember the Bible said it was better than a millstone was hanged at your neck and drowning the deficit of see then even to fin the least of these my little ones now just that's just your question I'm and maybe maybe that this wife is not that type of perfect person maybe she's different maybe she's a good person person maybe she's just testing you to see what you'll do I'm reading says now stay in love with her and let her see Jesus in you you do that you just go on set I give a little illustration this morning now the prophets say stay in love with her and let us see Jesus in you come on somebody say I give a little illustration this morning about a person one time this little woman had received the Holy Ghost now now now remember the question was about the husband now the rest of this quote is gonna apply to the wife but what this wife does is exactly what a husband should be doing hallelujah so you already know the story but I'm not gonna tell you the store we're gonna read you the story amen but I want you to catch that this was an example the Prophet was given for a husband we use this for the wives but this example is actually for the husband let's read it like this I was there I was at home and and just looking at this I say Lord that a preach oh now look at this look at this look at this he says says now now one time this just this little woman had received the Holy Ghost and she was a very sweet little person where she had a hard life and her husband wasn't alcoholic says and so she just kept on she blows him he says you want to go to church honey take off but but I just I just go down to the saloon the Brown Derby down here go on so they hung out down there all the time used to be Boniface many of your old Thomas here remember when bountiful hat there on the corner it's called Brown Derby I believe it is so hang it around down there and the first thing you know one night come up a question about church and about Christians one of the old drunks sitting there said there ain't no such a thing as Christians anymore hallelujah said there's no such thing all this bunch of hypocrites said you see them out here smoking and drinking doing the same thing that we do that's what the Simmons are saying so a Christian should be sub doing something different than what Amen the sinners are doing hallelujah amen it sense since I doing the same thing we do and said call themselves Christians there is no such this is what drunk people were talking about says this one drunk raised up and said just a minute he said there's one that I know about said lizard said it's my wife said she becomes salty he was catching it all the time he said I bet if she was put to a squeeze oh Lord I wanted to just ask if we just put you to a squeeze how would you react with the patience of God come come come come flowing out of you I would you be over impatient if you're put to the squeeze come on somebody look at this he said he said no she's still a Christian what her husband that didn't even want to go to church recognized that his wife was a Christian i'ma just leave it there I believe it he already know the rest of the story i'ma just i'ma tell the rest of the audience you can pull it down so her husband recognized that this is a Christian and our husband is telling all the drunks they made it inside the bar man I know my wife a Christian I mean I don't know about nobody else but I know my wife say I'll tell you what let's put her to the squeeze let's put it to the test say okay let's do it cuz I know she got still keep her Christianity so they come up with a scheme they gonna go back to the house and they're gonna act when they're in the house and they're gonna they're gonna put her through a test and see how she responds amen to this test so when they get back to the house what they decide to do is it's take you know they've gotten to the house the man knew that they had some ham and eggs in the refrigerator so he tells why I say you know this is my company I want you to cook us some eggs and some ham mine and he knew that was dead so so he knew that you know she could've said well we ain't got that so she went in she fixed it prepared it very well and then after she finished preparing it she comes and she lays it lays it out on the table and gives it to him and this was their test oh my said they said now we're not gonna eat it I'm like I'm gonna give our heart to something I'm gonna just tell I don't like it like this so soon she brought it down you know how like my eggs like this why you give me something like that trying to embarrass me in front of my company take this away from me come on boys let's get out of here walked away now she could have just kind of got upset I know she you know she ain't like this this modern-day sister hello somebody the modern-day sister that that'll probably give him a piece of his mind in front of his friends huh glory to God you know how we do that right I'm gonna give you a piece of my mind in front of your company right so so ya know that's not the way she handled it so she she went only said she said honey if you die I will I will actually give you back you know I'll cook you some more some more eggs I know you didn't like it that way but I could get somewhere I make it just like you know she say he say you know I like it that way the first let's just leave me alone just leave leave us all alone so so so so so before you know it they eats up underneath the window and they heard after daytime similar after they squeezed up after they put her through the trial after they put it through the text they eased up under the window to see how she was gonna react she was just sniffling a little bit crying a little bit her feelings hurt a little bit but she was also singing a song must Jesus bear this cross alone and all the world go free she said no there's a cross for everyone and there's a cross for me can I actually are you willing to bear your cross till you be patient with God not to bear your crops hallelujah glory to God she CSEC she said she was singing that song and and the fellas looked at each other said man you're exactly right your wife is a Christian I didn't think there was no more questions Christians but you're right your wife is a quick Christian they came back in and apologized to a total of what they was doing and the lady let her husband and them drunks to Christ that night through her example by her ability to be patient with another and remember that story was given to answer question of a husband that was having problems with his wife he said and what brother branham's answer to that man amen at the beginning of that his answer was saying it says first you say you better get right and then secondly he says my said stay in love with her and let us see Jesus in you so when you're having patience one with another you have to stay in love with her and let us see Jesus in you now that says that's good I like that I can just I can work here all day stay in love with her stay in love with her now you know how you how it was when you first got married you would take out you thought you found money you found money a man to take her out with glory to God some y'all don't have some embarrassing moments trying to go to some expensive restaurant that you didn't have the money to go to right but you found money you want to talk about no McDonald's you want to talk about no no no dollar menu you weren't talking about none of the things you found money to treat her like a queen now when you get married guess what you're gonna have to do find some money to treat her like a queen if you're gonna stay in love with her I'll help me somebody but the Prophet said if you won't see problems go away if you just do what the Prophet told us to do stay love with her and let us see Jesus in you this is a war strategy this is how we overcome the enemy I got more I got more I got more let me let me just let me just give y'all this get let me get why other people so tossed about hallelujah glory to God look at this look at this one right here says a young fellow come to me not long ago he was a Pentecostal he's seen too many of these meetings and he goes in and his wife is a staunch Lutheran she said well I guess you all went down and shouted last night so she sees she's picking on them right here's another one that's why you got to know who you marrying praise the Lord right you you create these problems when you get unequal yoke right so here he is a Pentecostal his wife is a Lutheran it's problems in this house now if you got overcome these problems with some things you gonna have to do hello somebody amen but when you when you made Amen these type of commitments there's things you got to do in order to keep your marriage in the right place all right but but those of you that are not married I advise you find somebody that believes the way you believe praise the Lord don't get unequally yoked you'll find yourself in a world of trouble all right young fella company not long ago he was a Pentecostal he's seen too many these meetings and he goes in and his wife is a staunch Lutheran let me she ain't changin Laurey God she said well I guess you all went down and shouted last night said I guess guess you was I guess she was all speaking in tongues and doing all this last night and he got he got on the floor and said God I cast the devil out of her now that's what the husband did he was upset with this with his wife for picking at him for what was going on at the church he and he just immediately attacked God now look at this I cast the devil out of her almost a divorce curt divorce case man a fine man he come to me say brother branham we're gonna have we're going to have a divorce I guess he said I just can't get that devil to move out uh-huh I said brother you're going at it the wrong way I said when she starts like that say all right dear bless your heart honey this wonder this is advice from the Prophet when his wife is I mean if she intentionally is going in these directions to to get him all riled up and when we need to win she that when he recognizes that she's doing that his response is supposed to be all right dear bless your heart honey do we need to practice that or something all right dear bless your heart honey come on brothers let's let's try them on Oh three on the count of three one two three all right dear bless your heart honey [Music] not you better get in your place we were talking to you got to know who you talking to you know I wear the pants in this house no that's not what he said that's not he said you're going about it the wrong way you got to go - all right dear bless your heart honey let's keep on reading I'm gonna taste them if y'all just get this simple principle on being patient one with another your whole situation of change everything in your household a change now I'm gonna tell you why the devil tax households if he can defeat a household he can defeat a church if he can defeat a household he can defeat a church so so at first a many households have got to be intact everything's got to be working perfectly otherwise it's going to impact the church hallelujah look at this he says he says brother you're gonna going at it the wrong way says when she starts like that all right dear bless your heart honey and be real kind to her now i'ma tell you that sir that's the hardest time to be calm as when she acting like that but it's a be real kinda huh just see how much you can do for her this is hard it's easy but hard because if we're thinking you don't want to do nothing for but right now like he said be real kind and see how much you can do what you need you need this what you need what you need and all along you don't realize but you killing that Devil with kindness you killing the devil with kindness because you show him patience look at this he said brother branham well how will I ever get the devil out of huh I say you do as I say and just keep praying in your heart that's another one it's nuggets all in here pray where that means don't be in your prayer closet father this is Evelyn my wife god deliver my wife see see see see see battle by devil don't use that type of language in your prayer closet pray that in your heart in your heart you say things like that you just create more of a problem come on now he said he said just keep reading RC I said God will take care of the rest of it he called me up about two or three weeks later what the situation he'd been fighting for for some time was changed in two or three with two or three weeks later when he applied with the Prophet total apply do you want to see your situation change do what the Prophet just said do and watch things change all right dear bless your heart honey make me want to shout glory that God's a man not now when you do that you whacker say don't don't don't don't don't be giving me that I know you get that from see you do that say all right dear what can I do for you brother it'll revolutionize everything hallelujah Luisi say call me about two or three weeks later said my home's revolutionize he said my wife is a different person I said which is the most powerful screaming and kicking and stopping or putting your arms around in love God is love God so loved the world so which is the most powerful you putting your arm around her and love or scheme screaming and kicking and punching holes in the wall and everything else which one is most powerful I love this I love this until this is a war strategy because sometimes be some serious Wars that be happening in the houses big time war war zone you walk into that house it's a war zone husband on this side wife on that side praise the Lord and the only way we're gonna overcome these things by applying war strategies one of your war strategies is patience patience with one another amen patience with one another now if you can't show that at home how you gonna show outside the house a man Church we got to be able to show it at home patients with one another now now now brother branham used example of the brother you know doing that with his wife or also in a previous example of the of the wife doing a particular thing with our husband we can all take this husband or wife we can all take this they maintain use it to overcome the enemy in our situations patients with one another another thing that the Prophet said and this is another thing that we should always always remember and I won't I don't have time to read all of this amen but he says every seven years people go through changes so every seven years people go through changes husband a man or woman every seven years you go through some type of change and so so oftentimes when you're looking at people maybe some things that they might be going through try to try to see if they might be in that cycle of seven try to see that right so you know a you know 7 14 21 28 35 42 49 right 56 praise the Lord 63 70 they go through changes praise God I'm preaching they go through change so I I might have called one of y'all birth I mean you're aged out and one of those numbers but as a as a as a family member if you know your family members around that age watch the change that they might be going through and brother branham say when that happens that's when you really got to be patient with the person understand that that change is going to occur in their life when they hit a particular age there's a shift that happens in that just naturally it's a natural shift oh my I'm in age to be things that I used to be able to do I get on the road and glory to God we would drive from here to there and drive back and not feel nothing hallelujah but I hid a change I hid a change and when I hit the change I can't do that you spent time I could drive I remember we used to drive out to Oklahoma I mean 30 hour trip I would take 25 hours of the 30 hours driving straight through no problem now I'm looking for a airplane hallelujah even I don't even want to go three hours up the road I'm just I hit eight change there was a shift that took place you get tired just just thinking about it right but this is what happens when you when you hit the ship you got to understand it so when you catch people kind of add a shift then a that's it that's a that's the time to show extra patience Oh hallelujah more patience during that time more patience oh my man let me just read a part of this quote this is out of the indictment just a part of this quote he says says eateth because it was talked about Edith right she had gone through this change and she was going through menopause and and she was just thinking so hard of herself during this time but brother Branham said just now Edith with this just changing of the seven years every seven years your life changes so the seven the seven times seven you see and it makes it kind of hard and that's a complete change seven times seven he say is a complete change so I just hit that y'all gonna have to be patient with me glory to God it says the complete change and it bothers the women men usually get kind of a funny carrying on during that time and sometimes leave their wives but women are unfertile unfertile after that and we'll go through that and we must remember that it's things that we must bear with one another and understand those things we must bear with one another and understand those things so when somebody kind of hits that spot then you know just just be patient with them just be patient with a glory to God let me just give you just a couple of more cooks I'm gonna leave that one right there and I want to just jump into this a little bit oh lord thank you God a couple more quotes here this one's coming out of how the angel a man came to me how the angel came to me how the angel came to me it says I got a brother that's tall in thin blond headed pug nose and fair-skinned he don't look like me we don't act alike you never know he we was brothers but his daddy is my daddy and if the family accepted him looking the way he did except to me looking the way I did then we accept one another to be brothers so that's right so that's the way we have to do in this Christian realm we have to believe have faith in one another when the Christians lose faith in one another the devil's got the church right then when the Christians lose faith with one another then the Devils got the church right there that's why you got to fight with everything you got soon as you see the devil rises hey to try to bring the vision in the church you gotta that hallelujah gotta be patient with one another you never said no my brother didn't mean to do that no my sister didn't mean to do that no that's not that character you gotta fight that devil hallelujah somebody Gloria when Christians lose faith in one another the devil's got the church right there that's right we got to have faith and confidence in one another bear with one another got to have patience for each other you got to have patience for each other glory to God let me give you one more the church in this condition hallelujah glory to God all right it says this how many here that's backslidden solo you say I wouldn't admit that brother branham but look if the Dove of meekness is going from you brother there's something wrong can I can I say that if the Dove of meekness it's gone from you brother there's something wrong that's why we ought to be in pray all the time Lord let's you let let I want I want your character be manifested in and through me if the Dove of meekness is gone from me there's something wrong but there's something wrong when you came bare with one another when you can't forgive every person from the very depths of your heart no matter what they've done or what they say it if you came forgive them from the depths Jesus said if you don't forgive every man it's trespass from your heart neither does your heavenly Father forgive you Church this is so important that we learn amen to have patients one with the other and I'm gonna tell you the greatest trials that you can ever have are the trials that happen right within a man so church fight that with everything got half patience one with another now I go back here to statue of a perfect man because the Prophet makes these comments and let me I'll read a couple of them here and then I'll switch gears glory to God I love this a man so he says here in a paragraph 277 he says even one time when that rebellion bunch of people had such impatience they caused Moses to do something wrong but yet when it come to a showdown God got sick of their action he said separate yourself Moses I'll kill the whole bunch of them and start anew he throwed himself in the breech and said God don't do it what patience with the people that was rebelling against him catch that statement catch that statement brother branham said Moses have patience with the people that were rebelling against him think about it right amen sometimes in a church you can get rebellion going on but you got to have patience with the people that's rebelling against you in a household in a family kids can grow up and start rebelling but you got to have patience with the people that's rebelling against you you go back and look at Moses situation there and numbers 14 and God was sort of so thinner I mean I think about ten different times where the people had done something wrong God got fed up they tempted God in the wilderness God say you know what I will not let this this group of people go over to the promised land say Moses back up I'm gonna kill everybody Moses said Lord if you do that then the other nation is gonna say you brought him out but she was not able to bring them in and and God you you did this but you couldn't do that the people don't talk about your Lord all the other nations don't say these things say Lord please don't do this God says say Moses I hear your prayer Moses stood in the gap for those people that were rebelling against him Moses Moses stood there the same way Christ stood in between heaven and earth for our sins hallelujah amen Moses stood in the gap just the way Christ in the gap and we will be required at times to stand in the gap for somebody that's rebelling thus it's easy to stand and gap for people that that best best doing everything right but when they're doing everything wrong you got to stand in the gap for them God heard Moses prayer God said okay mother so I tell you what now i'ma tell you this 20 years and older they'll go in but this was that's 20 years I mean they'll die right here in the wilderness now they won't go to the problems and they'll die right here but I'm gonna I'm not gonna kill them right now in an instance I'm gonna hear your prayer Moses stood in the gap for church we got to do the same thing here he was having patience with people that rebelled against him the Prophet says I wonder if we could do that if you can't don't try to build on this because it don't it don't change it now that's the way the first one was vulcanizing to this and that's the way every one of them has to be vulcanize if you don't don't come to that statue of the dwelling place of the Living God if you haven't got patience patience one another all right now I use a man the story of Abraham here a man that talked about these these kings going to war glory to God and and and I use Abraham as our example of an Old Testament character that had patience with somebody else we have to have patience one with the other a man and as I just kind of thought about Abraham the previous chapter kind of talked about Abraham the scripture says that he was a very wealthy man and when I read that I highlighted it you know cuz if I'm Abraham seed I'm supposed to be the same way praise the Lord a man so so you know I looked at that and and what it happened was that Abraham when God called Abraham he didn't call a lot he called Abraham alone glory to God but when Abraham brought lot with him it created many problems in the camp and the land as the land was not able to bear both Abraham's group and life's group so so Abraham finally came a lot and he gave him a choice to say look the ladders not able to bear we constantly strive having strife because they fighting with one another your herdsmen with my herdsmen sex consciousness something coming up say the land is not able to bear so say I'll tell you what look just just just just raise your head and look and you choose which direction you want to go if you want to stay here I'll let you stay here if you want me to go out though but if you want to go you can go and I'll stay here but we got to separate in order to stop all this this dis dis bickering and everything that's going on we got to stop amen all the confusion all the fight and we got I mean somebody got to come to a point somebody gotta be the bigger person in the situation say look we gotta stop all this let's come to some type of agreement abraham was able to do that abraham was able to do that so so here you know not now now you would think that if abraham is is i mean get to the point where look man I'm so tired a lot I'm so tired of all this bicker and I'm so tired of all this fighting that you know I just won't like to leave I just want him just to get out just just leaving and after lot left it's with God éxito said and I look around me bruh ham now every everything and all the letters you see I bless you with that that's where he received his inheritance is when lot left that's according to the scripture that's when he received everything God promised him it's actually with lot left there's some people gauger have to get out of your life for a season hallelujah some people are hinder you from getting what you're supposed to have in God because you include him and God never included them they not part of the blessing hallelujah somebody but but you keep trying to make them part of the blessing amen but all the strife was coming up so God could get get a lot in one place and now you can deal specifically with Abraham but now you think that Abraham it's free and it's in his heart free in the spirit that men I finally got rid of life I finally got rid of life Oh hallelujah I thank God that Abraham didn't have that type of spirit in him glory to God Oh hallelujah we should never have that type of Sparrow oh they're gone good what you got the wrong spirit when you're doing something like that they going good know if your heart not crying out and praying for somebody that's not here something's wrong with you hallelujah but my ear here Abraham you know he's here doing whatever he's doing and life is over there and Abraham gets words that there was a war that occurred a battle that happened these kings come down and and took all the people out of sodom and gomorrah and he knew life was living down there in Sodom hallelujah and hear hear when he hears about you know lot was taken captive Abraham not being a warrior Abraham not really having any warriors in his camp he just got trained service 300 trained service but he's about to go after five kings because his brother is captured I won't try to get that hallelujah glory to God the read that the thing that brought that the thing that caused Abraham they wanna do something about this it's because his brother not the one that was causing a headache Oh y'all didn't get it now not the one that was causing them problems amen to Abraham he's not a problem maker he's my brother Oh Church I hope that said sin he's he's not a one that's causing me problems he's my brother she not causing me issues she's my sister and if she gets in trouble imma be right there to get her out hallelujah the same one that was cause of Abraham all the trouble was the first one he went after when he found out that he was in trouble he went sit around saying that's good for God don't teach him a lesson it's my time this happened to him no that's not the attitude of Abraham give the train service together and let's go after five kings I want you to see this in scripture Abraham goes there in Genesis 14 and-and-and this let's look at this cuz you know great things happen well I mean when your spirit is right and you're doing things the way God wants you to do it you might meet somebody that you wasn't expecting to meet you might come in contact with somebody you never expected to have contact with huh but but when your spirit is right these the supernatural can take place look at this now because let's pick it up amen in Genesis 14 verse 13 and there came one that escaped and told Abram the Hebrew friend welt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite brother of s : brother Anna and these were confited with Abram and when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive notice he uses a term brother not-not-not not the one that's caused me all these issues but my brother right amen his brother was taken captive he armed his trained servants born in his own house 318 and pursued them unto damned and he divided himself against him and he and his service by night and smoked them and pursued them unto Hoba which is on the left hand of damascus and he brought back all the goods and also brought again his brother lot and his goods and the women also and the people that goes on and the king of sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of chedorlaomer and other kings that were with him at the valley of shaveh which is the king's Dale and Melchizedek this this is this is this unexpected king he was he wasn't mentioned before but because Abraham's spirit was right because Abraham did what was right he met Melchizedek look at this and Melchizedek king of Salem was brought a king of Salem brought forth bread and wine this is communion Oh hallelujah you want to know why some people can't take communion it's because they got problems Amen that they haven't been at work out at home glory to God but if you can actually get some of that and have peace with one another have patience with one if you can learn how to work those things that then you'll be free to take communion hallelujah with when Abraham had patience with lots he met Melchizedek and was served communion oh Jesus look at this he says him now can that king of Salem brought forth bread and wine and he was a priest of the Most High God the other thing I want to know about this is that after the battle is over you will receive Communion you know when we get to the other side the first thing that happens when we go to heaven is communion communion happens the first thing you do in heaven is have communion the last thing Jesus did on the earth was do what have communion when the battle is over you will be sir communion when this battle in life is over you'll be served communion so if you don't have it then why not start having it right now if you got to get something fixed get it fixed so you can start partaking and communion look at this he says the priests of the Most High God and He blessed him and said blessed be Abraham I blessed be Abram of the Most High God possessor of heaven and earth now this Melchizedek brother branham tells us he I mean to actually Paul said he was a man without father and without mother a man with our Father and without mother and it's the brother end up saying now this was not Jesus no cancer that was not Jesus because Jesus a man had a father God was his father right and and by earthly standards Mary - because consider his surrogate mother right he say Jesus also died he rose again but this man was without father and was without mother no beginning of days and no ending of days he say this was God himself hallelujah Abraham because he had the right spirit because he had patience with one another patience with his brother lot he meant God himself if you ever want to see God come down in your situation if you ever want to see God come in your circumstance let's have patience one with another your household will change the church will change everything will change when we can learn to have patience one with the other not talking that's fast and snippy and quick that's now that's not Christianity that's how the world do things but we got to learn to have patience one with the other Abraham had began TASIS with lot his brother by having patience he met Melchizedek let's go let's go on and read a little bit further in this look at this verse 19 and he blessed him and blessed be Abraham the Most High God possessor of heaven earth and blessed be the Most High God which hath delivered thine enemies into our hand and when Abraham and when Abram met Melchizedek this King he gave he gave him tithes of all so he gave him a tenth of the spoil everything that he got back in this battle Abraham said I'm giving I'm giving a tenth of this to Melchizedek he says in the King so so tithing has been since Genesis and it's still here today God requires us to do that tithe and offering he says and the king of Sodom said unto Abram give me the persons and take the goods to thyself now he's trying to he's trying to give Abraham this you know all the stuff that you captured you can have all that yourself just give me the people now Abraham responds to Abraham said to the king of Sodom I have lift up my hand unto the Lord the Most High God possessor of heaven and earth that I will not take from a threat even to a shoe latchet and that I will not take anything that is dime lest thou should have say I have made Abram rich what brother branham safe see all wars are fought with the principle all battles are fought with the principle and in Abraham's case his principle was I'm not going to battle to get money I'm going to battle to get my brother and by having the right attitude by having a right approach then he could meet Melchizedek and Melchizedek blessed say you are possessor of heaven and earth go over to God right I mean you pretty much you are you you rule in both realms Abraham you root you rule in the heavens and you're ruling on earth Abraham possessor of heaven and earth hallelujah you don't need nothing to devil got to offer you when you know you the possessor of heaven and earth you don't have to take no shortcuts with the enemy he said no I don't need nothing only only only only only what does the verse verse 24 says save only that which the young men have eaten and the portion of the man which which which went with me inner ESCO and mamrie let them take their portion but the rest of it you can have I don't want this because I want you to I don't want you to think that you blessed me oh my god sometimes we forget who doing the blessing no its glory to God you know we think that you know I could I can give this a good cuz you know cuz your cuz cuz I cannot no lost not you God actually bless you so you could do what you did you understand is God all alone so long learn to give him the glory and give give them the honor don't exhaust yourself let God exhaust you come on church hallelujah Abraham met Melchizedek he'd met male kids that when he was able to have patience for his brother glory to God look at this I want to read a couple quotes here this is out of the message Hebrews chapter 7 my patience with one another he this was a war strategy Abraham had patience with lot and he went out after him now I want to tell you something even after he rescued like you want to know what Locke did lot went right back to Sodom right back to side now you already got him out one time but you know what when Abraham when it was revealed to Abraham by God Himself that I'm going down to destroy so out of myself Abraham began to pray and intercede for lot abraham threw himself in the gap for lots he never asked for a lot specifically he just asked for ten souls hope and lot would be counted in those ten Souls lot and his family oh my that's patience even somebody rebelling against you you can still have patience Church this heart but this is what God is calling us to now this is not something for us just to talk about this something for us to demonstrate let me let me read this quote Hebrews chapter 7 part 1 the Prophet says this now if you notice Abraham said I'll not take a take take from a threat - shoe latch he didn't fight the war to make a lot of money and real true battles it says real true real true battles are not made with selfish motives wars are not fought for money this paragraph 75 I believe just go right right on down to paragraph 75 I'm sorry he says real true battles are not not made with selfish motives he says wars are not fought for money wars are fought for motives for principles men fight war for principles and when Abraham went out to get lot he didn't go out because he knowed he could whip the Kings and take all their possessions he went out for the principle of saving his brother I want to tell you when you haven't patience one with another the principle is that you go save your brother you're gonna save your sister and any Minister that's thin out under the inspiration of the king of heaven will not go for money neither will he go to make big churches neither will they go to inspire denominations I like that statement so you can be called to the Ministry but if you're using your ministry to actually try to get bigger than denomination you got a question your call can I say that again you can be called to the ministry but if you are using your ministry to try to inspire a denomination something is wrong with your call you know the only reason I'm gonna go into the denomination of church to preach I'm going for my brother I know everybody that church they gonna come out but I'm going for one where it's locked in the midst of this group right I want to bring him out hallelujah amen there's somebody down there that might not have heard truth so I'm looking for that but destinated see I'm not here for everybody else so I don't get tangled up in that but but some again get so wrapped up they trying to inspire in the denomination hallelujah trust me my friend you can't compete you can't compete with the denomination of preachers the one thing I'll tell you about a message Church they're gonna come with a different angle so they're gonna bring angles that they ain't seen before but when it comes to entertaining you can't touch it this is a gospel that does not entertain hallelujah that we don't practice grabbing our ears and trying to hum and I know we just want to get the truth to people the Bible say you make they'll know the truth and the truth are make them free so I'm ever going to denominational church to preach which I have been invited to many and any time I go to preach I'm there for one purpose to bring my fallen brother hallelujah let's go on a little further he says any Minister sent sent out under the inspiration of the king of heaven will not go for money neither will he go to make up make big churches neither will he go to inspire denominations he'll only go for one principle and that is to bring back his fallen brother whether he gets a dime in the offering or whether he doesn't it won't make a bit of difference to him and I say real Wars our fault and ways for principles and not money let me you know let me just tell you another thing because sometimes you know you go to churches you get invited you go preach and I remember this happening us we went to church and preach and and man we you know we had a good time and I saw the the minister do something he told the church after after I preached to say let's raise our offering for this minister did me do a wonderful job tonight let's raise our offering for and he raised the raiser offering out and I saw the church just putting in name money you know Saints for my church just I'm just looking at them putting the name money I think they put more in that offering to me praise the Lord I'm just messing with you I'm just messing with you but-but-but-but I saw him do it and after I saw him do it I went to the back room man this preacher just told everybody out there that we've taken an offering for the man that just preached and when I get to the backroom he say what I owe you you want to know what I said nothing you don't owe me nothing you sure no you don't owe me nothing you could use you could have that you can use it for your church there's no problem you can use it you don't owe me nothing so guess what happened when he invited me back the next time I did not go hey man I'm not gonna let the people be taking advantage of glory to God right Amen so you got to be able to count on you know navigate some of this but I won't let my church be taking advantage of like that glory to God what I owe you what you told in them let me keep on reading as I say real wars are fought in ways for principles and not for money and men and women who join church and coming to church to be popular because joke because the Joneses belong there or they change their church from a little church to a big church doing it for selfish motive and the right principle is not behind it you should be willing to stand at the battle front I'm going on I got some more to read in this Tabernacle here when things go wrong and you mean and you women will run and go over somewhere else or lay out what that mean what that lay out me and stay home don't come the church have to have people call and see where you act you laying out before you know you're on the beach on Sunday right you just laying out glory to God you say laying out laying out till the little fuss or the students over I've seen people do that and when they start laying out they actually don't make it back that's why you just stay hang in there stay with it be patient one with the other it says lay out to the little fusses of fusses twos over there's something wrong with your experience right we have a custom here we have a order here the church has an order y'all understand it right there's an order here the church is based upon the principles of Bible oh I love this a man a man a man a man I'm just I'm although there's that the church has an order these brothers not just sitting in these chairs and on these posts just to be standing there they have order you know amen well if they if they direct you to a seat that's the seat useful to go to you don't fuss and fight with them they they're there for a purpose we have a deacon in a church he's the policeman of the church he's the one that sets an order in the church hey man you don't raise up against the deacon no you humble yourself down the deep the Deacon sent were okay alright praise the Lord and it's his job as not only his job you voted him in you voted a man he's your begin right so your deacon has a responsibility my God my God my God oh Jesus don't get me going in these places law somebody called me to his brother Troy the only one I said yeah he's our deacon and that's that's his job hey so you know we're brothers lads approach people people might feel like he don't love me know he loved you and he loved God too maybe he's just trying to keep the thing right and as the deacon he's the only one with that responsibility nobody else should be trying to correct nobody hello see there come from the Deacon from the pastor can I can I say that again it's either gonna come from the Deacon underpasses nobody else should be doing that that's not your job everybody got to stand in a lane there's an order to this there's order to it the Church of run smooth is everybody doing what they supposed to do is that all right now all right all right all right I'm taught I haven't patients one with another amen glory to God hey man all right I'm still reading we have a custom here we have an order here this church is based upon the principles of the Bible if there's somebody here not doing right and you think they're not you go to him and talk to him if you can't reconcile him then take some brother with you one or two more if he won't be reconciled then then tell it to the church and the church will dismiss him have no more fellowship with him and Jesus said whatever you lose so nerves our loosed in heaven that's the reason you have so much troubles because you don't follow the Bible principles if somebody in the church is causing a disturbance or something wrong it's not your duty to go talk about that man or that woman it's your duty to go to that man or woman and tell him his era and if he won't hear you take some other one with you he won't hear that then the church loses him jesus said what you loose on earth are loosed in heaven what you brought honor of our bond in heaven that's the power of the church now don't get the profit wrong just because you go to them and then you take somebody that's true and then you either come to me you come to brother Troy say this is what we did now just loosen I have somebody actually tell me we're gonna just put people out of church I said I don't I don't I don't know if I ever read that in Scripture what Jesus got rich well if they don't show love the way that the Bible show loved you just kick him out of the church I said what about Judas what about Judas he was there all the way to two feet washing he was doing the church say he'll leave on his own you ain't gotta kick him out so you and I just I just I just want to stay in your lane the pastor know what he doing God lead the pastor I'm kicking nobody out I said yeah not now we won't tolerate sin here you running through the church doing all kind of stuff no no no no no no no you can't get control over that there will be something dumped right amen we won't tolerate sin not here I can tell you this much I don't know why I'm just oh wait I got it I got more to read I'm not I'm not done yet I got a few more things I want to read but but I want to just tell you for 17 years God has blessed this church to keep sin out we have done things where we have not had a bad name associated with us for 17 years now I want to tell this especially to the next generation you all better raise the bar higher y'all better raise the bar higher in order to keep the devil out we didn't do things to put ourselves in position for the devil to get in hallelujah right we didn't make decisions or players where the devil might get in hallelujah I always got my out of the devil right hey man you know you know I was just I'll just you know just just things that happen look how do I say this you know I'm a merit man prays a lot and when I go places and I'm hanging out it's one thing to have my family standing with me but it's another thing to have all the other Saints stand with me it's another thing to let other sisters and other brothers that is an opportunity for the devil to get in and now it might not happen immediately but a seed can be sown ojala line don't tell me about it I seen it happen people tipping that night to the bathroom you not that sleep just just just you know you see cow disease and the person next to you don't tip that you really never even film get up this how we keep the devil out with I made a lot of stuff I'd be saying no to I got a reason I might not explain it to everybody but I know the key I know how to keep the devil out for 17 years he has not been able given victory but that's why I thank God for a deacon cuz I'm just tell y'all I'm letting out listen if we got an order here so if brother Troy come to you about something he coming on my behalf he coming on my behalf and God's behalf so as with any other deacons that we were having this church that's just that's what I'm expecting I'm looking for deacons that's gonna keep sin out now somebody allowing sin to get in well you know brother Jack he oh he don't know no better praise the Lord I'm gonna letting you know right now I've been able to keep we've been able to keep saying I by the grace of God all these years with no no no no no no funny stuff attached some churches go through all kind of crazy things and now I and I know as a church we going through some stuff we going through some stuff we don't make it through a man we gonna make it through praise the Lord y'all gonna give us wisdom we're gonna get right through it amen we're gonna get right through it but sin is not welcome here sin is not welcome here and brother branham said I want to be in a church with sin can not hide we we don't glorify sitting either I want you to read between the lines we do not glorify Zinn wrong is wrong and right is right so some folk might be upset with me but you're gonna have to get over it I ain't glorifying sin well you just put your category and now if it's sin it won't be glorified I understand all right that way you know everybody clear hallelujah got to do things right if you want God to bless it all right hey man now I could go deeper but I'm trusting you reading between the lines if you can't read between the lines don't worry I got an office I can talk to you about it but I don't glorify seeing a man a man I had to tell that to the brother recently uh-uh I can't come I don't glorify seeing i'ma keep readin that oh yeah I don't know why I'm all over the place like this a day but I'm s God knows God knows what needs to be said we have patience with each other alright there's just two more things that I want to read here and oh my yes let's see here okay this is out of the message who is this Melchizedek again talking about Melchizedek I'm going to paragraph 95 and this and then the last quote that I will read a man today is gonna be standing in the gap so who is this Mecca he says now the true revelation of Melchizedek comes into view what he was God the word he was God the word before he became flesh I'm a paragraph 95 says he was he was God the word before he became flesh what he got the word cause he had to be no one else could be a mortal like him see I had fathered mother you did - Jesus had father and mother but this man had no father or had no mother Jesus had a time he started this man didn't Jesus gave his life this man couldn't because he was life and it's the self-same man all the time our hope God reveals it to you the self same person all the time notices title king of righteousness now Hebrews 7 - king of righteousness and king of peace he is two kings now watch Hebrews 7 - king of righteousness also the king of peace he is two kings there now since he has come in the flesh and received his body up in revelations 21 16 he is called the king of kings he is all three of them together see King got King theophany King Jesus he is the king of kings it's men just like soul body and spirit all comes to make one also he is the father which was the first son and holy ghost of spirit king of righteousness the spirit attribute theophany king of peace theophany and in flesh he was king of kings same person so brother Branham is just trying to get us to see Melchizedek that that Abraham meant a man after he fought the battle with the right principles - having patience with with his brother lot abraham met Melchizedek which was God in the flesh I want to tell you something we can have patience one with the other we'll meet God amen in our midst we will see God in our midst Melchizedek which was God Himself that came down and serve communion to Abraham this last quote that I want to read standing in the gap very very important a man thought here Moses stood in the gap for the people that rebelled against him Abraham stood in the gap for people that rebelled against him Jesus stood in the gap for people that rebelled against him will also be asked to stand in the gap for people that rebelled against us here he says now here in Louisville Kentucky not long ago a minister was talking that there was a young lady she waited she waited a little long in life to be married now I want y'all to look at this quote with the prophecy she waited a little long in life to be married somewhere around 2530 years old hallelujah it says she was fine staunch Christian girl and there was a certain man in Louisville that wasn't that mean he wasn't a Christian he hadn't lived such a good life he had run two dances in road houses and so forth but one day he found a pardon for sin and they become a real Christian real staunch Christian about a year later he fell in love with this young lady when the young lady Matt Lee fell in love with him and they were married and after they lived together a man after they lived together about two years they said they said that this young lady said her husband one day said dear I suppose that's kind of hard for you just a new Christian said I've been a Christian since a little girl but said for you a young Christian to have to stand all the wiles and temptations that goes with it after you've sinned so long he said well it does become a battle he's a confessing to his wife it does become a battle she said I want you to remember one thing that if the enemy does upset you somewhere and you fall and you go back into sin don't stay away from home see she's having patience with with a husband she realized that she's been a Christian for years and now he's just new to this walk and he might be struggling some time and the devil might trip you up but but don't stay away from home hallelujah the devil might come after and get you here and get to there but whatever you do don't don't stay away from home come always come back home look he says he says I wall to come on home said you're gonna find at home the same wife that you married glory to God he says and I'll help you to pray back and pray through and get back to God again can we have that kind of patience with one another right I don't help you to pray back and pray through and get back to God against it I don't want you to stay away said look I married you upon the basis not of what you were but I married you because I loved you and he and she said no matter what you do I still love you I married you because I love you but if if our marriages can get to that spot I married you because I loved you not because of what you could bring to the table hmm I mean I I mean you know I got to looking at some things I saw you had this you had that you can bring some things to the table what if they lose them thanks you you cut your bill you know a man what what's that you know it used to have the old sin you know you give the dimensions for the woman and all this kind of stuff and you know and you know she had certain certain dimensions I married you for them dimensions well dimensions will change are you still gonna be enough well I would love you just lose some of that weight look at you see that's not having patience one with the other nice I love you no matter what a man I don't matter I love you I love you I married you because I loved you not because of benefits I married you because I loved you if your marriage is not built on that foundation it won't last I'm gonna finish this this this this this this this wife that's having patience with her husband if you make a mistake don't stay out there come back home I'm gonna be right here you're gonna find the same wife that you that was here all alone think about this the next paragraph says in a man that day went to work and was hurt repeating it in the place where he was working so now he's telling people what his wife told him not taking advantage of it but he's touched by what she said he said now how could a man do anything wrong against some something like that when a woman that loves him so much that no matter what he did was willing to come back and take her again take him again and try it again see it shows now you multiply that by a billion and then you have some idea what the love of God is see that when a man falls in love with Jesus Christ the things of the world when you think of what he did for you in light of the scripture not in the light of some emotion but in the light of facts what it is then there something happens in you when the new birth comes the sin is dead at Mynt as dead as midnight when as long as the light is in you how can darkness shine it cannot do it that's what God did to one man who throwed itself in the gap that could take the promise and Moses being a type of this Ana type that's why Moses stood in the gap for the people Alleluia Moses could stand the gap for people that were rebelling against him and when we're having patience one with the other we're gonna have to have a man we got to stand in the gap for people that might be Belem against us that's what is calling us to pay ships with each other patience with each other don't allow the devil to get in the midst of this group God has done some mighty things and I miss but don't you let the devil come in amen have patience with each other always think the best about your brother your sister always think the best I'm gonna tell you some of y'all gonna need to open up your house for dinner to invite somebody to your house then maybe you feel a little something toys go out your way now open up your eyes say I want to invite you to dinner and let me tell you something when you have dinner don't sit there and talk about what you feel just talk about the Lord the reason I'm inviting you because you know I've been having this feeling I gotta get this up no just let you die to that you died of that just let aside don't even bring it up well I wasn't gonna go there but since you know die to it don't bring it up amen now I want this to be the first of many of our dinners together praise the Lord somebody if you can't invite him to dinner take them out to dinner amen go over to God but let's let's it mean let's let's love one another more than we ever loved before don't let the devil have any space here a man Church said all right patients one with each other let's pray father God we just thank you for your word thank you Lord that you would challenge our hearts we want to be like Jesus we want to live like Jesus want to walk and talk like Jesus the only way God that we could do things like that is to apply org it may it may skill us down real good you may hurt some time but Laura this is what you have called us to as a people and God we're willing to lay ourselves on the altar father just died to the things Lord that are not like you and just try to express you and all that we do don't let this just be another message but Oh God let it be something then is applied something that has manifested something Lord that is lived your prophet said Oh what jeffersonville needs says thousands of live voices thundering out and sweetness and humility and that's not this Jeffersonville
