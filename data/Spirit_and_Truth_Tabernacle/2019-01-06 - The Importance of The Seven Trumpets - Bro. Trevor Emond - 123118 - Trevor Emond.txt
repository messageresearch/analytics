Oracles in our heart to elevate us and get us closer on to you father to manifest more of your glory in our lives to break a reach in to set us free Lord Jesus Christ the law the coming year will be more of manifestation of Jesus Christ more victories more testimonies of your presence we thank you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen praise be to God let's give the Lord a little clap or friend let's read a little bit from a book of let's take our Bible if you can stand go to Sam's ninety-one the sum of David chapter 91 and we read from verse 1 to 8 some 91 verse 1 to eat he that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty verse 2 I will say of the Lord he is my refuge and my fortress my god in him will I trust surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the Fowler and from the noisome pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust his truth shall be destroyed and I buckler thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by the night nor the arrow that flies by the day no for the pestilence that walk in the darkness no for the destruction that wastes at noonday verse 7 a Thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand at a right hand but it shall not come nigh thee only with the eyes shall behold and see the reward of the wicked amen shall we be seated just a little hesitation and we'll caption it the love of Christ through the law of contrasts amen the love of Jesus Christ or the love of Elohim the love of God through the law of contrast amen if you go to book a look at what we don't have the time but I will give the scripture to you Luke chapter 10 which is the story of the Good Samaritan Luke chapter 10 when you start reading from 30 Jesus talked about a man who was traveling from Jerusalem to Jericho Jerusalem is a type of eternity amen before we drop here we were part of Christ we went a man of God so that is Jerusalem Jeremy is Christ or God Salah means city of peace so before we came here to this sovereign world we were part of Elohim before the foundation of the world amen but now this one has to travel from the mind of Christ or from Elohim to the earth Jericho is the earth is where we have to come and manifest amen before brother Salam put on his flesh he was part of Christ part of Elohim part of grid I am way before the foundation of the world but then for redemption seek he has to come pick on his flesh and be born as a human being so that was a Jenny from Jerusalem to Jericho amen now the Bible Jesus begin to say that this man was caught among thieves who ripped him of his rod raiment amen what was the raiment as we were coming here we're supposed to come by the spoken word but we didn't come by the spoken word we came through the sex line amen which took our our virtues away which made the sinners which made as feeble which gave us limitation but that was not end of the story amen so this one was stripped and the Bible said that he was half naked sorry hop dead and half alive we were sinners born in sin ship in iniquity according to Romans chapter 3 verse 23 for all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God but there was something alive with us amen the City of God was writing you amen so as we know the Eagle story we were dead but there was this good samaritan who was working by the way who is this good samaritan the lord jesus christ himself amen he passed away he passed my way through the weight of your day you could be by the motto brother brother brother brother Jack or brother Trevor or whoever give the word to you that was Jesus Christ passing your way amen now when you had a go message the word for your day it quickly you you begin to take away your amnesia the darkness their sin the limitation of the sex birth to let you know that you are not just a limited human being but you are an ego amen blessed be the name of the Lord you are Christ in manifestation so the Lord took away all your pains all our sins all our infirmities begin to heal our wounds our suffering our limitations our ancestral cases the Lord took all of them are we bind us with his own word with a balm balm of Gilead with the Holy Ghost amen and Allah said that he put us in an inn what is an inn in the audience is an English word to mean a hospital who is the hospital that is the holy ghost amen I think but I gave the scripture oh I don't know yes he gave that scripture and if he says 4:30 recently somewhere near preaching he said that a grave not the Holy Spirit of God which I see this onto our redemption amen so you already redeemed amen don't let the devil tell you that us-sunnah you were redeemed before the foundation of the world and Jesus Christ is manifesting the redemption in our life so he said that the Holy Ghost God changed his ministry Jesus Christ give us the word but any said I'm going I'll not leave you comfortless I'll come back I'll send a comforter he's going to come in another form in the Holy Ghost toward to come and come and take over every situation so after a Redemption God knows that you are still a human being amen you're gonna need jobs you're gonna need healing you're gonna need clothes you're gonna need houses you're gonna need direction from the Lord so the Holy Ghost in you is the director amen so is that whatever you spend on this patient when I come back I'll give it to you so the Holy Ghost is there to take away all our our infirmities our sins our limitations and everything amen because from your Jenny from Jerusalem to Jericho and from Jericho back to Jerusalem is already been paid for amen that is our story the Good Samaritan is you and I who were born in sin who were worthless but before the foundation of the world the Lord for new you amen the web part of him you were Christ amen if you come to the book of Acts chapter chapter 8 remember saw before he became poor he was persecuting the church of God he didn't know who he was but I chapter 9 he was walking on his way to Damascus he made his pillar of fire and a pillar of fire light speaking to a man what a Warner is said Saul Saul why do you persecute me wow that was surprising is the Lord who I who are you because Saul knew that that was Elohim I was Jehovah himself but they didn't know him as Jesus Christ he said I am Jesus Christ whom thou persecute amen so who is Jesus Christ or who was Jesus Christ Jesus Christ with a saint who Saul was persecuting at that time so where is Jesus Christ you and I amen this simile goes they serve eternity they suddenly caught fire by the travel give us was yesterday is that what you come here you bring your little we bring our little leagues of fire we put them together to make a combustion amen so do a lot of lake of fire my little lake of fire when you put it together is Christ a manifestation so saw said Lord who are thou say I am Jesus whom thou persecute so if anyone touched you he touches the apple of God's eye amen because you are modern-day Jesus Christ a manifestation you are God God was all by himself we know the story when he came to subscribe so the Son of man has gone hopelessly he said he wanted to have what a mini member ministry so the Lord went back Hebrew he finished his redemption story look back the flesh into the cosmos but then the same Holy Ghost that was in him begin to work in his church he a man he pour himself came back into his church not only in one person but in many members of the body of Christ amen as you are here in West Palm Beach this body of Christ all over the world prison guard amen the same Holy Ghost in brother Jack is in brother Trevor is my sister's is my brother's a man is the same price because God is infinite he can live in his many member people and manifest his glory amen I'm not going to take too much time you are Christ's manifestation the professor that got seven dimension seven Rams that we live in amen we have got a first second third dimension we've got the space that we see around as human beings we've got the earth your body is earth my body's earth the bright body and the earth the mother earth that is the second dimension and the third dimension is time that we live in we see the seasons we see a summer winter and all kind of seasons we rise up and wake up we look our time we time that is what the dimensions of the human flesh but then we go to a fourth dimension that is called communication science call it a radio waves look at the computers look at a microphone that is free assess dimension God uses it the devil uses it human being uses it amen God uses it to preach his word somebody's in club they're spending and doing stuff like that they are sending souls to heaven through the same fourth dimension then we have the fifth dimension which is what which is hell Satan demons where unbelievers draw people here drunk they don't have peace in their heart the devil is tormenting them but when I've delivered and what being set free amen and we are working with our limitation amen we are working manifests in a Luke chapter 137 for with God nothing is impossible and with you nothing is impossible then we go to the two upper dimensions the six and the Seven dimension that is heaven and Christ Himself which is basically the same thing amen heaven is a new crisis in you amen crisis in you heaviness in you when I sit my brother I see Christ in you when I see my sisters I see Christ in them amen and that is the dimension that shipping our lives or the other dimension is for earthly manifestation but your true identity is the deity of Christ in you the love of Christ true contrasts the law committed sin in your way the Lord parameter some difficulties maybe some somebody's going through some challenges probably you've prayed you've been proved for but you're not see resort it's already been done amen time is no limitation glory hallelujah because you are part of Christ and Christ is in you so Christ know that you can bear you can hold on a little while so he permits some trials it doesn't take it away he wants he wanted to strengthen you he wanted tried to fall to mold you and shape you because what Atena manifestation of Jesus Christ amen and the more we are sensitive to the sixth and seventh dimension and that is our true you a man that is true me because this one has a limitation this one would bring down some D this one can get sick this one can feel discouraged but as Christ in you who has no discouragement one time David David had a battle to fight the Lord prepared him to kill a bear he could rely on and now he has to face a Goliath but before he could face Goliath he has to cross over Saul he also proved to saw that he was you'll be able to face Goliath so he has to give his testimony said so line seven has killed a bear when I had my my father's sheep I got a lion but when it came to Goliath he didn't talk about testimonies of killing bears and lion he chained a battle to his dates amen the virtue of Christ in him the kingdom of God is in you there might be certain challenges that this flesh cannot hold it this first second third dimension can avoid it you are limited but Christ in you has grown no limitation and you have to transfer the battle to the cry see you or to the Christ in your pasta or to the Christ in your sister as for praise amen let somebody speak the word let somebody pray for you let somebody read a Bible for you and I will change a situation amen so when David brother David got before Goliath he said in the name of the Lord of Hosts the lot of Israel whom you defile he is going to slaughter your head amen and we know the story so no matter what you are going through remember that you a deity and the love of Christ is you amen I'm just closing by singing a little song about the love of God amen let there be laughs shared among us let there be love in our hearts me now your love fill this place cause us O Lord to arise give us a fresh understanding and know brotherly love that Israel let there be laughs shared among us let a Bella let there be love shared in your hands let there be love

heavenly la vie so peace love is so real love is so stable let there be love shared among us let there be love even God bless you thank you Jesus the love of God through the law of contrasts brother quickly we appreciate you don't think I have looked at the the story of the Good Samaritan as myself I mean I didn't see myself like that but what a thought Jesus was the Good Samaritan that saw me in trouble my god I left Jerusalem and was on my way to Jericho oh my that's a backslidden state so man that's all right I'm gonna leave that alone i but that's all thank you Jesus you know when I think of how God does things I know that um [Music] brother Quaker was his attending school here he's from from Ghana originally but was is a is a man that has served in our military from Ghana he's he's a veteran it's veteran and thank God for him serving in our military and you know I was living in Texas before he came here to go to school and he was at FAU I'm sorry Palm Beach Atlantic and is that right Palm Beach Atlantic and as he was there you know just going to buy this day-to-day routine didn't know that there was any churches in the area one day I from I understand he went to get something to eat and they didn't have what he wanted so he moved from there to another place and when he got to the other place he saw his sister here in the church and he looked at her and he says I think she I think I think there's something about her now Palm Beach Atlantic everybody go to church you know you know what I'm saying it's a Baptist College everybody go to church it's not not but is there something different by her and he looks at her is but it goes up to understate sister you you go to church so yeah yeah go to church yeah you're faithful yeah what church you go to the spirit and truth tabernacle they may say who's your prophet and she looked she said william branham he said i want to go to church with you where's your church act and and that's how he got here and we didn't know we were praying for help and God sent his brother and he here for four years at least for the educational side for four years if God got Motown for him then praise the Lord we but the one thing I preached it appreciated about brother Quakers that he never came in setting that none of us would have even known this was in him he comes to sit here saying man y'all tried to stick him in the back over there when he came in and I said Victor I'm coming up to the front with a fire but we are just so grateful and I just know that God got so much a storm a man force got been so good to us I was just thinking for a few years ago and we lost my father we lost brother Mike we lost mother Tillman we brother Ho Chi man our church was rocked that that 2015 we were robbed from him becoming to other year to the end of the year but look at what God has done since that time look at what God has done God sent brother Steven God sent brother Jimmy got sent brother Quentin back there we on Wednesday night we finally got the arrival of brother Simba from st. Louis God sent brother quake cool huh don't tell me what he won't do I know what you do he's a good god hey ma'am hey man I'm gonna get out of here I feel good I want the preacher to come and preach let's stand to our feet and a man let's just welcome to brother Trevor tonight to the pulpit amen the song says Word of God speak of God speak pour down like rain washing my eyes to see your Majesty to be still and know [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] see your majesty to be still and know you're in this place please let me stay in your yes Word of God speed amen resting in the holiness as the Word of God comes forth isn't that beautiful because God is holy and God is something we can someone we can rest in oh my my my Word of God speak tonight if you have your Bibles turn to Isaiah chapter 9 I just want to get right into the word and appreciate them musicians appreciate our brothers words and I echo brother Jack you some there are days when you are looking at the Word of God someone is looking at the Word of God and you begin to wonder have you ever even read that scripture before today was one of those days thought I knew that story like I said the other night you know we don't some sometimes there's such power and we leave some things you know we leave John 8 chapter 8 like we read last night we just leave that in Sunday school as a cute little verse but you know we we sometimes leave this this little passage this parable is a as a sunday-school story but it's then we find our life just totally in it oh no so we just recognize there's power in every single line of the Word of God so Isaiah chapter 9 and verse 2 the people that walked in darkness have seen a great light they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death upon them half the light shined if you turn with me to Matthew chapter 4 in verse 16 Matthew writing about Jesus going to the land of Zebulun and Naphtali and these are the the outskirts of Israel and they were the the first place that was attacked was was Zebulun and Naphtali and and that that was the time they're in Isaiah's time were that that was the darkest place and Matthew chapter 4 verse 16 the people which sat in darkness saw a great light and to them which sat in the region and the shadow of death light is sprung up I also want one more scripture Romans chapter 11 and verse 25 in Romans chapter 11 and verse 25 I would not brethren that ye should be ignorant of this mystery lest she should be wise in your own conceits blindness in part is happened unto Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in if we could bow our heads for a word of Prayer Heavenly Father Lord show us your light tonight Lord Jesus show us where we are at Lord God Lord I Lord as I was just praying in the back Lord I'm just a vessel tonight Lord I want nothing more than just to be used by you to speak your words Lord of myself Lord I want to be eloquent I want to be persuasive I want to be passionate but father that's nothing if the Spirit of God isn't here to quicken the word and to open the eyes and the heart the understanding Lord God so father we invite your presence amongst us we know you're here as you've promised in your word but Lord we just want to let you know that you're welcome and that we we adore you father and we are looking for you to come speak to our hearts now may we let go of every inhibition or God and just just bask in the holiness of the Word of God we ask you to the name of Jesus Christ amen so I want to speak to you as you can see here on the significance of the seven trumpets and if these slides end up being a bit too hard to see we may can we kill that right there fantastic I can pretty much preach it up in front here and the light may be a little bit and we'll just we'll get along fine this I don't remember what brother always says that but there's a brother it comes preaches and we're gonna do this and we'll just get along fine so that's the way it's gonna be so the significance in the seven trumpets and you say what brother Trevor the scripture that you read had nothing to do with the seven trumpets but what I want to bring to you tonight is that we could see the great symmetry in the Word of God that we could see how beautiful as I said Sunday morning that this Bible the author of this Bible is Almighty God and he is the greatest author that you know we we were sitting at lunch and we were discussing some different books sister Erica likes to read and we you know we're all we're home schoolers like she was and different things you know we have a lot in common and that we were discussing different books and things like that but you know and different authors that we enjoyed but but God is the great author I mean he is the author of authors and and what he can put in the Word of God you know we could we could read the Word of God for for for years and years and years and never see something in the Word of God now I had planned on saying that all along and then our brother gets up and just manifests the Word of God like that like all over us and there's no other book that can do that that you can read again and again and it actually gets more interesting the more you read it and so there's a great symmetry that God has placed within history and we see in the word where there was a there was a darkness going to come there was a blindness that was going to come in part to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles would come in now so what's that saying is there was a time when the Israelites could see they knew who it was but there was a time that that blindness they were gonna become blind and there was gonna be a time when the Gentiles could now see so we have way of darkness and we have light my I don't I didn't plan that that would met you know mirror what we talked about last night but it sure kind of does so that the Israelites now they are in a period of darkness and there are a period of blindness but while they're there we used to be down here we used to be the ones that blind but now that light has come to us and it's now the time of the Gentiles and so there's now a time when you and I can see but now we listen to the scriptures words and it says until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in so we know there's a time then that that fullness will be over and when that happens we know that light will then return to Israel for a short time we know that we're going to take a rapture and that during that time Jesus is going to be revealing himself to the Brethren a type of Joseph we'll get into that just a little bit but but so what we're going to see is this great symmetry that that while the the Israelites can be in light we can see this beautiful symmetry that God lays in his word and that's what we want to talk about is where are we at today if this is our last service of 2018 and Jesus didn't come in 2018 we've got a little bit of time left but you know for us here in Eastern time zone you know but but we're looking for him then in 2019 aren't we but as we talked about Sunday morning you know we know this event is coming that event came for Mary that event is coming for you and I so how close is it now we we don't have to worry and obsess / well will it be next year will it be no now nineteen hundred and fifty four years - uh you know the square root of two and you know 2019 you know June the ninth you know we don't have to do that but as we talked about Sunday Morris yeah they were Sunday morning you know within those three days the Bible gives us indications of what there will be so that we might know where we're at amen so the significance in the seventh trumpet specifically the Feast of the seven trumpets so we want to look at Leviticus chapter 23 here and Leviticus 23 the Lord spake unto Moses saying speak unto the children of Israel saying in the seventh month in the first day of the month shall you have a sabbath a memorial of blowing of trumpets and holy convocation now you forgive me I'm gonna go through this very rapidly I absolutely need your attention through this entire service or you will be lost and I realize this is probably you know it's after already after everyone's bedtime so this is the probably the worst service for me to ask for everyone's attention through the entire service but here we are so and I'm gonna go really fast so if you're if you if you get lost pretty jarred I don't get it and we'll try to figure it out so I'm gonna I'm gonna go fast so I want I want your attention now into the seventh month in the first day of the month show you have a Sabbath a memorial of a blowing of trumpets and holy convocation oh yeah I'm supposed to be clicking let me do that - is that gonna work nope oh I probably got to turn it off I'm a little it's okay so okay yeah you're gonna have to follow me maybe back there you shall do no servile work therein but you shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord and the Lord spake unto Moses saying also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of atonement it shall it shall be a holy convocation unto you and you shall afflict your souls and offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord now now we've just talked about the Feast of the seven trumpets and we're now going to talk about the the Day of Atonement these we see these things in connection with each other here in the 23rd chapter of Leviticus now it shall be a holy convocation unto you ye shall afflict your souls and offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord verse 28 ye shall do no work in that same day for it is a day of atonement to make an atonement for you before the Lord your God 29 for whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day he shall be cut off from among his people and whatsoever soul it be it be that do with any work in that same day the same soul will I destroy from among his people ye shall do no manner of work it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings it shall be unto you a Sabbath of rest and you shall afflict your souls in the ninth day of the month that even from even unto even shall you celebrate your Sabbath okay so now brother Branham and I'm taking almost all of this from the message Feast of Trumpets and brother Branham what he's he's trying to show us something now if you remember some of the history what he's trying to tell what he's telling us is that he originally he wants to bring the seven trumpets and preach them you know just like he did the church ages are just like he did the seals he wants to take you know first trumpet first you know Monday night and two you know boom boom boom you know all week one a night and just go through this but they're having a hard time getting the place to rent it so they can have the big meeting and nothing seems to work out brother branham's like Lord what's going on here and the Lord tells them oh you this is you don't have to preach this this is to the Jews and that you super naturally I was getting there brother Jack that you super already supernaturally preached them in the sixth seal so brother branham is is trying to you know to make this all happen and that God shows him all of this and so he comes to the tabernacle on a Sunday morning and he preaches in 1/2 hours sermon the Feast of the seven trumpets and and most of us you know we listen to the Feast of the seven trumpets and we we know that brother okay he starts he tells us is to the Jews it's not really to us and then he makes a whole bunch of confusing statements to us and you know we take the tape out of our tape recorders and we put it back on the shelf and we go that was interesting and we never listened to that sermon again because we don't understand it and it's to the Jews anyway now what you see as he's preaching this he tells us there's something significant there so he wants to bring this significance out to us now so he comes and what he does is he takes the Leviticus chapter 16 everybody say Leviticus 16 okay he takes Leviticus 16 which is the first mention of the Day of Atonement and this was after Aaron's sons had offered strange fire he's in and and now he's commanded to go in and this is that you know the Day of Atonement the high priest and the bells and he goes the one day a year he goes beyond the veil into the holiest of Holies to sprinkle the blood upon the altar they aren't supposed to work it's a it's a type it's a symbol that God is that's Jesus Christ is gonna die for you it's not your work and so the let's Leviticus 16 teaches us about what the priest was supposed to do now and then he contrast that with Leviticus 23 here of which we've just read where it places the seven trumpets this is the first mention in the Bible of the Feast of the seven trumpets and he places the Feast of the seven trumpets right in context with this this Day of Atonement and and and we begin to think okay you know when I first read this I think okay here's description of the Day of Atonement and in Leviticus 16 in Leviticus 23 which we've just read everybody say Leviticus 23 because you're staying with me right I'm forgive me I gotta I gotta get you information here that might be slightly boring so stay with me so Leviticus 23 now is the first mention of the Feast of the trumpets and and and he and it places us in context with the Day of Atonement and maybe what we would think is is okay Leviticus 16 describes the feast and Leviticus 23 tells us when it happens and how that all works but brother branham he comes there and he says now Leviticus 16 the killing of the sacrifice Leviticus 23 Day of Atonement you're afflicted you're mourning but did we read about a sacrifice when we read Leviticus 23 no we did not we did not read it we what we did read though was we read that the Feast of Trumpets would happen and then the day of atonement would happen and in that day of atonement you should have flicked your souls you should be sorrowful for what has gone on and what has taken place but there's no killing of a sacrifice in Leviticus 23 but there is in Leviticus 16 you and I don't see anything there but a prophet comes along and he begins to make a distinction there and we can and we begin to we begin to look at that and and like our brother here just did you know we look at scripture oh that's a nice Sunday School story and we go ok this is you know and our brother comes here we go you know did I just become a Christian yesterday and so the prophets doing this kind of thing to us is he's beginning to distinguish the difference here and if we can see if we can sit there and follow his train of thought something very beautiful opens up before our eyes now so you say now brother Trevor you're talking about the significance of the seven trumpets but all we've done here now is talk about the Day of Atonement amen okay that's yeah that's by design so what is the Feast of Trumpets that's gonna make more sense don't worry what is the Feast of Trumpets now next please brother Branham says therefore when the trumpet sounds we see something in the earth today maybe I know ok we see something in the earth today there is a great trouble somewhere and everybody knows it now so the fees are these trumpets what are these trumpets doing these trumpets are denoting that there's trouble in the earth somewhere is there trouble in the earth anywhere today think there spend some trouble in the earth now the hidden brother branham continues the hidden mysteries of Christ was fully revealed in the seven seals it revealed first the seven church ages opened up the ages in place then positionally both with history and with the Bible set them in position how they was and what a reflection what a message from God Himself that these things are the truth he testified it first in his word then by his spirit at the platform and then declared it in the heavens now that you can see the slide here as you notice I'm reading a quote but I've kind of organized the quote and this is directly quoted but first he manifested in his word then by his spirit at the platform and then he declares it in the heavens now he continues on he says there is make no mistake about it at all those seals and ages are perfectly in line perfectly God giving witness by supernatural signs and wonders with the word and history all placed together in the age that we're now living in now this is very important we're going to see this and I'm going to give you a timeline and we're going to drop three things on top of this timeline we are going to first drop in the supernatural signs and wonders and the word and history and we're going to see that these three things are all placed together in the age that we're now living in which H is that let us see in church age okay room in which age is that the latest see in church ages which number the seventh okay that's very nice very nice good job very well done give yourself a hug okay next slide please my brother so I just want to throw this timeline out for you really quick this is the church ages we've got the the dates and everything that's just so you can recognize there's a real date and your your life is you know over here in late Asiya you know you know the church ages I don't want to spend too much time here but but how many church ages do we have here one two three four five six seven and then we have a millennium after a rapture and different things marriage supper tribulation things like that hey men were together right okay so we have seven ages and if you're unfamiliar with this this is revelations chapter 2 in revelations chapter three and and and so we we see now that we're in the seventh age and that God would send us just just as he did to every age he would send a message to an angel for that church and we live in that day of Revelations 314 and that that seventh angel would oh there would also be the voice of the seventh angel there'd be a days of the voice of the seventh angel of Revelations ten seven seventh angel of a seventh church age comes to a seventh angel in Revelations 10 seven and we begin to go oh I see it praise the Lord so all right and then we can kind of throw nextslide my brother to kind of slow this throw the seals overtop first seal second seal third seal fourth seal we won't dive into him too hard but if you've ever studied the seals and tried to throw them on a timeline and then you got to the fifth seal and you go huh how do I do that and there's a sixth seal in the seventh seal and you tried to throw that on the timeline and you go I don't get it it doesn't work for me my head's about to explode go to the end of the fourth seal and brother Branham says now these lasts these now this four seal is open and all of these these things have been happening on earth then tomorrow night we look in heaven at what's going on in heaven for the for the fifth seal so you see the view changes from 1st 2nd 3rd 4th seal these horse riders here on the earth now their souls under the altar now there's there's angels use me and now there's a great silence in heaven where are these things that are in heaven is there time in heaven not like here not like here so when you try to throw 5th 6th and 7th seal on a time line it doesn't work for you just doesn't work so I just saved your brain if you ever start to try to study that because it bothered me for years it drove me nuts I don't get it sister told me brother I just I just I don't understand it I just try to believe that nice that's nice sister I appreciate that but I'm actually gonna study this and try so and if I and if I if I blow a fuse then I'll just believe it anyway but I'm gonna at least try so and I say that you know so we begin to understand if brother Branham and will get into this if brother Branham preaches the the seven trumpets in the sixth seal and that some of that's already happened and we're waiting for the sixth seal to be the Tribulation Period and we and then you'd say like the last church I preached this in there like did brother Trevor say we were in the middle of the Tribulation Period already no that's not what I'm saying but you can't look at the sixth seal in this in the same time elements are there places where to pay impacts time yes but you can't look at it it's already going on we're just waiting on this the rapture waiting on the seventh seal all right so we don't have to worry about these other things now next slide so now I want to add into this I want to come back now to our Leviticus 23 this we call a we love feasts here and I know maybe you can't see it so great but this is 12 months of the year kind of in a circular pattern here the month of Nisan maybe you've heard of that with a month of Adar you probably read about that and Esther that's when Haman wanted to kill everybody and so you know we have six one two or three four or five six we come to the seventh month the in what our scriptures say the first day of the seventh month there be the Feast of Trumpets tenth day of the seventh month I love just being in the slide here it's great tenth day of the seventh month is the Day of Atonement it's so much better than going to see that way up there so so I can just come and bring you right to it so so the the the Feast of Trumpets there we read it begins on the first day of what month seventh month the Day of Atonement begins on the tenth day of the seventh month okay I just we just had to get there so now these are tight right I mean this is what the Old Testament is is there's types to us there in samples these lives were living out and they were going to to become a spiritual reality later on in our age now so we want to go back to our timeline thank you my brother we want to go back to our timeline and we're gonna know the next one sorry I said back but I didn't mean that for you okay so we want to come back to our timeline and we can understand that if it starts in the seventh month what is that a type of we have the first month second month third month fourth month fifth month six months seventh month that's our age this is a type of the Gentile ages that are to come that there would be seven ages now so for second third fourth fifth sixth seventh month so Amen praise Lord now what when did the Feast of Trumpets start first day of the seventh month are we together okay because Leviticus 16 was the killing of the sacrifice Leviticus 23 first day seventh month then a feast of then a feast of atonement tenth day of the seventh month I will have voice enough to finish this sermon so if you can go to the next slide now brother spread them says what is it trumpet for now a trumpet sounds and it says it'sit's a disturbance there's something wrong somewhere but what is it trumpet for a gathering together of the people now brother Branham says now the reason these seven trumpets does not apply to this church in this age is because it's to Israel only it's the calling of the gathering of the people and that's why he's saying look these seven trumpets they don't apply to us Gentiles they apply to the Jews it's a gathering together of the people amen so as we're talking about this this is why he's saying like look I wanted to do this every every night but then God and we just can then sit down to one sermon so brother Jack go to slides please and and we see what his brother branham say about the second trumpet in the message Feast of Trumpets does anybody know and except for the preacher's kid that's not fair you don't know you don't know because that's a trick question hit next please he says oh that that didn't work but that's okay we'll go to that slide he says absolutely nothing about the second the second trumpet and the message the seven trumpets he doesn't he just doesn't do that he doesn't do what he did with the churches and church ages and the seals what cuz that's to the Jews so he doesn't tell us anything about the second trumpet he doesn't tell us about the third trumpet but he says there's one thing significance in here that I want to get to you to get you to or however he says that I want you to get to I'm trying to say what he said yeah okay so let's go back to this we love feasts and when I say back from the jack I mean forward a slide and we get back to this we love feasts now we just heard what a trumpet is for right we have a feast of trumpets and every day there's gonna be a trumpet blown and what does that tres a trumpet blows what is that supposed to be doing gathering people together gathering people together now why should they be gathered together because of a Day of Atonement that's coming and that's why in Leviticus 23 we see them in the proximity to each other is because it's selling us there's got to be a Feast of Trumpets because there's a Day of Atonement that's coming there's got to be something that gathers the Jews together to get them to a place that they need to be for the feast of atonement so you can see that the Feast of Trumpets there is a there's a reason for that that reason is that it's the precursor to the Day of Atonement it's the gathering together now unfortunately as those pants are blown to gather those people together as a trumpet sounds there's great trouble in the earth somewhere and we look at how this happens now so why what is it then as we looked at 16 Leviticus 16 which was the killing of the sacrifice right we're together we're on the same page then we looked at Leviticus 23 no sacrifice just mourn for your sins afflict your souls and it's in proximity to the Day of Atonement so what is that is there there a difference then and we absolutely see in the scripture apps yes there's a difference what was the day of atonement that the reality the manifestation of the type of Liberty Leviticus 16 what was that the killing of the sacrifice this is Leviticus 16 manifested when Jesus died for you on I on the cross but then Leviticus 23 which happens after Leviticus 16 there's no killing of a sacrifice why sacrifice has already been killed remember this is a type these are samples to us God is laying these things down so that we can see and we can go god you're the author of authors and I'm just glad to be a part I'm glad my name was written in the book so then there's a Leviticus 23 Day of Atonement what is that what is that then that that that that feast is the one we're talking about of the Feast of Trumpets the Day of Atonement we're talking about Leviticus 23 what is that day if we go to the next slide my brother Leviticus 23 atonement the mourning for sins Zechariah 12:10 they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one that mourneth for his only son and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn next slide we read Zechariah 13 six one shall say unto thee one to him what are these wounds in nine hands then he shall answer those which I was wounded in the house of my friends what is this day this is the day after the rapture that Jesus comes back to the nation of Israel who were all saved in a day right so what the scripture says they'll be saved in a day so Jesus comes back and they say oh where did you get these wounds since I got them in the house of my friends so it's the day and guess what they're gonna be doing morning morning isn't that what we read can we go can we go back my brother they shall mourn for him as one morning for His only Son isn't that what they're supposed to be in the doing in the Leviticus 23 day of atonement mourning afflicting their souls they've done something wrong so here we are Zechariah 12 and Zechariah 13 Jesus coming back to the nation of Israel and guess what they all got to be there together they all got to be there together for him to show himself to them god only blesses Israel when they're in the land that God promised to Abraham that's why these men say carry my bones don't bury me here bury me in Palestine they need to be in the land and if they're gonna have to be in the land something's got to get them there what is that thing that gets them there the Feast of Trumpets calling the Jews let's go get back into your homeland amen so now we we understand this in type go to brother we understand this in type why why they miss him who was this what is this a type of this is a type of Joseph making himself known to his brethren amen so we I think you're familiar with that we won't stay there very long because we understand that this is the type of Jesus his brothers sell him into slavery Jesus's own brothers the Israelites sell him to die on a cross and then but it was what for the saving of life because Joseph goes he gets a Gentile bride amen praise God that's us Gentile bride Joseph gets a Gentile bride she's now in the palace and then he reveals himself to his brothers who come and repent for what they have done right this is Scripture and type being fulfilled before us and we're a part of this and so we begin to see this then this great unfolding of the Word of God of the author of authors and so when we go to the next slide so that I can remind you there's something significant here that I want you to get to now we're talking about the seven trumpets so really quickly I don't need you to go there but this will be revelations 8 and 9 we want to talk about the first trumpet hit me to the next slide brother Jack and we're gonna go through these next pretty rapidly so what was the first trumpet hail and fire mingled with blood a third part of the trees burnt and the green grass burnt second trumpet we'll read an eight eight nine mountain burning with fire cast into the sea third part of the sea became blood third part of the sea life died third part of the ships destroyed third trumpet burning star fell its name was wormwood it fell in rivers mountains at third part of the waters became wormwood and many men died because of the bitter waters the fourth trumpet of Revelations eight 12 and 13 a third part of the Sun smitten the moon the stars we go to the fifth trumpet starting in Revelations 9 a star fell with key to the bottomless pit locusts came out with hair like women and teeth like lion's tails like scorpions that's a scary thought locusts killed men 5 months they will want to die and power to hurt those that aren't sealed so fifth trumpet sixth trumpet and you say brother chevre what are we doing we're just we're just really quick going through this we can see all of these calamities happening okay that that's what these trumpets are because when a trumpet sounds what is that great trouble in the world somewhere right okay so six trumpet four angels are loosed from the river Euphrates prepared to slay a third part of the men and two hundred thousand thousand horsemen come out of the great river Euphrates and go to make war now seventh trumpet skips over into revelations chapter 11 it finishes sixth trumpet finishes revelations nine the seventh trumpet is over in Revelations 11:15 through 19 great voices in heaven twenty-four elders worship lightnings voices thunderings earthquake and great hail so the next slide have we seen any of these trumpets have we seen the manifestation of any of these things in Revelations 8 9 and 11 have we seen them ask yourself have we seen have you looked outside and seen you know a third of the grass burnt or a third of the sea dead or I mean a third of the Sun Moon stars gone a third of the men dead you'd think we'd hear about that you know newspaper maybe would carry that story a third of the men have died so has that happened has that happened have we seen these things we've seen the sixth trumpet we've seen the four angels loosed from the review fray T's prepared to slay a third part of the men and two hundred thousand thousand horsemen go to slides my brother 6th trumpet we've seen the Holocaust which killed approximately 1/3 of the Jews of the world what were the trumpets - who are they - there were two the Jews when a trumpet sounds what happens great trouble in the world somewhere and when a trumpet sounds of the Feast of Trumpets what's it do what's the purpose of it to gather the Jews together to the homeland so we see in Scripture oh praise God we see in Scripture that there's going to be a six trumpet that's to come where a third of the men are supposed to be killed by these four kings that come out of the review freddie's and 200 thousand thousand horsemen come out and make war and push them back into their homeland so the scripture is telling us about these things and then we can go back in history and we can see hmm there was this thing known as the Holocaust and there was you know somewheres around 18 million Jews around that time and then six million of them died we did read about it in the newspapers amen we have seen the sixth trumpet and and if the six if the trumpets are supposed to be calling the Jews into their homeland for that Day of Atonement which we know is a future date to come and we know it's not too far away and we can understand then we can see wow the sixth trumpet has happens and maybe we didn't even know it and we were sitting here thinking wow revelations eight revelations nine yeah I'm Tribulation Period wait you know that's future all that stuff's gonna happen if we don't recognize sometimes we don't recognize that about 95% of revelations is already fulfilled it's already done we literally are standing on the precipice of history it's about all over now if we can just go to slides so if you remember we we go back now brother Branham said now we're gonna put the the the word supernatural signs and wonders and history in the age that we're now living in now the Feast of Trumpets started on what it is almost midnight yes yes the first day of the seventh month so in my timeline here now I've dropped out six months and we just have the seventh month this is us this is the latest Ian period starting in 1906 1903 1933 is the start of the Holocaust don't believe me you can ask Google sometimes it'll tell you 1941 is the first day sometimes it'll tell you 1933 hey Google when did the Holocaust start there I looked it up for you now so but 1933 was the date that his littler becomes Chancellor of Germany and the the persecutions begin to start for the Jews in 1933 so so you know just as we talked about Joseph's brothers last night they didn't wake up one day and say hey let's kill Joseph you know the Germans didn't wake up and go hey let's throw a bunch of six million Jews into death camps cool great gather them up no but it starts in 1933 as a process okay so if the Holocaust is which just fits in history is is a third of the men dying and so we can see this is very plain is 1933 to 1945 and we know that the Feast of Trumpets starts on the first day of the seventh month and the sixth trumpet started in 1933 and went on the 1945 the end of World War two where are we at in history where are we at in history because there's only seven trumpets that happened before Jesus comes and reveals himself to the Jews so where are we at in history now we can begin to see then as we said there's going to be supernatural signs and wonders which is gonna be here and I haven't thrown those up here yet we're gonna have the word revelations 8 9 which is this which is our six trumpets we're gonna have history so we see history we see a Holocaust we see the word revelations 8 and 9 revelations 9 the end of it is the sixth trumpet am I going too fast anybody confused no good we got visuals so I'm hoping that's helping so next we add on May 7 1946 does anybody know what that date is this is when the Jews become a nation now you could argue with me and say now brother Trevor we know that the UN recognized Israel as a nation in 1948 but I would submit to you what has to happen before the UN recognizes you as a nation you you kind of have to go to the UN and say hey UN we're a nation recognize us and that happens in May 7th 1946 well and then we know that because brother Branham told us so now let's go to the next slide here so Israel becomes a nation we establish that we can go one more so oh my now we begin to see some supernatural signs and wonders happening remember we were gonna have the word we were gonna have history and we would have supernatural signs and wonders all in the age that we're now living in ok that's where we are praise God so 1933 isn't that an interesting date for the start of the Holocaust 1930 you know something happened in 1930 what was that thing that happened in 1933 there was supernatural sign of wonder that's right as brother branham's baptizing this pillar fire comes down this this this this whirlwind comes down and speaks and says this john the baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of christ so will your message for run the second coming of Christ and where you go oh wow maybe that's pretty obvious to us when it really comes right down to it because if we're talking about the seven trumpets that are kinda that are gonna be what calls the Israel so that Jesus the Messiah can come and reveal himself to his brethren you know the second coming of the Messiah you know we would think that hmm you know if the first coming had a forerunner shouldn't the second coming amen so that kind of fits you know that somewheres around the same time that these trumpets are being blown there's a forerunner coming to announce the coming of a messiah Oh glory to God I love it the author of author so then my brother branham's Commission you know may 7th 1946 that was an interesting day cuz that's the same day brother branham's in a cave and we can you know we can we can say okay maybe next slide brother we can maybe we would stop and think what does brother branham's Commission have to do with this why is that on the same exact day that Israel becomes a nation so then we go to the next slide and the next three as we read this quote now to see whether this message we got is connected with it or not the very hour Israel was signed in to be a nation it was the same very same hour very same day very same month everything else I was at greens Mill do not blow up on me thank you I was at greens Mill Indiana when that angel there appeared to me and sent me out in the field with this after he had met me down on the river and told me what would take place then commissioned me 11 years later at the same hour that Israel was signed in a nation it's all connected together so brother Branham here is making a very very very bold statement you see there's only two possibilities here you know because if I came to you and I said you know God gave me a commission the same day Israel became a nation what would you say don't think much of yourself do you brother Trevor right I wait together are we asleep okay you know okay good cuz cuz I this is what I would think you know brother you come to me and say you know brother I was praying in a cave the very same day that that that God that God made his real a nation I'd be like that's nice brother he's praise God that's that's good that's good there's only two possibilities he's either arrogant and prideful or he's true you know it's kind of like God when he says in and and I think it's either mica or Malachi he says I am the great king well that's either arrogance or truth that's that's really the only two options so brother branham's making a very bold statement here and he's saying basically my ministry is connected with the Jews becoming a nation that's a bold statement does he and so let's let's look now that this does he does he have reason to say that now we've already looked at we know that the first coming of Christ had a forerunner in the second coming of Christ should also have a forerunner because God has this beautiful symmetry and so let's let's look then and we just hold that thought and we'll look at these things now let's go back and look at what's going on in the sixth trumpet brother Jack for the next next couple slides here and the sixth angel sounded verse thirteen and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates and the four angels were loosed which were prepared prepared for an hour and a day in a month and a year for to slay the third part of men and the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand and I heard the number of them now there were four angels loosed I don't know where you're at brother but there you go okay there were four angels loosed and to slay a third part of the men now very interesting just just an anecdote and I don't make a doctrine out of this but I just can't I just can't unsee this any Morris you know when brother branham and this is another thing that used to confuse me when I was younger and whose Eichmann you know brother Brown would talk about Hitler Eichmann Mussolini or he'd say Hitler Eichmann Stalin you know it's just like who in the world is Eichmann Adolf Eichmann EEI ch ma NN if you want to look him up in history he is the man who proposed the final solution for the extermination of the Jews and the Wannsee conference in 1941 I believe it was sister Erica's nodding so that must be right so we had we had dictators right because these guys were were these that there's four of them here there's four four kings when we know there was three dictators during the World War two we know there's Stalin that was Mussolini and that was Hitler and it's just so interesting that brother branham always just throws Eichmann in there I don't know I just I just can't unsee that anymore because these four kings come out and then they have an army the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand and these shorter thousand thousand what do they do they go 1/8 they slay a third part of the men to make sense so let's go to the next slide and let's look at our our timeline so we can see this is what's going on we see that Holocaust happening we see that these angels these four these four dictators these four kings have come out and and they've got an army of 200 thousand thousand horsemen and we understand this isn't horseman you know I mean it's two thousand eighteen people you know you don't see two hundred thousand thousand that's two million or whatever number you can come up with however that works out you know but can you imagine seeing two million horsemen you know and by the way if you continue on they they look weird too it's like obviously these aren't men they have tails and different things so why because in Revelations it's word pictures its symbols so we have a symbol here that they're horsemen what are these horsemen they're demons two million demons loosed out of the river euphrates and how do you know it's demons brother Trevor well they killed a third of the men of the earth who do you think is gonna do that shoot him with bullets till the bullets run out pump air into their veins and kill them with gas demons do that demons of the four kings do that that were loosed out of the river Euphrates at the sounding of the sixth trumpet because and guess what when the sixth trumpet sounded that was a great trouble in the earth somewhere and what did that Holocaust do that that Holocaust that was that sounding of the sixth trumpet that was a trumpet blast saying Jews gather together because the day of atonement is coming and suddenly they get the picture they go back to Israel and they become a nation I mean or I'm crazy one of the two but it it it becomes pretty plain doesn't it it's all makes pretty good sense doesn't it now we're talking about brother branham's makes this statement that he combines these two things Israel becoming a nation and his ministry and we said that's a pretty bold statement and why does he get to make that statement and who does he think he is and and and is this really true and and then we're also adding okay we had these demons they were loose two hundred thousand thousand demons they're loose another of Euphrates they kill a third of the men and then it comes the end of the war they become a nation there's still two hundred thousand thousand demons loosed out of the river Euphrates there in the earth but now they're done they're done Holocaust so to speak you know where'd they go what are they doing now you know if there was two million demons in the earth still don't you think they'd be still doing something but the the trumpet done blow today it's over so that they're not killing Jews anymore because it they did what they were supposed to do but did they vanish did they disappear did they get trapped back into the river euphrates no they didn't get trapped back in the river euphrates we're gonna look at just a little bit that river euphrates gonna dry up but we'll get there so brother branham gets to make where we're looking for these demons we're looking for while brother Branham gets to make this statement right here at night about 1946 and wait a second we've got the word and we come to revelations 10 we finish with our six trumpets and we come to revelations 10 and see what happened is John the Revelator you know he was writing about these trumpets and then he saw squirrel over here and he says oh look what happened over here let's write about that and then he comes to the eleventh chapter and he goes oh yeah I was writing about the seven trumpets and I'm gonna finish it up over here is that what you think happened that sounded pretty ridiculous when I said it yep so revelations 8 and 9 finish up the six trumpets and the next thing that happens is revelations 10 then Heather Lord Himself was closed with the cloud because brother branham's commissioned and finished the sixth trumpet finishes and the next thing we see happen in the word the next supernatural sign we see is him coming clothed with a cloud of revelations 10 and verse 1 and we see Oh revelations 10 verse 7 that in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mysteries of God would be finished and it's because of that that I can even preach what I'm talking about right now so in 1963 we see a fulfillment of Revelations 10 in the gap between the sixth and the seventh trumpet see God wrote that in there for a purpose God put a gap between the sixth seal and the seventh seal go to the next slide my brother he puts a gap between the sixth seal on the seventh seal the sixth incentive the sixth seal ends in revelations chapter six the seventh seal starts revelations chapter eight what happens in revelations chapter seven the sealing World War one all kinds of different things there why God holding back the four winds because it's not time yet there's a gap for a reason so we come to a gap between the sixth and seventh seal we see now a gap between the sixth and the seventh trumpet we see a gap between the sixth and the seventh vial and you say brother Trevor where'd the vials come from are you kidding me it's already 2:00 to midnight and now we got to talk about vials really quickly please will that be all right okay because I think this is fascinating so okay so maybe the next slide my brother so we can see now there's a gap we can see now we're living in that gap that that sixth seal has already happened we now exist in time in the gap that is revelations 10 we also can see then all of these things manifest it we see that these these mysteries that were always hid are now revealed to us and so we're we're living in this day it makes sense with the scripture it makes sense in history it makes sense with the supernatural signs and wonders so then we look at a gap between the six to the seventh file and you say okay what are those vials so we want to begin to contrast the gap between the sixth and the seventh trumpet and we want to look at the gap between the sixth and the seventh files now don't forget here networked we're talking what are we talking about what we start with that there's a fullness of the Gentiles coming there's a fullness of the Gentiles coming the juice the juice they had light they could see but then they became blind the Gentiles were blind then they could see but then as history went on there's coming a time of a fullness of a Gentiles there going those Gentiles are going to be blinded again and the Jews are going to receive light amen is that the scripture okay so we look at the next slide brother branham speaking here he says now under the sixth trumpet the Pentecostals reject the Bible the lukewarm not only the Pentecostals all the rest the church world rejects Christ and he has put on the outside where's this come from how does he know this who's preaching revelations three that just hurt it just came to me straight from the throne revelation 3:14 Jesus is on the outside of his own charge knocking say hey I'm out here this makes sense to us it makes sense to us because we understand the fullness of the Gentiles have got to come in it makes sense to us because we understand guess who who was the ones that were blinded in the days of Jesus in the first coming of the Messiah and those Jews where they just kind of out there religiously speaking I mean that were they just like the farthest thing away from the truth ever I mean the Greeks they probably kind of had it right or maybe the Romans and Jupiter and Mars and you know all their gods like they were they were kind of closer right no the Jews were the closest thing to true Christianity to true religion from Jehovah God Himself the Almighty the Jews were the closest thing to that religion and they were the ones who were blinded so in our age in the great symmetry that the author of authors has written down what would we expect and by the way he's pushed out of his own church there in revelations chapter three axis okay these things make sense praise the Lord now the same trumpet same seal rather when it was open to show Jesus on the outside of the church trying to get back in at the same time the trumpet sound for the Jews the Jews recognized the atonement glory how oh my so the Holy Spirit has been bound by these denominational rivers for almost two thousand years but has to be loosed in the evening time by the evening time messenger the Holy Spirit back in the church again Christ himself revealed in human flesh in the evening time he said he promised it so the the Holy Spirit had been bound these demons had been bound but they were what by denominational rivers is what brother Branham says what were these demons bound these two hunters these thousand thousand demons bound what were they bound by you writ Euphrates River show me a river that actually does a good job at binding anything don't forget revelations is a book of symbols that a prophet can come and reveal it to us and show us what these symbols mean so it's not an actual River now so we come back to our timeline very quickly and we're gonna add in a gentile blinding we know that the gentiles before Leviticus 23 can happen before this Day of Atonement can happen the Gentile church will be blind there will be a church that has raptured there will be a remnant a false virgin she's virgin she's clean she's virtuous she's good but she lacks the Holy Ghost but she's going through a tribulation period and during that time Jesus is making himself known Leviticus 23 zechariah 12 Zechariah 13 he's making himself known to his brethren why because the trumpets blew and gathered Israel back to her homeland so we understand that the Gentiles in this time period it's closing right they're gonna be blind before this happens so wait wait wait it's not gonna happen in one day but it's it's coming it's it's in the process so now we can go to the next one and well we'll we just read you know because they'll say us time rich and increased with Goods have need of nothing know us now that they're not the dour wretched miserable poor and blind and they kid so what does the scripture telling us this church is going to become blind the Jews were blinded right before the coming Messiah that Gentiles blinded right before the coming Messiah this is that beautiful I mean you know I'm not saying being blind is beautiful I'm saying that God puts this symmetry in the word and it's an amazing thing so um what did we add here okay now how then like we can go to the next slide brother Jack we can come back here and we can say okay these Gentiles are gonna become blind how how are they blinded now don't forget we talked about two hundred thousand thousand demons pushing Israel back into the homeland killing 1/3 of the Jews and then poof they disappear no they don't just disappear do they they go and do something don't they how are those Gentiles then blinded let's now I want to start looking we're going to look at sixth trumpet we're gonna look at six vial and really quick and I got like ten slides and then we're done okay can everybody together can you hang with me hang with me we'll go super fast okay so verse fourteen say to the six angel which had the trumpet loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates what river Euphrates this is a sixth trumpet revelations nine six trumpet River you're Freddy's go to revelations chapter 16 the sixth vial the six angel poured out his vial upon the great river and the water thereof was dried up that the way of the kings of the East might be prepared so this river that the two hundred thousand thousand demons were loosed out of is now dry and what happens when a river dries up I live real close to the Ohio River and I paid two dollars a day to cross the bridge going that way and two dollars a day to cross a bridge going that way but if that River ever dried up I could cross that River and I would save my four dollars the great river euphrates okay ah sit strumpet back to virtue after nine and thus I saw horses in the vision of them sat on them having breastplates of fire jacinth and brimstone heads of the horses where's my heads of lions and out of their mouths issued fire smoke and brimstone by these three was the third part of the men killed by the fire the smoke and the brimstone which should shoot out of their mouths for the powers in their okay three and mouth right I just keep that in mind three and mouth okay by these three or third part of the men killed the power was in their mouth their tails their tails were like serpents and had heads and with them they do hurt six trumpet oh yeah stay here that's what I was keying on three and the it issued out of their mouths right the fire the smoke the brimstone came out of their mouths these this is what killed them now six file or I'm sorry the gap after the six file revelations chapter 16 we just read verse 12 which was the six file now we were looking at the gap between the sixth and the seventh file revelation 16 verse 13 I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the how many were there three by these three out of these things that issued out of their mouths people were killed right for those demons they just single poof but they're not actually killing Jews anymore but they're still killing spiritually by these three unclean spirits like frogs because we know we know they're gonna be blinded we know Gentiles will be blinded it's indisputable Gentiles will be blinded these three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon the mouth of the Beast out of the mouth of the false prophet now brother Branham tells us what this what this this is what these three unclean spirits are and he tells us it's the Trinity doctrine it's the Trinity doctrine you say no no no wait wait well two hundred thousand thousand demons why are they religious and I ask you again who is the ones that rejected Jesus in his first coming the religious people of the day the ones closest absolutely closest to the truth rejected Jesus in his day and in the days of the Jews right before right as they're becoming blinded so is this going to be different in our day for the Jen's house no it's not going to be different you say now that's that's mean how can you say that these are Christians and things like that and and no I don't like it and then we go to verse 14 and they're spirits of Devil's working miracles which go forth unto the kings of the earth and the whole world to gather them to the Battle of that great day of God Almighty now no no no what's what's the spirit of devil doing working miracles when was the last time and I know none of you have ever gone to a you know a Satanist meeting or you know devil worshipping meeting you know but when you know I just I just sorry I'm just not imagining that you know they're in their dark cave and all of their hoods and however they do their things you know and that they're having a prayer line for miracle staff but their spirits of Devil's working miracles where do you think that's happening at in the religious because the rain falls on the just and the unjust amen so in the religious of the day why why is this happening this is a travesty this is terrible yes absolutely this is terrible I spend my life saying no don't do that don't go into that that Trinitarian doctrine and anything you know I told you on Sunday morning I was like man I wish I could preach about five sermons boy I just love to to take the teaching on Mystery Babylon and you know and I titled the sermon you know I read I read his slaps to Babylon so that you don't have to and I could show you I could let me tell you you don't want to I could show you where does this doctrine come from Nimrod it comes from Nimrod it is astounding to see okay so so I'd love to precept but I can and it's it's already past midnight so I won't switch to those slides next but this is a travesty this is terrible that there are Christian brothers and sisters of ours who are becoming blinded because that Euphrates River has dried up those demons that were once that sounded under the sixth trumpet they're done they're not killing Jews anymore but the river Euphrates dries up because it's dry they don't have to spend four dollars each way to go back and forth they can cross and do ecclesiastical realm and they can come into a religious realm and begin to kill and to blind the Gentiles just like we know is supposed to happen because of Revelations 314 317 and then then we know there's a blinding of the Gentiles and there's a rapture coming and guess what Psalms 27 is the text that brother Branham uses for the rapture and it talks about you know then the day of trouble persecutions why because of what I'm preaching right now because we're saying that the Trinitarian doctrine is is out of the pits of hell it was a three frog doctrine it's it's spirits of Devil's working miracles I wouldn't like it either if I were them we thank God that a prophets message was the same time as those demons they're now done and we thank God that he loosed a prophet and he loosed the Holy Spirit bound by denominational rivers because these guys aren't bound by didn't by the Euphrates River anymore and a prophet can come and he can reveal to us what's going on in our day and our eyes can come open that we're not blinded because the fullness of the Gentiles is coming in the Church of God is going to be blind because the children of Israel were blind so is it now so we had a forerunner then we got a forerunner now and what does he do easy he's he's he's he's saying here he is he's coming get ready now then revelations 11 up there in the top corner we're gonna see that what is that that's that seventh trumpet we're waiting on a seventh seal the Jews are waiting on a seventh trumpet that seventh trumpet blows they're God's coming back he's gonna he's gonna reveal himself to his brother his brother in the juice and when that happens it's already over for the Gentiles the door will already be closed people will go be going and thinking they're still being saved and they're not and that's a scary thing it's terrible and I wish to God it wouldn't be that way but it was that way for the Jews and God's painting a beautiful wonderful picture yes there was something rather significant in this in this trumpets that he was trying to get to us and he was trying to get to us that this the sixth trumpet these demons they killed the Jews and now they're trying to get them into their homeland but now you know these these demons they don't stop being the same thing they were doing right what are they that they're killers and their homeland pushers right didn't know what they're supposed to be doing wasn't it the tender hand of Jehovah I mean you know hey they I mean you know they shouldn't have said his blood be on us and our children you know they shouldn't have said that and then and then so that happens and that's fulfilled back here and we think that's terrible and it is but God he blows the trumpet there's great trouble in the earth somewhere that's pretty much great trouble and what is it doing it's pushing them back into their homeland and that exactly is what happened these demons are homeland pushers they're still killing they're still pushing the Bride of Christ out of denominations into her homeland what is the homeland to the bride of Jesus Christ the message of the hour what is this message of the hour it's revelation 3:14 through the end of the chapter that he would send a seventh angel to the Church of the Laodiceans and that he would have a message that would come he would reveal these things he would reveal the seals he'd reveal all of these things and we can see the word we can see supernatural signs and wonders and we can see history all together in the age that we're now living in and if that doesn't astound you if this doesn't go if this doesn't blow your mind I spent weeks studying this listen to the servants a thousand times okay that's maybe not quite a thousand but this blew my mind but the thing that I get from this is how close are we and just how true the things that we believe are because it makes so much sense amen okay I got two slides left brother Jack - where are we at one more so where are we at how long have we got the Jews are in their homeland the bride is called scripturally everything just exactly what he promised we're ready the hour is here Church its 2019 the hour is here the hour is here you saying brother Trevor Jesus is coming in 2019 don't misunderstand me but the hour of his coming is upon us the six six of the seven trumpets have sounded those things that we thought oh and that's there's so much left in Revelations to be fulfilled no it's not revelation 17 the revealing of the Catholic Church who that who that mother Horace revelations 18 come out of her my people revelations 19 I saw a bride and she's made herself ready what's left Church what's left like five percent it's left to happen how that could we thought there was so many things left to happen but there's so few things left to happen where we at church what hour we at next last slide their seventh church age this is where we are we're in the seventh church age we're in the gap between the sixth and the seventh we're in the gap between the sixth and the seventh seal and we're in the gap between the sixth and the seventh trumpet I hope this has convinced you tonight and I hope that you become concerned this is what I wanted to say to you for 2019 we have every reason to believe that the things that we hold so dear this message is nothing but the truth there's just it's just it can become so plain to you and we can see it just so perfectly on a timeline aren't we blessed blessed people we are I don't care what condition you're in that you could see this as a blessing where are we at how much should we give to him how our how our hearts oughta just say god I don't want to be blind the fullness of the Gentiles is almost here God may my 20:19 yes had a sense of urgency that I recognize your coming is so close Church he's coming we talked about it Sunday morning what happened to Mary was a prophecy that waited for 700 years what what we're looking for is a prophecy that has waited for 2,000 years now but church it is coming it is coming that the wheels of this prophecy but the Branham said they turn slow but sure but I want to tell you Church I believe that they're speeding up I believe that they're speeding up as we get closer there's so little left that the wheels of the track that they're going it's moving it's moving it's moving and where are you gonna find yourself as we said Sunday morning you're either gonna find yourself and it's gonna it's gonna be hey Lord Lord Lord have not I have not I've done this have not I've done that or are you gonna find yourself saying it already in the palace while Jesus is making himself known to his brethren where are you gonna find yourself Church this this this this this author of authors wrote this for you he wrote it for you what will you do with it what will it

this gospel here become don't let it don't you let please don't let it become say say bow to let this gospel we have become come on to you somebody give the Lord a hand to praise [Music] [Applause] you know I thank God for how he makes all of his ministers so different and just the way he uses each one and their special ways and all my years of just being a part of this message I don't think I've heard anybody ever kind of put the seven trumpets together the way I heard it tonight and it made it relevant and I thought it was just very fitting you know the greatest event that was promised in Scripture was the event concerning the second coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and there's a people that will live in the land I believe you know I've been preaching a message pretty much everywhere I go about Peter writing ye are chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation and when you think about those words that Peter wrote you would think Peter being a part of the the first coming of the Lord that he would I wrote the scripture that I am a chosen generation but Peter didn't write it that way he says ye are he's talking to a future people and that's the people that will be living on the earth at the time that Jesus comes the second time and what you saw here tonight were a lot of different signs we saw signposts we saw things you know there are things that we've probably been waiting to happen but didn't realize it already happened you know brother Branham talked to us about the overlap certain things we happen in here but also happening in here so a certain things happening with the Gentiles but also happening with the Jews at the same time we got to catch those things spiritually and I want to tell you I don't know you know we're so close to the coming of the Lord that this might be the last time we have a watch-night service and how fitting would it be for us to see a message tonight concerning that second coming our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ don't go to sleep on this one Church this is serious business everything that brother Trevor was sharing we are seeing with our eyes same way the Jews spiritual people were blinded at the first coming of the Lord Jesus now when the work goes back to the Jews leaves are Gentiles fullness of the Gentiles comes in now we got Gentile people that are blinded but I think God for scripture as Jesus said the Spirit of Lord is upon me and he has anointed me let me read that let me read that Luke 4 look at this and look for verse 16 look at this oh my he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for the Reed and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted my God to preach deliverance to the captives and look at this and a recovering of sight see recovering of sight to blind it means that there might be Gentiles that have gone blind Jesus comes to recover the sight see to recover the sight to the blind and to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord I believe Jesus did that tonight I said I believe Jesus did that tonight don't let it become common to your church this was from God this was from God and i'ma tell you miss many churches there's a lot of shouting jumping and whooping and hollering all that going on tonight but for have no idea how close they are to the coming of the Lord Lord we thank you for what you've done in this place tonight let's give the Lord another hand of praise I want to just read something over here in a second but before I do that Amen I want to wish everybody a Happy New Year and I want you to find somebody who can shake their hand and say Happy New Year to them amen wish them a Happy New Year god bless you god bless your happy new year happy new year happy new year [Music] hallelujah just wish them a Happy New Year brother smiley if you come just greet the church for a quickly Happy New Year Happy New Year Happy New Year praise God [Music] [Music] bless anybody man a man and I know you're probably a little tired but I tell you what that was a real masterpiece tonight that was a real masterpiece you kind of have to study to understand where he was even there but I tell you what just to make things short you know just bringing out a few simple points just to help us to see how late it is the lateness of the hour that we're living in you know people people doing a whole lot of things tonight but they don't realize I like one point he brought out he said you know so much of the Scriptures has already been for you people figure this a lot too got to be done you know when Jesus got ready to go to the cross so much so much scripture with this thing could be wound up for you wake up in the boy but we appreciate the Lord we we appreciate you know the scripture says blessed is your eyes I'm grateful that I can see you tonight aren't you come on give me one little witnessed and I know you're tired let me try that again bless it oh yeah yeah a man is good to be able to see the light a man of skill - just to be able to have the opportunity to be able to come and be in fellowship with you guys tonight I told I said would go with being fellowship I believe I believe it was the leader of a holy spirit the baby to be able to come and then I hit up hit a Word of God you know so often like brother Jack say people be shouting and having a good time I love it I can't shout much but I love to you know simulate a shower but you know when when you when you can hear word like that it just does something for the Soul a lot of people like the deal deal with the you know the flash but you get something that'll touch away down in your soul you know just really cause you to take a real good look at yourself that that makes that makes two different had an opportunity out of here brother Trevor in a while but I tell you what a man I'm really blessed I'm really encouraged and just to continue to press on 2018 was full of challenges but we overcame the church in Okeechobee we still moving forward we still pressing the battle I'm still looking for what God has for Saint man an upcoming year you know when that last predestinated seed coming in and relief eyes this place then we'll get out of here so so we want to be encouraged we appreciate our brother he he was just on the front row the last time we had the opportunity to preach not even knowing he was a minister but we really enjoyed and I guess you know sometime in 2019 maybe we'll put something together and get the bishop over preach for us maybe get our brother to come preach I tell you what brother Troy Troy preached the house down the week did a real real wonderful job I was I was really impressed really really enjoyed them God I put him on my heart for a couple of weeks and we finally got him over and he just got himself out of the way that's what I like I get off this microphone something I don't have but I really appreciate your brother Troy stay on the firing line we try to get you over with some motor in 2019 right like jacked I might be praying for help well God gave him some health and God gave me some help it's difficult when you you know I got I got one brother do that self yeah but it's good you know I can just call up these brothers on the phone you know what I mean I could get out a little bit and stretch my legs knowing that I could make a phone call and you know I got brothers that I stayed true to the Word of God so y'all just continue to pray for us we appreciate you all appreciate my brother Jack just all yonkers god bless you praise the Lord well we want we're not gonna take too much time but I want to just do this one little thing before we go tonight you know 2018 was really a blessed year I mean I just seen God do some miracles supernatural things and in our midst and I believe we want to just read this blessing over the church as you enter into this new year and this is coming from a sermon a revelation chapter four I'll just give you the date if you just put in 60 - twelve thirty one and then put 14 there amen 60 - 12 31 and then 14 I just want to say this a man so how many is glad and happy the Lord spared you through another year anybody happy about that so then here we are coming up to the end of the road and pray that God will forgive us of all our sins and our shortcomings now I want to say this before I start notice this is 1231 amen 1960 says before I start I wish to each one of you all the most successful and blessed full and healthy New Year that I can wish to you god be with you and I love this part may you grow both physically and spiritually and financially and materially and everything that God can bring upon you I pray that he'll do it I speak that over this church tonight aid man I hope you receive it I spoke it last year and I saw God do exactly this he blessed physically he blessed spiritually he blessed financially he blessed materially and and i'ma tell you to god I serve don't go backwards he always go forward a man if you think he did something 20 18 you just wait you ought
