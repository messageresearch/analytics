TRANSCRIPT
========================================
below turn in our Bibles to Revelation chapter 3 tonight we'll begin new a new church age here thus our degen church age and here in Revelation chapter 3 verse 1 through 6 it deals with this particular church age and one thing that we want to again reiterate is these were seven churches that did exist in Asia Minor but they had characteristics and the churches that represented things that would happen in future ages so we're just kind of picking up some of the characteristics and even even when you look at the church ages with some of the characteristics that would be displayed in few changes we could also look at different people in Scripture when we pulled out suffering that woman jezebel she had a certain spirit that was going to be reflected in future ages her daughter a failure certain spirit that was upon her that would be reflected in future ages especially in this time in which we live so as we as we just kind of go through this hopefully God is help us to see the spiritual types that are here and we'll just beast around that here in verse 1 says and unto the Angel of the church I mean onto the Angel of the church in Sardis write these things that he that have the seven spirits of God and the seven stars I know that works that thou have some name that thou Libous and are Dan be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for I have not found that works perfect before God remember therefore how thou has received and heard and old fast and repent if if therefore thou shalt not watch I will come on thee as a thief and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee thou has a few names even in starters which have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me and white for they are worthy he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father and before his angels he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches all right okay again just kind of going back and looking at our little map here we can see the seven churches that were represented here according to Revelation 120 says the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand and the seven golden candlesticks the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the Seven candlesticks which doubt saws are the seven churches and we've gone through Ephesus which is identified as number one there and that map Smyrna Pergamum Thyatira and now we are at the fifth age which is Sardis and you can see what as where where that's relative to the map there the number five on the map and what happened here and brother Branham tells us that this the Tsar degen or the fifth church age lasted from 1520 to 1750 and this is usually called the age of reformation and our history books it was this Aegis spoken of that they call it the age of reformation but something tremendous happened there and I remember just being young and in school and hearing about some of the people that were that lived in his time and when I first heard the story of Martin Luther and what did with his 95 theses by melting to the Catholic Church door that was something in history that just kind of struck a vein with me I really enjoyed hearing about him and you know I didn't I didn't understand why I like hearing so much about him until later on when I began to read the church ages and see how brother branham pulled him out and said that he was a messenger or a star the angel to the age of started so i will get will get further in that little bit later on but but I've always you know this is something we can just go back in history and actually bring the comparison do you know to when we talk about these when we talking about the churches we're not talking something completely outside of you know of things that never happen but these are historic events that were actually timed right into scripture a lot of people when they look at the book of Revelation have no idea that that I mean these first few chapters of Revelation is just talking about the history of the church you know just it's really completely talking about history church where we were where we started from the days of Paul all the way to where we are today you know with with the legacy and churches but this gives us all of our history so that we you know I think it's very important that if you don't learn from history then it's your bound to actually make the same mistakes over and over again so I think it's very important that you know your history not just I mean I mean church history is very important that you know your church history alright let's go a little further here tonight some of the key statements and scriptures that were found in our reading as we open up this section you know I'm talking about the age the messenger the city some of the key statements that were found was brother branham said the fact that this is the age of the first real break with papal rome that actually flourish no doubt khalsa Jezebel profit is to consolidate and emphasize our doctrine of Mary Allah tree now I put an underlined there because this is a very very special age the age of Luther you know this was H because you know before this especially in the dark ages and some of the things that we've talked about and the ages before there was one age where you know they just they put anybody to death that did not agree with their teachings you know they just they just absolutely putting to death and here we find in this age and even the scripture told them that you know just to see if I can just find that scripture here really quick I want to go back to it in revelation to 10 it says fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that you may be tried and you should have tribulation 10 days without faithful unto death and i would give thee a crown of life so way back then and that in that time period underneath the smyrna church age people were dying for their faith they were dying because they believed you know because they were holding on to the truth you know of that day all the way up to this time where we're getting into Sardis church age now we finally see it feel a little reprieve people can actually differ with the Catholic Church and live right so this is um when brother Brandon touch this is the first break with papal rome that's the Catholic Church the first real break with papal rome that actually flourish they didn't die for what they believed had Luther not done what he did and standing against the Catholic Church it would not have opened the door for all the other denominations to come forth it started there with Lutheran and I mean you can just go on down you know the the Baptist episcopalian I mean you just name it all those Protestant you know denominations that came forth from it problem is with all the different denominations but certainly we thank God that there was a freedom people broke free from the Catholic teachings in Catholic hierarchy we thank God for that but when the scripture told us that they had a name that they lived and aren't dead the reason that the scripture says that is because they went right back into the same denominational system might have been different men running it but they had the same system and like I told you off y'all if we can't see that plainly from when you know anyone my age or older you remember when the Baptist and the and the Pentecostals and whoever else that would get together they got a whole bunch of preachers together you always could identify the Catholic priests always right now you can't do that I mean like mother like daughter right the daughters looking just like the mama now because that's what it came from amen it's going to be very few in this hour that's not going to be in a system like that and I can tell you is going to get down to being the Bride of Christ when you think about the persecution that came you know even in the days of it tell you I tell you I was just thinking on this failure went after the king's sons she was not trying to kill anybody else there she just went after the king's sons anybody that was a threat to her position she went after them right and when I think about going up to the king's sons I think about you know it's only don't worry that the brighter price would be the only ones that's persecuted those ones they really come after the excuse me you know as different laws may change whatever that's to come against people that standing for the word of God amen that's what it's really all about and i'ma tell you most churches are going to give in to the pressure but it's going to be a small group that's not going to give you in right and and ask we're going to be found in that little group but thank God the same got that provided for others that didn't give in it's the same God just gonna provide for us in this hour when we don't give in amen brother branham also said this he says as Luther crystallize the doctrine of justification by faith they held two works penance prayers and other unscriptural means so as Luther began to solidify his position with what he was believing challenging them to come back to the word then the Catholic Church began to get deeper and their their works get deeper in their penance their prayers and any other unscriptural means you know and and some of the penance was on I was looking this up people would go to the priest named would confess and then the priests would actually tell them what they would need to do in order to in order for God to forgive them other thing that they've done sometimes there were some really bad things that people do you know only knees crawling and doing all kind of stuff I I was reading something it's not as bad as that as bad as it used to be today I mean there's other maybe it might have to say I follow out in heaven a hundred times or whatever but you know you get different things that the priest would tell you you have to do in order to in order for God to forgive you there's nothing scripture about that at all you know the only thing that the free should be able to say is just repent be baptized the name of Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you will see the gifted old ago so just guide you according to the word but making up things for you to do in order for God to receive you that's not even scriptural not scriptural anyway right so but here's Luther crystallize the doctrine of justification by faith they hell two works penance prayers and other unscriptural means one of the scriptures that was brought out here in this section was revelation 2014 brother Branham was quoting it and and what it was really this scripture says death and hell were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death and any time where we're looking at this you know even even back in the previous age that was the penalty that it made it made a statement here let me just go back and get it I will kill her children with death that was back in Revelation 223 and that was in five tier our kill her children so her children is talking about the denominational churches that came from the Catholic Church I'll kill her children that the end result for denominational teaching is a lake of fire amen the am result for denominational teaching is a lake of fire amen now no matter what they make you feel like right now the end result of all of that is that is the lake of fire that's what's going to happen to it right God does not accept it amen so i would i would advise anybody that's why you heard the prophet just screaming out many times he was the angel revelation 18 that was screaming I come out of her my people right not go into her but come out of her he kept screaming that out and that's why it's so important that you know if we don't get anything else we can't we cannot be going back to the nomination now I'm not saying go visit you know you can't go visit yeah we all might do that but make that your church home I just don't see how you can do it especially with this type of teaching no one with the image though I don't care how to make you feel right I mean you know they say they're the way that you boil a frog is you have to put them in water that is comfortable with first and then you slowly turn up the heat and that's how you kill them and that's exactly what the devil is doing the people make them feel so comfortable oh they just love me they love me more than the people in the message well actually do they love you more than God right I mean you're gonna run into some people they're gonna think I'm they going to people will always disappoint you let me just get that get that to you real quick people will always disappoint you I don't care who they are I don't care what church they go to somebody gonna disappoint you that's why the Bible declares don't put your trust in the armor flesh it'll fail you every time and it's not like people willingly want to disappoint you but it's just human nature they can't help it nobody's perfect like that right so the main thing is that don't put your don't put your confidence and trust in people put your trust and confidence in Christ amen so this that when he's bringing out this death in the hell were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death he's clearly telling us in this age that that's going to be the end result of the this teaching you know denominational teacher is going to lead people right into the tribulation alright this other thing that he said and we're going to get into this little more seibel was the Astarte that Jezebel was priestess to and calls israel istanbul by the licentia strikes that she conducted just turning your Bibles real quickly to first Kings 18 and I won't read all this but I'll give you a little summary and 1st Kings 18 this this particular chapter is where Elijah is challenging the profits of bail but now what what most people tend to miss in this we talked about the 450 prophets of bail but they were also 400 other prophets right and here in chapter 19 where he's telling the God that answered by fire let him be God in first Kings 18 verse 19 he's challenging them but these are the prophets that he's talking about verse 19 says now therefore sending gathered me all Israel into Mount Carmel and the prophets of bail 450 right so these prophecies that were dedicated to serving bail and then it says and the prophets of the groves now those are the prophets those are the prophets that served a star d alright these are the prophets that serve a star T and an Astarte what we're going to find out and this in this star degen age Astarte is also known as seibel all right side belt i should say Cybele side by was the authority that Jezebel was priestess to and cause israel istanbul by the licentious writes that she conducted so when we talk about the 400 prophets of the groves which ate at Jezebel's table and I'm just my gun you know eating at Jezebel's table that means she was taking care of them she was paying them right she she you know whatever they need it they can get it from Jezebel and and and how many preachers today are stuck in denominational churches because desperately getting a paycheck from will not come out want to retire there right knowing that is wrong but when a retired will stay for a year in something that's wrong because that's where they get their paycheck from man it takes faith to leave a system like that and stand on the Word of God allowed God to supply your needs it take faith a man but I tell you what I've never seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread a man God would take care of those that stand for his word god will do it amen but here you know we look at those 400 prophets of the Groves that's who we're talking about here cyber was the Astarte that Jezebel was priestess to and causes Israel verse number by the licentious writes that she conducted all right okay just kind of talking about Sardis the city this was the capital city of ancient Libya the capital city of ancient Lydia the other thing about this is this city was that one time very important commercially it was very important commercially at one time another thing about the city it was said that gold coins were first minted here in the city of Sardis that gold coins came from this and I just find this quite amazing that goal would be found first in the city of Sardis right if that's where their first been too and there's something in this city specially when we're looking at Siple that's a picture of cyber that you're seeing on the screen ciples represented Marianna Catholic Church and guess where gold is found a day in the Catholic Church brother Branham said that we would go to the gold standard and when we go to the gold standard that mean the Catholic Church going to have complete ownership of the way that money flows I you know I'm i'm not i'm not a prophet but i do wonder with a president that has already filed for bankruptcy multiple times what his thinking in any way shape or form be to get connected to the Catholic Church somehow I don't I I just wonder I just wonder so we got a lot to look forward to and and the greatest thing we got to look forward to is a wrap alright man even so come Lord Jesus but look at these types here right here in this city of Sardis gold coins were first minted there in Sardis and and in Sardis let's find a couple other things here there was desolated by earthquakes and plagues and thus it's an uninhabited it's an uninhabited heap of ruins today brother branham tells us and the last thing that he told us the religion of the city was the Emperor worship of the goddess Cybele and again that seibel there in the picture I want to we just want to try to all right I thinkoh the next slide here we're getting to some other things here we want to bring in just some of the spiritual characteristics of of this what what are we trying to get to hear why would the Holy Spirit to Sardis you know as as one of the churches there was something happening in that church that was going to be representative of something that was happening in a future age and I'm just pulling some notes we did him a Sunday School lesson around this a few months ago and brother Trevor in Jeffersonville he's kind of he actually arranged just curriculum and he he had some notes there when he went you know when we were going through he'd had some notes that I just kind of pulled and put inside on this slide but I wanted he just kind of summarized some things from my reading which I thought were very very key statements first the city of Sardis was known for the worship of the female deity by the name of seibel known for the worship of the female deity by the name of seibel at one point seibel and do eous were worshipped together and if I recall correctly delius was her her son all right so here seibel and do is worship together but by and by and the city of Sardis it came to worship seibel alone leaving the worship of do deus out completely so the son was taken out of the picture and now is complete emphasis on the mother well that ought to tell you something right there the minute because Mary is more admired than Jesus this is the spirit that was in that day that's actually not coming out all the way out to today we can see a man another thing here it is brother brother trevor sent why is it important to this age why do we want to know this about Cyrus it's because as time went on the Catholic Church began to focus on the worship of Mary and getting further from worship of Jesus it's more about the worship of Mary than it is about the worship of the Lord Jesus so that's that's what we're seeing ok let's go on brother branham brought out to us and we're going to go back and hit some of these quotes I want to go back because he he called our attention to the program ian age and what happened in the program Ian age now actually I tell you what let's let's pull that up for now i want to i'm going to go to the quotes from this slide slide 7 and not the first quote but the second one I want to start reading and in your church age book page 184 we're going back to the program ian age and we just want to read a couple things from there 184 and I'll start at paragraph 2 hero 184 alright brother branham says here now how was this Trinity express it was expressed by an equilateral triangle even as it expressed in Rome today strange the Hebrews did not have a such a concept now who is right is it is it the Hebrews or the Babylonians in age of the polytheistic idea of three gods and one came out of an image with three heads on one body he is expressed as three intelligence three intelligences and India they found it in their hearts to express him as one God in three forms now that really is good modern-day theology in Japan there is a great buddha with three heads like the one we previously described but the most revealing of all is that which sets forth the Trinitarian concept of God in a triumph form one they have an old man symbolizing God the Father to a circle which in the mystery signified seed which in turn means the Sun and three the wings and tell of a bird of here was the doctrine of Father Son and Holy Ghost three persons in the Godhead a veritable Trinity you can see the same thing in Rome now let me ask once again is it not strange that the devil and his worshippers actually have more truth revealed than the father of faith Abraham and his descendants is it not strange that the worshipers the worshippers of Satan knew more about God and the children of God now that is what modern theologians try to tell us when they talk about a Trinity I like that statement if as a son of God has a daughter of God you know your father right no matter what Trinitarians might try to teach you you know your father's not three he's warrant right and and no matter how many schools people go to and I'll only go to school if they coming out with that revelation something is wrong with it right but we know our God is one and you can't tell me my goddess three because he's my father not yours amen praise the Lord amen came nobody no matter if you if you know your father you know your father nobody can tell you that that he's not right nobody can tell you that hey he man glory to God listen he said is it not strange that the worship of Satan knew more about God and children got now isn't that what modern theologians try to tell us when they talk about a tree just remember this one thing from their own these records are faxed and this is a fact Satan is a liar and the father of lies and whenever he comes with any light it is still a lie he's a murderer and his doctrine of the Trinity has destroyed the multitudes that were destroyed until Jesus comes according to history it did not take long for a change to be made in this concept of a father and the Son and the Holy Ghost Satan took them a step at a time away from the truth the Evolve concept of deity was now one the Eternal Father to the Spirit of God incarnate and a human mother does that make you think three a Divine Son the fruit of that incarnation a woman's seed but the devil is not content he hasn't achieved the seer but yeah yeah okay let me just keep going all right yeah so the devil's not content he hasn't achieved worship of himself yet except in an indirect way so he takes the people away from the true still further through his mysteries he reveals to the people that since the great invisible father God does not concern himself in affairs of men but remain silent relative to them then it follows that he may well be worshiped in silence actually it means to ignore him as much as possible if not altogether this doctrine spread around the world also and right today and India you can see that temples to the Great Creator the silent gar are strikingly few in number it says since it was not necessary to worship the creative father it was only natural that worships one to the mother and child as the objects of adoration in Egypt there was the same combination of mother and son called Isis and Osiris and Indian it was easy and hist whare note the similarity of the names even and Asia it was seibel Cybele and do es in Rome and in Greece at follow suit and in China well imagine the surprise of the Roman Catholic missionaries as they enter china and found there a Madonna and Child with rays of light emanating from the head of the babe the image could well have been exchanged for one in the Vatican except for the difference of certain facial features all right so brother branham is just kind of bringing this out so we'll go back to the slide there he's bringing this out and remember now this kind of started this whole thing of polytheism started at and Babylon right when when they were trying to build the Nimrod was trying to build a tower and everything what his father start teaching was polytheism between many gods not monotheism would be only one God but he began to teach polytheism which was mini gods and and what happened there is when their languages got confounded you know at the Tower of Babel what happened the reason that we get this is ian is flora and you know and or Isis and Osiris the reason that we got all of that is because the people that left the Tower of Babel because of their language is being confounded they went to other areas but as they went to other areas with their new languages they still carry the same teaching and that's how we ended up with all this stuff that looks exactly like the same all right they just got different names but that's what you see is a very similar thing so here in Egypt it was mother the mother and son was Isis and Osiris and India it was it see in its whare in Asia it was Cybele and do es and then brother branham said also you find the same thing in Rome Greece and China you see the same thing so let's go a little further here when we look at delius and and I Bell some of the comparisons that the Prophet brought out to us in our reading do it was the OS was the son dawg and when you look at SG when God again he's trying to take the place of the s om of God right so he was the son got but Cybele she was the moon goddess he was the OS was the lord of heaven but she was the queen of heaven do it was the revealer of goodness and truth and she was the revealer of gentleness and mercy I do it was the mediator and she would be considered the media tricks do is what do is he had the key that opens and shuts the gates of the invisible world and Cybele had an identical keep doing likewise and I'm putting underlining that for a reason we'll go on do it was the judge of the Dead and Cybele was standing at his side the audience have been killed he was killed raised and ascended into heaven and Cybele was carried their bodily by the Sun I brother branham also told us that Rome and Rome this same God has given the title our Lord he is called the Son of God which she is called the mother of god right now I want to just let see I think I want to bring something yeah a couple of quotes here page 244 and your church age book 244 paragraph to in paragraph three let me just let's just get those lined up it's brother branham went through this and bringing that little a comparison to us it made a statement here says now that is what we found back there in the other two ages where the mother son concept took on such tremendous proportions but now notice that even as it was back in Babylon that the worship of the Sun began to lose out in favor of the worship of the mother so she literally began to take the place of the Sun says we see in this age that the pagan worship of Stardust was the worship of the woman it is Cybele alone not 5l and do eous the mother has literally taken the place of the Sun endowed with the merits of Godhead all one needs to do is go go over her various titles in column the lovely attributes accorded Mary by the Roman Church to understand where the religion of this age came from he says two things really struck me with force as I looked into the worship of Cybele what was the fact that she wore key like Jana's which gave her the same authority as Jana's key to heaven and earth and the mysteries now let me just also drop that you know let's bring in the Catholic Church with this you know they were they were known for selling indulgences and I'm going to bring out something that Martin Luther said a little bit later on but suddenly indulgences date that if a person died and the Catholic Church didn't essence it in with the heaven they use a thing purgatory and say the person with the purgatory and say now if you want to get them out of purgatory what you're going to need to come with some money and then we'll pray and we'll get them out of purgatory and didn't they'll get to heaven now there is no scripture in the Bible that says purgatory none whatsoever but people have been given to the catholic church for years over this false revelation right and they had these type of things are in place they kept telling that a lot of people people bought into the lie won't challenge it in any way with scripture right but but they've but this is how to count the church has gotten so rich because it's because of things like this it shows that they had the key right seibel right as a woman the church catholic church as a woman had the key to what happened to people after they left this earth my god at least they think they had a key they've tricked people to feel like they had a key only person got that key is the Lord Jesus Christ a man again he says two things really struck me with force as I looked into this worship of saibo one was the fact that she wore key like jamis which gave her the same authority as Janice key to heaven and earth and the mysteries and the fact that the worshippers whip themselves until blood spurts from their bodies which thing is done right today by the Catholics who feel they're suffering like the Lord now brother branham just told us that these people whip themselves until blood spurted from a body's Cybele was a star d of Ahab's day that's who Jezebel was worshiping Astarte are psycho guess what her priest did when when when when Elijah challenged him and said let the God that answer by fire be god guess what her priest in they cut themselves that was idol worship way back then and I don't care if it's in the name of Christianity it's still idol worship today hey man and you find that same spirit right then the Catholic Church and it's coming right on down into some of the other churches to that same spirit coming right on down and this you know thank God for a profit y'all thank God for profit you know if we didn't know these things we just be going right along with all kind of stuff man we're gonna stay with this work praise God alright let's go back to our slides ok so again why Sardis there's similar spiritual characteristics that we see in Sardis that also exists that we see with the Catholic Church and here the Prophet tell well actually this is a note from brother Trevor game says what we're learning about what we are learning about the worship of silence artist is that this particular characteristic of this city is defining the false Church of the age of Sardis as the men of God began to pull away from the Catholic Church and focus on justification by faith in Jesus Christ the Catholic Church began to focus more on worshipping Mary why because seibel is the same as a starting the Roman Catholic Church is the new Jezebel so we're talking about that in Revelation to suffering that woman jezebel the Roman Catholic Church is the new Jezebel system and who was and who was it who was a digestive and worship seibel but by the name of a starting very important that same spirit that was way back there and Elijah's Dane has made itself I mean as found myself all the way down to this day and guess what they live Joe called out against that spirit in his day the spirit of Elijah called out against that spirit again and this thing my the types are all over it types are all over it the types are all over and thank God I ain't worried about no bridge y'all I'm sorry did I mean it's just just too much be worried by a bridge you know one brother was telling me you know Moses Moses went to the mountain and the bush was on fire and and it didn't burn it wasn't consumed and Moses heard a voice that take off your shoes your own holy ground and Moses took off his shoes and he heard from gardening went back to take deliverance to the children of Israel but the problem is is you can't find that story on google nowhere can't find it yeah you can't find where Moses is that a burning bush and took off his shoes there was the only person with dare was Moses how do we know Moses it's telling the truth how do we know that we can't find it on google you're gonna have to take Moses by faith you're going to take this message by faith I'm gonna tell you if there's if there's a seat of God in your gonna be identified with this word I believe what happened with Moses just like I believe what the prophets in I can't gotta find it on google i still believe a man praise God alright I think I got something here yes there's a couple quotes here that I want to read 244 paragraph four and five I'm start to 45 so here it's the Prophet tells us the fact that this age is the first real break with papal rome that actually flourished no doubt calls a Jezebel prophetess to consolidate consolidate and emphasize of doctrine Mary Allah tree which is the worship of Mary and decided opposition to the Protestants who denied her any part whatsoever in the plan of salvation apart from her fame with God as the Virgin chosen to bear the babe as Luther crystallized the doctrine of justification by faith they held two works penance prayers and other unscriptural means and as the free Christians glorified the Sun the Roman Catholics increased their deification of Mary until the 20th century saw and opposition to the most high rankin Roman theologians pope pius literally exalt married to glorification in a resurrected body that doctrine is absolutely the babylon babylonia sh1 the Sun carrying the mother bodily and to heaven no wonder this fifth age goes right along with the other ages and will do so until it ends in the lake of fire with a and her children are killed in the second death and that's what I was bringing out with a revelation 20 this is the end they did whether it's the Catholic Church and every denomination that came from underneath it the end result of that will be the second death they'll go through tribulation and they'll end up in the second death all right there it is Mary Allah tree the worship of Cybele by the way did you know that psycho was the started at Jezebel was priestess to and calls Israel stumbled by licentious writes that she conducted yes that is who she was in the Bible alright that's going a little further here we'll talk about the messenger here in our Martin Luther was the messenger okay Martin Luther born November 10th 814 83 and died februari 18 1546 this age started in 15-20 and if I recall correctly I think he was about 62 years old when he died about 62 years old so brother Brandon brought up some points about Martin Luther said he was the best known of all the messengers another thing about him is that he he became a priest and was not even saved I found that kind of amazing Martin Luther was preaching the gospel and one even safe guess what job we got the same thing today it's a lot of preachers in the pulpit day not even Christians I was just telling somebody the other day I see you know I don't seem too much I said I can't can't stomach the fact that a man can be called pastor of a church and he's still cursing everybody out and I'm listening to this man cursing everybody out but he's he just got promoted to pastor I'm thinking did y'all even stopped to see if the man was seen first I know you go to church but is he saved is the man of Christian and if he is safe safe from what what did he repent up I mean if dark can cleanse your mouth my we got a week God right mommy weren't the first thing should happen your language to start changing right when God come in your language to start to ain't no way you can keep saying the same stuff you used to say uh no no no no no no right but I'm listening to this band he just boy I mean every word in the book that I'm thinking I should hear that in corporate America not in a church not not inside of a church not somebody that worked for the Lord that's what I can't see but I told people s you know but but you know here martin luthe was doing the same thing he was it was working for the Lord but also I mean not even saved yet not even say we need people to become Christians first before they start trying to do anything God in man Martin Luther preach to just shall live by faith I love this he wrote the 95 thesis and the other thing about Martin Luther he was a reformer not a prophet that's very important for us to understand he was a reformer and not a prophet I do have some quotes that I want to read but a bit but rather than read that right now I'm going to go on to the next slide and then I come back and read will read something about Martin Luther I went and looked at the 95 theses and just try to pull out a few things that he was uh you know that he was he was standing against this man just blessed my heart you know the way that he just he whipped stood you know the Catholic Church just just the way he did it and actually when he Nellie's 95 theses he did in a way he was inviting them to to come and debate with him he want debate over these scriptures he wanted to bait over these over these things and you know all he did wants to just want to talk about it but often I mean many of them just didn't really want to talk about it and ultimately what happens that he got he got kicked out of the church because of his differences I one of the things that first thing that he started I would say when I Lord and Master Jesus Christ said repent he will the entire life of believers to be one of repentance you know it's Jesus that's calling us to repentance right and that's just something we should all constantly be doing we always find ourselves in a mistake where we need to repent but thatthat's Christ that calls us to that not the Catholic Church calling us to it but it's Christ that does that right another thing that he said it says hell purgatory and heaven seem to differ as do despair almost despair and the assurance of safety so he just come to the hell purgatory of having seen the difference asked as to despair almost and the assurance of state do so there is no such thing as purgatory right but the church came up with this stuff and was teaching it to the people he's calling that out right he's calling out thank God for this man he says they they preach only human doctrines who say that as soon as the money clinks into the money chests the soul flies out of purgatory as soon as y'all get that money all of a sudden the person got released in purgatory he calling it like it is it says Christians ought to be taught that the post partners are useful if they do not put their trust in there but altogether harmful if through them they lose their fear of God you put in the church before you put god that's harmful right so he's just he just kind of making it very very clear here as to where he stands and this lat has last last thesis the 95th one was and thus be confident of entering into heaven rather through many tribulations then through the assurance piece right in ax 1422 tells you that you'll go through much tribulation in order to enter into heaven but that's tribulation that God allows to come into your life right it's not but the church forces upon you that's not that's not what this is all about so I mean he just he just never ninety-five theses to the Catholic Church door and because they did that it it started a reformation it open up some doors for other churches to come out you know and thank God for at least that part happening but the reason that they're still des because they went right back in the same organizational system that they came out of let's not finished off we'll read some quotes here regarding Martin Luther from the previous slide this is on page 245 in your church age book alright and the Prophet says the messenger to this age is the best known message of all the ages he was Martin Luther Martin Luther was a brilliant scholar of gentle disposition he was studying to be a lawyer when the lingering illness and death of a dear friend calls him to become serious concerns the spiritual condition of his life he entered the Augustinian convent at the effort in 1505 there he studied philosophy and also the Word of God he lived the life of the severe penance but all the outward acts could not banish his sense of sin instead I've tormented myself to death to make peace with God but I was in darkness and found it not the vikas General of his order stop it's helped him to gain the insight that his salvation would have to be be the experience of an inner work rather than a ritual with this encouragement he further sought God later he became a print priest as yet he was not saved it became an avid and deep student of the wording of the great theological works extent extent he was sought out as a teacher and preacher is depth of knowledge and great sincerity to fulfill a vow he made to himself he went to Rome there he saw the futility of the church's imposed works that were to bring salvation and the Word of God struck home to his heart that just shall live by faith on his return home the evangelical truth of the scripture flooded his mind he was set free from sin and born into the kingdom of God soon after this he was elevated to dr. divinity and commissioned to devote his whole life to the study and faithfully expound and defend the Holy Scripture this he did it with such effect that his heart him and the hearts of those around him were deeply fixed upon the truth of the word the word soon came into open conflict with the abuses of church creeds and doctrines thus when Leo the tenth became become Pope and John Tetzel came to sell indulgences for sin Luther had no choice where the rasa forgives his anti scriptural teaching first he thundered from the pulpit against it and then wrote his famous 90 thesis which on October thirty-first 15 17 18 out to the door of castle church in a short time okay in a short time Germany was ablaze and the Reformation was on now let it be remembered that Martin Luther was not the only one who had protested the Roman Catholic Church he was one he was but one of many others that denied the Pope's their self granite temporal and spiritual power and even amongst the Pope's there were minor temporary reforms yes there were many others who raised issues but in the case of Lutha God's time was right for a definite move that would be the beginning of the restoration of the church to an outpouring of the Holy Ghost at a much later date ray goes on up now Martin Luther himself with a sense of spirit feel Christian he was definitely a man of the word for he not only had a profound passion to study it but to make develop make it available to all an order that all might live by he translated the New Testament and gave it to the people this laborious work he did himself correcting the passage as many as much as 20 times they gathered around him a group of Hebrew scholars amongst whom were Jews and translated the Old Testament let me just see something here yeah let's just keep going this monumental work work of louth is still the work upon which all successful words of Scripture and Germany arrested he was a mighty preaching teacher of the word and insisted especially in his first years of public eminence that the word was the sole criterion thus he was against the works as a means of salvation and baptism as a means of regeneration he taught the mediation he talked the mediation of Christ apart from man as was the original and Pentecostal concept he was a man given too much prayer and had learned that the more work he had to do the more solely he was pressed for time the more of his time he gave to God in prayer in order to ensure satisfactory results he knew what it was to battle with the devil and it is said Satan one day visibly appeared to him and he flung the inkwell at him bidding him go another time to Fernandez came to him to induce him to join with him and banishing all priests and Bibles he deserved the spirit within them and sent them off it is recorded of dr. Martin Luther and sorrows history volume 3 page 406 that he was a prophet evangelist speaker in tongues interpreter and one person and doubt with all nine gifts of the Spirit I mean just just a really really special man here I want to get over here I'm going to skip down to two paragraphs here it says now as the time ok says now is the time went on we find a great change in the way he conducted affairs in which he was involved at first he had been so gentle so fearless so patient and constantly waiting on God to work out the problems but then the VAT that then vast numbers began to come to his banner their purpose was not a truly spiritual and rather they had political motivations they wanted to break the yoke of the Pope they disliked sending money to Rome fanatics rose up soon he was dragged into political affairs and decisions that actually lay outside of the realm of the church except that the church through prayer preaching and conduct might set up a standard to be heated I want to just I want to just interject something here evenin brother bamas ministry fanatics rose up and and there was some fanatics that were actually baptizing brother branham's name they were doing a lot of things you know and brother branham's name and when brother branham actually heard of it he actually went came to the church and announce that i'm coming out to feel because if my ministers producing something like this that makes me Antichrist i'm coming off the field he gave up his ministry and he told her brothers that started this doctrine they say every soul that I'm not able to get to because i'm off to feel God gonna hold it to your account they said God gonna hold you responsible because you started this false doctrine it sent to y'all can repent this I will not be on the field the next date and brothers only needs repenting right but it shows fanaticism follows everything my god what most people india's they don't got their eyes on the fanatics but not on the real believers a man you keep your eyes on the rear believe and if you ain't seen the real believers be a real believer amen saic not you p 1 you'd be the first one and let us all follow you a man stop complaining about everybody else you be the example and man right but but fanaticism follows everything no matter what number you know the sports fanatics they're gonna follow and some peeping going sit down and just enjoy this little sport event but others gonna come out with painted face and all kind of stuff they fanatics cold weather then got no clothes on I mean it these people are lost a mind fanatics follow everything amen some people just don't know how to keep it in the in the middle of the road all right let's go on that's that's what everything church that's even with us even with the word people don't know how to keep it in the middle of the road and and and they're going to lean too far one way or the other and that's what's going to create the problem amen listen fanatics rose up soon he was dragged political affairs and decisions that actually lay outside the room the church except the church through prayer preaching and combat myself a standard to be be heeded these problems the politics mounted until he was forced into an untenable position of mediating between lords and peasants his decisions were so wrong that an uprising took place and thousands were killed he meant well but once he it left let himself be entangled again in the church state gospel he had to reap the whirlwind but for all that god used martin luther let it not be said that his intentions are wrong let it only be said that his judgment film truly if the Lutheran's could get back to his teaching and serve God as his gracious brother served him then the people would surely be a credit and praise to the great god and savior jesus christ and I actually skipped the actuals paragraph for brother Brandon brought out very clearly that because of Martin Luther getting involved in all the political things that's why he would be considered a reformer and not a prophet right my profit knows to stay with the word and stay out outside of all of that you know all the political stuff it's not going anywhere epley I mean even when Jesus was on earth the Jews wanted him to rescue them from their political leader of that David geez like not my kingdom is not of this world yeah I'll miss what I'm here for it wasn't about politics it wasn't about that it was you know it's about spiritual things in them so a prophet will stay away from him to stay with the staff the Lord not stay you know in a political arena there was a quote that was circling around the internet here just recently where brother Brandon made a comment about if he knew who the next president was and could tell people with who that who the next president was going to be before the president before it was even announced they said that would actually not do anything to glorify God if they're all that's gonna do is bring glory to me and God don't do things like that to bring glory to us right he's trying to bring glory to himself so it's no need to even get involved in any of that whatever gonna happen gonna happen right but it's not going to change what God has planned for his bride all right let's go on so next week we will be reading and pages to 48 to 252 and we'll be talking about the salutation and the age of Sardis the salutation during this age praise the Lord all right let's have a word of Prayer or close out for tonight father we are grateful for this time of studying word and God my my sincere desire is that we God would really get a true understanding as to what it is that you've called us to and God and once we understand then we can help others we know Lord Jesus that Satan is just doing so much to try to trick people in sour and it's all because he was he wants to try to get worship he wants it he's trying to bring it to himself and if you can get the people attempted off of you then they can eventually get their attention on him so god help us to keep our eyes solely on you and to see you Father and in the beauty of your revelation except you God would just continue to take us deeper in our study of this ardesia interchange Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen praise well let's prepare for tonight
