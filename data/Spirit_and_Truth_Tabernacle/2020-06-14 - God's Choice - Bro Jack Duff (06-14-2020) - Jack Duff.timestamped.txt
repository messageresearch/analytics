[41:43] brother saw Jay amen today
[41:48] [Music]
[41:50] just quickly I'll just make a few
[41:52] announcements a man and before we would
[41:55] just get started in the word of the Lord
[41:58] today we we want to continue to do what
[42:03] we what we have been doing Amen with our
[42:06] services no service on Friday for right
[42:09] now but Sunday's we'll continue to do
[42:12] our virtual service 9:00
[42:17] and twelve for those that have to watch
[42:19] online but those are able to make it you
[42:22] know your scheduled service say man you
[42:23] can certainly be part of that and also
[42:25] don't forget Wednesday nights I will be
[42:27] here to a divergence service as well
[42:30] don't forget to download the new church
[42:32] app
[42:33] [Music]
[42:34] as we're transitioning there so just go
[42:39] there to your app store and find the
[42:42] church after then look for spirit of
[42:44] tabernacle I also just wanted to just
[42:46] mention amens we just prepared for our
[42:49] time of offering this I'm gonna I guess
[42:54] pandemic or whatever it certainly has
[42:57] generated just a lot of other expenses
[43:02] that the church didn't really anticipate
[43:04] having to undertake and one of those has
[43:07] been we had to buy a new computer just
[43:10] to do streaming and we finally got the
[43:14] computer running to spot the way the
[43:16] reason y'all don't see the other I Pat
[43:18] here is because we have both our
[43:21] Facebook and our periscope stream
[43:25] running through the same computer and so
[43:28] we're doing all that now and there was
[43:32] you know a few brothers stepped up and
[43:35] just we didn't bring that need to the
[43:37] church but a few people just stepped up
[43:39] and just really took on the expense of
[43:41] getting a new computer and and I'm
[43:43] grateful for that but I did just want to
[43:46] mention to the church there's still some
[43:47] more work that needs to be done when it
[43:50] comes to this and one of those things
[43:51] that we we actually had to purchase a
[43:55] new cameras not that's not in place to
[43:58] start yet but we will have it installed
[43:59] probably this week we had the purchased
[44:01] in the camera now our whole thing goal
[44:03] is to try to improve the experience for
[44:05] everybody that's watching online
[44:07] and you know there's a lot of upgrades
[44:10] that we need to do there with the with
[44:12] just a video system and and what we want
[44:16] to do is I wanted everyone if you could
[44:19] we have these envelopes here on our on
[44:23] the table for now so those that are
[44:26] coming into the sanctuary if you don't
[44:27] mind just taking the envelope and just
[44:29] putting something in it we we kind of
[44:32] estimated that our expenses a man for
[44:34] the video would probably cost us roughly
[44:36] $4,000 for everything that we want to do
[44:39] and you know that's our goal to try to
[44:41] raise $4,000 to in order to do two
[44:44] things that we need to do so if you
[44:45] don't mind just taking an envelope and
[44:47] putting something in and helped us
[44:48] towards that goal four thousand dollars
[44:51] we will improve our entire online
[44:52] experience if you're not here in church
[44:54] and you want to help us Amen with that
[44:56] you have two ways that you can give you
[44:59] can give online a man through cash app
[45:02] if you want to sip something say hey
[45:05] this is to help with the video upgrade
[45:07] just you know send us something in there
[45:09] let us know what it's for we'll make
[45:10] sure it goes in the right account you
[45:12] can use cash app with cash sign severe
[45:15] than 50 or you can use
[45:19] PayPal and you can use just give to
[45:22] friend or family member and that's
[45:24] giving at John four to three or gets the
[45:27] email address that you use that should
[45:28] give so we're just thinking God for
[45:31] everything that he has done they man
[45:33] that we believe that whatever he
[45:36] whatever is been presented to us will
[45:38] overcome every challenge that comes our
[45:39] way we're trusting the Lord a man for
[45:42] for every need to be men and when he's
[45:45] done it before so we know he can do it
[45:47] again we have no doubts in our God we
[45:51] got complete confidence to him it may
[45:54] bless us with this keyboard and we did
[46:00] not have to take from our regular
[46:02] expenses or even from my building fund
[46:04] we just stepped up tinned it what we
[46:06] need to do so I want to encourage the
[46:08] church if you can just help us say man
[46:10] again this time I trust that we can get
[46:12] this done and that'll be in day man so
[46:15] for now praise the Lord
[46:17] so unless let's pray amen of our giving
[46:20] amen at this time father we just thank
[46:21] you for the opportunity that we have
[46:27] to worship you even through our giving
[46:30] the Lord how you have proven them
[46:33] provided Lord in so many ways we could
[46:36] never ever repay you for your goodness
[46:39] and for your mercy that you have
[46:41] rendered to us God has we just bring our
[46:45] tithes and offering to the house to the
[46:47] Lord as you told us in your word to do
[46:49] so we actually to a continue to repeat
[46:51] the Devourer for our sake continue Lord
[46:53] to open doors that we can't see continue
[46:56] to providing wings that go beyond
[46:57] expectations or moved by your spirit

[47:02] your people Lord abundantly
[47:04] thank you for their faithfulness Oh God
[47:06] and just exit to give back to them one
[47:08] hundredfold
[47:09] as they get from their hearts in Jesus
[47:11] name we pray a man a man and a man
[47:17] praise the Lord God bless you thank you
[47:18] musicians appreciate you all on today I
[47:23] want to read a man to passage of
[47:28] Scripture if we could just stand to our
[47:31] feet we'll read the word of the Lord on
[47:34] today I am entering back into our
[47:40] journey as we've been talking from the
[47:43] beginning of the year there's a just
[47:47] kind of talking about stepping into the
[47:49] vision and there is just just kind of
[47:54] bringing piece by piece of a particular
[47:56] vision that the angel Lord gave the
[47:58] prophet that the Prophet wrote 1962 is
[48:02] when he shared this vision and and what
[48:06] I'm seeing is a lot of things that the
[48:08] angel told him to write we're seeing the
[48:12] manifestation of that even right before
[48:14] our very eyes 1962 was written and and
[48:17] here you know it's right before so I
[48:19] have been the Lord just placed in my
[48:22] spirit just to kind of keep bringing
[48:23] portions of that vision amen
[48:26] before the church so that we could we
[48:28] could stay in line and step in to what
[48:31] God has for us so I want to read from
[48:34] the book of
[48:35] a man there's only one chapter in the
[48:37] book of Jude and then also I'll read
[48:40] from revelation 18 amen Jude as chapter
[48:46] 1 and which is only one chap and I'm
[48:48] gonna start at verse 11 here in the book
[48:51] of Jude praise the Lord
[48:54] here the scripture states woe unto them
[49:02] man this is a warning the man one to
[49:05] them for they have gone in the way of
[49:09] Cain a man this is a warning that the
[49:14] Holy Spirit is given and this this
[49:16] warning is actually for the time in
[49:19] which we live right now right this is
[49:22] not a scripture for some other day but
[49:25] this is being fulfilled right before our
[49:28] very eyes and if and if we're not
[49:30] careful we'll miss what the Holy Spirit
[49:32] is actually doing in front of us what
[49:35] the Holy Spirit does does not get
[49:37] headlines you understand only what the
[49:41] devil does get headlines but what God is
[49:44] doing does not get headlines only the
[49:47] spiritual people will understand what
[49:49] God is doing so the scripture says woe
[49:52] unto them for they have gone in the way
[49:56] of Cain and ran greedily after the error
[50:00] of Balaam for reward all right and
[50:04] perished in the gainsaying of korah
[50:08] these are spots in your feasts of
[50:12] charity when they feast with you feeding
[50:15] themselves without fear carried about of
[50:19] winds winds trees whose fruit withereth
[50:24] without fruit twice dead plucked up by
[50:29] the roots raging waves of the sea
[50:32] foaming out their own shame wandering
[50:35] stars to whom is reserved the black
[50:40] of Darkness forever amen let's also just
[50:44] read over here in the book of Revelation
[50:47] chapter 18 and verse 4 praise the Lord
[50:53] just one quick verse there in Revelation
[50:56] 18 as we just look at this glory to God
[51:02] revelation 18 and verse 4 it says this
[51:05] it says and I heard another voice from
[51:09] heaven saying come out of her my people
[51:13] that you be not partakers of her sins
[51:16] and that you receive not of her plagues
[51:20] Amen the Lord had a blessing to the
[51:23] reading of his word let's just bow in a
[51:25] word of Prayer a man this morning father
[51:29] we thank you again for the ability to
[51:32] read scripture but we know it takes the
[51:35] Holy Spirit to bring clarity to the
[51:37] things that we read this John just wrote
[51:40] here he heard a voice from heaven saying
[51:43] come out of her my people God may we
[51:45] hear that same voice this morning speak
[51:48] to us so real in your word and help us
[51:51] Lord God to draw closer to you not just
[51:54] those that are here present but those
[51:55] that are streaming a man and streaming
[51:59] the service and watching me the Spirit
[52:01] of God speak to them right where they
[52:02] are and god I just pray that you just do
[52:05] a mighty work in every heart in every
[52:07] life it's in Jesus name that we pray
[52:09] amen and amen god bless you you can be
[52:12] seated and the presence of the Lord
[52:17] praise the Lord I just want to take for
[52:20] a title on this morning simple title
[52:24] God's choice a man God's choice praise
[52:30] the Lord I want to just start by reading
[52:33] a man just a couple statements here from
[52:36] God's prophet the first witness coming
[52:39] out of the message this great warrior
[52:42] David a man this great warrior David as
[52:45] we talk about this subject today God's
[52:48] choice
[52:50] he says this now the men here in the
[52:54] city wants to become religious a man the
[52:59] men here in the city wants to become
[53:02] religious the the first thing he will
[53:05] hunt for is one of the biggest churches
[53:08] he can find in this city so when people
[53:12] trying to draw closer to God that maybe
[53:15] maybe a little tug in their heart they
[53:17] feel like they need to you know they
[53:20] need to you know I need to get into
[53:22] church I need to do something you know
[53:24] because you know I know God is dealing
[53:27] with me I know that and so typically
[53:29] what happens when a man is in that
[53:31] conditional woman's in that condition
[53:32] the first thing they will heart forward
[53:35] it's not going to church the first thing
[53:36] that hunt for is one of the biggest
[53:38] churches he can find in the city with
[53:42] all the crucifix hanging all around and
[53:44] the great stained windows and the plush
[53:47] pews and and everything that's where he
[53:50] thinks he finds God because it's big a
[53:55] man he think he can find God there
[53:58] because it's big and maybe he may be a
[54:02] dignitary maybe the celebrity does go
[54:05] there but that doesn't mean that God's
[54:09] there hallelujah Amen it might be a big
[54:12] church they might have accomplished a
[54:14] lot but it doesn't mean that God is
[54:17] there usually God's choice is a little
[54:23] omission down here on the corner
[54:26] somewhere where they're beating a
[54:28] tambourine clapping their hands
[54:30] sometimes that's where God's acts
[54:35] hallelujah amen if you just go back to
[54:37] Scripture Amen Jesus was not born in a
[54:41] nice plush hospital room a man Jesus was
[54:45] born in
[54:46] and I stable they had to put them in a
[54:48] manger
[54:52] he was born with some small place Jesus
[56:01] amen will be found
[56:03] all right look usually God's choice is a
[56:06] little old mission down here on the
[56:09] corner somewhere where they're beating
[56:10] the tambourine clapping and sometimes
[56:12] that's where God said that's right see
[56:14] by the human side the humanistic spirit
[56:17] they look for that big bright shiny
[56:20] something and jump at everything they
[56:23] see shining amen but all that glitters
[56:26] does not go you can remember that he met
[56:29] him then so he you know he tells us that
[56:32] so everything that shining Amen don't
[56:35] mean God is in it just because some big
[56:37] huge Amen church don't mean that God
[56:40] said they just know how to raise money
[56:44] y'all yes yeah I'm just I'm be honest
[56:47] with you there's an art to it and people
[56:49] study the psychology of people a man so
[56:53] they know how to get your heart string
[56:55] there
[56:56] tell you about great projects that they
[56:58] got going on with their feeding the
[57:00] hungry and they're doing this and they
[57:01] doing that and they show you pictures a
[57:03] man of kids that are starving in Africa
[57:07] hallelujah if you ever go to Africa you
[57:10] will find out that pictures not true
[57:12] right amen
[57:14] glory to God so you know they know how
[57:16] to just count on a pool on your psyche
[57:18] and get money to do the things that they
[57:20] want to do now some of that money does
[57:21] go to the kids but a lot of it go to the
[57:23] bank
[57:24] all right church it's the truth in
[57:26] behind amen
[57:28] but this is just because you see a great
[57:30] grand and all this don't mean God is
[57:32] actually in it hey man one of the one of
[57:35] the churches that got more money than
[57:37] anybody else in the world is the
[57:38] Catholic Church don't mean God is in it
[57:40] a man actually according to Scripture
[57:43] the Catholic Church a man represents the
[57:45] Antichrist according to Scripture
[57:48] praise God so if you look at the God in
[57:52] there you're gonna miss him he's not
[57:54] there all right all right all right
[57:56] let's go on all right let's start this
[57:59] this message a man taking sides with
[58:02] Jesus man the Prophet makes a statement
[58:04] here and says God respects anybody who
[58:10] is sincere I love these statements that
[58:14] is making God respects anybody who is
[58:19] sincere now I'm using that but I also
[58:23] want to just just try to make you it
[58:26] make you see you can't be sincere and
[58:29] you can also be sincerely wrong
[58:33] hallelujah glory God but because you are
[58:37] sincere God respects that they matter
[58:40] that he's obligated I feel to try to
[58:42] bring truth into your past because of
[58:45] your
[58:46] charity you can be absolutely wrong the
[58:50] contest work but because you're sincere
[58:53] he's respecting that and he brings truth
[58:55] into you now God does not force you to
[58:59] accept truth you have to be the one to
[59:03] say yes I agree with that yeah you're a
[59:06] man say I agree with the Word of God God
[59:12] is a gentleman he never forced himself
[59:14] on anybody
[59:16] all right look at this God respects
[59:18] anybody who is sincere Peter said that
[59:22] he perceived that God was no respect of
[59:24] persons all nations calling when on the
[59:28] winner on that House of conveyance when
[59:31] they received the Holy Ghost like they
[59:32] did at the beginning see God is no
[59:34] respecter purses we see a person deeply
[59:39] and sincere he can be sincerely wrong
[59:42] but if he sincerely God will lead him to
[59:45] the light somewhere he will come to it
[59:47] because gosh I don't get it to do that
[59:49] now
[59:50] you know i'ma just share this when Peter
[59:52] went to the house of Cornelius a
[59:55] Canadians was so sincere that God sent
[59:57] an angel to Canisius house tell him go
[1:00:02] send some service down to a certain
[1:00:04] address you're gonna find Peter there
[1:00:06] hallelujah Peter's gonna come and preach
[1:00:09] the gospel to you and and I think the
[1:00:11] questions that you got in your heart
[1:00:13] they gonna be answered by this man Peter
[1:00:15] now you know our angel came to Kinesis
[1:00:18] and told him exactly what to do because
[1:00:21] of it his sincerity he got a visitation
[1:00:24] from an angel hallelujah amen he did
[1:00:28] exactly what the angel said do went down
[1:00:31] there got Peter went to the exact
[1:00:32] address
[1:00:33] they brought Peter forward to him but
[1:00:35] you know where went when Peter showed up
[1:00:37] to the house and all his sincerity he
[1:00:39] still did something wrong he dropped
[1:00:41] down on his knees and began the worship
[1:00:43] Peter hallelujah Peter I just said
[1:00:46] you don't worship me but you worship
[1:00:49] Jesus and I want to tell you this
[1:00:51] morning we're not worshipping nobody
[1:00:53] else but Christ amen we're not down on
[1:01:10] our knees to no other man here glory to
[1:01:12] God glory to God will quote a prophet
[1:01:14] but we're not bound on these sub
[1:01:16] prophets a man just like I can quote
[1:01:18] peel them I can quote Paul I can quote
[1:01:20] our prophets for this thing man alright
[1:01:24] stay with me here it says and we think
[1:01:26] about the coming of the Lord being such
[1:01:28] a great thing in the message no more
[1:01:30] than a Swint
[1:01:31] remember there's a predestinate group to
[1:01:33] be here when the Lord returns it says it
[1:01:37] might not be over a dozen see we don't
[1:01:40] know it might be a hundred it's the
[1:02:37] message sent of God which we believe it
[1:02:40] to be I say amen to that
[1:02:42] now I'm going further I'm going further
[1:02:44] so we talked about God's choice let me
[1:02:46] just give you a couple examples a man
[1:02:49] from the very beginning of time God made
[1:02:54] choices
[1:02:54] God made choices and in a story of Cain
[1:02:58] and Abel God's choice was to accept the
[1:03:03] sacrifice that Abel brought that was
[1:03:06] God's choice and not only that not only
[1:03:09] did he accept it but he told Cain if you
[1:03:12] will give me this the very same thing
[1:03:14] that your brothers given me I will
[1:03:16] accept it the problem is it just was not
[1:03:19] in pain to do what God was asking him to
[1:03:24] do hallelujah and sometimes it's just
[1:03:27] not in people to do what God is asking
[1:03:30] them to do but for the protest nations
[1:03:33] they will hear it and they will believe
[1:03:36] it they will accept it somebody so sure
[1:03:40] from the very beginning of time God's
[1:03:42] choice was a man he wanted the worship
[1:03:45] that Abel was bringing Abel took a
[1:03:48] bleeding bloody lamb and he offered it
[1:03:50] to God where where Cain was offering the
[1:03:53] fruit of the ground the very thing that
[1:03:54] got cursed Cain is bringing us back into
[1:03:57] the presence of God expecting God to
[1:03:59] accept it you just can't give caught
[1:04:01] anything and expect him to accept it God
[1:04:04] tells us what he wants a manner we have
[1:04:08] become God's provider way not our way if
[1:04:11] we want it to be accepted another thing
[1:04:14] from beginning in in Scripture
[1:04:16] God's choice was that Abraham would have
[1:04:20] a promised son through Sarah Sarah thy
[1:04:24] wife shall have a son God's choice was
[1:04:28] Sarah a man but Sarah offered Hagar God
[1:04:33] did not acts rahaga
[1:04:34] God says Sara Sara has some problems in
[1:04:39] her body God's choice with Sara amen not
[1:05:26] hey God God's choice he meant another
[1:05:28] choice Amen that got me was so similar
[1:05:31] prophet to lead the children of Israel
[1:05:35] God God wanted to be let God wanted to
[1:05:37] speak to a property he had sent me on
[1:05:39] the scene and they hadn't had a divorce
[1:05:42] the Lord I've been I mean it hadn't been
[1:05:45] a been around for years for centuries
[1:05:47] they they were they were without without
[1:05:50] having a man that could hear from God so
[1:05:53] finally God sent Samuel the scene and
[1:05:55] Sam is leading the people in and out of
[1:05:57] battle doing all kind of great things
[1:05:58] but the people chose that hey we don't
[1:06:01] want Samuel to lead us I mean we don't
[1:06:03] want God to lead us through a prophet we
[1:06:05] want a king God's choice was through a
[1:06:08] prophet the people's choice was through
[1:06:10] a king and every time the people make
[1:06:12] their choice their choice is always
[1:06:14] different than what God's choice is what
[1:06:18] we want to do today is get ourselves in
[1:06:20] alignment
[1:06:21] whoa what is your choice what is your
[1:06:23] word I want to align myself with what
[1:06:25] the Word of God says Amen I miss you see
[1:06:28] that there's a way that seemeth right
[1:06:30] unto a man but the end thereof are the
[1:06:32] ways to pass we want to
[1:06:35] what God's choice is a man another
[1:06:38] another thing was when Jesus died and a
[1:06:42] man he had itself twelve disciples and
[1:06:45] you know they decided that I'll you know
[1:06:48] do this winning hunk itself a man Judas
[1:06:53] was a chosen disciple Jesus picked them
[1:06:55] up and use them in ministry but he had a
[1:06:58] very specific purpose he had to be the
[1:07:00] one to sell Christ out but after after
[1:07:03] Judas did what he did the disciples said
[1:07:05] we gotta find another amen disciple to
[1:07:08] take Judas place now what they decide to
[1:07:10] do is it's kind of cast Lots in and try
[1:07:13] to find a certain man may pick Matthias
[1:07:15] I believe brother Branham say you can't
[1:07:17] find one scripture by Matthias Amen and
[1:07:20] the rest of the Bible he never did
[1:07:22] nothing
[1:07:23] that was that was man's choice but God's
[1:07:25] choice at that time was go get Paul the
[1:07:29] one that was condemning Christians a man
[1:07:32] the one that was considered go get soul
[1:07:38] of Tarsus he is my choice I have a work
[1:07:42] for him to do glory to God God's trust
[1:07:45] always goes against popular opinion
[1:07:48] God's choice always goes again how the
[1:07:51] people feel and what the people think
[1:07:53] but we must align ourselves with God's
[1:07:56] choice I want to bring out a couple more
[1:08:02] things they meant another choice that
[1:08:05] God made will see chose Moses to lead
[1:08:08] the children of Israel and you know this
[1:08:11] is why we read the scripture here in and
[1:08:16] Jude because you know the people got got
[1:08:19] messed up in and some things here here
[1:08:22] God chose Moses but but what they went
[1:08:25] up to the gainsaying of korah the Bible
[1:08:27] says they went up to the the gainsaying
[1:08:30] of Korah and and I'm going to get a
[1:08:31] little deeper into that in a second but
[1:08:34] but the choice a man was Moses to lead
[1:08:37] the people and Moses being a prophet
[1:08:40] was the one to lead the people to work
[1:08:42] came to the Prophet the Prophet brought
[1:08:44] it to the people praise God and that is
[1:08:47] what was supposed to lead the people
[1:08:48] back in Moses day
[1:08:50] Amen God Himself wanted to come down and
[1:08:52] speak to the people and when he came
[1:08:54] down one time and spoke the people got
[1:08:57] so afraid they say Moses no longer let
[1:09:01] God speak but you speak for God so since
[1:09:04] that time God has been speaking to a
[1:09:07] prophet to his people people say they
[1:09:10] want to hear the voice of God some of us
[1:09:12] can't even handle the voice of God
[1:09:15] i'ma just be honest with you you can't
[1:09:18] even have if God came to you and spoke
[1:09:20] in its first to you directly you
[1:09:22] might not even gave it a handle the
[1:09:24] voice of God one one sister amen
[1:09:27] she was in a meeting brother Brandon was
[1:09:30] praying for some people and he was a
[1:09:32] little weary and tired and and you know
[1:09:35] and and and she just you know where he
[1:09:38] just you know he just kept going kept
[1:09:39] doing what the Lord called me to do
[1:09:41] so this sister was sitting there in the
[1:09:42] meeting and and and and and the angel
[1:09:46] Lord showed up to the sister came while
[1:09:48] she was sitting there in church out
[1:09:49] hallelujah why are you sitting here you
[1:09:52] know you can hear from an angel angel
[1:09:55] could come to you right why are you
[1:09:57] sitting here and speak to you this was
[1:09:59] sitting there in the age of the Lord she
[1:10:01] saw him
[1:10:01] I mean stops all of his speeches and and
[1:10:03] then angel or saying see my servant
[1:10:06] there yes say he's looked he tired and
[1:10:08] weird don't he look pretty bad again so
[1:10:10] he gonna be all right though don't worry
[1:10:12] about he gonna be all right say the
[1:10:13] sisters just heard those few words from
[1:10:15] the ancient was out of her mind for days
[1:10:18] just don't see you you can't handle this
[1:10:26] from just hear from the angel so so so
[1:10:32] the husband call brother Branham up is
[1:10:34] singing oh hey my wife saw angel and I
[1:10:37] was at the meeting and an angel said
[1:10:40] this and he said brother Graham said
[1:10:41] what the angel looked like he look like
[1:10:43] this did a little like that you look
[1:10:44] like so yeah that was him that was him
[1:10:45] say what did he say to you say he said
[1:10:47] you look a little weird and you're going
[1:10:49] through this but you're gonna be alright
[1:10:50] he say that's all I need to hear
[1:10:51] that
[1:10:52] gonna be alright hallelujah I don't care
[1:10:55] where I go through right now what I know
[1:10:56] is I'm gonna be alright hey my body
[1:11:00] might be broke down my Amen I might be
[1:11:02] feeling this this symptom I might be
[1:11:04] feeling that symptom but the angel said
[1:11:06] I'm gonna be alright
[1:11:08] glory to God somehow God gonna bring me
[1:11:12] through this thing I got a promise from
[1:11:14] the aims of the Lord that I'm gonna be
[1:11:16] alright
[1:11:18] say God chose Moses Amen but date didn't
[1:11:22] Cora disputed that God was choosing
[1:11:25] Moses hallelujah and we want to talk a
[1:11:27] little bit about that in a second I want
[1:11:30] to also tell you another choice that God
[1:11:31] made God chose to use William Mariam
[1:11:35] Branham as the fulfillment of Revelation
[1:11:38] 10 and 7 as a fulfillment of Malachi 4
[1:11:42] verse 5 and 6 Amen God chose of the
[1:11:45] ministry and the message of William Mary
[1:11:48] and random to bring a message that will
[1:11:51] forerun the second coming of Christ just
[1:11:54] as God chose John the Baptist to bring a
[1:11:58] message that will forerun the first
[1:12:00] coming of Christ these are God's choices
[1:12:04] blessed be the name of the Lord now
[1:12:06] another thing I want you to know is God
[1:12:08] chose you before the foundation of the
[1:12:11] world is because you are God's choice
[1:12:22] the reason you are streaming this
[1:12:24] service is because you are God's choice
[1:12:30] blessed be the name of the Lord's now
[1:12:33] let me just read a couple things here
[1:12:35] this is going to come out of the message
[1:12:37] Hebrews chapter five and six part one
[1:12:40] the Prophet makes a statement he says so
[1:12:43] in Paul
[1:12:43] I chose Paul man chose Matthias since
[1:12:49] they cast a lot but he never did nothing
[1:12:52] that shows the power
[1:12:54] the church has then to make a choice to
[1:12:57] elect their deacons to send their
[1:12:59] preachers to different places
[1:13:01] that's carnal many times he says let a
[1:13:05] man go where God leads lead them to go I
[1:13:07] like that if the people in a conference
[1:13:10] just say well here's a nice church this
[1:13:12] brother has built up a nice church and
[1:13:14] we have a little pet they'll send a man
[1:13:18] they'll send him over to this church and
[1:13:22] and they don't realize they're killing
[1:13:25] their selves now brother Branham is
[1:13:27] talking about something that happens in
[1:13:28] the denominational system if you've
[1:13:31] never been there you've you've never
[1:13:33] seen this but I've seen it many times so
[1:13:35] you know in the denominational system a
[1:13:37] preacher could go in an established
[1:13:39] church and he's and he does very well
[1:13:42] with the people there that he's preached
[1:13:43] it to and but because he's a part of an
[1:13:46] organization the organization has the
[1:13:49] right to come in and say you know what
[1:13:52] at that conference time they'll come in
[1:13:54] and say you know we know you're doing
[1:13:56] well there we see a financial report but
[1:13:58] I got this gal over here I think I would
[1:14:01] like him to step in and take that church
[1:14:03] and I'ma send you somewhere else now the
[1:14:05] man could be in his neighborhood we're
[1:14:07] gonna raise the church and that's
[1:14:08] tonight man an hour away actually trying
[1:14:10] to break his ministry hallelujah
[1:14:13] politics get into the organization when
[1:14:16] they begin to maneuver certain things
[1:14:18] and then they finish this other man in
[1:14:20] he'd come and run the church into the
[1:14:22] ground running to the ground and when
[1:14:24] they see them on the ground then they
[1:14:26] call the other man and bring him back
[1:14:27] and say the Lord is leading me to bring
[1:14:30] you back to this church it's all
[1:14:32] politics and actually the
[1:14:34] the man had a bid Amen moved around like
[1:14:37] chess pieces hallelujah Amen they moved
[1:14:40] around like chess pieces pieces they
[1:14:42] feel it must be the will of God if the
[1:14:45] bishop said it a name North political
[1:14:50] they know God ain't got nothing to do
[1:14:52] with that decision they know to hold a
[1:14:55] political but there stay right there in
[1:14:57] that system a man being being being torn
[1:15:00] torn to pieces underneath a setup like
[1:15:03] that God never intended for the church
[1:15:06] to be led that way we need to be led by
[1:15:08] the Spirit of God hallelujah we don't
[1:15:11] have no no headquarters that we report
[1:15:13] to around here I thank God for that we
[1:15:17] got I just say we got one headquarters

[1:15:24] search Esther what we're gonna preach we
[1:15:26] let the Holy Ghost lead us and guide us
[1:15:28] as well as to what we gonna preach amen

[1:15:33] it's the Spirit of God that's running
[1:15:35] the church yeah glory to God somebody
[1:15:38] hallelujah hallelujah so glad I could be
[1:15:42] in a place like that where we're free
[1:15:43] and the reason that man was subject
[1:15:46] himself there is recovery because of my
[1:15:48] paycheck glory to God they do these
[1:15:52] things all in all in order to get a
[1:15:54] paycheck they'll they'll take whatever
[1:15:56] they said they win brother branham's say
[1:15:58] I'd rather be on the corner drinking
[1:15:59] branch water and eating soda crackers
[1:16:01] then be subjected to a system like that
[1:16:04] praise God
[1:16:06] amen I'm a living witness I had to make
[1:16:10] a choice one day a man as to whether I
[1:16:13] was gonna stay in the big Cathedral like
[1:16:17] Church if I had to make a choice what
[1:16:21] you know cuz somebody acts been you know
[1:16:23] what well what about your church and you
[1:16:26] know how many people oh this many people
[1:16:28] okay it's the same amount of people from
[1:16:30] about five years ago in ain't you no
[1:16:32] more no more growth this church is
[1:16:34] growing like crazy yet it growing like
[1:16:36] crazy but people not changing see so now
[1:16:40] I learned a long time it's not
[1:16:41] necessarily quantity its quality
[1:16:47] right quality it's the quality of the
[1:16:50] believer it's the quality of the saints
[1:16:53] of God right it's what I see in their
[1:16:56] lives I know God is transforming these
[1:16:59] people God is changing these people
[1:17:02] right so I'm not looking for quantity
[1:17:05] I want quality and I had to make your
[1:17:10] choices I know I'm sorry I'll take I
[1:17:12] take the ones that God gave me and I
[1:17:14] passed them to the end
[1:17:15] praise the Lord had to walk right out of
[1:17:17] the big thing I walked out of it praise
[1:17:21] the Lord amen they've told me so we've
[1:17:23] been waiting it for you to make a
[1:17:24] decision whether you gonna join it no
[1:17:26] God ain't told me to do nothing it was
[1:17:29] pretty much such a church down and come
[1:17:31] and be with us
[1:17:31] then what God told me to do and I know
[1:17:34] what God I know how I know God told me
[1:17:36] to started but he never telling me to
[1:17:37] shut it down it's like it's like it's
[1:17:40] like when you when you when a parent
[1:17:42] gives I mean the mother and the father
[1:17:45] has something to do it too when they
[1:17:46] give birth to a child they man that
[1:17:48] child belong to them praise the Lord and
[1:17:51] you gonna you gonna treat you're gonna
[1:17:53] do everything you can to make sure that
[1:17:55] child gets to a man a proper stage
[1:17:57] praise the Lord and can take care of
[1:17:59] itself but not God it told me to abandon
[1:18:01] my child praise the Lord
[1:18:04] you understand God told me to do that
[1:18:07] man choice would be abandon it but God
[1:18:11] saw say stay right there
[1:18:13] hallelujah and God I bless you alright
[1:18:17] let me go on a little further I got to
[1:18:19] get into some things it says let this
[1:18:23] quote goes on to say they'll send them
[1:18:26] over there to this church they don't
[1:18:27] realize they're killing theirselves see
[1:18:30] first place if that man goes in there he
[1:18:33] can't feel that man's place it came feel
[1:18:34] the other man's place they then they
[1:18:37] only weak in the church to try to show
[1:18:39] favor to some pet and always been that
[1:18:42] way that's denominations right it says
[1:18:44] but I believe in the supreme authority
[1:18:46] of the local assembly amen
[1:18:51] yes ladies church be its own chooses
[1:18:54] pastors the deep
[1:18:55] whatever it is and then that way the man
[1:18:58] in there has no Bishop over him the Holy
[1:19:01] Spirit wants to speak something to that
[1:19:03] church they don't have to ask anybody
[1:19:06] about whether they could do this or do
[1:19:10] that
[1:19:11] glory sets up its the individual in
[1:19:15] contact with the Holy Spirit show me by
[1:19:18] the Bible was great in the Bible and a
[1:19:20] local elder to a local church that's
[1:19:23] right yes sir the sovereignty of a local
[1:19:25] church each church in itself now
[1:19:27] Brotherhood that's wonderful
[1:19:30] all churches ought to be a brotherhood
[1:19:32] like that together but the sovereignty
[1:19:34] of local church as the Lord leads us
[1:19:40] that's how we go a man we don't have to
[1:19:42] check with nobody about decisions that
[1:19:44] we make here a man it's as the Lord
[1:19:47] leads us that's how we go I thank God
[1:19:49] for that
[1:19:51] hallelujah now the Scriptures we were
[1:19:54] reading there and you 111 says sworn to
[1:19:56] them for they have gone in the way of
[1:19:58] Cain and ran greedily after the error of
[1:20:03] Balaam for reward now look at this he
[1:20:07] says and perished in the gainsaying of
[1:20:10] its escort but it's Korah a man Korah it
[1:20:14] referring back to the gentleman and a
[1:20:16] Moses day now I want to look at this the
[1:20:19] way of Cain a man the error of Balaam
[1:20:24] the gainsaying of core now now I looked
[1:20:28] up that word gang saying just to try to
[1:20:30] get a little bit more understanding and
[1:20:33] before before I go that once you
[1:20:35] understand three things about the weight
[1:20:37] I mean one thing about the way of Cain
[1:20:39] the error of Balaam and the casing of
[1:20:44] Korah
[1:20:44] I want you to notice what they all three
[1:20:46] of these situations involved worship
[1:20:50] hallelujah all three of these situations
[1:20:54] involved a form of worship amen
[1:20:57] so this is a very spiritual thing that
[1:20:59] they talk about in Cain's day he offered
[1:21:02] got his sacrifice
[1:21:03] now because God did not accept the
[1:21:06] sacrifice he refused to give God
[1:21:08] anything else where you decide to do
[1:21:10] it's killed my brother in order to kill
[1:21:13] my brother is gonna force God accept my
[1:21:15] sacrifice that big calls God to accept
[1:21:18] his sacrifice amen the sacrifice was
[1:21:20] that slay an animal just like your
[1:21:22] brother did then I'll accept that
[1:21:25] hallelujah it involved worship in the
[1:21:28] days of Balaam Balaam was going down
[1:21:31] there and to speak to them and notice
[1:21:35] the skips a ring greedily after the
[1:21:37] error of Balaam for reward
[1:21:38] the reason Balaam ended up down there
[1:21:40] trying to curse the tomb of Israel with
[1:21:42] Belak it's because they were offering
[1:21:44] him prestige they were offering him
[1:21:46] money they were offered in position they
[1:21:49] will offer him think so he took the
[1:21:50] offer and he went down there to try to
[1:21:52] try to curse God's people God never
[1:21:54] allowed him to curse what God had
[1:21:57] blessed hallelujah God never longed I
[1:22:00] got used to a talking donkey to try to
[1:22:03] get his attention AHA hallelujah what
[1:22:06] does God have to use to try to get your
[1:22:09] attention let you know you have the will
[1:22:11] of God I mean some of us will be just
[1:22:17] like Balaam hallelujah I might as well
[1:22:19] say even when a talking donkey we gonna
[1:22:22] do what we want to do you still will not
[1:22:35] go in a different direction he got a
[1:22:39] talking donkey he got an angel about to
[1:22:43] kill him nothing stopped them from going
[1:22:48] down there because of money going back
[1:22:55] through a sermon that I preached by
[1:22:56] about 2014 say money is the thing that
[1:23:00] caused people to get out of will of God
[1:23:01] money can do that to you that's why you
[1:23:04] got to be very careful with money
[1:23:06] hallelujah preachers have to be careful
[1:23:09] with money money would cause a preacher
[1:23:11] to get out of the will of God
[1:23:14] hallelujah amen that's why the Prophet
[1:23:17] could not be controlled by money
[1:23:21] somebody walked up to him or a very
[1:23:24] wealthy woman say you know brother
[1:23:26] Branham she loved her she loved his
[1:23:28] ministry say but some brothers got to
[1:23:30] him just begin to talk to her say now if
[1:23:32] you could just get him to change his
[1:23:33] stance on this and change its stance on
[1:23:36] that just give them all this money if
[1:23:38] he'll if you change the stance so he
[1:23:40] went in and let's just say brother
[1:23:41] Branham I want to give you this okay
[1:23:43] thank you I appreciate that she said but
[1:23:45] I just have some requests okay what's
[1:23:47] the request could you just change your
[1:23:50] stance on this and could you change your
[1:23:52] stance on that could you not preach this
[1:23:54] thing could you not preach that you know
[1:23:56] and then you can have this check you say
[1:23:58] sister take the check back take it back
[1:24:01] because I mean the gospel can't be
[1:24:03] purchased like that the gospel can be
[1:24:07] purchased like that so I'm not gonna
[1:24:09] allow you to chief in my experience with
[1:24:12] God by offering me money like that
[1:24:14] anyone he did it multiple times somebody
[1:24:16] else came with 1.5 million dollars he
[1:24:19] told her check up a sinner I said I'm
[1:24:21] not gonna accept it because he knew that
[1:24:23] preachers always got mixed up when it
[1:24:25] came to money and I'm gonna tell you
[1:24:27] it's not just preachers that get mixed
[1:24:29] up when it comes to money the church
[1:24:31] would get mixed up when it comes to
[1:24:32] money be careful when the devil starts
[1:24:35] throwing dollar signs that you be
[1:24:38] careful always be careful because of
[1:24:41] that mean if it's only for the money
[1:24:42] it's not gonna work out right praise the
[1:24:46] Lord I'm gonna be honest with you if
[1:24:47] it's only full of money it's not gonna
[1:24:49] work out right I went back and there's a
[1:24:54] sermon I preached to I'll go back and
[1:24:55] listen to five years ago 2014 the I
[1:24:59] think I tired the escaping chorus lie
[1:25:02] and in there identify many of these
[1:25:04] things hallelujah and after I finished
[1:25:07] preaching I was listening to yesterday I
[1:25:08] said Lord everything I was talking about
[1:25:10] has been manifested it was a prophetic
[1:25:11] sermon amen praise the law was a
[1:25:15] prophetic sermon I'm gonna try to finish
[1:25:17] what I'm where I'm going here today but
[1:25:18] in this balaam because of money he will
[1:25:21] listen to the talking donkey he wouldn't
[1:25:24] listen to the angel of the Lord he
[1:25:26] didn't even listen to God
[1:25:27] God told him not to go he had three
[1:25:29] three chances not to go and he still
[1:25:32] presses press his way in there anyway
[1:25:33] God down there could not curse them
[1:25:36] couldn't curse them kept blessing every
[1:25:38] time he every time he opened his mouth
[1:25:40] it was a blessing pronounced on Israel
[1:25:42] hallelujah but then they treated he
[1:25:45] taught them a lesson of how he can get
[1:25:47] how they can get Israel involved in
[1:25:49] certain things and then God God would
[1:25:51] have to curse them because of the
[1:25:53] involvement they got in and it happened
[1:25:55] to be with worship there was involved in
[1:25:58] a man and Anna but and a particular
[1:26:00] service that they shouldn't never should
[1:26:01] have never even been there
[1:26:03] hallelujah all right the gainsaying of
[1:26:06] korah also involves worship now let's
[1:26:10] deal with this let's deal with this I
[1:26:13] looked up this gainsaying of korah and
[1:26:17] the gainsaying meant contradiction
[1:26:20] strife opposition rebellion so anytime a
[1:26:26] person is getting involved in the
[1:26:27] gainsaying of korah
[1:26:28] it starts with contradiction strife
[1:26:34] opposition rebellion okay these are the
[1:26:37] things that kind of come in now now our
[1:26:40] chorus problem and I'm and I'm gonna try
[1:26:43] to get this because problem was that you
[1:26:46] not the only holy one among us Moses and
[1:26:52] they're not gonna say it this way Cora
[1:26:54] had a problem with a one-man ministry
[1:26:58] i'ma say it again Cora had a problem
[1:27:02] with the one man ministry father if I
[1:27:06] recall correctly core was actually
[1:27:08] related to Moses I believe like a cousin
[1:27:10] or something like that he was related so
[1:27:12] so here Carla had a real issue with
[1:27:15] Moses being the one that God chose to
[1:27:18] lead his people Cora said you'd like the
[1:27:23] only one holy and he was right because
[1:27:26] God had raised up a whole nation of holy
[1:27:28] priesthood he called a whole nation
[1:27:32] of Israel holy people so he was right
[1:27:35] there was God's chosen people but God
[1:27:37] had a chosen prophet to lead his chosen
[1:27:41] people
[1:27:42] Moses was that prophet did not cause see
[1:27:46] when when when Miriam and when when
[1:27:48] Aaron came against Moses what God did to
[1:27:51] Miriam why could he not take notice of
[1:27:54] those things but he still rose up and
[1:27:56] say you're not the only holy one a wrong
[1:27:58] among us then now I want to kind of I
[1:28:00] want to put it on this level for you
[1:28:01] because you have a lot of people say
[1:28:03] brother Branham on the only prophet
[1:28:05] brother Branham one only one that God
[1:28:08] use and I'm gonna tell you like this yes
[1:28:10] sincerely there were some other people
[1:28:11] that got used but when we talk about a
[1:28:13] prophetic ministry one that the Word of
[1:28:16] God has revealed to there was only one
[1:28:17] that got used his name was William Aaron
[1:28:20] Branham for this day for this day now
[1:28:23] Cora had a problem and I want to just
[1:28:26] let me just forewarn the church it
[1:28:29] happened before and I know this spirit
[1:28:31] is still around it'll happen again
[1:28:33] anytime you got somebody trying to tell
[1:28:36] you that brother Branham one the only
[1:28:38] one watch that spirit now we know he won
[1:28:43] the only one we know God using other
[1:28:45] people I told you you were God's choice
[1:28:47] I'm hopeful I have a call to bring to
[1:28:48] you in a little bit to to just share I
[1:28:50] meant a little bit more than that but
[1:28:52] but I want you to understand anytime a
[1:28:54] person is getting you to reason against
[1:28:56] a man the person that God chose to lead
[1:28:59] us watch that spirit Oh glory I know
[1:29:04] what I'm talking about here today
[1:29:05] because the spirit of Korah is still in
[1:29:08] the land the spirit of Carl always
[1:29:10] stands up against oh my goodness always
[1:29:16] stands up against who God chose to lead
[1:29:20] you got oh my my my
[1:29:22] you weren't even thinking like that
[1:29:24] until the spirit korra came into your
[1:29:27] living room you won you won even
[1:29:32] considering energy star
[1:29:33] until the spirit of car intervene and
[1:29:36] what the spirit of Cora does it does not
[1:29:39] go to Moses directly when he has a
[1:29:41] problem I'm just preaching to y'all just
[1:29:44] for a little bit what the spirit of
[1:29:46] corpses it gets you privately
[1:29:48] y'all hang on talk to me but the spirit
[1:29:50] of courgettes you probably then begins
[1:29:52] to break this down and break that down
[1:29:54] the spirit of Korah use the Word of God
[1:30:00] the spirit of a man will use experiences
[1:30:04] the spirit of core users all caster but
[1:30:07] ultimately the spirit is trying to bring
[1:30:10] you to himself rather than put you to
[1:30:13] Jesus Christ this might be prophetic
[1:30:18] again this might be prophetic again I'm
[1:30:21] telling you watch out for this because
[1:30:23] see this was a spirit that's in the land
[1:30:24] now and that's why Jude warned us now
[1:30:27] watch out for this now hallelujah spirit
[1:30:31] of quarter Legion and spirit of core to
[1:30:33] have his own church going in the middle
[1:30:35] of Moses church spirit of Korah
[1:30:42] why Moses got Church they got Church
[1:30:45] hallelujah I'm telling the truth now
[1:30:48] amen
[1:30:49] the spirit of core just just you know
[1:30:50] Aaron just it's just rebellion all the
[1:30:53] time and I want to tell the rebellion is
[1:30:55] that's the sin of witchcraft
[1:30:56] Wyatt see see see it see if we just all
[1:30:59] join together and work together then God
[1:31:02] can do great things but the spirit of
[1:31:04] core comes in and said now you know what
[1:31:06] I don't really think Moses helling that
[1:31:08] right I think I do it this way may the
[1:31:13] Prophet didn't mean it this way he
[1:31:15] should have said this you don't tell God
[1:31:18] what he should have said you just follow
[1:31:22] what was already spoken
[1:31:24] all right now I'm telling you watch this
[1:31:28] spirit because it's a real spirit that
[1:31:30] comes into the land and have people are
[1:31:32] confused it's it's opposition its
[1:31:35] rebellion and it's always contradictory
[1:31:40] it creates strife that the spirit of
[1:31:45] court will create strife now you know
[1:31:47] some others say brother Jack you calling
[1:31:49] me the spirit of Cour I ain't called
[1:31:50] nobody the spirit of Cour I'm telling
[1:31:52] you that that spirit does exist and like
[1:31:55] I read last week ur evil spirit can't do
[1:31:58] nothing until it find somebody that we
[1:32:02] can work through don't you yield
[1:32:05] yourself to this spirit that is working
[1:32:08] in the land
[1:32:09] hallelujah all right let me read another
[1:32:13] quote here why why I'm against organized
[1:32:19] religion notice this the Prophet makes
[1:32:21] this statement says God has chosen Moses
[1:32:25] and God had chosen heir God had chosen
[1:32:28] Moses this was God's choice God had
[1:32:30] chosen Moses God had chosen Aaron and it
[1:32:33] was a message of the day
[1:32:35] so what Aaron and what Mose what Moses
[1:32:37] and Aaron with bringing was the message
[1:32:38] day you know Moses gave God account
[1:32:40] excuses I can't even speak I came this
[1:32:43] you say I tell you what you be the God
[1:32:45] and Aaron's gonna be your prophet
[1:32:49] hallelujah you be the God and then air
[1:32:52] is gonna be your profit God gave Moses a
[1:32:55] personal profit God had chosen Moses and
[1:33:02] God had chosen Aaron and it was the
[1:33:05] message of the day and no matter how
[1:33:08] good the other side looked it was
[1:33:10] contrary to God's thinking let me go on
[1:33:13] says we got a leg we gotta let God's
[1:33:16] thinking be our thinking let the mind
[1:33:19] that was in Christ be in you and this
[1:33:21] Bible this Bible reveals the mind of
[1:33:25] Christ and the whole Book of Revelations
[1:33:27] called the apocalypse in the revelation
[1:33:29] of Jesus Christ and we
[1:33:31] see how the how he condemns the thing
[1:33:33] how he takes it to one side we'll get to
[1:33:35] it after a bit all right he keeps going
[1:33:37] his he keeps saying Cora I believe he
[1:33:40] was sincere in his act say that's why I
[1:33:42] said you can be sincere but be sincerely
[1:33:45] wrong Cora I believe what he was sincere
[1:33:47] and it's act I believe the man didn't
[1:33:50] mean to do wrong I believe it was the
[1:33:52] ignorance of the man that didn't see the
[1:33:55] hand of God o my Lord Jesus the
[1:33:59] ignorance of the man that didn't see the
[1:34:02] hand of God now look at this he says see
[1:34:08] the hand of God moving and know the
[1:34:09] scriptures and that's the reason it has
[1:34:11] brought it to reasoning Cora is gonna
[1:34:13] bring everything to reasoning to
[1:34:15] reasoning amen and that's just about 90%
[1:34:18] of the trouble today that we try to
[1:34:20] inject into the program of God I would
[1:34:23] think him and we're not supposed to
[1:34:25] think at all my god he does I was
[1:34:29] thinking we're supposed to surrender our
[1:34:31] thinking to his will you understand now
[1:34:36] so if a person are willing to surrender
[1:34:39] their thinking to the will of God watch
[1:34:42] that spirit call with good intent now
[1:34:48] look at what privacy Cora with good
[1:34:50] intent when around with a false doctrine
[1:34:55] telling these brothers and showing them
[1:34:58] by reason that God hadn't only blessed
[1:35:02] Moses God show me this and God did this
[1:35:06] for me and god did I tell you if you
[1:35:09] watch this spirit it's still alive today
[1:35:11] see he says he says God that God hadn't
[1:35:14] only blessed Moses the Prophet the
[1:35:16] messenger and had only blessed him blood
[1:35:19] the whole congregation who was holy he
[1:35:24] said now the whole congregation has a
[1:35:26] right to do this and the whole
[1:35:28] congregation has a right to do that and
[1:35:30] so they got good man Levites Oh My Jesus
[1:35:34] now that is gone
[1:35:36] Joris which would be called today the
[1:35:39] ministers
[1:35:41] hallelujah I noticed you know there's
[1:35:45] something I think is again prophetic to
[1:35:47] the people because we if there's a
[1:35:49] spirit that gets in the land you know I
[1:35:51] always watched what I call parking lot
[1:35:53] preaching I always watch that you know
[1:36:00] and I watch out you know after sermon
[1:36:03] it's preacher or the Word of God I
[1:36:05] always try to go back and and Riaan or
[1:36:08] what was already said see because it's
[1:36:11] cuz Cora ain't gone real north what was
[1:36:13] saying Cora's gonna say well I would
[1:36:15] have said it like this I would have did
[1:36:19] this see Absalom did the same thing
[1:36:22] right hallelujah I mean that that's a
[1:36:26] spirit and if somebody you know I know
[1:36:28] God sent a prophet I know that but but
[1:36:30] but but what but what you're trying to
[1:36:34] say because you know my mama just be
[1:36:36] honest what I feel people doing they're
[1:36:37] trying to bring disciples to themselves
[1:36:40] not make disciples to Christ they trying
[1:36:43] to make disciples unto themselves they
[1:36:48] want a following it's the truth in their
[1:36:51] how a man they got ways to lead Jews
[1:36:54] Cora had a way of leading renowned man
[1:36:57] Karlin just go to anybody the Bible if I
[1:37:01] don't get a chance to read it but you go
[1:37:02] back and read number 16 Carl when it got
[1:37:05] written now man important man and he got
[1:37:08] them all mixed up and he started trying
[1:37:11] to lead them and then a user used to
[1:37:13] think with a whole congregation is holy
[1:37:15] not just Moses all right all right all
[1:37:19] right let's watch this he says and so
[1:37:21] and so they got good man Levites now
[1:37:25] that's God that is God's choice which
[1:37:27] would be called a daily ministers Levite
[1:37:29] was the minister of the temple did not
[1:37:31] Moses call them down for it and here he
[1:37:34] never went irreverent he told them to
[1:37:36] take census and put a holy fire in it
[1:37:39] and put the incense over the top of it
[1:37:41] and to waive this holy incense which was
[1:37:43] the command of God and they come up to
[1:37:46] make
[1:37:46] a group of men to control the church a
[1:37:48] man where God had commanded one man to
[1:37:51] do so let's go on they have a problem at
[1:37:55] one man ministry hallelujah and when
[1:37:57] they did that Moses fell on his face
[1:38:00] when he knew that God had commissioned
[1:38:02] him for him to that work and God said I
[1:38:04] have them to bring those senses up here
[1:38:07] before the tabernacle and so when they
[1:38:09] begin the way that sense is full of fire
[1:38:11] the instance going God said to Moses and
[1:38:14] their separate yourself from them come
[1:38:17] out from among them for later he called
[1:38:20] them sinners unbelievers now you know
[1:38:24] when God was was God spoke this in
[1:38:28] and-and-and-and-and
[1:38:29] number 16 and maybe we just I'll stop
[1:38:32] that quote then I go back and just pick
[1:38:34] this up in number sixteen let's go to
[1:38:35] verse 20
[1:38:36] God spoke this where he told him to come
[1:38:38] out from among them a man now you got
[1:38:41] some things you got to do glory to God
[1:38:44] when you recognize the spirit you got to
[1:38:46] get away from that spirit a man come out
[1:38:49] from among its glory to God it's a
[1:38:51] spirit it's the spirit that that works
[1:38:53] come to come it's contradictory amen it
[1:38:57] goes against the Word of God it goes
[1:38:58] against the leadership praise the Lord
[1:39:01] God has a way to lead his people God and
[1:39:04] Moses day Moses was the one that God
[1:39:06] chose to lead the people but here comes
[1:39:08] Dayton and Cora against the leadership
[1:39:11] that God chose now look at this and
[1:39:13] number 16 now they did already I'm just
[1:39:16] kind of summarizing this because you can
[1:39:18] read the whole chapter when you get home
[1:39:19] but they had already kind of come up
[1:39:21] they got all these people coming against
[1:39:22] Moses and you know and that they're
[1:39:24] thinking in themselves you know you're
[1:39:26] not the only holy one week we can do
[1:39:28] these things too and Moses was just
[1:39:30] furious with them you begin to pray and
[1:39:31] they brought they senses forward and and
[1:39:33] everything like that and and Moses saw
[1:39:35] why why they have the census waiving God
[1:39:38] begins to speak to Moses now here in
[1:39:40] verse 20 and the Lord said in the motion
[1:39:42] unto Aaron saying
[1:39:43] separate yourselves from among this
[1:39:47] congregation that I make us that I may
[1:39:51] consume them in a moment
[1:39:54] and they fell upon their faces and said
[1:39:57] O God the God of the spirits of all
[1:39:59] flesh
[1:39:59] shall one man sin and wilt thou be
[1:40:03] wrought with all the congregation and
[1:40:05] the Lord spake in the motor saying speak
[1:40:07] unto the congregation saying get you up
[1:40:12] hallelujah
[1:40:13] from about the tabernacle I told you he
[1:40:16] was having Church while Moses was having
[1:40:20] church get yourself from Amen about the
[1:40:27] tabernacle Korah Dathan and Abraham and
[1:40:31] in a a Byram hallelujah
[1:40:33] now now now Moses gives up an analysis
[1:40:36] that hey y'all better yeah I better
[1:40:37] leave and I felt like that that script
[1:40:39] right there was a perfect tie-in to
[1:40:41] revelation 18:4 where John said I heard
[1:40:44] another voice from heaven saying come
[1:40:45] out of her my people that she be not
[1:40:49] partakers of her sins and that she
[1:40:51] received not of her place hallelujah
[1:40:54] back then there was a plague getting
[1:40:56] ready to strike Korah glory to God and
[1:40:59] today if we don't recognize the
[1:41:00] denominational system it's in God is
[1:41:06] calling his people my people be not
[1:41:22] separated a man beat I mean description
[1:41:25] come out of my people that should be not
[1:41:27] partakers of a sins and that you receive
[1:41:29] not of her plagues
[1:41:30] what's this plague that struck Korah
[1:41:33] after Moses got him so y'all better
[1:41:35] leave leave the church of Nathan leave
[1:41:37] the church the Byram and leave the
[1:41:41] church of coure right now before God
[1:41:44] strikes something strikes him dead leave
[1:41:45] the church there was some folks that got
[1:41:47] up and left
[1:41:50] i'ma tell you according to scripture
[1:41:52] Cora's own sons got up and left his sons
[1:41:56] did not die when he died because they
[1:41:59] left the church hallelujah hallelujah
[1:42:03] they left the church and they were
[1:42:05] spared they came out from underneath
[1:42:07] that spirit people gotta watch these
[1:42:09] spirits that's in the land
[1:42:11] I mean soon you know
[1:42:13] and I'ma just be honest with you at a
[1:42:16] time like this
[1:42:17] if folk differ with the way that the
[1:42:19] church is being led through the pandemic
[1:42:21] the spirit of Korah rice huh we all got
[1:42:27] to wear masks while they make enough
[1:42:29] watch that the devil want to use that I
[1:42:31] mentioned this last week how many get in
[1:42:34] glee leave there and left the house this
[1:42:36] morning with the door unlocked yeah your
[1:42:38] front doors unlock wide open back door
[1:42:41] wide open I mean nobody did that you
[1:42:44] know why you do that it's just because
[1:42:45] Amen you just it's a safety precaution
[1:42:50] how many how many actually just don't
[1:42:52] even put a lock on your door no luck no
[1:42:56] whatsoever it's got what we call a
[1:42:58] safety precaution when you got out of
[1:43:00] your car in the parking lot you actually
[1:43:04] locked the door unless you don't want
[1:43:06] the car hallelujah it's a safety
[1:43:11] precaution so some of the things we're
[1:43:13] doing through this kovat amen
[1:43:14] pandemic safety precautions and it
[1:43:18] shouldn't be an issue
[1:43:19] but but we have people to zero I don't
[1:43:22] think brother Jack should do that no
[1:43:23] wait a minute wait a minute watch this
[1:43:26] now because it's the same spirit in the
[1:43:27] land I'm telling you
[1:43:29] all right now I mean if this goes a
[1:43:32] little deeper I mean it hits it hits it
[1:43:35] and Meniere's that hit in the local
[1:43:37] church it can hit on your job sometimes
[1:43:43] you get you get you don't like I wait a
[1:43:45] boss did things so you're gonna rise up
[1:43:48] you got a different spirit on you gonna
[1:43:50] rise and not only not only o Hallel help
[1:43:53] me god I know the Holy Ghost is all over
[1:43:55] this but now you don't start going
[1:43:57] behind your boss back and you've got
[1:43:59] different people on your side and you're
[1:44:02] gonna bring something up in a meeting
[1:44:03] that ain't no way to handle things if
[1:44:05] you differ with a person the Bible say
[1:44:07] go to that person
[1:44:09] praise the Lord don't try to call a coup
[1:44:12] yeah
[1:44:15] praise the Lord don't try to call a
[1:44:17] whole bunch of people together so you
[1:44:20] can soar in numbers you can outweigh
[1:44:23] with the point whether there was a bus
[1:44:24] that laid down that's a spirit from hell
[1:44:27] it's a truth innit
[1:44:30] glory to God see the spirit that the
[1:44:33] court of gainsaying of korah don't get
[1:44:35] wrapped up in that now watch watch this
[1:44:38] I want to just show because in quarters
[1:44:40] day what happened mostly I've been a
[1:44:42] leaf court Church and after they all
[1:44:44] after the different ones got up he said
[1:44:46] now watch what God do say if I'm a false
[1:44:48] prophet if God don't do something
[1:44:50] different than he never done before the
[1:44:52] earth gonna open up and swallow these
[1:44:54] men hold right now soon as soon as Moses
[1:44:57] let the words out of his mouth earth
[1:44:59] opened up where their churches were and
[1:45:01] swallowed them up and cover right back
[1:45:03] up right right over them they died death
[1:45:06] like nobody else died you talk about a
[1:45:08] sinkhole that was a real sinkhole but it
[1:45:11] happened to happen it happened in the
[1:45:13] area where their churches were no more
[1:45:15] influence from these churches and then
[1:45:18] on top of that after that God said I
[1:45:20] bring the rods in here
[1:45:21] and the rock that that I choose the one
[1:45:24] that I'm making a choice
[1:45:25] bring the Rogers say now now once there
[1:45:27] happen these dead rocks that you're
[1:45:29] gonna bring in here I'm gonna do some
[1:45:31] supernatural and 24 hours I'm gonna do
[1:45:34] something supernatural to prove to you
[1:45:36] who my choice is and God said bring them
[1:45:38] in put their names on it and put his
[1:45:40] name on the rod and then 24 hours air is
[1:45:43] dead Rob began to blossom in the
[1:45:46] presence of the Lord I'm telling you you
[1:45:49] will start blossoming if you're in the
[1:45:51] presence of God stay away amen from from
[1:45:54] the gainsaying of core but just be in
[1:45:56] the presence of God and watch your life
[1:45:59] begin to blossom into it won't take long
[1:46:02] what I mean by blossom is that the
[1:46:03] revelation begin to unfold of you

[1:46:18] go on here a little further a man a man
[1:46:21] a man now I want to just kind of hit
[1:46:25] this
[1:46:26] spoken words original seat I want to hit
[1:46:31] this because this is kind of where my
[1:46:33] thought come from the angel the Lord
[1:46:35] gave the Prophet this message told him
[1:46:38] to pick up his pen and right now I'm
[1:46:40] going to but for today I usually don't
[1:46:43] do this but I'm gonna do this for today
[1:46:45] Amen because I think it's very important
[1:46:48] for us to see what God's choice is what
[1:46:51] is worried is I want to read this quote
[1:46:54] and I want to read a few scriptures look
[1:46:57] at this the the met the message spoken
[1:46:59] words original seat how different today
[1:47:01] so this is the angel speaking to the
[1:47:03] Prophet now a man and and a study just
[1:47:07] finished talking about how John the
[1:47:08] Baptist was a faithful forerunner hey
[1:47:10] man and and and I says how different
[1:47:13] today many so called
[1:47:15] evangelist this paragraph 427 and spoken
[1:47:18] words original seat part to a man who
[1:47:20] says how different today many so-called
[1:47:25] evangelists claim they have the answer
[1:47:29] from God for the people glory to God a
[1:47:32] man if I'll give you the date here 60
[1:47:36] 2-0 3 1 8 and the paragraph is 427 62 -
[1:47:49] 0 3 1 8 4 - 7 if it's - if it's 2
[1:47:56] messages then it's part - I want this
[1:48:00] one let me let me give you some words to
[1:48:02] put in there because this is gonna be
[1:48:03] important and that that's put in this
[1:48:06] was a money - making scheme this was a
[1:48:13] money - making scheme praise the Lord I
[1:48:18] got it I got to make sure y'all get this
[1:48:21] one and y'all just bear with me how
[1:48:26] different today many so-called
[1:48:30] evangelists claim they have the answer
[1:48:33] from God for the people just as Cora did
[1:48:36] denying disputing the authority not an
[1:48:39] angel
[1:48:39] it's prophesying that this is what was
[1:48:42] going to happen the people Justice court
[1:48:44] denying disputing the authority of God's
[1:48:49] vindicated anointed prophet Moses
[1:48:51] claiming he had the answer so chorus
[1:48:54] claiming he had the answer
[1:48:55] Amen this was a money-making scheme to a
[1:48:58] golden calf as many do today big
[1:49:02] building big school hatch our incubators
[1:49:06] of their same seed and then people then
[1:49:08] as like now they're for it after they
[1:49:11] have heard the true Word of God
[1:49:13] oh my through an anointed profit that
[1:49:17] was vindicated they fell for chorus lie
[1:49:20] now after they heard the word from the
[1:49:23] vindicated prophet then Cora comes along
[1:49:26] and begins to share all kind of other
[1:49:27] things and they fall put a spirit of
[1:49:30] Cora hello they fail for course not
[1:49:33] God proven prophet and knew God had told
[1:49:36] them Israel knew God I told them
[1:49:38] distinctly
[1:49:39] that he would vindicate his prophet by
[1:49:41] his word that's how a prophet is
[1:49:42] vindicated is by the word not the
[1:49:45] supernatural but by the word the reason
[1:49:48] we believe brother Branham was God's
[1:49:50] property because we see certain things
[1:49:51] in scripture that identifies a ministry
[1:49:54] like this it's supposed to come
[1:49:56] hallelujah glory to God look at this it
[1:49:58] says a new God had told him Israel new
[1:50:03] guy that told them distinct that he
[1:50:05] would vindicate his prophet Bosworth
[1:50:06] Cora was not a scriptural prophet but it
[1:50:10] looked awful good to the people not know
[1:50:13] he said corals not a scripture prop that
[1:50:16] mean he could have been a prophet just
[1:50:18] not a scripture one oh Jesus I hope we
[1:50:22] get that yeah you may prophesy sometimes
[1:50:25] you may get some things right but we
[1:50:26] talk about fulfilling Malachi 4 we talk
[1:50:29] about fulfilling revelation 10 7 we now
[1:50:32] talk about hitting and missing all right
[1:50:34] I'm going on because there's some things
[1:50:35] that's gonna be said here it says corals
[1:50:37] not a scripture prophet but it look all
[1:50:39] for good to the people same as it does
[1:50:41] now today today it's blood on your hands
[1:50:44] oh my balls of fire
[1:50:47] on the platform all emotion this is all
[1:50:50] emotion they're not looking at the word
[1:50:53] no more they're looking at the emotion
[1:50:55] we don't want you to get caught up on
[1:50:57] the emotion we want you to get caught up
[1:50:59] on what is dust at the Lord watch this
[1:51:03] now watch he says today it's blood on
[1:51:06] your hands
[1:51:06] balls are fine the platform oil in your
[1:51:09] fingers already away the Word of God
[1:51:31] this is my God if I can show you where
[1:52:06] it's written then you gotta say man it's
[1:52:11] not my emotion that's doing this this is
[1:52:14] what the Word of God say can I go
[1:52:16] further look at this it today it's blood
[1:52:18] on your hands balls of fire on the
[1:52:21] platform oiling your fingers and the
[1:52:24] same thing produces women preachers when
[1:52:28] we leave the church buying motion it
[1:52:30] would produce women preachers they say
[1:52:33] my brother Jack what's the matter with
[1:52:34] that let me read the scriptures for you
[1:52:36] they say the same thing produces women
[1:52:39] preaches not only that it produces short
[1:52:41] hair bobbed makeup what's the matter
[1:52:44] with all that let the Scriptures what do
[1:52:47] you have you won't you know this this
[1:52:49] not even brother branham's words I angel
[1:52:51] from heaven spoke these words and told

[1:54:20] in the scripture now let me let me let
[1:54:22] me go he says the same thing produces
[1:54:26] women preachers Shorthair Bob make up
[1:54:28] what do you have you would not think
[1:54:30] that people would fall for it but they
[1:54:32] did for Korah and they do the same thing

[1:54:37] denomination shorts so what kind of seed
[1:54:41] that's in them it says he goes owner
[1:54:43] says but thank God all Israel never fell
[1:54:47] for kora some state by Moses the
[1:54:51] anointed prophet with the Word of God

[1:54:55] elected by his word and his spirit see
[1:54:58] in and encourage that his sons got up
[1:55:00] and left the church and and stood with
[1:55:02] Moses and today Amen we left
[1:55:05] denominational churches and we come
[1:55:07] understand with this word reveal through
[1:55:09] a prophet now he used these statements
[1:55:12] about
[1:55:17] you know they they got blood in it on
[1:55:19] the four hands on their hands balls of
[1:55:21] filing platform they're loud women
[1:55:22] preachers let women cut their hair wear
[1:55:24] slacks and shorts and bypass the Word of
[1:55:26] God for the creasing talkers let's just
[1:55:28] read a couple of scriptures why why does
[1:55:30] the why why would the angel say don't
[1:55:33] bypass the word and allow this first
[1:55:35] Timothy to best read these read the
[1:55:39] scriptures there with me first to
[1:55:41] minister we not just make we're not just
[1:55:43] preaching things just because we wanna
[1:55:44] preach things we're trying to stay with
[1:55:46] the word our hearts would turn back to
[1:55:48] scripture if the scriptures say it you
[1:55:51] know what we say to description a man
[1:55:54] let it be so God if you wrote it in your
[1:55:57] word then I want I want to live that now
[1:56:00] watch this
[1:56:01] first Timothy 2 he says but I suffer not
[1:56:04] a woman to teach nor to usurp authority
[1:56:08] over the man but to be in silence 1st
[1:56:10] Timothy
[1:56:11] first Timothy 2 verse 12 but I suffer
[1:56:14] not a woman to teach nor to usurp
[1:56:16] authority over the man but to be in
[1:56:18] silence for Adam was first formed then
[1:56:21] Eve and Adam was not deceived but the
[1:56:25] woman being deceived was in the
[1:56:27] transgression so so so from that from
[1:56:30] the beginning of time when God came down
[1:56:32] and gave his punishments a man Adam and
[1:56:35] Eve were co-equal at one time
[1:56:37] hallelujah but after that she said he
[1:56:40] said that she have to serve her husband
[1:56:42] that's what happened because of the fall
[1:56:44] now now Paul Paul is picking up that
[1:56:47] same scripture bringing it to the church
[1:56:49] the same thing that happened in Genesis
[1:56:52] bring to the churches signal I suffer
[1:56:54] not a woman to teach nor usurp authority
[1:56:56] over the man and any time whoever's in
[1:56:59] the pulpit is the person that is
[1:57:01] usurping authority in the congregation
[1:57:04] hallelujah so if you have a woman behind
[1:57:07] the pulpit then you just broke this
[1:57:10] scripture hallelujah you just broke now
[1:57:15] I can go a little further if you want me
[1:57:17] to if you want me to the church as a
[1:57:22] whole represents a woman in Scripture
[1:57:27] Christ would be the male Christ is the
[1:57:31] bridegroom the church is considered the
[1:57:34] bride
[1:57:35] hallelujah so if a men in the in the
[1:57:38] church physically Amen if you have a
[1:57:40] woman given the word to the woman Church
[1:57:44] you have a spiritual homosexual
[1:57:48] relationship spiritually you incident
[1:57:55] and this is why the Spirit is coming to
[1:57:57] the land today in the church what we try
[1:58:01] to do is keep the church pure keep the
[1:58:03] church clean stay on the words there
[1:58:08] wasn't because he hated women it was
[1:58:10] because of what happened at the
[1:58:12] beginning just exactly this virtual
[1:58:14] sense and the Adam was not deceived
[1:58:16] verse 14 Adam was not deceived but the
[1:58:19] woman being deceived because she was
[1:58:21] deceived this is why she can't take the
[1:58:23] pulpit
[1:58:26] all right she was in a transgression he
[1:58:30] also said this he also and I could
[1:58:34] preach a whole sermon just on that but
[1:58:37] he said she said some other things I'm
[1:58:38] taking you back to the scripture now he
[1:58:41] says they're loud we're and preachers
[1:58:44] let women cut their wear slacks and
[1:58:46] shorts now why would the angel have a
[1:58:49] problem with women wear slacks and
[1:58:52] shorts well because angel wrote the
[1:58:55] Bible and if anybody does something
[1:58:58] Sogetsu Bible the angel has a problem
[1:59:01] can we just read Deuteronomy 22:5 praise
[1:59:05] the Lord I'm just reading it I could
[1:59:07] just say I'll go back and read it now
[1:59:08] I'm gonna read it for you I got another
[1:59:11] one Deuteronomy 22:5 look at this this
[1:59:14] is what the Bible say the woman shall
[1:59:17] not wear that which pertaineth unto a
[1:59:21] man neither shall a man put on a woman's
[1:59:24] garment and we ain't living in a day
[1:59:27] where men are wearing god women's
[1:59:29] garments and and and and and and women
[1:59:32] wearing men's garments this is a day of
[1:59:34] perversion I was just government going
[1:59:37] down the street here the other day and
[1:59:38] and you know they were
[1:59:40] get on the rosin and I see this person
[1:59:42] walking guy got gold in their mouth and
[1:59:44] you know I'm just in the way today
[1:59:46] Walker the minute like so a really rough
[1:59:47] guy it was not a guy it was a lady and I
[1:59:53] guarantee that lady had a wife when you
[1:59:59] got a woman marrying a woman you got
[2:00:01] perversion
[2:00:02] praise the Lord shirt you got a man
[2:00:04] married a man you got perversion praise
[2:00:07] look God never intended for it to be
[2:00:09] that way so so here we got scripted
[2:00:11] selves the woman shall not wear that
[2:00:13] with which potatoes and I noticed this
[2:00:15] it's they pertaining that mean if it
[2:00:17] looked like a man wear wear it a woman
[2:00:19] is not supposed to wear it the woman
[2:00:22] should not wear that which pertaineth
[2:00:23] unto a man neither shall a man put on a
[2:00:25] woman's garment for all that do so are
[2:00:27] abomination unto the Lord thy God now
[2:00:30] this is the Bible this is the Bible
[2:00:33] I know churches don't preach this no
[2:00:35] more but it's in there and that's why
[2:00:37] the angel said you know say say people
[2:00:39] when they start compromising when they
[2:00:41] start getting in their feelings they're
[2:00:43] gonna get away from these things and
[2:00:44] they're gonna go right back and doing
[2:00:45] things that's against my word hallelujah
[2:00:48] now let's talk about what when the angel
[2:00:52] said you know if it's gonna lead to wear
[2:00:55] and slacks and wearing shorts and women
[2:00:57] cutting their hair well let's look at
[2:00:58] first Corinthians chapter 11 verse 14
[2:01:01] and 15 the angels only quoting what he
[2:01:04] put in his word the angels only quoting
[2:01:07] what he put in his word now it's up to
[2:01:09] us to go back and find it in Scripture
[2:01:10] and live it alright look at this 1st
[2:01:14] Corinthians 11 verse 14 and 15 dumped
[2:01:16] not nature itself teach you hallelujah
[2:01:21] that if a man have long hair it is a
[2:01:25] shame unto Him that mean men are
[2:01:26] supposed to cut their hair now we in a
[2:01:29] day when men wanna have longer hair than
[2:01:30] women women want to have shorter hair
[2:01:32] than men hallelujah glory to God says
[2:01:35] dub not even nature itself teach you
[2:01:37] that if a man have long hair it is a
[2:01:39] shame unto Him look at this but if a
[2:01:42] woman have long hair it is a glory to
[2:01:45] her for her hair is given her for a
[2:01:48] covering
[2:01:50] so in scripture God teaches the man cut
[2:01:53] his hair but he wants to
[2:01:54] to where how long hair and I love the
[2:01:57] way one brother put it say some sisters
[2:01:59] because of you know just their ethnicity
[2:02:01] they might not have long hair naturally
[2:02:04] you say but sister if you don't cut it
[2:02:06] your hair is long in God's eyes
[2:02:13] so another sister could have hair down
[2:02:15] her back but if she cut it she got short
[2:02:18] here but you ain't cut your hair one day
[2:02:21] in your life God say that's long hair
[2:02:23] and it says glory these are God's
[2:02:28] choices see I'm talk about God's choice
[2:02:31] God's choice this wasn't for the sister
[2:02:33] not to cut a half but for the brother to
[2:02:34] cut his hair and God's choices for the
[2:02:37] woman not to wear garments pertaining to
[2:02:38] a man and the man not to wear garments
[2:02:40] that a woman would wear that's that's
[2:02:42] God's choice but what we've got out got
[2:02:44] involved in today is our own choices
[2:02:48] God has a heaven and a hell to put us in
[2:02:51] and it's up to us to follow his worked I
[2:02:54] told you see when when the believer
[2:02:56] hears the word when he hears the message
[2:02:59] too believable the believer hears it and
[2:03:02] he believes now how you know that I
[2:03:04] believe will leaves it because they
[2:03:05] begin to do it I'm not making this up
[2:03:10] when I say that our hearts were turned
[2:03:13] back to the word this is what our hearts
[2:03:14] went back to our hearts went back to
[2:03:17] Genesis all the way to Revelation and I
[2:03:20] don't say well well that's Old Testament
[2:03:22] we don't use that anymore okay so what
[2:03:23] about thou shalt not kill thou shalt not
[2:03:25] steal thou shalt not commit adultery are
[2:03:27] we throwing that away too
[2:03:29] we're gonna hold on to everything God
[2:03:31] spoke
[2:03:32] that's God's choice and I'm gonna let my
[2:03:36] choice be God's choice let me just read
[2:03:41] you one last quote cuz you are also
[2:03:42] God's choice oh oh oh oh I forgot one
[2:03:46] more scripture I got to read forgot to
[2:03:49] highlight this one second Kings 9:30
[2:03:51] because it said that they wear Shaq
[2:03:54] slacks they cut their hair they wear
[2:03:56] shorts they bypass the word for their
[2:03:58] own crease in dogmas and another one
[2:04:00] another statement that the angel said
[2:04:03] when they fell for course lie it said
[2:04:06] that
[2:04:08] this this the state produces women
[2:04:11] preaches short hair bobbed make-up it
[2:04:15] produces makeup well where we get makeup
[2:04:18] in the scripture second Kings chapter
[2:04:22] nine verse 30 there's only one woman in
[2:04:28] the Bible ever wore makeup look at this
[2:04:31] and when Jay who was come to Jezreel
[2:04:34] Jezebel heard of it and she painted her
[2:04:39] face and tired her head and looked out
[2:04:43] at a window the only woman to ever wear
[2:04:46] makeup in Scripture was Jezebel Jezebel
[2:04:49] was not a daughter of God Jezebel serve
[2:04:53] heathen gods and brother branham said
[2:04:56] the makeup is a heathen trait anybody
[2:05:00] read that quote or heard that quote it's
[2:05:02] a heathen trait hallelujah so when the
[2:05:06] angel says that this is what they do
[2:05:08] when they begin to compromise or when
[2:05:10] they begin to a man just get worked up
[2:05:14] in their emotions these are the things
[2:05:16] that come into the church I'm accepting
[2:05:21] God's choice I don't want to do nothing
[2:05:25] that displeases him a man I'm telling
[2:05:29] you you are God's choice and he wants
[2:05:32] you to walk according to his word not
[2:05:34] just a part that you agree with even the
[2:05:37] part that you don't agree with you can
[2:05:38] still say a man with your life alright
[2:05:44] one more quote this this great warrior
[2:05:47] David I'm going back to their paragraph
[2:05:48] ether t2 and this great warrior David
[2:05:51] should be on your first page I'll finish
[2:05:55] with this quote hallelujah there you are
[2:05:59] he know where he was standing he was a
[2:06:03] man of faith he believed God God was in
[2:06:09] him he knew he was anointed and you know
[2:06:13] the same thing if you you're Christians
[2:06:15] and if you if God hadn't elected you to
[2:06:19] be a Christian you
[2:06:20] would not be a Christian listen it's
[2:06:22] God's choice not yours
[2:06:25] so even for you to be a Christian it's
[2:06:27] God's choice not yours no man seeks God
[2:06:31] no man seeks God at anytime you have a
[2:06:34] salt god but God has sought you it
[2:06:36] wasn't you call it for God it was God
[2:06:39] calling for you look and then when God
[2:06:43] called you it showed he elected you you
[2:06:46] accepted the call it was justification
[2:06:49] then you gave your heart to Christ and
[2:06:51] was filled with the Holy Spirit and now
[2:06:53] your positionally placed in the body of
[2:06:58] Christ now if it made you quit your old
[2:07:02] mean habits and act like a Christian
[2:07:05] ought to if it'll do that for you it'll
[2:07:09] heal your body because it's a promise
[2:07:11] amen
[2:07:13] there you are I want to tell you that
[2:07:15] you're God's choice elected before the
[2:07:18] foundation world to hear the truth in
[2:07:20] this state so you could walk according
[2:07:22] to that and angel said you would be here
[2:07:24] now angel said that Amen that we would
[2:07:27] accept this work we wouldn't fall a man
[2:07:29] like the others four cores live we
[2:07:31] wouldn't get caught up in all that and
[2:07:33] start making his word just use my
[2:07:36] emotions a man in order to justify
[2:07:38] scriptures or the proof scriptures
[2:07:40] that's not it no we've taken God for
[2:07:43] what he said and what he is we say a
[2:07:45] Mantid or even the part that hurts us we
[2:07:48] say a man we God's choice we're God's
[2:07:51] choice we're God's people praise God a
[2:07:54] believer when he hears God's worries as
[2:07:57] a man a man a man shall we pray father
[2:08:09] you have given us your word and Lord
[2:08:12] there's a journey that you have carried
[2:08:15] us on through this year looking back at
[2:08:20] what an angel spoke in 1962 to a prophet
[2:08:23] told him to pick up his pen and write
[2:08:24] and Lord just been bringing paragraph by
[2:08:27] paragraph you know the timing you know
[2:08:30] Lord all about it and father you know
[2:08:34] that you are in control Lord the word
[2:08:37] must be preached and lord I just pray
[2:08:39] that we as a people can accept what has
[2:08:42] been given to us and love we got to be
[2:08:44] so careful
[2:08:45] Dathan the spirit of Dathan and kora in
[2:08:49] the land coming against what a prophet
[2:08:52] spoke Lord as he turned our hearts back
[2:08:55] to the word we didn't even know these
[2:08:56] things where there in scripture our
[2:08:57] churches never told us we didn't know it
[2:09:00] God and God the Bible says there there's
[2:09:03] a Time Lord where you winked at our
[2:09:05] ignorance you leave it you realize we
[2:09:07] didn't know it so you didn't hold it
[2:09:09] against us your grace was so great God
[2:09:11] but once we receive truth God that's
[2:09:16] when you begin to expect us to walk
[2:09:18] according to it so I pray God that those
[2:09:21] that are heard online those that have
[2:09:23] heard in person God as the word has been
[2:09:25] presented I pray Lord Jesus that they
[2:09:28] would God they would receive it they
[2:09:30] would walk in it and they would live it
[2:09:33] daily father's my prayer God we can't do
[2:09:36] this in our own strength but that's why
[2:09:37] we need the Holy Spirit Lord to come a
[2:09:40] man in come in to it's not just owners
[2:09:43] but come into us God give us the unction
[2:09:47] and the power to be able to live the
[2:09:48] Word of God you said after the Holy
[2:09:50] Ghost has come upon you you receive
[2:09:54] power God that's what we need
[2:09:57] the power of God the power of God to
[2:10:01] live the Word of God to bear the fruit
[2:10:04] of God to accept your choice God for
[2:10:09] your foster not like our thoughts and
[2:10:11] your ways are not like our waste fathers
[2:10:14] in Jesus name that we pray amen amen can
[2:10:20] we give the Lord a hand a priest
[2:10:23] brings the Lord
