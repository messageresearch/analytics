that but I was awake him to Miami and I went to another place consult you the Lord was wonderful once that caught me that that has got a heart attack so I should go to the hospital to pray for the dad so I went for the past and is called McGarry to we went and just before we even cut us off in today into the main hospital on the stairs this lady approached she says security called a vigilante so she came and said please pray for me how does she know how does she know us should not even know us so the pastor asked her what she needed she wanted deliverance she wanted healing she wanted Christ in her life she was an elderly lady maybe around probably close to 60 we prayed for her and the pastor preached to her she gave her life to the Lord she wanted to be baptized in the name of the Lord it like like even an hour before we went to the brother the brothers called Moises we went and pray for the brother the doctors came and they just excused as they went back we prayed and said a word he's a believer as ordered a brother and together Lord release him from hospital last last week she's been discharged on a hospital from heart attack because that was the second time he had a heart attack amen there's another lady who had two brothers one was another Lee brother and hh-he was sick we went to visit him and he was crying yeah I think an accident and he was bedridden so things were really bad for him we prayed and prayed for him and we sang songs to him and the Holy Ghost took over they began to sing and smile and now he was singing back to us with the joy of the Lord the Lord in situation amen sometime we can heal through medicine yes he does it he can heal through love he can Morocco he can do with the Word of God he can do with a sign the Lord can give you a sign that you are healed you wouldn't have to take medicine you even have to pray he can use that fed pool do just that take the sickness out of your life just like that amen you can do anything you want to do for you open your has to receive it and we were I was so sick and I got mean after preaching and running and traveling I was sick with sneezing and my head was how was it realistic whenever a brother invited me I was supposed to attend his wedding I couldn't go because I was renew my passport so he asked me to come and see a lot of daughter she's around a yen half so we went and the wife give me some vitamins too she made some solutions for me to drink and we're there when the pastor's wife caught that hey there's a lady here who needs you the daughter has a cancer of the stomach she's been through two surgeries so they wanted to come and go pray for him and I was run out with energy that night she was gone so we went and the pastor did all the praying and preaching for like two hours give her the word of the Lord she told ed the type of cancers and what cancers are is like a suspect of a crab is a demon actually that took ahold of your normal body sauce and distorted and twisted and destroy your life to the sub the life out of you and it said two cancer's one is the B'nai cancer which sometimes the doctors can help with medication and chemotherapy but when it becomes malignant sometimes there's no hope the only hope is Jesus Christ so he pretty went to her that even if you die receive Jesus Christ if it's your time to go you have to receive Christ before you go so the lady receive the Lord and she wanted to be baptized but because of the chemo she saw we needed a couple of months to recover from the effect of the chemo she's been through to therapist but she was very has it sincere had she said I'm thankful to develop because people have a lot of planes when they have cancer but thank god I've never had one pain my body's just normal I feel normal only than I have cancer but I don't have any pain in my body so she was just anyone with her son about a 13 year old son so we prayed for it the next day I went and I prefer I actually took a picture that we were going to send it in our chat room pray for her so the Lord she's doing well she's a correspond with the sending messages the lot is bringing an out there's nothing the Lord cannot do we visited a bunch of people who were also sick and pray for them and the Lord did a lot of things in Mexico but I would remember I was sweet come brother Jack come I'll give that testimony and I'll sing a song the Lord put up on my heart to sing for them in Spanish but our wits when the when the right time comes amen so that is a snapshot of the trip to Mexico god bless you for your prayers and your support the Lord knows you the Lord knows what it did with the press and the support you give it to us the Lord bless you today we want to just look at a scripture and we want to go into the word talk about I'll give the title littlest read the scripture first probably now be much better let's read face second Peter chapter 1 verse 1 to 11 2nd Peter chapter 1 1 3 11 the virtues of the Holy Spirit and what they do to us amen how do we get it how does it operate who get it when we get it we want to look at that now give it a title after we read it reread it so let's see second Peter chapter 1 verse 1 to 11 Simon Peter a servant an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ grace and peace be multiplied on to you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord amen according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue now verse 3 whereby are given unto us exceeding exceeding great and precious promises that by this you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust verse let's keep going give me the next verse and beside this and giving all diligence add to your virtue add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity charities love let's go ahead for if this is be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of Allah Jesus Christ but he that lacks distance is blind and cannot see afar off and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your callin an election election show for if you do these things ye shall never fall the last words for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen shall we be seated I want to yesterday I was praying and looking at the what is the title Lord what do you want us to go and I found this I got a title this morning at the office our caption it the nature of a perfect man instead of the statue of a preferred man or the Rema of the logos hospitable Rema Rema is our each and logos ello gos Daruma of the logos or the nature of the or of a perfect man a man who is a perfect man on earth in the human sense who is a preferred man beside Jesus Christ there's nobody in from Adam right through all of them there's nobody the only perfect man is Jesus Christ say oh brother but Enoch was perfect the Bible said that he was perfect before God now when John John was in the vision on the island of Patmos when the Lord move into the system Asian and mankind needed Redemption there was a cry who is worthy to take the book of life and give life unto mankind to pay the debt to pay for sins anak was there by he was silence amen Elijah was there he was silent Joseph was that he was silent everyone has a scratch on him or her but there was only one person and it's only one person the Lord Jesus Christ himself who had no scratch on him amen he walked through the blood system like you and I walked through but there was not a single scratch called sin or mistake in his life he was the only one who was worthy to use his blood his life in exchange for arson he became a sin that we will become his righteousness amen and so that divine nature the locust is Christ Himself is the silesia beam and the Rhema is the expression or manifestation of the celestial being amen the locust is not an ID is not a scoop is not something it's not like a wind is not something that hasn't got an itch it's just a person of Jesus Christ and the Rhema when we begin to manifest himself then become the Rhema amen in the book of Genesis if you look at Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 God created the world created all the things in the world but if you go to Genesis chapter 2 the Bible said that there was no one to the land Numa God has created a man he has really created a solution which is too funny eternally but then he hasn't murdered assistant element to put the man in it amen so got to the earth and created modded it in the form of a man Adam Adam means red earth a man with blood position in his body so God wanted to become flesh as well he wanted to express their the Teresa attribute the human attributes but he couldn't do it on so he created created Adam the freshmen amen so when created Adam then begin to manifest himself now if you go to Genesis you have got a turn at time when God begin to manifest eternal attributes of redemption he became God because Adam was God the Bible said that he was God over creation is all right so Adams put things into creation because God wanted his son Adam to be like him he was part of him if you have a child you don't want your child to to be a baby the rest of his life or the rest of her life you don't want to pack your child one is 38 years old when it's 40 years old you kind of impact him I mean there's no way you know so you want you have to teach him how to walk how to eat how to speak that hey you a human being you are not going to be a baby you are not going to be in that mess all your life same thing spiritually when we are born we are spiritual babies we are in diapers we don't know who we were but then the low began to teach us how to eat drink milk how to drink water how to change ourself how to do this because this attribute was already in us when a child is born as a baby he's already a human being she's already a human being he only began to lend attributes more than a true that is already in him to express this in a much better way in a much excellent way amen because as a baby he doesn't know how to say I'm hungry so when is hungry what does that she or he do he cries that's what he does because it doesn't know no language that it can speak English she can speak French but then wait time when you begin to learn language begin to evil and baby language we have got a language sometime alidium the mothers can understand the mother can know or the older sisters and brothers can understand a baby language they Pickett with time as their teeth and as they develop their senses now they can speak an adult language they can tell you I need food they can tell you I need to use a restroom I need to drink water I'm sick mommy I have a headache so the same thing the Lord put put us on a grid stitch that we grew from infancy on to maturity but we are not going to be babies the rest of our lives amen praise God in Genesis 1 we have the following turn at time of manifestation then we have the following time Genesis 1 is when God begin to manifest the eternal attributes Genesis 3 is when the contrast came in the fall came in and sin was a shed upon the earth in human risk if you take the years of Adam and Seth and Methuselah and Enoch and Noah and the rest of the most of them live up to 900 plus years Methuselah was having 969 Adam was 930 somewhere night 12 nights and now where's that age what happened because the ethics were corrupt that we can't get the age but then the Lord has compensated us with the revelation of Jesus Christ amen so in Earth in the natural we don't grow to 200 300 maybe at most 110 120 115 130 some few people get to that age but then God has given you the revelation the eternal aspect of you amen so just as the Lord had attributes in him when we begin to manifest himself on earth attribute to be God to be a savior he put the same divine attribute in his sons and daughters to manifest those attributes we read from the scripture Peter was asserting the church to add certain virtues on to them how do we add average the Bible so that a man cannot even add add an inch on to his height so how am I going to add feet when I can even add an inch on to my height how do I do that why manufacture that know that attribute is already in you before the foundation of the world as it 10 attributes and as you pick the first an is what you have the Bible said Jesus began to preach he must be born again the old man has to die and cried Jesus has to take preeminence in your life and then cry cry Jesus is that attributes when into prominence in your life just like a human being is just automatic for you to talk as part of you is part of a human being to walk to sleep to dance to eat to drink to do things to yawn to do things that human beings do so you don't even think about it they come as to when is needed amen now a person can have those sundews attribute without even having the Holy Ghost baptism God the Bible said that God gave gifts unto men even without repentance they are people that are not even Christians they are very patient they have some faith they have some godliness in them they have some kindness about them they have some atmosphere about them they don't have they're not even Christians I'm not talking about people while denominational were Christian this require not Muslims people who don't have even any religion but God divine atropine a gift he put those gifting them but it doesn't mean the Ivanpah again those get manifest now there are others that they need to have those gifts the godot's gift when they are born again there are people who don't have they don't have an iota of patient this snob the judge patient is out of their life but then when they are born again this person is different so what happened to you it is not him but it's what Christ in him it is the Christ that is living in this woman that is giving him that patient that is bringing that brotherly laugh that is bringing the godliness that is bringing faith in him amen the Bible said I would have faith no man can even please God so how do you get faith the Holy Ghost has to give you the faith how do you get temperance the Holy Ghost has to give you the temperance how do you get brotherly kindness the Holy Ghost has to do that how do you get profit laugh so when someone offends you when someone persecute you you love him so much that you don't want the law to punish him you want a lot to forgive him and you forgive him or her and pray that a lot should bring him or her out of that situation when the person has treated you with evil when I mean Evo Evo probably all of us I've gone through one or the other that's somebody that even you love it that sometime doesn't take a non-believer maybe sometimes a lot to make it's always somebody who is close to you we supposed to be me a believer you can offend you and if you don't have that divine laugh of forgiveness so I know I'm never going to forgive this person the rest of my life even my family will forgive them because the deed is against our family they wouldn't train our children their generation that oh this family did this against us don't even talk to them if they have to save your life choose to die that's how bad it is they don't have nothing to do with this family family and family we are like the North Pole and the South Pole they don't meet together because of something that our kid in Lapland in the life situation but then when the Holy Ghost comes in the Holy Ghost change you that you are not that old person no more that word person who cannot forgive his dead he's an illiterate he does even exist no more now Christ who is the locust who is the great antenna who is the ll Elohim who can forgive the unforgivable who can forgive the one who doesn't deserve is in you so you just allow it you let go and let God let the Lord take preeminence and you bring that forgiveness that laugh that kindness out of you because it's an odd root that is in you Amen let's do a little bit of a reading resource create quotations here just to batter at this point and we move forward praise be to God let's go to the message and expectation 1950 expectation 5 0 0 8 1 0 paragraph 36 to 37 praise be to God yes expectation bar graph that Isis okay let me give me one second god is good praise be to God yes is that and when you receive the Holy Ghost I'm not sure if I'm reading the right paragraph but then is that when you receive the Holy Ghost everything that you have need of for Earth journey is in you then when you receive the Holy Ghost or the Holy Spirit or Jesus Christ the person of Jesus Christ in your heart not when you confess him you can confess him with your with your lips but if it's not on the inside he's talking about when you receive when he comes on the inside you have everything that you have need of this F Jennie is in you turn it loose and let it go to waxey let your feet loose and believe God 37 now she's talking about Simon Simeon had a promise of the Holy Ghost that he wasn't going to die until he's seen the lost Christ and it wasn't afraid to testify of it either some of them said show him to me amen this was an elderly man probably who who couldn't tell when he was going to die but was promised him that he wouldn't die until he see the Christ the Messiah and he believed it and told people he wasn't leading chabad his old age he think about his condition because the Holy Ghost reveal a dream that you are not going to die no cancer no demon nothing can take your life onto the Lord is finished with you amen so those attributes in you when you have the Holy Ghost let's go to expectation again 5-3 1953 this time five three zero five zero seven god bless you but a Solomon is what you preach mind someone for me petition fifty three five three zero five zero seven paragraph 16 Satan hasn't got any legal rights at all over a Christian and I want you to take hold if you have a free leaf I had a dream one time I was sleeping in and a voice was talking the devil the devil the devil when I woke up understood how Christian complain oh is the devil that ever made me to do this that I would took my that I would took my job that I would took my money that would destroy my economy the Lord permitted that they would to do it the devil cannot destroy your job the Lord want to give you a better promotion Amen if one thing is taken away from you unless you are not working in the line of the Lord unless you are messed up then the Lord want to use that to bring you even it's a love of God amen I'll give you a testimony as a brother everybody give a testimony fire real let me read it first I'll give you the testimony praise God Satan hasn't got any legal rights at all of a Christian every time a man gets sick God just write out a whole big bunch of chicks like that how many can take that I take it we take it for the church amen we need our church in school amen is that God writes a whole bunch of chicks like that and put his name at the bottom so the check is already written your name is sign here five thousand dollars five million dollars eternal life the check may not always be money it could be healing amen it could be seven of loved ones it could be a promise in your life it could be a ministry it could be a could be anything it could be a job amen so am I not always we may be you don't need money it could be it could be a joy of the Lord it could be something else you have always wished for and a lot manifested in your life amen so he said your name at the bottom put your name at the bottom here here they are throw them out are you scared of it fill it out whatever things you desire when you pray believe you believe you receive it it will be given to you mark 11:24 whatever you desire when you pray believe that is already been given to you and you shall receive it Amen because a lot want to teach you patience out of what you need maybe you need something you need this battle it is not in your rich it's far away you don't have the money to buy it between you getting this battle of water the Lord want that attitude of patient and faith and temperance and trust to come out so the Lord can please obstacles in your way what we call Satan we caught a devil or that this written about me or the devil the devil he made my daughter sick or the devil he made my husband leave me that I would ever the devil always caused confusion that whatever the devil weighs Christ where's your God is he dead we have to delete that out of our our speech we have to we magnify the devil the Lord has given this attribute us but we limit God and magnify the devil so all we see the devil cleaning our life it took my job it took my this he did this to me he didn't make this function it is no devil the Lord was a Wednesday night but Jack said the Lord is the one if I walk in the path of the Lord rejoice and praise God don't let it try refreshing change your testimony keep even if you are sad praise God even if you are crying so shut the law shut a victory and give the praise to the Lord the devil is nothing Amen praise be to God let's finish the region and we go for this set Jesse believed every word of God is a seed that will bring forth it will bring forth what is purposeful purposeful I see many of you down here is cuttin apples peaches fruits when the little apple tree is no bigger than the right than the right every Apple Dow ever be in that tree is in it they write in dozens of bushels of apples isn't a little tree right then why you see but Abraham no well wait it came from if they are not they the only tree right then amen is trying to print a picture here that if you take an apple seed or take a corn seed tomato mango whatever pray have occurred whatever you planted I've done some planting before so I know a little bit about planting so you planted tree here or you plant a seed here you pour water on it I also good today from with my grandmother so I remember those this when I was a good ranch so now you plant it then you prayed a lot to send a rain upon the seat and the sunshine will come upon it now listen about I don't know how Mays can take about three days to germinate it was proud it will come out maybe up will take more than that some can take like a year but then it's going to come out it has to it need a Sun it drinks it takes the water it is a sunshine it is a moisture then we get to come out when it comes out what are the fruits all this fruit that is going to bear where does it come from the fruits they seed the flowers the leaves the stem they are in that little seed it's like a mystery isn't that salacious is the other dimension the system mentioned control everything on this planet so is there in another dimension and as the tree begin to suck the water now a begin to manifest the first lives may be true leaves the Conn leaves the knot of the leaves begin to grow stem flowers now you've got mango trees all over around like pressures is the best give it supplies with mango she's got a mango tree be probably a bunch of them in his house and he bring it to us he plus she planted probably only one mango tree or there was only one tree that was one seed but out of that mango tree or see that was planted most of us are eating mango fruits from that tree this seemed let's see how it applies in this in in our lives in the spiritual life is that a thing I go to not the only thing there is is talk about the tree now the only thing that the little tree you stick in the ground okay I think I did that mmm okay that's draw the moisture from the ground it has to draw more than what is lotted portion what is it's not a portion you have to give it plenty of water and when you give it water it just drinks and drinks and drinks so it can't hardly drink no more and it just start pushing out and it pushes out limbs pushed out flowers push it out blossoms push that oppose the Apple was on the inside of it at the beginning it just has to drink every man that is born again in Christ Jesus everything that you have need of your healing sit down or flee to your hero but everything that you have need off of of the whole life journey is in you right then and when we are planted in Christ you see what I mean when you are born again and the baptism of the Holy Ghost has come into your heart you have everything that you have need off for the journey now the only thing you have to do is to start drinking drinking and pushing out drinking and pushing out I believe he hears I believe he hears my analysis of Jesus Christ he is the you know the in exhaustible fountain of life and every one that is planted in him can't drink and drink and push out and push out to every dent every redemptive blessing that God has promised belongs to you and it's your personal property amen it's your personal and he said the devil hasn't got anything to tie the devil hasn't got any tie to it at all amen every promise that you desire I don't deserve to own a jet plane no I don't want one if you give me one I was selling it and do something else with it because I I don't think I'm gonna need a jet plane only no I don't I don't it's not in my book of life Amen but I need money to buy it buy ticket and travel so if I need ticket if I need to go pretty gospel defin is in me already amen if you need to buy a house the house is in you already you're already living in the house if you need to rent a house you have it already but then you have to drink the weight and I wouldn't bring you faith and what bring creation the word bring the minor the finance that won't bring the credits that you need it brings whatever attribute you need to own that house amen because it's already in you you won't decide if is not in you to begin with this no even you doing it is the Holy Ghost in you bringing that attribute else amen take our loved ones all of us have got loved ones that we are desiring and print a lot toward to bring them in amen they already before the foundation of the world you already in the Lamb's Book of Life amen don't think that oh my son daughter husband wife is going to hell no he or she is already in the land book of life it doesn't matter how messed up he or she is it doesn't matter how much sin is engulfed in he's already in Tana amen so now the Holy Ghost just like the Holy Ghost redeem you when you are in sin when you a non-belief when you want denomination when you know who you are the same Holy Ghost is now using not jesus of 2000 years ago but is using your flesh if you see my flesh to bring the rhythms redemptive attribute into manifestation bringing it from the logos into the Rhema amen the logos is in the one is the system mention when you don't see it when you have to use your faith but not the Rhema is when West defeat becomes manifested as waste amen so you believe it that is already done it doesn't matter how much that the person is you believe for him or her you pray and you bring him before the Lord and you just rejoice over him or her and the right time comes you see him where he belongs to amen that is our Lord amen and that is our Jesus amen there's not an impossible before him there's not an iota possibility the Lord does it all one time my brother gave a testimony his own life testimony took me to a place houses that he owned and he said brother I own 12 houses how did I get his houses I was selling a gas station and my mother got sick so we had to buy narcotics so when you buy a saw you have to she was given a prescription for morphine and stuff like that so I begin to seduce medication with my mom and make money I'm BOTS bunch of houses then the law the Lord lead me in the bad so they took all the houses 12 houses and even they took my money that I was working I was only left with 33 say 33 dollars and 11 cents in my account with all the thousands and whatever money I had and he said they put me on this did ask me to eat up forfeit those houses are good to do the rest of my life something like that and so they put me on parole and I go to their office and as 29 look I'm not a person that I used to be if I'm the person that I used to be and you took my 12 ounces I'll blow you to pieces but I've got Jesus on the inside so I don't care about those houses were not my they were not they were evil so if you want to owe them and said the Lord is in me and the prophet saw said you'll go away you don't have to come again I could see a change in you so now when the Lord changed you he bring a sharp contrast he took impatiens out of your life he take demons he took ancestral cases he explains that we are running through your family that wasn't of God you consumed them then the attitude of Jesus Christ came to manifest in your life now you might say oh I don't have the faith to bring this to pass when the circumstance comes the faith will come amen there's a brother from Nigeria he's nodding Virginia now he has a testimony was it was a young preacher and they used to invite him to go and preach he was going to write an exams which he has registered for and then a pastor I invited him to go preach so he went to preach without going to take the exams after the exams when the resort that under the resort was supposed to be in he called one of his they can said but I'll go check my isms for me Cerberus embodied in today's arms how are you kidding a sword is a No go check it for me I have results take the money and go check it he went went to check it and he had an excellent result when he was even present it is a mission room have to go right you have to stay steady he did he had to trade away because how the Lord chose to honor his faith for forfeiting his exams to him preach to go and do service for the Lord the Lord took care of him mmm and so when the circumstance comes the pillar of fire the Holy Ghost in you who bring things to pass amen the third police I knew already we are not waiting to some thousands of years to receive the fed Puno the Zeppelin II only didn't on the other side right here glory to God there was a brother who was going for a meeting and he didn't have money he was walking actually into a meeting working some miles and you got to a place was feeling weak and it's a lord if you don't help me I'm going to pass out but I thought want to go for the meeting right away there was a whirlwind begin to blew out of the whirlwind came a dollar bill not now this happened I think in the 80s into the dollar bill and went to the restaurant to buy food and water and continue the meeting is anything hard for the Lord praise be to God there was a time I came out from my door I open my door and I was a twenty dollar bill and I needed that money I don't know where he came from but he put it there for me right in front of my door this happened to me is anything hard for the Lord the third policy you faith is in you virtue is in you temperance is in you brotherly kindness is in you love is in you all of them is in you you keep drinking the word keep drinking the waters of living waters of life and as you keep drinking it bring the attribute out from you they bring into expression you bring it to manifestation and if you have to go without a jet plane to let's say you want to travel some way and you don't have the ticket to go you don't have the money to go and you to be there what is it you can break this body when you get there put it back and do what you need to do amen it happened to what is Stephen in a Bible not even help me Phillip right Phillip me it happened to him he was going to the Lord called him to breach a preacher this Ethiopian Enoch he was reading a book of Isaiah and he didn't understand he was a rich man on his childhood maybe's in his messages or something like that so in this philip went to preach to him as plain the word to him and pray for him got baptized and one survivor right the Lord needed him to go to a service to be a minister which was miles from where he was there's no way he could walk he was already didn't have a childhood but the Holy Ghost in him broke his flesh break the sistine element into oblivion into nothingness then he appeared a few funny appeared in other toes put it back the body skin on and you went to preach amen is anything hard for the Lord what do you need this morning the Lord cannot do for you what is your need what are you praying about he's already knew amen keep drinking the fountain of living waters amen glory hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord amen there's nothing too difficult for the Lord amen let's read what we read about the second Peter is about the attribute in you personally but even beyond then the Lord has put other gift in you for the church amen let me give a testimony brother was brother brother brother Jeff god bless you bye Jeff we went to restaurant a couple of I think it weeks ago but I was three I don't know where Jeff want me to say this but forgive me brother Jeff I went to put your Tropicana or tropica from the camp we went to eat the one on Okeechobee and then but I was three and I and brother Jeff way which order the food and I think the way I was on the table waiting for them they were gonna be there drink this lady came and she said you want to you and your friend you go to strip and I was thinking like person strip that she means repassing strip or something else because I was trying to process she made my strip and I look the way she was dressed old he said I'm working this new strip club right here and I want to find out if you people would like to go to the strip club this I was lured where do I go from here I was going to process it from my heart I wasn't angry I was I know the loss send it to me so I want to see where the Lord is going because I want to give it a right answer they kept us and I said well are you guys ready to go to strip guys you have it as a strip club here I work at a strip clubs and you guys want to go I just came to eat is just right here and I am promoting and so I just let her speak she spoke would spoke to us and I said well the Lord has a purpose for your life we are Christians so the law has a propose for your life is that what you want to do she said she came from Puerto Rico and then she was renting a place with her friends and things got hard and she got this job and she liked to dance and she's got his job at a strip please and she was telling me I was listen quietly said the first time I went I couldn't do it I had to put my dress on it was hard for me I had to drink and then put my dress on but then the second day oh I drunk and it was easy I begin to do it and it's cool I'm doing it I love it okay so I said you go and make it yourself for men to look at you say oh yeah they don't do nothing to me they just look at me and say okay that's alright so I begin to talk to we're talked about a lot to me that God has got a purpose for your life this is not alive the Lord want you to do ever ago she was also talking to her that is it the only job you can do you can't get a job you can work in restaurant why do you do that job do you know what it means so so yeah yeah I'm not a bad person I said no no you are not a bad person so we kept trained the Word of God with her talking to her and she said oh I need to go and so I listened to you so you gotta listen to me but it's don't run away and I know spiritual designer is Lloyd you don't ever want to run away so let me talk to you so we kept talking and we kept talking we kept talking and she said I said can we pray for you said sure so we bow has now in pray for me and as I said oh I feel like I'm in changed I feel like I don't want to go there anymore so this is not your place to begin with and I know the Lord has already said ball in motion so as aconite can we take your number we want to contact you I took your number and I sent I keep sending messages to her and I know the Lord is working on had a loss Sunday now for the Lord give me that patient it has sued a lot of us who trained me to be that else--if way to me some time ago probably out of run away or out of shoe wear off but now I've got the patient and I can see beyond what she's doing that the Lord is sitting there and the Lord send it to me why of all the peoples in the restaurant didn't invite nobody to a strip club that invited the sons of God to go to strip the Lord has a purpose the Lord has to bring attributes when it isn't it for amen there was a time I was an analyst on a flight from I think Dallas to San Antonio and I was on the aisle and there was this guy in able to seat and another guy and I was drunk smelling of alcohol and he started talking to you that guy he said I don't want to talk to you shut up so he turned on me and he was drunk and talking why are you going in where you from and I also cannot be on that side I could have done the same thing like the other guy but I had the Lord has given a patient and I know there's something behind what he's doing and I'm just watching the Lord ways going so he kept talking and talking and asking me a bunch of question like I was under interrogation okay I answered him so after I said why going what's your business said well I live in San Antonio - I do a artificial hands and foot for military people because some attorneys they I think the largest trauma center US military center and the whole world they bring people from Germany and other places to come in to do limbs you know prosthetic limbs for them so that is good so I said what what is listen in life besides money and what is your destiny she said my wife is very religious and I said I don't go to church but I suppose that changes and we kept talking the gospel he was drunk and he was smelling of alcohol you got to a place the drunkenness left him and we kept talking he broke into tears and as I can we pray we know that right in the plane and we prayed and the pressure of the logic over even the people around well looking not looking in a bad way but he could feel their presence on the Lord and I said you want to give your life to the Lord there was something I thought there was something in his life that he couldn't give up he was a narcotic situation and do since I had to give up said my wife I'll let my wife come to your church but he couldn't come because there's something holding my I said my wife Oh Graham so he went the pastor was waiting for me at the airport said pastor this guy is going to raise people for your church he said and I could see this is sitting him but the devil has bound him so the lot of bring the attitude is in you already whatever you need it's already in you the Holy Ghost will bring it out when is needful amen in the UK had a situation but Jeff asked us about could you do explain this all the time I said it's not every time I was never I do experience it was in a blue moon in UK I was went to wake I think the work was cancelled coming from Townsend I would backpack on me and I met a lady she said what do you have for me and I saw I have nothing to cook they don't call is true that the colleague who can find a suit you can grab one she said when I was coming from home something to me I'm gonna meet my star and you are my star say O Lord so she kept talking she was drunk with one hand with a cigarette another her with a bottle of beer and talking and we're going on concentric circle and I'll just with not the Lord looking into what Lord what do you have for me today so we kept talking and asking Christian she said oh I used to go to church but then when I read a Bible I don't understand and a lot gave me a word I said yes the Bible has an author just like any other book the author is Jesus Christ and the author has revealed the book on to you and she posed a kind of hit hey so you need Christ to kick in the Bible to you and I said I said star I can't die and leave you if I'm your star but as thought of David Jesus Christ he will be with you even in you on to the end of the world and other study you need so we kept talking she threw his cigarette away she threw the beer away she said I want to hear more the word of the Lord and I pray for her which said you go to I said I go to church in London about three away from reading so you find any Bible Church here and I know you're gonna be the other side I pray for her and I left another time I met her she said I don't drink no more I just came to her I said I know the Lord has already done the job amen so so the Lord has brought the attributes in you everything that you need personally and for others is in you let's go to reading what the Lord has for us even as beside your personal need beside your faith your temperance your kindness let's go to a first Corinthians chapter 12 s1 praise be to God first Corinthians chapter 12 verse 1 let's read a little bit downward so now concerning spiritual gifts brethren I will not have you ignorant you know that you add Gentiles cried away onto these damp idols even as you were led wherefore I give out to you and I give want you to understand from here I want you to understand that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus a Christ and that no man can say that jesus is the lord but by the holy ghost now there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit and there are differences of administration's but the same Lord and the bases of operation but in the same God which works all in all but the manifestation of the spring is given to every man to profit without four to one is given as food they spread the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit to another faith by the same spirit to another gifts of healing by the same spirit to another the working of miracles to another prophecy to another discerning of spirits to another divers kinds of tongues to another interpretation of tongues but all this work all this worketh that one and the self same spirit dividing to every man severally as he own for as the body is one and has many members and all the members of that one body being many of one body so is Christ for by one spirit we are all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been all been made to drink into one spirit for the Lord is not one member but many amen so now this is for the church this is for the body of Christ that we desire just as Peter was admonishing the shed and add to your faith virtue add virtual temperance temperance brotherly kindness now these are the gifts God has given to us in his own providence in his own sovereign grace and mercy predestination is given some healing of healing some gift of faith some prophecy to bless the body of Christ amen so those give that day but then if you don't receive it just like Peter was admonishing it's not we we cannot manufacture any gift no it's going to be like trying to be like a peacock putting some feathers that is not meant for you but then if we whatever the Lord has given to you it could be like David the Lord gave David a little slingshot through that slingshot he called a bear he called a lion and he killed Goliath amen he also must be a little mean the Lord giveth you to free you don't have to be the pastor of that church you don't have to be a minister I don't have to be a deacon but a lot of give you these two tools amen that when you go on your knee things begin to happen supernatural things begin to take place to be set free people that are bomb begin to be loosed the module three things begin to happen amen so you use these truths if that's what a lot has given to you you might not have all the money on the planet but Allah does giving you love in your hearts amen love for people amen you can ask people you can see the Lord can put a burden on your heart to pray for the best might not even have to tell you their problem but a lot has given the eyes of Revelation that I could see this my brother is going through this I can see my sister is going through this you can even write their name in a book and three put your Lord I see my sister struggling I see my brother struggling I see my pastor going through this I see our church going through this the Lord promised that a change of God would never be put to shame Lord do this for my sister do this for my brother Buddhist for my past and goodies for the ministers and the Lord will give you a testimony as free men you see when the Lord does it you inform you that he that is amen because it's working one-on-one with you because you are the prophetess you are the Prophet you are you are an instrument a lot is used in amen and when you commit your heart out to the Lord and you breathe your tool is not a bit true you don't have to be the pasta you don't have to be a minister you don't have to be a deacon you don't have to be the prayer most persons that are in a church but a lot of true of your knees when you go beyond your knees and pray bondages begin to break amen but we can be set free that's a release in that change new begin to happen in your life amen and then what you do this someone should be something I'll share with you pray i effective prayer we are librum so that we are it's like a man who has got a million dollar in the bank this man doesn't know how to write a check and this other man is crude you can write a check but doesn't have nothing so now these two guys that can come together hey you have a check I know you can sign your signature hey buddy I can sign a signature can we sign it and go get some food sure we can do that now we have been given the weight but when a time we don't pray our prayer is just a lazy man's prayer we just prevail little remember was it started we had a 21 21 day fasting after we need to go on we don't have to lay down I don't and I you need to press on you don't have to wait for but I just call another fasting prayer in your own life we need to pray you to let this Reviver continually in the church and the more you pray the more things are happening now when you pray if you won't buy a notebook and you're just a regular notebook whatever you want when you pray write your prayer topic on the Left amen right the date the topic what you are praying about describe it a little bit and on the right something you can be thankful to God for it doesn't matter how life is you can be thankful to God you can breathe you've got blood running through you you can talk you can dance you eat food amen you get groceries what I'd came from your picture cause somebody's paycheck you eat all the same amen so you can thank the Lord for some time doesn't have to come from your paycheck all the time it could be somebody it could be your family it could be a friend it could be whoever the Lord can't I somebody said what project is that but a westcoast testimony that a lot put up on families had to make a do grocery in the midnight and will give to them so sometimes a lot can use somebody's picture to bless you right the topic that you want to pray about and write something you can be thankful to God on the right side of the page you could be lord thank you for this morning thank you for my pastor thank you for the ministry thank you for my brothers and sisters thank you for eternal life thank you that I can't walk somebody want to walk somebody's at a hospital they can walk somebody's in the morgue they don't have breath in them by you and I have got breath in us so it means God loves you Amen so you can be thankful to God for and when you pray when it's time for prayer get every to get it and I you Bri beside wek Church get your own time if it's start with 10 minutes if you just start with a baby step 10 minutes or 30 minutes every day we have 24 hours in the day right give 30 minutes if you can give sermons to the Lord switch your phone off that's a ribbon is enough for nobody is for me and

spend 30 minutes in your private time with the Lord amen and see what the Lord would do for you see the testimonies that we manage from your prayers see the results see the supernatural now breathe through in the course of your single prayer amen so let's add prayer to the way because if you have a car and you don't put you don't have a spark the car is not going to move you might have a brand new Mercedes or Chevy or whatever vehicle if you don't create a spark that is pollution the cars gonna be beautiful gorgeous with all the leather seats but it cannot move is meant to board transport transport a person from point A to point B the same thing we can have all the mysteries we can have all the revelation we can have a prophet we can have Jesus Christ you can have the beautiful church you can have that the most powerful pasta but if you don't pray it doesn't matter how mad the path is for you God also want you to 3 amen God is working from both ends so it's not only the pasta it's not only the ministry it's not only the Deacons but you you are part of what the co-workers of God amen glory hallelujah praise be to God I think I've kept you too long praise be to God the Lord is good now look let's go to a scripture here Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 just a simple scripture Genesis 1:1 in the beginning the Rema of the logos amen praise be to God in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth that's it let's go to John chapter 1 verse 1 in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth let's see what John 1:1 says in the beginning was the word and the word you know Graham said the theologian sometimes they wrote it but I didn't write with a revelation and the Word was with God it's supposed to be the word the word was in God every manual weight is in you the word is not separated where is what was in Christ and the Word was with God but it should be the Word was in God and the Word was God amen when you talk about where does a human being are what is the sound that is coming from our mouth but when you talk about God and His Word is not just the inscription of English and Latin and Greek and French and Spanish his word is the few funny his word is the Lucas his word is himself in action in attributes Amen we can say that LSU's are precious sister here when he was a young lady we can say in the beginning was stubborn she was a teenager some years back and the teenager became a young lady she got married and I only became a mother and the mother became a grandmother and she became to bring more attributes it's not a different person that was a teenager when she was let's say 15 or 16 it was an analysis tabitha was a married woman maybe 35 40 and 50 and so forth it wasn't another woman that is maybe 60 or something is the same person she just add an attribute upon attribute bringing the attribute out same thing with Jesus Christ is the same God he was a father he was Elohim he was a blow fire and he said a blow fire in the church but Rama was deplore fire now is in the body of Christ the Holy Ghost in you is the same as the people of fire so in the beginning was the word and the word was in God and the Word was God the English word for God is God but now when you go to definitely have a know him because God is just object of worship but the Grand Master is Elohim God is just one of the attributes so in the beginning was Elohim and the word was in Elohim and the word was Elohim lla Elohim is the same person changing attributes became Assyria he became a Sevilla became a Sevilla he became God he was worshiped he became the OVA Rafa he's a healer he has become Deva Missy is our banner is the one who protect us he has all the attributes in you so now Genesis 1 in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth John 1:1 in the beginning was the word which is which is in order cuz Genesis is the Facebook right but John 1:1 was older than Genesis 1 John 1:1 is the logos is Elohim and Genesis 1 is the creation manifestation of Elohim amen so John 1:1 was there before Genesis 1:1 came into creation amen so you the PLAAF I was in you was you before you became a human being before you pick on this flesh that we are so used to that kind of limit as you were in China you had no beginning if you read a second Corinthians chapter 5 we have a Tabernacle not made with hands and when this one drops that Minako is in you it takes over create what you need to create and live on the other side internally so you have no beginning you have no end now when you go to another scripture let's look at a scripture here let's because Hebrews chapter 9 verse 27 he said it's appointed unto man once to die and after that judgment Hebrews 9:27 it's appointed unto man once to die and after that after that judgment and we come to John chapter 5 24 he says we are passed from life maybe let's read it if we have a day less reading Hebrews 9:27 so they'll be on the same page Hebrews 9:27 and as it is appointed unto man once to die but after this the judgment so that is Hebrews 9:27 John 5:24 John chapter 5 verse 24 verily verily I say unto you he that hears or here at my word and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death unto life glory hallelujah 1 says Hebrews 9:27 said is appointed unto man once to die and after that judgment now when you come to a John 5:24 very when the law said verily verily it means take notice truly truly it's a strong word he said whether you have to or take it in a brutal letters they have setting we have number in those ways which come from the law that is a word of it could be caution or a word that is is cereal that you have to take it to heart so said truly truly I say unto you he that hears my word and believes on him that sent me has everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death to life how do you compare these two descriptions one says there's an appointment you appointed to die once and even after that does not end you are going to be judge another I said you have platform life onto judgment one is talking about the flesh man this flesh man the long she is not going away when his life is over just like your schedule clooth you drop it right here but then you've got another Tabernacle we've got another temple we've got another beam that's on the inside is the eternal person and is the one we have to start listening to he's the one we have to stop insensitive to him he that is in you the logos that is in you the Christ that is in you the Holy Spirit is in you the appeal of fire in you the more sensitive you are the more he works to do one more closer because you can hear his voice but when he's singing this beat and you are going this way he's gonna wait for you here but you are doing or stuffy a Shadrin doing stuff over here but when you are sensitive to the Christ in you he talks to you you hear his voice you hear a voice he gives direction he tells you that the battle is already done victory is yours amen you cannot die you don't have to worry about your bodily condition because you are eternal amen no demon no sitter can take your life if it's not finished with you just like your clothes you are wearing nobody can come and pull it out of your skin until you finish and you send it home and put on another clothe how much more God do you think that the devil can take out from your a the devil can take you from the hands of the Lord no no second is no demon no trials no tribulation the Trice is meant to strengthen you is meant to bring patient is meant to bring a laugh is meant to bring a temperance is meant to bring faith that you need for something future a monogamy for the present the Lord allow you to go through certain tribulation and trials for your future destiny you are going to need that faith in the future you're gonna need that life in the future you're going to need that temperance to be able to stand silent Trust in the future amen so don't look at the virtues as linear because God doesn't work in a linear form God walks in circles in cycles and in spheres what do I mean by that in our human concept we come from 1 to 3 God has got attributes the attributes are eternal God is yet speaking through us God is in somewhere else is in brother Jack reaching somewhere in Washington God is in other ministers and brothers and sisters praying for somebody who is sick is the same goddess in a sensible fountain his infinate he's in system Michelle listen my brother he's my sister is in all of us and the more we recognize guarding us and guarding one another the more we see the supernatural being sensitive to the Holy Ghost in you in your brothers in your sisters in your ministers in one even in your children amen never think oh this children this generation there's nothing good nothing good going to come out of them no God is going to issue them more than he's showing you they're going to walk more in Christ amen because the same one because in you is working in their life they are going through their destiny but the same Holy Ghost is what the same to you funny the simple of fire is taking them through the channel to put a spirit that they need for this life and when the time comes the same Holy Ghost is going to grab them and use them lightly amen he that is in you the Holy Ghost in you being sensitive to the Holy Ghost is one of the greatest things we need in our lives prayer and sensitivity to the spirit said but how do I guess and seem too desperate free when you pray it take all the noise and the chattering are we it is what is knowing this guy here this guy's not the one in control no sometimes make a lot of chattering thinking isn't control telling you taking all the limitation that you have oh you are sick this is not going to be all right look at your problem here look at this year and you begin to enumerate them number one you are sick number two you don't have money to go to you don't have even insurance number three your family do you mean care for you number four you've got a lot of stuff but don't let this guy chat let he that is in you this guy here is the control tower amen he's the holy ghost is the one who's in control he's the one who runs a ship he's the one who runs the company and you have to let him go into action but if you don't let him go into action is not going to profit you just like because of the plane issue I think a boeing has a grounded or the point seven three something max it's not waking and sometimes not working they're not making money they are loose him and they are getting a lot of lawsuit but when they get it on the air to move passengers that is when they put into action that's when they get money the Holy Ghost can be in you or it can be in heaven if it's not function you is not profitable to you you can praise God in heaven in some way but if that God is in you you know sees glory in your life that's reason ye must be born again because the old bed cannot help you it cannot give you patient it cannot give you temperance it cannot give you all the virtues but a new birth Christ Jesus when you allow him let go and let loose what do you what do you gain when you let God the Lord in I think was a Wednesday neighbor ajikko steadiness young people even older people people may teach you they think you are crazy you've chosen this path when you can have life and enjoy and have pleasure you don't have a boyfriend don't have a girlfriend you sell a virgin is the devil speaking right there but if you don't have your standing you cannot think okay I think I'm I'm wasting my time in the church you know this judges like old folks and you know you dress long and there's no fashion in the church I know before having good time over there why don't I go and join my friends why don't I go to club what I'm good go to party you're gonna do something that you regret the rest of your life amen come to church and a lot of bless you amen good parameter the Lord will bless you stay away from AVO and a lot of bless you consecrate your heart your body on to the Lord the Lord will bless you in the future you're gonna be smiling and laugh and be happy amen don't good a path of least resistance don't gotta part that everybody's going in choose the narrow way yes you're gonna pay a price for choosing the narrow way because the gospel doesn't come on on roses it come as ragged amen is gonna cut you some tell me to cut you from your balance you don't even know where you are standing the Lord is sending succeed in your life the six is a judgment seal is not judging you to condemnation but it's taking sentence out of your life and bringing the attribute into your life Branson when the Lord calls you he said a judgment on you the six is a judgment hand of God is what judgment to destroy you destroy your human body but they are telling you that is no ready to go into the kingdom of God remember the seven parameter there's seven parameter you get to the seventh step before you go to the kids chamber you see the kids a Chamberlain or the kids a right hand man that before you get into in you got to strip everything strip yourself out the King doesn't want to occlude and if you want to get married to the king this is a crude the King want you this the rule that you have to wait now the night race at about the spiritual now you have to let the old man die and let Christ be born into your heart so that Christ should see the preeminence that you don't have your war Lord whatever you want me to be if you want me to die if you want me to leave if you want me to sing if one twin to shout if you wanted me to dress I mean dressed like an old lady praise God hallelujah I rather dress like an old lady and not half since recorded on me then dressing like a cute young demon and having contamination in heaven on my on my book of life amen you rather be a consecrated young man consider your life to the Lord be called old fashioned than than to go into drinking and smoking and doing things that you're going to pay a price for down the road amen so you have to make a choice that the Lord is my just like Joshua said as for me and my house we will serve the Lord this is your house nobody can tell you what you should do to this house so this house is Jesus Christ amen this house is for the pillo fire consumed me and create yourself in me destroy the old person and bring Christ in my life amen and in the future when the Lord has finished with you he has molded you he put a curse on you when you are walking before wondering who is this man who is this young lady with this young man there's something about them Christ Christ they can smell Jesus Christ in you when you speak they could see there's something behind the voice this is not just a human being this is a deity in him this antenna presses speaking so let go of the world and let Christ
