[25:34] Sister Abby to come and give us a
[25:37] special
[25:39] [Applause]
[25:47] God bless you. Um, okay. So, I was
[25:50] requested to sing one of my songs by
[25:53] brother Simba. Sorry. But um I'm going
[25:57] to sing this song
[26:00] from a week after the Bethl youth camp
[26:03] which was last year. Um the preacher had
[26:07] I forgot what his name was. He had said
[26:09] a testimony about something and he was
[26:13] saying that there was the devil or a
[26:16] demon had came into his room broad
[26:18] daylight and pointed a like pointed like
[26:21] a finger at him and was like I'm coming
[26:24] after you. But then he said that he said
[26:26] that um I speak that in the name of
[26:29] Jesus I cast thee out Satan. And he was
[26:32] like and then the demon went away. So
[26:34] for a week that bothered me. It was a
[26:36] testimony but it bothered me. And um I
[26:40] was couldn't sleep for like an entire
[26:42] week. I would go to sleep and just think
[26:45] that that thing was going to pop up in
[26:47] my room any moment and I would and I
[26:50] wouldn't know what to do. So I went, it
[26:54] was it happened for a week. The week
[26:56] after on a Wednesday, I was here. I was
[26:58] sitting back at the computer and I
[27:01] opened up my Bible cuz my dad was like,
[27:03] "Read your Bible before you go to
[27:05] church, before the service starts
[27:06] because then you'll it'll connect with
[27:09] the service." And I was like, "Okay,
[27:10] whatever." Um, so I opened up my Bible
[27:14] and I opened up to Psalms 3 or Proverbs
[27:17] 3 and it said that your sleep shall be
[27:21] sweet. And after I read that, I slept
[27:23] perfect for the rest of so that song.
[27:28] Amen. And I was talking to my dad and I
[27:31] told him about it and he was like it was
[27:34] it's that you're growing in God. That's
[27:35] what you got like that revelation. So
[27:37] you're growing in God. So I was like,
[27:39] "Okay, well that's a song." And I wrote
[27:41] a song about it. All right.
[27:45] The devil tried to take away my peace.
[27:48] He tried to take away my rest. But God
[27:54] told me, "Your sleep shall be sweet."
[28:00] Amen. The devil tried to give me a
[28:03] spirit of fear. He tried to tell me
[28:06] you're alone, but God told
[28:11] me I'm there in present time of
[28:15] need. Say I'm growing in the
[28:19] Lord. I'm growing in
[28:24] God. It may not seem like
[28:27] much, but to me it's a lot. I'm growing
[28:33] in God.

[28:40] peace. He tried to tell me you're alone,
[28:45] but God told
[28:47] me. I'm there in present time of
[28:51] need. Say I'm growing in the
[28:56] Lord. I'm growing in God.

[42:19] season. Oh, and all the days
[42:25] on away from the mar
[42:30] and away from the clay.
[42:36] [Music]

[42:52] glory.

[43:56] blood.
[43:58] Through the
[44:00] blood we can
[44:03] come into his
[44:06] presence. Oh, it's
[44:09] through the blood.
[44:13] Oh

[44:19] made a
[44:22] way we can come into his

[49:55] Friday night there. Um Brother Nichols

[50:01] did the song service and he started
[50:03] singing that over. I say, "Well, my I

[52:33] just so happy to see uh all these these
[52:36] different doors of opening up. Amen. For
[52:38] for our precious brethren, uh God is
[52:42] moving in his own special way. Praise
[52:45] the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the
[52:47] Lord. Amen. All right. Well, um I don't
[52:51] think I need to announce any more. Uh
[52:54] I'll read one quick scripture.
[52:57] Musicians, thank y'all very much. Amen.
[53:02] Thank y'all very very much. Uh, and I'm
[53:05] I'mma ask a question while I was just
[53:09] talking there. Uh, did you all hear um
[53:14] uh Sister Hadassa playing the piano? Did
[53:18] you all hear it? Okay. All right. That's
[53:22] going to go with my sermon here. Uh, but
[53:24] I just need to make sure you all heard
[53:26] it. Amen. Uh, and from the back, you
[53:30] might not have been able to see what
[53:32] notes she was playing. Uh, so you
[53:34] couldn't necessarily tell that she was
[53:37] playing by what you saw, but because of
[53:40] your hearing, you did hear it. Right. Is
[53:45] that right? Okay. All right. So, I'm
[53:47] glad we all heard it. One scripture that
[53:50] we'll read, Amen. on this morning is
[53:53] coming from the book of
[53:55] numbers and it is found in uh chapter uh
[54:01] 11 and it's verse
[54:05] 23. Praise the
[54:12] Lord. Uh numbers
[54:15] 11 and
[54:19] 23. Praise God.
[54:22] Let's see
[54:25] here. It says, "And the Lord said unto
[54:29] Moses, is the Lord's hand waxed
[54:34] short? Thou shalt see now whether my
[54:38] word shall come to pass unto thee or
[54:41] not." Let's pray over the scripture.
[54:46] Father, we are grateful
[54:49] for the ability to read the word and
[54:53] um what we read often times is things
[54:57] that have already happened on the earth
[55:00] us and and we're looking at the
[55:02] testimonies and and things that you have
[55:05] done. But because you are the same
[55:08] yesterday, today, and forever, then we
[55:10] can bring forward the things that you
[55:13] did and bring them into present tense to
[55:16] see how you will do now. So God, we ask
[55:19] that you would uh bless um um this the
[55:23] reading of the word as we've read it,
[55:25] but now give inspiration from it and uh
[55:28] Lord, minister to our hearts and to our
[55:31] needs and our conditions, our situations
[55:33] and circumstances. Our sister Vera is in
[55:37] need of uh a a touch. Her family is in
[55:41] need of a touch that only you can
[55:43] provide. You are a great comforter and
[55:46] we're asking that you would just
[55:47] intervene on their behalf in the loss of
[55:50] this loved one. Uh God, through this
[55:53] death, may somebody receive life. And uh
[55:56] we trust, oh God, that somehow someway
[55:59] uh people would come to know Jesus. We
[56:02] all must prepare for this. And if we're
[56:05] not ready for a rapture, this is this is
[56:08] um uh the scripture says it's appointed
[56:10] unto man once to die, but after that
[56:12] judgment. So God, we're praying that
[56:15] somehow you use this for your glory and
[56:16] for your honor. Give strength to this
[56:18] family, Lord, during during their time
[56:20] of bereavement. Touch those that are not
[56:22] able to be with us today. Look, remember
[56:24] our precious sister Dixon, God, that you
[56:27] would just continue to strengthen her
[56:28] and also Shantara. We ask that you
[56:31] remember her as well. Uh and God just
[56:34] just move on the needs of your people.
[56:36] It's in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen.
[56:40] God bless you. You can be
[56:42] seated. Praise the Lord. I have a very
[56:45] simple title. Amen. on today and I want
[56:50] I was just reading this scripture um a
[56:53] few weeks ago in our daily reading and
[56:57] um and as I read it uh the word that
[57:00] jumped out uh to me was now now
[57:06] uh and that's our title uh the L the
[57:09] Lord spoke to Moses and said thou shalt
[57:11] see now
[57:14] uh whether my word shall come to as unto
[57:18] thee, thou shalt see now. Now, amen. So,
[57:23] just bear with me as we make our way
[57:25] through this thought here today. Uh
[57:28] we're speaking on now here in the
[57:31] sermon, the angel of God. Uh the prophet
[57:37] makes a statement. And he says, "And
[57:38] understand now the angel of God sometime
[57:43] sometimes when a blessing is pronounced
[57:46] upon you." Sometimes when a blessing is
[57:50] pronounced upon you, he may not uh he
[57:55] may not be that he can get to you right
[57:58] then. It might not be just instant
[58:02] healing.
[58:03] Amen. He says, "But as you believe, a as
[58:07] you believe, your faith will make you
[58:09] whole." Some people have
[58:12] spontaneous faith. That's what I call
[58:15] now faith. Amen. Some people have
[58:17] spontaneous faith, great faith that
[58:20] deep. That's a miracle. Some of them
[58:23] have faith about that deep. It'll take a
[58:26] little while, right? But some has
[58:28] mustard seed faith. Uh very little. But
[58:32] just say but but just stay with it.
[58:34] It'll bring you out. It it'll
[58:37] materialize. I I like that. It it it'll
[58:40] materialize. It says uh when God spoke
[58:43] the dirt that you set over tonight,
[58:46] that's God's word. God just said, "Let
[58:48] there be." And his word materialized. Is
[58:53] that true? So God believed in his own
[58:54] word. Amen. He says, "Uh where where did
[58:57] he get that dirt?" Amen. And if it
[59:00] wasn't, he just spoke it. And it's and
[59:02] it's God's materialized word formed the
[59:05] earth that you set on. Oh, how
[59:07] wonderful. How fastf finding. Now, it's
[59:10] by faith that we believe him. God
[59:13] believed his own word. Amen. And it
[59:17] formed the word if we had time to go
[59:19] into those things. And I I like I like
[59:21] that that God believed his own word
[59:23] because uh what was in God is also
[59:25] inside of us. Amen. And so, so, so when
[59:28] we speak a word uh by inspiration that
[59:31] God has given us, we got to believe
[59:33] that. We got to hold on to it until that
[59:35] word comes to pass. It will
[59:39] materialize. Amen. It will
[59:43] materialize. I'm saying that again. It
[59:47] will
[59:49] materialize. Those things that you spoke
[59:51] over your
[59:52] business, it will materialize. Those
[59:56] things that you spoke over your body, it
[59:59] will materialize. Those things that you
[1:00:02] spoke over your
[1:00:04] family, it will materialize.
[1:00:08] Hallelujah. Glory to God. It will
[1:00:11] materialize. I don't care how long it
[1:00:13] take, it will come to pass.
[1:00:17] Amen.
[1:00:19] Amen. I believe that uh from the from
[1:00:22] that time, the prophet makes a statement
[1:00:24] here. It says uh in 25 years later uh he
[1:00:29] was 100 and she was 90. How are you
[1:00:33] feeling now dear? It says no different.
[1:00:36] Glory to God. Will have it anyhow.
[1:00:39] Greater miracle now than it was at the
[1:00:43] beginning. Just 25 years. So the longer
[1:00:46] you have to wait for it then the greater
[1:00:49] the miracle. Amen.
[1:00:52] Ah, I like that. The longer we have to
[1:00:56] wait for it, then the greater the
[1:00:58] miracle. Hallelujah. Oh, God, get ready
[1:01:00] to do something special.
[1:01:04] Oh, hallelujah. He said, he says,
[1:01:06] "Greater miracle now than it was at the
[1:01:10] beginning, just 25 years, but we claim
[1:01:13] to be the seed of Abraham." And if God
[1:01:16] doesn't instantly heal us, we say,
[1:01:18] "Well, I missed my healing." And then uh
[1:01:21] and then say, "We are the seed of
[1:01:23] Abraham." Abraham's seed takes God at
[1:01:26] his word and holds on to it. They meet
[1:01:30] God on the conditions and say, "Here it
[1:01:32] is. Father, it's settled right here
[1:01:34] tonight." Amen. That's the way the real
[1:01:37] seed of Abraham. Nothing can move them
[1:01:40] from it. No hurts, no pains, no aches,
[1:01:44] no nothing else, no doctor, 10,000,
[1:01:49] amen, can stand on and say you're dying.
[1:01:52] You say it's not so. Glory to God. See,
[1:01:55] they refuse. They refuse to hear
[1:01:57] anything else when you meet God. Yes,
[1:02:00] sir. Oh my God. My God. My God. We pray
[1:02:05] somebody will meet him today.
[1:02:07] Amen. Amen. Amen. It'll change how you
[1:02:10] talk. It'll change how you think when
[1:02:12] you come in contact with him. No matter
[1:02:14] what anybody else is saying, I heard
[1:02:16] from
[1:02:17] God. Amen. And that's all I need to hear
[1:02:20] from. One word from the Lord changes
[1:02:22] everything.
[1:02:23] Oh, praise the name of the Lord. So, uh
[1:02:26] here is um this little quote that I want
[1:02:29] to uh interject. I was asking, did you
[1:02:32] hear uh Sister Hadassa playing while I
[1:02:34] was talking? And everybody say yes, I
[1:02:37] heard it. So the first thing you ought
[1:02:39] to be is grateful that you have the
[1:02:40] ability to hear.
[1:02:43] Amen. Even if you couldn't see her
[1:02:45] playing the notes, you heard. Amen. And
[1:02:48] and and and and I believe we heard on on
[1:02:50] Wednesday night, I heard by the hearing
[1:02:52] of the ear, but now I see. I heard of
[1:02:56] thee by the hearing of the ear. I I
[1:02:58] heard of the things that you could do.
[1:03:00] Glory to God. But now I see. Amen. and
[1:03:04] and and the and and and brother Thomas
[1:03:06] was trying to tell us we we got to move
[1:03:07] from just hearing to actually seeing.
[1:03:11] When we go from hearing to seeing, not
[1:03:13] hearing about what God can do, but when
[1:03:15] we see what God has done, Amen. we move
[1:03:19] from a future tense, we move to now.
[1:03:23] Glory. And that's where I want to go is
[1:03:25] to now. Yes, sir.
[1:03:29] Amen. Bring me Bring me to now, Father.
[1:03:33] All right. In the message experiences,
[1:03:35] he says this, uh, but I, but could I be
[1:03:37] wrong there? He says, "Sure, I could. I
[1:03:40] could be colorblind." He's talking about
[1:03:42] a brother that, you know, he's trying to
[1:03:44] get the people to, uh, uh, uh, lift
[1:03:46] their faith and he's, you know, say,
[1:03:47] "This brother got a certain color suit
[1:03:49] on, a certain color shirt." He says, "I
[1:03:50] could be wrong there. Uh, I could be
[1:03:52] colorblind." He says, "The coat, you
[1:03:54] could be colorblind, uh, sir. You, you
[1:03:56] might." He says, "It might be altogether
[1:03:58] different. He might not have on a white
[1:04:00] shirt. Uh but you but you swear by that
[1:04:02] and and and and uh am I and I and I feel
[1:04:06] him. I say he's standing there be
[1:04:08] because I feel him. See I I could be
[1:04:11] wrong against that. But yet I know it.
[1:04:14] Just believe it with all my heart that
[1:04:16] he's standing there because the sense of
[1:04:18] feeling says he's there. The sense of
[1:04:22] feeling says he's there. Says now I want
[1:04:26] you to notice. Walk over there to the
[1:04:28] piano. I have another sense. He says, I
[1:04:31] want you to notice this. He says, up and
[1:04:33] down on the note a brother plays notes
[1:04:36] on the piano. I hear music. There's
[1:04:38] music in the room. Amen. Just keep
[1:04:41] hitting them, brother. Just hitting up
[1:04:44] and down on the keys. Any anywhere
[1:04:46] there. How many hears that? Glory to
[1:04:50] God. And I should say, how many heard
[1:04:51] that when sister uh Das play? How many
[1:04:54] heard that? Says, how many knows that,
[1:04:56] sister? Do do I see it? Do I feel it? I
[1:04:59] don't feel it and I don't see it. He
[1:05:01] says, "Do I taste it?" No. He says, he
[1:05:03] says, "Uh, smell it?" No. But how do I
[1:05:06] know it's playing there? I hear it.
[1:05:09] Amen. It's a sense of hearing. See, now
[1:05:13] I know someone say, "You don't hear
[1:05:15] that." Yes, I do. Amen. Glory to God.
[1:05:20] You Somebody say, "You don't hear." Yes,
[1:05:22] I do. Says, "Play it again, brother. I
[1:05:25] know I do." Don't you? Why? You hear it.
[1:05:28] You don't see it, but you hear it. You
[1:05:30] can't see music, can you? You can't
[1:05:33] taste music, feel music, can you? But
[1:05:37] you know it's music. You hear it. That's
[1:05:40] right. Well, brother, faith is the
[1:05:43] substance of things hoped for. the
[1:05:46] evidence of things you don't see, things
[1:05:50] you don't taste, things you don't feel,
[1:05:53] things you don't smell, things you don't
[1:05:56] hear, but you know it's a faith.
[1:06:02] Praise God. In the same way, Amen. that
[1:06:05] you can hear the sister playing even
[1:06:07] though you could not see it and you
[1:06:09] couldn't smell and you couldn't taste it
[1:06:11] and you couldn't feel it, you heard it.
[1:06:13] And by by hearing it, you know there is
[1:06:15] music in the room. Glory to God. And
[1:06:18] faith is the same amen type of sense
[1:06:21] that you have. It's a sick sense. And
[1:06:24] even when you can't feel it, when you
[1:06:26] can't see it, when you can't hear it,
[1:06:29] praise God. When you can't taste it,
[1:06:32] glory to God, when you can't smell it,
[1:06:34] still something on the inside of you
[1:06:36] tells you is there.
[1:06:40] Praise God. I say God going to do it
[1:06:43] now. Hey, I feel it now. I hear it now.
[1:06:48] I see it now. Praise God.
[1:06:52] [Applause]
[1:06:54] Glory to God. Our faith has got to
[1:06:56] elevate to believe God for the
[1:06:59] impossible. We don't have to keep
[1:07:01] putting things off into the future.
[1:07:03] Let's look for a now God
[1:07:07] because he is a now God.
[1:07:10] [Music]
[1:07:12] [Applause]
[1:07:14] Glory. Hallelujah. He says, "Oh, God
[1:07:17] bless your hearts. I wish I could get
[1:07:20] you to see it." Look at here, friends.
[1:07:23] It's positive.
[1:07:25] Amen. It's that it's Is that shirt
[1:07:27] white? Well, uh, healing. Well,
[1:07:30] healing's right then. If you believe the
[1:07:33] substance, not what you most people just
[1:07:36] hope. Say, "I I I believe I'll get
[1:07:38] well." It says
[1:07:41] 999 out of every thousand passes by
[1:07:44] don't know the first principle of faith.
[1:07:46] That is right. They have they have hope
[1:07:49] instead of faith because faith is
[1:07:53] positive.
[1:07:56] Faith is positive.
[1:08:00] This scripture that we were
[1:08:02] reading, Amen.
[1:08:05] um out of Numbers
[1:08:07] 11 when we when we when we when we get
[1:08:10] the context of it, uh what was happening
[1:08:13] here is God had already provided for the
[1:08:16] children of Israel. They were
[1:08:17] complaining as they were on uh in the
[1:08:20] wilderness journey on their way to the
[1:08:21] promised land and they got to a spot
[1:08:23] where they're like the people the the
[1:08:25] mixed multitude, let me put it that way.
[1:08:27] Because sometimes you get people that
[1:08:28] you done shared things with and they
[1:08:30] don't have the same faith that you have
[1:08:33] and and then they might try to start
[1:08:34] speaking certain things to you to to
[1:08:37] almost diminish your faith.
[1:08:39] Amen. Right. But but but but but uh this
[1:08:42] mixed multitude as they were gathered
[1:08:44] there, they began to long for the things
[1:08:47] they had in Egypt and and they began to
[1:08:50] think about, you know, based on what our
[1:08:53] current experience is. Amen. in this
[1:08:56] wilderness journey. It was better for us
[1:08:58] back in Egypt. And some of the people
[1:09:00] began to talk and listen to some of
[1:09:02] these things like this and they begin to
[1:09:03] say these things out loud and and like,
[1:09:05] you know, we don't even have really much
[1:09:07] to eat out here. So God provided when he
[1:09:09] heard this, God said, "Now I'm going to
[1:09:11] give you something." And when God did
[1:09:13] it, let me tell you, God did it in the
[1:09:15] now. He didn't It wasn't a a a future
[1:09:17] tense. Y'all need something to eat? I'm
[1:09:20] in the morning. Praise God. when you
[1:09:22] wake up. You're going to see some frost
[1:09:24] all over the ground. That's for you to
[1:09:26] eat. Right. I mean, and God God provided
[1:09:29] their needs right then. That's right.
[1:09:32] Glory to God. But here's the problem
[1:09:34] that they got so used and so
[1:09:36] comfortable, Amen. to eating what God uh
[1:09:39] uh this mana that God provided. And and
[1:09:41] and then they got to complaining about
[1:09:43] the mana. Now, now here's the problem.
[1:09:46] Because sometimes God has done certain
[1:09:48] things for us and we get comfortable
[1:09:50] with the blessing. Oh hallelujah
[1:09:53] somebody. We get so comfortable we
[1:09:56] forget where that blessing came from.
[1:09:58] Amen. So we get very comfortable and
[1:10:01] next thing you know we go to complain
[1:10:02] and and this what happened to the
[1:10:04] children of Israel. They got complaining
[1:10:05] about the mana that God was providing
[1:10:07] daily for their needs. Lord have mercy.
[1:10:10] Amen. So Moses takes a request because
[1:10:14] the complain is like is all is is this
[1:10:16] all we got is is mana. Is this all we
[1:10:20] got is just mana. It says because uh you
[1:10:23] know this this this ain't enough for us.
[1:10:26] They said we want some meat.
[1:10:29] Jesus. They say okay you want some meat.
[1:10:32] Say I got something for you. And this is
[1:10:34] where he responds to Moses in prayer.
[1:10:36] And in verse 23, uh, Numbers 11:23 says,
[1:10:39] "And the Lord said unto
[1:10:41] Moses, is the Lord hand waxed short?" I
[1:10:47] mean, do do you have a need that God
[1:10:48] cannot provide?
[1:10:51] Is the Lord hand waxed short? It says,
[1:10:56] "Thou shalt see." Oh my my my my. When
[1:10:59] you get God so upset that he wants to
[1:11:02] move in now,
[1:11:04] thou shalt see now. I done heard all
[1:11:07] your complaining. I done heard all your
[1:11:09] doubt and and all your, you know, all
[1:11:11] these things you've been saying, but you
[1:11:13] thou shalt see
[1:11:15] now whether my word shall come to pass
[1:11:19] unto thee or not. What promise has God
[1:11:22] made you? Hallelujah. I'm here today to
[1:11:26] tell you that God says, "Thou shalt see
[1:11:30] now.
[1:11:33] Hallelujah. I receive that.
[1:11:36] Thou shalt see now." And when God made
[1:11:40] this promise. Amen. The rest of the
[1:11:42] chapter shows how God the next morning
[1:11:44] God allowed quails to come down. Amen.
[1:11:47] And the people found quail, they had so
[1:11:49] much meat,
[1:11:52] an overflow of meat.
[1:11:54] The meat. They had so much meat. God
[1:11:56] said, "You going to have so much meat.
[1:11:58] You going to eat so much meat that meat
[1:12:00] going to come out your nose,
[1:12:03] brother. That's that's a lot of meat."
[1:12:08] But but let me tell you something. Don't
[1:12:10] play with God. When when it comes to his
[1:12:13] word, my God, Brother Brandham say he'll
[1:12:16] bankrupt heaven before he allow his word
[1:12:19] not to come to pass.
[1:12:22] When God starts moving in now,
[1:12:26] we start having overflow. Hallelujah.
[1:12:28] Amen. Hallelujah. I was looking at this
[1:12:31] and I and I'm expecting I'm expecting
[1:12:34] now. Now, I know there's some sometimes
[1:12:36] it's spontaneous blessings and sometimes
[1:12:39] a span of time. No matter what, God
[1:12:41] going to move. But even when the when
[1:12:43] the span of time miracle comes to pass,
[1:12:46] it has just moved to now.
[1:12:51] Amen. It's no longer future work, but
[1:12:53] it's move. It just moved to now. Amen.
[1:12:56] Now, look at this. Uh I was looking at
[1:12:59] the definition for this word now, and it
[1:13:02] means at the present time, it's uh it's
[1:13:06] it's the present time or the present
[1:13:08] moment. Like you are sitting in church
[1:13:10] now, right? This is the present time.
[1:13:13] Says, uh maybe somebody's watching a uh
[1:13:16] uh uh watching the stream. You're
[1:13:17] watching the stream now. You're in the
[1:13:19] present, right? And and the other thing
[1:13:21] about this this when another definition
[1:13:23] for the word now is without further
[1:13:26] delay.
[1:13:29] When we talk about now, no more delay.
[1:13:34] Hallelujah. Brother, when when Abraham
[1:13:37] and Sarah reached 25 years, they had
[1:13:39] reached now.
[1:13:41] Glory to God. No more delay.
[1:13:45] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And I believe if
[1:13:48] God would inspire a sermon like this,
[1:13:50] then we have come to this place again.
[1:13:52] We are at now. No more
[1:13:55] delay. Satan, you done tried to block
[1:13:58] this and you done tried to block that.
[1:14:00] But we kept pressing on by faith. And
[1:14:03] because we pressed on by faith, we are
[1:14:05] now walking in
[1:14:08] now. We are here at now. On the map, you
[1:14:12] want to circle. I'm right here now.
[1:14:16] Amen.
[1:14:20] Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:14:23] Glory to God. I'm not talking about
[1:14:24] where I'm going to. I'm talking about
[1:14:26] where I am. And I am in
[1:14:29] now present tense.
[1:14:33] [Applause]
[1:14:34] Glory to God. Without further delay, it
[1:14:37] says immediately,
[1:14:39] [Music]
[1:14:41] at
[1:14:42] once. Amen. and and and they got a
[1:14:45] little they got a a little example. I
[1:14:47] either do it now or don't do it at all.
[1:14:52] Amen. Sometimes you have to tell your
[1:14:54] kids that. Either get it done right now
[1:14:57] or don't do it at all. It's going to be
[1:15:00] repercussions when you don't do it at
[1:15:01] all. Glory to God.
[1:15:06] Got them dishes in the sink and I told
[1:15:08] you to wash them dishes and now you
[1:15:10] sleep in your beds. But I'm coming to
[1:15:12] get you out your bed. And I want you to
[1:15:14] get up now.
[1:15:17] Hello, somebody. Brother, when people
[1:15:20] move to now, they mean business.
[1:15:24] And when God moves to now, he mean he
[1:15:27] means business.
[1:15:33] You know, I was thinking on the story of
[1:15:37] the
[1:15:37] centurion. Amen. and and and when he
[1:15:40] sent to Jesus says, "I got a servant
[1:15:42] here that is sick and I I want him to be
[1:15:45] prayed for and and you know, I I just
[1:15:47] don't have any confidence in any of the
[1:15:49] religious leaders here, but I've heard
[1:15:51] about your ministry. I'd like for you to
[1:15:52] come pray for him. Now, I'm not worthy
[1:15:54] that I could come to you and even ask
[1:15:56] you. So, I'm sending some of your your
[1:15:58] your your fellow countrymen to come and
[1:16:00] ask you, and if you don't mind, would
[1:16:01] you come and just pray over this
[1:16:02] servant? It's not even a prayer for me,
[1:16:04] but I need you to pray over my servant
[1:16:06] cuz he just mean that much to me." And
[1:16:08] and here Jesus gets up and he heads to
[1:16:11] this man house. And as the man see the
[1:16:13] crowd coming and with Jesus, he said he
[1:16:15] runs out the house. And he says, uh, he
[1:16:17] says, you know, I'm not even worthy for
[1:16:19] you to even come under my roof. I'm just
[1:16:20] glad you come come this far. I'm glad
[1:16:23] you got to this spot that I could see
[1:16:25] and that you responded to my request. He
[1:16:27] says, but but I'm not worthy that you
[1:16:28] should come under my roof. He said, but
[1:16:30] but but here's the thing. He says, uh,
[1:16:33] I'm a man under authority.
[1:16:37] And when I when I when I when I say to a
[1:16:39] servant of mine
[1:16:41] go, he goeth. When I say to another one,
[1:16:46] "Come," he cometh. And what this man was
[1:16:49] saying is that when I say go, it's not
[1:16:52] uh I'll go when I feel like it. Uh I
[1:16:56] I'll go uh you know when I when I get up
[1:16:59] when I you know when I when I think when
[1:17:02] it when I think it's time for me to go
[1:17:04] that's when I'm he said no no no that
[1:17:06] I'm a man under authority.
[1:17:09] When I say things out of my mouth when I
[1:17:13] say I tell this man I don't care what he
[1:17:15] doing. I don't care what prayers he got.
[1:17:19] Go. That man dropped everything he doing
[1:17:23] and he goes. And then here's another
[1:17:26] man. When I say come, he drop everything
[1:17:29] he doing. He comes because these people
[1:17:32] act in now.
[1:17:35] Amen. Amen. That's right, brother. It
[1:17:38] says now if I have that type of
[1:17:40] authority over just human beings, I know
[1:17:43] you a man also under authority and you
[1:17:45] got control over spirits.
[1:17:49] Hallelujah. You control
[1:17:51] sickness. You control
[1:17:54] disease. Hallelujah. You control
[1:17:57] anything and everything I'm dealing
[1:17:59] with. So I got a servant here that is
[1:18:02] sick. I can't tell him come and tell him
[1:18:05] go. The man can't move. But I ask you to
[1:18:09] come to my house because I believe you
[1:18:11] have authority over this. And if you
[1:18:14] can't come in the house, just speak the
[1:18:17] word.
[1:18:18] Hallelujah.
[1:18:20] And hallelujah. Once the word is spoken,
[1:18:23] the man say, "I know my servant will be
[1:18:28] made whole." That man was operating in a
[1:18:31] now faith.
[1:18:34] Hey, now faith is the substance of
[1:18:37] things hoped for. Amen. The evidence of
[1:18:41] things not seen. That's what your faith
[1:18:46] is. Amen.
[1:18:49] [Applause]
[1:18:51] Jesus spoke the word and that man was
[1:18:53] healed
[1:18:56] immediately.
[1:18:58] Now,
[1:19:01] we have a God that operates in in now.
[1:19:06] Hallelujah.
[1:19:08] This word immediately is a synonym
[1:19:12] to the word now. So if you hear me using
[1:19:15] that, you understand where I'm coming
[1:19:17] from. I looked up the definition for
[1:19:20] immediately. And the other thing I need
[1:19:22] you to know about immediately, it's an
[1:19:23] it's a it's a adverb.
[1:19:27] Ver verb verb mean action.
[1:19:30] So immediately it means straightway
[1:19:35] or straight away at once.
[1:19:38] It also means right away.
[1:19:41] Right now.
[1:19:43] God, I need you to move
[1:19:46] right now.
[1:19:49] Instantly. It means now. It means
[1:19:52] directly, promptly, forth with this very
[1:19:55] minute.
[1:19:59] This this instant. Yes, sir. There and
[1:20:02] then, here and here and now.
[1:20:06] I need you to move in a flash.
[1:20:10] Immediately, it's without delay. Yes,
[1:20:11] sir. Without hesitation.
[1:20:14] Without further ado,
[1:20:18] Yes sir. It says, "Post haste, quickly,
[1:20:22] as fast as possible,
[1:20:25] fast, speedily, with all speed, as soon
[1:20:29] as possible."
[1:20:31] And then they put ASAP at the end of it.
[1:20:35] Amen. Brother, when you write ASAP, you
[1:20:37] when most people write ASAP, whenever
[1:20:39] you use ASAP,
[1:20:42] you never use it in lower case.
[1:20:46] You always use ASAP in uppercase. And
[1:20:50] when you use uppercase, it's to draw
[1:20:52] people's attention to the urgency of the
[1:20:55] matter.
[1:20:58] Oh, hallelujah. I believe somebody sent
[1:21:01] an email to heaven.
[1:21:03] God, I need you now.
[1:21:06] [Music]
[1:21:08] Glory. He knows what you're going
[1:21:10] through. He knows your situation. On
[1:21:13] your finances, he can move now. In your
[1:21:17] body, he can move now. On your job, he
[1:21:20] can move now. In your business, he can
[1:21:23] move now. In your family, he can move
[1:21:27] now.
[1:21:28] [Music]
[1:21:28] [Applause]
[1:21:30] [Music]
[1:21:32] ASAP.
[1:21:34] Woo.
[1:21:36] [Applause]
[1:21:43] I was, you know, looking at this word
[1:21:47] immediately. Just wanted to search it
[1:21:48] out and I found that uh you never find
[1:21:52] the word immediately even in the Old
[1:21:55] Testament.
[1:21:56] It's a New Testament word.
[1:21:59] Now, God did through things immediately
[1:22:01] in the Old Testament. We know he did
[1:22:03] that. But, but the word just wasn't
[1:22:04] found there. He did some now things. I
[1:22:06] just read you how he told Ma Moses, you
[1:22:09] going you going you thou shalt see now.
[1:22:12] That's an immediate, right? You're going
[1:22:14] to see now whether whether my word shall
[1:22:17] come to pass unto thee or not. You're
[1:22:19] going to see it now. Oh, I'm receiving
[1:22:22] this.
[1:22:24] This ain't for y'all. This for me. This
[1:22:26] one for me. I'm preaching to me today.
[1:22:29] Amen. I'm I I mean, he he told me, I'm
[1:22:32] I'm going to re I'm going to rejoice
[1:22:34] over you to do you good. I'm going to
[1:22:37] plant you in the land assuredly.
[1:22:40] [Applause]
[1:22:42] And and maybe I could respond say,
[1:22:44] "Lord, when you going to do it?" His
[1:22:45] response to me today would be
[1:22:50] now. And I say, "Amen.
[1:22:53] God, I receive it.
[1:22:56] [Applause]
[1:22:59] I'm looking for change. Now, you ought
[1:23:02] to get tired of seeing the devil just do
[1:23:04] whatever he want to do when he want to
[1:23:07] do it. No, Satan. I'm putting a stop to
[1:23:10] that today. I'm putting a stop to it
[1:23:12] right now.
[1:23:16] [Music]
[1:23:17] [Applause]
[1:23:22] [Applause]
[1:23:24] As I search for this word immediately,
[1:23:26] Amen. in scripture. I found so many
[1:23:29] verses in the New Testament where this
[1:23:32] word is found and I could not read all
[1:23:34] of them today. But what I did want to do
[1:23:37] is take the word immediately at least
[1:23:39] out of the four gospels at least one
[1:23:40] situation out of the four gospels where
[1:23:43] God moved. Now all right
[1:23:46] Matthew
[1:23:48] 8 verse
[1:23:50] 2-4 the Bible says and behold there came
[1:23:54] a leper and worship worshiped him saying
[1:23:58] Lord if thou wilt thou can't make me
[1:24:03] clean and Jesus put forth his hand and
[1:24:07] touched him saying I
[1:24:09] will be thou
[1:24:11] clean and immediately mediately.
[1:24:15] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. This man
[1:24:17] can situation changed now.
[1:24:21] And immediately his leprosy was
[1:24:24] cleansed. Amen. And look at this now.
[1:24:27] And Jesus said unto him, see thou tell
[1:24:30] no man,
[1:24:32] but go thy way, show thyself to the
[1:24:36] priests, and offer the gift that Moses
[1:24:38] commanded for a testimony unto them.
[1:24:40] Now, now, now here, this man has just
[1:24:42] been healed of leprosy. Everybody else
[1:24:44] know he got leprosy.
[1:24:47] How is it that he can tell nobody,
[1:24:49] right? The testimony was already
[1:24:51] speaking for itself.
[1:24:54] And just by walking through the city,
[1:24:56] the people knew, ain't this a guy that
[1:24:57] was outside the city cuz he had leprosy.
[1:24:59] They knew something happened to him. He
[1:25:01] said, "But don't don't stop and testify
[1:25:02] to nobody. Go straight to the priests."
[1:25:05] And when you get that to them priests,
[1:25:07] offer the same thing that Moses offer.
[1:25:09] And then they would have to identify
[1:25:10] that this man had been healed.
[1:25:13] Yes, sir. The priest would have to have
[1:25:16] to do it, you know. But but I love the
[1:25:17] fact that when Jesus touched him, he was
[1:25:20] healed. Immediately. Woo. Glory to God.
[1:25:24] We serve an immediate God.
[1:25:27] Hallelujah. Here's another story out of
[1:25:29] Mark chapter 2. You all are very
[1:25:32] familiar with this
[1:25:34] particular story. Amen. In the
[1:25:37] scripture, Mark chapter
[1:25:40] 2:1, the Bible says, "And again he
[1:25:43] entered into Capernaum after some
[1:25:46] days, and it was
[1:25:48] noised that he was in the house." Amen.
[1:25:51] He's here this morning. He's in the
[1:25:52] house. It was noise that he was in the
[1:25:55] house. And straightway, see, straightway
[1:25:58] is another uh immediately or now. Amen.
[1:26:03] Straight way many were gathered
[1:26:06] together. Now that that's that's the
[1:26:07] beautiful part. Now, if you want to see
[1:26:09] God do something now, you going to have
[1:26:12] to do something now.
[1:26:15] Amen. If you know, Amen. that there's a
[1:26:17] gathering at a certain place. Amen. And
[1:26:20] you know that Jesus is in that place,
[1:26:22] you can't be going somewhere else
[1:26:24] expecting God to do something. You got
[1:26:26] to go where Jesus is if you want to see
[1:26:29] him do something for you now. Amen.
[1:26:32] Amen. Straightway many were gathered
[1:26:35] together in so much that there was no
[1:26:37] room to receive them. No, not so much as
[1:26:40] about the door. And he preached the word
[1:26:42] unto them. My God. And they come unto
[1:26:46] him bringing one sick of the of of the
[1:26:49] policy which was born of four. So he got
[1:26:52] four friends carrying him to the
[1:26:54] meeting. Amen. When they could not come
[1:26:57] nigh unto him for the press because
[1:27:00] there's too many people there,
[1:27:03] they uncovered the roof where he was,
[1:27:08] brother. They came up and did something
[1:27:10] different.
[1:27:11] And you can't keep coming to church
[1:27:13] doing the same thing. Amen. And and
[1:27:15] expecting something different. You got
[1:27:17] to do something different if you want to
[1:27:19] see God do something different.
[1:27:22] Brother, when they got to church, they
[1:27:24] weren't satisfied sitting on the
[1:27:25] outside. These brothers went up to the
[1:27:28] roof where Jesus were inside and
[1:27:31] uncovered the roof.
[1:27:34] [Music]
[1:27:36] Amen. They uncovered the roof where he
[1:27:38] was. And when they had broken it up,
[1:27:42] tore up the roof, probably ain't leave
[1:27:44] no offering to fix it back either.
[1:27:49] Broke it up. They had a need, church.
[1:27:52] It says, it says they let down the bed
[1:27:55] wherein the sick of Pauly lay. Man, the
[1:27:58] need some they they meant business. When
[1:28:00] Jesus saw their faith,
[1:28:04] he said unto the sick of the policy,
[1:28:07] "Son, thy sins be forgiven thee."
[1:28:12] Oh my. But but but but there were
[1:28:14] certain of the scribes sitting there and
[1:28:16] and reasoning in their hearts, why do
[1:28:20] this man thus speak blasphemy? Who can
[1:28:23] for forgive sins but God only? Didn't
[1:28:26] realize God was in the flesh right there
[1:28:28] in their midst.
[1:28:31] Look at
[1:28:32] this. And immediately
[1:28:36] when Jesus perceived in his spirit that
[1:28:39] they so reason within themselves, he
[1:28:42] said unto them, why reason ye these
[1:28:44] things in your hearts? Right? Whether it
[1:28:47] is easier to say to the sick of the
[1:28:50] policy, thy sins be forgiven thee. Or to
[1:28:52] say, arise and take up thy bed and walk.
[1:28:56] Now, the reason Jesus could speak
[1:28:58] certain words like this is because he
[1:29:01] realized when he died on the cross, it
[1:29:03] was for a dual atonement.
[1:29:06] Amen. He died for two purposes. Oh,
[1:29:10] hallelujah. One was to bring forgiveness
[1:29:13] to your sins. Amen. But the other was to
[1:29:16] bring healing to your body.
[1:29:19] Amen. Oh my my my my my. He was wounded
[1:29:23] for my transgressions. He was bruised
[1:29:25] for my iniquities. The chastisement of
[1:29:28] my peace is upon him. And with his
[1:29:31] stripes,
[1:29:32] woo, I'm declaring it right now. Hey,
[1:29:35] I'm speaking now over my body. With his
[1:29:38] stripes, I am now healed.
[1:29:43] Glory to God.
[1:29:46] Hallelujah. Lord, I I I might not have
[1:29:49] time to get to this this spot, but I'm
[1:29:51] I'mma tell y'all something. Amen.
[1:29:54] When when God gives you a promise, he
[1:29:57] gives it to you in seed form.
[1:30:00] All right. Come on now. All right. And
[1:30:03] and and when you get a seed, you have to
[1:30:06] plant it.
[1:30:07] Come on. Hallelujah. But just because
[1:30:10] you plant it, don't mean it's going to
[1:30:12] grow. Brother, there's some other things
[1:30:15] you need to do to that seed.
[1:30:17] In order for it to get life after it has
[1:30:20] been planted, you must water it.
[1:30:24] [Music]
[1:30:26] Oh, hallelujah. That's in the natural.
[1:30:28] You have to water the seeds in order for
[1:30:31] it to grow. But when God's word, Amen,
[1:30:35] is also a seed and it comes into your
[1:30:38] heart. Brother Brandham told us the way
[1:30:40] that we water the seed, the way we bring
[1:30:44] the seed to manifestation, the way we
[1:30:46] see the seed grow is by giving God
[1:30:49] praise.
[1:30:51] Hallelujah.
[1:30:53] Oh,
[1:30:54] hallelujah. And you got to learn how to
[1:30:57] water. Amen. Every promise that God give
[1:31:00] you, water with a amen. Water with a
[1:31:03] glory to God. Water with Lord, I thank
[1:31:06] you for speaking to me. Thank you for
[1:31:09] speaking to my condition. Thank you for
[1:31:11] speaking to my situation. Lord, I'm
[1:31:14] loading with praise. I ain't waiting to
[1:31:16] feel nothing. I ain't waiting to see
[1:31:19] nothing. I got the word and that's all I
[1:31:22] need. Glory to God. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:31:26] Lord, I praise you. Water the promises
[1:31:29] with praises.
[1:31:32] [Applause]
[1:31:35] Oh,
[1:31:35] glory. Hallelujah.
[1:31:38] [Applause]
[1:31:41] Hallelujah. Glory.
[1:31:43] [Applause]
[1:31:45] Amen. You keep working. It's going to
[1:31:48] materialize. It's going to manifest.
[1:31:52] [Applause]
[1:31:57] Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:31:59] Amen. The the the scripture goes on to
[1:32:01] say in verse 10, I believe. Amen. It
[1:32:04] says, "But that you may know
[1:32:07] that the son of man hath power on earth
[1:32:11] to forgive sins. He said to the sick of
[1:32:14] apostul, I say unto thee,
[1:32:19] arise and take up thy bed and go thy way
[1:32:23] into thine house. Now look, if that man
[1:32:27] uh would not have received that now
[1:32:29] word,
[1:32:31] oh my God, you know, sister Ashley got a
[1:32:34] a blessing over over something like
[1:32:36] this. You know, uh, brother Brandham had
[1:32:39] a lady come through the prayer line and
[1:32:41] he told her, say, "Now, sis, do this, do
[1:32:43] that, do this, and and she didn't do
[1:32:44] it." And he said, "Now, because you
[1:32:47] didn't do it, you you just missed your
[1:32:48] blessing." Mhm. Well, another lady came
[1:32:51] through the prayer line a little bit
[1:32:52] after had the same condition and brother
[1:32:54] Brandham told her something to do. She
[1:32:56] did it immediately. That's right. She
[1:32:58] moved into now.
[1:33:00] Right. And when she moved there, say
[1:33:02] every she got she got to bless
[1:33:03] everything she was looking for from God,
[1:33:05] she got it that at that moment because
[1:33:07] she moved amen into now. And look, if
[1:33:09] you going to re if you want to receive
[1:33:12] now, you got to move to now.
[1:33:18] And and this brother's move from now was
[1:33:21] take up your bed. That mean you got to
[1:33:23] get out this bed, brother. I I don't I
[1:33:26] mean I don't I don't know how he got
[1:33:27] out, but he got out based on what Jesus
[1:33:29] told him. And and I just have a feeling
[1:33:32] that if you told me to get out, you
[1:33:33] going to uphold me. You going to do
[1:33:34] something to keep me going because you
[1:33:36] the one told me. And and this actually
[1:33:39] look by you telling me this in front of
[1:33:41] all these people, if this thing don't
[1:33:42] come to pass, that's on you.
[1:33:47] So, I'mma move by faith. I'mma get up
[1:33:50] out my C.
[1:33:53] Glory to God. And I'mma walk out of
[1:33:56] here. I'mma carry my bed home.
[1:33:59] The man moved into now.
[1:34:06] Amen. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. I say unto
[1:34:09] thee, arise and take up thy bed, and go
[1:34:11] thy way into thine own house. And look
[1:34:12] at this. and immediately.
[1:34:16] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:34:19] That mean when when when it's immediate,
[1:34:22] I'm not thinking. I'm not processing in
[1:34:24] my mind. Now, what if this don't work?
[1:34:27] And what about this? And what about
[1:34:30] that? And you got your calculator out.
[1:34:32] You're trying to calculate all these
[1:34:34] things.
[1:34:36] God will blow your calculator up.
[1:34:41] Hallelujah. Your calculator ain't acting
[1:34:43] in now. Your calculator acting in the
[1:34:46] future. Oh my. You know when you move in
[1:34:49] overflow, you don't even pull out your
[1:34:50] calculator.
[1:34:53] [Music]
[1:34:53] [Applause]
[1:34:58] And now brings us to overflow.
[1:35:01] Hallelujah.
[1:35:02] [Music]
[1:35:04] Oh Jesus. Amen. My God. You think Bill
[1:35:07] Gates is calculating?
[1:35:10] Lord. Amen.
[1:35:13] Amen. Not the way I'm calculating.
[1:35:18] He think about how much I'm going to put
[1:35:19] in savings and how much I'm going to put
[1:35:22] in investment and that's that's a
[1:35:24] different type of calculation. That's
[1:35:26] not well I got to pay this and then I
[1:35:28] got to pay that and I got to see how
[1:35:29] much. No, that's not now.
[1:35:33] That was then, but I'm talking about
[1:35:35] now.
[1:35:37] Hallelujah.
[1:35:39] Hallelujah. Amen. And immediately he
[1:35:42] arose,
[1:35:43] took up the bed, and went forth before
[1:35:46] them all in so much that they were all
[1:35:48] amazed and glorified God, saying, "We
[1:35:51] never
[1:35:52] saw it on this fashion." Lord, I want to
[1:35:56] say the same thing.
[1:36:00] God, you done so much. I ain't never
[1:36:03] seen it like this.
[1:36:07] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:36:11] Amen. Thank you, Lord. This word
[1:36:14] immediately is found also in Luke
[1:36:16] 4:38 through
[1:36:18] 40 says, "And he
[1:36:22] arose out of the synagogue and entered
[1:36:25] into Simon's
[1:36:27] house. And Simon's wife's mother was
[1:36:32] taken with a great fever, and they
[1:36:35] besought him for her.
[1:36:38] And he stood over
[1:36:40] her and rebuked the
[1:36:46] fever. When he rebuked it, guess what it
[1:36:49] did? And it left her. I rebuke sickness
[1:36:54] in the name of Jesus.
[1:36:56] [Music]
[1:36:57] I rebuke it right now in the name of
[1:36:59] Jesus. Amen. Amen.
[1:37:03] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:37:08] Every pain, I rebuke it in the name of
[1:37:10] Jesus. That ain't how God made my body
[1:37:13] to operate. I rebuke it in the name of
[1:37:15] Jesus. I'm standing over just like Jesus
[1:37:18] stood over Peter's brother-in-law. I
[1:37:19] rebuke it in the name of Jesus.
[1:37:23] Whatever it is, I rebuke it. If it's out
[1:37:26] of God's normal operating pattern, I
[1:37:28] rebuke it
[1:37:31] in the name of Jesus.
[1:37:39] And he stood over her and rebuked the
[1:37:41] fever and it left her and immediately
[1:37:47] she arose and ministered unto them.
[1:37:50] Amen. I remember brother Wesco used to
[1:37:53] say one time he was feeling really sick
[1:37:56] and um and you know and he was you know
[1:37:59] just really moping around the house just
[1:38:01] sick and and uh and he just but he
[1:38:04] always had a confession of faith. By his
[1:38:07] stripes I'm healed by and he just kept
[1:38:08] saying it and no matter what his body
[1:38:10] was feeling like brother Wesco just kept
[1:38:12] speaking faith. Then he say uh something
[1:38:15] spoke to him. He say if you believe that
[1:38:16] you're healed why you still in these
[1:38:18] clothes in your house like this?
[1:38:20] Yeah. Get out your get out get out your
[1:38:22] pajamas, put on some clothes and go to
[1:38:24] Dunkin' Donuts
[1:38:27] because he like going to Dunkin Donuts.
[1:38:30] And he got up out of there and went to
[1:38:31] Dunkin Donuts and grabbed what he wanted
[1:38:33] to eat and and his body came in line
[1:38:35] with his confession.
[1:38:38] Brother, we not talking about nobody
[1:38:39] that live back in Bible days. We had a
[1:38:40] we had a present day witness. Brother
[1:38:43] Wesco is a man of faith. Sister Wesco,
[1:38:45] woman of faith. We we seen how God
[1:38:47] operated in their lives. Amen. We ought
[1:38:50] to believe God for the impossible. Amen.
[1:38:53] Amen. Amen. Immediately she arose and
[1:38:56] minister unto them. So when you when you
[1:38:58] move to now, it it's one thing to just
[1:39:01] agree with now, but it's another thing
[1:39:03] to move to now. You begin to operate
[1:39:08] differently. You begin to talk
[1:39:10] differently. Amen. You begin to think
[1:39:12] differently. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:39:17] Amen. Immediately she arose and
[1:39:19] ministered unto them. And now when the
[1:39:21] sun was setting all, and look at this,
[1:39:23] when the sun was setting, after they
[1:39:24] heard this testimony, when the sun was
[1:39:25] setting, all they that had any sick with
[1:39:30] diverse diseases. Now, this was just a
[1:39:32] fever. But now they bringing anything.
[1:39:33] If a if God can do that for a fever,
[1:39:37] they bring everything. Yes, sir. I'm
[1:39:40] talking about the ones that the doctors
[1:39:41] don't even have a name for.
[1:39:44] We never seen this before. Bring it to
[1:39:46] Jesus.
[1:39:48] That's right. Yes, sir. When the sun was
[1:39:50] setting, all they that had any sick with
[1:39:53] diverous diseases brought them unto him,
[1:39:56] and he laid his hands on every one of
[1:39:59] them and healed them.
[1:40:02] Brother, these were people that moved to
[1:40:05] now.
[1:40:07] And here's the thing. The reason that
[1:40:08] they did it then because Jesus was there
[1:40:13] now. He might not be here tomorrow. All
[1:40:16] right. He might not be here next week. I
[1:40:19] don't know when he coming back to this
[1:40:20] city, but since he here now, I'm going
[1:40:23] to do some now things.
[1:40:26] I'm going to get my sick and I'm
[1:40:28] bringing him to the house of the Lord.
[1:40:30] Amen. I'm I whatever my burden is, I'm
[1:40:32] bringing it to lay it at his feet. Yes,
[1:40:34] sir. I know you I I know the doctor gave
[1:40:36] up on you, but I got I got good news.
[1:40:39] Jesus is here.
[1:40:42] Amen. All kind of diseases will heal.
[1:40:45] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. John
[1:40:50] 11. This is a
[1:40:53] story of Lazarus.
[1:40:57] And the story of Lazarus. We know
[1:41:00] that Lazarus was sick. The sisters sent
[1:41:05] word to Jesus to say, "Please come. You
[1:41:07] know, our brother's sick and you know
[1:41:08] the one that you love. please come and
[1:41:11] do something about this because we
[1:41:12] realize if you get here Jesus, right?
[1:41:15] This thing is done. All right. I don't
[1:41:17] care what they said. I I know if Jesus
[1:41:19] show up, this thing is done. And and and
[1:41:21] Jesus delayed.
[1:41:24] Not only did Lazarus get sick and he
[1:41:27] delayed, but Lazarus had already died.
[1:41:30] And Jesus still had not come. Four days
[1:41:33] has gone by. Lazarus, they don't Jesus
[1:41:35] didn't even show up to the funeral
[1:41:38] of his good friend. He couldn't show up
[1:41:40] to the funeral because life and death
[1:41:44] can't exist in the same place at the
[1:41:45] same time.
[1:41:47] So, so, so, so, so four days have gone
[1:41:50] by and they're still in grieving and
[1:41:52] people at the house and mourning and
[1:41:53] everything and Jesus found to tell the
[1:41:55] disciples, uh, hey, let's go and, uh,
[1:41:59] visit Lazarus. You know, Lazarus is
[1:42:01] sleeping. They said, he's sleeping. say
[1:42:03] that's good. We need some sleep oursel.
[1:42:06] Say if he's sleeping, he say he say
[1:42:07] said, "Don't bother now, Jesus. Just let
[1:42:09] a man sleep." Say, "No, no, y'all don't
[1:42:10] y'all don't get it. I'm I'm just I use
[1:42:12] that terminology for you, but but what
[1:42:15] I'm really trying to tell you is that
[1:42:16] Lazarus is dead
[1:42:19] and we're going to the house. Okay,
[1:42:22] we'll we'll go to the house." And get
[1:42:24] there and they're on their
[1:42:26] way. And
[1:42:28] um and when they get there, Mary and
[1:42:31] Martha being comforted by all these
[1:42:33] people, but verse 20 in in John 11 tells
[1:42:37] us something. Then Martha
[1:42:42] as soon as she heard
[1:42:44] sometime all you got to do is just
[1:42:48] hear it.
[1:42:50] Because when you hear it, then it causes
[1:42:53] you to know it. Yes. Oh, I'mma say it
[1:42:56] again. When you hear it, it causes you
[1:43:00] to know it like you heard Sister Adasa
[1:43:03] playing so nobody could tell you that
[1:43:05] you didn't hear her playing. You knew
[1:43:09] she was playing because you heard it.
[1:43:12] Hallelujah. And when God speaks a word
[1:43:14] to you in your inner man and your faith
[1:43:17] connects to it, you don't it don't
[1:43:19] matter what you hear, what you smell,
[1:43:20] what you taste, what you see, you know
[1:43:22] you got it because God gave it to you.
[1:43:25] Amen.
[1:43:28] So Martha, as soon as she heard that
[1:43:31] Jesus was coming, went and met him. She
[1:43:34] moved from where she was to where she
[1:43:37] needed to be. Went and met him. But Mary
[1:43:41] sat still in the house. Right. Then said
[1:43:45] Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou had
[1:43:47] been here,
[1:43:50] my
[1:43:51] brother had not died.
[1:43:55] But I know
[1:44:01] she's moving herself. She's she's
[1:44:04] shifting positions.
[1:44:06] But I know
[1:44:09] that even now
[1:44:14] whatsoever thou will ask of God,
[1:44:18] God will give it thee. She had no idea
[1:44:22] what she was saying.
[1:44:25] But her faith declared that, "Yeah, I
[1:44:26] know my brother been dead for 4 days,
[1:44:29] but you here now. And whatever you ask
[1:44:32] God now, God will give it to you." I got
[1:44:34] that kind of faith.
[1:44:36] Look at this. Now look at this. Look at
[1:44:37] this. Jesus said unto her, "Thy brother
[1:44:43] shall rise again." Oo. Now what? Wait a
[1:44:46] minute. Yeah. That's a That's a That's a
[1:44:48] difficult one. Now, I know I just said,
[1:44:51] "Whatever you ask God, he'll do." I
[1:44:53] wasn't thinking about that, though.
[1:44:57] See, I'm going to tell you something.
[1:44:57] God knows how to do exceedingly
[1:45:03] abundantly.
[1:45:06] above all
[1:45:08] you can ask
[1:45:11] or even think
[1:45:14] he does. God, I need one of them. One of
[1:45:18] them exceeding,
[1:45:20] one of them abundant
[1:45:23] above all I can even ask or think cuz
[1:45:27] that's the type of God you are.
[1:45:31] I need that now. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[1:45:36] Hallelujah.
[1:45:38] Martha said unto him, I know that he
[1:45:41] shall rise again in the resurrection at
[1:45:43] the last day. I believe in that.
[1:45:49] Jesus said unto her,
[1:45:52] now see this is the reason that the man
[1:45:54] needed to die because this attribute
[1:45:58] had to be expressed. The attribute of
[1:46:01] the resurrection needed to be expressed
[1:46:04] and it could not be expressed unless the
[1:46:07] man had died.
[1:46:10] Four days dead. Amen. It make the
[1:46:13] testimony greater.
[1:46:18] Jesus said her, I am the resurrection
[1:46:22] and the life. He that believeth in me,
[1:46:26] though he were dead, yet shall he live.
[1:46:29] Thank you, Lord. And whosoever
[1:46:31] believeth, whosoever liveth and
[1:46:33] believeth in me shall never die. And he
[1:46:35] asks the question, "Believest thou
[1:46:37] this?"
[1:46:39] The story goes on and we don't have time
[1:46:41] to read it all, but you know, uh,
[1:46:45] finally she goes to get her sister say,
[1:46:46] "Jesus here and he calling for
[1:46:48] you." Jesus meet tells her sister,
[1:46:50] "Y'all y'all show me where he lay where
[1:46:52] where where where he lays." And and even
[1:46:55] in the even in Jesus speaking all this
[1:46:57] what we got later on in in that passage
[1:46:59] that Jesus cried right along with them.
[1:47:01] Jesus wept. Shortest verse in the Bible.
[1:47:03] Jesus wept and he was crying because he
[1:47:05] could feel the emotions.
[1:47:08] But yet he knew that he was there by a
[1:47:10] vision and he knew that you know by by
[1:47:13] being there God he already knew what God
[1:47:15] was going to do but he still felt the
[1:47:16] emotions of the people. Oh my God. My
[1:47:19] God. He knows what you're going through.
[1:47:22] He understands. He feels it. But he's
[1:47:25] got a better plan for you. And and here
[1:47:28] here here you know uh uh they finally
[1:47:31] get him to the grave and and again if
[1:47:33] you want to see a now God, you got to do
[1:47:36] now things.
[1:47:39] And and what he what he told the ladies,
[1:47:41] he told the sisters, all them men
[1:47:44] standing around, he looked at them.
[1:47:49] You Mary, you Martha roll the stone
[1:47:53] away. Yes. And like we heard on
[1:47:55] Wednesday night, he could have did this
[1:47:56] himself. He could have spoken the stone
[1:47:58] would have rolled away. But no, but but
[1:48:00] but because he wants you to be a part of
[1:48:04] the miracle, he says, "You rolled the
[1:48:06] stone away." And when they finally got
[1:48:08] the stone rolled away, my God the
[1:48:10] prophet told us
[1:48:13] that Jesus, Amen, being who he was, it
[1:48:16] had he spoken
[1:48:18] come forth, he said everything
[1:48:22] that was buried,
[1:48:24] anybody that been dead for I don't care
[1:48:26] how long they was dead, had he said come
[1:48:29] forth, everything would have come out to
[1:48:31] earth. That's right. He had to call
[1:48:33] Lazarus by name. Lazarus.
[1:48:37] come forth. That's right. Amen. And a
[1:48:40] man that had been dead for 4 days come
[1:48:43] walking out of the grave. And the people
[1:48:45] saw a miracle that was in the
[1:48:50] now. God want to do
[1:48:53] miracles in the now.
[1:48:56] And and and Moses, don't think you
[1:49:00] you don't don't think my hand is that
[1:49:02] short.
[1:49:04] I heard I heard these complaints. I I
[1:49:06] Yeah, I Yeah, I heard I heard them. I
[1:49:08] heard everything they said. I saw the
[1:49:11] things they wrote down. Yeah, I saw it.
[1:49:14] But But let me let me He say he say he
[1:49:17] said, "Thou shalt see." Now,
[1:49:22] whether my words should come to pass
[1:49:23] unto thee or not. I I like that. I like
[1:49:27] that. There is
[1:49:30] um there's a couple more that I want to
[1:49:32] I want to bring to you. Let me let me
[1:49:34] just see here. Lord Jesus. Lord
[1:49:38] Jesus. There was a
[1:49:41] um a story in John 4
[1:49:47] and Lord have mercy. I got a couple
[1:49:51] things
[1:49:53] here. Faith cometh by hearing. Let me go
[1:49:55] to that quote. Faith cometh by hearing.
[1:50:02] says, "I'm telling you
[1:50:04] faith, but you got to have hope and
[1:50:07] charity. If you got real burly faith and
[1:50:11] no love with
[1:50:12] it, you've
[1:50:14] ruined your influence before the people.
[1:50:18] If you got if you haven't got love mixed
[1:50:20] with it, see, you seen people real
[1:50:23] burly, what we would say, excuse
[1:50:25] expression of bulldog faith."
[1:50:29] And see, it's okay to have a bulldog
[1:50:30] faith, but you got to have some love
[1:50:32] with your bulldog faith because you can
[1:50:35] have bulldog faith and just just kind of
[1:50:37] uh exclude everybody. You ain't got
[1:50:39] faith like me, you ain't nothing. No,
[1:50:41] no, no, no. You got a gift. You got a
[1:50:45] gift of bulldog faith. Everybody don't
[1:50:48] have that same gift.
[1:50:50] But every gift is is is for the
[1:50:52] edification of the body. We need some
[1:50:55] people with some real bulldog faith. And
[1:50:58] we need some people that kind of take it
[1:50:59] easy.
[1:51:01] Amen. They they they they approach
[1:51:03] things more in a me methodical way. God
[1:51:06] still made that person, right? He says,
[1:51:09] "So you got to have love with it no
[1:51:10] matter what." Now you got to have love.
[1:51:12] He says he says you see people a real
[1:51:14] burly what we say excuse expression of
[1:51:17] bulldog faith to grab a hold but but it
[1:51:19] but it's so rough with it.
[1:51:23] Then you see when you do that, it hasn't
[1:51:26] got the kindness here to move with it.
[1:51:32] See, bulldog already says it's done. I
[1:51:34] don't Man, that thing is done. I I knew
[1:51:36] that was going to happen years ago.
[1:51:38] But you just got to wait for other
[1:51:40] people to get to that same spot. And you
[1:51:41] got to show love to them while they
[1:51:42] coming along.
[1:51:44] Hallelujah.
[1:51:46] He said, then you see when you when you
[1:51:47] do that, it it hasn't got the kindness
[1:51:49] here to move with it. See, so what we
[1:51:52] need is hope, faith, and
[1:51:54] charity. Hope, faith, and charity. And
[1:51:57] and some people in the church move in
[1:51:58] the realm of hope. You know what hope
[1:52:00] says is that, you know, I seen God do it
[1:52:02] for my brother, seen God do it for my
[1:52:04] sister. I'm I'm just believing that
[1:52:06] he'll do it for me. That's hope. I I'm
[1:52:09] believing he going to do it for me,
[1:52:12] right? That's hope. Because what you
[1:52:13] seeing God do for others. But when it
[1:52:15] come to having faith, it's like, no, no,
[1:52:17] no. It don't matter what he did for
[1:52:18] nobody else.
[1:52:20] I know what he going to do for me.
[1:52:23] That that that's that's that's bulldog
[1:52:25] faith. But you know, you can have hope
[1:52:29] and you can have faith, but you need
[1:52:31] another part in the church. Love. That's
[1:52:34] right. All three of them work together.
[1:52:39] We'll get things accomplished when we
[1:52:40] all work together. All right. Look now.
[1:52:43] It
[1:52:45] says, it says, "So that we need what we
[1:52:47] need is hope, faith, and charity." Isn't
[1:52:49] that right? Hope, faith, and charity
[1:52:51] together. God, help our church to have
[1:52:54] it like that. The people to have that
[1:52:57] have that combination. Amen.
[1:53:01] But if you just rely on hope, if you
[1:53:03] just rely on hope, then you hinder
[1:53:06] faith.
[1:53:09] Now, hope looks for something way
[1:53:12] off, but
[1:53:14] faith claims it
[1:53:18] right now.
[1:53:19] See, we need faith claiming right now
[1:53:22] people in the church to stop pushing it
[1:53:25] off into the future. No, claim that now,
[1:53:29] man. We need people with the spirit of
[1:53:31] Caleb. Yes, sir. Caleb, come back with
[1:53:34] that. I mean, come back with them other
[1:53:35] 10 spies. 11 spies and they come back
[1:53:38] with a negative report. I mean, yeah, we
[1:53:40] know God gave us a land, but now look
[1:53:42] here. Uh, we got evidence that's a good
[1:53:44] land. We got I mean, it's flowing with
[1:53:46] milk and honey. Got these big old
[1:53:47] grapes. We carrying them. Two men
[1:53:49] carrying a clutch at one time. You It's
[1:53:51] We got the evidence.
[1:53:54] But there's some giants over in that
[1:53:58] land eating these big old grapes. And we
[1:54:01] got to figure out a plan of how we going
[1:54:02] to devour these giants before we get to
[1:54:04] the grapes. Caleb steal the people. My
[1:54:07] God. Caleb say, "Stop that to
[1:54:10] talk." Pretty much like brother Wes say,
[1:54:13] Brother Wesco said, "Shut up."
[1:54:16] Come on, somebody. You got to tell the
[1:54:18] devil, "Shut up." I ain't listening to
[1:54:19] that no more. He said, "Let's go up at
[1:54:22] once and possess what God has promised
[1:54:26] us." We need Calebs with that kind of
[1:54:29] faith in the church. Yes, sir. Amen. As
[1:54:33] long as they got some love.
[1:54:35] Hallelujah.
[1:54:37] Hope will hinder faith. But faith got to
[1:54:40] be able to love hope.
[1:54:43] All right. Amen. Amen. Boy, we got we
[1:54:46] get that combination there. We going we
[1:54:47] going to get something accomplished.
[1:54:50] Amen. Hope looks for something way off,
[1:54:53] but faith claims it right now. Faith
[1:54:56] says God said so and it's mine.
[1:54:59] That settles it. See, I don't care if
[1:55:02] I'm still crippled, I'm still blind, I'm
[1:55:06] still sick. That don't have nothing to
[1:55:08] do with it. I believe it anyhow.
[1:55:11] It's mine
[1:55:13] right now.
[1:55:15] God said so, and that settles it. See,
[1:55:18] that's faith. But hope says, God said
[1:55:20] so. I'm expecting to get it. Oh, I'm
[1:55:24] moving I'm moving away from hope today.
[1:55:27] I I've had it, but I'm moving away
[1:55:29] today. God done encouraged my spirit.
[1:55:32] I'm I'm moving from hope over to faith
[1:55:35] with love. Amen. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:55:40] Faith say I can have it now.
[1:55:48] Uh God says so it's mine. That settles
[1:55:50] it. I don't care if I'm still crippled,
[1:55:52] if I'm still blind, if I'm still sick.
[1:55:53] That don't have nothing to do with it. I
[1:55:55] believe it anyhow. It's mine right now.
[1:55:57] God says so and that settles it. See,
[1:55:59] that's faith. He says, "But hope says
[1:56:01] God said so, and I'm expecting to get it
[1:56:03] someday." You see, I'm expecting it
[1:56:05] someday. As long as Satan can put you
[1:56:07] off to another day.
[1:56:11] That's as good as he wants. Are y'all
[1:56:13] tired of y'all promises being held up?
[1:56:17] I know I'm tired of it. Amen. God, I
[1:56:20] want to see you move.
[1:56:22] [Music]
[1:56:24] Amen. Because I I I I seen you work for
[1:56:27] others.
[1:56:30] I need you to work for me.
[1:56:34] I've seen you heal others. I need you to
[1:56:38] heal me. I seen you make a way for
[1:56:42] others. God, I need you to make a way
[1:56:45] for me.
[1:56:47] I release you, God. do a work.
[1:56:51] [Applause]
[1:56:53] Lord,
[1:56:59] if as long as Satan can put you off to
[1:57:02] another day, that's as good as he wants.
[1:57:04] That's right. You'll never get it. Just
[1:57:07] believe that you got it right now. Just
[1:57:10] believe that you got it right now.
[1:57:14] It's your personal property. Amen. Faith
[1:57:17] is the substance of things hoped for,
[1:57:19] the evidence of things not seen. Is that
[1:57:22] right? Faith acts now is
[1:57:24] positive. Says, "Oh my, I tell you,
[1:57:27] sickness and everything else when faith
[1:57:29] steps in. It's just like a snowball on a
[1:57:33] hot stove. It just melts away.
[1:57:37] Everything goes away from faith. Cuz
[1:57:40] faith stands up and takes over rule.
[1:57:44] When faith speaks,
[1:57:47] everybody else keeps still.
[1:57:51] That's right. Hallelujah. Brother, faith
[1:57:53] is greater than EF Hutton.
[1:57:57] You You all remember the EF Hutton
[1:57:59] commercial? When EF Hutton talked,
[1:58:03] boy, everybody just stopped in their
[1:58:05] tracks. I mean, he'd be on park bench
[1:58:07] just talking up something. Somebody come
[1:58:09] by jogging. EF Hutton.
[1:58:16] But that that's what faith is. When when
[1:58:18] faith begins to speak, everything else
[1:58:20] just hush.
[1:58:22] Woo. I like that.
[1:58:27] Let me give you just uh Mark 11:23- 24.
[1:58:30] That's the scripture that was being
[1:58:31] referred to in u in that quote. Mark 11
[1:58:36] 23- 24. For verily I say unto you that
[1:58:43] whosoever shall say unto this mountain,
[1:58:45] whatever that mountain is that you have
[1:58:47] this morning, you say unto this
[1:58:49] mountain, be thou removed.
[1:58:52] I don't I I don't know what the mountain
[1:58:54] is that's stopping us from getting our
[1:58:55] church, but I'm speaking this morning.
[1:58:57] Be thou removed.
[1:59:01] Mountain be moved. Yes. Whatever the
[1:59:04] mountain is, I don't care what it is, be
[1:59:07] moved. Amen.
[1:59:11] [Music]
[1:59:13] Be thou cast into the sea, Lord. And
[1:59:16] shall not doubt
[1:59:18] in his heart, but shall believe that
[1:59:20] those things which he saith.
[1:59:23] Yeah. We going to have our church
[1:59:26] and school.
[1:59:29] Amen. God has already provided. Yes.
[1:59:32] Amen. Amen. He going to do the
[1:59:34] exceeding, the abundant above all we can
[1:59:35] ask or think.
[1:59:37] Yeah. I'm giving God praise in advance
[1:59:40] for what I know he going to do.
[1:59:45] And we ain't going to be broke after we
[1:59:46] buy the church.
[1:59:49] We're going to still be living in the
[1:59:50] overflow.
[1:59:53] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen.
[1:59:56] but shall believe that those things
[1:59:58] which he saith shall come to pass, he
[2:00:00] shall have whatsoever he
[2:00:02] saith. Therefore I say unto you, what
[2:00:06] things soever ye desire when ye pray,
[2:00:11] believe that ye receive them and ye
[2:00:14] shall have them. That's why you got to
[2:00:15] water it with your praise. God, I know
[2:00:18] you heard me, so I'm just gonna thank
[2:00:20] you in advance. And as I'm thank you in
[2:00:23] advance, I'm bringing myself to the
[2:00:26] materialization of my promise, the
[2:00:28] manifestation of my promise. I look
[2:00:31] here, I ain't going to I look, let me
[2:00:33] just be honest and just tell you, I'm
[2:00:35] not going to be praising him after it
[2:00:38] happened.
[2:00:41] No, I'm going be on this side before it
[2:00:44] happened. I'm going to be praising him
[2:00:46] here and my praise just going to allow
[2:00:49] me to cross over to there.
[2:00:51] But my praise going to start way over
[2:00:53] there.
[2:00:56] Hallelujah.
[2:01:00] Lord, you know, I I'm going just say
[2:01:05] Jger Middle School ain't going to be the
[2:01:07] same.
[2:01:08] [Music]
[2:01:10] We We done We done had some good times
[2:01:13] here. And y'all see, I'm speaking in the
[2:01:15] past.
[2:01:17] We done had some good times here.
[2:01:22] We've enjoyed the presence of the Lord
[2:01:24] at 3777
[2:01:27] Jog Road. We thank God for that. Amen.
[2:01:31] It was it was it was completion and
[2:01:35] perfection.
[2:01:37] And and God God blessed right here in
[2:01:39] this place.
[2:01:41] Woo. Last Sunday, I I I didn't know
[2:01:44] Sister Michelle was out here shouting
[2:01:45] like the way she was shouting. But we
[2:01:48] done had some services right
[2:01:50] here. It It's something about wherever
[2:01:53] we go, we have church.
[2:01:57] Praise God, brother. We can be around
[2:02:00] the corner and have church. We can be in
[2:02:02] Green Acres and have church. We'll come
[2:02:05] to your house and we'll have
[2:02:07] church. We'll go to a schoolhouse, we
[2:02:10] have church.
[2:02:11] We know we know how to praise God
[2:02:13] wherever we at because Paul said, "I
[2:02:16] learn, amen, to be content in whatever
[2:02:19] state I'm in." Amen. I'm not going to
[2:02:21] complain. I'm not going to, amen, get
[2:02:23] frustrated. I'm going to praise God
[2:02:26] right where I'm at. But if God closed
[2:02:29] one door and has not opened the next
[2:02:32] door, I find myself stuck in a hallway.
[2:02:35] But in the hallway, I will praise him. I
[2:02:39] will praise him. Glory to God. He's
[2:02:42] still worthy to be praised in the
[2:02:44] hallway. I'm not praising him by by the
[2:02:47] door that's closed. I'm praising him for
[2:02:49] the door that's about to be open.
[2:02:53] I'm moving from back then to now.
[2:02:59] Oh yes, we've had some wonderful
[2:03:01] services here.
[2:03:05] But in a season of now,
[2:03:09] Something has to change.
[2:03:12] And we speaking to every mountain,
[2:03:15] [Applause]
[2:03:18] mountain of finances,
[2:03:21] mountain of people making decisions.
[2:03:24] We don't care what the mountain is. We
[2:03:27] move cast into the sea.
[2:03:31] We don't heard too many other people
[2:03:32] testimonies. I now now now it's time for
[2:03:36] our testimony.
[2:03:39] Amen.
[2:03:43] Um,
[2:03:46] therefore I say unto you, what what
[2:03:47] things soever you desire when you pray,
[2:03:49] believe that you receive them, and you
[2:03:51] shall have them. I'm skipping around in
[2:03:55] this sermon. I'm bringing it to a close,
[2:03:58] but there is enough here to keep going.
[2:04:02] There's a a a story that I was reading
[2:04:10] in John uh chapter
[2:04:12] actually two two verses here. John uh 4
[2:04:18] 46 and let me I'll just kind of make
[2:04:22] mention brother brother Brandon made a
[2:04:24] statement. Just give me John 4:46 and
[2:04:25] I'll I'll read it here in a second.
[2:04:27] making a statement about that scripture
[2:04:29] we just read out of Mark 11. Therefore I
[2:04:32] say unto you, whatsoever things you
[2:04:33] desire when you pray, believe you
[2:04:35] receive, you shall have them. He says,
[2:04:36] watch the order of the scripture.
[2:04:38] Believe now you receive
[2:04:43] it. Now when you believe you got it, you
[2:04:46] have no evidence. There's nothing there
[2:04:48] to show that you got it, but you believe
[2:04:50] you got it and just keep believing and
[2:04:52] it'll be given to you.
[2:04:55] So, uh, John
[2:04:58] 4:46 is an example of of this. A man was
[2:05:01] given a promise and,
[2:05:05] um, he had no evidence that it was that
[2:05:09] way. But because he believed, amen, it
[2:05:13] materialized. here in verse
[2:05:16] 46 John
[2:05:18] 4 says uh so Jesus came again into
[2:05:24] Canaan of
[2:05:25] Galilee where he made the water
[2:05:28] wine. There was a certain noble man
[2:05:30] whose son was sick at
[2:05:32] Capernaum. When he heard that Jesus was
[2:05:34] come out of Judea into Galilee, he went
[2:05:37] unto him and besought him that he would
[2:05:40] come down and and heal his son, for he
[2:05:43] was at the point of death. Then said
[2:05:46] Jesus unto him, "Except you see the
[2:05:48] signs and wonders, you will not
[2:05:50] believe." The nobleman saith unto him,
[2:05:52] "Sir, come down, air, my child die."
[2:05:55] Now, now look what this man was was
[2:05:57] showing that I'm not going to let your
[2:05:59] statement shake me.
[2:06:02] I got a dying child and I need I need
[2:06:05] you
[2:06:08] now. He
[2:06:12] says Jesus said unto him, go thy
[2:06:17] way, thy son
[2:06:20] liveth. And the man believed the word
[2:06:24] that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he
[2:06:27] went his way. And as he was now going
[2:06:31] down, his servants met him, and told
[2:06:34] him, saying, "Thy son liveth."
[2:06:40] Then inquired he of them the hour when
[2:06:43] he began to amend. So when did my son
[2:06:45] begin to get better? You say, "My son
[2:06:47] living, I ain't even made it home
[2:06:49] yet." And and now he ain't even told him
[2:06:52] what Jesus said yet, but they done give
[2:06:54] him the testimony. Your son living, you
[2:06:56] ought to start rejoicing. your son. But
[2:06:58] he he had a question
[2:07:01] when when when when uh when when he
[2:07:04] began to amend and they said to him,
[2:07:06] "Yesterday at the seventh hour, the
[2:07:08] fever left him."
[2:07:12] So the father
[2:07:14] knew that it was at that the same hour
[2:07:18] in the which Jesus said unto unto him,
[2:07:20] "Thy son liveth and himself believed."
[2:07:23] So it's not just when he spoke it, but
[2:07:25] it's also when the man mixed his faith
[2:07:27] with what was being said. When he
[2:07:28] believed, I wonder if somebody believe
[2:07:31] in now.
[2:07:32] Amen. If you'll just mix your faith with
[2:07:35] what God has given
[2:07:38] us. He says, so so the father knew that
[2:07:42] it was at the same hour in the which
[2:07:44] Jesus said unto him, thy son liveth in
[2:07:46] himself believed in his whole house.
[2:07:48] This is again the second miracle that
[2:07:51] Jesus did when he was come out of Judea
[2:07:55] into Galilee. They call it the second
[2:07:58] miracle because the first miracle
[2:08:00] happened back in John chapter 2 in Canaa
[2:08:03] of Galilee where Jesus turned the
[2:08:07] water into wine.
[2:08:12] I was just reading that passage
[2:08:15] again and looking at and some of the
[2:08:18] things that I saw there
[2:08:20] is Mary comes to Jesus and she says,
[2:08:25] "Uh, Jesus, there's a
[2:08:28] problem. There's a problem here at this
[2:08:31] wedding." And I know ain't nobody here
[2:08:34] in the wedding can do nothing about it
[2:08:35] but you.
[2:08:37] the the the parents of the bride can't
[2:08:40] fix this one. The parents of the groom
[2:08:44] can't fix this one. All the other guests
[2:08:46] that are here, nobody can do anything
[2:08:48] about this but you. So, I'm coming to
[2:08:50] you. All right. And let me let me help
[2:08:53] you understand Mary was not looking for
[2:08:56] him to do something in the future. They
[2:09:00] needed something now.
[2:09:03] So as uh a as she approaches him say she
[2:09:06] said you know say look they they out of
[2:09:07] wine they out of wine here at this
[2:09:09] wedding and and and that's going that's
[2:09:11] going to really look bad on these on on
[2:09:13] the host. That's going to look really
[2:09:14] bad. It's like it's like having a um a
[2:09:17] wedding reception and running out of
[2:09:19] food.
[2:09:24] Look, save your money, young people.
[2:09:26] When y'all get married,
[2:09:31] people going to buy you a gift. They
[2:09:32] expecting a little something for their
[2:09:34] gift. They want to eat. Not no. Oh, let
[2:09:37] me just stay out of that. Let me stay
[2:09:39] out of Let me stay out of that. Let me
[2:09:42] stay out of that cuz I I I I've I've
[2:09:44] I've seen I've been to some weddings in
[2:09:46] my days and I've I've had different
[2:09:48] menus that were presented and some just
[2:09:51] like after I left the wedding I say let
[2:09:53] me find the nearest restaurant I can get
[2:09:55] to cuz I did not eat
[2:10:01] nothing. Don't be trying to be cute at
[2:10:03] no wedding with no cute idea. Feed folk.
[2:10:11] Lord, get let me get out of
[2:10:12] [Music]
[2:10:14] here. A early afternoon wedding is great
[2:10:17] because we going to be hungry right
[2:10:18] after the wedding.
[2:10:20] Don't be trying to bring us out there no
[2:10:22] 7:00 in the morning when the sun rise.
[2:10:25] No, no, you trying to get out of feeding
[2:10:28] us.
[2:10:32] [Music]
[2:10:37] These people were in trouble.
[2:10:41] They were in a lot of trouble and said
[2:10:43] he said he said Mary said Mary say look
[2:10:46] um they um they out of
[2:10:50] wine say we going to we got to he say
[2:10:52] I'm I'm bringing this to you because I
[2:10:54] know you can do something and Jesus tell
[2:10:55] Mary said woman woman woman my time is
[2:10:57] not yet why you asking me this it ain't
[2:11:00] time for me to kind of reveal who I am
[2:11:02] it's not it's not my time yet and she
[2:11:05] she just heard what he said didn't say
[2:11:07] nothing back but she went to
[2:11:11] attendants and other guests. She said,
[2:11:14] "Whatever
[2:11:17] he tell you to do,
[2:11:24] you you just do it."
[2:11:27] And he looked and he saw six
[2:11:31] pots and and and the Bible call them
[2:11:33] fans. It means they had a certain amount
[2:11:35] of uh something in it already, right?
[2:11:38] maybe water or something like that. But
[2:11:40] but what he tells them to do now she say
[2:11:42] whatever he tell you to do just go do
[2:11:43] it. Now here's what he told him. Take
[2:11:45] the six pots and fill them up with
[2:11:50] water. As I was reading this, I'm just
[2:11:52] thinking to myself, I'm I'm talking to
[2:11:54] me and maybe y'all wouldn't think like
[2:11:55] this. Y'all might not think like this.
[2:11:57] They fill them up with water. They fill
[2:11:58] them up to the brim and the water just
[2:12:00] seeping out of them. They they bring
[2:12:01] them back. And the next thing he tells
[2:12:04] him to
[2:12:05] do, take from the pot and give it to the
[2:12:09] governor of the feast. Now, this is my
[2:12:11] thinking. I just filled this pot
[2:12:15] up with
[2:12:18] water. It's overflowing with water and
[2:12:21] you want me to
[2:12:23] give
[2:12:24] water to the governor? You realize they
[2:12:28] not looking for water, right? They want
[2:12:32] wine. Yeah. They out of wine. They not
[2:12:35] out of water. They out of wine. Jesus.
[2:12:40] Anybody think they would be in the same
[2:12:42] boat that I'm in? Oh yeah. Let me tell
[2:12:44] you something. If you in that boat, both
[2:12:46] of us would miss the miracle.
[2:12:49] Because because the instruction, if you
[2:12:51] want to see now, you got to move to now.
[2:12:54] And the instruction is fill it up with
[2:12:56] water and now take out of it and give it
[2:12:59] to the governor of the feast. Amen. Now,
[2:13:01] what happened in between here
[2:13:05] and there, that ain't up to you. That's
[2:13:09] up to me. You just fill it up with water
[2:13:12] and then take out of that and give it to
[2:13:14] the governor of the feast. Yes, sir.
[2:13:17] Amen. So, somewhere somewhere somewhere.
[2:13:21] Yes, sir. Somewhere. Amen. Between me
[2:13:25] filling it up with water and giving it
[2:13:27] to the governor somewhere.
[2:13:30] Somewhere somewhere.
[2:13:34] [Music]
[2:13:36] Amen. Somewhere between here and there.
[2:13:42] The miracle of the water to the wine.
[2:13:45] Yes, sir. Took place. Hallelujah.
[2:13:48] Sometime God just need us to operate by
[2:13:51] faith. Just do do things that seem crazy
[2:13:53] to us. I'mma fill it up with water, but
[2:13:57] I'm expecting wine. How I'm going to
[2:13:59] make it wine? That ain't my job. Right.
[2:14:02] And here's the thing. When when when the
[2:14:04] man got the wine, and this is this is
[2:14:06] what everybody was a part of this this
[2:14:08] this testimony because when man got the
[2:14:09] wine, the governor tasty say,
[2:14:14] most weddings,
[2:14:17] they actually put out the cheap wine at
[2:14:21] the beginning,
[2:14:22] right? They they they they Well, no, no,
[2:14:24] no. They say they put out the best wine
[2:14:26] at the beginning and then they save that
[2:14:29] cheap wine for the end after everybody
[2:14:32] drunk and can't really taste nothing no
[2:14:34] more. That that's what that most wedders
[2:14:36] they do it that way. Say, but man,
[2:14:40] at your
[2:14:42] wedding at your feast at this
[2:14:45] celebration,
[2:14:46] man, you saved the best.
[2:14:51] Woohoo. for last.
[2:14:54] And that's what happens when we move to
[2:14:57] now. God will give you his best.
[2:15:01] Oh yes, he will. The testimony God is
[2:15:05] preparing you for. Man, people ain't
[2:15:08] never heard nothing like this before.
[2:15:12] Other thing he did
[2:15:15] between here and there, he bypassed
[2:15:17] processes.
[2:15:19] So God, if you have to bypass the bank,
[2:15:23] if you have to bypass a lender,
[2:15:26] if you have to bypass the mortgage
[2:15:28] broker, God, whatever you got to bypass
[2:15:31] somewhere between here, can I put it
[2:15:34] this way? Somewhere between this Sunday,
[2:15:37] and next Sunday, can I just take a step
[2:15:40] of faith and put it out there? God, do
[2:15:42] something
[2:15:45] now. Amen. Amen.
[2:15:47] [Music]
[2:15:49] Amen. Lord,
[2:15:56] amen.
[2:15:58] Hallelujah.
[2:16:00] Hallelujah Jesus.
[2:16:03] Thank you, Lord.
[2:16:06] Immediately, Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[2:16:08] Hallelujah.
[2:16:10] Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah. Thank you,
[2:16:11] Lord.
[2:16:14] Let the musicians come.
[2:16:20] Turn the service back over to brother
[2:16:21] Troy. Let's have a word of prayer.
[2:16:31] Father, your word has come to us.
[2:16:40] For some reason, you had me read that
[2:16:41] scripture and
[2:16:43] As I read it, Lord, just that word just
[2:16:46] really popped out to
[2:16:47] me. Just held it, Father, for a little
[2:16:50] bit. And want to just bring it and bring
[2:16:53] strength and encouragement to the
[2:16:54] people.
[2:16:57] Sometimes when we do that, there's an
[2:17:00] inspiration that comes from the
[2:17:05] word and we we operate, we walk in that
[2:17:10] inspiration and our
[2:17:13] expectation is that you will back up the
[2:17:15] inspiration of the word just as you did
[2:17:18] for Moses when he said, "The
[2:17:22] Egyptians you have seen
[2:17:25] day you shall you shall see no more
[2:17:28] forever. That was a now moment.
[2:17:32] They were looking at Egyptians that day.
[2:17:35] They were running for their lives that
[2:17:37] day. They were tired of running. Yes.
[2:17:41] And God, you moved then. Yes. Moses
[2:17:45] stretched out his rod. Oh God. And from
[2:17:48] there, oh God, they walked through on
[2:17:50] dry land. and and Father, the exceeding,
[2:17:53] the abundant above all that they could
[2:17:55] ask or think after they walked through
[2:17:56] on dry land, Moses stretched the rod
[2:17:58] back out and my God, Lord, the the army
[2:18:03] of Pharaoh was drowned in a Red
[2:18:06] Sea. Lord, the sisters began to pull the
[2:18:09] tambourines out. They began to worship
