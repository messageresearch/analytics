believe that the year is almost over and we are headed into 2023 uh but we're looking forward to all God has in store amen amen good he's been real real good thanks brother Solomon was saying earlier to sell different saints went through different trials this year but God has brought them all through amen and steadily bringing them through so we we thank the Lord for that amen if just one bringing the sand on the mountain begin the move we're gonna praise God for the mountain movement the devil's ain't nothing but one grain that's one grain less and if if we just keep going grain by grain it ain't gonna be no more mountain sooner we're not waiting for the big mountain we praise God for the great glory to God so God is good church amen amen so this morning amen we we uh just wanna welcome our guests that are with us we thank the Lord [Music] that's my mom's name Ellen uh but uh they're from the UK and their daughter was just here recently with the sister April and they are passing through uh going to see their daughter for a couple weeks so it's good to have them with us God bless you praise the Lord um brother Darren actually the Lord has called him to Ministry and um one of the things specifically he preaches the gospel but he also prays for the sick and uh at the end of the service today brother Smiley speaks I'm gonna have brother Darren come and just kind of greet us and share some testimonies but I want to also just prepare you uh that if there's anyone here that needs prayer or if you want to stand in the gap for somebody uh we're gonna have it's a prayer line and just allow those that want to come forth to be prayed for them I will pray for you today so God got something amen a blessing with your name on it and uh and I just believe that if he was sharing just some things that happened last week and how the spirit of the Lord poured out to them and how one system is just healed uh instantly they're in service and I've said that happened us last week and I had the thing not last week the week before my wife had to tell me what brother Gene came last week that was two weeks but uh but nonetheless it's the same God and uh you know got a testimony from sister Michelle how she been dealing with some issues there and she came up here two Sundays ago and she said I asked the brothers were lined up just each one praying and brother Simba uh beginning to praise just right there on the spot to receive healing in her body and so we know he is the same yesterday today and forever good God he'll come to the school house he'll come to a schoolhouse amen wherever his people are gathered he will come and show himself strong so amen we thank the Lord for that and then also uh brother Jude amen from Haiti God bless you good to have you

then Saturday 11 A.M they have a a barbecue potluck and then also Sunday 11 A.M I know some of our Saints will be going over to be a part of that and we thank you for that uh I myself will be away in [Music] um Arizona and going with my wife and brother Smiley and sister smiling we're all going out I was uh reflecting on something that just in the past I remember a minister friend of mine uh we're going to some meetings and my wives and uh at the time you know he was going through something and uh but something happened at the meeting that shifted his wife and uh she has never been the same since that meeting and uh and as I began to reflect on that God you can do it again you can do it again and uh so I'm expecting to come back uh just just what you know I'm expecting God to do something like that I know that brother Caleb has been just really keeping his church under a um uh atmosphere of the Holy Ghost and uh you know I think that's very important so it it uh told the church they had a wonderful wonderful service a few months ago and he says he says um you know church I know this is a great service but God promised me more than this what we just got and uh and he put some pressure on me say brother Jack I'm expecting God to move on that Saturday night service that you're scheduled to speak I said brother that's a lot of pressure but it's not me it's gonna be gone so uh if that's what God lead in his heart I ain't gonna put no straws in his way imma just show up and do my part amen but I just trust God will move in a very special way and I ask that you would just really pray for us amen we're scheduled to speak there Saturday night brother smile they've been preaching on Friday night and um and also brother Smiley's scheduled to preach on Sunday morning uh for the Israel poll and I'll be speaking Wednesday night at brother Israel post so uh keep us in in prayers we travel uh going there to the West Coast amen uh so these are the things that are coming the other thing I need to make mention of you on last week I mentioned to you that uh Christmas Day the school told us that they had nobody that would uh volunteer to open up and close up for some Christmas Day Christmas is on a Sunday amen this year and uh a perfect time to Worship the Lord hello somebody a perfect time the worship of the Lord on Christmas day amen amen amen amen hey man we're gonna bring our gifts to the Lord we're gonna worship God so they wouldn't open up the school and said that uh sorry pastor so I just started you know praying and just seeing what the Lord would do and start calling around to a few places and different ones said no we're not available [Music] the only charging that's a hundred and fifty dollars for the whole time that we're there amen so we gonna be going to the Fairfield Inn which is right down the street here on Vista Parkway if y'all know where the Hampton is behind uh LongHorn Steakhouse uh but fairfield's a new hotel that just got put there and they got a room at a seat about 50 to 60 people and I'd say we can handle that amen so we're going to be there on Christmas Day and uh we're gonna have service amen right there at Fairfield Inn so God is good [Music] um and I got this scripted that my mother-in-law gave me again and gathered in the back but I I don't have it in front of me right now but I'm a it's something about how she was just encouragement not gonna establish us in our own place in in the scripture say you're gonna stop moving from City to city and said she said when the Lord showed it to us they want to see the city we're just going from this place to that place in that place the god gonna stop that and give us all our own place I say I received what he did it for Israel he'll do it for us amen he has no respect of purses how we thank the Lord for all things amen so uh I don't want to prolong the time I think of our giving amen uh we got cash out we have cell and uh uh PayPal but and PayPal is only for those that only got PayPal if you got some if you can use cash episodes we prefer that because PayPal does take fees out of God's money and we don't want to give PayPal God's money amen uh so uh uh y'all know God's money is as times both of them is money thousand is ten percent of your salary by offering is whatever you want to give so if you want to give God 90. I'm just kidding I'm not don't don't go with slacking in your bills and stuff like that because you talk about you gave by faith no no don't do that don't do that but uh often there's no limit on it it just it comes from a cheerful heart [Music] same thing for PayPal if you want to mail something in spirit of Tabernacle PO box two two two four six two West Palm Beach Florida 33422 and those that are inside the sanctuary we have a box in the back uh that you can put your offering in it's a wooden box that you can put your offering other thing I just want to make mention we have another box there in the back this is for our gift cards there are some cards there that we ask that when you put your gift card in the car just make sure you put a little note a little script or something it's for what we do for different people during this Christmas season we just give them a blessing from us to them and uh so just write something special to somebody you don't know who's going to get it we don't know who's going to get it but uh we just want to leave them something and and just give them the hope of Christ during this Christmas season so uh there's another box that's the gold box that you'll see back there are the cards are writing running you can fill it out and I'll ask that you do it this way if you broke give cars today that you want to put in a card uh and then put the card in the box if you have if you want to do that today just make sure let everybody kind of clear out first and then you can come back in and uh and put your uh fill out your card and put in the box but we'll have that there for the next few weeks and then we'll plan to be doing our Christmas giveaway amen as a church and uh as I mentioned last week if we can get our young people involved in it I'll let you know in a day that we'll do it but we can have our young people come out and volunteer just be the ones maybe handing out the cars and telling somebody God bless you invite them at church you know just whatever you can you know one of the system was telling me back and our day moves growing up we used to go out and do Christmas Carolyn some of y'all remember that right and we go out and just sing those songs of uh just worshiping the Lord through Christmas caroling that's kind of hard to do that uh people don't want to come in and saying nothing about Jesus right but uh but we can find some way to touch our community amen and this is one of the ways that we're going to try so God bless you uh I don't want to prolong the time we want to have a brother Smiley come so you all just understand amen with us Amazing Grace amen and we'll have brother Smiley come and he will be bringing the gospel of Our Lord uh to us on today let's say a rich like me [Music] oh I watched [Music] [Music] Amazing Grace [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] hallelujah hallelujah Falling in Love with Jesus Jesus falling in love oh Jesus [Music] is the best thing hallelujah hallelujah let's try that one more time falling in love [Music] with Jesus [Music] [Laughter] Falling In Love With Jesus [Applause] is the best thing it's the best thing that I ever done how many believe that this morning wave your head best thing is the best thing one more time is the best thing is [Music] thank you Jesus [Music] glory to his wonderful name I don't know about y'all but I feel good it's good to be in the in the house of the Lord in spite of all that the enemy is trying to do let's get our Bibles out this morning it's good to see everybody out this morning blessing trusted everybody had a second Corinthians chapter 12. had a wonderful Thanksgiving uh we didn't get a chance to go to uh my mother's house but a wife cooked and that was that was fine we've been having controvers that would have got him a cat and I'm upset I was supposed to go to brother blue and preach couldn't go all because I changed some headlights so y'all y'all pray for a mechanic whoever they is a big smucker I got to ride in the Dirty Work vehicle with no AC but nevertheless I'm in church where you going man the work yes I'm going to work this morning I I come to work this morning we appreciate the Lord y'all just pray for us uh we we like to start from the uh eight versus says for this thing I besought you the Lord Thrice that it might depart from me and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me therefore I take pleasure in infirmities and approaches Necessities persecution stretch for Christ's sake but when we then I'm strong amen let's just buy our heads this morning gracious father we just give thanks and praise oh God for just allowing us to be here this morning and uh we're trusting and depending on you to see us through we trust that you give us action of the Holy Spirit the power of God to break Yokes Lord as the word go forth Lord God we we understand that Lord uh signs of follow the word of God Lord help me oh God give me strength in my physical body Lord Jesus Lord you know the needs of your people and when it's all said and done we be careful give you the praise the glory and the honor in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated this morning which is um I like to use as a topic this morning um what God uses who God uses and how God uses strange topic but we'll get into it and and and trust that the holy spirit will help us out this morning to uh give us something that'll that'll help us on our journey I I I had I've had this little thought on my heart uh for a couple of days couple of weeks and uh uh on weakness and and strength especially in the age that we're we're living in and uh we we was also thinking about the little message and that's where we'll pull our quotes from this morning uh perfect strength by Perfect weakness and now it's not not something that we probably haven't heard but this just the way that I I feel to go this morning and um one of the things I learned early on as as a minister something that brother Charles Page told me uh years and years ago he said uh always approach the gospel like nobody don't know anything all right and if you come come this morning uh like you know something you're probably not gonna get anything I might as well just start that all right sometimes we we feel like we we know a lot but a lot of times our actions just really shows us how much we do not know about the gospel in 30 years of ministry and I'm still learning and I'm still growing and uh we we fortunate enough to have some brother and brother Jack teaches this study on Wednesdays and some other brothers down through the week and and just listening to these Brethren they they you know just really helped me as as as a servant of God because I sharp at this iron amen and so we we need we need the ministry to to help us uh on the journey that that we own just something I want to read as I was studying to just maybe draw a little platform and I'm gonna move a little slow but I'm gonna pick up steam I may not run down the aisles this time but we'll we'll just see uh uh and this is for me and this is for all of us we must uh have a basis for our stand how many can say Amen to that it's without question we we can't just make it Church going and and church affiliations and we gotta we gotta take it further than I'm in the message right because there's a lot of people that's in the message that ain't in the message or really the message ain't in them which the message is only the word is that right we we gotta we gotta have these bases uh we're gonna always be on the fence and I believe this morning God wants to get us off of the fence and continually moving forward is that right I believe I believe this is what I believe I believe God wants us anchored God wants us stable right God wants to give us a basis for our stand if if we're coming and we're shouting and I love that we've been having some wonderful uh messages the bishop has been preaching the word of God not just joking we we do that with one another we you know that's my brother-in-law y'all and I got one in the back back there we we get together we had a real wonderful trip a couple of weeks ago I had a wonderful wonderful time and brother Jack really preached you know I like traveling with brother Jacka he spoil you so praise the lord we going on a trip next week so you know I can't help that but we we must have a basis for our state we got to understand there's a source of our strength right we we here's here's a just a real like brother Jack would say a key statement all right right we we have to be sound yes amen right amen amen uh we we must be sound and I believe in being sound this is for me too because I I go I face my challenges yeah you you know I'm I'm in a spiritual about if you're not in a spiritual battle something's wrong this morning so if the devil is not fighting you if he's not fighting your marriage if he's not biting your children if he's not fighting your home something's wrong just maybe you don't have anything right right because if you got something this morning Satan is fighting it I'm gonna say this again if you have something this morning Satan is fighting it if you're in the revealed word this morning Satan is fighting it and that's okay see we get our bit out of shape they said something about us being in the message so what so what the reveal weren't made flesh son of man Ministry they fought Jesus at every Junction so so if they find us that just shows me it's an indication that we have something is that right but it's important for us to understand what we got we gotta be we have to be sound right in our emotions and being emotional we got to be sound our instability is because of a lack of soundness in Scripture I'm gonna say that again amen our instability the reason we are not stable the reason we're on the fence the reason we got a lot of questions the reason why we can't move forward in God is because a man of of you know our our lack of soundness in Scripture right amen we we this is not the time to be be going backwards we got to be moving forward we we got to be sure about what we believe either you believe it or you don't either you either you believe a certain thing or you don't if you don't you just don't right amen but make sure if you don't it's because you could see a scripture that it don't line up not not in emotions or feelings you don't we're gonna go somewhere this morning right it can't just be any emotions and feelings and and and what somebody else said because it's got to be an individual thing an individual Revelation right because if not you're not gonna go in the rapture right and that's SS the thing gets to tighten it up on us you will not have what it takes to make it in this generation because this is what I believe I can only preach to y'all what I believe now this morning I believe that God sent William Marion Branham not to personalize himself but to give us a revelation of the word of God that will stabilize Us in the day and hour that we're living in right it was never about him as a person right it was only pointing us to Christ which is the further part of the word uh evening time light or evening time message a a light that'll ripen the fruit I'm starting to feel something now right but listen let's get this out of our mind let's let's get this one thing out of our mind the message William Branham had his part Accord to scripture now I I do believe that like brother Jack say well you know if he ain't the one to show me the man all right I I and I'm kind of with him on that right uh if he was not the one with a Ministry to turn our hearts and and to introduce because if it's the same type all right of of John the Baptist John the Baptist ministry was to forerun the coming word yeah his his ministry was to for a forerunning Ministry also am I in the book am I in the book am I in the book right so brother balance Ministry was to forerun Christ the word right glory to God so so you know we typologists all right because of the message see we can see the types but y'all oh Lord have mercy I feel like spinning around now hopefully I'm gonna get the way I want to do it this morning right this is we gotta be scripturally sound I believe that that's the approach of brother Jackson ministry that's my Approach brother Troy the Brethren is to make sure we're scripturally sound get off the fence this morning we you got to leave the fish we got we gotta if if this is your your church this has got to be your church get off the fence right yeah well this week that's my church but at the church I just don't know get up be be sure be sound I went somewhere this morning is that right I come to work is that right glory to God but but we we gotta get off the fence we we gotta be standing alone on the word standing alone individually on the word of God right not on reasoning right we can't be presuming God don't want us pursuing that was the purpose of opening the seals right so so that you know because down through the history of the church they pursue right Luther Luther had a portion of light for his day he did not have complete life Right Wesley didn't have they were just reformers this is not just this is not a a reformer's message this is the message to turn us back and to also reveal the thing that was covered up down through the history of the church we we have more understanding this morning than Luther had right but we do not throw away the the understatement Amen brother Brandon never threw away he just showed you what Luther had right he he by having a gift was able to look back down through scripture right and and see what those great men of scriptures brought to the people for their day see amen Luther because he wasn't predestined he could not do what William Branham did right is that right amen because the anointing that was on him he could only preach the gesture live by faith but y'all pray for me right that's all he could preach see he didn't even have a sanctification message because he still went to the pub and he still kind of you know yeah right right and see people are still confused because they say well you know I believe in Jesus Christ and everything yeah you just Justified though right amen you you got to keep moving into another stage you got to get your life cleaned up and then you got to get filled up and then once you get filled up then you you you just you know you're just getting right okay let me let me put my glasses on so I can see something but but but y'all y'all follow me God wants for us to be stable just just really uh uh sound things of that nature right um for me this this this little thought because I didn't know which direction I just you know knew I had some things out there and I wanted to look at it and as I started uh to studying I said okay Lord I'll just follow the path that you take me down and that's all we can do is as ministers because God is a sovereign God and God knows what we all stand in need of and and I think I think a thought like this is good for the Christian and the non-Christian because because you know especially for a younger generation not even just young I won't even say that because you you got older adults that struggling and struggling in areas where they feel uh insufficient and and weak and and and and we have this tendency and it's because we we lack soundness of scripture we we look at somebody else and then we we get into this like moping little well and and see when you know who you are when you know who you are you don't care what anybody else says or how anybody feel about you you know who you are as an individual amen right I say this don't never let nobody put you in a box right amen I refuse to be put in a box for anybody all right I am who I am you are who you are right I ain't mad at you for who you are but don't be mad at me for who I am because you don't really know me like that I don't know you like that God God God brought us here uh because we different because we could peculiar help you say it sometimes but praise the lord we we we're peculiar we're different all of them are different it's things that certain people can do that other folk can't do right you know I I hope my sister-in-law don't mind me uh uh use it as an example sister Tanya she got such a gift she can transform help me preach huh you'll be like hey there ain't no all this was up in here a 10 by 10 could come out be like God day you want to go in there and sit back on the couch and gaze and look but everybody ain't got that you'll be having purple and well somebody help me laughs okay different ones people people are gifted to do those things and others they get cross-sided you get discouraged and like man please I'm going to see that some people can do it that some of us that just got the paper to do and that's all right now I get God give you a little coins don't call up The Decorator uh I'd like for you to come and decorate a room come on now see I say this while I'm on it God places gifts in the body for a reason right and and because every gift's Supply we don't we ain't all the same y'all look I can't be I can't be nobody but me it's taking me 60 years to try to figure out who I am and be good with who I am brother cow y'all better watch out I've been I've been having myself a ball preaching on the road couldn't clean up shouting everything you know I told Lord I say Lord I need I need more power to preach just the power of the Holy Ghost they used to have real holy ghost power their brakes changed um I'm letting out my time getting away from me right so it sounded subscription now let's let's let's look at something here uh brother Branham he he preaching this message called uh perfect faith I mean perfect Spirit by Perfect week right and and this is the beginning quote and I don't have a number okay he says uh I I like to use this perfect Strip by Perfect week right he says if we have weakness let's watch this statement we have strength because sometimes the only thing that we major on I'm insufficient and I'm weak but we don't see where we have strength also right we we don't have the ability that's why when I was when I was thinking about this thought and as I started reading I was like Lord this is this is profound because uh you know even coming up we we could look back on our life and a lot of times all we saw was our inabilities and our weaknesses and we still do some of us like we say 50 60 years old you know we we find ourselves over here in a pity party that's the devil amen that and the devil that's all he he wants to show you he don't want this he don't he don't ever want you to see the fullness of Who You Are right amen when I can't dress like this one and I I can't talk like this one and uh don't try see just be who you are if we could get from The Young all the way to the older just be and be good with that do one of these numbers I'm good you know do us do a Steve Harvey on what what you say something I'm good with see I remember when I was young that was a part of my struggle not being good it's okay to be intellectual right listen you don't have to dumb yourself down to fit into no group of people so so so often we find young men and young women dumbing themselves down uh uh fake smiling to be able to fit in with the folk at the bus stop we do a lot of silly things we indulge in a lot of silly things because we ain't good with who we are well if you don't fit in you don't fit in that's somebody that you will be able to fit in with see if one thing about it if you believe this word you'll fit in with brother spout you ain't got to like my quirks and all of that I ain't told you you ever had to do that right but but as long as a man we got the word right right we believe the same Prophet the same word the same Jesus Christ we we're transforming ourselves into a condition that we're going to write so we good yeah we we good right okay so he says if we have weakness we have strength he says it's an unusual text Amen in a Pentecostal uh assembly right to take weakness because we always testifying how strong we are especially men I don't know women but women barely die Lord have mercy yes this thing is this thing is crazy because women are becoming more dominant than the men it shouldn't be that way it should it should not be that way but it is women wants to be the dominant figure in the church in the home should be that way that's that's a bad spirit that's a bad Spirit to be operating up under well I had to raise my children I didn't have a man you better you better get a balance you gotta have a balance right you might have had to do that don't mean that it was right but you got to find a balance oh let me leave that alone all right praise the Lord praise the Lord that could see there's a position and a place a masculinity and a woman should not have a masculine that's right barely let me tell you you're gonna be talking to the hand so we got let me leave that alone Lord Jesus I gotta put my glasses on I start getting in trouble y'all to shut me down yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we'll see y'all saying preach but we'll see foreign and for men we we have this thing you know we we are masculine but but that's still uh I don't say I want to phrase it right I don't have the right terminology for it but there is a place I think that we could operate in that's not so Burly and not so uh especially in my generation when we was coming up they always told us men don't cry shut up boy men don't cry you know I think it's it's good where where men can express their emotions right and not be not that something wrong y'all listen that's something wrong with that not that about that but but being sure but being sure you know of of who you are as a man not where you gotta walk around with your chest stuck out and you you you just have all of this stuff going on in your head right that that you think is you know you know we ain't nobody this ain't prison is it with this yeah yeah you know you you can you can operate you can break yourself down that's real I'm gonna say this that's real strength that's real real power that's not weakness see they used to tell us that that was weakness that's not weakness that that for a man to be able to break himself down on different levels hey that's real strip that's real power come on I know my man my kids you know you gotta just be I think everybody should know where everybody who everybody is and where everybody's staying sure I know it's a lot of confusion out here with all of this nonsense and agendas and this and that the others but but uh you know like you say we everybody wants to have this I'm stronger I'm strong black women he got so much nonsense out here let's feed people's Egos and all of that and maybe sometimes that's why women are seen come on cause you too strong can I preach I'm gonna get into trouble but I don't care I know who I am made a strong statement right years and years ago he said it's gonna hurt a little bit it's just picture just a little bit he said when a woman get out of her place out of the kitchen well praise the Lord somebody help me huh and what he said but but it's it's more behind that we just can't take that and throw that out there Society is different things there's different things has changed and you know we got Egos and we got you know the lust of the eyes too and you know everybody wanted to find a house in the back that come with a price yeah but it but it's but it has taken it has it has taken the backbone out of its place to a certain degree come on got a lot of Say Amen we we couldn't see the detriment when they sent all the men over the wall and put all the women in the workplace well who home when your children come on somebody who who dare When the Children get home my bad what and when she get home she'll feel like that this ain't no family but I can't say this I can't say this I'm grateful that God had it set up for me that with six children my wife a man was able to be there for my children right I'm grateful for that God did that I didn't do that God set that up like that because when I got married I was just like y'all right it was set up she was supposed to work I was supposed to work and and we were supposed to not have six children but well whatever but you know God had it set up where she was there she wasn't in the workplace right all right and I think too you know it's a lot it's a lot of mental battles that goes along with this is I could preach right I mean it's been a it's been it's been a detriment to society as a whole right because you got you got they're real but I'll just say yeah I'd rather put a woman in the place than to put a man huh no matter how educated he is right yeah because it it it demoralizes it breaks him down they got to come over and see my boss when she should be home when Johnny get there but praise the Lord this ain't gonna go over well yeah I ain't got no notes for that huh but it's the truth anyhow just just look at it holistically holistically right what because I I look back and I realized what made the difference in in my six but they're not perfect that's not what I'm trying to preach right but it gave her the time to instill certain things if you if you're if you were home these things change or if you are home amen uh you ought to thank God that that you you had those vital years to really uh interject Christ into the hearts of your children while you had the chance like I say things change well let me go into the next book because I'm gonna get in trouble but why he says we try to make our weaknesses excuses right now now watch the soundness of teaching see we we grow up watch this from the natural to the spiritual we grow up with no real understanding and all we see is our weaknesses our stutters people that stuff there's a lot of people that does different things is that right foreign but he said we try to make our weaknesses excuses he said we want to tell how big we are how great we are that's where we are now I'm telling you it takes real strength to stay humble the real power of the Holy Ghost go back to the choosing of a bride we got a lot of Chinese humility but not a lot of real humility we we see how how low we could bow right see amen but a real real great men make you feel special real real Great Men try to make you feel like you the man right amen we ain't hardly seeing that now things are changing see you know people might start up I'm preaching this because you see this in Ministry I thought I've been doing this for a little while now you you see people start off they they humble but once they start getting five or ten doors opening and then they get with a certain crowd of of of men right things start changing the attitudes start changing this position changes the way they walk changes right so and it should not be that way you setting yourself up for a fall when you do that but but you know it's it's hard to stay down know what he said now I'm paraphrasing it but I I can read and I can go get you the quote I don't have it but I know it's where it's at yeah see it's hard for Humanity to just you know stay humble because if we get too low we stop pulling ourselves up now that's too low right why we because we want to be something this this is where this is where we see a lot of mistake in young Ministry also all right come on we we this is this is why a lot of young ministers pull off my glasses down this is why a lot of young ministers don't go that far right because they cannot humble themselves and stay humble what now remember what my text right what God uses who God uses how God used right amen see and that's the problem you you see so much when me and brother Jack them we was coming up we just we just came up under that atmosphere you knew you had to be humble you had to be submissive you had to be respectful and you know and we didn't it didn't bother me even even As I Grew and started pastoring the church and all that I still gave homage to you know senior ministers no matter no matter how much I understood about the word and my ability to preach the word of God I still held them in high regards right as seniors you you see such a fallacy sometimes and I don't probe I I try to stay away from the things that people do but when I see things I say this hurts you know you see I saw a podcast I ain't gonna call nobody named nothing like that but I'm just gonna preach this right quick while I'm here now I I saw some young ministers and two sisters in a podcast right uh and they were going on and I I didn't look at it long I didn't want to indulge but I just I just watched the appearance of it I said first of all here's here's the first place where it's wrong the Bible says for a woman not to to to teach or to put ourselves in a place of authority over a man is that still in the Bible now unless y'all got another Bible than me huh is that right that's what the Bible said so when when you see something like this and you see the host a sister right then and there you know that that that's an error and and the information behind it ain't gonna be no good information I'm preaching now y'all may not like it but hey I'm gonna preach it right because it's writing it's writing the theme of what we're talking about this morning what God uses who God uses how God you see that that that's got to be the right approach this got to be the right approach and you say well why are you saying that be look I'm getting older brother Jack is getting older right that's got to be young men amen coming up behind us that'll be able to take the mantle you know we might get to the place where you know after some time where we might not want to preach but maybe wants to try some but let's let's look around us there's hardly no young men around the area that can take the medal they're not season enough they're not humble enough to sit down and be taught anything come on Church come on all right hey you listen to the information it's like man flesh and feel it it's intellectual religion we gonna get into that if we can all right we're probably gonna have time but right and this this is what kills young preachers right the moment the moment see can I can I preach see the first thing if the young ministers wanted to do something as young ministers they first should have gotten amen direct uh uh uh okay from the shepherd but because even brother Brown taught this he said you know what the shepherd should be at primary huh why why come on help me preach I know y'all don't shut me down y'all just told me to preach but now y'all don't want to preach with me come on help me with me huh is it too many how did he say that why because it's immaturity the devil right amen false information based upon feelings and bad experiences and things of that nature all right you may have had bad experiences in church but that's no reason Amen to to act in accordance to things that's not scripture yes people get hurt in church if you get hurt on your job if you get hurt in your home you'll get hurt at church you'll get hurt at the bus stop what's up but if you got hurt God allowed you to get hurt but God is still in the thing with you see how we try to use things as excuses I'm so hurt I'm so hurt have you ever sat back and thought that just maybe God you know what allow that thing to happen the sea what you would do now that's what brother Gene just preached y'all see y'all shout out I like the shot too but I can't get off that like I used to right this is true man yeah come on Derek amen they hurt me in Walmart you still go to Walmart if I get so hurt with them prices but I go right back up in there cause I said and I did I need me a river thank you well I've been offended hey I ain't going and then we hit him I ain't never seen so many people feel like they're on their way to the rapture we hit miss church so much this is absolutely what come on Church come on Church come on church where y'all tell me scripturally where we get that from now I'm gonna tell you what the Bible say now you give me a scripture I'll go for as you see that they approaching fail not fake facts then what about what what what is our excuses come on tell me to preach say preach Brothers all right because the preachers should stop preaching but I ain't gonna stop I feel good and I ain't even saying this to be mad right we need soundness of Doctrine right we fighting the devil right amen and we and I know we're weak and we we've heard it and all of that but let's not use these things as an excuse right if that was the case I would have been left walked away and never came back but I'm still here I'm still here oh man this ain't even about me this ain't about nothing but the word come on Church come on we don't went through so so we supposed to be moving forward what we're supposed to be getting about to change Church some of this stuff I can't even go with I just I just ain't in agreement with a lot of things that I see not as a servant of God I understand I understand the human element but we're going to get into that in a minute if we can I know I ain't got much time right come on Church yeah I I know the fight in the human element well I've I've been I've been hurt and I've gone through something and we've been missing and they say all of it is exhausting yeah right and and we want to use all of this to make excuses and God said I'm not accepting that though let me let me just say this let's start right here God is not accepting your excuses nor my excuses he ain't accepting that nope you say why you say that because the book is open come on now come on now because the book is open we have the mind of Christ we supposed to know what God wants done with his word come on now come on preach with me somebody glory to God we we have it's not coming we have so we we're without excuse amen amen right amen amen that was a time scripturally you know where God winked that the ignorance God ain't weaken at no ignorance right amen no not because he has revealed himself right he has exposed himself to his elect so he's not weakening anymore he's trying to get us off the fence and get us in line because a lot of us is out of step and if you add a step you ain't gonna rap because because the the church might rap you going this way but you you don't went that way all right I got a half a quote a quote and a half but I still got six pages ain't gonna preach the ball today y'all still with me y'all know me by now I haven't been here just about two years so y'all should be used to me I ain't gonna make no excuses for y'all now come on but Don't Preach better smiling stop it stop it right amen he says uh God gave me the he said that's why God gave me this check was to get that stuff out your mind right there's little things that we do and that's what we come to church for is to find out where our false is and the things that we might better ourselves by that's really our statement Church come on Church amen we want to find out our faults and see what it takes to better ourselves right sometimes we say things it might not make you feel good I I mean this thing that be preached I just have to say huh but it's doing me some good see we like to walk around like we ain't got no faults you don't lie you didn't lie in a lot we all have them don't nobody point no fingers at nobody we all have faults come on come on we all got them I know I got them but you got them too you can't get no more smokes out of my eye when you gotta beam me yours praise the Lord well Lord help us I ain't trying to hurt y'all feelings I'm just trying to preach preach well brother Branham sought that this was a good message to preach to the church why to give us soundness of Doctrine right that's that's what brother Jack does is giving us sound series on prayer soundness of Doctrine right all the other series is to give us soundness sound teaching right we shout and that's great but it's soundness of teaching the underlying effects of the whole thing okay almost done I got 10 minutes okay give me 10. all right hey man so he said if we come to church for any other objective than this she said I'm afraid we won't get much out of coming to church we must come to find out our weaknesses find our bad places what yes to see how little we are and to put our trust in somebody that's strong but when we when we have weaknesses we have strength come on church it's not to be offenses I'm not here to be offensive but I'm I'm here to bring soundness of Doctrine right because you know and I ain't gonna know it all but I do know some things and when you see things you'll be like oh man and I don't care how long you've been preaching your brother Brandon ordained you and all that that stuff don't mean nothing about a smile I ain't even impressed by none of that stuff who you are who your pastor is and how great a man can we we didn't die I just seen all of that nonsense all right in 30 years Great Men great preachers and we dancing y'all ain't this and we this we all can't use God can't use that like that right uh not according to what brother Branham amen being a sin is teaching us here right come on yeah yeah amen because because God can't use human ability no no no no no no amen he says there are so many of us like to testify likes to think that we're insufficient right now watch this statement because we got to have something that that we're standing on something that's solid right therefore we we make that an excuse I don't have no education I'm a living witness I guess I've said that I've have no ability I remember I'm I'm able to do this and he said but if you keep that up and do that in that way keep going like that then you can't amount to anything that's right right see as great as Moses was he came man I can't speak who asked you that first of all where did that even come from I never even what did you think did you think God let him off the hook with that speak [Music] I could make you speak now I got that much ability in me okay if that's the case because your brother he'll be your voice you'll be God he'll be the problem right see this is why our excuses don't mean anything to God see if God is calling you to something God's Got Your Back God's got it worked out while he was talking about what he couldn't do God already knew what he couldn't do I remember when I when I first took the church boys to cry all the time oh Lord have mercy them brothers used to come in and boy they would tell the church uh and I would just cry oh God no what am I gonna do the church in pieces Jesus ah I said don't worry about it you got some trials coming you got some work coming you got some trials coming he's gonna strengthen you It's Gonna Get You Up see well I was crying God God already knew I place you there the ability is there to do the job but I'm gonna need I'm gonna use this to pull the Lord have mercy I felt something huh it's all right see it's it's those things that pull the ability in this y'all still ain't with me come on somebody don't those trials and everything see it was through that way I I felt I felt vulnerable and I felt I felt weak and insufficient and God said I don't want everybody's on boy you gotta try out next week huh and when it came it was the gift of God in Me yelling myself to the Holy Ghost and it was the Holy Ghost in me that rose up but folks thought that they could manipulate and and put their thumb on you because the god in me I don't know where y'all think I come from but I I ain't that guy I ain't that guy one thing I know about that young man right there he ain't that guy huh that's right see people people think they can be smart and manipulative cause a man don't say nothing you getting by with nothing come on Church it don't my parents know what I'm talking about you know you know your children so well because they they they sneaking again but you ain't getting bad or not after a while they just come in I come in a minute let me talk to you for a second and you'll be sending that dumbfounded I do that all the time I knew when that started I knew when that started I just I just wanted to give you time to see if you would straighten that out but so since you ain't gonna straighten it out I'm going straight and help you straighten that out well praise the Lord see sometimes God be watching us and say see they ain't finished ain't trying to straighten that out well I'm gonna help him straighten it out right why because God knows amen uh what he's he's using who he gonna use how he can use you right see God can't use us in any old way in your fashion see and this is this is why I made reference I got a lot to go with I'm I'm gonna give it up that's why I made reference to to Young ministers and some of the things that we see and how I I I've watched the devil uh uh help me see Wipe Out the last generation oh young ministers wipe them out wipe them out why they couldn't come subservient to leadership two or three scriptures in a quote and because maybe they Grandma's a little bit better you know the pastor don't know nothing because you got an ability because you got the ability and I'm gonna get to the crazy part about the whole thing I'm gonna say this it's the pastor the one who taught you the majority of what you even know understand how folk could put my ex preachers above me with what they knew they got it from sitting up under the Holy Ghost Ministry come on y'all real quiet they're real quiet they grew from babies sitting up under a Ministry that God built and then they supersede where how that don't make sense that stuff don't make sense young ministers under brother Jack right you know the reason why they ain't preaching today they couldn't sit still they couldn't be obedient right people spoil babies when they don't get their way I'm going over here you ain't gonna get your way over there neither I told a brother one time I didn't felt like he he would call he took her you know what makes you think if you go over there you got a minute never had one never didn't work Church huh come on Church boy I tell you I wish I had another two hours that's what it's going to take to preach what I got right here and information right over the car look at this look take a look don't be afraid oh no I want to say that I don't want to see that I want to look look open your eyes all right open your eyes the reason why the Ministries ain't productive is because they could not yield human ability they couldn't separate human ability and to give two of these people start calling their name they call it my name God humble yourself did what he gave me the preacher I'm preaching and I ain't apologizing either soundness of Doctrine we gotta build on that right we we got to get a Biblical Foundation if not you gonna wreck up with that Ministry God know that God knows that you gonna wreck up cause you're gonna get lifted up I'm telling you I'm telling you see you you know I ain't that popular because I just say what's on my heart and they don't really like brother smiling because they feel like really smile is you know listen you can kind of see why a lot of people didn't get brother Brown's Ministry right they felt like it was it wasn't that he was trying to be difficult he was constantly trying to apologize but he was just trying to bring scripture soundness right because you can never really be used of God right without being sound and Doctrine I'll I'll say this I remember when I first started preaching some of y'all probably don't even remember this I first my first one or two sermons I preached at brother West picture I remember one of them to be made over on a New Year's Eve night and and I got shot down and I was happy that I got shut down was because we were being taught one thing and I was reading another thing and I couldn't put those two things together they weren't lining up right and so in my heart I was always like Lord I got to give account I got to be responsible then if then if I have to be responsible for what I'm preaching I got to know what I'm preaching come on and at that time I didn't know what I was preaching right I was starting to try to preach little you know things on faith you know because that's what we you know we was kind of taught that way I thought Lord have mercy right we we were talking things that people would come up to you I remember I had to preaching that little message some brothers came up to me and said we need to talk to you say okay all right see brother West Coast first they told me about another Ministry they Pastor preach this and the associate preached this and so you know our pastor he preaches this and so we got to preach this and I looked at them brothers I said where y'all get that from the pastor preached Revelation and we just preached Faith where do y'all get that from first of all show me that by the Bible right that ain't scriptural that's nonsense because because this is some brothers that's evangelizing can really break into some some things under under that but they evangelists right that's it they supersede the pastor we built differently right and I think as long as we could yield our vessels to God God could inspire you we know an evangelists normally is the five brand they normally come in like brother they're coming in a couple of weeks ago you know I kind of gave y'all a little upsert but he gonna stay down there now see I'm a little older than Diggs I like to be a little bit more poised you know but he gonna definitely run that out but I'm not brother D's I'm like brother land Nichols that see them young fellas up there kicking and stopping and screaming and all that when you get up there first thing he tell you I'm not an evangelist so don't expect me to act like one we built different and and right now you know I'm doing the work of an evangelist right I I have I have experience as the past 23 years but I know brother Jack the pastor I don't try to get in this way right amen but I know my thoughts my thought pattern is not necessary evangelistical I can be a little bit evangelistical but my thoughts amen is not evangelistical type thoughts all together right amen you can never push me back down into a little box it's too much too many years and too much experience but but I have enough experience to know that you know what brother Jack is is the shepherd and there's a there's lives that you know I'm not gonna cross because I used to pass I'm not gonna cross the certain there's certain lines right whether whether I could teach them or not teach them there's certain things I will not teach in this church I ain't gonna do and I learned that as an evangelist some of those things right amen I just it's just things that you know I'm not hit around on things but there's just certain things that you know a couple of things that I just to leave brother Jack has nothing to do with ability a capability because I you know I got here I can get down into some stuff now but I I just I just I just rather him to do right because he's how many can agree birthday Pastor right okay I want everybody to be clear on who the pastor like I told y'all when I first came here that first year because that the pastor don't ask me no questions you know and we'll be fine I laugh and joke with you when I'm up here I might tell a joke but I ain't joking I might tell a joke because like y'all should get too serious for y'all you know so I have to loosen you up a little bit but I ain't joking right yeah this is part one yeah because it's it's really it's really a lot it's really a lot and we we do not want to lose another generation of preachers we do we do I'ma say this so y'all we do not want to lose another generation of preachers then I mean we gotta wait till he grow up us up I don't know if you really gonna be called by that time but we'll see I just like to call the preachers because he reminds me so much of my son that's what Justin said his whole life until he stopped playing instruments he sat right on that front bro sippy cupping off bro and and so but we we got another generation of preachers coming up you know just just around the globe and and they gotta be they gotta be taught right they they got to be taught right I'm gonna say it like this too we got to be taught right too because I I I say this and let the musicians yeah because I saw a lot of things even in in some of the heads that one script because because there's got to be a nature and a character associated in the whole thing because he only identified by his characteristics is that right there's a lot in this message perfect stream by Perfect weakness now I just I told you I had six pages I read you three quotes so that means I got a whole lot of information right in years of years of watching watching things he okay how famous y'all made them that ain't right right amen because even as even as Leaders we got to have the right Spirit the right character right that that's why that's why I appreciate it brother that's why I'm here because he my brother-in-law no that's not why I'm here I'm here once this is what God told me to do okay and and because of his because of his his spirit right that that we hit this one let us stand we'll have a word of prayer and I'll turn it over to brother Jack y'all all right let's get the Lord a hand to pray that's about his gracious father we just give thanks and praise this morning We Appreciate You Sovereign Grace and your goodness and your kindness um Lord uh we I appreciate the word of God I I just feel like is the direction that you wanted me to go uh this morning and uh we just tried to be obedient uh to you to just your spirit leading the lord it's it's so much Lord God that we've been giving Lord through our seventh Angels message Lord and God which is looking at re-looking at things or to just make sure we are sound with sounding doctrine that begin to really use as you use it we have something that we could look back to and know that that we're stable that we're anchored we're just not just a group of fanatical people Corinthians Church they were still they had something but the thing was just so fanatical and out of order and you know Paul had to bring them soundness of Doctrine to settle them amen and placing order even brother Branham did it in COD taking these things and placing all these things so that we could be a sound group of people uh I mean there was times where even in the message he had to get on his own Pastor being a prophet and set him in order so that he wouldn't make a mistake with the gift in his life so Lord I Thank you I praise you oh God I appreciate this opportunity to just share this morning we just pray that you just continue to bless this little church Lord and just continue to lead us and guide us bless us Lord God open up that door that you'd have us to go in that we could set Our Roots Lord Lord I Thank you and I prayed for all things in Jesus name [Music] praise the Lord [Music] certainly appreciate brother smiley and today and um just the the thought of what God uses who God uses how God uses very uh and uh you know he's kind of bringing out things not and I just don't feel like he's here trying to pick on people that's that's not what that's going on it's actually trying to pick off and there was a you know a statement that brother random made out of the Statue of a perfect man um says so many of us trying to do the works of Christ before the reflection of Crisis so now there's the trouble they find those things happening you know it I know it you know it and I know it it says we see these stumbles along the road we find the scrap people Ministers of Christians and notice now he says the ministers are going to realize because what happens in the Pulpit starts affecting what's happening in the congregation and you get Scrappy of ministers and of Christians piled along the side up side of road and the reason brother random said it's like this he says because they didn't go into it right and uh you know as he was just saying you know we come from a generation where we we respected our elders we didn't always agree with our illness but we respected our elders [Music] amen and you I mean and sometimes you know you might have conversations with somebody about something that you didn't you know agree with but you have enough respect to know when to hush your mouth can I just put it that way you knew when to stop talking right because if that will get you over a little bit too far now you don't got took on a spear and you don't even know how you got it on you oftentimes you know y'all can be seated just for a moment I'm gonna change the order of the service but oftentimes um people will see that a pastor will make a decision [Music] sometimes the pastor's doing that because he has a little bit more information than what you have sometimes you only see just a little bit and you're making a decision based on a little bit that you see oftentimes you know uh I I I I'll say it like this uh I've learned in over the years is that I can come out here and just kind of crush certain things immediately but oftentimes I learned that if I crush this one person it's gonna affect this person's gonna affect this person's gonna affect this person I even lost a whole family and sometimes you just gotta let God just work things out and I appreciate sister Dixon years ago she gave me some wisdom and I will never I'll never forget it I'll never let it go she gave me that wisdom you know out of James 120 and all she did to pass I just want you to read this scripture I say okay James 1 20. the wrath of man does not work the righteousness of God I look baby [Music] and I was trying to come up with a a a a response let me uh let me come up with something no no no I had nothing to say but thank you sister thank you sister praise the Lord I learned that you know you can't do this in your own righteousness and all my brother smile said we learned some lessons over the years and and those scrap heaps that's on the side of the road the God that I served he's able to get him off the side of the road and put them back in service and I believe God can do that uh but I do I do know it's going to take some humility that prodigal son came back home and come back with no chest out like he was blessed with being out there no no no he lost every you know that's that's people trying to turn that story around you know really but you know it was one Soul save so God must have been using it I ain't gonna you on that one Soul being safe but you know you had a bad Spirit you need to repent God can use you again oh I just love the Lord what God uses who God uses how God uses keep it in the word y'all keep it in the word [Music] um I told you this morning that we had a precious brother with us uh the Lord has blessed him in his ministry to pray for sick and uh and God has heard many of his prayers people have been sick he was telling me the other night that someone that had um cancer in three places in their body and after you pray God brought healing to that person um in all three places in the body and um um I just appreciate you know just the fellowship that it did have with them because uh brother Darren just told me I used to run from this he just ran from it didn't feel like he was worthy to be able to do it but how God just uh caused him to surrender amen and now God has just really been blessing his ministry and with him being here today I I didn't know who all would be here but I knew whoever would be here God intended for this to happen and um uh brother George just tell them we had two sisters that came they were coming to visit one of the other churches over here and they weren't having service so they heard us and they came to be with us so God bless you all thank you I'm so good to have you all with us I don't thank you nearby accident or by mistake brother Darren amen I just want to change the order of service if you would just come and just kind of take the pulpit if you would just kind of share a few testimonies we will open the floor for anybody that wants to be prayed for I want to tell you something about about prayer prayer is open to any and everybody healing is open to any and everybody uh you don't have to be a Christian in order to get a healing but in order to keep your healing that's where you have to talk about becoming a Christian but right here on the spot he he could tell the testimon that God did things instantaneously to people others it might have been amen just a span of time but however God wants to use our brother we want him to just come and share from his heart and those that would want to be praying for we want to give opportunity for that this morning even if you want to stand in the gap for somebody you want to give opportunity for that God is still God he's the same yesterday today and forever brother Darren God blessed if you would come at this time foreign Jesus Christ let's just say sure Dear God you know why I'm here I'm not here in Personal Agenda I don't have a hidden agenda I believe oh God my desire is for your agenda to take over now I've come Lord as thy servant I've come to do precisely what he called me to and that's why I'm here so father I just commit this part of the service into your hands Lord we are fully aware of time and strength Lord we know that time is always a problem on this planet in which we live but dear God I ask now May the words of my mouth the meditation of my heart may they be acceptably life cycle oh God Jesus Christ amen God bless his Saints um try and relax for a few minutes I'm gonna do my very best to try and speak within about 10 minutes we'll pray so it is very tight I have a lot to say but I won't say too much I'm aware of time so the first thing I need to say is to thank brother Jack give me an opportunity to say a few words to you this congregation it certainly isn't easy faster you know just some random brother from the United Kingdom Jesus had a sense of humor so we're going to calm down a bit now I'm gonna get you to relax a bit you know and this random brother has just landed from the UK and I appreciate brother Jack because why this stupid is a sacred place okay and brother Jack is a shepherd and he has to protect you yeah his sheep from you know the untold spiritual harm that can take place by letting ravening wolves into the hope now you're going to be very pleased to know that by the grace of God I can safely and humbly say not to happen involved Hallelujah let's praise the Lord for that amen phew I'm glad I got that out of the way what a relief so all I'm here to do I am here to put my shoulder to the wheel your pastor can pray for you right Deacon can pray for you your Elder can pray for you right all I am here to do is to put my shoulder to the wheel there might just be one of you in here even if it's one that might have a certain issue that seems to be prolonging itself in your life I am that brother whom God has given a gift to come and help you that's it I do not have a personal agent and you need to I need to make that very clear Hallelujah so my wife is here with me this is by the grace of God we've been married for 36 years some of you maybe are not even 36 years old right we've been married for 36 years and allow me to say after our precious Brother Willie Smiley spoke some very touchy things there bro God bless you I appreciate your man who can take the word brother there are not many people that touch on some quotes like that things are very sensitive in the layout just in church age but I'm gonna put food out there and I'm going to say in complimenting what the brother said you see behind every good man there is a good moment let's take it up a notch behind every really good man is a really good woman okay and here we go getting sensitive but I'm gonna support now that quote is a quote the prophet did say check it out in the table when a woman leaves the kitchen she is out of her position that is a quote I didn't say it brother Branham City okay now we're just gonna just bring this in a little bit and say reason why it's so important is that a woman in the home is the backbone of a Nation what a woman a wife a beloved wife can do in the home is more than even pastors deacons ministers can do from behind this desk a woman's role in the home is of Paramount importance to Future Leaders preachers pastors so don't you sisters ever underestimate your role in the home we are in laodicea it is an age of female empowerment sisters humbly I say do your very best to fight it because I we're all aware of what's going on but your role is vital I have three daughters I am aware of what it's like for young sisters to want to have a career know about all that right if you want your career and you're single have that career when you get married reconsider your position just reconsider it and say okay do I want to continue to be CEO in this if that's your aim book you do what you're gonna do but remember there's a price to pay in the family okay because you have to bring up your children Your Role is to bring those kids up to love and serve the Lord and that role is vital I'm gonna repeat that the role of a woman in the home is vital us Brothers can only do so much but honestly a woman is essentially in the home and I want to take this opportunity to ask my wife to stand up and I am going to say sister Ellen block is my beloved wife thank you for everything you have done in our home and in bringing up our children she is an example of what a woman is supposed to be so God bless you honey it's all right you know we've been blessed our Union has been blessed with four children son Daniel is 35 three daughters as I said Bethel is 33 Lydia is 31 and April is 29. by the grace of God we have eight grandchildren okay Mila is five and Rafa is 14 months that's my son Daniel's children and we've got Michael who's five and rare which is seven months it's bethel's children and there's Lydia's children annalize she's 12 people in Genesis of Wednesday night and then Levi as well he is four so I was going to talk a little bit about our trip but I do not have time for that it just suffice us to say that I appreciate brother Jack I appreciate for the content but this condo we're staying in I'm really humbled because it's literally like I've got an Airbnb place which would cost me a tiny Fortune here in West Palm Beach it's gonna cost a fortune but um you know I'm in the land of FOC I'm a man of acronyms I'm in the land of free of charge the Life free of charge my a love free of charge so I appreciate brother Jeff I appreciate sister run a teacher my daughter April is a teacher in the Cayman Islands tyronda took a day out yesterday is it Shonda sorry yeah sorry it's Shonda I appreciate sister Sean and it's Pritchard for taking a time out she had to do some planning for school because school opens on Monday and she literally took us from shop to shop to shop she sat in the car doing her planning and the day ended nicely at the beach and we all just you know waded into the sea and we had a really nice time I thank you I thank brother Jerry for picking us up from Miami Airport driving us all the way you know I I genuinely I'm I'm very quick from my heart I appreciate it you see these kind gestures don't take them lights out I know Americans are big in the heart as well you know in the UK it's kind of different it's kind of different in the UK um but no these things are bigger what you've done for me and my wife it's huge and I really want to appreciate that brother Jack and everyone who helped us out I'm so grateful brother you know brother concerned about that that house out there for ministers to use that that's so so beautiful so I I bring you greetings from Brother dark that's our pastor and the saints of God at the original World Fellowship we did we Fellowship in Northampton two and a half hours north of center of London so as the brother said I'm here in trunks to the Cayman Islands and my daughter has a two-year contract there and so my desire is wherever I can just passed by and do a little bit of work for the law maybe God willing you can you can tell I've got so much to say maybe God willing in the future if brother Jack will have me if you will have me and my wife I will gladly come at some point in the future service and just try and tell you what's on my heart so I'm gonna come now we're going to start moving towards evening uh we don't have time we don't have time for a full-on prayer line I can't listen to every single request away because there could be another hour we don't have time I want you to listen very carefully now to what happens listen very carefully as the French would say hey yeah listen well the inspiration that God has given me for today it's just one word and that word is now now gonna say it again now that means at the present time the present moment and it's not in the past and it's not in the future now God said to Moses I am that I am that is a now God all right he's a present time God he's not in the past is not in the future he is a now God he said in Ezekiel but I know the things that come into your mind every one of them what you're thinking right now about this random brother from the United Kingdom but it's picked that up he he knows your very thoughts right now so if you are under expectation right now to receive something from God you're going to get it now I am this inspiration is driving me because I am tired of seeing God's people suffer okay this is not an age for suffering this is your time it's now time all right and in Ezekiel again he said they shall none of my words be prolonged anymore [Music] you're healing manifestation your requirement I don't care what it is job car house you want to drive a plane a helicopter I don't know what that is but whatever that is I am telling you the inspiration God has given me they show none of my words be prolonged anymore but the word which I have spoken shall be done it shall be done I'm beginning to get a little excited because he's gone this message is true I don't read quotes for them to remain in the message books I don't have no Table app on my phone which is a lovely iPhone 13 Pro Max by the way I don't I don't have a table in there so I can quote the quotes yeah yeah praise God for the quotes those quotes Lord I humbly say becoming a part of me I am the quote you you need to get those quotes out of the table app out of the lifeline app you must become the quote and I'm telling you from experience by the grace of God I am a q b e I'm a q b e I am qualified by experience I am a man who is qualified by experience I have been trained by God for this purpose and I'm going to tell you again now is your time I'm not gonna have time to pray for every one of you we will do we'll do a fast prayer line because that's all that's all we got but these hands I'm gonna say this homily know who I am okay brother you know don't misunderstand me don't do not misunderstand me I'm not the pompous guy no no exactly where I know exactly what I've been called to do and because Satan knows about this I am fought at a big level the brother was talking about marriages yeah I'm telling you 36 years of marriage don't you ever think that it was all roses ain't roses you need to understand marriage is hard work you want to get married you better be sure you want to get married you be sure you'll be prayed up and God will lead you to the right woman but it's not a bit of roses we all have trials and tribulations and a marriage that's been there for 36 years old Satan will attack you in a big way and you'll shake you so you may think you've been married a couple years and it's all going Grand wonderful enjoy it enjoy the moment because this coming a time when a child is going to hit you may hit you real hard so God bless your marriages God bless my marriage 36 years with my wife she's a wonderful woman now the Bible says are we the sons of God now are we the daughters of God the third pool is here the third Paul is in The Ether ways it's here all right spoken word creation is in the bright spoken word creation is in you okay it's in you I want to say these few words now is the hour for the third pull power let's say it again now is the hour for the third pull power and now is the hour for spoken word creation power the time is now it is not tomorrow and it is not next week and it's not next year it's now and the bride Revival is now and just like that little police Welshman he said to the great doctors of divinity turned back College from USA interestingly they wanted to know where the Welsh Revival was at and what did he say sir you have a right I am the Welsh Revival the Welsh Revival is in me here is where it's at so I'm telling you the bride Revival is in you and when it comes to healing and deliverance now I'm gonna quote the scripture which almost every Christian Knows by heart all right and if you don't I strongly suggest you learn it by heart Isaiah 53 verse 5. but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed does everyone agree that we are healed is a present tense now statement it is not in the past and it is not in the future it is now okay and it's already been done Jesus Paid the price for you on the cross of Calvary and with these Stripes you are healed it's now I've got one quote if God came down and healed me positive right up with a Merc y's brother Brandon it wouldn't it would not be as great as it would be if I can see the promise of God and take it into my heart stand it I can say Jesus is now healing for I have accepted these words it's in my heart he is now interceding for me before the father I shall be well there is what God loves stand there on his word and say it's right he's healing me now every day the prophet said now is the time to be healed no matter what is wrong with you no matter what is wrong with you I am a QBE when I preach I am preaching from experience as well I have tested these quotations that the prophet speaks about and when the prophet tells you to hold on to the word of God and testify I speak from experience God has given me Grace it is rare humbly I say it is where the representative doctor because my first protocol is the word of God and God has graciously healed over and over and over again so I am telling you that this message of the hour is true it works every time do not ever be discouraged whatever you want if it's that mansion you testify about your Mansion if it is your church you need to testify about your church as in I thank God for our new church my it has a Sunday school room it has a particular storage room it has this oh Lord how we thank you for our church God we appreciate you you thank God for your job Lord Jesus even if you're earning 25 000 US Dollars which made you buy a few cokes but you know I don't know these days so tough here if you want an 80k job if you want a 100K job hey man you set what you want now is the hour for you to receive what you want I'm not coming from the UK with some this is what God has told me to come and tell you now time for you to get it now stop waiting because if you keep waiting and waiting we're running out of time we won't go into church ages but if we look at the number of years and this is supposed to be the shortest Church age yeah 1906 at 116 years 2022 is kind of like now is the time I want that job now I want your house now you want to drive a plane now it's time to get it stop waiting you got the power you got the quotes now do it so I'm going to give you one testimony I got strings of them by the grace of God I'll give you one test to me because of time and this is what happened when the ministry was manifested in my life for the very first time it happened completely unexpected all that happened is my teenage daughter the youngest one April just around about 13. just in the early team at the time April used to play netball netball everybody I want you to listen to this test because unfortunately in the message there's a lot of legalism in the message of legalism a daughter a teenage girl playing netball we all know what natural children were don't we yes remember God will deal with April who's 13. different to the way he will deal with brother Jack or myself a man I'm in my 50s this was a April's desire was for Daddy to go and watch Network hey message believer going to go watch girls playing Network ideal listen carefully I didn't want to I know about aware of the message all about it but my daughter at that time really well in a team and she said yeah okay I'm going to go watch the nip went to the network April was playing she was playing defense very good at it when April jumped up in defense to get the ball when she landed one point in the game what was over like that complete it's almost like it snaps she was done for you it was over the game was done she could not play the game anymore well this is a child of 13. it was dead yes taking the time out to come and watch so she really wanted to play Nepal watch how God works now I did I I did not go looking for this you need to understand this I didn't go looking for this they were on the netball Court my daughter April is very upset on the court in front of all those white people around me my daughter April asks me quite to my amazement Dad can you please pray for me um in a worldly environment watching Nepal come on guys legalism legalistic guys I said those guys his brother's gone gone shorts it's gone I'm on the I'm on the I'm on the nipple Court and I simply laid hands on aprils and they said Lord Jesus according to your word use it I put God in the corner now you see my you tell God today God use it they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover Lord God I cannot heal anyone no You Are the Healer I lay hands upon my daughter according to her faith my Jesus said according to your faith it has nothing to do with my faith according to April's Faith the desire was strong she wanted to play Nepal she wanted the daddy to watch the faith was high a laid hands upon her and all I can tell you is that this is what happened I'll demonstrate April was on the floor like that she couldn't walk I laid hands upon it she did this she got up she stood and she started walking and said Dad I'm Healed dad whoa and she continued to play in that netball tournament and that's how we give first manifested in an environment which you would never ever consider now that same Jesus is the mighty healer and he is here today and he wants to take care of you I cannot I I don't have time one time I prayed for our dog which was very sick I will not give the full Testament at some point I will in the future I laid hands upon our dog and it was as if a bolt of lightning came from my hands I honestly God healed the dog that was sick for three days it hadn't eaten at all it was fading away and dying but after I lay down on that dog it somehow started walking not only that it ran down the stairs and went and get his food and started eating and eating and God healed a dog miraculously I prayed for another man who loved his dog and God saved him three thousand British pounds in vetfield because God healed his dog I have prayed for a Hoover I have prayed for a Hoover not my faith no my wife's Faith she said Darren this hoop pray for it I'm just as beholders that I'm bewildered here this is someone is asking me to pray for a hookah because this Hooper was smelling of burnt wires it was gone I laid hands upon it and I said Lord God verse Hoover is sick and use it Hallelujah time to tell God what he said you said they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover yeah the word of God is quick and Powerful sharper than any Jewish sword piercing even to the divining a son of Soul and Spirit and of the joints of marrow and it is a discern of the thoughts and intents of the heart and it will go into a Hoover it will go into your mobile phone it will go into a stove they were going to the fridge hold on somebody's cop it will go into a car it will go into a car a car will work A Car Works in the name of Jesus Christ and a car works now a car works now that Hoover I laid hands on the Hoover and I you know I just said hey Ellen you got so much faith

is the message of the hour I present unto you my brothers and sisters in Christ now is the hour for you to receive whatsoever you desire now we're gonna Pray by God's grace if the musicians can give us maybe the great position or anything to do along those lines of God our time is far spent God bless your hearts we can have a prayer line very quick one I will lay hands upon you say what's upon your heart quickly I'll simply lay hands upon you and ask God's place I have not got the time to pray for everyone because of time God bless you believe now if you can believe I am telling you from experience no matter what the symptoms are you just say Lord God on the 27th of November there was some random brother by the way my name is Darren but even if you don't remember that that doesn't
