[4:03] um just as i was approaching
[4:08] this week and just just just considering
[4:12] so much
[4:16] christmas is a time i think that causes
[4:20] the entire world
[4:21] to have to think about what it's really
[4:24] all about
[4:25] and i think it's an opportunity for us
[4:27] as believers to
[4:29] sometimes let people know what it's all
[4:31] about
[4:33] i was just walking in a restaurant i
[4:35] think it was yesterday
[4:38] mentioned to a person say merry
[4:40] christmas
[4:41] it's a um i said
[4:47] yeah thanks or something like that and
[4:50] uh
[4:50] you know but it's like they are almost
[4:53] in prison
[4:55] where they they can't use the terms
[4:57] merry christmas
[4:58] you know they're in the um and their
[5:01] work establishments and
[5:02] you know and it's just um the world has
[5:05] gotten so far away from
[5:07] uh from what this is all about and you

[5:10] i thought to myself you know i know that
[5:12] we were going to try to put together a
[5:14] little program tonight and that didn't
[5:15] work out but
[5:16] that didn't mean that we couldn't come

[5:23] things
[5:24] uh i mean the world doesn't realize he

[5:42] savior we

[5:55] right just
[5:56] making sure our priorities are right
[5:59] that uh that you know that our hearts
[6:02] are right

[6:16] announcement

[20:48] my god my god amen
[20:52] um tell you what i will
[20:56] just read a quick scripture here
[20:59] [Music]
[21:00] um you know this is uh
[21:04] maybe i'll just read from matthew 2.
[21:07] um let me just see something here
[21:11] you know i'll save that for a little
[21:15] later but
[21:16] um you know this is this is what it's
[21:19] all about
[21:20] and let's i think it's luke 2 that i
[21:23] want to read uh
[21:24] initially um but i think it's important
[21:28] that we
[21:29] just take time
[21:31] [Music]
[21:35] and
[21:36] [Music]
[21:38] just reflect on what happened
[21:41] some 2000 years ago
[21:44] um we gotta always
[21:47] keep this in mind amen when we get to
[21:50] this season
[21:51] here in luke luke two i just wanna read
[21:54] and this is just the the christmas story
[21:58] [Music]
[22:03] and just reading from verse
[22:07] verse one i was telling brother quentin
[22:10] a little earlier
[22:12] it's not often that we even take too
[22:15] many sermons really on the birth of the
[22:16] lord jesus
[22:18] and i said you know what tonight would
[22:20] be a good time just to take a
[22:22] little thought and just kind of talk
[22:24] about what happened you know during that
[22:26] time and
[22:27] and um just just reflect on
[22:31] what god did for us when he left us
[22:33] thrown in glory
[22:35] to come bring to us redemption story
[22:37] [Music]
[22:38] amen
[22:40] this is probably um
[22:43] i think so many people just we we we we
[22:46] we get so wrapped up and we just forget
[22:50] what the real what the what it's really
[22:52] all about
[22:54] right and and i just want us to just
[22:55] kind of go back and just look at this
[22:57] here the
[22:57] verse in chapter 2 says and it came to
[23:00] pass in those days
[23:03] it went out a decree from caesar
[23:06] augustus that all the world should be
[23:08] taxed
[23:10] and i was just thinking about this as we
[23:11] were reading from psalms
[23:13] [Music]
[23:14] 148 and it talked about how
[23:17] [Music]
[23:18] god is even in the midst of a storm and
[23:22] this is a storm condition that
[23:25] mary and joseph find themselves in i
[23:27] mean she's in
[23:28] her third trimester she's on the back
[23:31] getting us getting herself ready to get
[23:33] on the back of a donkey to go and give
[23:35] birth i mean to go back to the city in
[23:36] which
[23:37] they were originally from and didn't
[23:39] realize that that time should give birth
[23:41] she knew she was close to it
[23:42] but this was a very difficult time for
[23:44] her to be traveling but yet
[23:46] she was following the decree of the
[23:49] leader of that day
[23:50] a stormy condition come in their life
[23:52] but yet the word of god
[23:54] is being fulfilled look at this
[23:58] verse 2 says in this tax it was first
[24:00] made when
[24:01] cyrenius was governor syria all went to
[24:04] be taxed everyone
[24:05] into his own city and joseph also went
[24:07] up from galilee out of the city of
[24:09] nazareth
[24:11] into judea unto the city of david
[24:14] which is called bethlehem
[24:18] because he was of the household and
[24:20] lineage of david
[24:23] to be taxed with mary as a spouse wife
[24:26] being great
[24:27] with child and so it was that while they
[24:30] were there
[24:31] the days were accomplished that she
[24:33] should be
[24:34] delivered she brought forth her first
[24:37] born son and wrapped him
[24:39] in swaddling clothes and laid him in a
[24:41] manger
[24:42] because there was no room for them in
[24:45] the end and that question
[24:47] still presents itself tonight does god
[24:50] still have room
[24:52] amen to dwell in your heart praise the
[24:54] lord does god still have room have we
[24:56] made room for him
[24:58] have we have we made time for him praise
[25:01] the lord there was no room
[25:02] for them in the end there were
[25:05] the same country shepherds abiding in
[25:07] the field keeping watch over their flock
[25:09] by night
[25:10] and lo the angel of the lord came upon
[25:12] them in the glory of the lord shone
[25:14] round about them and they were sore
[25:16] freed
[25:17] the angel said unto them fear not for
[25:19] behold i bring you good tidings of great
[25:22] joy which shall be
[25:23] to all people amen for unto you
[25:27] is born this day in the city of david a
[25:30] savior which is christ
[25:33] the lord and this
[25:37] shall be a sign unto you ye shall find
[25:40] the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes
[25:43] lying in a manger
[25:45] and suddenly there was with the angel
[25:47] multitude of the heavenly hosts
[25:50] praising god and saying glory to god in
[25:53] the highest
[25:54] on earth peace good will toward men that
[25:56] came to pass as the angels were going
[25:58] away from them into heaven
[26:00] the shepherd said one to another let us
[26:02] now go even unto bethlehem and see this
[26:04] thing which has come to pass
[26:06] which the lord hath made known unto us
[26:09] he came with haste and found mary and
[26:11] joseph and the babe lying
[26:13] in a manger and when they had seen it
[26:15] they made known abroad the saying which
[26:17] was
[26:18] told them concerning this child and all
[26:21] they that heard it wandered at those
[26:23] things which
[26:24] were told them by the shepherds but mary
[26:26] kept all these things and pondered them
[26:28] in her heart
[26:29] and the shepherds returned glorifying
[26:31] and praising god
[26:33] for all the things that they had heard
[26:35] and seen
[26:36] and it was told unto them amen the lord
[26:40] had a blessing to the reading

[27:39] um i guess it was the 21st which would
[27:43] be monday night
[27:44] um where the planet of i believe jupiter
[27:48] and saturn
[27:50] they in the in in the in the uh
[27:53] when you look at it in the sky at night
[27:55] it seemed like they had become
[27:57] one like you could only see uh one uh
[28:00] one planet they were they were
[28:02] passing uh one another and they called
[28:05] it the
[28:06] uh the great conjunction
[28:09] right and as they were passing one
[28:11] another
[28:12] uh it looked as if it was just one one
[28:15] big bright
[28:16] star but actually was it was they're two
[28:18] planets
[28:19] and they're they're still very far away
[28:22] from one another but yet
[28:24] uh a lot of people are looking at this
[28:26] as some great sign
[28:28] you know and and um i had to be very
[28:31] careful i was you know just trying to
[28:32] figure out what was going on because i
[28:33] know that you know signs
[28:35] um do happen god uses you know things in
[28:38] in the
[28:38] uh the heavens declares glory you know
[28:40] so we know god can use those things
[28:42] but uh you know you have to be careful
[28:44] when you're researching things like that
[28:46] because
[28:47] uh astrologers get a hold of that
[28:49] information and
[28:51] they will have you for thrown for some
[28:53] loops
[28:55] right so you have to be very very
[28:56] careful uh but there was you know a
[28:58] little something that i that i found and
[29:00] and they were just making a statement
[29:02] that you know sometimes when things like
[29:03] this happen they said this hadn't
[29:04] happened
[29:05] uh the way it happened uh for us in like
[29:08] 800 years that that hadn't happened
[29:10] and also there were some sites saying
[29:12] that they believed that this is the same
[29:15] type of event that would have occurred
[29:16] uh when the lord jesus was actually
[29:19] being born you know they they believe
[29:20] that uh people have all kind of things
[29:23] you know uh that they believe in
[29:25] we're not you know we can't put
[29:26] confidence in a lot of that we just put
[29:28] our confidence in the word of god
[29:30] and uh you know what we do know is that
[29:32] um the wise men did see a star
[29:35] amen i'm gonna read a couple quotes for
[29:37] you here tonight
[29:38] the wise men did see a star not only
[29:40] that brother branham told us that
[29:42] mary and joseph saw a star praise the
[29:45] lord
[29:46] amen and and uh and i can tell you
[29:48] tonight
[29:50] uh while everybody else is outside
[29:53] they actually called this great
[29:54] conjunction they actually call it the
[29:56] christmas star
[29:58] right that's what that's what they call
[29:59] it now uh that and and they're
[30:02] unfortunately many of them are uh
[30:05] looking at things and they're tying the
[30:07] birth of the lord jesus
[30:09] into you know this star showing but we
[30:11] with revelation know that jesus was not
[30:13] born on december 25th
[30:15] amen we realized that so you know uh
[30:18] we don't we can't put a lot of weight in
[30:20] things like that but we realize
[30:22] he wasn't born on december 25th our lord
[30:24] and savior was born
[30:25] in the springtime because that's when
[30:28] all
[30:28] lambs are born amen that's when all
[30:32] lambs are born so
[30:34] you know but i wanted to just kind of
[30:35] bring it back to you know i i know
[30:37] the the the uh the the i would say just
[30:41] uh the world you know because this this
[30:43] passing of saturn and
[30:45] and uh and jupiter you know um this i
[30:48] mean like everybody all over the world
[30:50] had the ability to be able to see it
[30:52] you know i mean no matter where you were
[30:54] if there was nothing hindering your
[30:55] vision
[30:56] uh you had the ability to be able to see
[30:58] this so this was this was something very
[30:59] special
[31:00] and uh you know i said mary and joseph
[31:02] saw
[31:03] the star amen the wise men saw the star
[31:07] but i
[31:08] also want to say that we have seen a
[31:10] start
[31:11] praise god amen
[31:14] one of the stars that was in the hand of
[31:17] jesus according to the book of
[31:18] revelation chapter one
[31:20] we saw a star amen and and the purpose
[31:24] of a star
[31:25] is actually to point you to jesus
[31:28] praise the lord amen the the star is not
[31:31] to bring you to themselves but the stars
[31:34] actually
[31:34] to bring you into the presence of the
[31:37] lord jesus
[31:38] hallelujah amen so so we have seen a
[31:40] star and
[31:41] and and and one of the things that i
[31:42] guess that um uh
[31:44] i i i wish that you know the way
[31:46] everybody took out their telescopes
[31:49] and everybody uh took out their
[31:51] binoculars
[31:52] you know and you know some could see it
[31:54] just with the naked eye they would stand
[31:56] outside and they would look at this
[31:58] what they call the christmas star they
[32:00] would look at it and
[32:01] and they would just uh observe it and
[32:03] you know just be take their pictures and
[32:05] post their pictures and
[32:06] you know and everybody saw the star good
[32:08] god almighty
[32:09] and i would just i would i guess the
[32:11] thing that that that gets in my spirits
[32:13] like i
[32:14] wish they could see the other star amen
[32:16] that i
[32:17] that i saw hallelujah that they could
[32:20] see the star
[32:21] according to revelation chapter one
[32:24] amen because once you can see that then
[32:27] you can see more
[32:28] about god amen then you can understand
[32:30] more about god
[32:31] so you know i just i just i you know i
[32:34] look at how
[32:34] everybody uh is just so excited and one
[32:37] of the things that you know i heard that
[32:39] someone said
[32:40] uh i was reading this and they said you
[32:41] know when this
[32:43] this this this conjunction happens this
[32:45] great conjunction
[32:46] see a lot of things begin to change on
[32:48] the earth and they say one of the things
[32:51] that changes
[32:52] is a cultural shift
[32:55] that's what they said now i don't know i
[32:57] i mean i i i don't have any scripture to
[32:59] support anything they say i'm just
[33:01] telling you
[33:01] what they say but one of them that says
[33:03] a cultural shift
[33:05] praise the lord amen and and uh
[33:09] they they say sometimes when this
[33:11] happens it is a change in administration
[33:14] amen government administration right you
[33:16] know so
[33:17] um we got a lot going on in our nation
[33:20] and
[33:21] and i'm gonna tell you it seems like the
[33:22] whole world is
[33:24] watching what is happening here in the
[33:26] united states of america
[33:28] praise the lord and i mean as i talk to
[33:31] different people
[33:31] it's i've never seen a nation divided
[33:35] the way it's divided now i mean i've
[33:37] never seen people get so upset that they
[33:40] will not
[33:41] accept the results of the election
[33:44] amen i mean their churches praying for a
[33:47] reversal
[33:48] oh my god i mean fasting and praying for
[33:52] a reversal of the election
[33:54] my god right and and we don't we don't
[33:57] realize that
[33:58] you know this this world our our leaders
[34:02] amen are not our saviors
[34:06] and let me put it it's not our savior we
[34:08] don't have saviors we got one savior his
[34:11] name is jesus
[34:12] amen so our leaders are not our savior
[34:15] so you know
[34:16] no political party can stop anything but
[34:19] they said that star
[34:20] represents a cultural shift
[34:24] hallelujah and i mentioned this before
[34:27] that uh you know when we already know
[34:30] that certain parties stand for certain
[34:31] things the reason people would pay
[34:33] pray is because they don't want to see
[34:35] certain things go forth in the country i
[34:36] realize that i don't want to see it
[34:39] either glory to god i don't want to see
[34:42] it either
[34:43] every time i talk to somebody and you
[34:44] know they they so excited about this
[34:46] change of administration
[34:48] i say now you realize jesus did say
[34:52] praise the lord as it was in the days of
[34:54] lot so shall it be in the coming of the
[34:56] son of man
[34:56] so when i come to realize i can't pray
[34:58] against scripture
[35:00] amen amen i i can't pray i have to
[35:03] accept scripture i don't accept sin but
[35:05] i do accept scripture
[35:07] and in order for you know in order for
[35:10] hallelujah to the lamb of god
[35:12] in order for us to go on a rapture amen
[35:15] these conditions must be
[35:18] do you realize that when it got so bad
[35:20] down in sodom
[35:22] god sent two angels down to bring his
[35:25] bring his elect out and actually i mean
[35:28] lot was a make-believer
[35:30] and if god was so concerned about
[35:32] abraham's
[35:33] prayer at a time like that that he would
[35:36] bring lot out
[35:37] then what do you think how do you think
[35:39] god thinks about
[35:40] us so i tell you what i'm looking for
[35:42] amen not just a cultural shift
[35:45] amen i'm looking for a heavenly shift
[35:49] praise god as the culture shifts amen
[35:52] i'm looking for the bride to be
[35:54] elevated and taken to another level in
[35:56] christ get closer and closer to him
[35:59] church
[36:00] i'm looking for that body change one of
[36:02] these years we're going to step
[36:03] into it amen it's going to be the last
[36:06] year for the bride on the earth
[36:07] because there's a rapture awaiting us
[36:10] hallelujah so i you know i want to just
[36:13] read a couple quotes here and
[36:15] amen you know they they they have what
[36:17] they're looking at is their christmas
[36:19] star this
[36:20] this this conjunction of amen they call
[36:23] it a great conjunction because
[36:24] i believe these are the two largest
[36:26] planets saturn and and uh and jupiter
[36:29] but uh you know and they're looking at
[36:31] all of that but you know that that's
[36:32] that's hallelujah you know if they get
[36:35] something out of it that's fine but i'm
[36:36] looking at the word of god
[36:38] amen so here you know the prophet makes
[36:40] a statement i'm going to this message
[36:42] church of the living god
[36:44] the church of the living god and it says
[36:47] um
[36:48] when alone came the virgin born
[36:52] divine son of god and he was god's
[36:55] provided lamb
[36:56] provided sacrifice jehovah jireh the
[36:59] provided one
[37:00] and as he was born and the people of
[37:02] that day of his day especially the
[37:04] religious
[37:05] people did not believe him because he
[37:08] never come in a classical way
[37:10] that they expected him but he came
[37:13] humble
[37:14] born in a manger wrapped in swaddling
[37:17] cloth
[37:18] there was no singing at his birth
[37:21] hallelujah
[37:22] notice this there was no singing at his
[37:24] birth
[37:25] and there is a king's uh and he says um
[37:28] and as there is a king's birth
[37:31] so when kings are born the people
[37:34] typically sing right but here the king
[37:37] of kings has been born
[37:38] and there's no singing at his birth
[37:41] hallelujah
[37:42] that's why i like to come to the house
[37:43] of god and like to offer my christmas
[37:46] praise
[37:47] hallelujah i like to sing for him amen
[37:50] glory to god amen and i'm gonna tell you
[37:53] i don't need a lot of people i can do
[37:55] this all by myself
[37:56] amen i like to just bring my gift the
[37:59] one that he gave
[38:00] me i like to present that to him
[38:03] hallelujah i want to sing for my king
[38:05] amen glory to god amen
[38:09] amen so it says this says uh as there is
[38:12] uh
[38:12] as there is a king's birth mortals when
[38:15] a king is born
[38:17] the people sing and have jubilee oh
[38:20] my so when a mortal king is born amen
[38:23] the people sing and have a jubilee
[38:25] what about the king of kings we should
[38:27] we should be doing more than having a
[38:29] jubilee
[38:30] glory to god amen amen we should be in
[38:33] heavenly places at this time hallelujah
[38:35] glory to god say he says mortals when
[38:37] the king is born the people sing and
[38:38] have jubilee
[38:39] but there was no king no people to sing
[38:42] at this
[38:43] king's birth but the angels came down
[38:47] and sang to the shepherds and the city
[38:49] of david
[38:50] is born christ the savior
[38:54] and uh and as we were just reading that
[38:57] uh
[38:58] you know they the angels announce to the
[39:00] shepherd and say you know
[39:01] uh um uh there's a there's a
[39:05] a child that's been born in the city of
[39:07] david and uh you know i was i was just
[39:10] kind of looking at something
[39:11] i was looking at the internet i was like
[39:13] you know what is what what is the city
[39:15] of david what do they you know what do
[39:16] they call the city of david
[39:18] and many of them on the internet was
[39:19] saying city of david was
[39:21] jerusalem and uh now we just read in the
[39:24] scripture here
[39:26] out of luke 2 it said the city of david
[39:28] which is called bethlehem
[39:30] right which is called bethlehem so so
[39:32] these these uh
[39:34] shepherds had it right because when an
[39:36] angel announced
[39:37] city of david the the shepherds knew to
[39:40] go to bethlehem hallelujah
[39:43] go to bethlehem and it was purpose for
[39:46] them going to
[39:47] bethlehem because there was scriptures
[39:50] promised that he would be born in
[39:53] bethlehem
[39:54] my god there was one scripture here that
[39:57] we'll just pull up
[39:58] uh out of a micah
[40:04] praise the lord i think it's micah
[40:06] chapter 2
[40:07] micah 5 and verse 2 micah 5 2 this
[40:10] is a scripture amen that promised that
[40:13] he was going to be born in bethlehem so
[40:15] the angels
[40:16] knew exactly where to send those
[40:18] shepherds
[40:19] amen hallelujah it says but thou
[40:23] bethlehem ephrata though thou be little
[40:27] among the thousands of judah
[40:29] yet out of thee shall he come forth unto
[40:32] me that is to be ruling
[40:33] israel whose goings forth have been from
[40:36] from of old
[40:37] from everlasting so here is a promise
[40:40] that
[40:40] christ would be born in bethlehem so
[40:43] those aims i mean the angels told
[40:46] the uh the shepherds you'll find them in
[40:48] the city of david so
[40:49] they say let's go to bethlehem not
[40:51] jerusalem and people today
[40:53] still think bethlehem is jerusalem no no
[40:55] no the bible actually told us that amen
[40:58] uh i'm sorry they think bethlehem is the
[41:00] city of david but
[41:01] i think jerusalem is the city of david
[41:04] but the bible tells us bethlehem
[41:06] was the city of david and the and the
[41:08] and the the
[41:09] the shepherds knew that and and i just
[41:12] say even if they had caught a revelation
[41:15] they knew where to go to find christ the
[41:17] king
[41:18] praise the name of the lord they knew
[41:20] where to go hallelujah now i want to
[41:22] pick up uh
[41:23] just another uh little quote here from
[41:26] the prophet
[41:27] this is out of the message god uh god's
[41:31] wrap
[41:31] gift god's wrap gift and what he's given
[41:34] us
[41:35] in this particular quote what he's
[41:38] sharing with us
[41:39] is and i love just
[41:42] brother branham had a gift to uh
[41:45] make the story real right i mean the way
[41:49] he describes him sometimes you can tell
[41:51] whether he was looking at a vision or
[41:53] what
[41:53] you just didn't know but he had a gift
[41:55] to be able to make the story
[41:57] real make it very real now he's giving
[42:00] us
[42:00] uh he's picking up joseph and mary and
[42:03] as they're
[42:04] leaving because of the issue of taxation
[42:06] and they're going
[42:08] to the city of his birth amen uh
[42:11] brother branham just kind of picking up
[42:12] their journey and he's he's going to
[42:14] just
[42:14] give us some information here about what
[42:16] this was like so hearing the message
[42:18] god's wrap gift
[42:20] it says joseph must have said something
[42:23] like this
[42:24] says mary dear just think just beyond
[42:27] the city on the north side
[42:30] that's where ruth the moabite gleaned
[42:32] yonder
[42:33] in the fields of boaz yonder just beyond
[42:37] that
[42:37] up or up over the mountain yonder is
[42:40] where david with the slingshot took the
[42:42] lion to the ground and pulled the sheep
[42:44] from his mouth
[42:46] must have been there that where joshua
[42:49] stood that
[42:49] stood here with his gleaming sword the
[42:52] fearless warrior
[42:53] of our people and divided the lands and
[42:56] give
[42:56] this inheritance to the tribe of judah
[42:58] to which we are
[42:59] lineage to my see he's identifying
[43:02] himself
[43:03] amen and um uh with this lineage all

[43:12] highway and and um and uh you know as we
[43:16] were driving by

[43:28] as we're driving by here's the name of
[43:31] the city agilent

[43:53] amen when you hear testimonies like that
[43:55] this is what joseph and
[43:57] and mary this is their discussion that
[43:58] they're on the way a man back into the
[44:01] city
[44:02] of bethlehem look at this he says um uh
[44:05] it says we are lineage too

[45:04] rock because she's pregnant in a third
[45:06] trimester
[45:06] right he want to turn and look and and i
[45:09] like the way the prophet said
[45:10] he says uh joseph when he took her off

[45:37] and and and i love it so he made us sit
[45:40] on the rock
[45:41] hallelujah i thought to myself we need
[45:44] to actually
[45:45] sit on the rock amen what is the rock
[45:48] the rock of revelation
[45:50] we need to just sit on the rock don't
[45:54] move don't don't be moved this way or
[45:56] that way
[45:56] just sit on the rock sit on the rock
[46:00] of revelation glory to god amen
[46:03] so as as as they're sitting there the
[46:05] prophet says this
[46:06] he says um uh to see if she was still
[46:09] sitting on the rock
[46:10] and when he turned and seen her pretty
[46:13] face turned towards the skies
[46:15] he didn't have to ask anymore because
[46:17] the reflection of the star
[46:19] was looking back through her eyes he
[46:22] knew
[46:22] she was looking at something i want to i
[46:25] just need to ask you what you're looking
[46:27] at tonight
[46:29] amen he knew mary was looking at
[46:32] something something caught her attention
[46:35] that's why she couldn't respond to
[46:37] joseph i mean
[46:38] i mean she can't hear the conversation
[46:40] but but you know uh as uh
[46:42] as he was talking about their lineage
[46:44] and all the people that
[46:45] they would came to it what this one did
[46:47] and what that one did
[46:48] my it elevated mary mary kind of came
[46:52] i mean she couldn't even think no more
[46:53] about what he was saying because she was
[46:55] looking at something else
[46:57] something else that was getting ready to
[46:59] happen on that night look at it now
[47:01] look at he says uh because the
[47:03] reflection of the star was looking back
[47:05] through her eyes
[47:06] he knew she was looking at something and
[47:09] she looked at him said joseph
[47:11] have you noticed the star hanging yonder
[47:14] and when he looked in
[47:15] in a surprise say i hadn't noticed it
[47:17] before dear
[47:18] well it's been following us ever since
[47:21] the sun went down
[47:23] my god i've watched it it must mean
[47:26] something glory to god because i have
[47:30] the most
[47:30] wonderful feeling glory glory glory
[47:35] amen i have the most wonderful feeling
[47:39] you know god does things like that
[47:41] sometimes for his people
[47:43] shows us the light or some way that we
[47:47] can know that he's near
[47:48] and he's on the scene i remember a
[47:52] sister one time
[47:54] going through a little trial and amen
[47:56] and and uh and as she was going through
[47:58] the trial
[47:59] looked up in the start in the sky and
[48:01] she kind of saw this cloud
[48:03] amen and uh and when she saw the cloud
[48:06] uh it just began to bring an
[48:08] encouragement to her
[48:10] it began to bring a strength to her and
[48:12] she would ask
[48:13] other people do you see that cloud do
[48:15] you see that like no
[48:16] i don't really see it well it wasn't for
[48:18] them they didn't need the encouragement
[48:20] hallelujah to the lamb of god
[48:22] they didn't need them because god was
[48:24] dealing directly with her
[48:26] amen and sometimes god would do that
[48:28] with you somebody was just sharing with
[48:30] me a dream that they had
[48:31] you know recently and and uh in the
[48:34] dream
[48:35] they uh if i recall correctly uh
[48:38] they were they were they would look up
[48:40] in the sky and they said uh
[48:42] the uh the portals of heaven are open
[48:45] and they would tell people say can't you
[48:47] see it they're walking along with people
[48:49] like
[48:49] look up and the portals are having an
[48:51] open and an anointed
[48:53] come down and and they just feel the
[48:55] power of god and just kept telling
[48:56] people
[48:56] the portals of heaven open seemed like
[48:58] nobody recognized it but her
[49:01] hallelujah amen and then finally you
[49:04] know
[49:04] the anointing got so great that she was
[49:06] down on the ground and somebody had to
[49:07] help lift her up and
[49:09] maybe somebody else come along a little
[49:10] she said they say what's going to say
[49:12] can't you see the portals of heaven are
[49:15] open
[49:16] i say i say now it seemed like what god
[49:18] did was give you that dream specifically
[49:20] for yourself
[49:21] i say but since you told it to me
[49:26] since you told it to me i'm gonna claim
[49:29] the porters of heaven are open amen
[49:33] and since the porters are heaven open
[49:35] because he told me
[49:37] he gonna rebuke to the vow for my sake
[49:39] he said he gonna
[49:40] open up the windows the portals of
[49:43] heaven
[49:43] and pour me out a blessing where i have
[49:46] room not enough to receive
[49:47] so since you told it to me i am
[49:50] declaring for myself
[49:52] the portals of heaven are open
[49:57] sometimes god gives you things just for
[49:59] you
[50:00] but once they're shared it's for
[50:01] somebody else
[50:03] hallelujah hallelujah amen glory to god
[50:07] it says uh uh uh he says uh
[50:11] he knew she was looking at something
[50:14] let me see where i'm at um okay
[50:17] you know god does things like that
[50:18] sometimes for his people shows us a life
[50:21] or some way that we can know that he's
[50:23] near and he's on the scene
[50:25] no matter what the world has to say or
[50:27] do he's still there
[50:28] and everything will be all right he just
[50:30] witnesses back by the holy spirit
[50:33] that we can feel it
[50:36] i love that sometimes you need
[50:38] encouragement like that and god will
[50:39] just do it just for you
[50:41] just for you he says and joseph might
[50:44] have said something like this mary
[50:45] you know what i've never been so happy
[50:48] in all my life
[50:50] when i've been drove around by the roman
[50:52] government
[50:53] but yet i have never been so happy as i
[50:55] am right now
[50:57] and i don't know why it seems like
[50:59] there's a sacredness over the little
[51:01] city tonight
[51:02] where we roamed when we were boys and
[51:04] girls back in our teenage and school age
[51:06] it says way into the east and many
[51:10] hundreds of miles
[51:11] away from there the magi was already on
[51:14] their road
[51:15] they'd seen his star and was coming
[51:19] to worship god's little gift package
[51:22] now so the same time mary and joseph
[51:26] are seeing this christmas star amen
[51:29] the magi are also singing and already
[51:33] packed
[51:34] can you get it oh the prophet is saying
[51:36] that they when they saw it they was
[51:38] already packed
[51:39] and coming oh hallelujah
[51:43] amen i'ma tell you when when god show
[51:45] you something you need to get in a hurry
[51:47] about it
[51:48] amen don't don't don't don't
[51:49] procrastinate
[51:52] my god amen procrastination will cause
[51:55] you to miss the rapture
[51:57] right so so don't procrastinate when god
[52:00] shows you something get in action
[52:02] quickly amen they were already packed
[52:05] and and actually i'mma put it this way i
[52:07] preached a sermon some years ago
[52:09] unpacking getting ready to go
[52:12] because most time we pack stuff when we
[52:14] get ready to take a trip
[52:15] we pack this and we packed that and we
[52:18] put this in the suitcase and we put that
[52:20] in
[52:20] but no on this on this trip to glory we
[52:22] need to unpack
[52:24] we need to take some stuff out of our
[52:26] lives amen we need to take some stuff
[52:28] out of our suitcase anything that is
[52:31] weighing you down
[52:32] unpack it and get ready to go
[52:36] glory to god here the prophet goes on to
[52:39] say way into these
[52:40] many hundreds of miles away from there
[52:42] the magi was already on the road they
[52:44] see this star and was coming to worship
[52:46] god's little gift package
[52:48] that he was sending to the world just a
[52:51] little while from there
[52:52] and the world was going to receive his
[52:54] greatest gift
[52:56] that it ever received a little package
[52:58] wrapped up
[53:00] a a little a first little christmas
[53:02] package that was ever wrapped
[53:04] in all the world hallelujah
[53:07] god's god wrapped it up and he said now
[53:11] i want you to notice
[53:12] uh brother branham is preaching this in
[53:14] 1960 and it's on a christmas day
[53:17] it's a christmas day praise the lord and
[53:20] i just love the way he kind of brings
[53:21] all these things in because the
[53:23] you know the world doesn't have the
[53:25] right understanding
[53:26] as to when our lord and savior was born
[53:28] and and that's fine brother brandon made
[53:30] a statement he said
[53:32] um even though it's pagan it's here to
[53:34] stay
[53:35] we're not going to be able to change it
[53:37] it's december 25th
[53:38] but if we can take the opportunity and
[53:41] try
[53:42] to get somebody to see what this was
[53:43] really all about
[53:45] even though they did it all they they
[53:47] started out worshiping the sun god and
[53:49] then they
[53:49] then they tried to bring in the son of
[53:51] god with the sun god worshiped
[53:53] and that's how we got december 25th as
[53:54] jesus birthday it's here to stay
[53:56] pagan took it over but let's try to
[53:59] bring people back to scripture
[54:00] as to what really happened there all
[54:03] right all right
[54:04] man if they if the wise men saw that
[54:07] star that day
[54:08] and we can get people to see the star
[54:09] that we see today lord have mercy
[54:13] oh what a change all right i'm going on
[54:16] in this quote
[54:17] it says um the first little christmas
[54:19] package that was ever wrapped in all the
[54:21] world god
[54:22] wrapped it up i want to break in on my
[54:24] thought and say this the greatest thing
[54:26] ever was wrapped in human flesh uh was
[54:29] was wrapped
[54:30] wrapped in human flesh was wrapped in it
[54:31] god himself
[54:33] wrapped his own self in a christmas
[54:36] package
[54:37] and sent it to the world god himself
[54:41] wrapped their own self in a christmas
[54:43] package can you see
[54:45] amen this big bowl on the package
[54:50] hallelujah and now when you get a
[54:52] christmas gift
[54:53] what you're supposed to do is open it
[54:56] glory to god
[54:57] and god is watching you open his gift
[55:03] god wants to see how you gonna respond
[55:05] in opening his gift
[55:07] will you just open it and push it to the
[55:09] side to go on to the next gift
[55:11] or will you stop and just say forget
[55:13] about everything else this is the most
[55:15] important thing that could ever happen
[55:17] to me is to receive
[55:19] him oh jesus
[55:22] glory to god amen he says uh the
[55:25] greatest that god himself
[55:26] wrapped his own self in a christmas
[55:28] package and sent it to the world
[55:30] why did they refuse it why couldn't they
[55:32] see it
[55:33] why did they turn it down why is they
[55:36] uh why why is it they didn't want it the
[55:39] same reason they don't want it tonight
[55:45] look at what the prophet said it wasn't
[55:46] handed to them
[55:48] in the custom that they were used to
[55:51] gifts
[55:51] being handed if
[55:54] somebody got to tell you what's going to
[55:57] happen at the service
[55:58] before you decide what you're going to
[56:00] do or not
[56:03] you got to hear an announcement no i
[56:06] ain't got to hear no announcement i
[56:07] i without the announcement i knew where
[56:09] i was going to be wednesday night
[56:12] amen i already knew before before
[56:14] wednesday got here i knew where i was
[56:16] going to be
[56:17] amen praise the lord church amen
[56:21] glory to god it it's got to just be
[56:23] automatic in
[56:24] us hallelujah look at this
[56:28] it says the same they say it wasn't
[56:30] handed to them in the custom
[56:31] that they were used to gifts being
[56:33] handed that's the reason they were
[56:35] it's rejected yet tonight it's because
[56:37] it's not handed to the people in the
[56:39] custom
[56:40] that they have been used to receiving
[56:42] gifts
[56:44] and i and i know the holy spirit is not
[56:47] telling me that people are sitting
[56:48] at home streaming and wrapping gifts at
[56:51] the same time
[56:53] i know the holy spirit ain't telling me
[56:55] that's happening
[56:57] put that stuff down and hear the word of
[57:00] god
[57:02] amen
[57:06] streams sometimes become a a hindrance
[57:10] lord god it's sometimes things that are
[57:13] meant for good can actually become a
[57:15] hindrance to us
[57:16] amen amen glory to god
[57:20] all right all right let's go on amen
[57:24] he says uh um because it's uh
[57:28] because it's not handed to the people in
[57:29] the custom that they've been used to
[57:31] receiving gifts but god wrapped his own
[57:33] package
[57:34] he's got a right to do it he's the one
[57:36] that's giving it
[57:37] he has a right to wrap it any way he
[57:39] wants to rap it
[57:41] doesn't make any difference how it is
[57:43] he's got a right to do it because he's
[57:45] the one
[57:46] giving the gift sometimes we get upset
[57:50] with how
[57:50] how the gift looked right well you
[57:54] should have did it this way that
[57:56] ain't you just happy to have a gift
[57:59] praise the lord amen and we get upset
[58:02] with how god
[58:03] choose to do things you know you don't
[58:04] get upset with god
[58:06] praise the lord you know just be i mean
[58:10] god help us help us in this hour just to
[58:12] keep our attention on you
[58:14] all right i want i want to just uh let's
[58:15] see i want to i'm breaking into another
[58:17] uh quote here
[58:19] because what uh brother branham said is
[58:21] that at the same time
[58:23] mary and joseph were looking uh at
[58:27] this star mary said it's been following
[58:30] us ever since the sun went down
[58:32] it says the magi uh miles away
[58:36] miles away they actually saw the same
[58:39] star
[58:40] that mary and joseph stall and uh and
[58:43] they had already when they saw it they
[58:44] just began to make preparation to come
[58:47] lord of god let's pick this up and god's
[58:49] gifts
[58:50] always find their places
[58:55] and i love this it says notice
[58:59] god guide the magi with them gifts
[59:02] for practically two years
[59:06] can you imagine this here this man
[59:09] married and maybe got kids at home and
[59:12] he's telling
[59:12] his wife i'm leaving telling family i'm
[59:14] leaving i'm gonna follow this star that
[59:17] i just saw
[59:19] now you know here's the here's the
[59:21] important thing i mentioned to you
[59:22] earlier
[59:23] with this um this great conjunction of
[59:27] saturn and
[59:28] and jupiter uh crossing paths
[59:32] and becoming like one big star in the
[59:34] sky they call it the christmas star
[59:35] and they were saying they felt that that
[59:37] was something that might have happened
[59:39] back in uh in the time of jesus when
[59:41] jesus came to earth
[59:42] you know and they said you know um we're
[59:44] just not sure because how with the mad
[59:46] job they were asking a question
[59:48] just read it on the internet they were
[59:50] asking how did magi
[59:52] see it because when when the two planets
[59:53] crossed it only
[59:55] it only crossed for a a small amount of
[59:57] time
[59:58] and then it just they separate again
[1:00:01] right and it take
[1:00:02] years before they actually come back
[1:00:03] together again they said next time we'll
[1:00:05] see something like what we just saw
[1:00:07] it'll be 80 years from now it takes
[1:00:10] years for it to happen again
[1:00:11] because they they turn at a different
[1:00:13] speed they rotate at a different speed
[1:00:15] so they're saying uh they said how would
[1:00:18] they say if if they were
[1:00:19] guided by a star if they were guided by
[1:00:23] a star
[1:00:24] it they said maybe it wasn't that this
[1:00:26] this like this conjunction they don't
[1:00:28] they just really it's really hard for
[1:00:29] them to kind of understand how it
[1:00:31] happened
[1:00:32] but the prophet just makes a statement
[1:00:33] here he says
[1:00:35] god got it
[1:00:39] not the star the star and let me just
[1:00:42] put this way
[1:00:43] the star was simply to get their
[1:00:45] attention
[1:00:49] hallelujah and and i want i want to i
[1:00:52] want to bring that
[1:00:53] a little further a little closer to home
[1:00:56] the star
[1:00:57] in the hand of jesus was simply to get
[1:01:00] our attention
[1:01:02] oh hallelujah the star is to
[1:01:05] is to bring us in the into the presence
[1:01:07] of the lord jesus
[1:01:09] glory hallelujah look at i mean he was a
[1:01:12] true eliezer to
[1:01:14] bring us into isaac's presence and once
[1:01:16] we get there
[1:01:17] he leaves off the scene oh hallelujah
[1:01:21] but the star is there to get your
[1:01:22] attention that's what the star is
[1:01:25] so so here you know the prophet said
[1:01:27] notice
[1:01:28] god guided the magi
[1:01:31] with them gifts for practically two
[1:01:34] years
[1:01:34] they followed that star so every once in
[1:01:37] a while they would see it on the journey
[1:01:39] said but for two years they were
[1:01:40] following that stuff see and that
[1:01:42] shows it couldn't be one of the natural
[1:01:45] things
[1:01:46] oh hallelujah the prophet tells us that
[1:01:49] shows it couldn't be one of the natural
[1:01:51] things that happened
[1:01:52] see because if the stars crossing their
[1:01:55] orbits
[1:01:55] would have crossed it would show there
[1:01:58] was something different
[1:01:59] but but because unless those magi saw it
[1:02:02] long
[1:02:03] time before it happened amen and no
[1:02:06] they had to cross that way that might
[1:02:09] not take revelation
[1:02:10] right i mean here the the magi cuz they
[1:02:14] could not now
[1:02:15] i want you to understand a little
[1:02:16] somebody's magi they were actually
[1:02:18] trained by
[1:02:19] daniel when daniel was in babylon
[1:02:22] these guys got their training by daniel
[1:02:24] daniel taught them scriptures
[1:02:26] hallelujah one of the scriptures that
[1:02:29] daniel taught was amen
[1:02:30] numbers 24 and 17. this is when the
[1:02:33] scripture says
[1:02:34] i shall see him but not now
[1:02:38] i shall behold him but not nigh
[1:02:41] there shall come a star glory to god
[1:02:44] there shall come a star out of jacob and
[1:02:47] accepted shall rise out of israel
[1:02:49] and shall smite the corners of moab and
[1:02:51] destroy all the
[1:02:53] children of chef so here they were
[1:02:55] studying scriptures and they knew
[1:02:57] something was supposed to happen in the
[1:02:59] heavens so
[1:03:00] so by by revelation they could actually
[1:03:02] prepare themselves
[1:03:04] and get ready as soon as they saw it
[1:03:05] they were on their way to come see
[1:03:07] christ oh hallelujah church we gotta we
[1:03:10] gotta we gotta be able to catch things
[1:03:12] quickly catch them spiritually and be
[1:03:14] ready to move out soon as
[1:03:16] soon as it occurs i told you there's
[1:03:17] about to be a shift
[1:03:20] they are claiming that there's going to
[1:03:21] be a cultural shift
[1:03:24] i'm claiming it's going to be a heavenly
[1:03:26] shift
[1:03:29] we got to get ourselves ready for what
[1:03:31] god getting ready to do
[1:03:33] we just experienced some of it
[1:03:36] we just experienced pentecostal chicane
[1:03:39] in here
[1:03:40] and you think you think god as a
[1:03:43] like like brother simba prayed on sunday

[1:04:19] ourselves positioned
[1:04:21] to receive what god has for us amen
[1:04:25] amen he already showed us our
[1:04:27] expectations should be
[1:04:28] through the roof through the roof
[1:04:31] everything we know
[1:04:32] god we saw you do it before we know what
[1:04:34] you can do
[1:04:35] come here i mean we ought to we ought to
[1:04:37] come to church early
[1:04:41] we ought to come to church early and be
[1:04:43] praying
[1:04:45] 30 minutes early just sit here praying
[1:04:48] praise the lord getting your get your
[1:04:50] mind amen
[1:04:52] uh in in a spot where god can speak to
[1:04:54] you
[1:04:55] sometimes we come right out of the car
[1:04:57] with all kind of stuff
[1:04:59] and we just need to be able to come here
[1:05:01] and sit and when you when you're coming
[1:05:02] to church early you're not here
[1:05:04] for somebody to talk and you're in the
[1:05:06] start you know oh i forgot to tell you
[1:05:09] you did write that down and then when we
[1:05:12] get outside you can tell me outside but
[1:05:14] don't come here telling me i'm trying to
[1:05:16] get my mind
[1:05:17] positioned to receive something from god
[1:05:21] church this is what we got to do so i
[1:05:22] mean these magi got in a hurry
[1:05:25] look at it that's why they was able to
[1:05:27] that's why they was able to uh uh
[1:05:29] uh uh to you know to to to
[1:05:32] to to to see the lord you know this is
[1:05:34] why they're able to come into spread
[1:05:35] they gotta they got in a hurry to do
[1:05:37] what they needed to do
[1:05:38] look at this look at this
[1:05:42] oh i love this he says uh
[1:05:47] uh and that shows it couldn't be one of
[1:05:49] the natural things that happened see
[1:05:50] because if the stars crossing their
[1:05:52] orbits
[1:05:52] would have crossed it would have showed
[1:05:54] there was something different
[1:05:56] unless those magis magi saw it
[1:05:59] long time before it happened
[1:06:02] and know they had to cross that way see
[1:06:06] in the past they were coming in and they
[1:06:09] crossed just at bethlehem at that time
[1:06:12] started up from there beforehand knowing
[1:06:14] that these heavenly bodies were
[1:06:16] moving that way
[1:06:19] these guys had revelation now god
[1:06:23] got it the magi because they had the
[1:06:26] right gifts
[1:06:29] god guided these wise men because they
[1:06:32] have the right
[1:06:33] identified gift to identify his son
[1:06:37] says oh my do you get it wise men today
[1:06:41] wise in the name of the lord not with
[1:06:44] some fictitious something
[1:06:45] but with the gift that god promised for
[1:06:47] this day
[1:06:48] and god will guide you
[1:06:53] to identify that jesus christ is the
[1:06:57] same
[1:06:57] yesterday the day and forever there you
[1:07:00] are
[1:07:01] wise men now
[1:07:04] you know i uh just want to go back and
[1:07:07] read the scripture
[1:07:08] out of matthew 2. i mentioned that
[1:07:10] earlier
[1:07:12] because this is where we get the wise
[1:07:13] men
[1:07:15] we pick them up in their journey they've
[1:07:18] been traveling for two years
[1:07:19] the other the one of the things that we
[1:07:21] we get clarity from
[1:07:23] in the message is that the wise men did
[1:07:24] not come on the day that jesus was born
[1:07:28] the wise men came two years later so
[1:07:30] when you look at these
[1:07:32] nativity scenes that people have and you
[1:07:34] know they're just
[1:07:35] unscriptural some of the ways that they
[1:07:36] have it the only the only people that
[1:07:38] showed up
[1:07:38] the night that jesus was born were the
[1:07:41] shepherds
[1:07:42] shepherds shepherds and i think that's
[1:07:45] uh that's even special you know
[1:07:47] i'm going to matthew 2 but let me give
[1:07:49] just drop this in real quick about the
[1:07:51] shepherds
[1:07:54] um
[1:07:58] god used shepherds there was a prophet
[1:08:02] that was a shepherd before he was a
[1:08:04] prophet
[1:08:05] and his name was amos and in amos 8
[1:08:08] 9 uh amos prophesied about christ not
[1:08:12] about his birth but about his death
[1:08:15] and in amos 8 9. uh just pull that up
[1:08:18] for me amos 8 9.
[1:08:22] um amos was prophesying he was a
[1:08:24] shepherd that god
[1:08:25] used to prophesy and i i like this
[1:08:28] because
[1:08:29] here god's using the prophet to prophesy
[1:08:31] about uh
[1:08:32] the the death of christ and god uses
[1:08:35] shepherds to also be there
[1:08:36] at the birth of christ it says and it
[1:08:39] should come to pass and that day saith
[1:08:40] the lord that i would cause the sun to
[1:08:42] go down at noon
[1:08:43] and i would darken the earth in a clear
[1:08:45] sky when jesus died on the cross
[1:08:48] some went down at noon right
[1:08:51] here amos prophesied amos being a
[1:08:54] shepherd prophesying about his death
[1:08:57] but when it come time for his birth god
[1:08:59] also uses shepherds
[1:09:01] to identify where he was born
[1:09:04] shepherds shepherds uh all throughout
[1:09:08] history god has used shepherds
[1:09:10] right uh moses was a shepherd
[1:09:13] on the backside of the desert that got
[1:09:15] called from shepherding
[1:09:17] joseph's family they were shepherds and
[1:09:20] joseph didn't want them to say that in
[1:09:21] front of
[1:09:22] pharaoh but they were shepherds david
[1:09:25] himself was
[1:09:26] a shepherd out there watching his
[1:09:28] father's sheep god always used shepherds
[1:09:30] jesus christ is considered the chief
[1:09:33] shepherd
[1:09:34] right amen he's the door to the
[1:09:36] sheepfold and
[1:09:37] i just want you to know that god always
[1:09:40] use
[1:09:41] shepherds shepherds praise god
[1:09:45] here in matthew chapter 2 verse 1.
[1:09:51] now when jesus was born in bethlehem of
[1:09:54] judea
[1:09:55] in the days of herod the king behold
[1:09:58] there was wise men
[1:10:00] from the wise men that there came wise
[1:10:03] men from the east to jerusalem
[1:10:05] saying where is he that is born king of
[1:10:07] the jews
[1:10:08] for we have seen his star in the east
[1:10:11] and are come to worship
[1:10:12] these fellows is on a two-year journey
[1:10:15] when they saw the star
[1:10:17] it was two years ago praise the lord and
[1:10:20] here they are on a two-year journey
[1:10:21] can you imagine that can you imagine
[1:10:24] maybe some of the perils that they went
[1:10:26] through
[1:10:27] and when they finally get to jerusalem
[1:10:30] jerusalem represented
[1:10:32] like the most holy city um probably
[1:10:35] the most spiritual city that that a
[1:10:37] person could come to
[1:10:38] if anybody should have had an answer
[1:10:41] to their question they should have been
[1:10:43] able to find it in jerusalem
[1:10:46] hallelujah but when they get there to
[1:10:48] jerusalem
[1:10:49] amen they ask the question where is he
[1:10:51] that is born king of the jews
[1:10:53] but we have seen a star in the east and
[1:10:55] i come to worship now here's the other
[1:10:56] thing
[1:10:57] how come the others never recognize the
[1:11:00] star
[1:11:02] nobody else martha i mean uh dave uh
[1:11:05] joseph and mary and these wise men
[1:11:08] recognize there was a stuff hallelujah
[1:11:10] i'ma just put it this way if everybody
[1:11:13] in the world
[1:11:14] is recognizing a star something may
[1:11:16] write about it
[1:11:19] glory to god if everybody can see it and
[1:11:24] everybody trying to uh something may
[1:11:25] write about it
[1:11:26] because in the days of jesus only very
[1:11:29] few people
[1:11:30] recognize the star and it's only gonna
[1:11:32] be a few people today that's gonna
[1:11:34] recognize
[1:11:36] a star yeah
[1:11:40] when herod king had heard these things
[1:11:42] he was troubled in all jerusalem with
[1:11:44] him
[1:11:45] and when he had gathered all the chief
[1:11:47] priests and scribes of the people
[1:11:49] together
[1:11:49] he demanded to them where christ should
[1:11:52] be born he demanded i mean herod had no
[1:11:54] idea y'all y'all talking about a star
[1:11:56] uh that brought y'all here and and you
[1:11:59] said king
[1:12:00] a king what king so there's
[1:12:03] harry say i want to know where is christ
[1:12:05] supposed to be born
[1:12:08] verse 5 says and they said unto him in
[1:12:10] bethlehem of judea
[1:12:11] so they went back to micah chapter two
[1:12:14] michael chapter five verse two
[1:12:16] and they knew that was there oh glory to
[1:12:18] god
[1:12:19] now i i want you to i want you to see
[1:12:21] something here
[1:12:24] uh let me just keep reading that thou
[1:12:27] but
[1:12:27] uh he says and they said unto him
[1:12:29] bethlehem of judea for thus it is
[1:12:30] written by the prophet
[1:12:32] uh and thou bethlehem in the land of
[1:12:35] judah are
[1:12:35] not the ark not the least among the
[1:12:38] princes of judah out of thee shall come
[1:12:40] a governor that shall rule my people
[1:12:43] then
[1:12:43] herod when he privily called the wise
[1:12:46] men inquired of them diligently
[1:12:49] what time the star appeared now notice
[1:12:52] they said we have seen his star
[1:12:55] in the east if i recall correctly
[1:12:58] brother branham said
[1:12:59] when they got to jerusalem the star
[1:13:00] wasn't shining anymore
[1:13:02] they was there in jerusalem and the star
[1:13:04] wasn't shining anymore
[1:13:05] but they knew that something that just
[1:13:07] because they had studied
[1:13:09] you know these guys studied the uh the
[1:13:11] stars they knew
[1:13:12] something had happened so as they were
[1:13:14] coming on their journey
[1:13:16] they knew it was gonna cross at
[1:13:17] bethlehem now
[1:13:19] um they go to jerusalem because they
[1:13:22] expect them to have an
[1:13:24] answer in jerusalem but as they see
[1:13:26] nobody really got no answer here nobody
[1:13:28] got nothing to say
[1:13:29] so when when when herod asks you know
[1:13:32] bring out the
[1:13:32] scribes and y'all give me the word of
[1:13:34] god what is promised by the prophets
[1:13:36] where is christ will be born
[1:13:38] when they heard that when they heard
[1:13:40] bethlehem when they heard that
[1:13:42] uh they realized that you know that star
[1:13:45] that kind of uh
[1:13:46] only brought them to you know to to this
[1:13:50] great city jerusalem the star brought
[1:13:52] them there
[1:13:52] but but it was the revelation of the
[1:13:54] word that actually took them to the
[1:13:56] presence of jesus christ
[1:13:58] the star brought them into the vicinity
[1:14:02] let me put it that way the star brought
[1:14:05] them
[1:14:05] into the vicinity but the revealed word
[1:14:09] brought them into the presence
[1:14:14] hallelujah and there's many people today
[1:14:18] glory to god they read the same story
[1:14:21] that we're reading
[1:14:22] glory to god they got many christmas
[1:14:24] sermons going on tonight
[1:14:26] gonna happen tomorrow night and even on
[1:14:28] christmas day and and see
[1:14:30] see the the uh maybe the the the story
[1:14:33] about the star
[1:14:34] actually brings them a man into the
[1:14:36] vicinity
[1:14:38] but it's when the revealed word comes
[1:14:40] that they can actually
[1:14:42] enter into the presence
[1:14:46] glory to god look at this
[1:14:50] look at it now they've brought the
[1:14:53] scriptures out
[1:14:54] and they revealing the words you know
[1:14:56] they're revealing the prophecies
[1:14:57] it says inherit when he had privileged
[1:14:59] called the wise men inquired of them
[1:15:01] diligently what time
[1:15:03] the star appeared appeared what time did
[1:15:07] it
[1:15:07] had it appeared he says and he sent them
[1:15:12] to bethlehem and said go and search
[1:15:14] diligently for the young child
[1:15:17] and we if when you have found him bring
[1:15:19] me word again
[1:15:20] that i may come and worship him also
[1:15:26] when they heard the king look at verse
[1:15:28] nine
[1:15:29] they departed and lo
[1:15:32] so after they get out of jerusalem lo
[1:15:37] the star which they saw in the east now
[1:15:41] after they get out of the presence of
[1:15:43] these
[1:15:44] religious leaders come on somebody and
[1:15:47] can i put it this way after they leave
[1:15:49] their denominational church
[1:15:54] after they can leave some of the things
[1:15:55] of the world now the supernatural can be
[1:15:58] made known to you again
[1:16:00] glory says when they had when they heard
[1:16:03] the king they departed and lo
[1:16:04] the star which they saw in the east went
[1:16:07] before them
[1:16:08] till it came and stood over where the
[1:16:10] young child
[1:16:11] was
[1:16:15] now uh i just found it i told you
[1:16:18] you know it brings you the revealed word
[1:16:20] is what was actually bringing them
[1:16:22] and they were headed to bethlehem when i
[1:16:23] went to israel
[1:16:25] um you know i noticed how close
[1:16:28] jerusalem and bethlehem were
[1:16:31] brother random said you know in order to
[1:16:33] get to bethlehem based on
[1:16:34] on on the way that these brothers were
[1:16:36] traveling they would actually have to
[1:16:38] come through jerusalem
[1:16:40] in order to get to bethlehem based on
[1:16:42] how they was traveling
[1:16:43] they had to come through these this this
[1:16:46] this religious hierarchy they had to
[1:16:49] come through all of that in order to get
[1:16:51] to bethlehem
[1:16:53] oh god i want you to think about all the
[1:16:55] stuff that we had to come through
[1:16:58] in order to get to where we are right
[1:17:00] now
[1:17:02] amen you couldn't bypass it you had to
[1:17:05] come through it
[1:17:07] amen yea though i walk through the
[1:17:10] valley of the shadow of death i will
[1:17:12] fear no evil
[1:17:13] for thou art with me thy rob that staff
[1:17:15] they comfort me
[1:17:17] right but these these these wise men had
[1:17:19] to come through
[1:17:20] all of that in order to get to where
[1:17:22] they need to be we had to come through
[1:17:24] some
[1:17:24] i mean some of us come through catholic
[1:17:27] some come through methodist some come
[1:17:28] through baptism come through
[1:17:30] pentecostal some come through all kinds
[1:17:31] of stuff but we had to go through it in
[1:17:33] order to get to where we are
[1:17:35] right now
[1:17:40] verse nine again when they heard the
[1:17:42] king they departed and lo the star which
[1:17:44] they saw him in the east
[1:17:45] went before them till it came and stood
[1:17:48] over where the young child was
[1:17:50] when they saw the star they rejoiced
[1:17:51] with exceeding great joy
[1:17:54] when they would come into the house
[1:17:55] notice they're not at the manger
[1:17:58] they're not at the manger joseph and
[1:18:00] mary at the house
[1:18:03] praise god now they have no room at the
[1:18:05] end when he was born
[1:18:06] but god doesn't bless joseph
[1:18:11] hallelujah they had the house
[1:18:14] and when they would come into the house
[1:18:17] they saw the young child with mary
[1:18:20] his mother and fell down
[1:18:23] and worshiped him and when they had
[1:18:26] opened their treasures they presented
[1:18:28] unto him gifts
[1:18:30] gold and frankincense
[1:18:34] and myrrh and i want to tell you when
[1:18:36] you get into the presence of god
[1:18:38] present him your gifts
[1:18:41] present them your gifts if you're a
[1:18:42] singer give them your gift
[1:18:44] if you're a musician give them your gift
[1:18:48] amen whatever gift god has given you
[1:18:51] give it back to the lord
[1:18:53] present it to him and worship in
[1:18:56] adoration to him as your
[1:18:58] your savior these these these
[1:19:02] these men have the right gifts this is
[1:19:04] why god protected them
[1:19:06] because they had the right gifts to
[1:19:07] identify who christ really was
[1:19:10] and um brother branham said the goal
[1:19:13] represented his deity as king of kings
[1:19:17] it represented his supremeness
[1:19:19] this two-year-old child represented his
[1:19:22] supremeness
[1:19:23] the frankincense that they gave it
[1:19:25] represented a service offering
[1:19:27] this two-year child they are identifying
[1:19:29] some things about his life
[1:19:31] leviticus 2 and leviticus 16
[1:19:35] we find that the order of the priest the
[1:19:38] order of the priesthood to make an
[1:19:40] offering to jehovah when he made an
[1:19:41] offering had to be made and mixed with
[1:19:43] frankincense for a cent offering
[1:19:45] they took different things and mixed it
[1:19:46] for the meal offering for the wave
[1:19:48] offering frankincense was added
[1:19:50] because it was acceptable to jehovah
[1:19:53] if it was anointed with frankincense
[1:19:55] which means it is a service to jehovah
[1:19:58] that's what the frankincense was and the
[1:20:00] myrrh was an
[1:20:01] anointing for death and brother branham
[1:20:04] said that jesus christ
[1:20:06] was deity in service
[1:20:10] to die
[1:20:14] this great package that god sent to the
[1:20:16] earth this christmas package
[1:20:19] i pray that we just take time to unpack
[1:20:21] it and just really really fellowship
[1:20:23] with it
[1:20:26] love it more than anything else in this
[1:20:27] world but i i can't leave you
[1:20:30] a man at um
[1:20:33] in bethlehem because he's not there
[1:20:35] anymore
[1:20:36] he's not there anymore and it's good
[1:20:38] that the world can go and just stop and
[1:20:40] and just think about the birth of the
[1:20:41] lord jesus
[1:20:42] uh and be forced to maybe even talk
[1:20:45] about it
[1:20:46] right reason people are getting away
[1:20:47] from the merry christmas they
[1:20:49] actually start putting merry xmas all
[1:20:51] the place now you don't see nothing
[1:20:52] you know but uh but uh but it used to be
[1:20:55] a time they had to stop and think about
[1:20:58] the birth of our lord and savior jesus
