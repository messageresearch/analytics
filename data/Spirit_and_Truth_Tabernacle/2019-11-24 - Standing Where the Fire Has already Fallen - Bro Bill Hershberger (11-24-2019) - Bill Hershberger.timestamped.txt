[1:03:07] right to you know the Prophet said that
[1:03:10] a pastor is suspicious he has to be
[1:03:14] suspicious and because he's watching for
[1:03:18] the Sheep he's watching for any sign of
[1:03:19] anything that would come in that would
[1:03:22] you know discourage sorry or interfere
[1:03:26] with the plain of God and so we're we're

[1:04:27] 5 and let's read let's start from verse
[1:04:33] 21 and we'll read down to verse 24 I
[1:04:40] believe it is so st. John 5:21 for as
[1:04:47] the father raises up the dead and
[1:04:50] quickeneth them even so the son
[1:04:53] quickeneth whom he will for the father
[1:04:57] judges no man but has to committed all
[1:05:01] judgment unto the son that all men
[1:05:04] should honor the son even as they honor
[1:05:09] the father he that honoureth not the son
[1:05:13] honors not the father which sent him
[1:05:16] verily verily I say unto you he that
[1:05:21] heareth my word and believeth on him
[1:05:24] that sent me has everlasting life and
[1:05:28] shall not come into condemnation but is
[1:05:31] passed from death unto life hey man what
[1:05:36] a beautiful scripture hey men verily
[1:05:39] verily I say to you he that heareth my
[1:05:41] word and believeth on him that sent me
[1:05:43] has everlasting life and shall not come
[1:05:47] into condemnation but is passed from
[1:05:49] death unto life you may be seated
[1:05:52] this morning lord bless the reading of
[1:05:54] his word I went on I'm gonna read verse
[1:05:56] 24 also out of the Greek diagnose
[1:06:00] it reached like this it says indeed I
[1:06:04] truly say to you he who hears my word
[1:06:07] and believes him who sent me has a own
[1:06:12] ian's life or eternal life and comes not
[1:06:16] into judgment but
[1:06:18] passed out of death into life and I want
[1:06:24] to title it this morning did all of that
[1:06:27] and title and we're standing where the
[1:06:30] fire has already been we are standing
[1:06:34] where the fire has already been and also
[1:06:38] going to read to you one more verse
[1:06:40] second Corinthians 5:21 very familiar
[1:06:43] verse to you for he has made him to be
[1:06:46] sin for us who knew no sin that we might
[1:06:51] be made the righteousness of God in him
[1:06:55] and when I got my thought from this for
[1:06:58] of course I'm st. John 5:24 but Amen if
[1:07:02] you have read any of the history at all
[1:07:06] a little bit and I read very little
[1:07:07] because I'm not really a reader but
[1:07:10] what's the model looking few things up
[1:07:11] and we find out that in in America in
[1:07:18] the early years the the natives had a
[1:07:21] term what they called fireproofing
[1:07:24] fireproofing and it says here each like
[1:07:27] this it says the Native Americans knew
[1:07:30] how to fight fire with fire fires were
[1:07:35] deliberately set near settlements and
[1:07:38] other special areas so that if a fire
[1:07:41] would move through the area and might go
[1:07:44] out when reaching the already burned
[1:07:47] area because there was no fuel so in
[1:07:51] other words as they were traveling you
[1:07:54] know across this land and moving
[1:07:56] westward they had a lot of prairie fires
[1:08:00] and you know they always they always
[1:08:03] traveled from the West that the fires
[1:08:06] usually came from the west back to back
[1:08:09] east and so as they were moving in that
[1:08:12] direction you know when you get out onto
[1:08:15] the plains of the country where it's
[1:08:17] flat lands and you can see from miles
[1:08:19] and miles and miles and and they can
[1:08:21] look out and they could see it
[1:08:24] there was a fire coming because they
[1:08:26] could see the smoke and so as they saw
[1:08:29] the smoke way in the distance and then
[1:08:32] they prepared themselves and what they
[1:08:34] did is he started a fire themselves and
[1:08:37] he started to fire on the other side of
[1:08:40] them from the opposite side of the fire
[1:08:43] that was coming and he led the whole
[1:08:45] area burn however big of an area that
[1:08:47] would burn they just let it burn
[1:08:49] everything that was in its way so after
[1:08:52] it was burned and they would take all of
[1:08:53] their families and all their wagons and
[1:08:57] the horses and whatever they had their
[1:08:59] cattle and never move it all over all of
[1:09:02] it is burnt area that was already burnt
[1:09:04] and then because they knew that when the
[1:09:06] fire that was coming they they believe
[1:09:09] that the fire when it would hit the area
[1:09:11] that was already burned it would die out
[1:09:14] and their families would be safe
[1:09:16] not all appraisal hoarded that wonderful
[1:09:19] and then to know that there is a place
[1:09:21] that we can go maybe there's a way that
[1:09:24] we can fight the fire of judgment that's
[1:09:26] coming and I believe as a believer we
[1:09:29] can look into the distance and we could
[1:09:30] all see that there is a fire there is a
[1:09:33] judgment that's coming we can all see
[1:09:36] that but the only way we can overcome
[1:09:38] the only way that we can be saved from
[1:09:41] that part is coming is to have our old
[1:09:43] fire within us and that fire is called
[1:09:46] the Holy Spirit amen so you must have
[1:09:49] the Holy Spirit listen I still believe
[1:09:52] in the old fashioned Holy Spirit I don't
[1:09:55] believe you can be saved
[1:09:56] outside the Holy Spirit I don't believe
[1:09:59] that theology will save you I don't
[1:10:01] believe that any Cree can save you from
[1:10:04] the judgement that's coming it's going
[1:10:06] to take the fire of the Holy Spirit in
[1:10:08] your life to save you from the judgment
[1:10:11] that's coming hallelujah amen because
[1:10:15] they knew that the fire Amen that would
[1:10:17] come and would hit that spot and they
[1:10:19] will die out because there was no fuel
[1:10:23] there was nothing there for the fire to
[1:10:25] burn to keep it going so I would die out
[1:10:28] oh I trust this moving then you have so
[1:10:31] much of the Holy Spirit in your life
[1:10:32] that when the fire the wrath of fire
[1:10:35] judgment comes would try to come to you
[1:10:38] and would die out because there's no
[1:10:40] fuel there's nothing in you to be
[1:10:43] changed
[1:10:45] hallelujah we're gonna get to a little
[1:10:48] bit amen amen but their state their
[1:10:50] safety wasn't standing where the fire
[1:10:53] already was hallelujah and our safety is
[1:10:58] standing where Jesus amen our safety is
[1:11:03] standing in Jesus Christ amen where the
[1:11:07] judgment already was hallelujah he made
[1:11:12] him to be sin for us so the judgment was
[1:11:15] already in him hallelujah amen notice
[1:11:19] this version he that hears or
[1:11:22] understands not just hears it but
[1:11:25] understands it or receives it many
[1:11:30] people can hear anybody can hear it but
[1:11:35] did you understand what the preacher
[1:11:36] said or did you receive what he said or
[1:11:40] did you just hear and go away I said oh
[1:11:44] that was a good service but the question
[1:11:47] is did you receive what he said he that
[1:11:50] hears or understands and believes that
[1:11:53] him who's him god police on God that
[1:11:58] sent the Holy Ghost in the form of the
[1:12:01] Spirit of Truth to you amen
[1:12:04] notice he is the one that his past is
[1:12:07] past that will be past is passed from
[1:12:12] death unto life
[1:12:14] hey man you believe that not a will pass
[1:12:18] I want you to I want you to focus in
[1:12:21] with me putting on this a man that you
[1:12:23] are already secure in Christ if you are
[1:12:29] born again of the Holy Spirit we're not
[1:12:31] waiting to be secure we are secure
[1:12:34] already we are safe in him hallelujah
[1:12:40] him as a noted he that hears or
[1:12:43] understands it or receives it is already
[1:12:47] passed from death unto life
[1:12:49] hey men you have everlasting life right
[1:12:55] now not when your body is changed not
[1:12:59] when you step in the next dimension but
[1:13:01] you have eternal life
[1:13:03] already if you believe the word if you
[1:13:11] believe what he said amen
[1:13:14] all right hey man you know the Lord
[1:13:18] oh my I feel good this morning hey man
[1:13:22] listen Jesus came to me judged in your
[1:13:26] place it's all right he took the fire
[1:13:31] out the judgment from you so we will not
[1:13:36] come into condemnation or the judgment
[1:13:43] because he was condemned in your place
[1:13:45] you will come to that place is that
[1:13:49] right not coming the judgment I've
[1:13:51] already passed from death on the line
[1:13:53] because we're standing where that fire
[1:13:56] has already been oh we can rest in that
[1:14:01] now let's look at that useful for a
[1:14:03] little bit Cameron Israel you know
[1:14:06] Israel was uh ah you know they had on or
[1:14:13] let's say God had an awful time with
[1:14:17] Israel because there are always
[1:14:21] disbelieving
[1:14:23] they were always getting in trouble they
[1:14:26] were always falling short of the glory
[1:14:30] of God as it was but God always hate
[1:14:33] grace for them and then every time they
[1:14:36] fell into idolatry and sin and all these
[1:14:39] things every time they cried out God was
[1:14:44] always there and made sound probation
[1:14:47] for them
[1:14:48] oh listen brothers and sisters he will
[1:14:51] do the same for you today every time you
[1:14:54] cry out and that he has a provision for
[1:14:57] you and he's waiting for you to cry out
[1:15:00] to him because you're gonna make
[1:15:02] mistakes
[1:15:03] you gotta fall short but don't stay down
[1:15:06] there amen Israel him as they were
[1:15:16] traveling I mean it fell in the sea and
[1:15:19] once again amen and God sent the fiery
[1:15:22] serpents amongst them amen and the
[1:15:25] service was biting them and and Israel
[1:15:30] was dying because of the serpent end but
[1:15:33] they cried out having it cried out -
[1:15:37] what don't you cry to Moses and Moses
[1:15:41] cried to God and God said here's what
[1:15:45] you must do you must make a fiery
[1:15:48] Serpent and it's something that God took
[1:15:52] the service that was biting them and
[1:15:55] told Moses to make something similar to
[1:15:58] what was killing them and they put up on
[1:16:01] a pole anyone ever come out and look up
[1:16:06] on them they could be deliverer
[1:16:09] but they had to look upon that serpent
[1:16:12] with spiritual revelation because I'm
[1:16:16] sure there was some that looked at it
[1:16:19] didn't live you had to look at it
[1:16:23] understanding that that serpent was
[1:16:25] there in the form of a serpent showing
[1:16:28] that sin was already judged yeah let me
[1:16:33] read my brother Branham says all right
[1:16:35] you still believe for the RAM don't you
[1:16:36] the devil don't like it don't eat my
[1:16:39] voice already it's that cold air blowing
[1:16:42] on my army my brother will make it we
[1:16:44] will overcome I'm used to this but I
[1:16:50] also know that God always somehow it
[1:16:53] works out yeah brother Troy I don't want
[1:16:57] the people to be all sweaty and okay
[1:17:01] amen praise the Lord so he says he says
[1:17:09] when the true believer come out there
[1:17:11] and looked upon the serpent was the
[1:17:13] spiritual revealed truth that suddenly
[1:17:16] self being it was in the form of his
[1:17:19] serpent it represents sin already judged
[1:17:22] they seen sin their unbelief already
[1:17:27] under judgment as they looked on it was
[1:17:32] already under judgment from the serpent
[1:17:35] from the Garden of Eden and the sermon
[1:17:39] was made out of brass he said which
[1:17:42] shows divine judgment divine judgment
[1:17:46] soon Israel came out they looked they
[1:17:49] looked at that serpent amen and it
[1:17:53] reminded them because you remember back
[1:17:55] in the Garden of Eden amen when God
[1:17:58] cursed the serpent because remember the
[1:18:01] serpent was not a snake
[1:18:06] the sermon was not a snake
[1:18:10] amen we know him as a snake because
[1:18:19] that's all we've never seen him in but
[1:18:22] when Eve met him he was not a snake
[1:18:25] he was an upright creature that could
[1:18:28] walk around and could talk to them and
[1:18:31] could reason with them
[1:18:32] he had reasoning power but when God
[1:18:36] cursed him he took his legs off and
[1:18:40] that's why he could only crawl on the
[1:18:44] ground hold on that's why science can't
[1:18:49] find him that's why they don't know what
[1:18:52] a missing link yes amen because there's
[1:18:55] nothing in him that resembles what he
[1:18:57] wants a member lenzi changed every bone
[1:19:01] name a complete different form came in
[1:19:06] to hide from the world what it really
[1:19:09] was
[1:19:09] but to the believer we know what it is
[1:19:12] we recognized that sermon and let me say
[1:19:16] that the bride of Jesus Christ today
[1:19:18] still recognizes that serpent and had
[1:19:22] the church world might not recognize
[1:19:24] that deceiving spirit but you recognize
[1:19:27] that serpent hey man
[1:19:31] oh my that's why they call them snakes
[1:19:35] in the grass because that was the slime
[1:19:39] yes slickest thing you see and those
[1:19:43] priests reminded him of a snake
[1:19:47] yeah and I believe it was spiritual high
[1:19:50] side today can recognize that there is
[1:19:53] that serpent now don't look at your
[1:19:56] brothers and sisters and call him a
[1:19:57] serpent no that despair a bad thing
[1:20:02] comes in people hey man and the bride of
[1:20:06] Jesus Christ has been given a spiritual
[1:20:09] discernment I mean to recognize that
[1:20:13] serpent even though God is here from the
[1:20:16] touch world they don't recognize him but
[1:20:19] you recognize him you know what the
[1:20:22] market of beasts is oh yes mama noise
[1:20:28] might sound funny but it's gonna sound
[1:20:30] horrible into any ears of the devil but
[1:20:33] your believer no sound just fine listen
[1:20:38] you have been given a spiritual insight
[1:20:42] into the Word of God and you recognize
[1:20:45] who that devil is oh my and we recognize
[1:20:50] and that's what is looking look upon him
[1:20:53] with spiritual revelation and know that
[1:20:56] that snake on that under on that Paul
[1:21:00] represents that spirit that came from
[1:21:03] the Garden of Eden nobody else could
[1:21:09] recognize that and then and then nobody
[1:21:12] could recognize that Egypt couldn't
[1:21:14] recognize it but is worker recognizing
[1:21:17] by spiritual revelation they said that's
[1:21:20] the devil that's that spirit that has
[1:21:23] been charged
[1:21:26] from my seat hallelujah thank you
[1:21:31] brother that's the one he's hanging out
[1:21:34] but he's made of brass which is divine
[1:21:38] judgment and taking a look on that
[1:21:42] serpent and they're gonna look at but it
[1:21:43] was revelation and they can live when we
[1:21:49] see Jesus on the cross hey man we can
[1:21:53] look about sin already judged oh and you
[1:22:00] are free I wonder when you look on Jesus
[1:22:06] this morning
[1:22:06] what do you see do you see you were
[1:22:10] coming into the Christmas season and
[1:22:13] most people only see is the baby in a
[1:22:17] manger k-member let me tell you when the
[1:22:22] wise men came he wasn't a baby he was a
[1:22:24] child that's right they killed the
[1:22:28] babies from two years old and under he
[1:22:32] was a little time little tiny baby but
[1:22:35] the world knows him as the baby in a
[1:22:38] manger but you know him as your Savior
[1:22:42] the one that was hanging on the cross
[1:22:45] and when I look about him
[1:22:48] I see sin already judged Oh then of the
[1:22:57] sins are already judged brothers and
[1:22:59] sisters what are you worried about if
[1:23:02] your Shin has already been judged what
[1:23:04] are you worried about hallelujah
[1:23:10] Paul said this some men sins are open
[1:23:15] beforehand going before due to judgment
[1:23:19] some men they follow after listen I
[1:23:26] don't want my sins to follow me here
[1:23:31] I don't want my sins follow me how would
[1:23:34] I confess it before the Lord I'm a my
[1:23:37] confession to be in the Lord Jesus then
[1:23:40] my sins go before me oh I can send my
[1:23:49] sins to the judgment so I don't have to
[1:23:52] go you can send your sense attachment so
[1:23:55] you don't have to go hey I would think
[1:24:04] your Christian should feel this good but
[1:24:08] listen if there's anybody on the field
[1:24:11] but it's us because your sins are gone
[1:24:16] you ask me why I'm happy I'll tell you
[1:24:19] why because my sins are gone that's what
[1:24:28] I'm happy that's why we feel good that's

[1:29:58] Church and just haven't found out yet
[1:30:01] hey man and God's chosen place of
[1:30:03] worship 1965 he says he's actually
[1:30:07] praying he says their God one by one we
[1:30:09] are called one by one we have to meet
[1:30:12] the challenge to walk down through the
[1:30:13] valley of the shadow of death and it's
[1:30:16] due to every one of us as mortals but
[1:30:18] tonight you have offered us your
[1:30:20] petition that if we wouldn't believe on
[1:30:23] him and be baptized in his name that you
[1:30:26] would take us in listen I want to say
[1:30:29] say that's God's promise to you
[1:30:32] it does anybody here that's not been
[1:30:34] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:30:37] that's God's promise to you and you take
[1:30:41] his name in Baptism and you've repented
[1:30:43] and then he will take you in I didn't
[1:30:47] promise you that he did he says and then
[1:30:50] in this body not not spirit and truth
[1:30:54] Tabernacle but in this body of Christ
[1:30:57] see the body of Christ not in the church
[1:31:00] but in the body of Christ that body has
[1:31:02] already been judged come it will not
[1:31:08] have become the judgment God poured out
[1:31:10] his wrath upon that body and that body
[1:31:13] is free from sin and being in him it
[1:31:17] puts us free from sin by His atonement
[1:31:21] that died for us in Christ in the body
[1:31:28] Paul said by one spirit we're all
[1:31:30] baptized into one body so right don't
[1:31:34] matter what you aren't you checked our
[1:31:36] Greek whatever you are everything about
[1:31:39] one spirit we're all baptized into that
[1:31:41] one bodies that right and brother
[1:31:43] branham's that and dad we have
[1:31:45] fellowship with one another while the
[1:31:47] blood of Jesus Christ God's Son keeps us
[1:31:50] clean from all sin and defilement
[1:31:54] hey man I'm gonna read that last part
[1:31:56] again because I think we overlooked a
[1:31:58] lot of times in there where in the body
[1:32:02] of Christ we have fellowship one with
[1:32:04] another while the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:32:08] God's Son keeps us clean keeps us clean
[1:32:15] listen it's not just one day you say I
[1:32:19] repent of all my sins that only takes
[1:32:23] care of your past sin
[1:32:25] that's what Brad said that takes care of
[1:32:28] your past sin he said it had nothing to
[1:32:30] do with your future that's why I believe
[1:32:34] he says here
[1:32:37] godson keeps us Lee
[1:32:40] he just keeps cleaning you all as you
[1:32:43] recognize your mistakes and recognize
[1:32:45] your shortcomings and confess them to
[1:32:47] him he keeps cleaning you that's why I
[1:32:50] believe there's a sacrifices in the
[1:32:52] table there that's on the altar listen
[1:32:59] brother man said if there's no altar in
[1:33:01] heaven your prayers cannot even be heard
[1:33:06] so I believe there's a sacrifice but it
[1:33:08] doesn't alter there no yeah I believe
[1:33:12] he's there I believes there this morning
[1:33:13] for you and I honey but when you accept
[1:33:17] him and are baptized in his name and he
[1:33:20] accepts your repentance you're already
[1:33:22] forgiven already challenged is that
[1:33:26] right it's we're in him hey man then
[1:33:30] we're free from the scenes I want to
[1:33:34] reach something else here you know you
[1:33:38] know you know the beautiful thing about
[1:33:40] being in him he already died he was
[1:33:47] already buried and he already
[1:33:49] resurrected and already ascended into
[1:33:52] heaven so if you're in him where are you
[1:34:02] and why are you worried about going why
[1:34:06] are you worried about it am I going to
[1:34:07] make it if you're in him he already made
[1:34:11] it so in his mind you already made it

[1:34:28] mind you're there because in his mind it
[1:34:32] was finished from the foundation of the
[1:34:34] world

[1:34:39] fall around and get discouraged Oh God
[1:34:41] can I make that oh god of my Christian
[1:34:43] got him outside my daughter of God it
[1:34:47] was already settled in his mind from the
[1:34:48] foundation of the world that you own are

[1:35:10] when he come to the tabernacle you know
[1:35:13] and one day you know what the property
[1:35:16] god says one day the light just struck
[1:35:19] and he was at the time when I go and he

[1:35:23] good clothes good suit but he says he
[1:35:27] couldn't wait he our gold to the water

[1:35:34] him him in and so and so from then on
[1:35:37] the oh they they followed me

[1:36:00] to go do you think I'm safe three
[1:36:03] questions how am I welcome a measured in
[1:36:06] a secrecy how many are old and weak but
[1:36:08] I want to ask you but I said do you
[1:36:12] think you're ready to die do you think
[1:36:14] I'm ready to go do you think I'm safe he
[1:36:17] says now I say in this case I'm going to
[1:36:19] give it a soul examination your doctor
[1:36:23] can only examine your body they have no
[1:36:26] instrument they can examine your soul he
[1:36:30] said but I'm gonna give you a soul
[1:36:32] examination see he says in God for the
[1:36:35] soul only has one instrument that's
[1:36:38] right and that's his word that's his
[1:36:42] word jesus said in Saint John 5:24 he
[1:36:44] hears my word he says that here doesn't
[1:36:47] mean just to listen that annoys but that
[1:36:50] here means to receive it who can receive
[1:36:54] my word Amen he hears it you know don't
[1:36:57] just stand still and call of nonsense he
[1:36:59] says he says then think there's nothing
[1:37:01] to it he says I don't believe that he
[1:37:04] said he that hears my word then that's
[1:37:07] the word of Jesus which he is the word
[1:37:10] is there you are he says now you can
[1:37:12] hear my word he said unbelievable him
[1:37:15] that sent me
[1:37:15] he has passed from death unto life and
[1:37:19] shall not come even come to the
[1:37:21] judgement but has already passed from it
[1:37:25] amen
[1:37:26] I said how's your heart beating now
[1:37:29] toward the bill now how's your heart
[1:37:32] beating now he said I believe it I heard
[1:37:36] it I received your memory and asks me
[1:37:40] question now answer three times and I
[1:37:43] believe it I heard that I receive it you
[1:37:46] know we we sometimes even in this
[1:37:48] message we make salvation so complicated
[1:37:51] but it's so simple God is still simple I
[1:37:56] don't care amen
[1:37:57] how many seals opened up and I'm not
[1:37:59] making lies the seals
[1:38:00] I believe in your William the seals but
[1:38:02] salvation is still simple and you don't
[1:38:07] have to understand my certain revelation
[1:38:10] to have salvation
[1:38:12] [Applause]
[1:38:14] Amen I said then according to the head
[1:38:17] specialist the chief operator the chief
[1:38:22] doctor of eternal life says you have
[1:38:26] passed from death unto life and shall
[1:38:29] never come to condemnation you can't be
[1:38:32] judged if you've already passed into
[1:38:36] eternal life you've accepted the remedy
[1:38:39] he imagined what a peace that was to an
[1:38:42] old man that knew his days were probably
[1:38:47] pretty few you know whether you like it
[1:38:52] or not as you get older it becomes
[1:38:57] obvious they dependent your days here in
[1:39:00] front of you are less than the days are
[1:39:05] there behind you hallelujah and what a
[1:39:09] peace
[1:39:11] what a comfort to know that you have
[1:39:15] taken God's remedy you've done it
[1:39:18] according to the doctors book you follow
[1:39:22] his instructions
[1:39:24] hallelujah and if you have followed his
[1:39:26] instructions you will receive the same
[1:39:28] results amen amen
[1:39:33] and then Paul said in Romans 8:1 there's
[1:39:36] therefore now no condemnation no condom
[1:39:40] let's say no condemnation no
[1:39:43] condemnation to them that are in the
[1:39:46] church
[1:39:49] I do have classes owned they still work
[1:39:56] do that much are in Christ because you
[1:40:00] can be in the church and be full of
[1:40:02] condemnation but if you are truly in
[1:40:06] Christ there is therefore now no
[1:40:08] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[1:40:12] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[1:40:14] after the spirit hallelujah you know
[1:40:19] people it's it's so strange to me people
[1:40:23] people say ho if you're so condemned now
[1:40:27] I just feel so you know well have you
[1:40:31] been walking you're walking up to the
[1:40:35] flesh or after the spirit if you're
[1:40:38] walking up to the flesh don't blame God
[1:40:41] you don't want to did it you're the one
[1:40:44] that walked in that place you don't want
[1:40:46] to walk through the flesh and if you
[1:40:48] walk in the flesh there will be kind of
[1:40:50] nation but if you walk in the spirit
[1:40:52] there's no condemnation but thank God
[1:40:56] for conviction there's a difference
[1:41:00] between conviction and condemnation
[1:41:02] conviction makes you repent of what
[1:41:05] you've done and you've done something
[1:41:08] wrong it'll make you replenish that
[1:41:09] right but you got to do it according to
[1:41:12] the doctors book you can't just sweep it
[1:41:15] under the rug and say all everything's
[1:41:17] fine no you've got to come clean your
[1:41:20] confession has to me in Jesus Christ
[1:41:23] amen everything everything be done
[1:41:26] according to the book amen then you can
[1:41:30] say let the death angel pass
[1:41:34] God's right safe it lands it's alright
[1:41:38] but only you're in Christ hallelujah you
[1:41:43] confess your sins then you can sing that
[1:41:46] let implants like that Death Angel pass
[1:41:49] Oh
[1:41:50] listen let me just show you a little bit
[1:41:53] something here listen it may ask the
[1:41:55] life moves through the stalk of corn
[1:41:59] wheat whatever it might be okay hey man
[1:42:02] so life moves through I want you to
[1:42:04] notice as it went from Luther that
[1:42:06] Wesley to Pentecost
[1:42:08] amen to Malachi 4 it was picking up all
[1:42:11] the life that was back here and brought
[1:42:14] it up with it it's not right so we have
[1:42:17] justification we have sanctification we
[1:42:19] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost but
[1:42:21] we have the revealed Word I want you
[1:42:25] notice one thing that once that life has
[1:42:28] passed from the shock into the seed or
[1:42:30] even from a men do run from losing the
[1:42:34] Wesley it never goes backwards our face
[1:42:40] is set came in for one thing and God's
[1:42:44] fate is set for one thing move forward
[1:42:46] we're looking straight amen
[1:42:51] straight to our goal and the life of
[1:42:54] Luther moved to Wesleyan alive but once
[1:42:56] they moved to Pentecost the life of
[1:42:58] Pentecost moved all up into the bride
[1:43:01] now where's the bride gonna go we're not
[1:43:05] going back to Luther we're not going
[1:43:07] back to white slim we're not going back
[1:43:09] to 1906 Pentecost but we're going into
[1:43:12] the garner hallelujah we can't go back
[1:43:17] oh that's why I don't understand how
[1:43:22] could we and we really believe this
[1:43:24] message how can we go back to
[1:43:26] denomination you can't go back to the
[1:43:30] nomination if you
[1:43:31] back to the nomination you left the
[1:43:33] message hello because this message will
[1:43:37] never go back to two denomination
[1:43:39] because it never came from the
[1:43:41] nomination no that's why God had to take
[1:43:46] a little unlearning man a man out of a
[1:43:49] system and ungodly system at that a man
[1:43:53] didn't know anything really about Christ
[1:43:56] and then his parents was brutal Eggers
[1:43:58] had to bring him out of that what to
[1:44:01] bring us a message outside of the
[1:44:03] nomination and that's why we cannot go
[1:44:06] back into the nomination that's why when
[1:44:09] somebody tells you you've got to see it
[1:44:11] my way or you're lost you just tell them
[1:44:13] goodbye because that's a lie you don't
[1:44:18] have to see it the way that I see it or
[1:44:20] or the way they see it you gotta hear my
[1:44:22] special revelation no I don't this is
[1:44:25] the revelation I gotta hear it's right
[1:44:27] in the Bible hallelujah hey man we're
[1:44:32] not falling man we're not pulling the
[1:44:34] nomination and then the day of falling a
[1:44:36] man is over we're not even well but
[1:44:44] brother Troy is your hill-hill hill-hill
[1:44:46] relate a jack we're not even falling for
[1:44:49] the brain um
[1:44:53] for the bill it was feeling good so now
[1:44:56] you got left me I'm filing with a
[1:44:59] Branham I want you to know Paul said
[1:45:01] follow me to follow Christ
[1:45:04] yes I know that and you know what do
[1:45:07] exactly what he said follow me as I
[1:45:10] follow Christ
[1:45:11] in other words follow Christ because for
[1:45:14] the brand are always pointed to Christ
[1:45:18] show me one place that he ever pointed
[1:45:21] to himself but he pointed to Jesus
[1:45:25] Christ
[1:45:25] and when you find a ministry or find a
[1:45:28] man that always points to themself
[1:45:30] there's something wrong every minister
[1:45:34] every ministry every 5 Foley you know
[1:45:37] whatever the gift is all to be pointing
[1:45:40] people to Jesus Christ if I point you to
[1:45:43] myself I'm pointing you to the wrong
[1:45:46] place because I will fail you but he
[1:45:50] will never fail you hey I'm gonna one
[1:45:57] brother one time he said the song we
[1:45:59] sing he never failed me yet never failed
[1:46:02] me yet he says I refuse to sing it that
[1:46:05] way I says why is that because when you
[1:46:06] say he never failed me yet it's like you
[1:46:08] expecting him to fail hey I'm just gonna
[1:46:13] see never failed me he never failed me
[1:46:17] no yet behind it not like I'm expecting
[1:46:19] one day he might fail me no he will
[1:46:23] never fail me so I might have been
[1:46:28] simple but I was pretty good never
[1:46:31] failed me yet and you know maybe
[1:46:32] tomorrow he'll fail me know he didn't
[1:46:36] feel me today he won't fail me tomorrow
[1:46:37] he won't offend me the next day he's
[1:46:40] still Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:46:41] today forever
[1:46:44] hallelujah and I think as message
[1:46:46] believers it would behoove us amen to
[1:46:48] look back into the Bible say what does
[1:46:49] the Bible actually teach because that's
[1:46:52] what brother Branham used amen
[1:46:56] I probably better clarify what I said
[1:46:58] when up find with a brand is I hope
[1:47:00] people you mean in this thing for 30
[1:47:06] years and nothing J I'm not fine brother
[1:47:08] man that sounds like the people have
[1:47:09] walked away from the message no this
[1:47:13] message is all we got there's no other
[1:47:16] message to follow listen you know Israel
[1:47:24] follow Moses is that right do you know
[1:47:28] that today Israel is still following his
[1:47:30] message my day follow Moses Moses died
[1:47:38] you know some people get offended when
[1:47:40] you talk like that I was at a place
[1:47:45] where he did he got offended because he
[1:47:48] thought I went to follow that way that
[1:47:49] we're getting away from the messenger
[1:47:51] but God was not afraid to use those same
[1:47:54] terms we talked to Joshua the first
[1:47:56] thing he said was Moses my servant is
[1:47:59] what dad now we know what a believer
[1:48:04] don't die but he had to say it that way
[1:48:08] so they'd understand he's not here the
[1:48:12] body is gone he buried the body in
[1:48:15] Jefferson Hill
[1:48:18] okay everybody gonna savor the rest of
[1:48:23] the service laughs hey man there's no
[1:48:26] message that will come to perfect you
[1:48:29] outside the message of William bland but
[1:48:34] we're following the message not the man
[1:48:36] because even the man made mistakes oh I
[1:48:41] know there's people trying to tell you
[1:48:42] he didn't make no mistakes
[1:48:43] but that is a mistake well glory to God
[1:48:50] that is a mistake ever make a mistake
[1:48:55] then I would agree with them he is God
[1:49:00] right because the only person that never
[1:49:03] made a mistake was God so I take that
[1:49:08] way that yes he's God if he never made a
[1:49:10] mistake but I can point you to place
[1:49:12] after place after place after place
[1:49:13] where he himself said I make so many
[1:49:16] mistakes now I got one question for you
[1:49:21] is that dust saith the Lord
[1:49:22] [Music]
[1:49:25] you see what happens he just run into a
[1:49:27] dead end you strap yourself every words
[1:49:31] that say the Lord well what about when
[1:49:34] he preached things differently before
[1:49:36] the seals and then different afterwards
[1:49:37] well what's the first part of the second
[1:49:39] part does say his Lord he can't all be
[1:49:41] just his Lord oh thank god the Bible
[1:49:48] says Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:49:49] today and forever he'll still work the
[1:49:52] same in these people and he wants a
[1:49:55] living people
[1:49:58] amen amen
[1:50:02] oh I'm having a good time
[1:50:06] pray so hard I hope it helps you I hope
[1:50:12] it helps you
[1:50:13] we're not here to deceive you we're not
[1:50:14] here to to try to get you away from the
[1:50:16] message no sir
[1:50:18] this message and I have all I have the
[1:50:21] highest respect for William Ray
[1:50:24] hey I'll gladly put him in the place
[1:50:28] where God put him in the others of a
[1:50:30] true prophet of God and uncompromising
[1:50:34] prophet of God that would not compromise
[1:50:36] on a part of the word I will give him
[1:50:39] all that honor I respect him at all that
[1:50:43] manner but I will not fall down to
[1:50:46] worship him no sir because he himself
[1:50:50] said when he went to Rome and he had the
[1:50:53] opportunity to meet the Pope and bow
[1:50:55] down he said no sir all worship belongs
[1:50:59] to God
[1:51:00] hey man let the church say Amen
[1:51:05] Holly I will not bow to him to worship
[1:51:08] Him and furthermore he wouldn't want me
[1:51:10] to that's why he dead see yo that's
[1:51:13] another just a simple little clue that
[1:51:15] lets know that Jesus was God because
[1:51:18] when Jesus was on earth and the people
[1:51:20] fell down before him to worship Him he
[1:51:23] never stopped him he never stopped him
[1:51:27] oh my you know what that tells me one
[1:51:31] thing then is that the Angley in
[1:51:33] Revelation 19 and 20 or 20 21 wherever
[1:51:35] it is somewhere in there that when the
[1:51:36] angel fell down before John fell down
[1:51:38] before the angel he says don't do it
[1:51:41] that was not Jesus then he couldn't have
[1:51:44] been changes because Jesus receives all
[1:51:46] the worship
[1:51:48] but when John fell down he says don't
[1:51:50] you do it don't do it I'm having I am of
[1:51:53] your fellow servants the prophets and
[1:51:58] you can argue with the Bible all you
[1:51:59] want but that's what it says him and
[1:52:01] that was not Jesus that was showing
[1:52:03] those things oh I know that stumbles a
[1:52:06] lot of people at home you mean there's a
[1:52:08] prophet or there's some some it ain't
[1:52:11] jellybean deck the shoulders thanks to
[1:52:12] John I don't know just go ask John at
[1:52:15] home the Bible just says but he fell
[1:52:18] down before the angel he would not
[1:52:19] receive the worship and Jesus on earth
[1:52:21] in a mortal body we're not receiving I
[1:52:26] think Matt would receive it would
[1:52:30] receive their worship so he is God
[1:52:32] that's why brother Branham would never
[1:52:34] receive worship when they tried to
[1:52:37] worship Him he went off the field he
[1:52:39] said that makes me an antichrist then
[1:52:45] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:52:47] and forever then if their worship him
[1:52:49] today it would still make him an
[1:52:51] antichrist hallelujah amen
[1:52:58] praise the Lord I hope I made it clear
[1:53:02] enough listen if I was on it while I was
[1:53:08] alive the first four years of my life I
[1:53:14] was four years old my mother and went
[1:53:16] off the scene so I was obviously too
[1:53:19] young to know anything but if I had been
[1:53:21] alive and old enough and would have
[1:53:24] known what I know now you know you know
[1:53:29] sometimes we we look at people so how
[1:53:32] could this be how could those people do
[1:53:34] that to him how could they worship him
[1:53:36] how could you do all these things but
[1:53:38] you know what if you were back there and
[1:53:40] you saw all those things and I say that
[1:53:43] because of my wife's grandmother's
[1:53:44] testimony that that knew two dolls a new
[1:53:47] brother branham very well and you know
[1:53:49] she said one day she said you know she
[1:53:51] says I understand why people thought he
[1:53:56] was Christ
[1:53:57] he said because they saw so much
[1:53:59] supernatural so much of God that they
[1:54:03] got it confused yeah well yeah we're
[1:54:07] real quick why those people had no rebel
[1:54:10] and they really didn't but we want to
[1:54:12] condemn them but you weren't back there
[1:54:16] but there was some there even then that
[1:54:19] knew better it's not right and I believe
[1:54:22] if I would have been there and you would
[1:54:24] have been there we could talk about them
[1:54:25] all we want but I think we would have
[1:54:27] done all we could have do follow the
[1:54:30] means we would have become a follower of
[1:54:35] William Branham in that hour because we
[1:54:39] saw so much of God we wanted to be there
[1:54:42] whatever God was doing me we wanted to
[1:54:44] be there that's why God had to take him
[1:54:48] from the scene that's why God had to
[1:54:51] take him for two reasons because of that
[1:54:54] and also because his message was
[1:54:56] finished hallelujah
[1:55:00] people are just waiting for him to come
[1:55:02] back and tell us what to do here what he
[1:55:03] did I say this morning if he wants to
[1:55:07] come back he wouldn't tell you nothing
[1:55:09] different where you already told you
[1:55:11] [Applause]
[1:55:14] because if he did he would break his own
[1:55:17] word he would break the word that Paul
[1:55:20] said positive I come see Paul knew did
[1:55:25] the revelation that he had given that
[1:55:27] even Paul couldn't change it later
[1:55:29] so if brother Branham wants to come back
[1:55:31] he wouldn't change nothing he tell you
[1:55:34] exactly what he already told you because
[1:55:35] you just preached out of the world
[1:55:39] hallelujah hey man if I cut that all
[1:55:44] skewed up you just go to Jack and say
[1:55:47] don't have that guy back I'll leave that
[1:55:51] and let him clean up the rest welcome
[1:55:55] home jack no a men you know pastors work
[1:56:00] he's never finished you can go to job
[1:56:03] and go home and rest sleep at night or
[1:56:06] whatever but he's always on call maybe
[1:56:10] the only time he's gonna cruise and
[1:56:13] there's no Sun and there's there's no
[1:56:15] phone service might be the only time he
[1:56:16] has any relief I'll let you touch the
[1:56:18] phone off and woe unto him Oh
[1:56:23] if he turns the phone and all but I have
[1:56:25] a need you know this is this age this
[1:56:29] this agent we're in it and we have no
[1:56:31] patience whatsoever
[1:56:32] I wondered how some believers today how
[1:56:34] would you have function 40 years ago 30
[1:56:37] years ago how would you have made it
[1:56:40] when there was no cell phone when you
[1:56:43] add the weight do you got the tailor he
[1:56:45] got home to make a phone call and then
[1:56:47] you call the house of the pastor and
[1:56:49] maybe he's on a trip and you don't have
[1:56:50] a phone but you know what the church
[1:56:58] survived
[1:56:59] the church was did just fine without it
[1:57:02] the pastor's probably had it easier amen
[1:57:09] but we are everything's right now we
[1:57:12] went to McDonald's drive-through and we
[1:57:14] want everything everything is just
[1:57:15] push-button drive-through fast food all
[1:57:17] that you know everything we want now we
[1:57:18] want God to answers now on the pastor
[1:57:21] better answer the phone now if he
[1:57:22] doesn't answer maybe he doesn't like me
[1:57:28] patience where's patience why has it
[1:57:32] gone
[1:57:34] hallelujah hey man I better go on you
[1:57:41] can have a few more minutes
[1:57:47] [Music]
[1:57:52] praise the Lord and then he says sin
[1:57:56] looking unto Jesus he's thought about it
[1:58:00] every time that something major was
[1:58:02] happened there was in preparation he
[1:58:03] said John made a preparation for the
[1:58:06] escape and then he said so it's the Holy
[1:58:08] Ghost today for running the coming of
[1:58:11] Jesus Christ it's Megan a construction
[1:58:15] the body of Jesus Christ of the Holy
[1:58:18] Spirit but for running the coming of
[1:58:22] Jesus no we don't believe in two
[1:58:25] different cheeses are now you know but
[1:58:28] some we we say well the Lord has already
[1:58:30] come yes he has come and the
[1:58:33] manifestation of his word but blood Ram
[1:58:35] was still looking for it's coming in
[1:58:38] 1965 and this is in 1964 the seals open
[1:58:43] when all supposedly happened right and
[1:58:45] then in 1964 yes so is the Holy Ghost a
[1:58:48] for running the coming of Jesus
[1:58:53] listen I still believe that one day I'm
[1:58:55] gonna meet him I'm gonna meet the person
[1:59:00] Jesus Christ he's here today that's true
[1:59:03] he's here and his spirit in his bride a
[1:59:06] man manifesting who you are but one day
[1:59:09] we're gonna go see him the one that died
[1:59:12] for us
[1:59:13] oh I want to see him look upon his face
[1:59:17] hallelujah he's making a construction
[1:59:20] the body of Jesus Christ we are baptized
[1:59:22] into it not by creating up by the
[1:59:24] nomination or a handshake but by the
[1:59:25] Spirit of God we are baptized into the
[1:59:27] body of Jesus Christ into the body of
[1:59:32] Jesus Christ
[1:59:33] he's an a construction that will stand
[1:59:36] the judgments because it's already been
[1:59:40] challenged when I see the blood I'll
[1:59:42] pass over you maybe so God has a place
[1:59:46] that has been fireproofed now you're
[1:59:49] with me a place that has been fireproof
[1:59:52] a place that the judgment has already
[1:59:54] burned all the trash all over your land
[1:59:58] hallelujah it's called the Holy Ghost
[2:00:01] hey man it's all ready and listen if the
[2:00:04] Holy Spirit is in you now he goes on he
[2:00:06] says and Christ the mystery I'm gonna
[2:00:08] try to hurry through this is we stand
[2:00:09] justified in Christ before him because
[2:00:11] he cannot past just report he's already
[2:00:13] judged that body in which I am a part of
[2:00:17] he says what how am i a part of it here
[2:00:21] it is if you abide in me and my words
[2:00:23] about you asked what you will I'm a part
[2:00:26] of him hallelujah another place he says
[2:00:29] he says it don't have to be judged he
[2:00:33] said
[2:00:34] the church already is is it don't have
[2:00:37] to be judged it's already been judged
[2:00:39] for a judge Christ and Christ is
[2:00:41] judgement when we when we are in him we
[2:00:44] are free from judgment hallelujah if God
[2:00:49] touches you then he's unjust he says
[2:00:51] what a statement
[2:00:53] Christ ago a judgment for us and by one
[2:00:57] spirit we are baptized into the body he
[2:00:59] that believes in Me has everlasting life
[2:01:00] but should I come to judgment st. John
[2:01:02] for his calling and the sixth seal he
[2:01:04] says cause see she has not one sin not a
[2:01:07] thing against her the grace of God has
[2:01:09] covered her over and the bleach has took
[2:01:12] every sin so far away there is not even
[2:01:15] ever a remembrance of it not a thing but
[2:01:19] purity perfect in the presence of God
[2:01:23] hallelujah hey Makenna miracle more back
[2:01:29] the word in there and you can go home
[2:01:30] and digest
[2:01:31] hallelujah just once more 1963 says he
[2:01:35] promised me that I would be there and he
[2:01:38] has already given me eternal life
[2:01:40] hey because he said he that can receive
[2:01:42] my words and believe on him that sent me
[2:01:43] has eternal life and shall not come to
[2:01:45] the judgment but it's passed from death
[2:01:46] unto life that's good enough for me is
[2:01:50] it good enough for you
[2:01:51] that's good enough for me hallelujah
[2:01:55] right there that's my absolute that's my
[2:01:57] absolute he promised it there is no way
[2:02:01] for it to ever fail and never failed me
[2:02:05] yet
[2:02:09] no never failed me notice that why
[2:02:12] you're in that body you are just as free
[2:02:14] from condemnation as he is let me ask
[2:02:17] you something how free do you think
[2:02:19] Christ is from condemnation do you think
[2:02:22] he has any condemnation at all then you
[2:02:25] shouldn't either if you are in him
[2:02:28] you're just as free from condemnation as
[2:02:30] he is you'll never have to stand any
[2:02:33] judgment God costs judgment to be struck
[2:02:35] upon his body and if you're in him God
[2:02:38] cannot judge you he's already judged you
[2:02:41] when he judged crying
[2:02:43] and you can't be out of judgment no more
[2:02:45] Christ took it when you're baptized into
[2:02:48] the body of Christ you're free from
[2:02:50] God's judgment the wrath of God will
[2:02:53] pass over you hallelujah
[2:02:58] I'm so glad aren't you hey men
[2:03:02] hallelujah Paul says in 1st Corinthians
[2:03:05] 3 he says every man's work shall be made

[2:03:09] because it shall be revealed by fire you
[2:03:13] see when the judgments of God come it
[2:03:15] will prove what you have but you notice
[2:03:17] we men if you really are sealed away by

[2:03:31] it now is that right we can see that
[2:03:33] judgments coming honey but she won't be
[2:03:37] here when it's totally unleashed upon

[2:03:43] sealed in by the Holy Ghost you got the
[2:03:45] Holy Ghost fire in your soul and the
[2:03:49] wrath cannot touch that's all
[2:03:52] hallelujah and then father says because

[2:04:29] man so listen as we get ready to close
[2:04:32] when Satan tries to bring condemnation
[2:04:35] on you you tell him I'm standing where
[2:04:40] the fire has already been
[2:04:43] I'm standing where the fire has already
[2:04:45] been judgment has already passed from me

[2:04:53] were trained in Christ Jesus and I mean
[2:04:55] in Christ Jesus you have to tell him
[2:04:57] that hallelujah hey man just one more
[2:05:02] here conferences 1960 Jesus was brought
[2:05:11] himself to a decision let's stand
[2:05:13] together as we get really close and
[2:05:15] before going to Calvary the father
[2:05:18] brought its own son into conference in
[2:05:21] Gethsemane while angels taken their
[2:05:25] positions to see what the decision would
[2:05:28] be oh he said it might not have been
[2:05:31] this way but let's think maybe it was I
[2:05:35] could hear him say son do you desire to
[2:05:40] go on to Calvary there's a band waiting
[2:05:44] for you that's persecution there's theft
[2:05:48] and murder laying in the way there's
[2:05:52] exposure of your own body they'll strip
[2:05:55] the clothes off of you they'll beat you
[2:05:57] into pulp they'll pull a crown of thorns
[2:05:59] over your head and you'll die screaming
[2:06:02] for mercy should you go on think about
[2:06:07] it what a time that must have been any
[2:06:10] what your eternal destination was
[2:06:12] hanging on his decision should you go on
[2:06:18] he says look at the decision sometimes
[2:06:23] when we stay in our seats and the Holy
[2:06:25] Spirit says you must do this or you must
[2:06:27] do that you got someone you won't speak
[2:06:30] to you won't speak to them you won't
[2:06:33] make it right you're just ashamed to go
[2:06:35] up and say if you're on the wrong or
[2:06:38] what if you're not in the wrong to go up
[2:06:40] and say brother let's forget it and talk
[2:06:42] it over
[2:06:43] he brought it right from the decision
[2:06:45] that Jesus made had to make the decision
[2:06:48] you have to make somebody in this
[2:06:51] assembly that you won't speak to
[2:06:54] you got to make a decision this morning
[2:06:57] we know what the Father's will is no
[2:07:01] when you do it or will you not do it hey
[2:07:05] man he says brother let's forget it and
[2:07:08] talk it over Jesus when he looked up
[2:07:11] into the face of the Father oh and this
[2:07:15] is what you gotta say it's not my will
[2:07:19] it's yours to be done he says what a
[2:07:24] decision think about it this morning why
[2:07:28] he would have made the wrong decision we
[2:07:31] wouldn't be here today you wouldn't be
[2:07:34] looking at me I wouldn't be looking at
[2:07:35] you but rest assured he could not make
[2:07:39] the wrong decision because there was God
[2:07:42] in the flesh
[2:07:42] any man and that was the very purpose he
[2:07:46] came was to make that decision to say I
[2:07:48] will but not a question this morning is
[2:07:52] what will you do
