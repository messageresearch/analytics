And uh one of the families I was told got in their car and drove uh from Tucson, Arizona to be here tonight. Somebody mean business with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't make you don't make bribes like that just for pleasure, but you want to get something from the Lord. You know, um when brother Brandon was on the earth, there were many people that made drives like that to get into services and and God would always uh honor the people's faith. And I believe Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. And we would put our amens in like that, then I believe God moves on the scene. Amen. just for us. We thank God for um Pastor Caleb Duron being here. Amen. It's It's been a little bit uh that uh he's been with us and um and I know uh his his better half uh it's been over 14 years I think for her. 16. Sister Ann, so good to have you back in in West Palm Beach. And uh uh LA 16, so he said 16 years ago, but I know uh 14 years ago something happened uh in their life. And uh we hadn't seen Sister Anne uh since, but they've come back, Amen. with a a package. Praise the Lord. Their precious daughter, Sister Naen. God bless you. Good to have you with us. Amen.

And brother Caleb will be uh ministering at uh their church, Bride of Christ Tabernacle, on uh Sunday night. Amen. Sunday night, the the service starts at 6:00 p.m. Uh and I know that you'll be blessed if you're able to come and be a part of that. Amen. Praise the Lord. Um, some of you all we prayed on on uh Wednesday night. Uh, I was telling you about a uncle of mine that that needed a miracle. Uh, but on last night, the Lord called him home. And uh, we are uh certainly um grateful for the life that my uncle lived. Amen. He was a a a minister here in the area, Baptist minister for um 40 years or so. And uh but he was at 85 years old. His his birthday was coming up October 3rd, I believe. He would have been 86. But um the Lord saw fit to call him home. It was to me um very ironic. Um, when I tell you what happened to him, it's almost like that happened to somebody, but it happened to him. Um, my uncle was at Walmart with his wife and they were um getting her eyes checked there in the in the eyeglass area. And um and then, you know, he um he he saw a sign said, "No eating or drinking in this area." So he decided to get up and take his chips and um and go and and eat the chips uh in another area. And he got over there eating the chips and start choking on a chip. And um they did the Heimlick maneuver on him and and um I you know and they had to call the paramedics and um he had a heart attack through all of that and the Lord called him home. Uh it was very ironic, you know, for something like that to happen, but all I can say is that, you know, it was it was God's time uh for for Uncle Henry. So, we ask that you just continue to keep the family in prayers. You all are aware we have another funeral on tomorrow uh with another relative and then next weekend, I believe, uh we'll have to deal with this. But God is still good uh all the time and all the time. God is good. So, thank you for your prayers. Thank you for the text messages and everything. We just appreciate Amen. you reaching out to us uh during this time. But, Amen. God is in control. So, I just don't think it was um accident, amen, that God orchestrated this weekend to happen at this time. Amen. And God already foresaw all of that, right? And uh so I was glad that, you know, we had a preacher for the weekend and uh and and and I'm glad, amen, that brother Caleb is with us again. Amen. So let us uh stand to our feet and prepare to welcome uh Brother Caleb Duron uh to the pull pit. Amen. on tonight. How sweet the sound that save [Music] like me. Oh, I want [Music] to see [Applause] [Music] Oh 10,000 right [Music] the sun [Music] will Let's stay [Music] away. Somebody say praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Hallelujah. [Music] Oh, hallelujah. Praise God. Oh, praise God. [Music] Let's give the Lord a hand of praise and worship. We can do better than that. Come on. Hallelujah. To God be all the glory and praise. The devil tries to stop you, but God says it's going to happen anyway. The devil tries to slow you down, but God said, "Don't worry. We're going to go on with it. Spirit of God, we're going to keep on moving. Can we say amen? Somebody say amen. Amen. God bless you. Would you all just play uh Amazing Grace slowly and quietly while I uh just greet you all tonight? God bless you. Glad I to see a whole brand new team except for you on the platform. So, God bless you. It's good to be back at Spirit and Truth Tabernacle. It's been a while and but I can't really talk about it because it's been laundered for other people. So, uh it's good to have you with Would you all be seated just for one second? I'll introduce you all. Sister Birds, is that you? How you doing, sis? God bless you. I was trying to see all I I Where did she go now? She was back there a second ago at the computer. Oh, she Oh, I don't want to do that. But when I saw her, she I came in. She She let me give her a big old hug. I said, "Old friends. Old friends." We was talking on the way over here. Where's Mima? Mima, we love you. We was talking about that time we went to um July 4th. and and sister ca she she Mima found these two wonderful chairs that I'm going to tell the story now that somebody had thrown away and she said look at you all laughing and she said uh let's go to the beach I'm going to show y'all uh fireworks over the water we're excited so she said brother would you carry the would you be a gentleman I said sure so I carried them all the way how far do we walk about a mile or so seemed like that with these two foldable collapsible chairs. And we get there and I straighten them out and I go to sit in one and down I go. And I don't know if it was her or Sister Bird, but somebody said, "Save the preacher. Save the preacher." I looked at her and she goes, "I guess I should have just left them where there." I said, "You do that." She said, "I won't be doing that no more." I said, "Okay." And I got them. I put it in the trash can. I went to take a picture. And she goes, "Why are you doing I said, "I want to remember where I buried these things cuz that's where they belong." But that was a good story. Like we wouldn't have had those chairs. It would have just been fireworks. But you know that what's what fun is that without the preacher going down. Sister Anne never sat in her chair. She just kind of looked at me. What are you doing? Nothing. Falling. God bless you. It's good to be back. I want to just introduce a few people here if you don't mind. our head deacon, brother Jeff and his wife are here with us today. So, God bless you. Amen. There you are. All right. And then one of our translators and his wife, Brother Joe and Sister Edmonita right there. You raise your hands right there. All right. And then we have our youth pastor and his They're the ones who drove. Would you all stand up? Come on, sit up. They're the ones who drove. Yeah. God bless you. God bless you. I think I'm going to we're talking we're in negotiations uh to drive to Alabama next month because I don't you know plane tickets and all that. So we'll see how that goes. Um we'll see how that goes. And then we have the assistant to the pastor which means that I call him for just about everything. Brother Alzer and his wife and sister-in-law and sister Sophie came with. Would you all stand right quick just so they can see who you are and then greet you? All right. They know brother Jeff. They should. Anyway, I think some of them have changed, but most of them are the same. And then our assistant pastor, Brother Jesse, and his wife, sister Dawson, would you would you raise your hand or stand if you want to? Yeah, go ahead. No, stand up. We got to make them more redder than they are. It's all right. God bless you. Thank you. I I took one look at them. I said, "Well, you can tell they've been to the beach. The rest of us just got color. They got color, too. You ever heard that joke where that guy said color and they said who you calling color? White people turn green when they're sick, gray when they're scared, purple when they're when they're dying, red when they're hot. So anyway, we'll settle that. And then uh and then uh of course you saw Sister Anne and Naen. Did Naen stand up and get embarrassed yet? Oh, Naen, please stand up and get embarrassed. They have to do it. Come. Hey, get up. All right. didn't last long. All right. And then last but not the least, our sister Deborah Mariah is with us tonight. Now, this young lady is 28 years old. And just as a testimony, she died after having a seizure in my home. She stays with my wife and I. And the Lord allowed me to call her name twice and she came back to life and she's been with us ever since. So, I mean, back stronger. So, would you just stand up? Let everybody see what a dead person walking looks like. [Music] [Applause] Ah, we all got stories. &gt;&gt; We had a journey on the way over here. Uh, we were supposed to be here yesterday, but I won't talk about something that took place on Wednesday night, but I won't publicly mention it. But I'll tell you what, the devil tries everything, &gt;&gt; but God is in control. So what do you I wish the devil would get a revelation &gt;&gt; and find out that he does not have a chance &gt;&gt; to stop the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; There's no opportunity there. There's nothing that's going to say, "Okay, this is going to work." Right? Can he stop you? I'm talking to you. Can he stop you? No. Can he stop you? No. Your your drum did something funny. I saw a little plastic. What was that about? But he didn't stop you from playing, did he? All right. That's what I'm getting at. When you're sold out to what you're supposed to be doing, &gt;&gt; God ain't going to stop. I mean, the devil ain't going to stop you. God's going to keep you going. Amen. God will not allow him to stop you. &gt;&gt; So, we have a phrase in our church that we take it from the greatest battle ever fought. And something Brother Brandham says a couple of times, but mainly once. He said it real strong. He said, "Don't you stop for nothing." &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. So, God bless you. Well, it looks like I'm preaching to my church right here. So, this is weird. You've heard this before, but you better say amen. I don't want I I walked in. The first thing I said to brother Alli was, "What are you doing on the back row?" We don't sit in the back row in church. He goes, "I knew you were going to say something." Man. All right. Well, God bless you and welcome back to the house of God. Try not to keep you too long if the Lord is willing. Uh would you stand now for the reading of the word and we'll start to move into Thank you, musicians. Appreciate you. All right. Matthew chapter 20. I'm going to start off with uh let me see here. We'll just read the first verse and then I I'll expound on it here as we go along. Is that all right? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. All right. Now, do we have translators here? Do I have to go slow or is it just English? Do we just Okay. Well, sometimes it's we have Creole translators and French, you know, all that. So, I want to make sure. We're looking forward to coming on Sunday night. God bless you. Thank you for being here, by the way. Oh, so sorry, brother Jack. &gt;&gt; No, see the reflexes are still there. See? Praise the Lord. All right. Uh, and it says like this, for the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labors into his vineyard. And then let's read verse two. And when he had agreed with the laborers for such a penny, he sent them into his vineyard. And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace, doing nothing. And he said unto them, "Go ye also into the vineyard, and who whatsoever is right, I will give you." And they went their way. Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour and did likewise. Now, here's where I want to be today at the sixth verse. And it says this. And about the 11th hour, he went out and found others standing idle and saith unto them, saith unto them, why stand here idle? Amen. Father, we ask you to bless the reading of your word. Bless the message that'll go forth and whatever it is that you want to say. Lord, I pray that you relay it to the people clearly and may they receive it as a revelation in Jesus Christ's name. For there is no other name greater. Amen. And amen. God bless. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; I can tell I'm going to get hot, so I'm just going to take this off. That's all right with you. &gt;&gt; Somebody say amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Well, that feels better. &gt;&gt; It's a nice place. I told brother Jack, "It's you're going to be here for a minute." And he goes, "I like that. For a minute." I said, "Yes, for a minute." God has a place for Spirit and Truth Tabernacle. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is not the end of the road. And we sit there and we think to ourselves, well, it didn't happen like this. It didn't happen like But God knows how it's supposed to happen &gt;&gt; and when it's going to happen. He has the place ready. And it's it's u it's sweet because I told Brother Jack, "Did you see that one building on the way over here?" I said, "That's where I always thought I you all should be." And he goes, "What building is that?" And I said, "Well, we was driving." He goes, "Well, show it to me later. We'll see what happened." So, well, I saw it. I like it. I don't know what the Lord's going to do with it, but it just got a beautiful setting on a big piece of land. I said, "That's what we need to have here." And I say we because we're all in it together. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. I was telling him that we're planning on making an addition and and uh if the Lord is willing, oh, we'll talk dates tonight. Maybe we sit down and talk. But I've invited Brother Jack to come back out in December. and uh also a brother from Alabama and he's already agreed. We'll just have to see how it works out but hopefully brother not you brother Shelly. Yeah. He looked at me like I didn't agree to nothing. You agreed to come depending on the date. All right. So we'll settle it. He looked at me like uhuh. Caught you quick, man. I'm watching you, brother Jack. You know what a good a definition of a friend is? Has anybody ever heard that? Somebody Give me a second. Who has not who you have not seen for a while, right? Can you hear me? &gt;&gt; But when you see them, you pick up right where you left off. &gt;&gt; There's no awkwardness or uncomfortable feeling, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You're not looking at each other all suspicious. &gt;&gt; You're just happy to see each other. &gt;&gt; And when I saw Brother Jack, I gave him a big long strong warm hug. I said, "Brother Jackie, it's good to see." You know how brother Jackie, he walked up like, "Hey, brother Caleb." I was I hugged him. over here. He had to hug me back. Would you give me that hand? Come on. Now, what we've noticed at the church, and I want most of you, I want everybody to take this, but young people, I want you to pay attention to this. If I could ask you a question, if you don't want anybody to know, I guess you could not raise your hand if you don't want to, or I can ask the adults to lower their eyes for a second, but I don't think it's nothing to be ashamed of. I want to ask you young people, all people, but mostly young, have you ever felt like you have nothing to do in the church? And I'm not talking about musicians, and I'm not talking about uh running the sound, but like what part of the body are you fitting into? &gt;&gt; Have has any of you young people felt the way? Can I see your hands go up? Yeah. Okay, good. Thank you. All right. And some of ours here, and you're sitting there, you're wondering like, how how does this message how does it relate to me? I never saw Brother Brandham. Any hands? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. Okay. I never knew brother Brandham. I I don't know how this is supposed to work for me. Like, how do I fit into this? &gt;&gt; Uh, by the way, Brother Jack, I don't know if you knew. Did you all hear that brother Bisco passed away? &gt;&gt; You know, as far as I know, and if if memory serves me right, he is the last remaining true witness to walking with brother Brown. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to think about it. Brother Billy Paul's gone. Brother Green is gone. Brother Muse is gone. Brother Collins is gone. Brother Lee Bell's been gone. There's a there's quite a few of them. Brother Coen, uh, uh, Coleman is gone. Brother Hunt is gone. There's quite a few. Brother Wesco, a lot of them that knew him and they're all that walked, not just knew who he was, not just came in when he was there or here, but are gone. The ones that walked by him, talked with him, fished with him, and so forth. Brother Holland Hickerson, he's gone. So all these different ones, I think I think Brother was the last one that walked with him. &gt;&gt; All right. not knew him, not sat in his meeting, I said walked with him. &gt;&gt; And to me, that's a significance. You know, can you imagine if you would uh whenever um the last disciple that walked with Jesus passed away, &gt;&gt; right? Now, Judas, he was the first to go, &gt;&gt; right? And can you imagine how it was? Well, I guess it might have it probably would have been John, maybe, right? He was the youngest. But when he went away, someone had to turn around and say, "That's the last one." &gt;&gt; Wow. that walked with them, talked with them, saw all the things that did. That's the last one. What are we going to do? Well, we write down what they wrote down. We write down what they said and we pass on and we keep on going. We don't stop for nothing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. But I think there's significance to him passing away. &gt;&gt; And it caused me when I found out I was somebody text me told me and then I said there there's something to that. That's the last one now. &gt;&gt; And and I'm asking the Lord. I'm trying to do research kind of thinking, but I do believe it. And I'm not talking about brother Joseph Brenham. It wasn't he was very young. Not the same thing. So this is different. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; And I'm wondering what do we say now there there there's there's got to be uh we could it was never about the witnesses. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; It was never about those men who saw who fished and all these stories. Those are great stories. But we couldn't we we leaned on brother Brandham's coattail long enough. Come on. &gt;&gt; We leaned on Brother Green's coattail long enough &gt;&gt; and all those other witnesses. Now, what are we supposed to do? &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what we do. We have to walk where none of them have ever walked before. &gt;&gt; G. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Brother Green has never walked in a rapture. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Brother Green has never had a body change. &gt;&gt; Brother Biscll has never experienced what it is to live in this last day. Now, he lived it, but now we're here. We're not He's on his way. We're on our way walking. We are going. They never walk from death unto life and keep on walking. &gt;&gt; They're taking a nap. But we are the people who are going to keep on walking, never see death, never close their eyes, never be buried, never died, walk from this place to the next place. &gt;&gt; We are doing what nobody else has ever done before. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, what about brother? What about brother?" Even he had to rest for a while. &gt;&gt; There's a purpose behind it. &gt;&gt; You see, we can't keep walking depending on people that have gone by. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; We can't. As long as we got that brother, as long as we got this brother, well, those brothers are gone. Now, it depends on you. The burden is on your shoulders now. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You've got to carry the cross. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You've got to show the young people how to get there. &gt;&gt; Amen. You've got to become as a young person, say, "Lord, what must I do and get over to the other side?" &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so for you that I'm asking, uh, have you ever been there? Have you ever thought this? Well, believe it or not, uh, when I started a church in Tucson, I got to thinking the same way. For the longest time, I wouldn't, and you just forgive me. I'm going to just be honest with you so you understand. I hope we I hope you're not going to stand up there and lie to us, brother Caleb. I don't like it when people say to be honest. Oh, were you lying before? Thanks for the clar thanks for the clarification. I didn't realize you were a liar before. All right. Um, y'all not gonna say that no more, huh? You're gonna lie, brother Jack. If they do, you just turn around and say, "Were you lying before?" When I started Amazing Grace, I I I didn't call our We didn't call ourselves a message church. We still don't. Watch me carefully. We call ourselves a Christian church. If I'm asked, are you denomination? You fellowship? You what are you? Denomination, non-denomination. We're non-denominational. We are a Christian church that follows the message of Malachi 4. &gt;&gt; Well, aren't you a message church? No, I'm not. &gt;&gt; Well, how do you how can you tell the difference? There is a difference. If you watch and look closely, &gt;&gt; we might quote him and we will quote him and we say what he says, but we're not leaving the quote on the page. [Music] &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; A message church typically leaves the quote on the page, &gt;&gt; just like the Baptists have left God's word on the page, &gt;&gt; just like the Catholics have left it on their own Bible someplace. Just like the Mormons have made up their own Bible, just like the the the theologians of old, they leave the doctrines. They turn them into some theology, some kind of a heavyduty thought process, some kind of a doctrine, and they leave it on the page. &gt;&gt; Their life is not a life change. Their life is something mimicked. is but is ran and governed by rules of dos and don'ts. But there's never nothing on the inside that changes them from glory to glory to glory glory glory glory glory all the way through till the end. There's nothing that brings them from one thing to the other thing. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Truth. &gt;&gt; So if it's all right with you and I'm not excluding you, brother Jack. I think we're on the same page. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But that's how I answer the question. And the reason why I say that is because I'm not here to be another message church. I want to be a church that follows the message. Let the message jump off the page and clothe me in the in the wedding in the bride's uh uh gown and get me ready for a body change. Take me to a wedding supper. Take me to a rapture and get me off this place that I don't belong anymore. &gt;&gt; Can somebody say amen? &gt;&gt; And for a while we we didn't have no friends in Tucson. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; We got quiet. What happened to all the amens? Right. &gt;&gt; That's all right. in Tucson. We didn't have no, right, brother Jeff? Ain't nobody want to fellowship with us. &gt;&gt; Then you know what we started doing? We started having non-denominational brothers come. &gt;&gt; We had a brother from Hawaii and brother Nelson. He came and he had long black hair and and uh uh we don't think nothing of it. But when people caught wind of it, they said, "Look what he's doing. He's not even a message believer anymore." Right? &gt;&gt; We had this big old uh Jamaican brother. What's that brother's name? Bailey. Reverend Bailey. Big old Jamaican brother. He got up there. He knew just how to. You could tell he was trained, man. Cuz he knew how to get us fired up. &gt;&gt; But he was a brother nonetheless. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; And I had somebody say, "Well, why are you having these guys?" And said, "Cuz nobody in Tucson wants to come preach for me." &gt;&gt; Well, why is that? I said, "Because they wanted to draw me out of the circle." &gt;&gt; Because I didn't do what they do. &gt;&gt; Because I don't tear my kids up when they dress this way or dress that way or if they misbehave. Look, that's all part of it. But I want them to change from the inside &gt;&gt; out. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And I'm glad we got all that training because the kids we got in there now. &gt;&gt; We got nose rings, ear rings, nasal rings, bull rings, long hair, short hair. And I'm looking at them like, but they're still God's children. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to tell you what, they're saying amen louder than the believer that's been in this 40 plus years. &gt;&gt; They're on fire more than the person that's been on there 40 plus years. I told brother Jack the other day, I said, "You know what? Understand?" I said, "They're saying amen in the quotes." &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; And then I said, "I have yet." Have you brothers been asked at all who brother Brandham is? &gt;&gt; I have yet to We have yet to be asked who is this brother Brandham y'all keep talking about. &gt;&gt; Who is the seven seventh angel? Who are the other six? Nothing. They're not asking us what are you reading? What what's seven seal book? When I told them it was open and different things happened here, here, all they're doing is looking for tears coming down their eyes. They're crying and they're shouting, "That's right, brother. Amen, brother." And I'm going, "There's no way they know what I'm talking about." But Jesus said, "What about the 11th hour worker?" &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; We've been looking for it, hadn't we? &gt;&gt; We thought we were. And I'm going to tell you, if you if you've been in this long a long time, and if you've been in this message a long time and you haven't yet understood, but suddenly, oops, things are starting to go I can't do either one. Things are starting to snap. Get into get into uh Hey, that makes sense now. Hey, I'm getting it now. All of a sudden, I'm getting it. Uh uh uh. We got a revelation of who Caleb was. &gt;&gt; You want to hear this one? You got a few minutes? &gt;&gt; Do you know that Caleb was Jesus's grandfather? &gt;&gt; Did you know that? &gt;&gt; Come on. I can show you if you go in the first book of Matthew, it talks about a man named Salman or Selma and he was married to Rahab and Rahab and he are the are the ones who uh founded the city of Bethlehem. Well, who's Selma? That's Caleb's greatgrandson or grandson. Caleb had a son and then that son had a son and that guy married Rahab. And on down the line, here comes Jesus. We sat there and I looked at this thing and I said, "How in the world?" I had some scholars argue with me, some message, you know, dignitaries that say, "Well, no, Rahab married Joshua." I said, "Why would that 14year-old girl marry that hundred-year-old man?" Well, brother Brennham said, uh, she's married to a general, a mighty general. I said, "Do you think Joshua was the only mighty general in Israel?" &gt;&gt; Joshua would have been Israel at this time. He's not fighting anymore. He's got other mighty generals underneath him. I said, "But if you look at the lineage and if you look if you want to Google it, it's there, too." &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; So, the Gentile line has fallen all the way through. Now, you say, "What does that have to do with anything?" Well, because if God was gracious enough to show us where the Gentile bride actually began &gt;&gt; in a city of Bethlehem, then it makes a whole lot more sense why the son of God had to be born in the same city that was founded by these people. &gt;&gt; All right? He thought so much of you that he had his only begotten he had the groom born where the bride was born. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Get a little heavy, huh? And we got so excited. I had I think it was sister uh Wilson back there. She turned around. She said, "We have been reading the Bible for years. We all have. Why are we just now seeing this?" &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So, we've been in this message how many years and we are just now seeing this. All right. &gt;&gt; Because there is a time and a place for revelation to take part. &gt;&gt; God, I got quotes to what brother said. God said, "Hold this back. Hold this back. Don't do this, and don't do that until this, this, this, and this happens." &gt;&gt; But you see, if now we're starting to see it, then this, this, this, and this must have began or happened already. &gt;&gt; G. &gt;&gt; It's getting touching. It ain't no touch. It's like hit and miss. No, it's touch and go now. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; See, hit and miss means you hit it. Sometimes you miss it. But if you touch and now you're going, you got something, you're running with it. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; We found out the other day that they had a a mock ceremony burning the red heer. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Oh, we got quiet in here again. Huh? And it came it occurred to us. We started looking at it. We thought, well, they'll build the temple and then they'll sacrifice the three red heers, &gt;&gt; right? But brother, the hepher was sacrificed before the temple goes up &gt;&gt; to to sanctify and and thank God for the property or whatever they're going to do. Then it goes up. Then they start their sacrif then they start their sacrificial worship. &gt;&gt; Now I'd like to see what happens when the word really gets out and all these tree huggers and animal lovers start yelling at Israel because they're burning up innocent cows. It's going to happen. You watch. Someone's going to complain, you know, some whatever the you know what I mean. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And I thought they're doing mockery. Yeah, because you see it's been 3 years since they had one born and it has to be three and a half years old and we're getting to that mark right now. Why? Why does that mean anything? Because brother Brandham said if the temple goes up and you see the sacrificial worship again, you've missed the rapture. &gt;&gt; Well, brother, I'm not looking to miss it. I'm watching how close we're getting. And listen, there ain't nobody in this room going to miss it. I promise you that. Now, how how can you say that? Because I know it. Because God is showing too much revelation for anybody to be left behind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; You're not just going to be a message believer. You got to be a message doer. &gt;&gt; You can't just be a Bible thumper. You got to be a Bible reader and a Bible believer. &gt;&gt; If you're going to quote scripture, you better know what you're talking about. And if you're going to quote the quotes within, brother, quote them all and put them in the right sequence. &gt;&gt; Don't just don't just separate your favorite and use it for your own little doctrine. It's got to match from point A to point C. &gt;&gt; And the B in the middle is I believe Christ. Come on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All right. So, we got the 11th hour worker here. See, he says, "What are you doing standing around?" This is scriptures now. uh Matthew chapter 20 and I'm at verse uh 7 and they said uh they said because uh no man has hired us. We're standing around doing nothing. Verse 7, chapter 20. &gt;&gt; We're standing around doing nothing because no one has hired us. Now look, Temple of Amazing Grace, if you've heard this and you said amen on Sunday, you need to say amen here. &gt;&gt; All right, it's not old news. It's the same news. &gt;&gt; You know, I don't want to sound like brother Brandon's kids. We prayed over that yesterday. &gt;&gt; It's the same food and this is different. &gt;&gt; We just keep on chewing it. All right. &gt;&gt; Maybe they're tired cuz they drove all that way. Huh? Lay off, Caleb. Lay off. All right. Look here. Because no man hired us. And I I wanted to point this out. You see what what happens is and many of you got friends. How many of you not not our group friends here from amazing uh spirit spirit and truth? How many got friends in school? Hands up. Hands up. Hands up. &gt;&gt; Hands up. Hands up. Come on. &gt;&gt; They're home. &gt;&gt; All right. Y'all ain't got no friends then. &gt;&gt; Well, this this ain't going to work for y'all. I'm going to change the sermon. &gt;&gt; But the thing is, okay, how about you grown-ups? Y'all have jobs or do you home job? &gt;&gt; Huh? You got jobs, right? &gt;&gt; You got friends in your job. You got acquaintances, people you know. &gt;&gt; Okay, here's what I was getting at. The people, one person in our church, one little lady decided to invite a boy that she'd been seeing because I keep saying if you're going to date somebody out in the world, you better bring them to church, find out what kind of person they are. &gt;&gt; If they don't come when you invite them, if they come and they they don't like it and they leave, well, just you better get rid of them because that ain't the right person for you. &gt;&gt; Cuz I can understand God can lead someone to you, but he's going to make them the right person for you. Okay, I know we want to keep it in the family, keep it in church, but look, after a while, we're marrying cousins after cousins. You can't be doing all that, and Mexicans are all related. That's it gets it gets kind of messy. &gt;&gt; I'm being serious now. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you black people, we got cousins everywhere. &gt;&gt; We call each other cousin. Even they call me Theo even though I ain't your I'm not your uncle. Why? &gt;&gt; All right. So you got friends and what happened when she invited this boy. I said, "Okay, all right." Okay. Nice native brother, long hair and everything. And I I had to tell the whole people, "Look, he's a Native American. He's got long hair. Leave him alone. I mean, that's his tradition. Don't tell him nothing. If God wants him to cut it, he'll cut it. And I won't tell you why it happened. He finally told me. But when it did, it happened." And it was all by himself. But he's already been baptized and he worships harder than anybody else I see in the young group anyway, as far as males go. And then they invited somebody. and they invited somebody and sister Sarah invited somebody and uh where's Abby? Abby. Abby. Abby, you invited somebody and then and then and they invited somebody and then and next thing you know we got all these little kids coming around all 16 17 years old. What's going on here? &gt;&gt; And it says here nobody hired us. We don't go to work because nobody invited us. &gt;&gt; And we found out what was it? 95% of the people that have friends who go to church do not go to church because 95% of them said they're never invited. &gt;&gt; Now, we're not even talking message. We're just talking church in general. &gt;&gt; You know, I got to tell you the truth. The so-called message people turn out to be a bunch of snobs &gt;&gt; because we have a truth that is greater than any truth that has ever struck the face of the earth. But we think we're better than everybody else. Oh, we're brides. So, we can't be we can't associate with you long hair, short skirt, and all. Why don't you just be a witness? &gt;&gt; If what you think you have is so great, then why don't you just be a witness? &gt;&gt; Be an example and be you what the salt of the earth. &gt;&gt; In other words, make it taste good. &gt;&gt; You know, we're too busy walking around dragging our chin to the floor. I'm a Christian believer. I'm miserable. That's not salty, man. That's like putting &gt;&gt; sauerkraut on toiso and eggs. That ain't gonna taste no good. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; That's like putting something nasty on chicken. Like, what'd you do that for? It was fine the way it was. &gt;&gt; You want to be the salt of the earth. You want to savor the flavor. You want to enhance it. &gt;&gt; So, if you're going to have this attitude that you're better than everybody, you better show a life that's better. See, nobody hired us. Nobody invited us. And then what's happened is uh last Sunday we had seven more come in. But now it's changed. Instead of us asking them, it's people going, "Hey, what church do you go to? &gt;&gt; What church do you go to?" And I was teasing your son the other day. He I go, "What happened?" Well, they asked me. And I said, "What happened? You You figured you better show up if they show up?" And he started laughing. I told him, "You had to you had been He works a lot." And I said, "You hadn't been here in a minute. He figured how to come back. He couldn't come back empty-handed. So, he brought four friends with him. He started laughing. He said, "That's right. That's right." You know, I said, "But hey," he brought four. We just went over here. And I go, "What's going on? They're asking. It's become an epidemic in the church." And I love it. &gt;&gt; I love it. We had one lady jump the fence to get in. &gt;&gt; I'm not playing. I'm witnessing to you now. I'm not bragging. I'm telling you, look, we're at the end time. the the the whole spectrum of it has changed. &gt;&gt; Right. You said something. We don't make those sacrifices. We don't drive that far. When brother Brandon was here, we used to. &gt;&gt; Not me. I wouldn't even lie. But they used to. &gt;&gt; Right. But now, and I'm not I don't I don't expect all these to follow me every single time. I don't think they're following me. They just wanted to come along and bless you and see you and hear what the Lord. It just it fires us up. We go home. We see how people receive what is being said. We go home and that makes us more on fire than we were before we came out here. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; This is a family effort. &gt;&gt; I'm tired of living on earth for now. How about the rest of you? &gt;&gt; It's time to go home. &gt;&gt; It's time to move on. &gt;&gt; I've had it with this place. &gt;&gt; What happened was the gates we closed the gates. We that church is kind of in a funny neighborhood right now and got a bunch of fentanyl people walking around. You know how it is. &gt;&gt; So we closed the gates. We had people trying to get in cars like we can't have that, you know. So uh all of a sudden I see my deacons run out the door. All of them. &gt;&gt; What was it some I I told you Jesse? Was it something I said, you know, trying to make it calm? And and I go what's going on? And somebody in the back said somebody jumped the gate. Well, this day and age with all the church shootings and things we got, I said, "Hey, somebody locked that door now. Hurry up." &gt;&gt; That's closest to the pastor. You want to lock that one there. Then I told everybody to calm down, relax, you know, we'll see what happens. And after a little bit, this little white lady comes walking in the door and all the digs behind her. Said, "What? What? What is this?" I said, "Are you the one that jumped the gate?" She got all embarrassed. She says, "Yeah." And she said, "What'd you jump the gate for? We would have opened it for you." She goes, "I I came to come have church with my son." Who's your son? This guy, Adam. Okay. He invited his mom and and you know what? Let's be honest. &gt;&gt; Let's be very honest now. &gt;&gt; If it was you and I and the gates were closed, we'd have turned around and took off. &gt;&gt; Am I right? &gt;&gt; Come on, bride. Am I right? &gt;&gt; We just said, "I guess they just don't want me here. They knew I was coming." &gt;&gt; Come on. This is the attitude that we have. &gt;&gt; But here is a nobody. She had a need. &gt;&gt; She said so. After church, I had brother Nathan said, "Come up here and put hands on. I don't want I don't want to be no holy man. I'm I know what I'm trying to do here. What I want this there there's there's a time and a push me to get involved because I got ministry now. I want the people to depend on them as much as they depend on me." You understand? My job is to bring the word. You all pray for them. You all cast them. You all take care of them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; If it's serious, I'll get involved. But I said, "Come put your hand on her." And I said, "Thus say the Lord. Whatever you have need of, whatever, if it's sickness, if it's this, if it's that, you just receive it. She started crying, raise her hand. She had a need and she was not going to leave until she got that need. So, she jumped the gate to get in. &gt;&gt; I don't mind telling you I have a little bit of bragging rights. So, I called up brother Israel and brother Jason. I said, "How was y'all's church yesterday?" I did. Oh, we had a good service, brother. Tremendous. Did you have anybody jump your gate to get in? I called up brother Jason said, "Brother Jason said, brother Caleb, God bless you. God bless. Hey, how was your service?" Said, "Well, we had a my," you know, "All right. Did you have anybody jump your gate to get in?" What do you mean? I said, "We had a lady jump our fence. She wasn't going to let this 7 foot, 6', 7 foot fence stop her." And she had arms. &gt;&gt; She had arms. She got I don't know what she I would have liked to seen it, but JJ said she like she hurdled it. I said hurled it. I would have had to try to bend it to squeeze through. not going to jump that fence. &gt;&gt; But somebody has a need. &gt;&gt; And if there's a hunger and a thirst, you're going to get it. I don't care how you get it. You're going to get it and do everything you got to get it. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; All right. All right. See, whatever it takes, I want to take the promised land. &gt;&gt; Whatever we do, I don't want to see death. I want to get on to the other side. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, fellowship has opened up in Tucson all of a sudden. We, Brother Doro and I are we have really close churches proximity. We're 1,56 feet away from each other. &gt;&gt; To put that into perspective, that's across the parkway, the the parking lot here. &gt;&gt; I'm serious. &gt;&gt; In the corner store there, you'd be from here to there. Now, I can't see him, but that's all close. &gt;&gt; It was funny. Uh I hope you don't see this. Where's the camera? Hi, brother Israel. wherever you are. I'm just playing. But we went there with me and brother Ally for a little meeting they were having and and the song leader got up and he shouldn't have started and he said, "Hey, brother Caleb, if you just leave your door open facing us, you'll hear some real real worship." &gt;&gt; He's playing. He was joking. And brother Israel looked at him like, "Why'd you do that?" Because he knew I was going to get him. I said, "If you keep it open, you hear some real preaching. Brother Israel goes, Brother looked at me, he goes, "That was just foolish. Why'd you even start with him?" "Come on, Caleb." And we walked off. We're friends now. You see, he goes, "I don't even know why that boy started with you." Why did he say that? I go, he walked right into his. I'm sorry. That was not personal. He goes, I know you had to get him. I had to. But now he's preached for me and I preached for him and we're having a wonderful time. All of a sudden, people said, "Hey, I didn't know you like they're surprised. I believe the message." I never stopped. &gt;&gt; How often do you say Moses said? &gt;&gt; How often do you say Elijah said? How often do you say Jonah? But you say the Bible said, the Bible said, the Bible said. &gt;&gt; So because I don't say brother said, that doesn't make me a believer. &gt;&gt; No, it means that I mean it, I believe it. I don't have to say who said it. Because if you got the same spirit tapping in here that I got, you don't have to be told who said it. You'll know it came from God. &gt;&gt; You'll know it came from God. &gt;&gt; If you need proof, I'll give it to you. I'll give you Matthew chapter 1 verse 16. Whatever. Just keep on moving. &gt;&gt; We're hung up on who knows what. It's all about knowledge. That's not the 11th hour worker's job. Now, &gt;&gt; brother Ben, I have the quote with you. Brother says on the quote, he said it'll be quickened to you. He said the 11th thou worker won't have time to come and study fast and pray. He said they would go straight from the milk. They would skip the milk and go straight for the meat. Born with teeth. &gt;&gt; It would have a revelation because it would be quickened. Look up that word quickened to them. &gt;&gt; So these young people all suen shouting and saying amen and screaming at me. I'm looking even I had my doubts. Brother Jack looked back. There's no way they know what I mean. And the and that's what I said a little bit ago. The Holy Spirit said, "What about the 11th hour worker?" It's being quickened to them. And I'll tell you what, somebody who's been in church 30 years, 35 years. Some of us who've been in there 25 years, whatever it is, and never really understood. We said, "Amen. We like the fellowship. We're here for the miracles. We like the spoken word, but I don't really get it. I don't." All of a sudden, I go, "Oh, what happened?" All of a sudden, I get this. &gt;&gt; Well, what happened? You've been here all this time. I don't know. But suddenly, it's being quickened to me. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Brother Nathan and I uh were invited to a a Bible uh club. They didn't have those when I was in school either. Did they have those when you were in school? That stuff was outlawed. We weren't allowed, but they have them now. And so I had a chance took Naen with me and and uh I was invited. I said, "Nathan, why don't you come with me?" And we get there and y'all told me there was like 12. And I told your cousin, I said, "Are you dyslexic or something?" There's 21 kids in here. Well, the 21 kids a pretty good group. &gt;&gt; And they all were there for what? They wanted to hear the testimony of their pastor and how I became what I was, the kind of struggles I went through. And then they heard Nathan's testimony. And we get out of there and what, two or three of them walked up to brother Nathan said, "Where's your church at we want to go to, but they realize I have seven of them." Now I got three more of them. I said, "It won't be long. We'll get all 21 of these kids in there." And their parents are going to have to follow. &gt;&gt; Come on. So if you young people want to find out where you fit, where you fit is to keep the church alive. &gt;&gt; If the Lord should carry and brother Jack should pass on, which he won't. &gt;&gt; I'm I'll say amen to you, brother Jack. Brother Jack got like, &gt;&gt; "Come on now, right?" I said, "And brother Jack won't." Amen. &gt;&gt; That's a lot better than the first time. &gt;&gt; He got nervous. &gt;&gt; You just go ahead and cancel the life insurance. Don't you worry about that. Now look here. And I believe that he won't. But if he was to, then that means somebody's got to take his place. &gt;&gt; Somebody's got to keep holding the Bible and moving on with God. &gt;&gt; And I told Brother Jesse this, and I told Brother Nathan and brother Alzer, if I die and I won't. &gt;&gt; Thank you. I appreciate that. Thank you. Where was you for brother Jack a minute ago? Come on now. &gt;&gt; And I won't. But if I should, right? If I should, I don't want the work to stop because I'm not there. &gt;&gt; I don't want them walking around for seven years without a pastor. I want you all to step right in and just keep on moving and don't you stop for nothing. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And he said, well, the 11th hour, he says, okay. He said, so nobody invited you. He said, ' Then go into the vineyard. Then he goes, "No one asked you. No one want to hire you. I'll hire you. Tell you what, go off into the vineyard." He said, "Go off into the vineyard." He said, "And when you do work, whatever you think you are owed, I will pay you." And so they go off and they work and they get paid. Now, here's what happens. When it's time for everybody to get their checks and their reward, you're going to have people that said, "Well, you know, I believe Brother Brandham the whole time." You know, I was with him when this, this, and this. Because you had that when it came to Jesus. Well, I was with him when this, this, and this. They challenged Paul that way. You know what gets me about Saul before he was Paul is that Saul must have known who he was. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; How could he not have? &gt;&gt; Wow. He was being raised to be the next high priest. I think if we look at history and the timing is so the disciples were still alive. So how did he not know? How could he not know who Jesus was? &gt;&gt; There had to be some kind of knowledge of who he was. &gt;&gt; Maybe he was just a little, you know, a youngster in the group there, but he must have seen him at least once. &gt;&gt; I I don't know. I I don't have Bible on that. I just wondered. But when he had people come up to him and say, "Well, I was baptized this way and this one walked with Jesus or I was this and I was that." Paul said, "I'm glad that I didn't touch one of you because I don't want to know anything you all know except you and Jesus and him crucified and you baptized in his name. &gt;&gt; I don't want I'm glad I didn't baptize none of you." That's what his attitude was. And I'm sitting here thinking to myself, "Okay, fine. I don't get invited to these big shot churches. I'm glad that I've never been asked to go cuz I'd rather go to the Lord's chosen few. I don't want to go to a bunch of people who are polished up and can out quote me and tell me this and then all of a sudden God I preach like John Haggy and God said and I'm like what is that all about? Why don't you just be what you are an uneducated believer &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to be polished and all shined up. Who cares about that? Yeah, I'm getting sweaty. So what? Well, brother, we're in an age where we're above shouting. Where does it say that? &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; I mean, I know you know your Bible, but &gt;&gt; I mean, I'm not 91, but where does it say we're above shouting? &gt;&gt; Where where does it say the bride has matured and turned the corner? Well, where does it say that? I don't have that. Do you have a different Bible than I got? &gt;&gt; What quote? Where was that quote at? Someone give me the quote. I want to see it. It doesn't say that at all. As a matter of fact, the greater the revelation, the greater the shout. &gt;&gt; The greater the victory, the greater the shout. &gt;&gt; The greater the knowledge, the greater the shout. &gt;&gt; The more love you have a goof, the greater the shout. &gt;&gt; And the shout has got to be in the enemy's camp. In the king's camp. Not in the enemy's camp, but in the king's camp. Amen. &gt;&gt; What I meant to say there was it's too often the shout is in the enemy's camp is far greater than the one that's in the king's camp. &gt;&gt; Right. And we're shaking for fear of the Philistines. They're too many. The Amalachites, they're too many. The websites, they're everywhere. You can see anything. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; We can look up this and we can check up this guy and check that one out. We find out this, we find out that. But I want to know something. Is the shout of the king in the king's camp? Somebody say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's got to be in you. And it doesn't come from somebody saying, "Amen." It comes from way down deep. And you're saying, "Amen." And you're thinking to yourself, "Why am I shouting?" Amen. I don't even know what he said. Yes. But it's been quickened to you by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Are one of the 11th hour workers listening to me this night, whoever is watching online, whatever, however this goes out, Brother Jack, however big your audience is, I hope they grab this. The 11th hour work is awake. They know who they are or don't know. But God knows exactly who you are. &gt;&gt; Watch this now. I can't believe this. We got inflation in our church. But see, they received everyone a penny. I don't know how far a penny goes, but that's what they got back then. Y'all wouldn't do nothing for a penny, would you? They supposed that they should have received more. We're talking about the guys who were there all the way through, right? The ones who walked with brother Brandham. The ones who believed with them. The ones who walked with Jesus. The ones who were there. The ones that Well, wait a minute. None of them were at the cross. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Not the big shots. &gt;&gt; But they wanted a bigger reward. But I like this. These last have wrought but one hour. He said this in verse 12. They're saying to him, "Thou has made them equal unto us." I've seen people with the revelation that God has given us, Brother Jack, and they sitting around going, "Now, why would God give that to him?" &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Now, they not saying it, but I can, you know what I'm talking about. How did God give that to him? I don't know. Maybe because I was honest and said, "I am ugly. I am dirty. &gt;&gt; I am filthy, Lord." But nonetheless, I need the Oh, how I need you. &gt;&gt; Huh? Amen. &gt;&gt; I like that little song. That little song you threw in there. That little diddy right there. Yeah. Every hour I need you. See, it isn't about look how long I've walked and look how long I've been here. Look how pimp I am and now I've grown and I don't shout no more and I better clap like this and raise my hands like that. Wouldn't you know when you first came to Jesus, you were snotting. You were spitting. You were pulling a guy. You were screaming. Stomp on the floor. Lord, I need you. &gt;&gt; When does that ever change? Because if you leave me alone long enough and you all want to walk out and come back in about an hour, you'd see Brother Caleb, Pastor Caleb on the altar still saying, "God, I need you." &gt;&gt; Brother Jack, you ever get like that or you too proud to beg now? Huh? &gt;&gt; How many times Eric found him crying just him alone? He's praying. Don't even bother him cuz he's in there talking to God. &gt;&gt; A real believer will never forget where they came from. I'm glad he forgets, &gt;&gt; but it keeps it in the center of my mind somehow. From the left to the right, from the back to the front, there's an image of a man on a cross. And it reminds me that once I was, look, remember this. My sins put him there. &gt;&gt; I was the one that crucified the Lord. &gt;&gt; I drove the nails through his hand. Yet at the same time, I was there when he rose again. Now you tell me how that works. &gt;&gt; You tell me how that works. &gt;&gt; Because somebody said, "I am ugly. I am filthy. I am a sinner. I was born that way. But that's why I'm talking to you. Duh. &gt;&gt; I need you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You said your blood was for me. So here I am. One drop. That's enough. Okay, fine. But if you don't mind, just baptize me in it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Peter said, "Don't just wash my feet. Wash everything." Well, when he comes along with his blood, don't just put a little smart. No, no. Dump the blood on me, man. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Say it. &gt;&gt; 11 hour worker, you're here. I'm here. We're here. &gt;&gt; Always recognized that I was part of this group. I'm serious. I don't count myself a 10th hour or whatever first hour. Forget about it. I'm an 11th hour worker. I came in at 11:01. Y'all coming in at 11:59. &gt;&gt; It's the same hour. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Brother Jack, I don't know when you came in. Maybe you came in 11:00 on the dot. I don't care and I don't know. But the 11th hour is here. &gt;&gt; You talk about a doomsday clock. Did you see the other day they moved it past midnight? &gt;&gt; Past midnight. I need to move. Let me see. Uh uh they're complaining. And in verse 13, he said, "But he answered one of them and said,"Friend, I do thee no wrong." Oh, I love it. Did not thou agree with me for a penny? Isn't this all you asked for? &gt;&gt; Didn't you merely ask to have a picture with him? &gt;&gt; Didn't you only want a fishing trip? Didn't you want a church that was built around the testimony and memory of what you did with him? Isn't that what you wanted? I gave it to you. &gt;&gt; Well, why is he getting because he asked for more? &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; The 11th hour worker says, I'll do that and then some. &gt;&gt; I'll take that and all you got for me. &gt;&gt; Lord, I want revelation. I want understanding to that revelation. I want to be able to explain it somehow &gt;&gt; if I'm asked. Why do you wear dresses? Oh, because my church says so. &gt;&gt; That's not an answer. And I'm not going to get on that kind of stuff because to me, that's just juvenile. Now, &gt;&gt; you if you don't know by now, you got to dress right, something's wrong with your experience. &gt;&gt; Because brother Jack and brother Caleb shouldn't be standing up here telling you girls how to dressing you men how to be respectful. That's something that comes with a filling of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; He said, "I will send the tutor. So, well, Brother Kev, I can't get them to change. I don't care if you can't get them to change their clothes. Get them to the altar and get them to change their attitude with God. [Music] &gt;&gt; I don't want to embarrass my daughter too much more than I have to, but I will anyhow. Every time she gets disrespectful, and it's very rare, look at her little sweet disposition. You can't imagine it, right? Having a bad day. Nate, don't ever have one. Look at her. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But there, every teenager's got their moments. Well, if you brothers don't say amen, you forgot what it was like to be 14. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; All right. You never got sassy with your dad. &gt;&gt; You never got one of these. Never mind. I had to learn to bob and weave. Man, I was right. But the first thing she does is gets upset with herself. And I've asked questions. I've heard her in the, you know, she goes in to take a shower and we can hear her sometimes getting upset and telling God, I don't want to be like this. You can just hear her, you know, kind of praying, leave her alone or she'll go in a room and she'll be crying and I have to kind of wait until she's kind of done knocking on door, what's the matter? I don't like talking to mom like that. I don't like having attitude. I don't like feeling like what am I supposed to do? What have I done wrong? You ain't done nothing wrong. Your your spirit is reacting to your flesh. that you just continue to pray and ask God to get rid of the flesh and just continue to be more like him. &gt;&gt; You don't got to be perfect. &gt;&gt; I don't want people at my church that's perfect. Matter of fact, I'm excited that we got all these dirty kids. If y'all are watching, I love you. I don't know where they're at. Don't leave. Oh, there you are. They understand. I've told them all the same thing. I'm proud of them, Brother Jack. &gt;&gt; I'm proud of them. I wouldn't change if I wouldn't take any other group for them because they're innocent. And I the best group of people to talk to is a group of people that don't know anything about it &gt;&gt; cuz then they don't argue with you. &gt;&gt; How do you know that? Cuz I said so. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; You you can teach them. They're teachable. &gt;&gt; You ever watch these people come from another church? Don't worry. They won't ever be there long. If they go if you got if they got a reputation of going place to place to place and they hate your place. Well, that's all right. I I shouldn't have never said it, but I had a couple come in like that and I said, "Oh, they won't give them two years. They'll be gone." Sure enough, they said, "How do you know that?" Say, "Because they always stay two years at everybody else's place." &gt;&gt; I mean, what kind of reputation is that, brother? &gt;&gt; Right. They need to get to an altar, but they don't think they have to. &gt;&gt; And yet, here's a pastor who says, "I need the altar every day of my life." Anybody else want to join me on that? &gt;&gt; Come on, sis. Get your hand up there. Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; There you go. A little higher. Little higher. You can do it. &gt;&gt; Come on. New York. I'm talking to you. New York. Come on. She got a shirt on and said New York. She looked down. Oh, come on now. Don't be ashamed, right? &gt;&gt; This is not the time for this. This is the time to get serious with God. We're so close to the end. I don't want anybody to miss it. Brother Brandham said this. He said, "I don't want my" He said, "I want my family to make it. I want my friends to make it. I even want my &gt;&gt; to make it." &gt;&gt; Let's be real, man. There's people in this room that don't care if their enemies go or not. &gt;&gt; Brother Paul, he started laughing. You know what I'm saying? I've heard people talk like that. Well, watch. when they when I make it and they don't, I say, "Hold on, brother, sister. Hold on a minute. If you're talking like that, you don't have to worry about what they think because you be right there with them." &gt;&gt; And don't be surprised if they're walking in before you do. &gt;&gt; Not that it matters. I don't care if I go in last or go in first. I just want to go in. &gt;&gt; Come on. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You know, a lot of people reacted to this. Uh, I'm going to call him brother. Charlie Kurd bit past a lot of people. Some people calling him racist, some people saying this, saying that. I don't care what he was. The man's dead. &gt;&gt; Let's show a little bit of respect. &gt;&gt; He may not have been a perfect person, but which one of us is? &gt;&gt; Oh, oops. I almost put my hand up. See, outside the blood of Christ, which one of us never never made no mistakes? Hey, outside the blood, how many of you've never been racist at some point or another? &gt;&gt; Come on, black people. Don't act like you don't get like that, too. Right. &gt;&gt; Black people can be more racist than us or white people. It's true. &gt;&gt; It's true. &gt;&gt; You know what it is? You don't say. You don't say. You don't call them crack or nothing like that. But you say it's because I'm black. Well, that's racism. &gt;&gt; You're racist against your own self. &gt;&gt; I ain't even said you were black. You're the one pointing out you black all the time. But you're not even black. You're like a dark brown. &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to be funny. You know, it comes out that way. I'm just saying racism is all kind. Look, the bride of Christ is racist. &gt;&gt; We're snobs. &gt;&gt; We're better than everybody else. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; We got like a hierarchy. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. It's in the message, too. There there's some there's some prejudice in the message. I know there is. &gt;&gt; They don't belong in this message. &gt;&gt; Strange how the colors the colored people only say that, right? But I've heard Brother Green say that, too. Racism don't belong in this message. But I've heard stories about him. I turn around and say, "You know what? I don't care what anybody says. People are dead. They We got to be respectful." And this man died. I'll tell you what, whether he was perfect or not, whether he was racist or not, whether he was this or not, the man died doing what a lot of us do not do in the first place. &gt;&gt; I don't even like Jake Paul, that fake boxer guy. But you know what he said? One thing I appreciate, he said, "The man died for telling the truth." &gt;&gt; And that's a that's a plain fact. You got to respect that. &gt;&gt; But then I have to ask I got to beg another question. There are missionaries and dignitaries within our ranks that die every day in Africa for what they believe in and what they stand for. But ain't nobody lighting candles or having visuals for them. &gt;&gt; If you want to be if you want to if you want to feel sorry for him or his family, I'll tell you what. Why don't you take your Bible and your message book and go do what he did? &gt;&gt; Why you know what? But if I have known they were going to have that rally, I think they said like a thousand. How many say you showed up at U of A? But I'm of a thousand. Boom. Who's that? Well, if I'd have known that, I'd have showed up &gt;&gt; and I have said, "Hey, can I uh can I grab the mic? I'm a pastor. Can I hold the mic for a second?" I'd have let them know who I was and I would say in the memory of let me tell you who Jesus is. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Where do we ever get the nerve to stand up and say what we believe? Oh, not the message. You don't even testify about Jesus, let alone the message. &gt;&gt; We need to become 11 without worker and do the job we were called to do. &gt;&gt; And that is to get on fire for God. &gt;&gt; You know why some people get mad at them? Because they're ashamed. They ain't nothing like him. &gt;&gt; I remember this. There ain't nobody in this room like Jesus. Nobody says amen. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; There ain't no one in this room like brother Brandham. No, you're not saying things. You know where I'm going with that. Brother Green used to say that all the time. There's nobody on earth that been like brother Random. And everybody say, "Amen." He goes, "Isn't that a shame? There ain't nobody like Jesus." Everybody shout, "Amen." And brother Green say, "Well, that's a shame, isn't it?" &gt;&gt; And we'd all kind of get like, "We should be like Jesus &gt;&gt; by now. We should be like brother Brandham." Amen. &gt;&gt; No, not like an uneducated an uneducated uh seventh grade uh you know education whatever Kentucky. I mean the spirit of the sold out of it the the all all bulletins posted all guns in everything you're going to do. I'm all in. I'm all in. I'm all in. &gt;&gt; Sold out. Trying God and keeping him at his word. Lord, you said when that little dog was run over, that little two and a half dog was run over, he went around the corner to the house and he said, "Lord, you said in your word that if I delight myself in you, you'd give me the desire of my heart and I want that little dog to live." And he walked out, he goes, "Come on, boy." And that little dog jumped up, came back to life with nothing wrong with it. &gt;&gt; When was the last time you challenged God like that? I &gt;&gt; told you last time I was out here when I stood out there in the on the shores of that ocean. I was moving the wave this way and moving the wave that way. It was funny and y'all didn't didn't doubt me. You believed me. I appreciated that. And I remember brother Jesse behind me and sister Dawson watching. Brother Jesse come up behind me in the water. He goes, "Can I try that?" Remember Jess about the water and all the waves and everything? And then Jesse stood there and all a sudden the glass went flying off. But he didn't give up. He kept trying anyway. He kept trying. I looked at him. I said, "Lord, help him just one time." It isn't that he didn't. What got me was that he tried. &gt;&gt; You know, we always talk about Peter sinking. At least he got off the boat. &gt;&gt; I got a question for you. How do you get back on it? &gt;&gt; We What? Well, the Bible don't recognize that, does it? &gt;&gt; His buddies didn't put that in the script, did they? &gt;&gt; All they mentioned was that he fell. Wow. &gt;&gt; All they mentioned was that he was possibly racist. &gt;&gt; All they did was possibly mention that he had, you know, encounters of some kind that was immoral. All they want to do was drag his sins out. All they want to do is show that at one point he doubted and began to sink. &gt;&gt; But nobody can tell me how he got back. &gt;&gt; He had to have walked back. &gt;&gt; Jesus took him up. Said, "Why did you doubt, man? Come on." Hand in hand. They went walking back to the boat. Get in. At least we got the nerve to try. &gt;&gt; How many times did God use you to speak the word, but you never told anybody &gt;&gt; and you know it was true. How many dreams have you had that come to pass and you know the truth? Brother Jack, I'm veering way off the notes. You understand? I hope it's all right. Is this all right with everybody? &gt;&gt; How many times have you done these things and you know that God did them for you, but you're too embarrassed to tell anybody? &gt;&gt; Huh? You don't want to witness about it because you don't want to look like a fanatic of some kind. You don't look like a a brandomite. Well, I'm not a branomite. I'm a Christian. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; I'm not I'm not on it at all. It's time for AI to die, brother Jack. &gt;&gt; I thought that was I think if we you'd have dug just a little bit further. The Lord was telling you something when he said it's time for I to die and this AI thing came out. I said, "hm, &gt;&gt; I think I think brother Jack was on to something there." &gt;&gt; That can make you say things that you never said, do things you never did. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; All this stuff come out. They going to make Brother Brandon say things ain't never saw never let him do &gt;&gt; or he never said. Huh? &gt;&gt; Come on. They'll do the same thing to you if they can get your voice, &gt;&gt; right? Lie on you. Say something about you. When you Where's your faith then? &gt;&gt; We're going to be challenged soon. I think what bothered a lot of people about that was that this man was a bonafide uh Christian. Regardless of whatever he felt or believed outside of it publicly, he was a Christian. That's what people saw. &gt;&gt; So, it's it it kind of pulled us all in kind of &gt;&gt; because brother Brandon said one day he'd be shot for praying for the sick &gt;&gt; or speaking the gospel. Wow. &gt;&gt; Then here you got somebody not only on television, but around the world, people saw this man shot and killed right in front of everybody &gt;&gt; for talking about Jesus. &gt;&gt; Well, let's just pray that when that happens to us, we got enough power to get shot and keep on going. &gt;&gt; Enough of the Holy Ghost to just keep on moving. &gt;&gt; Because I believe there's a time when we're going to get so close to God and have the power to speak the word and the power of the Holy Spirit, that short, quick work. I don't think you're going to fall dead when you get shot. You're going to stand right up &gt;&gt; and say, "Man, I wish you wouldn't have done that. He ain't kind of lost my place." Now, in the notes, it says here like, "God, this guy's still living." &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Look, they killed Jesus. They did. They killed him. &gt;&gt; But three days later, he was walking the same earth that they killed him off of. &gt;&gt; When is Jesus going to be Jesus in you? &gt;&gt; Cuz if that same spirit that rose Christ from the dead, if it dwells in you, it will quicken your mortal body. I sit there and wonder if that man had what we had. Would he have stood right back up? &gt;&gt; What would the world do with that? Well, I'll tell you what. Jesus said, "Though one be raised from the dead, they'd still not believe." &gt;&gt; We're in that hour. You'll watch. You'll see. &gt;&gt; 11th hour has got to get stronger. You got to you got to just get with it. You might not have time to study and pray, but you just need to believe it. Whatever brother Jack says over this place, just believe God. &gt;&gt; Well, you mean I don't have to go back and study. You going to second guess your pastor? Does he have the Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; Then you know I don't got to second guess. Nobody got the Holy Ghost. If it's real, I know it's real. &gt;&gt; My God is real. &gt;&gt; He said, uh, did I do I do the no wrong? Did not you didn't agree for this. Take that thine is and go thy way. In other words, take what you've asked for. All you wanted was an experience. All you wanted was a chill up your back. All you wanted was a testimony. All you wanted was a a little relic of some kind of you you got his his cufflings or you got the windshield or whatever it was. That's what you wanted. That's what you got. But this group over here and this group over here, they want to be adopted. &gt;&gt; They want to get the fullness of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; They want to walk from this life to the next without seeing death. They want something different. They want more because we realize that God can give us more. Amen. &gt;&gt; You wanted to be saved, but this group over here wants their entire family saved. &gt;&gt; You wanted the Holy Ghost. But see, this group over here, they'd rather give up the ghost and let the family not get the Holy Ghost. Come on. &gt;&gt; You wanted to see You wanted to see heaven and get there. But this group over here would rather take their their family members place into hell than let them see them than see them miss heaven. If anybody ever been that way. Oh, there's people I would rather take hell for them, Brother Jack. And I mean that I love them enough to say, "Lord, they wouldn't be able to hack it. I may not be able to take them in my place. If you ever paid that way, something different is alive in you." &gt;&gt; I went through some uh trials here recently. Had to eat some humble pie. Missed out on a good trip. All my friends went was excited. I was going to go. Some other things took place, but I got this problem and that problem. And then, believe it or not, I missed the plane. That don't ever happen. And uh then the the the brothers who were supposed to uh cover me, one got sick and the other one got called into work. And I thought, well, if I wouldn't have been here, what's going on here? But see, there was some there's something ticking that's different inside of me. Instead of being upset that I missed a trip, instead of getting angry with God for, you know, for what looked like a generous correction, you know what I did? I said, "Thank you, Lord. I appreciate what you've taught me." &gt;&gt; I got shingles for a while. I don't have them anymore, so I'm not contagious. Everybody relax. And every time I move, they hurt. My back gets sore still. They said they'll hang out for six months. No, I won't. I'm gonna pray this off. But the Holy Spirit told me, "I'm going to leave it there as a lesson to you. You brought this stress on yourself." And I I'll go into that some other time. But every time I felt it, ow. I remember and I think, "Thank you, Lord, for that lesson you taught me." And when I walked into church that Sunday morning that I was supposed to have everybody filling in for me, my younger brother shows up. He ain't been in church in years. And when I looked over at him, the Lord told me, "Because of the way you responded, I'm giving you your brother. [Applause] It ain't going to stop there either. &gt;&gt; It ain't going to stop there either. If God will do that for the pastor, if you'll just submit yourself and let God correct you and teach you and and guide you and you answer your you answer your Lord the right way, he's going to let you have what you have need of. He'll give you your family. He'll give you your loved ones. He'll give every I don't care how bad it is, how many kids they got, how baby mama drama, daddy drama, drug, I don't care what they're on. If you'll just obey God, he'll give every last one of them to you. That's thus sayeth the Lord. Even now, &gt;&gt; if you can believe it, say amen. &gt;&gt; I don't say things to brag. This is what God did for me. I say things to show you that if you do it for me, he'll do it for you. And why not? Huh? And why not? &gt;&gt; Why are you giving this revelation to him? Well, why not? You didn't ask for it. &gt;&gt; Huh? The Bible tells us to ask for understanding. &gt;&gt; Not knowledge necessarily, but understanding. &gt;&gt; Give us more revelation. Lord, show us what we're missing. &gt;&gt; Because, Brother Jack, if history is a teacher, we should have been gone a while back. &gt;&gt; But something's lacking somewhere. &gt;&gt; Oh, what is it? Well, it's you're waiting on the prophet to do something or this one to do something, even your pastor to do something. But the Bible said the bride or the wife has made herself ready. &gt;&gt; God cannot dress you. He can only supply you. And you have got to get ready yourself. &gt;&gt; And you don't get ready by not understanding or getting more revelation. &gt;&gt; Don't you worry. &gt;&gt; Don't you worry. Don't you worry. They're not that far gone. Don't you worry. I don't care how it looks. Don't you worry. &gt;&gt; Put them in the hands of God. Put them in the hands of God. Leave him there. Don't you ask no more. Just remind God, you gave me my son. You gave me my daughter. You gave me my grandchildren. Don't you ask no more. Don't you ask no more. You tell God, you gave them to me. Now let my eyes see it come to pass. &gt;&gt; I think that was for you. &gt;&gt; And anybody else who wants it. Who wants it? Say amen. &gt;&gt; That's all right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Take thine and go thy way. It's not lawful for me to do evil. And he goes on like that. Now, let me just give you another little bit of uh I'm just going to paraphrase this one. But you know the the parable about the king who created a mighty feast. And he said, "Go onto the highways and the byways and all this." And he said, "No, no, he first he said go invite invite the dignitaries and invite the politicians and invite the kings of the earth and all the governors and and all the presidents and first ladies and whatever what have you." and and he prepared a mighty celebration and you know if feel sorry for him kind of be like President Trump asking everybody to show up you know how they are with him. He threw himself a parade and nobody showed up. I kind of felt best and man if I was there I'd have been like Trump but you know the disrespect. He's still the president. &gt;&gt; The Bible tell us to obey those and honor those who have the rule over us. &gt;&gt; That's right. But we don't know. Well, I don't know about us, but people don't respect anything in this country. &gt;&gt; They watch their parents that are that are uh what do you call them? Anchors and co-hosts and all these people who think they got knowledge about they don't know nothing about anything. But they watch their parents bad talk the president, bad talk senator so and so or or congressman so and so or police chief so and so or judge so and so and then they go home and wonder why Junior doesn't respect them. Huh? &gt;&gt; But it'd be like him, you know, creating a new place and I'm going to have a party and invite everybody. Nobody shows up. So then it'd be like, "Okay, well, if they don't want to show up, we're going to do something different. We're going to do a new thing. It's going to be better than anybody's ever done. Go get Caleb in Tucson, tell him his church to show up, and go invite all these messes people that nobody Can you imagine that? &gt;&gt; And all of us show up because, you know, free food. And we all showed up. Brother Jack, wouldn't that be something? What are you guys doing there? The president invited us. &gt;&gt; Well, you know what he is? Well, I know what you say he is, and yeah, I know some things about him, but he invited us to come. &gt;&gt; The king said nobody would show up. So, he told he got angry. He said, "I did all this work. I tell you what, go get the blind, the deaf, the dumb, the halt, the lame, the poor, the broken, the depressed, the oppressed, the drug addicts. Go get all those losers that nobody wants and invite them to come. &gt;&gt; If they don't want my blood, go get somebody else. &gt;&gt; And we find the gentile bride screaming, "Grace, grace to the headstone." &gt;&gt; We find us walking into a place that once where we were not invited or even welcomed. We couldn't even look at the tabernacle. We couldn't be in it anywhere near it. But now we've gone beyond the outer hole, the outer circle, the inner circle into the most holy of holies. We've gone in where the ark used to be because we have become the ark of the covenant. &gt;&gt; Who you? Yeah. A rejected people, &gt;&gt; a gentile people, a peculiar people. And in the if you look up in the Greek, it doesn't mean strange or odd. It means precious, &gt;&gt; rare, like a gemstone that's kept in a vault to be safe. &gt;&gt; He let us in because nobody else would wanted to. &gt;&gt; The Hebrews wanted rules. Oh, you can't go past the inner court. You can't go past the outer court. Oh, no, no, no, no. You can't go into the holy place. Even the Jews kept some of the Jews out and only the high priest. He's the only one and a prophet. They can go in there, but you can't. And God said, "This is ridiculous because I want everybody in my presence." &gt;&gt; And we are now allowed to go where no one else has gone before. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; He invited the lame, the deaf, the dumb, the rejected, the despised few. Come. I'll show them I'll show them a revelation they ain't never seen before. Tell them to come. Tell them to be a part of this celebration. Tell them to be part of this final work. Huh? Tell them to be part of this final move. Tell them to be a part of what I'm doing now. Tell them to turn a corner. &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Brandon used to say, "Anybody can build a brick wall." Which is not true cuz I can't. But you know what he means? He said, "Anybody can lay a brick wall." He said, "But it takes a real mason to turn a corner. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, you're going to have all kind of problems." He got to know exactly what he's doing. You got to have a real believer that knows how to turn the corner when God turns the corner. &gt;&gt; You got to have a real understanding of God's word to know when it's time to move with the pillar of fire &gt;&gt; because you can't get ahead of it. You can't get ahead of the cloud. You can't get ahead of the pillar of fire. I've had people tell me that and say, "Well, you need to slow down." And I could see where God slowed me down. I could see where God didn't let me go here. Didn't let me go there. All of a sudden, Brother Jack, the doors have swung open again. What is it? It's time to move on with the pillar of fire. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if I can just if you'll just let me stay humble. &gt;&gt; Little bride, stay humble. &gt;&gt; One of the seven seal nuggets that I'll speak on Sunday morning, Lord willing, one of the seven sealed nuggets I found either in the fifth seal and even in the sixth seal, there's a warning to stay little in your own sight. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; there's a warning for you to stay humble. They talked about that little that little girl that that worked at the rancher's house and and how the rancher son said, "If you'll wait just one year, you get yourself ready and I'll come back." And they made fun of her. And they teased her and she was lowly looking and and uh calmly looking. I guess that means ugly. I think it means just, you know, not all dolled up and fake and makeup and fraudulent. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; That's what I think it means. I think it means you have enough confidence in yourself. You don't have to use anything else to make up the difference. What's with the war paint anyway? Huh? &gt;&gt; All right, never mind. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I did that and I shouldn't have. That's politically incorrect. But I'm I'm I have a patch of blood, so I guess I'm all right. I told you, man. We're all mixed up. Look here what he said here. Uh, Brother R said he said, "Hold the four winds." Wait, wait, where was I going with that first? Let me finish that up. Oh, yeah. The rancher. Okay. And they said, "Why is he going to come back for you? Why would he love you? Why would he want you?" I don't know, but all I know is he said, "You ain't even heard from him. You don't You guys don't communicate. You don't text. You don't WhatsApp. You don't Skype. You don't FaceTime. Nothing. He has no social media. You ain't got none. How do you guys even talk? Do you guys call?" Nope. Never heard from him. Does he even send you a My dad the other day told me to look on Telegram and I thought he was just getting old. I didn't realize there's an app now called Telegram. Then I felt old. said, "How does my dad know what I don't know?" I don't My dad's telling me, "Get Telegram. Get Telegram." I said, "Dad, they don't have those anymore." Yes, they do. It's on my phone. I went, but in the seals, they are making fun of her and she hasn't answered. She goes, "It don't matter. It's almost the year's almost up." And she says these words, "I have five minutes yet." And brother Brand said at that same time she heard the wagon wheels. She looked down the road, saw the dust kicking up. Here he came like he had promised. &gt;&gt; I thought it was interesting because we uh we prayed for our food in Atlanta and I made a statement, brother Jack. I said, "Lord, would you help us get there just a little bit earlier?" I should have asked for an hour earlier because I know he had done it, but I said a little bit earlier. And our flight was to leave at 209. We get back to the desk and it said schedule 209 but actual I've never even seen this but actual departure is at 204. I go why don't you just change it to 204 but that's 5 minutes left. &gt;&gt; We landed five minutes early. &gt;&gt; And I thought to myself, man, if you would just let your servant see every little thing that you're using to build his faith. &gt;&gt; Remember that time we traveled together, Allie? And I I I said, Ally, I said, I'm going to start saying some things. I'm going to get into gear because I actually matter of fact we're on our way here and I said, "I got to get into uh gear. I hope you understand." He goes, "Well, yeah, we I think so." And I said, "Well, I'm going to tell you some things and I want you just to not question me. Just watch what happens." And so I looked over at a fell and I started talking to him and I looked at his boots and I go, "This guy's from Texas." And he goes, "Well, that's easy." He goes, "Yeah, but we're connecting." Because he's from Dallas. And he goes, "How do you know that?" I go, "Told not to ask me anything." I said, "Where are you connecting to?" He goes, "Dallas said, "Aren't you our pilot?" He goes, "How did you know that?" I said, "I told you not to ask me nothing. Just watch." So he does. And that sure enough, he's our pilot and he's he's stopping in Dallas and Boots and had nothing to do with this guy showing you something. We get on the plane and I said, "Somebody's sick." Remember that? And they hardly ever do this over the intercom. What happened? Uh, is there a doctor on the plane? We have somebody who's not feeling well. He may be having cardiac arrest. And Ellis goes, I go, "Just just don't say nothing. It's not me now. Just let me get this way." And he, uh, you're going to be in concord. I said, "No, they're going to switch it to this. We're going to have to go here, here, and here." We get there. Then the best one for last. We get in the little train. You're on the train. And I look to this lady and I go, "Are you you're a twin?" She goes, "What makes you say that?" And I go, "You're just like you were." She goes, "Well, um, no, but I'm about to have twins." And my sister's a twin, and this one's a twin. And this black lady goes, "That's the Holy Ghost." [Music] [Applause] That lady goes, "How did you do that?" And she goes, "I told you that's the Holy Spirit." I'm not kidding. All right, Ellie. She was doing like this and me and Ally were just looking at. She goes, "Woo!" She's going like that back and forth. She knew enough. She knew enough to recognize what that was. &gt;&gt; Then we came here and we had one of our meetings and we came with those four brothers. That time we come with you. And I said, "Man," he goes, "Why did you tell me that, brother Caleb?" I said, "I want you to if you're going to be close to me, I need you to see this stuff and don't ask me anything." I said, "I'm doing it to build my faith or let the Lord build it and yours, too." I said, "But it's mostly so I can just get stronger, you know, because it's time." And I said, "So, we're here in this hour and this is what's happening. Little things here and there and if Oh, well, what was that all about?" No, don't ask the Lord, "What was that about?" Say, "Thank you, Lord. I appreciate that little road mark. &gt;&gt; I appreciate that tie post. I appreciate you showing me and telling me not to leave now that this was going to happen. I appreciate you getting me ready. [Music] &gt;&gt; I appreciate you getting me ready for what was about to happen. Cuz God's not just going to send you out there unprepared. &gt;&gt; He's going to have you ready for every situation. &gt;&gt; There's going to come a time when you're going to lay your hands on somebody. I I I remember going through a place and telling somebody, "You don't feel good." Huh? I can tell they go, "How can you I just don't worry. You want me to lay my hand on you?" I remember doing it and they getting healed and then they want to try to find you. I said, "Come on, Ellie. Let's get out of here. I don't want to make a big deal out of it." &gt;&gt; But the body of Christ is going to have to learn how to just take it just a little a little bit of attention, but stay humble about it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's no big I's or little U's. &gt;&gt; We're all on the same team. &gt;&gt; I'm not greater than Brother Jack. And Brother Jack, you might be greater than me. I don't know. But I'm not greater than you. You're a better singer. I'll give you that. &gt;&gt; Right. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Let me wrap it up with this one here. He said, "Hold the four winds until," in other words, he said, "we seal the servants of God in their forehead." Look how God has been. You see, it says that that um we have to make ourselves ready, right? &gt;&gt; They tell us to watch and wait, look and pray so forth. But God is also long-suffering. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He don't want nobody to miss it. Right? &gt;&gt; It isn't that anybody is. We just we're a little bit slow sometimes at picking things up. &gt;&gt; You ever see something happen and you're like, "Why didn't I see that?" &gt;&gt; You should have. &gt;&gt; We seal the servants of God. The servants, the Jews, John turned and said, "I seen 144,000 sealed away." He goes on like that. He said, "Some come in one hour at 1 hour, another hour, and some another hour." And as they was 11th hour people, the 11th hour people now who you who are spiritual, read between the lines because I've got to jump here in a hurry. Come in the 11th hour people. And right now, the first come in and receive the penny. And the next come in and receive the penny. And the 11th hour people got the same pity that they did at the first. Is that right? The 11th hour. Now watch. He just starts talking on and on and on. That's a mile post. He talks about the first world war one and all this. And he goes down. He said he's going to receive the same baptism. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Of the Holy Ghost that they got back at the beginning back there in Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Now I want to show you something here. He says back there at Pentecost, I believe he's referring back to Isuza Street, right? But if we're spiritual, it doesn't go just that far back. It goes all the way back to the upper room &gt;&gt; because that's where Pentecost started. &gt;&gt; Pentecost be became an organization and and what you got now, the evidence of speaking the uh speaking in tongues and so forth. That's not the evidence. It is unevidence. But you look, I had somebody get up one time and they said, "Uh, speaking in tongues is fine, but that's not it." Okay, you're right. But the shame of it is this. &gt;&gt; We're supposed to have all nine spiritual gifts &gt;&gt; working in the church. &gt;&gt; And if we don't got the least, &gt;&gt; so can we at least get the least &gt;&gt; before you kick it out? &gt;&gt; Can we get a little bit of that? And the rest and the other eight gifts too &gt;&gt; before you kick out this one. [Music] &gt;&gt; I remember him saying, "Well, I spoke in tongues, but I Anybody can do that really. &gt;&gt; If you haven't spoken tongues, don't worry about it. It's not required. &gt;&gt; That's the right way to say it. &gt;&gt; It's in evidence, but it's not required." &gt;&gt; You know what is required? A life change. &gt;&gt; Servitude. selling out, repenting, being baptized in the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; These are requirements. &gt;&gt; Foot washing and communion. &gt;&gt; These are requirements, &gt;&gt; right? These are things you've got to do. &gt;&gt; Well, but you're you're not supposed to prove God by works. No. By your works, you won't, but also by the works of your faith, you will prove God. &gt;&gt; That's not your works. That's faith works. &gt;&gt; Faith works is a whole different thing. &gt;&gt; Come on. I'm just dropping some seeds. Everybody say an amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said he's going to receive the same bapt Holy Ghost. He go back there at Pentecost. It's not going just to Pentecost and Suz Street. We're talking in the upper room experience be baptized the same way and everything. The 11th hour of people moving in and what I'm seeing at my little temp at our little temple. I'm talk I'm trying to change the way I talk. It's not my church. It's our church. &gt;&gt; I'm not the only minister pastor there. We got pastors. And I got to remember that we had a time where people were fussing and fighting over certain things and certain pieces of equipment. I thought to myself, man, I don't even own the pulpit. I don't even I don't even you know what do you call it? Uh the I'm not greedy with it. Why should you all be greedy with everything else? &gt;&gt; So I got to live by example. Is that right? &gt;&gt; All right. I think I'm going to just finish up with that. Be all right. We are the 11th hour people. That's who we are. If you believe that, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "Here, hold it till we seal the servants, not the bride. The Gentile never was a servant. We are sons and daughters." &gt;&gt; Oh, that should have made you happy. &gt;&gt; I'm not a servant. I am a son and or a daughter. &gt;&gt; Abraham was God's servant. Hallelujah. Now, thousands times thousands, thousands of Jews, God's got them all in there. He started talking about Muslim Stalin. He goes all the way back there. But see, I'm looking at something different here. And I want you to understand what I'm saying. I'm not trying to knock what he's saying. And I'm trying to read what he's saying and show you what it is. He said here, "Hold the four winds. Don't let the world be destroyed until we seal the servants of our God in their forehead." That's been nigh to 50 years ago when the Holy Ghost has come from the east fell upon the people and the Pentecostal as the streets and so forth started. Now what is going to happen? They have to hold it. Don't destroy the whole earth. Do you see why we're still here? because we're waiting on them. We're waiting on you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God, &gt;&gt; there's a threat now, right? There's a threat. Russia wasn't a threat for the longest time, was it? &gt;&gt; No. And all of a sudden, we're real nervous because they're moving satellites and oddly right above the United States. &gt;&gt; What are they doing that for? &gt;&gt; Well, because a prophet of God said one day they'll go up there with a nuclear bomb. They'll bring the American country to her knees, the United States to her knees. that'll make her surrender. Either you do what we tell you or and then brother Brandon goes on to say this, but don't you worry. Before the first bomb ever hits the ground, you and I will be shaking hands with our brothers and sisters in glory. &gt;&gt; We're here now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Russia's moving in. That war ain't going to stop. Israel started fighting. That ain't going to stop. We got a pope out of America. Oh, I love this argument. Oh, I I I agree. It could be a type, but I don't think it said Well, yeah, you're you're right, brother, because popes come out of America all the time. &gt;&gt; This person is not just out of America. He was born a United States citizen. &gt;&gt; The same year that Brother Brandham said that &gt;&gt; on the same border of where brother Brandham lived. &gt;&gt; So, while Brother Brandham's saying this, this little guy's going goooo gaga. Come on. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's just a coincidence. I don't think it's that. &gt;&gt; Well, you go ahead then. &gt;&gt; You go ahead. That's the problem with prophecy, though, is people want to judge a prophet. Just let it come to pass. &gt;&gt; The Bible says so. No one can judge a prophet's word. A prophecy you bring before two or three. But a prophet, you just leave that thing alone. &gt;&gt; Well, you said, you said, "No, no, no. I said, thus say the Lord, leave that thing alone." I mean, how many times have we said something in the name of the Lord and it didn't happen when when people thought it should happen. But if they just wait a little bit longer, it takes place just like he said. &gt;&gt; Same thing with brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; Now, what is going to happen? They have to hold it. Don't destroy the whole earth because it couldn't have done it then. Anyhow, anyhow, but now they got he said regular bomb. He made nuclear bomb that'll destroy the whole earth. That's right. Hold it until what? until we have sealed in in their foreheads the servants of God. &gt;&gt; We're here now. Just think the great Holy Spirit come identifying Jesus Christ alive after 2,000 years. See the very nature of him doing the same thing as he promised it would be done. That's right. I'm so grateful for you, &gt;&gt; friends. You're that 11th hour people standing here. [Music] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said, "I'm so grateful for you. &gt;&gt; You are the 11th hour working people standing here." &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Well, he buried my sin in the depth of the sea. &gt;&gt; He carried my guilt far away. And as far as the east is from the west, he removed my transgressions from me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now I sing of his mercy and tell of his love and I sing of his liberty and I live in the awesome light of his love because I know that I am free. &gt;&gt; Free to do what? to tell the people I am an 11th hour worker. The coming of the Lord is not coming, it's here. The bride knows who she is. She is the foolish virgin has awakened and so has the wise. The wise has already trimmed her and accepted God's word. Watch it and see if it ain't so. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; We won't be here much longer. &gt;&gt; Well, then I guess we don't need to fight it, church. No, you just keep on doing what you're doing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't you stop for nothing. &gt;&gt; You go ahead and make an addition. You go ahead and buy a church. &gt;&gt; You go ahead and get people to come. You just keep coming and coming and coming. But remember, don't get used to it. I don't care how pretty it is, how good it looks. This world is not my home. I'm just a passing through. &gt;&gt; My treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue. The angels beckoning me from heaven's open door. You know, I'll tell you something else. The believers that have gone on are beckoning me. Come on, Caleb. Get us out of this grave. &gt;&gt; And I can't feel that old in this world anymore. Come on, musicians. Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like you. And if heaven's not my home, then Lord, what will I do? &gt;&gt; Oh, if heaven's not my home, then Lord, what will I do? &gt;&gt; Jesus. Wow. &gt;&gt; All I know is I can't feel at all in this world anymore. &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm grateful for you, friends. You're that 11th hour work. You're that 11th hour people standing here just getting in. I'm so glad you come. Each one of you remember it was God who told you to come." &gt;&gt; Humanly, you wouldn't have done it. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; But God told you to come. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Now while these brethren these brethren here and I'm praying he goes on he asked the people to pray. Isn't that powerful? Humanly you would not have come. I told the church that last Sunday and I didn't even realize he'd said that. You know I think we do subconsciously. We know it you know by by spirit. And you say I didn't even know he said that. I think we did know but I didn't know. You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; But that's what happened last Sunday. I go you you say well I'm here because so and so invited me. No that's not why you're here. You're here because God used somebody to ask you to come. &gt;&gt; God gave you the uncction to jump a fence. &gt;&gt; It was really sweet. I think actually, matter of fact, Brother Jesse's one of your last official acts as a youth pastor. What a way to go out too, huh? Young young man walked in there. I don't even know him. I never even seen him. I happened to be here or there. You know how it is. And he comes in and I say, "How you doing? How you doing, son? What's up?" "What's up, bud?" He goes, "Can I get baptized?" I said, "Sure." When? He goes, "Now?" Oh, well, Jesse, he was he was before Nathan took over. He goes I go, "Well, youth pastor suited up because the youth." He walks out of there. I go, "We've got one baptism. Stop everybody from leaving." Half the church had already gone on. I said, "Stop everybody from leaving so we can get people in there to baptize. You know, we we need witnesses." Here comes another one. Here comes another one. Here comes another one. Here comes another one. By the time we're done, we got six young people getting baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jess is just standing in the water getting all, you know, pruny looking. And I said, "Man, we need seven." And brother Jeff said, "You know what? I need to rededicate my life to the Lord." He took off his shoes, Brother Jack, and his suit and everything. Got in the water, said, "Brother Jesse, baptize me one more time." &gt;&gt; Seven. &gt;&gt; That's just as good as his first one. But sometimes you just need to I don't know what I call it, Brother Jack, is a reset button. &gt;&gt; I just want to start over, &gt;&gt; right? God recognizes whatever he recognizes. But just say, you know, just for my own sake, I want to just feel, but it was nice. I can't believe you ruined that suit. &gt;&gt; It's not ruined. Don't get mad. I'm glad it's not ruined. But we had seven. &gt;&gt; That was his last official act there. And I go, "What a way to go out." And it was nice because I'm walking back to the office and the Lord said, "I just want you to see what I thought of your ministry." &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Don't worry what other people think or say. You just keep on going. &gt;&gt; Amen. You just keep on asking. You just keep on searching. I'll show you how to get there. &gt;&gt; Man, if he was good enough to show us where he started, where we started, &gt;&gt; then he then I know that he's going to be faithful in us to get us all the way there. &gt;&gt; I have no doubt anymore. &gt;&gt; I told I told our home church this. I said it like this. I go, I don't have to believe I'm going to make it. I know I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you know the difference? I can. Do you all know the difference? &gt;&gt; But you can't just say it if you don't know. You got to know. You know, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; See, brother Caleb has been this a while. Brother Jack, I believe you you you must know. &gt;&gt; Say, well, yeah, but it says have faith and believe. Yeah, you have faith and believe until you know, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You see, we waited so many years for Nadine to be born, and I had to believe and have faith for that. But then when she was born, I didn't have to have faith and believe anymore. &gt;&gt; I know she's here. &gt;&gt; Now, let me ask you a question. If I stop believing and having faith for Nadine, is she going to disappear? No, &gt;&gt; she's here whether I have faith or believe anyway. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; So if I'm in heaven, I got to faith and believe till I get to heaven. If I get to heaven, I stop having faith and believe and I'm going to fall out. &gt;&gt; No, I'm there. So there's going to come a point in your life where you don't there's certain things now I still have to have faith and believe for other things like money, you know, uh faith and believe that if I go jogging, I'm going to be able to jog and come back without, you know, falling over or something, you know. &gt;&gt; But as far as getting to heaven, &gt;&gt; I don't have to have faith and belief for that at all. &gt;&gt; I know I'm going to make it. &gt;&gt; Oh, he said, "I'm going to make it." He already said I would, right? He said, God said, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And there's nothing that's ever going to be able to take that away from me. &gt;&gt; I don't care if I have to stand by myself and preach to an empty room. I still know I'm going when he comes. &gt;&gt; We must be that people. &gt;&gt; You have to know your bride. I know brother said, "Nobody knows and all this." Well, maybe then nobody knew. Brother Jack, you know, in the scriptures, uh, 1 Corinthians 9, oh man, here we go again. 1 Corinthians. Well, I know it's verse 9 and 10. I keep thinking, forget about the chapter, but it says, "Eye has not seen, ear is not heard, what is recorded, even recorded in God's word, what he has in store for them." &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. And everybody stops there, don't they? &gt;&gt; Most preachers just stop there. &gt;&gt; They don't say no more than that. And they and they use it as a as a copout. You see, weren't you sitting there earlier? Y'all switched. That's nice. But then he goes, you know, Peter, my eye has not seen, ears not heard. I'm like, well, maybe you haven't seen, &gt;&gt; maybe you haven't heard. &gt;&gt; But if you continue just a little bit further in verse 10, it said, "But it has been revealed to us by his spirit." &gt;&gt; So maybe you didn't know you were bride, but in this day and age, there's got to be just a little bit more than believing. I know &gt;&gt; who I am. &gt;&gt; How are you? Well, that's kind of like an oxymoron. The bride, no one knows who bride is. Well, then why did brother Bran say when the bride recognizes who she is? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Do you know who you are? &gt;&gt; No question about it. &gt;&gt; All the confidence in the world. &gt;&gt; Can anybody talk you out of it? &gt;&gt; Did anybody talk you into it? &gt;&gt; Then that's all there is to it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Jack, would you come? [Applause] &gt;&gt; More of you. &gt;&gt; Just more of you. [Music] &gt;&gt; I've had it all. But what I need is more of you. [Music] You got to help me with that one. &gt;&gt; Had my feel [Music] &gt;&gt; yet I hunger still. &gt;&gt; Oh, and bear hunger. &gt;&gt; More of you. Praise the Lord. That one. I'm sorry. I don't know. Uh I'mma give you [Music] I just um wanted to um mention that I I thank the Lord for the word on tonight. Um this 11th hour worker that um Brother Caleb is bringing to our attention. I think we've we've read the scripture uh for years. We we we have many quotes for brother Brandham. Even he read it tonight where brother Random identified us at the as that 11th hour worker. But when you experiencing something at your church where you got people jumping your fence, um, don't look like everybody else, don't dress like everybody else, but yet they jump in your fence trying to get into your church, then you begin to look at things a little differently, &gt;&gt; right? And and and you know, I I think for me, I think that's a good problem to have. And if you know anything about the area that um out in, you know, Tucson and everything, I I know of churches where even believers can't even get on the property at certain times. Hallelujah. And the ones from Tucson know all about it. If even if you're a believer, you not getting in that church. Now, you can imagine if a unbeliever show up Oo my goodness. But yet the Lord is sending them. And I I have to say this. I thank God for who he made brother how he made brother Caleb and who he made brother Caleb because the people have to have somewhere they can go. &gt;&gt; Amen. And they can get the word of the Lord. And and and I've learned this as well when when new people are coming into the house of the Lord. Um don't give them all the dos and don'ts. Don't don't don't don't start with this and don't do this and don't then you'll be one of us if you don't do this. If the Holy Ghost don't make them stop doing that then all we're doing is is is making them conform to to our standards. And brother Brandham said you can't make Christians by conformity. Not like that. It's got to be something that happens on the inside. And our job is just to preach it and then let God just do take care of the rest. So I thank the Lord for this, brother. I appreciate, Amen. how the Lord is brought this to our attention tonight. Thank you for sharing. I know that I can make it. I know that I can stand. Why don't y'all help me sing it? Stand to your feet. may come my way. My life is in your hands. Come on. I know that I can make it. Know that I can make it. And I know no matter matter what may come my way. Oh my life. You don't have to worry. You don't have to worry. Don't you be afraid. For joy comes in the morning. Troubles don't last always. For there's a friend in Jesus who will wipe your tears away. When your heart is broken, hold your hands and say, "Yes, I know that I can make it." No matter what my life [Music] with Jesus I can take with you. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] No matter what, no matter [Music] what I'm going through. Yeah, I know I'm going to make it. No sickness is going to stop me. No matter what my life is, my life is my life is my life is I know it is my life is my life is [Applause] hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Blessed be the name of the Lord. You know, Brother Caleb was finishing the sermon and he made mention of six people being baptized. And he says, "No, six ain't the right number. It's got to be seven. It's got to be seven." and brother Jeff uh decided that he wanted to be baptized and just rededicate his life. And I'm glad that he spoke that because we had a young brother do the same thing here. And uh and after he did that, uh the Lord filled him with the Holy Ghost. So it was just a confirmation. Amen. And you know and and if there's you know anybody when you hear things like that and you hear what God is doing if there's anybody ever come to a spot like well you know what I want to do the same thing I want to rededicate my life. We we need to be sure certain &gt;&gt; that there's nothing between us and God &gt;&gt; right and u so I I encourage if you want to do that then you just get in touch and let's make arrangements so we can get you baptized. Amen. Sometimes the, you know, the devil will try to fight you in areas like that, but um, you know, I don't want nobody to say, "No, no, no, no. Let people be a witness of what God is doing in your life." Right? But I tell you, we've had two, we just heard two different testimonies from different sides of the United States. &gt;&gt; But God is calling his people. Amen. God is calling his people. Be sensitive to the voice of the Lord. Amen. God bless you. Let us have a word of prayer. Amen. Um just remind you that service on Sunday morning uh starts at 9:30. Amen. Service starts at 9:30. Uh we are sharing this facility with another church. So they come in after us on Sunday morning. So we'll have to come in and Amen. and and do uh what we do and and allow them to be able to come in and have the sanctuary. So uh but 9:30 is when we'll start. Amen. Uh the the doors will be open by 8:30. Amen. For time of prayer and things like that, but uh the service itself will start right at 9:30. So keep that in mind. Also, um I had made arrangements to at least have a restaurant that would serve us uh after service. We made arrangements for IHOP here on um Forest Hill and uh Jog area. So we want the Saints just to have a little fellowship. And if uh anybody want to join, feel free to do so. Amen. We'll be going there following the service. Let's just bow in a word of prayer. Father, we thank you, Lord Jesus, for your word that has been spoken uh to our hearts. Lord, we um just what amazing Grace Temple is experiencing all these different ones coming there. Thank you, Lord, that you've given brother Caleb wisdom to work with the people in the condition in which they are. Uh I trust Lord Jesus, God, that as the word is coming to them, it will continue to take them further. And Lord Jesus, we uh we want to be mindful of how you might send different ones here in our uh direction. We want to be sensitive to what the spirit of the Lord is doing in our midst. Be watchful, Father, those that have been invited to come from the the hedges, the highways, the byways, Lord, to feel the table of the Lord. God, we ask that you would just make us sensitive to what the spirit is doing in this hour. Lord, as we prepare to leave this place but not your presence, may the spirit of God go before us and Lord, just bless, amen, our time of fellowship. And Lord, as the saints would just go about on tomorrow, we ask that you would bless and Amen. all that they would do, Father. And just trust, Lord Jesus, that you would keep us until we're able to come back together again uh on Sunday morning. May the spirit of the Lord meet us, Father, in only way that you can. We give you all the glory. We give you all the honor. We give you all the praise in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Amen. You can be seated. The brothers will come. Amen. At this time we'll dismiss you. Amen. God bless you. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Yeah. Heat. [Music]
