[3:12] nor standeth in the way of Sinners or

[3:18] but his Delight is in the law of the
[3:20] Lord and his law doth he meditate day
[3:23] and night and he shall be be like a tree
[3:26] planted by the rivers of water that
[3:29] bringeth forth his food in his season
[3:31] his Leaf also shall not wither and
[3:35] whatsoever he doeth shall prosper the
[3:38] ungodly are not so but I like the chaff
[3:41] which the wind driveth away therefore

[42:05] I think that just the the probably the
[42:08] best thing you could ever do is just go
[42:10] into the new year praising God
[42:13] I think that's just the best thing you
[42:14] can do other folk want to go to parties
[42:16] and all kind of stuff like that but we
[42:18] want to go to church
[42:19] amen we want to just Usher in the year

[42:31] ready on the screen that for me first
[42:32] chronicles 16 uh but before I read that
[42:35] uh Verse 18 is what I'm going to start
[42:37] from
[42:38] um before I read that I did want to just
[42:41] just thank God for a couple things that
[42:43] has happened uh this week we had a
[42:46] couple saints that were in the hospital

[43:16] were waiting to do a special test for
[43:18] him but they needed his his uh his
[43:20] levels to come down to stabilize and um

[43:42] that they gonna do the test Wednesday
[43:45] and uh and that they were trying to get
[43:47] him released from the hospital and
[43:50] everything so I thank God for just

[43:55] brother and just stabilizing him also
[43:57] Brother Joseph went through a man of
[44:00] tremendous surgery there but I've been
[44:02] getting all the updates and the pictures
[44:03] and you know and I think if the right
[44:06] people was in the right place he'd be
[44:07] home right now
[44:10] uh but uh but but the Lord has him there
[44:12] but he's doing so much he's doing so
[44:14] much better and um I mean when I went uh
[44:18] there to see him before I left and I was
[44:20] just just feeling my heart just going
[44:22] out for him but I see him up and doing
[44:24] his things that he normally does and say
[44:26] well we can't wait to have him back in
[44:28] church amen that right before he went in
[44:31] uh we went down there brother Diggs that
[44:33] come here and we went down to Boynton
[44:34] and we were in service and Brother
[44:37] Joseph was sitting kind of in the middle
[44:39] section of the church and my brother did
[44:42] exactly preaching and he'd start running
[44:44] down the aisle like we used to do when
[44:46] we was you know going to the meetings
[44:48] and everything even at brother Wesco
[44:50] church we come from the back running
[44:51] down the aisle amen
[44:54] I mean well we had church and brother I
[44:57] saw Brother Joseph doing that the next
[44:59] thing you know I looked in the audience
[45:00] and I saw two other young men that had
[45:02] got uh uh it became contagious and these
[45:07] two young men looked at him said I think
[45:09] they were saying itself if he can do it
[45:11] praise God I can do it
[45:14] and I start seeing them coming out in
[45:16] the aisle amen
[45:18] Glory train them up the way they should
[45:20] go because when they get old they won't
[45:23] depart from it
[45:25] but I say praise God you know I said the
[45:28] devil don't like this young man for some
[45:30] reason but but uh God loves him amen and

[46:28] the effects of a changing culture a
[46:30] wonderful wonderful sermon
[46:32] uh just really really appreciate that
[46:35] and I think it's very timely you know
[46:37] for us to understand Satan is just just
[46:40] throwing everything he can at us and we
[46:43] have to withstand what he's doing don't
[46:45] get caught up in the politics
[46:48] don't get caught it's it you know the
[46:50] political realm is controlled by the
[46:52] devil
[46:54] yeah yeah if you don't believe that go
[46:56] back and read Luke 4. where Jesus was
[46:59] told by the devil if you bow down to me
[47:02] I'll give you all these kingdoms the
[47:05] devil is over every government
[47:08] so don't get caught up in that right and
[47:11] you know just all the stuff floating
[47:13] social media you gotta withstand
[47:15] withstand you know Discerning withstand
[47:18] is what the prophets say you got to
[47:19] discern it and withstand it we don't
[47:21] need to be caught up in all of that
[47:22] we're Christians praise God Amen but I
[47:26] appreciate that sermon Amen brother Troy
[47:28] God bless you uh for that amen and um I
[47:32] believe brother Solomon mentioned this
[47:34] little Warriors talking about the
[47:35] devotions we're starting a brand new
[47:37] year
[47:38] and um some of you all I'm not sure if
[47:41] you're aware but we we do have a church
[47:43] app uh where you can kind of go back
[47:46] listen to some of the sermons that we
[47:48] had uh and then also in that church app
[47:50] is a one-year Bible reading program
[47:54] um and um uh I am one of the things that
[47:57] that the Lord put in my just he he
[48:01] called me to it years ago it's been well
[48:04] over 20 years uh that I've read through
[48:08] the Bible every year and I still do it
[48:10] and uh and I want to invite you to come
[48:13] along the journey with me amen this year
[48:16] uh but uh years ago I was I was there at
[48:20] my house and I was picking up my
[48:22] newspaper I wanted to read the sports
[48:25] page just to kind of see what was uh
[48:27] what what had happened in sports and um
[48:30] and I heard the voice of the Lord say if
[48:33] you read your Bible as faithful as you
[48:36] read that newspaper you'd be much
[48:38] further up the road
[48:40] and uh when I heard that I I kind of
[48:43] looked around I said I know that wasn't
[48:45] the devil telling me to read the Bible
[48:48] they would try to put me to sleep when I
[48:50] read the Bible but I know that when the
[48:52] devil said that was the voice of God and
[48:56] I said okay so at that on that day I
[49:00] found a one-year Bible reading plan I
[49:02] started reading on that day it wasn't
[49:04] January 1st I don't know what day it was
[49:06] but when I heard it I responded and I
[49:09] just started reading going through the
[49:10] Bible you know One Year Bible reading
[49:12] plan so I've you know just kind of did
[49:15] different ones over the years and the
[49:17] one that we used in a church app is the
[49:18] one that I found that was just very
[49:20] effective for kind of keeping you
[49:22] engaged amen as you go through the
[49:24] scripture so uh on the app a man we want
[49:27] to encourage you
[49:29] um um you know just just get the app and
[49:31] you can actually just go through day by
[49:33] day and just read you know the Bible
[49:34] reading plan uh not only do we do that
[49:36] but there are other churches that got a
[49:38] little text yesterday from brother Larry
[49:40] Nichols up up in South Carolina I mean
[49:42] North Carolina it says brother Jack did
[49:44] it again this year
[49:46] and I think this has been his second
[49:47] year in a row so he's starting all over
[49:49] again amen today Amen in 2023 so I want
[49:53] to invite you to join us on the journey
[49:55] the way that you get closer to God Is by
[49:57] reading your Bible and praying
[50:01] come on somebody
[50:02] read your Bible and pray if you want to
[50:06] withstand
[50:08] right the stuff that's happening in our
[50:10] culture day you're gonna have to be able
[50:11] to read the Bible and see what the Bible
[50:13] say and look I don't care I know man
[50:15] changes but God don't change
[50:17] God don't change right so we're going to
[50:20] stay what what's what's I mean let's
[50:22] stay stand with something that's
[50:23] unchangeable and uh and that's the word
[50:25] of God so I want to encourage you let's
[50:27] get started again this year reading our
[50:29] Bible and drawing closer uh to the Lord
[50:32] amen we are we're one year closer one
[50:35] day closer one hour closer one minute
[50:37] closer to the coming of the lord we must
[50:40] be ready for his coming I don't want to
[50:42] draw further away from God Amen I want
[50:44] to draw closer to God draw me nearer
[50:47] nearer blessed Lord to the Cross without
[50:50] his diet Amen Let me just read this
[50:53] scripture for you I I uh my daughter had
[50:56] told me
[50:57] something she said dad last year you had
[51:00] made a statement says you said you
[51:02] believe God was going to provide us with
[51:05] our church in 2022 you believe that and
[51:08] um you know uh so I want to come up on
[51:11] the first day of 2023 and I want to
[51:13] State my faith again
[51:15] I believe God can provide us a church
[51:18] this year
[51:20] imma state it again and and I'm gonna
[51:23] keep stating it until I walk into my
[51:25] manifestation
[51:26] amen but this was something that was
[51:28] given to me uh I just looked on it and
[51:32] we didn't date it and I think there
[51:33] might be a reason uh God didn't want us
[51:35] to date it but it's something it's an
[51:37] eternal word that we can hold on to my
[51:39] mother-in-law gave this to me and she
[51:41] was reading uh uh her Bible see you can
[51:44] you can get inspired by reading the word
[51:46] and what I want to do is I like to just
[51:49] take my spam
[51:51] on the word of God
[51:54] man you know that it's more sure than
[51:57] anything you got that you get you can
[52:00] stand on what God Said
[52:02] so as we start the year off I want to
[52:04] just read to you something that God said
[52:06] and and I'm glad my mother-in-law she
[52:09] was there she says reading the Bible and
[52:11] just like the Lord just beginning to
[52:12] Quicken this to her as she was reading
[52:14] the scripture I can stand on that come
[52:17] on somebody I thank God for dreams and
[52:20] things like that but when I get it in
[52:21] the word
[52:23] I got something I can I can anchor
[52:26] myself to because though I mean heavens
[52:28] and earth have passed away but that word
[52:29] will never pass but here in first
[52:31] chronicles 16 Verse 18 the Bible says
[52:34] this
[52:35] is unto thee
[52:39] uh versus saying unto thee will I give
[52:43] the land of Canaan the lot of your
[52:46] inheritance
[52:48] uh when ye were but few even a few and
[52:51] strangers in it
[52:53] and when they went from Nation to nation
[52:55] and from one Kingdom to another people
[52:58] he suffered no man to do them wrong yeah
[53:00] he reproved Kings for their sakes
[53:03] sin touched not mine anoint him and do
[53:05] my Prophets
[53:07] no harm
[53:08] amen it says Sing unto the Lord all the
[53:11] Earth show forth from day to day his
[53:13] salvation now uh what happened go back
[53:16] to verse 18 because what happened is as
[53:19] as my my mother-in-law sister Cobb amen
[53:22] she was reading this uh just the spirit
[53:24] of the Lord just began to speak to her
[53:26] uh through the through the word and and
[53:28] so let's read that verse again saying
[53:31] verse 18 saying unto thee will I give
[53:35] the land of Canaan and she put your own
[53:38] church
[53:42] but that's what the Lord spoke to her uh
[53:45] the land of Canaan in your own church
[53:47] amen the lot and she said the portion of
[53:51] your inheritance
[53:52] when ye were but a few not a lot of
[53:55] members
[53:57] even a few and strangers in it and when
[54:00] they went from Nation to Nation as you
[54:02] said from location to location
[54:05] and from one Kingdom to another people
[54:06] he suffered no man to do them wrong yea
[54:09] he reproved Kings for their sake saying
[54:12] touched not mine anointed and do my
[54:15] prophets no harm sing unto the Lord all
[54:18] the Earth show forth from day to day his
[54:21] salvation and she signed it
[54:25] God's Got Us
[54:28] if he had Israel
[54:31] he's got us
[54:34] blessed be the name of the Lord
[54:37] so I just wanted to read that I think it
[54:40] was very important that we you know just
[54:41] established where our faith is and we
[54:44] are trusting the Lord and just but just
[54:46] holding on to God that he will provide
[54:49] amen just as he did for Israel he's he's
[54:53] the same yesterday today and forever
[54:54] amen amen amen amen all right
[54:58] um
[54:59] so I don't want to hold too much I do
[55:02] want to uh at the end of our service
[55:04] today I want to just read a blessing
[55:07] over you and I'll do that

[1:02:08] Second Corinthians it says Joshua and
[1:02:11] Joshua Rose early in the morning
[1:02:14] and they removed from sidom and came to
[1:02:19] Jordan he and all the children of Israel
[1:02:22] and Lodge there before they passed over
[1:02:25] and it came to pass after three days
[1:02:27] that the officers went through the host
[1:02:30] and they commanded the people saying
[1:02:33] when ye see the Ark of the Covenant of
[1:02:36] the lord your your God and the priests
[1:02:39] and the Levi's bearing it
[1:02:41] then you shall remove from your place
[1:02:44] and go after yet there shall be a space
[1:02:48] between you in it about 2 000 cubits by
[1:02:52] measure come not near unto it that you
[1:02:55] may know the way by which you must go
[1:02:58] for ye have not passed this way uh here
[1:03:01] the two uh hear the two four and Joshua
[1:03:05] said unto the people
[1:03:06] sanctify yourselves for tomorrow Lord
[1:03:09] will do wonders amongst you all right
[1:03:12] now let us go to uh
[1:03:16] uh Second Corinthians
[1:03:21] I noticed just seemed like two random
[1:03:24] scriptures to put together but
[1:03:28] we're gonna work on it this morning
[1:03:32] um it says in the ninth verse
[1:03:35] and he said unto me Grace my grace is
[1:03:38] sufficient for thee for my strength is
[1:03:41] made perfect in weakness most gladly
[1:03:44] therefore will I rather glory in my
[1:03:46] infirmities that the power of Christ May
[1:03:48] rest upon me amen let's just buy a hit
[1:03:52] gracious father we just thank you and we
[1:03:54] praise your God this morning for just
[1:03:57] allowing us this opportunity to be in
[1:03:59] the service of the Living God this
[1:04:01] morning and we're just trusting and
[1:04:03] depending on you Lord to give us
[1:04:06] Direction and unction and we appreciate
[1:04:09] you for all things when it's said it all
[1:04:12] said and done may you get the glory and
[1:04:15] honor out of it in Jesus name pray amen
[1:04:17] amen you may be seated this morning
[1:04:21] um I would just like to use as a topic
[1:04:24] this morning uh Grace sufficient for
[1:04:27] this day all right and uh
[1:04:31] maybe as a context I'm gonna use brother
[1:04:35] Troy his message uh uh withstanding
[1:04:39] cultural influence
[1:04:41] and uh we like we say we appreciate the
[1:04:45] holy spirit for
[1:04:47] God bless you brother kwaku it's good to
[1:04:49] have him back but with us all Soul trust
[1:04:52] that he had a blessed uh a couple of
[1:04:54] services over in Colombia
[1:04:57] um we we just want to give God thanks
[1:05:00] and praise for allowing us to see uh
[1:05:02] just another year uh a year that no
[1:05:06] doubt was filled with with uh trials and
[1:05:10] tests on every hand but we we got to
[1:05:13] give God thanks a praise for his grace
[1:05:16] is that right you know something that we
[1:05:19] probably don't deserve half of the time
[1:05:22] but we just thank God that we we serve a
[1:05:25] a risen savior a sovereign God a you
[1:05:29] know a compassionate God a loving God
[1:05:32] you know because you know we what we
[1:05:36] think we are
[1:05:38] y'all ain't gonna be quiet on me already
[1:05:39] I'm just getting started uh we sometimes
[1:05:43] what we think we are as Christians and
[1:05:45] and we we full of mistakes and and we we
[1:05:48] we we do different things but you know
[1:05:51] what one thing I'm grateful that God
[1:05:53] don't look at those things
[1:05:55] God don't see our shortcomings God don't
[1:05:58] see the mistakes that we make God only
[1:06:01] focuses on his word yeah yeah now we
[1:06:05] focus on our mistakes and the errors
[1:06:07] that we make and and and you know the
[1:06:10] the battles that that we might lose we
[1:06:13] you lose battles but you don't lose the
[1:06:16] war we have listen at the end of the day
[1:06:18] we're never going to lose this war
[1:06:21] right we might lose a battle here is
[1:06:23] there we might do something and and
[1:06:25] might you know feel a little conviction
[1:06:28] uh that's another message I want to
[1:06:30] preach but not today uh but but you know
[1:06:33] what we we're not going to lose the war
[1:06:36] um looking at the scripture in the Book
[1:06:38] of Joshua just to kind of uh get started
[1:06:42] uh we we know the children of Israel uh
[1:06:46] are were called out by promise
[1:06:49] amen they had come out
[1:06:52] um and Redemption is in two parts is
[1:06:55] that right uh you're not fully redeemed
[1:06:58] unless you come out and you go into
[1:07:00] Christ right right is that right not not
[1:07:04] a handshake
[1:07:06] you know uh some affiliation right some
[1:07:10] Association that's not Redemption
[1:07:12] Redemption is you gotta come out
[1:07:15] right he the call come out and then go
[1:07:19] into the promise right and and what we
[1:07:23] find it that the children of Israel they
[1:07:25] had come out but they hadn't gone in yet
[1:07:28] is that right uh uh a lot of the people
[1:07:32] that had come out you know uh originally
[1:07:35] with with Moses under the ministry of
[1:07:39] the word for that day a lot of those
[1:07:41] people who perish because of because of
[1:07:45] unbelief is that right now we going
[1:07:47] somewhere but but uh uh here here we
[1:07:51] find that that it was it they had come
[1:07:56] to a junction where where you know uh I
[1:08:00] I like to say this because sometimes you
[1:08:02] hear people talk about you know uh
[1:08:05] there's nothing moving and there's
[1:08:07] nothing going on I don't believe stuff
[1:08:09] like that
[1:08:10] uh even even when you look at the
[1:08:12] children of Israel they were constantly
[1:08:15] on a journey
[1:08:16] right they were constantly on the
[1:08:18] journey and and being on the journey
[1:08:21] just some people didn't make it into the
[1:08:24] fullness of the promise but they weren't
[1:08:27] a people that were standing still
[1:08:29] they they might have been going around
[1:08:31] in circles and eventually God had to
[1:08:34] tell them let's let's go Northwood but
[1:08:37] um here here we find out I just want to
[1:08:39] focus on this for a few minutes because
[1:08:41] of the the hour that we're living in we
[1:08:44] we realized something church this
[1:08:47] morning we we've we've come out of of
[1:08:50] one year
[1:08:52] right amen no matter how many circles we
[1:08:55] probably ran in
[1:08:57] how many things we did on a continuous
[1:09:00] basis but but you know what there was a
[1:09:04] change getting ready to take place and
[1:09:06] I'm I'm gonna drop something that I
[1:09:08] think that's going to be key for us Amen
[1:09:11] in this upcoming year
[1:09:13] right
[1:09:15] um one of the things we find it's
[1:09:17] important to follow instructions
[1:09:20] one of the problems I I think we we have
[1:09:24] with Christianity and we're going to get
[1:09:26] into something this morning is that in
[1:09:29] Christianity you find people trying to
[1:09:32] lead themselves
[1:09:33] and people try to you know uh even try
[1:09:36] to do God a service without it being his
[1:09:38] will stay right we we found that amen uh
[1:09:42] uh when Moses was on the scene and in
[1:09:45] his ministry you had these Brethren
[1:09:47] raises up and you ain't the only holy
[1:09:50] you you find all of that and but what
[1:09:53] you find in all of that you find death
[1:09:57] you you find Death when you when it when
[1:10:00] any time you begin to break the the
[1:10:03] standards and the programs of God
[1:10:08] I'm gonna happen
[1:10:10] I'm gonna have to take this off
[1:10:13] uh you you find you find people dying
[1:10:17] is that right God it's important for us
[1:10:21] to understand something
[1:10:23] from The Young to the old God sets
[1:10:26] principles in the scripture for a
[1:10:29] purpose and the purpose is for your
[1:10:32] benefit
[1:10:33] is that right God God God God has an
[1:10:36] order
[1:10:37] and anytime the orders of things is
[1:10:40] broken I said this last last time I
[1:10:43] preached but sometimes people
[1:10:45] misunderstand things but I'm only
[1:10:47] preaching y'all uh the reveal words
[1:10:50] and I'm gonna show you why if I get to
[1:10:53] it all because I got a lot of hair on my
[1:10:55] foot this morning uh it's it's so
[1:10:58] important and we gotta keep this in mind
[1:11:01] no matter how long you've been in church
[1:11:03] no matter how long you've been around no
[1:11:05] matter what your position is how much
[1:11:07] money you got how educated you are it's
[1:11:11] important to follow in the program of
[1:11:14] God if you're ever going to be
[1:11:16] successful in God foreign
[1:11:21] if if you're ever going to fulfill the
[1:11:24] purpose and plan of God what God has for
[1:11:28] us it's important for us to you know
[1:11:31] following the program and the standards
[1:11:35] and ordinance and different things that
[1:11:37] God has laid out right right this is
[1:11:39] this this is a God thing amen is that
[1:11:42] right it's it's his plan his program
[1:11:45] we're fulfilling his purpose it's what
[1:11:48] God had in his mind right is that right
[1:11:51] because let's let's think about it when
[1:11:53] we were in sin we have a whole lot in
[1:11:55] our mind
[1:11:56] all right we might have wanted to be
[1:11:58] educated we might have wanted to do
[1:11:59] things like that but outside of God you
[1:12:02] would have perished with all of your
[1:12:04] money
[1:12:06] with all of your success if it's not
[1:12:09] connected to the thing that's Eternal
[1:12:11] you perish
[1:12:14] is that right
[1:12:15] well you never you never even spit on
[1:12:18] the sidewalk no matter in all of your
[1:12:20] goodness if if you don't accept Christ
[1:12:23] you perish
[1:12:26] with our good selves
[1:12:29] you you still perish
[1:12:32] so you you just have to appreciate God
[1:12:35] for his grace
[1:12:36] I do
[1:12:38] right I do I'm I'm here 35 years uh plus
[1:12:42] by the grace of God
[1:12:45] right The Sovereign Grace of God by the
[1:12:48] program of God because of what God had
[1:12:51] in his mind and here uh God's family
[1:12:54] God's Church
[1:12:56] who we are this morning right at a spot
[1:13:01] where they were getting ready to cross
[1:13:04] over and into a new day all right
[1:13:08] a new time right right new Fellowship
[1:13:12] new experience that's where we are this
[1:13:15] morning
[1:13:16] is that right we we've come out of a one
[1:13:21] year and and we leave we listen to
[1:13:24] church hindsight they say it's 20 20.
[1:13:28] right right
[1:13:31] and you know sometimes when I think
[1:13:33] about it uh it's like yeah but even
[1:13:37] sometimes in knowing certain things we
[1:13:39] still do the opposite that's just goes
[1:13:42] along with human nature so we can't live
[1:13:46] in the past
[1:13:47] we gotta refuse to live in the past
[1:13:50] right yesterday is gone
[1:13:53] all I didn't accomplish yesterday I
[1:13:55] can't look back at it I just gotta you
[1:13:58] know uh uh keep focus and keep moving
[1:14:01] forward
[1:14:02] see amen and that's what we got to do
[1:14:04] this morning we got to just continue to
[1:14:06] move forward
[1:14:08] right and and scripturally why watch
[1:14:11] something Watch the watch the order of
[1:14:13] God and it's gonna bless us
[1:14:15] right there's an order to the things of
[1:14:18] God God speaking the Joshua Joshua and
[1:14:23] watch what he tells Joshua and it's
[1:14:25] going to be good for us this morning
[1:14:26] church
[1:14:27] right see to break the order you lose
[1:14:32] you you just really lose your life right
[1:14:35] yeah he he tells the church he says
[1:14:38] listen we're getting ready to go on the
[1:14:39] move
[1:14:41] right amen
[1:14:43] you don't you don't even know anything
[1:14:45] about where you go in the direction or
[1:14:49] anything else is that right you you
[1:14:51] don't even know
[1:14:54] see we don't even we don't even begin to
[1:14:57] know what this year gonna hold
[1:14:59] what we gonna be able to encounter but
[1:15:02] he does
[1:15:03] [Music]
[1:15:05] come on yeah come on Joshua greater man
[1:15:09] as he was a great warrior and everything
[1:15:11] else right he didn't know either
[1:15:16] but he had the amen learn to follow God
[1:15:21] follow the order of God
[1:15:24] right you told him listen I want y'all
[1:15:27] to do something for me I the priest's
[1:15:30] gonna go first
[1:15:33] right and you don't get too close
[1:15:37] because if you get too close you might
[1:15:39] not know they might change you might be
[1:15:40] too close and don't know where they
[1:15:42] going you you stand back up you stand
[1:15:45] back a little ways
[1:15:48] and and let and let these guys with the
[1:15:52] word
[1:15:53] right lead you right right not just
[1:15:56] saying something all right we ain't
[1:15:58] shout real good but I just said
[1:16:00] something
[1:16:01] see you don't want to try to do God of
[1:16:03] service without it being his will
[1:16:06] right come on
[1:16:09] like like David and David's time
[1:16:12] right he he did
[1:16:15] direct opposite of the original thought
[1:16:19] of God
[1:16:21] right because because God showed us a
[1:16:24] principle right here in the Book of
[1:16:26] Joshua
[1:16:27] right it's it's always the the uh
[1:16:31] priesthood with the uh carrying the Ark
[1:16:35] of the Covenant not the businessman not
[1:16:38] the smart people not not the sisters not
[1:16:41] all of that no it ain't it don't go like
[1:16:43] that
[1:16:45] right
[1:16:47] it's it's not that it's it's the
[1:16:50] ministry carrying the word
[1:16:53] David consulted and this is what we do
[1:16:56] we consult the captains of this one and
[1:16:58] the captains are doubt winning your best
[1:17:00] friend and your co-workers and and girl
[1:17:03] y'all don't talk to me this morning
[1:17:06] right and and they they built see watch
[1:17:10] culture culture causes you to build
[1:17:14] right uh just something new
[1:17:18] see amen a new organization a new
[1:17:22] ministry a new and bring forth a new
[1:17:25] thought but from that new thought
[1:17:29] brought death to a man
[1:17:32] right because there was a principle
[1:17:35] there and and if they would look back at
[1:17:39] the word and saw the order of God that
[1:17:42] man would not have died
[1:17:45] reaching out trying to catch the the Ark
[1:17:49] of the Covenant when it was falling see
[1:17:51] because it would have been on the
[1:17:53] shoulders of the Levites the Levites
[1:17:57] would have been carrying it not a new
[1:17:59] way
[1:18:01] not a new order
[1:18:05] yeah I just said something but I don't
[1:18:07] even know if y'all caught that
[1:18:09] see when any time you bring in new ways
[1:18:13] new orders now this is going to be this
[1:18:15] is gonna be good right for where we
[1:18:16] going next
[1:18:19] Watch what it produces
[1:18:21] it produces death right
[1:18:24] right
[1:18:25] because if the ark was on the shoulders
[1:18:29] of the Levites
[1:18:32] they was positioned to handle it
[1:18:34] right
[1:18:36] it shows you something the cart wasn't
[1:18:39] wasn't efficient
[1:18:41] or sufficient it broke the order of God
[1:18:46] we don't think about these things amen
[1:18:48] as as Christians and to see the
[1:18:51] importance of it right amen this year
[1:18:54] let us let us make sure we find
[1:18:59] ourselves behind the word
[1:19:04] right behind the word because right it's
[1:19:08] that's where your protection is
[1:19:12] that's where your Victory lies
[1:19:15] right that's where your leadership lies
[1:19:19] behind the word behind the ministry
[1:19:23] carrying the anointed world now we're
[1:19:26] still moving this morning
[1:19:28] right amen
[1:19:30] amen this this was the the order that
[1:19:33] was given to the church a man that that
[1:19:38] unfolds itself all the way over into
[1:19:40] this hour that we're living in because
[1:19:42] God don't change
[1:19:44] he don't change his mind about his word
[1:19:47] that was just a shadow
[1:19:50] but there's a truth in these things also
[1:19:53] we must God anoint because how could you
[1:19:56] uh uh hear a letter preacher preach
[1:20:00] and he got to be called
[1:20:03] right no matter how much education you
[1:20:06] got it's because it's got to be a
[1:20:07] calling
[1:20:09] it's you got to be gifted and those
[1:20:11] things is there before the foundations
[1:20:13] of the world no matter how much
[1:20:15] schooling you got no matter how much you
[1:20:18] read it how many takes you got that
[1:20:20] don't make you a preacher
[1:20:23] it won't make you a preacher right and
[1:20:27] if you ain't gifted the shepherd you
[1:20:30] won't be a shepherd
[1:20:31] right if if no matter what you say right
[1:20:36] if you if you ain't gifted an evangelist
[1:20:39] you will never be a good evangelist
[1:20:42] right you might say well I'm a teacher
[1:20:45] and you get the fumbling with the
[1:20:48] scriptures and and and just having the
[1:20:50] thing tied up all over the place it
[1:20:53] shows you ain't no teacher
[1:20:56] come on you stumbling you're stumbling
[1:20:59] and bumbling he's like bro you ain't no
[1:21:01] teacher
[1:21:03] a real teacher got a real good handle
[1:21:06] on the word
[1:21:08] right
[1:21:10] amen a teacher and a teacher can't
[1:21:12] pastor
[1:21:15] right but one thing I I you you know
[1:21:17] about a pastor a pastor can teach maybe
[1:21:21] not like a teacher but he can teach he
[1:21:24] can get under an evangelistical
[1:21:26] anointing and not be an evangelist
[1:21:30] he can have prophetic insight
[1:21:34] and not be a prophet
[1:21:36] see we've been giving folks titles and
[1:21:39] all kinds of stuff it's like what in the
[1:21:40] world are people doing
[1:21:43] gifts and stuff like that is in the body
[1:21:46] you don't even have to be a a preacher
[1:21:50] to be used Amen in the body to prophesy
[1:21:55] something this morning
[1:21:57] well praise the Lord I feel I'm starting
[1:21:59] to feel good
[1:22:02] is that right
[1:22:03] amen we can't be given titles we just
[1:22:07] gotta understand the order but I better
[1:22:09] move off with this his stuff
[1:22:11] huh but but I want to encourage us this
[1:22:15] this morning Amen to follow a man the
[1:22:19] lion of the thought of God
[1:22:23] right
[1:22:24] let's let us learn how to follow the
[1:22:27] word
[1:22:28] put the word before us and follow follow
[1:22:32] the world
[1:22:33] not us getting ahead of the word
[1:22:36] right
[1:22:38] amen but let us stay behind the word let
[1:22:41] us stay behind leadership that's where
[1:22:44] we get messed up at right amen we don't
[1:22:47] we don't see the importance of
[1:22:50] leadership
[1:22:52] and following behind not getting ahead
[1:22:56] of feeling like you're on the same level
[1:23:00] because you're not all right
[1:23:03] you not and all you're going to do is
[1:23:05] make a mess and and wreck up
[1:23:09] right I I've seen I've seen it over the
[1:23:12] years
[1:23:13] um where people people don't understand
[1:23:15] the layout and the importance of uh of
[1:23:20] following behind the word
[1:23:22] right this is just January 1st y'all
[1:23:26] it's a new season it's a new day
[1:23:30] right glory to his wonderful name so so
[1:23:34] you know y'all got that part this
[1:23:36] morning
[1:23:37] that that is that is of the utmost
[1:23:41] importance going into another year if we
[1:23:45] do that
[1:23:47] right look at the scripture we'll find
[1:23:50] ourselves a blessed
[1:23:54] right we'll find ourselves blessed
[1:23:57] amen even when the enemy comes in we'll
[1:24:00] find ourselves blessed
[1:24:02] right amen uh let us let's just kind of
[1:24:06] move a little a little further this
[1:24:08] morning
[1:24:09] like we said um
[1:24:11] we we
[1:24:13] I want to kind of use a little something
[1:24:15] I'll tell you what brother track brother
[1:24:17] Troy did he always do a good job you
[1:24:21] know I always get a whole lot of out of
[1:24:24] the things that he he brings out
[1:24:28] he sometimes you know and that's just
[1:24:31] the nature of preaches you preaching
[1:24:32] you'd be like why well I don't think I
[1:24:35] brought that across and this that the
[1:24:36] other and the next man be like what dude
[1:24:40] you did your thing
[1:24:42] you did your thing
[1:24:45] amen and I and I don't be impressed by a
[1:24:49] lot
[1:24:50] I but when I hear certain things I feel
[1:24:53] like but I was that was that was that
[1:24:55] was real good yeah we wanna we wanna
[1:24:58] look at
[1:25:00] the day and hour that will that we're
[1:25:03] living in because uh
[1:25:06] we
[1:25:08] we want to look at culture and and I
[1:25:10] want to maybe try to Define culture
[1:25:13] uh I'm not a
[1:25:18] smart smart dude I could read a little
[1:25:20] bit
[1:25:21] so I'm gonna read y'all the definition
[1:25:25] right uh because people people people
[1:25:29] from a scripture's standpoint in the day
[1:25:32] and hour that we live in and I find that
[1:25:34] people taking a lot of things for
[1:25:37] granted and I think it's because we just
[1:25:40] really lack
[1:25:42] spiritual understanding
[1:25:45] right and and we don't realize
[1:25:49] there's an influence
[1:25:53] right and we're gonna get in we're going
[1:25:54] to talk a little bit about the Pale
[1:25:56] Horse
[1:25:57] right right
[1:25:58] there's an influence yeah that's there's
[1:26:02] a there's a
[1:26:04] a law of contrast all the time there's a
[1:26:06] there's a there's a negative and a
[1:26:09] positive influence
[1:26:11] right come on that's that's a when we
[1:26:15] think about culture it's it's it has
[1:26:18] some negative parts and it has positive
[1:26:24] right
[1:26:25] glory to God it does and you just gotta
[1:26:28] you just got to be able to look at this
[1:26:30] holistically and and and just really be
[1:26:34] able to understand
[1:26:35] uh and then it'll help us to understand
[1:26:39] uh us as Ministries you'll understand me
[1:26:42] better right you understand brother Jack
[1:26:45] brother Troy and the ministers you'll
[1:26:47] understand us a little bit better uh as
[1:26:50] as
[1:26:51] I bring this out this morning because I
[1:26:53] want I want to help us this morning
[1:26:55] because a lot of times you know you
[1:26:57] might think well these guys and and
[1:27:00] these guys it's not it's that's not what
[1:27:03] it is right it's it's it's an anointing
[1:27:07] that we're under that we can't do
[1:27:09] anything else
[1:27:12] I I read the quote to you in a minute
[1:27:14] but so did you listen no matter how much
[1:27:18] I want to do something else and and no
[1:27:21] matter how much I wanna I wanna maybe be
[1:27:24] like TD Jakes
[1:27:26] come on somebody
[1:27:28] you know because he got a dynamic
[1:27:31] Ministry for for
[1:27:33] you know
[1:27:35] but it it I don't like to be critical
[1:27:38] like that but it's the truth it it fits
[1:27:41] a certain uh group right
[1:27:45] right right and it appeals to a certain
[1:27:48] group
[1:27:49] and it has a he has a lot of Truth and I
[1:27:52] hate to even that I called his name but
[1:27:55] uh because I don't like to call
[1:27:57] ministers names but there's a difference
[1:28:01] because even even in the spoken word is
[1:28:04] the Original Seed your Prophet was
[1:28:06] trying to explain his ministry in the
[1:28:10] day that he was in and showing what
[1:28:14] these other brothers Ministries was all
[1:28:16] about and then what his ministry
[1:28:21] was all about and the anointing that he
[1:28:23] was up under
[1:28:25] that was vital that was key for the day
[1:28:28] that we living in and I'm gonna get to
[1:28:32] it if I can and with with without it
[1:28:35] we'd be sucked up
[1:28:38] right we'd be sucked up wow
[1:28:42] because of the the influence
[1:28:45] right right see that that's an
[1:28:48] inspiration there's a writer going forth
[1:28:52] and that writer is to pair horse and his
[1:28:54] ministry is death
[1:28:59] come on Church
[1:29:02] see and and this is in multiple levels
[1:29:06] we don't even people can't even begin to
[1:29:09] grasp
[1:29:11] right what he's writing it's it's the
[1:29:15] inspiration of the the white the red and
[1:29:17] the black all can jail into one and it's
[1:29:21] a a power horse riding and that Rider is
[1:29:26] death
[1:29:29] right glory to God but culture culture
[1:29:34] is is a way of life of a group of people
[1:29:37] watch this and it's negative and
[1:29:40] positive it's the the behavior
[1:29:44] because you know we have a behavior
[1:29:48] as sons of God
[1:29:50] right
[1:29:50] adoption is based upon Behavior
[1:29:54] right right
[1:29:55] it's the report back to God of the
[1:29:58] behavior of the Sun
[1:30:01] what's their behavior right just to see
[1:30:06] all them mature enough to really handle
[1:30:10] the checkbook
[1:30:13] right
[1:30:14] Amen to see if they so it's it's it's
[1:30:17] the negative because there's a negative
[1:30:20] behavior that we're seeing
[1:30:23] that we have got to combat
[1:30:27] right right because we we don't have no
[1:30:31] choice it's the anointing that we're up
[1:30:33] under
[1:30:34] because of this eagle
[1:30:37] right amen that we cannot do anything
[1:30:40] else but they seem so critical and they
[1:30:44] seem right they above you just don't
[1:30:47] understand that's all that is
[1:30:50] when it just seemed like you know you
[1:30:53] know you hear all sorts of things right
[1:30:55] but they just seem like they better
[1:30:57] right than everybody else and and this
[1:31:01] no you just don't understand
[1:31:04] the the level of understanding that we
[1:31:08] have
[1:31:09] it's humility it's the grace of God
[1:31:13] but
[1:31:15] in this age people just just just not
[1:31:18] getting it
[1:31:20] right but and here's the thing you got
[1:31:23] to thank God for being elected
[1:31:26] amen right
[1:31:27] like brother Brandon would say that's
[1:31:29] not skilled milk being predestinated
[1:31:31] right having representation that's not
[1:31:35] skim milk
[1:31:37] right
[1:31:39] we're not talking about religion
[1:31:42] we talking about a man being a part of a
[1:31:45] body a body move right but culture is a
[1:31:49] way of life of a group of people
[1:31:54] the behavior
[1:31:56] beliefs values symbols that they accept
[1:32:02] right genuinely without thinking about
[1:32:05] them right that there's a lot of things
[1:32:09] that people accept
[1:32:13] that they don't really think about they
[1:32:17] don't filter these things through a
[1:32:19] thinking man's field to and and we we
[1:32:23] we're willing to accept
[1:32:26] all right right behaviors
[1:32:31] thoughts that's political that's
[1:32:35] religiously from a humanistic standpoint
[1:32:38] and then we we start breaking it down to
[1:32:41] where I wear this I'm white and they're
[1:32:43] black and and we're Superior and we're
[1:32:47] looking for Supermans and
[1:32:51] I'm going somewhere church this morning
[1:32:53] that stuff majority of this stuff come
[1:32:57] from the pit of Hell
[1:32:59] realistically
[1:33:01] most of that stuff will not get you in
[1:33:04] the globe
[1:33:05] whether you American you Chinese you
[1:33:09] Haitian you you know I don't care where
[1:33:11] you from Africans whatever
[1:33:14] right you you those those cultural
[1:33:18] things you can't pass through a man of
[1:33:21] thinking man's filter that's why I thank
[1:33:24] God for the son of man I thank God for a
[1:33:26] an inspiration of equal anointing for
[1:33:29] the hour that we're living in because
[1:33:32] you know the the the the age and the
[1:33:36] hour and the inspiration and the spirits
[1:33:39] of this age is on steroids
[1:33:43] yeah right just that thing just struck
[1:33:48] me thinking about all of the things that
[1:33:50] I've heard said through the lips of a
[1:33:53] prophet and studying I'm like man
[1:33:57] he he he saw it right right but I don't
[1:34:02] think he he could really imagine it
[1:34:04] being this bad
[1:34:09] right because I don't think he was shown
[1:34:12] everything
[1:34:14] right but I think he saw enough to lay
[1:34:18] things out that when we start to seeing
[1:34:22] things we like wow
[1:34:25] he had a real Point amen
[1:34:28] amen he had a real point right because
[1:34:31] let's let's let's look at some things
[1:34:33] this this morning I'm still going I'm
[1:34:35] still going somewhere
[1:34:37] right uh we realized we back in Genesis
[1:34:42] right yeah Genesis Luke
[1:34:46] right
[1:34:48] look at the look at look at
[1:34:52] and I'm something that I was something
[1:34:55] that I I I was reading maybe a week or
[1:34:58] two ago uh as it pertains to uh
[1:35:02] marijuana
[1:35:04] hope nobody don't smoke weed
[1:35:07] praise the Lord
[1:35:09] glory to God
[1:35:15] nah nah I ain't gonna lie I used to stop
[1:35:18] let me say that I used to smoke weed I
[1:35:23] haven't endowed in 35 years or better
[1:35:28] uh
[1:35:29] but
[1:35:30] one of the things I get into I get into
[1:35:32] an argument because I work I work around
[1:35:34] I work around a bunch of pot heads and
[1:35:38] wine biblings and everything on my job
[1:35:41] and we get into this we get into these
[1:35:44] arguments about
[1:35:46] my day and this day right and and I
[1:35:50] argue with them now
[1:35:52] from experience I hope it's all right I
[1:35:55] don't smoke weed Church
[1:35:56] but I did smoke weed I y'all know me I
[1:36:00] wasn't a great I had a great guy now but
[1:36:02] I definitely one of the great guy then
[1:36:04] my greatness is because of Jesus Christ
[1:36:06] anything that I am I attributed to God
[1:36:08] and we argue because
[1:36:11] they I'll be saying buying the stuff
[1:36:13] that y'all know is stank
[1:36:16] it has such an
[1:36:18] aroma and uh I said man we could smoke
[1:36:22] and hide it y'all okay
[1:36:24] it don't even have to be lit
[1:36:27] right it could just be in your pocket
[1:36:30] and you can smell it you like and my
[1:36:33] cousin he arguably like cause you got a
[1:36:35] nose like my mama well that was my aunt
[1:36:37] she didn't smoke so it's like
[1:36:42] if I get around it automatically my body
[1:36:45] reacts I start coughing it
[1:36:50] I lost somebody somebody
[1:36:56] smoking weed up in here
[1:36:59] right and we and and but in the article
[1:37:03] what the article said
[1:37:06] it talks about
[1:37:08] the the the people that smoking it and
[1:37:12] what is causing more of
[1:37:15] anxiety
[1:37:18] right everybody I'm nervous and I'm this
[1:37:22] yeah you need to stop smoking that weed
[1:37:25] depression
[1:37:29] this smoking because of the high levels
[1:37:33] of TAC that's in it
[1:37:37] right trying to get them to see these
[1:37:40] things are manufactured right and and my
[1:37:44] cousin we argue it's like bro wait
[1:37:46] mentally we just on different levels
[1:37:49] right it's like brah these guys have
[1:37:52] tapped into the laboratory of God and
[1:37:55] they've experimented right bringing all
[1:37:59] of these things right taking taking what
[1:38:02] was natural
[1:38:03] and and through through through
[1:38:05] knowledge
[1:38:08] placing things in there and and look at
[1:38:11] the effects
[1:38:13] right we got more murder
[1:38:17] right we we got more
[1:38:20] of a mental disease
[1:38:24] right I couldn't quite comprehend
[1:38:28] um years ago when when I used to preach
[1:38:30] things and I used to read things and I
[1:38:33] just really didn't have the the the the
[1:38:36] data and the information
[1:38:39] I believed it but but now you know uh
[1:38:44] being able to really see means to
[1:38:48] understand
[1:38:48] uh I could really see how pathetically
[1:38:52] brother Bradham would talk about this
[1:38:54] age that we're living in
[1:38:57] right and and how insanity
[1:39:02] right uh all of these things is on the
[1:39:05] we got more churches but we got more
[1:39:09] institutions
[1:39:11] right we got more technology more
[1:39:14] information more more medicine but we
[1:39:16] got more hospitals more infirmities we
[1:39:20] got we got more of everything right man
[1:39:24] that's tapped into the laboratory of God
[1:39:26] eating from the Tree of knowledge of
[1:39:28] Good and Evil but and everything ain't
[1:39:31] bad
[1:39:32] right right but just look at the the
[1:39:35] detriment yes right and this is what a
[1:39:38] lot of young people ain't understanding
[1:39:40] they thinking they're having a good time
[1:39:42] no you messing yourself up
[1:39:46] right now you you know you can't think
[1:39:50] writing and you seeing stuff and you
[1:39:54] it's it's all of this Tac
[1:39:57] hallucinative and they're experimenting
[1:40:00] and watch culture is promoting
[1:40:08] right right
[1:40:10] they look what they they it used to be
[1:40:12] illegal for you to smoke weed all right
[1:40:16] they've legalized it they're getting
[1:40:18] they cut but it's an underlying thing in
[1:40:22] that also
[1:40:24] they making it accessible but with
[1:40:27] accessibility that comes damage
[1:40:36] comes comes damage
[1:40:39] break the dangers
[1:40:41] that's associated
[1:40:43] uh
[1:40:45] you know when do we eat smoking that's
[1:40:48] right right come on I would I I didn't
[1:40:50] think about it until earlier and I
[1:40:53] didn't have the art I can't even know
[1:40:54] where I read it at but I read it right
[1:40:57] you could probably look it up yeah uh
[1:41:00] so uh say it that say this don't smoke
[1:41:03] weed
[1:41:07] young people don't let anybody entice
[1:41:10] you
[1:41:13] because it's and I know y'all said
[1:41:16] it's influence
[1:41:19] if if you got kids going to school
[1:41:23] daddy gotta go to school I ain't gonna
[1:41:25] say that they got Neighbors
[1:41:28] if they got cousins
[1:41:30] well praise the Lord most of the trouble
[1:41:32] I got in was with my cousins
[1:41:34] most of the bad influence was because of
[1:41:37] older cousins
[1:41:39] sisters
[1:41:40] right so just can't say school but you
[1:41:45] you gotta you gotta be able to sit the
[1:41:48] these kids down and show them the the
[1:41:52] the detriment of it right drinking been
[1:41:56] taking folk out since way way Bible days
[1:42:01] been causing the breakages of families
[1:42:03] and things of that nature right
[1:42:06] amen uh but but
[1:42:10] in in the culture right look at look at
[1:42:15] what's been released on society
[1:42:19] and I'm gonna tell you something Church
[1:42:22] Society is insane and don't know it
[1:42:26] exactly right but I'm telling you
[1:42:29] people people
[1:42:32] are insane and and y'all sisters hold on
[1:42:35] I'm gonna have to say something but this
[1:42:37] don't pertain to y'all
[1:42:39] but I just wanna I just wanna get give
[1:42:42] us an opportunity to look at things
[1:42:45] thinking about some of the things that
[1:42:47] brother Branham talked about
[1:42:49] and the Visions he saw you know women
[1:42:52] you know to be with fig leaves and and
[1:42:55] all of these different things and and
[1:42:58] I'm gonna hit something real quick
[1:42:59] because people like to argue with me
[1:43:01] about you know wearing pants and and
[1:43:06] it's a big discussion
[1:43:08] right but it's something that
[1:43:12] people don't really really want to look
[1:43:15] at
[1:43:16] we want to argue about it but we don't
[1:43:18] really want to look at these things
[1:43:21] right and and
[1:43:23] from this seed form look
[1:43:28] look where we are with these things now
[1:43:32] right at a point where folks thought
[1:43:36] that well maybe back in the day that you
[1:43:39] know they're taking something from us
[1:43:40] and then we got women's live and we got
[1:43:43] all of this and we we got all of that
[1:43:45] and you know we no it is something that
[1:43:50] because it's always something that
[1:43:53] starts out innocent
[1:43:55] [Music]
[1:43:57] right come on now because if you look
[1:44:00] the white horse rider well I know ain't
[1:44:02] gonna be able to read these quotes from
[1:44:03] uh
[1:44:05] the fifth C Obama try to get to it I
[1:44:07] ain't got that much time but
[1:44:09] right um um everything starts out in an
[1:44:13] emphasis infancy form or or stage of
[1:44:16] Innocence seem like it's don't
[1:44:21] right but from that
[1:44:25] look just let's look at where we are
[1:44:28] amen look at look at what they come out
[1:44:32] in now
[1:44:33] look at because of culture look at the
[1:44:36] dress standard
[1:44:38] right and it's supposed to be the
[1:44:40] backbone but look at the dress standard
[1:44:44] see-through that's right
[1:44:48] come on and they say d this is closed
[1:44:50] they sell this stuff as cold
[1:44:54] and there's nothing it's nothing there
[1:44:58] some Twigs or something you know but
[1:45:02] is the truth that you have
[1:45:04] yeah see
[1:45:06] look look at look at where it has has
[1:45:09] gone
[1:45:11] look the little leotard things
[1:45:15] y'all know a little bit more about
[1:45:17] spandex y'all know what I'm talking
[1:45:19] about now don't don't get quiet on me
[1:45:21] the little spandex stuff
[1:45:24] right that probably was a time where you
[1:45:27] know it was worn underneath something
[1:45:30] nah they come right outside
[1:45:34] yeah you you go to the airport it's a
[1:45:37] hunt uh it's two below zero out and they
[1:45:40] just got a little spandex so I'm walking
[1:45:41] through there it's like people are they
[1:45:44] mine it just it just
[1:45:46] right it shows you the insanity and and
[1:45:50] the the influence of of of culture
[1:45:56] right the influence and what we gotta
[1:46:00] fight
[1:46:02] right
[1:46:03] yeah they don't say that brother I won't
[1:46:06] preach this mountain all right
[1:46:09] we've got to fight these things even in
[1:46:12] the church
[1:46:13] I ain't gonna get much witness but it's
[1:46:15] okay
[1:46:16] because I know what I'm talking about
[1:46:19] right things start from an infancy
[1:46:22] standpoint
[1:46:24] right but but okay let's be realistic
[1:46:28] right look at where it's at now
[1:46:33] come on
[1:46:34] look it look just look at the this is
[1:46:38] the standard
[1:46:40] this is what culture is saying is the
[1:46:43] standard
[1:46:46] right right
[1:46:47] and and this is what's
[1:46:50] you know I'm reminded of a statement
[1:46:52] that the prophet of God made about uh
[1:46:55] Jacqueline Kennedy right being the
[1:46:58] president the president's wife right and
[1:47:02] and her in the water head
[1:47:05] them dudes that they had back in the
[1:47:07] days right and then he said she
[1:47:11] influenced
[1:47:13] she was the influence right
[1:47:16] and and I'll take it a little bit
[1:47:18] further
[1:47:19] we had Michelle Obama and I ain't got
[1:47:21] nothing against Michelle
[1:47:23] right Michelle Obama right
[1:47:26] but she is an influential figure
[1:47:31] especially for African-American
[1:47:35] yes culture
[1:47:39] culture
[1:47:41] right
[1:47:43] we're not we and I'm not even dealing
[1:47:45] with Christianity
[1:47:47] right now
[1:47:48] right right we're just dealing with
[1:47:51] culture
[1:47:52] and how and how culture
[1:47:56] has has actually and I heard a preacher
[1:47:59] say this but culture has entered into
[1:48:01] the church
[1:48:07] but I heard a preacher says
[1:48:10] culture shouldn't be influencing us we
[1:48:14] should be influencing culture
[1:48:19] we should not want to try to be like the
[1:48:21] world but we should want the world to be
[1:48:24] like us we supposed to be the standard
[1:48:29] not culture
[1:48:32] my culture
[1:48:35] but culture has dictated
[1:48:39] Humanity's beliefs
[1:48:43] on every level but it's it's in line
[1:48:47] with scripture we're in the days of Noah
[1:48:52] right we're in the days of life
[1:48:56] and and look at the mindsets and and the
[1:49:00] thoughts and different things
[1:49:02] that's that culture has dictated
[1:49:07] and look at the influence and and look
[1:49:10] how they fight us
[1:49:13] right this becomes hate speech
[1:49:16] and and and culture has become the norm
[1:49:24] these things has become the norm
[1:49:31] we want to normalize these things right
[1:49:33] up even in the church
[1:49:39] well praise the Lord amen
[1:49:42] but the inspiration of it is coming from
[1:49:46] the Devil
[1:49:48] right
[1:49:50] the inspiration of it
[1:49:52] is coming and I'm gonna tell you
[1:49:55] something here's here's the thing
[1:49:58] the only way that God could ever have a
[1:50:01] church without spot a wrinkle any such
[1:50:03] thing right
[1:50:05] God was smarter than us
[1:50:08] see God watch this and I'm gonna show us
[1:50:11] something from a spiritual standpoint
[1:50:14] that God down through the history has
[1:50:19] set certain things in motion every time
[1:50:22] the devil moved and set something in
[1:50:25] motion
[1:50:27] God said something in motion also to
[1:50:31] combat that
[1:50:34] to combat that right
[1:50:36] because if there was nothing to come
[1:50:39] back
[1:50:40] the invasion of the thing that thing
[1:50:43] takes completely over
[1:50:47] come on
[1:50:48] come on it's it's just it's just like if
[1:50:52] if there wasn't a f uh opposing force
[1:50:57] over in the Ukraine
[1:50:59] did they say it's not soap this is our
[1:51:03] country
[1:51:04] just give me what it takes amen and
[1:51:07] we'll drive back the enemy
[1:51:10] Russia would have been took over you
[1:51:13] Ukraine
[1:51:14] and all of his occupants all of his
[1:51:17] resources and everything else and they
[1:51:20] would be slaves to Russia
[1:51:24] right
[1:51:25] but but because a man that that's people
[1:51:28] that's there that's saying not so
[1:51:32] under uh the inspiration right right to
[1:51:36] say listen we we we will combat this
[1:51:39] thing
[1:51:40] yeah to the death
[1:51:42] right we're willing we're willing to die
[1:51:46] like that fella that was willing to die
[1:51:49] for uh
[1:51:50] what was that yeah foreign yeah
[1:51:58] he was inspired
[1:52:00] right people around them fearful he got
[1:52:04] anointed amen inspiration fell on her
[1:52:08] right they didn't know what he was doing
[1:52:11] right amen but he was inspired yeah yeah
[1:52:15] and and that game that gave that gave
[1:52:18] the the men around him the courage
[1:52:22] the fight right when he ran down there
[1:52:25] and gave his life
[1:52:28] right he he gave us not just his
[1:52:31] countrymen he had a wife
[1:52:34] he had children he had nephews and
[1:52:37] nieces and sometimes amen you know you
[1:52:40] gotta you gotta just lay yourself down
[1:52:42] realizing you got wives and children and
[1:52:46] nephews and nieces and and people that
[1:52:49] might look at you and perceive you to be
[1:52:51] a little bit crazy
[1:52:54] foreign
[1:53:00] but see it's not that
[1:53:04] I you know I I'm in a war
[1:53:08] I'm fight I'm fighting so that y'all
[1:53:11] don't be overcome
[1:53:15] Brother Jay and you gotta sometimes say
[1:53:18] some hard stuff
[1:53:20] right
[1:53:22] yeah but but it's spiritual warfare
[1:53:27] man right and this thing is so subtle
[1:53:30] Church
[1:53:31] we're going into 20 uh 2023 right but
[1:53:36] we're gonna go in there with something
[1:53:37] this morning
[1:53:39] right so that we could understand
[1:53:42] right what's happening the influence
[1:53:47] of the
[1:53:48] culture
[1:53:50] right basically it's man's thinking yeah
[1:53:56] men that have been from the Tree of
[1:53:59] knowledge of Good and Evil
[1:54:02] because to eat from the Tree of Life Is
[1:54:05] Life
[1:54:06] and peace and Hell
[1:54:11] right
[1:54:12] glory to God
[1:54:14] enjoyment
[1:54:18] Glory
[1:54:22] about 15 minutes
[1:54:25] y'all y'all I I I hate to hold us too
[1:54:28] long but
[1:54:30] uh
[1:54:31] I I want to show us something brother
[1:54:33] Brandon brings this out in the fifth
[1:54:35] seal
[1:54:36] uh and maybe we're gonna start it
[1:54:40] uh verse 105.
[1:54:44] boy I know I need a lot more time than
[1:54:46] that but I'm I'm shorting it up
[1:54:49] you know Grace sufficient for this age
[1:54:53] he says now now uh terms of the Bible
[1:54:57] said these beasts and Powers knows he
[1:54:59] said I want you to know this
[1:55:01] the devil had four uh changing colored
[1:55:05] beasts
[1:55:07] all right
[1:55:09] to go forth on
[1:55:12] right he had four beats now I'm gonna
[1:55:16] tell you something
[1:55:17] I thank God for the opening of the
[1:55:19] seventh seal right
[1:55:23] to be to be operating up under that
[1:55:26] anointing living up under that anointing
[1:55:28] right because if not we would be
[1:55:32] consumed
[1:55:34] uh-huh
[1:55:36] right we would be consumed because we we
[1:55:40] wouldn't understand
[1:55:41] the the ministry right of the Antichrist
[1:55:48] right because we've made it all natural
[1:55:53] right we made it natural and we look at
[1:55:56] everybody natural
[1:55:59] and we look at everything natural
[1:56:04] right and these is my children natural
[1:56:08] you're choosing to go to hell too just
[1:56:10] like mine if they don't get converted
[1:56:12] now come on preach with me religion
[1:56:15] won't do church I'm telling you
[1:56:17] you got to come God's provided way
[1:56:20] oh y'all don't talk to me now
[1:56:23] I ain't putting nobody children in hell
[1:56:25] ain't even putting mine in hell but I'm
[1:56:26] just saying
[1:56:28] right yes sir okay so he said the devil
[1:56:32] had his
[1:56:33] his Force changing colored beasts to go
[1:56:36] forth on he had his four beats uh that
[1:56:41] was all three of them
[1:56:43] put it into the the color of one right
[1:56:48] and made that one to pay a horse
[1:56:51] and see that's what's riding today
[1:56:55] a white horse a red horse a black and
[1:56:58] we've seen each one of those was a stage
[1:57:02] of his ministry
[1:57:04] that's the devil's Ministry
[1:57:07] right yeah
[1:57:09] yeah amen he's been in stages but God
[1:57:12] has had something too he said a state a
[1:57:15] stage of the early church that had
[1:57:17] formed into denominationalism
[1:57:21] I'm gonna stop right here for a second
[1:57:24] now either God started denominationalism
[1:57:28] or he didn't
[1:57:31] right come on church and I think any
[1:57:33] real good theologian no God never
[1:57:37] started that
[1:57:38] they might be trapped in it because of
[1:57:41] meal tickets and everything
[1:57:43] but realistically they realize God never
[1:57:46] started one
[1:57:48] right
[1:57:49] amen God God birthed the church in the
[1:57:53] book of Acts
[1:57:55] right gave them word to base the
[1:57:58] Ministries on is that right the people
[1:58:01] call them Christians because they saw
[1:58:03] the Life of Christ in them is that right
[1:58:06] amen and they just took the word and
[1:58:09] preached the word but they never
[1:58:11] separated and and broke the thing down
[1:58:14] into well this is our little saying we
[1:58:18] got to be careful with that stuff too
[1:58:19] now
[1:58:20] and right even though we got truth we
[1:58:23] just got to make sure that we don't have
[1:58:27] the same kind of mindset
[1:58:30] even even with the word now I hope y'all
[1:58:32] hear me clear now
[1:58:34] and sometimes I'm talking I don't know
[1:58:35] if people things really register right
[1:58:38] I'm not doing away with with us but you
[1:58:41] can see you know sometimes the way that
[1:58:44] people handle the word it's just a
[1:58:46] little bitty Spirit there and that's all
[1:58:49] it takes because look at what we got now
[1:58:51] I've been somewhere
[1:58:53] right
[1:58:54] from all of this truth not the prophet
[1:58:57] makes a statement he says you know what
[1:58:59] this been going along and it has not
[1:59:03] denominated and it can't I believe that
[1:59:06] part
[1:59:07] I believe that part you can't denominate
[1:59:11] Christ
[1:59:13] right but from what what's here men can
[1:59:19] make their own little
[1:59:24] right men can do that
[1:59:26] and and we help them because nobody
[1:59:29] steps up with any boldness in the right
[1:59:33] Spirit to say wait a minute this ain't
[1:59:35] right
[1:59:36] this ain't right right but we blow me
[1:59:40] let me leave that stuff alone but it's
[1:59:42] the truth anyhow
[1:59:43] right
[1:59:44] because because when he started out in
[1:59:47] the beginning on the White Horse Rider
[1:59:49] what started out it started out it was
[1:59:52] innocent
[1:59:54] right I mean it was it was it was it was
[1:59:58] innocent
[1:59:59] but I might have to just preach it come
[2:00:01] hold y'all too long but but I feel like
[2:00:04] preaching y'all two hours today
[2:00:08] praise the Lord
[2:00:10] hey man I'm telling you something church
[2:00:14] we we have something that's powerful oh
[2:00:17] I hope I I ain't mess up my
[2:00:20] my party
[2:00:22] okay he says uh
[2:00:24] uh he says stage of the early church to
[2:00:26] have formed into denomination and now I
[2:00:29] see it he said the original Pentecostal
[2:00:32] Church
[2:00:33] uh upon whom
[2:00:35] uh the Holy Ghost
[2:00:38] was
[2:00:42] poured out coming down took upon an
[2:00:45] antichrist spirit
[2:00:47] for watch this formed and oh now God
[2:00:50] didn't do this man did this gave birth
[2:00:53] to some Daughters of organization
[2:00:56] right
[2:00:57] changing his power three times this this
[2:01:00] is the devil right
[2:01:03] right sure how the devil has moved down
[2:01:06] through the history of the church and
[2:01:09] how he's operated under these anointings
[2:01:13] right
[2:01:15] glory to God because we we just we we
[2:01:18] living in a natural world and we look at
[2:01:20] everything natural and and I'm not sure
[2:01:24] we catching the spiritual application of
[2:01:27] things and and the war
[2:01:31] that that you're in right we are in a
[2:01:35] war Church and the and the battle and
[2:01:38] the war that the ministry is fighting
[2:01:41] right I'm fighting a war
[2:01:44] right and I'm in a war I ain't no
[2:01:47] different than y'all I got my fight
[2:01:50] right
[2:01:51] but I know when when you you get
[2:01:54] anointed I realize I'm not fighting
[2:01:57] y'all as an individual this ain't even I
[2:02:00] don't do individualism
[2:02:02] not like that it's spiritualism bringing
[2:02:05] us the word
[2:02:07] right amen see brother Smiley Pickett
[2:02:11] you carnal
[2:02:13] you call them yeah yeah if if if it's
[2:02:16] your mindset is that it's carnal you
[2:02:19] don't you don't even understand what
[2:02:21] Ministry is is doing it's all about
[2:02:24] you don't even see your enemy aren't you
[2:02:26] enemy
[2:02:27] right right I'm just anointed
[2:02:31] I'm just inspired I'm living under the
[2:02:34] seventh seal
[2:02:36] right I've been writing up under a
[2:02:39] seventh seal anointing
[2:02:41] right amen because see party
[2:02:46] Lord help us
[2:02:48] I know I don't I'm gonna tell you how to
[2:02:50] do this because I'm a skill and I'm
[2:02:53] gonna give y'all some some research go
[2:02:55] back to the fifth seal if you haven't
[2:02:57] read it and maybe start at uh 150 and go
[2:03:01] going down and you're you're nowhere but
[2:03:04] I'm gonna skip because for time's sake
[2:03:06] could y'all do that
[2:03:07] so y'all don't think I'm crazy when
[2:03:09] y'all leave the church
[2:03:14] I don't want y'all to think I'm crazy
[2:03:18] but I knew I I knew I like
[2:03:23] these Pages start these Pages start
[2:03:27] building up and I'll be like man I can't
[2:03:29] get through this stuff you know one
[2:03:31] setting
[2:03:32] man it'd be just too much it'd be too
[2:03:35] much
[2:03:36] um y'all give me a second I I want to
[2:03:38] skip down to the fourth seal just to I
[2:03:42] mean
[2:03:43] the fifth seal and the four of beasts
[2:03:45] and then we'll get out of here okay
[2:03:48] y'all give me 20 more minutes
[2:03:51] I'm gonna try not to take 20. I'm gonna
[2:03:53] try to take 10.
[2:03:55] all over the guy but I gotta find my
[2:03:57] spot
[2:03:59] okay
[2:04:01] because to me this to me this is uh it's
[2:04:05] it's good it's something that I I think
[2:04:08] that we we um
[2:04:12] we need to know
[2:04:14] okay
[2:04:16] um like I say
[2:04:18] the enemy the enemy had four stages of
[2:04:21] his ride and God sent the different
[2:04:25] Ministries to to combat that
[2:04:29] for the purpose that those things don't
[2:04:31] take the people out right right
[2:04:34] amen because God's gonna have a church
[2:04:36] without spot a wrinkle uh brother Banner
[2:04:40] makes a statement say we're living in a
[2:04:41] day of perverse teaching right
[2:04:45] you say Wars will come to do what draw
[2:04:48] us
[2:04:51] away
[2:04:54] all right
[2:04:56] the devil
[2:04:58] wants to draw you away from life
[2:05:05] right I tell you what these things are
[2:05:08] sticky Church
[2:05:10] it's a lot it's a real spiritual warfare
[2:05:13] watch
[2:05:15] um 139 let's let's go there
[2:05:18] and I'm gonna try to run out of here he
[2:05:20] says that's Gallant men he says that's
[2:05:22] men who can stand he talking about a
[2:05:24] different name he say the models down
[2:05:26] Through the Ages there he said they they
[2:05:29] suffer terribly he said but what was
[2:05:32] they they were under the inspiration of
[2:05:35] the spirit of God in all of those ages
[2:05:38] they did things because of the
[2:05:40] inspiration of the spirit of God not the
[2:05:43] spirit of man
[2:05:44] the spirit of God he said the power 140.
[2:05:49] don't forget this church and you
[2:05:51] Brethren on tape I want you to examine
[2:05:55] this how could men do anything else
[2:05:59] beside the power of God
[2:06:02] that had been released to them
[2:06:05] and when I read that I said Lord I feel
[2:06:07] free
[2:06:09] I can't do anything else
[2:06:12] brother Jack these Brethren can't do we
[2:06:15] can't this is what's been released to us
[2:06:20] for your benefit though
[2:06:23] right and then and then if when it
[2:06:27] strikes you right you realize I can't do
[2:06:30] anything else because this is what's
[2:06:33] been released to me
[2:06:35] as a Believer as a son and daughter of
[2:06:39] God I gotta live this because of the
[2:06:41] inspiration of God that's been released
[2:06:45] to me as a Son of God and a daughter of
[2:06:48] God
[2:06:50] regardless of
[2:06:52] you know you just have to pray for other
[2:06:54] people right we're not trying to put
[2:06:57] nobody in hell
[2:06:59] right amen but but we're just trying to
[2:07:04] we're operating under a certain
[2:07:06] anointing
[2:07:08] right amen uh he said the power of God
[2:07:12] that's been released to them he said I'm
[2:07:14] going to set this box up here to
[2:07:17] represent that if God sends a certain
[2:07:21] Spirit amongst them
[2:07:23] that's the only thing that they can work
[2:07:27] by
[2:07:28] it's the spirit that works amongst them
[2:07:35] so I say Lord thank you that I'm not
[2:07:37] crazy
[2:07:38] yeah
[2:07:41] you know because sometimes I want to
[2:07:43] change
[2:07:45] right I want to change but then I can't
[2:07:50] I can't
[2:07:52] I'm gonna say this again I can't amen
[2:07:56] I can't that's right even if I wanted to
[2:08:00] I can't

[2:08:13] spirit that working amongst them now we
[2:08:15] will prove that to you by the history of
[2:08:18] the church by the opening of the seals
[2:08:20] and the power that's let loose watch

[2:09:01] we're gonna run the devil up out of here
[2:09:04] this is seven Thunder Revival
[2:09:08] it's a real seven Thunder Revival
[2:09:13] cause it's been released to us
[2:09:17] and we can't do nothing
[2:09:21] nothing I wish Little Brother Joseph was
[2:09:23] here this morning to run down the island
[2:09:25] brothers act like we used to
[2:09:27] see now a man and I maturity brother
[2:09:31] Jack we realize it's more than just a
[2:09:33] Saiyan
[2:09:35] right we understand now more what's been
[2:09:38] released to us and why we shout and why
[2:09:43] we aim man right he says by the opening
[2:09:46] of the seals the power that's let loose
[2:09:48] watch exactly the church responded to
[2:09:51] the anointing and they couldn't do
[2:09:53] nothing else
[2:09:54] right uh he says now the fourth Beast
[2:09:58] that was sent forth to combat the
[2:10:01] Antichrist in this last Beast right are
[2:10:05] you ready
[2:10:06] the last Beast that was sent forth are
[2:10:10] the last power to combat the Antichrist
[2:10:14] was against the teaching of God Auntie
[2:10:17] is against
[2:10:19] see and and this is why people say
[2:10:21] what's this this is why I'm kind of
[2:10:24] against a lot of these podcasts
[2:10:26] and and I sometimes you just have to
[2:10:28] hate you just have to hate but you
[2:10:32] realize
[2:10:33] it's the Pale Horse
[2:10:36] utilizing these platforms to kill
[2:10:44] right because it's it's changing the
[2:10:48] thoughts it's changing the morality
[2:10:52] right come on Church
[2:10:55] come on church it's changing the morals
[2:11:00] yeah just I mean the the way people
[2:11:04] think
[2:11:05] right
[2:11:06] and and just look what we got
[2:11:09] even in church
[2:11:12] men afraid
[2:11:16] but I'm gonna
[2:11:18] cause if they preach like this that they
[2:11:20] gonna empty that thing out
[2:11:22] right
[2:11:24] but see they can't preach like this
[2:11:26] because it ain't been released to them
[2:11:29] right
[2:11:30] Oh Glory I'm almost there
[2:11:33] amen he said combat the Antichrist was
[2:11:36] against the teaching of God the
[2:11:38] Antichrist he said was it was an eagle
[2:11:40] so forth he said the fourth living Beast
[2:11:43] was an eagle
[2:11:44] now you just study the ages study the
[2:11:49] scriptures is the eagle showing us
[2:11:51] something God always sends a an eagle
[2:11:55] and in in the Bible the last age was an
[2:11:58] eagle age
[2:12:00] right so they will know where we at and
[2:12:04] and what we're living up under right
[2:12:07] he says and God liking uh the eagle To
[2:12:11] His prophets now watch the last Age The
[2:12:14] Eagle age a revealer of the true word
[2:12:19] right
[2:12:21] when people come against it you're like
[2:12:23] wait a minute then you just don't
[2:12:25] understand the ministry
[2:12:27] right you'll understand what a prophet
[2:12:30] Ministry is all about
[2:12:32] why God civil prophet
[2:12:35] right amen see these other guys was just
[2:12:39] reformers this ain't Reformation yeah
[2:12:42] this revealing just turning our hearts
[2:12:44] back this exposing the works of the
[2:12:48] devil
[2:12:49] right okay let's keep moving
[2:12:52] he said before God moves into action
[2:12:55] like he did in the days of Noah he sent
[2:12:58] forth an eagle when he brought Israel
[2:13:01] brought Israel Pharaoh's Army was ready
[2:13:04] to go he sent an eagle right every time
[2:13:08] he sends an eagle at the last
[2:13:11] right
[2:13:13] at the end of it and here he sends an
[2:13:17] eagle again that's exactly what the word
[2:13:20] so how can you make it anything else
[2:13:23] sends an eagle a revealer of the truth
[2:13:26] aren't you glad for that
[2:13:27] that's been
[2:13:29] um falling all through the age 1 189. so
[2:13:34] how in the world could the ox or the man
[2:13:37] or whatever Beast was riding how could
[2:13:40] it ever be revealed into the eagle comes
[2:13:43] right they had their place they were
[2:13:48] Godly right Luther Wesley and all those
[2:13:51] guys under those under those different
[2:13:53] anointings they had their day they had
[2:13:56] their place right but if the eagle
[2:14:00] didn't come
[2:14:01] culture will suck us up like a vacuum
[2:14:05] all right we will be overtaken is that
[2:14:10] right see you say well you know you got
[2:14:13] to do this and you got to do that for
[2:14:15] the young people who said that where'd
[2:14:18] that come from
[2:14:19] God has an original original Bible Way
[2:14:23] right as Prius preach the word
[2:14:27] right
[2:14:28] yes sir we break down every standards
[2:14:31] and we still don't get the young people
[2:14:34] foreign
[2:14:44] are you getting them to Christ
[2:14:47] huh what are we getting them to we break
[2:14:50] it down break it down you keep breaking
[2:14:52] down the medicine you ain't got no no no
[2:14:55] healing virtue in the thing
[2:15:00] is that right because it takes you know
[2:15:03] enough this and enough debt to make it a
[2:15:06] man what it's supposed to be to kill
[2:15:11] but see smart man we we want to take out
[2:15:14] this and take out that and that's hard
[2:15:16] preaching and and that maybe yeah why no
[2:15:20] um let me tell you what the Bible said
[2:15:21] the Bible said all that the father give
[2:15:23] us will come
[2:15:27] on now you preached the word and the
[2:15:31] Believers will come oh that the father
[2:15:35] is giving a cop
[2:15:37] I never lost one
[2:15:39] [Music]
[2:15:41] praise God
[2:15:43] not not one
[2:15:50] greatest shower he ain't gonna lose him
[2:15:54] you'll see the trickery of the devil
[2:15:57] but it's the influence and it's the
[2:16:00] despair horse riding this power Ministry
[2:16:03] of death
[2:16:05] that wants to kill the church
[2:16:08] take all the oxygen out of the church
[2:16:12] a lot of form and a lot of religion and
[2:16:14] a lot of shout and all of that but no
[2:16:17] word
[2:16:18] it's the the word that a man brings to
[2:16:21] life
[2:16:23] amen is that right cause shout out you
[2:16:25] want to shout now I ain't got nothing
[2:16:26] against that now
[2:16:28] I like the shot but I can't
[2:16:30] right that ain't what I'm talking about
[2:16:33] but if we if we break the word down
[2:16:35] break the word what you shouting over
[2:16:38] what you got to shout over
[2:16:40] what's what's stimulating you where's
[2:16:43] the wine
[2:16:45] right
[2:16:47] come on now I'm almost God
[2:16:50] I'm about ready to go I don't win over
[2:16:53] my time
[2:16:56] praise the Lord I'm starting out wrong
[2:17:01] breaking the order somebody might say
[2:17:03] well brother banham say you shouldn't
[2:17:04] preach a good message is 45 minutes then
[2:17:08] I said God ain't moving but if God move
[2:17:10] he might take you to 50 minutes y'all
[2:17:11] gonna be all right
[2:17:14] okay I'm I'm really there boy I tell you
[2:17:17] what okay let's get 91. he says and then
[2:17:20] he raised up another Power he sent a
[2:17:23] power to meet it
[2:17:24] then he raised up another Power God sent
[2:17:27] another power to meet it and then in the
[2:17:31] last power he brings down the eagle to
[2:17:33] restore the children back to the
[2:17:35] original Faith again of their fathers
[2:17:38] the eagle age then you notice there is
[2:17:41] no more beast that's all of it that's
[2:17:43] the end now if if you would take now
[2:17:46] Revelation 10 1-7 I referred to it
[2:17:49] remember in the last messages age what
[2:17:53] was to happen all the Mysteries God
[2:17:55] would be revealed the eagle amen and
[2:17:59] remember when the eagle finally comes
[2:18:01] it'll be a hundredth of one percent
[2:18:04] that'll listen wow it's an eagle age
[2:18:07] remember it's all these other Riders and
[2:18:11] then even Jesus predicted if he did
[2:18:14] Haitian is coming there wouldn't be no
[2:18:17] any flesh at all to save for the Rapture
[2:18:20] it's the scripture right you see where
[2:18:22] we're at then don't you brother sister
[2:18:24] let musicians come uh
[2:18:28] uh amen
[2:18:29] listen church let me tell you something
[2:18:32] there's there's a there's a influence
[2:18:35] there's a pale horse that's riding
[2:18:39] the name on it is death
[2:18:41] to kill to kill the church
[2:18:44] to kill the power of the church to kill
[2:18:47] the anointing in the church the power
[2:18:49] and the anointing in the home right just
[2:18:53] just to do mass destruction
[2:18:56] but God sent an eagle to meet that
[2:19:01] to combat right and so church I'll just
[2:19:05] say this I can't do anything else
[2:19:08] right I can't I can't because of the age
[2:19:12] that I'm living in and the inspiration
[2:19:15] that we're under
[2:19:18] right we can't help but preach the
[2:19:20] Untouchable Riches of Jesus Christ we
[2:19:22] can't help but amen preach a prophet's
[2:19:26] message a eagle message for Eagles right
[2:19:30] amen we needed something to meet this
[2:19:34] evil day
[2:19:36] right amen we we needed something give
[2:19:40] me something to meet this evil day if
[2:19:44] not man we'd have been consumed like a
[2:19:46] vacuum
[2:19:47] right we wouldn't be here wouldn't be no
[2:19:50] Spirit In Truth Tabernacle
[2:19:53] right might be a little Spirit but won't
[2:19:55] be no truth
[2:19:58] come on
[2:20:00] might have a little bit on it
[2:20:02] [Music]
[2:20:07] won't be no truth
[2:20:09] right because the vacuum beaten sucked
[2:20:11] all of the word out of the church and we
[2:20:14] got formed and we got emotions and and
[2:20:17] things of that nature which is fine
[2:20:20] but we want that mingle with the word I
[2:20:23] want to shout over the word don't you
[2:20:25] I want a shout out to a promise I want
[2:20:27] to shout over what God is doing
[2:20:29] church God I believe I believe when I
[2:20:31] was reading that scripture in Joshua I
[2:20:33] believe God was speaking to us this

[2:23:54] um
[2:23:54] I pray the Holy Spirit will really drive
[2:23:57] home for us
[2:23:59] I know we live in a natural world I know
[2:24:02] that but we cannot continue to look at
[2:24:05] things from a natural point of view we
[2:24:08] have to we Are Spiritual Beings and we I
[2:24:10] mean we come from God we're going back
[2:24:12] to God we got to see things from a
[2:24:13] spiritual sign and oftentimes people
[2:24:16] just uh you know they they don't get it
[2:24:19] and I know
[2:24:21] um
[2:24:22] uh let me also just say this to while
[2:24:25] I'm here
[2:24:26] um
[2:24:28] we stream and we just had this
[2:24:30] conversation at the at the youth youth
[2:24:33] meeting
[2:24:36] um streaming is not the same as being in
[2:24:39] in the house it's not the same and I was
[2:24:42] talking about even just in a husband and
[2:24:44] wife relationship if husband and wife
[2:24:46] was separated for I mean an extensive
[2:24:49] amount of time like years and they're
[2:24:51] just streaming one another is that
[2:24:53] really a relationship
[2:24:54] I don't think it is right I mean that
[2:24:57] you know we we need to be together not
[2:24:59] not seeing each other on FaceTime and uh
[2:25:02] so I mean I mean I think I think we you
[2:25:04] know
[2:25:05] um we're glad that we're able to help
[2:25:07] those that you know that might not be
[2:25:09] able to get to church but but if you can
[2:25:11] come to church uh we want to encourage
[2:25:14] you to come to church that's that's
[2:25:15] that's that's what we want to do and the
[2:25:17] other thing I want to say is that
[2:25:19] um you know a lot of times things are
[2:25:21] preached from this Pulpit is streamed on
[2:25:25] john423.org which belongs to Spirit and
[2:25:27] Truth Tabernacle and uh and uh and so
[2:25:31] when it's when it's preached from Spirit
[2:25:33] into Spirits preach from Spirit and
[2:25:36] Truth Tabernacle it is for
[2:25:39] spirit and Truth Tabernacle
[2:25:42] I'ma say that again if it is preached
[2:25:45] from Spirit and Truth Tabernacle then it
[2:25:48] is for
[2:25:51] spirit and Truth Tabernacle
[2:25:54] Grace sufficient for this age

[2:26:29] had a commandment don't try to get in
[2:26:32] front of the word

[2:26:45] everything every decision you make make
[2:26:48] sure you're getting something out the
[2:26:49] word of God to give you a man something
[2:26:52] to solidify that but don't make no
[2:26:54] decisions based on feelings and emotions

[2:35:32] just bow in a word of prayer and we'll
[2:35:33] dismiss father we thank you for the word
[2:35:36] of God as it has come to us today how we
[2:35:39] appreciate your servant Lord just uh
[2:35:41] giving inspiration to bring it to us and
[2:35:44] Lord
[2:35:45] um just helping us to realize that there
[2:35:48] is certain an influence there's a either
[2:35:51] negative or a positive influence and
[2:35:53] it's in so many areas of our life uh
[2:35:56] Lord it's in the areas of fashion it's
[2:35:58] in the areas of of
[2:36:00] um uh politics lord it's in the areas of
[2:36:03] family so many things or areas of
[2:36:06] education so much Lord that we are
[2:36:08] coming against but we thank you for the
[2:36:11] eagle anointing that we find ourselves
[2:36:13] under and Lord as it was read uh to us
[2:36:16] we can't help but be who we are because
[2:36:18] of what has been released to us
[2:36:21] Lord and there's many I just think about
[2:36:24] uh right here at this school other
[2:36:26] churches but what has been released to
[2:36:28] them the people can only walk and what
[2:36:30] has been released to them God what has
[2:36:32] been released us causes us to live a
[2:36:34] live a certain way causes us to respond
[2:36:36] a certain way it's because of what has
[2:36:38] been released so Lord I pray that we
[2:36:41] won't take this for granted but Lord
[2:36:43] Jesus that we would go and meditate on
[2:36:46] the things that have been shared with us
[2:36:48] Lord and may we be able to withstand and
[2:36:51] discern the spirits Lord that are
[2:36:54] attacking in this day
[2:36:55] oh God we want to draw closer to you we
[2:36:58] need that a closer walk with thee so I
[2:37:01] pray God that you would bless us as we
[2:37:03] leave this place but not your presence
[2:37:04] thank you for bringing us through uh
[2:37:07] 2022 and allowing us to enter into 2023.
[2:37:11] what a blessing it is and God I think
[2:37:14] back on last year uh father uh Satan
[2:37:18] came against many of us and tried to
[2:37:19] take us out but Lord you allowed us to
[2:37:21] cross over once again Lord we're
[2:37:24] grateful for your your Mighty hand of
[2:37:26] protection we thank you for all all that
[2:37:29] you did for us and trust it you'll do
[2:37:31] the same throughout this year may every
[2:37:33] business be blessed Lord May uh those
[2:37:36] that are looking for jobs may they
[2:37:37] receive jobs those that are looking for
[2:37:39] houses may they receive houses God
[2:37:41] whatever the needs are Lord I pray that
[2:37:43] you bless and may you exceed
[2:37:45] expectations we're standing and
[2:37:47] believing for our church in our school
[2:37:49] and we thank you for manifesting it oh
[2:37:51] god father we just believe Lord that you
[2:37:54] are in control and we just appreciate
[2:37:56] you Lord we uh we love you help us to
