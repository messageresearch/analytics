how to uh use it all amen we don't want nothing to get uh dust on it we want to use everything we got you know around here and uh so just pray that god would just give us wisdom uh we got a couple things that are coming up and um i asked uh brother smiley would he take the wednesday night service this week amen so y'all get ready for amanda uh uh we're gonna just get ready for a good service amen we're gonna we're not you know i'm i i i do the i mean my my what the lord gave me to do is just the way that i teach i do that on wednesdays but when you when the other other brothers go forth they preach amen they preach and uh and i think it's gonna be a good mixture you know uh wednesday night is that service that you know you you got like the telephone pole like this and like this and then in the middle of the telephone pole the lines start drooping like that that's sunday and that's sunday so you need a wednesday in order to kind of put the the line straight you know keep it straight so we thank god for our wednesday night services and and i'm you know and y'all y'all bear with me because i i certainly have i'm just keeping it for the lord with all this talent we may have to add another service somewhere you know in there because uh we just you know we just we we won't move god amen and we're not sure how long they're going to let us meet like this so might as well take advantage of the time that we that we have so uh y'all keep in prayer brother sal and amen sister margaret good to see you all back amen as well amen we're going back to a man a very familiar passage here in acts chapter 2. our prophet used this a man as his subject for the sermon junction of time and um you know i am taking this same subject that he took and um and trusting that the lord will just bless us as we journey amen through this we are preaching today on the third junction the third junction i was last last but let me just share this quick testimony and i'm gonna let y'all i'm gonna read and let you obviously but last week i got a telephone call um after we do the service here brother simba takes the the the um the video at home and he kind of does some compilation and some rearranging and all this uh with the video uh popping names up on the screen and all kind of things you know just make it real professional and uh you know so when he does that he releases it to uh um youtube uh people get notified so this sister got notified last week i want to say probably about midnight somewhere around there i don't know when it was released but she got notified and she went immediately to her room to go look take a look at the service and um she next morning she woke up and her husband said i'm at a junction she spoke to a husband saying i'm at a junction and uh you know i just been talking with them during throughout the um the week and just praying for them that god would just because you got to be led by god when you come to the junction praise god and man i mean i can't pull and do this and maneuver and no no no no no let god do what he gonna do and let god prove and vindicate that you made the right turn when you got to the junction praise the lord let god do that amen and i believe god is doing it right so so uh you know i was just i was blessed to hear that testimony that you know they called me there believe in north carolina and uh just uh you know the lord knows all things amen and i just i thank god you just never know how to work gonna speak to who you know but just preach and just let god do what god do acts 2 verse 15. um i'm sorry verse 14. is that yeah i think 14. uh but peter standing up with the 11 lifted up his voice and said unto them be men of judea and all ye that dwell at jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words uh for these are not drunken and she supposed seeing it is but the third hour of the day uh but this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel uh and it shall come to pass in the last days saith god i love reading this god said this i will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh and i love the way god write that even if your flesh don't want it you understand even your flesh don't even want it you're gonna get it anyway i will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and on my servants and on my handmaids i will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy and i will show wonders in heaven above and signs in the earth beneath blood and fire and vapor of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before that great and notable day of the lord come and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved amen the lord of the blessing to the reading of his word shall we pray amen over the word of god father we thank you for uh the ability to be able to read scripture and lord as we are just looking at this your prophet took us amen on a journey uh through the junction of time as he you laid it upon him to read this scripture and god uh uh we believe we we're at the junction of all junctions and we're under expectation for this promise to be manifest amongst the people and uh lord as we come uh here uh we felt the presence of god through the worship through the singing the specials and lord everything that's been done but now we come to the ministering of the word and we pray the spirit would take control of this help us to all enter in and may you just do something so special for each and every one of us that are gathered here bless those that are joining us online uh the other saints lord that just could make it out today for whatever the reason we ask that you look upon them as well and just appreciate each one that's coming to the house of the lord and god we're grateful for what we see you doing in our midst we love you we praise you we thank you it's in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen you can be seated in the presence of the lord amen again we are using for our subject today the third junction amen the third junction praise the lord just let me uh begin our journey here today with a quote out of the message the deity of jesus christ amen the deity of jesus christ um the prophet makes this statement uh he says and and now notice a little while and the world seeth me no more yet you'll see me for i'll be with you even in you uh even to the end of the world that's right he's here now amen he's here now i remember sister uh dixon telling me a testimony and uh you know she was talking about how she was just kind of going through some things in her body and uh and she was you know listening to the tapes of the prophet you know you hear him in the prayer line and praying for different people just just you know just my just the power of god you know moving on those tapes and and uh you know you know she and she was just saying how she would just feel in the presence of god come down and and and she said lord if we could just have that prophet here if we could just have that property here be able to get into one of them services and and um and just enjoy the presence of the lord if that prophet was here you know and then uh she said she heard the voice of the lord say he is here now you got to catch who he is right when when when the lord say he is here what the lord was actually telling her is that the presence that came with the prophet never left come on somebody amen it wasn't brother branham that did those things it was just god vindicating him but that presence is still here that anointing is still here and if you have a need this morning whatever you need god's got it hallelujah he is here amen he's here now and in the days how his big picture always revolved up and made the same thing come to pass that we're seeing now the great drama is set it says and we're ready now to see great things happen anybody anybody glory to god ready to see great things happen church i i'm under expectation hallelujah hallelujah say we uh we're ready now to see great things happen the church has been brought from the cradle glory to god that's right pentecostal rocked it down yonder a few years ago back there while people throw stones and made fun and laughed at but she's grown to maturity now that's exactly right the hour is here amen hallelujah that's right that's what i'm interested in to see god's church coming together now we've been beat out here and beat out there but the hour is coming when god's throwing the blanket around us all to draw us in while the enemies at the gate hallelujah yes sir he's standing now for his people dan said the great things of the last days when these things come to pass my the great exploits i might as well just plant these seeds in here the great exports will the people then the men of faith will do in that day brother i'm on the amen if the devil rises up i won't attack that devil the prayer of faith is going to attack every devil come on church i mean we got to recognize who we are as sons and doors of god we're not just going to sit back and just let the devil do whatever he want to do amen he gonna hear prayer from somewhere somebody gonna be rebuking him in the name of jesus hallelujah glory to god i rebuke you satan in the name of jesus loose my brother in the name of jesus lose my sister in the name of jesus glory to god and i'm expecting the devil to let him go too amen church glory to god he goes on and says an hour has come now that when the great drama picture of god set forth of the latter rain joel said in the last days it shall come to pass that i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy upon my handmaids and maidservants will i pour out of my spirit and i'll show signs in the heaven above and signs in the earth below now you all um realize that we just had a a couple signs just show up in the heavens recently they had what they call the christmas star now that's what they named it i'm just telling you what they named it but it was uh multiple planets that aligned amen and it looked like one i forget that the three planets it was but you know they all align they say now they were saying that when when that happens typically it signals that a change is getting ready to happen also if i can just put its way it signals that we're at a junction right when that when that occurs in the heavens there's a junction that is taking place right and and they even tried to try to say now maybe this is what happened when jesus was born now we know jesus did was not born in december we realized that amen so when they call it the christmas style that's all they know but we know as believers that's not the time that jesus was born but maybe yes the stars did align because the wise men followed the star hallelujah and i'm going to tell you them wise men as they follow the star and led them right to the presence of the lord jesus and i'm going to tell you if you want to find christ today you're going to have to follow his star glory to god and the star's job is to lead you to the presence of the lord jesus what star am i talking about one of them seven stars that was in the hand of the lord jesus according to the book of revelation hallelujah glory to god we're following that star and that starts bringing us into the presence of the lord jesus all right he goes on and says this amen uh it says i'll pour out my spirit and i'll show signs in the heavens of heaven above and signs in the earth below and pillars of fire and vapor smoke it shall come to pass before the great and terrible day of the lord shall come that whosoever shall call upon the name of lord shall be saved jesus said in there these things that i do you shall do and greater than this for i go unto my father so there's some work left on this earth for us to do amen glory to god he says hallelujah hallelujah here's what it said and the word back there said he said if ye abide in me and my word abide in you ask what you will and it shall be given unto you so we're just kind of laying this this this this platform this foundation uh we're under expectation you know somebody had uh uh called me and you know they're not members of the church or anything but they call me and just a family member and said you know i had a dream that somebody in your family was pregnant i say my family i say well you know okay we'll see about that say i i only know one person in my family that is uh in the category you know of of of that happening you know and that'll be just fine if it happened that way that's fine praise the lord but uh but you know i began to think about that you know because uh spiritually you gotta watch things right and i said the lord just began to deal with me say now you know when a woman is pregnant uh and she's expecting right uh there's a certain time limit that is set by nature you understand nature sets a time limit that i don't care how much you say you expect it amen people want to see what you expected you understand and nature has a way of saying hey in nine months we're gonna deliver to the world what you were expecting a little boy a little girl is getting ready to come forth hallelujah and i say if i'm expecting amen that i'm looking for god to manifest certain things in our midst i said i'm expecting restoration i'm expecting deliverance i'm expecting praise god a new church in a new school i'm expecting to see my family saved glory to god i'm expecting for to get whatever god got from me i am expecting glory to god glory to god i'm expecting it church some of y'all ought to be expecting a new job somebody to be expecting a new house somebody ought to be expecting your your business to be blessed somebody ought to be under expectation for god to move on your behalf glory to god we don't want to just carry the baby and never deliver i believe the season has come and the time is here for the church to deliver what has been expecting [Music] glory to god hallelujah amen glory to god i'm i'm under we're we're ready to see great things happen so just land these things here and you know so uh when we talk about junctions uh remember the prophet tells us very clearly that we're supposed to expect a miraculous right it says it always takes the miraculous to speak of omnipotence says omnipotence is y'all powerful and it takes the miraculous to vindicate omnipotence so when we're at junctions we expect miracles to occur oh god we're gonna go back and just look at some of the things you know we talked about the first junction it was the days of noah brother branham gave us seven different junctions and the first was knowing the ark then the second was moses and the children of israel the third is abraham and lot glory the fourth will be elijah the 450 prophets of baal the fifth is jesus coming at the fifth junction uh the sixth was martin luther and john wesley and then the seventh would be the second coming of christ now as i mentioned there's you know i won't read all these quotes i just mentioned them in the past and i'm just hitting them again every junction god sends a prophet at every junction god sends a prophet at every junction there's the miraculous that's gonna happen and let me just kind of back up uh and just say now when a junction can be uh seen when you when you leave the parking lot today you're going to hit a junction before you actually get out the parking lot i mean before you get out the parking lot you got to hit a junction now the junction is a stop sign right and everybody no matter which direction you're going you have to stop and then you have to kind of make some judgments as to you know is it time for me to make a right turn or can i make that left turn because that traffic coming from both ways you got to make decisions at a junction hallelujah and if you fail to make the right decision it'll be an accident out there come on somebody and i don't care if you want to go left i don't care how fast you pull out that parking lot you're going to hit another truck you're going to hit the stoplight and if you fail to make the right decision at the stoplight you can create a mess so we're all at junction spiritual junctions and we must make the right decision [Music] amen now here you know the prophet tells us that noah and the ark was the first junction and we know noah was the prophet that was sent at that first junction but when we talked about some of the miracles that happened amen in that day one of the miracles to me is just seeing the animals come i mean animals had enough sense they can't even hear the gospel preach they understand they can't even make a uh if they can't they can't hear noah talk about it's gonna rain they don't even care what noah's saying but that's instinct come on somebody god gave them supernatural instinct to recognize something getting ready to happen and i don't know where they came from but they begin to walk two by two maybe by vision god showed him a big boat somewhere and they knew even the giraffes knew that the boat was big enough for them even the elephants knew that the boat was big enough for them praise god and the lions had no appetites [Applause] right everybody was going in for protection everybody was going in for security amen by by supernatural instinct they're being drawn to what noah had built [Applause] glory to god that was a miracle all in itself just to see the animals come you would think the people once they saw these animals coming to know us both they would have thought man maybe something's going on maybe i should repent hallelujah glory to god but as i said before one of the problems in noah's death that nobody would come to repentance god could get nobody to repent the man preached for 120 years and nobody came to the altar i'm gonna read a quote on this in a little bit but the miracles the animals coming the miracle is the door being closed by almighty god amen the miracle was the rain actually falling because it had never rained before those were miracles and uh and brother branham said one of the other great miracles that happened it was the miracle was how god had his believing children chuck tucked away in the ark of safety so that's a miracle that god can get somebody to believe and will come into this arc of safety what is the ark of safety today it is being it's being tucked into christ the word outside of that there is no safety let me put it this way outside of the reveal word for your day there is no safety oh i know sometimes that is very hard for people to take very hard but let's just give some examples if you didn't follow noah's message what happened death right now i'm talking about i'm talking about uh thousands of years ago if you didn't follow noah's message death if you didn't follow moses message death praise the lord i mean this is just how god operates look we're not going to come down to land to see and change the way god operates all we got to do is follow the patterns and if we can't come in line with the revealed word for our day it will be death spiritual death now i'm going to tell you something i'm going to shock you right now the problem is in this day is that people actually think they're alive when you read revelation 3 they actually think they're alive they actually think they got it going on and god said that's the spirit that's going to be in the land to actually deceive the people to think that they're doing right but if you're not following the reveal word for your day you're not doing right all right church the miracle is that god can get some people into the ark into the word into christ and they be tucked away while all the other stuff is going on out there look at this i want to read this out of resume of the ages the prophet says this harvest time it says have you noticed that in the harvest time though there is a real acceleration in the ripening it says there is consequently a slowing of growth until there is no growth right he says is that not exactly what we are seeing now it says the false vine is losing multitudes to the communists and various other types of belief her numbers are not increasing as she would like us to think right her hold on to people and i was just sharing this this morning with a few brothers when it comes to the false vine versus the true vine the false vine gonna always have more members than a true vine you know the bible say more amen uh uh are the children of the desolate wife right the deadliest desolate one than the married wife right so it's always going to look like they doing much more because all these great numbers but that's not the answer to god that's not the end just because you see a lot of numbers that don't it's not it's quantity q word quality glory to god all right let's go on he says her numbers are not increasing she would like us to think her hold on to people's not what it used to be and in so many cases going to church is just a show y'all y'all know the prophet just nailed that thing speaking this 60 years ago going to church is just a show glory to god and the true vine what about her is she growing i'm gonna just i'm gonna have to just make these comments here y'all just bear with me you know back in my day going to uh i grew up baptist and back in my day it was a show it's just people want to show they they hat they wanted to show they they knew suit right you know it was all about that now the day when you go uh it's it's the musicians want to put on the show it's the singers that want to put on the show it's the preachers even want to put on a show right everybody got to be entertained we're not here to entertain nobody i thank god when i heard this message i want to listen to a prophet grab his ear and hum and do nothing like that man you had to be able to identify with the words glory to god this was not gonna move your flesh actually this was gonna shake some things down off your flesh hallelujah somebody it was gonna cause you to live holy praise god amen and i appreciate being able to hear the voice of a prophet like that tell me the truth i told i remember brother mike told me one time when he first came to church and said brother jack don't tell me how to sin i already know how to do that say speak to me the truth so i can make it to heaven i said brother you got the right church here if that's what you want truth you came to the right place spirit and all right glory to god let me keep reading amen so the true vine what about her is she growing what where are all those vast numbers that keep coming to revivals and answer all the calls are not most of them merely emotional in their approach or desires of something physical rather than design that which is truly spiritual see is this age not like the day which noah entered the ark and the door was shut but yet god terry's judgment tearing the judgment seven days no one was literally turned to god in those silent days see that's what i'm talking about in this hour it seems like nobody is ready to come to god nobody want to repent actually what we're trying to do is actually hold on to our sin and still go to heaven amen i'ma tell you you ain't gonna make it like that you're gonna come up short praise the lord you got to get rid of your sin if you want to go to heaven hey man you can't add nothing to this walk glory to god hey man we're we're uh we're unpacking getting ready to go most people when they go on a trip they get their suitcases out and they pack this and they pack that and they put this in they put that they just weigh themselves down come on somebody they weigh themselves down and some of us when we ride them we get on those special airlines glory to god you got to get a special suitcase because you can't take all that stuff otherwise they gonna make you pay come on somebody some of us be stuffing stuff inside a duffel bag or some of the sisters just get an extra large purse and they say this is my carry-on i'm preaching to somebody hey man this is my carry-on you got that big old purse that you carry and got all kind of stuff stuff in there you want to make sure it fit in the little slots hey man so if they give you a hard time it fit in the slot whatever i got in i can take over with me glory to god but we're not taking a regular trip we talk about going to heaven so when you go to heaven you got to take this out of the bag take that out of the bag you got to lay aside every sin and every weight that's so easily beset ship glory to god we are unpacking getting ready to go to god thank you jesus amen this this this first junction one of the problems they had is people would not repent and jesus said as it was in the days of noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man we see the same spirits have entered into the land uh even today i mean i think about this pandemic and man when the pandemic first first hit you talk about people calling me and wanting to be baptized and you know want to get back to service as soon as the church door is open i'm going to be there we open amen praise the lord somebody gonna wait too late to get on the boat i'm just warning you in jesus name you're waiting too late and look i mean you thought covet 19 with something wait till the next thing come yeah all right hallelujah and i'm gonna tell you something this not surprising because the prophet said it was going to happen the prophet actually said it said plagues would strike now what happened in uh in the second exodus i mean the second junction plagues plagues in the second junction moses and the children of israel it was 10 plagues that struck things that they i mean lord let me just go through this you know but but but you know it things that that the magicians have never seen right can i put it this way things the doctors have not studied glory to god things that they wait a minute i mean even the scientists are trying to figure it out they don't know where this thing comes from hallelujah it's a it's a invisible enemy amen yeah you know he and the the sad part is that the invisible enemy is moving right here right now but i'ma tell you in that in that that second junction glory to god there was an invisible enemy that began to move it was the plague of death glory to god somebody and that plague of death was striking whoever did not have blood applied [Music] you had to have it on the top of the door and on the sides of the door you had to have it applied it must be seen glory to god that token had to be seen by the death angel and today when this virus is spreading here the token is on display praise god [Music] the token the token must be on display the the life of christ must be on display we got to have the holy ghost the baptism of the holy ghost it must be on display let me just make it plain this morning you know when a person is baptized it's a stark difference in the person that's been baptized into others that's just watching the baptism the one that's been baptized comes up wet why everybody else is dry you can see the difference that something has happened to this person but what you think gonna happen when when a person is baptized with the holy ghost there should be a stark difference in the way that that person lives versus a person that has not been baptized with the holy ghost it's got to be changed it's got to be changed glory to god all right the second junction moses and the children of israel some of the moses was the prophet to that junction amen and uh some of the miracles that happened during that junction was uh throwing down a snake his stick and it turned to a snake and when he threw down that stick and it turned to a snake another america's watching his snake eat up the other snakes because you had some folk at the junction that was going to challenge this prophet some of them say there's nothing but a a cheap magician trick and laura said that ain't supernatural that's a cheap magician trick glory to god moses thought it was supernatural but here the magicians say now you got them you got to think to yourself what were these people practicing in egypt that they could throw down they sticks and they become snakes and they they actually look at moses say ain't nothing to that think about what were they practicing glory to god right uh uh one of the other miracles that happened when when moses spoke out of his mouth by inspiration egyptians you've seen today you'll see them no more forever that was the spoken word that occurred in that junction hallelujah another was uh when i when i look at uh uh moses and these templates brother branham makes a statement he said the creator characteristic of god was in moses i'm gonna say that again the creator characteristic of god was in moses i'm saying that to say this the creator characteristic of god is now in his plight amen amen glory to god moses called for the ten plagues water uh turned the blood frogs lights flies livestock boils uh a hell mingle with fire locust darkness death of the firstborn he called for these plagues glory to god now i want to just kind of drop this i left this from from last week but i was just reading a little something out of a note from one of my bibles and it just says um as each plague descended upon the land the egyptian people realize how powerless their own gods were to stop it when the third plague of lice was released the magicians confessed to to pharaoh this is the finger of god they realize they can stop it every every time the devil do something god will one up the devil i'm gonna say it again every time the devil do something god will one up the devil and i want you to know this morning every time the devil do something in your life if he pulls one out he gonna bring one in and not only that if he pulls one out he gonna bring the same one back and he gonna give him a testimony that will shake hell glory to god amen so uh uh they they had a god that they served in uh in egypt and i believe his name was was either hoppy or happy i don't know it's hapi happy or happy right uh it was the god of the nile river uh but that god could not stop the waters from being turned into blood hallelujah they had another guy by the name of hathor he was the crafty cow goddess and uh and when moses spoke against the livestock that god of egypt could not stop the spoken word of god from being manifested against the livestock hallelujah amen there was another god that they served because remember uh uh pharaoh wanted to know who is the lord who is the lord well every time moses called the plague pharaoh got to know who the lord was not only who the lord was he also got to know where the lord was the lord was veiled inside of moses where they had another god that they served his name was a monray right now it was egyptian sun god and chief of the egyptian gods but when when moses spoke for darkness that god could not stop the eerie darkness from coming to land for three full days i love this because israel while egypt was walking in darkness israel was walking in light see god caused a separation of light and darkness amen at that time when that plague was what was to come but you know god also caused another separation of light and darkness in the midst of uh as a miracle there when they got to the red sea glory to god when they got to the red sea uh here moses is sticking his rod out and god is making a way for the people to go pharaoh's army is behind him and pharaoh's army is in darkness while the children of israel walking in the light church i want to say that's where we are today there's many walking in darkness but yet we are walking in the light the reveal word for our day now let me move forward to this third junction i want to look at a couple quotes out of the message the junction of time starting at paragraph e25 glory this third junction abraham and lot when lot and abraham another time when abraham was to be the ruler of the world it says and his seed was to scatter over the earth he had a lot his nephew with him which was a relative glory to god and what a beautiful picture today of the cold formal indifferent church to the spirit born elected called out separated church of the living god they dwelled together on the same plane but it finally come to a time to where lot took his great group and went down into sodom and gomorrah where they'd be popular so the purpose of lot going down is because he wanted to be popular and another thing amen when you go back and read the scripture you'll understand that that that lot didn't want to dwell in the planes come on somebody he didn't want to dwell in the plans he wanted to go to the city that was established and become popular and he did just that right he i mean he he was there one of the rulers down there in the city glory to god but but but uh and and i can tell you this amen i might as well say just hold that uh for me just for a second i'll get back to it uh sarah also didn't want to be down there in the plains sarah didn't want to be in the plains brother branham gave us you know uh something that happened uh when abraham and sarah received their visitation from almighty god and the two angels that came with him god stepped in flesh and came down to visit abraham and sarah he said now the problem was is that sarah was a little a man she had an attitude problem before the angel visited sarah was upset with abraham sarah was actually thinking about how mislot had it going on down in sodom glory to god somebody sarah was like i mean i mean they're not dwelling in the planes like we are i mean what am i saying about dwelling in the planks we gotta wear these dresses we gotta wear these skirts uh we can't put on this fingernail polish and we can't put on this you know we got to be so plain [Music] all right amen that did i'm gonna tell you the seeds of abraham don't mind dwelling in the plains come on somebody but sarah was a little disappointed that she had to be so plain look at miss lot and look at her but see what saturday realized is that what had overtaken miss lot caused her to turn to stone right she she loved the the the style and sodom so much she loved her position in sodom summit even when god was destroying the place she loved it so much that she had to turn in her heart and look back to it desiring and wishing that she could go back to some of them fun times let me tell you some of them fun times are over here amen but here miss lot just you know she uh she down there and joining so even when it's time to leave and can you imagine angels coming to your house this is some of the supernatural some of the miraculous that happened in the days of abraham like angels coming to your house glory to god these same angels came to sarah's house and sarah prepared a meal for hallelujah god and and as they're there preparing the meal oh she hears uh god speak to abraham say where's sarah your wife so she in the tent behind you he said now i'm gonna visit you at the time of life and sarah thy wife shall have a son now sarah begin to laugh now if you're a good bible reader you know abraham laughed as well but sarah was laughing with an attitude she was already under the wrong spirits uh i could just imagine like me and my me and my lord have pleasure again right she didn't know who was sitting at the tent and sometimes church i want to tell you we as the bride of christ we laugh at the promises but it's time to stop laughing i'm gonna tell you something else you're laughing ain't gonna stop god your unbelief won't stop god your doubt won't stop god if god has made a promise it's gonna be made manifest glory to god sarah sat there laughing and saying now watch sarah laughs she said oh i went laughing see now you're lying see that's what happened when you get a bad spirit on you they say say uh no i wanna say sarah i heard you but that's okay you still gonna have a child according to the time of life i will visit you amen so one of the great things that happened amen one of the great great great great great things was the changing of the body let me uh let me get back to my quote i'm always already way ahead of myself glory to god let me get back to this quote they dwell together on the same plane but it finally came come to a time where lot took his great group and went down into sodom and gomorrah where they'd be popular where they would take the choice of the land and abraham state i like this abraham stayed in the will of god and took the poor of the land and now you know by abraham taking the poor he just by abraham being a part of it it made it blessed right abraham uh took the portal and he let he let lot make his choice you know we got this we got this division that come among us now you make the choice which way you want to go a lot and whatever you take i'll take the less now most of us got to be we got to be able to have that same type of attitude if there's a time to make a choice always prefer your brother before you prefer your sister before you amen well you know this all well if this is what we got i'ma take this don't be like that amen watch this it says uh uh but if i he says uh let me let me i got ahead of myself somewhere abraham stayed in the will of god and took the point of the land sarah his beautiful wife and abraham stayed on the poor of the ground in order that they could serve the lord god don't promise a flowery bed of eating don't falsify a christian and don't falsify the message by telling that everything's gonna be all right if you're going to church and then i'll tell you you're going to have some trials they lying to you right don't falsify the message by telling that everything's going to be all right there's nothing going to harm you there's nothing ain't no trials or nothing that's wrong he said as a poet said must i be carried home to heaven on a flower bed of ease while others fought to win the prize and sail through the bloody seas no sir god doesn't promise ease and prosperity but he promises grace to endure in every trial it's the grace that we look to man they used to sing a song in the old church say lord don't move the mountain but give me strength to climb hallelujah lysis goes on and says abraham chose the way of god he stayed on the mountaintop though there wasn't much grass for his cattle but a lot a type of the backslidden world the church who doesn't believe in the miraculous then it finally come to those things round around into god until there had to come a junction there had to be a time for abraham was the heir of the land oh god what can't christians see blessed are the pure in the heart they shall see god blessed are the meek they shall inherit the earth the junction time is at hand for father to show that we're at the end time see now there's uh a lot of things that happened in abraham's life you know and i'm just kind of picking up some of the some of the highlights just to bring them to you today and and um you know as we we just we just look at him so many uh uh times where he hit a junction you know first time it is leaving his his homeland leaving the people that he he knew everything about leaving him and going to search for a city whose building maker was god that was a junction that was a junction and uh when god called lot he didn't i mean when god called abraham he did not call lot abraham brought lot along with him and it created problems for him abraham hit another junction he had to separate from lot and when you read the bible you'll realize that abraham was finally shown by god this is what i brought you into once he's separated from lot then he could see the blessings that god had for him and i'm gonna tell you you're not gonna see all the blessing of god till you separate from some things amen it's a whole lot of stuff that we need to separate from but you're not gonna see the full blessing of god until you separate until you come into full obedience with the word of god you will not see the full blessings abraham come to the spot say okay lot look we can't this land ain't big enough for me and you we keep fighting over everything yo yo you know y'all fighting over this well and we can't we can't keep going through this so you want you just make a choice you'll be the one to choose which point where you want to go lot look down and saw sodom and gomorrah an established city maybe he can see the likes of the city at night like yeah i think i want to go there because if i stay here in the plains i'm gonna have to build my own city i don't want to build nothing it's already established i'm gonna go down there and become somebody great and lot did exactly what he set out to do the problem is when lot went down there see he made the wrong decision at the junction because when he went down there he didn't realize the spirits that would overtake his family come on somebody amen there was some spirits down in sodom now he saw the lights but didn't see the spirits and when he got down there and maybe a lot thinking everything is good maybe he see a little family down here and say you know what i want my girls to get married i see these young boys and i'ma push my daughters off on these boys you shoulda did a background check lot you didn't know who you was pushing your girls off on the bible say these girls was married but they never got to know their husbands amen he didn't realize in that city the hus the men were getting to know the men [Music] come on church that's the spirit that was in that city but now he's so established in it he can't get out so you got to watch what you get yourself involved in you got to watch what you commit yourself to because you can go so far in that you don't know how to get out [Applause] that's true but thank god while a lot was down there and all wrapped up god had come down to visit abraham this was a miracle right god come down in the flesh of man him and two angels come to sit at abraham's tit and and as they're sitting there at abraham's tent glory revealing some of the secrets to abraham i i love that i just love that you know i mean just having a conversation say abraham now you know uh i promised you a son you've been waiting a long time but at the time of life i'm gonna give you that son abraham and abra abraham when he saw the three visitors he said my lord he had the right revelation of who that who they who it was that was standing before my lord the same god that had changed his name a few weeks ago a few months ago that same god come on the scene and called him by the changed name his name was abram before but now he's abraham said the only person that knows my new name is the one that gave me my new name [Applause] hallelujah abraham say this is my lord glory to god as he's sitting there and fellowshipping with him and and he's revealed the secrets had his back turn he had his back turned to the tent he said that's important because that same thing was to manifest itself in this day as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the coming of the summer man so as the angel had his back to the tent and could reveal what sarah was doing here in our day god's prophets would come to certain cities and he'd have a prayer line come on somebody amen and he'd turn us back to the audience and he would call out things over here and things are there with his back turn why it was the same god manifested himself in this time hallelujah glory to god not somebody reading some little card and trying to trying to conjure up something know this was almighty god manifesting himself here abraham is sitting there listening and god finally said you know what abraham uh there's a reason that i'm here i'm here to fellowship with you but i also got some other business to take care of hallelujah he says now uh them two angels begin to separate from god and abraham they begin to walk off towards sodom god himself stayed back with abraham come on church god himself stayed back with abraham and uh he told abraham uh something here i want to just kind of read this uh genesis 18. let's read this uh let's read verse 15 through 17 genesis 18 glory glory glory hallelujah i love this amen some of the miracles that were taking place during this junction genesis 18 verse 15 through 17 says then sarah did not saying i laughed not for she was afraid and said nay but thou didst laugh hallelujah it says and the man rose up from thence and looked towards sodom and abraham went with them to bring them on the way and the lord said i love this shall i hide from abraham that thing which i do so here you know what it what what we find here amen is a couple of things glory to god how do we who was the prophet in abraham and lost day abraham was the prophet abraham was the prophet and abraham and last day because prophets always come at the junction now we're going to prove amen how abraham was the prophet there's a couple ways that we know one of them is abraham went down to abimelech before the body changed he went down to abimelech and abimelech he told he lied oh my goodness this man of god lied to the king and said this is my sister so abimelech took the man's wife and and he was just thanking god that he finally had this beautiful woman that would be able to bear children from him and he he was just so grateful to god that god had answered his prayer but god came to abimelech in a dream and said don't you touch that woman he said why he said lord the man say that was his sister he said no no no no that's his wife and you better not touch her he says if you do i mean death to strike this place say don't touch that woman oh glory to god i love the way god protected sarah because he made a promise to her and i want to tell you something nobody the devil can't touch you either because god has made a promise to you and they say say he said i thought the man said i was just i said god said i know what he said but restore that man his wife and then he said have him pray for you because he i'm telling you what god said i'm telling you what the lord thought of abraham nah nah abimelech said he's a liar god said he's my prophet [Applause] oh your mistakes cannot change your position i say your failure cannot change your position if you are a son and daughter of god you will always be a son and daughter of god glory to his name hallelujah i don't care how far you went insane that ain't got nothing to do with it god or will you erase all of that he will put it in the blood and when something has been dropped in the blood it's like ain't going into the bleach it is obliterated never to be found again that's why we're walking in our blessings that's why we're not letting the devil hold nothing over our heads we have brought it underneath the blood [Applause] say go go restore that man his wife and have him pray for you because he's my prophet god identified abraham as his prophet and i always like to say this because you know different ones find different mistakes mistakes in the message that's what you call them mistakes and prophets say i'm full of mistakes he's a human being he's a man he makes mistakes i make mistakes you make mistakes we all make mistakes hey man sometimes i tell the story and i don't tell it the same same way every time i don't even think to tell it the same way every time i didn't even know you was holding on to it like that i'm just it's just a story when you said it like this you you put the over here and you put ando come on give me a break right see even in the prophet's ministry even if you found a mistake because abraham was full of mistakes not just a mistake intentional lies and god still say he's my prophet right all right glory to god uh the other way that we know that he was god's prophet because in this scripture genesis 18 17 the lord said shall i hide from abraham that thing which i do all right the word of the lord comes where amen amen surely the lord god will do nothing he would not destroy sodom even though the angels is on their way that it could not be destroyed until god revealed the secret to his servant the prophet [Music] she said the lord god shall i hide from abraham that thing which i do and then when god began to share with abraham what was getting ready to happen come on church are y'all with me he began to share said now you know i don't heard some bad stuff about sodom and i heard some bad stuff about gomorrah yeah and and it and i i'm really sorry that men have come brought themselves to a place like this it says you know the the way that they live and say i'm i'm sending my angels in as investigating angels of judgment and we're going we're going to have to check this thing out to see really how bad it is down there because we heard about it but but we're going to see for ourself he's saying he say now uh and if we can't find if we find what we're looking for that is just as bad as we heard we're getting ready to destroy sodom and gomorrah now abraham knew he was talking to god and when abraham realized destruction was about to happen abraham didn't go back in the house and have another meal he didn't go for seconds abraham began to plead with god can i put it this way abraham had his own prayer meeting god will you spare if it's 50 righteous and then he started he started just having this conversation with god which is fair if it's if it's 50 righteousness the lord said oh yes abraham if i can find 50 i'll spare now god don't get upset with me what about 40 righteous if it's lacking 10 they only got 40. if i find 40 then i'll spare god don't get upset with me what if it's lacking another team and they only have 30 if i if you find 30 would you spend a city he said oh yes if i find 30 i'll spend a city oh lord please don't get upset with me what about if you only find 20 down in the city that's righteous and i can imagine abraham going in his mind and trying to think this one might be righteous i got a loved one over here and he might be righteous maybe his wife is righteous maybe the children are righteous lord i don't know i ain't seen it in a long time but with your spare if you find 20 righteous he said i'll spare for 5 20. things got real quiet abraham said lord [Applause] [Applause] god what about 10. we just spat a city and he wanted to get a confirmation that god would spell 10. if i find 10 righteous i spare my god that's what that's the condition of sodom and gomorrah it was so bad that god couldn't even find 10 christians and i got news for you i ain't got time to read the quote but i'm going to just tell you because we used to hear this one all the time brother jack moore i believe is the one that said and brother branham would repeat it jack moore said uh if god don't destroy america for the same sins that happen in sodom and gomorrah god will have to raise up sodom and gomorrah and apologize i want to tell you right now god ain't apologizing for nothing [Applause] and look you can compromise with sin if you want to you can compromise we all got family members that might be in these situations we all got family and you know what being that their family members you can't stop them from being family members you can't stop them but you can tell them the truth you can tell them true look god ain't pleased with that god don't judge that it's you got to understand there is a spirit that comes into the land in order to manifest the days of lot right there's a spirit that comes into the land to make this happen and and it's it's a it's an evil spirit it's here and if we can see if we can see the devil cutting loose then we ought to be under expectation that god getting ready to cut loose too amen amen glory to god amen amen god could not find ten righteous down there and he had to destroy sodom gamora and and as he was you know he was rushing the angels rushing into the house to get uh a lot and his family said look we got to get to they they they got them into secret places and began to tell them say look this is why we're here this place about to get be destroyed and lot is outside begging with the people because they knocking on this door can you imagine this yeah this is wicked y'all this is wicked they knock on the door say who these men that's in your house like who these men in my house what you doing at my house who these men at your house lot man you don't come down you don't got this position among us now oh we you know no you didn't get that position easily you understand it you know you it didn't come it didn't come easy but a lot you're gonna have to counter yeah you're gonna have to share [Music] can you imagine this and lot said no don't do this these are these are men of god don't do it they didn't even care that these were angels from heaven that's how wicked these people were angels came down and they lusting after angels well i'll say like say oh lord god what is this and you know and and and and the angels had to pull a lot back into the house look now you better come on back in and and here's the other thing about it lot offered his daughters that that that's what the bible said go ahead and read it genesis 19 lie off of his daughters right because uh and the bible say that the daughters were married but their marriage was never consummated now prophet said that lot had sons that's what the prophet said and you know lot sons did not come out my lord his son's never made a lot so you might now remember lot made a decision one day come on he had an opportunity to stay in the planes but he left the planes and it went down to this other area and it impacted his family i love something that my brother always shared there's a preacher walked up to him one time he wasn't serving the lord and preacher just walked up to him and said just start shaking his head looked at him just shook his head like what they say brother i feel sorry for you what so you're gonna be held responsible for your family yeah that's all the preachers say no no more from just left just said that and walked away and that thing just stayed with him for for years i'm gonna be responsible for my family yes you're gonna be respond your wife ain't gonna be responsible but the husband will be responsible for what happens to his family how can we say that go back to the beginning when things went wrong in the garden of eden who whose name did god call now who actually did wrong in the garden but whose name did god call who's responsible the man is held accountable for what happens in his family i know in this in this hour the roles don't reverse but god ain't changed he's the same yesterday today and forever so we as the men will be held accountable for what happens in our families praise the lord all right church glory to god but you know but we had you know here lot made that decision and now his sons don't come out his his wife is so wrapped up in it that you know she finally said you know what um you know i'ma go i'ma leave with you a lot i'm gonna leave and the girls finally dad are we ready to get out here they took off take off running getting out the city but the wife gets so fine she start hearing the screams she just turned and brother not that she turned like this it was what was in her heart i remember brother burley preaching a mess one time you know some must be sitting here in church but our heart be outside and i'm gonna tell you if you don't guard your heart you will end up following it it hurt to be outside somewhere i risked i wish i would you all right you keep on your heart gonna lead you right on out there when you come to christ you got to be satisfied with him [Applause] this life that i'm living i'm satisfied with living i i i was a little different growing up i was a little different see i could i could watch other folk go through trials it's like this if i if we're going down the street you're in a car and i'm following you and i see your car hit this big old pothole and and i see the damage that it's doing in your car there's a couple things i can make some i can a couple decisions i can make one is i'm gonna go through the same pothole and get damage to my car or i'm gonna back up and go a different route i'm the type of guy that backed up and gonna find a different route i don't want to go through the same pain that you went through i learned from your pain brother brother brother brother diggs say we have crash test dummies i didn't want to be a crash test dummy that that you know people watch how to crash affect my body and then i make chat no no no i don't want to be the dummy i want to study the dummy god let me come on out of here we don't have to make the same mistakes that uh the the generation before us made god got a better way for us he's looking for a church without spot or wrinkle and somebody got to be determined i want to be a part of that church let me look at this i'm bringing i'm bringing this to close some of the miracles that happened there in abraham's data the secrets of the heart were revealed when sarah laughed the secret of heart was being revealed um another miracles got kept abimelech from sarah because he made a promise to abraham another thing that happened was the changing of the bodies because their bodies had changed uh when they went down to abimelech abimelech saw a 90 oh 90 year old lady and said i wanted her to be my wife her body had changed abraham's body had changed that was a miracle that happened during that time the blinding of the sodomites was another miracle they couldn't find the door glory god and i pray that they won't find this door either we want to keep fellowshipping i hope you're with me yeah y'all y'all know that y'all know the government gonna change know that right and i already know this type of preaching is what we call hate speech they say that you know you got some real strange ways do i did i read it out of the bible praise the lord it's right here in the scripture i ain't got no strange ways i just got the same ways that god is establishing his word right the blind of the sodomites the rescue of lot and his daughters amen that was you know some of the miracles that happened there this uh paragraph e27 out of junction of time we'll read a few quotes and we'll come to a close the miraculous the supernatural the omnipotent doing the miraculous look at him as during the time of abraham just before the end time look what taken place in the world down in sodom the big city abraham lived in a tent who was the heir of all things lived in a tent so don't wonder the poet can say a tent or cottage why should i care you're heir of all things if you're in christ god has given him the earth and he's the king and we're in him and an heir of all things the omnipotent miraculous and at the junction time notice closely now as we move on into this watch how god did just before the end time locked down in sodom perversion was on the increase men become homosexuals perverted changing the natural course of human nature into perverted ways look at the world today the whole thing has become a perverted dispensation dispensation the prophet speaks the truth here in the message um uh have faith in god this uh uh the prophet says the american people sees him even greater than that i'm not talking about you born again christians says they go around and say well it's some kind of hypnotism it is perhaps maybe telepathy or something something's no wonder the guns are trained on us for judgment we cannot escape judgment i've said this and i say it not to be sacrilegious or to be different but if god lets this nation get by with the sin that it's doing he'd have to raise up sodom and gomorrah and apologize for burning them up that's right god has to remain the same he loves a sinner but he hates sin and he's just and he's sovereign and he must judge sin god will judge sin god's provided way this message god's provided way glory to god amen the prophet goes on and says this says even now till the science is claiming that the earth is bulging out in the middle you've seen that here the other day and heard them talking of it the waters in the north has went down so many feet in the middle of the earth rather than getting deeper in the north and in the south because the earth is bulging out the sun doesn't go around its orbit like it used to everything is indicating that that uh that coming of the lord we're right at the door and remember before one of those bombs can drop i love this promise here because as it was in the days of noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the comments under man god made a a way for noah to come in to the ark god made a way for lot to come out of sodom and god is making a way for the bride to go up in a rapture we're right at the door remember before one of these bombs one of those bombs can drop don't forget this jesus said as it was in the days of noah in the days of lot so shall it be in the coming of the son of man and before noah before any rain fell down noah was in the ark safely before any fire fell on sodom lot was outside and before one bomb can strike at the church we'll be home in glory gone in church i'm looking forward to that amen it won't be long we can count the years as months count the months as weeks count the weeks as days any day now we'll be going home he says be sure just think friends if it's that close how much closer is the coming of the lord because the lord comes before that happens i'm reading another uh quote here out of questions and answers part one praise the lord it says and what was the last sign they had before the promised son that they had waited on all these years come back was god standing in the form of a man and god discerned the thoughts that was in sarah's heart sarah being the church representing the church discern the thoughts that's in the church that was even behind him is that right and immediately after that she changed back to a young man and him a young man and isaac was brought on the scene the promised son i believe you're seeing the last sign that i happened to the church before the rapture god used this prophet amen as a last sign uh you know back term revealing the secrets you know to the people god was in his ministry god certainly used them but the other thing that we're looking for is not just what god did for the prophet also we're looking for what god's given to do for us and it's a changing of our bodies amen one day gravity not gonna be able to hold us down any longer amen we shall be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye we shall be changed this last quote coming out of the junction of time paragraph e 31. we look at the conditions of this world we look at the uh and it's not just you know not just our nation but all over the world i i remember a few years ago i had the opportunity to travel to i want to say it was i think it was ghana i believe it was ghana and uh in ghana and and i i believe this is correct it's either ghana zimbabwe but i think it was ghana but they had it was ghana they had a sign in the airport said that if uh if you were um practicing a homosexual lifestyle say don't even come into the country leave at the airport they didn't welcome it right get leave right now don't come into this country if that's what you're practicing i mean what a sign of the airport so you know it was i'm like wow you know there's something but you know um as i was there in in the country we went out to eat somewhere and and it was kind of in the largest city accra it's like the capital city and uh and as we were getting there at the airport going to some of the restaurants i'm i'm in the parking lot camera going to the restaurant and i see walking through the parking lot somebody practicing homosexual lifestyle somehow they made it past the guards at the airport and they here so i don't care about you putting up signs the spirit will be released in the land all over the world god gonna judge this world for their sin just like he judged sodom and gomorrah amen here in this message junction of time he says there was noah in his time here's israel in their time here's abraham at the next junction between the world the natural and the supernatural angels came down that looked like man glory and stood by abraham the prophet and told him abraham god will perform the supernatural about this time next year according to life i'll visit you your wife 100 years old and you'll bring forth a child i'll show you my power divine healing i'll change you and turn you back to a young man again and i'll change sarah and make her a different person and make her a young woman i i'm the miraculous i'm omnipotent i do the miraculous amen i'll show you my power abraham we're at the junction time the evil spirits are down yonder and sodom yes they're working among the world down there they're working here today gaity and glamour and crack wild jokes now y'all notice they numb but the truth i mean you you just walk up to people they don't even know you never met you one day in their life and they just start telling you some joke oh and it's filthy vulgar joke you gotta you i mean you kind of smiling along with him and you know okay all right hoping this next day later drop the bomb you smile turn to a quick frown like i can't believe you just said that crack wild jokes you have to rebuke him don't tell me nothing like that no more don't don't say that wow jokes when i was just at a at a hotel and the guy started going with something next thing you know me and brother smiling there he's so you know later on tonight y'all can come down to the bar we're not going to the bar my friend we preachers oh i know preachers that go to the bar not these preachers not these preachers we don't i i just told you we're not coming don't force force you to the boss it's a shame before god we i mean living a life and and and every time he would see us after that then he had some christian thing to say all the time now you're a christian huh [Laughter] evil spirits are down yonder and sodom yes they're working among the world down here they're working here today getting glamour and crack wild jokes and all dirty things on radio now that not not can you imagine that this is 1956. brother branham say dirty things on the radio what were they playing in 1956 that the prophet had to call it dirty you want to hear dirty radio you turn it on today you want to see dirty television turn on the day i mean actually in the newspaper when you used to be able to read the article now they just let the curse words fly right in the article and you're just trying to read the next thing you know you oh lord i wasn't planning on reading that now i'm gonna tell you i'm this type of person right if i read something like that and i hear a dirty word a curse word i stop reading that's me i just stop reading i realize that all tables are full of vomit ain't no place clean even in church pastor's cursing in the pulpit i for i actually god forgive me i can't call him a pastor i can't call him a pastor don't leave a leading life like that before the people hirelings cursing in the pulpit gaity and glamour crack wild jokes and and all the dirty things on radio television not even sensitive nothing else and perverting sometimes the gospel to a social affair the whole world has become perverted from the prophet but the same time the world has become perverted the believers become converted [Music] in the lord and the power of god by the working and appearing of omnipotence how that god and his mercy is showing forth these things we thank god amen for his word we thank god for his truth uh we realize that we are at another junction amen but we are prepared to make the right decisions as we turn at this junction and i trust that god will just continue to lead us and guide us amen that we would not just see it just as another sermon but let's see the spirits that's in the land we can see what the prophet was telling us it is manifesting right before our very eyes but as we see all the evil and all the devil say all hell has been turned loose against us we also ought to be under expectation that all heaven will also turn loose on us let's bound the word of prayer god we thank you for your word thank you god for your truth the bible tells us that as many as heard the word they hurt god they believed to him to them gave he the power to become sons daughters of god so lord as people have heard the word i pray that if there's something that causes them to want to repent let them repent right where they are let them get real let them get right with you god lord we want to be ready in this hour there's a dangerous time that we live a very dangerous time and lord we just want to we want to make it not only us but we want to see our families make it we feel like abraham we're praying per adventure god lord there be some righteous lord would you spare and lord we're praying that you would spare our loved ones we we know the time is shorter than it's ever been before we're praying that you would spare we pray that you bring them in from the fields of sin we don't care how far they've gone away lord it's not impossible for them to be drawn back to you god all that the father has given me will come so what help us to remain true to the word and lord and uh are true to you god and father no matter what it is that we'll have to go through lord we know that you'll come through for us you'll manifest yourself you'll prove yourself to us so lord we just want to give you all the glory and all the honor and all the praise thank you for your word that's been spoken to our hearts today it's in jesus name we pray amen amen praise the lord praise the lord amen um i want to do something just a little different here uh today i asked some time ago we had a prophecy to go forth here in the church uh tongues in prophecy and and god told us and that to open our mouth wide that we that he may feel it uh instead open it wider and wider and wider what we have been doing just status we heard the word of the lord and acts you know for those that say anybody had any specific things that happened in your life uh ever since that prophecy went forth i wanted to be able to share testimony so it's very specific to the prophecy not just you know we have testimony service sometimes we'll have to figure out a time where we can do that but i wanted something very specific so i had a brother that i want to just come and come and share a testimony that happened after that a man and he's going to share and then brother solomon will come and close the service and uh and we'll go from there but brother simba would you come at this time and just uh share a quick testimony with the church praise the lord let's say praise the lord as he comes amen brother solomon you can take it from from here god bless you saints so as pastor said i was supposed to be sharing this testimony um a testimony service but he asked me to share today so i'm gonna do just that um so 2020 right uh a year of the covet so it you know it began and just like any other year um there's certain things that you know you're you're praying about and trusting in god to fulfill you know during the course of the year right so just like any other year we my wife and i had things that we were trusting in god for things that we're bringing before the lord in prayer and like i'm sure a lot of us we pray for our finances right we pray for our financial situation we we we welcome the blessings of god when it comes to finances right and i and i i my wife and i were praying about our finances and i i was i was saying to god lord i financially lord i i i want to be good you know i i i just want to be in a good place you know i don't just want to be okay i want to be in a good place and i said as i even said to god i i have no ounce in me that wishes to be filthy rich you can search within my heart there's no ounce in me that wishes to be filthy rich but i just want to be good you know if if something comes up i want to be able to take care of it i don't want to go into debt because i need to you know fix my car or i need to change the tires or ac is out you know i just want to be good that's that's what my prayer was so um as the year began um i remember telling my wife i said you know i don't know what it is this year but i just feel like we're on the verge of breakthrough financially i said i i don't know what it is just it almost feels like it's about to happen right it almost feels like it's right there something's about to happen we're on the brink of a turnaround in our finances um and i said i just can't put a finger on it but and i don't know how it's gonna happen but i just feel like we're on the verge of breakthrough so um having shared that and you know looking for something to happen well something did happen but it was covered you know so it's it's you know just like for many for many um people around the world um we were impacted financially because of kovit my wife lost her job and we took a big hit financially because of that so you know i'm started thinking to myself i'm like man i uh i i you know i feel like we're on the verge and now this has happened you know this you know my wife has lost the job and still that feeling was still inside of me that man we're we're just on the brink of something something happening and i was like maybe you know maybe you know this is just a temporary situation in in a month or so we'll be back to normal you know lockdown and all that in a month like uh uh president trump said by easter you know everything will be gone and you know people be back in the churches and all that and so i was like yeah yeah you know we'll be you know everything will be back to normal and you know we'll be back on track you know trying to look for that financial breakthrough but month after month nothing changed the situation didn't change you know things you know things started happening and financially nothing was changing you know but i still felt within me that we're we're we're right on the brink something's about to happen i and i and i couldn't unders i i didn't know how it was going to happen but i just felt like something was about to happen and month after month nothing did happen and um i don't know how but each month we just made it through each month we just made it through by god's grace and then come november uh beginning of november i think i think it was on the 8th of november when we were in church and the spirit of the lord came down and sister naomi spoke in tongues sister rebecca um gave the interpretation of the tongues now that was you know there was a mighty service and within the interpretation of those tongues um there was an instruction that was given right and the instruction uh was to ask whatever we desired right and he said open your mouth wide and wider and wider now when that happened when the when the interpretation went forth when sister when sister uh rebecca said um as soon as she said in the beginning of it as soon as she said uh you don't have to worry for i am here as soon as i heard that i just lost it right i just lost it and i didn't hear the instruction so by the time the instruction came to open your mouth why you know say whatever you desire i didn't hear it because i had lost it and i was just caught up in the spirit and i was you know just crying and uh yelling and i didn't hear the instruction you know but by god's grace that was the the one of the few sundays uh in 2020 that my wife was able to come to church uh and she heard that instruction all right and as soon as the instructions said you know uh say whatever you will and you know open your mouth wide she um and she was telling me this on the way back home she was like yeah when she said that i was like oh wait they said that and they said uh yeah and uh when when when um that happened you know i i asked the lord for two things and i was like two you know we're in the presence of the lord you ask for two things i'm thinking you know i i you know there's a lot of things that i could have asked for with two things but you know it happens you know it happens to me sometimes when in church and they say you know just say what you want right now and i pray for a thousand things but at that moment i can maybe think of one right so the two things that she said were um the pregnancy um her uh the the pregnancy and the health of our baby uh and then the other thing was our finances and then she said you know when that happened i it it i felt a peace come over me and um she said it to me and she described it as it was like a sisterheady right moment right where she you know she was told to say whatever she desired and she'd receive it right there and then he said as soon as i spoke it right there and then i just felt that it was over and i felt a peace that came over me i was like oh you know praise the lord pray thank god that you came to church today because if you hadn't i would have missed that opportunity right and so we went home and we were just you know just you know happy and just we were just in awe of what you know what had happened lord came down and that was mighty mighty service now two days later uh tuesday morning um i got a call from my from my boss and we're talking as normal and then he goes well simba um uh just wanted to let you know that effective this friday i'm like oh my god it's like effective this friday we're giving you a 15 raise and i'm like man man oh man he said effective this friday we're giving you a 15 and i was i was in shock right and the reason i mean this is something i've been praying for this is something we've been praying for but i was still in shock and it happens sometimes you know you're praying for something you're believing you have full faith but when it happens you're in shock it's like wait so prayer does work you know so i was in shock and one of the reasons why i was in shock was because even though i believe that we were on the brink of breakthrough i did not believe that it was going to come through my job and the reason why i didn't believe that be i i you know i i do certain things on the side and i thought maybe that's the avenue that god was gonna it was gonna use and the reason why i didn't believe it would come through my job because you know the the company just like many other companies when kovit hit the company's been struggling pretty bad and they we even do like um monthly updates now where they kind of tell us you know the financial situation of you know of the company and we we like many other companies we've been struggling throughout the year they even you know let some people go because we were struggling so i did not see the blessing coming from a job so when it happened i just couldn't believe i didn't know what to say and like i said i thought maybe god would bless it through the other things that i do on the side and my boss said um we we've only chosen five people uh out of our team of about a hundred people and by god's grace i was one of the five that were chosen less than 48 hours after uh the prophecy went through and and my wife opened her mouth and spoke and um not only that right but a month later um the same company for my christmas bonus gave me a bigger bonus than i've received in the past five six years in the midst of a pandemic so i just want to say praise the lord for that god did that thing [Applause] praise the lord hallelujah amen amen there's something that happens when two omnipotents amen our pastor was talking about it this morning amen that created characteristics that's in us amen when god came down and proved that he was here that's one omnipotence but then sister ruth being somebody with that creative characteristic within her was another omnipotent that spoke out and it caused things to take place even blessing a a business for brother simba's sake amen five people out of a hundred that number five again that's grace and he provided grace for brother simba praise the lord will you stand to your feet going to worship god a little bit we want to take a hold of everything that our pastor said this morning because we are the people that are supposed to do exploits amen we must recognize who we are so we're going to sing that little song together i know who
