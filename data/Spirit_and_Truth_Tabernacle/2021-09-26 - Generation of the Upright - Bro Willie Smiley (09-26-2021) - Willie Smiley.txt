the question sometimes what did you do in that time instead of crying out to me you don't want to rebuke like jesus said oh yeah of little faith how long will i suffer i believe i'm gonna give you a little testimony y'all can be seated for just a second earlier um you know we've been praying about moving this way we've been praying hard about it and we we believe god so we had a little trouble air conditioning it was right about the time we were getting ready to go on vacation and we had to get the children school clothes and all this and we were prepared had everything set aside for that then we had an issue with our air conditioner and it wasn't cool in the house so we call the air-conditioned man out and it's like mr johnson uh usually this air condition they last about 11 years said uh your house was built 15 years ago so this should have been gone a long time ago he said so what we're going to have to do because with the issue that we were having it was not only cool in the house but while we were away i don't know what state we're in shalom she called and said mama there's water on the floor so when the man came out he said that there's a pan that catches the water and it goes and drains to the outside of the house he said well that's an old pan it's on the inside so when we would wake up in the morning the entire floor was wet so uh i said okay we gonna have to deal with this so brother caleb duran came by and he got to preaching and he started testifying of of god what god was doing with him with the waves and everything with the plane and all of this so that sunday night when i fell asleep um well actually when i woke up this thought kept running in my mind oh yeah of little faith how long will i suffer you so i kept thinking on this i kept thinking on this and i started praying what are we going to do about this air conditioning this man said it's going to be a lot of money because the inside unit and the outside unit has to be fixed so that thought kept hitting me i got up there my devotion i prayed and when i finished praying it hit me and it was just strong oh you have little faith so i went to that air-conditioned thermostat and i said you're gonna run like you did before you gonna run like when you were first put in here so the next morning i got up see if it came back down to 74 once he hit 74 and shuts off 75 it was struggling i said you're gonna obey a few days went by it continued to do that so one night it was on my heart heavy lord do you want us why why is it such a block for us to move to west palm beach if you want us to move to west palm beach i want to lay a fleece before you i'm gonna put a towel in where this where this thing is completely soaked i want it completely dry and the floor to be completely dry if you want us to stay here in palm bay you make the floor wet and make that tower completely wet so the next morning i got up floors dry so i went in where the towel was and the towel was a little damp on the bottom but we never had a problem with the leak since and the air conditioner has been running so i said lord lord that's i put a fleece down but i don't have the answer i said the towel needed to be completely dry but it's damp so i kept thinking on that and i kept thinking on it i thought kept coming it's not time but the air conditioning is running like i don't know why so that that was actually how i ended up getting sick it wasn't fighting corona nothing i got and i cut the grass i came in sweating and everything and it just really hit me that air was so cold [Applause] amen but greater is he that's within us than he that's in the world when brother caleb came he actually challenged my faith that was a challenge because i sat there i'm like brother you saying some things yeah but i believe it i believe you did that brother and i believe god can do that so when i was fighting with that even in my sleep i'm still wrestling with that then oh ye of little faith yeah how long will i suffer you so you don't want that rebuke you want to get up and do what god tell you to do amen you can stand to your feet god bless you amen let's sing one more and

morning gracious father we just come to give thanks and praise for allowing us to be here once again this morning and we just thank you for amen the songs that went forth this morning and just the testimony of of faith lord god uh it it takes faith to stand there and speak to uh an air conditioner and tell it it's gonna run i wish i'd had that same faith i didn't have that faith but solomon had that faith and his still running and i had to get parts replaced but lord you know all things we just want to remember brother jack and the brethren um today and um give them safe travels back home and we'd be careful to give you praise glory and honor for all things in jesus name amen amen let's just get our bibles out this morning it's good to be in the house of the lord we want to remember brother troy and this morning he didn't come purposely he just kind of wanted to uh be cautious some folks on his job were sick so he wanted to kind of lay back and i understand that so remember him in prayer and remember brother jack in prayer i know i text him yesterday and asked him how the services was going he said fine and pray for him he had to preach yesterday i'm not sure if he preaching today but uh just remember them pray to god to get them safe passage and quite sure everything went went well amen um psalms 1 11. you got your bibles y'all pray for me amen this morning you have it say amen it says uh the first verse praise ye the lord i will praise the lord with my whole heart in the assembly of the upright and in the congregation the works of the lord are great sought out of all them that have pleasure therein his work is honorable and and gracious and glorious in his righteousness and do it forever he has made his wonderful works to be remembered the lord is gracious and full of compassion he has given meaning to them that fear him he will ever be mindful of his covenant he has showed his people the power of his works that he may give them the heritage of the heathen the works of his hands are verity and judgment all his commandments are sure they stand fast forever and ever and are done in truth and upright rightness he sent redemption unto his people he has commanded his covenant forever holy and reverend is his name the fear of lord is the beginning of wisdom a good understanding have all they that do his commandments his praises is endures forever now let's before you be seated let's move down to psalms 112 because they kind of go together i'm probably not going to get done but uh we'll we'll get started and maybe see how the lord leads us the next time we have the opportunity to minister but he says praise ye the lord blessed is a man that feareth the lord that delight is greatly in his commandments his seed shall be mighty upon the earth the generation of the upright shall be blessed i'll just stop right there may the lord add a blessing to the reading of his word this morning will be seated um we we want to use as a title this morning the generation of the upright it's been a this has been a scripture that i was i've kind of just uh been toiling over for some months now i was talking to brother jack about it he was like doc preach it he always encouraged me like that man gone and but uh i just had had the inspiration to really uh uh just uh approach it and i think any minister knows that you know god can give you something but everything's got to be at the right time you know brother solomon was saying that god told him it ain't the right time you know one thing i'm i'm convinced about when when it's the right time things have just happened organically you don't have to force it you don't have to you don't have to do anything amen uh uh uh it'll it'll just everything will just work out all the dominoes are just fall in your favor amen i believe that it's things that you know that we i still have before the lord but i i realized i can't make anything happen you know one of the things you you begin to learn as a christian is to just uh get out get out the way and let the holy ghost do the winning uh that's a song i'm not sure if sister burns wrote that or sister lewis just sister louis just get yourself out of the way that's our biggest problem we we we think we bigger than god and we can god don't need our little bitty help anytime we get in the way we just mess stuff up but um um this morning i want to uh look at this scripture um i i want to maybe just y'all give me a few minutes this morning and i kind of have to approach things a certain way and and kind of build because that's i'm built different than brother jack and brother kwaku he be different than me and and all the races that brother jerry's a little different than me i just you know as as i'm looking at scripture and i'm writing and scribbling down little things that god that god given me uh as i'm as i'm studying and looking at the scripture and uh i over just over the years i i learned to approach scripture and study in just a certain way and and uh i'm i'm always looking for patterns right because like the scriptures say i'm god and i don't change uh so so in studying i'm all the time i'm looking for patterns i'm i'm looking for for certain things in the scripture amen to identify myself with because i want to find myself in the scripture right amen and and as as i'm looking at the things of god i want to make sure amen certain things are identified certain certain things are are there right it ain't you know so much just coming to church but you know and studying the bible that's good but it's it's things that uh we we want to know and grow and and begin to uh uh understand and it's like knowing who we are that that's a big thing sometimes we don't think about it like that but just knowing who we are in the natural and the spiritual we struggle when we don't right we we struggle in the natural when we don't know who we are we struggle in the spiritual when we don't know who we are is that right amen but but once we begin to understand and it's just all growth it's all maturity uh that that's the thing that begins to settle us bring us to a place where we could take a deep breath and say it's gonna be all right is it right amen and and then also knowing knowing what we are part of right you because you know we're living in an age now where where young men and young women too they they getting gangs and different things it's because they don't know you know their family pedigree and and and who they are and and what they you know all these things entail right and even a lot of times they get into something they don't really know what they're part of we we go we go and we join we join sororities and we we get involved in a whole lot of stuff and and really don't know what we're part of we we only know about about you know what they tell us but at the core a lot of these things are demonic satanic satanic influences as you as you you you get to the top of the food chain you start realizing but it ain't what i thought it was like so so if if i'm a part of something if i'm if i'm a part of you know uh uh uh a gathering an assembly i want to know you know what i'm a part of right i want i want to know what i'm saying amen too glory to god well i'm in the well if i'm in the message i want to know why i'm in the message and why this thing is so important to me and and why what's the benefit package right come on i'm starting to feel good why am i part of this why am i why do i want to be identified with this how is this thing going to work for me why are they why are they saying this that and the other why are they believing in a prophet why are they believing this and why they saying it's a message church and all those different types of things and how how can i how can i make this stuff a man run through the scripture that they're talking about well praise god i'm starting to feel him yeah right don't don't just come in just to sit here what'd you say well i'm at the church and brother john yeah brother jack's a great man i thank god for brother jack you know i often i often sit back and i think about him and i say you know but i enjoy him because he's got such a good handle on things just a real good perspective on things but that's just not good enough for me as an individual i want to know what i'm a part of and and i want to see this thing make sense and the things and the things that the prophet of god ministered on i want to see it in the scripture right i want to see a dovetail through the scripture and i want to i want to make sure it makes sense according to the scripture right come on not my opinions not my feelings not my emotions none of that right but but i want to see myself amen in the scriptures i want to be able to see amen what i am believing based upon the word of god i'm still going somewhere i'm just kind of you know i got a few notes that i scribbled right amen and and this is important for we got young young young people growing up in the church just don't grow up in the church [Music] just don't sit on a pool know why you're here well my mama brought me here my dad yeah i took my children to church too i took them the meetings i took them all over the place that wasn't good enough right because at the end of the day i'm still believing god for him i'll leave that alone right but but that but that's not a good enough singing is not good enough all these things are rolling on the floor and crying that's all these things ain't good enough you got to know by understanding what you're a part of and why because that's you that's becomes your anchor when when when the enemy comes in like a flood that raises the standard up for you that solidifies everything for you i'm there because of this i'm there because of this this scripture says this this scripture over here ties with this scripture titled description times with this scripture times with that statement titled this scripture and that's why i'm here right glory to god not a feeling not emotion not gifts and all of that no because i see myself in the scripture i see the ministry i see the pastorial ministry i see the deacon ministry i see every ministry based upon the scripture see amen glory to god what we are part of what's promising right and what's important in the scripture to god right we got to understand you know because because you know we we get especially in the the generation that we're in you know we we go on folk on a lot of feelings and and all of that and that stuff just bothers me sometimes right it's not about you know uh our feelings and i think and i thought yo how could we place our thoughts into this thing that's where we where we run into problems we went into trouble and we start our struggle well i thought no find the word on the thing base your feelings on the word base your decisions on the word right glory to god because your feelings your emotions and all these things can deceive you is that right then that was still like a roaring lion seeking who he may devour i ain't even got to the scripture yet but i'm coming right glory to god amen no no no because everything ain't pleasing to god we we live in an age of inclusions and we got all kind of filth we got all kind of nonsense and all of that kind of stuff and you know and and the church this i get so sick and tired of that nonsense it's like this either you're going to be a part of it you're going to believe it or you're not right see this this word is for the redeemed it's for the believer right and it might just not have no no place for our opinions and our feelings and things of that nature right glory to god amen see that those are the things that you know i look i'm looking at even when i approach the gospel i don't care about people feeling i don't care about what you think about me and none of that is is that right amen i just want to know who i am what's going to be pleasing in the guard and if if it's pleasing to god i'm gonna be all right all right now let's let's kind of dig some more y'all all right this morning hey man i i can just get i i i'm just a messenger boy you know i just give my inspiration what he gives me i just jot these little things down and just tell them to help me say it you know because folk get to looking at you and looking hard and trying to stare you down well i ain't even intimidated by that sometimes people must think that you know they ain't intimidating i've dealt with tougher people than y'all so i'm not intimidated by stairs i i just want for people to just kind of get on board and ride with me for a few minutes i'm gonna be out of here a little bit let me let me i ain't like brother jack and troy they had a time up here i i'm still old school but now now watch watch the psalmist in the description i remember we were talking about the generation of the upright and and and i'ma get down to a point because i want to dwell on on that uh that point of upright but but let's start here it says praise you the lord i that's personal right i will praise the lord can you say that this morning it's an individual thing right i'm going to praise the lord now i don't know what you come to do y'all know the song i don't know what you come to do but i come to praise the lord i come to clap my hands i come to do if i could my little dance y'all gotta talk to me well i got to the place where you know we're so starchy and cute and pretty and all that ain't cool we can't even hardly dance before the lord all right man growing up in church folk knew how to oh that's penny costume but that pentecost be having a good time is that right oh glory i think if we if we did more that man get some of this arthritis and rheumatism and all this kind of stuff about us get to moving our legs a little bit more and moving on and glory to god so the bernie's know what i'm talking about she grew up in a pentecost holding this church you know boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom you you just automatically know they they be setting you up do in every church have a sister nelly next thing you know is once they get started and did everybody yo glory i'm just trying to loosen y'all up a little bit i might give me a step while i'm up here [Applause] we need to bring back some of that i'm just going to say this i remember when i first got saved man we used to shout the best of our ability if we couldn't do nothing else man we should jump and try to touch the ceiling we would jumpers me jack troy and all that i know we don't got a little bit older and everything but if we can't do nothing but jump jump for the lord that's that's what the world tells you jump jump y'all know what i'm talking about some of y'all still listening on music let's jump jump for the lord [Music] y'all think i'm crazy i ain't just gotta have no fish boat i ain't just got here i've been here 59 years but praise you the lord i will praise the lord watch this with my whole heart church we cannot be partial i think for a long time we've all put god secondary is that right to everything else on our list but you god will not accept that right remember what's what's important in scripture to god god is not going to accept a second place half-hearted worship half-hearted praise praise mixed with a lot of stuff come on now we going somewhere you can't praise god like that god is not going to accept it right look the bible lets us know when when there's things there don't bring that to god i said i'll go back get those things right fix this fix this fix this do this do this and now come back see so so when people start telling you all this stuff that they'd be trying to push down and shove down your throat you're like dude back up that's not gonna you can't pass that through a thinking man's filter right thank god we got a filter thank god we we had a man that that that was able by a gift by scriptural calling was able to go up and get the mind of god and bring it back down and say this what pleases god right this this what pleases god that other stuff don't please god right and and and you know and we all humans we all make mistakes we all still moving up i got my little struggles too but but i don't want i don't want my struggles to be uh the thing that you know i always look to where god you know y'all gotta say i know but but that's transforming power in the word of god god at some point god like you got to get there though bro you got to get that sus well you know now your family this you could you proud of another family how many how many got the holy ghost don't raise your hand well you don't done it anyway see right then we're part of a a whole nother family you know i'm i'm part of a smiley family and uh that kind of rough folk right that that's that's the old man though i realized amen i've been married to the revealed word i'm from another kingdom and and and i realized man that there's a fight the smiley versus the baptism by the holy ghost the nation the character of god i'm and i'm fighting i'm in a real war i don't know about y'all because that thing we want to try to take over and i'll be saying no i can't let you take over i can't let you i can't let you drive the car because you ain't got no seats i'm better off as long as the holy ghost is in control of the vehicle oh glory to god make me feel like being in the old church with wooden flows huh hey man you don't want smiley to take over my grandma used to tell you boy i will cut you quicker than i could spit you don't want that to take over cut you quick as i could spit that mean before she could uh papa y'all know what i'm talking about you look back you know brother talked about his family his island was so bad till people would see him coming because he was a branham they crossed the street that's a bad family y'all know what i'm talking about you know and here in west palm beach they used to be a family they still around somewhere to parcel man those people were scary that's no joke dumb people scary y'all some of y'all know what i'm talking about oh glory to god but but okay so he says i will praise the lord with my whole heart now in the assembly of the upright right then that word assembly is it means a small group you know a small gathering something that's intimate or something of that nature but uh i want to dwell on the upright because i thought it's being a part of the generation of the upright right because you know folk want to be a part of this generation we're the generation of this and we're the generation of that uh okay you can have that i guess i was a baby boomer or something one of them but but i want to be identified with that i i want to know because see this is my identification right this is the thing that we we hold on to and you you want to see things as they move through the scripture right and and so um when we think about upright the definition is of a person or are their behaviors strictly honorable or honest right and and also i was just kind of you know meditating and so we i started thinking about something you know genesis is the seed chapter of the bible and and every seed that's been sown was sown in genesis that's the prophet he makes that statement right amen and and so you can you can find a man uh patterns and i and i like to do this i always kind of go back and just kind of move it forward because if he's god he cannot change he can't stop something here and get over here and it's something different he can't start in the old testament with with a certain uh uh a character or a certain makeup and then get over to the new testament and it's something different see that's how we think but that's not the truth right glory to god see i i was maybe uh somebody they can pull this up for me i'll give me a second uh it's in the 70 weeks of daniel uh uh verse 66. here brother branham he's he's talking about he's talking about um uh time in the scriptures and different things like that and how they used to tell time by the stars and all that uh but i want to bring out a point if y'all got it it's dangerous 70 weeks it's 1961. we started their product catch up he says now this i can only say as myself speaking i believe that back before the uh uh and brother branham let's keep in mind something brother branham taught in shadows and types right and and we we we are tight with the earth right because we we was informed void and all of that and darkness cover the face of the deep you go back to spoken word the original see some of those things and you study how you catch it all right but i just want to i want to bring out just just one point from here it says and i believe that back before the anteluvian destruction back in the days back in the days of job and so forth that they kept the time by the stars and he says and when we understand or are back before that time watch this now because because i believe that we're typed here he says uh uh uh uh back uh boy back before that time that the world stood upright right the world stood up right i believe the first the first uh uh uh family the first church stood up right ain't nothing deep y'all don't have to worry about oh my god now it's just something real simple just something that that i was looking at and i thought my that's all right amen it stood it stood upright and i'm saying this because the principles of god don't change right he said the world stood upright adam's even the serpent stood upright come on the serpent stood upright it was the judgment that put him on his belly but he amen he could he was so close to man he didn't have a soul he had a place for a soul but he didn't have a soul he could communicate he could reason he could do all he could talk come on now well that's close thank god for revelation right but he says that the world stood upright and then watch this in the sin of man right the overthrow of the world and it tilted right and it's not in its its right position right because of sin we weren't in our right position either because of the way we came thank god for being redeemed come on the blood the blood the blood the blood the blood come on come on amen it stood us up right right because sin sin has you tilted see the overthrow of the world and it tilts tilted and the floods came therefore we have the great ice glaciers and so forth and all the tops and and of the bottoms it's full of ice we know that and the earth does not set straight up it soaked it set tilted that shook it from out from where the moon and the stars were they was looking at and it misplaced then he says you could not keep time by it anymore because it's it's setting lopsided set and tilted back therefore it would not hit the stars at the same time because it's out of cater to them stars you understand i believe that's what it is it's a whole lot of tilted folk right but you can be tilted i want to be upright because that's the thought of god right amen the the first family right the first earth in the earth because this is the earth y'all ought to preach with me come on this is the earth everything in the mind of god stood upright that's why redemption has been so important understand that i am redeemed what redemption does when we all lopsided and and all of that it pulls us straight it pulls us straight up because because that that that just meets in in the mind of god the intentions of god thank god god knew what would take place but thank god god is bigger he's bigger tasha cobb sang a song that talks about being bigger he's bigger he's big enough no matter no matter how tilted we are how we leaning how lopsided we are he can still pull us up right come on i'm a living witness right i'm a living witness right oh glory to god see brother browner makes another statement he's just touching on this uh scripture here uh he says the lord uh the lord is gracious and full of compassion he says first in the mind of the psalmist was god's uh great oh no i think i jumped ahead of myself i ain't gonna read that but let's get back on the scripture y'all still with me right just being being being in the generation that's that's up right right amen okay so he says i i will praise the lord with my whole heart in the assembly of the upright and in the congregation now now now this next verse is to me is is really powerful because because a lot of times you know i don't i don't think that um we we really sit back and really ponder how great the work of god is has been and is is that right we we we just kind of go through day to day and and and not realize man how important god is right how important it is being a part of god being married to god is right we i'm guilty we take we take christianity right for granted a lot of times come on i'm a living witness i'm gonna put myself in there sometimes i take for granted the great work of god and what this great work is and what god has been doing in me through me and for me because i'm gonna tell you something mama sap saying the song never would have made it i wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for the great work of god i'm telling you i wouldn't i wouldn't be here today right but god do it's the work of god it's not the work of smiling it's the work of god because you know we all go through so much in the flesh and in our mind you know like cynthia says yeah that stuff going on in mind we all she ain't by herself come on we like oh yes nelly praise the lord she had that we all got we all got our struggles we brother brother adam lets us know that even even the apostle paul when he was converted he said boy when i would do good evil is always presence the things that i i said i wasn't gonna do lord have mercy even even the prophet of god he makes his name he say god directly tells some things to do and he do the opposite wow that's something that no having this kind of relationship that he had with god where angel would come and you still would do something different i remember the time that the problem of god tells the story about being over in africa and and he had a direct word from god don't follow these guys over here go this way don't go that way go this direction he let him see that's why i'll let people influence me i love you but i ain't gonna let you lead me come on all feelings and emotions you and your feelings and emotion go the way you want to go but i'm gonna go the way that god has lead me by the word i'm going the way that i can see by the word come on all the feeling and all that you know i ain't mad at you you know nothing like that i ain't gonna fight with you if you if you're saying that i feel like to do this i feel let it go this way i feel let it go that by all means don't let me stop you wear your mask and don't let nobody tell you nothing different wear your mask i'm not right with it i don't got used to it i remember when back when it first started out like [Music] i had to get it took some getting because you know you weren't used to it i've been saved for 30 something years you know and i ain't never came to church and seeing people's eyes covered up looking like ninjas and all that kind of stuff you know you can't you can't tell what's going on you know whether they smiling or they saying quit brother smiling i can't tell what y'all doing i got to try to catch a oblique in a sup like that you know since a human god got a sense of humor amen but it says the works of the lord are great sought out of all them that have pleasure therein right and see i'm gonna stop here for a second i got a quote somewhere in here with the prophet of god talking about god right the same scripture god's god's got to be upright also if if if this is a requirement right god can't be anything less than what he's requiring of us if we can't trust him if we can't have confidence in it if if he's partial and all of that but we got problems we might burn this like they burned the flag come on come on this is the only thing that i can really clearly have confidence in right people try men smart men try to bring uh color and and this and that into it this bible ain't got no where man wrote it it's like come on did you really read the scripture it said men wrote as they were inspired of the holy ghost it ain't something that they did on their own abraham wouldn't have talked about lying it's stuff in here that y'all know what i'm talking about y'all you know we we do things we ain't gonna tell nobody and write that in the book uh for the whole world generation after generation not the generation read what the father of faith he what huh right but you got to understand the rest of the story see he did that he told he told his he told his wife to lie right but then god and his great works come on the scene he says he stops he stops a man that was upright the king was upright come on he says you know what i know the integrity of your heart and beca but god's good though god know if we plan or not god said i know then because i know that this is why i stopped you i stopped you because you didn't know but i knew that they deceived you but don't do it restore to that man his wife and this this this is this is this here still you got to get used to it and then let the liar pray for you come on go let then go if you want to be blessed see you know god god does i was listening to this tape on my way here uh god don't change and how he do things in unusual ways that's so unusual to the way that we think right you mean tell me this man deceived me i wouldn't even done it well you know but they deceived me i was going to take her now i got i got to give her back and the liar got to pray for me huh but it was so much deeper than that but in the way that i looked at it you know i was thinking like really y'all would have to like they didn't see me and i got to let him man i wouldn't have no confidence in him praying for me hey y'all gotta talk to me come on now many ministers that i'm falling and y'all get the grumbling and this and that man and i don't know wanna hear them preach man i am man please you man he failed huh i would say something but i'm gonna leave that alone some things some people's ideas and thoughts don't even run through the scripture we we just being feelings and emotions right well he can't do this show me i'm one scripture that alone i said i'm gonna leave that alone i'm gonna leave that to brother jack this ain't my pulpit your brother jack pulled pit i want him to have confidence in me when he gone but but i'ma tell you something i don't be on board with everything right a man can mess himself up but let me leave that alone be obedient smiley okay y'all still with me how much time i got okay so he says his work see god is identified by his characteristics right we are identified by our characteristics we are we we are identified amen you know jesus jesus in the scriptures when he was on the scene he says look look you're your father the devil why why could he make a statement it was because the works the cat he said man you see all people seek to take my life that ain't being up right right when if you trail in the serpent right you'll see where the seed of the serpent had landed right uh amongst a group of religious people right it was the religious people that that amen cried out give us barabbas the church the church cried out give us be robbers let the blood amen of this man be upon us and our children we don't care we just want him dead y'all ought to preach with me huh they just wanted him dead right and and and and the brother was like man that's a just man i don't see that wrong with y'all show we want it we want it bad we got it they ain't know what they were doing that was under another spirit right jesus jesus was watching them and jesus identified him by a man their character because the murder and spirit didn't come forth from adam to to enoch and on down and on down and down that come from kane was the first murderer right the serpent seed i believe that alone too y'all all right glory to god they were identified so so if if we're following scripture right if if we're looking at god and if we're looking at if we're looking at the church the characteristics has got to be the same well god is one way and we another and then we talk about christ and bride farms and we acting crazy we out in the parking lot scuffling no come on now church right says his work is honorable and glorious huh and and his righteousness endures forever he has made his wonderful works to be remembered that's a that's a powerful statement right man i'ma tell you something church i i can just look back man on my life you know as a christian and just remember all the great things god has done for me can't y'all can't y'all all all the listen listen you know eric don't mind me god putting brother jack in her path right amen and then then giving them uh sarah and rebecca i get them confused sometimes i've only known them since they were baby i get them confused right and giving them sister carbs as a mother-in-law right well they just no predestination predestination ordained a day of god you know brother jack has told little little stories that i know brother jack i mean me and brother jack used to hang tough back in them days right glory to god but but in the midst of the devil trying to bring bring him this take this brother dad god said um that ain't gonna work that ain't what i got for you cause cause cause knowing knowing that down the line right when we when we flipped over in that car we had no idea we would be preachers we we we had and i'ma tell you something we wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the work of god since the birth of them when they came and saw that car they was in disbelief they was like and and all i had was a scratch on his hand he had a scratch on her head and and we were walking around when they sat us down because they thought we was in shock we weren't in no shock i wasn't in no shock right i was like mike and we jack jack drove crazy back there if you ever rode with jack when he was like 18 19 years old boy you had to make sure you had your insurance policy paid up you had to really have a prayer life to ride with brother jack back then i used to be like bro i got it i got here weaving in and all the cars and all that you like boy you my dude and i ain't got no car so i gotta ride with you huh that day that day we went down that street and uh jack where you going church all you have to do is keep going down nine to five cup probably just like boom boom we at church i want a shortcut

never never could have imagined right amen that god would clean me up put me in a position look at the favor the favor god has given us y'all take things for granted but god has given this little church favor with people people want you to come people want to come people don't want to go everywhere people don't want to deal with everybody god give you a man and place him in the pulpit and give that man favor that's god that's not the man that's god in the man giving favor with churches people tuning in tuning in tuning in that's favor that's the favor of god that's the work of god well i

worked for me this message i'm gonna just say it just like this this message this revealing has worked for me thus far i ain't going nowhere church why because you know and i don't have no bible training you know sometimes you go and you preach and ministers actually well what school you went to doc y'all know the nomination of the preacher they got they own lingo doc that doc what school you went to boy neology i i took the book i took those little books out of the hand at the seventh angel and i started eating them it was bitter it was better i remember the first time man i i listened to marriage and divorce i had to cut it off several times i it was bitter it it was a bitter pill of sweet to swallow it were rough man it was rough i was like man i could a man say something like that but you had to catch it in between the line it was a godly sister versus ungodly see and it's it's the it's the righteous the upright verses to tilt it come on now it's the it's the upright seat the upright versus the wicket see this this is a wicked evil and adulterous generation see here's your identification oh you're part of the generation of the upright the honorable the upstanding glory to
