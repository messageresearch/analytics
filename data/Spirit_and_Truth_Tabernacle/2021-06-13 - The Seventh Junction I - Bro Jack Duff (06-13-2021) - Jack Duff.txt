nothing like the presence of the lord i was grateful for the specials that went forth man and um it's good to hear from mama man this morning um just thank god for the anointing because it just gives you strength you know and and just um everybody entering in and set up a real nice platform for sister amanda to come with a little worship and um i'm i'm just i'm a worshiper i i like it i just like worship and one of these days i ain't gonna get tired of it i'm looking forward to that and you know just um the song service everything just is so wonderful amen it's good to be in the presence of god ma'am let's just have a word of prayer amen lord we uh adore you we honor you you are king of kings and lord of lords no one like you and uh father how blessed we are to be welcomed into your presence we feel the brush of angels wings we see the glory on each face the songwriter tells us surely the presence of the lord is in this place so father as we have come on this morning gathered in the precious name of jesus we have already felt the anointing and the worship and father we are turning our attention towards the word we asking that the holy spirit would not only go before us but come along with us god and make the word plain uh reveal from heaven today god to hearts that need to hear and father you know the needs of all of your people so i pray that you would uh just meet the needs of each and every one uh god we um i trust that you have your way in this portion of the service we ask that you hide us all behind the cross may we not be seen but may christ be on display today in jesus christ's name we ask him a man amen just if you don't mind just get your bibles um i'm turning with acts chapter 2 and i want to just i know that brother solomon prayed for his sister and his grandmother we want to also join in that at the end of the sermon um sister louis just asked that if she could just stand in the gap for her daughter before she goes the surgery and we want to honor that and i believe um sister shirelle is standing in a gap for her grandmother and um i thought it was very uh appropriate you know when we stand in the gap for others and offer prayer we are acting uh the same way christ has already acted uh because he stood in the gap for us at the cross right um and and i'm saying this uh because as we preach and if there's uh a situation that you know you want to stand in the gap for somebody else you're certainly welcome to do that when we pray with our sisters at the end of this sermon but hopefully our faith will be anointed amen in such a way that we'll believe god for the miraculous because at the junction um we're supposed to experience the miraculous amen amen do you know a person don't even have to be a christian to get healed they don't have to be a christian to get healed if they want to keep their healing that's why the scriptures say go and sin no more right if you want to keep your healing then you have to become a christian but uh but we want to we want to exercise our authority as believers amen um this morning so we'll we'll preach the word of god and after that we'll have a time of prayer for uh these needs and if you have someone in your heart that you want to just bring amen you're welcome to do that amen acts chapter 2 starting at verse 14 praise the lord and uh the bible reads but peter standing up with the eleven lifted up his voice and said unto them ye man of judea and all ye that dwell at jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words but these are not drunken as ye suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel and it shall come to pass in the last days saith god i will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and all my servants and on my handmaidens i will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy and i will show wonders in heaven above and signs in the earth beneath blood and fire and vapor of smoke and the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before that great and notable day of the lord come it's come to pass that whosoever shall call in the name of the lord shall be saved amen the lord and a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated amen in the presence of the lord praise the lord amen so the lord has been good to us amen and and um uh we have taken a journey uh since beginning of this year um talking about the seven junctions and today amen we come to the seventh junction um and you know a i started off the year by saying that a junction is actually where two roads intersect or two ways actually come together and i thought it was just appropriate for the holy spirit to lead us down this journey amen and talk about junctions and uh and we had two churches intersect we had two churches join right uh and and and and i want to say that um this has been to me the smoothest intersection could i call it junction it's been the smoothest junction that that i've seen and i i mean you know you you you expect the devil to try to do something but for the most part the devil has been kept at bay and and i'm grateful because you know i i'm sharing with different people like man it just seemed like the church has been in revival since the beginning of the year and it's just a a real wonderful anointing that is in the house of god and i'm grateful to be experiencing this junction right i'm grateful to be experiencing brother brother smiley brought to us a man of thought on uh unity right at the seventh junction see he was he was already ahead of me he said unity not just unity at the junction but unity at the seventh junction hallelujah there's a message in the title right and uh you know because the seventh junction what we're gonna realize is that this junction deals with us hallelujah hey see we can look back in scripture and and see different people and and what their their role was and you know it's like uh if we could just put it like this it's like a great big drama and uh and and in the drama there are different scenes and actually i can call it like this different junctions hallelujah and when the curtain swings closed amen a new scene is developing and when the curtain swings open some new players step out on stage hallelujah somebody so in the first scene noah and his ark stepped out on stage come on somebody glory to god but the scene closed amen and they began to move some things around and in the background and and then when the curtain reopened again moses came forth with the children of israel to cross a red sea and let me tell you something that that junction they saw miracles that nobody had ever seen before glory to god but on moses to sing clothes the curtains closed but behind the curtains they was doing some other things some arranging was taking place and abraham and lots tap talk y'all gonna preach with me today abraham and lot came out from behind the curtain and god was revealing himself in the flesh of a man when he said i'm gonna visit sarah at the time of life but there come a time where the scene closed with abraham and sarah lot then the next guy that come on the scene they was getting this part ready and this guy had a great job to do i'ma tell you his he he was he was anointed i mean he was so anointed the spirit that was on this man was so anointed that god decided to use that anointing five times oh i hope you're with me now the anointing that was on this man god said this is a powerful anointing it says i'm going to use it five times in scripture and he used it on elijah and then elisha said i want a double portion of your spirit so he used him elijah and then john the baptist came on the scene hallelujah and god used that anointing again until the baptist but then there's a let me go to the fifth time i'm gonna skip the fourth time i'm going to the fifth time there are two witnesses according to the book of revelation that are supposed to come back during the tribulation and these witnesses will be elijah and moses it does not give their name but the reason we know who it is because their ministries are identified in scripture but at the fourth time that this ministry supposed to be used is supposed to come in this day in the seventh junction we'll go further the scene closed it was elijah and the 450 prophets of hell to god that asked about fire let them be god that was the fourth junction but then the fifth junction came and the and the curtain opened up again and this time we saw something that we all longed to see we saw our savior we saw our master we saw our redeemer how we saw our deliverer we saw our king oh come on somebody amen i mean everything that i needed i found inside of him my protector my provider my way out of no way my my open door when every other door is closed hallelujah my my my bridge over troubled water my alpha my omega my beginning my ending my everything in between praise god my encourage and my strength hey my director glory when everybody else leave me he promised never to leave me right everything i need i found in him the scene opened up in the fifth junction and we saw our lord and savior jesus christ and brother branham said that was a great junction that was that was a great junction amen and the reason was great because it was the first coming of our lord and savior jesus christ but you know he went to a grave he died he rose again but the scene closed and you would have thought it would have been all over but then the church ages began that's what we see on this board the church ages starting in the days of paul going through to the days of iranians and martin of columbia lutheran wesley the church ages begin to unfold after the death of our lord hallelujah because before his death he was only dealing with the jews but the gentiles were being called out a people for his namesake and we are that people they were coming through the gentile church ages paul himself had to tell the jews they were turning to the gentiles because the jews rejected the gospel they were the jews are the one that put christ on the cross but paul said we're turning from you and we're going to the gentiles and we've been receiving the gospel ever since that time but now we get to the point the seventh church age and we got the name there branham william marion branham is the messenger that came today this is this these stars are the stars in the hands of jesus revelation chapter 1 declares it revelation 2 and 3 talks about the different ages and the different spirits that people have to contend with during those ages and i want to tell you every evil thing that they contended with in paul's day every evil spirit that was in iranian state and murders that columbia luther wesley all those spirits are compiled and they're here today and how luther had to keep his head above fanaticism glory to god and we've been challenged with the same thing in this hour oh hallelujah so the scene closed amen uh there after jesus appeared on the fifth junction but the sixth junction is when martin luther and john wesley were coming on the scene god used their ministries to bring light back to the church but i tell you to sing close after john wesley and now we find ourselves at the seventh junction which is the second coming of the lord jesus christ now just stay with me here i want to read a little bit amen i want to tell you that you're living in this seventh junction and i want to tell you another thing that this junction that you're living in is the greatest of all the junctions the seventh junction is the greatest of all the junctions now you know before i read this quote let me just kind of inject something here god always has better plans than man god always has better thoughts than man right when we were in school we had a man the track team and uh sometimes you have what you call a relay race where you have to take the baton you have to hand it to the next man glory to god and that man has a takeoff and he has a you know start running when we picked our teams for track hallelujah hey man we did not put the slowest man on the team as the anchor he was not going to be the anchor actually what we'd do is we we would sandwich him in the middle we're going to get somebody real fast to come out of the blocks right i mean we want this fella to try to get us just a little edge because you know at the time of the the passing of the time things can go wrong if i leave the box a little bit too early if the other man get that a little bit too late then the baton does not get to my hand before i take off i have to backtrack we don't need no backtracking that'll cause us a delay so we don't put the slowest man a man at the front or at the end we might put him in the middle god is smarter than us and through seven ages a baton has been passed hallelujah the baton of the word of god has been passed through seven ages and finally gets to this last age underneath the eagle anointing brother we got the baton sister we got the baton and we ain't dropping the baton we ain't dropping our standards with the word of cut we gotta keep it high we gonna run this thing to the finish line we gonna run it to the rapture you see this is where we are and god had confidence in us that we were his strongest we were his best i'm talking about all the stuff you're going through in your life all the mistakes that you're making god see you in my past because he could have caused you to live in a totally different time period but he brought you to the earth at this time you don't control when you come and when you go your birth was not a mistake right you were here back because god predestinated for you to be here this hour all right hallelujah god's best god strongest god's cream of the crop oh hallelujah all right here are the seventh junction here when their eyes were open let me just read this praise the name of the lord it says how many read the sermon i think i skipped but that's okay maybe that's where the holy spirit want me to be how many read the sermon when omnipotence speaks uh miracles happen glory to god says did you uh you believe that certainly omnipotent spoke at every junction and when the church cooled off and then omnipotent spoke he said miracles take place and this is the junction of all junctions this is the end time the end of the whole history of the world is right now at hand so you can expect hallelujah somebody amen i want to raise your expectations if if this is amen the end of all history amen he says so you can expect omnipotence to speak and you can expect glory to god you can expect the greatest and mightiest miracles that ever happened on earth will happen in the next few years to come if jesus tears it will be now i don't take it lightly that a man was released from hospice you don't hear things like that often a man released from hospice care to celebrate his 82nd birthday see you can expect glory to god i'm reading it for you right now i'm telling you what a prophet said this is thus says the lord you can expect glory to god the greatest and mightiest miracles that ever happened on the earth will happen in the next few years to come if jesus terry it will be now look at this then watch for satan to raise up his two when all heaven turns loose oh church i wish we could catch this from our spiritual eyes when all heaven turns loose all hell turns loose too and if you're not careful you get caught up in the wrong cycle because there's two moves happening at the same time all heaven is moving testimony after testimony after testimony you anointing nothing but god doing that no man can do it but then here comes a man all hell moving at the same time and you know what hell does hell points at the man in the pulpit but heaven is not pointing at a man in a pulpit heaven is pointing to a man on a cross hallelujah glory to god amen not blaming it on this person that person are we giving all the glory to jesus hell wants to try to point out all the frogs hell wants to point out all the failures look i ain't perfect and you ain't either but we serve a god who is perfect and brought us a perfect sacrifice oh glory to god see there's two moves happening at the same time you must be spiritual at the junction to catch which one is of god and which one is of of satan all hell is turning loose but i ain't concentrating on all hell i'm here looking at what heaven is doing hallelujah look at this all hell turns loose too and it's prophesied that there be a janice and jamborees on the earth in the last days who would almost impersonate the real thing so close enough to see the very elective possible see so we're looking for all of that can we just you know make sure we got that got clarity on that when they say janice and james that's a spirit that came up in the days of moses at that you know and at the junction of the second junction and this junction you can take that down uh in this junction uh moses was supernaturally anointed by god take his stick throw it down and it become a snake and and when you read your bible you see moses is running from that moses was kind of like me i don't like snakes if god gave me that trial take this and throw it down and i see a snake i'm taking off running but god didn't want moses to have fear oh hallelujah so god did something to moses to try to take that fear from him it says moses pick it up now you can imagine what's going through moses mind and i can see that snake wouldn't move nowhere maybe they're sitting there hissing at moses can you imagine it but i wouldn't move and go nowhere moses couldn't go to sleep and anywhere maybe moses might have tried to leave the mountain and here come the snake just following him come on work with me here right everywhere moses smith that snake was there but god told moses pick it up and maybe moses get to a spot where the snake got him cornered in hallelujah and and now when he's cornering he got no no other option but to reach down and pick it up sometimes sometimes god allows your circumstances can i put it this way your unwanted circumstances to put you in position where the only thing you can do is depend on him moses pick it up and when moses picked it up and turned back to the staff again he saw the supernatural hand of god in his ministry stuck his hand inside of his in his bosom and pulled it out it was white like leprosy and i can imagine i was like oh lord i i don't know what's down inside of there but my hand didn't look like that this morning and say but put it back in there mo it took faith for moses to take his hand and put it back down there and then pull it out and saw that it was healed hallelujah great miracles but then moses goes to egypt when it gets down there pharaoh said what you want he said i'm coming to get the people out let them go almost come on now uh who is your god i don't know your god i don't know none about him he said my god say let my people go i don't who is the lord that's what pharaoh acts who is the lord i know not the lord so fair i mean moses thought he was something took his roster thus saith the lord let my people go throw that rod down and it turned to snake and oh my but pharaoh wasn't moved pharaoh pharaohs oh you just won you just one that can do that will you learn that at moses pharaoh himself didn't even move janice and jamers come hallelujah and he said now i already know these fellas they went to the school that you went to but they got the same anointing and i'm gonna prove to you that they got the same anointing i'm gonna tell you something let me tell you something here catch this catch this don't miss this the anointing is not the vindication the miraculous is not the vindication now miraculous will come but that's not the vindication what you're looking for is the word with the anointing if they can't walk in truth then you know something wrong with that anointing i don't care how many miracles they have they perform hallelujah somebody the prophet already taught us that power without character how you know they ain't got character they can't get along with nobody can't even get along with their self you got to get that spirit off of you it's the truth anyhow we're not looking for just supernatural you've got to have a life to go with the supernatural i'm telling you church that there's two spirits in operation the spirit of god in the spirit of devil they both show up at the junction they threw down their snakes and now moses was like oh i know god sent me here and moses didn't get frightened and and start running like oh lord they got two snakes god what am i supposed to do what the lord i'm gonna do with this he didn't do nothing moses actually didn't say nothing moses just sat there and watched what god did in some kind of way god i mean the snake that moses threw down just went over to one of the other snakes somehow opened his mouth a little wider and just swallowed him up i mean just a snake swallowing a snake that's supernatural right swallowing up swallow my and then the other snake i mean when those isn't even trying to do nothing with that got to the other stick open his mouth swallowed him up and moses reached down without any fear this time hallelujah picked up the snake it turned back to a stick and probably looked at pharaoh so you got any more but you see there there's these anointings that show up at the junction and you just can't be fooled by the anointing what you got to look at is the word how are they staying with the world all right all right all right all right all right um let me uh skip down here a little bit a man a man amen all right um here in this message junction of time this is uh um uh 5601 222. um it makes this comment here it says in the mark of the antichrist the mark of the antichrist is to reject the holy ghost and now i i want to make it clear now we're not talking about a goosebump we're not talking about a feeling on emotion we talk about rejecting the word and how the holy ghost is revealing the word for your day the mark of the antichrist is to reject the holy ghost right which you're sealed outside of the kingdom forever with no way they'll ever be forgiven he that speaks against the holy ghost will never be forgiven in this world of the world to come there's your mark of the beast and the seal of god and one little handful the seal of god is the baptism of the holy ghost and the mark of the antichrist is to deny it now you're marked one way or the other don't you want to have the holy ghost today it says if you people here would just only believe with oh a few moments of prayer signs and wonders would take place in the church this afternoon anything could happen i'ma say that again i'm not talking about an all-night prayer meeting i'm not talking about uh 40 days of fasting and prayer i i'm talking about if you people here will only believe with a few moments of prayer signs and wonders would take place in this church this afternoon at some point in time these have got to stop being quotes they have to become manifestation i'm standing in the gap for my daughter i'm standing in the gap with my mama i'm standing in the gap of my brother and i'm leaving with an expectation this afternoon that god can turn that thing around it happened for brother branham brother branham was there praying and he knew his his wife had a condition tumor he had just had this great tumor and and and and he knew the time that his wife was going to have surgery and uh and there he was his wife preparing for surgery and he preparing to preach at a meeting oh how many sisters would have been able to handle that one you call that the work of the lord you had a meeting preaching and i'm getting ready to go through surgery i thought you loved me what is this i can't believe this i mean this great healing ministry why don't you minister to me at the house y'all know how we how we think and talk but somehow sister branham didn't have that thought process sister brandon was just going to say i'm the daughter said it's going to be all right i'll call you and let you know how everything worked out bill don't worry about it but he couldn't get his wife off his mind and he just praying and the reason now she's in this condition the reason his wife has got the tumor y'all gonna let me preach just for a little bit the reason she got the tomb is because of how she handled her husband right hallelujah there was a little such situation come up in the house with the kids and uh and she wanted him to handle it a certain way but he refused to do it that way hallelujah and he didn't want to do it that way that's not the way the lord led him to do it and his wife said well you'll be here with the kids if if you want if you know so much pretty much you'll be here with the kids all the time you have to deal with this and deal with that if you i mean she just flew off the handle brother brandon understood this she's a woman she you know she's standing between him and the public and you know i understand she'll get frustrated i get that and he wasn't offended but god was and brother brandon went outside and was you know you know you know in a man when a woman's you know upset inside the house the man supposed to go up to the rooftop y'all ain't gonna preach to me when the woman get upset like that the man's supposed to get out the house brother don't stand there some pots and pans might start flying somebody gonna get hurt you better get outside somewhere let her calm down brother brandon brother branham went outside he's just in the content the holy spirit say now go tell her i didn't like that now lord you heard her you heard you heard lord you heard what the you heard what she said and you know not just what she said how she said it you want me to go tell her go tell her i was not happy with what just happened my sister's what you're going to do in the when the holy spirit tell your husband to come tell you that god wasn't happy with what just happened praise him anyhow but she said brother man i'm going to knock it on the door tiptoeing in there dear what uh i have a word from a word from the lord now i got a word from the lord from for you what is it bill lord want me to tell you to read this scripture right here put it back in the bible because uh you know praise the lord miriam did the same thing in moses day she didn't realize that was her brother she was picking she thought it was just her brother that she was picking at but it was god in her brother put it back in the scripture and say now you know miriam suffered for what she did now you know you're going to suffer what you just did and at that very moment a tumor was created some of our sicknesses are because of anger problems we need to be delivered from anger but somehow sicknesses are because of anger problems here she developed a tumor and as she got this tomb brother brandon prayed many times and just nothing could get nothing from god and while he was while he was uh away i think he was in louisiana and his wife is getting ready to go through surgery say i'll call you after the surgery is going to be all right he was away and just praying saying lord i just wish that my my my wife didn't have to go through this she stand between me and the public she'd do this she'd do that and god i know she did this and she made a mistake but god please forgive her he just he kept praying for and there in the hotel room the holy spirit said you can have what you asked for and he said before the doctor's hand touched my body the tumor would be disappeared he spoke it from louisiana while his wife was in kentucky or indiana somewhere and uh and he called and said he said yeah i'm getting ready to go in i'm getting ready to go in bill just pray for me and he's uh in some kind of way i think she actually said could you just do one more scan before you before you take me in could just do one more scan and they went back and they start scanning say oh my what is this tumor had disappeared before they could actually do the surgery that god still lives today and i'm not just saying that just to say it i'm saying it because it happened a miracle at the junction sister tanya had a tumor on her head went through a prayer line in indiana huh where was brother branham's wife there somewhere in indiana right but i mean living in indiana and she went to proline indian indiana came back to florida and somehow before the doctor's hand could touch her body the tumor was dissolved that's your before and after pictures and just with a moment of prayer i said just with a moment of prayer not an all-night prayer meeting but somebody get their faith raised to a level and say lord i believe you to be the same yesterday today forever hallelujah whatever you're facing god can turn that thing around in 24 hours it can be gone these are the miracles that are supposed to happen in the seventh junction glory to god thank you sis for being having that on cue i don't even ask for that but see that's when the holy spirit is moving like that you got to be in tune see that just drives the point home i don't even accept the holy ghost just go get the picture good she didn't even know i was going there but she was ready god bless you sister tina glory to come every job you got to be anointed even when you clean in the bathroom you need to be anointed when you vacuum in the church you need to be anointed everything you if you cooking meat be anointed every job got to be anointed glory to god all right all right amen so let me keep reading here uh i think i was reading out of the junction of time is that right where was that i don't know where i was in that quote i think um a syllable god is the baptism the holy ghost yeah the seal of god is the baptist holy ghost and the mark of antichrist is to deny it now you're marked one way or the other don't you want to have the holy ghost today if you people here would just only believe with oh a few moments of prayer signs and wonders would take place in the church this afternoon anything could happen but we're at the junction time this is the seventh junction what's the next brother branham we're going into the millennium that's right time will cease at this junction that's why it's the greatest junction of all junctions time will cease at this junction and eternity will begin for us and never no more let me keep going amen he says uh and if they have had if if they have been through all of these things when all the world history is climaxing in this great drama what's the matter what makes what makes people so nervous why is it even psychiatrists are coming to be prayed for maybe they've been studying to try to help people but when they hear the problems of people they need prayer and y'all know we're living in a very dangerous world i mean just this week we had a terrible incident i mean a lady just at the grocery store with her with a grand grandchild i believe and a man had a little disagreement with her pulled out a gun and shot and killed both of them right in the grocery store you better make sure you're covered [Music] and before you leave the home you better be praying you just pray over your family before y'all leave home you don't know what the devil got in store for you one of our young sisters worked at that store had just left the store right before this happened oh you think you just left no that's god that's god that's god you know that's god watching over you amen right but but but you know we we need we we're living in a dangerous age a dangerous time we need to make sure we got god hallelujah don't play games with this church amen it's a matter of life or death it says uh why is it even psychiatrists are coming to be prayed for why is it the world's in a nervous age a neurotic age when people can't wait hallelujah now let me just just inject just a little bit another thing saints i'm not going to tell you don't go to psychiatrists i ain't gonna tell you that if you wanna use one that's totally up to you that's totally up to you i i got no problem with that but i will tell you this your pastor should be involved somewhere in the process don't just depend on the psychic psychiatrist because they might not be able to deal with the sin see a a spirit can actually stay there i don't care how much you talk and you just let out all your feelings it ain't brought you no deliverance yet it's a spirit there and until we deal with that spirit that's when that's we settled a sin question then you can be get free from that what psychiatrist got that got that spirit off that lady that was so nervous in brother branham's day i i mean she just i don't know why i'm this way i don't and she just just just a nervous wreck brother ma'am said i don't know either just just wait let's just wait let's just wait let's just wait one day the holy spirit came into the room the lady wanted nowhere to be found but while the holy spirit did he say now that sister that be coming here trying to figure out this i'ma tell you what's her problem she had she committed adultery on her husband way back some years when he was going to the war and say now she need to get that right she need to confess that to her husband he said he said dear go get that lady tell her to come on down here sunday school teacher go get her tell her say the anointing is here telling me go go get her go get her she come on down brother brandon what is it just sit there sister sit right there sit down sit down sit down so now the holy spirit just showed me that you committed adultery on your husband yeah i don't know did nobody know that say that god knew it but i confess it to god so you need to confess it to your husband you gonna lead me say i don't know god doesn't already left you i'd rather rather have god with me than my husband with me that's what he said but you need to go make things right if you want that spirit to leave go make it right and she said i can't do it i said well all right you stay there and deal with the spirit then and i'm done with it no more prayer done okay i'll go make it right and now she got her spirit together getting ready to go out wait sister what your husband got the same thing to confess to you my husband he's a deacon in the church he got the same thing to confess to you sister went up there to a husband and say i need to talk to you and you know um you went off to the military i did this and i did that and i almost got killed by a car and accident and everything train almost hit us after i've sinned and i'm i'm sorry dear you did what whit who i can't believe it i can't believe it he's just going on and on and on and on when she let him get it all out they said now um you know the man that told me this he told me something else what he said you did it too what this lady had this color dress on y'all was riding in this car what what where he at i'm gonna go make things right went up to the prophet house to say brother branham my wife told me what happened we're coming to make things right would you please pray for us say i'm gonna sit down and resign from my post as a deacon and she's gonna sit down and resign from her post as a sunday school teacher now i'm gonna tell you the only place where you're gonna find this quote where it was said like this is when brother brandman spoke it in west palm beach this is the only place that he that he said in west palm beach now there must be something to that because when brother branham told a story here in west palm beach he added this part he said he said he said uh say they both was going to resign i say don't resign from your duty he says once you have confessed it right then the devil don't have no right to stay there but once it's confessed you can go on and keep on he said keep on being a deacon you keep on being a sunday school teacher once it's confess see you make it right with god 66 that ain't got nothing he can hold on you then once it's confessed you're going free hallelujah let me try to finish this lord have mercy all right it says um why is it the world's in a nervous age a neurotic age when people can't wait and i can't pronounce that something like that he says uh um down the street 90 miles an hour stop at the beer joint two hours before they go home run over people what's the matter what's everybody in such a hurry you can't you can't visit your neighbor you don't have no friends considering people on facebook ain't your friends i don't care how many folk following you hallelujah amen glory to god it says um um you don't have no friends you you don't know who lives next door to you you ain't got time to do this you're in a hurry what's the matter there's a great drama being set that's right and the lion hungered nation are ravishing in but just before he gets able to take it god will take his church the great drama being set for the second coming of the lord now let me just kind of inject a couple things here and i already know i won't finish my sermon today but i'ma just at least get started at the junction we're supposed to see the supernatural at the junction we're also supposed to have a man um prophets and angels they come at every junction and in this junction god did send the prophet for this seventh junction god sent a prophet and uh by the name of william aaron branham at the seventh junction now when i go if i take you back noah was a prophet in his day moses was the prophet in his day elijah was the prophet in his day abraham was the prophet in his day jesus and john the baptist prophets in their day and then he called uh luther and wesley prophets they were seers right so so so here in this day william aaron branham would be the prophet for this day before the second coming of the lord now i like a statement i was listening to brother jason watkins early this morning he made a statement he said this message is not brother branham reading his bible and coming up with something different than everybody else that's not what the message is he said but this message is like what we read in the book of acts chapter 2 when peter stood up on the day of pentecost after that great experience of the holy ghost pouring out peter stood up and said these men are not drunk ass ye suppose he said but this is that that was spoken by the prophet joel and what we're saying with the message this is that that was spoken by malachi this is that that was spoken by jesus christ himself this is that that was identified in revelation 3 and revelation 10. this is that which is found in the scripture glory to god oh my i feel like i just got to read it let's go to malachi 4. when we're talking about a message we're talking about something that came out of the scripture something that god ordained to be here peter could do this on the day of pentecost peter wasn't just some you know these what these people doing they drunk they crazy what is going on what are they talking about what is this speaking of tongues we never heard nothing like they say this is that that joel was talking about took him right back to the word yeah right and one and even when he took him back to the world you realize it was still some people that couldn't see what peter was seeing but the ones that was experiencing it was a joy to them that they could identify their experience in the words for me i want to be able to identify everything we do in the word of god let the word guide us let the word lead us hallelujah there's an anointing in the word glory glory look at this malachi chapter um four verse five and six let's just read let's read that my jesus behold i will send you elijah the prophet and and you know if if um if you're turning in your bibles you will notice that the book of malachi is the very last book of the old testament and these are the last two scriptures in the old testament last two verses that god god allows malachi a prophet to speak about it and remember i told you the spirit of elijah come five times hallelujah elijah elisha and in this verse alone there's a promise of of it coming two times oh hallelujah look at behold i will send you elijah the prophet can i just i'ma just inject just a little bit while i'm reading this i remember sister wisdom helped me see this amen some years ago and i made a statement said you know my name might not be in the bible i believe it anyway she said brother jack amen but your name is in the bible i say oh yeah where's my name as this she said every time you see god say you put your name there i say hallelujah says behold i send jack duff elijah the prophet and when is he going to come amen before the great and dreadful day of the lord now a lot of people say well this was john the baptist a portion of it was but not all of it was john the baptist right because john the baptist did not come amen at the great and dreadful day of the lord john the john the baptist came in today this was a this was a great day but not a dreadful day it was not dreadful for jesus to go to the cross that wasn't dreadful not not in the way that you're looking at it right amen the reason he went to the cross because he was bringing redemption to mankind it was the only way god would get man back in fellowship again that wasn't dreadful of course he didn't want to do it he he had to surrender to the will of god to do it we understand that but not in that way that you're looking at it the cross was everything we needed hallelujah hallelujah his act a man before the cross of praying through is is just a is an example for us as believers when we're going through something hard when we want the will of god to be no you understand what i'm saying when we want the will of god to be something different than actually what we're asking for that that's when that's when we're saying okay lord let this cup pass but then when you don't let the cup pass you have to accept his will nevertheless let thy will be done hallelujah hallelujah look at this now says behold i will send you elijah prophet for the coming of the great and threatened of the lord and look at this now the very next verse promised by god according to scripture and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children comma and now and is a conjunction which brings two thoughts together uh however this scripture in the first part is talking about john the baptist ministry which is clearly identified in luke chapter 1 i believe but the second part and the heart of the children to their father the spirit of elijah would come and turn the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse that part was fulfilled in the seventh angels ministry hallelujah which was the same angel spoken of in revelation 3 14 glory to god also spoken of in revelation 10 7. i can't read all of that but i'm just giving you where it is amen it's the same ministry all these ministries tied together by scripture so when we're talking about the message we're saying this is that which was spoken by the prophet malachi this is that that was spoken by john the revelator and can i also tell you this is that not an alternative to to denomination but a fulfillment of scripture amen matthew 17 matthew 17. this is after the great mount transformation experience disciples up there with jesus and and um they they saw moses and elijah come and and peter got so anointed he said let's build three tabernacles right here one for moses one for elijah one for you jesus then a voice from heaven had to calm peter down this is my son who i'm whom i'm well pleased don't worry about trying to build no tabernacles for these other people we're building it and if you're going to build anything build it for christ because this is my son in whom i'm well pleased and remember i told y'all last week we got to keep our head above the fanaticism there's a lot of folk out there building all kind of other tabernacles y'all be watching for that i say that you know why i got saints here that travel and go from place to place and and i think you should do that i think that's good to get out there sometimes sometimes you get out there and you visit somewhere else appreciation changes let's just put it that way your level of appreciation sometimes changes when you get out sometime and you see sometimes you just get used to this it's just a running a meal right but then when you get out and see you might oh wow wow wow wow and you might run into something i want to let you know you got to keep your head above fanaticism hallelujah i mean brother brother quaker is a brother that's been able to keep his head above some fanaticism brother kwaku was attending a church that he did not agree with what they were doing in there but it kept going it kept going even though he didn't agree now because most of us oh that's off the word i'm ah see you don't have the right spirit you might be able to win somebody if you can just bear with them a little bit right but but brother quaker just just kind of sat there sat there just waited just waited just waited and then the next thing you know um you know god opened up this opportunity for him to come here to to south florida he didn't even know a church was here hallelujah but when he saw sister amanda walking through the the the hallway there and he looked at it and said oh she looked like one of us she looked like one of us and and he's just start talking to her god bless your sister how you doing and you go to church yes i go to church what's the name of your church spirit and truth tabernacle where's your church over here is such such a place okay all right god bless you god bless you getting ready to walk away so before you go hold on one more question one more question one more one who was your prophet he knew that had to be the question all the other was the surface but this is the real question who's your prophet william marion branham i want to go to church with you and come to find out he lived right round the corner from the church didn't even know he lived that close to a message church god positionally placed him i was talking to him this week via uh he's in mexico and i think them preached six or seven times in mexico went got there to mexico and was um telling me to say he they was at fellowship in a house and about 10 30 at night pastors say you know let's go over to this brother house this brother's sick and in bed and just in pain let's go to this house and pray for him brother 10 30 at night right quick we'll say okay let's go and they went over there and started talking to the brother brother just just wincing in pain oh oh oh oh pain i'm just in pain so brother quaker said well let's pray brother got down on his knees and they prayed just whispered a word of prayer and as they prayed the brother uh uh reached and shook brother kwaku's hand and said brother god bless you the pain is starting to subside i'm feeling better brother thank you brother very next day they went back to the house to just check on them brother was sitting up in the chair reading his bible see in in the seventh junction miracles are supposed to happen 10 30 at night the brothers praying for somebody and they're healed self-same hour you telling me that the god tell me it's a different god in mexico than it is here no he's the same god matthew 17 lord jesus verse 10 says and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that elias must first come now they thought they had jesus with this question right i mean because jesus tell them you know different things that's getting ready to happen in his ministry and things that he gonna suffer and and the disciples thought they were holding on to something we're gonna get jesus we're gonna we're gonna use the word how are you gonna use the word on the word you can't do that but hear the disciples say and the disciples asked them saying why then say the scribes that elias must first come they knew they had been the bible uh to sunday school they knew that these things and jesus answered verse 11 and said to them elias truly shall first come and restore all things see i love this because jesus himself is prophesying of a ministry that is coming in this day and we talk about restore all things you cannot give that to john the baptist's ministry because john the baptist didn't restore nothing but when we talk about restore all things the teaching on baptism how we supposed to be baptized the church is still confused i went to church one day and the man uh so confused on how to baptize he said i baptize you in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost and in the name of the lord jesus what how did he get all that mixed up no you just need to understand what his name is see the the name of the father the name of the son the name of the holy ghost is jesus all those other things are just titles hallelujah i got the title of husband i got the title of son i got the title of brother i got the title of pastor i got all these titles but i got a name and my name is jack duff so you got to know the name of god his name is the lord jesus christ hallelujah see there i mean mysteries of what happened in the garden of eden mysteries uh you know what what's the seven thunders what's the seven seals what's these things these are all mysteries that was in the scripture all that had to be revealed by somebody and god used a man with a seventh grade education to bring these things to us at the seventh junction this is not an alternative to denomination this is that which was spoken in scripture i'm not following just to be following all the signs wonders and miracles and brother bannon's ministry just to get my attention but now i i understand god was calling me to a higher place hey man amen you know it's through this message that i can you know my my vision has come clear i can see more than i ever seen in scripture come on church we've been talking about that in ephesians and how you know he uh um uh he wants your length breath and depth your height he wants to take you higher than you ever ever thought you could go and you can go there in this word all right let's keep reading the rest of the scripture uh matthew 17. the very next verse uh oh my lord jesus uh it says but i say unto you that elijah has come already now first he said elijah truly shall first come and restore all things but now i say unto thee that elijah's come already and they um and they knew him not but they have done unto him whatsoever they list it likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them now he never told him who elijah was look at the next verse because you just say elijah is going to come and restore all things that's the truth that's been lost throughout the ages that truth had to come back amen but he'll say elijah's already come already sitting out now he didn't tell him who elijah was but look at what happened in verse 13 then the disciples understood when is it gonna come a time i can't wait for that season to change that present-day disciples come to a spot where they understand the eyes of your understanding will be open oh glory to god you know many many folk hallelujah many folk that walked away because they got blinded oh hallelujah i heard this earlier this week you know uh brother jason i think also brought this now you know in the days of sodom and gomorrah their eyes were actually blinded to be able to find the door to lock's house their eyes were blinded and it says today you know uh the preaching of the gospel has blinded the people's eyes it says now oftentimes in denominational churches because they experience the supernatural they actually get blinded by the supernatural oh i don't know if y'all caught that one yet they they can't see the truth because they blinded to that they can't find the door which the door in this day is christ they're blinded by the supernatural things that are happening they're telling you testimonials god did this god did that you blinded to truth see it's going to take more than just the anointing it's gonna take uh i i i need to make i try to make that as plain as i possibly can it's gonna take more than just an anointing for god to be satisfied with it god wants two things i'm just telling what the bible say to god god said god say but the hour cometh it's on the back wall and now now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and truth and notice just the father seeketh oh i feel like shouting in here if the father's seeking for that type of worship what you're going to give him i i back back to cain now i'm back to king cain brought an offering it was beautiful and it came with the with the the best spirit that he could possibly come in god please please i can't wait to bring this to church and see what you think of it lord and he get there and present it to god god said and i told you it was at the altar at the altar the man got rejected at the altar not when he turned and went back to the seat at the altar god told him that's not good enough and not only told him more and good enough told him what to bring all he had to do was go copycat give me a lamb son god said he wanted to give me one of your lambs he could have went out there slayed the lamb with a bad attitude and brought it to god and god would accept it you said this what you wanted this what you got he could have did that and god would accepted it but god knew that it was not inside of king to be able to even bring him that offering so kane came up with an idea i'm gonna get you to accept my offering because there ain't gonna be but one church left i'm gonna kill my brother and i'm gonna break i'm gonna bring i'm gonna bring i'm gonna bring me something i'm gonna bring me something god still didn't take it you got you got god seeking those that's going to worship him in spirit and truth and i want to tell you something that's not this church amen that's just the name of it it could have been called any other thing but you know i i like to say it like this when we used to roll out the okeechobee to bible truth tabernacle we were worshiping in spirit and truth when we go over the bride of christ having our con born we worshiping in spirit and the truth if i get down if i get up the uh uh uh uh uh saint augustine victory tabernacle i'm worshiping and spirit and truth if i get the rapture and faith tabernacle i am worshiping in spirit and in truth wherever people are gathered around this word i'm worshiping in spirit and truth all right let me uh try to finish at least this scripture but i'm saying to you that elias okay it's coming in uh and they knew him not but i have but have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the son of man suffer them then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of john the baptist it's finally it finally clicked and you know the sad part about it the sad part about it it didn't click until john was dead and for some of us it clicked after brother branham left the scene it clicked but i'ma tell you it's not gonna click for others until the bride leaves the scene by that time it's going to be too late let me uh let me just find a way to get out because i i i'm i'm stuck all right now lord jesus i i want to read this but i know i ain't gonna have enough time to get into it all but let me let me i'll just i this at least be a little entry point for for part two and y'all gonna have to just wait a little bit on part two next week i thought this week was father's day and i'm like i'm confused next week is father's day and i want to bring a sermon for the fathers amen uh let's read the token now in the fifth junction there were 39 miracles that jesus performed um 39 that the scripture x records and you know we just kind of focused on a number of the miracles that happened in the city of capernaum when we preached the message to fifth junction i preached it in three parts and and certainly enjoyed the journey but but i wanted to make a statement out of this message to tolkien here the prophet says now being in that we become part of the word and then take the token the spirit over the promise i am the lord that healeth thee we take the spirit over the promise i am the lord that healeth thee now get ready for the healing service tonight now i didn't i guess the lord know how he placing these things because i won't even pro i won't even think about stop this is the point that i need to stop not just get ready for the healing service at night but get ready for the healing service this morning see the see take the token hang it over the word what is the word you're the lord god that promised to heal all my diseases right hang it over the word on your unmovable faith in that word i don't know how he gonna do it i don't know when he gonna do it but he'll get out now that's the third thing that puts him out cause in him there is no such amen he says wish i could testify a little bit now to some things i've seen happen just in the last few weeks see oh what i could testify of you know the luke if all jesus done would be put in books there wasn't enough books in the world to write them right it says just what i've seen in my own ministry seen them do you compile the volumes on this platform here if i wrote it in details what i've seen him do just in my own ministry seen him do it see he had more success in my ministry what a statement he had more success in my ministry than he did in his own now remember he had more success now not me he had oh glory hallelujah it's who he decided to use right he who decided to veil himself in and i'm letting you know this morning he is still veiled in human skin i think brother brothers brother brother smiley preached on that one too in terms of being able to recognize if we could just recognize right we can just recognize who is in our midst if we just if we just get a glimpse of it that these not just quotes just to be read but somebody trying to anoint your faith it's christ trying to anoint your faith to believe for the impossible he had more success in jeffersonville than he did in nazareth he did it in that wicked city and this wicked city amen glory because uh uh he could perform no miracles there but he did hear he finally broke through here lord let that be our testimony he finally broke through here he got it done here he might have had to get people somewhere else but he got it done anyhow so uh and what he's saying people was driving from all over just to come into jeffersonville god was getting his work done don't let somebody come in here um maybe vision for the first time at the anointing uh hits them they're like you know i believe that i heard nobody preaching like that i believe that i believe i'm gonna receive my healing today don't let somebody walk in here and get theirs and you you leave with nothing hallelujah i mean that tape we just listened to and them them folk went to church everybody in there was you they weren't leaving without nothing even if i ain't got a prayer card i'm still gonna get something amen come with an expectation look he says uh he got it done here uh he he might have to have get people somewhere else but he got it done anyhow so he had more success right here than he did in capernaum or nazareth and he'd done more miracles right here in this tabernacle than he did in the entire ministry on earth that's right he did it now what about the rest of the world oh my now it says now uh that's what he done now remember he done now it never said i done it see no because i didn't do it i just didn't i just loved him and just submitted myself to him and said what he said and the holy spirit went to the other people and they believed what he said and then he done the work that i saw says if he can get all of us believing it what would he do right now if he can get all of us believing it right now there wouldn't be a feeble person around the town that's right if he could get everybody to believe it it'll be all over see hold your token over your unmovable faith and his promised word and satan will go and he says now i'm going to close now and i feel like that's just a perfect place to close this morning i will pick this up because i got to talk to you about the miracles that was done at this junction some of those miracles that happened at this junction will occur today let's bow our heads and i want to have a word of prayer but also want to as i mentioned before we have two sisters that are coming and they want to stand in the gap for some family members we are going to naught with oil this is what the scripture tells us to do the bible says that the prayer of faith will save the sick and the lord will raise him up it doesn't say when it just says that that's what he's going to do and we're going to come and do things according to scripture this morning there's anybody here that said brother jack i want to i want to stand in the gap for somebody or i have a need myself and i want prayer we want to invite you to come join the line and let's just believe god we watched him do this just a couple weeks ago and there were so many testimonies that came forth from that service and that's because the miraculous always happens at the junction thank you jesus father in the name of jesus we're coming god today believing you to do something mighty you've got to do something that only you can do the prophet was just saying that you did more in his ministry than you did in your own he said what about the rest of the world and here we are god your hands your feet yielding ourselves to follow the word of god lord our faith has been anointed just to believe we're not looking at situational circumstance and reports from a doctor but lord we're believing the word of the lord you told us oh god in your word to lay hands on the sick he said that the prayer of faith would save the sick the lord will raise them up they committed any sins that they would be forgiven because this is what you said in your word so father we're coming according to the word of god and satan we take our authority as sons and daughters of god and we are join you in the name of jesus the prophet said he'll go that devil that's binding the people that devil will go it's not us making it up it's not us manufacturing it it's us following the word of god come lord speak manifest yourself at this junction it's in jesus name we pray if you're not a christian this morning your heads are still bowed so brother jack i'm not a christian i'm not saved i don't know the lord the way that you're talking about him
