Saints y'all bear with me just for a little bit I was just talking to the lawyer yesterday trying to figure out the mind of God for the song that I was singing today and look like I just couldn't come up with nothing at all so I decided to put it all put on I wanted to taste brother branham's messages and just immediately hearing that voice inspiration start coming and the Lord just kind of took me back doing a review of the different songs that he's given me under this inspiration and I you know like I just had to meet him didn't know what to do then so I just want to say that there's a real real real bad attack on this message the real today is in case some of you don't know there is a strong strong attack and as I just begin to listen to that prophet one of the songs that came to my mind was I'll never walk away save me from my aaron ways then i got to wanted a song and uh i knew this was it when i came in contact with this message i knew that this was it and just going through so many um what have you then I found myself singing this when the roadmap and I just want to thank the Lord for that because this message pulled out a gift in me that I really didn't know that I had yeah I wrote some little Dingles I would call him before I came into this message but the depths of the teaching brought out the depths in the songs and I could never turn my back on those things because as your inspiration was coming when they the songs came I feel the same way now I feel the same way and I just I just want to thank the Lord for just using me as a vessel my family is using us as bestest around this message to bless the people and you know just just continues in parabola cos this rebellion against the message is hidden in places that I never imagined but it's real nobody led me into this message the Holy Spirit let me and no man could leave me out of it only God is that brother Westco say if this thing and I'm gonna hold on to this to it come amen amen so those who know this song the roadmap I entreat you to help me out if you feel the same way if you feel you've got the same assurance that this is a roadmap then I want you to sing it with me this morning praise

just sharing a man I look back in man 2017 was my first year of full-time ministry a man for a full year and and it seemed like everybody kind of picked up on something on on Wednesday night I think three or four people that same day I heard was talking about how when we go back and we look at the story the children of Israel coming through Exodus and numbers and Sooners God delivered them brought them out of one thing the Bible say they begin the murmur right and and and and we found just Wednesday night there were five times that they murmur within a one month span of being delivered from each of them and and when we when we think about that we have to put ourselves in their position because how many times has God made a way and then we turn right back around and start murmuring talk about how he's gonna do it you know I have to repent you know and you know you know sometime you know I'm gonna be honest people might say I've talked to myself and and and I am I am I'm talking to encourage myself David did that encourages up Lord but all the time when I'm talking I'm also talking to the devil and I'm just let him know yeah God did it this time and God did it that time and if God did it this time at that time then he gonna do it also again right and you know sometimes you just have to just stop and just say Lord you did this and ain't no way I'm going down to forgive me for even having just to paint out because you don't prove yourself too many times to me already gone a Manny man you know that that uh you know lord have mercy lord have mercy amen I like that but

time I had an opportunity to go to Israel and and just you know if just God just did some things that just blew my mind and I'm like my wife was saying it was the first year we were there was one day we were sitting over in Temple right before Thanksgiving we were just there for a couple days and spinning you know just just some time as husband and wife together and and we're sitting there eating in downtown Tampa and I just kind of stopped there look I see if taught me to believe that I'm sitting here as usually I'm at work and worried about this project in that project in my life but it is happy to see in the middle of the day I'm sitting downtown sampler eating you know and I say what God has been good God has been good and let me tell y'all something when you go on through trials you going through tests and you know some of y'all talk about some of the things you going your job I would think my sister Theresa so you know such a mistake they moved you to another area not realizing that just a setting you up for a blessing they didn't realize it see you're gonna be done learn how every department work and in learning that you might own your own chick-fil-a one day now ain't say you had to work there you own it and other people can work there is that alright then alright somebody need a job you create jobs for people but you got to know the departments before you can do that Oh glory to God somebody so you gotta turn the turn turn turn turn turn what look like a man a mess into a blessing you got if you got to turn that tank amen god is good god is so you know a lot of times you're always going through situations where you're feeling pressure you're feeling try you're feeling trouble but God is actually pushing you into something a magnitude of never going into had he not pressured you remember pressure produces [Music] pressure produces power so we are we think uh for the for the pressure hey man it pulls out the best and all of us so and thank God is good god

real real blessing a man we appreciate him brother in front of wisdom as well just appreciate appreciate all of you we really do appreciate I can only echo what was said on Friday night is it's the Saints that makes spirit truth what it really is and and and it seemed like every time something happened spirit and through showed up all right brother brother brother Steven released and the thing that you tie around you when the aprons and that apron had a spirit on it brother Steven I'm just telling you one of the sisters got a whole day apron and some things check don't be handing that apron where it is what is but man we appreciate that God is good I don't know if it's just me but I'm burning up I know I know it's winter but for Florida floating like that I mean you get you get your 50s in the morning but by the time the Sun Rise you back up in eighty you know but but praise the Lord here in second Samuel Chapter seven we will read a man from here starting at verse one says it came to pass when the King said in his house and the Lord had given him rest roundabout from all his enemies all right so he's coming to a place he's been battling been fighting but now he's come to spot where he has he has rest and I think there's there's times in our lives where we also get a little rest you know from the battle verse two says that the King said unto Nathan the prophet see now I dwell in a house of cedar but the Ark of God dwelleth with within curtains a man he was very concerned about Oh God's house right thanking God for his house but now he has more concerned about God's house so he says but the Ark of God dwelleth within curtains and Nathan said to the king gold do all that is in thine heart for the Lord is with thee those are some powerful words to all that is in thine heart for the Lord is with thee and it came to pass that night that the word Lord came in to Nathan saying go and tell my servant David thus saith the Lord shalt thou build me a house for me to dwell in whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt even to this day but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle and all the places where and I have walked with all the children of Israel speak our word with any of the tribes of Israel who might command it to feed my people Israel saying why Billy not me why Billy not me a house of cedar so God never even put this on upon anybody says now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David thus saith the Lord of Hope Lord of hosts I took thee from the sheep coat from following the Sheep to be ruler over my people for Israel and oftentimes we all need to reflect on where God brought us from a man I took thee from the sheep coat right from following the Sheep to be rule over my people of Israel and I was with thee whithersoever thou witness and have cut off all that meaning yes I like that right I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight lord have mercy I'm not going to see you no more a man if their true enemy got to do that remember but sometimes people they're just to test your character as you might have thought you were a Christian until some folk come into your life you go they'll prove your Christianity right since I was with you with the stroke without witness and I've cut off all thine enemies out of our sight and have made thee a great name like into the name of the great men that are in the earth moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel and we plant them that they may dwell in a place of their own and move no more neither shall the children wickedness afflict them anymore as before time and I've since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel and have caused it to rest from all that enemies also the Lord telling that he will make thee a house and when thy days be fulfilled and thou shalt sleep with thy father's I was set up that seed after thee which shall proceed out of that bowels and I will establish his kingdom now we realized that Scripture has dual meanings amen and we'll try to talk about that today he shall build a house for my name and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever I will be his father and he shall be my son if he committed iniquity I will chasten him with the rod of men and with the stripes of the children men but my mercy shall not depart away from him as I took it from Saul whom I put away before thee and thine house and my kingdom shall be established for ever before they that throne shall be established forever the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word let us bow in a word of Prayer father we are grateful for the privilege to be able to reach Scripture but we realize the Holy Spirit is the one that helps us to understand what it is that we're reading bring revelation to our hearts the Prophet said Ezra if revelation is beyond us then we should look up and ask God for it so we asked that you would bring revelation from heaven we realized that if we're standing on the rock of Revelation and the gates of Hell will not be able to prevail against you against us thank you for the anointing a man that is in this place thank you for the spirit of worship a man that is amongst the the Saints and God we all have so much to be grateful for for what you have done and what you're getting ready to do well we praise you so bless us now as we enter into the word we take every spirit that's a gift your spirit underneath the control of the Holy Spirit in Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you can be seated so as we just begin our journey here through this fourth part it happened at Calvary just kind of go and recap a little bit a man remember we brought out in our first sermon there how Abraham was asked to go to Mount Moriah and to offer Isaac had a very specific mountain that he wanted Abraham to go to and we look at that way back in Genesis at the beginning because Genesis means beginning but here here Abraham is going to Moriah the name Moriah bitterness of the Lord also meant doctrine of the Lord and Abraham has asked to go there when it gets there to that mountain Isaac is asking that his daddy daddy I see the wood and Isaac packing the wood on his back and and all these things and he's like that I see the wood because I'm carrying it now you know it's a and I've seen a knife I see this he said but where is that lamb and you know and Isaac got a look just to look concern and and Abraham being the father of faith you got to know what to stay at what times right because his response is God will provide himself a ram for sacrifice or lamb for the sacrifice and and and then he still turns around the ax Isaac to lay down and and here here this very promise that God had given Abraham through Isaac Abraham is about to slay his own promise right but but here you know in faith Abraham does this and Isaac it meant humbles himself the same way Jesus humble himself to the cross and Isaac lays himself down and and while Abraham was in the midst of about to slay his son he hears from heaven Abraham Abraham stay your hand he and God actually provided himself a sacrifice he put a ram in the bush a man but that Ram was representing the Lord Jesus Christ and and not just you know we use that as a type we say those words just so so so plainly they don't it was a type it was just representation but it was more than that the very same spot that God called Abraham the go-to was the same spot that Jesus Christ would be dying on the cross right so so it was it was more than the type it was it was reality you know and so when we look at that that's something that happened at Calvary Oh glory to God and as we turn it on through a man through this we also found that when you know you went went went the reason that it wasn't the a man that the it was about I would let me put it this way Mariah was about a four man walked from Calvary hey man so that's why we say it was the same vicinity the same area that Isaac was off was the same area that Jesus Christ a mare was been off a blatte but but because a man that that when Abraham was was taking Isaac God told him I offer a whole burnt offering and anytime you offered a hope or Alfred that has to be offered outside of the city gates hallelujah so when Jesus comes along as the whole burnt offering for mankind he is offered right outside the city gates at Calvary that has a purpose for him going to Calvary amen because Calvary meant what place of skull hallelujah dog golf the mint heap of skulls and here you know Jesus died at Calvary because you know when he gone there he's he's actually done that the answer amen to to the question of redemption who could I mean who could actually uh satisfy gospel to Jesus Christ became the answer and then the satisfied gospel T of death and we thank God for that but when he went there to that place of school they don't know what they were doing they they had no idea when they took Jesus and put him there they had no idea that the blood that was that was that was running from Jesus with drop down seeped through the crack and hit a skull that was down there that was at the place of scope and that's God happened to be the school of Adam hallelujah the first Adam sold us into sin but the secondary redeemed us from the curse of sin and all of that happened at Calvary the other thing we found that happened at Calvary was a man David David you know got herself in a little trouble little trouble the you gotta he got a spirit on him where he wanted to see exactly how many men he had in the kingdom that could fight and and when we read the scripture you know you read you know one and the book of saying another other story in the Book of Chronicles you know you can see some differences in the story praise the Lord but just because I see differences don't make me put my Bible down hallelujah now I said that intentionally right because there's people that see differences in the message but I'm not gonna stop believing the message look you don't realize I saw differences in Pentecost I saw differences in Baptist but they don't have nothing there to keep me right and guess anything that man is involved with there's gonna be some differences hallelujah but God is still God in the midst of it all amen I found me a roadmap to get to heaven glory to God this message is my road map hey man I know people don't like us standing those things but you know that remember the seed the seed of the bondwoman is not here with the seed of the freewoman so you cannot take the bottom woman and force her into a rapture but with feelings and emotions that's not going you ain't gonna get into the rapture with your feelings and emotions did not get into the rapture because you will be in the word so you got to have something inside you it's gonna be magnetized to this headstone and in the headstone is Christ he is the word so the word has to connect with the word in you and if it's not going to connect it won't be low magnet it will magnetize right so if you got people rejecting the word and still saying I'm going to rap so I don't see how that's going to happen Amen it won't happen Church so you know I'm sorry to have to be the one to share the bad news but but you know it's not I'm not the first one to share that news you tell me how many people made it in those day how many that was a tight you know of a not not necessarily the rapture but you know people being spared from something it was attack only eight people now what happened in north uncle what about North's mother-in-law I mean you tell me I it's in your Bible right we're going back to the Bible you tell me what happened to the people they was good people church-going people but they didn't make it right so look that's what I'm what I'm here to tell you I'm not the one that's going to put people in I put people out but I will tell you this you gonna have to follow that word if you're gonna make it praise along a man it was good people in the days of our you know just I mean Abraham with others a few good ones damaged like what if it's 50 in Sodom okay what a what a 45 what about 40 okay don't get mad 30 20 and he said not now okay I can't ain't gonna say nothing else I promise exit can we destroy if I find 10 righteous I wonder straight can you imagine that God couldn't even find 10 people 10 and in a city that big he couldn't find 10 Oh God have mercy you know see you know I got a quote here and I didn't know how I was gonna fit but God just showed me how it's gonna fit and this quote saying don't don't smutty up this message with your life don't you bring any smut on this message your decisions that you make don't bring smut on the message don't cause people to speak evil of this message because of your decisions can God find 10 righteous 10 you know you go down to your look and he couldn't find him and even in life even in lost own house full of them came out but only three made it out it showed what was in his wife's heart you know all alone and and this is what we want to make sure our hearts are real pure and clean before God because you know just like people didn't make it in that day people and make it a North day it's going to be folk that hang I'll make it today but and David stay just getting back to this point David David got as his heart swole up and they begin the number the people and when we look in the scripture one script to say that God pretty much anointed him to do that another script to say the devil anointing to do that well why does the scripture say that it's not it's not a to me it's not a discrepancy there's a reason because in every decision that you make guess what God is there in that decision and Satan is also there in that decision hallelujah so you got to watch the decisions that you're making you don't you want to make sure that what have you doing you bring an honor and glory to God hallelujah as we go on God got punished David for that decision and there were people that died there was a plague that struck and there were people that died but God had a very specific place that he wanted David to go to in order to stay the hand of the Death Angel and when they told him to go to a ruinous threshing floor and one in one scriptures call it it calls a morula another scripture calls him Oren and it's the same man prays a little bit he said go to that threshing floor because that threshing floor where a man where where the plague of death was staying was the exact same place Calvary would be it was the same place Abraham would offer Isaac all of this was the same place and we know when Jesus Christ was offered the plague of death a man was stayed from mankind the last enemy that was conquered was death Jesus did that for us so you know after you know after we go through all that you know the last thing a man now that would come because a I mean David was not able to build a temple for God but David deal built didn't build an altar for God and but Solomon is the one that comes along now and he builds the temple for God in a rulest threshing floor all right now let's go on a little further here that's where we are okay so I want to read here from this message dedication dedication paragraph 29 it says we're very very familiar with the reading of these set scriptures that we want to speak on for a few moments now David under desire I want you to catch this under desire and revelation thought in his heart a very gallant thing when they that being a man and well-loved with the people and God had blessed him in so many ways and it said now is it right that I sit here in a nice home that the Lord has given me in the Ark of the Covenant of my god out there under curtains that was a very gallant thing it was a revelation for David to know this because it wasn't just right for him to have such a lovely place under the Hat under the house made of cedar which was a very expensive place and said then the Ark of the Covenant my God who gave me all these things is still out there under the tent and Nathan the prophet knowing that God was with David he said David do all that sin of your heart but God is with you otherwise when God gives you a revelation I like that carry it out when God gives you a revelation carry it out don't let nothing stop you from doing what God told you to do when God gives you a revelation carry it out listen he said he says but that but that was all working in that night the Lord came to the seer and the prophet Nathan and said go tell my servant David see I like that Oh in other words I admire his courage and his thoughts of me to build me a place but he said I haven't dwelt in the house I haven't had a place to stay when I come down the earth can you imagine that I haven't had a place to stay when I come down to earth to look my people over I haven't had a place to stay ever since I brought up Israel since I haven't commanded any of the judges to build me a house of cedar but I have went from tent to tent that isn't that isn't just about the form of it today I went from tent to tent and from place to place to meet with my people he said go tell David as the scripture further reads I took you from the sheet coat out there following them few sheep of sheep of your father's and I made you a name like a great man that's in the earth I cut off your enemies from from the right side to the left side I love you David and I know that your desires is right I know that your ambitions is loyal and I know that you love me and I want to go on a little further so as you can see the storms how David is constant thinking of God to many of us today think of our own achievements something that we could do to better ourself but David was constantly thinking of what he could do for God oh I want to hang out there for a little bit now I'm gonna hang out there for a little bit let's let's let's just think about this now he says you can see the songs right how David is constant thinking of God to many of us today think of our own achievements something that we could do to better ourselves but David was constantly thinking of what God what he could do for God now on your list of goals for next year I'd like to ask you do you got anything on there that talked about how you can do more for God is there anything on the list are that all about you and what you try and achieve and what you're trying to accomplish is is that all your girls got is just you you you get that very selfish a man sometime you need to look up and see I mean like brother Adam talked about the the peach sitting underneath the trip the apple tree he always got his hair down looking at the apples a many a cousin there's another athlete gap that when they eat old man another win a fifth but the problem with the peak he never looked up to see where the apples are coming from and it's time for us to stop and look up to see where our blessings we're coming from I want you to look at look at David I want you after I mean here you know I want I want to just I want to make a couple comments here you know there's nothing wrong cuz some some of us got some you know some really really big goals that you know something gonna graduate collagen in the next year some gonna graduate high school sometimes you know start some other businesses don't god I mean it's gonna be a lot that happened in the next year I know God get ready to do that sake but in the midst of whatever God's doing amen I want to make sure that he is still in first place amen he has to be in first place and whatever it whatever happens what if whatever your career decision is God got to remain in first place listen I wrote this say it's okay to desire career nothing wrong with that nothing wrong that it's okay to desire success but the Prophet said the beats expect to be successful is to stay in line with God's promises it's okay to desire success but to be successful is to stay in line with God's promises I want to say this whatever career you choose and and let me tell you I know that you know sometimes you can go to some places and then they just discourage you from you know from from some of the gifts that you have in you you know God has anointed people to be doctors and there's nothing wrong with being a doctor God has anointed people to be engineers there's nothing wrong with being an engineer hallelujah that's not wrong with owning the Walmart it's nothing wrong with that I mean you know I think anybody striving for success I think that's great but you got to keep God in first place listen since I whatever career you choose do it for the glory of God even and all that you achieve never lose sight of your pursuit of God right we know and I'm not just this just something the Lord put on my heart so we know what you're doing in school and what you're doing in business but what are you doing for Christ right the talents that you have the talents that you've been given for success in business should also be equally you ditch to God's divine purpose the talents that God has given you to be able to be a blessing and in the baby to get get income it should be equally then I'm going further equally yielded to God's divine purpose God don't bless you to pull you away from him that ain't that ain't a blessing hallelujah glory to God that day I mean I always tell you that you know if you don't give you you have to watch how you share your testimony and everything in a testimony you gotta watch that if I come up here and tell y'all that God just blessed me with my my name's an opportunity and I never thought I'd be able to have but you know where church with this opportunity I'm not gonna be a big Church Wednesday night I'm not gonna be able to make Church on Friday night I'll be here Sunday though how many I'll say amen to that testimony for me y'all leave it with my battles oh is that I've no brother Jack but God don't do things you see you you have the time but you know what you can't have those type of expectations for me and not for yourself okay if we gotta it's got to be your traffic got to go both ways right a man Church right so I mean you know that there's so much more to do for the kingdom of God and we got we got to make sure that we are applying ourselves to God's divine purpose for life amen right the careers not to God God just blessed you with talents to be able to enter to that field but don't let that become your gods hallelujah all right listen I want to go a little further Lytton I'm talking to my David remember where David came from and see sometimes are you go back and look at your life and you see certain things that you achieved you have to remember where you came from he was a nobody that God made us somebody hallelujah right say don't forget we're let's not forget where David come from he was taken from sheep coat and in Oh God when we talked about him being taken from Chicco this is him out there watching the Sheep and when God say he took him notice when God said the prophet Samuel Davis house now say I got my next king ejected saw Samuel go down to Jesse's house I got my next king down there and he went down there and he say he took his oil Oh glory to God trick is all and he says saying I know the next king is in this house and he say say uh they say Oh Jackson where your boys God said the next king is here in your house and I come to play annoyed that boy asked King here I'll just to say uh okay look at the Sun right here this boy he looked like a king look at his stature he come before the Prophet the Prophet took that or nothing came out and even Samuel thought himself that that man would have been a good king the next man comes up nothing the next one comes up nothing it got so discouraging in that house so discouraging that that was you know when they finally got to the point where like man none of the oil poured out so salmon stopping as you say is this all your sons is this all your boys and I want you to I want you to get it because not even Davis daddy not even Davis brothers none of them invited him to the ceremony of anointing I hope we get that he was completely forgotten about and I mean from his family members none of them had any confidence in David being a king nobody had confidence but God God when God said I took you from a sheep goat at me when nobody thought nothing about you but nobody even consider - I still had my eye on you well yeah what man you just wasting your time you know there is another Jesse in town you know this might be the wrong house so no God sent me here so go get your boy prophet if he said no to all these already know I already I'm just telling you wasting your time this boy ain't good for nothing don't say so and I just for this daddy thought that's what his daddy his brother stuff and I can just you know I just didn't brother just I can see him go up that to the field come on boy come on what just leave this she why but just just come on come on in the house you know just what what is it you say well the prophet it's here to anoint one of one of Jesse's boys to be king and and everybody done went through the line and and it was noted everybody so daddy said he had one more boy you were the last one come on you can see him just dragon and Here Come David just walk it in the house look like nothing he was not the he was not the the a person that you would call successful he didn't have that look about him but here here come here come here come David walking in the house and as he walks in the house the anointing struck the proposition rise up this is he and before he could even get the oil just trying to get just trying to lift the oil up oil seeping all he trying to control the oil nah you know or just before you can even put it all David see we see when we look at that and say I took you from the sheet when nobody thought nothing about you we didn't even think anything about yourself I took you from the coke and I made you King don't forget where you came from don't you ever forget where you came from you didn't have that confidence before I gave you that confidence and the reason you got the confidence because of trials that you went through gave you that type of confidence look at this david was free anointed king and it took him a few years now before he became king number of years but i want out but when david became king this is something Lord gave me David had reached the pinnacle of success I want you to get that when David became King if I could put this way when David became president when David became CEO when David became all this he had reached the pinnacle of success there was no high authority in the land than the king cuz imma get y'all got goals y'all want to be yeah you know yeah you know you don't want to just you want to own the business not just work at the business thing then roll it that right that gonna make you the CEO the head person in charge right you go you gonna do God you gonna be alright Act but when David reached this pinnacle I want you to think about something he was a shepherd a musician a songwriter a warrior but now a king and even though he achieve being king he still had desires to do more for God I want that to sink in even though he reached his high level of success David still had desires to do more for God that's why I save God is first place that's gonna be the first thing you think about not the last thing you're gonna put God in this proper place JCPenney made a statement and I don't have the direct words but he say anytime this business got ahead of him making the church he knew something's wrong with the business I'm not talking about Sunday morning church JC Penney went to church during the week so if it was called to him to miss service during the week he do something that went wrong JC Penney now you know I used to wonder why JC Penney was still hanging in there at the palm be smile before they did what they did that was a the last anchor store there man was honoring God while chick-fil-a so blessed today they honoring God there used to be a time Publix weren't even open on Sundays right but you know we got to get we got to put God back in his proper place now I'm when I'm when I'm when I'm showing here is that David even though he reached this pinnacle of success yes he used to be a shepherd he used to be a musician used to be a song right it was a warrior now King but you know when he became a king he was still going out to battle his men had to stop him from battling that mean he still had the warrior nature inside of them you know David was still writing songs after he became King do you know after he reached that success he was still playing music I'm asking what have you put God in his proper place those are the things that we used to do I'm talking about the phone we got bless his things we used to do that God try my call that guy cuz when God gives a give he don't take it away even though achieved this he still had desire to do more for God and see what I said what the Lord gave me say the see you see the more God blesses you the more you should want to bless him I'm not just making this stuff let's let's read a few scriptures because that quote said you can see in the Psalms how David is constant thank God let's just read just a few of now you know it's 150 Psalms we can't read them all but you can read just a couple of treatments let's go let's go to Psalm 27 verse 4 and verse 5 see we're talking about desires and and things of that nature right I mean God said he knew what Davis desires was but look at this look at look at look at look at look at Davis desire Psalm 27 verse 4 through 5 says one thing one one thing not two not three not not four not five not six not said one thing one thing one thing have others like what is your greatest desire your great what's at the top of your list listen one thing our desired of the Lord that see when they say that will ic-cap they say that's what I'm gonna pursue right that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life and behold the beauty of the Lord and to enquire in his temple he goes on say from the time of trouble he should hide me in this pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle Shelly hide me he shall set me up upon the rock that come through worshiping and praising God your success your blessings come from your faithfulness psalm 42 psalm 42 psalm 42 verse 1 Psalms 42 I want you to see what Davis hearts with I'm talking of the king this way the king tall sometimes 42 verse 1 and 2 look at what they say as the heart panteth after the water Brooks right he's sitting there just looking at nature as the heart pastors after water Brooks so panteth my soul man I can't I came I can't live without him I can't do without him right so pant is my soul after the old gods o mind set my soul thirsteth for God not not not for anything else my soul thirst for God for the Living God when shall I come and appear before God I didn't write this one down but it's in Psalm 122 oh my god see if this thing if it's saying it get real to you that's the way you're gonna feel you ain't gonna be approaching God you'll have heartedness can I just talk the oldest one you know you know I've some of y'all bestow on time to the meetings but when it come to the house of God just kind of casually walk in that's just it don't get me I just be wondering what do you be thanking what what actually do you be thanking I mean you can be on time for work and you keep going to your job that lien you won't have a job anymore so y'all get there early but when it comes to God I'll just you know kind of just kind of casual just you know I get there when I get there somehow forget y'all breakfast on Monday through Friday but on Sunday you've got to have breakfast the other days you fast but suddenly I got to eat Psalm 122 witnessed in verse 1 huh cuz because something come up so much don't come glad you know I mean some this morning I was I was also so happy to hear manifold up before the storm a the guy that people is already worshipping people are already in that channel right I mean that that's the way we suppose approach the house of God you said yeah 30 ahead of time my 30 minutes after time 30 minutes ahead of time I'm talking to King this hour he approached to say I was glad when they said unto me let us go to the house well that means David got something that started bubbling up and they said Church time it weren't like oh I got to do that again you know church again no no no no I can't wait to get to the service and I'm gonna tell you if you got that type of attitude that church again you're not doing nothing to create no atmosphere can I go in a little further this one this I won't read all this but I'll just give you a synopsis son and Psalm 73 David was looking at how to whisper procced the wicked prosper he was pretty you know he's looking at that and sometime you get the looking at how wicked people that don't serve God prosper and you and it kind of gives you they give you their you read eBooks a how they succeeded and God ain't nowhere in they plans but we don't try to follow everything that they do in order to be successful you can't do it that way you can only take bits and pieces from them not all of you can't you cannot take all of it right so so here David looking at how to wicked a prospering how much Monday making and you know and and and then the Bible said and and seventy in the some semi through verse 2 it said that his foot almost slipped in 2017 your foot almost slipped but see if you keep going on in that chapter in chapter 7 3 he said now the reason that have put in slip is because he went to church and in verse 17 said then I understood there in now he didn't understand the wicked sin until he got to church that's why he was happy to go to church if that's where God go speak to you at church this is the way David as a king approach God now let's just read psalm 118 let's start at verse 14 I told you I couldn't read a mo but David is always constantly reflecting and thinking of God this is a man that has achieved success and you know and he is the king now that the hair guy of the nation actually the top King that ever reigned in Israel's history is David and let's look at this in Psalms 118 as we just move over to verse 14 look at what he says he says the Lord is my strength and song and is become my salvation alone baloney you know as you know you just look at you look at these words if they're very powerful says the voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the Tabernacles or the righteous the right hand of the Lord do with valiantly the right hand of the Lord is exalted the right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly it says I shall not die but live and declare the works of the Lord glory says the lord hath chasing me store but he have not given me over unto death and I like this look at what the after his trials after his tribulations look at what he says he's not talking about giving up and quitting he says open to me the gates of righteousness I will go into them and I will when I get there now that's what I'm doing I get through them gates the righteous I will praise the Lord and I'm not coming to sit on the servers I come to add something to the service I will praise the Lord says this gave an order to which the righteous shall enter I will praise thee for thou hast hurt me and art to come last salvation and he goes on say the stone which the builders refused is become the headstone of the corner this everything that happened to me this year all my success all my achievements all my overcoming every time I I mean when I looked and saw this devil drown that that teller drowning in my red seas this this is the Lord's doing it ain't got nothing to do with me this is the Lord's doing for him to bring me through in my first year of ministry full-time this is the Lord's doing hallelujah somebody till y'all go on Friday night house sister Rachel just wrote a book that's the Lord's doing everything that you accomplish it's the large doing the job you got it's the Lord's doing it ain't you're doing it ain't you ain't got nothing to do with you that your business just still blossoming and bloom and it's the Lord's doing got an open up so many doors for the Johnson family it's the law it's doing oh oh my god when these days brother Josue gonna share his testimony what God did for him y'all just don't know you just don't know but if some things it's the law it's doing and you know what I you know when I when I heard of what the Lord was doing like Davis say is marvelous it's the Lord's doing in this marvelous in my eyes I'm so happy to see what God doing I'm happy about what God doing in the midst of his people but I want to make sure we keep God us first place because you can have all that plus God you can have all that plus got you you ain't got a subtract guard to get all that no plus guards you need to plus guards I'm gonna give you more because you bless me imma bless you plus God don't subtract god bless god that's the way God our God is not a God that subtraction too much but our God will add and he will multiply so and your next year and that that's why I'm not even using the the the the the actual year because this is gonna go for every year that we here in your next year plus God on your list what do you have the Plus God and is that at the top of your list where do you see yourself achieving this at what point do you want to achieve this come on define it and don't do it this is the laws doing it as mothers in eyes this is the day which the LORD hath me we will rejoice and be glad in it you know there there's a number of scriptures that we could go back to and look at but when I when I stopped there at verse 22 where it said the stone which the builders refuses become the headstone the corner that took me because you know that let me just also just mention this we we we gotta turn a corner now in the sermon and see brother Branham said that any brick mason can just lay bricks anybody can do that just for brick I mean it actually don't even take a brick mason he said that don't take any man could just lay brick top the brick on top of brick top of brick but when we turn the corner he say you need a real brick mason that know what they doin to be able to turn a corner well we get rid of turn a corner we going into another year now you know we raise some octaves but was more than just one octave it's more as more than one octave you can so we don't keep raising in the next year all right look at this look at this David had it in his heart to build God a temple but God told him said no David you can't build a temple you shed too much blood and and and he said but I'm gonna I'm gonna raise up your seed and that seed will actually be the one that will build the temple and we all know that Solomon was the one that was raised up a man to build the temple now even though David was told that he couldn't build a temple the the Prophet already told him said David go and do what is in your heart because God is with you now even though he was told he couldn't build a temple yes he built an altar but he couldn't build the exact temple that did not stop David from making preparation for building the temple and if you go back to first Quranic who's 22 we don't have time to read all this but David gathered workers and they were workers for actually but even though he wasn't building he still had the workers lined up to build a temple right David are charged his son Solomon with the responsibility of building the temple and all that David of his own substance David gave 100,000 gallons of gold towards the building of the temple and he also gave 1 million talents of silver towards the building of the temple so even though he did not himself build the temple he made preparation for the temple to be built there's some things you might not you know necessarily be called to do but you can make preparation for somebody else to do it Oh hallelujah glory to God you can make preparation to see you know i'ma just borrow this and the sister she didn't I won't call a name but what her heart was is that she wanted to be a blessing to missions that's what God put on her I want to missions so when she would make a certain amount she say Lord I'm gonna if I could put that much and tithe I'm also gonna put that much in missions if I can put that much in time I can put it in mission and you know what God did blessed so she could do it all over flow because she had the right desire you know that might oh I'm gonna just leave that alone I'm not gonna go there y'all know when the preacher start talk about tired everybody start you know choking up but when I say that I'm trying to show you how to get blessed you know you don't realize I mean some last week we cut back on God as God give us more we cut back Oh how you gonna get a million dollars you can't even handle you know you know how there's we get if I got $100 that's easy to me to give God ten I get a thousand you know it's your tie this on a thousand it's not ten it's not ten you know how do you know God gave a couple thousand you got my ten dollars oh that's well yeah announcer so far right that's so you don't do it that way ten percent of what you make what God gave you that's what you give back to God you keep 90 percent give God 10% so God give you a thousand give him 100 if he give you ten thousand you give him one thousand and he gives you a hundred thousand I know that's gone right now you know how people get come on right in a check for $10,000 you behalf okay that's a church then go get my money it ain't your money in the first place [Applause] it's each of you to receive a hundred thousand but it's hard for you to give God ten thousand see your heart is not in the right place that's why you can't get less I know some people that done Oh Lord together people aren't wrote eyes on what they expecting God to give them all right I'm moving forward David made preparation he knew he wouldn't be the one building but he still made preparation for the building of this temple and and when they begin to build this temple you know the Bible says a couple of things here let me I'm gonna just read something real quick I won't read this Oh Cora Graham said Solomon was a man of peace of wisdom he didn't go to war like David and had a lot of bloodshed he was he was just a man of peace and God gave him wisdom when he was actual what he made of the for God he only asked for wisdom to know how to lead his people and he never taken the great gifts that could have been done but he just asked for wisdom to know how to lead God's people to the best and and and and you know there's a statement for the Graham Sonesta where passage it want to be always lead God's people to the best amen I want you to be blessed I want you to be blessed I like seeing y'all in new cars I like seeing that any man ain't saying go get in-depth but but I like seeing you bless prays alone glory to God yeah just something I can't even get to where people actually like to see the past in a jalopy they feel like he's humble in a jalopy got the chick one don't open it if that don't slide and people let the window down and climb a window I can't believe but rather see the pastor like that but they riding fine you're hurting right you're hurting rain amen amen now not all people like that there's some people that want to bless the pastor they said Lord at the pastor been faithful and I want to be a blessing to the pastor hey man that's some folk like that and the ones that's like that God gonna bless them so they can be a blessing and when they bless y'all don't get jealous I'm yes I'm gonna enjoy what yes I am yes I'm just letting you know right now yes yes I am yes I am your CEO enjoy it and you don't talk about him so stop talking about me praise the Lord all right Sodom was a man of peace of wisdom he didn't go to war that's why he was able to build this house God established him to the house but the work the name Solomon actually meant peace peaceable perfect or that recompense is he rewards or repays right peaceable perfect that's what his name meant and when David had given him the the charge to go build a temple there were some things that happen when he built the temple a man first thing and I'm reading I'm just kind of quoting a number of things from the message dedication but these are some things that the prophecy says the material that he was building when it wasn't found only in Palestine right this material was coming from all over and the good thing about the when the material was coming from all over a man when it got to where it where was supposed to be in Jerusalem somehow the material without a hammer without without a without a nail a man if a stone came from this country and a stone came from that country when they start put them together the stones just fit there was no chiseling there were there was nothing that they had to do just just put the stones on top of each other and they just fit but you know but before they start putting the stones on top again they saw one little stone that they thought that they did need so they took this stone and they kick / Louie stay with me here they kept the stolen in the we pile but but as the other stalls are just kind of coming from here coming it they just putting everything together now the proper census the materials not found only a Palestine he says it's like today there's one place that redwood has found say that's in California it says and there's one place they call in Africa on a muscle being there's a famous work there that's called stink wallet it says has never found nowhere else but there so so what will that's telling me that there are same things grow in certain places and God were allowed to grow in that environment for a season and then at the right time he'll pull it from there and pull it from here and bring it together and they begin to grow hallelujah you had to go through certain trials in certain churches you had to go through certain trials by you in the world but there was coming a time that God will begin to unite and put some things together Oh once things are together that's when you begin to see your norton flow come on somebody hallelujah that's what we've been seeing a man in this / here there's no to flow because God has brought these things together and the gifts just that nobody trying to make themselves something they give just fish look at this you said Solomon while he was building the temple he never very one bit from the pattern that Moses saw at Mount Sinai he stayed with the pattern and brother Adam say that's that's that's for us today cuz we should never leave scripture just stay with him he says Moses he said he says I said whatever God gave Moses psalmist David say and whatever God gave the first church the church at Pentecost we should pattern ourselves in the same manner I like that right because see if if they had gifts of prophecy and gifts of tongues and gifts of interpretations in the first church then this search is pattern to have the exact same thing if they had casting out Devils then this church's pattern to be able to do the exact same thing if they had signs wonders and miracles then this church's pattern to do the very same thing without stay with the original blueprints he says every little stone fit its place no matter where it was cut from where when it came together it fit his place it says oh what a tight there we find of the spiritual how they that every gift of God every odd act of born-again Christian because some of you like why they do that why they act like that Oh God gave him that nature for a reason see there's there's at certain times where that nature gonna come up and you'll see why you needed it oh all right let me break that down put it on y'all on y'all on the level that everybody can get somebody I told my wife one time so you've missed your calling yeah why so you should have been a lawyer that's where they told you you should have employed because she can take a point and she can make her points off that point so you know there's been times where I had different people calling me bout some bills now we've given my answer she told y'all hi I am right I'm free to meet God just you know I'm just trying to work with you sometimes a devil you know disturb me sometime as telling the brothers we were out to eat the other night and we just walked him alone and I'm halfway up the steps and and I hear my wife down there talking to somebody and well who's she talking to you know it's just saying saying something to God well let me I can't see what this was photo and I see he just busted in cussing and you talking to now you know and he going on and on and and and said look man my momma almost failed my wife almost failed cuz you got your kids just running around here you ain't got them under control just get your kids under control that's all we said hey kids hey kids just about custody I said get your kids under control that's all we tried the same and next thing you know that fella done bowed up and then step I'm a Christian come on let's go I can just see it right now on the news sometimes you have to just faint just just you know because if you don't think the devil I have you into something and you gotta remember you a Christian above all things hello sir you can't post everything when you a Christian you can't see everything when you a Christian you can't do everything when you a Christian I don't have the Stars II never got that close you bowing up and I'm thinking man got curly hair on the tape there's one pool on your head you done 50 old pastor in city plays throwing hands you know I can just see it all over the news we just got you got to be careful watch the devil and everything he always trying to lure you into something always trying to lure you into something like lord have mercy glory to God see every every little stone fit in this place no matter where it was cut from when it came together at Fitness place so that was that was a type of where we found the spiritual how that every gift of God every odd act of born-again Christians and their peculiarities yet is God is God his place it fits in the body and what I was saying about my wife you know said that you know sometime I had different people calling me man we were going through financially and you know and so they didn't take my soft words my wife knew how to talk to and still in a Christian manner she's not gonna curse she's not gonna do none of that she's just gonna make it very firm and so so when she I said did we talk you just just talk to her funny next thing you know by the time she finished talking explaining and she doesn't but she don't worked every argument now you know this y'all did this job did that you know did it I can't remember none of that but she she done worked that whole thing in before you know what they stopped calling that's a gift and there's times where that gift gonna be used see sometimes you got some odd strange things about you too you know let me just let me just say this let me just see this because we spent so much time working trying to work on other people you shouldn't do this you forgot you've got this thing out of splinter and they I you got a 2x4 in your eye you worked on your two by phone and they'll work on this Flynn er but we spent so much time you know they shouldn't do this they shouldn't but Ruby I mean but look at you I have a brother come to my office you know earlier this year telling me what a certain sister shouldn't do she shouldn't do this she shouldn't do that she should do because she did she say I'm thinking with this old arrogant spirit that you got I mean when you're gonna start praying and stop talking because all you do is you stir up trouble I can see that right now you just a troublemaker and God don't like that spirit either he hate the spirit of this court you want to stop spending so much time amen on social media trying to find everybody false worried about y'all all right I'm going on let's see listen don't those when those stones came they they was fitting in the place and and and and as they but you know they got to a certain spot and this is what the prophets saying that all of us have come from different places different backgrounds different countries but we've come to this spot and we make this church what it is and each one with our unique gifts we all add something to the body we need your stone the building won't be complete without your stone we need your stone praise the Lord just surrender your throne the gods right but we need what you got in order to complete the building it goes on steady state and in this building there was one stone that was actually too odd to fool with so the builders rejected to see the hit then kicked us and over into the weave pile when they got the building almost complete them just this is what happened at Calvary when they got the building almost complete they looked around said man how come we missing one stone what's what's the one that you know what there's something missing in the building said we're missing one little piece here and in the scripture you know said that the stone which the builders refused had become the headstone another corner right it was the one that they refused that's the one that became their headstone of the corner and here here when they finally got a convinced like man where's this where's the stone that what does this say they went looking amongst all the other you know major stones instant man we can't find it and then somebody just happened to just go to the we bow to the junk pile and when they got over to the junk pile they looked and then they saw there's one odd-looking stone they pulled it out and they went and stuck that into the building and that that was the missing he's the one that they reject it was the missing piece can I we know Christ is to reject a stone we know that the brother Adam said when our builders today accept the rejected instead of pushing them off and called them a bunch of holy rollers the art ones that's making confession that much sooner the building will be completed so when they can accept the rejected I thought about that a little bit more because we have people rejecting the Prophet now you don't understand when you rejecting the Prophet you actually are rejecting Christ I know that one went down B I'm explaining it to you the children of Israel rejected the leadership of Samuel they wanted a king like the other nations and today people want titles like denominations they want to be called a pasta they want to be called prophet oh my even brother Branham didn't go around tall that called me prophet Branham he that he just called me brother hallelujah hey man so you know listen we can we can identify him just because the scriptures say he was a prophet but he didn't want no title oh my god amen anybody searchable titles that I mean it's the same thing and what would happen in sandals day when they reject the Samuel standard got he was so discouraged at the people doing this but God had a tongue say salmon they're not rejecting you the Prophet they not rejecting you they reject on me so you reject the naproxen you actually rejected Christ there's a statement that brother Branham makes when God sends a gift to the people who's talked about Solomon he said when God sends a gift to the people and they'll recognize it it's always a golden age but when they refuse it there's nothing left but chaos for that generation and then I ain't seeing a bunch of chaos I don't know what I'm seeing see so when you accept the rejected then the building to be completed they reject the Prophet they reject the prophets message they were they reject the people that believed the message and don't tell me they don't I know I know and I'm talking about Allen call people up hey let's go out and do this I'm busy okay no problem you busy this first time all right I'll try it again let's go out and do this oh I got this going on okay all right that's the second time okay let's let's try this every time I call it's an excuse now you can't say it's on me because that's right I haven't heard from you you've heard from me though and every time I call you you rejected me it's okay when you accept the rejected they're building to be completed after the building was completed the propagator was still an empty building and there was nothing in the building but furniture so Solomon had done all he could do now the great day of dedication come and when they were going to dedicate this building for worshippers to worship see this has all happened at Calvary when they were going to dedicate the building for worship this solomon's temple built there at Calvary when they went to dedicate that building for worship he says he says that the building for worship worshipers to worship something now without something there and worship the building would have been vain but when they dedicated the building for worship the Bible says that the minister stood up the fire of God fell and the minister could not stand to Minister that's what happened when they dedicated the building that Solomon built at Calvary for worship oh my well as we turn our corner we keep turning to remember there's a scripture here and in Acts chapter 7 because all this was a type of what happened with Solomon amen in building that temple in Acts chapter 7 verse 27 says but Solomon built him a house howbeit the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as that the Prophet heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool what house will ye bill me saith the Lord or what is the place of my wrists see Solomon's Temple was not the place of his rest and even though you know things was all in place and once they once they locked everything again man the power God fell down on the net but I'm telling some of the place of God's rest is your heart and once everything is in place once you once your your your your objectives are in place and your your your you know your heart is in the right place then guess what the same weight of pilla fire or the power God failed there for Solomon that staying power God wants to fall for us it did it on the day of Pentecost and whatever happened on the day of Pentecost it should still be happening in the church today look at this the Prophet says this there's a couple things as when we talked about in 2nd Samuel 7 I'm going back to that really quick but when we talk about when when I days be fulfilled verse 12 when I days been filmed I shall sleep with our fathers I was set up thy seed after the which shall proceed out of that bowels and I will establish his kingdom he should build an house for a name and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for every time Solomon's kingdom actually fail I mean his Solomon himself backs near so God was not building it on Solomon right Solomon's Temple was was knocked down it was rebuilt but even when after his rebuilt you know Jesus prophesied that there one day would be no stone upon another it was still that temple was gonna fall so that was not the temple God was talking about when he made David this promise let's go on a little further now we can see some things because this temple that God was talking about if I could just pull up 1st Corinthians 6 and 19 part of this temple that God is talking about says what know you not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which ye have of God and ye are not your own so this this this this is this final resting place of God it's inside of you can we go on a little further second Corinthians chapter 6 verse 16 and 17 look at this oh my god says what and what agreement hath the temple of God with idols for ye are ye are the Temple of the Living God as God hath said I will dwell in them and walk in them and I will be their God and they shall be my people wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate saith the Lord and touch not the unclean unclean thing and I will receive you I'm trying to establish that you are that temple there's a couple things here that I want to read out of the message dedication I'm at paragraph 85 and that brother Branham made a statement a statue of her commanding said Christ sent me to bill individuals to the statue of Jesus Christ that they might be the powerhouse and the dwelling place of the spirit by his word see by his words he build up the individual to that place and that's exactly what we're trying to do you are Amen that final resting place let me read this and I got one more scripture and we'll close it off today out of dedication paragraph 85 it says and there had been 120 temples that God had created was ready for dedication they had got all their unbelief beat out of them and they gathered in the upper room and waited for 10 days for a dedication of service then went completely surrendered God came down again in the Shekinah glory and fill all the house where they were sitting what did God do like to art dropping into his proper sockets for the message of that day a man God dropped back into his proper channel not into a denomination or into a building mate with hands but into the heart of man he dropped in this place for the last day which said the Prophet Joelle it shall come to pass in the last days I'll pour out my Shekinah upon all flesh your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your young men shall dream dreams the old man shall see visions God came to his resting place where he finds rest not in our building but in the heart of his people he finds rest says what a shame what a disgrace what a what a disposed that Nimrod Nimrod man made achievement was brought to them when Nimrod tried to build a building or an organization that would reach up to heavens God upset it it become it became a shame instead of helping them he come he confused the language of men the one couldn't speak to another it broke up Brotherhood but when God came to his own temple the church the people when he came to them he filled it the temples that were dedicated just like he did at Solomon's Temple he filled it not with Creed's not with denominations but with himself he filled the temple with his Shekinah glory so did he do on the day of Pentecost he filled them 120 temples that was up there with his self with the Holy Ghost itself the Shekinah glory broke through a bump there and I'm looking for that same thing to happen again here those are says and then what never I fail to do build a temple where every man spoken traitor what what he could understand God came down and with one Galilean language made every man understand what he was saying and they know it and they know it was brought there is God to his temple God to his dedicated temple not to a man-made achievement not to what man done but what God did himself he goes on to say this oh it's silly to the people they don't get it they were born not to get it that is some folk born not to get it some born now for those and this is my prayer for those that had it and lost it my prayer that they're gonna pick up Jesus where they lost them because I don't believe they were born that beginning especially if you saw I think you just need your sight recovery that's all they were born not to get it so they won't get it the Bible said so right God always feels his temple at the day of dedication he feels his temple he feels it with itself the same thing that they God will feel every temple that will thoroughly dedicate itself to him and any persons that will the temple is not this little building here the temple is not the one in Salt Lake City the temple is not the one in Rome the temple is you you are the temple that God wants to dwell in and express his stuff through it that all nations might know him you are the living images of God that God wants to work through and anytime that any man or woman will forget all the falsehood that they've heard in the world and come back to the line of the scripture and we'll keep in line just like Solomon did to what Moses did Moses did to what God did God always respected it see when we when we accept the rejected and then the building will be complete let's go on it says and if we'll come back to the original dedication and we'll open our hearts and empty ourselves God and dedication as we give it to him we'll fill our temple with the Shekinah glory then the Living God will be moving in a living church among the living people and will spread forth its glory than together someday one being this way and one this way and one one part of the country she'll come together to make the pride will be caught up in the air to meet him now this lovely church this building that the people with their tokens of their livelihood with their love for Christ the worshippers that's dedicating today this place of worship that people could come and worship now my sincere prayer is that every every worshiper will dedicate his own temple to worship in the temple that's been dedicated to worship that's the real dedication church this this this whole thing God wanted to establish relationship with man and the only way you can get that relationship established with man was at Calvary see what we had was that we needed God Himself to come and die for our sins but after he died and after he rose again he said to copper to what come glory to God and it's no longer God above us or God with us when he came to Calgary but now because of the Holy Ghost it is God and us we are the temple of the Holy Ghost and the Spirit of God dwelleth in us hallelujah it oughta make you want to do more for God it oughta make you approach this this upcoming year with with it with the determination Lord I'm not gonna put you in second place a third place on my list I'm gonna put you in first place what things can you go back and do for God we ought to be impact in our community we ought to be looking for opportunity you know brother for mention that the other night about setting up a tent I just come through Indian town last week I saw the last couple for the last couple of months in town hat tips you can't really put tents up around here it's hard to do that in West Palm but there are places like Fort Pierce there's people in places like Indian town we can go and put up a tent but you know what if God put down the brothers heart he got it got to be some other people that want to go and do that let me let me just share this with you when we if we going with your tent we need singers good singers you got a gift that God gave me this thing we need need musicians we need singers we need all that because you got a gift that God gave you a menacing you know sometimes you can just get going with a nice little song and you need a congregation that can pull on that gift right because you get going a nice little song and people start hearing that from around next day no just coming we just had that happen the lady was down here at the store shopping she heard the music going on this place she came out the storms to start coming right on it had to go home drop off the groceries came back to the church see when you create an atmosphere I can do this and I hear you got you got you got the singers you got the musicians and do you need somebody to preach the gospel brother Jack came to it all so God raised enough gifts and every gift got to be used for something see it's fitting in places everybody get in where they fit in and watch God bless what happens come on it don't stop with just you sitting in that chair on Sunday morning gah got so much more for us to do but we gotta get in action Holly saaam I'm sorry revelation 21 this is it I was looking for listening to the Prophet on yesterday he was preaching the sermon God hiding himself and revealing and simplicity in the same hiding himself as the police didn't reveal himself in the same and they made that the comment about David was permitted to build the temple David David was not permitted to build a temple he could not do it but he said I'll raise up your seed and he'll build the temple that temple would be an everlasting temple and upon your son the son of David would be an everlasting Kingdom he will control Solomon David's son and the natural from his natural strength built a house unto the Lord a temple but when the real Cedar day become the son of David he told them there would come a time that there wouldn't be one stone left upon the other of that temple but he tried to point them to another temple and it goes on to say and this let me just see if I could yeah says it says so is it today where he says David could not build a true tabernacle of God because he wasn't prepared to do it there wasn't nothing he could do he was a mortal man shed blood so is it today to us we're not prepared to build the true tabernacle of God there's only one can do that and it's being in its construction now but this little Tabernacle along with the temple that Solomon built him and along with others are only temporary places of worship until the time comes when the real Tabernacle be set up upon the earth and righteousness shall reign from Sky to sky and there will be no more sorrow there will be no more funerals preached in that Tabernacle there'll be there be no more weddings for the wedding will be one great wedding for eternity what a time that would be he says but let us purpose in our hearts today that in commemoration and waiting for that Tabernacle to come we will characterize ourselves by his Spirit that we worship Him in this place and if we are and if we were in that other place waiting for that place to come and he invites the congregation to stand to their feet and I want to do the same thing for you he invites the congregation to stand to their feet and he reads the scripture over the congregation revelation 21 first one it says I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea it's as I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God I love this and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away let's pray father God we realize that we are the final resting place it's in our hearts God that you want it to have fellowship and on this day as we come father to this last not only last day of this year but the last Sunday of the year God we want to take a little time as as a group of believers to rededicate ourselves to your purpose into your plan for our lives oftentimes we have to admit that we allow so many things to get in the way of what you have called us to be not that you don't want us to achieve success and by the world standards but God you want us to always remember that you must be in first place in our hearts and in our lives that no matter what we've done that the song says only what we do for Christ will last so that we ourselves to you as we law prepare to approach this own coming year God let the let the past stay in the past the mistakes of yesterday let them remain in that place in yesterday but help us floor to set our eyes amen on the goals that you have
