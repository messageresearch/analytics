oh [Music] oh [Music] somebody give them glory somebody give them praise in this place thank you jesus my god i'mma let you be seated in jesus name if i could just get a little bit more volume in my monitor i'd appreciate it amen and just turn with me quickly to psalms 100 very very familiar scripture and i want to thank the lord for giving me a chance just to dance this morning [Music] i was this week i don't know what i'm just thinking to myself i just need myself a good dance i don't go to dances but when i come to church sometimes i just need the spirit just to move a little bit so i can just give the lord a good dance dancing is a sign of victory praise the lord somebody man hey man i was in my office dancing and david got to singing some songs i got that i got them moving in there [Music] let's be dancing [Music] i just i don't mind praising the lord amen i'm a fool for christ who's fooling you but i want you to read this with me amen and just something the lord brought to my spirit this morning while we were hearing prayer the bible says make a joyful noise until the lord all ye lands and when you're making a joyful noise there's gonna be some dancing involved in that right says serve the lord with [Music] hallelujah somebody you can't come before the lord with a sad face but serve the lord with gladness come before his presence with you can't come with just the silent voice god wants you to get involved in the worship right and it says know ye that the lord he is god it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves we are his people and the sheep of his pasture and it says this i love this this is what the lord gave me says enter to his gates with thanksgiving hallelujah and then says also and into his course with praise now i just want to pause there just for a moment because it says entertain his gates with thanksgiving that's just a thankful heart you ought to just be thankful that he woke you up this morning you ought to be thankful that he provided for you last week you ought to be thankful that your bills have been paid you got to be thankful that he watched over your family you ought to be thankful that he keeps making a way you ought to be thankful you ought to think about what god has already done and when you when you're thinking like that that's how you enter [Applause] that's how you enter the gates [Music] i love it when i hear the saints say man hallelujah praise god they're entering the gates with thanksgiving but i want you to notice what david says next he says because you know when you're into it thanksgiving it changes your mood [Music] it changes your attitude it changes your outlook and thanksgiving can then release praise so what happens is that you elevate you go from thanksgiving to praise come on somebody as we go deep up into the presence of god you elevate do not just come through the gates with thanksgiving but you get into the course with some praise [Music] brother i'm coming to church the right way i came with thanksgiving and i have entered into praise to god be thankful unto him and pray and bless his name and the reason we do this is because the lord is good his mercy is everlasting and his truth [Music] [Music] endureth when the bible say his truth and do it to all generations that mean the young people should praise god that means the middle-aged people should praise god that means the older people should praise god even if you high risk you want to give god pray [Music] [Applause] glory to god somebody [Music] hallelujah lord i thank you thank you jesus amen you can be seated in his presence i just want to let the devil know why i was praising the way i was praising him he's a good god he's a good god he's an awesome god almighty god my jesus my jesus how i love him how i love him how i love him hey man and when i when i was reading that i mean just praying over that this morning when you when you approach it the way david say approach it you don't really need anybody to actually pump you up [Music] because see the people next to you ain't going through what you've been through [Music] so when you begin to just thank god for what he's done for you you're coming into his gates with thanksgiving oh my god my god my the time you start thinking i might guarantee you your feet to get light start feeling some quickening power you know back back in the day people used to get quicker in it y'all ain't felt some of that a long time have [Music] he said give god give god some pride yes brothers i was ready to praise god some of y'all ain't felt some of that in a long time you you need some quick and power lord jesus glory glory glory amen amen we got so much to give god praise for so much so much so much so much so much i was sitting back there i said lord i got all this i got to do but it's hard to do it with an anointing like this amen this is what we pray for we uh we believe god [Music] [Applause] we've been asking god for the dynamics to come and strike the mechanics and we want to put emphasis this and i want to encourage everybody in the house of the lord don't don't uh when god's moving just just enter in just just release and just you know just worshiping a little bit i can't imagine you going to heaven i'm talking about heaven heaven going to heaven getting in the presence of the lord jesus and just heaven and that's all you got when you got the heavenism [Music] come on church right i mean and and we're in heavenly places so when you're in heavenly places you shouldn't be like that either you got two feet you standing on that's enough to give god praise hallelujah somebody you got two hands that you can clap that's enough to give god plays you got a mouth that still operates and works that's enough to give god praise [Music] glory to god church i'll tell you hey man but i want to encourage everybody to come in here like you like you like you know what you're doing come in here like you know what you're doing amen i mean in sports we get excited we get excited somebody hit a home run somebody's still a base somebody scored touchdown somebody shoot a basket we get excited some of your sisters say i don't i don't watch sports that's fine you get excited when you go shopping you get yourself a good deal you don't keep it to yourself you pick up the phone you begin to call people because you excited telling everybody about everything you're experiencing you got to get here you got to get here i'm telling when the angel lord is moving in the place like this you got to get here you got to get here you got to enter in you got to get what god got planned [Music] lord jesus all glory talking about an anointing that can change lives god that's the anointing that we want an anointing that changes lives so i come with an expectation and amen and i'm just i'm just happy amen with what what i see the lord doing and and uh and i don't want to i'm not bringing when i come to

get an anointing like this so we uh we live in florida in florida we have surfers those surfers realize that when a good wave comes you got to get on it and ride we got to ride it and that's what we're doing just riding this anointing praise god [Music] i have a couple things that i just need to mention here man um it's first of the month and i always do this for you and i want to make sure i give you all your your update and um these are even things that we thank god for it's a prayer that i want us to pray we had sister hollande amen this week precious daughter of the house her father went home to be with the lord and uh we want to pray for sister milan also sister carol amen has been coming to visit us uh her mother went home amen this week we want to pray for uh her mother amen and just remember some things there amen and um remember these families um that god would just give him strength during this this great time lost uh we also want to celebrate with brother jerry amen and his precious wife sister melissa the lord has blessed him with a baby girl amen and we we certainly celebrate with our precious brother amen and his wife zoe praise the lord amen i believe seven pounds seven ounces amen perfect numbers so uh we thank god for her being brought here amen to the earth and just keep them in prayer they are desiring for both mama and daughter to be here amen so just keep them pray that god would just give them favor uh and that but quickly let me give you just an update on our uh uh building fund uh lord has placed it upon our heart to uh seek our own place of worship not just pay rent but we want to own our own place and we have been saving towards that and we're coming to the end of some of our savings every year we've been just putting something together this year we had a goal of 105 dollars and then we had pledged uh 54 000 dollars and fifty four thousand nine dollars was placed to that hundred and five thousand dollar goal uh as of today we have received 32 hundred twenty nine dollars and forty six cents towards our goal i wanna give god praise for that just last month alone the lord blessed us with another one hundred ninety dollars towards the goal so we thank god for that we haven't had to use the money for any other purposes than just saving it for our building and i'm grateful and you know i was thinking to myself as you know at a time like this we got this pandemic going who want to buy a building now brother branham said if he knew jesus was coming back tomorrow you know he'd be doing the day before jesus came in the field planting potatoes so that's what we're going to do we're going to keep working till jesus comes right and we got interest on on the money that we have placed in the bank 281.31 that gives us a total this year 33 110.77 that has been saved towards our goal praise the lord and that i mean when i think about just the the i say this little as much when god is in it right so amen we don't look at our size we look at the big god that's in the midst of us amen and we we're thanking him for what he's doing so we have one more well two more months that i'll be reporting to you amen because we'll come to a close of our time of what we've done what we promised to do for the last three years and then at our business meeting at the beginning of the year we'll share some more information but but god is good he's been better than good to me better than good to me so i'm very grateful amen for that so i also wanted to just say a word of prayer for um this precious two sisters that have lost uh loved ones this past week like god would just give them strength uh throughout this time and amen so let's just let's bound the word of prayer god we come before your presence on behalf of sister elon and sister carol uh both have lost loved ones sister elaine her father and sister carol her mother we asked that you would undergird these families that you would carry them through these most pressing times not easy when we lose loved ones but god i pray that you'd be a strength and a comfort and a help to them that you would turn their mourning into dancing and lord everything that they need that you would supply that you would just be able to be their father and like it is uh in the poem footprints on the sands of time there's times we look down and we see one set of footprints other times we see two sets but lord the time that we only see one said those are times that you're carrying us so lord may they see and made it feel that you're carrying them through this great moment father we just uh just appreciate that we can lean on you god any time we're going through we can lean on you god and father as we just turn our attention towards the word we pray that the spirit of god will just take control over a little thought that we want to try to share today god that you would just get the glory and honor the praise from it it's in jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you thank you musicians and man appreciate you all i appreciate the specials amen from sister rebecca and brother david brother david and saint so good to have you all and fellowship on today amen uh sister uh janice right god bless good to see you sis amen and we just we just thank god um hadn't been hearing that for a few weeks and i guess some things have changed uh but god is still good god is still good i am i wanted to uh read a scripture here and um i i i will just kind of start this thought i don't think i will complete it today but nonetheless we'll get started in this i wanted to speak on the subject vindicated truths vindicated truths and um we want to just take our reading from the book of john uh chapter one and if you would just uh stand with me we'll we'll read from there and uh what i what i may do is just for the sake of time just maybe read one verse here or something and then let you be seated and then i'll i'll go ahead and read what i wanted to read um let's see here um i'll just read verse 32 through 34 just for the sake of time but then i'll i'll go back and read and just kind of make some some comments on this amen if i if i can uh here verse 32 uh john bear record saying i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove and an abode upon him and i knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said in me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same as he which baptizeth with the holy ghost and i saw uh and the i s and i saw and bear record that this is the son of god amen you can be seated keep your bible open there to that particular passage uh we just want to again talk on the subject of vindicated truths and and i don't know how far we'll get but we'll just go as far as we can amen on today um i tell you the truth glory to god um here uh just a a quote or so just to read and um out of this message jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever god's prophet makes a statement here says when jesus came in on the scene and began to speak to the people i love that part god always giving vindications it says uh god always giving vindications it says oh now just be quiet a minute listen god always vindicates the truth uh that statement just blesses my heart and if i can put it this way god does not vindicate lies god don't do that now man may do that but god don't put his stamp of approval on lies god but god always praise god god always vindicates the truth and i'ma just break in just for a moment on that we always use the word vindicate amen and and we like to be vindicated praise god if we involved in something and you know we want our name to be vindicated in this amen but but but when we use the word vindicate i went to just get a a a dictionary definition and what vindicate mean is clear of suspicion so when god vindicates truth no one should have any more suspicions no one should wonder whether it's right or not no one should have questions in their mind as to could this be a could it not be i i told you a few weeks ago the very elect praise god cannot be deceived amen and before i even came to this message i read my bible and i knew what jesus promised me in matthew 24 and 24 if i am elected i cannot be deceived hallelujah and i'm and i'm telling you i got i'm following a message this morning that has been clear oh come on somebody cleared of all suspicions amen i don't care what google can produce it's clear of suspicion hallelujah look at this god always vindicates the truth no matter what man that's the reason today we can't have faith see faith is not based upon the shifting sins of man's theology faith can only be based upon the the solid rock of god's eternal word now when they say shifting sands of men's theology uh i was listening to a brother speak you know when the catholic church first started talking about the trinity they actually did not did not even include the holy spirit in the trinity it was they said they talk about god the father and god the son and then they added the holy spirit years later they they doctrine was shifting that's right oh hallelujah and there's meaning today when you look at denominational dractions the doctrines shift but what we received we still standing on 30 and 40 years later look at this he says uh faith can only be based upon the solid rock of god's eternal word that's the only place that faith can rest it's the only resting place that faith has because the bible says so not what the preacher says not what papa said but what god said that's where faith is solid to the believer if god said it that settles it see there's your resting place amen amen now notice he didn't say god said it i believe it that stuff it don't matter whether you believe it or not it's still set up because god said it it says with such a shifting condition as we're in today how can faith rest itself you got to come back to the bible back to the truth and when jesus a carpenter's son physically speaking when he come to the earth here that's all he was known of and the day that john when john baptized him god vindicated him i like that clear suspicions the day that john baptized them god vindicated him god spoke from head from the heavens john saw the coming in the form of a dove and said this is my beloved son in whom i'm in whom i'm pleased to dwell the right translation there is who i whom i am pleased to dwell in jesus immediately anointed with god he was just a man till that time oh wow he was just a man to that time but now he becomes the god man when he's vindicated he becomes the god man someone telling me here not long ago as as i many times referred to him in the shipless day that he was just a prophet he was a god man i mean he was a good man he was more than that he was the anointed god the bible said god was in christ reconciling the world to himself god in christ amen now i want to just uh uh just kind of uh go back to our scripture that we were reading here i started at verse 32 but really what i want to do is start at verse 21. now uh there's a couple of truths that are actually being vindicated you know what i let me uh before i go there let me let me go to this as we just talk about truth and i'm still in my my journey of uh stepping to the vision amen i'm i'm actually using the quote as we're coming towards the end hopefully i'll read it for you today but uh you know as we just think about truth everybody got a different definition of what truth is all right nowadays people will tell you see your truth is not my truth my truth is not your truth right everybody has redefined what truth is amen truth that fits their particular lifestyle yeah yeah hallelujah right so so we have a we have a real problem that we can't get people to center amen on on what god said in his word whether that's the truth i'ma tell you for me i'mma place my faith on what god spoke in his word that's gonna be my truth hallelujah i'm gonna govern my life and i'm gonna live my life by what god says in his word why because god is the only one that has a heaven or a hell for me to go to after i leave here hallelujah somebody i'm not basing my faith on what somebody else say i want to know what god says truth amen has many um definitions and and one of them amen i was looking at truth is conformity uh to fact it's honesty you know when you when you're telling somebody be truthful right amen you're saying be honest don't don't pull don't pull no punches don't lie to me be truthful tell me tell me exactly what happened all right right amen you want them to be honest in their approach because if you if you if if a person's not gonna be honest with you you can't trust anything they say come on somebody you want them to be truthful be honest and sometimes i'm gonna tell you when folk are truthful the truth will hurt you [Music] oh my god amen the truth will amen will kind of make you have some second thoughts but actually when that's happening you know the devil's inside of that because jesus said the truth is supposed to make you free not take you into depression that's not what the truth does the truth makes you free that's right hallelujah i was looking at this and i went to uh some some software that i used sometimes to get definitions and amen it's called the illumina software and uh and i got to be careful when i use this because i know this aluminum software has a tint of catholicism in it come on right so so i have to kind of weigh what i say and what i don't say amen it's just the same thing with theologians some of them i'm agree with sometime but not all the time even brother branham couldn't agree with with schofield's notes all the time sometime he hit it sometime he didn't you got to have the spirit of discernment to be able to know what's right and what's wrong you got to be able to judge what is truth now look at this they made a statement here in this software if it's truth it'll stand the test of time i agree with that if you're telling the truth it'll stand the test of time right because uh uh if you're lying you're gonna have to you gotta keep telling that same lie over and over and then when people start asking you questions and you realize you about found out you come up with another lie and your lie keep changing but if you tell the truth no matter who it hurt come on somebody when you stand on the truth you ain't got to change the story the truth will stand the test they use the scripture on this proverbs 12 19 and i want to give that to you today proverbs 12 19 glory to god amen truth will stand the test of time but lies are soon exposed and look at this the bible says in proverbs 12 19 the lip of truth shall be established forever glory but a lying tongue is but for a moment amen that lying gonna last forever the truth will remain forever oh glory to god but when you lie you gotta keep changing it now hallelujah god want to deliver you from that line spirit because liars ain't gonna make it to heaven all right now come on somebody amen let me go on with another statement they make they say the truth never changes the truth never changes when you tell the truth it never changes amen and they made some notes here i want to give them to you truth is always timely uh it applies today and in the future truth applies right now and in the future glory to god because it's connected with god's changeless character truth is connected to god's changeless character look it's also changeless think for a moment about the centuries that have passed since the proverbs were written consider the countless hours that have been spent and careful study over every sentence of scripture the bible has withstood the test of time because god is truth you can trust his word to guide you and i love this i read this a little earlier amen um and nowadays you know we got we got people kind of doubting uh who who wrote the bible god god allowed man to write the bible but it was inspired by god inspired by god just a man put that together no no no god allowed man to write it but it was inspired by god amen right over generations it was spot and and i just read this scripture in psalms 105 the lord is good as mercy's everlasting and his truth will and do it all generations so if the word worked in my generation the word gonna work in my children's generation the word gonna work in my grandchildren's generation we ain't got to change nothing in the church to try to keep young people give the young people the truth glory to god give them the truth the truth will keep them praise god amen amen another thing to say the truth gains strength under pressure you i like that the truth actually gets stronger under pressure hallelujah they said truth untested by life's experiences may become static and stagnant they said suffering can bring a dynamic quality to life you don't really we don't realize that but jesus made a statement uh the bible said jesus learned obedience by the things he suffered right glory to god now i was uh i was just kind of meditating on that the things that jesus suffered he gained obedience to and how truth is going to amen get stronger under pressure uh uh uh under pressure brings out better things it brings out greater things it brings out more important things when you when you're standing under pressure with truth oh glory to god amen now i was thinking on the life of the lord jesus amen he was innocent while he was standing before a pilot and pilate asked him to amen to give a an account of himself just to defend himself and jesus actually refused to defend himself hallelujah amen now he had a right to defend himself he had a right to say something at that moment and and i want you to know that had jesus defended himself oh glory to god we wouldn't be sitting here right now had he defended himself we wouldn't experience some of the things that we experienced in life i was just i was just thinking how do you defend himself there might have been a different story told come on somebody by refraining from defense he was nailed to a cross yeah i want you to get it now by refraining from defense amen he was placed in a borrowed tune amen all this happened because he refused to defend himself by refraining from defense he conquered death hell and the grace see had he defended himself it would have been a different story written but because he chose not to defend himself he knew what the truth was but he refused to defend himself he was the truth amen but he refused to defend himself and i i want you to get something here because if you can learn how to refrain from defending yourself even when you know what the truth is [Music] even when you know the truth through to refrain from defending yourself because the story's gonna get great on the other end come on church i hope we get that amen the testimony gonna get greater when you refuse to defend yourself oh church i don't know if we get it yet you ain't gotta fight with truth when you know the truth is let god fight your battle oh hallelujah church see the story got greater because he refused to defend himself oh church amen we would have never heard of a resurrection amen because the man would have never amen uh maybe he would have never came to the place of actually accusing jesus releasing him into the hands of amen the the the the jewish leaders of that day maybe the story would have been a lot different but jesus refused to defend himself look at this by refraining from defense his outcome made things better for everybody amen by refraining from this defense i myself have experienced a personal resurrection amen you see it's it's something about truth it gains strength under pressure and see i was thinking on this and say you know when you're under pressure pressure's supposed to produce a power oh glory press yourself with producer power and and i thought about david and goliath david in the in the army of israel was under pressure glory to god and when david amen the children of israel were out there watching goliath go back and forth and make his posts amen david knew that he was standing on truth and the truth that david had is that we are amen the children we are representing the living god and they say as representatives of the living god we're not supposed to live in fear come on church as representatives of the living god we're not supposed to be defeated david say i'm tired of y'all being defeated for 30 days how much longer is this going to go how much longer we gonna act like this somebody gotta do something now and david could draw on his own his old experiences man i defeated a bear one time i defeated a lion one time i did not have a sword but i have a rock and a sling in my hand and if god delivered me before then god will deliver me again this goliath praise god you need to speak to the goliath that is in your life this goliath is gonna be like that lion this goliath is gonna be like that pair i've been looking for the number three amen i had a lion i had a bear but where's number three goliath is gonna be number three give that back to me praise god hallelujah goliath is gonna be number three praise god david say look i'm representing the armies of the living god it says i'm standing on truth we're not supposed to be defeated like this we're not supposed to be running and hiding from this guy i don't care how big he is i don't care how great he is he says let me go out there i take my lion i take my my slingshot and my rock and i guarantee i'll knock this guy down and david went out there standing on truth as to who his god was and who he was representing and when he went out there and slung that rock goliath went tumbling down and the good thing about david he didn't just stop by slaying him with a rock he took goliath sword praise god god knows how to use what the enemy is trying to use against you god knows how to take that and slay the enemy with it brother haman may be building gallows but he does not realize he's building them for himself [Applause] praise god amen whatever trap that the devil is planning for you the devil gonna fall in that trap himself praise god somebody stand on the truth stay with the words hallelujah don't be you ain't you you're not gonna be defeated you're not going to be defeated praise god you got to know who you are in christ [Music] i'm walking in power hallelujah i said i'm walking in power and before i even start my battle i'm claiming victory [Applause] [Music] standing on truth representing truth glory to god vindicated truths amen when david got finished with goliath they knew god was with david and i've said it before i'll say it again david was the only man in the kingdom of israel that could go against goliath and not die he was the only one in israel now brother jack how can you say that because david had already been pre-anointed [Applause] if goliath would have took david had off somehow the head would have came back and connected to the body [Applause] david would have jumped up with another rock and slung it again and everybody would have been wondering what in the world is happening here no we know what's happening the man has been pre-anointed king of israel [Applause] and when you've been predestinated when you've been pre-anointed by almighty god there is nothing that the devil can do that can block you from receiving what god has for you i don't care what you go through i don't care what you in right now you can't stop god why because god has broke truth over you any time god speaks that saith the lord he has spoken that would have never came out of david had goliath not been doing what he was doing you understand they would have never known david would have never known he could take goliath [Applause] say it again had he not been under pressure i want to tell you something else that happens when your friends see you take a lifetime your friends get inspired your friends getting skirt and courage your friends are ready to take goliath's family out and goliath had a brother with six fingers and six toes he looked worse than goliath but david's friends were encouraged if david can take goliath down i'll take his brother down truth is that which is real and can be verified and confirmed by experience truth is real and can be verified and confirmed by experience i went to my um greek lexicon just trying to what is this truth this truth let's let's let's let's let's look at this from different angles i gave you aluminum now i'm giving you greek lexicon and in the greek lexicon they use the word uh alathia when you talk about truth allah fire right and and it is and it just simply means uh that candor of mine which is free from affection pretense i ain't pretending right simulation falsehood or deceit right it's a state of mind that's just free of i ain't trying to deceive nobody right i i'm not trying to pretend i'm just going to be myself and also say it's free of affection i'm not using amen uh my my emotions to try to evoke some type of response amen truth is simply truth they had some scriptures here that were related to this this um uh uh aletheia alithia i think that's how they pronounce it i'm not a greek scholar so i don't know amen but uh but they had some uh some scriptures here and and one of the scriptures that they used was a man the woman with the issue of blood and how this woman had gone from doctor to doctor trying to find somebody that can deal with her situation and for 12 years the lady found no doctor no specialist could handle her circumstance and here this lady still had a condition she's out of money amen and just doesn't know where to turn but one day it just so happened in her city jesus christ was passing through and as jesus is passing by the lady saying now what's all the noise for what what is everybody doing this and why everybody running and gathering what's going on here and maybe she's on the way back to the house uh after the last doctor's visit somebody say jesus is in touch she say what jesus is here and say say yeah yeah jesus here so this lady amen was a little late getting started and the reason i say she was late getting started because the bible say she pressed through the crowds come on somebody and sometimes you got to press through some doubt sometimes you have to press through some some disappointment sometimes you have to press through things that didn't go your way but press through the crowd and no matter how you press just as long as you touch the hem of his garment the bible says she came from behind and she touched him of his garment and instantly the lady was made whole amen her touch was so real that jesus stopped in his tracks and said who touched me peter's saying now jesus all these people touching you why would you ask a question like that he said he said no no no no no peter i i some i i felt virtue leave my body i know somebody has touched me hallelujah nobody else in that that that that audience nobody else in that group of people oh hallelujah amen could understand what jesus was really saying but this lady oh hallelujah church everybody i said well yeah i'll touch you no no no no you're not the one yeah i touch you no no no no you didn't touch me like somebody else touched me now now not that he didn't know who touched him but he was waiting for her to tell the truth he was just simply waiting for her to tell the truth and can i tell you god is waiting on some of you to tell the truth with no pretense come on somebody amen no ulterior motives just speak truth bible saying mark 5 33 jesus was looking around trying to find who this was he stopped the crowd and said i need to find who this is that touched me in mark 5 33 the bible says by the woman fearing and trembling knowing what was done in her she knew that thing had stopped that she was healed right then just by touching him she said she you got to understand something about this lady she realized because of the levitical laws and things of that nature he could not come and touch her because of her condition he could not come and touch her he can visit her at her house this lady say now the levitical law said he can't touch me but the law didn't say i can't touch him so that's why she came from behind and touched the hem of his government and when she did she turned the water away he said no stop the crowd stop the crowd stop everybody stop what you're doing right now i need to know who touched me i need to know this i need to and now he was doing this for a reason he was putting late in the spot because her testimony when she shared it now he could have told her since you touch me you got this and you got that and god just delivered you from that that would have been one thing but it's a different thing when you share your own testimony [Applause] it's one thing when somebody else share your testimony but it's a whole nother thing when you speak it yourself amen she said but the woman fearing and trembling knowing what was done in her came and fell down before him and told him oh the truth see i mean when we talk about this word uh alethea right this was an example of it how this woman came she told all the truth look i i did this i did that i did this and i said within myself if i could just touch the hem of your garment i'll be made whole and jesus i was just made whole something happened on the inside of me just by touching the hem of your garment she was also fulfilling scripture because the bible said that there would be healing in his wings come on church and the wings were actually at the bottom of the garment there was healing in his wings can i tell you something if you can't even touch jesus touch his wings they had a couple more scriptures on this truth in john 4 24 amen it said god is a spirit come on somebody and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth that was identified in amen the greek lexicon and i want to just go a little further with that because you know worshiping and spirit and in truth is not just a church but it's a real place in christ come on somebody it's a real place in christ first you need to understand why you worship him amen you need you need to know who god really is he he's unfolding and revealed himself so that we know what we're worshiping [Music] brother we're not worshiping christ in the manger but the prophet said we're worshiping christ in you the hope of glory god needed flesh and he's using your flesh brother adam say this redeemed flesh is not housing god spirit and truth is not just a church but it's a place in christ however google is a little con confused because i i went to google i said i need to know what truth is i just put in the search truth at my house and google brought me back some results it gave me 1 billion 20 million results in about six in about uh six seconds i think something like that point six seconds um and uh i noticed here in the results that the name of the church was located eighth in the list out of 1 billion 20 million results looking for truth google said the eighth place spirit and truth [Applause] i'm sure the search amen is simply of his vicinity is vicinity related because i was at my house and i'm very close to the church so it was vicinity related the church was listed number one amen as far as churches that had the word truth within their name come on somebody no not now google is the one that gave these results i didn't put that there but google said it oh hallelujah so i thought to myself could it be that google is quite aware where one will discover truth if you're looking for truth you got a question why not go according to google to spirit and truth oh hallelujah somebody that was google's suggestion you see there's another thing here in john 8 32 when we want to know what truth is and i base my faith on this particular statement john 8 32 says ye shall know the truth and the truth will make you free so the truth is the lord jesus christ he is the way the truth and the life right i was just thinking on this and i want to go back now and just hit uh john for a little bit if i can amen amen amen let's pick this up in john 1. we were just reading this earlier truth i mean vindication is is clear of suspicion we want to clear all the suspicions thank you lord jesus john 1 verse 21 says this uh they asked him what then are elijah now this is the the the pharisees sadducees religious leaders of this day they're asking they're confronting john with questions uh uh wha well i thought elijah and he said i am not arthur that prophet and he answered no now now first of all i want you to understand just the mere fact that they're asking john these questions they know there's something special about john they know there's something spec this ministry is very unique right that i mean there's something to this we we want to now they're looking at scripture they know that an elijah is supposed to come they're also looking at scripture when they say art thou that prophet what prophet they referring to there was a prophet that moses spoke about in deuteronomy 18 the lord your god will raise up a prophet like unto me and here they thought john was that prophet but john said no no no no that's not me let's keep reading verse 22 they said unto him who art thou we know you're somebody but who art thou glory to god and uh he says uh uh that that we may give and answer to them that sinners what says thou of thy self love this i love this this statement because see you got to be able to identify yourself in scripture hallelujah now i know the devil got all kinds of things to say about you the devil call you a loser the devil called you defeated the devil say you in his back pocket right the the devil got all kind of things that he's saying about you you a fake you are phony i don't even know why you even go to church you're a hypocrite that's what the devil got to say about you but but but god got a i mean a question that comes out of the scripture what says of thyself i say i'm more than a conqueror amen i say i will not be defeated i don't care how down i feel i'ma still enter his courts with his gates with thanksgiving into his course i'm going with praise i i tell the devil like that like like brother branham told the total devil say even if i go and serve god with everything i got and at the end he tell me that he gonna send me to hell i'ma still serve him amen look at this what says thou thyself verse 23 he said i see he identified himself now i am the voice of one crying in the wilderness make straight the way of the lord as as said the prophet isaiah going back to prophecy all right it says and they which were sent were of the pharisees and they asked him and said unto him why baptize us doubt then if thou be not that christ nor elijah neither that prophet watch this they're trying to get him to stop baptizing says john answered them saying i baptized with water but there standeth one among you whom you know not that means christ is already here that christ that you're looking for he is he is among you who you don't even know he already been born he's standing in your midst and you don't realize who he is let's keep going here it is who coming after me is preferred before me glory to god whose shoes latch it i am not worthy to unloose these things were done in bar and that that the fabric uh beyond jordan where john was baptizing the very next day i like this scripture right here john is telling them they they brought these questions and just said no i'm not the one but i know this much he's standing in your midst i can't tell you who he is but i know he's standing in your midst if you hang around church long enough then i'll reveal to you who he is all right i mean and and and i could say that because john was given a special key to recognize who christ was amen when john amen saw certain things happen all his suspicion would be gone watch this watch this the next day john see of jesus coming unto him and said behold the lamb of god which taketh away the sin of the world this is he of whom i said after me cometh a man which is preferred before me for he was before me can you imagine that john just preached a sermon yesterday oh glory to god and on the next day the sermon was vindicated [Applause] see i i i believe amen like like the prophet said you know the dynamics to the church will be a refilling of the holy ghost and whether that's god coming and vindicating his word the very next day that john preached the sermon his sermon was vindicated when jesus showed up watch this now watch this verse 30 amen 31 it says and i knew him not but that he should be made manifest to israel therefore am i come baptize him with water and john bear records saying i saw the spirit this was the key that john had i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it'll bowed upon him it stayed with him praise god this is the key god gave me when i see the spirit deceive and stay oh glory glory glory church that's what we're looking for we want to see the spirit come and stay we don't want just something on our flesh but we want this to go home with you something that'll cause you to live right when you go outside an anointing that will come and stay oh praise god amen thank you jesus glory to god look at it it says uh uh it abode upon him and i knew amen and i and i knew him not but he that sent me he that sent me to baptize with water the same saturn to me glory to god is the same voice it's the same voice the same said unto me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same as he which baptizes with the holy ghost and i saw and bear record that this is the son of god all of john's suspicions were gone when he saw the spirit rest on jesus and abide to john can i put it that way to john not the pharisees not not the others not not the sadducees but to john vindicated there was actually two vindications that took place in that one scripture when john saw amen the the anointing rest on jesus he was very he knew jesus was the one that god spoke to him about it was vindicated all suspicion was gone but the mere fact that jesus came to john oh come on somebody the mere fact that jesus came to john to be baptized vindicated john's ministry and they said i had no questions as to who he was because jesus just vindicated john's ministry we got two vindicated truths two vindicated truths oh glory to god i want to just say something here just them in fact see the reason that jesus had to go to john to be baptized is simply because the sacrifice that's why john said john say look i'm not even worthy uh to baptize you i need to be baptized of you you're preferred before me you say i'm not worthy this he said he said jesus jesus had to get him said little john suffered to be so suffering to be so there's a reason that i'm doing this you might not understand okay even a prophet john didn't catch it all right oh glory jesus had to tell him to say no suffer to be so and the reason god god sent us a prophet that told us why this had he said because the sacrifice had to be washed before it could be offered so christ had to be and and and we just read the quote brother branham say even before that time he was just a man but when he got baptized in the spirit of bold on him he became a god man something changes when you receive the holy ghost amen truth you see you've been you've been defeated the reason you live in the life that you live in because you don't have the holy ghost [Applause] you you thought you had it just because of feeling but your your your life proves you don't have it so now it's time to get desperate you understand don't just come to church and play games now it's time to get desperate can i can i tell you come on thank you brother don't pretend don't don't don't act like you got it because anybody can put on a show but it's not time to tell the truth because when you tell the truth the truth will set you flee when that woman came to jesus she told the truth and god is waiting on some of you to tell the truth god i ain't got it but god i want it god i need it lord i'm being honest with you i'm telling you the truth no more pretending no more acting i want to be truthful i i wanna be honest vindicate me lord give me your holy ghost it can't be no other way it's time to be honest with god that's right god i ain't got what i've been i've been i've been faking and fooling and and i i i they put a sign i was telling you tell everybody this couple weeks ago you know you sometimes you might you might deceive the the pastor some of the stuff you do it might deceive the pastor but you know it's the truth gonna always come out that life that that lion life that you live in gonna be manifested somewhere down the road come on amen the light gonna shine on that stuff and when once it's exposed you're in trouble then and now it's time to just just just be truthful be honest with god god this ain't no holy ghost life living like this holy ghost don't do things like this stop stop reasoning just be honest be real with god god i need the holy ghost [Applause] not not just something that just you know i i like we just right here i don't want just to come and leave come and abide it'll be with me 24 7. [Applause] something caused me to live right [Applause] we can't play games with this right it's got to be real something happened on the inside oh my you know how many people go to church and can put on a good move if there was ever time to shout now was the time to shout out when the when the truth come you should have been shouting over the truth but what the truth is doing is shouting that spotlight please god right into the area where it needs to be shine we gon get that devil out of there praise god please call me man the truth has come to set you free [Applause] amen glory hallelujah god help us right here see we we we need this this is it when john can identify when it was real yes that's right john john wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait this is the one because because because it's it's coming on him and it's a it's abiding it's staying it stays with this guy when he when he walked when he comes up out the water he walking with whatever came on him when i see him tomorrow he gonna have it when i see him next week he gonna still have it right he said this thing this is abiding on him that's right see if you want your life to be changed the only the holy ghost power i mean i don't care how much revelation you get that ain't gonna get it i don't care how much we shout and jump that ain't gonna get it you know the devil let you shout actually the devil will join you in the shouts he'll be your partner go ahead you get one now boy did we have a time and leave right out of here going right back into the same old lifestyle see truth truth truth truth we need truth truth actually just does something to our conditions truth changes our circumstances true truth changes our situations we need truth see when truth came to the woman at the well her life was changed that's right and and notice how the way she acted when jesus began to reveal all the things that was going on yeah you know go get your husband um now you know he didn't let off the hook go get your husband she had to say something that's right that's right what was she gonna do what could she say at that moment what story could she make up right when jesus said go get your husband uh husband only thing she could say i mean you can just imagine what you're trying to go through in her mind what do i say i don't have a husband you spoke well not only that i know you ain't got no husband so stop living like you married get that man at your house get that woman at your house the one you living with right now is not your husband [Music] now we know when messiah come we've been told that she knew something yeah even though she was in the world to see him she knew something you know and see that's what that's the thing is i know you know something you know something that's why you're doing what you're doing you know something there's a seed been planted there and i don't care how far you go you can't get away from that seed gotta redeem you and your whatever you leave it like that amen it says um we know when messiah come he gonna reveal these things um i'm talking about women come he say i'm here that speak to you now notice notice who messiah was talking to somebody with a life so can i use my my name in this so jacked up okay that's it messiah was talking to the woman with a life in a mess i want to know i want you to know why messiah talks to the one that's their life is in a mess because the greater the mess the greater the testimony so you think the devil done did this and the devil did that god gonna use that for his glory i found out a long time ago that all things [Applause] put it in the bucket brother put it in the buckets put this thing in the bucket put that thing in the pocket whatever it is that you're going through put it in the romans 8 28 bucket all things will work together for good to them that love god and to them praise his holy name that's been called according to his purpose [Applause] satan you don't have no purpose for my life i belong to god i'm gonna love god i'm gonna live for god praise his holy name this thing that thing all things everything work together jesus had to speak to this woman and the bible said he had need need to go by samaria and when god began to deal with her he said jesus sent the disciples away because he needed one-on-one attention with her [Music] i don't need y'all to be around here go go get go we need something to eat go get y'all go buy some vittles well if those disciples would know that he don't never need nothing if he wants something he'll make it he'll create it himself i'm gonna stay right here i don't know what's getting ready to happen but i'ma stay right here but because they was hungry they went to the town to get some vitals sometimes you hungry for the wrong stuff [Music] [Applause] you need the hunger more for the things of god amen but he says to it's it's he says uh yeah go get the videos and and why they they come back and they see jesus talking to this woman that's just communicating oh lord do we know what kind of woman this is oh lord why oh jesus jesus your reputation your reputation i heard a preacher say see when you want to know what's going on in the town go to the prostitutes house because all the men of the town have been in her house and they didn't share all their problems with her so the man if you want to know what's going on go to the process out that's why the the uh the the two spies in that went to jericho they went to rahab's house rehab had the information rahab knew what they were talking about rahab can say they're afraid they're afraid but i'm gonna tell y'all what i know y'all not here for no business but i i need to i need to say something to you when y'all come to destroy would you make me a promise that you won't kill my people so here go scarlet thread hang this out the window oh glory to god hang this scholar thread out your window and now i'm gonna tell you something you can't put the scarlet thread out today [Applause] as soon as the spies leave you never know when the spies are coming you don't know when jesus coming so you better get your scholar threat the holy ghost and you better leave it on display and i don't care how many people pick at you for this new ornament that you got hanging out your window why would you do something like that ray have what you doing i know what i'm doing because you ain't been visited like i've been visited you ain't been promised like i've been promised and i'm gonna tell you something else if you want some safety if you want some safety here's a here's the thing you don't have one of these i'm the only one in the set in the town with one of these so the only safety in the town is where this is at and if you want some safety you better come in the house if you want to be free from sin you better come in the house you want to get delivered you better come in the house and when you get to the house you better stay in the house praise god [Applause] this ain't a sunday morning token this is seven days a week 24 hours a day we want the spirit to come and abide [Applause] the only safety was where this was church i i don't i don't think we said enough jesus is coming soon a lot sooner than you think and i'm gonna tell you that that would get us so wrapped up in nonsense as well say ain't one president save me [Applause] that's it didn't save me right my confidence is in it's just politics that's all it and look you can't control who go who's going to be what amen it's going it's going to be what it's going to be and i know you're doing your civic duty i got nothing wrong i'm not going to knock you for that i'm lucky for that whatever you do i voted i voted but i wrote somebody in on the ballot [Applause] i wrote a name in on the ballot but i voted [Music] amen he's on the outside of his church knocking trying to get back in [Applause] amen i don't know where i was i'm i'm just all over the place i'm all over the place i know i talked about by the woman at the well but what it was that jesus knew that her testimony would have a greater impact in the city when the people saw her go free right right my god my god brother joseph they went free a three three-day revival the people said jesus don't leave don't go nowhere stay right here we need this when y'all gonna get to the point saying i ain't going nowhere i'ma stay right here i need this i was talking about somebody else before i talked about that woman at the well yeah no i talked about i went from the woman at the well to rehab right and so that's not my note so i'm now my 50-something year old mind is trying to just recollect where where am i lord one with the bloody i talked about her did i finish her i think i did brother it's still not coming all right it's like this when god wants to speak to he speak to you it's not it's not me because i can't even tell you what i'm saying right now i don't even know what i'm saying i do know this much that we got to get our hearts right with god i know this much that we need the holy spirit to come and abide i know that much and if i if i can't drive any other point home make sure the truth was vindicated jesus vindicated john john vindicated jesus it was two vindicated truths took place right there so those people had no more questions about john jesus just identified them the problem was they probably was in church the next day john just preached the sermon and john told us and the next day what you got planned that's going to cause you to miss service next week see it's time to get our priorities rearrange shift it get into the house of god and get serious about god get serious about god right i mean otherwise the devil just gonna be using you for foolishness god won't use your body but the devil will take advantage of you so i i i i i don't even know where i'm at so i'm just i'm gonna have to let it go there there is something that i want to say about john but lord knows i don't know if i can get there to say it maybe i'll just read a quote and i'll just i'll i'll cut this off lord jesus yeah my thought is coming from spoken words original seed and uh i i'm not where i want to be but i just i'll set you up for where we're going john because he saw the spirit rest and abide on jesus knew that this was the one he was preaching about right but can i tell you something and this happens to christians sometimes you can be sure in your faith you can be certain but trials have a way of shaking you and john a prophet went through a tremendous trial he's suffering for the cause of christ now he'd already said i must decrease so that he can increase now he's already spoiled his word and now he's decreasing and when he decreases he goes through something that brother branham say it caused his eagle eye just to go a little damp because he went to prison john was taken to prison you know after baptizing on having this having this great ministry you know and and being used of god now john finds himself in prison yeah john had two disciples come visit him in the jail so now look um this jesus you know this is happening that happens like you know i'm just i know i know the spirit of bold on it but i you know i have been hearing too much but do me a favor go ask him the eagle eye john go ask him is he the messiah or should we look for another the same one that saw the vindicated messiah is now asking the question and let me tell you the reason that you get into a situation where you start asking questions your trial your trial produces the questions but i'ma tell you he the same yesterday today and forever he the same before your trial he the same in the midst of your trial and he gonna be the same after your trial i'm gonna tell you jesus was jesus received disciples come on boys y'all you know come on have service come on to the church come on sit down enjoy yourself say well we got a word from john okay after service i'll i answer the questions that you got now jesus knew what that question would jesus know why they came to church oh my jesus knew why they was in church so without the service i asked i answered the question went through the service healing line come discernment line and telling this one and telling that one and this one getting healed and that one oh what just the power of god moving then after the service y'all said y'all had a question yeah john wanted to know are you the one or should we look for another he said just go tell john the lame walk the blind sea the death have their ears unstopped and they start hearing say the dead are even race go tell john that not not i am the one just tell john about the manifestations because the manifestations is the vindication and when john heard about the vindications even in jail john could be encouraged because his end result was not like his beginning result his end result was that his head was on the platter all because he told amen the truth can hurt you but the truth will also set you free god bless you [Applause] praise the lord let's pray father you have given us your word i know you've spoken to us i know that you've been in control of this entire service but as truth comes lord i don't want us to pretend i don't want us to act lord i want us to be sincere we know we need you god we know that we can't live without you we can't we can't make it we have made a mess of things our lives are messed up because we didn't have what we claim we had but in your presence today we acknowledge that we don't have we don't have the holy ghost god that we've been talking about and preaching right we don't have it but god we want it and what you told us in your word is to repent to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and he said that you we we were we received the holy ghost that's what you promised god the prophet even said that you were obligated to give us the holy ghost when we come according to the word of god god i don't want to leave his church knowing that i'm not ready to meet you father i really really i want to be ready i want to be ready to walk in jerusalem like john and this is the this is the place where we get prepared this is where we get dressed here in the presence of god so lord my prayer is that we won't be
