[20:01] please come right on amen god bless you
[20:14] it's an honor and a privilege to be in
[20:16] the house of the Lord I'm just so
[20:19] thankful just to be here and I'm
[20:26] thankful for the mighty hands of God's
[20:28] protection on our lives even though even
[20:33] though when we don't know we need to be
[20:36] protected he's still there and this was
[20:42] such a event for me
[20:45] on yesterday I was going down okay okay
[20:51] you know Okeechobee Okeechobee and I was
[20:57] driving it was at night and I was going
[20:59] to make a left-hand turn into the home
[21:04] depot complex Plaza shopping center and
[21:09] so at that left hand cut away off the
[21:14] Okeechobee Road there's no light there
[21:17] and it was dark and so you have to try
[21:21] to measure the correct time you
[21:25] to get across and that so that I think
[21:28] this may have been first I don't know if
[21:31] it was the first or not oh but whatever
[21:33] reason this particular event I thought I
[21:39] had gauged it pretty good right I
[21:41] thought I had to look like a head of cat
[21:44] so in its three lanes and so I'm going
[21:49] into so I just pull in into the first
[21:52] lane and then you got another one in
[21:54] another the middle and over and so by
[21:57] the time I was going into the middle
[21:59] lane
[21:59] I looked really quickly and I saw I mean
[22:06] a car a truck actually a truck or
[22:09] without pulling a trailer I was probably
[22:13] no more than 20 feet from me passing
[22:15] going down the road and I had to slam on
[22:18] my brakes and he blew his horn and I'm
[22:20] slamming on my brakes and I'm like that
[22:23] was a very close call however mind you
[22:30] I'm in the middle of the road now
[22:31] stopped so you're that gauging part did
[22:34] you thinking you're right the cars are
[22:37] still coming so I'm sitting here in the
[22:40] middle of the road waiting for the truck
[22:42] to pass in this trailer and then as soon
[22:45] as it got through passed then I was like
[22:49] I need to get across this road really
[22:52] quick because these cars are coming so I
[22:54] pressed up huh gasps really hard and
[22:56] shot into the into the parking into the
[23:00] parking drive way for the shopping
[23:03] center I was so shook up just to think
[23:10] that I couldn't be standing here tonight
[23:16] it was just that close and just that
[23:20] dangerous
[23:22] and so I was just thinking the Lord and
[23:26] praising him for that protection the
[23:29] angels there once again and I didn't
[23:33] know that I was gonna need it at that
[23:35] moment but I needed it and he allowed me
[23:40] to get across safely and stand here
[23:45] tonight just to be a witness of what
[23:48] he's done and what he continues to do in
[23:51] our lives every day
[23:53] and so I'm so just thankful yet for him
[23:56] I was so shook up even when I got home I
[23:59] was nervous to even Drive and I got home
[24:02] I just had to lay down because my nerves
[24:04] was just really really antsy but I think
[24:09] God that my mind was clear in the midst
[24:14] of that to allow no allow that truck to
[24:17] go and then to clearly say ok get across
[24:21] into the drive and not just panicking
[24:24] well should I back up should I go you
[24:26] know it was just clear straight thought
[24:30] get over get in so it's just that peace
[24:35] that he brings in the midst of a
[24:39] confused situation he allows us to think
[24:43] clearly to get out of danger as it
[24:48] approaches so I just give God all the
[24:51] praise and the honor for what he
[24:55] continues to do for us each and every
[24:58] day some things we know about there's
[25:04] dangers that he protects us from we
[25:07] don't even know we don't know now but we
[25:10] will know one day and God bless you amen
[25:17] amen amen
[25:19] how many know he's our ever-present help
[25:22] in the time of trouble amen amen amen I
[25:27] tell you what we just thinking praising
[25:29] we have something to praise in for a man
[25:32] even the small things will
[25:34] think small it means just like the
[25:36] brothers say the things that we don't
[25:38] even know about a man let alone the
[25:41] things that we know about a man all of
[25:43] us can say he woke us up this morning
[25:45] started us on our way clothed in our
[25:48] right mind a man gave us a mind and a
[25:52] will to be in the house of the Lord one
[25:55] more time but it's those things we are
[25:57] not even aware of a man the danger that
[26:01] was lurking around the corner that we
[26:03] had no idea Amen that the angels were
[26:06] encamped around us that just protect us
[26:09] Amen you know you did the Satan has been
[26:12] trying to kill that seed since the
[26:14] beginning and that's what it is he's
[26:17] trying to destroy that seed amen amen
[26:19] but he can't he can't do it will remain
[26:22] victorious Amen sister you had something
[26:26] amen no okay no no I thought I saw you
[26:30] can't DUP don't be shy amen amen we're
[26:34] gonna try this song here sister bird
[26:37] please okay yes come on and give God
[26:41] glory there
[26:42] amen amen we're here to put our licks
[26:46] afar together
[26:47] amen amen well I do have a praise thank
[26:58] God for bringing me through the week
[27:00] something got a hold of me this week it
[27:03] really gave me a ride really gave me a
[27:06] ride but thank God I made it through him
[27:07] on the other side I think but this is I
[27:12] just want to share it and ask you all to
[27:14] be praying for this particular family
[27:16] yesterday I was sitting in my room and
[27:20] working on the computer and I begin to
[27:24] hear voices outside my window that still
[27:27] had the blinds closed so I thought my it
[27:30] might have been my son talking on the
[27:33] phone with somebody so the voices kept
[27:36] getting louder so I said better look I
[27:38] didn't see let's go out here and I
[27:41] looked out and it was just people
[27:43] everywhere people were everywhere along
[27:46] the banks of the river
[27:47] somewhere in the yard I look very close
[27:51] to my window and when I did and then I
[27:54] saw emergency vehicles lining the street
[27:58] just big trucks every everything cops
[28:02] everywhere oh my god what is going on
[28:06] out there so I threw something my own
[28:08] and stepped out and when I stepped out
[28:10] the front door I saw you the more people
[28:12] more vehicles and what have you so I
[28:14] caught my neighbors eye as I said what's
[28:17] going on and she said that they found
[28:20] the body
[28:21] in that water next to the house and it
[28:27] was just a scene they were treating it
[28:29] as a crime scene because they didn't
[28:32] know what it was about but apparently
[28:34] the man who died he was staying with his
[28:39] nephew a few houses down from the back
[28:42] of us and he had dementia Alzheimer's
[28:46] and he had walked away they were have
[28:49] been looking for him there was a
[28:51] missing-persons report out on him and
[28:53] the nephew he decided to just kind of
[28:56] walk along the canal and he walked and
[28:59] got down there back where I live and he
[29:03] found his uncle's body there so it was a
[29:06] it was a big scene they would have for
[29:08] quite a while they roped off my yard I
[29:10] couldn't get past the front door yes
[29:13] they were trying to keep the crowds back
[29:15] so that all of the news media and
[29:18] everything could come in and and just
[29:22] keep everybody away but there were it
[29:24] was just something to destruct my heart
[29:26] and it was so sad in all the years that
[29:28] we've lived I've never known anything
[29:31] like that to happen so just asked if you
[29:34] all be praying for that family I I don't
[29:36] the man's name was Earl Washington 89
[29:41] years old because it was on Palm Beach
[29:45] Post website be praying for that family
[29:47] because that's a very sad thing if he
[29:50] walked on that sea his uncle's body him
[29:52] just a very sad thing okay
[29:56] a man was certainly a man keep that
[30:04] Washington family in prayer amen so many
[30:08] times you know we used to growing up
[30:11] right there that we spent all kind of
[30:14] time near that water we used to play in
[30:18] that water and swam we used to do
[30:22] contests we can swim from one side to
[30:25] the other and it's when I realized that
[30:29] fresh water is not the same as the beach
[30:33] that water will pull you down it's the
[30:38] buoyancy is a lot different it's a lot
[30:40] more difficult to swim in fresh water
[30:43] than it is saltwater so and then any man
[30:47] in his and its up an age like that and
[30:51] dementia probably didn't know you know
[30:53] and so with this definitely some really
[30:56] sad situation keep that family lifted up
[30:59] in prayer my heart really goes out it's
[31:02] not something that I would want to have
[31:04] to experience a man so it may let us
[31:07] stand to our feet as we go before the
[31:09] con day anymore prayer requests that
[31:12] we'd like to pray over please I don't
[31:15] think we have any written let it open so
[31:19] I'm at a reasonably and I think we all
[31:21] have a prayer that just draw a little
[31:23] closer to him he ran a man so a man most
[31:28] gracious Heavenly Father Lord car we
[31:32] just come before you lord god Lord car

[43:13] a man once again on tonight wanted to
[43:17] just have word of Prayer
[43:19] I heard brother Collins there in
[43:24] Jeffersonville passed away he used to be
[43:27] the pastor at random Tabernacle but they
[43:34] went through some changes brother Joseph
[43:36] has now passed of a brand of tabernacle
[43:38] and brother Collins had another church
[43:39] that he started I believe his wife
[43:42] passed away last year and now he just
[43:44] passed away about two o'clock today so
[43:46] we want to remember that family and
[43:48] prayer and just trust that God would
[43:52] just even direct the church there that
[43:54] he was leading a man as well so we'll
[43:57] remember that in prayer this the other
[44:00] announcements Sunday don't forget we'll
[44:05] have a pinnacle palms at 5:30 and also
[44:09] the combined service a man amongst the
[44:13] churches that'll be happening in Boynton

[44:18] mind before we just entered to the word

[45:26] that as we enter into the word tonight
[45:27] that you would dismiss it to our hearts
[45:29] and to our knees may you give a strength
[45:31] through your word in Jesus name we pray
[45:34] amen amen god bless you thank you
[45:38] musicians thank you brother Troy and man
[45:41] we appreciate you on tonight
[45:44] amen praise the Lord a man I want to
[45:50] just read a scripture here at a Matthew
[45:52] 14 and I won't we'll just take a little
[45:58] thought here tonight a man and and our
[46:01] thought is just on fear not a man fear
[46:06] not we just trust that the Lord have
[46:10] just helped us through that but here in
[46:14] Matthew 14 starting at verse 14 is that
[46:18] right actually you know what I think I
[46:22] wrote that down right wrong it should be
[46:24] Matthew 14 and starting at verse 22 man
[46:30] verse 22 and it says straightway Jesus
[46:34] constrained his disciples to get into a
[46:37] ship and to go before him and to the
[46:40] other side while he sent the multitudes
[46:42] away and when he had sent the multitudes
[46:45] away he went up into the mountain apart
[46:48] to pray when the evening was come he was
[46:51] there alone but the ship was now in the
[46:53] midst of the sea tossed with waves for
[46:56] the wind was contrary and then the
[46:59] fourth watch of the night Jesus went
[47:02] unto them walking on the sea and when
[47:04] the disciples saw him welcome to sea
[47:06] they were troubled saying it is a spirit
[47:08] and they cried out for fear but
[47:11] straightway Jesus spake unto them saying
[47:14] be of good cheer it is I be not afraid
[47:18] and Peter answered him and said lord if
[47:21] it be thou
[47:22] bit me coming to the underwater and he
[47:25] said come and when Peter was come down
[47:28] out of the ship he walked on the water
[47:31] to go to Jesus and when he saw the wind
[47:35] boisterous he was afraid and beginning
[47:39] to sink he cried saying lord save me and
[47:43] immediately Jesus stretched forth his
[47:45] hand and caught him and said unto Him o
[47:48] thou of little faith wherefore didst
[47:52] thou doubt and when they were come into
[47:55] the ship the wind ceased and then they
[47:59] that were in the ship came and worshiped
[48:02] him saying of a truth thou art the Son
[48:04] of God amen the Lord had a blessing to
[48:07] the reading of his word amen again we
[48:09] want to just talk them the subject of
[48:11] fear not a man you can be seated tonight
[48:15] my man just kind of start this off a man
[48:20] with this quote out of the message
[48:23] Jehovah Jireh part three the Prophet
[48:26] makes a statement it says today people
[48:29] are something on the order like they was
[48:32] in the days when the disciples was out
[48:35] on the ocean it says one night a storm
[48:38] come up and there wasn't nothing all
[48:42] hopes was going that they ever be saved
[48:45] and they seen him come walking on the
[48:48] water now the ship was waterlogged the
[48:51] sails was broke the oars was gone so now
[48:54] brother Branham has given us a deeper
[48:56] description of what was going on you
[48:59] know and and and sometimes when we get
[49:03] the description right we begin to get a
[49:07] little bit sympathetic with with the
[49:10] fear that these brothers are actually
[49:13] experiencing often times when we hear a
[49:16] doctor's report a man and we see the you
[49:20] know just what's written down it's very
[49:22] easy for us to take on a man a spirit of
[49:27] fear right it's very easy because we're
[49:29] looking at all this information and you
[49:32] know so fears it's easy
[49:34] it just it just it comes and attacks you
[49:37] you know once we have some time too much
[49:39] information is not good right you know
[49:42] because it just produces you know a
[49:43] certain fear and so here brother branham
[49:47] just begins to kind of give us a little
[49:49] bit more clarity to say the was
[49:51] waterlogged it's full of water sales
[49:54] broke sales was broke and because
[49:58] they're orang I mean out there rolling
[50:00] in in such conditions the ores are now
[50:03] gone all right
[50:04] and it goes on to say to say they were
[50:06] holding one another can you imagine the
[50:08] disciples inside the boat holding each
[50:10] other fear right fear causes them to
[50:14] kind of do this they they look like they
[50:16] feel like they're in a hopeless
[50:17] situation but here you know they had a
[50:19] commandment from the Lord Jesus to just
[50:22] go to you know just going over to the
[50:24] other side so here arm you know here
[50:27] they're holding each other and not only
[50:29] that brother branham say there -
[50:30] screaming oh what a picture they're
[50:34] holding one another screaming and they
[50:36] look out there and they seen him come
[50:39] walking on the water and we're scared of
[50:42] him their only hope and they were afraid
[50:46] of the only thing that could save them
[50:49] right if that ain't the picture today
[50:51] again they thought it looks spooky you
[50:55] know they said they cried out for fear
[50:57] it was it was a spirit it looked it
[51:02] looked like spiritual that's the same
[51:05] thing in this day but if you if you just
[51:07] do like they did when they cried out
[51:09] they heard that voice coming here not it
[51:13] is I be not afraid be of good courage
[51:14] and if you'll just watch the word of
[51:17] promise for this day you'll hear that
[51:22] same voice speaking through the word he
[51:26] may not come walk into you a man on
[51:28] physical water because you're not there
[51:30] in the ship but he'll come walk him on
[51:32] the water of the words
[51:34] hallelujah he'll come walking on the
[51:36] water the word he say he said that
[51:37] you'll hear the same voice speaking
[51:39] through the word it's me I promise to do
[51:42] this in the last days
[51:44] fear not don't be scared put your trust
[51:46] in me the Son of God
[51:48] who is believe it now you know as the
[51:52] profit just kind of bringing that there
[51:54] and that in that sermon Jehovah Jireh
[51:55] you know I went back and I looked at the
[51:58] definition you know a fear we say fear
[52:00] not fear not and when we look at it one
[52:04] of the definitions that fear gives up
[52:06] you know that that's defined therefore
[52:08] the word fear it's anxiety caused by an
[52:13] expectation of evil anxiety that's
[52:19] caused by an expectation of evil right
[52:25] so so when a person is fearing they
[52:27] actually are expecting evil they're
[52:32] actually expecting of negative results
[52:36] they're actually expecting a man
[52:39] something bad to occur oh my god right I
[52:44] mean you know our faith in God's Word
[52:46] actually it is expecting God to to
[52:49] fulfill his promise hey man if you read
[52:52] what God said whatever he said to you
[52:54] whatever condition you're in if you read
[52:56] that and you grab a hold of our faith
[52:58] they're not then you begin to expect God
[53:00] to do exactly what he said it's going to
[53:02] do and like that the expectations of
[53:04] faith changes your outlook
[53:06] it changes your attitude it changes your
[53:09] approach but when you have fear ain't
[53:13] man there's an expectation that
[53:15] something evil about to happen you know
[53:18] I've seen you know I know different
[53:22] people you know there was a lady that
[53:25] you know we we knew she had developed a
[53:29] conditioner body I think it was cancer
[53:31] something like that that lady began to
[53:33] make preparation for you know her death
[53:36] she began to get everything in order she
[53:39] just knew that you know that she was
[53:40] gonna die real soon and you know within
[53:42] within months that lady was gone
[53:45] I mean her expectation was that she was
[53:47] gonna die with him much she was going
[53:49] right I've seen other people that
[53:51] applied faith and they they would fight
[53:53] cancer to the end right I mean they
[53:56] didn't fight for years with cancer right
[53:58] but but you know it just shows that when
[54:00] you apply faith is a
[54:01] result then when you actually operate in
[54:04] fear fear is an expectation of evil an
[54:08] expectation of a bad outcome you
[54:11] actually expected that remember we had
[54:12] our brother what's it brother gassing
[54:17] yeah you know but he been here a couple
[54:19] times man I need to get him here again
[54:21] he was on the video I mean yeah the
[54:24] video that we saw the other day a
[54:26] PowerPoint but he was talking about how
[54:28] he used to fear the deer so he would
[54:31] drive home at night and and you know and
[54:34] he would always when he's in his car
[54:36] he's always like you know Lord I don't
[54:37] want to hit a deer lord I don't want to
[54:40] hit a deer Lord I don't want to hear it
[54:42] hit a deer you know and and as as he's
[54:45] he's you know riding home at night
[54:46] thinking that way every time you think
[54:49] that way a deer just pop up out of
[54:50] nowhere and Wham he hits the deer
[54:52] Tampa's calm everything and he just
[54:55] noticed that it was always because he
[54:57] had a certain amount of fear of hitting
[54:59] the deer that the deer was show up and
[55:02] when he began to change his attitude
[55:03] about that I know hitting oh dear ain't
[55:06] no deer gonna come out here front of my
[55:07] car when they begin to change his
[55:08] attitude he wasn't hitting no more deers
[55:10] but but his fear actually brought the
[55:13] beer it's his fear to bring a deer what
[55:18] can faith to us tonight
[55:21] glory to God right amen but but fear is
[55:25] an expectation of evil but when we got
[55:28] faith we're expecting we expecting God
[55:30] to do exactly what he said he would do
[55:33] you know there was um I was just reading
[55:37] an article and they were talking about
[55:39] this lady that she had six floors that
[55:44] she would ride up the elevator to get to
[55:48] her apartment and six floors and you
[55:50] know in the middle of the day by about
[55:52] 12 o'clock and as she was riding up the
[55:55] floors they lost power in the building
[55:58] so here she is stuck in the elevator and
[56:01] so the elevator she's in there alone
[56:03] dark no lights and I mean she's in there
[56:07] and this anxiety just begin to kick in
[56:10] and and when it kicked in the first
[56:13] thing she did is just reach her phone
[56:14] and
[56:15] she called her mom just to kind of try
[56:17] to talk to her mom a little bit but some
[56:19] kind of way I guess you know I don't
[56:20] know if - if she didn't get a connection
[56:22] I don't know what happened but uh but
[56:24] for some reason anxiety just kept
[56:26] kicking kept kicking and say by the time
[56:29] they got to the lady she was completely
[56:31] unconscious I think they got to in 30
[56:33] minutes and by the time they got to her
[56:35] she was completely unconscious from
[56:37] being in that elevator for 30 minutes
[56:39] right she was gone and and they got it
[56:42] to the hospital and within hours the
[56:44] lady was dead young lady gone and and
[56:47] they were saying that you know from the
[56:50] surface it looked like she died from
[56:52] just being a freak right just that that
[56:55] was the things you're just afraid i'ma
[56:57] tell you glory to God as believers when
[57:00] we get ourselves of some touch tough
[57:02] situations there's a lot of things we
[57:04] can do one of them is you know start
[57:06] quoting scripture quoting scripture
[57:09] first thing coming in mind just start
[57:10] coding scripture another thing if you
[57:12] ain't got you can't remember scripture
[57:13] gotta give you a song and you just begin
[57:16] to sing that song and and as you get
[57:18] under the North turn that song I mean
[57:20] all of a sudden you you forget about
[57:21] what's around you you ready to shout you
[57:24] ready to praise God because it brings an
[57:26] anointing you actually begin to drive
[57:28] fear back hallelujah you drive fear back
[57:33] with your actions
[57:34] Loree their God amen
[57:37] there's another little something that I
[57:39] found on the internet a man and I want
[57:41] to just read it to you here before we go
[57:43] further there was the question was how
[57:46] fear can affect your body how fear can
[57:49] affect your body says the body's first
[57:52] and natural reaction to feelings of fear
[57:56] is to fight or flight right you see the
[57:59] fight-or-flight response right and this
[58:03] is often characterized by certain
[58:04] changes in muscle hormones that prepares
[58:08] the body either to face the source of
[58:10] fear to make a hasty escape
[58:12] you know the body is designed to exhibit
[58:16] the fight-or-flight response
[58:17] only when legitimate sources of fear are
[58:20] present whether it's a robber and a dark
[58:24] alleyway waving a knife in your face or
[58:27] a monstrous
[58:28] truck barreling down on you as you cross
[58:30] the street there are physical changes
[58:36] that happen the moment a source of fear
[58:40] appears the lungs expand so more oxygen
[58:45] is made available to the bloodstream the
[58:47] pupils dilate you know your eyes just
[58:50] get pink right
[58:51] the pupils dilate so that you can see
[58:54] more and circulation to other systems of
[58:57] the body are temporarily shunted so the
[58:59] majority of the blood flow is directed
[59:01] to the brain so you can think better
[59:04] right listen
[59:05] says your blood pressure also Rises and
[59:08] the liver starts releasing more sugar in
[59:11] order to prepare the body for action the
[59:14] body also produces cortisol the hormone
[59:18] that is released in response to stress
[59:20] and plays a role in the production of
[59:22] blood sugar however our bodies are not
[59:25] designed to stay in this constant state
[59:29] of fear for weeks and years if it stays
[59:34] on edge for days own in the body can and
[59:39] will eventually shut down fear will take
[59:46] a person out of here oh my god that's
[59:49] why Jesus say the word fear not don't
[59:52] let the devil anoint you with fear you
[59:56] gotta fight that with everything you got
[59:58] glory to God listener says it says if it
[1:00:00] stays on that row for days on end the
[1:00:03] body can and will eventually shut down
[1:00:05] this is because increased blood pressure
[1:00:07] rapid heart rates and high levels of
[1:00:10] cortisol can destroy the organs when
[1:00:12] they persist for long periods in I
[1:00:17] remember you know when we went to the
[1:00:21] doctor there and what a doctor gave us
[1:00:23] such a bad report when Sara was being
[1:00:27] born my wife was carrying her and the
[1:00:31] doctor just gave us such a bad report
[1:00:32] and you know that hey you you got it's a
[1:00:36] probability it's gonna be this its
[1:00:38] probability gonna be that and you know
[1:00:40] you over this threshold and you know
[1:00:42] all kind of stuff that they you know
[1:00:43] they just start pointing out to us but
[1:00:45] we walked in that doctor's office with
[1:00:47] just such a calmness and we come to the
[1:00:49] conclusion that you know what whatever
[1:00:50] it is we're gonna accept it right
[1:00:52] whatever whatever God got for us we're
[1:00:55] gonna accept it because you know that's
[1:00:56] that's God's plan
[1:00:57] that's not our plan and when we sat down
[1:01:00] and we talked to that doctor and he was
[1:01:01] just you know just giving us all the
[1:01:03] negative things like doc it doesn't
[1:01:04] matter we don't we're not gonna do the
[1:01:06] test that y'all wants to do we're gonna
[1:01:08] just stand on God's Word and we're just
[1:01:10] gonna believe God whatever he gives us
[1:01:11] we're gonna accept whatever whatever it
[1:01:13] is that's just intuitive but we walked
[1:01:15] out it was such a feast we refuse to
[1:01:17] leave there with fear we refuse to walk
[1:01:20] out that doctor's office with fear and
[1:01:21] just you know what they said this they
[1:01:23] said yeah they said that but the Word of
[1:01:25] God say something different
[1:01:26] amen and and I tell you what if we were
[1:01:28] to lived in that fear we probably it
[1:01:31] probably caused my wife to carry her
[1:01:33] differently and the fear that was that
[1:01:35] would have been upon my wife would have
[1:01:37] affected the child right but but having
[1:01:40] that peace that passeth all
[1:01:42] understanding that actually changes the
[1:01:45] whole situation Oh glory to God when
[1:01:48] Jesus say don't fear that that's exactly
[1:01:50] what it means
[1:01:51] don't don't fear whatever you do
[1:01:53] whatever you do don't fear another thing
[1:01:56] here that I just want to make mention of
[1:02:00] expectation its message expectation the
[1:02:05] Prophet says this just like I was
[1:02:08] telling the lady this morning when you
[1:02:11] go to fry your meat for breakfast and a
[1:02:14] big bunch of grease pops up on your hand
[1:02:17] the first thing it just scares you to
[1:02:20] death you grab your hand where is the
[1:02:24] unguent team right just as quick as you
[1:02:28] can that's the reason it burns you
[1:02:32] that's what that's that's what makes it
[1:02:34] the scare is what I can prove that it's
[1:02:38] the scare that burns you we don't know
[1:02:45] who we are yet you know I mean I'm glad
[1:02:49] that God sent a prophet to share these
[1:02:50] days because I don't know you know sue
[1:02:51] something like that happened you just
[1:02:52] you know you you wrap it and you know do
[1:02:55] this and do
[1:02:55] but you know we got the same power and
[1:02:58] authority in us that Paul had in him
[1:03:01] when that snake bit him on the hand he
[1:03:03] shook it off and kept going we got that
[1:03:07] even right I mean that that's it's fear
[1:03:11] that actually brings the burn it's fear
[1:03:15] that you know if we can just probably go
[1:03:17] back and look at all the scars that we
[1:03:19] got on our body
[1:03:19] fear brought them scars right fear did
[1:03:23] these things glory to God hallelujah
[1:03:26] when when when we can weaken when we can
[1:03:29] conquer fear and there's been many times
[1:03:32] you know I just listen there to brother
[1:03:34] Quentin testimony that was fear being
[1:03:36] conquer right there in the middle here
[1:03:39] this this just this truck is right on
[1:03:41] you and you're just looking at them
[1:03:42] they're looking at you everybody blowing
[1:03:43] homes but God give you peace and somehow
[1:03:46] I'm gonna bring you out of this don't
[1:03:47] worry I'm with you I'm with you
[1:03:49] you know I'll retie finished reading
[1:03:55] that a little bit
[1:03:56] you know I was thinking to myself just
[1:03:58] when I had the accident some years ago
[1:04:01] me and brother smiling when the car and
[1:04:03] and I remember and we were on our way to
[1:04:06] church on the went on that Friday night
[1:04:08] and and as the car was coming we're
[1:04:10] going and we got t-boned you know as
[1:04:12] we're going this way that car was coming
[1:04:13] this way and and hit right on the
[1:04:16] passenger side right in the door and and
[1:04:19] as a car was approaching I could see
[1:04:21] what was getting ready to happen brother
[1:04:24] smiley could see it was like Jack I'm
[1:04:26] like well just it's gonna be all right
[1:04:28] we're gonna be all right just to kind of
[1:04:30] brace yourself right and we were just
[1:04:32] kind of talking and and you know just I
[1:04:35] mean not not screaming and you know
[1:04:37] yelling like oh it's something that come
[1:04:41] over you right and I'm a reader quote
[1:04:44] here in a second but it's it when when
[1:04:47] when God has given you the ability to
[1:04:50] overcome fear it's something that just
[1:04:52] kind of comes over here there's a piece
[1:04:54] that you get that you can't explain
[1:04:56] right but uh you know and I was I was I
[1:05:00] was Justin are brothers come you know
[1:05:01] we're gonna it's gonna be alright you
[1:05:03] know just I see it we can't really stop
[1:05:05] it is getting ready to hit let's just
[1:05:06] brace yourself and you know as we
[1:05:08] sitting there
[1:05:09] in the car I mean hit just turns us over
[1:05:12] on on top and we slide down the street
[1:05:14] you know on the owner on a hood and and
[1:05:17] it finally come to a stop
[1:05:18] you know we hit a curb and the car come
[1:05:20] to a stop and I'm sitting over looking
[1:05:22] at him and and I'm trying to find it
[1:05:24] like you all right brother you all right
[1:05:26] and I'm turning the car because I'm
[1:05:27] still thinking in my head man this car
[1:05:29] gonna blow so let me turn this car off
[1:05:31] how you know you processing like that
[1:05:34] you know and you just got hit by a car
[1:05:36] right under you but this car you ready
[1:05:38] blow up let me turn this thing off and
[1:05:39] this is all the things that's going
[1:05:41] through my mind right so you know when
[1:05:43] we brother smiling you know I'm turning
[1:05:46] the action see you all right now don't
[1:05:48] see brothers finally I see his feet and
[1:05:51] he's a big guy you know I see his feet
[1:05:54] going out through that that that's that
[1:05:55] side window and I say okay if I took
[1:05:58] that seat belt off and I went riding out
[1:06:01] the side go right along with him I
[1:06:03] jumped out and said man you all right
[1:06:05] yeah I'm all right and folk come running
[1:06:07] up to us and you know they're just
[1:06:09] looking like and even the guy that with
[1:06:11] that drove the car he was so drunk and
[1:06:13] you know he looking like he can't
[1:06:15] believe people walked out of the thing
[1:06:16] alive is anybody else in the car no it's
[1:06:18] just us two y'all sure y'all all right
[1:06:21] yeah we fine walking around nothing
[1:06:23] nothing you know nothing seemed wrong
[1:06:25] just to look bleed them on one pinky and
[1:06:29] he bleeding on his other pinkies or that
[1:06:30] that's really that was it and and when I
[1:06:33] when I go back and I think about that is
[1:06:35] because you know hat we've probably had
[1:06:37] a spirit of fear it would have been
[1:06:40] something totally different but but but
[1:06:42] God got a way of just kind of stepping
[1:06:44] in there and taking fear away from you
[1:06:46] right because he realizes Amen how you
[1:06:51] know how dangerous
[1:06:52] fear is Oh glory to God let's keep on
[1:06:57] reading in this quote the Prophet says I
[1:07:00] can prove to use to scare that burns you
[1:07:03] you got the Holy Ghost
[1:07:05] its operating in your body well when
[1:07:07] that old snake grabbed a hold of Paul
[1:07:09] hands there was there was not a bit of
[1:07:12] scare not not one ounce not one ounce of
[1:07:16] fear in Paul he looked at it like that
[1:07:19] shook it off in the fire and went on and
[1:07:22] got some more
[1:07:23] it didn't scare him see if you're if
[1:07:25] you're not scared
[1:07:27] Jesus said why did you fear Peter come
[1:07:30] walking on the water doing fine until
[1:07:32] he's seen the waves were contrary and I
[1:07:37] don't know what might be contrary in
[1:07:39] your life but don't look at whatever's
[1:07:41] contrary look at what the Word of God
[1:07:43] says right you you just no matter no
[1:07:47] matter what the waves are you stay with
[1:07:49] the word God gonna bring you through
[1:07:52] somehow
[1:07:52] if you gotta come walking through your
[1:07:54] situation he'll come walking through it
[1:07:56] but he gonna bring you out somehow just
[1:07:58] whatever you do just don't fear listen
[1:08:02] listen he says this Peter come walking
[1:08:04] he says Jesus said why don't you fear
[1:08:06] Peter come walking on the water doing
[1:08:08] fine until he's seen the ways were
[1:08:12] contrary then he got scared and began to
[1:08:14] sing Jesus come pick them up said why
[1:08:18] did you fear oh ye of little faith
[1:08:20] fear you're scared it won't happen don't
[1:08:24] have one bit of fear move forward God
[1:08:26] said so and that settles it I'm
[1:08:31] convinced that fear is something that's
[1:08:33] crippling us and stopping us from
[1:08:35] experiencing everything that God has for
[1:08:38] us we have to we have to be able to step
[1:08:40] up into this next level that God's
[1:08:43] called us to no fear no fear God made a
[1:08:45] promise to him God's gonna keep his
[1:08:46] promise it's not up for us to try to
[1:08:49] figure out how it's going to happen and
[1:08:51] you know the devil guy that's just
[1:08:53] worried straight right you know okay
[1:08:56] it's come - I made a statement one time
[1:08:59] you know now we're preaching up there in
[1:09:03] South Carolina I told people I say you
[1:09:06] know God changes his strategies as to
[1:09:10] how he how he meets your needs sometimes
[1:09:13] you might put a check in the mail but
[1:09:15] you don't go looking through it looking
[1:09:17] for the check in the mail every day or
[1:09:19] every time you got a need I'm like I'm
[1:09:22] expecting God to put another check in
[1:09:24] event God will change his strategy on
[1:09:26] you don't limit God to your mailbox
[1:09:29] right you could go to the grocery store
[1:09:32] somebody might put something in your
[1:09:33] hand that didn't come in the mail right
[1:09:36] but
[1:09:37] sometimes we you know God make away one
[1:09:39] way and we just limit God that this only
[1:09:41] way Kaka don't don't ever do that
[1:09:44] don't ever do that go to God God might
[1:09:47] drop something in your PayPal account
[1:09:51] you don't know how God gonna meet your
[1:09:54] knees glory to God hallelujah right but
[1:09:58] you know oftentimes we limit ourselves
[1:10:00] you know when God does something like
[1:10:03] that and we what we want to do like no
[1:10:04] no no whatever the need is whatever the
[1:10:07] thing that's going contrary to where I
[1:10:08] am right now I'm not going to doubt I'm
[1:10:10] just gonna I'm gonna take God it is
[1:10:12] where he said he'll rebuke the Devourer
[1:10:14] for my sake how he do it that's up to
[1:10:17] him glory to God for the random you know
[1:10:22] makes this statement here and you know I
[1:10:25] Oh Lord I got there's there's a lot here
[1:10:28] a lot here let me let's just you know if
[1:10:35] we we look at that that scripture that
[1:10:38] we were reading there when they were
[1:10:42] when Jesus had told them to get into the
[1:10:45] ship and go to the other side he had
[1:10:47] just finished feeding the 5,000 and
[1:10:50] sending the 5,000 away
[1:10:52] they had already saw a miracle that day
[1:10:55] they saw a miracle and unfortunately
[1:10:58] church we've we've seen miracles some of
[1:11:01] us have been miracles but yet fear will
[1:11:05] creep up on us and we find ourselves
[1:11:07] doubting whether God can do it again I'm
[1:11:11] here tonight and say the devil is a liar
[1:11:13] and not only can my god do it again he
[1:11:16] will he will do it again he gone you're
[1:11:19] gonna keep doing it over and over and
[1:11:21] over I mean I you know y'all might think
[1:11:23] I'm crazy but man I some time I just I
[1:11:25] have to I have to talk back to the devil
[1:11:28] they put some things in my hands you
[1:11:31] know and and I and I got this from you
[1:11:34] know what's the name of that gentleman I
[1:11:37] preached about open open wide that mouth
[1:11:39] that I may fill it George Mueller thank
[1:11:44] you he you know George Mueller made a
[1:11:47] statement he Street odo saying if God
[1:11:49] tell me this time it's gonna be the
[1:11:52] first time if he failed me this time
[1:11:55] it's gonna be the first time he found me
[1:11:57] right and when I when I heard that I
[1:11:59] said that's what I'm used to telling us
[1:12:01] that Satan if he failed me this month
[1:12:02] it's gonna be the first month now i'ma
[1:12:04] tell you the way my god is undefeated
[1:12:07] God's right here he ain't gonna have not
[1:12:10] one loss on his record not one not to
[1:12:13] you not to the devil right so so I
[1:12:17] always I just remind him see if he felt
[1:12:19] me this time it's gonna be the first
[1:12:21] time he ever fell me and I don't think
[1:12:23] he won't he'll want to have that kind of
[1:12:25] testimony so we don't sit back and watch
[1:12:27] him make away right so I mean I just I
[1:12:30] just stopped talking to the devil and
[1:12:32] you know and then when I see God make
[1:12:33] away I you know someone's like I call
[1:12:35] him up hey you remember what you said
[1:12:38] that God wanna do I told you is gonna be
[1:12:41] the first time he didn't do it this time
[1:12:43] either he did not fail right see fear
[1:12:48] fear fear will cause us to bring all the
[1:12:51] evil results but faith faith will bring
[1:12:56] us promises to pass fear not fear not
[1:13:05] whatever you do don't don't don't fear
[1:13:08] don't fear I got a lot of quotes here to
[1:13:14] read and I'm not gonna read them all
[1:13:15] tonight I just get you enough to get you
[1:13:18] going but but really what my thought is
[1:13:20] here I'm gonna be taking different
[1:13:23] portions of Scripture and and just
[1:13:26] bringing out the stories just to drive
[1:13:28] the spirit of fear out because
[1:13:30] everybody's had to deal with it all
[1:13:33] right we can go right through the
[1:13:34] scripture and show you different ones
[1:13:36] that was fearing you are we've talked
[1:13:39] recently about the the woman in 1st
[1:13:43] Kings 17 where the God told the Prophet
[1:13:45] said go down to this widows woman go
[1:13:47] down her house I have I have ordained
[1:13:50] her to sustain thee through this family
[1:13:52] that lady didn't have no food that lady
[1:13:55] was down to her last and here the
[1:13:58] Prophet go into a house and you know and
[1:14:00] when it when he acts for water you know
[1:14:02] brother Branham said she had
[1:14:03] no problem give him the water she like
[1:14:05] man you know I'm thirsty he thirst my
[1:14:07] son thirst we got enough water we can
[1:14:09] share that so she wouldn't get the water
[1:14:10] for the profit but soon as I said and if
[1:14:13] you don't mind just baked me a cake
[1:14:15] first that's what she she she start
[1:14:17] piping up and she said now you know what
[1:14:19] all I got is this last look cake this
[1:14:22] last little meal and I'm gonna I'm gonna
[1:14:25] feed myself I'm my son to myself and
[1:14:27] we're gonna die the expectation was
[1:14:31] death after this last meal we are weird
[1:14:34] we're gonna die that's it and and what
[1:14:37] what changed the whole situation the
[1:14:40] profit actually told her double fear
[1:14:43] fear not that's what he told in verse 13
[1:14:47] the first King 17 say don't you know
[1:14:49] whatever you do just just don't fear go
[1:14:51] ahead and do exactly what you say you're
[1:14:52] gonna do but as you baking that cake for
[1:14:54] your son
[1:14:55] make sure you bake me one first oh my
[1:14:59] god
[1:15:00] can I tell y'all you know put God first
[1:15:05] no matter what you're going through
[1:15:08] Satan coming against your finances put
[1:15:12] God first just do what God actually
[1:15:16] that's all he asks you to do that just
[1:15:19] put him first I can assure you that if
[1:15:24] you put God first your crews will not go
[1:15:28] empty and your barrel will not run dry
[1:15:31] if you put God first hallelujah but she
[1:15:37] was told fear not and when she was told
[1:15:39] fear not
[1:15:40] she heard thus sayeth the Lord and just
[1:15:43] those dos DOS thus sayeth the Lord those
[1:15:47] four words change the whole outlook cuz
[1:15:50] she knew that she had something solid
[1:15:51] guess what we might not have anybody
[1:15:53] walk up to us and say thus saith the
[1:15:55] lord but if we can read it in his word
[1:15:57] we got thus saith the lord when she
[1:16:02] heard fear not because fear was giving
[1:16:05] ready to bring her to death fear was
[1:16:08] about to her and bring her to
[1:16:10] death but when he when he come walking
[1:16:12] in with the promise
[1:16:13] from Almighty God in church I'd say well
[1:16:16] God will always come walking in with a
[1:16:18] promise give you something in the word
[1:16:20] he gives you something take that run
[1:16:22] with it dry the devil back don't fear
[1:16:29] this last code I read for you tonight
[1:16:31] out of God's covenant with Abraham and
[1:16:34] his seed brother Branham makes a
[1:16:37] statement here says you son get no doubt
[1:16:41] at all great old song of the church
[1:16:45] certainly all fear is done go Jesus
[1:16:49] constantly fear not fear not he says I
[1:16:54] am he that was dead and alive
[1:16:56] forevermore
[1:16:58] fear not says I am with the always to
[1:17:02] the end of the world fear not
[1:17:05] it says and and the Christian keeps
[1:17:09] sitting back oh I just wonder and that's
[1:17:13] that's the thing that we always wonder
[1:17:15] whether God gonna do this whether God
[1:17:16] gonna do that no if he said he gonna do
[1:17:18] it then he gonna do it it says it says
[1:17:21] oh I just wonder oh my turn loose a man
