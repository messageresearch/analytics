[22:21] couple announcements that i probably

[22:24] amen and um
[22:27] i did want to especially welcome
[22:30] um the saints in a husky uh
[22:33] north carolina my brother larry called
[22:36] me
[22:36] a little earlier to today and said
[22:39] brother we
[22:40] are going to the church and we're going
[22:42] to ask some young people to come
[22:44] and we're going to stream the service
[22:45] from a husky
[22:47] and uh we want to welcome them amen
[22:49] tonight amen
[22:51] and fellowship here with us
[22:56] praise the lord and um i know that there
[22:59] are other saints that are streaming
[23:00] amen from the various places and and i
[23:04] mentioned
[23:04] typically we do this youth service is
[23:07] something that
[23:08] um we combine with a number of churches
[23:12] here in the area
[23:13] and man i tell you this covet has
[23:16] changed so much um uh our
[23:19] you know our desire is just to try to
[23:21] keep the young people encouraged and
[23:24] and uh you know but we were not able to
[23:26] just bring everybody together we just
[23:27] didn't want to
[23:29] um fall out of line with the social
[23:32] distancing
[23:33] so we trust that some of the young
[23:35] people have been able to join us either
[23:37] on facebook or on periscope
[23:39] and um uh we we certainly pray that the
[23:42] lord will bless you amen right where you
[23:44] are
[23:45] amen certainly trusting god just to meet
[23:47] us all in a very special way
[23:50] on tonight amen i have any uh quick
[23:53] announcements i need to make okay
[23:55] so um just uh
[23:59] want to make mention a man um uh
[24:03] for uh tomorrow i i i first of all i
[24:07] want to say thank you for
[24:08] our guests that are here remember the
[24:10] nathan and many of the precious brothers
[24:12] that have come from churchill
[24:14] uh of the open door there in new albany
[24:16] uh indiana

[24:20] and then he'll be speaking for us
[24:22] in the morning amen thank god for
[24:25] brother luke
[24:27] and then brother jonathan brother
[24:28] fuhrman and also the
[24:30] speaker of tonight brother aaron amen
[24:32] will be here speaking for us
[24:34] on tonight and um you know just just
[24:36] good to have them and fellowship
[24:38] and so we had this service that we
[24:40] wanted to put together then
[24:42] we've been streaming uh i mean during
[24:44] our nine o'clock and 12 o'clock service
[24:46] since the covet thing and it just worked
[24:48] out really really nice for us to
[24:50] to get all the ministers the way that we
[24:52] kind of talked about it
[24:53] but tomorrow at 12 that service will be
[24:57] dedicated to praying for
[24:59] the sick amen it'll be praying for the
[25:02] sick
[25:03] many times the lord has allowed brother
[25:05] nathan to pass through this way and
[25:07] there's been many
[25:08] supernatural things that have taken
[25:11] place
[25:11] uh here in our church we are witnesses
[25:15] of god uh doing the supernatural here so
[25:19] we uh when we were planning things i
[25:21] just didn't know how we'd be able to do
[25:23] it but
[25:23] we have a few saints a man that'll be
[25:25] here present those that will want to go
[25:27] through the prayer line and here in the
[25:28] service
[25:29] we're going to have a prayer line for
[25:30] you but we'll also be doing a hybrid
[25:33] um where we have a virtual prayer line
[25:36] we have received a number of requests
[25:38] and
[25:39] those that have not submitted requests
[25:40] if you desire to do so
[25:42] reach out to us we'll give you the link
[25:44] of how you can submit your request but
[25:46] we believe in god that he'll touch you
[25:49] right where you are we're standing on
[25:50] the scripture
[25:52] where the centurion told the lord jesus
[25:54] say i'm not worthy that you should come
[25:56] underneath my roof and then he told
[25:59] jesus say
[26:00] if he says i'm a man of authority and
[26:02] and uh and and you know i realized that
[26:05] i speak and i i tell this one to come he
[26:07] comes i tell that but ago he goes and
[26:09] whatever i actually do they do because
[26:11] i'm a man of authority says and i
[26:13] realize you have that same type of power
[26:15] it says if you just speak the word only
[26:17] i know my servant will be made whole
[26:19] so jesus never went to the man's house
[26:21] jesus never laid hands on his servant
[26:24] but he did speak the word and the man
[26:25] was made whole i believe that same power
[26:28] exists today so as the word of god is
[26:30] being preached your faith is being
[26:32] elevated
[26:33] amen the word of the prayer of faith
[26:35] will be prayed for you and we're
[26:36] believing god for your healing wherever
[26:38] you
[26:38] are whatever your need we're believing
[26:41] god
[26:42] that he will touch you so we're looking
[26:44] forward to that on tomorrow
[26:45] amen so keep that uh keep that in mind
[26:48] keep those services in prayer
[26:49] amen praise the lord
[26:55] all right uh so praise the lord uh as
[26:57] far as giving
[26:59] we do have the ability for people to
[27:01] give

[27:09] give through those those means those

[34:30] we ask that you be with us now and help
[34:32] us to pull as best as we can
[34:35] here or far lord wherever we are we need
[34:37] you
[34:38] in jesus name i ask and pray amen
[34:45] all right it's great to be here
[34:49] it's been a long trip coming down here
[34:51] and i've just
[34:52] really been excited the entire to cut
[34:54] the entire time to come and minister
[34:57] uh such a wonderful blessing i'm not
[34:59] sure how many people are out there in
[35:00] radio land or
[35:01] wherever but i'm just happy to be here
[35:04] um
[35:06] you know that song that you were just
[35:07] singing brother jack
[35:09] i just loved that song i i heard it for
[35:11] the first time when we were brother
[35:12] danny's this week
[35:13] it was just a blessing i took a picture
[35:15] of the lyrics and i didn't know how to
[35:17] sing it but
[35:18] i'll be able to go back and hear it this
[35:19] time i just love it it's amazing
[35:22] we ask that god gets all the glory and
[35:23] all the honor amen
[35:25] all right if you turn with me to genesis
[35:27] 3 6.
[35:32] that's genesis 3 verse 6.
[35:40] it reads and when the woman saw that the
[35:42] tree was good for food
[35:44] and that it was pleasant to the eyes in
[35:46] a tree to be desired to make one wise
[35:49] she took of the fruit thereof and did
[35:52] eat
[35:53] and gave also unto her husband with her
[35:56] and he did eat he exceeded
[36:07] thank you
[36:10] actually
[36:20] you know i'm hoping that everybody here
[36:21] is coming expecting
[36:23] not because it's me but i find that when
[36:25] we have a lot of meetings in a row like
[36:27] this that
[36:28] uh that god tends to bless more and more
[36:32] as each meeting goes on
[36:33] so if you set the bar high with your
[36:35] expectation and you get a lot out of the
[36:37] first service
[36:38] not because it's me or anything if you
[36:40] set the bar high it'll just keep
[36:41] building
[36:42] time and time again by the end of this i
[36:44] bet it's going to be a blessing for
[36:45] everybody
[36:46] amen so in genesis you can see
[36:49] everybody's familiar with this story
[36:51] uh eve goes and picks of the bad fruit
[36:54] you know and i want you to notice in
[36:57] this scripture it says
[36:59] when the woman saw that the tree was
[37:01] good for food and that it was pleasant
[37:03] to the eyes
[37:04] now you you want to notice here that it
[37:06] catches her senses first you know
[37:08] because the devil knows he can't attack
[37:10] you and go straight for your soul
[37:11] your soul is where you make that
[37:12] decision faith or doubt correct
[37:14] now but she but the devil actually has
[37:17] to use the outward appearance of a
[37:18] person
[37:19] anything that god uses in our mortal
[37:21] bodies to
[37:22] contact this realm he the devil's going
[37:25] to use
[37:26] those senses of ours to get to the
[37:27] inside you know and you can anticipate
[37:30] that he's going to always attack that
[37:31] way
[37:32] now she takes these
[37:35] uh yeah what did you say and a tree to
[37:37] be desired to make one wise so there was
[37:39] some desire in her heart
[37:41] to become wiser you know and uh there's
[37:44] always a motive the devil will always
[37:47] always try to use
[37:48] something to convince you whenever he's
[37:51] giving you something wrong it'll sound
[37:53] mostly right
[37:54] but then it'll actually have one tiny
[37:56] little bit of something that's just
[37:57] wrong
[37:58] amen yeah it will attract you it won't
[38:02] be ugly it won't taste bad it won't look
[38:04] bad
[38:05] it won't smell bad there's nothing wrong
[38:06] with it to the
[38:08] mortal body right but if you have to
[38:11] actually
[38:11] look beyond that because the devil's got
[38:13] it's got some little bit of poison in
[38:15] there
[38:16] all right now i want i want to mention
[38:18] something also
[38:19] there's a difference because after she
[38:22] after she
[38:22] takes of this fruit she decides to share
[38:25] it right most people who partake of
[38:27] something whether it's good or bad
[38:28] they're going to go out there and
[38:29] they're going to share it one way or
[38:30] another
[38:31] with the people that they love you know
[38:33] of the people that they think will
[38:34] accept or
[38:35] who actually need what they have to give
[38:37] them right but there's also another
[38:40] thing you want to notice there's two
[38:41] things
[38:42] there's two different ways that they
[38:43] could share something if it's a good
[38:45] thing
[38:45] such as these meetings the number of
[38:47] people here
[38:49] doesn't match the number of people
[38:50] actually watching because somebody here
[38:51] had to have shared it
[38:52] they knew there was a good thing
[38:54] happening this weekend and they went out
[38:55] there and they shared it online i don't
[38:57] know if it was social media or something
[38:58] word of mouth
[38:59] but there is something here that's good
[39:01] and you went out and shared it
[39:03] you made it public made it known to
[39:05] everybody else and that's a good thing
[39:07] you know but there's also there's also
[39:09] that version of sharing things which is
[39:11] just not
[39:12] so good right whenever it's something
[39:15] that you know is wrong you're going to
[39:17] seek out
[39:18] find a way to share it in private you're
[39:20] going to pull the person to the side
[39:22] you notice eve he she loved um both god
[39:25] and adam her relationship with
[39:26] was with god and adam it was a triangle
[39:28] right but
[39:30] in this case she knew god had given the
[39:33] given the word he had given the
[39:34] commandment and he had the judgment
[39:36] you know and she loved both of them but
[39:39] she was only going to share this with
[39:40] adam she didn't wait till god was coming
[39:42] down in the cool of the evening to
[39:44] actually show it to everybody that means
[39:46] she knew there was something wrong with
[39:47] this fruit
[39:48] whether she took something or not i'm
[39:50] not here to preach on that fruit but
[39:53] but she knew it so she pulled and pulled
[39:55] adam to the side maybe behind the bushes
[39:57] and said here
[39:59] you know okay so there's a difference
[40:03] and it's all in the spirit in which it's
[40:05] given you know and you can usually
[40:06] recognize that
[40:08] brother brandon prince preached a
[40:09] message called convinced and concerned
[40:11] and he talks about the christian
[40:13] whenever they first get
[40:15] and is this going in and out it's good
[40:17] okay
[40:19] all right okay when a christian first
[40:21] gets born again they found something
[40:23] good
[40:24] and they know that they want there's
[40:25] some desire in their heart to
[40:27] want to share it with other people now
[40:29] that sharing it doesn't mean they're
[40:30] going to go out there and preach it to
[40:31] everybody they're not going to get
[40:33] on the street corners and start blasting
[40:35] their message or something like that
[40:36] but god will find some way to use that
[40:38] christian in one way or another to share
[40:40] it
[40:40] to share his gospel to to further the
[40:43] kingdom of god
[40:44] and that's that's what i see in
[40:46] convinced and concerned that's the way
[40:47] of sharing things
[40:49] now 1957
[40:53] 1950
[40:59] in 1957 brother branham preaches a
[41:01] message called
[41:02] why is it so why is it that so many
[41:04] christians find it so hard to live the
[41:06] christian life
[41:07] and he says if we are used to eating
[41:11] small portions
[41:12] our stomach shrinks to that portion and
[41:14] if we eat much
[41:16] our stomach stretches to that and i
[41:18] think that we need some spiritual
[41:19] stretching
[41:20] and get much of the word can't be
[41:22] satisfied with just reading a little
[41:23] verse once in a while
[41:25] or something of that manner but
[41:26] stretching our spiritual gastronomics
[41:28] right you know in in that
[41:31] in that i can see christians they
[41:34] they're
[41:35] god puts that thirst in you but the
[41:36] difference with a christian is they know
[41:37] what fills it
[41:38] they know where to go the god will find
[41:41] a way to get them that that
[41:42] that to find a will find a way for
[41:46] them to fill that desire in their heart
[41:48] he's going to fill it he has it for you
[41:50] you know and that's that's an example of
[41:52] coming over here to these meetings here
[41:54] near afar finding a way you will find a
[41:56] way
[41:57] to listen to what god has for you you
[41:59] know
[42:00] and it takes a special kind of person to
[42:02] come back and i
[42:03] i it just amazes me how many times that
[42:07] people just come back for the word time
[42:08] and time again
[42:09] and it's like they could never get full
[42:11] there's just no way you could fill up on
[42:13] it
[42:13] you could get tired in your body but
[42:15] your soul and your spirit always desires
[42:17] that
[42:17] if you have the proper spirit inside of
[42:19] you yes
[42:21] so this word i want to latch onto that
[42:23] phrase spiritual gastronomics and that's
[42:25] actually my title
[42:28] um
[42:30] that's actually my title but uh
[42:33] i wanted to i actually looked online
[42:37] for a definition of gastronomics
[42:41] and i've never actually heard that word
[42:44] outside of the message and i couldn't
[42:45] find a note
[42:46] a place online to actually say hey
[42:50] um gastronomics was used anywhere so i
[42:52] would i would attribute it to the way
[42:54] brother branham spoke
[42:55] however i found a definition for the
[42:58] word gastronomy
[43:00] and that is from dictionary.com it says
[43:02] the art or
[43:03] science of good eating it also that's
[43:06] the first definition
[43:07] also it says a style of cooking or
[43:09] eating
[43:10] and you know he uses this phrase 17 or
[43:13] 18 times in the message depending on how
[43:15] you search
[43:16] but uh you know you probably overlook it
[43:19] he usually uses it in the context of
[43:21] if it don't make you sick it won't do
[43:23] you no good you know
[43:24] and something going down your stomach
[43:26] but i tend to believe that
[43:27] people feed spiritually and naturally
[43:30] the exact same way
[43:31] or they can they tend to also depending
[43:34] on their culture
[43:35] you know and uh i i i started looking at
[43:39] it that way and it actually made a lot
[43:40] of sense
[43:41] however i know that i'm african for some
[43:44] background
[43:45] and i'm not trying to make anybody
[43:46] uncomfortable
[43:48] in here if you are not from a foreign
[43:50] country
[43:51] and you came and you're american and
[43:53] everything that's fine
[43:54] i'm not touching and talking about the
[43:56] natural here i'm talking about the
[43:57] spiritual
[43:58] i'm going to use a lot of natural
[43:59] parallels but there's nothing to do with
[44:02] the
[44:02] like just try to be spiritual about it
[44:04] this is a this is a lesson where you can
[44:06] be as spiritually as you want to be
[44:08] and you won't go too far you're fine
[44:10] okay i'm not going to preach on
[44:12] the f word the fact okay i'm not going
[44:15] to preach on that
[44:16] um okay so
[44:21] all right i hope she has the pictures
[44:23] ready okay so
[44:24] inspiration 1956 he says
[44:28] as science can only go far then it goes
[44:30] so far then it falls back
[44:32] we got unpacked resources by a divine
[44:34] promise from none other than the son of
[44:36] god saying
[44:36] whatsoever you ask the father in my name
[44:39] i'll do it
[44:40] he said i feel religious right now to
[44:42] think of that all things are possible to
[44:44] them that believe
[44:45] he says god i've got enough faith for
[44:48] for the sick now
[44:49] god give me enough faith for something
[44:50] else i'm hungry my gastronomics is
[44:52] swelling out i want more of god
[44:54] now in this it just sounds greedy right
[44:57] if you substitute
[44:58] any word in there for the word god it
[45:01] sounds like he's being greedy if i said
[45:04] um money i've got enough money for the
[45:07] sick now
[45:07] got money give me enough faith for
[45:09] something else i'm hungry my
[45:10] gastronomics is
[45:11] i want more money that just sounds wrong
[45:13] right but
[45:15] i can tend to say that it's not greedy
[45:17] to want more of god
[45:18] you just want more you just seek more
[45:20] time and time again and that's totally
[45:22] he put that thirst in you in the first
[45:24] place he's there to fulfill it
[45:26] it's like you know if i'm gonna be on is
[45:29] god was like apple pie and you're at the
[45:30] dinner table
[45:32] with your family and everything what
[45:33] would you do if somebody if there were
[45:35] 16 slices of apple pie and there were 16
[45:38] people there at the dinner table
[45:39] what would you do if somebody said they
[45:41] didn't want their slice
[45:42] you say you take it hallelujah right now
[45:45] god if god was that apple pie you said
[45:47] you take it look i invite people to
[45:49] these meetings all the time
[45:50] and guess what they don't show up or
[45:52] they just sit there they don't say
[45:54] man they don't do a single thing i'll
[45:56] take what they're not taking because i'm
[45:57] gonna pull for myself
[45:59] that's for me i don't care what they do
[46:01] all right god give it to me
[46:03] i'm gonna be greedy about it all of his
[46:05] gifts amen
[46:07] all right um isaiah 28
[46:10] verse nine it says whom shall he teach
[46:13] knowledge
[46:14] and whom shall we make to understand
[46:15] doctrine them that are weaned from the
[46:17] milk and drawn from the breasts for
[46:19] precept must be upon precept precept
[46:22] upon precept
[46:24] line upon line here a little and there a
[46:26] little
[46:27] now if you look at this verse 10
[46:30] precept must be upon precept i i
[46:34] i tend to look at that as having a
[46:36] balance in the scriptures you know
[46:38] it can't be leaning one way or another
[46:40] it has to be as
[46:41] accurate as the way god wanted to reveal
[46:43] it to you correct
[46:45] now he says for with standard stammering
[46:47] lips and another tongue will he speak to
[46:48] his people
[46:49] to whom he said this is the rest
[46:51] wherewith he may cause the weary to rest
[46:53] and this is the refreshing yet they
[46:55] would not hear
[46:56] and that means if you want more rest you
[46:58] can only find that in the scriptures
[47:00] it can only be found there you have to
[47:02] open yourself up to the word
[47:04] and let him fill you with what you
[47:06] actually have to
[47:07] go and seek out the word you know you
[47:09] can't look for other things to fill that
[47:11] void that he put inside of you
[47:13] that's the only way all right now um
[47:18] if you if you want to think of it in
[47:20] terms of the diet
[47:22] uh d sister could you put up the second
[47:25] picture
[47:26] please the second picture
[47:36] second
[47:42] if you want to think of it in terms of a
[47:44] diet then
[47:46] this is a picture that we've all seen in
[47:48] school and
[47:49] uh it's in elementary school
[47:52] and they teach you that in order to have
[47:54] a proper diet you need to have
[47:56] all of these things in a day correct in
[47:58] all these servings and all these portion
[48:00] sizes that you see on the right
[48:02] now spiritually speaking you know
[48:05] there are so many things in the word
[48:06] that you need to have but if you are
[48:08] missing something here
[48:09] in the or you have it in the wrong
[48:11] proportion in the wrong place
[48:12] then there's something wrong something
[48:14] if you if you come over here and you try
[48:16] to cut this
[48:17] um cut this in the natural and you get
[48:19] all of this out of here what is that
[48:21] called
[48:22] it's uh if you cut this out and cut that
[48:24] up there it's called a keto diet right
[48:26] basically and if you go with only
[48:28] natural versions of these things and
[48:30] skip all the processed stuff at the top
[48:32] it's a paleo diet
[48:33] at least that's my understanding but you
[48:34] can cut things and get different kind of
[48:36] diets out of this
[48:37] but it wouldn't be that it would be
[48:39] different you can also
[48:41] come over here and change the serving
[48:42] sizes and if you take all the sweets
[48:45] down here and you make it big then it's
[48:46] going to be
[48:48] the fat diet you're just going to get
[48:49] fat right that's exactly what's going to
[48:51] happen if you take all the meat out of
[48:53] there
[48:53] i don't really know what happens if you
[48:55] do that if you don't eat protein
[48:56] i don't know if you get kwashiorkor you
[48:58] will get a disease there is something
[49:00] wrong
[49:00] if you upset the balance there right
[49:03] correct now spiritually speaking you
[49:06] want to get
[49:07] everything in that diet inside of you
[49:09] right
[49:10] if you could give me the third picture
[49:12] please sister you want to get everything
[49:14] row by throw going up from the bottom to
[49:16] the top
[49:18] now you can't jump over here and skip
[49:21] this can you hello brother
[49:23] can anybody do that if anyone's read
[49:25] that scripture right it says add to your
[49:27] faith virtue
[49:28] to your virtue knowledge you're adding
[49:30] one to the other going to the very top
[49:32] right and that's your end goal up here
[49:35] you want to get that perfect love but
[49:37] you can't do that unless you actually
[49:38] feed on the scripture unless you feed
[49:40] and it's it's not just about diet
[49:42] it's not just about eating it's about
[49:44] exercise too you have to actually
[49:46] exercise your faith in whatever he gives
[49:48] you
[49:48] if you don't exercise your faith then
[49:50] it's just intellectual
[49:51] there's nothing there's nothing coming
[49:53] of it and it's just gonna sit there
[49:54] inside of you
[49:55] guess what you'll be spiritually fat
[49:57] because you're not exercising you're not
[49:59] burning it you're not using it for
[50:00] anything
[50:01] there's constant buildup of carbs
[50:05] so you're trying to get each one of
[50:06] these things in in order to get to the
[50:08] top
[50:10] i hope you're trying because every
[50:12] christian has that true desire in his
[50:13] heart there's a purpose to it
[50:15] there's you know character is a victory
[50:17] if you read the church age book you have
[50:18] to actually work for it
[50:20] it won't be given to you even whenever
[50:22] you're feeding on the word it actually
[50:24] has to
[50:24] you have to open yourself up to it and
[50:26] act on it too you can't just sit on it
[50:31] and there are whenever i looked up could
[50:32] you show the second picture please
[50:34] sister tina
[50:35] whenever i looked it up you know i was
[50:37] expecting you know i googled
[50:40] i was looking for a picture of this food
[50:42] pyramid and i googled it and i was just
[50:43] like oh this is easy
[50:44] you know type food pyramid and google
[50:46] images easy right
[50:48] i came up with so many different kinds
[50:50] of pyramid just by googling it just like
[50:52] that
[50:52] and it's totally different from what i
[50:54] was looking for in elementary school
[50:56] totally different there was the keto
[50:58] pillow pyramid there was like
[51:00] the paleo pyramid there was a
[51:01] mediterranean food pyramid
[51:03] and i was like where did these come from
[51:04] you know i want the actual true pyramid
[51:07] i want to know that
[51:08] i want that actual true word that's
[51:10] actually balanced i don't want someone
[51:11] to come over here and mix it for me
[51:13] some of them didn't even look like
[51:14] pyramids they were cut down this way
[51:16] instead of the other way you can't cut
[51:17] it out of there
[51:18] you have to leave it exactly the way it
[51:20] is that's the way i want it and that's
[51:21] the way god gave it to us you know
[51:23] okay amen that's great all right
[51:27] uh you can take wait actually i thought
[51:29] of another thing
[51:31] if you think of it in the other pyramid
[51:35] you gotta you can you can you can take
[51:38] in anything in your life and it might
[51:39] look like a good thing or a bad thing
[51:41] it might actually be a good thing you
[51:43] can put things ahead of god that you
[51:45] should not put ahead of god and you just
[51:47] start feeding on them it could be
[51:50] something as easy as sports or you know
[51:51] pg-13 movies who cares right there's
[51:54] just pg-13 movies
[51:56] um it could be something it could be
[51:57] your people you love it could be your
[51:59] wife your kids it could be
[52:00] false doctrines it could be real
[52:01] doctrines if you keep feeding on the
[52:03] wrong
[52:04] thing and not the wrong thing they they
[52:06] look good
[52:08] it appeals to your senses in one way or
[52:09] another it looks good
[52:11] but too much of a bad of a good thing
[52:13] like i said
[52:14] this is good there is nothing wrong with
[52:16] that but it's all about
[52:18] serving size and moderation you got to
[52:20] put god first
[52:21] i say you can you can put anything on
[52:23] here uh
[52:24] whatever your pyramid is whatever is
[52:26] important to you you can build a pyramid
[52:28] of your life of what's important to you
[52:29] but you as long as you have god down
[52:31] here as your little cornerstone
[52:33] and build it on there it's fine you know
[52:36] if you can do it in god's name
[52:38] whatever you do in god's name it's like
[52:39] look i wanna i wanna listen to sports
[52:42] but i know i have to have god first
[52:44] that's the first stone and then i'm
[52:45] gonna i'm gonna watch sports
[52:47] but that's fine god's first and then i
[52:49] get to the sports
[52:50] it's fine have a solid foundation i
[52:52] don't know put the important things here
[52:54] and build up to have your family here
[52:56] but then have sports up there it doesn't
[52:57] matter what it is if it's sports or if
[52:59] it's
[53:00] it's whatever it is just make sure god
[53:02] is down there at the bottom and he's
[53:04] your foundation
[53:05] otherwise it's not going to go anywhere
[53:07] your pyramid's going to topple
[53:09] all right hebrews chapter 5 11-14
[53:13] of whom we have many things to say and
[53:15] heart to be uttered
[53:17] seeing ye are dull of hearing for when
[53:19] that
[53:20] for when for the time you ought to be
[53:22] teachers you have need that one teach
[53:24] you again
[53:25] which be the first principles of the
[53:26] oracles of god
[53:28] and are become such as have need of milk
[53:31] and not strong meat
[53:33] you know paul he has this theme that
[53:35] he's going over
[53:36] and it's sort of a reference to isaiah
[53:39] 28 where he's talking about
[53:41] who he shall teach doctrine and
[53:43] everything it's those that are weaned
[53:45] from the breasts
[53:46] you know you have to be off of milk and
[53:48] move on to this to be able to move on to
[53:50] the stronger things
[53:51] paul's using that theme he also uses it
[53:53] in first corinthians
[53:55] chapter 3 i think and he's talking he
[53:58] was telling the corinthians that
[54:00] you know i wish i could teach you deep
[54:01] things but i cannot teach you deep
[54:03] things because i have to go over these
[54:04] basic things first
[54:06] you're not going to grow anywhere unless
[54:07] you actually cover the basics you know
[54:10] you have to actually want to be fed by
[54:12] this word you can't just ditch it and
[54:14] leave it
[54:14] it doesn't matter what walk of life
[54:16] you're at as a christian if
[54:18] if your experience was five years ago
[54:20] your first christian experience where
[54:22] you were born again and you didn't grow
[54:24] between there and there there's
[54:25] something wrong there's honestly
[54:27] something wrong and it can't be with god
[54:29] because god wants to give it to you one
[54:30] way or another
[54:31] there's something wrong you have to
[54:33] actually want it
[54:35] back to hebrews 5
[54:38] 13 he says for every one that uses milk
[54:41] is unskillful in the word of
[54:42] righteousness for he is a babe
[54:45] but strong meat belong it to them that
[54:47] are of full age
[54:53] wait i'm looking for an example person
[54:56] could i borrow your son brother jose
[54:59] okay
[55:03] you know
[55:07] awesome nice to meet you come over here
[55:09] please stand right beside me right
[55:12] so in the natural
[55:15] at one point i was this size right
[55:18] and i didn't stay this size how old are
[55:21] you
[55:21] um 10 10 okay yeah i'm 25.
[55:25] so 15 years ago it would be acceptable
[55:27] to be this size
[55:29] right there's nothing unnatural about
[55:30] that at all there's nothing unnatural
[55:35] about that
[55:35] but somehow do you know how tall you are
[55:38] no not at all all right but somehow
[55:42] i think i've got about two feet on them
[55:43] right somehow
[55:45] two feet happened did it happen
[55:47] overnight
[55:48] did i stay this way 15 years ago
[55:50] something changed right
[55:52] i had to do something what on earth did
[55:54] i do
[55:55] what do you do in the morning i
[55:59] wake up brush my teeth all right what do
[56:01] you do after that
[56:03] eat breakfast eat breakfast there you go
[56:06] he had to do something right
[56:08] i hazard to guess that i did the same
[56:09] thing right because between here and
[56:11] there
[56:12] something had to happen if i stopped
[56:14] eating at his age and said i was fine
[56:17] i wouldn't be here right now there's no
[56:19] way thank you joseph you're awesome
[56:21] i wouldn't be here right now something
[56:23] had to happen over this year
[56:25] yeah you can take your bible thank you
[56:28] make sure you eat it um something had to
[56:30] happen over the years
[56:32] i had to continuously eat now you see
[56:34] these meetings that we're at right now
[56:35] if we took the same mentality we do with
[56:37] our spiritual lives
[56:39] the way we are in these meetings you
[56:40] might pray for some special meetings and
[56:42] just say
[56:42] hey i'll go to those and lord please
[56:45] change my life i'm going to be
[56:46] really hungry when i get to those
[56:48] meetings and lord i'm expecting
[56:49] something great out of this whole thing
[56:51] but um what about the other meetings
[56:55] what about day to day between meetings
[56:56] what are you doing then
[56:58] what do you what are you doing on those
[56:59] days between the meetings i mean
[57:02] if i did that in the natural the same
[57:04] way and i had a special meeting this
[57:06] week and i wasn't having another one for
[57:07] two months
[57:08] i would probably eat three slices of
[57:10] pizza today and be like fine there's
[57:12] gonna be
[57:13] three slices of pizza in three months
[57:15] i'll be fine
[57:16] i won't be fine i'm gonna die right
[57:20] in fact i wish everybody just
[57:24] i wish we all just had the the spiritual
[57:26] sense to sense whenever we're starving
[57:28] just go for that word you know
[57:30] whenever you're constantly pulling your
[57:31] phone in front of your face there's
[57:32] something you're seeking
[57:34] whenever you're going out there and
[57:35] you're watching i don't know if you're
[57:37] watching something if you're just
[57:38] participating just
[57:40] watch your serving sizes i'm not telling
[57:43] you what's good and what's bad there's
[57:44] no way i could do that
[57:45] right there's no way i can tell for you
[57:47] because everybody's diet is going to be
[57:48] the difference
[57:49] not going to be the same way i don't
[57:51] expect that whatever works for me is not
[57:52] going to work for brother jack
[57:54] it's not going to work but i don't think
[57:55] we even eat the same thing in a week
[57:57] ever i don't think so but he's fine and
[57:59] i'm alive and he's alive
[58:01] you know and none of us died i mean so
[58:04] far
[58:04] it's just maybe eventually but it won't
[58:07] be because of what we ate because we're
[58:08] eating properly right now
[58:10] right second part of verse 14
[58:15] even those who by reason of use have
[58:17] their senses exercised
[58:19] to discern both good and evil
[58:23] that's back to those senses just like
[58:24] eve in the garden of eden you know
[58:27] you know the holy ghost it doesn't it
[58:30] doesn't make you a perfect person
[58:31] if you have it if you don't it doesn't
[58:34] make you a perfect person
[58:35] but it will sharpen your senses you know
[58:37] it'll help you understand what's right
[58:39] for you and what's wrong for you
[58:41] and i hope that i hope you realize
[58:42] that's its purpose you know
[58:44] down inside you still have to make a
[58:45] choice every minute of every day what
[58:47] you're gonna
[58:48] take in what you're gonna follow what
[58:49] you're gonna listen to
[58:51] um i have an example i got it from a
[58:55] book
[58:55] but if i had a chocolate chip cookie
[58:58] and i was gonna give it to you guys or
[59:01] to one of you
[59:02] and uh does anybody here not like
[59:04] chocolate chip
[59:05] not a good example all right you don't
[59:07] count right
[59:09] okay most people like them and if
[59:11] somebody doesn't like
[59:13] chocolate chip cookies there's not
[59:15] something wrong with you i don't know
[59:17] what to say
[59:18] all right but if i was gonna give you a
[59:19] chocolate chip cookie
[59:21] and i told you one of those chocolate
[59:23] chips was not a chocolate chip
[59:25] would you take it and it's just like
[59:28] what what if i told you it was something
[59:29] gross like a dead bug
[59:30] would you take it still would you eat it
[59:33] because it's one thing inside that
[59:34] chocolate chip
[59:35] inside that cookie that's wrong but it's
[59:37] still coated in all those good things
[59:38] right
[59:39] it's still sugar right it's still
[59:40] chocolatey goodness still warm it's
[59:42] still soft
[59:43] it's amazing right no you're not going
[59:46] to eat it it doesn't matter
[59:47] right now think of it if you're watching
[59:50] something
[59:51] in a movie it's like pg-13 fine but
[59:53] there's only one swear word you know
[59:55] it's fine
[59:56] let's just eat it let's just watch it
[59:57] anyway it's fine but that's just an
[59:59] example
[1:00:00] in movies there are so many things that
[1:00:01] the devil will slip into things that
[1:00:03] seem good
[1:00:04] that you you begin to i'm not gonna flat
[1:00:07] out say it's worship
[1:00:08] actually it is if you put it before god
[1:00:10] it's worship if you put something before
[1:00:12] god then it becomes worship you need to
[1:00:14] remember
[1:00:15] this is stuff that's attacking your soul
[1:00:17] the devil's going to find some way to
[1:00:18] code it up in something else
[1:00:20] amen now in the old testament
[1:00:25] uh israel coming out of
[1:00:28] exodus it types the church i mean coming
[1:00:31] out of egypt in the book of exodus it
[1:00:33] types the church
[1:00:34] and uh i'll hazard
[1:00:37] el hazard to say that we act the same
[1:00:39] way whether we judge them or not the
[1:00:41] israelites were people just like us and
[1:00:44] we tend to act the same way
[1:00:47] but a lot of the things that they did
[1:00:48] there are can be found although
[1:00:51] happening to them in the physical it
[1:00:52] happens to us in the in the spiritual
[1:00:54] one way or another and when they come
[1:00:57] out of uh
[1:00:58] egypt they come out and they're very
[1:01:01] hungry and they're in a barren land you
[1:01:03] know
[1:01:03] it's a it's a deserted land and it's and
[1:01:06] you know they cry out to the lord who
[1:01:07] led them there
[1:01:08] and they fully expect him to feed them
[1:01:10] because you know he led them there and
[1:01:12] that's that's perfectly fine he
[1:01:14] he had to have known that they would be
[1:01:15] hungry and he had a way to fill them
[1:01:17] you know before they cried out before
[1:01:18] they understood that he had a way to
[1:01:20] fill them up
[1:01:21] he already knew what he would do in the
[1:01:23] end to fill them up
[1:01:25] he had a way of escape for them
[1:01:28] in psalm 78 it kind of sums up
[1:01:31] what happens in the book of exodus and
[1:01:33] how they treated the food that god gave
[1:01:35] them fresh out of heaven
[1:01:36] psalm 78 21 therefore the lord heard
[1:01:40] this
[1:01:40] and was wrath so a fire was kindled
[1:01:43] against jacob
[1:01:45] and anger also came up against israel
[1:01:47] because they believed not in god and
[1:01:49] trusted not in his salvation
[1:01:51] though he had commanded the clouds from
[1:01:53] above and opened the doors of heaven
[1:01:55] and had rained down manna upon them to
[1:01:57] eat and had given to them
[1:01:59] of the corn of heaven man did eat angels
[1:02:02] food god gave them the best he had
[1:02:04] man did eat angel's food he sent them
[1:02:07] meat to the full
[1:02:08] he caused an east wind to blow in the
[1:02:10] heaven and by his power he brought in
[1:02:12] the south wind
[1:02:14] he rained flesh also upon them as dust
[1:02:16] and feathered fouls like as the sand of
[1:02:17] sea
[1:02:18] and he let it fall in the midst of their
[1:02:20] camp round about their habitations
[1:02:22] so they did eat and were well filled
[1:02:26] for he gave them their own desire you
[1:02:28] know i want you to note those words into
[1:02:30] verse 29 their own desire he
[1:02:32] he knew they had that desire because he
[1:02:34] put it there in the first place
[1:02:35] it's that thirst that brother brennan
[1:02:37] talks about he knew that they
[1:02:39] they they had a desire and they didn't
[1:02:42] know how to fill it they didn't know
[1:02:44] what would fill it but god knew
[1:02:45] in the same way you thirst after things
[1:02:48] in this world time and time again and
[1:02:49] there's only one thing that can fill it
[1:02:51] there's only one and you know god knows
[1:02:54] exactly how to fill it and god will send
[1:02:56] it to you
[1:02:57] and it's up to you to take it or not
[1:02:59] it's up to you and what they failed to
[1:03:00] do is they failed to
[1:03:02] take it because you read in verse 30
[1:03:04] they said it says they were not
[1:03:05] estranged from their lusts but while
[1:03:07] their meat was yet in their mouths
[1:03:11] while their meat was yet in their mouths
[1:03:13] they were still
[1:03:14] yet in their mouths they didn't even
[1:03:16] digest it they didn't even give god the
[1:03:17] time to fill up
[1:03:19] to to give them that fulfilling that
[1:03:21] they needed it was still
[1:03:22] in their mouths it didn't even get
[1:03:23] swallowed that's how ungrateful that we
[1:03:26] can be with god's word
[1:03:27] you know and it puts me in mind of a
[1:03:30] of a wine tasting if anybody knows how
[1:03:33] wine tasting goes they
[1:03:35] they have a whole bunch of wines in a
[1:03:36] room and they give you a bucket because
[1:03:38] you're just going to take a sip of each
[1:03:40] one and then spit it right back out
[1:03:42] you're just going to take a sip oh that
[1:03:43] tastes me you know make your judgment
[1:03:46] spit it right back
[1:03:46] out time and time again but you're not
[1:03:49] actually letting it affect you because
[1:03:50] they don't want you to get drunk
[1:03:52] they don't want you to get filled with
[1:03:54] that stimulation of revelation you know
[1:03:56] they don't want you to actually feel
[1:03:58] what god has for you
[1:04:00] oh man yes you know it
[1:04:04] church isn't a wine tasting for you and
[1:04:07] we treat it like one time and time again
[1:04:09] you know you just make your judgment oh
[1:04:11] i don't like the way that guy's been
[1:04:13] stuttering this whole time who invited
[1:04:14] him to this church
[1:04:15] you know i don't like the way he looks
[1:04:17] he keeps sweating
[1:04:19] you know i don't like the way the pews
[1:04:20] are i don't like the people in the
[1:04:21] church i don't like this and that and
[1:04:23] then walk right back out and forget that
[1:04:24] god was there
[1:04:26] he showed up but you didn't show up
[1:04:27] ready to receive it
[1:04:29] that's just so horrible while the meat
[1:04:32] was yet in their minds you know
[1:04:34] i love the way true christians digest
[1:04:36] the word i was uh
[1:04:39] i was uh when i when i lived in kenya i
[1:04:43] lived with my
[1:04:44] grandma for about two months you know
[1:04:46] and she had us uh
[1:04:47] she had us hurt her cows and i hated it
[1:04:50] so much
[1:04:51] we didn't ride horses you ever see the
[1:04:52] pictures of the little african kid
[1:04:54] hitting a
[1:04:54] kid hitting a cow with a rod you know
[1:04:56] just following it to the watering hole
[1:04:58] that's what i did
[1:04:59] and i hated it every morning you just
[1:05:01] walk the cows out early in the morning
[1:05:03] they eat you watch them you take them to
[1:05:05] the river you come back and then you do
[1:05:07] it again halfway through the day it was
[1:05:08] so boring
[1:05:09] i hated it so much every single day but
[1:05:12] i didn't understand you know
[1:05:14] i had there were cows and then there
[1:05:16] were sheep there i want you to think of
[1:05:18] this spiritually because we are god
[1:05:19] sheep you know
[1:05:21] and they were they were sheep there and
[1:05:22] i would take them out there and they'd
[1:05:24] they'd just eat all day they'd just chew
[1:05:27] all day and i couldn't understand where
[1:05:28] they put it and then we brought them
[1:05:30] home
[1:05:31] back to my grandma's house we tied them
[1:05:33] up under the trees
[1:05:35] and in the shade of the trees they just
[1:05:36] sit down or lie down or whatever
[1:05:39] and then i'd see them chewing again and
[1:05:41] i didn't understand it
[1:05:42] because where they were lying down they
[1:05:44] had laying down there so often
[1:05:46] that every blade of grass in that area
[1:05:48] was picked out
[1:05:49] every blade there was nothing to eat
[1:05:51] they couldn't reach the trees
[1:05:52] but they were still chewing and i was
[1:05:53] like what are you chewing right now you
[1:05:55] know
[1:05:56] i didn't even know i didn't understand
[1:05:57] what rumination was
[1:05:59] i didn't know what cud was or anything
[1:06:01] like that but
[1:06:02] it re it made me realize you know they
[1:06:05] would regurgitate it from one of their
[1:06:07] stomachs and just start chewing it all
[1:06:08] over again something they were given
[1:06:10] they'd come back and go over it all over
[1:06:12] again you know so they could digest it
[1:06:14] real good
[1:06:15] and i want you to think of it that way
[1:06:17] you know you might you might end up in a
[1:06:19] really bad place where
[1:06:20] you don't understand you you might have
[1:06:23] to live off of a past
[1:06:24] experience and a past tense testimony
[1:06:26] because you'll be out there in the world
[1:06:27] and you won't have anything
[1:06:29] you won't have anything but the word of
[1:06:30] god that's been given to you to survive
[1:06:32] you won't see another christian in sight
[1:06:34] you may not see a minister
[1:06:35] you may not see anybody at your back you
[1:06:38] know and you just have to go off of what
[1:06:40] you've been given over time
[1:06:41] amen verse 31.
[1:06:46] remember verse 30 while the meat was yet
[1:06:48] in their mouths
[1:06:49] 31 the wrath of god came upon them and
[1:06:52] slew the fattest of them
[1:06:53] and smote down the chosen men of israel
[1:06:56] for all this
[1:06:56] they sinned still and believed not for
[1:06:59] his wondrous works
[1:07:00] it's how much does god have to do
[1:07:04] to get his word to us it's just so much
[1:07:07] that he's done it it's never been this
[1:07:10] successful in
[1:07:11] any church age just just how much word
[1:07:14] you have
[1:07:14] at the you just pick up your phone and
[1:07:16] it's there the bible's right there
[1:07:18] message books everywhere you have
[1:07:20] brothers and sisters at least we do
[1:07:22] who will help hold you up and you know
[1:07:24] ministers you can go to there's just so
[1:07:26] much
[1:07:27] that god's done to get his word to you
[1:07:29] and often enough we just drop it and
[1:07:31] walk away and do something else
[1:07:33] put something before god and have an
[1:07:34] idol that's the worst
[1:07:38] he makes it so easy to have a
[1:07:39] relationship with as you just invest
[1:07:41] your time it doesn't even cost money
[1:07:44] it doesn't cost that much money
[1:07:47] that reminds me okay i don't want to get
[1:07:51] ahead of myself
[1:07:54] by the brand of 1956 at cadis barnea
[1:07:56] they went out
[1:07:57] as soon as they got over there they
[1:07:59] began to complain
[1:08:00] they only been out in the desert three
[1:08:02] months they began to say oh if i had
[1:08:04] some garlic
[1:08:05] if i had some leeks they were out there
[1:08:07] and had substituted angels food for
[1:08:09] garlic
[1:08:10] and were complaining why their
[1:08:12] gastronomics wasn't able to digest
[1:08:14] angel's food that's what's the matter
[1:08:16] today we haven't had an old time holy
[1:08:18] ghost reviver and our spiritual
[1:08:19] gastronomics is not able to digest real
[1:08:21] good old-fashioned holy ghost hold on
[1:08:23] revival
[1:08:24] he says counter we need a doctor's
[1:08:25] prescription that's dr jesus
[1:08:27] prescription that'll get us right
[1:08:30] you know this this is gospel it's not
[1:08:33] it's not some low fat you know lean
[1:08:36] whatever gluten-free non-gmo blah blah
[1:08:39] blah it's
[1:08:40] actually organic true gospel and it's
[1:08:43] just
[1:08:44] so perfect and he's given it to us he's
[1:08:45] done everything he can to get it to us
[1:08:47] and we just pass it up
[1:08:49] i hate to see that time and time again
[1:08:51] and i know it attacks young people
[1:08:53] any young people listening to this it's
[1:08:55] attacked me it's attacked anyone it
[1:08:56] attacks anybody at
[1:08:58] any age you just relax and you know just
[1:09:01] let slip by whatever
[1:09:02] whatever god's done for you and just
[1:09:04] settle for whatever level you're at
[1:09:06] and just don't even accept anything more
[1:09:08] don't even try to exercise or do
[1:09:10] anything for it
[1:09:13] the supernatural 1956 that's what's the
[1:09:16] matter with people today
[1:09:17] they got the campground cramps they go
[1:09:19] to revival and have a great time
[1:09:20] the first thing you know a little after
[1:09:22] that before another revival could come
[1:09:24] along
[1:09:24] they're back in the world again you know
[1:09:27] brother
[1:09:27] brother branham tells a story in the
[1:09:30] invasion of the united states 1954
[1:09:32] and it's about this horse that i think
[1:09:34] he used to be a rancher
[1:09:36] it's about this horse they had tied up
[1:09:38] and uh
[1:09:39] no i think it was out in a in a field
[1:09:42] and
[1:09:44] he they tied him in a field full of
[1:09:45] alfalfa it's a type of grass
[1:09:47] and it would be penned up all day and it
[1:09:50] would be fine
[1:09:50] you know he has plenty of grass to eat
[1:09:52] and it's right there
[1:09:53] but there was this fence surrounding the
[1:09:56] place and on the other side of the fence
[1:09:57] there was a sinkhole
[1:09:58] and inside the sinkhole there was
[1:10:00] orchard grass
[1:10:02] and the horse just loved orchard grass
[1:10:04] so much he would jump over that fence
[1:10:07] and guess what inside the sinkhole there
[1:10:09] was actually broken glass and wires
[1:10:12] and it's a sinkhole of course you're
[1:10:14] going to sink inside of it
[1:10:15] so this horse would jump the fence all
[1:10:17] the time no matter how many times they
[1:10:19] left it in
[1:10:19] the field full of perfectly good grass
[1:10:22] he would jump the fence
[1:10:23] into the sinkhole and get cut up just to
[1:10:25] get a couple bites
[1:10:26] of orchard grass and it was just the
[1:10:28] worst
[1:10:29] now he in conclusion on that story he
[1:10:31] says
[1:10:34] i've often thought of that picture the
[1:10:36] way of a transgressor is hard he would
[1:10:38] he just wouldn't stay still where he was
[1:10:40] eating and having a wonderful time
[1:10:42] but he had to jump the fence and go get
[1:10:44] all bruised and cut up like that just to
[1:10:45] get a mouthful of grass of some other
[1:10:47] different kind
[1:10:48] now that's just about the way people
[1:10:50] does that jumps the fence of god's
[1:10:51] pastor
[1:10:52] don't you believe it gets out go go out
[1:10:55] today come in is in church having a
[1:10:57] wonderful time
[1:10:58] then tomorrow sell out for something
[1:10:59] like that it makes it very hard
[1:11:01] you know he also says an inspiration
[1:11:06] if the devil wants to tell you you go
[1:11:08] join the church just stand over on the
[1:11:10] side
[1:11:10] some glorious day in the millennium
[1:11:12] there will be a healing for the sick and
[1:11:13] there'll be experiences again
[1:11:15] you know he wants to keep you at that
[1:11:17] one level and not really think about the
[1:11:19] future
[1:11:20] not really think about growing into
[1:11:21] something new
[1:11:23] if you want the devil to stick that down
[1:11:24] your throat and wait for something else
[1:11:26] you're backing
[1:11:27] passing by pie and ice cream fried
[1:11:29] chicken and the good things there's just
[1:11:31] so many things god has for us you know
[1:11:40] he also says we shut ourselves off and
[1:11:42] they do it automatically because he's
[1:11:44] talking about people who aren't
[1:11:45] christians
[1:11:47] they do it automatically we do it
[1:11:49] because we want to do it
[1:11:51] we shut ourselves off from god because
[1:11:53] we want to do it what could you want
[1:11:54] that would be more than
[1:11:55] more than what god has to offer you we
[1:11:58] do it because we want to do it
[1:12:00] god is good he provides it for us but
[1:12:01] too many today don't want to get into
[1:12:03] that healthy place with god
[1:12:05] a healthy christian have a healthy
[1:12:06] spirit you certainly would
[1:12:08] rally for a healthy body anybody would
[1:12:11] well that body no matter how much health
[1:12:12] you put in that body it's going back to
[1:12:14] the dust
[1:12:15] i want you to think of it spiritually
[1:12:17] you know we're not headed back to the
[1:12:19] dust we're predestinated seed
[1:12:21] god has something something he wants to
[1:12:23] bring us to some
[1:12:24] something he wants to build you to we
[1:12:26] just have to accept it
[1:12:31] you know
[1:12:34] i did say that i was typing the
[1:12:36] spiritual to the natural and
[1:12:38] i just wanted to say you know when we're
[1:12:41] born
[1:12:41] as children the first
[1:12:44] the first source of food that we have is
[1:12:47] from our mother
[1:12:48] right and
[1:12:51] you're just totally reliant on her
[1:12:52] providing for you it's it's from her
[1:12:54] milk that's where you get all your
[1:12:55] nutrients and every god's
[1:12:57] naturally provided something in your
[1:13:00] mother there's something
[1:13:01] genetically in your mother that can
[1:13:03] provide what you need
[1:13:04] everything you need at that point and
[1:13:06] you know a true mother will act that way
[1:13:08] she will continue to take care of her
[1:13:09] child
[1:13:10] um spiritually speaking
[1:13:14] you know your mother is your first
[1:13:15] gospel you're yeah the first people is
[1:13:17] your mother there's five of them
[1:13:19] and the first one is your mother you're
[1:13:20] gonna hear what's right and what's wrong
[1:13:22] and you're gonna
[1:13:23] she's gonna punish you in little ways
[1:13:25] here and there and you just have to
[1:13:27] accept it and learn because she knows
[1:13:29] what's best for you because god put that
[1:13:31] inside her to
[1:13:32] guide you through the early stages of
[1:13:33] life but as you get older
[1:13:36] both of your parents they they help you
[1:13:38] eat they help you make sure you eat your
[1:13:40] vegetables they watch what goes on your
[1:13:42] plate with how much you eat
[1:13:43] what portion sizes what you finish they
[1:13:45] watch so many things about that
[1:13:47] and uh in the same way they make sure
[1:13:49] you go to church they take you to sunday
[1:13:51] school if
[1:13:52] especially if you're a message kid or a
[1:13:53] church kid they'll take you to sunday
[1:13:55] school and
[1:13:55] they they just want you to grow up to be
[1:13:57] better than they were and that's a
[1:13:59] perfectly fine ambition
[1:14:04] but take you to church make sure you go
[1:14:05] to sunday school they'll sometimes help
[1:14:07] you with a bible study you know
[1:14:08] help you with devotions in the house
[1:14:10] they want to
[1:14:11] make sure you get exactly what you need
[1:14:14] but as you grow
[1:14:14] older and that's until about 12 years
[1:14:16] old but then you turn into an adolescent
[1:14:18] and everything changes you get your
[1:14:20] first
[1:14:20] job and you suddenly have a life outside
[1:14:24] of what your parents are dealing with
[1:14:25] that they don't really have to watch
[1:14:27] you know they don't get to see what
[1:14:29] you're doing out there
[1:14:30] and uh you have you finally you might be
[1:14:33] able to afford a car but you can buy
[1:14:35] some food that she's not that they're
[1:14:37] not providing for you for once
[1:14:38] you can buy whatever you want they're
[1:14:40] not watching what you're doing what
[1:14:41] you're eating
[1:14:42] and you have the secret life away from
[1:14:44] them um
[1:14:47] in the same way spiritually speaking you
[1:14:49] could you get to this place where you're
[1:14:51] you're growing and you're in a different
[1:14:53] generation and
[1:14:54] you know you're dealing with stuff that
[1:14:56] they've never dealt with before
[1:14:57] and you just start um
[1:15:01] you start to you might end up picking up
[1:15:04] a habit it might be something on the
[1:15:06] internet it might be some sort of movie
[1:15:07] it might be something but since you're
[1:15:08] older and wiser you're
[1:15:10] able to hide it from them you make sure
[1:15:12] you're able to
[1:15:13] to partake of this thing that's not
[1:15:15] right and you're fine with that
[1:15:17] but there they wouldn't be fine with it
[1:15:18] you just keep it a secret from them just
[1:15:20] the way eve would
[1:15:22] and then you get older and you can
[1:15:25] become a freshman in college
[1:15:27] you know and there's something called
[1:15:28] the freshman 15 because it's
[1:15:30] presumed when you get to college you're
[1:15:32] going to gain some weight your whole
[1:15:34] schedule gets completely changed
[1:15:36] you're not living at home anymore
[1:15:37] especially if you live on campus you're
[1:15:39] not a home anymore
[1:15:40] it's totally different it's up to you
[1:15:42] because you are a budding adult it's
[1:15:44] just totally different
[1:15:45] and uh in the same way spiritually
[1:15:48] college can shove anything down your
[1:15:50] throat
[1:15:51] one way or another and it has nothing to
[1:15:52] do with what you've heard in church what
[1:15:54] you hear in church is not what you're
[1:15:55] going to hear in college at all
[1:15:57] nothing nothing over there is going to
[1:15:59] match up with whatever's over here
[1:16:00] and it's going to be political stuff
[1:16:02] scientific stuff religious stuff there's
[1:16:04] going to be all sorts of things that are
[1:16:06] thrown at you in college and the only
[1:16:07] way you can get through that
[1:16:08] is if you've been maintaining your diet
[1:16:10] through the whole the whole shebang
[1:16:12] right but it doesn't stop there
[1:16:15] because i imagine as you get older
[1:16:19] then you know if you if you didn't
[1:16:22] correct the way you're eating
[1:16:23] by the time you get older then you will
[1:16:25] get to be
[1:16:27] middle-aged or older and you'll just
[1:16:29] start to put on weight put on this gut
[1:16:31] and you know you just have a pot belly
[1:16:33] you know your career gets in the way
[1:16:35] your time gets taken up and then you
[1:16:36] have kids
[1:16:37] and guess what you turn into your
[1:16:39] parents and you didn't even see that
[1:16:40] happen
[1:16:41] it's like 20 years just went by and you
[1:16:43] don't know what just happened and you're
[1:16:44] telling your kids to eat your vegetables
[1:16:46] what are they going to say to look like
[1:16:48] you do they want to look like you
[1:16:51] spiritually speaking if you are doing
[1:16:52] stuff that you know is not acceptable it
[1:16:55] doesn't line up with what's being said
[1:16:56] by your pastor in church
[1:16:58] and then you're over there at home
[1:16:59] trying to judge what your parents what
[1:17:01] what your children are doing and trying
[1:17:02] to tell them what's right and what's
[1:17:03] wrong
[1:17:04] what are they going to take out of that
[1:17:06] to look like you
[1:17:07] do they want to do you are you an actual
[1:17:09] example that god can use to
[1:17:11] affect the life of your children that's
[1:17:13] the question
[1:17:19] you know whenever i was growing up
[1:17:22] i went through different phases where
[1:17:24] there were things that i would partake
[1:17:25] of that i knew was wrong
[1:17:27] and i hid from my parents of course that
[1:17:29] i just went over that
[1:17:30] and one of them was music and it would
[1:17:33] just
[1:17:34] completely take me over and i would just
[1:17:36] i would just need to collect a whole
[1:17:37] bunch of really really bad songs
[1:17:40] i knew i couldn't play them when my dad
[1:17:41] was around or anything and i would hide
[1:17:43] them from
[1:17:44] my parents both of them i would hide
[1:17:46] them from some of my siblings
[1:17:48] and there was something in me that knew
[1:17:50] it was wrong so i would hide it
[1:17:52] and i would do something that i call
[1:17:54] right now that is spiritual diet because
[1:17:57] i didn't have anything to fill
[1:18:00] well i didn't know how to fill the void
[1:18:03] that the music was filling
[1:18:04] but since i knew it was wrong and my
[1:18:06] heart was condemning me i would just
[1:18:08] quit listening to that music you know
[1:18:10] and just delete all the files and be
[1:18:11] like okay i'm quitting cold turkey
[1:18:14] but that was me that i was i was
[1:18:15] deciding to do that it was something i
[1:18:17] thought i could do
[1:18:18] by myself so i'd just be sitting in the
[1:18:20] room by myself and just you know it's
[1:18:21] quiet
[1:18:22] and i try to play a christian song and
[1:18:24] it's not working you know it's just not
[1:18:26] the same it doesn't have that move
[1:18:28] that i really really thought that i
[1:18:29] needed
[1:18:31] and eventually a song would occur to me
[1:18:33] that's very close to a christian song i
[1:18:35] can't actually necessarily say that it's
[1:18:37] bad but that song would occur to me and
[1:18:39] i just say
[1:18:40] let me download just that one it's fine
[1:18:42] just that one
[1:18:43] no just listen to that one it'll be fine
[1:18:45] there's nothing wrong with that
[1:18:46] and then suddenly there'd be another and
[1:18:48] then another i did it multiple times
[1:18:50] before i got the holy ghost
[1:18:52] but when i did when i finally did get
[1:18:55] the holy ghost god just completely
[1:18:57] filled that
[1:18:58] and it was just weird because i would
[1:19:00] sit in the room and i'd be bored and
[1:19:02] i just didn't care you know that's weird
[1:19:05] for a young person to just sit there and
[1:19:07] not care about
[1:19:08] you know just sit there and
[1:19:12] i know people want young people think
[1:19:14] about this and you wonder it's like what
[1:19:15] am i going to do i'm going to be so
[1:19:17] bored after i get the holy ghost because
[1:19:18] i'm going to do a whole bunch of holy
[1:19:20] things and
[1:19:21] how many tapes can you listen to in a
[1:19:23] day you know like
[1:19:24] honestly how many can you listen to in a
[1:19:26] day
[1:19:28] but i want to tell you about matthew 7
[1:19:30] 31
[1:19:31] he says therefore take no thought saying
[1:19:33] what shall we eat
[1:19:34] or what shall we drink or wherewithal
[1:19:37] shall be we be clothed
[1:19:38] for after all these things do the
[1:19:41] gentiles sink
[1:19:42] for your heavenly father knoweth that ye
[1:19:44] have need of all these things but seek
[1:19:45] ye first
[1:19:46] the kingdom of god and his righteousness
[1:19:49] and all these things shall be added unto
[1:19:51] you
[1:19:52] take there nor therefore no thought for
[1:19:54] the morrow for the morrow shall take
[1:19:55] thought take thought for the things of
[1:19:57] itself sufficient unto the day is the
[1:19:59] evil thereof
[1:20:01] you know after he after he sanctifies
[1:20:04] you
[1:20:04] and he calls you and he fills you with
[1:20:06] the holy ghost he's actually going to
[1:20:07] find a way to use you
[1:20:09] your time is going to disappear and you
[1:20:10] will know what happened he'll be
[1:20:12] completely different he's actually going
[1:20:13] to put you into service
[1:20:15] and time and time again i don't know
[1:20:16] what that service is gonna be
[1:20:19] but i just advise you just seek ye first
[1:20:22] the kingdom of god you know
[1:20:23] he's got something that he wants you to
[1:20:25] do he's got so much of his word that he
[1:20:28] wants to use to bring you higher
[1:20:32] brother branham in 1955 the water of
[1:20:34] separation he says i just learned from
[1:20:36] some medical research the other day that
[1:20:37] leprosy's caused from the wrong diet
[1:20:39] that's what causes sin is the wrong
[1:20:41] spiritual diet it causes an eating
[1:20:43] leprosy that only god alone can cure and
[1:20:46] you know he
[1:20:47] i know he's not a doctor he's a prophet
[1:20:49] but he knew more about where diseases
[1:20:51] came from than anybody that i know
[1:20:53] you know i've learned more about where
[1:20:55] diseases came from than anyone i know
[1:20:56] and he says that the number one disease
[1:20:59] that's affecting the world isn't
[1:21:01] isn't heart disease even though that's
[1:21:03] what scientists believe he says it's sin
[1:21:05] disease you know if you want to get rid
[1:21:07] of those
[1:21:08] secret sins and those things that you do
[1:21:10] that are not right you actually have to
[1:21:11] change your diet
[1:21:13] you have to stand on the word and make
[1:21:14] sure you try to live it and actually go
[1:21:16] according to it
[1:21:19] you just have to keep feeding that white
[1:21:20] dog not the black dog
[1:21:22] because the decision will always be
[1:21:23] there it doesn't matter how fit you get
[1:21:26] you can't stay that fit
[1:21:28] unless you actually continue to
[1:21:31] practice and continue to develop and to
[1:21:33] continue to build and actually exercise
[1:21:36] it gets harder and harder as you get
[1:21:37] older that's fine but it wasn't supposed
[1:21:39] to be easy nobody ever said it was going
[1:21:41] to be
[1:21:42] isaiah 55
[1:21:45] ho everyone that thirsteth come you to
[1:21:47] the waters and he that hath no money
[1:21:49] come ye buy and eat come buy wine and
[1:21:53] milk without money and without price
[1:21:55] wherefore do you spend money for that
[1:21:57] which is not bread and your labor for
[1:21:59] that which satisfyeth not
[1:22:01] hearken diligently unto me and ee that
[1:22:03] which is good
[1:22:05] and let your soul delight yourself and
[1:22:07] fatness
[1:22:08] incline your ear okay i know you might
[1:22:10] ask let your soul delight itself in
[1:22:12] fatness why would i
[1:22:13] you were just talking about not being
[1:22:15] fat this whole time why would you talk
[1:22:16] about being fat
[1:22:18] i mean your soul can get fat if you
[1:22:21] don't i'm trying to say if you don't
[1:22:22] actually exercise the word then you will
[1:22:24] get fat
[1:22:25] you'll just sit there and that's what i
[1:22:26] was talking about that intellectual
[1:22:28] faith
[1:22:29] incline your ear and come unto me here
[1:22:31] and your soul shall live
[1:22:32] and i will make an everlasting covenant
[1:22:34] with you even the sure mercies of david
[1:22:36] you know he's saying it's
[1:22:38] it's without money and without price
[1:22:39] there's so many things that you end up
[1:22:41] spending
[1:22:43] in your quest to fill that void that are
[1:22:45] just not
[1:22:46] you don't want to spend them it'll take
[1:22:47] you so far you'll spend your time you'll
[1:22:49] spend your youth
[1:22:50] you know the devil will continue lying
[1:22:52] to you throughout all those stages of
[1:22:54] your life
[1:22:55] that you're too young you should just be
[1:22:57] able to do what you want to do just live
[1:22:59] life a little bit you're you're too old
[1:23:01] that you're past that age where you can
[1:23:02] do such stuff or
[1:23:03] you're too busy or something he will
[1:23:05] always throw something in the way to lie
[1:23:07] to you to keep you away from getting
[1:23:08] that thing
[1:23:13] brother branham says in life 1958
[1:23:17] now that blessed thirst what made it
[1:23:19] come god made you that way and the devil
[1:23:22] turns around and says
[1:23:23] this is life this is life but you're
[1:23:25] receiving death all the time
[1:23:26] now the word death means a separation
[1:23:30] and uh that's a separation i
[1:23:34] not sure exactly the etymology of it but
[1:23:36] i see it as
[1:23:38] you know there's so many things that can
[1:23:40] separate you from god and that's all
[1:23:42] these things i've been talking about
[1:23:43] these idols that you put in front of you
[1:23:45] and uh it's just something especially my
[1:23:49] phone it separates me from
[1:23:50] everything around me it for example you
[1:23:53] know if i'm in a social setting and i
[1:23:55] pull up my phone that means
[1:23:56] i've just said that everybody around me
[1:23:58] is not good enough
[1:23:59] and there's something else important
[1:24:01] unless it's someone across the table who
[1:24:03] texted me you know what i mean
[1:24:04] but everyone around me is not good
[1:24:06] enough and i'm just going to take what's
[1:24:08] on my phone because you guys just don't
[1:24:09] matter that much
[1:24:10] that's exactly what that message means
[1:24:13] i'm not judging anybody though
[1:24:14] i do the same thing and
[1:24:20] i just i just want god to grow us all
[1:24:24] and
[1:24:24] so we don't just sit here you know
[1:24:27] especially after meetings like this i'm
[1:24:28] fully expecting god's gonna come through
[1:24:30] and give us all something different
[1:24:32] after these meetings i want something to
[1:24:34] be lasting something for you to remember
[1:24:36] i want you to look back on this day and
[1:24:37] be like god did something there
[1:24:40] and i can build on it because because he
[1:24:42] gave me something to work on might not
[1:24:43] be my
[1:24:44] sermon it might be somebody else's it
[1:24:45] might be some something brother stephen
[1:24:47] brother nathan says it might be some
[1:24:49] sort of
[1:24:49] sort of healing it might any sort of
[1:24:51] experience god can build on it if you
[1:24:53] continue to feed on that word
[1:24:55] amen musicians can come back
[1:25:07] let's have a word of prayer lord
[1:25:11] i thank you for coming down and blessing
[1:25:13] us with your word this evening lord
[1:25:17] lord to some people this may seem silly
[1:25:19] that we dedicate our time
[1:25:21] and energy to come back time and again
[1:25:23] but
[1:25:24] there's just something for us lord we
[1:25:26] know that you can fill us up
[1:25:28] you alone have that thing that can
[1:25:30] satisfy that desire in our hearts lord
[1:25:33] we just ask that you do that we open
[1:25:35] ourselves to receive
[1:25:37] we ask that you please be a blessing in
[1:25:39] the next few services lord
[1:25:42] we thank you for the blessing you've
[1:25:43] given us tonight lord but lord we want
[1:25:45] more
[1:25:46] we ask for more and we know that you
[1:25:47] will provide it
[1:25:49] we ask this in the name of jesus christ
[1:25:52] amen
[1:25:56] [Music]
[1:26:02] [Applause]
[1:26:07] [Music]
[1:26:17] praise the lord certainly appreciate uh
[1:26:22] for the airing on tonight and uh
[1:26:25] spiritual gastronomics
[1:26:28] so many um uh examples and types that
[1:26:32] they're about just having the right diet
[1:26:35] and
[1:26:36] spiritually but i think one thing i'm
[1:26:38] going to take with me
[1:26:40] um tonight is just this example of
[1:26:44] him uh his 10 year old self and his 25
[1:26:48] year old self
[1:26:50] and uh had he stopped eating at 10 years
[1:26:54] old then he wouldn't be the person that
[1:26:56] he is today
[1:26:57] and i think spiritually
[1:27:01] some of us have stopped eating right and
[1:27:04] um because we stopped eating on the word
[1:27:06] of god
[1:27:08] it has produced the situations that
[1:27:11] we're in even
[1:27:12] as we sit and listen to the word tonight
[1:27:16] and
[1:27:16] i just pray that the holy spirit had
[1:27:20] uh the opportunity tonight just to
[1:27:22] challenge
[1:27:24] us amen and cause us to maybe look at
[1:27:27] what we're eating and i never even
[1:27:29] looked at how
[1:27:31] uh eve she has something that she wanted
[1:27:35] to share but she shared it privately
[1:27:38] not publicly see if it was something
[1:27:40] good that she wanted to share then she
[1:27:43] would have waited till god came down
[1:27:44] in the cool of the evening but she
[1:27:47] pulled
[1:27:47] adam to the side privately and she began
[1:27:49] to share this this this
[1:27:51] new thing that she had and and often
[1:27:54] times um
[1:27:56] the devil's done the same thing to us to
[1:27:58] share something privately with us and
[1:28:00] it's gotten us off our diet
[1:28:02] we're not eating right we're not acting
[1:28:04] right we're not responding right but i
[1:28:06] believe tonight the holy spirit just
[1:28:07] kind of came to
[1:28:09] to challenge us challenges challenges
[1:28:12] it was just um talking to the brothers
[1:28:16] and
[1:28:16] they coming here from um
[1:28:21] visiting in sarasota my brother nathan
[1:28:25] preached there at brother
[1:28:26] danny stevens church um
[1:28:29] brother danny had to leave and um
[1:28:32] take a trip to texas he would think he
[1:28:35] went out to preach a funeral i think it
[1:28:37] was yesterday they were telling me
[1:28:39] and what had happened it was a
[1:28:42] young sister a family had left the
[1:28:45] church
[1:28:46] a man and you know doing what they want
[1:28:48] to do and this young girl 19 years old
[1:28:51] got herself a boyfriend she got herself
[1:28:55] a boyfriend
[1:28:56] thought she had somebody that loved her
[1:28:57] and so on and so forth but
[1:29:00] something happened in their relationship
[1:29:01] that that young man
[1:29:03] took a gun and shot that girl
[1:29:07] and when he shot her she was strong
[1:29:10] enough to get to the telephone just to
[1:29:14] call 9-1-1 and to tell him that she had
[1:29:17] been shot and
[1:29:18] and 9-1-1 came but by the time they got
[1:29:20] there she was gone
[1:29:23] now you think about things like that see
[1:29:25] the devil doesn't show us the whole
[1:29:27] picture he just kind of pulls us out and
[1:29:29] pulls us into certain situations and
[1:29:31] and i tell you if you were to if you
[1:29:33] were to die in a situation like that
[1:29:37] you have to ask yourself a question
[1:29:38] would you be ready to meet god
[1:29:41] would you be ready to meet god right
[1:29:44] the fun that the devil presents to us a
[1:29:47] man is temporary fun
[1:29:49] amen satan wants to use that because his
[1:29:51] his whole desire is to steal
[1:29:54] kill and destroy
[1:30:00] i pray tonight you've heard the voice of
[1:30:03] the lord jesus speaking to you
[1:30:06] there's anything that you need to make
[1:30:07] right with god you're in the right place
[1:30:09] to make it right
[1:30:11] if you're in your living room you're in
[1:30:12] the right place to make it right if
[1:30:14] you're
[1:30:15] a man in your bedroom you're in the
[1:30:16] right place to make it right if you're
[1:30:17] in your car
[1:30:18] you're in the right place to make it
[1:30:19] right if you're in the house of god
[1:30:21] tonight
[1:30:22] you're in the right place to make it
[1:30:24] right

[1:38:59] oh jesus
[1:39:02] you know we were talking about these
[1:39:05] services
[1:39:06] for some time and
[1:39:10] just really trying to see which way
[1:39:13] things uh would go and
[1:39:17] we had it planned before the virus even
[1:39:20] struck
[1:39:21] we had this plan then when the virus
[1:39:24] came we were just
[1:39:26] so unsure and as i just began to seek
[1:39:28] the lord and
[1:39:30] pray it gave me a peace amen to go
[1:39:33] forward with these services and as i was
[1:39:36] thinking about
[1:39:37] you know just the youth began to just
[1:39:39] think about our church and
[1:39:41] you know just i just knew that our young
[1:39:42] people just needed something just needed
[1:39:44] something
[1:39:46] and tonight i just believe the lord
[1:39:48] jesus has kind of come and just kind of
[1:39:50] set this this set the weekend just right
[1:39:53] you know with this message
[1:39:55] and and if nobody else amen heard from
[1:39:58] god i know i heard from god tonight
[1:40:01] i know i heard from god tonight and i
[1:40:03] know god was speaking in this place
[1:40:04] tonight
[1:40:05] just just too too perfect some of the
[1:40:07] things that brother aaron was saying and
[1:40:09] amen and you know one of the other
[1:40:11] things he said is that
[1:40:13] you know you just can't go and feed in
[1:40:15] one meeting
[1:40:17] and then think you're going to stay
[1:40:18] strong amen you've got to go back if you
[1:40:21] if you stop if you you might have had a
[1:40:22] good meal today but if you don't eat
[1:40:24] tomorrow you're going to start having
[1:40:25] some problems soon
[1:40:27] right so you got to keep feeding on the
[1:40:28] word of god
[1:40:30] keep feeding on the word of god
[1:40:33] hallelujah i want to encourage you to do
[1:40:35] that so
[1:40:35] brother aaron thank you so much for just
[1:40:37] yielding yourself and getting out of the
