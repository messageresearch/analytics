[14:17] here again i want to just thank you all
[14:19] for putting up with me for the past
[14:21] three wins this
[14:23] amen um
[14:25] i've had a really wonderful time in the
[14:26] word
[14:28] amen um
[14:31] looking at this
[14:33] uh
[14:34] i preached a while back
[14:36] on a subject called portals
[14:41] amen and um
[14:44] looking at that this message here
[14:48] sort of i had prepared or was on my
[14:51] heart immediately after that because
[14:53] amen um
[14:56] but the lord kind of took me in a
[14:58] different direction and i was just kind
[14:59] of glad when um
[15:02] i had this opportunity
[15:04] to share
[15:07] so looking at that message that i
[15:08] preached before on portals we we just
[15:12] sort of recap and on some of that we
[15:14] know that there are uh uh uh different
[15:17] dimensions of man
[15:19] and and and in this time and in this age
[15:22] there have been portals
[15:24] amen that have been open to those
[15:27] dimensions amen amen we're living in
[15:30] that time we look at uh what we talked
[15:32] about there on the days of enoch amen
[15:35] how enoch walked with god and he was
[15:38] transported amen to another
[15:41] amen dimension
[15:42] amen
[15:44] um
[15:45] and all of these kinds of things and uh
[15:47] how there's dimensions of science and
[15:51] light and time and matter amen but we're
[15:54] going to we're going to delve a little
[15:56] bit more into
[15:58] into uh into these things
[16:01] and uh looking at this set of scriptures
[16:03] we want to continue on here and from
[16:06] matthew 24 chapter
[16:08] amen uh
[16:10] 32-33
[16:12] it says here now learn the parable
[16:15] amen of the fig tree
[16:18] when this branch when his branch is yet
[16:20] tender and putteth forth leaves
[16:23] ye know that summer is nigh
[16:26] so likewise
[16:28] ye when ye shall see all these things
[16:33] know that
[16:34] it is near
[16:36] even at the doors now that word doors
[16:41] even at the doors is is is is in
[16:44] parallel to what i was talking about
[16:46] before these dimensions
[16:48] doors is is these dimensions these
[16:51] portals that allow you to enter
[16:55] into another room amen these are the
[16:58] entrances amen to another dimension amen
[17:04] so uh we want to look at that
[17:07] uh
[17:09] remember here that
[17:11] in studying that i looked at matthew
[17:14] chapter 24
[17:16] is the seventh seal of revelation six
[17:22] so it was written in prophecy form
[17:26] in matthew 24.
[17:28] now learn the parable of the fig tree
[17:30] is the nation of israel
[17:33] when his branches is yet tender and
[17:34] putting forth leaves we know that summer
[17:37] is nine
[17:38] this is israel as a young nation putting
[17:41] forth leaves and summertime is beginning
[17:45] of the harvest time
[17:47] amen and so this is the time period
[17:51] dispensationally of what we're living in
[17:55] now amen because the jews in 1948 have
[17:58] raised their flag and man declaring
[18:00] themselves the nation once again amen so
[18:03] it's yet tender amen but there is a time
[18:07] amen that the door will be shut and the
[18:11] gospel is going to go back to the jews
[18:14] so when we see that these things are
[18:16] happening that amen the fig trees
[18:18] putting forth bugs it says so likewise
[18:21] ye when ye shall see these things
[18:25] know that you are near or even at the
[18:28] door
[18:29] amen
[18:30] now we was the last couple of wizards we
[18:33] were talking about being able to see
[18:36] amen so talking about seeing these
[18:38] things amen and i'm so glad that the
[18:40] bride of jesus christ
[18:42] amen we were once blind but now we see
[18:45] we recognize where we're at amen we
[18:49] recognize that we're at the door amen so
[18:53] notice here he's speaking of more than
[18:56] one door
[18:57] amen the scriptures tells us that this
[19:00] time
[19:01] that we are
[19:02] at the doors many doors different doors
[19:06] give you choices
[19:10] i told myself i was going to calm down
[19:12] this princeton just kind of teach
[19:15] i don't know if it's in me
[19:18] amen
[19:19] different entrances that allow you
[19:22] access from one place
[19:25] to another
[19:26] amen that's right so 34
[19:30] says rarely i say unto you this
[19:32] generation shall not pass to all these
[19:34] things things be fulfilled
[19:36] heaven and earth
[19:38] shall pass away but my word
[19:41] shall not pass away
[19:43] but of that day
[19:45] and hour knoweth no man
[19:48] no not the angels of heaven
[19:50] but my father only
[19:54] but as the days of noah
[19:57] we're so
[19:58] uh
[19:59] we're so shall also the coming of the
[20:03] son of man
[20:04] be so
[20:07] now we
[20:08] we he begins to open up
[20:11] the mystery
[20:13] of the seventh seal
[20:15] because the seventh seal is connected to
[20:17] his coming
[20:19] he already told us that
[20:21] his coming would be as lightning that
[20:25] shining out of the evening
[20:28] it see it shall be light in the evening
[20:31] time
[20:32] amen for as in the days that we're
[20:36] before before the flood
[20:38] they were eating
[20:40] and drinking marrying giving in marriage
[20:42] until the day that noah entered into the
[20:45] ark
[20:47] how did noah enter the ark
[20:50] he entered the ark
[20:52] through a door
[20:54] and there was only one door amen to the
[20:57] yard
[20:58] and knew not until the when the flood
[21:01] came
[21:02] you see the parallels
[21:05] amen and took them all away
[21:09] so shall also the coming of the son of
[21:12] man be
[21:14] so when noah's day there was just one
[21:17] door
[21:18] of the ark
[21:20] was presented to the people
[21:22] uh for of that generation but we also
[21:25] know that there were other doors in noah
[21:29] day where people were given access to
[21:32] other things such as
[21:34] sin and unbelief
[21:36] they were given a choice
[21:38] amen to accept the message
[21:42] of the hour for that day or perish
[21:45] amen that's right so it says here in
[21:47] second peter the first chapter the 11th
[21:49] verse amen
[21:51] for so an entrance shall be ministered
[21:54] unto you
[21:56] abundantly into the everlasting kingdom
[21:59] of our lord and savior
[22:02] jesus christ
[22:03] this word entrance
[22:07] this word entrance
[22:08] means an act of entering it or doing
[22:12] word i mean it's a verb it's an action
[22:15] word that we do
[22:17] it's something we have to do
[22:19] hey man so
[22:20] uh uh i know a lot of we come out
[22:24] it's not by works
[22:26] and things of that nature
[22:28] just you know by faith and i believe you
[22:30] got to have faith
[22:31] you have to believe the word
[22:33] but you also got to do something right
[22:36] amen they could have sat out there at
[22:38] noor's day and said i believe and i have
[22:40] faith and i've accepted the message but
[22:42] never make the step
[22:45] to go into the art they still perish
[22:48] with their faith that's right
[22:50] see so there's always
[22:53] let nobody deceive you there's something
[22:55] that you have to do
[22:58] it may be ye doers of the word and not
[23:00] hearers only
[23:02] there's something you have to do amen it
[23:05] is an action word amen is uh uh it's not
[23:08] just
[23:09] a a mythical i just believe yeah i
[23:12] believe it i believe it i believe it but
[23:14] you also have to do something about what
[23:16] you believe
[23:18] amen
[23:19] so the door is an entrance into the
[23:22] everlasting kingdom of our lord and
[23:23] savior jesus christ
[23:25] is something as the scripture tells us
[23:28] here
[23:29] that is mis uh
[23:32] ministered
[23:33] to us and is like a key of faith that
[23:36] causes us to enter
[23:39] the ministry of the word is an entrance
[23:42] being ministered
[23:44] as it was in noah's message
[23:47] it was preached
[23:49] that caused those who believed his
[23:52] message
[23:52] to go through the door
[23:54] of the ark amen
[23:56] now
[23:58] brother branham preached a message
[24:01] amen preached on this message of doors
[24:04] amen many times
[24:05] throughout his ministry amen doors and
[24:08] doors and
[24:10] different ones it's just three or four
[24:12] five different messages i believe it was
[24:14] that he preached on doors and one
[24:17] throughout the message
[24:18] often connected to our personal life
[24:22] amen where we we are a building a man
[24:25] and in any building has doors and
[24:28] compartments and rooms
[24:30] amen believer in reference to doors
[24:33] indoors that the prophet preached there
[24:35] uh he would explain to us just inside
[24:37] your heart there are many doors
[24:39] just like a house or front entrance and
[24:42] in the room they have many doors within
[24:44] the house amen but with many doors give
[24:48] entrances into the room
[24:50] many people want jesus to come into the
[24:53] heart
[24:54] amen through the front door amen but
[24:56] don't want to allow him access to the
[24:59] other rooms
[25:00] amen
[25:01] amen so our heart amen should be open
[25:05] amen to to to to all that the word has
[25:09] to and to to him all our doors amen that
[25:12] he be lord of our house
[25:15] doors are also gives people entrance and
[25:18] access
[25:19] to whatever is beyond the door on the
[25:22] other side amen doors are used even
[25:26] importantly to keep people from entering
[25:29] amen
[25:30] so it is a a synonymous doors also to
[25:33] keep
[25:34] valuables safe right amen to keep people
[25:38] from entering places that we don't want
[25:40] them entering and man at night
[25:43] day time
[25:44] every time in this society and these
[25:46] days amen we lock our doors
[25:50] used to be a time you just have to lock
[25:52] them at night
[25:53] like them all the time now my wife's
[25:55] getting don't sit up in here with the
[25:56] door open
[25:57] unlock don't sit up in here lock them
[26:00] doors
[26:02] say baby i'm here i i know i'm glad
[26:05] you're here but lock that door
[26:08] doors give people entrance amen so
[26:12] amen
[26:13] we lock our car doors when we park them
[26:16] right amen lock our house doors
[26:19] amen are we reminded of a a a a bank
[26:23] vault amen is uh has uh huge doors with
[26:28] multiple huge steel pins a man that's
[26:31] to keep uh valuables safe
[26:35] amen
[26:36] see uh so uh uh there's another aspect
[26:40] of a door a door can be used to seal off
[26:42] great things of value
[26:45] so we are all familiar with doors and
[26:48] their uses and the scripture speaks of
[26:50] doors in many places in the bible we're
[26:53] going to take a look at one in genesis
[26:55] amen um
[26:58] we talked about noah here but i want to
[27:02] look at one here
[27:05] amen uh
[27:14] in in genesis here we we see that
[27:17] uh i want to find it here i'm kind of
[27:19] getting ahead of myself
[27:24] amen
[27:26] i'm sorry bear with me
[27:35] amen we look at genesis the sixth
[27:37] chapter i just continue going from where
[27:39] i'm at here
[27:40] amen genesis the sixth chapter the end
[27:43] of flesh uh it says and god said to noah
[27:46] the end of all flesh has come before me
[27:49] for the earth is filled with violence
[27:52] through them and behold i will destroy
[27:56] them which sit upon the earth make an
[27:58] ark of gopher wood room
[28:01] rooms shall be made in the ark and shall
[28:04] pitch
[28:04] it within and without and pitch with
[28:07] pitch
[28:09] and this is the fashion
[28:11] which thou shalt make it of the length
[28:14] of the ark
[28:15] shall be 300 cubits and the breath shall
[28:19] be 50 cubits and the height shall be 30
[28:21] cubits a window shall
[28:24] a window shall thou make in new york and
[28:27] in a cubit
[28:29] shall thou finish it above and a door
[28:33] of the ark shall thou set in the side
[28:36] thereof
[28:37] which uh with look with lower second and
[28:41] third stories shall thou make it and
[28:44] behold
[28:45] i even
[28:47] uh and behold i even
[28:49] i do bring a flood of waters upon the
[28:52] earth to destroy all flesh wherein
[28:55] is wherein is the breath of life
[28:59] from under the heaven and everything
[29:02] that is in the earth shall die
[29:05] amen so we find the door was associated
[29:07] with noah in the ark amen the door that
[29:10] god used to shut them
[29:12] uh up shut them with the people that
[29:15] believed the message of the hour amen
[29:18] the seventh and they went into noah's
[29:20] ark two by two all flesh
[29:23] where is the breath of life amen
[29:26] and they
[29:27] that went in
[29:29] went in male female of all flesh and god
[29:32] had commanded him
[29:34] the door to be shut amen we see that no
[29:37] man can open the door no man can shut
[29:39] the door amen and we've had a door open
[29:42] in our time amen but no man can shut
[29:46] that door amen
[29:48] so john
[29:49] uh 10 uh
[29:51] the 10th chapter the seventh verse says
[29:54] then jesus said unto him again verily
[29:56] verily i say unto you i am the door
[30:00] and the sheep
[30:01] i am he says i
[30:04] say unto you i am the door of the sheep
[30:07] amen all that ever came before me are
[30:11] thieves and robbers
[30:13] but the sheep did not hear them
[30:16] i am the door by me if any man enter in
[30:21] he
[30:22] shall be saved
[30:25] and shall go in
[30:26] and out and find
[30:29] pasture amen so we see here that john is
[30:32] referring uh jesus in the book of john
[30:35] they say he is the door amen christ is
[30:38] that door amen you must have a
[30:40] revelation amen to uh who he is in this
[30:44] hour amen for that door to have access
[30:46] to that door
[30:48] amen revelation 4 1
[30:50] after this door i looked and beheld
[30:53] after this i looked and beheld a door
[30:55] was open
[30:57] amen so here's where we get into the
[30:59] meat of it after this i looked and
[31:01] beheld this is john on the isle of
[31:03] patmos amen where he uh seen the visions
[31:06] and everything and he said he looked
[31:08] and he beheld a door was open in heaven
[31:12] amen and uh
[31:14] uh the
[31:15] first voice which i heard was as it were
[31:19] a trumpet
[31:21] talking with me which said come up
[31:24] hither
[31:25] and i will show you
[31:27] things which must be hereafter amen so
[31:31] he had to come up here there was a door
[31:34] open
[31:36] and he said come up hither
[31:38] so when we were speaking on last time
[31:40] about those dimensions we were talking
[31:42] about hearing these dimensions of mortal
[31:45] there is another door above us amen i
[31:49] should say above us we say above because
[31:52] it's just how it's in another dimension
[31:56] it is a place where the believers live
[31:59] in amen because we are potentially in
[32:03] the rapture now
[32:05] amen see our mind and our concept of
[32:08] living in life has is being changed and
[32:11] being transformed amen so through the
[32:14] revelation of the word of the hour we
[32:16] are living above lady ocean
[32:20] amen we are not of lady lucille because
[32:23] we are not blind we are not naked
[32:26] wretched and miserable and don't know it
[32:28] amen that is the i that's that's the
[32:31] condition of lady of seal
[32:33] i beg to differ with the bride we are
[32:35] not in ladies seal we are seated
[32:38] right in heavenly places
[32:41] amen so i was thinking in our activities
[32:44] and our actions and the things that we
[32:46] do the way this is why we're different
[32:51] people sometimes can't understand well
[32:53] why do you dress that way and why do you
[32:56] act that way and why do you do the
[32:58] things that you do because we're not
[33:00] living in the same room that you're
[33:03] living in
[33:05] amen the prophet has come amen that we
[33:08] have received an entrance the entrance
[33:11] has been ministered to us amen and we
[33:14] have not rejected it but we have
[33:16] received it and because of that by the
[33:19] holy ghost we have stepped through
[33:21] another door
[33:28] a door has been open
[33:30] amen when the seven seals amen in 63 the
[33:34] door was open
[33:35] amen and the message the entrance was
[33:37] preached amen
[33:39] a key was given amen and we have
[33:42] received that message and amen that we
[33:45] are doers of it
[33:47] amen we we we've taken off
[33:50] we've put on we've changed our
[33:52] activities
[33:54] amen now
[33:55] uh uh we live according to the word of
[33:58] god
[34:00] amen we live according to the word of
[34:02] god through a prophetic
[34:05] anointing
[34:06] amen that is the entrance amen that is
[34:09] the door that was open
[34:13] amen
[34:15] many ministries have doors open
[34:18] many ministries they they do the same
[34:21] thing they go to church
[34:22] and and they do things but just like we
[34:25] were saying before there's a door
[34:27] offered amen but they keep certain doors
[34:30] closed
[34:31] amen we'll we'll open the doors of the
[34:33] church and
[34:35] and we come and we feel good amen but
[34:38] they want to let them back in that back
[34:39] room
[34:43] all of the doors are wide open
[34:46] and the house is clean
[34:49] make yourself at home lord
[34:51] you are lord of all
[34:53] amen
[34:54] so we find ourselves in that condition
[34:58] i mean in this very hour and has raised
[35:00] us up together to seek in heavenly
[35:03] places in christ jesus
[35:05] says we also find in revelation 3
[35:08] that there was
[35:10] a door
[35:12] on the knocking and trying to get in
[35:15] because
[35:16] in the end time that ladies and age amen
[35:20] he was shut out
[35:22] of his own church
[35:25] by their creeds and dogmas of man's
[35:28] religion and the interpretation of the
[35:30] word
[35:31] you can't fellowship with god and
[35:34] disagree with his word at the same time
[35:39] you just can't do it
[35:41] amen
[35:43] you he says behold revelation 3 20 says
[35:45] behold i stand at the door
[35:48] and knock
[35:49] if any man hear my voice he will open
[35:52] that the door i will come in to him and
[35:56] will sup with him and he with me
[35:59] so notice what's happening here
[36:02] that the opening of the door is
[36:04] connected
[36:05] to the receiving of truth all right
[36:09] amen
[36:11] that uh that's what would have opened
[36:14] the door to christ for him to come in
[36:18] the receiving of truth
[36:20] amen
[36:21] so in john 5 it says search the
[36:23] scriptures for in them you think you
[36:25] have eternal life
[36:27] but they are they which testify of me
[36:31] amen
[36:33] and we
[36:34] will not come to me
[36:37] ye might have life
[36:39] i receive not honor from men
[36:42] but i know you that ye have not
[36:46] the love of god in you
[36:51] i am come in my father's name
[36:54] and ye receive me not
[36:58] if another shall come in his name in his
[37:01] own name
[37:02] you shall receive him
[37:08] not a prophet preached a message called
[37:10] blasphemous name
[37:13] so you won't receive he said i come in
[37:15] my name
[37:16] but you'll receive
[37:19] methodist baptists
[37:22] presbyterian
[37:23] this is what i am and this is what i am
[37:26] and you'll receive those
[37:28] names
[37:30] if they had received the truth of the
[37:32] message of this hour
[37:34] because that is who christ is in this
[37:37] day
[37:38] he is the mighty god
[37:41] unveiled and revealed to us by his own
[37:44] word that has been revealed in this hour
[37:48] amen
[37:49] now
[37:54] and i think i got something double
[37:56] printed here
[37:58] now in the process here genesis 4
[38:01] uh 3 7. genesis 4 3 3 i want you to take
[38:04] a look at something
[38:05] and in the process of time
[38:08] it came to pass
[38:10] that cain brought forth fruit of the
[38:12] ground
[38:14] an offering unto the lord
[38:17] and abel he also brought of the
[38:19] firstlings
[38:21] of his flock
[38:22] and of the fact thereof and the lord had
[38:25] respect unto abel and to his offering
[38:29] but unto
[38:30] cain but unto cain
[38:33] and to his offering he had not respect
[38:37] and cain was very roth
[38:39] and his countenance failed
[38:42] and the lord said unto cain why are they
[38:44] wroth and why is thy spirit why is thy
[38:48] countenance falling
[38:50] he was wrong because he wanted god to
[38:53] accept worship
[38:55] in the way that
[38:57] he
[38:58] chose to worship
[39:01] but god had only
[39:04] has one provided place of worship
[39:08] amen
[39:09] and one key will open that door
[39:12] amen
[39:14] so this is a type of the the world today
[39:19] of this day that who refuse the truth of
[39:22] the word of god
[39:24] for this hour fourth day
[39:27] for the doctrines of man
[39:30] if thou doest well
[39:33] thou shalt not
[39:35] thou shalt not be
[39:38] accepted if thou if thou doest swell
[39:41] shalt thou not be accepted it's a
[39:43] question
[39:44] and if out if thou doest not will
[39:48] sin
[39:49] lieth
[39:50] at the door
[39:52] amen
[39:53] so cain was offered a man
[39:57] an entrance into the door
[39:59] same way the people of noah's day was
[40:02] offered an entrance to the door
[40:04] the same way in this day people are
[40:06] offered an entrance amen to the door we
[40:10] see cain
[40:11] he was off at that entrance
[40:14] we see here that god's instruction to
[40:17] cain
[40:19] that if he submits to the word
[40:22] in humility
[40:24] then he would be accepted in other words
[40:26] the interest of grace and acceptance of
[40:29] god would open to him but if he rejects
[40:33] the counsel of god then other doors
[40:37] would be open to him were seeing life
[40:40] and so when cain rejected the door of
[40:44] truth
[40:46] god had offered to him
[40:48] a door of sin was opened yeah
[40:52] amen
[40:53] and a spirit
[40:56] come through that door
[40:59] a murderous spirit
[41:02] that caused him to slow
[41:04] kill his brother so we see
[41:08] that the same
[41:10] oak that rejecting the door
[41:14] of the opening of the word
[41:16] will also cause you you're gonna look
[41:21] you're going through a door
[41:22] [Laughter]
[41:24] yeah
[41:25] glory
[41:26] you might as well accept the door that
[41:30] god has opened to you for safety
[41:32] and the revelation of truth because if
[41:36] not you have opened up another door
[41:42] amen where demon experience would
[41:45] bombard you
[41:48] when you reject the door that god has
[41:51] offered you that's it that's exactly
[41:53] right now we're living in that time my
[41:55] brothers and sisters
[41:56] we see that this is this is going with
[41:59] when the when the people it us they
[42:01] rejected that door
[42:04] the only other door that was open to
[42:06] them was
[42:08] death right
[42:10] and when cain rejected truth
[42:13] refused to walk through that door
[42:16] because he wanted to worship in his own
[42:19] way
[42:22] that's right
[42:23] there was another door open
[42:27] a spirit
[42:29] had entered into him
[42:31] that caused him to murder his brother
[42:36] what a terrible spirit
[42:38] don't think for one minute
[42:42] that the rejection of the word
[42:44] in this hour
[42:46] won't
[42:48] bring the same results
[42:50] you may not murder with a knife
[42:54] you may not shoot your brother with a
[42:55] gun
[42:56] but every time you reject the word of
[42:59] the hour what you murder with
[43:01] your tongue
[43:03] every time
[43:05] you reject the word of god they go
[43:06] around murdering
[43:08] with their tongue
[43:10] trying to kill a man's influence
[43:14] what is it
[43:15] a devil has entered into you
[43:20] talking about these this this is real
[43:21] folks
[43:22] i don't know if this being preached
[43:24] anywhere else this is real life to open
[43:27] people's eyes to
[43:29] to to not what our physical eyes can see
[43:33] for these things are temporal
[43:35] these things have passed away but there
[43:37] is another dimension that we are living
[43:40] in that is more real than this dimension
[43:43] that we see touch taste smell feel
[43:49] that is more real
[43:51] amen
[43:53] let me read here uh
[43:56] from the message
[43:58] preached in 1953 oh 6 15

[49:52] amen
[49:53] amen sickness lies at the door
[49:57] amen and another message here a door in
[50:00] the door tucson arizona 630223
[50:06] paragraph 106. he said many
[50:08] great people has knocked at doors down
[50:12] through life
[50:13] now a whole lot of it depends on after
[50:16] depends
[50:17] after you go to the door who it is
[50:19] knocking
[50:21] you go to you you go you got to know who
[50:25] that is doing the knocking
[50:31] but you should at least go to the door
[50:34] that's the only decent thing to do is to
[50:36] find out who's there at the door
[50:39] go there if somebody's knocking and say
[50:41] who is it open the door
[50:43] who are you
[50:44] what do you wish
[50:46] oh many uh
[50:48] that was back in his day now you look
[50:50] through the peephole and holler what you
[50:52] want
[50:53] you know
[50:55] open those in this day now
[50:57] um
[50:59] many might be uh some great person
[51:02] what if it's a great person
[51:06] it'd be a great honor to you
[51:09] to open the door for some body uh that
[51:13] was a great somebody
[51:15] amen that great person
[51:18] so he is speaking there
[51:21] in the scripture of revelation 3 20
[51:23] because christ is the greatest person
[51:26] that there could ever be
[51:28] amen behold i stand at the door and
[51:30] knock amen
[51:32] so this is speaking of the age that
[51:34] we're living in
[51:36] this is the only way this is the this is
[51:39] also the same period of time of when the
[51:42] jews are back to their homeland and the
[51:45] fig tree putting forth its buds as in
[51:48] our opening scripture in matthew 24.
[51:51] now uh remember the same holy spirit
[51:54] that was performing miracles and
[51:56] healings and discernments
[51:58] in brother branham's day
[52:00] is the is bringing us to the truth of
[52:03] this day because the healing of our body
[52:06] brings temporal healing
[52:09] to your temporal body but the truth of
[52:11] the words bring eternal relationship
[52:14] with god
[52:16] the revealed opens a door to god's
[52:19] eternal day
[52:21] amen
[52:24] philadelphia church age
[52:27] it is
[52:28] to this church age
[52:30] that jesus said
[52:32] behold uh i come quickly
[52:35] that makes the last age very short
[52:38] ladies
[52:40] is the age
[52:41] of a quick work
[52:43] it'll cut short
[52:45] now we will specifically dwell on the
[52:49] open door that no man can shut here in
[52:52] the philadelphia church age he says
[52:54] first of all
[52:56] i want to dwell on this door as
[52:59] signifying the tremendous missionary
[53:02] efforts of the age of paul
[53:04] paul called a new missionary endeavor
[53:08] for the lord an open door
[53:11] amen furthermore when i come to
[53:14] uh
[53:16] choice
[53:17] to preach christ's
[53:19] gospel a door was open unto me
[53:23] okay
[53:24] amen so we see
[53:25] uh that the comparison of the scripture
[53:28] that this open door signifies the
[53:31] greatest spreading of the gospel the
[53:33] world has ever seen
[53:35] amen i want to i want you to see
[53:38] something here
[53:39] god works in threes amen
[53:42] he on the third pergamos church age
[53:46] that the church was married to the state
[53:50] the deeds of the nickelodeism and become
[53:53] a doctrine of nicolaiticism that age was
[53:57] the open door to the false vine
[54:01] once it had backed up by the power of
[54:04] the state
[54:06] it became actually a world
[54:08] system
[54:09] even
[54:10] though it bore the name christian thus
[54:13] it spread like wildfire amen
[54:17] but now
[54:19] three ages later
[54:21] after a after long a hard struggle of
[54:25] faith here comes the open door of truth
[54:28] amen we are living in the age right now
[54:32] of that open door
[54:34] amen of
[54:36] truth we see my brothers and sisters
[54:39] through all these examples
[54:41] amen and there's there's many
[54:43] many more he says uh uh uh in the
[54:47] scripture there
[54:49] uh
[54:53] ask
[54:54] and you shall receive
[54:57] seek
[54:58] and ye shall find
[55:00] knock
[55:01] and the door shall be opened unto you
[55:05] amen i want to stretch to you my
[55:06] brothers and sisters
[55:09] that there is a door of truth
[55:12] and you must walk through that door
[55:15] the danger
[55:16] in rejecting that door
[55:19] is that there is another door presented
[55:21] to you
[55:24] there is a danger in rejecting that door
[55:27] many people
[55:29] come and they sit up under the word
[55:31] visitors and different ones it is a
[55:34] dangerous thing
[55:36] to reject the message in this hour
[55:39] spirits are real
[55:40] and they're subtle
[55:43] and they're subtle
[55:44] we look at the crime around the world
[55:46] they're just full of violence and
[55:49] people have seemed to have just
[55:54] lost their mind
[55:56] seem sane
[55:58] but there are spirits that have entered
[56:01] i want to stress don't reject this word
[56:05] for rejecting you're not
[56:07] you're not
[56:08] rejecting me
[56:11] you're not rejecting me
[56:13] you're rejecting man you're rejecting
[56:16] the word
[56:17] of the hour
[56:20] you're rejecting the word of the hour
[56:23] and that's a dangerous thing and it's
[56:24] not uh at the beginning we talked about
[56:26] how uh we are at the door
[56:31] when the when the jews recognize who
[56:33] they are
[56:34] amen when they begin to recognize and
[56:37] res
[56:38] the door going to be shut i made a
[56:40] comment to a brother not too long ago i
[56:42] say it may not be closed but it is
[56:43] closing
[56:46] time is short
[56:48] time is short
[56:50] amen
[56:51] uh
[56:52] here in james the fifth chapter of the
[56:54] seventh verse is be patient thereof
[56:56] brethren unto the coming of the lord
[56:58] behold the husbandman
[57:00] waiteth for the precious fruit on the
[57:02] earth
[57:03] and had long patience
[57:06] for it until he received
[57:09] the early
[57:10] and latter rain
[57:12] be ye also patient establish your hearts
[57:15] for the coming of the lord draweth now
[57:18] grudge not
[57:20] one against the other brethren let ye be
[57:24] lest ye be condemned behold
[57:27] judge standeth
[57:30] at the door
[57:31] amen
[57:33] so we see
[57:35] that
[57:36] the rejection of that door
[57:38] always brought judgment
[57:41] the rejecting of that open door always
[57:45] brought judgment amen so we pray amen
[57:48] that
[57:49] somebody amen
[57:51] receive something
[57:53] amen from the word
[57:55] i want to stress that
[57:57] that
[57:58] there are many open doors we see that
[58:00] doors uh open into other dimensions amen
[58:03] one of the things that in my study that
[58:05] i was looking at one of the things that
[58:06] the prophet always says say when he's
[58:08] healing people and people come with
[58:11] spirits and he's casting out spirit he
[58:13] always say bow your head and close your
[58:15] eyes why do you think that is
[58:19] why do you think that is amen because
[58:21] those spirits are looking for somewhere
[58:24] amen and and and you want to see it's
[58:27] it's
[58:28] i want to see i want to see what
[58:29] happened i want to see what happened bow
[58:30] your head and close your eyes
[58:33] because we don't want to be a receptacle
[58:35] for that spirit
[58:38] a lot of times with the scripture he's
[58:39] healing um blinded eyes and death fears
[58:42] he said now death is says says i have a
[58:45] quote here he says that that's a
[58:47] different because they can't hear you
[58:50] so he has to enter into that world
[58:53] amen for that person to have faith to
[58:56] open the deaf ears he has to enter into
[58:59] that world they're in another world
[59:02] they can't hear they live in another
[59:04] world
[59:06] so he has to be able to enter into that
[59:09] world amen to be able to deliver that
[59:13] person
[59:14] there are dimensions
[59:17] all around us
[59:19] amen but we are living in he told us to
[59:22] come up hither
[59:24] in our in our thinking in our actions
[59:27] come up hither and i will show you
[59:29] things to come
[59:30] we're living in a different age

[1:00:22] park and my wife wasn't real satisfied

[1:07:52] uh my thought was like
[1:07:54] if if i were living that day and saw a
[1:07:56] man being building a boat that big
[1:07:59] i think i want to try to get home
[1:08:01] uh you know and uh you know the number
[1:08:04] of years that it took in the building
[1:08:06] then even all the animals that were
[1:08:07] coming
[1:08:08] to get on the boat
[1:08:10] those are signs that people should have
[1:08:12] just kind of look they should have known
[1:08:14] god was doing something
[1:08:15] uh but unfortunately people rejected it
[1:08:18] and uh it opened them up to another door
[1:08:20] and that was a door
[1:08:22] of death uh so i tell you we don't want
[1:08:25] to miss this hour this this the
[1:08:26] scripture says i have set before thee an
[1:08:28] open door and that open door is nothing
[1:08:31] but the reveal word uh in this hour
[1:08:34] uh i was uh
[1:08:36] just going to quickly share with you all
[1:08:38] just a couple of testimonies we when we
[1:08:40] went there to uh indiana i just
[1:08:42] felt to
[1:08:43] take a couple sermons uh with me and uh
[1:08:46] one of them was uh hurt people hurt
[1:08:48] people
[1:08:49] and uh and i knew that that would be a
[1:08:52] uh
[1:08:53] that's a sermon that kind of uh really
[1:08:55] get to the core
[1:08:57] but i said you know lord this is what
[1:08:58] you put in my heart so i'm just gonna
[1:09:00] kind of go forth with it and and i got a
[1:09:02] couple different testimonies that come
[1:09:04] back one was particular brother
[1:09:07] that um
[1:09:09] he randomly listens to services you know
[1:09:14] the stream services he
[1:09:16] his family goes to the church but he
[1:09:18] doesn't really like to go too much he
[1:09:20] let the wife and the kids go but he
[1:09:22] doesn't really like to go
[1:09:23] um and his primary reason for not going
[1:09:26] is because he's going to church and been
[1:09:27] hurt so many times so here you know come
[1:09:30] preaching this sermon her people hurt
[1:09:32] people and
[1:09:34] his wife you know makes it home after
[1:09:36] service and and and pretty much he meets
[1:09:39] her at the door
[1:09:40] and he says what a service
[1:09:43] what a service and like you know that
[1:09:45] that sermon that that brother just
[1:09:46] preached oh my goodness what a service
[1:09:49] you know and he was just on fire from
[1:09:53] the word of god a word of truth being uh
[1:09:55] spoken to him so i'm praying
[1:09:57] god will continue to work that he
[1:09:59] started and bring healing
[1:10:01] to his hurting heart
[1:10:03] you know there was another testimony
[1:10:05] someone sent me today and i thought i
[1:10:07] would be able to read it to you but i
[1:10:08] guess my phone is the battery's drained
[1:10:11] and i can't read it but
[1:10:13] the the gist of it there was a sister
[1:10:15] that was trying to come to service and
[1:10:17] she said every time
[1:10:19] um that we come to visit she's not able
[1:10:21] to be there in service because sickness
[1:10:23] attacks you know somebody in her family
[1:10:26] so she was very disappointed
[1:10:28] that she wasn't able to come to church
[1:10:30] and she says you know i i just
[1:10:32] uh she said she saw sister bird singing
[1:10:35] and the song that sister birds uh sang
[1:10:38] just really began to get her attitude
[1:10:40] adjusted
[1:10:41] and uh so she began to go from
[1:10:43] complaining to just thanking god that
[1:10:45] she had the ability just to stream
[1:10:47] and uh you know lord i think and they
[1:10:49] had just done some some work at the
[1:10:52] church add some extra cameras and and uh
[1:10:55] it used to be a time where a person
[1:10:56] would sing and the camera would not pick
[1:10:58] the person up because of the the angle
[1:11:02] but they've added a new camera so now
[1:11:03] they can pick up the singer and and she
[1:11:05] says oh
[1:11:06] i wasn't able to go to service but not
[1:11:08] me but at least see
[1:11:10] you know the the people so i can see
[1:11:12] sister bird singing so she was just
[1:11:13] really really uh blessed by that so she
[1:11:15] said i come out and and i read my
[1:11:18] scriptures and say well i know exactly
[1:11:19] what sermon he can ready to preach
[1:11:21] because she had been watching all the
[1:11:24] services
[1:11:25] prior to us getting there
[1:11:27] uh she watched all three parts of her
[1:11:30] people hurt people
[1:11:31] and uh she said i know what he can
[1:11:32] repeat to say lord i don't know what
[1:11:34] you're gonna say but i know you got you
[1:11:35] got something for me to hear you know
[1:11:38] and now she said that's the word just
[1:11:39] kind of went forth she said at the end
[1:11:41] of the service she made her living room
[1:11:44] an altar
[1:11:46] and she just began to just pray and just
[1:11:48] say lord i i know that there are some
[1:11:50] things that i i i thought i might have
[1:11:52] forgiven this person and i thought i
[1:11:54] might have forgiven that person but god
[1:11:56] i want to lay it all out here on the
[1:11:58] altar
[1:11:59] and she'd say when she got it from that
[1:12:01] altar she was free
[1:12:04] praise god
[1:12:12] you know and then that's for anyone
[1:12:14] that's that's streaming the service if
[1:12:15] you would just just enter in right where
[1:12:17] you are
[1:12:18] god can do the things that he wants to
[1:12:20] do amen in your life so
[1:12:23] uh i mean just that uh
[1:12:25] uh the day that you hear his voice heart
[1:12:28] not your heart
[1:12:29] a man heart not your heart so just just
[1:12:32] you know we thank god to be able to go
[1:12:33] and just um just hear the different
[1:12:35] testimonies you know from from different
[1:12:37] ones that we're sharing
[1:12:39] and um
[1:12:40] you know that's what makes it worthwhile
[1:12:42] worthwhile when you see a heart that has
[1:12:44] been uh touched amen somebody's life has
[1:12:48] been blessed you know then it makes it
[1:12:50] it certainly makes it worthwhile
[1:12:52] uh so we thank the lord um
[1:12:55] i know that we don't have the ability to
[1:12:57] just show this tonight we'll figure out
[1:12:59] that but uh quickly i know that a couple
