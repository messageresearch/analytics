ably as brother Christopher Samuel movie celebrating a birthday on Saturday the 11th Amen God forgive him on summer another year we had just a little malfunction with our slide on Wednesday night but I'm glad that you all came for 9 o'clock and a man we also have a 12 o'clock service but I think there's a little confusion thoughts are all gonna be one service but we're still doing the exact same thing we have been doing all along and now that's a 9:00 a.m. service and a 12:00 p.m. service on Sundays we'll continue to do that and a man until we see things change I know that many are just kind of ramping up efforts to get everything open regard it's the consequences it more cases and everything that's just kind of coming out of nowhere and not really sure what's what's triggering all but we want to just keep everybody safe and they Mabel sort of continue to do what we have been doing so also Wednesday nights we will be doing our service virtually as well so keep that in mind this this some Friday night I want to do a testimony service but we'll do it virtually now understand by doing it virtually no I don't know why I just keep losing [Music] I'm great or a man maybe just lower me a little bit of something and I'm just losing my connection here but um the as we're doing this virtually I need to just make sure everybody knows that you're you're on your computer or your telephone I pad or whatever and and we can see you you can see us so make sure that when you're doing things virtually that you're dressed appropriately praise the Lord so much dress differently at home and that's your house a mystery but but uh but but but just know you go Oh live on camera please you know act like I'm at your house praise the Lord you ever say Amen glory to God me get up and have the

somebody we don't want no embarrassing moments so amen just need to remind people you are online you online it's a camera there on your phone so so we just want you to just be careful that but we want to I'll be sending out the link Amen for everyone to be able to get on when I've sent it out this week so you'll have access to that but we're looking forward to just fellowship around if you have something that you'd like to share something Laura's daughter use especially during this season supper law stuff if you got something want to share it and please make sure you get to me so we could

and after that I'd like to give you an update on our building fund father we thank you for this opportunity we have to give to you as you have given to us we trust Oh God that you would Lord you be magnified and glorified and all that we do thank you Lord for your steady hand and providing for us through the midst of these troublesome times you have proven God to be Jehovah Jireh and God we as we cheerfully just bring our tithes and offering to the house to the Lord God we pray that you would just bless amen I don't we set our hands to do and may you use it for the furthest of your kingdom here on earth it's in Jesus name that we pray amen and amen praise Lord also I didn't want to thank everyone for their contributions towards some of the upgrades that we want to do with our sound the Lord has blessed a man I think we we have purchased there was a list that I saw that brother Quentin wrote and we might have had about seven or eight things on that list that we want to purchase and I want to say seven of the eight have been purchased already and then there is one last thing that we desire to do and and that is one additional microphone that actually is a clip own we got a be a blessed of brother Troy Troy stick it up here like this brother Quentin was sending text last week's like please tell brother Troy to pick up the mic brother you know so we got we got get a clip-on right but but the the type of clip-on mic that we were we had a couple that we about and and we when we bought them they just didn't last long we went the inexpensive route let's just put it at when they just didn't last long so this time we really want to get a good microphone and it will cost us you know that's why I said it's about four thousand dollars for all these things that we're gonna purchase but the the microphones are lasting and it's roughly about eight hundred dollars for this microphone that we're looking to get so that's the last thing that we want to purchase and after that I mean the cameras that we want it they're here we'll just need to install them there's some other things that we had to do that there's some new software that you all might not recognize yet but as we're as you're seeing the words on the screen that's new software because we upgraded the computer and then the software that we were using didn't working him over the upgrades so we had to buy some new software in order to get that get it back to where it was now we can add new songs and things like that so we you know we believe we've accomplished a lot this piano was accomplished and and I looked at all all this checklist something like Lord in the midst of a pandemic my God thank you Jesus so you know III know if God did all that he'll take care of the microphone as well so that that's our desire just to get the microphone and like I said it's about $800 and that's it a man for right now and our plan is to take all this into this new building that God got for us amen praise the Lord let me just give you an update on the building fund drive a man as to where we are and God is good to us God is good last year I'm sorry last month we receive donations of two thousand forty seven dollars a man for the building from donations of two thousand forty seven dollars and with that it has pushed us closer to our goal our goal was one hundred and five thousand dollars per year a man our pledges that came in towards that goal was sixty thousand nine dollars that those were the pledges and then what has been received year-to-date is seventeen thousand one hundred ninety two dollars and nine cent praise the Lord for that thank you Jesus and we also has still been gaining interest not much but we're still getting positive interest and and that's we've accumulated $276 an 8-cent on the interest and which just gives us a net because i I might you know I I just thank God that we haven't had to use all this time that we've been using it's been saving for the building for him we have not had to use one dollar towards amen our normal bills and god bless you and i believe that's because the the saints have a revelation there's three types of giving there's a man tithing that God requires of us he said give us give 10% of our earnings and we do that we don't sell chicken a man we don't wash cars we don't do anything we just pay our tithes and our offering and and those two separate things right so tithing is 10% offering is whatever you want to give to God right and because you have a embrace tithing and offering we have not had to borrow any money from the building fund in order to pay our normal normal bills God has been meeting that need every every every month and the other thing that God did at the beginning of this year I was I used to come and tell you how we we behind a little bit we've about three weeks behind on paying our rent but God has shifted it now we like two weeks ahead roll some lorry now wait knowing us now we walking up with the cheque in our hand and glory to God we'll see you next month God willing hallelujah no no and I'm glad about that I'm glad about that but on the other side with what we pay in rent I know we can afford a mortgage and my my faith is on the line that God is gonna provide for us a man of mortgage so thus far this year a man seventeen thousand four hundred sixty eight dollars and seventeen cents for our building fund and that's again that's for this year you all are aware that we have money from you know 2018-2019 and now in 2020 we voted on a three year plan and we at the end of this year that that's what we voted on so that's where we'll stop and God gonna do the rest amen you just do what you commit it to the Lord to do and then let God do the rest hallelujah amen that to me all this is positive a man hallelujah a man will praise the Lord all right well I that concludes that thank you musicians a man thank you very much we will prepare to go into the word of the Lord on today a man let me let me invite you to stand to your feet we'll just read a couple scriptures praise the Lord this morning thank you Jesus okay all right give me a second here something I want to do a little different today if the Lord would allow Swee are still in our journey a man here in catching the vision and you know I'm just picking up just a pretty much paragraph by paragraph as the angel Lord laid it out and I'm trying to gather inspiration on the on the on the various paragraphs so I thought it was very remarkable there's a quote that I'll read today that I believe connects very well with our American history and being that July 4th was just yesterday and Independence Day and things of that nature made me celebrate their independence and I thought that there was something that was very in the end in the prophecy there's something that just kind of connected and I what I plan to do today is it's just taking the time I just thought I got a number of notes so I won't rush through it a man but if whatever I don't finish I'm gonna preach the second service and finish it up in the second service so just bear with me a man on today and we just trust that the Lord will get all the glory and all the honor Amen from this so let's let's read from first Kings chapter 16 Amen first Kings chapter 16 and i'ma start reading at verse 29 Amen on this praise God alright it says it in a thirty an eighth year of ASA king of Judah began a have the son of Omri to reign over Israel and they have the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria 20 and two years and they have the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the Lord above all that were before him and it came to pass as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of eath bel king of the sidonians and went and served bel and worshipped him and he reared up an altar for belle in the house of bel which he had built in samaria have made a grove and they have dit more to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him a man my god what a I can't call it a legacy but what you know what statements are made by about this man amen as a leader so we want to just use that as our basis a man on today and I want to use a title of history is repeating itself a man history is repeating itself let's pray a man over the word of the Lord today father we thank you for your word God we thank you also for a prophet that had the ability to go into Scripture and show us things that we would probably never even look at God we are we're grateful that we could Fellowship around this this truth in this hour and my prayers that you would just give us revelation give us inspiration give us truth O God and for we all know the truth and the truth is is what sets us free so god take complete control over this portion of the service and may you get all the glory and all the honor from our gathering here those that are online speak to them right where they are minister to every heart into every meet god is our prayer it's in jesus name that we pray amen amen god bless you praise the Lord so we want to use a man for our title again history is repeating itself and if you just bear with me a little bit we want to just kind of take our journey through some things here the Prophet told us let's start a man in the sermon the rejected King a man this sermon the rejected King the Prophet makes this statement says there is not a man there is no son of Kish or no one else that can produce no one else can produce that outside of the leadership of the Holy Spirit but we have made schools we have made seminaries made organizations to satisfy and to look like the rest of the world now the Holy Spirit used to be the leader in this nation I liked the Holy Spirit used to be the leader in this nation you you it's impossible for people to still claim that we are a Christian nation amen we're no longer Christian nation with some of the things that we have done some of the laws that we have passed make us non-christian if we were a Christian nation we would still be following the principles of Scripture Christians follow Christ Jesus Christ and if we're not following his teachings we cannot call ourselves a Christian nation amen what what it is is that we're trying we're trying a man stand on what God did for the forefathers and God did some great things for the forefathers but it's a different day now and what I want I want you to understand God don't have grandchildren a man God has sons and daughters hallelujah glory to God so he says he says this that the the Holy Spirit used to be the leader in this nation this nation used to be governed hallelujah went back when they rode up the Declaration of Independence and there was an extra chair sitting there there is not one speck of doubt in my mind but what the Son of God said at the table there hallelujah a man he said sat at a table when this nation was founded upon the principles of freedom of religion hallelujah amen that God God was so a man particular about the u.s. being what it is that he had as he he had a very he had its very presence at the time that they were set out signing the Declaration of Independence I remember someone saying that on the $2 bill if you ever get one of those you can look on the $2 bill there was one man in the room with a hat on his head a man nobody else had a hat on his head and I believe they say I believe that was God Himself standing there trying to make sure that this nation became what it is today Oh hallelujah hallelujah glory glory glory even scripture speaks about this nation revelation 13 talks about this nation so it was very important for us a man to be established because the word there was promises in scripture that was written about this nation there's a lot of things that have happened in the nation that we're not happy with we're not we don't agree with but yet there were scripture promises that this nation would be a nation all right glory let's look at this he says uh-oh something that what the Son of God said in the table when this nation was founded upon the principles of freedom of religion and freedom to all hallelujah amen and upon the basis of God's eternal world word but we have corrupted that it was established on these things but we have corrupted that politics we have voted man in there on the buying and selling and promises of falsehood and one politician being able to keep his promise yes hallelujah not all of them but but here it says promises are for sir until our nation and our politics and our democracy is so polluted its into woven with communism and all kinds of isms we used to think we were democracy but it's in two woven Amen with communism and all kinds of isms the Prophet said this 1960 look he says in many times we call in two sessions for prayer when leagues of Nations meet in there to have discussions and in one great one great time recently there was not even one time called for prayer how are we ever gonna settle differences without pray we ain't got nothing fix until we get back on our knees and began to pray hallelujah glory God if my people which are called by my name will humble themselves and pray seek my face and it does not stop their turn praise God turn from your wicked ways then will I hear from heaven they will forgive their sins they will heal the land that's what we were built on hallelujah that's what made America America Jesus we don't have to get back to pride George Washington didn't even fight battles until he prayed praise God my god Mike hallelujah glory glory glory how are we ever gonna settle differences without prayer how can we ever expect in all the world to ever do anything without the leadership of the Holy Spirit he says well let me say this with love and respects to our nation and to his flag and to the Republic for which it stands hallelujah glory one nation under God praise God II may mean today people confuse it they like what which God cuz there's so many different gods see you know because of our freedom of religion a lot of other religions I've been able to come into amen this land and just kind of do some of the things that they want to do right a lot of other religions and now people confused about which God that they serve if you want to know which god that our forefathers was talking about go back to the Bible cuz that's what they established things on Scripture they not confused about which God they were they were serving go back to the Bible you'll find that with God they were serving hallelujah when they wrote these things one nation under God they talked about the God of the Bible all right all right all right hallelujah it man it says now let me say this with love and respects to our nation and to his flag and to the Republic for which it stands we have rejected leader the Holy Spirit and through corrupt politics have brought in men a perverse mind and if you don't watch they're gonna make one of the most fatal mistakes they've ever made they've ever made right now is because that the people are desiring man to rule oh can I just you know I'm just preaching what the Prophet said right Amen we desire man through no man I don't care who he is can't be our savior hallelujah everybody no matter which party goes into I'm not putting my faith in no party I put my faith in the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah the man got one Christian principle hallelujah maybe do one Christian thing and everybody thinks something greater this man he do all this other wickedness come on somebody and we overlook the wickedness amen we are not a Christian nation hallelujah oh my god a man just got saved yesterday I'm running for president today give him time to prove itself boom is Christianity glory to God I got the same thing see you know let me just read let me just read I I'll get so far ahead of myself let me just reach I want to say some good things because brother Branham brother Branham said in order to be America American I have to be identified with a glory and with a shame it says I was identified with George Washington he was fighting the British he says I was identified with Paul Revere when he read he started yelling the British are coming the British are coming amen and he made a statement I believe no Patrick Henry I think the one that made the statement give me liberty or give me death he says I was identified with those men I was identified with Abraham Lincoln praise God when he said no I said God made man man mace they say one day by God's grace I'm gonna hit that thing huh and he hit it pretty Scott he lost his life because he hit it amen but I'm identified with Abraham Lincoln hallelujah amen brother Brant said we identified with when they went to Guam and they hoisted the fact the flag up on Guam those those soldiers went battling just trying to claim some territory he says I'm identify with them a man I'm identify with every negative thing that has happened in this country praise Lord slavery I'm identify with it amen I don't agree with it but I'm identify with him hallelujah when they drove up the occupants the Indians I didn't agree with him identify with him amen brother random culture rama mo a hero come on somebody hallelujah he was just fighting for his principle fighting for the land that God had given him nothing wrong with that I'm identify with Geronimo Lou yeah hallelujah I'm identified with many of the things he said but in order to be a Christian I gotta be identified with all the Bible characters it says I'm identified with with Moses when he crossed the Red Sea says I'm identified with the the Hebrew boys when they overcame the fire in the furnace Amen I'm identify with dying well with Daniel when he defeated the Lions in the team I'm identified with David when he when Ireland defeated Goliath come on somebody he says I'm identified with Jesus when he went to the cross Amen I'm identified in his death I'm identified in his burial but I'm also identified in his resurrection praise God in order to be a Christian you must be identified with the resurrection glory to God even though the Christian principles that we still owe a man I'm identified with our glory and her shame the called myself an American I got to be identified a man I can't erase history like it did not happen these things did occur they may enter and it's good to teach history that way history won't have us a strange way of repeating itself alright I'm identified with some of the patriotic songs that have been created here in this land of the USA hallelujah and and recently we were at home just going through YouTube and just looking at a whole bunch of different people singing the national anthem good God Almighty we stumbled upon BeBe Winans and BeBe Winans start singing you know the national anthem I can't even think of the words right now I should have printed them out oh say can you see by the dawn's early light and what so proudly we hailed by the twilight's last gleaming and the Rockets red glare something bursting in air gave proof through the night that was written amen out of some real perilous times it was a war going on it and when their people just woke up the next morning and saw all this a man they say oh you know oh say can you see meant something to them hallelujah glory to God but you know so so you know hey that get that what's that okay bursting in air gave proof through the night that our flag was still there oh say does that star-spangled banner yet wave and and and i'ma tell you I listen to them when they start getting to that Park for the land of the free but you got to hit it and the home of the Braves bring it home praise God hey man it'll be me wine has got a hold it at the people just mesmerized they was sitting there cuz he's not here oh he done made it gospel tour as he made it gospel day like one fella just put his hands up like he was in church my guts hallelujah but if something bout them soul a man as an American I'm identified with it I'm identified with the glory in the shake praise God I wonder one of the ladies just couldn't stop it just hey is lifted I are we in church now they don't took that and took a patriotic song and made it gospel my God my God hallelujah but there's another one that just blesses my heart amen and I'm identified oh Beautiful for spacious skies for amber waves of grain purple mountains Majesties above the fruited plain AMERICA AMERICA God shed His grace on thee and Crown thy good with Brotherhood from sea to shining sea those words were wrote in 1911 amen and it was from a lady by the name of Katherine Lee Bates and she penned this song she actually had three different revisions and that's the final revision of the song and the way the lady got the inspiration to write the song she took a train ride from Massachusetts to Colorado Springs and as she just looked over the land Amen because you're going to different areas of the US and and it's just it's a lot different here we don't have no mountains but to get out of some of these other place you see the beautiful mountains and a man you get all the way over to California see whether mount to meet the ocean hallelujah amen there's some beautiful places in America and as the lady was just driving I mean driving on a train she say inspiration just struck her she just began to pin verse by verse what beautiful America was all about but she never actually found a tune for it she just had a poem that she wrote hallelujah and she published a poem on July 4th Amen I forget which year but was published in this say it was the poem was initially published two years later in the Congregationalists to commemorate the fourth of July and it quickly caught the public's fancy mine and another lap then the music came by it was composed by a man who was a church organist and a choir master Amen his name was Samuel a ward he was part of the Grace Episcopal Church in Newark New Jersey the two people never even met the lady that wrote the poem and the man that wrote the music neither one of those these two people met but yet their music came together his her lyrics and his music came together and it created this great patriotic song III appreciate moments like that and I hear I appreciate I appreciate it I appreciate it but I want to just say history's repeating itself there was a prophecy given over the land of America in 1787 by this gentleman his name was Alex Tyler he was a Scottish history professor at the University of Edinburgh and at the time of America's birth he wrote a warning to America in 1787 he says he observed that the average age of the world's greatest civilizations was about 200 years and during that during which they inevitably progress through the following sequence and this is where we are they start from bondage to faith hallelujah amen and when we think about some of my forefathers that couldn't worship and freedom there in Europe they were they came here to America so that could worship some of the Quakers and things like that they left there where they've been persecuted for their style of worship they came here for freedom of worship a man sort of go from bondage to faith but then they go from faith to courage when they were fighting for this land fighting for our independence that faith to courage to fight a man and from courage didn't they go to Liberty Liberty they will liberate it because they actually fought right and they're from Liberty they go to abundance and we've seen that a man here in the land of America when they go from abundance they then they go to a place of complacency and what complacency is it's self-satisfaction now I want to just read a quote I want to I'll stop it that abundance too complacent but I'll come back in and read a little bit more hey man I want to read a quote from the sudden secret going away of the church all right the Prophet says this so now that's the way the church ought to be watching for the coming of the Lord all in order already all packed up and ready to go as soon as it comes because it'll be in a moment in a twinkling of an eye just try to time longer would take your out of twinkle that's just how quick the rapture the church will take place you know that enemy always uses the tactics that the Lord uses you know when he's seeing that God was going to have a righteous church and the things that he was going to do the enemy used that same strategy look at this he's got a church he's got a people that's very religious hallelujah and they're just right on the toe as religious people because he knows that Christ Church is the same way and he does it out in military life look at what the prophets say he does it out in military life he says I was reading an article a man some time ago on the sudden attack on Pearl Harbor that was it no exactly an unknown attack he says they had already been warm that the Jets were going to do that but the sad part was they ignored that warning now I'm a just I'm gonna have to inject this because with us facing this virus I wonder have we been warned and if there was something other than other things that we could have done to prevent what has happened in our nation to prevent what has happened amen in the in the entire world hallelujah amen the numbers in Israel are very low they'd be something different praise God a minute like I said earlier we we got we got leaders that don't even care about the data they still pushing amen don't we go on a third face third phase is more people dying in Phase two than ever time and we're going foe it hallelujah amen it shows that we're at a particular stage oh god I don't want to talk about everybody here today but even our leaders don't want to wear masks amen hallelujah glory see you got access for different healthcare than we have praise the Lord somebody hallelujah oh mama we gotta watch these things there's spirits in the land a man look at what the Prophet says here now he says they had already been warned that the chaps were going to do that but the sad part was they ignored that warning they had seen science and the Japanese army assembling themselves together and the big ships being loaded with ammunition and the threat was in the air and they were just exactly in line for the invasion but they ignored it that's the way it is today with with the church the church is in line of judgment but they are ignoring the coming of the Lord you can't blame them now I told you to see what happens they go from abundance to complacency this is self-satisfaction feeling like amen that's so great there's nothing can happen to him hallelujah that's not a Titanic sunk hallelujah right and and I want to tell you this nation is headed towards judgment I'm just letting everybody know that right right now Israel when they got away from God went to judgment they were a blessed nation but they ended up in Babylon hallelujah somebody glory to God history has a strange way of repeating itself alright let's go forward here a little bit I want to you know brother Brandon made a comment there and amen he said how Satan like that mimic what God does and what he thought he knew that God would have a righteous Church so Satan built his own church hallelujah Satan build its own church now that that statement can be justified when you read a revelation chapter 2 in Revelation chapter 3 where he speaks to the churches there and and and and each age each age let's just start with the Ephesus age being the first age in at the end of age you say he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches now think about it if I'm oh if he's only writing to one Church in Ephesus why does the spirit say amen amen we let him here let Heda have the name let him hear what the spirit say to the churches ha-la-lu if he's only write a letter to one church remember you have the spirit says and he that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches hallelujah I want to make sure you get that because in each church age was both a false Church and a true church Satan was copying what God was doing throughout each age Satan was copying so here's a problem we get our eyes as Americans on the first church and we fail to see what God is doing in the true church we gotta keep our eyes on the church that staying with the word now you know why they call themselves a Christian nation I'm gonna read it to you in a quote and when you hear people saying we're Christian nation Amen we disagree that and God has blessed America it's the truth anyhow but you know I'm a little different than everybody I don't mind standing a man because I know that I've been blessed where I'm standing I hope you get what I'm saying I don't mind standing because I know I've been blessed where I'm standing I might not be able to live the life that I'm living had I been somewhere else praise the Lord but this nation afforded me the opportunities now yes I have been denied some but I choose not to look at when I was denied I choose to look at what I was given and the opportunities that I was given I have taken advantage of by the grace of God but when we look at this Christian nation I want to put it in quotes because it's a so-called Christian nation look at this in the Thyatira church age paragraph 2 26 - 1 the Prophet makes this statement now why does God call these churches now that at the end of at the end of each Church agent says the spirit of Lord says he that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit says until the churches stay stay with that quote I'm staying right there says let him hear he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches now brother Brandon's bringing some clarity on why the holy spirit of why God calls them churches look why does God call these churches his churches even though and I said why does God call these churches his churches even though they are the fine look say the truth of the matter is that they are Christians well what a statement this is what a prophet said about your America they are Christians but they are not they are not Christians of the Spirit ma they are Christians of the flesh they are being bearing the name in vain mark seven seven says howbeit in vain do they worship Me teaching doctrines the commandments of men we've gotten away from the commandments of God and now we have the commandments of me scroll this stuff I want to make a comment right there I just heard an article this week out in California they have banned for people to sing in church or chant in church so you can't sing or you can't chant in church that's a commandment for men it man because the Bible says to me sing unto the Lord brother Jimmy ready this morning zing-zing unto the Lord hallelujah the Bible also said clap your hands and shop with the voice of triumph so I told some brothers even if I have to use my master sing I'm gonna sing if I have to use my master shelf that I'm going to shout because that's a commandment from God he created me to praise Him look I'm not serving a silent card so I'm not gonna serve him in silence I hope you cope that I'm not serving a silent God so I'm not gonna serve him in silence I'm gonna give him his blue praise with the mass go without imma give God glory hallelujah somebody hey man we're not we're not we're not without we can't go with the commandments of me and y'all not even basing things on scripture anymore if you call yourself protecting the public well as you protect them like you forgot the words hallelujah if we just get God involved start praying over your decisions somebody in there that will pray and don't make no decision - you hear from God all right all right all right all right all right look at this now he says they are Christians are the flesh they're bearing the name in vain mark seven seven being in thing do they worship me teaching the doctrines teaching for doctrines the commandments of men but indeed they are Christians for what else could they be is the Mohammed and he said Muslim as a Muslim that is his religion no matter how he lives it because he subscribes in theory to what the Quran teaches hallelujah in the same way a Christian is a Christian as long as he as long as he subscribed to the fact that Jesus is the Son of God born of a virgin was crucified and died and rose again that he is the savior of mankind see every knee gunbound every tongue confess that Jesus is Lord amen since in fact in the land of C&H there will be those who call themselves Christians but they subscribe to the fine qualities because they subscribe to define qualities of Jesus while reserving to themselves the right to deny his deity that's where we at church that's where we had Christian Scientists have done that already as well as multitudes who preached social gospel see everybody want to hear that they don't want the truth they want the social gospel he says he is a nominal Christian and belongs to the church but he is not a true or spiritual believer that kind of believer is one who has been baptized into the body of Christ and it's a member of him but nonetheless it is in God's order that the tears grow up with the weeks and they are not to be uprooted hallelujah that is the command of God their day for binding and burning is coming but not yet now go on in this quote he says so the Spirit is speaking to this mixed group on the one hand he is praising on the other on the other he is rebuking he has told what is right with the true believer now he warms what the false vine must do if it is to stand justified before the Lord so as you read in revelation 2 in Revelation 3 and you get towards the end of each age and you see that that verse of says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches realize he's talking in the midst of each age there is a true group and there is a false group the true group is identified by the blessings that they receive amen the false group is identified by the rebuke that it receives unless you're reading between the lines you'll you'll think it's just one church hallelujah glory to God but it's actually a false church and a true church into woven together and that's what we have here in the US we're they call themselves Christian because they they believe that Jesus was the son of God they believe that he was born to a virgin they believed that he died and rose again they believed all that but they're refusing to follow his word hallelujah glory to God alright let's go on here a little further now this is coming from the sermon spoken words original see part two a man this is a continuation of our thoughts a man this is where the angel wrote to told the Prophet to write and and we're picky picked up his pen he wrote and this is another part of the thought and I look at this he says God has promised be careful God has promised Malachi for for this last date and Malachi for has not yet been fulfilled we read this last week since but it must be fulfilled for it is a Dermatology prophet Jesus referred to it now before I go too far anybody that might read that quote and they'll say brother Branham said wonderful field so we're still looking for a messenger be careful all he just did was the same thing John the Baptist dude did John the Baptist they came and asked him are you the one hallelujah and John the Baptist said I'm not the one that was a prophet lying no he weren't lying he they had him as a different one hallelujah genre I'm not that one but I am one I'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness I look now get your scriptures lined up and you know where I fit hallelujah get your scriptures lined up you'll know where brother Branham fits Oh hallelujah glory to God look at this it says for it must be fulfilled for there's a German tires were dove God spoken through Malachi to prophet Jesus refer to it it is to be just before the coming of Christ the second time listen close now all scripture that has not been fulfilled must be before that time the Bible should be finished to be finished the Gentile dispensation is to be finished with the church age when it's anointed messenger arrives of course we'll plant the seed of the entire Bible plumb from the serpent to the messenger in the form of rain then he will be rejected by the denominational people as his forefather John and Elijah as was spoken by our Lord now look at this he goes and says people as Elijah was the first time to a half's time it will happen here in this country as this country is a type of people look at this he says read or hear Jezebel religion now he gave us a Oh clue there the profit injects that part read or hear Jezebel religion he says as this country our forefathers for worship the way they wanted to come to this country and pushed out the natives and took over so did Israel take over when they come up out of Egypt we act godly men like Washington Lincoln they had great godly men as David and so forth then they got an a hab on the throne with the Jezebel behind him to direct him so have we now when the probably you so have we that's a statement a man that's not something that we're looking for in the future something that's already occurred hmm I want to go to our PowerPoint Amen slide there if I can and I'm gonna try to do this I wouldn't just do something a little different by God's grace here the Angels is telling us just as Elijah came to the first time in a half's time the country was in some trouble I mean Israel was in some color some trouble and God decided to send the Prophet he lives at the time to try to get him straight now I want us to just kind of look at this just for a little bit of a campus he says when we compare Israel to the u.s. a man this is what we're doing a prophet picked us up in and no doubt a man I would also say that there probably other countries out there that could pick up the same thing and see how their countries are tied into the scripture now I don't know if they can pick up revelation 13 the way America can hallelujah but they're there other similarities how they how they might take their country in tune with Israel now the Prophet says this the first thing here is Israel left Egypt to worship in freedom hallelujah now if you remember they were coming out of coming out of Egypt and and they they did all these plagues and everything down in Egypt hallelujah glory to God all those plagues was going on in Egypt but those that were in Goshen never felt a thing amen they fail to follow what the Prophet was telling them then they then they was in trouble but how if they stayed with what the Prophet said they never felt a thing in goshen lorry to God hallelujah we found ourselves in Goshen again a man and I'm claiming it by God's grace I'm claiming it for the Bride of Christ amen we found ourselves in Goshen we find ourselves in the secret place of the Most High we find ourselves there glory to God that's why the police can't touch us even if a symptom came I I want to encourage you buying that symptom in the name of Jesus don't you accept the package that the devil sent unto you amen even if you come in contact with it begin to bond that devil in the name of Jesus now this is not just a pandemic these are Penn demonics that's where the prophet called ipam demonic these are deem is trying to attack the people of God so buying those Devils in the name of Jesus but here when they were coming out of Egypt here our Pharaoh Tom said now look I'm gonna give you I'm gonna give you three days to go and worship your God and come back and said no no we not going to worship and come back and we're not doing this we're not doing that we're leaving each we got God got a promise that forth so they was leaving amen because they wanted this freedom to express themselves to God and worship they didn't have a temple down in Egypt praise God they didn't have a special place that they could go a man and just freely worship down in Egypt but when they got into the promised land these things were established for them they meant freedom of religion now here a man here in the u.s. our forefathers left for left left the the the Europe amen in order to come here to the US for freedom of worship a man they wanted to live in freedom they wanted freedom of worship but Quakers one of the the Billy didn't worship the way God a man I had given him the worship these Quakers were a men also considered like shakers the Holy Spirit was on these people they were shaken and just do all kinds of things but but yet they wanted this freedom to express themselves they were coming out from amen pressed another Catholic Church they were coming out from a man a lot of stuff that was happening with a man with Catholicism and didn't even and when Luther being raised up and standing against some of those things I mean they were coming out during that time so they come with with an expectation that they would have this freedom of religion this is a comparison hallelujah the angel picks up this next statement and it says they are they pushed out the needles now when children Israel went into the promised land my they defeated all the natives that were there there were other people living in the land but because of their sin God said we go for I'm gonna bring my people in they're gonna have to take this thing now you know they took the land little by little [Music] hallelujah somebody and it's the same way to us dear when they come in and landed on one coast little by little they expanded today game the entire United States they push today the south they push the Indians out they had this thing a man it was during the winter months they call it the Trail of Tears they had these the Indians that were here and wasn't even didn't even have the clothes to to take this this highway that was made direction makes it only only on as they took the Trail of Tears to go go west leaving these South leanings going west many of them died on the journey kids kids lost their lives because a man they got struck with a plague or they just didn't have the clothes to get to to get through the winter hallelujah amen the same way many are died in Israel they had many battles and and and and there in Jericho the walls came down and God was giving them their promised land hallelujah Israel I mean what was going on in Israel we see an exact Amen a comparison to what was happening in the US but you know also when you read the scriptures in Joshua there were certain people that never left the promised land the children Israel never got rid of them they stayed there hallelujah which I thought was a perfect type because here even in Florida glory to God we had a group of Indians that can call themself the Unconquered hallelujah we need a group of Christians that will call themselves the Unconquered no matter who come against them no matter what come against them they refuse to be conquered up here we know where to take them we're gonna take them down into the swamp man y'all wanna fight come down here to the swamps and they took they led these generals right down into the swamp and when the generals got down there and thought he was just fighting Indians but they were fighting Crockett I mean alligators and they were fighting snakes and fighting everything else they got their troops and got out of there [Music] they refused to allow them to come down and conquer them they got a big ol place down the South down in Miami area where they don't conquer Indians they celebrate that we never got conquered and we still here today two hundred and something years later we still on our land generation after generation because there are conquered we need Christians understand like that generation after generation standing for God refused to be conquered by the devil that's the best freedom you can ever have as freedom from Xion glory to God hallelujah they were on conquered but yet you know that the same thing happened they push back the natives in Israel they push back the natives win Amen our forefathers came here all of this but they had to be that way glory to God now you know there's so much happening in our land today you know we can't call certain names we can't do this I heard something that you can't call it master bedroom anymore that's what I heard you can't call it the master bedroom anymore hallelujah just call it the big bedroom or something but don't call it master bedroom we we know I understand what people trying to do but I think the level of sensitivity is a little bit too high it's a little bit too high a man I'm not offended that somebody calling it the master bedroom it doesn't bother me like it bothers somebody else hallelujah but there's a lot of things changing a man different sports teams have to change their names right because people have taken offense level way too high glory to God right but by here you know these are the the summoner's its history amen some of this is its history and and I'll tell you like I said earlier I'm identified with a glory and a shame I'm identified with the true Americans I'm identified with the Unconquered they met when I heard they story I got inspired what darling y'all did not face the Trail of Tears I ain't facing no Trail of Tears either I'm gonna be on conker but this is not a man some political thing this is I'm talking about the devil I refuse to be conquered by bedeviled [Music] glory to God but here you know we see these things a man and this other statement that the Prophet makes it says in Israel God raised up in that nation great leaders like David hallelujah hallelujah brother branham call them say and not only brother Brandon but the angel said this says great leaders like David etc was raised up and here in this nation men like Washington and Lincoln were raised up hallelujah now they bring out all the dirt on George Washington and when they start bringing out the dirt on you a man you no longer good leader let me tell you something everybody needs Jesus George Washington needed them Abraham Lincoln need them you'd need them but you've still a greater president and what we're seeing because they say I mean in the quote nine weather quote said Amen we had godly men like Washington and Lincoln they had great godly men as David and so forth then they got an a HAP on the throne with a Jezebel behind them now in order to understand what the Prophet said he told you go back to Jezebel religion so what you're gonna need to do is go listening to Jezebel religion and then you understand what was in the prophets spirit right I mean he was so messed up in his spirit when he was trying to preach that sermon Jezebel religion he told he can might come out at the beginning say he say I don't even want to stay in a hotel again he says last night so much seeing going on in the hotel and they called itself Christians you say safe stuff that you see all over the floor of what they've done that is ungodly accident done order sounds and stuff you hear in your bedroom I say hey I couldn't even sleep say I need to bring a tent and sleep out in the wilderness didn't come in and preach here he said I couldn't even sleep last night he said I'm not staying in a hotel no more now you can't you imagine a prophet coming with his dander up like that and then preaching Jezebel religion hallelujah see the devil the devil put the devil made him so upset that it caused him to preach harder hallelujah I thank God for it right but he was saying he was saying a lot there he was talking about the current president that was in a man in in an office at that time and he was saying say this president is a Catholic president and since he's a Catholic president that makes us a Catholic nation if the leader is Catholic than the rest of us are Catholic hallelujah that's what he was saying Jezebel relates the story said they say some coming is it's here right now and I'm telling you right now the Catholic Church got some real in roots when it comes to our politics all right me like David raised up a great leader like David mighty man like Washington and Lincoln were raised up I looked at that David overcame Goliath David was anointed by God to be king but before he became king he went out to battle as a warrior before he became king he went out to battle as a warrior before Washington became president he went out to battle as a warrior do you realize when David was frightened Goliath everybody was in fear this was a this was a enemy that was way larger than any man in the kingdom of Israel and when Washington was fighting the British Army his troops was way less than what the British Army was bruised bringing over here he had no chance at all but he went out by faith Oh hallelujah Church when I by faith the same way Dave went out David's a little I've know this guy bigger than I am a man he's been a warrior a lot longer than I've been hallelujah just like the United States had not been a nation as long so we didn't even have we didn't have our soldiers is not even equipped to be out there back here he went and got people that was watching farms they were farmers plowshares and stuff like this didn't even have a man shoes for their feet it was the winter time that they were paddling hallelujah in Davis day there are many of them just cows ask your lives would come out and make us boss don't let everybody die just send me one man they happen to be feeding us brothers that day hallelujah feeding us brother say say now who is this uncircumcised philistine his brother saying know who you think you is now you know you know you come out here trying to do something trying to show yourself say you know trying to be bigger than what you are go back home and feed the sheep say who you thinking I said no don't get mad at me without a cost I want to know who this uncircumcised Philistine is and why y'all running from see I don't want to fight him I'll fight him hallelujah Davis stood up toe Saul is playing he said look I got I got I got five rocks in a sling and imma go out there and take this guy head off with these five rocks Saul said look you ain't gonna be able to beat him like that you're gonna need my armor so that looks all if you ain't gonna use your armor why are you gonna give it to me no let me go what I proved and I took out a bear and I took out a lion let me go what I prove it and here here David runs out amen to the battle with a width is up with us with this his slingshot in his in his rocks in it Amen he say say you might come to me in in the name of amen your God but I'm coming to you in the name of the Lord God of Israel said I'm going to take your head off Goliath posted I'm gonna take care I'll tell you we gonna see who ain't gonna come off david swung that stone just one rock praise God one Rock went into the part of his armor that was not covered right in the center of his head took Goliath out David took Goliath sword and took his head off with it courage David acted encouraged but you know George Washington did the same thing he was facing a Goliath the British Army was coming and my they they they they had us pinned down they had already won a couple battles couple skirmishes but George Washington not only was he loses some battles and had to retreat in some instances he has also had to encourage his men to state and one time the man got to a battlin and they routed the army and and made him got courage after they beat the beat beat the British Army say say now wait we got one more battle to fight guys and George Washington knew that these men were coming up on that day they're there at their time of being in the military was actually about to expire so he liked he liked look I know it's time for y'all to go back home but if y'all don't mind just give me one more battle give me one more about I said y'all give me this one battle we we're gonna win our independence from from Great Britain say just give me one more battle I promise I'll do this and I'll do that I'll try to get shoes I'll try I'll do whatever I can't just give me one more battle even though the numbers where it gets them the odds were against them George watch they just just give me one more so he finally got a few men convinced okay we'll fight with you someone went on back home but others say ok we'll fight with you George they come running amen to the battle hallelujah and as they went to the battle here comes the army pressing up against them and and George Washington knew a man that they were in trouble but as his men were getting afraid and my son I'm thinking I shouldn't never come out here George Washington what was I thinking hallelujah they begin to turn and and run back to try to get try not to run for cover but George Washington when he saw his men running he took his horse went to the center of the battle hallelujah to the center of the battle turned and looked at his men say don't run now let's press on into the battle he say that one act of courage in the midst of all the book live in his direction but man was a sitting target but he did not get hit God was protecting that man at that time hallelujah God was protecting the first president he wasn't even president just like David was not King George Washington was not president but yet he was fighting in the battle you say don't turn guys don't turn everybody don't retreat but let's press for say one one guy wrote in this book he says I've never seen such courage from a man he said say something just took over me at that time he said look he said if we don't win i'ma die trying i'ma die trying with a man willing to lead like that hallelujah glory to God he not leaders like brother branham talked about squirt a little water here squirt a little water there no here's the leader that went to the head of the ladder winner axe in his hand come on boys this is the way into the enemy's camp because of George Washington's courage bullet holes in the jacket but he never got hit i'ma tell you when God has something for you to do your purpose your purpose is your protection they say bring back me like that man either go to the battle may not a fight in the battle not just me Aneta sing your children the battle come on somebody we won't men like that men with a principle fight for a principle and by the time George Washington got to the troops they was they was outnumbered but yet they had a courage they had a faith that if George Washington do this we're gonna go we gonna take this army that we gonna take this army down they went out there and took the army down and and is at that point in time the Britons surrendered so you know and not not only not only that there were other nations that were coming to help the British but when they heard about what George Washington did they turned on the British if you look back in Israel's history there was other nations that got up and left there was one that was facing David and they realized how he was being routed they got up and left the other army ain't no way we're gonna do nothing like this when it took off running back to the country Louise see when God got something for you there's nothing that can come against you a man see this is this is the beginning of of who we were a man as a as a as a nation there was one other statement here a man I was talking about how Washington stood in the midst and bullets curtains men to keep fighting in the battle a man his courage was contagious glory to God a man it's a great man great rate our great raised up nation would great leaders like David etc I put I put Solomon as a great leader because even Solomon he you know he fell in in and he did some things but there were some great things happened underneath a man his his time well when he was leading glory to God it caused the Queen of Sheba to come from the other most parts of the earth to see who this guy Solomon was he has he has some tremendous wisdom he reigned during a time of peace Solomon a man and his time was called the Golden Age and let me just read a quick quote on that a man this is a message a greater than Solomon is here glory to God they might just have to hit escape on that praise the Lord amen and I'll come back to it in a second but they're here in the greater than Solomon is here it says this then he come to Solomon in the days of Solomon says now give me your undivided attention for about 10 minutes in the days of Solomon it was a golden age God gave a gift to the earth it was a gift of discernment Solomon had discernment had a discernment how many knows that and he could discern because it was from God the Word of God was with Solomon he could discern well all the people rallied around that gift oh my and Aunty Minister knows that was Israel's Golden Age no wars and they built the temple and everything was at peace and everything because they received the gift that God sent and them days they didn't have television thank the Lord a man says the only thing they had to carry the news was from lip to ear and every caravan passing through it hear about this great gift they go they go over to Solomon's Church and look at it then go back and take it to the nation till his fame scatter everywhere and I will go back to that that's light and I'll just mix it all the way through till we get to a certain point but you know I was saying Sodom was a great leader at this time it was a golden age and brother bran was referring time where where he praise the Lord all right one more I think all right yeah so Solomon says great leader and this Queen of Sheba that's coming to a man that she heard about this dis famous something like you know what in my church these things ain't happening in my church it's a little dead a little dry we don't see the supernatural but I'm hearing all this supernatural move of the Spirit down there amen and we're solid was that she she decided to a man to take a journey it would be three months on the back of a camel that she would have to ride not only a man is she riding on on these cameras but she's got a great part in she's carrying with her and I brother ranch has a very difficult time trying to be doing this because as a woman that was a that was a difficult journey just as a woman but at this time they were robbed was a man in the in the dancer waiting for caravans like this to come and this lady a man if I if I recall correctly I believe the woman I was carrying a little over a million dollars almost by one point seven million dollars actually had that she was carrying two Solomon hallelujah can you imagine a woman coming to church with a check for 1.4 million and the reason that she wants to get her check is because she sees a mighty God unveil if when I get there this man does what what I've been told of this man can do I'm giving everything I got to support it she come and Solomon's there and you know she heard his wisdom she heard of all these things and and one of the wisest things that Solomon did was when these two women came to him talk about our you know we both had babies we were sleeping and at night this woman got up and she had killed her baby rolled over and killed and smothered to death she got up and took her baby put it underneath me and then took my baby a man for her and when I got up in the morning I saw that my baby was dead but I recognize this ain't my baby and it's later say that I killed my baby and she she trying to tell me she didn't do this we're the only two that was in the house King we need you to decide on this hallelujah Solomon already pray the axe God for wisdom amen because God said now I can make you rich I can do this I can do that but what do you want say just make me make me a wise man judge the matters of the people he say because you ask for the right thing I'm gonna make you popular and I'm gonna make you rich plus I'm gonna give you wisdom hallelujah if you ask God for the right thing you might get more actually the right spirit and the right attitude you might get more you're just watching to see how you're gonna respond glory to God soon as he acts the very next day he acts here comes this case in this woman untold his life Solomon say I tell you what and everybody looking at King what are you gonna do what are you under what hang on justice Kings they bring his sword bring him a sword get the king of swords bring me a sword and he got the sword in hand hallelujah it says now since we don't know who baby it is i'ma just split this baby in half and I'm gonna give you half and give you half and when it when he did that the mother of the baby say oh no give it a baby give her the baby I don't split the baby in half like that King give her the baby she can have the BAM I'm okay with it and then the other lady said no split the baby in half because you got some people that don't mind split in the church hallelujah while one is trying to keep it together you got another one trying to split it you got to watch those spirits you know who the real mother is you know who the real pastor is because the past thing trying to split the church just pastors trying to keep it again but the pastor will try to keep sin out of the church split the baby she said she said she said she said neither one was to have it see and Solomon said okay give her to baby we know who the mama is now because a mama wouldn't want to see her baby died Solomon with great wisdom was a great leader during that time over here it said mighty men like Washington Lincoln were raised up I put their President Lincoln lost his life because he was willing to stand against slavery President Lincoln was a man that when he looked out he said God may man but man may slaves hallelujah I want to read this quote from the Prophet and we'll close this section oh Jesus hey man this is not a message hear ye him President Lincoln lost his life because he did not agree with slavery it freed as many as he could and there were many that stood against him even at the time that he freed especially in Texas there was a problem in Texas they didn't let the people know that they were free hallelujah there's a new holiday that they celebrate Juneteenth June 19th because there was some blacks that was still down in Texas that was still bound and didn't realize that they were free what a spiritual type because there's people not just blacks I'm talk about all lives amen but there's many that's bound right now and don't realize that they're free glory to God God wants you to realize that yeah there's a freedom there's a there's an independence that you can declare from the devil the Prophet makes this statement and a message here you him it says years ago down the south when I used to take the colored people and sell them for slaves that never was right that's what the Prophet said he didn't agree with slaver either that never was right no sir God made man man made slaves they used to come and buy a used to come by and buy them poor people just like you would out here on the used-car lot just get a bill of sales and set them there used to be brokers that come by CDs see those people and they take those great big burly men away from their wife and breed them to a big a woman or something another and bring better bring a better set of slaves remember Abraham Lincoln when he took off his hat and pounded his hands like that said that's wrong and someday I'll hit it God give us a president like Abraham Lincoln again yes when he said that he was right it says I remember some time ago here in Illinois I was at a museum and I seen an old colored man going along there a little rim of hair a little rim of hair around that around the back of his head he was looking through a museum and after a while he stopped and he looked he stooped back and they began to cry and tears running down his face he was praying I watched him for a few minutes I walked up close to him I said how do you do uncle and he said how do you do I said I'm a minister I said I would just like to know why you were praying what excited you he said come here says looked in under a little glass and there later dress I said it's a dress I don't see nothing so upsetting about that wouldn't wouldn't wouldn't make a wouldn't make a man jump back and say a prayer now there's a lot that I could say there see brother branham had gone through what this man had gone through so he couldn't identify well why the man was acting the way that he was acting praise the Lord if you ain't going through what some people have gone through then you can't identify why they activated they act praise the Lord but our action should still be Christian hallelujah glory to God you know I was just sharing this with some friends that has asked me about you know just just what was this what I said look the first thing is you just got to admit certain things are wrong you got to admit that I'm not saying that the reaction is right but the first action was also wrong hallelujah don't justify the first action a man alleluiah it's like you know my child did something to my child hit your child now I know I didn't teach my child here all right and you bring my child your child hit my child okay all right okay I'll correct them you want to see me correct them I'll correct them but first tell me why my child hit your child tell me why well it's because my child hits your child oh is that right Johnny I want you to say sorry you'd be big enough to say sorry but I'm also expecting Mike to apologize all right I hope we understand a man we teach John apologize but we also teach John to defend himself praise the Lord all right a man he did turn the other cheek he took one too many punches all right i'ma leave that alone look at this he says look looked in under a little glass and there laid a dress I said it's a dress I don't see nothing so upsetting about that wouldn't make a man jump back and say it and say a prayer he said but look I still got the marks of a slave belt around me he said and that's the blood of Abraham Lincoln and the blood of Abraham Lincoln took that slave belt off of me wouldn't it excite you too brother Brown see I stood back and I said if the blood of Abraham Lincoln would excite a slave from taking a belt off of him what are the blood of Jesus Christ to do when it's pre power before a church that claims to be born again what should it do see it's greater than just the politics amen it's the spiritual part that we don't want to miss and and i'ma tell you the reason that we're in a condition that wins because spiritually we left God we forgot about God a man and in part two I want to show you some things where we left God hallelujah a man a man I believe there was a captain out on the sea got sick out there on the scene who's about to die and and you know they just begin to you know start talking to him about talking to him about Christianity you know you you know used to be a Christian yeah yeah I used to and I used to this so where did you leave God they say I think it was probably at the cradle say well you better go back to the cradle and get them right you better go back and get them and what we need to do is go back and get gone we left them somewhere along the journey we had men that pray man that fought with courage men that that stood with principle they declared certain things wrong and we're willing to give their life for it Abraham Lincoln gave his life for it hallelujah because it was wrong in order to be an American I have to be identified with a glory and with a shame amen I wouldn't I wouldn't trade living here I'm living anywhere else in the world I thank God to live here but I also know this nation is not a Christian nation not no more amen let's pray father we thank you for the word of the Lord that has been given to us Lord God and as we just continue forward in this journey we're talking about how history is repeating itself we can look at in history and Israel's day and look at history and in the u.s. God is repeating itself it's repeating itself but God help us Lord Jesus to be able to catch spiritually Lord and escape we don't have to be caught up in the midst of all this this stuff some seen as a wrap this men have forgotten God and because they forgotten God they're paying the price Israel had to pay the price lord I just pray that you'd help us Lord Jesus to realize that we don't have to be bound as sin and shame God it's the enemy that would love to keep us in that condition and Lord as I just read the story of how man was excited it caused him to cry when he just saw the the cloth that Abraham Lincoln was wearing and the blood that was on it it caused him to cry because he realized a man gave His life that he might go free and God help us to realize that you gave your life at Calvary's cross that we too might go free we don't have to live a man of life of a halfway Christian would be bound in sin and defeated by the enemy hello God we can we can rise a man with true victory true freedom we can experience it Oh God walking in that Liberty that Christ only can give the pray O God that you would just help us to catch it help us the sea Lords what you're trying to show us in this hour and may many Father go free from the the this the slate the slave better seen may they go free God so in the name of Jesus that I pray amen amen no Solomon I'll turn the service
