wonderful time but i remember uh specifically the the uh the birth of that service was because uh i had a dream and i don't dream often i don't dream really that that much but i dreamed about a

got a wife praise the lord says melissa amen and his precious baby uh sister zoe and amen things have changed for brother jerry but we certainly appreciate our precious brother amen we thank god for

fought me as hard as he could but he is victorious and because he's victorious i'm victorious and that's why we can be here this morning i have a little thought that the lord put in my heart and i trust it'll be a blessing to you i'm very grateful as well that my wife and my daughter could be here with us it is the first time that they're here while i'm behind the pulpit so god is certainly great uh great and he's deserving of all glory we thank him for that now if you would just turn your bibles with me we're going to start reading in the book of john the first chapter and how many been enjoying the services thus far you know it's uh it's quite it's quite the the challenge to you know have to go behind those precious brothers but i trust the lord will speak something to our hearts i believe it was brother perry greene that said uh he just wants to add emphasis on what was already said so i just want to add a little emphasis on what was said already now the first chapter of john starting with the first verse it says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was nothing was not anything made that was made and him was life in the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not and let us also turn to genesis the first chapter we'll start at the 26th verse two verses there verse 26 says and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man in his own image and the image of god created he him male and female created he them and god blessed him and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth may the lord add a blessing to his reading you may have your seeds now this was this was the domain for man when god created man his own image this was his vision that he would replicate himself through man now i like how it says in john the first chapter there we notice in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and what i like about that is here we see that the very thing that was with god was the very thing that god was all right and the very thing that you're with this morning is the very thing that you are all right now i want to use as a title god's love letter to himself now the prophet says here in the pro in the message the end sign 1953 june 6 he says say there's a little between the line you have to read in the bible do you believe that see it's a love letter wrote to the church there's no need of seminary trying to teach it because it's not known by any minds of this world i've hid it from the eyes and wise and prudent and it will reveal it to babes such as we'll learn it's true so that's the reason we got all these different forms of kinds of religions and churches it's all right let it go he's the one that takes care of the books look notice though how it was let me give you a little a little something between the line you know sometimes i get away overseas i'm very fond of my wife and she writes me a letter and she says dear billy i'm sitting here tonight i'm thinking very much of you i'm so and so now that's what she's saying but i'm reading between right between the lines i know it goes a little deeper than that uh-huh and if you've got the holy spirit you're in love with christ you can read between god's line there's something in there and this morning i'm trusting that god will show us what's in there right now in between the lines now you see a love letter is it's an expression it's an expression of god's attributes and if you write a love letter to someone else then it's your expression of what attributes you your is in yourself whether it's your emotions feelings but you're writing a love letter now to get the attention of the person you're writing it to me now god had a love letter now if we go back to the beginning uh and now god had a love letter he had a purpose now when god created man he created man in his own image now the reason why he created men his own image because god wanted to manifest more of himself through the creation of man right now god created many things but it was man was the only time that he came and he said it is not good he said everything was good through all the days but he said it is not good that man which should be alone and he saw that it was fitting for a man to have a help me so when matt was created here notice he said male and female created he them now he created both male and family spirit in the man now the prophet says here g this is the this is a message believers thou this i i i i kind of had to to to take part of that same fish brother cho was talking about now the prophet said um now a verse uh paragraph 78 he says now jesus said in john i believe the 15th chapter i am divine ye are the branches well now if the vine put forth the first branch and out of that branch wrote a book of acts the second branch will make another book of acts the third branch will make another book of acts and every branch that comes out of the vine will be the same as the first branch now you can't graft what we know that i've seen a citrus tree with about eight different kind of fruits on it i've i've seen a always tree put grapefruits and lemons and everything else on it but they were drafted that's what's the matter today we drafted our ideas drafted our denomination but if that tree ever puts forth another vine itself it'll be like the original ones that it went into and you see the purpose of god writing of a love letter is the question that who was he writing a letter to now it sounds strange that he would write a letter to himself but you have to know who where god is now you see god is both the root and offspring now and because he's both rooted in offspring he has he has within him those that were dwelling in him before the foundation of the earth and now you see the the scripture says i am divine and ye are the branches but after every branch that bears forth it has to be just like the original now this thought was ex was inspired by a little uh a little project i was working on uh by the grace of god by the grace of god uh the lord uh opened up a tremendous opportunity for me and my family to be first-time homeowners and we're very happy for that and i was working on a project i don't know too much about doing things in the home but i i know i had to get my hands a little dirty so we we had some blinds and in these blinds i had to uh uh the it was it was the patio the patio door and we didn't have any uh any blinds or anything of that nature so i bought the blinds and and it wasn't the right fitting so i i went ahead and i installed it i put all the screws in and now it came part to uh cut the blinds because the blinds were too long the length of the blind were too long for the patio so i said okay well i have to choose one and based on that one i have to cut it perfectly so it could be within that within the perfect dimension of the patio so i went ahead and cut it and i told my wife well you know honey just help me out and based on this original uh blind we're gonna go ahead and use that one to do all the other ones so i went ahead and i just i did just that and uh you know my my wife started helping me out and you know strangely she she decided to say uh when when i noticed she handed me back she would i would cut one she would give me she'll give me the one that i that i just did and after maybe a few she gave me the original and then i said you know uh honey let let's just continue with the original let's let's not use let's not use what what the replica of the original let's just stay with the original now you know that was my idea and that's i i said and i was i was telling her the spiritual application to when it like we got to stay with the original we got to stay with the root and we praise the lord for that and maybe halfway through the cutting probably some 20 blinds halfway through the blinds um i ended up i ended up um i ended up cutting i ended up cutting the original a little too short and it was an accident i was like oh my and and all of a sudden i was like you know what um you know i'm gonna go ahead and the one that i use to cut the original with that one was pretty much perfect so at that point you know i switch rows a little bit i use the original is what i had the originals what i had to put back and i switch froze now i told my wife well i'm like honey this is perfect right because this is the way it's supposed to be you know now it's the same thing with jesus christ now when he went to mount transfiguration now he he had to change rose a little bit now god told him this is my beloved son right here he him and you see he had to be tested he had to be proven he had to be cut and you know what ended up happening is based on that original based on all the other ones that was cut the other one was able to stand a test and to be just like the original and you see whatever you're going through this morning you've been cut by the different trials by the different tests by the different things but god is purging you so you can be just like the original praise the lord and you see i kept going on and we continue using that and you see praise the lord [Music] praise the lord and and you see that's that's god's purpose when when when when when god is is working in you sometimes it's not seeming or or or appealing to the eyes of the of the wise or the prudent but because you're the word you're supposed to be understood by humility now now brother branham preaches a message preaches a message the masterpiece and you know in the masterpiece he said so much i'm gonna try to dig in there a little bit but he he he talks about this the sculpture that michelangelo uh uh sculpted right and he was so inspired i mean he he it was it was moses uh you know uh and he was so inspired when he when he did the sculpture he saw what the what the sculpture came to be it was so identical to his vision and you know and you know even in that because it was so identical to his vision he was stepping in to something that he saw before and you see because he was able to see that he said speak and when he said speak he was so inspired that he chipped the knee of moses and you see i wanted to tell you this morning whatever you're going through speak to your situation speak [Applause] [Music] the prophet says something here this is in the message the word became flesh he said now that's how this is preached in 1954 october 3rd the word became flesh paragraph 174 now that's how he said first he thought and he spoke the word and the word was made manifest and how infallible god is notice every thought when it's spoken when jesus no wonder when he come off the hill that night and looked around the tree for food there was no food for there was no fruit on the tree and he said no man eateth from thee and he went on away and the next day coming back the tree had withered god's mind the mind that in the beginning that was a thought before it was a word that expressed jesus christ the same one was expressing that word back again see and every word in the bible is god's thoughts laying in c form that if received into the human being and spoke by the same thought that materialized the bible brings the thing to pass see what i mean how powerful could the church be the bible said let this mind that was in christ being you as a man think of his heart so is he now your thoughts now paragraph 177 says this is this is what strike me says god said let there be a world before it could be a word it had to be a thought so god in the creation created the world by his thought first then spoken and the thought expressed became material so you see what i want to tell you is whatever you're going through created in your mind even now and then speak it and god will back it up because you are god's attributes you are god himself amen and amen through the through the message masterpiece brother branham continues to speak about this sculpture of michelangelo and and and and he he he was so inspired and and he eventually you know he had a chip on the sculpture but it's it strike brother branham he said to him that's what made it perfect that's what made it a masterpiece now he went again he he certainly went on to to type that with the word and he says here in paragraph 47 in the message masterpiece he says but finally there came forth upon the earth a perfection and that was a man and then he could see in that man that it looked like him so now when he looked upon him he was a reflection of what the creator was god had now been able to achieve the thing that he wanted a man in his own image and then i might say to this that when he made this man there was something about him yet that look that didn't look just right because he was by himself and that's how god had been by himself he was the eternal and the man now in the image of god also existed on the earth by himself so he must have struck the little bow over on his left side and from there he took the peace that struck off of it and made him a helpmate a wife then he was it by himself he had somebody with him and that his that is his great work he as any great sculpture would take his masterpiece and now we see we see this setting here and as god formulate this masterpiece man in his own image any time a sculpture would create a masterpiece they would never cr they would never sculpt something just to hide it they would sculpt it to put it in display and the the the place in which god wanted to place men was in the garden of eden and the the domain of man in the garden of eden was that he had dominion over everything of all the fat the fishes of the sea over the fowls of the air of the cattle um and most important thing is he was god himself in the garden of eden right god told him to be fruitful to multiply and replenish the earth and now we see all way back then the devil all has always been fighting god's masterpiece and god's masterpiece is through the ages from the from the very creation of man um through the different prophets now the brother brennan tells us that the foundation of the masterpiece of god is the patriarchs the foundation it was love grace it was faith it was perfection starting with abraham going all the way on to joseph and now through the different church ages we also see that uh uh the word has always been in a trial and the reason why is because the word had to always be able to stand the test and the word will always stand the test and now we find ourselves in this age and we are not in little the seal we are in the bright age and now given where we're at we find that brother branham states a few things here but we find that the l leonishin age was the only age that kicked christ out of the church where christ now has found himself on the outside knocking to get back in now in the bride christ has not only entered into the bride's heart but christ has become the bride you see christ has become one with his with his wife and because of this when we can go back and read john the first chapter and it says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god was almost as though i could say in the beginning was sister erica and sister eric was with brother jack and sister erica became brother jack you see mr ecker was brother jack because she is duff she bears the same name and because she bears the same name she has the same authority and because you bear the same name as christ this morning you have the same authority so whatever you whatever you're in need of speak the word and god will back it up whatever you're in need of whether it's whether it's healing your body whether it's family speak the word and god will back it up you see you have the ability to create and as you manifest that god will multiply himself in you right perfecting his eternal attributes amen amen we find ourselves on easter sunday and and and you know all through this time it is striking to me that uh you know that when when they looked at jesus they could find no fault in him but yet they saw him as the one that had to pay the penalty now when jesus was at the cross they oh mockingham they were telling him to do certain things you know um i i believe brother kweku might have mentioned uh uh how he was a baby and he was running you know the very god the very creator of the world now he he the god of of creation was on the cross being mocked by by just in almost anybody and now they were telling him well if you're really god come down you know prove yourself prove yourself if you're really god but you see god was not interested in coming down god was interested in coming up from a grave you see and now the god in you is not interested in staying down so whatever you're going through he wants you to come up he wants you to be elevated he wants you to be increased in your finances increase in your health increase in your material being increased in all capacity that's what god is interested in he wanted to come up from the grave and that was the point in time we could come this morning and say he is risen because you see when he got there they noticed that something was different it said well he was in a grave and now he's not now where what happened here you see god was able to show that he was still god yeah he was a man when he weep when lazarus was dead but he was gone when he said lazarus come forth you see he was a man when he was hungry but he was god when he fed five thousands you see now my question to you is what kind of jesus lives in you is it the man of jesus or is the god of jesus what jesus lives in you because if it's the god jesus then you have the same authority he does if the same spirit that raised up jesus from the dead dwelling you he shall quicken your mortal bodies amen now the prophet goes on to say here yeah glory this is in the same message the masterpiece he says this is paragraph 125 going down a little bit there he says now pentecostal brethren throughout the nations i want you to listen my brother if this is the last message i'll ever preach this is my masterpiece do you notice when the wheat the corn of the wheat that falls into the ground when it begins to come back to its grain again watch nature nature exactly is god god working in nature it's all he can but from the pentecostal revival as they think was the seed it wasn't now watch but something came forth just like the seed now watch what jesus said in saint matthew 24 that the two spirits at the last day would be so close together till it would deceive the very elect if if possible now that stalk don't look nothing like a seed neither does the tassel look like a seed but notice now in luther's day but not in luther's day but in a last day the first thing there is wheat farmer sitting here the first thing there that comes forth on a wheat seed you will you will think you would almost think that it was a seed but it's the husk it forms a little outside thing like to hold the seed it forms a husk but the husk is not the seed no more than the tassel or the stalk it's only a carrier of life the corn of the wheat then um he goes on to say in paragraph 130 he said the pentecostal come out just like the wheat went each one comes out from the other coming out from the other but they're only a carrier they go to denomination and that's what pentecost did went to denomination and what did pentecost do when it come out just like the grain it went right back just like in revelation 17 to one of the sister denomination that's exactly what it did and now it says brother brown also says the the greatest seed the original uh fell at nicaea it was the first denomination and we we find that the time that we're living in that god is perfecting himself in his bride right and as he's perfecting himself in this bride he's also bringing the realization of of of the ending of the dispensation of of this little seen age because now it only shows us just how how close and near we are and as as these as we start to see these things god himself is wanting to share his his being who he is with us exactly exactly right now i want to continue to read here this is paragraph 143 he says how notice how noticeable this life is it it's travel in the corner of wheat than it is in the tree god called his people like a tree see the life goes down in a tree and comes back again goes down comes back again it goes down and comes back but in the corner of wheat it goes up from the original stock through the stock tassel in husk and the thing that it passed through dies so it can so it can't get back through it again what is it it's no use anymore it goes on onto its perfection amen don't you see why he never uses an organ organization he can't get back in again it's dead but the life passes on from one to another see they put creeds and inject whosoever shall add one word to the or take one word is blocked off from it it must be the life seed traveling and he said i'm using this in a parable now of the bride the masterpiece that's coming forth as the masterpiece fell there is a masterpiece rising the masterpiece fell at nightshare council and she's coming through a process but she is coming right back again to that masterpiece perfected because she's a part of that word that was spoken by him he'll have a church without spot or wrinkle it'll not be connected anyway with any kind of an organization or denomination the cursive thing it's passed through those things but it will never be there and i i want to go through a scripture here this is going to be first this is going to be first clock collagen is actually uh just collages the first chapter and we're going to start at the 16th verse now i wish to just say this statement just before i read into the scripture now god was the one who sent the love letter and he didn't only sent the love letter but he became the love land and he's also the one that the love letter was sent to now i i hope you catch that because the love letter is is certainly signifying everything that christ was and everything that christ was is in the beginning and in the end and christ all the purpose of everything was was so that christ the fullness of christ would be made manifest in his bride and the first uh chapter here in colossians 16th verse it says for by him were things were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence for it please the father that in him should all fullness dwell and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him i say whether they be things in earth or things in heaven and you that were sometimes alienated in enemies in your mind by wicked works yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and unreprovable in his sight now you see the fullness of christ reconcile you to him and and now the reason why this love letter is to himself is because you are christ now the love letter being you is to jesus christ and now the the prophet says here he says here let's read and uh the same the same message the masterpiece paragraph 156 he says why must the bright groom be the word manifested made plain it's because the bride and the bridegroom are one she is just meaning she is just a smitten piece of him there is the masterpiece it was smitten michael michelangelo could not reproduce that again he could not put it back but god is going to do it he is going to bring this little bride that's smitten right back to the side of the original word and there he is there is the masterpiece the family back again in the garden of eden how is this bride going to do this he how is the week going to do this malachi 4 said in the last days it would be restored restored like back like in the beginning take it back i will restore saith the lord all the years the palmer worms and cake worms and all these other things has eaten i will restore it again malachi 4 said i he will restore the hearts of the people and the faith of the people back to original fathers again see we see this right before us church where are we at and you see over the week i was having this discussion with this brother and and and you know we still find people uh that that faults the message and what what was what's interesting to me is you know they they say these different things of of you know uh maybe brother branham said uh something that was already said or or or or he he he uh plagiarized on something that was already said uh but you know it it reminds me of what happened in noah's day because the same water that saved noah was the same water that destroyed the enemy and and you know we find brother branham his purpose was to tie the loose ends and that's exactly right he did say probably things that was already said but but exactly that the very purpose of him doing it was the fulfillment of what he was sent for and you see when we when we talk about you know the revelation chapter 10 7 saying he you know in the days of the uh in the days when the voice of the seventh angel will begin to sound the mystery of god will begin to to be will be finished you know the the thing about of that is that the mystery did not start in little decea the mystery started in genesis and you see brother browner was here to finish that mystery right god used the message to show the fullness of the bride just like our pastor said of the the mystery of of christ the christ was the mystery of god revealed the bride is the mystery of christ revealed now is he revealed to you this morning right because the what every mystery god has revealed now the prophet goes on to say same message in on paragraph 160 he said she is smitten from the church from the church body smitten with her master for the same purpose she is the word just the same as joseph was smitten from his brethren because he is he was the word and jesus was smitten from his brethren because he was the word the church is smearing the brightest men from the church because she is the word there is your stages again one two three see just exactly and you see you are the word this morning church you are the word and because you are the word you are you are you are given the responsibility to manifest the word to live the word and uh there's another quote i want to read here all right let's see okay uh now it says i i i'll read a paragraph 170 uh 171 he said all true life that was in the stock tassel and husk is now gathering in the seed ready for the resurrection ready for the harvest the alpha has become omega amen the first come last and the last is first the seed that went in has come through a process and become the seed again the seed that fell in the garden of eden and died there come back from that imperfect seed that died there come back to the perfect seed the second adam now the first eve that fell and was used in the second reformation second coming as bringing forth a child now has become the true bride again the seed right back with the original word in paragraph okay i can't find this paragraph but as god's love letter i i just wanted to read a few things that god has said to you personally now we find ourselves on on thursday um brother choice spoke about the grace of god and bola kwaku came once on friday and spoke about the different easters that occurred in the bible and brothers brother uh brother smiley yesterday night was a blessing to us he spoke about the mighty and great conqueror now god is certainly sending a message and out of his love letter i i just feel led to say that the grace of god paved the way so that repentance could be accepted and now when you go to acts 2 it says to first repent and now i notice that it's harder than ever to get someone to uh uh to repent you know uh when when we find ourselves in any situation god is not able to operate if repentance has not been done it says to confess your faults one to another and that the prayer of the rights availeth much but you see repentance is a gift now but when it's gone you'll realize that you know that that is too late but god god wants every heart of the believer to be purged and every trial every situation god wants to perfect himself he wants to perfect himself in the attributes he's placed in you and faith and virtue and patience and brotherly kindness he wants to manifest himself in you now i wish to turn to john 15. and this is another of god's love letter that he's given to you directly now we'll read at the seventh verse well the sixth verse it says if a man abided not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gathered them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if ye abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what ye will and it shall be done unto you hearing is my father glorified that ye may bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples as the father hath loved me so have i loved you continue ye in my love now god has given you the right to ask him whatever that whatever you have need of god has also given you the right to speak the word the word is a seed when you speak the word it is going to reproduce of itself amen and and as i close and the musicians will make their way i just read i wish to read one last quote here now the prophet said the message and from that time all right we'll start reading in paragraph 64. he says all these things there is a time when something happens and maybe all their vows and all the leagues of nation and so forth maybe had good intention but they all come to an end all become crumbling beneath the feet of man with all good intentions we could have but all must come to an end but there is a time that a man come to something that's eternal that's when a man meets god that's when something happens that's eternal we do our mistakes we have our vows on new year's night to only break them the next day we turn new pages and we assign vowels and we go to the priests but like catholics do but make confessions and sign pledges and we come to the altar and turn new pages but all in vain for the next time somebody crosses our path or something that old temple will fly right back again every time that we get into trouble or something it'll happen again but there's a place where a man can come to a time that will change him forever for eternal he that will come to me i will in no wise cash doubt said jesus a man can come to god and his whole eternal destination is changed and a man can meet god and he can never be the same anymore you can't come you can't meet god and never remain the same person he was if you were turned away from him you'll be worse person than you ever were if you received him you got eternal life and he'll raise you up at the last day by his promise and today on this easter morning we can rest knowing that if we accept what he has already done then he has promised us that he will give us eternal life and and i encourage you uh wherever you are that christ wants to do greater in your life than that has been done christ wants to fulfill himself in your life and as a brother brother as our brother said last night this is the best human life we can live on this earth you see because god god we have received the earnest of what god has prepared for us in glory and brother branham says here in this message spiritual amnesia paragraph 206 he says now look i want to ask you something what if he does come say he isn't coming i don't know whether he is or not this is the last sign remember thus saith the lord did he did you ever hear me say that but what was true you are seeing your last sign that's scriptural you've seen your last sign pentecost don't get mixed up with what he promised israel after the rapture that ain't you you're done then see now is your day now is your sign now is your time don't reject it don't do it you better come you believe me to be god's servant remember and i encourage you if you have not come i say now is the time god bless you heavenly father lord jesus we thank you god for your grace your mercy your redemption plan to restore us back to you father father your plan o god to identify yourself with us to show us lord that that we were with you before the foundation of this world and that god we are a piece of you father from eternal in just a space of time lord for a moment but god we look forward lord to your promises father that in the twinkling in the moment of of of an eye lord jesus you would change us you'll translate us father you'd meet with us so father and god we ask lord that our hearts would continue to be your throne of glory that you would abide lord jesus and that we would manifest in god just just speak your word father god walk in faith lord not in fear but surrender to your word lord fortified behind your cross lord jesus father god i i prayed it something was said to bless our hearts to lift us up father to keep us in the right path lord god to have our minds on you lord for you said let this mind that was in christ being you father we want to think like you we want to we want to speak like you we want to walk like you and god if it means to die like you lord we want to die like you father for you said not my will but that will be done lord jesus i pray god if there's any need in this place this morning father god death cannot reign where you are lord sickness doesn't have place lord father life is here and god i i claim healing on whoever has a need lord father i claim deliverance on whoever needs deliverance lord god that lord once again you would prove yourself to be the resurrected king father we thank you lord and we ask that you would bless the service that we have later this morning that you'd speak to our pastor lord that god we want to thank you father for all you've done lord and what you're even doing now in the name of jesus christ we give you all the praise glory and honor amen [Applause] god bless you church we thank the lord uh for this sunrise service um and just a wonderful wonderful thought from our brother jerry this morning uh god's love letter to himself and um i mean we were created for the very purpose of uh of being his bride and you know as he was just kind of going through the uh the various quotes there in the in the masterpiece there was one that i was looking down the screen and it says that uh the bride has become the word and you know i was just thinking to myself how many churches can you go to that will pick up john chapter one uh where it says in the beginning was the word and the word was god the word was with god and um and be able to place uh be able to hear someone place you in that scripture right uh there's uh there's many that we can see where christ you know christ he came he was the word he became the you know he he became manifest in the flesh and all of that but uh the prophet was very very intentional about trying to get us to see that we are also there but the random made a statement says the word that became flesh in christ has now become your flesh can you imagine that with all your mistakes all your failures all of that but you know that scripted lady read out colossians uh he's doing this so he can present us through his blood not only through the blood he can present us unreapprovable unblameable amen and and and and like like brother troy said unbelievable grace how we thank god for this how we thank god for this it's just this just wonderful god was not interested in coming down from the cross he was interested in coming up from the grave and it says god's not interested and you stand down [Music] he wants you to come up to elevate in your finances to elevate in your health to elevate in every area of your life lord i received that this morning i tell you i thank god for the word [Music] [Applause] i'm i i probably have to say you know just from a um [Music] it's probably carnal for me to say this but i want to say it anyway [Music] the mask blocks the expression that was on my face as i just thought about this whole weekend and i was sitting there thinking myself man i don't even have to preach i have i have thoroughly enjoyed from thursday night friday night saturday night sunday morning uh i thank god for what he's doing right here in spirit and truth tabernacle i was just grinning from lip to ear and said my god my god you know this is this is church it's okay brother i'm thank you so uh but uh i'm just grinding from lip to ear just seeing what god has done and um we heard from heaven that this was like a real revival a real revival and uh i just appreciate the brothers and just them laboring and just getting a thought from god and man they brought all i can say is they brought heaven down they brought heaven down so praise the lord let's just have a word of prayer amen and we will close the sunrise service amen this morning father we are so appreciative the word we've heard god this love letter that you wrote to yourself you were manifested in us and through us we were created to be your bride just the same way eve was created to be adam's right smitten lord from your side but lord you have drawn us through your love right back into fellowship again and the more we think about it the more we love you the more we want to draw closer to you the more we endear uh to you father we just we just appreciate you thank you lord for brother jerry just laboring and and and how brother quaker told us the other day that everything you go through there's a message in that there's a message in it and then brother jerry comes and tells us about cutting the blinds and father how he saw uh even when it looked like the original was messed up there was another copy made that was just like the original and he could continue his project lord and father help us to see ourselves in there where it might look marred might look messed up might look like this but lord you already got a plan in place and there's nothing the devil can do that can stop the project from being completed thank you father lord as we uh just prepare to leave this this service and this time we trust that you would go with us and father we'll be coming back for in a few hours for lord the the final service of this series we pray that you would meet us here god not just the saints we certainly uh expect that there'll be some visitors that'll come and join us but lord let revelation it's not by accident that anybody ever walks into this church they come because you've destinated them to come so father we pray that you were just ministered to every heart and make the difference in lives lord may we leave this weekend transformed by the power and by the word of almighty god thank you fathers in jesus name we pray amen amen the lord richly bless you uh those that join us online god bless you we'll be back 10 30. we'll be starting our service amen for this morning god bless you you can be dismissed so [Music] so [Music] [Music] you
