From that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him. Then said Jesus unto the 12, "Will ye also go away?" Then Simon Peter answered him, "Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou has the words of eternal life. And we believe and assure that thou art that Christ, the son of the living God. Amen. Revelation 10. I read verse seven.

Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you and may the Lord bless the reading of his holy word. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. May be seated. All right. So this evening we want to speak on the subject uh that I title here the point of no return. &gt;&gt; Amen. The point of no return. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now we find out you know from the holy scripture that we have read and they taking you know the entire scripture you know the ministry of our lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; We find out that when Jesus Christ started his ministry he was healing the sick. &gt;&gt; He was raising the dead. He was feeding the poor. And the Bible said that his fame went throughout all the regions and even abroad, even down unto Syria until the Bible said, you know, that Jesus fame in Matthew 4:23 to 25. The Bible said that Jesus fame, you know, went all over everywhere. So he was so popular miracles and the signs and the wonders are taking place in the ministry of our Lord Jesus Christ and the people loved him. &gt;&gt; Not because of who he was but because of what they will benefit from him &gt;&gt; and that was why you know they love him and the great miracles you know were taking place. signs and wonder were taking place until in the book of Mark chapter 2 verse12 the Bible says you know that they said that we have never saw it on this version &gt;&gt; it was peculiar it was special the ministry of Christ was completely different from all other ministries they've not seen it in that version &gt;&gt; they have seen a lot of Pharisees and Sadducees and the scribes and the Herodians and the different organizations and the churches. &gt;&gt; They have had a lot of preacher preach. &gt;&gt; They have seen a lot of doctors of the law, you know, ministering preaching everywhere. &gt;&gt; Churches, synagogues everywhere. But brother when Jesus started his ministry it was completely different from all other ministry they have never seen it in this version. &gt;&gt; It was completely different. It was unique. Hallelujah. Because it was a ministry sent of God. &gt;&gt; God ordained ministry. And the brothers I want you to put into your heart tonight because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever. What he was yesterday, he is now and he will be forever. His nature has never changed. We are serving unchangeable God. We are serving God. Hallelujah. Who has the power. Hallelujah. Over everything. And his action and reaction is the same. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What a glorious time that we are living in. So in this evening, church of God, I'm not just talking about the ministry of Jesus Christ yesterday. I'm talking about the present tense ministry of Jesus Christ. I'm talking about the ministry of Christ today. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They wanted him everywhere. &gt;&gt; In their churches, &gt;&gt; they wanted him everywhere. Everywhere they were calling for him, &gt;&gt; everywhere they wanted him to preach. &gt;&gt; Everywhere. &gt;&gt; Everywhere. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes. &gt;&gt; Until home and abroad. He has a lot of invitations. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; So many of them. And he has to place them before the father in order to make a decision because there were too many invitations. &gt;&gt; And Jesus the Bible said he can do nothing &gt;&gt; until the father show him. Hallelujah. And brother Abraham said when those invitation comes I pull them before God and I pray over them and regardless if it's a small church or big church it does not matter &gt;&gt; but let God do the leading &gt;&gt; and show him the place to go and the where to go and the what to say and the work to do. Hallelujah. Who will be in the mailing? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; What will be their problem? &gt;&gt; The number of their house. Hallelujah. And the type of clo that they are going to wear. And the angel of the Lord will have to come from the right hand side of the altar. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And begin to say something about the people that were present in the meeting. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Before it ever happened, &gt;&gt; God show him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; John 5:1 19 says, "He can do nothing &gt;&gt; until the father show him." &gt;&gt; So he show him. Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He was being shown. Amen. What is going to happen in the milling? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And brothers, the ministry was so popular, people wanted him everywhere &gt;&gt; until even Dr. Simon the Pharisee invited him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. &gt;&gt; Do you know what he was trying to do? He was trying to gain popularity. using the ministry of Jesus Christ to be popular. &gt;&gt; And then we have the same thing, brothers and sisters, that many of them, you know, invited him in order to be popular, in order to build their ministry, in order to ride on him, &gt;&gt; in order, hallelujah, to get the crowd so that when you know the poster, Amen. and the invitation were sent out. Then they can put his picture there and they can let the people know that Jesus Christ, Amen, is coming to the city. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And the many people will come to the meeting and they will buy the ticket. Hallelujah. And the hotel's reservations, you know, will be completely booked. Amen. And there will be no room. Amen. To contain the paper. Why? because it was a special ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope somebody you are with me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Oh, praise the Lord. Why? Because he was doing great thing. &gt;&gt; That ministry was becoming great. But brothers, they were doing those things. Amen. In order to get the crowd, &gt;&gt; in order to, you know, get their ministry to be popular. It was a spirit that was in them. And let me tell you this brothers, if you want to be popular is a spirit that is upon you. &gt;&gt; And that spirit is called pride. &gt;&gt; That was the spirit that was upon Simon the Pharisee. &gt;&gt; It's pride. &gt;&gt; Pride.

The Bible says over there in the book of Isaiah in chapter 14:12, he said, "Oh Lucifer, &gt;&gt; Amen. Because thou has said in thy heart, &gt;&gt; bride." &gt;&gt; Amen. He's the same spirit of Lucifer. &gt;&gt; That spirit has never departed this earth. For Satan take his man but not his spirit. And the God take his man but not his spirit. God spirit are here working. They are working tonight. They are working everywhere. The spirit of pride. The spirit of the devil is working on her today. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. and they look at it trying to gain popularity &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; through the ministry of Jesus Christ my my &gt;&gt; pride &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; they just want to be big &gt;&gt; want the people to know them &gt;&gt; Jesus &gt;&gt; and because they don't have what he had &gt;&gt; then they have to invite him &gt;&gt; and ride on his back &gt;&gt; yes sir &gt;&gt; yes sir my &gt;&gt; hallelujah Right. &gt;&gt; Is the spirit of the devil &gt;&gt; pride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everywhere today, &gt;&gt; you know, big crowd everywhere. &gt;&gt; You see what they did?

The prophet said that we know we do great things for us in our midst. And brother Abraham said that the topple will be manifested in our midst by humility. And that we got to humble ourselves in order to see God moving on the scene because the topple is not going to be you. It's not going to be me in action. It will be God in action. &gt;&gt; It will be super anointing in action. And the brother we must be perfectly humble. And the when we can become so humble, then God can reveal himself. For whosoever exalted himself, God will bring a base. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And the way Lucifer exalted himself, you know, God brought him down to the size of the pit. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; And the brothers, if you don't want God to bring you down, humble yourself. &gt;&gt; All right? and thou will be exalted in due season. &gt;&gt; And if you want promotion tonight, you've got to humble yourself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen, church. We find out here that the invitations were growing and they kept on piling up much more. Amen. And he has to pull them before the father to decide which one to attend. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Whether a big one or a small one, it does not matter. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Why would the invitation keep coming? because they can see something in him. &gt;&gt; You know, that was completely different from all others. &gt;&gt; He fed the 4,000 there were leftover. He fed 5,000 there were leftovers. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the next time they wanted to make him king, the Bible said by force. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; John 6 chapter 15. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Verse 15. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; 6:15. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; The Bible says that they wanted to make him king by force. &gt;&gt; My God. &gt;&gt; They wanted them to be their king by force. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And the brothers, remember, I'm talking about something that's peculiar. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about Jesus Christ the same. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yesterday, today, and forever. How many of you believe with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the ministry of this day. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; But Abraham said, he said, "And he is supposed to according to the scriptures return to us in this last day, &gt;&gt; right?" &gt;&gt; In the message one in a million, &gt;&gt; in this type of ministry, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; that will be after the baptism of the spirit &gt;&gt; and speaking in tongues and divine healings and so forth. These things the carping of the Pentecostal message is what we are speaking of today. This ministry &gt;&gt; of the Christ himself impersonated among his people &gt;&gt; with the very same things &gt;&gt; that he did when he was here on earth in his body the bride &gt;&gt; which is part of him &gt;&gt; doing the same thing &gt;&gt; as husband and wife and king and queen just before the marriage ceremony. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The same ministry &gt;&gt; of Christ &gt;&gt; impersonated. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So what are we talking about brothers and sister? It's not the ministry of a man. It's not the ministry of spirit and life tabernacle. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; West Palm Beach is not the ministry of Jagdov. It's not the ministry of Gideon or Yakul. It's not the ministry of any other. &gt;&gt; Right. That's right. &gt;&gt; It's not the ministry of William. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are talking about the ministry of Jesus Christ himself &gt;&gt; impersonated among his people. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; From the message souls in prison now. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; In prag 116 &gt;&gt; he said and I quote, he said the ministries must be the same. The ministries must be the same. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; In so much that he said, I see some of you writing scriptures down. St. John 14:12, he that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also. See the works, preaching to the lost, healing the sick, and then to the impossible to ever be saved. &gt;&gt; All right. All right. See the work went on just the same. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; So this has been has this been &gt;&gt; may I pour like this &gt;&gt; the ministry of Jesus Christ reincarnated &gt;&gt; in his church &gt;&gt; in this last day. &gt;&gt; Exactly right. &gt;&gt; That's what many of us believe. I believe with you the prophecy. &gt;&gt; I believe this. &gt;&gt; If I didn't believe it, I will do something else about it. &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; Because after all, this is me that is concerned in here. &gt;&gt; And if the spirit of God be in you, you are concerned about the people. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. That's just for a little background tonight. &gt;&gt; That that is the ministry of Christ. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's not the ministry of a man. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; It's not the ministry of a church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not another organization. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But God has not sent me to build an organization or a denomination into a great organization. is able to build each an individual of you into the statue of a perfect man. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The likeness of Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; The images of Christ &gt;&gt; is the ministry of Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Reincarnated. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amongst his people. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. God. &gt;&gt; Amen. and brothers at that time when the people begin to look and they saw &gt;&gt; that there was something special &gt;&gt; and they were attracted &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; at that ministry &gt;&gt; then what happened they said we will make him king &gt;&gt; we wanted them to be with us but brother that was just the first pool that was just the second pool and then you know everybody you know they They attracted they wanted to make him king because you know it was so special to them. &gt;&gt; But brothers he escaped. The Bible said John chap 6 verse1 15. &gt;&gt; Let's see what the Bible says. John 6:15 when Jesus therefore perceived that they would have come and take him by force to make him a king. He departed again into a mountain himself alone. &gt;&gt; My lord, &gt;&gt; my God, &gt;&gt; he departed himself alone &gt;&gt; into the mountain. And when he went to the mountain, the father begin to show him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; What we become of the ministry. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; The father show him. The father show him that those crowd will begin to live. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; When he shall begin to sound. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember this John chapter 6, right? &gt;&gt; Exactly right. &gt;&gt; And brothers, quickly listen to this. He went to the mountain and he was there on the mountain and the father begin to show him that look very soon this people will begin to depart. &gt;&gt; Listen listen he said these things in the seventh seal quickly in the seventh seal. He said these things in paragraph 320 of the seventh seal. Are you here with me? &gt;&gt; All right. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said what am I trying to say this for friends? is to show you we are the end time. Now if them or others is perfectly on the dot with the word so is this perfectly on the dot and with the word we are here we are at the hands friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Soon it shall be time run out. Millions will lose their lives. Millions will be that now believe that they are saved will be counted &gt;&gt; further for the atomic age. Wow. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Millions will be that now believe that they are saved &gt;&gt; will be counted further for the atomic age. We are living at the last hour &gt;&gt; by the grace of God by his help to his people that they might look forward to the soon appearing of Christ. How long were Abraham? Maybe 20 years. Maybe in 50 years. Maybe in 100 years. I don't know. And maybe in the morning, maybe yet tonight. I don't know. &gt;&gt; And anybody says they do know they are wrong. &gt;&gt; See, they don't know. God only knows. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. The seventh seal, &gt;&gt; the coming of the Lord. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The hour when the coming of the Lord will be completed. &gt;&gt; Completed. &gt;&gt; Nobody knows. &gt;&gt; Only God knows. &gt;&gt; I can't tell you it's going to be 1977. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I can't tell you that &gt;&gt; because I don't know. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? which you know has become a serious matter today and the people are picking him up on God. Are you here? Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Abraham said I don't know &gt;&gt; only God knows what he said. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; What he said brother? &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; He told us that I can mix that 20 years 7 year 100 years. I don't know. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Only God knows. Amen. Amen. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Noise. So help me by God. I tell the truth that these are spiritually designed to me designed by the Holy Spirit and by every one of them I identify it place in the Bible. Now what this great secret is that lays beneath the seal. I do not know. I don't know it. I couldn't make it out. I couldn't tell it just what he said, but I know that it was them seven thunders altering themselves right close together, just banging seven different times and it unfolded into something else that I seen. Then when I seen that, I looked for the interpretation. It flew across there and I couldn't make it out. That's exactly right. See, the hour isn't quite yet for it. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; But it's moving. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Into that cycle, &gt;&gt; see it's coming up close. &gt;&gt; So the thing for you to do is to remember that I speak to you in the name of the Lord. Be prepared. &gt;&gt; You don't know what time something can happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. That's right. Glory. Hallelujah. Amen. My my my &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Now when that get on tape, &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; which it is, they will probably send 10,000 of my friends away from me. &gt;&gt; Glory. Same thing, brother. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Yes. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Because they are going to say that brother Abraham is trying to put himself and make himself a servant or a prophet or something before God. Let me tell you my brethren, that is an error. &gt;&gt; I'm only telling you what I seen &gt;&gt; and what has been taught to me. And now you do whatever you want to. I don't know who is going who what is going to take place. I do not know. I just know that those seven thunders old that mystery &gt;&gt; the heaven was quiet. Everybody understand. Amen. It may be time. It may be the hour now that this great person that we are expecting to rise on the scene may arise on the scene. Maybe this ministry that I have tried to take people back to the word has laid a foundation. And if it has, I'll believe in you for good. &gt;&gt; There wouldn't be two of us here at the same time. &gt;&gt; See, if it is, it will increase. I will decrease. I don't know but I have been privileged by God to look and see what it was see unfold to that much now that is the truth &gt;&gt; wonderful &gt;&gt; brothers that sounds like somebody else is coming after the prophet of God &gt;&gt; come on now &gt;&gt; come on preach &gt;&gt; it sounds like somebody else is coming after the prophet of God. &gt;&gt; But I sure want to tell you tonight &gt;&gt; that brother Abraham told us categorically in the message Christ is revealing his own word. He said there won't be further advancement than what is going on now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. He said there won't be further advancement than what is going on now. &gt;&gt; What father said that this message that I am preaching is the true message and the last message of this day. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And that is the message that the father has shown to the prophet of God and said look is going to send 10,000 &gt;&gt; of your friends away. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Yes brother. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's going to turn a lot of people that are not thinking or believing that they are saved. &gt;&gt; They will become &gt;&gt; cannon. coming father &gt;&gt; for the atomic age. Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The father saw him all these things. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; For the first pool was healing signs and wonder and the second pool was the discernment and the prophecy. But the third pool was the opening of the word. &gt;&gt; And when the word was open, that was when it began to sound. Lord have mercy. &gt;&gt; The first pool and second pool, those were not the sounding of the seven angels message. &gt;&gt; Right. Exactly right. &gt;&gt; Exactly right. &gt;&gt; Those are the preliminaries. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And that is what the first climax was all about. And that's why a lot of them, you know, they gather and they were sitting on the field and they were enjoying that message until, you know, they become tired &gt;&gt; and they started looking for biscuit &gt;&gt; substitute &gt;&gt; to the bread of life &gt;&gt; until the evening light begin to fall. until the evening shadow begin to fall and the evening light begin to shine and the intellect of God return back you know to the message of the dead to fellowship around the article of eternal life the things that have been hidden before the foundation of the world &gt;&gt; right amen right &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; that we give dynamics &gt;&gt; Amen &gt;&gt; to the mechanics of the bride &gt;&gt; Amen &gt;&gt; for the rapture Right. &gt;&gt; Brothers, &gt;&gt; praise God. &gt;&gt; When it shall begin to sound, it won't be so many. It will be very few. &gt;&gt; Not so many, but very few. Quickly, we are going to read few more quotations from the prophet and then we shall close. From the unveiling of God. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Listen to what my prophet say. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. In prog 22 of the message, the unveiling of God. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. He said this and I quote, he said, "Now my subject this morning, I trust that God will reveal this and each time if you take the tapes and listen, I hope and trust that you have had a spiritual understanding of what that God has been trying to get over to the church without saying it right out." See is a thing sometime we have to say things in such a way that it might f down the crowd. &gt;&gt; Amen. It might bring down bring some to go out, some to leave, some to ponder. &gt;&gt; He said, "But that's done purposely." &gt;&gt; It might it must be done that way. &gt;&gt; Then it might be that some will say, "You mean God will purposely do a thing like that?" He certainly did. &gt;&gt; It does. Yet. He said one day when he had thousands around them, he said, "Except you eat of the flesh of the son of God or son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in your." What kind of a statement do you think that a medical or a nurse a medical doctor or a nurse or any fine intellectual person will think of a statement like that for a man that had a ministry like that like he had? Why? He will say he the flesh that's cannibal to drink human blood that is a vampire. He said in other words he want us to be cannibals and vampires. He said and the whole audience walked away from him. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; And there was a minister ministerial association with him of 70 &gt;&gt; that have been chosen. and he turned to them and he said, "What will you think when you see the son of man ascending up from where he come from or he came from?" Now, he didn't explain that. He never explained how Paul did that later on. He just said it and then went next. He said, "What will you say to this minister 17? When will you see when you see the son of man ascending from where he come from?" Now no doubt them men said now just a moment. Oh we he with him we fish with him. We sleep with him and we know where he was burned. He saying that we seen the cradle that he was rocking and how does this man this is a hard saying &gt;&gt; and the Bible said they didn't walk with him anymore. &gt;&gt; They left him. Then he had 12. He had chosen 12 and one of them was a devil. He said so he turned to them to them and there's no one could explain what he had just said. How are they going to heal his flesh and drink his blood and how did he came down when he was born right here on earth. See they couldn't understand. &gt;&gt; And then he turned to the apostles and said do you want to go also? Come on now. &gt;&gt; And that's when Apostle Peter made that great statement. &gt;&gt; Lord, to whom shall we go? &gt;&gt; See, for we are satisfied. &gt;&gt; We know assuredly that you and you alone have the word of life of this hour. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. And so may we say tonight and we to whom shall we go? &gt;&gt; For we know &gt;&gt; assuredly &gt;&gt; that thou and thou alone have the word of life for this hour. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The word of life of this hour. &gt;&gt; And we are satisfied of that. &gt;&gt; So they could not explain it. You can't explain faith &gt;&gt; is something that you believe &gt;&gt; and is so solid that there is nothing else will take his place. &gt;&gt; Therefore, they know that the word that was written for that age that they were living in the mine the meic age &gt;&gt; that it fit that place exactly. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Right. And what could they do to go back in them quote former churches that they had come out of said where will we go to? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; See we are fully persuaded we are &gt;&gt; that you have the word of life. &gt;&gt; See and they couldn't explain it &gt;&gt; but they believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See and Jesus said that to weed down his crowd. see till he could get the group together and out of all those people they only 11 of them then understood actually who he was. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; They know that he was God and God alone. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brothers, sisters, and we can stand on that tonight. that we are confused and that's why we are concerned and that is why we can say it. Amen. That the ministry of Jesus Christ is the same &gt;&gt; yesterday, today and forever. The ministry, are you hearing me? For if Jesus Christ is the same, his ministry is the same. &gt;&gt; And that ministry produces three kinds of believers. It produces the real believers, the unbelievers and the makebelievers. And the real believers are the 11 and the make believer that was Judas and the unbelievers the 70 preachers &gt;&gt; and many time we are looking for the unbelievers on the house side not knowing that the unbelievers they are on the hill side. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; For the ministry gather all kinds. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Are you here? Amen. We just don't. Oh brothers, forget about the people out there. &gt;&gt; You focus on the ministry &gt;&gt; and that's what the ministry has produced. The make believers and the home believers and the real believers are inside the ministry of Jesus Christ. And he was the one that ordained them into his ministry. My Lord, my Lord, my Lord, my Lord, my Lord. &gt;&gt; And they started to go back &gt;&gt; back to the God of their beginning, back to where they came out out of. Amen. Every one of them, they were going back, &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; They went back to the very very beginning that they came from, &gt;&gt; brothers. And the prophet of God said that when people move back, they turn their back on this glorious message in paragraph 185 of three kinds of believer. 185 three kinds of believers. The prophet of the almighty God says you are numbed &gt;&gt; by the power of Satan. &gt;&gt; You are beyond hope. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. &gt;&gt; 185. Three kinds of believers. He said, "Nome &gt;&gt; by the power &gt;&gt; of Satan." &gt;&gt; Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; It said you are beyond hope. &gt;&gt; That's what he said. &gt;&gt; Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. He said this message of the hour that we are enjoying the presence of God in these last days. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This message &gt;&gt; is the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; He said for a man to walk out on that &gt;&gt; is normed &gt;&gt; by the power &gt;&gt; of Satan. He is beyond hope. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Let's quickly read that. He said and this message of the hour that we are now enjoying the presence of God the latter day the evening time when the light are shining and the things has been opened up and the word vindicated and proved to be the truth both prophesy comes to pass are all through scientific and everything &gt;&gt; proved that it is Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; the same yesterday and today and forever. And a man walk out on that is an unbeliever. &gt;&gt; He's beyond hopes &gt;&gt; is normed by the power of Satan. So there's no ops for him. He is beyond ops. We want to stop there, brothers, sisters, &gt;&gt; because we saw that these same people that wanted to make him king in John 6:15, they were the same people that turn him down &gt;&gt; and walk away from him. The same people that wanted him and wanted them in their church, wanted them, you know, to be with them, wanted to use his name, you know, to build their organization, to build their denominations, to build their ministry. The same people &gt;&gt; turn their back on him &gt;&gt; and walk away from him. the same people. &gt;&gt; My God. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said for a man to come to that condition, &gt;&gt; he said that man is numbed by the power of Satan. &gt;&gt; Is beyond hope. &gt;&gt; There's no hope. Jesus. &gt;&gt; Go back to John 6:66. John 666. Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; What is it? What did it says there? &gt;&gt; From that time. &gt;&gt; And from that time, many of his disciples went back and walked no more. Wait, &gt;&gt; wait, &gt;&gt; wait, &gt;&gt; wait. Yeah. &gt;&gt; John 6 66. &gt;&gt; 666. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; They took the mark of the beast. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Right. &gt;&gt; Number by the power of Satan. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Beyond hopes &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; No hope. The prophet said no hope for him &gt;&gt; because he has taken the mark of the beast &gt;&gt; and there's no redemption &gt;&gt; for you when you take the mark of the beast. &gt;&gt; Is it not amazing church that this story that we are talking about tonight it was only John that recorded it in those four gospels. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; John talked about it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Others they couldn't see that. &gt;&gt; Are you here? Amen. &gt;&gt; Matthew, &gt;&gt; Mark and Luke, they cannot see it. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; But John can see it. &gt;&gt; Because John was an eagle. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He was an eagle. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And he can look and he can see &gt;&gt; and John look like this. And he saw there taking the mark of the beast, departing from the faith, departing from the message, departing from the messenger. And the John saw them that they were taking the mark of the beast. Oh my God. My God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The same John that was the scribe of the book of Revelation. &gt;&gt; That's right, brother. &gt;&gt; The same John that saw the lamb. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Taking the book &gt;&gt; from the eternal one that was sitting on the throne &gt;&gt; and loose the seals and reveal it to the messenger of the egg. And the same John saw his own name. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In the book and scream and shouted. And at Jubilee, oh my God, &gt;&gt; this same John, he saw what people can do that will make them take the mark of the beast. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. Amen. Real good. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are looking for the mark of the beast to be a tattoo. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; It's not a tattoo sir. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Mark of the beast is departed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; From the word, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; Rejecting from the word, &gt;&gt; rejecting the message of your age. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the mark of the beast. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it was well perfectly located in the scripture. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; In John &gt;&gt; 66 66. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Exactly right, brother. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Exactly right. &gt;&gt; That's amazing. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; But brothers, look at you know Peter and the rest of them in verse 68 68 eternity. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He enter into eternity from the days of man. Six. Amen. &gt;&gt; To eternity. &gt;&gt; Are you here? Amen. Now &gt;&gt; eternity. &gt;&gt; From sex to eternity. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; From the days of man, from the ministry of man unto eternity, unto the Holy Ghost, unto the token. Peter can say, answered and said, Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou as the word of eternal life. &gt;&gt; That's it, brother. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; 668. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Eternal life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Somebody tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, I can see Peter say, Lord, to whom shall we go? &gt;&gt; We have reached the point of no return. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. We have entered into eternity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We cannot go back again because we already in eternity. And the we are in eternity. We don't want to go back. Amen. So we have stepped into eternity. I believe you step into eternity tonight. And the brothers, we cannot go back. Oh, glory. Glory to God. [Applause] &gt;&gt; We have reached the point of no return. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Eternity is a circle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You love him tonight. Is a circle. &gt;&gt; We have raised a brother. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I've got my mind mirror &gt;&gt; and I won't turn back. &gt;&gt; I'm going to see my Jesus someday. &gt;&gt; Go by word. &gt;&gt; Go by mark of the beast. Go by the days of man. Go by go by. &gt;&gt; Oh, I've made up my mind &gt;&gt; to go God's way all the rest of my life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Eternity. Yes. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; We have reached &gt;&gt; the point of no return. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; For it is Christ in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The hope of glory. &gt;&gt; How many of you believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But Abraham in Chicago, he preached a message that God had explained. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; And after the service, Dr. Tommy Hicks took the pulpit and he said Christ, &gt;&gt; that's exactly &gt;&gt; in &gt;&gt; the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Are you here with me? &gt;&gt; He said Christ &gt;&gt; in us &gt;&gt; the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; He said we have reached the point of no return. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And brothers, that's exactly what it is. This message is Christ in us, the hope of glory. We have reached the point of no return. How many of you believe with me tonight &gt;&gt; that it is Christ in us, the hope of glory? We have reached the point of no return. Hallelujah, somebody. &gt;&gt; Why, church? Because you know the ministry of Christ is revealing God to us. Are you hearing me? And that's the reason why the message of the hour is Christ. The mystery of God revealed. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? For God was in Christ revealing himself reconciling the word back to himself. God in Christ. And today, brother, Christ is in the church. &gt;&gt; Christ is the mystery of God revealed the church. You and I, we are the mystery of Christ revealed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; Oh brother, Christ in me the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We have reached the point of no return. Is our life is our foundation. &gt;&gt; Is our hope is our rock. Is everything is everything. We can't go back. How can I go back? The songwriter says to the word and do the things that I used to do. Hallelujah. Oh, how can I go back? I cannot go back. Amen. Amen. Do you know one day a woman as we stop here tonight, a woman was returning home from Moab. And this woman's name was Naomi. And this woman, the husband has died. The two sons died and said, "I'm going back home. Enough is enough. I can no longer do this anymore." And immediately the two daughters-in-law, they said, "We are going to go with you." Then the woman turned around and he told them the statement of fact. He said, "Why will you go with me? I have no other child that you should marry. And if you should wait that I give back today, will you be able to wait, you know, for him?" Because you are you are hold. Go back to your God. Go back to your people. Go back. Oh my. The prophet said the gospel preacher, he will lay it on your lap. He say decision time, decision making time. And the hopper, that sounds good. And the hopper kissed the mother-in-law goodbye and went back to the God of her beginning. And when she went back, her name was removed from the book of life. &gt;&gt; She was never mentioned again. &gt;&gt; But the Bible says roots &gt;&gt; cliff unto her. And when the mother-in-law continually persistently, you know, tell me Ruth to go back. Ruth said in chapter one, he said in verse 15, he said, "Entreat me not to leave you." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; For where thou goest, I will go. Where thou lost, I will lodge. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Thy people shall be my people. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Thy God shall be my God. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; May God do so unto me. If nothing but death separates you and me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, I have reached the point of no return. &gt;&gt; I'm not going back anymore. I'm satisfied &gt;&gt; with this glorious truth. I'm satisfied with this message. I'm not going back. I have reached the point of no return. Let other people go back. Let whoever want to go back go back. But brothers, I have reached the point of no return. Hallelujah. And the brothers and sister upon the decision that Ruth made, oh hallelujah. Ruth became the mother. Oh my. Hallelujah. You love him tonight. &gt;&gt; Ruth became the mother of Oed. And the Hob begat Jesse. And Jesse begat David. And David &gt;&gt; begat Jesus. You hallelujah. Oh, what a glorious decision. &gt;&gt; What a glorious decision. And the prophet of the Almighty God made such a glorious decision one day until heaven witnessed to it and said, "Because thou has walk in thy own chosen &gt;&gt; and it is my way. What a glorious decision that thou has made. &gt;&gt; And this in itself is that which shall bring to pass &gt;&gt; the tremendous victory &gt;&gt; in the love divine. &gt;&gt; Brothers, we are waiting for that time. And the friends, if you want to be part of that glorious time, then you got to walk in your own chosen. &gt;&gt; So many thing to distract you, so many thing to take you back. But brothers, you got to be like Elisha following Elijah. And he refused to be discouraged. He refused to be distracted. He said, "No, don't tell me to go back." Hallelujah. I will follow on. Hallelujah. And brothers, we are following on tonight. We are not going to go back. But Abraham said, you take everything. He said, but don't take this one away from us. It is our life. It is our joy. Is our sunshine. Is our breath. Hallelujah. Don't take it away. And I tell you, young brothers, young sister, father, mother, you stay, Hallelujah. on the firing line. Stay with the word of God. Stay with the truth. Stay right here. We have reached the point of no return. Don't let anything distract you. We are going home. God bless you all. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you. God bless you, brother Jack. Oh, what a wonderful God. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. What a wonderful sermon. And um I was just sitting here thinking um this is the last Wednesday night sermon that we'll hear in this place. And the title of the last Wednesday night sermon is that we have reached a point. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; This God is just too perfect. &gt;&gt; I mean, it's just this just just just hits right on the spot. And I mean, we we'd simply say amen to what we heard tonight because um as as brother Gideon was just tracing it through the scripture and I knew he had to come back and bring Peter in. And um uh when when they asked Peter, you know, um I'm I'm sure many of the buddies asked him, "You're going to leave too cuz we all leaving. We gone. We can't take no more of this. We don't understand what he's talking about." Right? And he said, "No, no, I don't understand it. I can't explain it. I ain't never heard these things myself, but I can't go nowhere." &gt;&gt; And then even Jesus himself asked, "Do you want will you also go?" Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Will you leave, too? I mean, y'all, you're free to leave because Jesus didn't try to stop nobody. &gt;&gt; Let them all go. Just God bless you. See you. God bless you. He knew exactly what they was going to do. &gt;&gt; And will you will you go? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Uh what 668? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To whom shall we go? &gt;&gt; Only you have the words of eternal life. And that's the way I feel about this message. &gt;&gt; Where where we going to go? &gt;&gt; I I've come out of Pentecost. I come out of Baptist. I've seen the way that works. &gt;&gt; And I know what this message produces. So, it's no going back for me. &gt;&gt; I am I'm lock, stock, and barrel. &gt;&gt; Right. There's a song There's a song they used to sing back in the old day. I'm tied up, wrapped up, tied up, &gt;&gt; tangled up.

So, I don't check my vehicle like I should. I haven't been lately. And, um, Monday, I was driving back from Palm Bay and it was it was raining real bad. And, uh, as I was driving, the car began to slide from the third lane to the first lane. So, I slowed down a lot. And by the time I got to Blue Heron, the traffic had already built up. So I was getting off on Blue Heron and I was in line. All the vehicles was stopped. The car in front of me, all the traffic began to move and the car in front of me just stayed still. Then it moved about 10 ft real fast and slammed on brakes, but I was moving too and I slammed on brakes and I started sliding again. So by the time I got through that traffic, got on uh Okchobee, getting ready to turn on Sansbury and I was waiting to turn, some vehicles were coming and I tried to take off and tire started spinning. So it gained traction and then it started sliding off the road and the Lord kept me from three accidents. So Tuesday morning, I got up, I went and I looked at my tire and I was like, "Oh man, this front tire on the right, it's looking very bad. It's going ball." So my wife, she had to go ahead and drive to work and I went in um after praying and everything and I was sitting uh at my computer and then a brother text me and he said, "Uh, Brother Solomon, do you need uh help with some tires?" &gt;&gt; I was like I I sat there for a little while and just scratched my head. I said, "Yeah, I just went out and I was looking at my tires and yes, I do." And we kept communicating and um the brother he he bought me four new tires. Yeah, &gt;&gt; the Lord he he kept me and and then he took care of me. &gt;&gt; And I just wanted to thank the Lord. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you. God bless. Um I guess two things. I want to um thank the church for uh keeping Ashley in prayer. um through her sickness. Um she's feeling better, but still not herself. Um and she's hoping to um to recover and be able to come home uh on next weekend. So continue to keep her in prayer. And also I have a um testimony. I had two sisters that were not speaking to each other and over a year they they were they fell out and they weren't speaking to each other, but they of course both were still talking to me. And um this morning they both called me and said, "Sis, we've reconciled and we've um made, you know, peace with our differences." And they were both so happy and I of course I was overjoyed because it was really bothering me and not only me, you know, other family members as well. So it was such a relief and I thank God for restoration and looking forward to more restoration in my family. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless. I'm requesting prayer this weekend. I'm going to a family reunion and some of my family members to South Carolina. So, we're asking for traveling mercy for us and other family members that will be traveling as well. God bless you church. I just want to share uh two testimonies and a prayer request. Uh the first testimony is just want to thank the Lord for uh meeting a financial need that I had uh this month. uh just felt like I was uh really bombarded with a lot of uh different financial responsibilities. Uh but the Lord just uh you know showed himself strong and faithful um and and he met that need for us. Um so encourage anyone that's uh maybe feeling the same that God is faithful. Um the uh other testimony is uh just forgot to share this last last uh two Wednesdays ago. Uh but uh uh I have an older sister. We've prayed for her before. Um she's the the sister of mine that has eight boys. Um her second oldest passed away last year uh in a in a tragic car accident on his birthday. and uh his uh her older son was also in some um law situation, unlawful situation. But anyhow, the testimony is um while her second uh son passed uh we had funeral arrangements uh many things that we were doing um around that time. and she has eight boys uh for a reason and she's always uh desired to have a daughter and I guess just that wasn't the Lord's plans. Um but we uh came to find out that around the time that her second son was uh passed and we were making the arrangements for the funeral, she was actually um uh pregnant and she just gave birth to a baby girl a few weeks ago. Uh so we just thank the Lord for that. We just thought that you know [Applause] and the prayer request as unspoken uh just a need and a situation that came up and just trusting that the Lord will show uh show us favor. God bless you. I just have um I put it in a brother's chat the other day. Um, my baby brother and his wife are having their first child. Um, I think she's 37 weeks. Uh, her blood pressure is high, so they're inducing her. Um, I just I just uh pray just just ask to keep her in prayer. Um, but I know the Lord will bring her through as we we me and my wife went through the same thing. So, I know God is faithfully the same yesterday, today, and forever. Amen. All right, let's take uh this request before the Lord. Uh right. Father, we're grateful for your provision and just all that you have done to show that you're concerned about every need that we have and that you meet every need. Uh thank you for restoration in this family. We knew that this was the season for it. So to start hearing um these testimonies of restoration, God, we it certainly ignites our faith to believe for the impossible even uh during these meetings. Uh we uh thank you for touching Ashley and uh Lord allowing her to come out of the hospital and she wants to be back home next weekend. We believe Lord that you will make a way for her to be here and uh to be well uh as she comes home, God. So ask that you would move uh in her situation. Thank you for your protection for brother Solomon and just uh providing the need uh that he had uh and his family. Lord, we just appreciate all that you do. Ask prayer for sister Brown as they prepare for family union traveling mercies to her and all the other family members that will be on the road. um, Brother Jerry's sister, God, that um, she lost a child but gained one. And, um, God, we we just thank you for just giving her the desires of her heart. And, uh, we ask, God, that you just continue to strengthen uh, that family. Uh, thank you for meeting the uh, financial need that Brother Jerry had, and now there's another need that's come. Uh it's unspoken, but we we know that you know all about it and that God if you did it before, you can do it again. Brother Maris is asking prayer for his um sister-in-law um her blood pressure being high and and preparing to deliver a baby. But God, you you already prove that uh because you watched over Sister Jamaima with the same condition and uh it's a testimony that can go forth to that um uh to that relative to let them know what God can do. So Lord, I pray that as opportunities are presented that Father, they'll be taken and maybe this will be an opportunity someone can draw closer to you because they hear um that you are the same. That God that you you you move uh through prayer and um and God that you uh you answer prayer. So Lord, we just ask that you would just intervene that you just be with them being their first baby. Uh let everything go well uh uh uh for this couple. We trust, oh God, that as we prepare to leave this place that you would go with us. And we thank you for uh this wonderful send off uh the point of no return. Thank you for your servant, brother Gideon, just coming and being led of the Lord to speak, Father, uh this sermon here at this place. And again, so much is happening, Father, in our final days. Things uh that we won't forget. Uh but we just appreciate, Father, just hearing you speak to us. We're so uh convinced that Father, what this what you've sent to us through the revealed word, God is all we need to make it. So uh very grateful that you've given us eyes to see and ears to hear what the spirit is speaking in this hour. I pray your blessings upon your people as they leave this place, but not your presence. Bring us back at the appointed time on Sunday. And father, may you meet us in a very special way. It's in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. God richly bless you. Church, uh we'll prepare to dismiss. Have the brothers come uh to dismiss us. God bless you.
