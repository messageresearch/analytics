========================================
[Music] amen it's good to be in the house of the lord amen to those that are here and those online i have to apologize there was a slight glitch in um getting everything turned on um but we we are here hey man and we're gonna go on uh amen so so i don't be before you too long let us go before the lord is in prayer amen most gracious heavenly father lord we come before you this evening o lord god thanking your father god for your saving grace o father god your healing power lord god revelation of father god that you have bestowed upon us o lord god we thank you lord god for uh all that you have given us we realize that no good gift all good gifts come from you o lord god and we're come up father lord we ask you lord to just open up our understanding where we ask your father god to uh may your spirit flow lord god and to our revelation into our hearts so father god to become closer to you lord by the opening of your word lord we yield all of our faculties to you o father in jesus name we pray amen amen um if you open up in your bible i guess we'll start here and take a reading amen from hebrews the 11th chapter the third verse and we'll also take a reading from the same uh book of hebrews the same chapter 11th chapter and we'll read also from the fifth verse so we'll read straight through amen mental amen and we see here that hebrews 11 amen says that through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear if we can go on down there to the fifth verse it says by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god amen let me the lord add a blessing to the reading of his word amen uh this evening i'd like to take a a little lesson if we will on uh portals into other worlds portals into other worlds we see here amen that uh uh uh that it was brought out here in hebrews the 13th chapter amen it says here that the worlds plural were framed by god now by by by us uh in in in in carnal i would say or in in educational or just our our physical uh what we see we we tend to uh um because we live in this dimension we live in this world we tend to base everything on what we can see taste here smell and one of the old sayings that was just uh um i can only believe what i see you know uh but there is a world that is more real than this world that your eyes can see as we as we live we try to open up our understanding amen uh by the baptism of the holy ghost so that we may be able to see into the other worlds amen we we realized that we uh uh we live here amen but we are oftentimes influenced by of those other those other worlds amen um we see here amen the bible says here in in hebrews the 11th and the seventh verse by faith noah being warned of god of things not seen as of yet that he moved with fear to prepare an art to save to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became heir of righteousness which is by faith so we see there and dressed right there in the no in the in the in in noah's ark the art was a portal into another world those that entered into the ark was translated a man from anteluvian world into a post-anti-deluvian world amen and see the the it says in ii peter that the entrance amen must be ministered unto you amen so they were ministered to a man by the prophet noah and man he was obedient and moved with taste to build an ark because at that time that was the provided way amen to be translated into this world many times we we we we we we we we think and and most people when they think of uh other worlds are being translated they sort of kind of go into a a thing of thinking as a of a geodra geographical location a place that is higher than ours or or many light years light years away we see uh just recently they launched a a hubble telescope amen so that they can be be able to look beyond amen in galaxies what are they looking for what are they looking for the world that they're looking for is right beside them it's just in another dimension but we see that these things are going on we see uh uh uh mr elon musk and and the other fellow there is a thirst right now upon the people amen to to search for another world amen there is a thirst right now in people to become astronauts amen but brother branham described that you are the original astronauts but there is a hunger and a thirst among the world right now to try and be translated into another world when you understand that they they build machineries and and different things to take them to a geographical location that is many miles and light years above amen but they don't realize that if they would just dig into the word and submit themselves to the holy spirit the translation is not a geographical one but a spiritual one to be translated into another world amen by the baptism of the holy ghost through a prophet amen because see it was the anointing that was on noah amen and through the the the word the preaching of noah that his family was able to enter into that portal to be translated into that other world thank god we've had a prophet in this hour amen because in the message chosen of a bride brother branham described it like this he said he said a prophet amen you can't anoint a man to be a prophet he has to be born that way amen he is hand picked by god amen to do a job he's hand-picked because he has certain abilities that god gave him to do what to be a seer to be able to look into other worlds the prophet of god explained it this way he said it's like if we were at a ballpark amen and and we we we that we didn't have money to get into the game to see the game so we're outside on the fence and we couldn't but there is a knot hole in the fence so brother one brother may be just tall enough amen to see into the fence now he didn't give himself that height he didn't just wake up one morning and say i want to be tall no he was it was something that god gave him but put into his dna before he was born that he would be a certain height amen that he can look into that hole and see what's going on on the field so they wanted to see the game they wanted to see what was going on so everybody else because they believed the word of the one that was looking into the eye looking into the hole he they had to believe everything that he was saying okay i'm looking into the hole and i see the batter i see these uniforms there's a black uniform and there's a white uniform there's two teams there's so many people on each team there's an empire and there's this and there's that and one is coming up the back and he's telling he's describing everything but they had to believe and trusted the word and by them believing and trusting in the word of the seer they became division to be translated into the game even though they didn't have money to get in but they were on the outside in another world they were not in the atmosphere of the game because they wasn't inside the stadium they were on the outside amen but there was a prophet amen that had the ability to see because he was ordained to be able to have the stature a man to look through the hole and their job was to believe only believe amen and by them believing the word for that hour they were able to be translated into the game from the outside being on one side or into another world amen they were able to cross over and enter into the atmosphere of the game amen and that's much like we are today amen we live we know that we have five dimensions amen hey man uh uh uh we have the dimension the first dimension which is our first three dimensions which is light matter and time amen these this is the the dimension amen that we live in the dimension that that that that that we're that we we our senses amen are are designed to to to to to live in this world thank you my brother i would everything i we our sight hearing smell taste see i mean identifies with this world so this world what we see is easily amen believable because we see it with our eyes amen but i want you to understand amen that there is a a a fifth dimension amen which is which is described as the underworld it is the region of the lost it is the region of demonic spirits and hell itself amen and then there's another two dimensions above that which is six and the seventh dimension which is the region of the blessed amen the region of of of god and the angels in the sixth and the seventh dimension amen so we're living here in the middle of these dimensions amen and we can be influenced i wanna i wanna i wanna uh uh uh kind of explain it amen it's just like it's just like a baby amen when uh a woman and a man amen decides to come together by holy matrimony amen it's it's lawful amen for them at that time to bring forth a child but before then that child was already there but in another dimension amen that child amen already existed in another world amen but by uh uh the great ordination of god brought these two together amen and by the predestination that child amen began to come forth amen so it moved from a world from a salt amen from a dimension amen a heavenly dimension amen and it moved into the uh another world and moved into the world of ambionic fluid of the mother however that child is is is developing and moved into that world to be developed to do what is being developed and being nourished so that it can survive in this world but however that child is still while it's in the amniotic fluid and in the world amen of that mother it is being influenced by this world many times they say you should sing to your baby while it's in the womb they say the stress of the mother affects the child amen they say what the the things the mother does and and the atmosphere and things affects the development of the child amen so that child even though it's not in this world or in this in this dimension it is effected by this world amen and there is a portal amen that after development after a certain development that that child must go through the birth canal amen to come into this world amen and and and we see it once it's born into this world it comes into this world and begin to rule and guide me began to develop the more translation begin looks and then realizes who its mother is and father is and are beginning to get acclimated with its environment and begin to know how it becomes acclimated amen to this world but we begin to become acclimated with this world amen i want you to understand amen and that child develops and everything like that and but now i want you to understand that now that it is in this world it has the opportunity to be influenced again by another world and that's the point that i'm trying to drive home i have many quotes and many scriptures and different things that i can read to back up you know a lot of what i'm saying but i want you to understand i look at the story of joseph and his brothers joseph uh was a special child he he he had gifts amen that his brother didn't have and and and and they they were jealous of him and and they took him amen and and and and there listen now their goal was to kill him amen they were going to take him and they were going to kill him dead now his brothers were being influenced from another dimension they were being influenced through jealousy and hate from another dimension to try and stop the plan of god amen but what happened is amen they decided a man a man to to to put him in a pit but along came a reuben who said i just can't let him go out like that i can't let him go out like that came and took him amen out of the pit and sold him into slavery see even in the situation where he was his brothers were being influenced and god had a plan for joseph that even the influence of the underworld could not stop the plan of god could not stop the plan of god and i say today that even though you we may see the influence of the underworld on some of our children or or different people our loved ones and and and our associates who we may associate it with amen if they're in the plan of god there's nothing that the devil can do his plan will go forward you see it come because god uh his plan is his purpose amen was his protection amen even though he was being influenced that his brothers were being influenced from another world amen it what it did was it worked right into the hand of god so see see god has always used amen satan to bring forth his will without him even knowing it amen i'm reminded you know when when when he led captivity captain see those those those old soldiers amen that died in the will of the lord amen they went into a holding place called paradise which is called the region of the bless amen or the region i'm sorry the region of the lost amen but he had to go down amen and lead them out amen but what he had to do first he had to cause a man of spirits from the underworld amen to blind amen the the israelites to crucify him amen they were anointed with spirits from below amen to do exactly what they did but god allowed it why so that pe the sacrifice had to be sacrificed they made in order to have a way to go into the region of the bless because sin we were cut off and there was a chasm there amen so he allowed satan amen to to to do what he had to do amen not knowing and understanding that he was working right into the will of god all the time so we see that jesus died on the cross amen went down into the regions of of the of the fifth dimension amen he didn't stop there he went on down amen into the regions of the demons and went all the way down into the region of hell and took the keys amen and set the captives free amen we see that those lower dimensions the fifth dimension uh he abides there but he don't even own his own kingdom he took the keys to death hell and the grave he ain't even got keys to his own house amen but what i want you to see my brothers and sisters is that many times many times we may be disappointed sometime in actions we may look at things from one standpoint [Music] i i i before i go any further i i would want you to know amen that uh second corinthians amen uh the fourth chapter in the 18th verse says while we look not at things which are seen but the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal or eternal so what am i saying here we we we look at amen this dimension that we're living in amen uh of light matter and time amen this this dimension amen this temple it's temporary it is not eternal so and the influences amen that we see that are coming up from hell and causing people to be influenced to do things that might upset us causing people to do things that might be troubling i assure you and i want you to see to begin to look not at the things that they're doing to look not at your brother and your sister as in joseph's situation not at your family as look at this and what they did to me the influence came from another dimension many times that fourth dimension is the is the highway it's the highway by which it's it these things come from and it is the the i call this the channel of communication just as the entrance amen to uh the dimension above must be must be ministered to you and in ministering to you by communication so does these portals are opened up from these lower dimensions through communication amen via music via entertainment via the information super highway via television and things of that nature amen these this is the avenue in which these these portals have been opened into to bring them into this dimension amen recently uh uh they uh had a uh a concert or so appeared and i'm sure many people heard about it this this fellow uh what scott travis or somebody and uh uh uh so many people lost their lives because they opened up portals into another world amen our uh uh people people came to this to this to this concert and entered into uh this atmosphere and there were certain spirits that were released there that caused people to lose their lives in one place call it a satanic feast through and even if you see the the the the video i happen to see it on youtube or somewhere and then even it was like a a portal and by which these spirits uh uh was translated into this into this world amen but i thank god that we have another portal amen it's a spiritual portal amen that we receive i commit by by by revelation that will transform us into another world now let me go on we amen as christians amen we uh uh we have the opportunity we have the right we have the uh responsibility amen that even though we live amen and we among like matter of time in this dimension that through the baptism of the holy spirit and through the preaching of the word of the hour that we don't have to live in this world we can live above this world amen by the holy spirit we can live just a little bit higher why where we don't look at the world the things that are seen but we look at the things that are unseen we live we literally live in a place see that's where that's where our complete rest come in that's where the complete rest come in because even though this is happening over here we're not looking at what's happening over here we're looking at what's causing this over here okay we see that this is not a flesh and blood warfare this is not a flesh and blood battle amen that this is a spiritual battle and we fight it with spiritual things see we don't get caught up in oh well such and such did this to me and such as hut looked at me funny and this person uh wasn't kind to me and this thing we begin when we see things like that begin to come into our heart and things like that we realize that these are influences from another world amen and we would see these things and what we do we have compassion for our brother and sister because we realize if these things are true and this person did this and this person did that and this person did better and that lord they're being influenced that person is under attack from another world spirits from and what we do we go to the father as intercessions on their behalf why because you're not living in this world you're living above this world and the things that you see you don't look at things like everybody else see you look at things different because your mind has been elevated through the preaching of the gospel amen that your eyes of your understanding has been open that you can live this is what happened to enoch by the eyes of his understanding and by his closeness with god he walked with god and just like he you move by the baptism of the holy ghost from one dimension amen you move into an elevated dimension within that dimension but you're right at the door of being translated right at the door of being translated because your mind your thinking your eyes everything is already there only thing you left is your body you live in another dimension i don't look at what's going on around i don't look at the balls i don't look at the money i don't look at these things ah god i'm looking in heavenly i'm looking beyond this this is temporal this is not real although it's real but it's the where i'm living at is more real and i know that this will pass away i know that everything here is being influenced from either beneath or below below or above so i don't get trapped into this many people are in the under open themselves up to demons from below because they don't believe the prophet that's looking through the eye of the nighthold and telling them what's going on so what happened depression sitting malice envy strife why we know what these things are you know the devil is so sneaky and so conniving that he'll do something oh now listen to this he will cause your child anoint your child with the demonic spirit for one reason to bring you down to break to to weaken you and see he's good at what he does he'll systematically do this he'll he'll first he'll bring something from your child or say something wayward to you and then somebody else will say something wayward to you and then you'll run into somebody who cut you off in traffic what is he doing he's weakening you and weakening you and weakening you and weakening you until all of a sudden you just cuss but that's how he does get you so you just constantly constantly constantly ah using everything that he can to get you to that point why he's trying to get you many times the devil used a wayward situation sometime a not filled with the holy spirit [Music] he may do things unseemly and sneak out and begin to be influenced amen by the fashions of this world on other women but let me tell you something his whole goal if he has the mind of that man who would look he has the mind of that woman to cause her to dress in such a way who is he really after he's after that wife he is after that wife but he traveled through these avenues and he'll bring down that woman to make her dress a certain way he'll bring down that man to make him lust after that woman just to get to that wife why because now she's going to pour that spirit into those children i can destroy the whole family but at some point at some point if that man would have looked at that woman that was dressing that way and not saw the woman but see the spirit that's motivating her and say i have to attack the spirit and go down on his knees and say lord anoint my eyes help me o father god he put the enemy to a flight turn his head if he can recognize that there is a spirit from the pits of hell a man that has caused her to dress that way he caused her to dress that way a man to influence you a man to get you if he can get you he can get your wife if he can get the wife he can get the children and for generations and generations and generations portals into other worlds i want us to understand that these things are temporal we have to get to a point in our thinking and in our mind and in our understanding that what we see is not real but it's what we don't see is where it really lies we influence one way or the other amen but we have to get to a point through a portal through a portal into another world which is a heavenly world the same way that baby must come through that portal amen it's water blood then life the same way the christian must come through be baptized through sanctification baptism sanctification and then the holy ghost amen to take it to live amen and did not no no no no no no just like that child you have to be developed that child don't come out and come into this world and perfect many times that child tried to walk and he'll stumble and fall but apparently okay get back up try it again i think i saw a little something with a fella back there was standing up christmas morning one morning or something amen i was sharing with brother simba i can still remember the first time my son walked my wife and i was at a convention church convention we just had a wonderful church service and we came back up to our hotel room and we sat him down on the floor and he's crawling and he had by that time learned how to pull himself up and all of a sudden he pulled himself up and he took a few steps i don't think we went to bed until late that night because we were so excited that he took steps i can still almost remember what we were wearing it was it was it's just a wonderful time but he's developed now to where he can walk work and take care of himself and things of that nature but that's good in this dimension but we still have to develop i still need development you never stop developing amen why because we're trying to go into another world we're trying to our our faculties our thinking and everything that within us to to be translated amen into another world amen that we're in this world but we're not of this world our mind and the way we do things people are amazed i was talking to a co-worker she is one of the upper upper upper managers but she happened to come down and uh out of her big office and and and i was had a conversation because i had to actually go fix some electric in her office and she's telling me about her degree and philosophy and doctor this and that and the other and i say well that's very interesting and she's talking about her education well see i come from another place i'm a minister of the gospel and she said oh really but before she said that she gave this weird look like oh that you can't you can't you can't do that around here i say i can't separate who i am you don't separate who you are i am here for that cause you're the the the the money that i get from here is just a it's just a bonus i am here for that cause i said how can i if i don't be true to him i have to be true to him first before i can be true to you see you relying on everything on your education i don't rely everything on education i rely on my god she began to tell me that she believed in parallel worlds and different things of that nature i say well i tell you what if you believe in that you you just keep on and just cause it's the real it's certainly real certainly real hey man so going on here hey man talking about portals i just want to nail this down let's see here i don't know where my time is pardon me amen oh did it go off already well let me just a few quotes i'm sorry a few quotes brother branham um often referred to this amen um one of the things here i have he often talked about this in a song one of the songs says but there is a land beyond the river that they call that sweet forever and we only reach that shore by a faith decree one by one we gain that portal there to dwell with the immortals someday they'll ring those golden bells for you and for me you see uh uh uh i'd like to just just a portal amen amen uh amen so we experienced by the experience of the prophet and by the teaching of the message we've allowed us to glimpse into the other world of science looking at the moon through a telescope but the message of this day it is not just viewing a viewing window that we can look through to let us see into the world but it has advanced us into that world so we're going it's it's it's it's i was just sharing with my wife it's much more a man of us being able to look into that world science and technology has moved us to a place that we can we can we can we can see in real time through other dimensions we can be teleported in real time through an image our cell phones we have camera view or where we no longer just can just hold the phone to our ear but we can look at the person and what is actually happening someone in another state country or wherever a man can be looking at their phone and you can literally be seeing what they're in real time so what's happening is that the image man that that is picked up by the camera of the phone is being teleported it is going into another world a world that you cannot see it is a information superhighway through the fourth dimension through digital technology and being transposed to your phone in another place you can see it amen but it's just not coming out at you yet but see that's what christ did the same technology but he was able to take it a little further and be real touch me feel my hands but they've got a little bit of it through science amen but we'll take it once we get that glorified body amen and all to another whole level amen but what am i i i'll leave you with this i'll leave you with this the gist of it my brothers and sisters i have so many other quotes and different points that i could bring out on this subject amen is to the things our our battle is not in front of us our battle is not with our brothers and sisters our battles is not with our family members our battle is not with our co-workers our battle is not with the neighbor the grocery store worker or whoever may be in insulted or offended you in any way our battle is against the demonic spirits and you can't fight demonic spirits with carnal weapons and keep yourself guarded that those malice hate envy keep yourself guarded that those spirits don't affect you portals from another world they're here and they're come into this dimension to affect us but we're through that he's using that to they come to affect us but they are used to perfect us amen let us dan thank you amen for your patience amen i hope trust and hope amen that something was said to enlighten you amen to elevate your thinking amen to those online we apologize uh for the late start we had some hiccups here at the school amen but uh we remain faithful amen let us pray most gracious heavenly father we lord thank you o lord god for allowing us lord through the prophet to lord as he look lord god into the not holy lord god and see the future o father god and see those things that we can't see o father god lord he told us to only believe and lord we believe this evening oh god help us lord father to to stay forever mindful of father god that who we
