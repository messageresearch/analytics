[5:18] statement
[5:19] uh sister layton way up in um indiana
[5:22] she put a little story up
[5:24] on facebook this morning it was telling
[5:26] how a lamb got bit by a rattlesnake
[5:29] right in the face
[5:31] she said that the snake's fake not the
[5:34] snake but the lamb's face
[5:37] and swollen up for two days
[5:40] and nothing was wrong with it she said
[5:44] well it was an unknown writer but the
[5:46] writer said
[5:47] that the anti-venom
[5:50] for a snake is in the lamb's blood
[5:55] so that lamb was sitting there with his
[5:57] face swollen for two days
[5:59] so that took me all the way back to
[6:01] calvary it went even back to the garden
[6:03] of eden
[6:04] when that serpent did what he did god
[6:07] had to come down and take a lamb's blood
[6:09] to be a substitute but then after that
[6:12] he had to bring the real lamb on the
[6:14] earth
[6:15] to abolish what the serpent had did amen
[6:18] and said after two days the
[6:20] land was fine he went on about his
[6:21] business jesus has been gone for 2000
[6:24] years

[41:20] just our hearts
[41:23] heavenly father we counted a privilege
[41:26] father we
[41:27] appreciate the opportunity that you've
[41:28] afforded unto us that we could be here
[41:30] this morning
[41:31] we're under great expectation the lord
[41:33] that you would just come and minister to
[41:35] our hearts
[41:36] father i'm reminded of what the prophet
[41:38] said that any man within the ability of
[41:39] his own could flip back the pages of the
[41:41] bible
[41:42] and read from the scriptures but it
[41:44] takes the lamb of god the god
[41:46] to come on the scene and break bread
[41:48] with us for us to receive the
[41:50] revealed word of truth father may you
[41:53] come and speak to our hearts this
[41:54] morning whatever we have need of the god
[41:56] we
[41:57] we committed into your hands father we
[42:00] ask that you just take full control of
[42:01] the
[42:02] service those that are in need those
[42:04] that are sick those that are down
[42:06] those that are a disheartened lord
[42:09] father there's nothing too big or too
[42:10] small that you can't cater to
[42:13] we commit all things into your hands
[42:16] have preeminence in the service the lord
[42:18] any spirit that's contrary to your
[42:19] spirit may be dismissed from this place
[42:22] give your people liberty to worship you
[42:24] and spirit in the truth
[42:27] because the bible says he who the son
[42:28] has set free
[42:30] is free indeed and father we believe
[42:33] that we are free people
[42:35] we're no longer bound to the bondage of
[42:37] sin
[42:39] bound to the bondage of fear but father
[42:42] you have broken those
[42:43] chains and you've set us free
[42:46] thank you for the grace that you've
[42:47] shown unto us we commit all things into
[42:50] your hands
[42:51] and this little bride says amen
[42:54] amen god bless you saints certainly get
[42:57] to be back in the house of the lord
[42:58] if you wouldn't mind grab your bibles
[43:01] your ipads your phones whatever you use
[43:04] we have different ways of using our
[43:06] swords nowadays
[43:08] turn with me to ephesians chapter 2.
[43:11] certainly appreciate
[43:12] always appreciate the opportunity to be
[43:14] here a special treat with
[43:16] my family being able to visit last time
[43:18] i talked about them this time they're
[43:20] actually here with me
[43:22] so amen so just really appreciate them
[43:27] being with us
[43:28] and you know trying to adjust to
[43:30] fatherhood because um
[43:32] you know trying to calculate the time i
[43:33] need to be here what time they got to
[43:34] get up and
[43:35] feeding them and you know things just
[43:38] don't work out the way you kind of
[43:39] envision it you know you
[43:41] you know you're chasing after a shoe you
[43:43] put one in the car the other one takes
[43:44] off running and it's just
[43:46] but by god's grace we're here amen so
[43:50] just appreciate brother jack just uh
[43:53] opening up his door and just uh giving
[43:55] us the privilege to be here this morning
[43:57] amen so bear with me i got a thought
[43:59] this morning that i'd like to minister
[44:01] on
[44:02] and um and uh so i feel that we may be
[44:06] all over the place but just kind of bear
[44:08] with my thoughts
[44:10] so bear with my thoughts i i know where
[44:11] i want to go so just kind of bear with
[44:13] me i got a couple of scriptures laying
[44:15] here and there
[44:16] so um so um so just kind of bear with me
[44:19] so we'll have an opening scripture and
[44:21] i'll let you have your seat so ephesians
[44:23] chapter 2 starting at verse 1
[44:28] and it reads and you hath he quickened
[44:32] who were dead in trespasses and sins
[44:35] wherein time passed ye walked according
[44:38] to the course of this world
[44:41] according to the prince of the power of
[44:43] the air
[44:44] the spirit that now worketh in the
[44:46] children of disobedience
[44:48] among whom also we paul including
[44:52] himself
[44:53] all had our conversation in times past
[44:57] and the lusts of our flesh fulfilling
[44:59] the desires of the flesh
[45:01] and of the mind and were by nature
[45:05] the children of wrath even as others
[45:09] and i love the scripture but god
[45:14] who is rich in mercy for his great
[45:18] love worth he loved us that's an
[45:22] outstanding scripture
[45:25] even now listen to this even when
[45:28] we were dead and sins hath quickened
[45:32] us together with christ by grace
[45:36] are ye saved and last verse
[45:40] and hath raised us up together
[45:44] and made us sit together
[45:48] in heavenly places in christ jesus
[45:52] may the lord have this blessing to the
[45:54] reading of the word you may be seated
[45:59] my just trying to find a a place to
[46:01] start with this
[46:02] but my thought this morning is
[46:06] elevation that god
[46:10] called you to an elevated place
[46:15] and i'm going to walk you through
[46:17] certain god bless you brother keith
[46:19] i'm going to walk you through certain um
[46:22] parts of the scriptures where god's
[46:25] efforts
[46:27] for his people was to elevate them rise
[46:30] them up
[46:31] above a place that they shouldn't be or
[46:34] think they ought to be
[46:37] and i use this scripture because it's
[46:39] one of the scriptures that i've
[46:41] i draw myself to because it's just it's
[46:43] so meaningful because
[46:45] we could relate to it in so many ways
[46:49] because paul begins to kind of outline
[46:52] the scripture if you will
[46:54] and you have the quickened who were dead
[46:58] in trespasses and sins
[47:01] that was our way many years ago in some
[47:04] cases that might be our way now
[47:06] so it's not too late we still got grace
[47:10] wherein in time past you walked
[47:12] according
[47:13] to the course of this world this world
[47:16] is on a course and it's on a collision
[47:18] course
[47:20] and so it's going on a journey and we
[47:23] we followed the herd where wherever our
[47:26] boys went we went with them wherever our
[47:28] the girls went we went with them so we
[47:30] followed the world
[47:33] but paul was cautious in saying that was
[47:35] in time past
[47:38] so for the believers who could believe
[47:40] that and knows that that's true we all
[47:42] could say
[47:43] amen i heard a few so we're going to
[47:45] work on the others
[47:48] amen because that was my past that's not
[47:50] my present
[47:53] satan could tell you all about my past
[47:55] and i could tell saying about his future
[47:57] and he doesn't like that
[48:01] so we walked a certain way we talked
[48:04] a certain way we dressed a certain way
[48:06] we conducted ourselves a certain way but
[48:09] all that was in the past
[48:12] where in time past you walked according
[48:14] to the course of this world according
[48:16] to the prince of the power of the air
[48:19] the prince
[48:20] of the power of the air so there was an
[48:22] anointing
[48:23] in the atmosphere that we got caught up
[48:26] in the atmosphere we got caught up in
[48:28] the environment we got caught up with
[48:30] what was happening
[48:32] when we were in the world we went out
[48:34] clubbing we got caught up
[48:36] in the atmosphere of the club
[48:39] when we were at the ball games we got
[48:40] caught up in the atmosphere of the ball
[48:43] games
[48:45] that's just how it was because there was
[48:48] an anointing
[48:50] behind everything there's an anointing
[48:53] be careful things without everything
[48:56] that's what we ought to be careful and
[48:57] discern the spirit to know which is of
[48:59] god
[49:00] and which is not of god because the
[49:01] bible says wall to them that call evil
[49:04] good
[49:04] and good evil this is talking about this
[49:08] thing
[49:08] people are so confused they don't know
[49:10] what good is and they don't know what
[49:12] evil is
[49:12] but by god's grace i could look god in
[49:15] the
[49:16] word and i know the difference between
[49:18] good
[49:20] and evil it's so deceptive it's so
[49:24] it's it's a gray area that we're living
[49:26] in
[49:28] but unless you look at things to the
[49:29] filter of god's words you could easily
[49:31] see
[49:32] what's going on
[49:36] so the bible goes on to say the spirit
[49:39] that
[49:39] now worketh in the children of
[49:42] disobedience
[49:44] amongst whom also we paul
[49:47] included himself because he realized
[49:49] that even as the first church age
[49:51] messenger
[49:51] he needed a savior
[49:55] paul was not born a christian
[49:58] he was he was not born saying thus said
[50:01] the lord
[50:02] he was not born saying hallelujah he was
[50:04] not born teaching grace
[50:06] he had to learn these things
[50:10] so we had our conversations again he
[50:12] reminds you
[50:13] in the times past the lust of the flesh
[50:17] fulfilling the desires of the flesh and
[50:19] of the mind
[50:20] if we thought about it it felt good we
[50:23] did it we didn't care about the
[50:24] consequences we didn't care about who
[50:27] who we offended we didn't care about
[50:29] what we said how we said it what we did
[50:31] how we did it we just did it
[50:33] that was our lives back then that was
[50:36] who we are
[50:41] and we're by nature
[50:45] the children of wrath
[50:48] we were born with a certain nature now
[50:51] here's my point
[50:52] we were born with a certain fallen
[50:56] nature
[51:00] we don't have to teach you no one ever
[51:02] taught you how to lie you just knew how
[51:04] to cover your tracks
[51:06] like i gotta cover myself this is wrong
[51:08] right here
[51:10] no one taught you that you just learned
[51:12] you just you just learned how to do that
[51:13] because you know the consequences
[51:17] so we came with the we were born with
[51:20] the
[51:20] fallen nature
[51:24] and so even as we were born with the
[51:26] fallen nature and bear with me as i kind
[51:28] of build on this
[51:29] even as we were born with the fallen
[51:31] nature
[51:33] ours we would just our lives felt like
[51:36] it was
[51:37] shattered in a million pieces
[51:40] we had no sense of direction no purpose
[51:44] we were just going with the wind
[51:48] because it felt good we did it we went
[51:49] in that direction we just
[51:51] flowed as it as civilization flowed we
[51:53] just flow
[51:54] we went the course of the world
[51:57] and all the meanwhile when you were
[52:00] drinking your beer
[52:02] smoking your cigarettes running in the
[52:05] clubs
[52:06] god looked at you said i made the right
[52:08] decision about you
[52:14] when you had nothing to do with god god
[52:17] says you know what
[52:18] he think he's going someplace but i'm
[52:20] about to bring him around
[52:23] and that's the reason why paul
[52:25] understood that because he had letters
[52:27] to risk
[52:27] to arrest the christians but then he
[52:29] realized that god
[52:31] stepped in and intervened he realized
[52:34] the divine intervention of god and
[52:36] therefore he could say
[52:37] god who is rich and mercy not only god
[52:41] who is merciful
[52:42] but god who is rich in mercy because
[52:44] when people look down on you
[52:45] god look beyond that
[52:49] god went to you where others couldn't
[52:51] reach you at
[52:59] and we were dead in sins as he quickened
[53:03] us together with christ
[53:06] and he raised us up together elevated us
[53:11] brought us up and have us sitting
[53:15] in heavenly places in christ jesus
[53:19] now i start by saying this
[53:26] we live in this
[53:29] earth and we're reminded
[53:34] because of where we're at
[53:38] that there's a gravitational pull that
[53:41] brings us down
[53:46] that's the reason why and i'm gonna say
[53:48] things that you already know
[53:50] that when we try to jump up
[53:53] we fall down
[53:56] because there's an unseen force called
[54:00] gravity
[54:01] that keeps bringing us down
[54:06] and and it's it's not
[54:10] in man to be grounded it's not
[54:15] we're never satisfied
[54:18] now follow what i'm saying just to be
[54:20] grounded
[54:23] from the dawn of mankind we've always
[54:25] looked up
[54:27] and we we we wondered what was in the
[54:31] heavens
[54:33] and there was there was a hunger
[54:36] within us that we want it to be elevated
[54:39] a little bit higher
[54:43] and as a result of this men
[54:46] try different ways to tap into
[54:50] how can they elevate themselves both
[54:53] naturally emotionally physically
[54:57] so y'all bear with me but it is
[55:00] his intent because every time he tries
[55:03] to go up
[55:04] something pushes him down
[55:09] and it's it's a it's a gravitational
[55:12] force that keeps man grounded to the
[55:15] earth
[55:16] and so much that in our failures that
[55:19] our head
[55:20] is hung down low because
[55:23] because we we because something
[55:27] doesn't want you to look up
[55:31] it's a lot easier to just walk with your
[55:33] head down
[55:36] to look at your problems to look at your
[55:39] failures and can't see your success
[55:43] can't see your promise
[55:47] and so we walk around with this attitude
[55:49] but every once in a while
[55:53] someone and we've seen this in history
[55:56] comes along
[55:57] and says i want to go beyond just
[55:59] looking at
[56:00] these failures that i see
[56:04] and so we see that man crafted
[56:07] some means and they invented an airplane
[56:14] they put together the instruments
[56:18] and perhaps the first flight was
[56:20] probably nothing
[56:23] barely off the ground but man
[56:27] what an achievement it was
[56:30] that man is not beginning to take a step
[56:34] further and so he realizes
[56:39] that man i could go a little bit beyond
[56:42] just being grounded to my circumstance
[56:48] so over time man has
[56:51] refined and updated
[56:56] the airplane to which now we don't think
[56:59] much about it
[57:00] and we fly 30 000 35 000 feet up in the
[57:03] air
[57:04] it's nothing to us
[57:07] but there is still yet
[57:11] that gravitational pull that reminds me
[57:14] that even though you could fly for a
[57:16] number of hours
[57:17] you're gonna have to bring that object
[57:19] down called the airplane
[57:25] but yeah there's a there's an unyielding
[57:29] desire within man to say you know what i
[57:31] need to break beyond
[57:34] just the earthly atmosphere there's
[57:36] something greater in the skies
[57:40] about that things let me pause there for
[57:41] a moment if that is man's
[57:43] motivation how much more should your
[57:46] motivation be
[57:50] martin luther would not stand for what
[57:52] the catholics had to preach
[57:53] he said there's something much greater
[57:55] than you hiding the bible from me
[57:59] so he had to take a flight he had to go
[58:02] higher than what the
[58:03] what was being preached back then he had
[58:05] to be elevated a little bit higher
[58:13] so the man comes along and he builds
[58:17] a space shuttle he says we need to go
[58:20] beyond the atmosphere
[58:24] where the gravitational pull is less
[58:27] intense
[58:32] and we realize that through many of the
[58:35] efforts
[58:36] to try to go to the moon or go into
[58:39] outer space
[58:40] there were a lot of failures along the
[58:42] way
[58:44] not everything you do is straight
[58:46] success
[58:48] there are some there are some minor
[58:50] setbacks
[58:51] that's also in the bible we'll talk
[58:53] about that
[58:56] but man was relentless that was the
[58:59] spirit within men
[59:01] and he built this space shuttle but he
[59:04] had to study the atmosphere and all
[59:06] these different things
[59:08] and ultimately man refused to be
[59:10] grounded
[59:12] he says we appreciate what we've done
[59:14] through aviation
[59:15] but now we need to venture into the
[59:17] space age
[59:19] and so man build a space shuttle
[59:22] and they broke through the earth's
[59:24] atmosphere
[59:27] in the orbit around earth
[59:30] and man what what what a what an
[59:32] astonishing
[59:33] achievement think about it having gone
[59:35] from i can't tell you my my grandmother
[59:37] my great-grandmother could never
[59:38] realize that we would have been in space
[59:42] and here we are yeah that gravitational
[59:47] pull is still strong enough
[59:48] that reminds man you could only be in
[59:50] space but for so long
[59:52] you need to come back
[59:56] oh wesley took us a little bit higher
[1:00:01] beyond luther and said we need to be
[1:00:04] sanctified
[1:00:05] we need to go beyond justification we
[1:00:07] need to be sanctified
[1:00:09] so it took us a little bit higher
[1:00:13] and pentecost sweeped up and took us a
[1:00:15] little bit higher
[1:00:20] today man
[1:00:24] has not ventured and says you know what
[1:00:26] we need to go beyond
[1:00:29] what's within our immediate surrounding
[1:00:32] let's go see what's out there in mars
[1:00:39] and even not recently they're trying to
[1:00:41] you know they're trying to
[1:00:42] have uh where you know um i forget his
[1:00:45] name escaped me but they
[1:00:46] taking uh people to around the earth and
[1:00:49] uh space flight and they're trying to
[1:00:51] commercialize it it's just it's just
[1:00:53] it's just the times that we're living in
[1:00:54] it's it's the moment
[1:00:57] it had to have been this moment because
[1:00:58] there's there as much as there's a
[1:01:00] desire with men to go higher
[1:01:02] there's a desire with me to step a
[1:01:04] little bit higher
[1:01:11] but we realize the reason why it's
[1:01:15] important
[1:01:16] for us to be elevated is because
[1:01:19] our views of things are completely
[1:01:23] different
[1:01:27] our views of things the way we see
[1:01:29] things are completely different
[1:01:31] when you're grounded all you see is
[1:01:33] what's immediately
[1:01:34] in front of you and your judgment
[1:01:38] your criticism your observation is only
[1:01:41] around your immediate surroundings
[1:01:45] but the moment that you're elevated just
[1:01:48] a little bit higher
[1:01:50] you see things that others don't see
[1:01:56] so therefore you react differently
[1:02:01] we to use an example before we have the
[1:02:04] instruments that we have
[1:02:06] now that's able to tell that there's an
[1:02:08] oncoming storm
[1:02:09] we wouldn't have known how to prepare
[1:02:11] for a storm
[1:02:14] we would have went back we would have
[1:02:15] went around our daily business like it
[1:02:17] was nobody else's business
[1:02:21] we would have felt something in the air
[1:02:22] but we would have no idea
[1:02:25] that there was a storm coming we would
[1:02:28] have just
[1:02:29] lived our daily lives but the moment
[1:02:31] that we're not able to tap and see
[1:02:34] in the distance that there's a storm
[1:02:36] coming we begin to react
[1:02:38] differently even though it's calm
[1:02:46] even though the sun is shining
[1:02:50] even though there's not a cloud in the
[1:02:52] sky
[1:02:53] i'm living in a different dimension i
[1:02:55] see the storm coming
[1:02:57] you might criticize me but my family and
[1:03:00] i we are getting ready
[1:03:04] i see things that the world doesn't see
[1:03:07] you see things
[1:03:09] that the world has no idea they might
[1:03:12] laugh at you they might criticize you
[1:03:15] they might talk about you but it doesn't
[1:03:17] matter
[1:03:18] i see the oncoming storm
[1:03:25] the world is trying to conform
[1:03:28] that is not what my message is my
[1:03:30] message is to be
[1:03:32] transformed that's what the bible tells
[1:03:34] me
[1:03:39] but the sun is shining the sky is blue
[1:03:44] and meanwhile there's a storm that's
[1:03:46] brewing out there
[1:03:49] but we're elevated we have a message of
[1:03:53] certainty and we know that the storm
[1:03:56] is coming it's much more than the
[1:04:00] feeling that we have
[1:04:05] but we can see it for ourselves
[1:04:09] so being elevated gives you an
[1:04:12] understanding that others don't have
[1:04:17] it gives you depth that others don't
[1:04:20] have
[1:04:21] it gives you knowledge that others don't
[1:04:24] have
[1:04:24] it gives you insight that others don't
[1:04:27] have
[1:04:29] that's the reason why the bible says
[1:04:31] you're seated in heavenly places
[1:04:34] in christ jesus
[1:04:37] you know the bible talks about
[1:04:41] how there are levels when god
[1:04:45] he stepped out of heaven
[1:04:48] he stepped into earth
[1:04:52] and he entered manifested himself in a
[1:04:55] body we call
[1:04:56] jesus
[1:05:01] and then not only did he walk around
[1:05:03] earth
[1:05:05] but he went to the grave because
[1:05:09] something was pulling him down
[1:05:12] so he went down to the grave
[1:05:15] and because he bore your sins and my
[1:05:17] sins
[1:05:19] he went to hell think about that
[1:05:22] god came from heaven to earth
[1:05:26] to the grave to hell
[1:05:30] hell was our destination
[1:05:34] and on his way up he was reversing the
[1:05:38] whole process again
[1:05:42] so that way we wouldn't have to go to
[1:05:44] hell
[1:05:45] we would have to go to a place called
[1:05:48] the fire of lake and brimstone
[1:05:52] so he rose up he went out of hell
[1:05:56] he conquered the grave
[1:05:59] he visited earth and went right back to
[1:06:02] heaven and so much that jesus says i go
[1:06:04] and prepare a place for you
[1:06:08] so we realize it's not our intent
[1:06:13] to be grounded but god has called us
[1:06:17] for some place a little bit higher
[1:06:21] there's no place in the scripture where
[1:06:22] that's true
[1:06:24] where the bible talks about the prodigal
[1:06:26] son
[1:06:28] and you know the story very well
[1:06:31] and i'll kind of kind of go through it
[1:06:34] real quickly
[1:06:36] so the bible talks about that this man
[1:06:37] had two sons
[1:06:40] and the younger of them says father look
[1:06:41] give me my portion i'm out of here
[1:06:45] and he divided on unto them his living
[1:06:48] and not many days because of some men
[1:06:50] think about he's like you know what
[1:06:52] not many days he gathered all his stuff
[1:06:55] and he went to a journey
[1:06:57] into a far country and there are ways to
[1:07:01] do substance with righteous living so
[1:07:03] think about this picture he left his
[1:07:05] status he left his position
[1:07:08] he was in a good place
[1:07:11] he had access to all the promises he had
[1:07:14] access to everything that god
[1:07:16] could afford him but yet he was
[1:07:19] interested
[1:07:20] in what the world had to offer
[1:07:25] so he gathered this he gathered all his
[1:07:27] stuff
[1:07:29] and when he had spent all
[1:07:34] after he spent all the bible says
[1:07:38] there arose a mighty famine in the land
[1:07:43] there was no famine in the land why he
[1:07:45] had money in his pocket
[1:07:48] because as long as he had money in his
[1:07:50] pocket
[1:07:52] then there's probably no need for god
[1:07:55] so therefore he could just hand it out
[1:07:58] i'm good i got my cars i got my house
[1:08:02] i got my job i got my bonus i'm good
[1:08:06] god knows how to change that
[1:08:12] i don't know what my father was thinking
[1:08:13] i'm good i got all the money that i
[1:08:14] needed i got my portion
[1:08:18] and notice the father never even stopped
[1:08:22] him
[1:08:24] so after he spent it all
[1:08:27] every bit of it there arose
[1:08:31] a mighty famine not even just a famine a
[1:08:33] mighty famine out there
[1:08:36] and so he probably got laid off from his
[1:08:38] job the bonus weren't coming in
[1:08:40] he couldn't pay his electric he couldn't
[1:08:43] pay the mortgage
[1:08:44] the car was going to get repolled times
[1:08:46] were tough
[1:08:49] let me tell you if someone was once in
[1:08:51] the favor of god
[1:08:53] and they leave god and they're going
[1:08:56] through
[1:08:56] trouble i'm gonna be delicate and i'll
[1:08:59] say this
[1:09:00] i am not trying to find pity on that
[1:09:02] person
[1:09:04] because if god's dealing with them let
[1:09:07] god
[1:09:07] deal with them
[1:09:10] [Applause]
[1:09:12] because the bible says i lose not one
[1:09:15] that the father has given me if you
[1:09:17] think you could just leave and walk out
[1:09:20] be careful of your decision because if
[1:09:22] you're part of god
[1:09:23] you won't go too far before you come
[1:09:25] back it might be with the broken leg
[1:09:28] it might be with the broken arm it might
[1:09:30] be with one eye
[1:09:31] it might be with the prime broken but
[1:09:33] god's gonna take whatever he needs
[1:09:36] to bring you right back
[1:09:48] so he was down under he was down to the
[1:09:51] lowest that he could get
[1:09:55] there was a mighty famine and he began
[1:09:58] to be
[1:10:00] in want when you want
[1:10:03] something you lack it
[1:10:06] the lord is my shepherd i shall not want
[1:10:08] i've always got confused with them like
[1:10:09] why wouldn't i ever want the lord to be
[1:10:10] my shepherd
[1:10:11] boy i misunderstood that it was the lord
[1:10:14] is my shepherd i should not lack
[1:10:16] i'm like well that makes more sense as
[1:10:18] long as he's my shepherd i'm never going
[1:10:20] to win anything because he's going to
[1:10:21] give me everything
[1:10:22] he's my portion
[1:10:30] and there was a mighty famine that he
[1:10:33] began to
[1:10:34] want let me tell you when a man is in a
[1:10:36] desperate state
[1:10:39] sometimes you make irrational decisions
[1:10:43] hasty decisions incorrect decisions
[1:10:48] unscriptural decision
[1:10:51] lack of prayer decisions
[1:10:56] praise the lord when you're in a
[1:10:58] desperate state because you're looking
[1:11:00] at your families in your eyes
[1:11:02] and you know you've made the wrong
[1:11:03] decision
[1:11:08] but you're too important to god for him
[1:11:10] to lose you
[1:11:12] he's invested too much in you you might
[1:11:15] be bad out there saying i'm going to go
[1:11:16] out there and just do what i want to do
[1:11:18] all right
[1:11:22] you never want to test god you can hold
[1:11:25] a man back
[1:11:26] but you can't hold god back
[1:11:34] and the bible says then he went and he
[1:11:36] joined himself to a citizen of that
[1:11:38] country
[1:11:40] just join any fellowship just join in
[1:11:43] like it's like i'll do anything
[1:11:45] and they send them to the fields to feed
[1:11:48] the swine
[1:11:50] this is royal blood that's mingling with
[1:11:54] pigs
[1:12:00] imagine me raising the palace and
[1:12:03] thinking that you know it all
[1:12:05] and next thing you know you find
[1:12:06] yourself feeding right next to the pigs
[1:12:10] he was desperate for a job he's like
[1:12:12] look man just give me a job i just need
[1:12:13] something i just
[1:12:14] i i'll do anything i got to take care of
[1:12:16] my family i lost my house i lost my car
[1:12:18] i lost my job i need anything
[1:12:20] he's like why i got some pigs over there
[1:12:22] they need some feeding wouldn't have
[1:12:24] pigs ever need to be fair all you gotta
[1:12:25] do is just
[1:12:29] is that we got some pigs over there
[1:12:34] because of his desperation he
[1:12:35] compromised
[1:12:41] he's like i'll do it he's like yeah i
[1:12:44] don't have that much to pay because you
[1:12:45] know the famine in the land and things
[1:12:46] are kind of scarce i'm paying 10 cents a
[1:12:48] week
[1:12:49] he had to swallow his pride
[1:12:54] be humble because god knows how to break
[1:12:57] you down
[1:13:01] so he didn't even put up a fight and he
[1:13:04] went and drove himself to assist and he
[1:13:05] sent him to
[1:13:06] into the fields to feed swine and he
[1:13:09] would feign
[1:13:10] have filled his belly with the husk that
[1:13:13] the swine
[1:13:14] did eat because no man gave
[1:13:17] unto him he's sitting there eating with
[1:13:19] swines
[1:13:25] he know better than to look at the pigs
[1:13:26] himself and thought about pork chops
[1:13:28] because that's that's what would have
[1:13:30] came all mine
[1:13:32] but that even the pigs didn't belong to
[1:13:33] him it belonged to the guy
[1:13:36] so he had to eat the husks and different
[1:13:38] things
[1:13:39] can you just imagine just eating all
[1:13:42] this
[1:13:42] filth the dirtiness
[1:13:46] sometimes god has to bring you to your
[1:13:49] lowest point
[1:13:51] when you're just truly grounded but that
[1:13:54] is not the place
[1:13:56] you deserve that is not what god
[1:13:59] envisioned for you that is not his
[1:14:01] purpose for you
[1:14:02] satan was rejoicing when he saw that
[1:14:05] this young man
[1:14:06] was in the walla was in the was in the
[1:14:09] muck was in all these type of filth
[1:14:11] he rejoiced with that because that's
[1:14:12] what he expected to see
[1:14:17] and i love this part of the scripture
[1:14:20] when he's at the lowest point of his
[1:14:22] life
[1:14:23] when you can't go any lower when you're
[1:14:26] right there
[1:14:27] in the midst of the pigs and the swines
[1:14:30] and you're eating
[1:14:31] uh all these things the bible says
[1:14:34] he came to himself
[1:14:42] he came to himself
[1:14:46] he was broken shattered
[1:14:50] torn up his pride was broken
[1:14:55] his attitude was broken his ways was
[1:14:58] broken
[1:15:00] god humbled him and there he was
[1:15:04] down in the muck in the wallow
[1:15:07] in the in the in the in the filth
[1:15:11] dirty horrible
[1:15:16] if a man was to walk by him they
[1:15:18] probably wouldn't even recognize who he
[1:15:20] was
[1:15:22] that was my life that was your life
[1:15:27] at one time we probably did i wouldn't
[1:15:29] have even recognized who you were in the
[1:15:30] world
[1:15:33] because you're so blended in with the
[1:15:35] people of the world and the things of
[1:15:36] the world
[1:15:38] the language of the world the conduct of
[1:15:40] the world
[1:15:41] your behaviors the way you acted i
[1:15:44] wouldn't have recognized who you are
[1:15:46] but thank god i'm not concerned about
[1:15:49] who you are
[1:15:50] i'm only appreciate who you are now
[1:15:55] he came to himself not because of
[1:15:58] what he realized but everything that his
[1:16:00] dad
[1:16:01] instilled within him
[1:16:04] never departed from him
[1:16:08] every lesson that he learned from his
[1:16:10] dad never departed from him
[1:16:13] that even in his worst estate he was
[1:16:16] eating
[1:16:17] he probably was one by the way saying
[1:16:19] man this is delicious i could i could
[1:16:20] cope with this
[1:16:22] and then he thought by he's like wait a
[1:16:24] minute
[1:16:27] just just at a moment just just had that
[1:16:29] that realizations like
[1:16:31] what in the world is going on here
[1:16:35] i can only just imagine that she's
[1:16:36] standing and he's flicking all these
[1:16:38] pigs around
[1:16:39] it's like what am i doing here
[1:16:44] does this guy know who my dad is
[1:16:48] do i even know who my dad is
[1:16:56] he had a revelation he's like why am i
[1:16:59] what am i doing here
[1:17:01] he never kicked me out i left
[1:17:05] big difference he never kicked me out
[1:17:11] and now here's oink oink oink
[1:17:15] this is my my
[1:17:18] my dad has a palace
[1:17:22] there's rooms in there my brother's over
[1:17:25] there
[1:17:26] there's food over there why am i eating
[1:17:29] this
[1:17:30] and one pig probably looked at him like
[1:17:32] i would have eaten you you would have
[1:17:33] been on my table
[1:17:36] he came to himself
[1:17:40] let me tell you when a when a believer
[1:17:43] could realize
[1:17:44] who they are if you could just
[1:17:47] if you could just for a moment the fear
[1:17:50] that
[1:17:50] overcomes when you get up in the morning
[1:17:53] and you realize that i'm a child of god
[1:17:56] i'm a son of a king
[1:18:01] all devils in hell begin to tremble
[1:18:05] that was the first step of being
[1:18:06] elevated there he was
[1:18:08] he stood up you got to rise up and look
[1:18:11] at the situation around you say what am
[1:18:13] i doing
[1:18:14] in this situation i don't belong here
[1:18:18] heaven i'm just this earth is not my
[1:18:21] home i'm just
[1:18:21] a passing through i don't belong here
[1:18:26] i'm just a pilgrim i'm just a passing
[1:18:28] through this is not my home
[1:18:33] that was the first realization that was
[1:18:35] the first step of rising above
[1:18:38] his circumstance he looked he's like
[1:18:43] i don't immediately
[1:18:47] the bible says he comes to himself and
[1:18:50] he begins to reflect how many hired
[1:18:52] servants of my fathers have bread enough
[1:18:55] and spare and i perish with hunger
[1:19:01] and in verse 18 he says our eyes
[1:19:05] elevated and go to my father's house
[1:19:11] you know what's so important about that
[1:19:12] one scripture
[1:19:14] the bible says in here rose and came to
[1:19:16] his father's house and the bible says
[1:19:18] but yet
[1:19:20] when he was a great way
[1:19:23] like he was in the distance he's made
[1:19:26] his decision to go back to the father's
[1:19:28] house
[1:19:30] the father was right there waiting
[1:19:31] anticipating that at any moment
[1:19:34] his son would come right back to him
[1:19:38] [Applause]
[1:19:40] just watching from a great distance
[1:19:44] the moment you've made up your mind when
[1:19:45] i made up my mind i say you know what
[1:19:47] i'm no
[1:19:47] i'm tired of this world i'm tired of the
[1:19:50] things of this world
[1:19:52] god has already turned his sight
[1:19:55] directly to me
[1:19:56] and he was marching in my direction just
[1:19:58] as much as i was marching in his
[1:20:00] direction
[1:20:01] and two forces collided and god
[1:20:05] picked me up what an elevation for you
[1:20:08] and i
[1:20:09] we were meant to be grounded but god has
[1:20:11] got us to elevate
[1:20:20] ten minutes there's a another person in
[1:20:23] the scripture
[1:20:27] you find joseph y'all know the story
[1:20:31] well
[1:20:32] he was loved of his father hated
[1:20:36] of his brethren and so
[1:20:40] his brethren decide to conspire
[1:20:44] and they made it seem they sold them
[1:20:48] to slavery and they went back to the
[1:20:51] father with the coats of many colors
[1:20:53] and they said wild beasts must have
[1:20:56] killed joseph
[1:20:57] look at this it's drenched in blood
[1:21:00] oh his father was so distraught
[1:21:04] and joseph was sold
[1:21:08] and he was in the house of potiphar
[1:21:12] think about it he left from his father's
[1:21:14] house
[1:21:16] he went out to the fields to meet his
[1:21:17] brethren his brethren
[1:21:19] betrayed him and then he was sold into
[1:21:21] slavery
[1:21:23] talking about falling from a place of a
[1:21:26] place of comfort
[1:21:28] where everything was where he was
[1:21:30] comfortable with his surroundings his
[1:21:31] parents his
[1:21:32] his his brethren and his his whole at
[1:21:35] his own environment
[1:21:36] and all that just stripped away from him
[1:21:39] and now he's in this
[1:21:40] unknown place this unknown land
[1:21:44] and he tumbled and there he was
[1:21:47] in pontiff's house a prisoner
[1:21:51] in pontiff's house but everything that
[1:21:53] joseph touched
[1:21:54] was blessed
[1:21:58] you know what my prayer is every morning
[1:22:00] now before i go to work before i
[1:22:01] i well i said i go to work but i work
[1:22:03] from home now with everything changing
[1:22:05] but before i get going to work i said
[1:22:07] lord i don't want to just survive the
[1:22:09] week
[1:22:10] lord i want to thrive through the week
[1:22:12] [Music]
[1:22:14] my prayer needs to change
[1:22:17] lord i just don't want to survive the
[1:22:19] week i want more than that
[1:22:21] i want to thrive through the week i want
[1:22:23] the best week that you can give me
[1:22:24] i want the best blessings that you could
[1:22:26] give me
[1:22:29] because if you say lord help me get
[1:22:30] through the week he'll help you just get
[1:22:32] through the week because that's what you
[1:22:33] pray for
[1:22:36] and i realize that and i said man i got
[1:22:38] through the week
[1:22:39] but then when i started praying lord
[1:22:41] help me thrive through the week let me
[1:22:42] tell you things
[1:22:43] my fridays couldn't look any better
[1:22:46] because i thrive through the week no
[1:22:48] matter what challenges i face
[1:22:49] no matter who confronted me god stood
[1:22:52] with me
[1:22:55] things that i didn't expect to come in
[1:22:57] my favor god blessed me beyond measure
[1:23:04] because i prayed lord i just don't want
[1:23:05] to survive the week i want to thrive
[1:23:07] i want to prosper i want to i want i
[1:23:10] want the blessings of god
[1:23:12] that should be your prayer everything
[1:23:14] that joseph touched was blessed
[1:23:16] i say lord let it be whatever i touch
[1:23:19] it's blessed
[1:23:20] if my keyboard touches my hand touches
[1:23:22] the keyboard it's blessed
[1:23:23] if i'm on a conference call people are
[1:23:25] blessed if i'm talking to somebody
[1:23:27] they're blessed wherever i gotta go that
[1:23:30] place is blessed
[1:23:32] is that just my prayer that should be
[1:23:35] your prayer
[1:23:36] you're an anointed of god
[1:23:40] don't limit your prayers god is capable
[1:23:42] of anything
[1:23:49] whatever hand whatever whatever joseph
[1:23:51] touched his hands
[1:23:53] blessed it and people saw that
[1:23:59] people saw that ponce first saw that
[1:24:04] he was a prisoner in prince of his house
[1:24:05] and possibly like man this man blessed
[1:24:09] you could be in your job and people
[1:24:12] looking down
[1:24:12] at you but they know deep inside you're
[1:24:14] blessed
[1:24:16] they may not tell you but their spirit
[1:24:19] is witness with your spirit
[1:24:20] that you're a child of god
[1:24:24] and i want to apologize for that i'm a
[1:24:27] child of god
[1:24:32] amen we're living in a dark world saints
[1:24:34] if there's gonna be a light i might as
[1:24:36] well let my little light shine
[1:24:38] it might be blinding to others that's
[1:24:40] okay but for some it might be a way of
[1:24:42] truth
[1:24:46] because the only gospel they'll know is
[1:24:48] the lie is the life that you live before
[1:24:49] them
[1:24:53] and so possibly went up to joseph said
[1:24:55] joseph let's look man i'm making more
[1:24:57] than just a prison i'm going to
[1:24:58] give you oversight to my house my estate
[1:25:03] my household my life my life stock all
[1:25:06] these different things
[1:25:08] he was elevated man who would have
[1:25:10] thought
[1:25:13] joseph was elevated he had oversight
[1:25:16] and the bible says that pontiff's wife
[1:25:18] cast his eye upon joseph
[1:25:21] the devil's always looking to see were
[1:25:23] you being blessed
[1:25:25] looking to use a vessel to bring your
[1:25:27] blessings down
[1:25:31] that's the reason why if you get a
[1:25:32] little promotion don't go walking around
[1:25:34] i got that promotion
[1:25:38] because someone just watched you got
[1:25:39] that promotion
[1:25:42] you got this unexpected bonus i got that
[1:25:44] bonus
[1:25:45] someone saw you get that bonus
[1:25:47] [Music]
[1:25:49] and they're watching to wait for an
[1:25:50] opportunity to bring you down
[1:25:52] not everybody's always happy because
[1:25:54] you're blessed
[1:25:57] but don't let them take that smile away
[1:25:59] from you
[1:26:02] now not everybody's always in agreement
[1:26:03] with you because you say hallelujah
[1:26:07] not everybody agrees with you when you
[1:26:08] say praise the lord
[1:26:10] but don't stop me from praising the lord
[1:26:13] because you may not be blessed but i
[1:26:15] know i am blessed
[1:26:17] but i'm gonna be humble about it because
[1:26:20] i know who my god is
[1:26:22] i know who my father is i know where i
[1:26:24] came from
[1:26:25] i know where i'm going i know if he
[1:26:27] blessed me today he'll bless me tomorrow
[1:26:29] if he bless me this week he'll bless me
[1:26:31] next week if he bless me this month
[1:26:33] he'll bless me next month
[1:26:34] if he bless me this year he bless me
[1:26:36] next year i believe in my god
[1:26:38] i believe in the blessings that he
[1:26:40] bestows upon
[1:26:41] his households
[1:26:49] and so joseph was elevated
[1:26:52] he got blessed and now he didn't have to
[1:26:56] be treated like one of those prisoners
[1:26:58] and so
[1:27:00] pontifir said look you have oversight
[1:27:02] but someone was watching him
[1:27:05] and was waiting for an opportunity to
[1:27:07] question his character
[1:27:10] people are watching you be careful when
[1:27:14] you testify because that moment that you
[1:27:15] slip up
[1:27:16] that same people come running to you
[1:27:20] and they're almost no more scripture
[1:27:22] than you do didn't you say the bible
[1:27:23] says according to ephesian
[1:27:27] you're like yeah i said that that's it
[1:27:28] there
[1:27:30] i sit there
[1:27:33] i i apologize huh
[1:27:37] god knows how to humble you they're
[1:27:40] always watching you
[1:27:42] you don't think they'll pain that
[1:27:43] they'll you think don't be paying
[1:27:44] attention you don't think every time you
[1:27:47] talk they're watching or
[1:27:48] they're right there watching your
[1:27:49] movement your actions your attitude
[1:27:52] and the moment you slip up they come
[1:27:54] running they're the first one
[1:27:57] they're watching your character
[1:28:00] and sometimes they try to put you in a
[1:28:02] position because that's what
[1:28:04] pontiff's wife did try to put joseph in
[1:28:06] a position
[1:28:07] and sometimes people try to put you in a
[1:28:08] position to make you a liar and you know
[1:28:10] you're not
[1:28:13] they try to bring you down with words
[1:28:16] they try to demoralize you bring your
[1:28:18] spirits down
[1:28:21] oh but if i could go on the side real
[1:28:23] quick the bible tells me david was in
[1:28:25] that situation
[1:28:27] his friends left him and abandoned him
[1:28:29] he was in a sorrow state
[1:28:31] but the bible says that david rejoiced
[1:28:33] himself
[1:28:35] in the lord i don't need my pastor to
[1:28:39] make me happy
[1:28:41] although i love my pastor i don't need
[1:28:43] the deacon to call me to make me
[1:28:45] straight
[1:28:46] i know how to live a godly life i don't
[1:28:48] need the song leader sing me happy
[1:28:50] i don't have much of a voice but i'm
[1:28:52] gonna give god the praises with the
[1:28:54] voice that i have
[1:28:54] because the bible says he inhabits the
[1:28:56] praises of his people
[1:29:01] i don't need you to pat my back and
[1:29:02] pamper me so i can feel like a christian
[1:29:04] i woke up this morning knowing that i'm
[1:29:06] a son of god
[1:29:09] [Applause]
[1:29:11] i don't need to convince you i'm a son
[1:29:12] of god i need to let the devil know
[1:29:14] that i'm a son of god
[1:29:16] [Applause]
[1:29:18] amen
[1:29:21] you're not my ticket to heaven god
[1:29:23] already made me a promise
[1:29:28] i love all of you all but my salvation
[1:29:30] is not dependent upon no men's opinions
[1:29:34] i respect you all but your opinions
[1:29:36] don't doesn't matter
[1:29:38] god does not need to consult you to see
[1:29:41] if i should make it to heaven
[1:29:42] he's already made me a promise he's made
[1:29:44] a promise to my family
[1:29:46] he's made a promise to my children and
[1:29:48] i'm holding on to that promise
[1:29:52] amen
[1:29:53] [Music]
[1:29:58] joseph goes running out impossible for
[1:30:01] his wife's like
[1:30:01] had the garment in his hands like look
[1:30:04] you brought this man in to make
[1:30:06] mockery
[1:30:09] poor pontiffer when he got word he
[1:30:11] didn't know what to do is his wife
[1:30:13] or the other faithful loyal servant
[1:30:16] he knew one was telling the truth and
[1:30:18] the other one was lying
[1:30:21] but he was caught in the middle
[1:30:24] the bible says all things
[1:30:29] y'all know that scripture right so when
[1:30:32] the devil tried to play with your mind
[1:30:33] say devil
[1:30:34] the bible didn't say some things
[1:30:37] because we act like it's some things we
[1:30:39] say all things but we act like it's
[1:30:41] something
[1:30:42] but if we're gonna say all things let's
[1:30:43] act like it's all things
[1:30:45] [Music]
[1:30:46] all things work together
[1:30:52] even when it's not even if it doesn't
[1:30:54] seem like it's in your favor
[1:30:55] all things
[1:31:00] you may lose your job all things y'all
[1:31:03] hang with me
[1:31:04] you don't know how you're gonna pay the
[1:31:06] bills all things
[1:31:08] you just went and visited the doctor the
[1:31:10] doctor said all
[1:31:11] things substitute what the doctor said
[1:31:15] is that all things
[1:31:19] let your praise confuse the enemy
[1:31:23] let your testimony confuse the devil
[1:31:27] let him be curious what you what you're
[1:31:28] excited about
[1:31:33] all things were together for the good
[1:31:39] and so he had a setback
[1:31:43] he was taken into prison
[1:31:46] he was taken into prison
[1:31:50] and here he was he was in his father's
[1:31:52] house
[1:31:53] brought to prison elevated
[1:31:57] you're gonna have highs and lows and
[1:31:59] then brought down again
[1:32:02] all things work together for the good
[1:32:05] so there he was in this prison he's like
[1:32:08] i'm back to square one
[1:32:10] i lost everything he got to rebuild his
[1:32:13] credibility
[1:32:15] got to rebuild his brand got to rebuild
[1:32:18] his name
[1:32:19] rebuild his reputation he got a new boss
[1:32:22] so he got to show his boss what he
[1:32:23] what he's you know who he is and how he
[1:32:25] works his work ethic
[1:32:27] he got to start back again the whole
[1:32:29] boss is gone now he got a new ball so he
[1:32:31] gotta
[1:32:31] you know i gotta prove myself again i
[1:32:34] gotta start from scratch
[1:32:36] because i really need that raise i got
[1:32:38] this house project i got this house
[1:32:40] project i got this well
[1:32:41] i gotta do it but joseph
[1:32:48] no matter where he was whether it was
[1:32:50] high he was talking about god
[1:32:53] in his father's house talking to his
[1:32:54] brothers god said this guy said this i
[1:32:56] started vision about you i said
[1:32:57] his brothers didn't like it's like i
[1:32:58] don't like that kind of preacher
[1:33:01] they hated him
[1:33:04] when he was in prison he was still
[1:33:06] talking about god
[1:33:08] ponce for he's like let me tell you
[1:33:08] about my lord he did this he did this he
[1:33:10] did this he did this
[1:33:13] and he got elevated when his wife was
[1:33:16] talking when his wife was talking to him
[1:33:17] he was like nah
[1:33:18] my lord would not have me do he was
[1:33:19] always preaching god's words
[1:33:21] let me tell you when you're down in your
[1:33:22] low
[1:33:24] there's still something to testify about
[1:33:28] when you cannot eat bread still testify
[1:33:31] to god
[1:33:33] you don't have a simple water still
[1:33:35] testify
[1:33:37] and when you're sitting up on high and
[1:33:39] everything's going well
[1:33:41] and you're healthy your job is good the
[1:33:43] way you got bonuses
[1:33:45] everything's going well you still
[1:33:46] testify to god
[1:33:49] because as much as he's god of the
[1:33:50] mountain he's god in the valley
[1:33:56] i won't take y'all i'm gonna keep you
[1:33:57] out too long so there he was in the
[1:33:59] prison
[1:34:01] and everything that he touched there we
[1:34:03] go again
[1:34:04] was blessed
[1:34:07] you got a gift in your life
[1:34:11] no matter where you're at
[1:34:14] that gift is gonna manifest itself
[1:34:19] god gives you that gift
[1:34:22] no matter where you are in life god gave
[1:34:26] you that gift
[1:34:28] you use it for god's glory
[1:34:31] and don't you ever be afraid of an
[1:34:33] unknown situation that you put in
[1:34:35] god is more than able god is able to
[1:34:38] work you through that situation
[1:34:43] joseph did what he knew best he
[1:34:46] testified of god
[1:34:47] and he did his job well
[1:34:50] and he caught the attention of the
[1:34:52] prison guard
[1:34:54] just like he caught the attention
[1:34:55] possible they watched joseph's like man
[1:34:57] this man every time
[1:34:58] his hands touch something is he blessed
[1:35:01] hey joseph i'm gonna elevate you
[1:35:05] elevated ups and downs
[1:35:08] elevated i'm gonna put you over all
[1:35:10] these guards there was two
[1:35:14] prisoners i was brought in a butler
[1:35:18] and a baker they were having disturbing
[1:35:22] dreams
[1:35:23] they didn't find favor with the with the
[1:35:24] pharaoh and they were just twisting and
[1:35:27] turning
[1:35:28] and they were troubled in their spirits
[1:35:29] y'all know the story
[1:35:31] and joseph's like what what's going on
[1:35:33] tell me your dream
[1:35:35] the bake the bake the the butler is like
[1:35:37] well let me tell my dream
[1:35:39] i dreamt this and i was in a vine and i
[1:35:42] had
[1:35:42] i had this happen this happened and then
[1:35:44] i saw that i was serving
[1:35:46] um uh wine or to pharaoh
[1:35:49] and after so many and so joseph given
[1:35:52] the interpretation he says
[1:35:53] you know what it is three days you'll be
[1:35:56] restored back to pharaoh
[1:35:58] and then you'll serve him why you'll be
[1:36:01] restored
[1:36:02] you'll be gone here in three days he's
[1:36:03] like well praise the lord he was
[1:36:05] he was happy i mean you in prison then
[1:36:07] you know what the outcome was gonna be
[1:36:08] you just offended
[1:36:10] the highest person in the in the nation
[1:36:11] at that time
[1:36:13] and then the interpretation of the dream
[1:36:14] tells you that you can find favorable
[1:36:16] pharaoh
[1:36:18] so um the baker got all excited like hey
[1:36:20] me me me
[1:36:23] because he felt like if that was good
[1:36:24] for him then surely
[1:36:26] the dream got to be consistent he's like
[1:36:29] i i dream too so what happened was that
[1:36:31] i was on the tree and
[1:36:34] birds were kind of plucking things away
[1:36:36] and then and then that's it
[1:36:40] because i have a way of seeing things in
[1:36:41] the scripture joseph spent some time
[1:36:43] explaining to the to the butler what
[1:36:45] happened
[1:36:46] but it was like less than probably one
[1:36:47] verse to explain what happened to the
[1:36:49] butler
[1:36:50] to the baker he's like in three days
[1:36:51] you're gonna die
[1:36:56] trevor's gonna chop your head off and
[1:36:58] he's gonna hang you on the tree you're
[1:37:00] gonna die and the birds aren't gonna
[1:37:01] come and eat your flesh
[1:37:02] can you just imagine the baker walking
[1:37:04] away
[1:37:08] that is tough to digest but that's what
[1:37:12] the scripture said
[1:37:15] and so while he watched the baker go
[1:37:17] back into he looks at the butler he says
[1:37:21] remember me when you get back
[1:37:24] to pharaoh remember me
[1:37:29] and at that moment people get caught up
[1:37:32] in that moment that emotion
[1:37:34] it's like i'm never gonna forget you i
[1:37:35] got your back
[1:37:38] let every man be alive but god be true
[1:37:45] because no sooner when the butler got
[1:37:48] back
[1:37:49] he was flooded with emotions he didn't
[1:37:52] want to get the pharaoh upset again
[1:37:55] so he killed he held his peace and the
[1:37:57] bible says he forgot about him
[1:38:01] man will forget you but god
[1:38:05] god never
[1:38:08] never forgets you the bible says two
[1:38:11] years
[1:38:12] had gone by two years had gone by
[1:38:16] and all of a sudden pharaoh started to
[1:38:18] have dreams he couldn't interpret
[1:38:20] he called for the best uh astrologers
[1:38:23] the best
[1:38:24] wise man the best people that he could
[1:38:26] find to come and interpret the dream and
[1:38:28] no one
[1:38:31] no one for two years
[1:38:35] you figured that joseph was forgotten
[1:38:37] but god never forgotten joseph
[1:38:40] two years is just like a blank to god
[1:38:42] because the bible says a thousand years
[1:38:44] with men
[1:38:44] is one day with god
[1:38:49] and in that duration of two years joseph
[1:38:52] never
[1:38:52] once looked down he kept his head up
[1:38:58] god never forgot him
[1:39:01] and so here was pharaoh trying to find
[1:39:05] a way to find peace with this disturbing
[1:39:07] dream that he's been having
[1:39:10] and so finally the butler goes up with
[1:39:13] god knows how to move upon somebody's
[1:39:15] heart to muster enough courage
[1:39:18] to speak on your behalf
[1:39:22] when the moment is right when the
[1:39:25] opportunity's right
[1:39:26] let me tell you even when you think god
[1:39:28] is late he's still on time
[1:39:32] every time it's like you're watching the
[1:39:35] snail that's gonna
[1:39:36] go off the edge right here that smells
[1:39:38] like if you don't move
[1:39:39] i'm gonna fall you're just sitting there
[1:39:43] because you just got plenty of time it's
[1:39:45] a snail we move at a slow pace compared
[1:39:47] to how god moves
[1:39:49] and i can show you that by the scripture
[1:39:52] but god's always on time when peter was
[1:39:54] falling in the water the bible says that
[1:39:56] jesus didn't rush up to go grab him
[1:39:57] he took his arm and stretch his hand and
[1:40:00] pick peter up
[1:40:03] because we don't want a god who panics
[1:40:08] if god panicked then what would that
[1:40:10] mean for you and i
[1:40:12] but he says peace i give unto you
[1:40:17] so that we can have confidence in the
[1:40:19] god that we worship
[1:40:21] that we know that he's in control even
[1:40:23] though we are out of control
[1:40:28] so they call so the pharaoh was like so
[1:40:30] the butler was like pharaoh can i just
[1:40:32] say a few words he's like when i was in
[1:40:34] prison
[1:40:36] remember that time you got me i got you
[1:40:37] upset that's that's what the bible says
[1:40:38] remember that time where i got you upset
[1:40:40] and you almost killed me well i had a
[1:40:42] dream
[1:40:44] and i needed someone to interpret that
[1:40:46] dream and he's trying to say this as
[1:40:47] humbly as possible because he's talking
[1:40:48] to pharaoh
[1:40:49] and fur was considered god of the land
[1:40:50] so he's watching everything he says
[1:40:52] so i had a dream like you had a dream it
[1:40:55] was disturbing to me
[1:40:58] he had to he had to connect his
[1:41:00] experience
[1:41:02] should be able to relate to pharaoh's
[1:41:04] experience
[1:41:05] you can't sleep i couldn't sleep because
[1:41:07] i thought you were going to kill me but
[1:41:08] your dream is a little bit different
[1:41:11] your dream's a little bit different but
[1:41:14] there was a man that i remember who
[1:41:15] interpreted my dream
[1:41:16] and here i am serving you now it's
[1:41:19] unfortunate what happened to the baker
[1:41:20] because he had a dream too
[1:41:25] and it came to pass you killed him
[1:41:28] but i know this man can interpret dreams
[1:41:32] so pharaoh listened to the matter very
[1:41:34] intently
[1:41:35] can you just imagine like this is in
[1:41:36] front of the whole court and they're
[1:41:38] watching this it's like this guy's going
[1:41:39] to die
[1:41:41] and pharaoh's watching this because he's
[1:41:43] god of the land
[1:41:45] and to me that who is he's just a butler
[1:41:48] he's not like the second coming he's
[1:41:49] he's a butler but to be able to be able
[1:41:53] to speak
[1:41:56] how god is coordinating all things all
[1:41:58] things
[1:42:00] work together joseph had no idea
[1:42:03] that that conversation was happening
[1:42:09] joseph had no idea that this was taking
[1:42:11] place
[1:42:12] he was being about god's business
[1:42:16] he was still in prayer god you see me in
[1:42:18] this prison hole you could bring me out
[1:42:19] and all meanwhile they're having a
[1:42:20] conversation about joseph
[1:42:26] god is working on your behalf even
[1:42:28] though you may not see it
[1:42:30] you remain faithful
[1:42:33] [Applause]
[1:42:38] and pharaoh looked up i could imagine
[1:42:41] phil was sitting up and then he just
[1:42:42] stood up
[1:42:43] the butler kind of looked back like
[1:42:45] probably probably i shouldn't have said
[1:42:47] nothing
[1:42:50] so i was like bring me this guy now
[1:42:53] imagine this
[1:42:55] he just put his neck out on the line
[1:42:59] for this guy because
[1:43:04] of his testimony because of how he
[1:43:07] treated him
[1:43:08] because of his experience with him
[1:43:13] his whole reputation was on the line
[1:43:17] but he was willing to stake that
[1:43:18] reputation because of how
[1:43:20] god treated him through joseph
[1:43:24] how you treat others is so important
[1:43:28] you never know when it's gonna come
[1:43:29] right back to you
[1:43:31] that you don't have to be here but
[1:43:32] someone could talk about your character
[1:43:35] oh no she's not like that i know her
[1:43:36] well enough oh no he's not like that
[1:43:39] he's a man of god he would never say
[1:43:40] something like that oh no he would never
[1:43:42] do that
[1:43:43] why because god because they know your
[1:43:45] character they know
[1:43:46] the way you carry yourself sometimes you
[1:43:49] don't need to defend yourself
[1:43:50] people will speak on your behalf
[1:43:56] there's nothing more reassuring when you
[1:43:58] don't have to defend yourself because
[1:43:59] you live a life you present yourself in
[1:44:01] such a way that people's like i know
[1:44:02] their character
[1:44:06] the bible says not make this quick they
[1:44:08] got joseph
[1:44:09] they shaved them they cleaned them up
[1:44:12] jesus joseph i like what y'all doing
[1:44:13] just like well you're gonna
[1:44:14] you getting ready to go see the the king
[1:44:16] pharaoh wants to see you
[1:44:17] what does he want to see me for joseph
[1:44:21] you know what i like about joseph
[1:44:24] whether it was sponsored he didn't care
[1:44:26] whether in the hands of the media he
[1:44:27] didn't care whether in front of pharaoh
[1:44:29] he doesn't care who you put him in front
[1:44:31] of his god was
[1:44:32] bigger than anybody
[1:44:39] i have a 210 i have a 200 210 pound
[1:44:43] rot roller and my little daughter just
[1:44:46] stays in front of
[1:44:49] and she's happy because she's telling
[1:44:50] the rottweiler what to do and b and
[1:44:52] daddy's sitting right behind her
[1:44:54] that rock roller see daddy
[1:44:57] she's yet on the right roll is this big
[1:44:59] she's j tall
[1:45:01] that right right let's see daddy that
[1:45:02] rhyme roller does not see her
[1:45:05] cause that rhyrolla know that you can't
[1:45:08] touch this little girl
[1:45:12] you understand where i'm coming from the
[1:45:14] devil may not see you
[1:45:16] he may not think you're nobody but he
[1:45:18] knows that somebody
[1:45:20] stands behind you he knows who your
[1:45:22] daddy is
[1:45:24] he knows who stands with you that's the
[1:45:26] reason why i don't walk with fear
[1:45:28] that's the reason why i'm no longer in
[1:45:30] bondage because my god
[1:45:32] is greater than any devil
[1:45:44] although my what roller is the
[1:45:45] sweetheart though she's pretty good
[1:45:48] so they brought joseph there
[1:45:51] and pharaoh begins to explain to joseph
[1:45:53] it's like i can't
[1:45:56] i can't sleep i have these dreams
[1:45:59] and none of these guys can't interpret
[1:46:01] and can you just imagine as he's
[1:46:02] pointing to the very people that he's
[1:46:04] come to rely on
[1:46:05] the sorcerers the the the astrologers uh
[1:46:08] all these guys are like now they can't
[1:46:10] interpret the dreams and they're all
[1:46:11] looking away it's like well this is
[1:46:12] embarrassing
[1:46:15] and joseph's looking one against many
[1:46:20] he knows where he stood so there he was
[1:46:25] and then joseph let me tell you when you
[1:46:27] know where you stand with god you don't
[1:46:29] stutter
[1:46:32] there's not a crack in your voice you
[1:46:35] know how to speak with authority
[1:46:38] come on somebody you have the ability to
[1:46:42] speak to the devil with authority
[1:46:44] there shouldn't be a crack in your voice
[1:46:46] shouldn't be any doubt devil please
[1:46:48] leave my house nah that ain't that's not
[1:46:49] how i work
[1:46:50] devil you have no right in my house
[1:46:54] you have no right to my health you have
[1:46:58] no
[1:46:58] right to my children you have no right
[1:47:01] to my job i rebuke you in the name of
[1:47:05] jesus christ
[1:47:08] speak with authority
[1:47:12] you're the child of a king
[1:47:18] man if uh jeff bezos he's a billionaire
[1:47:21] if elon musk
[1:47:22] they're a billionaire if uh of bill
[1:47:24] gates he's a billionaire warren buffett
[1:47:25] y'all know who the billionaires are
[1:47:26] if they gave you a blank check i
[1:47:28] guarantee you there won't be enough
[1:47:29] zeros that you write
[1:47:32] who would stop by the only two zeros who
[1:47:36] would stop at only three zeros
[1:47:40] they gave you a blank check
[1:47:43] come on somebody there won't be enough
[1:47:46] zeros
[1:47:47] and you know it's not gonna bounce
[1:47:50] god has given you a blank check stop
[1:47:53] sitting around and being wallowing in
[1:47:55] yourself
[1:47:55] pity use that check write your blessings
[1:48:01] don't let the devil rob you of your
[1:48:03] blessings you write down your blessings
[1:48:06] and cash it in amen
[1:48:11] they brought joseph to pharaoh he begins
[1:48:14] to interpret the dreams
[1:48:16] he he's listening to pharaoh's dream
[1:48:18] zach uh-huh
[1:48:19] fatty califor huh slim caps uh huh
[1:48:22] uh-huh the the corner of lee's huh
[1:48:24] uh-huh uh by that time he already knew
[1:48:26] the interpretation like oh
[1:48:27] being courteous he's like all right
[1:48:31] um here's the interpretation everybody's
[1:48:34] not
[1:48:35] this ain't i mean this is like a massive
[1:48:36] amount of people you have
[1:48:38] like a host of astrologers and all the
[1:48:40] courts just watching this scene
[1:48:41] unfold a nobody
[1:48:46] talking to supposedly a somebody
[1:48:51] not not realizing that he's represented
[1:48:54] by god
[1:48:57] and he commended the area
[1:49:00] he took control of the area i could just
[1:49:03] imagine those who started pace around
[1:49:04] like you know
[1:49:05] i know the interpretation of the dream
[1:49:07] no one would ever talk to pharaoh like
[1:49:09] that there'll be all hamburgers like
[1:49:10] pharaoh here's the dream
[1:49:13] can i speak joseph he knew who his maker
[1:49:18] was
[1:49:19] he's like pharaoh this is an interesting
[1:49:21] one
[1:49:24] i know it he didn't care he knew who he
[1:49:27] was
[1:49:29] he says the fatty calf that's seven
[1:49:31] years
[1:49:33] of plenty
[1:49:36] and the other dream that's all the same
[1:49:38] thing seven years of plenty they're both
[1:49:40] the same thing
[1:49:41] and uh can somebody keep it down over
[1:49:42] there please he's commending it
[1:49:46] he's not afraid i keep it i just i want
[1:49:48] to concentrate
[1:49:50] the other seven years is a year is a
[1:49:52] famine and
[1:49:54] pharaoh is fixated his eyes right on
[1:49:57] joseph
[1:49:58] because he's been this he's been
[1:49:59] disturbed by the stream he needs an
[1:50:02] interpretation
[1:50:02] he can't sleep at night no one so he's
[1:50:05] listening
[1:50:06] and everybody else is listening
[1:50:09] he's like the other seven years are
[1:50:11] seven years of famine
[1:50:13] and he could have stopped there
[1:50:17] he could have stopped right there but
[1:50:20] god in his infinite wisdom
[1:50:23] joseph probably i don't know i wasn't
[1:50:24] back there he looked with the smile he's
[1:50:26] like you know
[1:50:27] i got a solution to this
[1:50:35] now what i would suggest is that you
[1:50:36] find somebody
[1:50:40] [Music]
[1:50:42] that could watch over the years of
[1:50:44] plenty
[1:50:46] and store up food and um
[1:50:49] when the years of famine come because
[1:50:50] it's gonna be all forgotten with
[1:50:52] the food would have been stored up and
[1:50:53] can you just imagine that was just
[1:50:55] that was just ingenious thinking
[1:50:58] god knows how to put the right words in
[1:51:00] your mouth
[1:51:02] if you gotta go to an interview i've
[1:51:04] gone i've gone to a lot of interviews
[1:51:06] i don't even know the words i'm going to
[1:51:07] say i say lord anoint my lips
[1:51:10] [Music]
[1:51:11] anoint the ears let me say the right
[1:51:14] things
[1:51:16] and at that very moment he moves on the
[1:51:19] scene
[1:51:21] he says you could just find yourself a
[1:51:22] man and over the seven years they could
[1:51:24] watch over the
[1:51:25] you know collect the plenty and then the
[1:51:27] year during the years of famine
[1:51:28] we could kind of you know kind of store
[1:51:31] give it back and make sure that people
[1:51:33] are covered during the years of
[1:51:34] of the seven years of famine and
[1:51:38] pharaoh's like that's that's right
[1:51:41] that's right
[1:51:42] he was so relieved and as if he
[1:51:45] pharaoh had no idea what he was walking
[1:51:47] into and joseph was right here waiting
[1:51:49] for him
[1:51:51] pharaoh stood up i made up my mind
[1:51:55] and everybody listening we need to find
[1:51:59] a person
[1:52:05] joseph knew we need to find a person
[1:52:09] that can oversee this thing
[1:52:14] i can't think of anyone but you
[1:52:21] all those setbacks
[1:52:25] was to prepare him for a major
[1:52:28] comeback
[1:52:32] god elevated him
[1:52:36] can you just imagine the fear
[1:52:39] that with through potiphar
[1:52:42] the fear that went through the guards
[1:52:47] and all the people that has done him
[1:52:49] wrong
[1:52:54] to realize the very person you've been
[1:52:57] talking about
[1:52:59] the very person you mischaracterized
[1:53:02] the very person that you chided
[1:53:06] has now been elevated to a position
[1:53:14] but here's the difference as i close
[1:53:15] with this here's the difference
[1:53:18] between a godly elevation
[1:53:22] and a worldly elevation
[1:53:26] a worldly elevation would say
[1:53:29] you got it coming
[1:53:34] a worthy elevation would say
[1:53:37] you didn't see this coming huh you're
[1:53:39] gonna get it now
[1:53:41] that's a worldly elevation a worldly
[1:53:44] elevation
[1:53:45] would boast himself or herself
[1:53:49] a worldly elevation we'll be like um
[1:53:52] where's my office gonna be at
[1:53:56] that's a worldly elevation but a godly
[1:54:00] elevation joseph
[1:54:04] found mercy with all those
[1:54:07] he interacted with
[1:54:11] joseph walked humble that may not get a
[1:54:14] lot of amens but it's still true
[1:54:18] joseph was not thinking about avenging
[1:54:20] people
[1:54:24] joseph was thinking about how can he be
[1:54:28] of best servant
[1:54:29] and represent god the best
[1:54:36] long story short the famine
[1:54:40] happened in the land joseph is now
[1:54:44] seated in heavenly places the right hand
[1:54:47] of of a and y'all know the types
[1:54:52] and then he brings his father and his
[1:54:55] brethren and you know how
[1:54:56] they go through this unveiling
[1:55:00] and then they finally realize who he was
[1:55:06] and joseph said you have done this
[1:55:10] for my bad
[1:55:14] but god has intended it for your good
[1:55:20] as we stand everything
[1:55:24] that joseph went through was for the
[1:55:27] good
[1:55:28] of someone else
[1:55:31] what you go through may not be for just
[1:55:35] you yourself to mold you
[1:55:39] of who you are to build your character
[1:55:43] to make you what you've become
[1:55:46] but it could very well be to be a
[1:55:49] blessing
[1:55:50] for someone else
[1:55:54] the trials of your faith i can't tell
[1:55:57] you how many times someone has come to
[1:55:59] me
[1:55:59] or have gone to others and said you know
[1:56:01] i appreciate
[1:56:02] you sharing this because i was going
[1:56:04] through something
[1:56:08] because sometimes the devil wants you to
[1:56:09] think that you're the only one that's
[1:56:10] going through it
[1:56:14] but his tactics are not new it's the
[1:56:17] same old taxes that he strived for
[1:56:19] centuries
[1:56:21] and if saints of old were able to
[1:56:23] overcome in the past
[1:56:25] then you are able to overcome today
[1:56:30] not by your own ability but i can do all
[1:56:34] things
[1:56:37] through christ who strengthened me
[1:56:41] you believe that when you get up
[1:56:44] tomorrow morning or when you leave today
[1:56:46] you say lord
[1:56:47] i can do all things
[1:56:52] through christ all things
[1:56:56] whatever your hands touch is blessed
[1:57:00] because the bible says greater is he
[1:57:01] that is in you
[1:57:04] than he that is in the world
[1:57:09] you're not meant to be grounded you're
[1:57:12] meant to be elevated
[1:57:15] that's the reason why in this age in
[1:57:17] this age alone
[1:57:18] saints there were four beasts that was
[1:57:21] led out in the church ages
[1:57:24] an ox a man
[1:57:28] an eagle why am i drawing a blanket
[1:57:33] a lion but only an eagle
[1:57:36] in this age only an ego in this age was
[1:57:39] given to you
[1:57:41] so that way you could fly above
[1:57:44] all of the criticism above
[1:57:48] all of the hatred above all the
[1:57:51] rejection
[1:57:52] above all of the malice above
[1:57:55] all of these things and not only that
[1:57:59] but
[1:57:59] the natural should take on the spiritual
[1:58:02] and so much that you believe it
[1:58:04] that one of these days one of these days
[1:58:09] you're gonna get up in the morning
[1:58:11] you're gonna think it's a regular day
[1:58:14] when you put your feet on the ground
[1:58:17] you're gonna soon realize you're
[1:58:18] touching the streets of gold
[1:58:23] one of these days you're going to be
[1:58:26] driving into work
[1:58:28] you're going to drive right into glory
[1:58:31] one of these days you're going to be in
[1:58:33] your prayer room
[1:58:35] with the eyes shut in your hands raised
[1:58:37] to find the laws of gravity
[1:58:39] and by the time you're done and you open
[1:58:40] your eyes you're going to see that
[1:58:41] you're in glory one of these days saints
[1:58:44] everything that we preached everything
[1:58:46] that you believed everything that we
[1:58:48] acted on
[1:58:49] becomes much more than just words that's
[1:58:51] printed on a book much more than just an
[1:58:53] amen that you say
[1:58:54] much more than a shaking of hands or
[1:58:56] quote it becomes a reality
[1:58:58] of what you have believed
[1:59:02] you love the lord
[1:59:06] god bless you saints god bless you
[1:59:11] thank you for your patience i know i
[1:59:13] took a little extra time i still wore of
[1:59:15] prayer by psalm if you want to come up
[1:59:16] and dismiss let's just say a word of
[1:59:17] prayer lord jesus
[1:59:19] we just thank you for your grace we
[1:59:21] thank you for your mercy
[1:59:23] we thank you for the word of truth
[1:59:26] father i poured my heart out to your
[1:59:29] dear people i couldn't find the right
[1:59:31] words but i just wanted to bring out the
[1:59:33] the word the best that i know how and i
[1:59:35] just trust that someone received
[1:59:36] something here
[1:59:38] father you've called us a higher purpose
[1:59:41] you've caught us to be elevated we're
[1:59:44] seated in heavenly places in christ
[1:59:46] jesus
[1:59:48] help our minds to be there help our
[1:59:50] bodies and our spirits to be there
[1:59:52] watch over us and protect us help us to
[1:59:55] ride above all these things that would
[1:59:57] bring us
[1:59:58] down father just by the mere gesture of
