grateful so always midweek is it gets a little tough Peter ran for a couple of days and but we're just grateful for this opportunity to be in the house of the Lord tonight to be able to stand for you one of your servants the Lord and we just appreciate you we trusted you bring him home safely this weekend report to his post of duty we just thank you for all our things in Jesus Christ name Amen amen amen let's get off I was I was it's good to be back in the house of the Lord again and I had a wonderful you know I was just saying I think that these services was kind of ordained of God God knows exactly we're gonna look at second Corinthians chapter 12 God knows exactly what each and every one of us needs and he gives us what we need right it at the right time you know you say he's an aunt I'm God and you know had such a wonderful time on Sunday morning it just kind of spilled over into our little communion service there at home and it's just starting to spill over again you know y'all do you know anything about your cup running over y'all don't know that about that maybe y'all tired and sleepy and all of that and I worked out then I drove our home and an hour and a half here and I just I just feel like my cup just running over it it's just and I if it if it it if it'll just run off on somebody else and then they cup I'll get the running ball tell you what we have revival we'll have a revival in here we I think summer break out we'd go out that dose people in Holland all Lord help us help us help us Jesus I don't know what I would do right now cuz I fool I tell you I don't know whether I want to talk a crowd preach or what I might do all of the above before it's all over with but I was just saying how much I really needed it and man I just cried like a baby when I went the church I left here I was still excited and I'm excited now but I just remember brother Jack in prayer trust that you make it home safely quite sure y'all missing him by now man we want to start the first verse maybe not so much of a familiar scripture to most of us we probably have read the scriptures before but maybe we have preached on it tonight we want to start at the first verse it says it is it is not expedient for me doubtless to glory I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord since I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago whether in the body I cannot tell or whether out of the body I cannot tell God knoweth such a one caught up to the third heaven and I knew such a man whether in the body or out of the body I cannot tell God know of how that he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable words which is not lawful for a man to utter or such a one where like glory yet of myself I will not glory but in my infirmities for though I would desire to glory I shall not be a fool for I will say the truth but now I forbear lest any man should think of me above that which he see if me to be or that he heareth of me unless I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelation that was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan to bucket me lest I should be exalted above measure many Lord had a blessing to read I was worried you may be seated we want to use as a little title this morning the decline in vain glory I was attempting to preach on this on last Thursday night at home and so we all just pray for us as we just try to make sense out of the scripture and trust that we can give us something that I'm helpless in the hour that we're living in I want to start out just looking at the Apostle Paul in a couple of the chapters and a lot of the writers in the book of second Corinthians it's because of the many issues that Paul had with with the church that he established and you know you you would think now I guess that's just in the way that I think about things but you you would you would think that with a ministry like Paul had and and and the depth of understanding and things of that nature that you know people would just really gravitate towards them and really be anchored and and just come to church on five you know just the thought of Paul you know but but it's not like that I think people sometimes they we get a misconception as it relates to church it should be that way but it's not because we have an enemy that we're fighting the devil don't want you I'm just gonna say you know the devil don't want y'all to be a nice wonderful group of people he he do not want us to be on fire tonight he's gonna try everything he possibly can to keep us from being on fire Paul was was was the the and I'd like to look at this because it gives us something to look at and the man I've been thinking about this I couldn't sleep last night thinking about this thing I was studying it a little bit I was telling a guy on the job the day I said man I started studying some more last night on it that thing with the bed with me I couldn't sleep I was just dead and thought after thought was just kind of coming to me as I was trying to sleep but I you know and I was telling this to the church last week I was saying you know as Christians you know we we need a mirror or we need some somebody that's living something that we could point at and said that's the life of price that's that's the manifestation of God in a vessel we've heard sermons you know and we hear sermons we've heard sermons we've heard great preachers preach and things of that nature but then you know you look at you look at their life and you say that's not the life of Christ and that's not what I supposed to be mirroring uh you know the Prophet he talks about he talks about I think in their 90 ones in the end time he talks about you know and this is why you can't get caught up in in gifts and favorite preachers and and and all of that it's it's got to be something that's beyond just preaching a sermon singing a song I appreciate that song since birth I had I wanted to have a mother-in-law saying and it's but it's got to be something that's beyond that something that you know as as because as human beings as as as Christians we got to have something that's alive something that's living something that that we could look at write something like you know d-did the guy that was drinking for Christmas took a sip hit and took a sip down got me sippin but took a sip here and took the sit down and he had his son with him he had his son with him and and you know it was snowy and everything you know in his way you know he was walking anybody in here then got in a drunk and so it was wondering he was happy to look back and saw his little man just kind of you know what you doing you say daddy right cuz he wants the mirror his daddy right so he was following in his footsteps so but it's got to be the right kind of footstep like the property was talking about the gifted man right - gifted man he couldn't understand he said what what are those guys you know they would speak to town one would interpret to tell you were like wow that's that's beyond me but my gift he was able to you know shake my hand and then shake though they say man this one he will man if there was ever Christian he said that won't work but then he's a madman he said Oh Lord if there was ever devil so he was he had a wife and was running around with another woman what was gifted see was gifted but see when we when we when I look and you know I'm thinking about adoption right adoption is based upon our behavior right now I'm I do things a little bit different so y'all had to you know y'all had to just follow the way I think right but I'm in them I'm in the message right I believe adoption is based upon behavior character and and you know God used how many believe that the Apostle Paul was positionally placed by God right then he had because of the word to be a scriptural example a scriptural example to the generations right as as a minister if if you want to understand ministry you could go back to the church any book is in there the Prophet listen follow the life of pop-pop pause and a perfect it see it was just enough for Paul up under that lion anointing to to write and to teach but it was he had to live a life right he had to live a life that that when when we read about the life of Paul we said there we could see the Spirit of God flowing freely right come on cuz because that's that's adoption well we're in the adoption series he talks about that when we get to such a place where God said there's my spirit flowing freely y'all still following right i living a living example not just something y'all see while I'm working with you this way not not just not just great revelations and experiences right now to kind of continue to move forward right one of the things that we find in studying this this particular passage of Scripture is that Paul was toxic right by so-called believers so-called believers just immature right somewhat immature a lot the Corinthians Church we know we're immature right brotherbrother say Paul couldn't teach the same things that he preached to the Ephesians church right they had they had issues but you know what I believe that God allowed these things to happen right for an example because the Bible said things was wrote for our example right but to turn it's it's to a remark made in order to anger wound or provoke someone right and see what had to be on display and I was thinking this term claim to me real simple restraint restraint is is a measure of or condition that keeps someone or something under control or within limits of self control see because listen Church we got to think about it when something is saying yes there's a automatic reaction to the action right if if you've been littered being belittled right put down and and just say you know you're in a crowd and somebody's trying to make this person bigger than you right uh that's an automatic reaction right there will be an automatic reaction right if you alive if there's anything in you what what would you try to do you would try to show that this person is not bigger or better right you'll try to express all of who you are right but but you know how I like the bigger man the bigger man with all of the things that was which was taking place because the bigger man watch this brother brother says he makes you feel like you're the bigger man right a real big man but but he talk he talks about you know how you know preachers get sometimes you know change of suits and things of that nature they want to arm here yeah right it's kind of its kind of the spirit of this age too where where people people in this age they want to argue quotes and in argue their position but listen the gospel never came the opening of the seals none of this came just to give us something to argue about but something for us to show us how to live and obtain rapture insane traction great the tick of change but people people want to argue like that ain't my thought but you know it's there people want to argue and things of that nature right but but that's not the gospel that's not what the gospel is all about it's not about us you know sitting around fussing in this and and separating and dividing often - that's why we got so many churches that like we got the day and I ain't even time I like their Pentecost I'm talking about right around to reveal a word right somebody get upset and they go start something with leave that alone Lord Jesus help me right but watch watch Paul the Apostle Paul showing restraint showing character but but he's proving that it's the life of Christ right because listen you don't show restraint on your own come on somebody cross in front of you why are you driving little loud he you'd be ready to come on glue God had to catch it don't say that Oh y'all with me y'all with me out wit me y'all with me right but Paul he starts out he's he he says it's not expedient for me lest to the glory but this word glory means to boast right and all the things that that I study to get an understanding of the scripture cuz I don't know about y'all let's just like to read the Bible and not get an understanding of what's actually taking place right and sometimes you have to read other things because sometimes you can't find things in the message brother Branham never preached every single scripture but I think he he he brother Jack no I max I thought them about it but he did give us a foundation that that we if I'm reading something listen Lulu I can't agree with that right right somebody told me well it was said several times that you know you don't need to use the the message as a studying guy that's right now you can't tell me that I've been preaching too long I take I base everything you know who it's studying right I don't do away with my Bible right i brother branham say something to me that don't make sense or that's off you know I'll stick with the Bible - my revelation catches up to his revelation right but I filter things through the message people say the only you you don't it's like you gotta have a balance we know that the Bible is the absolute but the message helped me to understand so so you know people say well you don't need brother branham you don't disagree with it you say well why you say that brothers around because just say for instance this scripture that we read without me approaching it you'll read it and you won't have no unreal full understanding you you might get to the point where he took my grace sufficient because that's the part of the scripture that that we've heard right but so you you need something to help to explain what we got and that's to me what the message is all about it helps to explain to me what I got the Bible is the book of redemption right this is the book of redemption but I had no understanding trust I study the message right that's that's very realistic did the job come on it helped open up my understanding to what our hand so people say well you don't need it you know you you should study your brother branham just study your Bible what do you see okay that's let's father you can study your Bible you can read your Bible but you gonna need help you gonna you gonna need you you're gonna need to go somewhere because you're gonna run into things in this Bible that you're not gonna understand that you're gonna need somebody to interpret that I was free that's the truth but you said well why do you say that because you get so many things floating around floating around floating around well well you know all you need is the Bible listen I don't I don't disagree with that statement but I believe is most of that statement you need something to help you understand this book because there's there's plenty of things the songs of Solomon right I mean just a lot with it will it just not you're just reading you're just reading and you don't have a clue you said how can you say that because this year I'm taking my table times that okay if I don't get to everything I want to get to I just hope I drop enough points and brother Jack could pick it up when I'm gone okay but did this year I believe I and I've been preaching 20-some years but I believe in this year I've grown by going back and taking word for word letter for letter a chapter four chapter and and and making sense out of the whole thing right amen but you don't need you don't need the message maybe you don't need it maybe you don't need it but I still need it right it's like because it's all information and and the Bible said prove all things hold faster that was good right so I like that last part hold fast to that which is good so all it is good you trying to tell me to turn loose all the good to satisfy people I can't do it okay if it is that right is that the scripture y'all still with me you're holding fat how many believe that that's good a lot a lot of good in the message there's a lot there's a lot of death let me take something that's still things man in the messaging people did another thing if you don't study you can't even begin to tell me nothing about brother but how do you tell me where brother brother missed it in you don't study you don't study or you might have heard at one time or you write a ring at one time I remember brother Robledo said this years ago he said you got to hit some colonies ten times six times ten times I really get it every time I go back to a message book man I get something different fresh new no inspiration food in season right so so don't let don't let don't ever let nobody come to you with that you don't you don't need a messages all you need is your Bible brother branham never came to take the Bible from us he can't his Minister came to point us back to the thing right Oh glory to God Lord if I start on man I'm not going to get right I don't know that's just that's just kind of came I got about 35 minutes I'm gonna be out of here 9 o'clock but see y'all been such a good audience it's just get tough man last Wednesday man I can barely leave here okay but what she says is it's not expedient for me doubtless to boast right and think about something how could you see one thing about God God is not going to share any of his glory right and then you've got to think about something right how could a man or woman boasting something right within themselves that God did come on y'all miss dad huh how could we get lifted up right if we could do it we couldn't set ourselves free right we went in the pawn shop we needed him to go to cavalry we needed in debt pain we needed a goal right amen we we win it win it when it comes down to Revelation it takes God to reveal it takes not the same it's a god to deliver and take God to set people free huh it's like got to hear how many anybody need some healing tonight met with us in the body you know in the spirit if you need healing see I cannot see brother Jack can no minister can no matter how we come to the pulpit dressed up it was already done for you you just got to accept it didn't hop how can I boast in something that man somebody done for me right with with him when it comes down to the life of Christ right it's sis listen Church it's something living itself out through me only thing I can do I could boast in that something we can all do that we could boast in that something that's within us that that holds the rain when we talk taunted right but to boast within ourselves right in in human human ability see the kind and vain glory right vain glory is in honor at pride in oneself or one achievement accepted vanity none of that speaks to the character of God right none none of it so you see why vain glory has to be the kind right because it you can't attribute any of that look that as far as that term is concerned back to God because it does not speak to the nature and the character of God right and see Paul Paul is is example we look the part I know we looked at Jesus but Jesus is veiled can I get a witness Jesus Israel right we we still looking up and looking around right come on y'all stay with man God for 30 minutes I gonna preach are y'all ready for the be happy I know y'all get tired I'm gonna tattoo but y'all stay with me see that's not looked up and look around look at the Jesus listen in individual right amen watch watch Paul up under up under all the scrutiny and everything yet he something in him right with with all of these all of these experiences right Paul Paul when when Paul gets into the second and the third verses it because he wants to be careful right he speaks in the third person yeah I'm gonna heard that time the third person huh he speaks in the third person realizing these experiences he experienced himself great experiences I mean so much and the see things and hear things you know that unspeakable things that I like to show you just to really show you how different the the nature and character of God is versus the column nature in the fleshly nature of man because we wanted to me you know if we get up in those places we want everybody to know get the church I got a testimony well I have a dream I have it you might just eat too much that might not have been God but his power experiences things that is like man I ain't even you know what I haven't even said anything about people they they scrutinizing Paul's ministry and his Apostleship his authority and all anything trying to make for trying to make these so-called super apostles greater than God's anointed God called position in place the message of the age and you know like because I don't want to boast I don't want to make it like I'm this you know this great man I tell you what people like sometimes when you see that they eat you say what you saying that I'm in the scripture but it when you see these things a lot of times it it shows you it's no flat then the character of God right Amen because you know we want to point everything that God is there right Oh glory to his wonderful name see we we we want to profit what are the statement I wrote down cuz cuz we don't we don't want to boast within ourselves right because it's no profit this and and what we do as a Christians we want to profit we want to benefit right we want to be successful but we know those things come from Christ right amen see we want to be profitable for the kingdom of God right see listen church me preaching is not about me shining huh really it's not about me shining this it's not about me me me showing knowledge and things of that nature right my preaching is pointing us to to Christ showing us our airing wait come on making making sure we on the right track making sure we're not being deceived right because of y'all went back and read Satan's intent is to destroy the work of God see so it mean coming up o'clock I don't like to preach it's never was something that I wanted to do I just do it because I ain't got no choice right there's other things I could do for my health and for sure wouldn't be preaching but we do it not to be SH Mart but to benefit the kingdom of God by doing it right benefit the children of God right I doing it but outside of that way I wouldn't do it all right any man that's that's you know you in preaching and profiting right you want to see people grow you want to see people mature you want to see the young people grow the young people mature right amen but but like like I you know I was I was selling my church a little while ago but the young people just gotta make them a commitment I think I said this last week you just got to make a commitment right because if you don't if if you don't ever make a commitment then I can't help you write this it's a choice you you gotta make a choice right just like I had to make the choice every individual you've gotta make a choice see we will work what's happening what's happening with all the young people you know you know they're you know all these questions and did it people try to make it look like well it's the preachers fault how does our Father we come guys for provided way you be let you put you you try to do the best you can you it's it's an individual thing right free more Ages right and and see God gives you that choice thank God God haven't taken my choice from me if I wanna run around at the fool I can God didn't take that from me huh if I want to drink smoke cigarettes run around go to the club and your free moral agency Yukie if that's your choice you go do it but you gonna pay for it because the wage the wages of sin still there to be separated from God but you know we can we could all of us to the brothers our jobs you've been a Christian you could choose them go out then get you a but if you want to but you go paper I can use my mother-in-law she won't get mad at me folk get mad at me when I get the preaching sometime you know once it when she probably like but it's a choice it's a decision see y'all chose to be here you know what I didn't fight with nobody to be here tonight huh y'all came oh and y'all came here free will it was your choice you chose the hidden message tonight there was no choice come on you there was your choice and see if we could get that in the hearts and minds of of not just young people everybody if you've got to make a decision it's got to be your choice let me move on my time is moving all right but but watch Paul preaching in the third person to show them experiences but Paul Paul was not trying to read a little high on that right amen it wasn't something because it says I for Blair that someone should form an improper estimate of me not that's where we want to go right how does people see you when people see us how do people see us Paul you know if in piles and piles ministry in Paul's life Paul was concerned about how people saw him right that's death as a Christian right we have got to have that concern we gotta be a wit when people me how do they see me let's say that again to say that again when people see me how do they see me right well you know how do some people say you'd be like what you what you make you scratching hands like see you we could see what so-called Christianity has has come to this is why I'm grateful for the message God sent in a prophet because I had no clue what a true believer was supposed to look like in this day and see Paul was the standard in his day that still got the best standard in his day where's that where's a day see y'all live I'll help you out so y'all look around you you just you cuz God has always got a witness God always got some body on the earth that he could point to see ya that when the world see see see you they see you in a whole different light right you know look out people testify of the life that they see on your job in the community see amen Paul was concerned about that right let me read the description in jump it to a few things and then we get up out of here my key verses is right here he says for though I would desire to boast I should not be a fool for I will say the truth it like to say you know if I talk about the things it'll be writing this and then the other but that's not what it's all about but now I forbear lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be or that he heareth of me right well listen it is the verse six now y'all have to stay with me but for the next 15 minutes y'all alright watch this he says lest any man think of me the idea that it's this little commentary so but I think it's fitting see the idea in this part of the verse I take to be this I desire and expect to be estimated by my public life right amen I expect to be judged of men by my deeds by what they see in me this is the believer this is the life right God's Spirit right flowing free but by my general reputation in respect to what I have done in establishing the Christian Church right I'm I'm willing that my character I like that right like we say adoption is based upon character the Christian walk is based upon character I'm willing that my character and reputation that the estimate in which I shall be held by mankind shall rest on character not all of these super experiences right when I was I knew a man that was caught up not that right look you know like like you get these guys sounding like wrestlers I'm probably torn sold on the beat they're three days and five nights and come bring the chicken hill and I'm gonna be there be back and then he he properly he properly and then he goes somewhere and commit some kind of act you see Paul was not resting on all these supernatural experiences being elevated and things of that but we respect that right but he wanted mankind to rest upon the character that he displayed right see we cannot do away with Christian character well we you know we shouted I've seen so many people over the last 27 years almost better year something like everything else look III don't want to say this to be funny look at all the people when we first got sane we went to meet as we shot it when we cry we boohoo we shot we we did all of those different things right where's half those people those people right look since we've come out look at the other groups of people we didn't shot it with we have been in meetings with we then kuben Dobbin with huh where's those people okay see so it can't be that right something has got to come inside of the individual that testifies of something that's eternal something that's alive right I saw the ladies dead it's dead right something came inside of me that speaks of rest that speaks of victory come on y'all pretty now let's pick some joy did this speaks of a train changing my mind changing my walk you know I remember when I first got saved and you know trying them you know I was straight out of Jersey in you know still had a lot of hood and all of them was all of them was you know saved and everything and back then I guess because I got burned up a lot of sales you know I was moving slow and they thought that was cool Bob know that you know had all the swagger and they've all played at the bus riding a bus mighty cool and everything that I talked enough all right man no you don't want that you don't wanna lust after that that's death man I want to pick up the feet I want to pick up my boys I wouldn't I want some happiness enjoy that kind of swagger that's why I almost took me out right groaning but this joy I have the world didn't give it to me saying yes joy right but but let me let me keep going inside did I wish that my character among people shall be determined by my secret feelings or by my secret extra-ordinary communication from heaven which I may have you see we try we try to make those things supersede the life of Christ but watch this if we really watch something here now if we're really in those places right genuinely the life of Christ and God moving us in it should translate huh to public deeds if we're so deeply deeply revelaed it and boy I've been lifted up and man I saw the pillar fire and I this and that then if that's Ginuwine it should translate into public deeds and this is what paul is talking about because he was concerned how people how you know what people estimate of his of his life right that was that's important see what what should that should be important for the church how people perceive us right about what we do right doing the property yeah at home you know why I was in this because if we genuinely there it'll translate it'll move itself over right as we grow and mature in God right Oh glory to God lord help us he says which can let me back up is that I do not wish that my character among people shall be determined by my secret feelings Obama secret extraordinary communication from heaven which I may have which cannot be subjected to the observation of my fellow men I am willing to be estimated by my public life however valuable such extraordinary memory stations may be to me as an individual however much they may comfort me I do not wish to make that the basis of my public reputation right that's the half of that so you can see why Paul Paul being caught up right and realize okay no matter what that was all about that for the most part it was for me right but what I do out here that's what that's for me but that's also for the people right hey man that's what the people see well you know we come in the church and man Sunday we shouted awhile right but that was good in the building right come on that was that was good in the building see all of these things they're good in the building but what about our public life what about our public life see get the book of Acts right and we just a continuation of the book of Acts they they live such a a christ-like life that they would call Christians the people of that day they saw they saw Christ living in flesh right it hasn't changed right if if it's been the word see been grafted back in huh it's supposed to produce the same kind of church that because the Athleta me go to the same church right if the act if the our church was was a certain way didn't it then the restoration brings us back to an original right oh come on somebody did look I heard God then then look at the Alpha Church right they had everything in common they had a oneness they have a harmony amongst oh lord help us see but people get gratification and sometimes even ministers while I preach the deep when the right you know it's ironic we people will preach a sermon and then we can't stand outside and shake the people hand that we just preached to we have got so elevated we're we're so so deep and was so elevated now that you know we we got to be whisked off a lot of that stuff is called a counter impersonation I remember wheels out of meeting some years and years ago a long long time ago being brother Jack and everything he was a little offended he was he was a little hurt you know some brothers and priests him and he was trying to shake her brother hand and not get in the car get in the car but it's all about you know and I was like man don't worry about it brother nobody see if people thought what what's what's my reputation how does the public perceive me and as a minister of the gospel I don't want I don't want the you know people around in the public let's say so into himself man he can't shake nobody oh my god see I'm one way in the pulpit now when it comes down to the anointing the preaching of the gospel I won't see nobody I got family up in here but I don't see them right now that's why I take my glasses off it's all hard to baby see that clear oh when it comes to the gospel I don't know nobody I don't know my wife I don't know my children they be hot with me all the time they be hot with me all the time man my children see this is where sting could show up out of coming out there is it would a long time even my wife I have to slow it down for them a little bit I have to I have to be cautious are they feeling some time but it listen I'm only trying to give you truth right I love you it is what it did when he come down to the word of God I ain't gonna I know sugarcoat it for nobody now I set the brows know them and trying tired and then sat up under me for a little while not Shanda see because sister Brown look I was hard on them because they were family huh I'm gonna part thing while family but brother Jack Oh take it easy so mama's boy now you got the wrong man Jack Jack a lot like me that's why we work good together could you you you cannot help anybody be impartial huh you sir favoritism that the favorite family huh the fan family this is a fanfare now you can give on the fan all you want but when it come down to their word you got the line up just like anybody else see and and that's the only way you're gonna get Marty what people in rapturing condition you can't be posture you can't preach a passion gospel see pardon Paul didn't see any partiality what Paul was trying to get the Corinthian church that come back the dark because they were worried and then what Connell and they was they was missing the point and so he had to show restraint he had to show the character God sometimes even as Minister you got to show some restraint you know I've learned something over the years for my time going I've learned something over the years is that you can't beat it into people you you just got laid out there and give them space give God room to work let okay the God get alert you with a message you put it out there and then you just gotta let God like you know sometimes I hear brothers why brush my top bastard um well I tried blanch some days is over cuz it don't work I'm not saying there are times where you just do have to come out and say what needs to be said there are times but that there's times I've learned listen I'm perfect I'll be like God spare me please work with me Lord Jesus don't kill me cuz I'm a work in progress come on the world is perfect I write you we preach it a perfect gospel book but we're all coming to the unity of the faith and so you gotta be you gotta be patient you gotta be patient with your children parents right I'm telling you man I'm that girl I tolerate stuff that I never thought in a million years I will go for right but but I sit back in and sometimes it get to me why we getting Timmy well but I'll be like Lord help me be restraint restraint that's my word that's your word for the weak restraint restraint that's your word Rebecca that's your word it's a small wish that's the word she worried restraint what you think you have to you have to you have to show discipline as parents because you you could you could push sometimes I get to talking and I could just feel him whirling down I just I'd be wondering just break down huh like I told my church you know on Sunday afternoon I say I believe it's family time they're not I win I was impressed I saw sister brown children and Jimmy Jimmy darling granddaughter and different ones a this is this is this is the hour where I believe that God is doing something just sometimes you just got to be patient you know get up get out of the way just apply faith and get out of the way I'm finna go let the musicians come apply faith and I ain't get done but y'all get the gist thanks a lot I got but I know it'll take me another 30 minutes but just be patient you know if you got unsaved children be patient with him show them love you you watch God you watch God doing things you know God is doing stuff my said my son he surprised me he didn't he didn't know it and I was broke me down you know sometimes he'll say different things cuz sometimes we'd be sold so in in the flesh and not realize you know what maybe there's just a test for you I've tested your maturity cuz the time we get I'm telling you sometime we smoked some righteous that we realize and just for a minute God might allow them to have their season to see our reaction to the action to see if we gonna be all dignified and fail to realize that we were sinners Oh Cory that we messed up that we did all kinds of stuff and you know and but now we hold it and now we deep preachers and all that Garvey like that no you ain't you better back it up now because buddy and look at the beer like you know brother Brown that time you know brother brown and walked in the spot and and saw the old lady with the policing and they were crowded afresh afresh you know and and and you know he was also promises what subjects happened like like a ball of fire come down and put them all up in this than yelling and God yeah yeah young man come on round two coming here come on come on come on let's have a conference I said let's talk this thing I took the proper route of Kota and when he got finished with him like Oh Lord you mean give me I'm that bad I'm not bad so water full of blood oh that's me right oh brother brother sense things and we think it's stories and all of that no it's revelation sometimes when we go to criticize and really really take a real good long look at yourself then you'll be like Lord whatever you do whatever you do don't take me out like this look let me come into my full season kind where I supposed to be you know what church I think as a church if we could if we could all you know pray for one another humble ourselves and and and spend time with God about ourselves will be better on people be better our people could see all that the father give us that is this upon prescription all that the father's giving them they don't come that's why you you worry about all of young people but better worry about my own self my own children and family and church and stuff I can't worry about are you knocking care I care about other things of that nature but when it comes down to Redemption I'm gonna make a powerful statement cuz he sometimes I I know people just don't be thinking they already redeemed okay you better come home they already you see you got you can sit there uh you got to think about something and we give you this little point and I'm ago I didn't get the way I want to go y'all better good audience I appreciate it their name was already written sequel folks well folks in maturity understanding me fussing and looking for young people in you preachers destiny I really put yeah grow up and look at the Bible give me the Bible just give me the Bible for what you only understand it now yeah that's what God got us all he is in the wing that's why I'll be standing in a way huh why because I look at things and I think about things he show me things [Music] why does young people if they name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world tako better it might be overnight churches get fooled up right now look bad it looked depressing I will have a youth feet nobody show up be like a depression I mean I lay eggs they probably that were you meeting in the Smalley family pray for this body kids be here and the boy people be here literally you Paulo how do you see the flowery pray for but I the revelation of my fave dig obedia hey they're gonna be there today it's a lot going on but God is working on a song God God is working a resolve as far as our concern I see them where they supposed to be I see them I'm not moving I am not moving ever never I'm not moving and no matter what the devil doing I'm the head and I'm not moving and God's got to do what God's got to do so so listen Church don't be discouraged be encouraged keep pressing about if you fall get back up again Donnie McClurkin says singing just assume it fell down but he gets back up hey man let us understand we have a quick prayer I turn it back over to brother Troy y'all pray well Jack I have a safe return and I really appreciated my time of being here I've been thoroughly revived some things I was just it's been a blessing
