[1:03:56] that right we just we just gonna enjoy
[1:03:58] ourselves in Jesus Amen I want to read a
[1:04:02] man from two portions of Scripture today
[1:04:04] one found in 2nd Timothy chapter 3 a man
[1:04:10] 2nd Timothy chapter 3 in verse 16 and
[1:04:14] then the other will be found in Exodus
[1:04:16] 14 to short passages but I trusted the
[1:04:20] Lord help us to bring a manís thought
[1:04:23] together 2nd Timothy chapter 3 verse 16
[1:04:26] says all Scripture is given by
[1:04:28] inspiration of God and is profitable for
[1:04:34] doctrine for reproof for correction for
[1:04:37] instruction in righteousness
[1:04:41] a man so all Scripture is given by
[1:04:42] inspiration of God and is profitable for
[1:04:45] doctrine for reproof for correction for
[1:04:47] instruction in righteousness and let's
[1:04:51] just go over to Exodus 14 we man
[1:04:57] Lord Amen Exodus 14 and just reading
[1:05:04] here Amen verse 13 starting at verse 13
[1:05:11] I'm sorry yeah yeah verse 13 says it
[1:05:15] Moses said unto the people fear ye not
[1:05:19] stand still and see the salvation of the
[1:05:22] Lord which he will show to you today for
[1:05:27] the Egyptians whom ye have seen today ye
[1:05:33] shall see them again no more forever
[1:05:37] when verse 14 says this the Lord shall
[1:05:43] fight for you and ye shall hold your
[1:05:47] peace man praise the Lord
[1:05:52] hey man just tell us about the Lord
[1:05:54] gonna fight for you just have a word of
[1:06:03] Prayer father how grateful we are for
[1:06:06] your word it's inspiring to us it
[1:06:11] strengthens us it helps us wherever we
[1:06:14] are whatever things that we are facing
[1:06:16] the word has a way of speaking to our
[1:06:19] conditions Lord we pray that you would
[1:06:22] speak this morning to every need we take
[1:06:25] every spirit that's against the Spirit
[1:06:27] of God underneath the control of the
[1:06:28] Holy Ghost and we trust Oh God that uh
[1:06:32] that you would just take control of
[1:06:34] every thought help us to Center our
[1:06:36] thoughts around what we've just read as
[1:06:39] we send our thoughts around that we gain
[1:06:40] inspiration to change the situations
[1:06:43] that we are involved in we go to work we
[1:06:46] go to school we go to all these places
[1:06:47] God and just devil is attacking us on
[1:06:50] every side but God would come here to
[1:06:52] the house of the Lord to give him to
[1:06:53] your presence so we can get something
[1:06:55] fresh a man to overcome the enemy so
[1:06:58] speak father and only a way that you can
[1:07:00] today's in Jesus name we pray amen amen
[1:07:03] god bless you you can
[1:07:05] seated a man those scriptures a man can
[1:07:10] just be preached from so many different
[1:07:12] angles especially as we read there from
[1:07:15] 2nd Timothy 3:16 a man tell us that all
[1:07:18] Scripture is given a man by inspiration
[1:07:21] and the inspiration of God is profitable
[1:07:25] for doctrine for reproof for correction
[1:07:26] for instruction and righteousness
[1:07:29] various things can be said there but I
[1:07:31] want to just take for our subject today
[1:07:33] just a word inspiration a man
[1:07:36] inspiration just want to just want to
[1:07:38] use that and I'm pulling from a quote
[1:07:42] here that I read some time ago and just
[1:07:45] been holding amen this dear to my heart
[1:07:47] out of the message here you him the
[1:07:50] Prophet makes a statement here and here
[1:07:53] you him and he says now when a man is
[1:07:57] inspired and he reads the inspired Word
[1:08:03] says the two inspirations together gives
[1:08:07] a result so it's one thing a man for you
[1:08:10] to be inspired hallelujah amen but if
[1:08:14] you're inspired without the word there
[1:08:17] won't be a result come on somebody
[1:08:20] amen and it's another thing we already
[1:08:22] know the scripture is inspired because
[1:08:26] all scripture amen is given by the
[1:08:29] inspiration of God so God not write
[1:08:32] things just to be writing things he's
[1:08:34] trying to inspire you so what the
[1:08:36] Prophet assumes that when your
[1:08:37] inspiration comes in contact with the
[1:08:40] scriptures inspiration then we'll see
[1:08:43] some results hey man he says now when a
[1:08:47] man and when a man is inspired and he
[1:08:50] reads the inspired Word the two
[1:08:52] inspirations together gives a result now
[1:08:55] no matter how well you study the word it
[1:08:59] never do you know good till your inspire
[1:09:01] yourself it takes your inspiration the
[1:09:05] words already inspired any man he goes
[1:09:08] on a little further says so what we need
[1:09:10] today it's an inspiration over us I
[1:09:14] believe that what we need today is an
[1:09:18] inspiration you want to see some things
[1:09:19] change you want to see some things fixed
[1:09:22] a man what you gonna need today is a new
[1:09:25] inspiration a fresh inspiration coming
[1:09:28] from the Word of God to change your
[1:09:30] situation come on somebody look at this
[1:09:32] he says it says I'm not sure what we nee
[1:09:34] today's an inspiration over us
[1:09:36] God sweeping down with the new
[1:09:39] inspiration and breathing over us his
[1:09:43] power and his love and himself that it
[1:09:47] might inspire us to quicken and waken us
[1:09:51] to his words
[1:09:54] hallelujah I like that we want to be
[1:09:56] quickened to the word and then the word
[1:09:58] being brought into that spirit of
[1:10:01] inspiration then you'll see miracles
[1:10:04] happen and things take place because the
[1:10:07] two just come together and he goes we're
[1:10:10] saying brother Joseph I just saw just
[1:10:12] printed a message that I was preaching a
[1:10:13] three-sport on the Dove and the lamb
[1:10:15] many of us has read it how that only two
[1:10:18] that could get along with the Dove was
[1:10:20] the weakest of all the birds of heaven
[1:10:21] and the lamb was the weakest of all the
[1:10:23] animals on the earth and the Dove could
[1:10:26] not come and abide upon a wolf it could
[1:10:28] not abide upon nature because her nature
[1:10:32] was different and she could only about
[1:10:34] weather nature was the same as her so
[1:10:36] now he's talking about a man these two
[1:10:38] inspirations and how we got to get your
[1:10:41] inspiration connected with God's
[1:10:42] inspiration then we'll see some results
[1:10:45] now I looked at I looked at a word here
[1:10:47] just just kind of looking up this word
[1:10:49] inspiration it's the process of being
[1:10:52] mentally stimulated to do or feel
[1:10:56] something especially to do something
[1:10:59] creative
[1:11:01] listen the it's racist the process of
[1:11:04] being mentally stimulated Amen because
[1:11:09] you got to understand that before you
[1:11:12] see anything in the natural you have to
[1:11:15] first see it in the spiritual hallelujah
[1:11:18] and oftentimes Amen for you to grab a
[1:11:21] hold of something in faith you're gonna
[1:11:23] have to catch it in the spirit realm
[1:11:26] hallelujah
[1:11:27] you're gonna have to be mentally
[1:11:29] stimulated glory to God that mean you
[1:11:32] got to catch inspiration
[1:11:34] do you realize before the seat that you
[1:11:38] can sit in a man was made somebody
[1:11:42] caught inspiration they were inspired to
[1:11:46] put four legs amen oh no on the bottom
[1:11:50] and and then maybe maybe I they started
[1:11:53] just with the four legs on the bottom so
[1:11:54] now we don't need something to rest our
[1:11:56] back on the DNA made something for the
[1:11:58] back to support the back somebody was
[1:12:00] inspired amen to create that seat God
[1:12:04] gave them that inspiration hallelujah
[1:12:07] Amen before anything takes place in amen
[1:12:10] the physical realm it has to come
[1:12:12] through inspiration the Prophet makes a
[1:12:15] statement a man it says let me just see
[1:12:18] if I can find all real has to come
[1:12:21] through inspiration I want you to catch
[1:12:24] that all real has to come by inspiration
[1:12:27] all real everything you see that's real
[1:12:30] it came by inspiration now let's go on
[1:12:33] and look at this or again inspiration is
[1:12:35] the process of being mentally stimulated
[1:12:37] to do or feel something especially to do
[1:12:40] something creative now when we look at
[1:12:43] the universe we see the inspiration of
[1:12:45] God right when you just look at there's
[1:12:48] the moon and the stars and a man
[1:12:50] galaxies and planets and you know and
[1:12:52] everything it's all the inspiration of
[1:12:55] God that's just very earth that we live
[1:12:57] on is the inspiration of God
[1:12:59] man God saw when he looked at the earth
[1:13:02] the Bible says that it was null it was
[1:13:04] void said darkness was upon the face of
[1:13:06] the deep in man and pretty much when
[1:13:08] when when I when I look at that
[1:13:09] scripture I can say when God looked at
[1:13:11] the earth he saw nothing hallelujah he
[1:13:14] saw nothing a man but but because of
[1:13:17] inspiration he turned nothing into
[1:13:20] something
[1:13:21] whoa hallelujah all real comes by
[1:13:25] inspiration so if God had that quality
[1:13:29] in him where he can turn nothing into
[1:13:31] something and he has made you a son and
[1:13:35] a daughter of God then the same team
[1:13:37] that was in God has been passed down to
[1:13:40] you and you're gonna have to catch
[1:13:41] things by inspiration before we saw like
[1:13:45] God was inspired to call for light
[1:13:48] hallelujah amen he said let there be and
[1:13:52] there was a man his design of the
[1:13:55] galaxies the Stars the plans to put them
[1:13:57] all in their places he meant all that
[1:13:58] was done by inspiration man was made in
[1:14:02] the image of God amen by inspiration
[1:14:05] hallelujah hallelujah and I want you to
[1:14:08] I want you to kind of catch something
[1:14:10] today because I want to speak to a man
[1:14:12] gesture and maybe to your personal
[1:14:14] situations that you might be going
[1:14:15] through businesses are started because
[1:14:18] of inspiration books are written because
[1:14:23] of inspiration songs are written because
[1:14:28] of inspiration and not only are songs
[1:14:31] written because of inspiration but songs
[1:14:34] conozco also be same because of
[1:14:37] inspiration hallelujah
[1:14:39] it's not just getting up singing
[1:14:41] whatever
[1:14:43] hallelujah but but when a person is
[1:14:46] inspired to sing a particular song at a
[1:14:50] particular site at a particular time you
[1:14:52] will you begin to see not only that's
[1:14:54] that inspiration flow through them but
[1:14:57] it begins to flow to others my god
[1:15:00] because even when one person is inspired
[1:15:03] through through inspire preached hidden
[1:15:05] you can be delivered hallelujah through
[1:15:09] an inspired song you can be set free
[1:15:12] they made inspiration will feed more
[1:15:15] inspiration
[1:15:18] amen lives of change because of
[1:15:21] inspiration but it's not just any old
[1:15:25] type of it's rich it's your inspiration
[1:15:27] being connected with God's inspiration
[1:15:30] it will produce a result I love this see
[1:15:36] businesses are started because of
[1:15:38] inspiration books are written because of
[1:15:40] inspiration songs are written and sing
[1:15:42] because of inspiration poems are written
[1:15:45] by inspiration buildings and houses and
[1:15:48] bridges are meet because of inspiration
[1:15:52] I like this right you know I mean if
[1:15:57] you're not under inspiration when you're
[1:15:59] doing something it turn out it's a flop
[1:16:02] have any I'll ever track now I'll be
[1:16:04] honest I tried to write songs you know
[1:16:07] and I you know you think these words go
[1:16:09] together and you just start putting them
[1:16:11] on paper and then you you know you look
[1:16:13] at it later on like what in the world
[1:16:15] was I writing see where was no
[1:16:17] inspiration
[1:16:19] Oh hallelujah amen you can do a lot of
[1:16:22] things and without inspiration specially
[1:16:24] a godly inspiration you'll get nothing
[1:16:26] from it no resource at all but when you
[1:16:28] connect that thing to the Word of God
[1:16:30] you'll see great things happen connect
[1:16:33] your business to God's Word hallelujah
[1:16:37] connect your business to God amen
[1:16:39] whatever you do in word of doody word or
[1:16:42] deed do it all for the glory of God
[1:16:44] once god bless your business hallelujah
[1:16:48] not because everybody else doing that
[1:16:50] because God gave you the idea God
[1:16:53] inspired you amen no matter how many
[1:16:56] other folk out there doing it
[1:16:58] if God has spiars you and you step by
[1:16:59] own God's inspiration you will see
[1:17:02] things coming to pass
[1:17:04] hallelujah all right all right all right
[1:17:07] Amen I was looking at Amen a look look
[1:17:10] look quote here from it wasn't so from
[1:17:13] the beginning and you know even as
[1:17:16] ministers we get inspiration from one
[1:17:18] from the other right I listen to another
[1:17:20] preacher preach and I start writing
[1:17:22] notes any I know something they don't do
[1:17:24] that number we used to when we go to
[1:17:28] church we take not only our Bible we
[1:17:30] have one of these right we take this to
[1:17:34] church with us
[1:17:34] and we have a pen with us and when
[1:17:37] something is spoken by inspiration we
[1:17:40] write it down you know because when
[1:17:43] you're in the channel that's the only
[1:17:45] time you're gonna receive right but when
[1:17:48] you get out of the channel Amen you need
[1:17:50] to go back to read what was given to you
[1:17:54] why you was in the channel hallelujah
[1:17:57] Amen so you got to learn to take notes
[1:17:59] some us a smart like that we just
[1:18:02] remember all kind of things but you got
[1:18:04] to learn to take notes when you're
[1:18:05] underneath inspiration because that's
[1:18:07] gonna feed you one day that's gonna help
[1:18:10] you through some situation one day when
[1:18:13] you go back and just look in that
[1:18:14] notebook of all these look thoughts of
[1:18:16] inspiration
[1:18:18] hallelujah amen one little doctor really
[1:18:22] can lead to Whoopi written one more
[1:18:25] thought can lead to song being written
[1:18:27] one little thought can change situations
[1:18:32] it's racing a very powerful thing the
[1:18:36] Prophet was in church one time and I
[1:18:39] won't try to catch this we're gonna read
[1:18:41] something here
[1:18:42] a man he was in church and he made a
[1:18:44] comment here in this message it was a it
[1:18:47] was it was it wasn't so for them again
[1:18:50] he said that's right you can always tell
[1:18:52] a Christian many of course are women not
[1:18:57] with manicure ever what's tough is they
[1:19:00] wear not wearing that but I mean you can
[1:19:02] tell it otherwise they're just marked
[1:19:05] and a Christian has an atmosphere
[1:19:07] because though he is a son and a
[1:19:10] daughter of God he is a creator a
[1:19:13] Christian has an atmosphere though he is
[1:19:16] a son a daughter of god he is a creator
[1:19:19] look at this ever who that little fellow
[1:19:22] us teach them Sunday School there this
[1:19:24] morning I sure appreciate that message
[1:19:27] not brother branham in a church
[1:19:28] listening to a brother teach Sunday
[1:19:30] School and it says he was alright I
[1:19:33] liked it he says you the brother well
[1:19:37] right here well that's fine you formally
[1:19:39] must have must have been a Baptist
[1:19:41] because I could tell the way you was
[1:19:43] talking it kind of it kind of puts a
[1:19:45] little mark back there but will outlive
[1:19:48] her he's joking with him there says you
[1:19:49] see now now Baptist brother would just
[1:19:51] kindly wanted to teach she want 131 to
[1:19:54] each other but it cuz but but when he
[1:19:56] said the expression that he made I
[1:19:59] jotted it down on a piece of paper so
[1:20:04] the Prophet taking notes why he in
[1:20:06] Sunday school all right
[1:20:09] hallelujah the promise say
[1:20:13] shut it down on a piece of paper now
[1:20:15] watch what this brother said I'll pick
[1:20:17] it up out in the office there
[1:20:19] - I'm impotence met that's all the
[1:20:23] Prophet wrote down its to omnipotence
[1:20:26] men they said that's true when God and a
[1:20:31] believer nice there's two omnipotence
[1:20:35] cuz God a man is a part of God he is a
[1:20:39] son of God and he says and when and when
[1:20:42] that little he joins it joins with the
[1:20:45] entire body
[1:20:46] and Jesus said over mark 11:22 if you
[1:20:49] say to this mountain be moved on down in
[1:20:51] your heart but believe what you said you
[1:20:53] can it will come to pass believe that
[1:20:55] what you said in a Christian is so murk
[1:20:57] and around him it's an atmosphere now
[1:21:00] all he did was just take that note to
[1:21:02] omnipotence meant he heard her brother
[1:21:05] teaching that and Sunday school and he
[1:21:07] drew inspiration from it now I'm gonna
[1:21:09] pick up later on in his ministry where
[1:21:12] he brings this start out this is out of
[1:21:15] the pat mcpherson see he took the note
[1:21:18] that he got from inspiration hallelujah
[1:21:21] amen and then he goes back to it and
[1:21:23] picks it up and then it begins to
[1:21:25] expound upon it a little bit more
[1:21:27] because God just begins to reveal more -
[1:21:29] on that little thought that he heard in
[1:21:33] Sunday school let me go a little further
[1:21:37] they say the patmans preacher says
[1:21:39] hallelujah amen that's what the prophecy
[1:21:42] amen cut every obstacle from human
[1:21:46] beings that they might be connected like
[1:21:48] in the name the Garden of Eden said I
[1:21:51] was gonna choke it but I'm gonna say it
[1:21:53] man it's omnipotence I mean man is
[1:21:57] all-powerful
[1:21:58] that man is all-powerful since man is
[1:22:03] omnipotent you don't believe that but he
[1:22:05] is a man fully surrendered to God is
[1:22:09] omnipotent
[1:22:11] hallelujah amen did not he see him mark
[1:22:14] 11:22 whatsoever things you say and
[1:22:17] don't doubt in your heart it'll come to
[1:22:20] pass you can have what you said I love
[1:22:24] it he goes on what happens when to
[1:22:27] omnipotence meets when God and man comes
[1:22:31] together through our nipa tense
[1:22:33] something's got to say whatever you say
[1:22:37] with that creative power of omnipotence
[1:22:39] of God knowing that he's promised it and
[1:22:42] he said it in this word it creates a
[1:22:46] power oh I like this it creates a power
[1:22:50] that goes out yonder and brings that
[1:22:54] thing to pass things that it's not it
[1:22:59] makes them as though they are amen
[1:23:03] because to omnipotence have met there
[1:23:07] he's danced oh isn't he wonderful you
[1:23:10] know I you know as I was reading this
[1:23:12] and just kind of meditating on this
[1:23:13] because see this is you know you have
[1:23:15] your own inspiration right God has given
[1:23:18] it by you being made in the image of God
[1:23:20] God was inspired everything you see in
[1:23:22] this earth was come from the inspiration
[1:23:23] of God so that that that power that
[1:23:26] Lading God you being a son of God you've
[1:23:29] been a daughter of God that same power
[1:23:30] lays in you hallelujah amen but you
[1:23:34] won't see anything till you can get
[1:23:35] inspired to see it alright listen when
[1:23:39] you made the statement here it takes
[1:23:41] your inspiration with the word that's
[1:23:44] already inspired I just begin to kind of
[1:23:47] question that to myself amen what is
[1:23:50] your inspiration what is your
[1:23:52] inspiration right and I start you know I
[1:23:55] know that it should be there because
[1:23:57] we're made in the image of God I know
[1:23:58] that it's supposed to be there but but
[1:24:00] what is your inspiration and any just as
[1:24:03] I as I began to meditate on it I felt
[1:24:05] that we probably would not recognize
[1:24:07] what our inspiration was until we found
[1:24:11] ourselves in a moment of great trial I
[1:24:16] think that's when you find out what your
[1:24:18] true inspiration is
[1:24:20] it's when you're going through something
[1:24:21] a man then you then you force the camera
[1:24:25] a man be something that's it didn't want
[1:24:27] to be you forced the camera elevate into
[1:24:31] a level that you didn't really want to
[1:24:33] what you were comfortable just let God
[1:24:35] take care of it
[1:24:37] hallelujah but there are some things God
[1:24:40] wants you to take care of
[1:24:42] hallelujah somebody right a man look now
[1:24:45] now you know I just read that scripture
[1:24:47] and I'm gonna come back to it here and
[1:24:48] in Exodus because what we read about
[1:24:51] Moses Moses did that by inspiration God
[1:24:55] didn't tell Moses to do that God never
[1:24:58] told Moses just just to say the
[1:25:00] Egyptians you've seen today you'll see
[1:25:03] no more forever God didn't tell Moses to
[1:25:05] say that right Moses got into that
[1:25:08] situation because the people were afraid
[1:25:11] Oh hallelujah fear has the people a man
[1:25:15] they were looking here we are a man
[1:25:17] facing the Red Sea this thing looks
[1:25:20] insurmountable if I can use the word
[1:25:24] impossible how are we gonna get across
[1:25:26] the Red Sea Moses where the boss where
[1:25:30] are the ships well I mean how are we
[1:25:34] supposed to get across this situation
[1:25:36] not only I was facing Morenci now we
[1:25:38] hear Pharaoh's army is right behind us
[1:25:41] and he knows I mean the people know
[1:25:44] Pharaoh and his armor they're upset we
[1:25:47] don't die right here at the Red Sea now
[1:25:50] under this type of pressure
[1:25:52] Moses rather than buckle and a man he
[1:25:56] stood up and set before he cried cuz he
[1:25:59] did cry he did cry amen
[1:26:03] but before he cried he spoke hallelujah
[1:26:07] amen and he stood up to a man he stood
[1:26:09] up before the people who say these
[1:26:11] citizens that you have seen today he
[1:26:15] said fear not the Egyptians who I seem
[1:26:18] to think you shall see them no more
[1:26:20] forever now do you realize when Moses
[1:26:23] said that he had nothing
[1:26:26] hallelujah nothing from God to give him
[1:26:30] the authority that is speaking he had no
[1:26:33] word from the Lord
[1:26:34] he had no tests at the Lord I want to
[1:26:39] put it this way the reason he didn't
[1:26:41] have a bus at the Lord it's because the
[1:26:44] thus says the Lord was already so when
[1:27:01] you up against the Lord toward adjouris
[1:27:09] riches in glory when the devil is
[1:27:11] attacking your body by His stripes I'm
[1:27:20] inspired by the Word of God
[1:27:24] stripes I am healed
[1:27:30] inspiration strikes you when you're
[1:27:33] going through talking to a friend of
[1:27:39] mine Oh yesterday and he was saying how
[1:27:43] I wish I was wrote the scripture down
[1:27:47] it's not no side of Proverbs but he was
[1:27:50] saying how you know the doctors that
[1:27:51] coming to the room in and began to tell
[1:27:54] them to just give up on mama give up on
[1:27:57] her she's not gonna make you give up on
[1:27:59] him he's like no wait a minute we were
[1:28:00] doing this we were doing that we were
[1:28:02] doing this and I thought you notice what
[1:28:03] the other doctor said no we telling you
[1:28:05] just give up on y'all stop this well no
[1:28:08] we can't we can't do that you know I
[1:28:10] mean we got to keep trying so you know
[1:28:13] they were going back and forth and when
[1:28:14] the doctor says this to you hey man it
[1:28:16] just kind of weakens your face so you
[1:28:21] know this friend and his family they
[1:28:22] begin the count of weep and cry and and
[1:28:24] you had one pessimist you know in in a
[1:28:28] group amen so much got friends like that
[1:28:31] the pessimist and they like to tell you
[1:28:34] just an optimist yes I am
[1:28:37] a man I'd rather believe in doubt
[1:28:40] because believe in can change things I'm
[1:28:45] willing to accept God's will but I know
[1:28:47] that I'm I fainted change stands so if
[1:28:51] this is an opportunity for me to
[1:28:52] exercise my face then let me exercise my
[1:28:55] faith don't think I don't lost my mind
[1:28:59] because things didn't go the way that I
[1:29:01] that I was expected to do just like you
[1:29:05] know I'm gonna keep going back to church
[1:29:06] even if God take my love when I'm going
[1:29:08] back to church so how can you believe a
[1:29:11] god like that well how can you believe a
[1:29:14] doctor like that that doctor that lost
[1:29:16] patience but you go right back to his
[1:29:19] office prays alone but he say he said
[1:29:25] they were you know tell them all this
[1:29:26] and they just begin to get a little
[1:29:27] discouraged so he got her talking it
[1:29:29] with a another brother a manatee and the
[1:29:33] brother Tom say I see after they laid
[1:29:35] out all this problems he's a nice time
[1:29:37] for you to exercise your Christian faith
[1:29:38] he said now tell me what scripture
[1:29:41] you're standing on now you don't told me
[1:29:44] about your problems but what Scripture
[1:29:45] are you standing on and they say you say
[1:29:47] uh you know I didn't I hadn't thought
[1:29:49] about in fact you know actually while I
[1:29:51] was going through I didn't even think to
[1:29:53] read the Word of God so he saved you
[1:29:56] getting to read and he read something in
[1:29:59] Proverbs about you know the word
[1:30:02] providing health to us or something like
[1:30:03] that I forget exactly what what I said
[1:30:05] but he said he took that one scripture
[1:30:08] out of Proverbs and and he just began to
[1:30:11] speak fit words over his mother
[1:30:14] encouraging words over mom and used to
[1:30:16] say he would just start saying because
[1:30:18] see my momma was losing and then how her
[1:30:20] mind there a little bit and you know and
[1:30:22] they couldn't talk to the way they used
[1:30:24] to talk to it he say just begin to tell
[1:30:26] her say mom I just appreciate and my mom
[1:30:29] grateful for how you raised me and mama
[1:30:31] you did this and the mama you did that
[1:30:33] and mama mama you did this and I'm so
[1:30:36] grateful them before you Northey the
[1:30:38] inspiration
[1:30:40] struck his sister and it's just
[1:30:43] beginning to say yes mama you did this
[1:30:45] for me and then mama you did Saturn and
[1:30:48] mommy you did that and before you know
[1:30:49] it all the pessimism was hard to rule
[1:30:52] amen and everybody was optimistic and
[1:30:55] when the doctors are giving up on mama
[1:30:57] those fit words begin to change mama and
[1:31:02] her reactions begin to be normal because
[1:31:05] she heard it words why she was
[1:31:07] underneath Amen that condition
[1:31:09] hallelujah they were inspired by the
[1:31:12] Word of God and through that inspiration
[1:31:15] they change the situation in that room
[1:31:18] if you can ever get inspired by the Word
[1:31:22] of God you will see your circumstances
[1:31:25] change you will see your situations
[1:31:28] change but you must be inspired by
[1:31:33] what's already inspired because all
[1:31:36] scripture amen is given by inspiration
[1:31:40] the thing changed mama left that
[1:31:42] hospital and went home never giving up
[1:31:48] on mama mama left the hospital we're
[1:31:51] home now we know one day mama gonna have
[1:31:54] to go a man but they can stop at least
[1:31:57] thank God for that miracle
[1:31:59] oh I'm a spy it what is what is your
[1:32:08] inspiration right I believe it comes
[1:32:11] when you're going through see when Moses
[1:32:15] and the children of Israel were going
[1:32:17] through you know he spoke these words
[1:32:19] out of Exodus 14 say standstill verse 13
[1:32:23] Moses said unto the people fear do not
[1:32:26] stand still now he's just making this up
[1:32:28] as he go God had told him to say this to
[1:32:31] the people fear you not stand still and
[1:32:35] see the salvation of the Lord now he put
[1:32:37] it right back on God when he pretty much
[1:32:39] sentence I'm not gonna do this but God
[1:32:42] is see the salvation of the Lord which
[1:32:45] he he put it all on God which he will
[1:32:50] show to you today I can see my most God
[1:32:53] you don't put me out here now I'm gonna
[1:32:55] have to put you out here hallelujah Amen
[1:32:58] I'm stepping out on faith I'm I got it
[1:33:01] you told me to bring the people to this
[1:33:03] spot I came here by faith I did not know
[1:33:06] when I got here that you weren't gonna
[1:33:08] open up the sea like that I didn't know
[1:33:11] that she was gonna let Pharaoh's army
[1:33:13] chase us I didn't know he was gonna do
[1:33:16] that but God allowed Moses to get into
[1:33:20] this situation in order to resurrect
[1:33:23] something that was already inside of
[1:33:26] losers he would have never saw it if he
[1:33:29] had not come through it
[1:33:33] and that's a thanks you would have never
[1:33:35] know what's inside of you the only time
[1:33:38] you see him is when you come in to test
[1:33:40] a trial so that's why you got to learn
[1:33:44] the praise card in the midst of whatever
[1:33:46] you're going through hey glory to God if
[1:33:53] you learn how to worship Him in the
[1:33:55] midst of it you watch you you see your
[1:33:58] worship will change your attitude your
[1:34:01] worship will change your outlook your
[1:34:09] worship changes things
[1:34:10] hey man church blown in a guy your
[1:34:15] worship begins to change it Halloween no
[1:34:18] matter what she's going through no
[1:34:21] matter what she's going through
[1:34:22] [Applause]
[1:34:25] they might have told you no but your
[1:34:29] worship will change it to a yes
[1:34:34] Wow brother Jack how can you say that
[1:34:37] because the prophecy the right mental
[1:34:45] will change any situation so yes racist
[1:34:51] starts mentally right inspiration starts
[1:34:55] mentally you know let me let me read
[1:34:59] this can see inspiration oh my god
[1:35:03] I come back to that inspiration is how
[1:35:06] we got the the masterpiece Moses
[1:35:12] [Music]
[1:35:13] Michelangelo where he was designing that
[1:35:16] masterpiece
[1:35:17] the man was moving by a mental picture
[1:35:21] let me tell you this my Michelangelo had
[1:35:25] never seen a picture of Moses never the
[1:35:31] man who never said no I mean there was
[1:35:33] nothing that he could look at that that
[1:35:36] was show what Moses looked like no
[1:35:43] evidence at all no artist ever took it
[1:35:49] upon themselves they're trying to draw
[1:35:51] Moses so the man had nothing to look at
[1:35:56] and you can see him a man taking this
[1:36:00] chip of marble and he begins to chip a
[1:36:03] little bit here and it chip a little bit
[1:36:06] there and I can imagine all the critics
[1:36:09] coming by what are you forming here
[1:36:13] don't worry I'll worry about it I'll
[1:36:15] tell you later
[1:36:16] and he just keep chipping and they keep
[1:36:19] chipping and he's doing all the chipping
[1:36:21] by inspiration I want to tell you
[1:36:23] something there's some things when
[1:36:24] you're doing it by inspiration you can't
[1:36:26] explain it to everybody else you can't
[1:36:30] share with everybody else because they
[1:36:33] don't see what you see amen they don't
[1:36:40] see what you see so sorry just shipping
[1:36:42] and shipping and shipping and he's four
[1:36:45] minutes imaging and then they said now
[1:36:47] we know we see a man but who is this man
[1:36:50] my glass I'll tell you just keep
[1:36:53] shipping and keep carving to keep dish
[1:36:54] to keep that and keep hallelujah and I
[1:36:58] think finally told somebody maybe might
[1:37:00] have told somebody say this is Moses
[1:37:02] Michelangelo you ain't never seen Moses
[1:37:04] in your life how you know this is Moses
[1:37:06] because this is what I saw in my
[1:37:08] inspiration and see what he saw in his
[1:37:13] mind mentally he finally formed it and
[1:37:17] it become material and when it became
[1:37:22] real
[1:37:23] oh I hope y'all can follow me on this
[1:37:27] amen this is just like it is with God a
[1:37:30] man God thoughts for us were real folks
[1:37:34] at the beginning you know God was
[1:37:37] fellowshiping with you before you even
[1:37:38] got here y'all might not know might not
[1:37:44] understand God was God was enjoying your
[1:37:48] worship before you even got here
[1:37:51] brother Jack how can you see that well
[1:37:53] the Bible say where were you Joe said
[1:37:58] where were you when the sons of God
[1:38:03] sit down when the sons of God just
[1:38:07] stared and looked notice something
[1:38:10] godless but they were shouting for what
[1:38:15] shall I praise God amen new date I mean
[1:38:20] they one day I mean you oughta have joy
[1:38:22] even when you're peels man you wanna
[1:38:24] have so when the devil attacking your
[1:38:27] body praise God you still wanna have joy
[1:38:30] the Songwriters thing I still have joy I
[1:38:34] still have joy after all the things I've
[1:38:38] been through I still have joy
[1:38:45] Michelangelo say it say this Moses and
[1:38:50] he was so inspired by what had come out
[1:38:52] of his mind into reality the
[1:38:55] Michelangelo took his his his his thing
[1:38:58] that he was chiseling with and he struck
[1:39:00] it on the knee he is so hard that it
[1:39:08] chipped it and a very thing a man that
[1:39:12] he had been waiting on I mean trying to
[1:39:14] bring it to perfection
[1:39:15] now he's damaged it but when he did that
[1:39:17] he see there he yelled and screamed at
[1:39:20] Moses this is a man that is moving by
[1:39:23] inspiration he's speaking to a rock
[1:39:29] [Applause]
[1:39:31] because Moses himself spoke to a rock
[1:39:36] now Michelangelo by inspiration is
[1:39:40] speaking to a rock and he said speak
[1:39:48] Moses inspiration might make some of
[1:39:56] y'all look like you lost your mind but
[1:40:00] you're moving by something that other
[1:40:02] people can not see Halina inspiration
[1:40:08] see we can have the church inspiration
[1:40:11] sake we can have the school inspiration
[1:40:15] say it'll be like me saying if you say
[1:40:20] to the mountain be thou removed and
[1:40:23] don't doubt in your heart you can have
[1:40:26] what you say why it's per a sudden
[1:40:30] [Applause]
[1:40:37] you got to have some inspiration you
[1:40:41] find it in Scripture Moses when he spoke
[1:40:45] these words in Exodus 14 that Moses was
[1:40:48] was was challenged the Red Sea in front
[1:40:53] of him Pharaoh's army behind him he's in
[1:40:55] a dire straight he's been in between a
[1:40:59] rock and a hard place
[1:41:01] and rather than Moses a man let me let
[1:41:06] me put is what he did cry we didn't read
[1:41:08] that he did cry but before he cried he
[1:41:13] spoke something by inspiration and
[1:41:15] that's where we read here in Exodus 14
[1:41:17] 13 Moses said unto the people theory not
[1:41:21] standstill see the salvation of the Lord
[1:41:25] begin put it back on God which he will
[1:41:28] show you I'm not gonna do this God gonna
[1:41:30] do this which he will show to you today
[1:41:33] for the Egyptians whom you have seen
[1:41:36] today saying that what this is to me is
[1:41:38] that Moses was sick and tired of being
[1:41:41] sick and tired
[1:41:43] he knew that they a man had reached the
[1:41:47] point where the promise said that they
[1:41:50] were only being bondage for so long they
[1:41:53] had reached that state so now they're
[1:41:55] supposed to be delivered because God
[1:41:58] said so so if God promised deliverance
[1:42:02] then Egyptians can't take us back can I
[1:42:07] tell you that if God has promised you
[1:42:09] deliverance then those Egyptians cannot
[1:42:12] take you back into bondage if this is
[1:42:16] your season then this is your season and
[1:42:23] in your season your leave will not risk
[1:42:32] your leaf won't dry up in your seats
[1:42:38] praise God so he goes on to say the
[1:42:41] Egyptians whom you have seen today ye
[1:42:43] shall see them again no more forever all
[1:42:46] that spoke by inspiration Moses speaking
[1:42:49] this by inspiration and look at this he
[1:42:52] goes on to put it on God again the Lord
[1:42:55] shall fight for you and he should hold
[1:42:58] your peace and I'm gonna tell you
[1:42:59] something I like when God fight see if
[1:43:04] this was Moses fight he might have took
[1:43:06] a sward out and you know killed another
[1:43:08] through Egyptians
[1:43:09] like he did the one Egyptian I don't
[1:43:12] know what he did to kill one Egyptian he
[1:43:13] probably took a sweater
[1:43:15] he had already been trained the way amen
[1:43:17] Egypt he knew that a military strategist
[1:43:19] he knew how they fought he knew olives
[1:43:21] so Moses would have been prepared
[1:43:23] anybody killed maybe one or two or three
[1:43:24] Egyptians rester y'all run while we get
[1:43:27] this run
[1:43:29] damn I got one very hot God fight
[1:43:37] hallelujah and after Moses published
[1:43:42] this where we see him crying hallelujah
[1:43:44] he tell her hold your peace now he start
[1:43:46] crying like oh Lord I don't know what I
[1:43:48] just said
[1:43:49] hallelujah see our God is not like that
[1:43:52] every word that he speaks is calculated
[1:43:56] God does not mean the guy don't have to
[1:43:58] say nothing and take it back right so so
[1:44:02] so he want us to realize that we had
[1:44:03] that same type of authority in us
[1:44:05] therefore we need to watch what we say
[1:44:11] therefore we need to watch what we say
[1:44:14] praise God because there's power in your
[1:44:17] words how would I give life a power to
[1:44:21] take it away death and life lies in the
[1:44:26] power of the tongue
[1:44:28] look at this the Lord said unto Moses
[1:44:33] where for Christ's first 15 where for
[1:44:36] Christ I want to me speaking to the
[1:44:38] children of Israel that they go for it
[1:44:41] now this is where God has given him
[1:44:42] instruction before he didn't have no
[1:44:45] instruction before he spoke by
[1:44:47] inspiration but because God was in Moses
[1:44:50] because the thus saith the Lord was in
[1:44:52] Moses God had to back up what Moses said
[1:44:56] and so when Moses didn't know what to do
[1:44:59] and he was all frustrated and maybe
[1:45:01] flabbergasted with okay now which
[1:45:03] direction do I go now God now gives him
[1:45:05] and stretch they speak right we say
[1:45:08] don't cry to me wait for crossing me
[1:45:10] speak unto the children of Israel that
[1:45:12] they go forward
[1:45:13] don't even look back go forward don't
[1:45:16] look back go forward
[1:45:20] hallelujah don't look at your mistakes
[1:45:22] don't look at your pass go forward from
[1:45:26] this thing go forward that is
[1:45:34] inspiration jot it down like the Prophet
[1:45:38] here from this day go forward April 7 to
[1:45:44] 2019 go forward you see how God does
[1:45:49] things in the fourth month on the
[1:45:54] seventh day he speaks go forward what is
[1:46:00] full the number of deliverance
[1:46:02] what is seven completion and on the for
[1:46:05] the fourth month seventh day go forward
[1:46:10] see you right little things like that
[1:46:12] down because you'll come back and pick
[1:46:15] that up again hallelujah all right all
[1:46:19] right all right all right
[1:46:20] it meant somebody else should a yell
[1:46:23] like sister Rita that's for me that's
[1:46:26] for me she's taking it personal know how
[1:46:30] to speak to you look at this says in the
[1:46:35] Lord said to Moses wept for Christ down
[1:46:37] to me speaking to the children Israel
[1:46:39] that they go forward now he's giving
[1:46:41] them instruction but lift up lift up thy
[1:46:43] rod and stretch out thy hand over the
[1:46:45] sea and divide it and the children of
[1:46:47] Israel shall go on dry ground through
[1:46:49] the midst of the sea now God's giving
[1:46:52] them instruction now but before he had
[1:46:54] inspiration not instruction inspiration
[1:46:57] now you're waiting for instruct
[1:46:58] instruction but God wants you to move by
[1:47:01] inspiration can I say that again you're
[1:47:04] waiting for instruction but God wants
[1:47:07] you to move by inspiration
[1:47:11] [Music]
[1:47:13] I'm accident hard question what was
[1:47:16] what's really in your heart what's
[1:47:22] really in your heart she was in David's
[1:47:25] heart to Bill got a temple right that
[1:47:31] was what was in his heart and when he
[1:47:33] started moving by what was in his heart
[1:47:35] the inspiration of his heart actually
[1:47:37] the property even told him do all that
[1:47:40] it's in thine heart the Prophet told him
[1:47:43] that now now now now when the Prophet
[1:47:46] hadn't prayed and got the will of God so
[1:47:48] when God shows that no no no I don't
[1:47:50] want David to do that God stopped him so
[1:47:52] let me tell you this if you move by
[1:47:54] inspiration and this room God will stop
[1:48:00] now I had to say that to release you so
[1:48:04] you can start moving by inspiration
[1:48:07] you waited for instruction but God wants
[1:48:10] to give you inspiration can I can I can
[1:48:15] I put it this way when I talk about the
[1:48:17] children of Israel leaving each and we
[1:48:20] know what God did i'ma say it like this
[1:48:23] y'all forgive me if it don't come out
[1:48:25] right but God wanted to share his glory
[1:48:28] with Moses so he allowed Moses to speak
[1:48:32] something and place Moses words in the
[1:48:35] scripture
[1:48:39] so God willing to share some things with
[1:48:42] you right but he gotta put you in a
[1:48:44] situation where you can turn around and
[1:48:47] write the testimony I said but you
[1:48:56] wouldn't get that until he actually
[1:48:58] inspired to the same so why he giving
[1:49:02] you glory you given him glory what's
[1:49:17] your inspiration I believe you find it
[1:49:20] when you're going through your moments
[1:49:22] of trial that's when your inspiration
[1:49:24] actually comes out you might not even
[1:49:26] know it's there but it shows up when
[1:49:28] you're going through trial that I had
[1:49:33] one time on my job I was manager and I
[1:49:38] just got this employee man we I thought
[1:49:40] my team was doing really good and man we
[1:49:44] might be straight
[1:49:45] are we good and we go to a meeting thank
[1:49:48] you things like a little worship service
[1:49:50] that we went to and we come out to
[1:49:51] worship service and one of the guys who
[1:49:53] and as I said Jack I need to talk to you
[1:49:55] say okay all right no problem what's
[1:49:56] going on how can I help you it's a I got
[1:50:01] a new job and I'm believing in two weeks
[1:50:03] we've just got the team together so you
[1:50:06] leaving me in two weeks I said yeah I
[1:50:08] believe it in two weeks or something
[1:50:09] Hannah
[1:50:10] so I ran I'm alright I'm real sorry to
[1:50:12] hear that sorry to hear that so you know
[1:50:15] I say okay so I you know when I told my
[1:50:17] boss what was going on and said we you
[1:50:19] know we're gonna lose them and in two
[1:50:21] weeks and so on and so forth and and I
[1:50:23] said well I was a little just despondent
[1:50:26] about it look just you know upset about
[1:50:28] it I'm like man I don't know what I'm
[1:50:29] gonna do I just got all this together
[1:50:31] I'm not sure what I'm gonna do and so
[1:50:33] then he came back to me like maybe a day
[1:50:35] of so later late and he said Jack I know
[1:50:38] I told you two weeks but I'm have to
[1:50:39] leave at the end of this week so what I
[1:50:42] don't even have time to replace you I
[1:50:44] don't know what I'm gonna do I don't
[1:50:46] know you know what you know what
[1:50:47] how's this gonna happen I said man I say
[1:50:52] all right
[1:50:52] I'm like man you do that do it like that
[1:50:55] we have Church they don't do us like
[1:50:58] that's alright alright if you got to do
[1:51:00] what you got to do that's fine so he
[1:51:02] went on and I'm like Lord how am I gonna
[1:51:04] replace this guy Lord what am I gonna do
[1:51:07] and as I start praying about it God led
[1:51:10] me to a scripture and say I could have
[1:51:12] been alone I could have just walked
[1:51:14] around with this very static countenance
[1:51:17] and poor me hoping everybody felt sorry
[1:51:19] for me but God led me to scripture and I
[1:51:21] went back to the scripture we're set
[1:51:23] well Sammy was told by God say Saul I
[1:51:27] have rejected as King and they say now
[1:51:30] and and Samuel was a little discouraged
[1:51:33] like man I know that this guy the be
[1:51:35] king I've known that same year and and I
[1:51:38] know he left it I mean I know that song
[1:51:39] say but Lord Lord you know and God said
[1:51:41] no no no no don't even worry about
[1:51:42] praying for me I have I have rejected
[1:51:45] him and God was friendly saying I got
[1:51:47] another King God was already prepared
[1:51:51] can I put it that way God waiting on you
[1:51:55] to catch up
[1:51:57] God already done walk this thing got he
[1:52:00] waiting on you to catch up God was
[1:52:05] already prepared and and when I looked I
[1:52:07] looked at I might wait a minute
[1:52:09] you know he say you say I rejected sent
[1:52:14] me I got me another King now you know
[1:52:16] there's another thing I'm just taking my
[1:52:17] time here I don't even know where I'm I
[1:52:20] don't even know how long I've been here
[1:52:21] but I know that I'm this is the thing he
[1:52:24] say I already got another King go to
[1:52:26] Jesse's house now I had two acts of
[1:52:28] myself a question if God told them who
[1:52:30] has to go to why didn't God tell him
[1:52:35] which boy was gonna be
[1:52:40] he told him the house and the name of
[1:52:43] the house but he didn't tell him which
[1:52:45] boy because I think in the process but
[1:52:51] I'm not sure which boy God also shows
[1:52:53] something to send you don't judge people
[1:52:56] the way other people judge people say I
[1:53:00] look gonna miss heart I don't look the
[1:53:03] way other people look because in looking
[1:53:05] at the statue of this man but I'm
[1:53:08] looking at the character of a man he
[1:53:14] never even told him the boy he told him
[1:53:16] the house but not the boy because God
[1:53:18] wanted to show something more - and let
[1:53:20] me tell you something when you're going
[1:53:21] through something just because God want
[1:53:23] to show a little bit more to you he went
[1:53:30] on down there and and anointed David to
[1:53:34] become king and when when he got David
[1:53:38] as his King you know and I looked at
[1:53:39] that store I said okay Lord what you're
[1:53:41] telling me is that you already got the
[1:53:42] next person for me for this job you
[1:53:45] already know who they are and you just
[1:53:46] know where they are and and I had to
[1:53:48] change my attitude and once I changed my
[1:53:50] attitude and not caught things by
[1:53:52] Scripture
[1:53:53] I caught it by Scripture then I just
[1:53:55] begin to look different that and then it
[1:53:56] just kind of struck me so remember that
[1:53:58] one night and I thought it was a mistake
[1:54:01] I went to working and I was going to be
[1:54:04] trained for you know running the camera
[1:54:06] and stuff like that and and as I was
[1:54:08] being trained for running the camera I
[1:54:10] went at a particular time I remember
[1:54:12] getting the email and I went about 4
[1:54:14] o'clock for the train and they say Jack
[1:54:16] you didn't respond to the email in time
[1:54:18] so the trainer not happening till 7
[1:54:20] o'clock if you were to respondent when
[1:54:22] we needed you to respond you would have
[1:54:24] been able to do it at 4 o'clock but you
[1:54:26] didn't respond so you got to come back

[1:54:33] running or working on the cameras so I'm
[1:54:35] gonna just be late getting home tonight
[1:54:37] she's like okay and and and and when I
[1:54:39] was when I thought I was making a
[1:54:41] mistake God had already wall things up
[1:54:45] so here I didn't make it to the four
[1:54:47] o'clock because I didn't respond well
[1:54:48] about me going to the 7 o'clock training
[1:54:51] we all start introduced
[1:54:52] myself well I'm Jack and I work here

[1:55:09] in IT that's coming for training and
[1:55:11] everybody had different comings they're
[1:55:12] working for and I'm like man this is
[1:55:14] something amazing now God allowed that
[1:55:16] little situation to happen so understand
[1:55:18] my mind so when I lost this employee my
[1:55:23] mind went back to that situation
[1:55:25] remember all them guys that volunteered
[1:55:28] and they work in IT said I called it
[1:55:31] later that that arranged the meeting and
[1:55:33] I say you know you got any email

[1:55:44] blasts and one guy responded and the one
[1:55:47] guy responded is the one guy hired see
[1:55:52] God had already walked the thing out but
[1:55:55] I had to change my attitude and I had to
[1:55:58] get some inspiration from the scripture
[1:56:03] see my inspiration connect with his
[1:56:07] inspiration it's gonna produce a result
[1:56:10] and this is what the Prophet says when
[1:56:12] your inspiration if whatever you do
[1:56:15] don't let the devil take your
[1:56:17] inspiration Joe had inspiration when he
[1:56:27] was going through his inspiration was I
[1:56:29] know that my Redeemer liveth see though
[1:56:32] the skin worms destroy this body yet in
[1:56:35] my flesh I shall see God that was his
[1:56:39] inspiration I believe the Centurion a
[1:56:41] man had an inspiration when he met the
[1:56:44] Lord Jesus it says I'm a man under
[1:56:46] Authority and I tell this one to come
[1:56:49] and he comes and I tell that when they
[1:56:50] go and he goes he say if you would just
[1:56:52] speak the word only my servant be made
[1:56:55] whole that was his inspiration and and
[1:56:57] there was a result from his inspiration
[1:57:01] hallelujah amen
[1:57:03] I remain I know the woman a
[1:57:04] and that with the issue of blood she had
[1:57:08] an inspiration if I could just touch the
[1:57:11] hem of His garment then I know I'll be
[1:57:13] mijo when her inspiration connected with
[1:57:16] the Living Word it produced a result
[1:57:19] amen there was there was one woman the
[1:57:22] South Phoenician woman a man come big
[1:57:24] and you know just for her daughter say
[1:57:26] you know I know if you just kind of came
[1:57:28] and pray for my daughter he said look
[1:57:30] I'm not even sent to your people
[1:57:31] I'm not sent to your people he say he
[1:57:33] said she say now you write you write you
[1:57:35] say say say your people are dogs that's
[1:57:38] what he called your people with dogs and
[1:57:39] I'm not sent to them she said you know
[1:57:40] you're right
[1:57:41] you're right that's exactly right huh
[1:57:42] attitude was right and she say she say
[1:57:47] but even the dogs even dogs can lick a
[1:57:52] crumb from the masa stick I don't need a
[1:57:55] whole meal but a crumb from your table
[1:57:59] will satisfy you say great is your faith
[1:58:04] woman go go find in the way that you
[1:58:07] believed it her inspiration connected
[1:58:10] with the Living Word it produced a
[1:58:13] result
[1:58:15] David had inspiration and I want to
[1:58:18] leave you with this from that I I got
[1:58:19] more here but I ain't gonna hang go and
[1:58:21] go through all this today but David had
[1:58:23] inspiration David walked out there he
[1:58:27] wasn't even supposed to be there but
[1:58:29] then the Philistines had them under
[1:58:31] duress and David walks out that bring
[1:58:34] his brother some some lunch or something
[1:58:36] like that from the house and just kind
[1:58:38] of see about their their their
[1:58:39] well-being and they say and he see
[1:58:40] Goliath come walking out and make this
[1:58:42] both Goliath I mean David said now who
[1:58:44] is this uncircumcised Philistine he's
[1:58:46] they talk different than everybody else

[1:59:21] greater is He that is in me than he
[1:59:24] that's in the world
[1:59:26] so in all I could say is that I've gotta
[1:59:28] face bigger bigger problems in this imma
[1:59:32] face bigger Giants than this and this
[1:59:34] ain't nothing and I don't think God do
[1:59:37] it befo gotta do it he was moving by
[1:59:43] inspiration and because of the way he
[1:59:46] talked it began to you know get around
[1:59:49] in the camp it everybody be like well
[1:59:51] who was just a little fella that's
[1:59:52] talking he was a young man right 17 18

[2:00:04] then they say what bring him in here let
[2:00:06] me talk to me say he say he would see
[2:00:08] Pro saw sitting now I don't know who
[2:00:10] this uncircumcised feel selling us but
[2:00:11] I'd be glad to find ya so looked at son
[2:00:18] we appreciate your enthusiasm we really
[2:00:24] appreciate your enthusiasm but we tie by
[2:00:27] the nation of Israel is resting on your
[2:00:30] shoulders people I mean it means the
[2:00:34] lives are resting on your shoulders and
[2:00:36] I got I'm sorry I got no confidence in
[2:00:39] this other folk might not have
[2:00:42] confidence in your inspiration
[2:00:45] but when God's revealed it to you you
[2:00:47] got to stand on it they're not moving by
[2:00:51] what you see only you can move by what
[2:00:54] you see so he stood her sake he gave him
[2:01:01] a testimony he's saying if you don't
[2:01:02] mind let me testify all right it says
[2:01:05] you know I was out watching my daddy she
[2:01:07] and and saw a bear came in and got one
[2:01:13] of the sheep and I went and took that
[2:01:14] bear right from out of that bear that
[2:01:18] bears grass so you did that say yes I
[2:01:21] sure did oh he said man that's pretty
[2:01:23] good cuz bears could stem eight feet
[2:01:25] tall themselves brother branham shot at
[2:01:27] 8-foot grizzly right so you say say say
[2:01:31] so that's pretty good you did they say
[2:01:33] yeah yeah I certainly did sir he's
[2:01:34] saying and also while I'm there fighting
[2:01:38] off the bear and I got him out of there
[2:01:40] hello lion come up ain't gonna take one
[2:01:43] of my daddy's sheep now you know you
[2:01:45] know it's a shame for a shepherd to lose
[2:01:47] sheep you know that right you say so
[2:01:50] so sir I had to finish up this bear and
[2:01:56] then I went after the line you did what
[2:01:59] I went after the line grab him by his
[2:02:02] beard took my sheep back nurse the sheep
[2:02:05] back to health
[2:02:06] huh and and restored that sheep he said
[2:02:09] he said but neither the lion nor the
[2:02:11] bear got my daddy she know I know nobody
[2:02:17] was out there to see me but I'm telling
[2:02:19] what happened and that's why I'm not
[2:02:21] afraid of this guy and say he said he
[2:02:23] said he is defying the armies of the
[2:02:26] Living God it's not even my batteries
[2:02:28] God's back and all God need is somebody
[2:02:32] to do what show up say okay I got your
[2:02:41] testimony has impressed me but I'm just
[2:02:45] still a little unsure because you ain't
[2:02:49] got no army going out here get this this
[2:02:50] giant it gave him some armies and and I
[2:02:53] just always ask the question if if Saul
[2:02:56] didn't believe
[2:02:57] in his own armor protecting him to go
[2:03:02] fast like Goliath why he gonna give it
[2:03:05] to David David said no no no I don't
[2:03:09] need this he said when I when I fought
[2:03:11] the lion and the bear I didn't have all
[2:03:13] this all I had was five smooth stones in
[2:03:16] this slingshot and if God rescued me

[2:03:59] victories should inspire future success
[2:04:07] and I can just tell you this right now
[2:04:10] I've seen God make a way for some y'all
[2:04:12] some of y'all I don't seen him do it I
[2:04:15] don't watch them providing ways that go
[2:04:18] beyond your expectations I seen him do
[2:04:21] it before I know he'll do it again
[2:04:23] hey man I've seen when you got your
[2:04:25] first house and I saw how God did it
[2:04:30] they might so got with my own eyes I saw
[2:04:35] God when you got your first house I saw
[2:04:38] God provide when you got your first
[2:04:41] apartment I saw God provide when you got
[2:04:44] your first car I saw God provide I saw
[2:04:49] some of y'all children born and how you

[2:05:06] success if you did it before you'll do
[2:05:16] it again lion went down bear went down
[2:05:25] and why did Goliath have to go down
[2:05:27] because God has perfected gospel fected
[2:05:39] in threes oh my I can't get him tall
[2:05:47] that I'll just have to let it go
[2:05:49] I just God wants you to know that
[2:05:52] there's inspiration Moses moved out by
[2:05:54] inspiration and when he said the
[2:05:57] Drifters that you've seen today you'll
[2:05:59] see them no more forever through that
[2:06:01] inspiration we noticed the end of the
[2:06:04] story that Pharaoh's army came after he
[2:06:06] stretched his this rod across the scene
[2:06:09] and it divided hither and thither hey
[2:06:15] man brother quick coup it divided and
[2:06:17] they walked across some dry land here
[2:06:20] come Pharaoh Veronica's God don't fight
[2:06:22] like we fight he not just taking once
[2:06:23] warden you know y'all know that right
[2:06:25] you know when when even when Joshua said
[2:06:29] son stand still that was his inspiration
[2:06:30] God didn't tell Joshua to say that that
[2:06:32] was Joshua's inspiration and God honored
[2:06:35] his inspiration and when he said that
[2:06:38] not only not only not before he said it
[2:06:41] God was fighting the battle
[2:06:42] they were just they were slaying this
[2:06:44] and doing and they they today's killing
[2:06:45] as many people as they could but when
[2:06:48] God start fighting you know how God felt
[2:06:51] hailstones
[2:06:53] okay I want y'all to see God can you see
[2:06:57] yourself fighting the enemy and you just
[2:06:59] did with your sword and a house don't
[2:07:02] come hit him and miss you Utah by
[2:07:09] calculated Utah by precise Utah by
[2:07:13] perfect here the thing hit show you like
[2:07:17] and you turn around together in a hail
[2:07:20] stone and the Bible say mo were killed
[2:07:22] with hailstones then with a sword so
[2:07:26] when God fight it's over Moses Moses I
[2:07:36] don't know how we gonna lose God said
[2:07:38] and I just take it Rob stretch it out
[2:07:39] and y'all walk cross go forward just
[2:07:41] keep going forward
[2:07:42] man they start walking forward and and
[2:07:45] and and here God was holding up the
[2:07:48] Egyptians put that pillar there that
[2:07:50] pillar pillar cloud and all that there
[2:07:52] to kind of hold them up but then he just
[2:07:53] lifted it just and when he lifted they
[2:07:56] thought they thought Oh for God oh he
[2:07:57] done made a way for me to went running
[2:08:02] across a million God wait to they got
[2:08:08] what it was on the show come on in here
[2:08:13] you know
[2:08:14] Pharaoh Pharaoh I got this they thought
[2:08:17] they got away
[2:08:18] come on boys everybody running after
[2:08:20] them and God waiting they got real good
[2:08:22] inside
[2:08:24] then we did something for and by closing
[2:08:31] it up by closing it up he actually
[2:08:38] fulfill Moses inspiration the Egyptians
[2:08:48] you have seen today you'll see them no
[2:08:51] more forever Moses didn't think that
[2:08:55] Moses didn't even know how was gonna
[2:08:57] happen
[2:08:58] he said God don't show you how it's
[2:08:59] gonna happen hallelujah and I can I say
[2:09:03] it like like Moses said in Exodus and
[2:09:05] the Lord did take inspiration don't let
[2:09:19] them take inspiration you're gonna need
[2:09:20] that to defeat some demos and if he's
[2:09:22] done it before he'll do it again and let
[2:09:25] you pass your prior successes inspire
[2:09:28] future success amen let's pray musicians
[2:09:33] if you would make your way forward
[2:09:35] father we are so grateful for the word
[2:09:41] your prophet just tell us Lord these
[2:09:44] little things of how we have to allow
[2:09:47] our inspiration to connect with the
[2:09:51] inspiration that is in the word Lord
[2:09:55] then we'll see results you know the
[2:09:58] things that we're faced and you know the
[2:09:59] things that we're up against the rock
[2:10:01] and a hard place that may be before us
[2:10:04] the father will speak by faith knowing
[2:10:08] that if we say to the mountain be thou
[2:10:10] removed our cast into the sea don't down
[2:10:12] their hearts then we can have what we
[2:10:13] see Lord our prayer our desire it's
[2:10:19] supposed to be in to walk Lord in these
[2:10:21] places that you have called us to nor
[2:10:24] know God that the the enemy desires to
[2:10:28] keep us from these things that's his
[2:10:31] desire the Lord I pray that we will all
[2:10:34] just begin to take a walk down memory
[2:10:37] just begin to think on the things that
[2:10:40] you've already done you have proven
[2:10:42] yourself over and over and over again
[2:10:46] one thing you cannot do is fail song was
[2:10:54] sang a little earlier through it all
[2:10:57] we've learned to trust in Jesus alone
[2:11:01] would learn to take you at your word and
[2:11:04] father we are encouraged we encouraged
[2:11:07] God that you hold is still carry us
[2:11:10] through and Lord I don't know I don't

[2:11:14] people may be facing and I know the
[2:11:17] Egyptians that they dealt with before
[2:11:19] they came here
[2:11:20] sometimes it represents a spirit Lord
[2:11:23] that we don't know what what folk were
[2:11:26] facing but we can say that the Egyptians
[2:11:30] they saw today they'll see no more
[2:11:32] forever we speak it by faith by
[2:11:37] inspiration and believe o God that you
[2:11:40] will bring your word to pass some Jesus
[2:11:47] name that we pray amen amen amen
