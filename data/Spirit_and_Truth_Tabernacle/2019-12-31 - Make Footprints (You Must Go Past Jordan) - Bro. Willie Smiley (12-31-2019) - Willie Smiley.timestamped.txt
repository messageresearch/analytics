[0:32] praise the Lord God is good god is good
[0:36] god is good man
[0:40] 2nd chronicles chapter 20 amen
[0:47] verse 3 it says in Jos have I feared and
[0:50] said himself to seek the Lord and
[0:51] proclaim to fast throughout all Judah
[0:54] and Judah gathered themselves together
[0:57] to ask help of the Lord even out of all
[1:00] the cities of Judah that came to seek
[1:03] the Lord and Jehoshaphat stood in the
[1:06] congregation of Judah and Jerusalem in
[1:08] the house of Lord before the new court
[1:11] said O Lord God of our fathers are not
[1:14] thou God in heaven and rule is not thou
[1:17] over all the kingdoms of the heathen and
[1:20] in thine hand is there not power and
[1:23] might so that none is able to withstand
[1:25] thee so it's art not thou our God who
[1:29] ditched drive out the inhabitants of
[1:31] this land before thy people Israel and
[1:33] gave us it to the seed of Abraham thy
[1:35] friend forever and they dwelt therein
[1:38] and have built the essentially therein
[1:41] for that name saying if when evil cometh
[1:45] upon us as a sword judgment or
[1:47] pestilence or famine we stand before
[1:49] this house
[1:50] and in thy presence for thy name is in
[1:53] this house and cry unto thee and our
[1:56] affliction then thou wilt hear and help
[1:59] and now behold the children of Arman and
[2:02] Moab and Mount Sierra whom thou wouldest
[2:05] not let Israel in vain when they came
[2:08] out of the land of Egypt but they turned
[2:10] from them and destroyed them not he's
[2:12] just reminding god of his promises says
[2:15] behold I say how they reward us to come
[2:19] to cast us out of our possession which
[2:21] thou has given us to inheritance o our
[2:24] God would thou not judge them for we
[2:26] have no might against this great company
[2:28] that cometh against us neither know we
[2:31] what to do but eyes are upon thee and
[2:35] all Judah stood before the Lord with
[2:37] their little ones their wives and their
[2:39] children then upon jahaziel the son of
[2:42] Zechariah the son of an ayah the son as
[2:44] I yield the son of man an ayah a Levite
[2:47] of the sons of a staff came the Spirit
[2:49] of the Lord in the midst of the
[2:50] congregation and he said hearken ye o
[2:53] Judah and he inhabitants of Jerusalem
[2:56] and thou King Jehoshaphat thus saith the
[3:00] Lord unto you a man be not afraid nor
[3:05] dismayed by reason of this great
[3:08] multitude for the battle is not yours
[3:12] but God's a man he says tomorrow go ye
[3:16] down against him
[3:18] oh they come up by the clip of zzzz and
[3:21] ye shall find them at the end of the
[3:23] brook before the wilderness of Jimmy
[3:25] well you shall not need to fight in this
[3:28] battle set your sails stand ye steel and
[3:32] see the salvation of the Lord with you o
[3:34] Troodon Jerusalem fear not nor be
[3:37] dismayed tomorrow go out against him for
[3:39] the Lord will be with you it goes on the
[3:43] Santa house affair bowed his head with
[3:45] his face to the ground and all Judah and
[3:49] the habitants of Jerusalem fell before
[3:51] the Lord
[3:51] worshiping the Lord and the Levites of
[3:54] the children of color of the core
[3:56] Heights stood up to praise the Lord God
[3:59] of Israel with a loud voice on high and
[4:02] this is 2nd chronicles 20/20 says and
[4:06] they rose early in the morning and went
[4:09] forth into the wilderness of the court
[4:11] as they went forth Jehoshaphat stood and
[4:14] said hear me o Judah and he inhabitants
[4:17] of Jerusalem believe in the Lord your
[4:20] God so young so shall you be established
[4:22] believe his prophets so shall he prosper
[4:28] and when he had consulted with the
[4:30] people he appointed fingers unto the
[4:33] Lord and that should praise the beauty
[4:35] of his holiness as they went out before
[4:38] the army and to say praise the Lord for
[4:41] His mercy endureth forever and when they
[4:45] began to sing and to praise the Lord
[4:47] Amen singing to praise the Lord set
[4:50] ambush myths against the children of our
[4:53] mom Moab and Mount Seir which were come
[4:56] against Judah and they were smitten for
[4:59] the children of Ammon and Moab stood up
[5:01] against the inhabitants of Mount Seir
[5:03] utterly to slay and destroy them and
[5:06] when they had made an in what help to
[5:08] destroy another and when Judah came
[5:11] toward the rocks towers in the
[5:12] wilderness they looked into the
[5:14] multitudes and behold there were dead
[5:16] bodies falling to the earth and none
[5:18] escaped and I love this and when Joseph
[5:21] and his people came to take away the
[5:24] spoil of them they found among them in
[5:26] abundance both riches when the dead
[5:29] bodies and precious Jews a man with the
[5:33] dead bodies and precious jewels which
[5:35] they stripped off of themselves more
[5:37] than they could carry away and they were
[5:39] three days and gathering of the spoil it
[5:43] was so much it's something when God
[5:45] fights the battle

[44:14] arise and go over this Jordan thou and
[44:17] all this people until the land which I
[44:21] do give unto give to them even to the
[44:26] land to the children of Israel every
[44:29] place that the soles of your foot shall
[44:32] tread upon that have I given unto you as
[44:36] I said unto Moses from the wilderness
[44:39] and this Lebanon even unto the great
[44:42] river the river Euphrates all the land
[44:46] of the Hittites and unto the Great Sea
[44:49] towards the going down of the Sun shall
[44:52] be your coach there should not be any
[44:54] man be able to stand before the all the
[44:58] days of thy life as I was with Moses so
[45:02] I will be with thee I will not fail thee
[45:06] nor forsake in thee be strong and of a
[45:09] good courage for unto this people shall
[45:13] of our divided inheritance the land
[45:15] which I swore until their fathers to
[45:18] give them only be how strong
[45:21] and courageous that thou may observe to
[45:23] do according to all the law which Moses
[45:26] my servant commanded thee turned out

[45:32] left that thou mayest prosper with so
[45:35] ever thou goeth
[45:37] this book of the law shall not depart

[45:42] meditate therein day and night that thou
[45:45] may us observe to do according to all
[45:47] that is written therein for then thou
[45:50] shalt make that way prosperous and then
[45:53] thou shalt have good success have not a
[45:57] commander to be strong and of a good
[45:59] courage be not afraid neither be thou
[46:03] dismayed for the Lord thy God is with
[46:06] thee wheresoever thou shalt go I thought
[46:20] I'd keep that jacket on but I'm starting
[46:22] to sweat I want to use I want to use as
[46:25] a little subject it's something that we
[46:27] priests on on Sunday morning and we
[46:29] trust that up we could be a blessing to
[46:32] you all tonight Saints that that hurt
[46:37] hurt me Sunday y'all just pray for me
[46:39] y'all might know where I'm going to you
[46:41] might not know you just never know where
[46:45] you're gonna go once you get anointed I
[46:46] want to use as as a a topic make
[46:50] footprints and just as a subtopic you
[46:57] must go past Jordan but B I want to
[47:01] maybe just for a few moments just lay a
[47:03] little foundation and trust that the
[47:07] Holy Spirit and just lead us tonight and
[47:11] help us by His grace I was telling the
[47:15] same song I was telling the Saints on
[47:18] Sunday morning I said you know I'm
[47:21] starting to you know watch people and
[47:24] look
[47:25] things and and it's it's becoming
[47:28] troubling because what you start finding
[47:31] here is a lot of times I was reading a
[47:33] young fella I kind of known him for a
[47:36] long time and you know and reading some
[47:40] up some posts I was like it just is just
[47:43] seeming like people are getting to a
[47:45] place where they don't even believe the
[47:47] Bible anymore we're trying to mix
[47:53] scripture with you know our own
[47:57] understanding which despite what sense
[47:59] for us not to lean to our own
[48:01] understanding that right is you know God
[48:07] is his own interpreter then right we we
[48:10] know the Prophet he preached the message
[48:11] God being his own enterprise yeah
[48:14] interpreter he interpret his word by
[48:17] bringing his word to pass you know when
[48:22] he spoke in Genesis he said let there be
[48:24] let there be the manifestation was the
[48:28] interpretation God interpreted his own
[48:30] word by bringing his word to pass right
[48:37] you know whatever God says he's gonna do
[48:41] that's what he's gonna do
[48:43] I don't be a little slow for a minute
[48:45] but I will pick up some steam out them
[48:47] in a while and but what we find it is is
[48:51] is you know the intellectual mind is
[48:55] trying to change God's thinking right if
[49:00] God if God says it's going to be a
[49:02] rapture there's gonna be a rapture
[49:04] if God says this there's gonna be
[49:08] judgment upon the earth that's gonna be
[49:10] judgment upon the earth
[49:12] right we could we could look back in
[49:15] Scripture and see where once the people
[49:21] got themselves to two of us a spot where
[49:25] they they no longer wanted to heed to
[49:27] the things of God and got promiscuous
[49:30] and all of that God gave them my
[49:33] opportunity and then when when he was
[49:36] turned down and rich was rejected what
[49:39] we find is is that God Amen judgment
[49:42] like in the days of Noah right he said
[49:45] he sent judgment upon the earth right so
[49:49] you know one of the things in the hour I
[49:52] feel even even I'm thinking about a
[49:54] statement that the Prophet made in his
[49:57] ministry he said the angel told him or
[50:01] God or having my being I don't have a
[50:03] quote I'm just kind of you know top of
[50:06] my head he says if you could get the
[50:08] people to believe and you know he you
[50:13] know the rest a sane understand before
[50:15] you things of that nature
[50:17] but you gotta be able in ministry to get
[50:21] the people to believe believe the word
[50:26] right right I mean getting the people to
[50:30] believe the word right amen
[50:35] that's key you say well that's simple
[50:38] it's not simple it's just not as simple
[50:40] as that because you could look at the
[50:44] history of Scripture and see where
[50:45] people don't believe the word right
[50:48] right and sometimes sometimes even you
[50:53] know you know the word being in its
[50:56] simplest form you still find people not
[51:01] believing right I will say this I think
[51:04] God for predestination tonight I think
[51:08] God for the foreknowledge of God I thank
[51:11] God for being in the mind of God before
[51:13] the foundation of the world
[51:15] amen all of us ought to say amen to that
[51:18] tonight because of you if you was not a
[51:21] part of God amen
[51:23] back then and it's mine right you'll
[51:27] never be a part of that right and that's
[51:33] no injustice because God places every
[51:36] individual on free moral agency right
[51:40] and give every man choice right every
[51:45] man is given a choice whether you will
[51:47] or whether you won't that's up to you I
[51:52] made my choice I made my choice to
[51:56] follow Jesus
[51:57] you know they say I'm going all the way
[52:00] just to see him alright the one who
[52:04] suffered and died from me I'm starting
[52:07] to feel real good tonight
[52:09] Amen I hope y'all came to have chest so
[52:15] to me that's that's him that's very very
[52:18] very very important it's getting people
[52:21] to believe that the Word of God not new
[52:26] just the words of a man but the Word of
[52:29] God we know man is is God's ancient yeah
[52:35] right like like Moses Moses was God's
[52:40] ancient yeah
[52:41] Moses was God's mouthpiece to the people
[52:45] yeah is that right ain't been you know
[52:48] one time on Mount Sinai God spoke to the
[52:53] people they said oh no no no no no no we
[52:57] we don't want him to speak to us like
[53:00] that that was just too much for Humanity
[53:06] God thundering amen on the mountain and
[53:09] everything you know that's just too much
[53:12] that's okay okay you know I'll give you
[53:17] a veneer I'll make another Avenue I'll
[53:22] anoint a man and and he'll he'll be my
[53:27] voice
[53:29] right Moses Moses was was the the the
[53:34] the voice of God to the people is that
[53:37] right so y'all got wait me that's far
[53:42] I'm turning I'm trying to get us to see
[53:45] something tonight this it's important
[53:48] for us all right if we're never gonna be
[53:51] victorious if we're ever gonna overcome
[53:54] it's important for us to believe the
[53:57] world emotions is fine as much as I
[54:02] enjoy shopping as much as I enjoy
[54:06] running around the church right I
[54:12] realize you know were selling the same I
[54:15] remember when when the children of
[54:18] Israel pharaoh and finally let the
[54:21] children of Israel go and and you know
[54:25] they got to the Red Sea Moses had
[54:27] already prophesied that you know the the
[54:31] enemy that they saw they won't see no
[54:34] more things of that nature
[54:36] and they got to the Red Sea they
[54:38] panicked they panic and realize that the
[54:48] enemy the enemy was they didn't realize
[54:51] a man it was a satyr
[54:55] they didn't realize Amen that God was
[54:59] fulfilling his word right those wasn't
[55:04] just the words of a man those was the
[55:06] words of God the prophecy on the lips of
[55:10] a man the enemy you see you won't see
[55:14] him no more after this this it'll be all
[55:16] over
[55:19] you would have thought they'd believe
[55:21] seeing all of the supernatural that had
[55:24] taken place amen
[55:27] in the beginning the frogs and the fries
[55:30] and all of their all of those different
[55:33] types of things the Death Angel moving
[55:35] in the land and and and and you know
[55:38] Moses telling the pilot token and just
[55:41] all of those different things you would
[55:43] have thought that they would have
[55:44] believed then I have enough confidence
[55:46] not necessarily in the man but in in the
[55:50] voice the words that was spoken through
[55:54] the lips of the man right they come out
[55:58] and they realized man they came out they
[56:01] was probably happy that was exciting
[56:03] right you know going along and they got
[56:07] to the Red Sea all right not really
[56:11] knowing God's plan Moses was following
[56:15] the leadership of God lead leading the
[56:19] people right and and they could look
[56:22] back and see the enemy coming behind
[56:25] them right didn't know God's plan fear
[56:31] feels a killer to the church
[56:34] right amen
[56:37] but you know what God showed himself
[56:39] mighty in the Mint's drownded the enemy
[56:43] y'all with me tonight drowning the enemy
[56:47] according to promise right see what they
[56:53] feel my understand from the beginning
[56:55] because of a prophecy God had given in
[56:58] Abraham there were people of promise
[57:03] marrying them marrying and the sisters
[57:06] limb that grabbed the tambourines you
[57:08] know sometimes we come here the sisters
[57:10] get all excited they be grabbing
[57:12] tambourines and running all around the
[57:14] church and everybody be shouting and
[57:16] things of that nature
[57:18] all right right then the very next trial
[57:26] God already showed them he was on the
[57:30] scene to prove his word the prophet
[57:36] priest message Amen proving his word
[57:38] right God the whole scene was God
[57:43] proving his word right he's all Abraham
[57:47] your people are sojourn in a strange
[57:49] land you know for a specific amount of
[57:54] time he said but i'ma bring them out by
[57:56] mighty hand
[57:57] right a man did didn't he was God did it
[58:03] with Moses his mother I mean you can see
[58:07] the plan of God unfolding itself right
[58:12] in my head you can see the plan of God
[58:15] unfolded itself even when when when
[58:18] Moses was a runaway prophet God was
[58:21] still in the midst see one thing about
[58:25] it God's Word cannot and will not a man
[58:29] come to know whatever God said Amen he's
[58:35] able to perform it it can't fail
[58:40] I'd rather be standing on the Word of
[58:43] God tonight cuz we know this is gonna
[58:51] pass away but the Word of God it will
[58:55] not fail
[58:57] is that right glory to God you could you
[59:01] could see the vindication of God's word
[59:04] God interpreting his word right
[59:07] God proving his word amen
[59:11] God sending Moses on the scene amen was
[59:16] was God proving his work Amen God keeps
[59:21] his word we different we as human beings
[59:25] we don't always keep our word all right
[59:29] right please come up I'm not hitter you
[59:32] know I'm a pretty some victory tonight
[59:36] but it is what live with our best in
[59:39] Texas a lot of times we we just can't
[59:42] keep our word right hey man but that
[59:46] ain't go God God God keeps his word
[59:50] right God definitely keeps his word and
[59:55] then but what we find is right like we
[59:59] say you you would think that people
[1:00:00] would just automatically believe the
[1:00:04] Word of God with all of the supernatural
[1:00:09] and you can see it through the history
[1:00:12] through the ministry of the Prophet
[1:00:14] things of that nature right people don't
[1:00:17] just always just believe the Word of God
[1:00:19] we cry we shout we do all of these
[1:00:23] different things but then the moment
[1:00:26] pressure comes
[1:00:28] the moment situations come we lose sight
[1:00:33] on the word of God is that right right
[1:00:37] glory to God the children of Israel they
[1:00:40] saw God in their myths right got right
[1:00:45] out there and and and you know they
[1:00:48] needed a little water they started
[1:00:50] complaining they had the smitten rock
[1:00:54] that Cassady just minutes
[1:00:58] Moses's ministry was it was a ministry
[1:01:03] if you just study Moses as minister
[1:01:06] right and it wasn't it wasn't Moses but
[1:01:09] it just showed you where a people of
[1:01:13] promise of people that should have
[1:01:15] believed to Amen the Word of God did
[1:01:17] believe the Word of God is that right
[1:01:21] right because every time they was faced
[1:01:23] with a challenge they rebelled they
[1:01:27] complained a journey that shouldn't have
[1:01:32] took him about a short period of time
[1:01:35] end up taking them years
[1:01:40] why it was because of the the unbelief
[1:01:46] right it was it because of God cuz God
[1:01:52] keeps his word
[1:01:54] because one cannot fail if God's got a
[1:02:00] raise up a whole nother charge we go in
[1:02:02] some with us do that that's gonna keep
[1:02:09] his word if God say somebody's going
[1:02:13] over into Canaan
[1:02:14] somebody's going over the Cana
[1:02:18] right but if you look at if you look at
[1:02:22] I'm gonna kind of go back and forth and
[1:02:25] maybe I'll pick up 2019 and tie it all
[1:02:29] in here and we were gonna run out of
[1:02:31] here tonight Jesus but y'all just stay
[1:02:33] with me if you if you if you look at if
[1:02:37] you look at Moses as Minister I was I
[1:02:39] was just kind of I was kind of just
[1:02:43] thinking about some things and thinking
[1:02:46] about Moses is ministry I was like man
[1:02:50] Moses his ministry was just so filled
[1:02:54] with rebellion right right all right
[1:02:59] the rebellious people right a ministry
[1:03:03] that you know no no real order trying to
[1:03:07] get the people lined up in an order and
[1:03:10] this one raises up oh you ain't the only
[1:03:12] holy man who made you some Authority got
[1:03:22] some Wang Ali out there so I'll stop I'm
[1:03:27] going somewhere right but if you look at
[1:03:30] his ministry right and you would think
[1:03:34] with all that the people were seeing
[1:03:36] they would have had a trust they would
[1:03:39] have had a confidence in Moses and just
[1:03:44] followed Moses his ministry seeing the
[1:03:47] power of God seeing it the cloud by day
[1:03:50] and you know fire by night and all of
[1:03:53] that but man that minute streamed it
[1:03:56] with them o fighters and and and just
[1:04:00] all of that man it was terrible it was
[1:04:07] terrible for a group of people right it
[1:04:10] was so bad
[1:04:11] Moses was so so Zechs right with with
[1:04:16] the people that they caused Moses to see
[1:04:29] but you but you just got to thank God
[1:04:32] for the sovereignty of God
[1:04:34] I mean Moses were lost in that but its
[1:04:37] gesture just to show you you know what
[1:04:42] was happening right in in a ministry and
[1:04:48] you see this a lot of times in
[1:04:51] ministries it's got to accomplish right
[1:05:29] it's got to accomplish the thing that is
[1:05:32] set out to accomplish right in the midst
[1:05:37] of all of that God was you know God was
[1:05:40] raising up a church that I believe right
[1:05:46] supernaturally right right Amen when you
[1:05:51] find that people will not believe
[1:05:53] gamma-rays a folk that will be leaving
[1:05:57] that's description you're right
[1:06:01] no matter how much I believe it is dad's
[1:06:05] gonna be some people that's gonna
[1:06:06] believe the Word of God right right
[1:06:11] amen there's gonna be some people that
[1:06:12] believe the Word of God
[1:06:14] see amen
[1:06:17] see God God's gonna prove his word man
[1:06:20] God's Word cannot fall to the ground
[1:06:23] right Moses that calls Moses Moses to to
[1:06:30] to sit Moses God in the flesh but it
[1:06:36] shows us something a man in ministry
[1:06:40] also right it's important for us to
[1:06:45] allow God to be in control of this was
[1:06:48] also right cuz cuz most got soul that
[1:06:54] see good man you bunch of devils
[1:07:02] shut up you know you know he start
[1:07:05] getting the flesh that I realized and
[1:07:07] what about him it was God it was it was
[1:07:10] God being the provider sometimes we get
[1:07:13] lifted up we think it's because we're
[1:07:15] smart because we're educated because
[1:07:18] we've gone to school in education it
[1:07:22] Amen not have a job educated people will
[1:07:28] skid row your finest a lot of focus
[1:07:35] educated with no jobs and no money come
[1:07:41] on Moses got beside himself
[1:07:45] Hey you bunch of Devils it's like God
[1:07:48] like whoa whoa whoa Moses but you know
[1:07:52] what that that's the humanistic part of
[1:07:55] a man right but but it shows us
[1:08:00] something because you know we human
[1:08:03] beings as shepherds come on y'all breeze
[1:08:06] with me yeah I mean we're human beings
[1:08:10] Shepherd's but we gotta realize a man
[1:08:13] there's a colony and it's so important
[1:08:17] for us not to get in the flesh no matter
[1:08:20] what right because you get offended you
[1:08:25] get hurt right you feel step down that's
[1:08:29] that's the human part but it's still
[1:08:33] amen
[1:08:34] you know it's important for us to have
[1:08:36] the right kind of character to try to do
[1:08:39] the best that we can
[1:08:40] I'll keep going y'all like y'all keep
[1:08:43] praying for me I'm trying to get out of
[1:08:45] here right sometimes you find Shepherds
[1:08:51] they they get to a place and then they
[1:08:54] get the fighting and fussing and you
[1:08:58] start losing the objective when you
[1:09:00] start doing that right
[1:09:03] it's our job in spite of of everything
[1:09:08] to try to lead the people amen
[1:09:10] to a rapture is that right it was Moses
[1:09:15] job to cuz we find the difference in to
[1:09:18] two parts coming out of and going into
[1:09:20] their right amen and see you know as
[1:09:25] long as as long as they were just kind
[1:09:28] of going round and round and round and
[1:09:36] round
[1:09:37] y'all got to quiet about that wasn't
[1:09:43] that was it the promise being fulfilled
[1:09:46] being in the desert right disorder
[1:09:53] rebellion that wasn't the promise but
[1:09:58] God is smart
[1:10:00] God is smart - now see God God wasn't
[1:10:07] going to allow all of that to go into
[1:10:09] Canaan
[1:10:11] y'all don't oppress with me now
[1:10:16] Chloe God allowed him to walk and walk
[1:10:20] and I'm old fighters that with all of
[1:10:23] that unbelief when a lot of that stuff
[1:10:26] dad off right then God took Moses right
[1:10:31] amen
[1:10:32] God took Moses and he says okay watch
[1:10:35] this shift right watch watch the change
[1:10:40] that was getting ready to take place
[1:10:43] right amen after Moses Moses goes off
[1:10:48] the scene now now God start to deal with
[1:10:51] Joshua right right cuz let's keep
[1:10:55] something in mind God keeps his word
[1:10:58] right see you know we meet we coming out
[1:11:04] of old another year and listen you know
[1:11:11] 2019 was was a difficult year I don't
[1:11:14] know what it was for y'all but it was a
[1:11:15] difficult year for me right it's
[1:11:19] sometimes it felt like kind of time to
[1:11:23] make the donuts at times time like you
[1:11:28] know y'all Floridians y'all know what
[1:11:30] it's like to get stuck in sugar saying
[1:11:34] you get stuck in this fed and no matter

[1:12:24] you get out to you walk around it
[1:12:27] you wanna keep the Holy Ghost at your
[1:12:39] head your vet stuff right but then you
[1:12:48] know what God always makes the way God
[1:12:54] God you know one thing I realized God
[1:12:56] keeps his word and proves his word in
[1:12:58] the most simplest ways in the simplest
[1:13:03] things sometimes this is something
[1:13:06] simpler other day a wife was going
[1:13:09] somewhere in a taxi lady came to pick up
[1:13:12] and later the back that we got a little
[1:13:25] walled in my driveway pyrite is here

[1:32:52] and challenges and all of that you just
[1:32:55] got to say man let bygones be bygones
[1:32:59] I'm looking to cross over it just some
[1:33:02] new experiences right I might have some
[1:33:06] new battles but I already know that a
[1:33:08] man he's promised there never leave me
[1:33:12] not forsaken me see I'm connected to a
[1:33:15] promise
[1:33:20] amen

[1:33:25] all Israel together sit stand here and
[1:33:29] watch the glory of God watch see - we be
[1:33:39] too busy depending on man look into man
[1:33:43] and that's that's why we don't go
[1:33:45] nowhere

[2:00:06] knows why he has certain things to be
[2:00:08] said and which testimonies he wants
[2:00:12] shared at what time and and everything
[2:00:15] and you know the Lord blessed us in 2019

[2:00:26] will
[2:00:28] if he blessed us he's blessed us with
[2:00:30] employees and all kind of thing and I
[2:00:32] said Lord we just need some old
[2:00:33] customers
[2:00:35] and and I have to go from pretty much
[2:00:40] one place to the next place just trying
[2:00:43] to introduce the business to people and
[2:00:45] let them know what we do and everything
[2:00:47] and they're what we call cold visits but
[2:00:50] as a believer I walk into the visit with
[2:00:54] a particular scripture in my heart and
[2:00:57] that scripture is that wherever the
[2:00:59] soles of my feet were tricked
[2:01:04] Goff said he gave it to me so I just say
[2:01:07] Lord I thank you for the customers that
[2:01:09] end right here and I thank you for
[2:01:11] giving me customers right here god

[2:02:18] we got to do with all of this right and
[2:02:21] I just don't think God just saying say
[2:02:23] things just to be standing brother
[2:02:24] brother smiley said something that was
[2:02:27] very powerful yet so simple says it's
[2:02:30] just hard to get people to believe the
[2:02:32] word it's all God wants you to do just
[2:02:35] believe the word
[2:02:37] [Music]
[2:02:38] and I'm gonna tell you all something
[2:02:40] that that testimony shared about sister
[2:02:42] Nellie you know just we are we are we're
[2:02:46] holding on believe in God for y'all
[2:02:50] everybody here heard church next door
[2:02:55] yes and we have to have service like
[2:02:57] this all the time it just is just be
[2:02:59] overflowing it into the sanctuary place
[2:03:02] and the way that the landlord here in
[2:03:04] this
[2:03:06] this is just place has done it they
[2:03:10] bring all the churches and put them in
[2:03:12] one little corner and we got to try to
[2:03:15] you know over-talk one another with this
[2:03:17] music and everything else makes it very
[2:03:22] difficult sometimes very challenging now
[2:03:25] I know God uses a man our being here for
[2:03:28] his glory even heard actually surrender
[2:03:34] what was her name sure yeah she said to
[2:03:37] tell you how she was a high school
[2:03:40] classmate of yours and she said tell
[2:03:43] Gina I said hi so I'm telling Gina she
[2:03:46] said but you see I saw on Sunday and we
[2:03:51] were just fellowship with a little bit
[2:03:52] and and before she could leave out of
[2:03:55] our presence she said you know in some
[2:03:57] skirts be walking out of that church
[2:04:00] I say huh it's some skirts be walking
[2:04:04] out that church praise the Lord I'm glad
[2:04:08] that they notice it right God God God
[2:04:11] have us here for a reason
[2:04:13] we understand that said but Lord you
[2:04:15] know we praying and believe in you for
[2:04:17] something more in and what you've done
[2:04:18] for us over the past couple of years we
[2:04:20] can't help but believe you for the
[2:04:22] impossible
[2:04:23] somebody had text me on Monday and they
[2:04:27] say you know that church that you
[2:04:29] believe in fun it was just so we keep
[2:04:39] our faith ain't man in God until till
[2:04:42] God say otherwise and brother smiley
[2:04:45] coming here tonight he didn't know that
[2:04:49] that happened right and he come and
[2:04:51] share this testimony about somebody that
[2:04:53] had a cash offer i'ma taste them if God
[2:04:58] got something for you
[2:05:00] then God got something for you and ain't
[2:05:03] nobody can step in and take it from you
[2:05:06] so I'll say I believe that well I'm
[2:05:08] holding on to that and I'm just gonna
[2:05:11] believe words
[2:05:14] [Music]
[2:05:15] I don't know what's gonna happen between
[2:05:17] now and then but I'm sure I add more to
[2:05:20] the testimony I just
[2:05:21] I'm just making footprints that's all I
[2:05:23] can do hey man I just I appreciate that
[2:05:26] so I don't think I don't think God spoke
[2:05:29] these things haphazardly I think God had
[2:05:34] a way of encouraging our hearts just
[2:05:35] just only believe Church no matter what
[2:05:37] it is that you're facing only belief I
[2:05:40] didn't know the extent of the damage to
[2:05:45] my mother's car I didn't know amen and
[2:05:47] they said that the other cars were worse
[2:05:49] off but when I heard about the accident
[2:05:52] I was actually already praising God in
[2:05:55] advance for her new car I was already
[2:05:58] thinking God in advance for her new car
[2:06:00] that's the God we serve right amen amen
[2:06:04] amen
[2:06:05] man so you know it was a Satan you can
[2:06:08] have that you want that you can have
[2:06:10] that God got something much for me
[2:06:12] phrase alone and I'm gonna be driving
[2:06:14] that to church
[2:06:16] we're gonna going somebody you know we
[2:06:18] gotta learn a man to just worship in the
[2:06:24] midst of whatever we going through you
[2:06:26] know why because all things work
[2:06:28] together for good to them that love God
[2:06:31] to them who are the called according to
[2:06:33] his purpose Church before we leave
[2:06:36] tonight I just wanted to read a quote
[2:06:40] over you and they meant also a scripture
[2:06:42] if I can

[2:06:48] this and I just felt it appropriate to
[2:06:50] read this the scripture I want to read
[2:06:52] actually not the quote first of
[2:06:53] scripture gonna be first it's got to
[2:06:55] come from Philippians chapter 3 as we

[2:07:21] into 2020 don't worry about the things
[2:07:23] of the past but let's move forward and
[2:07:25] gone and the Bible says brother not
[2:07:28] counting out myself to have apprehended
[2:07:32] but this one thing I do forgetting those

[2:07:38] forth unto those things which are before
[2:07:41] and I love this is not gonna be easy but
