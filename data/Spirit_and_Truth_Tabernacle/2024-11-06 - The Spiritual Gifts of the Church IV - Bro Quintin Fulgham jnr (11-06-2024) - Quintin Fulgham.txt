[Music] amen amen well I want to uh welcome brother Quinton amen and allow him to come and in his own special way uh Lord will just use them amen to speak to us tonight let's say praise the Lord as he

oh Lord Jesus Christ Lord we are a different people oh Lord Jesus Christ oh lord it's something that you've been trying to get us to realize this this whole entire time oh Lord God is is the difference that uh uh that you make in us oh Lord Jesus Christ Lord help me oh Lord to get myself out the way oh Lord God if and and and to let the people know oh Lord God that the the gifts in the church that we've been talking about we've been teaching about we've been preaching about oh Lord God it's not for a show Lord God it's not for somebody to get Glory out of it but it's for the people oh Lord God to hear from you oh Lord God meaning that it's their faith that works the gift oh Lord God lord if they have if if somebody needs a word from you oh Lord that you need to hear and to be spoken Through Me Oh Lord God you can just turn this little uh word that I have upside down Lord to speak to that need to someone that needs it oh Lord God Lord help the people to catch the faith oh Lord God to know Lord that you are presently here oh Lord God the gifts are here oh Lord God you're operating in them oh lord to bless the people Lord God oh Lord bless the people Lord God and be with us in the service in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen amen so we are continuing our journey uh and this is actually going to be this should be the finishing uh of the spiritual gifts of the church part 4 um so we're going to turn to First Corinthians H and then we're going to read verses of 1 Corinthians 12 we're going to read verses 29 through 28 and just say Amen once you get there well hold on one second 28 through 29 yeah 28 through 29 and it reads here and God have set some in the church first apostles secondarily prophets thirdly teachers after that Miracles then Gifts of healings helps governments diversities of tongues are all Apostles are all prophets are all teachers are all workers of Miracles so we're going to we've actually finished up um and you guys may be seated uh we've actually finished finished up our um kind of working working with these nine spiritual gifts to identify what they are how they're to be operated into the church uh and it's for you to be able to identify in your life if you could see if you have one of these gifts uh and we've already seen these gifts actually operating uh and I like how brother Jack had he feels anger uh and he and uh he had for companionship meaning he wants to speak to his people he's always wanting to speak speak to his people um so we've talked about those non uh spiritual gifts we've experienced them we seeing God working them but in this verse um I believe it's verse 28 there's a little thing in here um a little part in here in verse 28 that talks about helps uh helps in the church um and I like how it says the word helps with a s right and not just help right right meaning that it's a plural thing that it's uh uh it's a it's something where it's it's many people that should be uh doing these things uh and this isn't uh of course this isn't a uh one of the nine spiritual uh spiritual gifts and so I don't know if everybody will have spiritual gifts I don't know that but I know that you can find a place within the body to be beneficial to the body right so you know uh you see the seats you're sitting in uh the partitions that are up the sound stuff that gets put up the camera people can enjoy the stream it doesn't just magically just pop up there you know people are making an actual sacrifice right every single week out of their schedule in order for that to go up so now when the gifts coming into the church as we've experienced and people see it on the stream they're blessed by that right so it's right with his eyes he was making these clicking sounds that was kind of bouncing off the wall so he was able to get it I believe his brain was able to create an image in his mind for him to be able to see that I thought that's really that was a really really cool thing um but the thing about it is God gave you eyes to see right God gave us eyes to see not for not for our uh it's not the job for our ears to be able to do that and the thing about helps in the church is that when someone is not playing their part the body is going to compensate in another way where someone else has got to take over that thing right right and then that causes a strain in the body now the body is not functioning like it should be functioning right that's why Paul said our all eyes are all ears are all the teeth no we all have our individual roles in order to help out and I believe that that's how the gifts uh God is concerned about those things because he wants his church working together God wants to see his body working in Harmony and so that's why I believe when uh annias I believe it was when they came to the uh came up to Peter and they told that lie uh cuz they weren't putting their full share of things they dropped dead right there God didn't want anyone in the church he said you got all these people coming in here and they're giving 100% everyone that's coming up to this line and giving 100% you going to come up in here and then try to cheat the people like that and try to cause Discord God said no I can't have this in my church that's how serious God was because and it's not to scare people you know it's we want we all want we all want to work together we all want to Bear each other's burdens we all want to uh um come to church and be able to enjoy the presence of the Lord without having to you know worry about if this thing be happening or this thing is uh happening so help is a very important uh gift that I believe is a part of the body um it's one of those things where Paul said he said those ones that are not mentioned as much those are the ones that you really got to keep your eye on so I believe I believe help is one of those things right so now we're going to switch off gears um to the Minal gifts of the church that are actually part of the body and of course everyone knows this as the fivefold ministry uh we're going to turn to Ephesians 4 and we're going to read verses uh 11 through 13 and so we're kind of going to we're going to going to talk about these so we're going to talk about how the fivefold ministry fits in also with these nine spiritual gifts to complete the church so Ephesians 4 11-13 and the Bible says and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying edifying of the body of Christ we're go ahead and read verse 13 to till we all come in the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ so this work that these five individuals that are doing uh is what unifies Us in faith and what brings us into to a perfect man so when we talk about a perfect man you're talking about some something that is that is now can be presentable to God God can be pleased with this person God can have faith in this person God can trust this person with his word God can tell the person to go that way God can tell the person to go that way and have full confidence that whatever he sends him to do he's going to do it fully right so that is uh the uh work of the uh of the ministry and we're going to start with some preliminary quotes uh out of question questions and answers on the seals preached in 63 0324 and it's paragraph 233 and I know I have a lot of quotes so I'll just I'll just start reading them um and it this was a question that um somebody had asked the prophet and it says with the bride of Christ with the bride of Christ have a Ministry before the Rapture the prophet says sure that's what's going on right now amen see the bride of Christ certainly it is the message of the hour see the bride of Christ sh she consists of Apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors is that right that's the bride of Christ sure she's got a Ministry great ministry the ministry of the hour it'll be so humble amen right so we all have a Ministry and we're going to read out of the message perseverance uh preaching 62 and 0 0218 paragraph 240 just to kind of kind of uh hammer this thing down it says 240 it says now he set in the church to keep the church in line with the word right so their job is to keep make sure everyone is staying on the word because as your gifts are coming forth and everyone's going to be wanting to use their gifts you know we all got to we always have to make sure that the word is is kept first and that the word is is is in the church and not just the gifts in the church right so now he set in the church to keep the church in line with the word what Apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists offices of the church now this is an important thing God sent not man called God sent inspired men to keep the church lined up right now what is it gifts of the Spirit in the church not a bunch of fanaticism which just means your own idea what you think about it what you feel about it because that just creates chaos because when when a bunch of people come together they got their own ideas some of you that have been in a marriage you know um now you may have been an American right and you came from your own culture you came from your own household and your H the wife came from her own household the husband came from her own household you know and when they get together they're talking but what they don't see is the differences that they have behind each other so then when they get into the marriage they realized there was a lot of ideas that didn't always match up Line to Line and so now you got to work do that thing right so God sets in order and that's why um I think brother Solomon was was the one that said he when he had uh talking talking about it Sunday that marriage is actually three people it's a man a woman and Christ and Christ is the one that comes down and breaks up all the fanaticism and says hold on a second y'all need to stay right right down in line with this so God creates God calls these five4 ministers to come down here uh to keep the church uh in in line with the word so it says not a bunch of fanaticism but truly gifts of the Spirit in the church that's right keeping the church if a real church was ordained of God really filled with the Holy Spirit if sin would appear in a church it would be like it would be another like a a niist for when a real church I walk into one of one I walk into one see all the women and men under the power of the Holy Spirit if somebody had done something wrong the Holy Spirit rise right up reveal it they'd have to clean it up that's the gifts of the Spirit in the church oh God send us a church like that send us like that one you believe it so and what he's saying is that these gifts make sure that the church is clean right because we want a clean church we don't want to just be coming a church and you know everyone living there in everybody living any any old kind of life and allowing any old kind of sin because that's how the church eventually becomes a separated church or you start to have issues in the church and people start living in the church but when the Holy Spirit when the Holy Spirit has full control of the church amen it's the one thing that he does is he always calls out s always calls out sin no matter how much uh God may love you right and he does love us but he does not like sin and we saw that when uh when Christ uh when Christ was in the temple as a as a young child and Mary came up to him and said hey me and your father we were looking for you and he corrected her and said hold on a second God is my father right cuz she had testified of that so the word always comes to correct to make sure that we're staying in line with our testimony he wasn't rebuking her he was actually trying to make sure that she kept her testimony right that the Holy Spirit had overshadowed her so the word was correcting to make sure she was staying in line and that's what God comes with the fivefold ministry so now we're going to read from the samiran church age uh preached in 61206 paragraph 19-20 and this is this is the one that's going to kind of tie it all together uh with the gifts in the church and the ministerial gift and the and we want to see and like I said this first sentence is the most important one God never intended the church to be run by men so the church is not ran by men none of us in here you know you know I love every single one one of you guys and I know you guys love me and I know we may be buddies and friends but ain't no one in this church running it this church is not being run by men right the prophet said God runs his church amen and he runs it through gifts of the spirit right gifts of the Spirit so each one of us has a gift and God wants us to yield that to so he can run his church it says here the gifts of the Spirit is in the church to correct the spirit he's got five ministerial offices in the church first of them is Apostles or missionaries missionar is the highest calling there is Apostle the word missionary means one sent Apostle means one sent and we're going to uh skip down to uh 20 paragraph 20 and it says then in each local church there's nine spiritual gifts so you have the five ministerial gifts and then in each local church there's nine spiritual gifts that come among the people that is knowledge wisdom Gifts of healing working of Miracles speaking with tongues interpretation of tongues and all these things go in each local body and every person in the church has an individual Ministry that means every single one of you guys has a Ministry which means God doesn't just expect you just to come to church and just to sit God wants to work through you God has put a gift inside you and God wants to see you doing something right toefit the church right as a whole and he says and that individual Ministry goes together with the rest of the ministry to edify the body of Christ so you see how we're all in this thing together it's all of us working together it's not one person it's not the just the fivefold ministry or just the gifts of healing or just the gifts of faith for nothing we're all working together in order to edify the body praise God so with this journey we're going to start off with um as the fivefold ministry we're going to start off with the Evangelist all right and this is a Ministry that is the one that gets everybody excited right uh when a when when evangelist comes out when evangelist comes out I feel like he's and I don't want to say it in this way but I feel like evangelists are the famous ones like when you think of like a minister right and you think of an evangelist it's just there's just certain names that you go to and it's just like they kind of have like kind of a Fame in Fame in the uh in the message right right they do they kind of they're like the famous ones that's I don't want to say it like that but it's you know but it's true right because you know evangelists they have such a way of bringing down the spirit of God that is so unique from every other position and so when I think of an evangelist I think of people like brother Diggs I think of brother Burley I think of brother Jewel I remember when I was a kid and brother Jewel I think they called him like the because I mean like when he get preaching and he would just to get to stomping his feet up on the platform and it was just like it was just so much fire and I think also kind of like Donnie Reagan these are people that like when they start preaching they just just explode like they just uh it's just a fire that they have right and so when an evangelist is done preaching is you feel so spiritually energized right you know you feel like can go right down to the gates of hell knock on the door and just smack the devil in the face a pastor may not be able to do that to you a teacher may not be able to do that to you but evangelist just gives you that he just gives you that um where you feel like you can just do anything right you know and and that's why usually when people say when brother Diggs is coming to town you know then then everyone want to come to church or if if if it's was brother digs coming on a Wednesday everybody's coming on a Wednesday to hear Brother Diggs right but it's just it's just their position it's just the way God made them that Charisma that he's given them which is a gift that you can't impersonate that thing you cannot impersonate that thing right uh so we're going to read uh in the message God doesn't call man to judgment without first warning him paragraph 63 uh I mean preaching 63072 but paragraph 107 and we'll see what the prophet said about this uh this uh Evangelistic uh evangelist gift and I'll just go start start reading it says the Evangelist is a special man he's a man that's burning like a fireball runs into a city and preaches his message then gets out of there somewhere else see he's a special man so he's just got he's just got fire he's just got energy he just comes in there preaches his word and then he's on his way right um so an evangelist is uh one of the things that we love about the evangelists is how they bring the blessings of God down they make you realize you can really attain what you're praying for what you're what you're having faith for they make you really really believe that you can do it uh and the opposite side of that is not just the blessings but they're also good at bringing conviction down onto people right bringing uh bringing people into uh conviction and so I like to think of as an evangelist is also a a Christian manager who a Christian minister who preaches to convert the souls he can he can go into a town of people that are not Christian and then when he finishes talking everybody wants to be a Christian now everybody wants to uh serve the Lord now people that didn't didn't know what who God was but they just have that Charis they just have that anointing that they just make anybody want to follow Christ right um and I feel like one of the biggest biggest things uh that are part of that's a part of an evangelist is they have a courage to them right they really really have a courage to them uh because I feel I believe that some of I believe EV a part of the uh the office of an evangelist is they're going to people that don't know God right they're going to people that don't know what uh um uh the uh the first verse of the Bible is or the last verse they don't know any of the books they don't know who Jesus Christ is they may have heard about these things but they don't really know but evangelist comes down there just to convict those souls to make them realize you know you're a sinner but Christ died for you right um and so that's why I believe um that's why I believe that evangelist usually have very powerful testimonies uh when you when you uh look at evangelists and what they go through in life their testimony is just as loud as they are you know what they've gone through right uh so that before they say anything you just can see the walking living example I mean people that have gone through Cancers and stuff like that you just see them walking and talking and then get up here and start ministering you're like this is just a miracle right it just makes you want to believe right so and I guess I kind of want to uh tie this thing to uh an example here we're going to turn to Jonah uh chapter 3 and Verses 4 through five we're going to start with four 4-5 now I want you to realize that Jonah was someone that was he was running away from God and God had put him in the belly of a fish and he repented to God and God had delivered this man out of a fish so you can imagine how the people were when they saw this guy a fish pull up on the beach and they saw Jonah just walk out of this fish you can imagine what their what their what their mindset was seeing this man right and so in verse four it says and Jonah began to enter into the city of days journey and he cried and said yet 40 days in Nineveh shall be o be overthrown that's the thing about evangelists they don't need to say much they don't really a couple of verses uh and they just start taking off and that fire just starts building up that's right and in verse five it says so the people of Nineveh believed God and proclaimed a fast and put on sackcloth and from the and I want you to notice this this sentence this last right here from the greatest of them even to the least of them I believe evangelist they capture everybody it doesn't matter who you are everybody will remember an Evangelistic uh uh message right um and then reading in verses 9-1 um it we just see the people says here who can tell if God will turn and repent and turn away his Fierce anger this is what the people are saying that we perish not God saw their works and that they turned from their evil way and God repented of the evil and he said that he would that he would do unto him and he did it not so we see that when Jonah came with this message and the people repentant it was a real repentance it wasn't no dry eyye repentance the people really really repented to God and God stopped the Wrath that he was going to do so the this this position of evangelist they can really really cause conviction on the people and uh allow people to be serious with God right and when you're serious with God then God can uh you know God can come down and make a change so that's the Evangelist next up is the uh the apostle so we're going to go back to that message uh God doesn't call a man to judgment without first warning him uh in 63 we're going to read from paragraph 107 pull that up all right and it says uh let's see okay 107 it says here it says and then we find out the Apostle is a special man he's a Setter in order he's a man that's sent from God to set things in order right so I believe Apostle is kind of like a temporary Pastor right um they're there to kind of make sure that uh things are being set in order before a pastor comes to kind of take on a group of people um we can kind of look at it from a scriptural standpoint when we see the Apostle Paul kind of uh introducing Timothy because Paul was an apostle Paul Paul was not just a prophet and a teacher he was also commissioned to be an apostle as well well and we see him being we see him also laying on the hands I believe and kind of ordaining and blessing Timothy to be the minister for that church and then Paul just went off somewhere else right to set things uh other things in order so they they get a group of people that are believers and they kind of you know start that start that uh start the church off and then God will select a pastor for the group so the Apostle's work is a temporary work is he's not supposed to be there all the time it's a temporary work cuz will elect a pastor and we'll get to that because the pastor is the head of the church right um and the pastor will come in there and then take over the church right and so after that is done the Apostle work is done and he either goes back to his home church or he goes wherever God leads him next uh so we're going to turn to the message Jesus Christ the same um preached in 56 paragraph 16 and I'll just go ahead and read it um says but God and for the perfecting of the church has set the church Apostles you say Apostles yes sir now how how would people ever want to change their name and call themselves missionaries instead of Apostles I don't know a missionary and Apostle is exactly the same word uh one cent that's right a missionary is an apostle so that an apostle is a missionary it's one that's been sent and when a man feels LED of God and sent to uh s of God to go to Africa India that makes him an apostle uh and or a missionary right so when you feel God has placed in a calling on you to go to a certain area right that makes you an apostle that makes you a missionary you're going to set things in order for a group of people that are not in order right um and so there's a couple of things that we we kind of want to see with the of this role of apostle uh is because so Paul was not only an apostle Paul was actually the prophet messenger for his age EXA so Paul went around correcting the churches and it's not it's not the job of an apostle to go around correcting churches right because we have the message to uh of the day in each Church to correct us right an apostle just goes and does the work and so and I've seen brother brandom actually mention uh uh males and females as missionaries and so I believe you know people can go to people can do missionary work and I believe I believe what you call them is you call them mission trips right so you're going on the mission to set something in order Set uh um set a group of Believers into order you know some people will you know get a water supply for them some people will get Bibles and message books and get the correct translation for them to be able to read their Bibles and read the message they'll bring food they'll bring clothing uh they'll share the word with them and stuff like that uh and it's a of course like I said it's a temporary work because you're not going there going there to conquer so if you have a missionary you have a mission you're going to an area and you've been there for years that's not missionary work you you're you're conquering right you know and we can see that with the uh with the Catholic church and where they went wrong and also you hear about the if you've read in history about the Crusades where people were going in the name of God to go and convert the people and if you know the people ain't believe they throw them in jail and build up churches for them and they forc people into a religion in order to keep that religion they set the military there but when God doesn't the holy spirit is what keeps the people together you don't have to worry about converting people or forcing people to serve God no God knows exactly who's his own God knows exactly who he needs to go to and and the Holy Spirit will keep them and you don't have to worry about staying there and watching over them to make sure are they going to still are they still going to live this are they going to still live that no the same holy ghost in Africa uh is the same holy ghost in the United States is the same holy ghost in Europe and it will always keep his people by the word right so right so that's a tempor that's that's a temporary work and um and I believe that the uh the Apostle is is is the head of that thing because he's ordained to this uh uh he's ordained to this uh position in the fful ministry to be the head of it because it has to be by the word right it has to be by the word the fful ministry is by the word so the next person that we have up on here is the prophet and this one is uh this one can be a this one can be very very confusing because you see the word Prophet all over the place in the Bible we all know we have a prophet of our age um but I believe brother Brandon kind of clears this thing up for us about the differences between these things so we're going to turn to the message the voice of the sign preached in 64 0214 and it's paragraphs 81- 83 um because and um the because the prophet has also he preached the message a year before that referring to prophets as seers and I'm not the one I I am not a person that will be to uh correct a prophet so I believe however you kind of Define if you define a prophet how the prophet is defined it's it's okay I'm I'm just kind of just shedding shedding some light on you know what I've kind of read through uh these things and based off what he said so this is paragraph 81 he says now the English word a prophet just means a preacher and the prophet has gone on and said that a new testament Prophet is a preacher right see anybody every preacher is a prophet cuz he for telling something preaching the word under inspiration is called a prophet but when we read versus uh paragraph I mean paragraph 82 but in the Old Testament they were more than that they were seers see they were man that they were men who told things that was coming to pass and happened that give the rights to be The Interpreter of the word for that day because God took the word of the day and interpreted it himself through that man and that's what come for that's what come on the earth for he always is a sign when a prophet comes on Earth just watch as we go through and see if it isn't so he always sends a prophet and when you see a prophet rise on the scene look out we're looking for uh one to come right so and and in this in this instance because when you read the New Testament you'll see that there were people that also because a lot of times we refer to prophets uh we reference vision and prophecies and stuff like that and it is true there are people in the New Testament that have visions there was a guy uh named uh an anas and God gave him a vision to go and talk to Paul or Saul and to uh start his work right and so he gave him a vision right so um but I I um and like I said this this is kind of brother Jack he can correct me later on uh but this is kind of my personal uh uh thought on this is that uh as just as the prophet said uh uh there's a difference between a prophet Seer and then also a prophet preacher within the fivefold ministry the fivefold ministry you're carrying the word right you're actually carrying the word so you so you have to be able to rightly divide the word right it's not it's it's it's it's it's a lot it's a lot it's it's it is seeing V seeing visions is very very important but you have to be able to uh um preach the word in season out of season if you come up here and you're preaching a message and it's just all over the place I I don't know if I can fit you into the fivefold ministry I can't I don't know if if uh if that if that is a gift of God working through you uh but the people aren't being blessed by it right and so I what you can kind of I guess you can kind of look at this as an example is like when you kind of see motivational speakers now motivational speakers um they'll come to you and they'll say hey if you invest in your dreams in tomorrow you won't feel the I mean if you investing your dreams today you won't feel the guilt tomorrow right and so they kind of kind of try to uplift you up and they're very and they're very if you notice a lot of motivational preachers are very very preachy as well you can you can ask those ones as they grow up some of them benefited from and some of them didn't but that person was trying to forell you of something right so and I think that's kind of the difference between a prophet is that he is a preacher right um and he's able to uh uh uh handle the word um and so uh that's what I believe um you call that's why I believe as the prophet as in a fivefold Ministry someone that can come preach the word because if you you even notice with brother brandom you know when brother Brandon would come and he would preach right he would preach the word and the word would come forth then after the preaching of the word then he would have the prayer line then he would see Visions as people that come so those were two different roles that he was doing when the Visions when the when when he came to the prayer line he was seeing the Visions he wasn't preaching to the people he was just repeating the Visions as hey hey God I see this I see that I see that and that but when he was preaching it's no it's not a time for prayer line this for the time for the word to come forth in order to get into the hearts of the people and the reason why I say this is because you don't want people to get confused when cuz I believe people can still see Visions brother brandham said his son was a prophet and I believe it and I believe people today still see visions and stuff like that but you got to be careful about how you fit because one you got to be if if you want to say you're a prophet in the fivefold ministry you have to be able to handle the word which means you got to be able to rightly divide it right because you don't want people kind of mixing into stuff and that's where the problem comes when you know someone will get a someone will get a gift of prophecy on them and they'll they'll say utterance and they'll prophesy on somebody and all of a sudden now they believe that everything that they say is you know they're a prophet it's like no no no no no no no you got to you got to keep it in order and make sure you define these things correctly so that it doesn't lift you up right yes so that is uh the prophet uh in the fold fold Ministry and then next we're going to talk about uh is the pastor right so we're going to go to he Hebrews uh the message Hebrews chapter 7 it was preached in 57 uh and 0922 and paragraph uh 282 so it says here that but the full and complete authority of the church is the pastor read that in the Bible see if that's not Bible order that's exactly right there is no one above the Elder uh this is this is what the prophet is saying he says I have nothing to do with what brother Neville does here that's up to you and brother Neville if brother Neville wanted to preach Jehovah Witness Doctrine that's up to him and you and this was brandom Tabernacle right you see if he wanted to preach anything he wanted to that's between you and him that's all right if the congregation votes for him there to preach that that's all right that's up to him right so the pastor uh the the prophet said the Pastor is the full and complete authority of the church uh so you may have Apostles you may have evangelists you may have teachers you may have prophets uh but these positions still need a home Church you can't say you're an evangelist you can't say you're a teacher you can't say you're a prophet and then not going to church no everybody has a pastor right and so if if these positions that are called from God which the high positions have a pastor that means every single body on the face of the Earth need think about it every cuz God expects everyone to follow him every single body on the face of the Earth and this is why it's such a big position everybody on the face of the earth needs a pastor Amen brother brandham even referred to uh as Jezebel when he she said cuz she wasn't in line with the word but he still referred to Elijah as her pastor whether she wanted it or not still referred to her as that was her pastor that's right right so everybody needs a pastor everyone has to go to church everyone needs a home Church Church all right and the pastor is uh is the head of the church he's the one that's in charge um and it's it's the position in the fivefold ministry that it's the only position in the F Ministry that actually comes with qualifications and that's just to show the importance of the position right so and and it doesn't mean that the pastor is a dictator right no he's there to Serve the People he's there to protect the people he's there to help the people the prophet said that a pastor is likened to a Shepherd it is protecting sheep he's there to be your protor he's there to look out for you which is why it's it's it's it's of such uh uh importance you know so a pastoring uh cuz a lot of people can get it a lot of people can get it wrong pastoring is not just preaching it's not just coming up behind a pull pit and you just preaching a sermon every Sunday and preaching every Wednesday no no no no you're there to serve the people after the church because when people in the church everyone's feeling good but the battles really come through the week uh and so if you feel led you know just to be a preacher you might just be a prop right but but a pastor is a lot more is a lot more than that and so we're going to we're going to read from the message God doesn't call a man to judgment once again preaching 63 to see what the prophet said of uh of a pastor to to really really fully understand what this um what this role encompasses um and right and and it's important for you as a church to understand what these positions are and these different gifts are because you don't go to a teacher if you're looking for someone to Bear your burdens which is supposed to be the pastor you don't go to leadership to an apostle if you have an A if you have a pastor in your church right you have to make sure that you know these roles and how they operate amen all right so we're going to read uh I believe it's paragraph uh 104 and what it says here is but you see in the church there is the pastor and the pastor is a special person he's built to where he can he can put up with the fusses of the people he's a burden Bearer he's the ax of the team he's a man that can sit down when when uh somebody's got something against somebody else and sit down with them two families and take neither side and reason it out and bring it right back into sweetness see he's a pastor he knows how to take care of things and so I want you to notice it didn't say anything about preaching in that it didn't say nothing about the preaching it talked about dealing with the people and they being able to take these two sides because it's very political these things get very very political and and politics is I know we don't bring politics in church but when you're dealing with a lot of people and different ideas it always gets political and the pastor has to be somebody that doesn't have any point of view he doesn't he doesn't agree with any point of view and he just sets the people down and just kind of bears with them because the problems and I mean you see with our political State now uh problem problems don't just get solved in one day it may take time for people to kind of get over their differences but a pastor he's gifted in a way that the prophet says he can reason it out and bring it right back into sweetness so if you can't do that you're probably not called to be to be a pastor right it's more it's more than just preaching right and brother Jack had told me that you know one time he had preached before a congregation and he said that he could feel the burden of the people uh and what that means is that he a pastor is able to is able to Bear your burdens right he's a person that can bear your burdens he knows what you're feeling he knows what you're going through you know he's someone you can talk to he's someone you can uh sit down with he's someone you can share your problems with because he's literally built to Bear what you're dealing with so you don't have to bear it by yourself amen right all right so that's the pastor right so you got to pray for your pastors right they're the they're the quarterback of the of the church and so lastly um what we'll talk about uh is uh the teacher all right and we'll see the importance of this role uh especially with a theme of this year because uh a teacher is also a very special role right uh and teaching is is associated with uh restoration right so back in that message of God doesn't call a man to judgment without warning him first we're going to see what the prophet said about a preacher is in paragraph 106 and the prophet says the teacher is a special man he sits back under the anointing of the spirit and is able to take the words and put them together by the holy spirit that the pastor or evangelist either one could not compare with him that's right right so it's a whole different Ministry than uh uh than um the other Ministries and so we're going to read uh in questions and answers uh preaching 5401 038 and uh paragraph 20 through 23 we're going to see exactly this how important uh this position is okay and it's paragraph 20 through 23 all right and I'll just start reading it and it says and a man's got to have a leader and the leader is the Holy Spirit and the holy spirit sets in the church first apostles after that prophets and so forth someone said someone said not long ago said why brother Brandon we don't need anybody to teach us when the Holy Ghost comes we don't need anybody to teach he said the Bible says you don't you do not need teaching I said then why did the same Holy Spirit set in the church teachers see see and set the church in order they would we got to have teachers that's right but you oughtn't to have anyone don't have don't have to teach you saying Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not swear and take you already know that your very conscience of the of the Holy Spirit tells you it's wrong to do that so that's not not teaching a lot of people think they I just read the Bible and have God teach me no that's that's that's not teaching 23 says but now as far as spiritual teaching it takes a holy ghost anointed that's right and God has set the church in order by Apostles and Prophets gives a healing and miracles and so forth he sets in the church in order and puts teachers and so forth in there to guide and direct his church uh um and then we're going to also read from Hebrews uh chapter 5 and six uh and it's number the number one sermon and it's preaching 57 and it's paragraph 51-52 and I'll go to read that quickly watch she's pulling it up so it says Paul speaking to this Hebrew group yet Scholars he is speaking to now Scholars we well learned we find that in a few a few moments very very scholarly but the Deep spiritual mystery the church is still blinded to it he said when you ought to be teaching others you're still a babe oh I know there's many rise up and go out and say oh I don't need to go to church anymore praise God the Holy Ghost has come he's the teacher when you get that idea you're wrong for why did the Holy Ghost set teachers in the church if he was going to be the teacher see there's first apostles prophets teachers evangelist and pastors the holy spirit sets teachers in the church so he could teach through the teacher and if it isn't according to the word God doesn't confirm it then it isn't the right kind of teaching that must compare with the entire Bible right so teaching is important because um so when you think about the mind of God right I I I would say that evangelists are in the Forefront of the Forefront of of the mind of God prophets are in the Forefront of the mind of God Apostles are in the Forefront of the mind of God that's where God is doing kind of like the initial work I'll say pastors would be kind of like in the middle but teachers are in the back side back side of the mind of God so when anointing comes down every single position in the ministry catches something and a teacher catches the backside mind or what God really means about his word right so a teacher is someone is uh uh they tell you when they're telling you about the word of God they're they're giving you an interpretation saying hey this is what God means when he says this thing this is what God really means or when he says this thing this is what God really means and questions and answers preached in 61 paragraph 51 you'll see the PE uh the the prophet will say um someone had asked the question God called me to be a teacher Pro the prophet said watch how he interprets the word see if he gets it all mixed up and everything then you can tell that he's not a teacher right you can tell that he's not a teacher If he if he gets the thing all mixed up and stuff like that that's not coming from the mind of God but when everything he says you can take it from Genesis all the way to Revelation and it lines up then you know that you have a complete the complete thought of God uh uh and the mindset of what God had uh uh what God was meaning right so a teacher is uh is God's interpreter of the word that's why you can't stay home and read your Bible and I will even go further to say this uh humbly that you can't just stay home and listen to the tapes that's right you can't just stay home and listen to the tapes um because there are a lot there are a lot of things and even and a lot of us have been in the message now you know a lot of us been in the message for years and there are things that people don't agree with about what the prophet said right so you need someone to come down at God can say this is what God meant or this is what the prophet meant so that's why you can't stay at home and listen to tapes because and when you think about that if you're if you're at home and you're just listening to tapes you're just you're just you're just hearing the prophet in the tapes tells you that that's wrong amen the tapes tell you that they're wrong exactly right so if you can't understand that basic stuff what else are you missing exactly what else are you missing amen there's got to be other things that you're uh uh that you're missing that you're not understand and the Bible says that the bride has made herself ready and what is it with it's with the word and what that means is the bride knows what pleases God right so how can you know what pleases God if you don't understand what he's saying so when you're staying at home and you're listening to tapes and you're you're you're ignoring the authority of the fold Ministry you're ignoring the pastor that's in that's ordained for your area you're ignoring the teachers you're ignoring the prophet how can you please God how can God how can you expect to be in a Rapture when God comes back and he's expecting to see a word bride not just people that are enthusias about being in the message and listening to the message but God's coming back to see a bride fully clothed in the word how can you expect to make the Rapture praise God when there are people that are keeping the word and the Bible said that there were two types of virgins both were virgins one was uh wise and one was foolish and the difference was was oil right which was the Holy Spirit which is a teacher which teaches you to plead what what you need the life you need to live to please God so that uh uh it'll be acceptable and uh just to kind of see a type of that one of a story that I uh that's just a beautiful story in the Bible is Esther right Esther is a a beautiful type of this thing and I'll just kind of go to that and read a little bit of it um so you can turn to Esther uh chapter chapter 2 uh we can start at verse 7 uh and I like Esther because it's a short book but it's got so many good nuggets that we can uh bring and type to what we're at today so I'll start reading uh from verse S and it says and he brought up hadassa that is Esther his uncle's daughter for she had neither father nor mother and I like that how the Bible kind of starts this thing out for you had uh father nor mother meaning that she didn't she didn't have a beginning right you can kind of type it as she didn't have a beginning and anything that has the beginning has the end so this is kind of a type of predestination and when you receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit you no longer have a father and a mother because you have a new birth right you're a new creature and and I'm not saying that you just go home and say you know tell your dad that you ain't my dad no more you know you're not my mama no more I a't I ain't saying all that that but the Bible says you are a new creature and that's how and when you noticed how Jesus languaged when he was on the cross and Mary had cried the prophet said he called her woman didn't call her mother so when you've received the baptism the Holy Spirit you no longer have a father and mother because you've been born again you have a new birth right and so what we're then going to read um let's see it's down here to uh give me one second um and I just kind of I just kind of it's I just kind of say the overview of it but what what happens here is that um Esther and the prophet will talk about this in the in the message Esther is being presented to goba uh all these women are coming together because um the king is uh trying to get a new Queen vasy wasn't uh living according to what he wanted and so now this King uh this great king is now trying to choose a new wife right and so Esther is um now it's her turn to go before the king and she and they ask if she wants to wear jewelry and all of these other stuff and she just rejects all of it right uh and the B and what the Bible says is that she didn't take all of that and brother brandom typed that to the world she didn't take any of the world on her she didn't want none of she didn't want nothing what the world wanted even though everybody else want it and notice they were all virgins not just Esther all of them were virgins right they lived the life right but she didn't want the jewelry she didn't want the the dressing and all that that they had but what it says you'll notice in the Bible that there was a unic in the Bible that his name was haay and she own the Bible says that she only took the vi the advice of this unic who she had found favor with right so she you can look at that as a type of her being taught what it was to please the King right so in order to please the king you have to be taught to do it right you can't go with what the popularity or the popular opinion is right that gets you rejected by the king and so when Esther came before The King The King was like wow this is exactly what I wanted well how did she know right she took the advice of this unic right amen and so we know that a unic is someone that is uh consecrated uh is uh is living a life of kind of cons cration if you turn to Matthew uh 1912 we'll see uh Jesus Christ speak about this um this Bible verse and I think I had I read this a couple a couple weeks ago says for there are some Unix which were so born from their mother's womb and there are some Unix which were Unix of men and there be Unix which have made themselves Unix for the kingdom of Heaven's Sake right so uh a unic is some it's unit can be is it can be a type of someone that has consecrated their work for a service so this this uh hay guy person was a unic and he was consecrating his service for the King right and so um we can look at brother brandom as a type because a lot of times people worship brother brandham but they don't understand the role that he that he uh uh played and you can see it in the type of Isaac and choosing of the Bride brother Brandon was actually put on to the scene to prepare us in order to be received by Christ and we know that brother brandom consecrated his life to God because brother brandom you don't understand that the gift that brother brandham had he could have been a great man the gift that he had during his day he could have been a popular man he could have made a lot of money and in fact it was a struggle for him because I remember I think he was one time he was going in or he was in or Robert's church and he was wishing that he know man I wish I had some things like that and God said you know your your Porsche is in heaven and the uh the prophecy had come to him and said because you chose the harder route which is my way right you've chose the right way so we know that the prophet that we have right now he's consecrated his life in service it wasn't for him to become a great man but it was it was for him to prepare each and every single one of us to be presentable to God right that's what his service was now a lot of time and so you got to be careful because teaching is is is teaching is the heart of the things right so the Bible says in the beginning by one man fell which was Adam and so by one man must everybody be restored which is Christ and you notice that actually the first sermon uh the first sermon or the first uh yeah I guess you could say the first sermon or the first church meeting was actually uh uh in the Bible that we can see that we see in the Bible was a teaching and that was when God told Adam hey there's this tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and there's this uh Tree of Life eat from this tree right and you'll be okay and if you eat from that tree you'll perish and that was a teaching he was teaching them how to please God then the serpent came around and said oh Eve you'll surely not die and that was an anti- teing that was teaching them to not please God right and the reason why that uh and that that's how you can tell brother brandham said is if someone gets their teaching mixed up that uh that interpretation was the wrong interpretation because when they took from that tree they did die right the serpent told them that it wasn't going to die but God meant exactly what he taught to them that you're going to die and they and they exactly did die so a teacher has to come and interpret the word so a lot of people can believe the signs and the gifts and the healings and all that stuff and you got to be careful about that cuz um we're going to listen to what the prophet has said about a story about a guy so it's in the it's uh the message the queen of Queen of the South preached in 61127 e it's paragraph 89-90 and we're going to be closing in uh in a few we're going to see how uh important uh teaching is um okay so it says the prophet says here not long ago there was a man in a certain meeting just didn't believe in my teaching on the Bible and he goes to the meeting a certain fellow did and not knowing that I know about it cuz he's no more than saying it and I seen it in a vision in my hotel room I don't know I don't see how some people can do that and come up and say these things when you know you know better see you can't get past you can't get past the prophet right so he said now brother brandham this is what the guy has said he said now brother brandham is a prophet of the Lord he said but don't listen to his teaching because he's wrong so some people can believe the healing some people can believe the uh the gifts in the church and blessings and all that kind of stuff but when someone says a teaching is wrong you you got to really be careful that's what's restoring you back to God gifts and all that stuff are without repentance but in order to be taught and if you and if you realize teaching is uh teaching is what is being is what restoring us back to God so when you think of messages like marriage divorce that was a teaching right that restored what the purpose of marriage and divorce was because people had gotten away from it Paul had to preach it Jesus Christ had to teach it as well because people had gotten off of it you know the Pharisees that said you know Moses gave us a letter of divorce that was a wrong teaching because that wasn't what God that wasn't the backside of God in the beginning of the uh uh in the beginning of the garden there was no such thing as divorce right they had been taught to do something which God allowed but it wasn't the backside of God's mind and that's what a teacher does they get back there and say no this is what God really expects out of you right so he says but don't listen to his teaching because he's wrong the same holy spirit that preached the service tonight the same Holy Spirit preaches all these things is the same holy spirit that discerns the thoughts of the heart certainly and in verse 9 he says what is the mark of a prophet he's a Divine interpreter of the of the Divine word and so a teacher is of course under that position of a prophet because a prophet comes with the fullness of the word and a teacher comes under that and I want you to realize that teaching is not an intellectual thing it it's something that is divine God gets a hold of a man and while they're reading the Bible while they're uhh reading the uh What uh uh uh the mysteries of God God is unveiling himself to that person that vessel that's why he's not doing it to everybody so that's why you have to have the teachers that come into the church in order to teach the word in order to show you this is what God means otherwise you wouldn't get it right so he's a divine interpreter of the Divine word that's exactly the word of the Lord come to the prophets that's who it come to not the theologians people trying to you know people and and you can actually think of people that try if if you want to say that you're staying at home and listening to tapes and reading the Bible you're really just a theologian because what you're trying to what you're trying to say is you're trying to you're trying to understand this thing by yourself through your own wisdom and knowledge but God doesn't come to theologians and theologies right God has the order of how the word is to be received right that's who it come to not the Theologian it's the prophet right do you know what a prophet means take the dictionary look what look and see what it means and interpreter of the Divine word right so we don't just we don't just appreciate brother Brandon for his you know for the healing Ministries and the the the gifts of healing all that is great and the visions and stuff we love him because what he taught us he taught us what pleases God right he taught us how to please God what God expects uh uh out uh out of of us right uh and just as um just as Esther was uh prepared um just as Esther was prepared and taught uh to please the king it came to a spot that when she wanted to ask something from The King The King said he would have give her half the Kingdom right so because she was taught right to present herself before the uh King she was taught to please God right so those are the ministerial gifts of the body and we're going to kind of we we'll end this series with uh going to First Corinthians and kind of tying all these things together um and we'll kind of start with verse um let's see we'll start with kind of verse 12 and kind of read through just to kind of end up this series says for as the body is one and have many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ for by one Spirit we are we all baptized into one body whether we be jew or Gentiles whether we Bond or free and have been all made to drink into the spirit for the body is not one member but many we're all working together every one of us has a job every one of us has a gift to all work together uh uh to make this thing work Paul says if the foot shall say because I am not the hand I am not of the body is it it is it therefore not of the body and if the ear shall say because I am not of the eye I not of the body is it therefore not of the body if the whole body were an eye where were the hearing if the whole body were hearing where were the smelling but now God have set the members everyone in the body as he have pleased them so that means that every one of us is unique not no no one can take somebody else's place and this this and when I really understood this when I really kind of uh uh kind of meditated about this thing it's that's why it's important to pray for backsliders right a backslider is someone that's still a part of the body they're just out of position which means you're not a complete Church you are not a complete Church without that person so that means that they have you may have a need and only they can be the person to address it right God ordains these gifts God ordains these people before the foundation of the world to be in these gifted positions right to be able to understand certain things or uh you know Gifts of Faith Gifts of healing and all those things but if the if if our gift of faith is backsliding well how do we uh take advantage of our gift of faith you know if someone in a church is backsliding they have a gift of healing how do we take uh uh advantage of that gift of healing if they are not here right uh and the thing I like about the body is it's not something that's replaceable right when we're talking about restoration these things we can't just say okay well so and so left the church we just replace them no no no no we need that person so that's why the and that's why Christ has said when one person suffers we all suffer right so whether you realize it or not you suffering because everyone is dealing with stuff every single day we all dealing with battles we all dealing with stuff and the the uh the the the thing that we don't want to get stuck in our head is we don't have to fight these battles alone God has placed gifts in the church to help us out you don't got to struggle by yourself that's what the world does you see all the people dealing with mental heal health issues and anxiety and all that kind of stuff if you have a god a holy ghost filled Church you wouldn't be dealing with those things gifts are in the church to kind of help you overcome your mental problems and your anxiety and your stress you can't find a job or uh healing or you need uh you need Faith to overcome some kind of Victory God has placed all these uh gifts in the church so that we could all lean upon each other exactly right amen so we'll go ahead and uh end this uh in this in a word of prayer Lord Jesus Christ Lord your word is gone forth oh Lord God lord we know that we are part of a body oh Lord God that has been hand selected oh Lord Jesus Christ Lord it's it's it's it's it's a a h it's an honor oh lord it's a duty it's something that we have to realize and come into place oh Lord God to be a complete Church oh uh a complete Church Lord God and that we're all dependent upon each other oh Lord God uh to help each other oh Lord Jesus Christ Lord we ask that you help us oh Lord God help us to see where you've placed us oh Lord God help us to be uh diligent with what it is oh Lord Jesus Christ and Lord help us Lord to do it to glorify you oh Lord Jesus Christ help the church to realize oh Lord God that whatever they're dealing with oh Lord God you're not too far away oh Lord Jesus Christ you're not some Idol Oh Lord God you're not not some some entity that's far off in the distance oh Lord God lord we just saw we just heard your voice oh Lord come down into the church oh Lord God we set things in order oh Lord God and Lord we heard your voice oh Lord God now we want to feel your touch in the gifts of healing oh Lord by touching people oh Lord by the hands you said if we would lay hands on the sick Oh Lord God lord it's not the people's hands it's your hands oh Lord Jesus Christ that's healing the people oh Lord God oh Lord we want to see these gifts operating right in the correct place oh Lord God people have needs oh Lord Jesus Christ Lord sink it into the people's hearts oh Lord God that they don't have to fight on their own oh Lord God they don't have to they don't have to be at home uh struggling with mental depression oh Lord or or struggling with uh uh uh the worries oh Lord God of where they're going to get this money where they going to get rent or uh the economy or the election all these they don't have to worry about these struggles and these anxieties and and these Temptations and the trials and battles that they're going through oh Lord God they don't have to do it by themselves oh Lord God lord the reason why you have a bride oh Lord God is that you fight our battles for us oh Lord God all we have to do is just rest oh Lord God all we have to do is just trust the order of how you've done things oh Lord God Lord put into the people's hearts oh Lord God so that we all may receive from you in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen [Applause] Lord bless amen thank God for the word uh tonight appreciate our brother Quinton and um just the way the Lord has gifted him to present to us the word of God um I've been a part of the message for a number of years and um uh I want to say this the second time I think I've heard someone actually focused on that word helps in the uh book of Corinthians and and and people understanding that um God actually send helps to uh the church and and helps he he just went into so many many different areas like you know with the sound uh equipment with the um projection of the words um I I think about anytime there's a funeral and sisters getting together and uh uh uh getting the food and everything together whether if it's a fellowship you know uh and the way that that's coordinated all all that is it's it's it helps um when we just did the um the um the message believer choir there were things happening behind the scenes that a lot of people didn't even know was going on but it was the helps that was taking care of all of that and people that were gifted to be able to do those things it just makes um it makes the burden a little bit lighter but I tell you I um I I appreciate I appreciate uh the journey that the Lord has taken us through and and and and just wonderful one other thoughts he brought about the prophets um especially when it comes to 5old Ministry brother Brandon made it very very clear and I love the quote that he used uh a prophet is a is a modern-day preacher so um if a person is going to claim that they're part of fivefold minist as a prophet and and I I got to make it very clear that there are people that claim that position not that God actually put them in that position but they claim it and the reason that people claim it is because they feel that um if you're part of the fivefold ministry then you're kind of at this elevated level but in God's mind we all we all just doing what we supposed to do you know we're all a part of the same body and we're just doing what we're supposed to be doing right so uh but but when people claim that and and they they realize they cannot take the same position as brother Brandon cuz they know soon as you say something like that we done cut you off just like that ain't no way what you talking about you ain't got no Dove showing up at your your house when you born and you know no you ain't got come on no Vindication like that so so they won't say that they're on that level they won't claim to be like Moses or brother brandom or Jeremiah Isaiah but uh but they will claim that I'm a part of the fivefold ministry but you don't preach You Don't Preach so or or if you do try to preach and and actually before before a person even preach all you got to do is sit down and have a two to three minute conversation with them about the word and you can tell whether they got a anointing on them to preach or not preach amen you how they tie the word together tells you whether this is really a true anointing or not amen church so when you're trying to help people see their position uh maybe it's not five-fold Ministry profit however when we look at the gifts of the Spirit the nine spiritual gifts one of those nine spiritual gifts is the gift of Prophecy another thing that was said here tonight if you got some gift in your life and you cannot subject yourself to the leadership of a pastor something's wrong with your gift amen church if you if you if you got if you got I mean just beautiful I just never even heard it put that way even when you think about a pastor and just the way God um makes that person up in the way that he has to be able to handle certain things um you know in the church but not just the preaching but it's the things outside of the preaching you know he got to be able to handle it and uh but God has to give that anointing you know to the pastor to be able to do that and you know he was just saying how even that's the only Ministry of the fivefold ministry has got qualifications around it when you look at in the scripture uh so it's really it's really it's really really special I I'm I'mma get to this um announcements but he just said so much that just kind of got me going um I don't think I ever shared with y'all this testimony some of y'all may know it but most most ever most don't know it but before we started this church um I remember being invited to my uh cousin's Church uh a he's a retired Methodist uh Minister and he invited me to come to his church and and Minister and and um and I remember going and I think I ministered on you must be born again and when I got there to the church he had told me as soon as I I walked through the door he says well I didn't tell you this before you came but uh you got 30 minutes to deliver your sermon CU if you can't delivered in 30 minutes then um you ain't saying nothing that's what they told me you ain't saying nothing so I got up there and I did 30 minutes so uh with that training I give that to the brothers my training I give to the brothers I put them on a time limit amen brothers so uh I told watch it watch it watch it watch your your time because you got to know how to do that and uh so I went and I preached and after the service I was I went home um and I'm trying to think whether because he invited me back a sec actually his church invited me back the second time I didn't uh the first time I went and then I thought it was all done and he called me up and said my church want you to come back you I said your church want me to come back he said yeah yeah they asked you to come back on Mother's Day and I preached give it keep it keep it lose it and uh and when I when I came back um man I was just feeling just this weight on my shoulders and I and it was feeling like I maybe said something wrong uh and I couldn't figure out what it was that I said wrong and so I called him up and I said you you know I don't know if I said something wrong in your pull pit or not but I'm just I'm not feeling well I just got this weight on my shoulders and I think I just need to make something right and he said oh you're just a young preacher you ain't said nothing wrong you know you said exactly what the Lord wanted you to say you a you don't have to apologize to nothing I said well if I ain't say nothing wrong then I don't know what this weight is and as I just begin to pray and um you know process what this weight I mean I could feel it was literal weight on my shoulders I just I I could not understand and this was before the ministry started and what God showed me that weight that I was carrying was the weight of the people so before um this church even started God put the weight on my shoulder to be able to carry the weight of the people praise the Lord everybody don't have those experiences right everybody don't have those experien but God knows what he's doing and he prepares his man um for his work amen God is a good God God is a good god I thank God God bless you brother Quenton we we

for them also if you all would please um keep a young lady in prayer that came into my office today I've I've seen her a few times met her U our paths cross because I know her parents and um she came in the office maybe few months ago around the summertime and I and I spoke to her because I recognized her but I didn't say a lot cuz I was working so today she came in the office again she had come to a job fair that was at the Airport Hilton and she came into our records area because there was a um kind of a black ball restriction on her hiring being able to get back into the county and so she came to see if that had been lifted so in the process one of the guys was you know checking the records to see if it was lifted so when he came back he said you know yeah it's lifted so she just went out into a hallelujah praise right there in the office and um so as she as she finished I said you know you you she said I I I just been praying she said I've been crying out to the Lord I was just praying that this would be lifted I'm just so happy I said God had already answered your prayer when you were praying because that had been lifted from the last time she came in the office it had already been lifted but she didn't know it and so I said it already been lifted so she and I just started talking and she was sharing some personal things that she was going through and I really was able to make a real um spiritual connection with her and she said where where where do you go to church I need you to pray for me pray for me and I said I will and so I'm at work at the front office and the front desk so and I said I would and so she said well where did you go to church church and I told her and she said well what time is um Sunday school and and and you have prayer Mee and different services so I told her yes so she has a 17year old son and um she's planning to be in service on Sunday and I just really believe that God is leading her to this ministry I think it's more than just her praying for that job to be lifted I really believe God is dealing with her and bringing her to this ministry all right praise the Lord amen we'll certainly remember in prayer sister Cobb had her hand up God bless you um I just want to thank God for traveling mercies going over to uh visit my granddaughter and having a um really blessed time and also I thank God for um a favorable uh medical report that I received thank you amen praise the Lord amen God bless you bless you I want to house prayer for a young lady that call out my job today and then she was telling me how her husband killed her six six years old boy and then he also killed him himself and then she was crying and then she was like she was there desperate and that happened 6 months ago and then I told her that I was going to pray for her and then I feel a desire that I need to call her but I don't want that to like give me a problem with my job because I'm not supposed to take number and then call people but I feel like a burden that I need like to call her and then pray she said like sometimes I just call friends to pray with me because I I just can't believe what my husband did and then it's so hard for her because she had to change her name she don't want to like carry like like her husband name so we will keep her in prayer thank you yeah okay well certainly remember her in prayer any other uh requests okay all right um my man I tell you we all I can say is we need God we we need more God you you just never know um the pressure that people going through and they don't know where to go to to let off the pressure um but that's that's that's rough um for a mother to have to deal with that let's uh let's let's let's let's pray for these uh different requests father we are grateful that we can come to you we um sometimes we hear these uh different needs that and people from all walks of life and that they go through and Lord they just that they don't know where to turn but uh if they could only turn to you Jesus they would find the peace and the hope and um the satisfaction that they need at all lives in in Christ um and we we know that you have us in certain places at certain times in order to be able to hear um these uh uh these needs and then we can do something about it as as Kings and Priests we can stand uh in the Gap Lord we just pray that uh you would just intervene somehow and bring confidence strength Lord there's a family that has uh lost a loved one there in Sister Virginia's family and and the family didn't even know that he was gone uh hidden but now revealed and so many are dealing with the the the Lord just everything that goes along with this dealing with this grief and not even having closure and and all of that but we just pray that you give them peace that you would um Lord just minister to their needs uh even uh during this great time and father I pray that the spirit of forgiveness would come uh into that family and that God they would just somehow be able to just sort through uh all that occurred and also want to remember this young lady that call sister Melissa and Lord open up a door I know sister Melissa doesn't want to jeopardize her job but father I believe you can even have that lady uh call back and get sister Melissa and and Lord somehow how they can uh share information to be able to talk offline and uh because we're real people and uh people have real needs and Lord she carries that burden so I just pray that you you open up that door but bring Comfort to her she lost both a child and a husband and and Lord just maybe God just I just pray that You' give her give her her strength Lord to endure uh this this great trial father uh this lady that got the band lifted uh for her to be able to work again but there was even something greater than that uh sister Virginia being there to be able to share with her and and her begin to ask questions about church and Sunday school and uh I pray father that you would just lead them right where you want them and father that the word would be quickened uh to them again not by accident not by chance that she would run into her and have that that conversation with her through the day so we pray that the the seed that is already uh been uh watered may be quickened and father May uh May Life come out of this this circumstance thank you for the beautiful report that you gave sister cob and uh Lord a favorable report and uh we we know you to be a Healer and you continue to prove yourself over and over again thank you for giving our traveling mercies and all our other Saints also that traveled father over the weekend thank you for allowing them to come back uh safe L here and I just trust God that as we leave this place this evening we'll go meditating and thinking on the word thank you for truth that you give us father for the scripture tells us that we'll know the truth and the truth will make us free we don't have to walk in confusion and uh uh Lord just just uncertain unsure but God we can know exactly where we stand according to the scripture and when we know where we stand we can help other people find where they should be standing so uh we just thank you Father for this word that has been brought to us tonight and uh just appreciate Lord this journey that you even gave us through the the gifts that are in uh the church and in the body of Christ and we help us all to find our place and uh as we find it not not just be satisfied but realize that you placed certain things in us before we were even born you knew us and
