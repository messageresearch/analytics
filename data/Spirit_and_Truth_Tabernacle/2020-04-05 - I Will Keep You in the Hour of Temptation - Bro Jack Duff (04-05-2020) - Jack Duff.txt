miracle worker it's mighty God we man and I got a praise report in between services today and just wanted to mention to the church brother Jeff banks sister Shirelles brother he had they went to checked himself in the hospital I want to say probably about two weeks ago he was kind of feeling shortness of breath and and he has a number of other things that he's dealing with in his body and he was kind of you know feeling the shortest of breath so he checked me to the hospital just you know wanted to be sure that he didn't contract this virus and and I was calling them throughout the week and you said no they ran tests but then gave me the results yet you know say well just it's good that you were there and I haven't having to be home he say yeah thank God for my free apartment one-bedroom apartment here at the hospital let's say well praise the Lord for this that's the way to look at it you know and so we talked again on yesterday they say a pastor Jack they came and did some more tests they didn't give me results from the original tests but they came in to some more tests they did some you know a swab in both nostrils I said well brother we're just gonna believe God there's gonna come back negative and he sent me in Texas say yeah the attacks they say the tests came back negative such a brother Jeff you say the tests came back negative I'm waiting on the MRI and say that the Lord willing I get to go home today or tomorrow so I'd rather be released from the hospital and they said God is good pastor Jack he's been good to me and my in the time of need so we just thank the Lord for watching over my brother and then touching him you can be seated just for a moment just want to just make a couple of announcements as you can see just doing a few things a little different and for those of you that want to give we're gonna use the box there on the table amen you can use that on your way out a man as well as as we're doing service like this just until further notice if you want to give on your way and you can do that too just put it in the box and and you know we'll handle things accordingly if you get want to give online our church website is Spirit of Truth Tabernacle org you can click on the home menu and then donations underneath that and there's instructions on how to give if you have our church app you can also give from our church app there's a little button there so we just want to invite you to do that now I got so much to be thankful for that is it's hard not to give them priest and man it's hard not to give them praise and one of the things that I'm grateful for is you know our church before this virus hit and you know we were just believing God for some things and and I used to I don't know I think I told y'all before how we used to be about three weeks late always getting out our rent you know to the two landlord but you know we were always made it every month but it was just three weeks late but pretty much at the beginning of this year we've been hitting my rent the first of the month and even in the midst of this God still allowed us to be able to pay our rent the verse of the money raised long now what that told me is that God not only making a way for the church but that even God making away for his people to make in the midst of all this that we've gone through so III just like I said this too much - too much that he's doing that I just can't you know stop praising them and I didn't want to mention you know we had started and I'm not I'm all just mentioning this I'm not gonna be pulling but before the virus epidemic and all this we've made an announcement that we wanted to get up get a new keyboard for the church amen and keep working on cost us a pretty good amount of money it's gonna be about twenty five hundred dollars now I'm saying this because I already see us coming back together worship in the way we're used to worship I already see that I'm getting ready for that right this this this right here is temporary what we're doing right now temporary and so I'm an expectation for the UH you know for all for all of us people to come back together and I'm not letting this expectation for that I'm expectation for a new church and the school that I still got that on my prayer list I'm believing God ain't man and so we are we put that out and just asking everyone that if you want to donate towards it we actually will and one of the precious sisters got just made some envelopes for us and and I was very grateful and I just put these out you'll see them on the table these are envelopes and it's just for any special projects a lot cheaper to use these envelopes for those things and use the the tithe envelopes a tithe and offering envelope so this is a you know if you see that out there on the table just to project that's what it's for just trying to explain that to everyone so that's for like the piano and there's some you know there's some other things gonna be birth out of this experience we're already looking at having to upgrade our sound equipment on but video equipment some things that we want to do there and so I just believe God got everything under control if you want to donate to those projects God give us some extra you can give a little extra a man a man I know he tried to save everything we can't because we don't know when we're gonna run out of toilet paper freezes look that's just a joke but God is good in any way amen but if you desire Amen we want to just give that to you also I wanted to just give a update on our Building Fund and and then just one other thing thank you so much I appreciate you so much we got the best musicians in the message and I think for them just just appreciate everybody just first of the month we always try to do this give you an update so our goal is again for the years 105,000 for the year we are in our third year of pledges and this the pledged amount for this year has been sixty thousand nine dollars is what's pledged and what has been received thus far this year has been nine thousand eight hundred ninety two dollars and fourteen cents a man best on the on the 60 thousand that was pledged we've already received nine thousand eight hundred ninety two dollars and fourteen cent and since we received that we put it in the bank and gain some interest so we've gained our money two hundred and fifty eight dollars ninety seven seven entries which gives us a grand total thus far for this year ten thousand one hundred fifty one dollars and eleven steps praise God even in the midst of the virus these numbers are still growing God is just doing so much that I can't help my threesome a man so we thank the Lord for that and now just another quick thing that I wanted to share a man is uh this thank-you card I was I was given a call and I wanted to also just mention this if if there's any needs here in the church or anything like that just keep us where one one particular person that told me about he was given trying to give some food to some people in the neighborhood some people that that were maybe in their 90's and couldn't get out and go shop and they need it they needed things so I remember the need as we told it to me and then I am I was somebody called me and say hey we got all this you know they come from Christ fellowship say we got all this extra these bags of groceries that we given out and we're just trying to find churches that we can give it to and I said well yeah I'll take so many bags because I remember the one need and when it got got the got the bags we gave it and then you know they gave it and and as he was talking there's one particular lady she said what church is this like well my pastor got it from a mother church it's not our church but he got it from another state well what church you go to well I go to this church he'd go to courage to say okay took the card and she sent us a little note in the mail and now this this particular lady for my understanding she was she's an Olympian she's an Olympian she ran in Olympics years ago and and she lives right here and I'm a woman and just a little bag of grocery with some toilet paper just saying it uh it went a long way and she say pray that God will continue to bless you all in all your endeavors in sharing and caring blessings her name is Lucinda Adams and says to pass it up in the Spirit of Truth Tabernacle members please accept my sincere thank you for sharing the food bag from my neighbor of Linda Street in Cyprus links so you just never know who you're touching when you do things like this and and we're glad that we're able to do something to help her and you know so we uh if anybody else if there's different needs I am getting texts and emails and past if you need anything just let us know actually one of the local restaurants that I visit frequently they text me I mean they email and say pastor if you need anything for your congregation let me know right so you know I just if knees and they please let them be knees and maybe might not be your knees but if it's somebody else that you know that needs just just get in touch with us and and we'll do all we can to try to help with that so God is good and God is good as you can see this is our second service today we had a service early and brother quick who actually spoke for us and did a wonderful job we were very very very happy with that and he was actually prepared to speak again to the twelve o'clock service and I'd say well not you know it's up to you if you want if you want to do it I do have a message prepared you say know if you got something prepared you go ahead and speak that way everybody get a different voice because they already got the first service recorded so now to get something you know different and I say well we'll figure this out as we go along you know cuz I could do the the megachurch model and what the megachurch model is is preached the same sermon in each service right but there's one big difference a man in the megachurch model and what we have going on here the service is never the same I mean even from the what I mean brother Solomon brought us some song this morning and man I was just enjoying that and worshiping he was Jesus is a mighty God coronavirus bow before him he is a mighty God man we was worshiping then brother Troy come out here and my god just totally different you know it got this thing about the blood he could have just kept going from one Bluffs on to the next blood side and sound of like the house was packed man we were worsening feeling the presence of Lord I said you can't feel this a man on periscope it's a difference when we come into the house of God that's why I think David when he spoke these words he said I was glad when they said unto me let's go into the house of the Lord not see that hole I got to go into the house of the Lord I can't wait for them a lift or restrictions [Applause] 6560 they can go into the house let alone and you talk about some six year olds and seven year olds have it's something about when Saints get together things begin to happen tell them brothers see when I say that this is why we got to have a church you feel that man it's a totally different totally different feeling when we come here together amen so we just thank God and and we're very grateful for everybody just you know just Biden by the protocols and things that we put in place we're doing the best we can to give Caesar what is Caesar's and also give God what is God's we must have a balance in that Jesus spoke both things and we must as believers have a balance so you know we want to you know it's sometimes we do things is to bring protection to those around us you know and and everybody's faith is at different levels that's okay I'm not I'm not gonna put this person down because they faith not in the same level as my faith right if somebody want to come in here with a mass that's fine at least they hear right Amen someone say but but we have protocols we have you know that the seating you know that we're doing trying to six six six six six six feet separation so we're doing that washing our hands you know anything else that we need to do we want to do and I think there's nothing wrong with those things that's to me to me it is not a lack of faith because you do that it is not actually it's sanitary they man right it's sanitary so I mean and you know this praise the Lord I think man you know there's probably a good time good time for people you're doing this is I'm it's to me I'm I'm I'm surprised they have to actually announce for people to wash their hands you know some people go certain places if you get what I'm saying and they don't wash their hands so I'm glad they keeping it before wash your hands it's sanitary hey man praise the Lord glory to God amen so so we want to do those things and we just appreciate everybody working with us in that and and we'll continue to just kind of function like this as we go along next week is Easter I do want to say thank God for the governor that has taken a stand to allow churches he deemed Church as essential and and see the way I look at that is if go on the Walmart or Publix a man in the grocery store is he central people got to get food natural food Church also is where we get food spiritual food right and and it's essential so I thank God I know he's gonna take a lot of backlash for his decision but we pray that God would give him strength he also understanding he has a newborn he has a newborn baby that uh you know and and he's in public eye and everything too so a lot and not only him but there's so many on the front line we even have people in our church that are on the front line we want to remember them in prayer remember uh since the tinier assist Elise you know different ones that even in our area I remember another assistant brother James Church she works at the hospital there we were there she was there when we were there visiting sister vernest family so we have saints that are in these in these frontline positions we want to remember them in prayer we got a request from sister real on this morning to pray over a friend of hers that was in New York nests on the front line she contracted the virus she worked in the virus is spread in her house or children have it her mom has it and so we want to remember them and prayer that God would just deliver them and we want to remember our own and prayer that God would keep them in this time so we just take the look for all things and I think that's all I need to share for right now oh if with Easter coming up we we need if you know somebody that might get in touch with I want to go to church and or you've invited somebody to come to church we just need you just please keep us informed try not to surprise us like Sunday morning if you know ahead of time please let us know because we are trying to plan things appropriately so we stay within the guidelines that have been given to us one of the main things that the president I mean the governor said is that following CDC's guidelines for separation that that's what he's saying all right that was a Keith Keith statement for following CDC's guidelines for separation so we don't want to pile 200 people in here we don't want to do that hey man not now there is a time we gonna be able to do that but now we don't want to do that and that's not because we're free that's because CDC recommended it a man and the governor is trying to find a balance or a mix here and we're trying to work with them amen all right so if that's the situation we want to we just if you know somebody that might be coming please let us know well in advance so we can just kind of get people shifted around accordingly and let them know as they come that we are following some guidelines and so don't get upset with us when we do certain things what we found out from the Prophet is that if a person get upset when the deacon Aksum do certain things for the brand i'm saying that that person that gets upset got the wrong spirit I just read that a couple weeks ago amen and and and in in Bible study praise the Lord so we don't want to have the wrong spirit a man all right oh I took some air at the room with that cool but let's pray we're gonna pray and then actually I tell you what let me read a couple scriptures were prayed for some of these frontline people pray for this lady in New York and just pray over the Word of God here today let's let's read from revelation 3 verse 8 through 10 and then also we read from James 1 and 12 also I wanted to say praise Luria's system - no was baptized last week in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen we thank God for taking that step and her in her in her life and you know brother Jer was sharing a testimony of this adulterous mama was getting her clothes ready for school and as the seduction of walked in and said mama I don't want to wear that say what you need this wasn't mama I'm a Christian now I don't wet I don't want to wear them pants I need a skirt mama God doing something in her heart and we have been praying and asking God for a revival to start in the youth and and I believe God is doing some things so I certainly appreciate what I see the Lord doing amen and her revelation 3 verse 8 says I know thy works the whole I have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it but thou hast a little strength and has kept my word and has not denied my name the whole I will make them of the synagogue of Satan which say they are Jews and are not but do lie the whole I will make them to come and worship before thy feet and to know that I have loved thee because thou has kept the word of my patience I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation which shall come upon all the world ain't that something it is scriptures say this our temptation is going to upon all of the world right to try them that dwell upon the earth amen let's just look at another verse over in James chapter 1 praise the Lord and I just want to read verse 12 here James chapter 1 blessed is the man that endureth temptation for when he is tried he shall receive the crown of life which the LORD hath promised to them that love him a man praise God the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word let's just breathe the word of Prayer dear God we thank you for the privilege to read your word we know it takes the Holy Spirit to bring the Word of Life and help us to apply what we hear even present-tense God we thank you for being able to gather here thank you for a governor that has gone out on a limb to allow for gatherers like this and God we're certainly not we appreciate it and we want to take advantage of what has been given to us thank you for the Saints that are working with us Lord through this time and we just pray that you continue to keep each one safe Lord that this you said the plague would not come nigh our dwelling you promised to stand according to Psalms 91 and God we are believing what you said and God we just pray that you just continue to keep keep each one we want to especially pray for those that on the front line dealing with the public I know sister Tanya and sister Liz sister sandy Lord and there might be so many others since the docile in many God that are on the front line dealing with the public throughout this time and they're just going in doing their jobs we pray your divine protection over each one we don't we bind any symptom God and and now Lord they tell us that sometimes you could be perfectly healthy not even not even have any symptoms but yet have the virus and Lord as we heard from brother quick who this morning that is a demonic spirit that's going on attacking people and God we're binding that demon from attacking any of your people that you would just keep your heads of protection around each one and Lord did this family there in New York that has requested prayer we acts it - it just touch them you did it for brother Jeff you can do it for them God and reverse Lord every every symptom Lord that has come against them and may they be brought back to perfect health Lord God giving you glory and giving you out and giving you praise in the midst of it bless us now as we turn our hearts towards your word be glorified and magnified in this place it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you can receive praise the Lord amen so I want to just take for our subject I will keep you thank you so much I will keep you from the hour of temptation Amen I will keep you from the hour of temptation just let's start out here with a quote from the original church age amen brother Branham preached this in 1960 and the Philadelphian Church age is is what I want to refer to a man it says now this great temptation the hour of temptation shall come to try the whole world goes into the tribulation a man praise the Lord this hour of temptation has come to try the whole world a man goes into tribulation just in a few minutes we'll see it goes on into the tribulation and the tribulation did not come in the days of Wesley so what age are we in what's this Dorset before it's between the Wesley where the church is headed right now and already in to the land of C&H but this little place right in here within the last 35 40 years has been an open door setting right before the people to come in and God will take the remnant and seal it off amen I like that agar gonna take the rim and steal it off we would preach in a couple weeks ago about no killing until a sealing right no killing into the ceiling and it was for those that were silent crying for the abominations in the city the ink corn rod I was taking his rye and and he was sealing those in before before the the other riders would come and destroy he was syllables brother branham said that happened on the day of Pentecost right before Titus came in and destroyed the the Roman I mean he was a Roman generally come in and destroyed Jerusalem but before he destroyed there was a sealing took place at Pentecost glory to God but the promise of Pentecost was not only for that time that promise is something that extends even all the way down to today amen Joel said I'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh hallelujah in the last days I'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh and and and this so this is something that we should be looking for I see all of hell breaking loose but I'm looking for all of heaven amen glory to God I'm I'm the expectation for all of heaven so now the Prophet goes on it says this says upsetting right before the people to come in and God will take the remnant and seal it off and they'll go into a lukewarm and he'll spurt them out of his mouth the work will be the work will be cut short up goes the church and here comes the Antichrist moving in for destruction oh my I want to make sure the church is settled on some of these things because you know as we see things kind of shaping up even right now we know that the purpose I should say the Accord in description according to prophecy we know what role the Catholic Church plays a man we know a man that are they haven't they have a lot to fulfill according to the book of Revelation and also here with like I mentioned before with everything kind of striking Italy a man I mean they had more deaths in Italy than anywhere else in the world it was a perfect center right for the Antichrist to take a ride hallelujah but before we see these things according to this quote the Prophet said up ghost's the church a man goes to church so even I'm not looking for them to crown the Pope and make him something greater than what he is amen I not looking for a man all these churches to kind of come back together which they've already done and submit themselves to the Catholic Church leadership I'm not looking for crap to prosper according to the scripture once the Pope gets involved in economy hallelujah I'm not looking for that but what I am looking for us goes to church glory to God you can be in your house treatment but uh goes to church hallelujah we want to be ready for the time is at hand he says up goes to church and here comes the Antichrist moving in for destruction just perfect fits with the whole Bible right on around now it goes on and makes a couple statements I just want to keep reading here says all right now and here's the appearing of the sleeping virgin also here proves that the last of the church changes moves to the first part of Pentecost look at that here proves that the last of the church changes moves to the first part of Pentecost so we ought to be looking for Pentecostal blessings in our myths amen the last of the church ages moves to the first to the first part of Pentecost for they go on into the great tribulation which shall come which did not come in the Wesley age insanity 11th verse all right a crown of life the eleventh verse said behold I come quickly what quickly after this now see behold I thought I hope fast to that which thou hast keep on to it that no man take away thy crown glory to God that no man take away thy crown now he's actually he's uh referring to revelation 3 verse 11 behold I come quickly hold that fast which thou hast that no man take away thy crown now look at what it says what is a crown what is a crown it's a crown means that you have a domain Oh glory to God Amen a crown means that you have a domain do you know God gave the earth to us this man's domain amen crown means that we have a domain he said he says and we are sons of God it says you're your king in your crown and we are sons of God when we're crowned with eternal life and our domain is the earth make you priests and kings unto God is the right seed there you are don't let no man take away your crown do you realize that the word Coronas means crown hallelujah amen and and through prayer we're gonna have to fight this coronavirus that's why I was up this morning while I was praying and the Lord just kind of dropped that that scripted down in my spirit you know because people my tax you well why do you go to church why do you do this why did you that say well and I'm glad that the governor made it essential because when I look at the scripture the Bible say if my people now look the doctors don't have an answer the test kits really don't work it's a lot of stuff that's wrong with this nobody has an answer but the bible does have the answer and they say if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray seek my face turn from their wicked ways then will I hear from heaven not only that God said he would heal the land God said that if we're looking for cute let's get got involved and rather than come against the church supporting the church with your prayers stand toe-to-toe with me stand side-by-side with the church with your prayers Amen let's pray this thing not only I live but the entire world hallelujah let no man take our crown glory to God glory to God amen look at this now I want to just read a little bit here from the message the contest the Prophet makes a statement and he's referring back to Ephesians chapter 4 glory glory glory glory glory let me let me read that so that we we understand what he's saying here actress not it's defeatist chapter six oh let's read this Ephesians six and he makes uh let's start at verse ten it's gonna make some comments but I want to just read this finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armor of God and I see they want us to put on all these other little things but I want to encourage you as a church put on the whole armor of God amen that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil these are tricks from the enemy any disease it's coming from the devil right amen you might be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rules of darkness of this of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places even when the whole world is on lockdown you have political leads are still trying to push different agendas they trying to take advantage of the people in a time like this we bind that spirit in the name of Jesus amen we're not gonna be taking advantage of glory to God since I went for takin to you the whole arm of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins Girt about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all states and for me that which may be given to me that I may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel for which I am a ambassador in bonds that therein I may speak boldly as I ought to speak praise the Lord so brother Branham in this quote is written he's read the scripture now he's making a mint a few comments let's look at this in the message the contest it says if I should speak the context that I wrote down that I was going to start on this afternoon we'd be here at 5 o'clock in the morning someone says that'll be alright and says but I but I want to just read a word thank you from from Ephesians 2:6 chapter 12 verses and just for a few moments topic for courage for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places spiritual spiritual wickedness in high places I'd like to draw from that a little ten of 15-minute context it says rather I want to call it the contest he said a contest is a test of strength and where we have a test strip we used to have the Indian used to put a fire and they would put so many men on this end of the rope and so many men on this end the tug of war the contest of strength would pull the losing party across the fire and now we know there's many things and we can base this upon for a few minutes of contest but I want to speak for these minutes amen quickly upon the greatest contest there is that's between the church and sing that that great strength of satan and we can not and we want to speak of the great strength of God in his church I was making a comment earlier I said you know the Bible actually tells us we had to cancel our plans which probably going to Londyn amen on this week but had to cancel all of our plans because it is now the script rax it tells us to go into all the world and to preach the gospel in order for us to be able to fulfill that scripture coronavirus has to let up off the entire world hallelujah amen we can't be limited as to where we can go where we can't go God gave us a commandment and in order for that commandment to be fulfilled he has to bring a peace into the entire world I believe God's gonna do that I believe God's gonna do that Hollywood and he's not doing it Amen for any other reason just to see his word actually for feel amen glory to God look at this he goes on and says I'll cuz we're the contest churches I said it's Satan trying to test his power and I can I can guarantee you a man the power Satan is not more powerful than the powerful power of God he's not stronger than God he came with stangard amen glory to God he says we want to speak on the great strength of God in his church now this great contest has been going on for many years it started in heaven and Satan was kicked out into the earth and then become an enemy to God's people and since then he's used all of his strength and his strategy to try to pull God's people across the fires or into his fights this has been the devil's amen objective since and we know that who has the most power God does and God when he gained his people the best thing that he can that he could to combat Satan with was his words the best thing we can use to combat the devil is with us where every time you feel a symptom you know they say when you get a little scratchy voice write anything you know you sneeze and now you know your brain actually tells you to sneeze your brain it's a normal function of the brain - you know you got to speak let it loose knees now unfortunately we've got a hat sneezes we got we you know we got to be careful soon I mean I was on a little video card some guys yesterday and at the end of the car like off gas a jack all this way love my friend I mean basic body functions amen I'm gonna still be able to do and not be classified sick no I'm not sick my body's responding to the dust that's in the atmosphere praise God I will not claim that sickness disease man Church glory to God he says my where we know who has the most power God does and God when He gave His people the best thing that he could to combat Satan with was with his word so use the word of God to fight every symptom was this worth now because the word of god because the word is god and who's stronger than god so the word is God and the word becomes our strength I like these words amen the word is God who's stronger than God so the word is God and the word becomes our strength God in the church becomes its strength to pull Satan into his own fires that he is made we're not coming into the fight a man will put a devil into his own fire that he's mean and the tug goes on now jesus said in mark 16 in my name they shall cast out devils and that's what exactly what we're expecting to do now let me read another little statement here from the message is this the sign of the answer amen we are talking about God keeping you in the hour of temptation amen he promised it I believe he will no weapon formed against you gonna prosper every tongue that rises against you will be condemned a man I'm trusting God all the way through here this message is this a sign of the answer now he makes this statement glory to God I love it that message that I just read from the contest was preached after is this the sign of answer he preached these two sermons right at the end of 1962 going into 63 and he comes in with the contest and then I'm sorry yeah a contest was preached after then right before he preached that he preaches is this the sign of the answering and there were some visions and dreams that he brought forth and that is this assignment in and then 1963 became a year where God manifested something so tremendous with the seven angels coming from eternity meeting brother Branham in Arizona and taking a picture you know with the Prophet there while he was out there I mean they they took the picture in the sky and the prop was out there and God gave him instruction and go back into Jeffersonville and preach on the seven seals which were in the book of Revelation and he brought us that a man he brought us that so very significant moments in his ministry and and where we're feeding on these things here in 1962 is this a sign of the unserved he makes this statement says we all know that we're living in a glorious time for the church hallelujah don't look like it but we are we're living in a glorious time for the church but a horrible time for the unbeliever and we're living and one of the most dangerous times of all all that ever was since the world began no prophet nor apostille never in no time ever lived in such a time as we live now can you imagine that who we gonna depend on who we go to to get instruction a man and and pull from they experience we go to God a man we go to God because nobody's ever lived in a time like this before nobody's ever faced things like this before hallelujah amen but with God all things are possible he says look at that it says this is the end glory to God it's written in the skies it's written over the face of the earth it's written in every newspaper this is the end if you can if you can read the handwriting the Prophet the prophets lived in a time when the handwriting was on the wall for a nation glory to God they live in a time a man when the hand right was on the wall for just one nation a nation but we're living when the handwriting is on the wall for a time all nations earth everything time is at the end so we must search the scriptures the final hour that we're living I was I was blessed when I read that you know because there's never been a time where the whole world like this has been shut down a man you know that they're fair States they've had our different flus and everything that's kind of hit in different places and but but the way that the whole world has been on a lockdown nobody's ever faced nothing like this I was talking to brother Guinta just the other day and say you know we have limits as to how many PT stay here in the UK we have a limit only two people can meet together to - now you know what we what we need to do is thank God that it's not that bad for us right but I say only two can meet together now now that just makes it really really difficult for anybody to get anything done but the whole world is on a lockdown we've never had it like this before we're facing things but you know with this kind of pressure my expectation I'm deadly lord if if this is if this is the time for you to come get your prize and I want to be ready to go hey man I don't want to be playing no games I want to make sure that my my lamp is trimmed I got some extra oil right I want to be ready if this is the and if this is the bridegroom call I want to be ready to go glory to God hallelujah now we're living in a very dangerous time but when we get to these moments like this and you know I've just kind of went back and just thinking on my mind in my mind just just different different ones that went through in Scripture and how God kept them in the hour of temptation hallelujah glory to God if God kept them I want to tell you that that God is going to keep you glory to God when the Hebrew boys were facing their hour of temptation now I want you to try to understand that when the Hebrew boys was going through a temptation it was the government that was actually bringing the pressure on to these boys amen it was it was it was a Nebuchadnezzar who's the King representing the government he said now if you're not willing to bow down amen when we play the music when we do this when we do that everybody else has bow down we just want y'all to do what everybody else is doing and you know and they said when we do that we don't play the music we got to give you a chance bow down and just you know everything gonna be alright when those boys refuse to bow down glory to God those boys say look if I'm caught don't deliver us amen what we want to be written in the record books is that we said I got is able to deliver us that's what we believe but if he chooses not to deliver we still won't bow to your image hallelujah they have a determination and in that hour Amen God did a mighty thing for the Hebrew boys God kept them in their hour of temptation that our weather had pressured about God kept them not only did he keep them but he met them in the hour of their temptation glory God when they when they put the stuff to fire seven times hotter glory hallelujah they put the fire seven times hotter but yet the evil says you can hide you can heat it up as much as you want we still not go amen we know it still worship and praise our God we're not bound to this image that you're presenting to us halleluja decided not to Baron God decided Amen I'm a step in God himself left his throne in glory he did not send an angel but God came himself and I'm gonna tell you I've never seen my god defeated if God is fighting for me I will not be defeated I will keep you in the hour of temptation hallelujah Daniel also as a decree that came from the leader of that day Darius I believe it was and Daniel was fighting against the government glory to God here Daniel a man was was told that if he prayed to any other gods a man outside the one that they was establishing he was gonna have to go into this line Stan well they are sought to eat it written and Daniel say you know what I made a commitment that I'm gonna keep praying to my god it even in the midst of this eating I'm still gonna keep praying and Daniel went down on his knees and you know where Daniel was when he was praying day was in his house they wouldn't even have Church Daniel was out of his own house now you know they don't cook your rights away when they're coming into your house come on when they come in actually into your house and telling you you can't pray in your own house hallelujah but they said I don't care what they say I keep praying to my god and when they come and they they calm down you're praying and then here they bring them before Darius Adair so I shouldn't ever sign an order like that I never should have put my name on nothing like that but but there say you know what I got confidence that your God is gonna deliver you dang it don't you worry about it God going to live then you just begin to aim it except that he whittle into the Weinstein hallelujah and we need God in there oh I'm so glad to know that God came himself in the middle of the limitation home I believe that sirs I believe that a man I believe that John was in our temptation glory to God when they sent him to they banished him amen but before they banished him they put John and oil and trying to board a Holy Ghost side of him for 24 hours they realized that the oil was doing nothing the boiler was doing nothing a man - John and they had to just take him out and just banished him to the Isle they sent him over there and Demi wrote the entire book of Revelation you thought it was a Amen you thought you were actually doing something negative to John but you actually blessed not only child but everybody else they would come and read the book of Revelation it's a blessing just to read it hallelujah and churches today afraid to preach from it but it's a blessing just to read it glory to God God kept John in his hour of temptation Peter was escorted to jail glory to God because of him preaching the gospel of Christ and when Peter was escorted out of drede jail by an angel amen it showed that God was keeping even Peter in his hour of temptation God gonna keep us in our hour of temptation amen these examples that I gave you either political or a religious attack against the believers it's either political or religious attack against the believers I was just saying a man it seemed like the only stories that make it to the news is when church gathers they never say no about somebody passing out of Walmart that one little sis was in Walmart a few weeks ago lady passed out right down the flow you know what people did he got our gaap from around huh that's what most of them did got right from around right they didn't know they just we don't know what we don't know what to do with this I mean you know and and and and you're gonna have a lot of that people just don't know what to do now nobody reported it nobody said nothing what happened to that lady what she tested was it why did she pass out like that right nobody said nothin hallelujah but you let something break out here in this church here to be on the news as soon as you know it hallelujah and some of the things I was listening to you know and III think there has to be a balance here I don't think we should have 500 people gathering I don't think we should have 200 people gather now I think we should keep our numbers limited right amen I think we should do the social distance I I agree with all of that glory to God but but you know I mean here you you got you got some people that's just kind of going over and beyond what they really allowing you to do now I think I think that part is wrong I think we got to find a balance see and we can work together glory to God right but uh but you know but what I find is that the things that are highlighted is the things that happen in the church amen that's that's what people want to promote that that that is a there's an attack that's coming Church is not like going to a baseball game Church is not like going a man to a hockey game Church is not like going to some concert I mean churches is where we come in contact with God amen and we get the spiritual food that we need glory to God we get the encouragement that we need things that we might not have been thinking about but we can hear promised in the Word of God and it gets on mind self I remember the brother that uh that one dose stopped working on Sundays and he didn't know how to get off and the pastor saying that actually boss do we like people that work for him that don't steal so the active movie like people that that that's gonna be faithful to come to work on time and actually action boss what kind of man would he like working for him say well you know he's he's because he said cameraman you are you ain't stealing from him you ain't doing an issue in doing that you cheatin so you're doing everything right if he liked that he'd say the only way to keep you like that he better let you go to church hallelujah because it's something instant as you hear the word of God it is forming you and shaping you are making you into the person that you're supposed to be glory to God this is a hour of trial a man this is an hour we the greatest our trial that we will face or have faces but I but I believe God is going to keep us in the hour of temptation now look at this I want to read a couple other things here this is coming out of the six fold purpose of Gabe's visit visit to Daniel brother Branham makes a statement glory glory glory says now we're going to read a portion of the scripture I want you to listen you that don't have your Bible you don't have your Bible get Genesis first let's start in the 44th chapter beginning with the 27th verse is Joseph and Joseph was a perfect type of Christ we know that how many knows that hated of his brothers why because he was spiritual he was he saw visions interpret dreams he was a spiritual man among his brethren and they hated him and his father loved him so was Jesus hated of the denominational churches but loved of his father God why did they hate him because he was spiritual glory to God now i'ma tell you they gonna hate us too and it's not yes it is because we spiritual the reason that we are spirituals because we got spiritual insight glory to God we're not shook by nothing that's going on I mean when I see the economy falling apart I know a prophet said it's gonna go to a gold standard a prophet already told me that right they they don't want to touch your cash hey man they don't want to touch your cash you might have the virus they don't want to touch the cash and if you ain't got it in plastic that you got you got a problem on your hand you already got but-but-but-but here here profit I already told it's gonna go to the gold standard so you just watching things shaping up and Rome already has to go so you're just watching everything's shaping up Oh My lordy got I know I know it's a lot dying in Italy but everybody ain't gonna die I can tell you that right now I don't care how great the numbers rise everybody ain't dying there hallelujah amen there's some prophecy left for that part a man saw somebody coming forth from Italy all right hey man glory to God hallelujah amen so so you know don't don't get caught up on artists what we wanted to cut up is what did that prophet say we want to know what did he say to us amen now watch this he says Joseph was a perfect type of Christ we know that how many knows that hate of his brothers because he was spiritual he saw visions interpret dreams he was a spiritual man among his brethren and they hated him his father loved him so was Jesus hated up the denominational churches but loved at his father God why did they hate him because he was spiritual not look at this it says they talked they said he was a fortune-teller a devil you remember what Joseph's brother said to him here comes that dream see same thing and they sold Joseph for almost the same price that Judas sold Jesus for thirty pieces of silver this throwed him into a ditch went and told their father that something that killed him he was dead but he was taken up from the ditch Christ was thrown into a ditch and was taken up and from there he went to the highest place there was on earth a man Joseph went to the right hand of Pharaoh and Jesus went to the right hand of God in his temptation before his exaltation Jesus before he was exalted went through temptations now and what I'm trying to get you all to see is that before we are exalted before we actually go up we're gonna have to go through a temptation now I'm gonna just take my time and read this because I want to make sure we understand what we yeah glory to God this is a scripture it's being fulfilled and I want you all to remember when Jesus Christ was going to the cross there was more scriptures fulfilled in the last few hours of his life amen then then what was fulfilled in all the days that he was living so so here as we're getting ready to approach the rapture there might be more things fulfilled in a very short amount of time hallelujah stay spiritual church whatever you do stay spirits in the south in his temptation before his exaltation Jesus before he was exalted went through temptation Oh glory amen now temptation just so that we understand Amen when the devil is bringing temptation into our life what his purpose is is to actually get us off of what God got us here for are off of God's divine purpose and he wants to shift us into some other purpose amen that's what a temptation will do in try to shift you from a man God's direction in your life to move you over to something else Oh hallelujah now you hope you all bear with me as a as a as it like I mentioned last week when I'm preaching I have to preach ahead of where we are I just can't stop at where we are amen I'm preaching ahead of where we are you know when brother Branham gave us these quotes these things weren't happening being he was preaching ahead of his day and now we're looking at something we're dealing with it now and the reason that we can have a an assurance and a peace in the in the midst of the storms because we know how to stay on work at glory to God look when the pressure come down I'm supposed to be going up amen that's that spot all of this thing is doing is squeezing and pushing me up brother rod and say Amen when the squeeze comes down watch the third pool glory to God I'm on the expectation for some great things from God amen amen amen my brother quick who said this morning it really felt that much pressure yet we still going to the grocery store you still got money in the bank you're still going to work they said even if you ain't going to work they paying you to stay home right that's not pressure wait till all that buckles and they can't pay you no more and there is no more government assistance and then you can't spend your cash that's pressure hallelujah glory to God look at this now it's temptation before his exaltation now I'll stop I won't read any more of the of that quote but there was the biggest temptation that Jesus had was when it was time to go to Calvary there he had to surrender his will to the Father he had to pray a prayer that all of us should pray God nevertheless not my will but thy will be done right and and and I think that's a very important prayers believers we got to come to this spot Lord is not my will but we're gonna let your will be done even in the midst of this virus I still feel that the will of God is being done there's people being a reach that would have not been reached had this virus not coming there's people reading their Bibles that would have not read their Bibles had this virus not come amen we want to be so quick to deliver everybody let me ask the question why why you want to deliver everybody Amen so everybody can praise you everybody can exalt you that's not what Jesus did I mean sometimes you got to wait and just see what God is doing in the midst of this Amen hallelujah brother quick was troubles about I think a leader over in one of these South American Nations say to man begin to pray like a Pentecostal leader of a country praying like that man if we got all the other leaders to pray like that we'll see God heal the lane heal in turn I mean here planet oh mama look at this Jesus Jesus temptation a man that he had there was there at the garden that was that was this is his ultimate temptation Satan was trying to redirect him to do something else but he stayed with what God's will was God's plan was but I want to pick up amen also here and Luke 4 let's just read this because this I'm also some temptation a man and remember what God give up gives us is his word in order to overcome whatever statement throw in our direction hallelujah don't let them take your crown don't let them take your crown thank you Jesus Luke for we see some other temptation happening here in this in this particular chapter verse 1 says in Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan was led by the spirit into the wilderness being forty days tempted of the devil and in those days he did eat nothing and when they were ended he act with hunger and the devil said unto him if thou be the Son of God command this stone that it that it be made bread now here's what he's tempted to you know turn turning it the stone into into bread right it says in jesus answered him and saying it is written that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of God amen and the devil taketh him up into a high mountain showed them to him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time now I looked at this I was just thinking about this what type of leader because according to these scriptures Satan actually is in control of every government according to this scripture that I'm reading and my question is what type of leader would shut down every Kingdom and in the midst of shut down every Kingdom try to kill the people that he has rulership over what kind of leader would do something like that I'll tell you what kind of leader the devil if you if you if we if a man if we didn't know no better my god amen look look this look at what Jesus does here you know the way we're gonna defeat Satan and this hours through the Word of God amen your feelings and gonna get it your emotions ain't gonna get it we gonna need the Word of God look at this and the devil taking them up into a high mountain showed unto him all the kings of the world in a moment of time and the devil said to him all this power will I give thee and the glory of them for that for that is delivered unto me and to whomsoever I will give it so the devil say all this power now he had power he had he had the kingdoms he had all this and he was willing to give it of Jesus now he was trying to give it to him without a Calvary glory that God Jesus already knew he was gonna get this but it was coming after Calvary oh look every knee gonna bow every tongue confess that Jesus is Lord I mean even according to the Book of Daniel there is a stone cut out of the mountains that's coming and gonna smash all kingdoms amen y'all ain't seen nothin come to a halt you think Corona brought him to her weight to the Lord Jesus comes and takes his rightful place glory to God he's king of kings and Lord of lords look it says and if doubt therefore will worship me all shall be done the devil's whole purpose all along is to get worship that was his was his goal he he can't he couldn't stand to see God give it at the beginning and now he's trying to get where he tried to get worship from God himself can you imagine that the God that created worship here Satan trying to get worship from God himself didn't realize it was God inside this body hallelujah amen he said so it's out there for worship me all shall be done and jesus answered and said to him get thee behind me Satan oh I like that talk to that devil get thee behind me Satan for it is written thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve amen kind of reminder what them Hebrew boys was doing amen what Dad was doing worshiping only his God says and he brought him to Jerusalem and set him on the pinnacle of the temple and said to him if thou be the Son of God cast thyself down from hips for it is written he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee not look at the devil use the word against Jesus you got to know where you stand in the word and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou should that's not foot against a stone and jesus answered said to him it is said thou shalt not tempt the LORD thy God and when the devil had ended all of the temptation he departed from him for seasons I want to tell you this too is gonna come to pass and this temptation will end at some point in time but you know what devil don't have another plan to come against us with we got to be ready for that but I want to tell you in the midst of all this God has made you a promise I will keep you in the hour of temptation and I want to just just just break into that just for a little bit a man as to what that that hour of temptation is what is this that God is keeping us from he made he made me a promise he made you a promise I'm gonna keep you in the hour of temptation and this our temptation is gonna come upon the whole world not just not your city not your country the entire world is gonna be tempted to do something but he said I'm gonna keep you and the hour of your temptation look at this we want to go back now oh oh yeah let's go back to this is the Philadelphia Church age but this is coming from the church age book paragraph 312 - 3 now this would be a pretty long read but I think it would be very helpful for us amen brother Branham is referring to this the Philadelphia Church age is the age right before the last was the latest in church age but these scriptures that I read a man there in Revelation 3:10 revelation I read verse 8 through 10 these scriptures also going to adversity 11 these scriptures were referring to a later time it's even referring to the day in which we live so I wanted to read that because this is the hour of temptation that's going to come upon all the world and God promised to keep us from something amen look at this this verse says revelation 3:10 because I was kept the word of my patience I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth what does he mean by the word of his patience Hebrews 6 verse 13 through 15 for when God made promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely blessing our blessed e multiplying I will multiply thee and so after yet patiently endured he obtained the promise you see the Spirit is speaking about the Word of God which is given to us to wait for the fulfillment of that word require patience even as it did in the case of Abraham he endured as seeing him who is invisible Amen even when I don't see it you work him even when I don't feel it you're working you never stop working right amen it says he was patient and then the word was what's the word finally was fulfilled some of y'all that are out of work be patient God made you a promise his promises will not fall to the ground a return for amen it will be fulfilled glory to God look at this he said this is the way God teaches its people patience why if he fulfilled his word and physical manifestations the very instant you pray you would never learn patience he says but what become even more impatient with life let me show you this truth even more even more fully set forth Hebrews 11 in step 11 17 look by faith Abraham when he was tried offered up Isaac and he that received the promise the Word of God offered up his begotten son there it is Abraham was tried after he received the word of promise laughter we get a from God we're gonna be tried on that promise as to whether we're gonna hold down to it oh we're gonna let go hallelujah amen after he received the world of promise most think that as soon as we pray in Jesus's name over the good promise of God that there could not be a trial hallelujah but here it says that Abraham was trying after he received the promise that is exactly correct according to the psalmist referring to Joseph in Psalm 105 19 until the time his work came the word of the Lord tried him God gives us exceeding great and precious promises he has promised to fulfill them he will but from the time we pray until the time we give the answer we must learn to receive patients into our souls for only a patience do we possess life let me go on he says may God help us to learn this lesson even as we know the people of the 6:8 learned patience we read the history we read the history of the lives of these great Christians what a contrast we see between their lives and ours for they were so patient and quiet and today we're all but overcoming over impatience and haste we want things to happen immediately but God don't do things it means we got it I was talking with somebody just the other day and they were saying you know they was going through some trials and you know with the family and and I say you know you you know he's like we know when we gonna see this when we're gonna see that I mean the scripture say all things work together for good but I don't see nothing good and this right now I said you ain't waited long enough you ain't waited long enough I said God don't lie if God say all things work together for good you know what all things will work together for good you just say live long enough and waited long enough in order to see it but there will come a day that you're gonna look back on this and you're gonna be thanking God for bringing you through it amen hallelujah we got to learn patience let's go on he goes on to say because you have taken my word and lived it and thereby become patient I will keep you from the hour of temptation which shall come upon the world to try them that dwell upon the earth now here again we see the overlapping of the two ages for this promise has to do with the end of the Gentile peer which culminates in the Great Tribulation now notice that scripture I'm reading this it's hit him in the Philadelphia Church age but brother Branham say this this scripture about I will keep you in the out of trivial of temptation that Scripture was not even full of Philadelphia Church age believers that scripture was for us that's living in Laodicea hallelujah and they say that scripture will culminate in the Great Tribulation I want to tell you we're not in the Great Tribulation we're not in the rapture we're not in the Millennium right now but we are looking for a raptor to come and say part of the raptures already happened right we know the shout boys in trouble part of it is already happen but we're looking for the fullness of it to complete glory to God and what I can tell you that as we are as we're here filling some of the pressures God has made us a promise and that promise is I'm gonna keep you in the hour of temptation Oh hallelujah you know what that says to me that I don't even have to try to keep myself I gotta try to do this on my own in my Austria God said to me I will keep you in the hour of temptation the temptation that's gonna come upon the whole world I'm gonna keep you oh oh I found shelter in his wings let's read this let's read what this is all about glory to God a man I think God has sent us a prophet in the south we don't have to be afraid of these things now we understand scripture through a prophetic glimpse look at this he says now here again we see the overlapping of two ages but this promise has to do with the end of the Gentile period Gentile period which culminates in the Great Tribulation now watch this I will keep thee from the hour of temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth this verse is not a declaration that the true church will go into the in in in to and through the tribulation that that's not what it means this verse does not mean that the church is going to go into or through the tribulation a man we're not going there we're going up church we're going up since if it meant that it would have said it would have said that but it said I will keep thee from the hour of temptation this temptation is exactly like the temptation in eating hallelujah what happened in the eatin she was tempted to disobey the Word of God God gave her don't eat from that tree the day you eat thereof that day you die she was tempted to move away from that she took reasoning she took reasoning rather than the Word of God and she fell in the Garden of Eden I want to tell you Church don't take reasoning today don't choose reason stay with the Word of God God is going to keep you in the hour of temptation I want to share with you what the temptation is look at this the Prophet tells us it would be a very inviting proposition held up in direct opposition to God's command at work and yet from the standpoint of human reasoning it would be so very right so enlightening and life-giving as to fool the entire world through the world watch this since only the very leg will not be fooled the temptation will come as follows hear this the ecumenical move that has started on what seems such a beautiful and blessed principle fulfilling Christ prayer that we all might be one become so strong politically now remember I told you I told you that Hebrew boys was fighting a political move or a government to move Laurie the Hebrew boys had to stand against the governmental move the the the Daniel had to stand against a Enoch that was brought in place by the government Oh hallelujah when Jesus went to the went to the cross it was religious people that brought him to the cross oh my and you know what the religious people did they came into an agreement with the government oh we better watch some things I was you know they had a threat I thank God we were to meet because it was it was threatened in New York any church that was meeting they would be shut down and then actually not allowed to meet again even after the virus has lit up they would not be allowed to meet again I told a brother say now they gonna have a hard time executing that with a Catholic Church or a Jewish synagogue they have a hard time executing that hallelujah right so so so so for somebody like us they could easily do it to us but a Catholic Church or Jewish synagogue they're gonna have a very difficult time doing that now now these things what we got to see is that everybody's kind of being put on the same playing field no matter how big your church is how small your church is everybody's on the same playing field no matter how great your country is how poor your country is everybody's shut down everybody's on the same playing field now it's very easy for certain things that actually get activated when we're in a mode like this now watch this this is what a prophet has told us he's giving us the interpretation of this scripture look at this the temptation will come as follows the ecumenical move that has started and they already got that they already got a document that all of them styling all the different religions of the of the earth I mean came together just a few years ago within the last couple years and they signed that they're gonna be they're gonna work together oh the Catholic Church being at the head of it all look at what the prophecy but but I'm looking at this because he made a promise to me I'm gonna keep you in the hour this temptation watch watch this and this is something like the prophecy this was not that happen in John Wesley's Day this scripture was for this day but I'm not afraid because I'm gonna keep you that's what he told me look he says he says only event very like would not be fooled the temptation would come as follow the ecumenical move that has started on what seems such a beautiful and blessed principle fulfilling Christ's prayer that we all might be one become so strong politically that she bears pressure upon the government to cause all to join with her either directly or through adherence to principles and acted into law principles enacted into law that no people will be recognized as actual churches and less under direct or indirect domination of this council this is what's supposed to be coming now we can see it's all set up for this church hallelujah don't don't miss this don't miss it don't miss it don't miss it we go to church for a little bit more than a shower we go to church for a little bit more than a jump we better go to church they actually know where we stand because as these things are changing and and I mean things change fast you wake up the next morning and some none change hallelujah I think I was saying earlier how you know that rest of the pastor I don't agree when I'm having autumn people in church but they arrested the pastor but I'm like at what point in time do they they actually go against the amendments or the Constitution when are they going against that and all in the end they sent for Public Safety hallelujah amen but you just went against constitutional that means something don't have to change because the church can use the constitutional rights hallelujah some don't have to change things can be enacted overnight the whole world changes glory I want I want to just let us know that there will I can I expect that there will be some changes even after we get on the other side of this we can expect it reading expected but I'm also expecting God to do some great things I want I want to just keep reading because the Prophet gives us some some information that's very very important become so politically strong so strong politically that she bears pressure upon the government to cause all to join with her either directly or through adherence to principles enacted into law as death so that no people will be recognized as actual churches unless under direct or indirect domination of this council little groups will lose charters privileges etc until they lose all property in spiritual rights with the people for example right now unless the local Minister association approves in many if not most cities one cannot rent a building for religious services to become chaplains in the armed services hospitals etc it is now almost mandatory to be recognized as acceptable to the trinitarian a communal groups I know of a insurance company that will not allow me to buy insurance unless I actually agree with the Trinitarian teachings they wouldn't let me do you agree in that with the Father Son and Holy Ghost pretty much the three God teaching do you agree I said no we don't you know I have one brother cup so now I don't believe that you know and he took him right back to script gesture why he and believe it took him back to Colossians chapter one and said they say oh that's a really good thing that you're saying it's a but we believe it this way and if you don't believe it this way you won't have insurance here that's insurance but think about buying and selling think about that oh all the little mom-and-pop shops run out of business but the big ones are still in business where the big money's flowing hallelujah well you think the Catholic Church will want to get any donations from mom-and-pop or big ones all right who do you think the bigger church is gonna want to get they delicious from mom and pops or the big ones hallelujah glory to God let's watch this profit already told us these things he says as this pressure increases look at what he says and it will it would be harder to resist for to resist is to lose privilege and so many would be tempted to go along for they will feel it is better to serve God publicly in the framework of this organization then not to serve God in all publicly now look at what the prophecies but they air to believe the devil's lie is to serve state see that that same devil that was trying to get worship from Jesus Almighty God way back in Luke chapter 4 that same devil is still at work today trying to get worship hallelujah look at this he says to believe the devil's lies are served Satan even though you may want to call him Jehovah to believe the devil's lie is to serve Satan even though you may want to call him Jehovah but the elect will not be deceived let me just read the rest of this because this is very important furthermore the elect will not only be camped but as this mu becomes the image erected to the Beast the Saints will be going in the rapture I say glory their God not only are we gonna be kept but church as they move this is moving a Manticore this verse revelation 13 this is moving and as that in as the move becomes the image erected to the Beast the Saints will be gone in the rapture they used to sing a song and he used to get excited about it we're going up we're going up we're going up in that first resurrection they'll be coming from the north they'll be coming from the south they're be coming from the east they'll be coming from the west but we're going up we're going up we're going up with the Lord Church that's that's that's what my heart is that I don't know how much more this pressure we gonna be under but as they begin to shift these things as laws begin to change there is a promise that there's a rapture awaiting us that's what I'm looking for it says the Saints will be going the rapture and this little delightful wholesome I mean winsome movement that started out in fellowship at Ephesus will become the monster of Satan that defiles and deceives the whole world for the church system of the Roman Catholic and Protestant and coming together will control the whole wealth of the world system and force the whole earth into its religious trap or will kill them by refusing them the privilege of buying and selling whereby they would they would make a living this would be accomplished simply Harless daughters are all but going back to her in the meantime Rome has acquired nearly all the supplies of coal the Prophet was telling us back in the 60s these things Rome has acquired nearly all the supplies of gold the Jews have the bonds and all the paper and I've just you know recently heard that and I don't know how true this is because you there's so much stuff is floating around there you don't know what's right and what's not but there was a statement that nobody in Israel has contracted the virus nobody and that's pretty amazing that's pretty amazing but I do know that Israel has a part to fulfill in prophecy and I know Rome has a part to fulfill in prophecy also know the United States has a part to fulfill in prophecy so I'm looking at all of these things and if a virus brings all this together then let the will it be done but I know this church is going up in a rapture look at this at the time the harlot will destroy the present-day money system by calling in all the paper and demanding gold with no gold the systems the system false the Jews will be trapped and coming to the Alliance and the harlot Church will take over the whole world but we have a promise that he's gonna keep us and the hour of temptation they kept the Hebrew boys you kept Daniel you kept Jesus because Jesus just kept giving the word when he was being tempted just kept giving to the devil to work he promised to keep us in the alwah temptation Church I don't want you to fear I want you to know exactly what's going on I know what you're getting what you can expect from a spiritual standpoint don't fear God got this and he made us a promise I promised that he wrote in the Philadelphia Church age that was gonna be for us in this land of C&H I'm gonna keep you I'm gonna keep you now you know talking to young man in the barber shop a few weeks ago and saying you know what am I gonna do if you know it get down to the pork where you know I gotta do something or to feed my kids my family what am I gonna do you know you know I'm gonna do whatever they ask me to do I want to feed my kids I said whatever you do don't don't don't take the mark don't don't do that don't reject the word in this out you stay with the word the same God that made a way for Daniel the same God that made a way for the Hebrew boys is the same God that's gonna make a way for us and and I all I can do in this house just encourage the church you know what I say things like this because I don't I really don't know when it's gonna be our last time coming again I really don't know but I want to make sure I say something to the church to have them ready because we this hour that we living in nobody's ever lived in it before nobody in script has ever been where we are right now but by faith God's gonna bring us through and we're gonna and all you got to do it just remind God always said God just said you're gonna keep me you say you're gonna keep me when I can't keep myself but I'm thinking about giving up and giving in and quitting and all that you say you're gonna keep me remind me of your word quicken to me amen and my understanding so I won't give up in this out I'll keep you in the hour of temptation let's pray father we are grateful for the word that we can lean upon we can trust we can hold to grateful that you provided a prophet to us O God that he broke the scripture down so we can clearly see what to expect in this hour Lord it won't take us by surprise that's that's why scripture even tells us that you know that the day of the Lord will be like a thief in the night but you say that day will not overtake you as a thief because we're not children of the night we're children of the day it has been revealed to us just as it was revealed to Abraham before Sodom was destroyed you went down and you begin to share secrets with Abraham you told him what was going to happen once he got a hold of those secrets he began to pray and to intercede for others God that's where we want to be on our knees in prayer and interceding for others the hours so late the time is so short God we want to be ready we really we that's that's that's all that matters now is being ready there's anything in our life Lord that was that's hindering us Lord we pray that you would deal with us until we get rid of that thing we confess it before your Lord knowing that you're faithful and just to forgive I pray Lord for those that even Lord online and watching maybe they've never even heard anything like this so God but I pray something would strike them Lord people moving from one story to another story god one I mean moving from one thing to another Lord there's so much coming out so much information some false some real we don't we don't even know but one saying to the next thing god we just want to stay focused on the word that's what matters we don't want to miss it in this hour so lord I pray your blessings and over your people I pray God that you just continue to reveal yourself open up our understanding help us to see how close we are how real this dis is and God how the devil can use it God to bring glory tips up but how you can use it to bring glory to yourself Lord we we thank you thank you for your word thank you for this day that you've given us it's the data you've made we rejoice and we're gonna be glad Lord and as we just bring this time to close and service to a close as we leave Lord keep us until we're able to come back together again and I pray Lord that you just keep our mind stayed on thee keep our hearts focus on thee God for we don't know when that great trumpet will sound in time will be no more will be called from this dimension to another Lord changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye god we want to be ready in Jesus name leaving leaving safe and secure from me [Music] only everlasting home yes I'm bleeding whoa I'm leaning safe and secure from all along yes leave me leave you know the everlasting arms yes I'm leaving [Music] safe and secure whoa [Music] all the everlasting arms hallelujah a man song you know I want to be ready to walk in Jerusalem just like John okay you just keep playing just want to remind you will be dismissing here and as we go out we're just asking that let's not congregate outside our one of the things that's been coming as churches is that they see large groups of people just congregating them and they're just concerned so we want to just try to avoid that and if you just need they really need to talk to somebody just please just call them on the telephone and and just talk with them but again we want to try to adhere to most of the things that have been requested of us we're trying to find a balance in a given Caesar what is Caesar's I want you're giving God what is God so help us to strike that balance and as the as the brothers will dismiss they'll just dismiss maybe just a few at a time as you as they go out and but the others just just remain you know patient and they'll get you out amen and in due time thank you so much for understanding and just working with us through this time the Lord bless you and keep you they manage to go throughout this week but he meet every need that you have and stay close to Christ stay close to Christ as we don't know amen when he'll come for us god bless you we love you appreciate you me [Music]
