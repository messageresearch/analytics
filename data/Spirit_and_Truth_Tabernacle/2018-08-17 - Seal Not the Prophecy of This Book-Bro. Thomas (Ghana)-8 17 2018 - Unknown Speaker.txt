are in her presence tonight because there was a provided we're so far away concentrate our lives we look forward for your visitation come and page everyone obeys and look through the blood and see people that of growth with our righteousness that you can fellowship with us thank you Father in Jesus Christ's name Amen okay-y we understand there may be you if you want to tell about the book of Revelation chapter 22 Revelation chapter 22 okay I'm taking my reading from verse six and he said unto me these things are faithful and true and the Lord God of the Holy Prophets sent his angel to show unto his seven the tents which must shortly be done the whole I come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book and I just saw these things and heard him and when I heard him and seen I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel he showed me these things then said he unto me see thou do it not for I am thy fellow-servant and of thy brethren the prophets and of them which keep the sayings of his work worship God and he said unto me seal not the sayings of the professor of this book for the time is at hand he that is unjust let him be unjust him and he that is filthy let him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is holy let him be holy still and behold I come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according to his work his work shall be I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end the first one of us blessed are they that do His commandments and they that they may have right to the Tree of Life and may enter through the gates of the city for without are dogs and then sorcerers and whoremongers and the mattress and idolatress and then who sort of I love it and make it and I I Jesus have sent my angel to testify unto you these things in the churches I am the root and the offspring of David and the bright and Amana star under spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that will there is a test come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely for I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book If any man shall add unto these things God shall add unto Him the plays that are written in this book If any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the terms which are written in this book he which justified these things saith surely I come quickly Amy even so come Lord Jesus Christ the grace of our Lord Jesus be with you Oh hallelujah yes we turned a law for reading a portion of the scripture maybe pray that the Lord just give it that revelation of the dissuade in Jesus Christ's name you can take receipt for now amen God richly bless you I appreciate my friend bright Chuck for this open to again and for some years back three or four years attached up to you and there was one time I was also tried to come back and speak at the our friend halted I thought in the Atlanta somebody I have a team it was have landed a plane halted because there was a great storm and I could not make it and last year or so I could not come to Florida but they said the Lord made a wave here to come true and the happy that I met my friend at Washington us Maryland we met together and I also enjoy Abraham said and the message was thinking my filter and the professor it is not because I'm preaching the way that you put me in heaven but he said I can sit in the congregation and listening to the unknown Techbridge hallelujah so I really also enjoyed my friend one as such and I listed to him preach we really do a really place so it is not just preaching but the unknown tip preaching however that the difference so that's why it is very important not anyone to to presume that you can make it easy because God has got and special people that he trained when I'm at a bus a loaded and said get them to training before he can really entrust into the hand to serve the Bride of Christ because you are very precious people but a prophet said who is the good Jesus Christ when he sat the people down and he'd be the master wash their feet seven my he was a seven you're serving the bride so you know the bride needs to be said so the producer who is the greatest they will not sit down to be sent under one that serve you are the greatest hallelujah you had a greatest so we are just servants and we serve you you see me standing here what I'm giving the bread of life you see that I was eating some are the greatest hallelujah we appreciate that you know your place as such and we give God the glory so tonight we are privileged to come into the presence of God and what's most important is the Word of God so I really appreciate my friend rakov him so tonight we are going to put a stay on the message sing of this worker seem not heavily her seal not the prophecy of this book man no the prefer was saying something here let me read it us before we go to the message why some people can't keep the victory in the message the Prophet said the love of God God is love and unless each one of these keys is put right in the same scent of love it will become selfish and indifferent and is set off and isolate itself and cross over and fuse and steal but when it is I crowd right in the middle of laughs it will finish everywhere and that is mine that's another wooden beam the church is dying of love brother hallelujah Oh best said bigger than all what are we a subject me ah that is a design the people he has really leaders like himself and that is what you want to see that prefer refreshing in earth under water will really distinguish it from this earth for the people this one is love and the prophets are only Christians can survive another of is a delta is different from the world liver so that is what God put to you so if you don't have the love we get on your knees are you crying out develop father said oh how long should the baby cry [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] 3sg in June verse 38 oh that's a bitter person may be I cannot read artists about to be actually go sometime we agree that we may jump over because I want to bring many tears I don't know yeah job heritage I said okay there is a joint out of the wire really we would have said is this canceled by

bless her because and other things he was good by himself the winner was right there in him and the Rosie you know [Music] [Music] no the ration of the Sun the professor he is the one with the P versus paragraph 3 OHS no design he is doses for the homeworld of God is Christ and Christ is deceased at me what is the popular or deceased [Music] so there is your God epidemic but this one seemed not the prophecy Olivia the professor says on here that is he is it instead that's any further ones this one is that it is the church that means them on a stream it is the church say that he's the man that wanted to be a son of God under search it is the rumor that you money the church it is not the Bible for the Bible Islam oh yeah the word was refresh I realize oh man you see the Bible is a man is one the church is real [Music] [Music] he was Jesus available when Jesus a person here that could cut you know he was at the fire police denying Jesus the biggest reverie we are talking of the seal that seemed like this prophecy don't forget what I said in lesson on the Sun is a now and this the morning then in this case so we need our bodies under the job for me at the best of the edgy and in heaven there was a memory and his activist work was anyway worried that because this son of God grace it also brings to every son that was for again to this greater hallelujah there was a memory a memory good hardly this mine because he [Music] [Music] [Music] because and just for special people oh my goodness let us see let us talk about this blue collective let us go as good as I am as I am as that in twenty nine million as I tell in a verse 11 is that under vision of always be come on Jew are the words of the book which is few which will give up to one that is learn its own witness because no matter this anymore my condition ABC won't give me this book that I read because he knows that is C under relevant calorie the letter C and the eyes of the branches and out of darkness this is a personalized then you can see this pan because the how I stomp to the glossary is a secret especially oh that I see not the prophecy of this book hello hey man listen in the Garden of Eden God had a purpose of redemption but he kept this secret now they never said God keeps his word 57 Bible says perhaps in 7 goes with is festive antenna forever those way is fist and it is an antenna and it

hallelujah oh my god have messy seal not the prophecy of this book now let us bring a little story here at the book of Esther let us go to Esther and sees of don't you present different book of Esther Esther chapter 3 yeah Esther chapter 3 verse 12 and 15 then write the Kings ascribes on the thirteenth day of the first month and there was written according to all that heaven had commanded unto the kings reference and to the governors that were over every province and to the winners of every people of every province according to the legend Gareth and to every people after the lugash in the name of King Ahaz arose was it written and see with the Kings ring there was the National seal because Haman has seceded to convey the kid and Eva seceded to put a decree with the kids - this mic is mine to destroy Medicare to destroy esta hallelujah I see you with a kiss ring hello oh let's step you don't annoy but now you're not a story not when there was a bump it I'm gonna let us feel a little about that chapter 5 Hana fight I mean Esther sorry Esther 5 now it came to pass on the third day the Festa with a par and stood in the inner part of the king's house over a guild at King's house and the kill shot upon his return in the royal house they were against the gate of the house and it was so when the King saw Esther the Queen standing in the court that she appealed favor in his sight and the King here heard out to testa the golden scepter that was in his hand so Esther Delia untied the top of the then so the king unto her what will die under that and what is my request it should be even giving me to the half of the kingdom I'm Esther I said if it seem good unto the King letter came and help man from this day on to the banquet that I have prepared for him hallelujah No there was a sin to destroy but has no paper there was a seed to the shredder pride there was a seed to destroy those true Oh [Music] come on bust me we have glasses on he might destroy that was her a special request like a seal or just because of the story you are fond fever oh yeah I remember when that lady was behind him the rippers and they were dropping a handful of purpose you remember her the rippers the men of the harvest wars house told them where the harvest was plenty is a nice room for me only Percy and when you touch the acid release the mouth of your suck [Music] oh yes look at what Paul said here questions that the truth verse 14 and 15 collisions the glasses that was against us which was contrary to us and picked it out of the way his crops and harvest pile asperities and powers he made a show of them openly well you'll find that the truth transfer any open is it hallelujah yes sir he has all the merchants all the merchants all human so see that the right against Israel [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] that's a problem said the person in adoption he said the sinner he doesn't sing hallelujah Robin says sinner doesn't sing it is God's job Bredesen hallelujah so my dancin lesson there's no issue this nature he's only producer what is in him so what is wrong if you say is an issue [Music] there's nothing wrong see that the professor of this book hey man now the professor said that is the bride maybe I never separated from the groom when you read lesson of the Sankara got you fortune he said we were no separate said when Jesus we were seeing him and what Jesus was going to cover where we him because we will not listen waited let me fast maybe I can't he said remember hey wait yeah we ruin him you see God have must submitted the bread from the break room yes so when God down upon the butterflies he sobered me rafi me it was always aim in that one body you see they are once in the same way the service book of the world that the groom is right well hold on the bread come unfair to manifest everything that was promised of him and the group also come and he wouldn't be the bride but when we did everything and even to prove it by raising him up from the dead after world then thank the brain has to do the same thing has to be exactly what the word said she will be in the last day but she has to retain this miracle for don't she has to be in the last days that is manifest like it was in the days of Sodom but the world have to be just as only like that it is it is these things a picture identification of the Word of God yes so you and him will never separate areas because that's where the seal he's seen the path that is where when Jesus was on earth what did he tell the disciple he said don't go to the Gentiles you cannot reach them because they're already in me my wife is in me you can go and preach to them oh boy get in Adam he was speaking to himself but 'if was read in him but white evil suppressor then understood the where we where we should rot partake of this tree hell yeah they read the message where the rain God did the charge he take a child to Adam and Eve was in him do not take up this tree this tree of evil that's the winner of evil good done partake of it it was the man he gave the message the moon wasn't in him he was domesticated resolution we welcome listening that to the Gentiles because the temptation no part in the resolution and that is ready that's a resume see you read us 13 the Bible said that Jamie Blosser my show noise when they had a message that is why we are rejoicing tonight because of the resurrection hallelujah hey man Jesus has to declare this epistle arrived in Paris or Berlin deal but those at least 397 never said the girl's death mystery mystery ha swampy and floated in Jesus Christ then dipping down right down through this church what was worse is this one is in the Bliss Jesus Mickey Mouse to the church his brain whispering secrets to her hallelujah that is right in this servants knew what was happening in the cell and there was a secret to the blood to the wife only the wife will know what was going on when you pull your wife head for a closer to your mouth and then you build is burning your wife you don't know what they know you see the reminiscence I can hold yes with you oh good what is great is whispering secret yeah Christmas Eve that's why the people don't know what is going on it is very divisive God that's what Bobby said hallelujah only my second Corinthians me first Corinthians 2:14 to assist in 1st Corinthians chapter 2 but the natural man received miracles of the Spirit of God for they are foolishness unto Him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned but he little spiritual judgeth audience you're dealing said instead of more men for whom the name of God the human instruction by we have the mind of Christ hallelujah you see your position you have the mind of Christ where you speak is Christ that's our purpose arrangement is data speaking when it be must fish Haiti we've got a person in a message Jesus Christ opposition our God telephone buzzes my friend not me again you can't let my disbelief again enough is enough position so this guy I was trying to because we made a promise this is the promise of God when I settled up to the whole of it but listen what the comforts of Ibiza that sealed alone that's our that's our comforts nobody can pull it out of you hey man the evidence of the pages remember one day I came to Babylon that is frequently that Jeremiah Jeremiah 32 Jeremiah 32 ms-13 and our charge Burch our chat bar which before them saying that's eNOS that's yet the Lord of hosts the God of Israel took these evidences this evidence of the pitches both which is sealed and this evidence which is open and put them in an earthen vessel that they may continue amenities for thus says the Lord of hosts the God of Israel houses our third and biggest shopping process again in Islam hello remember when they were going to captivity or the puzzle world don't generally about you said we the palace waiter price and then the scroll of the purchase price put it in an earthen vessel make a vest of us VESA and insert it you know trust one another and put the evidence of the pictures right there because of the captivity but nice really but again when you come back to like heritance Helen even I need to get her hey man no listen what a professor Revelation chapter 5 but you know he said yeah him we found a heart we understand now what the sudden simple was what it was we got it in a school now I'm just remember this in this love days it was cut in an ethnic vessel you understand it now and what was that every message Jesus Christ neither Jesus Christ nobody nobody heard it that is only to him it was already written the book it was written in the book it was hit so that nobody confront it that's right so it is in him that it is revealed and in that alavesa so it will not work or rust hallelujah you see the purchase price God has to put it and a professor the professor and get planned in their places the emergency service I know remember crashing himself is also comical [Music] and the way that the sort of Schlemmer died it was what any mother said it was woman being but man leaning against man that is where I go put the price in this earthly vessel in Jesus Christ that is the best that will not rot not the best garden or master that's a swagger pitches price war sketch hallelujah oh my she's not this prophecy when this silly book will sing in old age like we read in Isaiah you saw it but he really understand it he only saw it as a see book and the vision was suitable I declared for the love the burn and then the people that are deaf who hear the rest of the book men without a man I know right there we are also got a very blessing he could also not understand hallelujah Daniel chapter 4 verse 4 and H you remember Daniel also got the vision of the book he's got 12 in my friend grant sleep hey that's not your day hallelujah then at 12 do you know this picture let us really quick I said what for but Thou O Daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of and many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall increase that's it and ahead but understood and then said I o my my God my lord what shall be the end of distance and he said go away Daniel for the rest I split up and sealed till the end time see you look at me from Tennessee it's a sin sin sin see why because it was not time for it to be declared so if a seal then you want you to understand but he said no you cannot because it is my time to declare this secret it is not time to unveil this mystery so can a daughter sleep with your father's a man then let us come quickly to Revelation chapter one is go to Revelation chapter one let us early jump many times so that we can really come to progression chapter 1 verse 11 11 I am Alpha and Omega the
