[28:36] speaking to another portion of the elect
[28:38] of christ and
[28:39] i know we say that a lot but i sure do
[28:41] mean it and sure counted the
[28:43] honor and privilege to be here and man
[28:46] we certainly
[28:47] enjoyed the fellowship with brother duff
[28:49] and just the spirit of god in his life
[28:51] and
[28:51] we certainly appreciate him in the
[28:53] church here we just say god bless you
[28:54] all and
[28:55] glad to have my wife here with me also
[28:57] sister gabrielle and
[28:58] we just said god bless you the book of
[29:00] first samuel the third chapter
[29:03] uh one verse of scripture here we'll
[29:05] read also in the book of proverbs
[29:07] and the 29th chapter first samuel 3 and
[29:10] 1 the bible says
[29:12] and the child samuel samuel ministered
[29:14] unto the lord before eli
[29:16] and the word of the lord was precious in
[29:18] those days
[29:20] there was no open vision we we know that
[29:23] brother branham would actually take a
[29:25] text out of that scripture quite often
[29:28] uh
[29:28] talking about how there wasn't an open
[29:30] vision there wasn't a direct word of the
[29:32] lord in that age
[29:34] amen there was no open vision also
[29:36] proverbs 29 the 18th verse
[29:41] proverbs 29 and 18 the bible says here
[29:44] where there is no vision
[29:46] the people perish but he that keepeth
[29:49] the law
[29:49] happy is he a man where there is no
[29:53] vision the people
[29:54] perish but he that keepeth the law happy
[29:56] is he we pray that god will bless the
[29:58] reading of his word as you may have your
[30:00] seats this evening
[30:01] if i would title the message tonight by
[30:03] the help of god i'd like to speak to you
[30:05] on the subject
[30:06] of a message of purpose a man a message
[30:09] of purpose looking here at that
[30:11] scripture in proverbs 29 and 18
[30:14] uh we see uh the wisdom of solomon here
[30:17] where there is no
[30:18] vision the people perish now i really
[30:20] don't go into greek words very much
[30:22] but i just thought it was very powerful
[30:24] that meaning of perish there
[30:26] in the greek the word perish it means to
[30:28] let go
[30:29] to let loose to let alone to loosen
[30:32] oneself to show a lack of restraint to
[30:36] loose restraints on oneself and i
[30:38] i thought it was very powerful how that
[30:40] when there is no vision the people
[30:42] perish so
[30:43] in other words we could say well there
[30:45] is no vision we lose
[30:47] uh we lose restraint when there is no
[30:49] vision we loosen ourselves when there
[30:51] when there is no vision uh we're not
[30:54] about god's business when there is no
[30:56] vision
[30:57] uh we lose restraint of of what we're
[31:00] here to do
[31:02] is that right so in other words we could
[31:04] say without a vision
[31:06] uh it causes loose living without a
[31:08] vision
[31:09] we let go we uh without a vision we have
[31:12] no purpose we live
[31:13] loosely and we know here that a vision
[31:17] it's something that brings direction
[31:19] it's something that brings leadership
[31:20] it's
[31:21] something that brings guidance and we
[31:23] could say tonight that without a vision
[31:26] uh we could say that we're a ship
[31:27] without a cell
[31:29] amen without a vision we're a ship
[31:31] without a cell
[31:32] and we just go wherever the wind blows
[31:35] us and whatever comes it
[31:36] it pushes us over when we don't have a
[31:38] vision we don't have something we're
[31:41] fighting for we don't have something
[31:42] that we stand up for
[31:44] amen but i simply believe tonight that
[31:46] god has given a vision
[31:48] amen to the church of the living god
[31:51] amen and we're not here perishing we're
[31:53] not here loosening up
[31:54] amen we're not here becoming lukewarm
[31:56] we're not here becoming dry
[31:58] amen but i believe in all of my heart
[32:00] that the children of god
[32:02] in this age we're not here without a
[32:04] purpose we're not here without no
[32:06] leadership we're not here
[32:08] without any direction but i believe with
[32:10] all of my heart
[32:11] that we are being led by the same pillar
[32:13] of fire
[32:14] amen that led the children of israel out
[32:16] of egypt and you see when you're being
[32:18] led by the spirit of god
[32:20] it does not cause loose living it does
[32:22] not call taking off the restraints
[32:25] amen but it makes you dive into the word
[32:27] and show where you're living at
[32:30] hallelujah amen a vision of something to
[32:33] bring us direction and we notice
[32:36] if we're here without vision we're gonna
[32:38] it's gonna cause
[32:39] loose living if we're here without
[32:42] vision we've got no purpose we
[32:44] uh we've got no reason to do what we're
[32:46] doing and
[32:47] and we find you you look at people
[32:49] brother smiley uh when they lose a
[32:51] vision when they lose a purpose
[32:53] brother they become lukewarm they become
[32:55] dormant and the christian walk
[32:57] amen they don't hardly come to the house
[32:59] of god they don't hardly pray no more
[33:01] they don't hardly listen to the tapes no
[33:03] more they don't hardly do anything
[33:05] you say well the psalmist why is that
[33:07] it's because they have lost the vision
[33:09] they've lost a purpose
[33:11] amen they've lost the inspiration of god
[33:14] amen but i believe that the church of
[33:16] the living god does not have to be in
[33:18] that condition
[33:21] yes sir hallelujah
[33:25] thank you brother
[33:28] amen without a vision we're like a
[33:30] flower when the wind blows we just blow
[33:33] we just blow any direction now in the
[33:35] message doors and door 65
[33:38] but the man would say here i like a man
[33:39] of vision i i like people that have
[33:42] something that they're fighting for
[33:44] amen not just lay around and say well
[33:47] whatever
[33:47] comes along it's gonna be all right he
[33:49] says no we ought to be up
[33:52] and at it amen and i think every
[33:54] christian ought to be that way
[33:57] amen find your purpose and go do it
[34:00] amen find your purpose and go do it amen
[34:03] can you rise up in faith and just take a
[34:05] prophet's word

[34:08] somebody
[34:09] that has something they're fighting for
[34:11] not just lay around whatever comes to go

[34:18] thank every christian ought to be
[34:20] that way and church let's just take the
[34:22] breaks off and preach for a moment

[42:04] are here without a purpose
[42:06] i don't want to lose my focus of why i'm
[42:09] here we don't want to lose the focus of
[42:11] what we're here
[42:12] and what we're here to do and i believe
[42:14] there's so many people brother sister
[42:16] they get discouraged in their christian
[42:18] wall because they've lost a vision
[42:21] they've lost a purpose somebody came
[42:23] against them and they lost their purpose
[42:25] and their drive their ambition
[42:27] amen their determination amen but i tell
[42:30] you
[42:32] i believe god can restore it amen i
[42:35] believe god can restore the purpose he
[42:37] can restore the vision
[42:38] amen this message of the hour is a
[42:41] message
[42:41] of hallelujah
[42:45] now you see we even look at the ministry
[42:47] of our prophet
[42:48] brother branham or even really great men
[42:50] of god
[42:51] it seemed like there wasn't anything
[42:53] that would ever stop him
[42:55] he lost his baby lost his wife lost
[42:57] everything brother
[42:58] his world was turned upside down but he
[43:01] kept going
[43:03] he defied every law of man brother he
[43:06] had critics coming against his message
[43:08] what he was preaching
[43:09] what he was teaching you think you and i
[43:11] got some critics i tell you
[43:13] the prophet of our age has some critics
[43:16] nobody supported him at all
[43:18] at one point in his ministry you see
[43:20] making a stand on the word isn't popular
[43:23] making a stand on the word of god is not
[43:25] always a popular way but it is god's way
[43:28] amen and the prophet would also say when
[43:30] you stand with god
[43:31] amen god will stand with you
[43:35] when you stand with god y'all will stand
[43:37] with you by but just looking at this
[43:40] the ministry of willing branham amen
[43:42] everything that he would go through
[43:44] but yet he was still there you see what
[43:47] he had received he received a vision
[43:50] he received a purpose amen he received a
[43:53] message of purpose
[43:55] i mean just the same thing when he said
[43:57] i baptized down there on the ohio river
[43:59] he said well many of you were standing
[44:01] there 23 years ago right on the ohio
[44:04] river
[44:04] come right down to where i was at said
[44:06] it's john the baptist
[44:08] was sent before um the first coming of
[44:10] jesus christ
[44:12] your message will foreign the second
[44:14] coming of christ
[44:16] amen you see that was the message he had
[44:18] received
[44:19] and then that was the visitation he
[44:21] would receive and you see
[44:22] even the purpose of his life had been
[44:25] stabilized
[44:26] by the word that god had given unto him
[44:30] amen the purpose of his life had become
[44:32] stabilized
[44:34] by the word that god had given unto him
[44:37] and friends because of one man that
[44:39] would surrender his whole life to god
[44:42] amen there would be multi-thousands
[44:45] around the world
[44:46] hey man brother let's just face it
[44:47] tonight if he didn't go and do what he
[44:50] did
[44:51] we wouldn't be here i hope that's okay
[44:54] amen if he didn't go and do what he did
[44:56] i would have never been here brother
[44:58] jack wouldn't be here
[44:59] but you see what it was it was one man
[45:02] that god got in his hands
[45:04] and he had a vision he had a purpose
[45:07] that the message i'm packing
[45:08] will fall around the second coming of
[45:10] christ amen and he
[45:12] knew no matter what circumstance no
[45:15] matter what devil
[45:17] no matter what may come and what may go
[45:19] and the purpose of god
[45:21] will always be fulfilled amen the plan
[45:25] of god
[45:26] will always be fulfilled and because one
[45:29] man win
[45:30] and one man got the vision and one man
[45:32] caught the purpose
[45:34] but i tell you we're here now gathered
[45:36] together
[45:37] under the message of the hour amen and
[45:40] has brought rapture and faith
[45:42] back into the church of the living god
[45:44] it brought the god of the bible
[45:46] and pulled him out of the pages and put
[45:48] them back into the church
[45:51] yes sir you say what did it one man
[45:55] that called a vision now we have the
[45:57] revelation god did it through his
[45:58] ministry wasn't a man
[46:00] we're not lifting a man up we're lifting
[46:01] god up and i'm sure you all know
[46:05] but because one man had caught a vision
[46:07] one man that caught the inspiration he
[46:09] caught the purpose
[46:11] he knew hey no matter what comes no
[46:14] matter what goes
[46:15] i'm gonna fight with everything i've got
[46:19] i'm gonna press with everything of god
[46:21] it's because he caught the vision
[46:26] he caught the vision now we can look at
[46:28] all the great men of god
[46:30] brother they fought they fought and
[46:33] fought and fought
[46:34] seemingly and on unstoppable people
[46:38] seemingly unstoppable men of god but you
[46:41] see the reason they were unstoppable
[46:43] is because the leadership god had given
[46:45] them amen and god had a program
[46:49] and the program of god can never be
[46:51] stopped is that right
[46:54] but i want you to notice here just
[46:56] bearing in this area for a little bit
[46:58] even though the program of god cannot be
[47:00] stopped that does not mean satan won't
[47:02] be against it
[47:04] even though the plan of god even though
[47:06] the program of god
[47:07] cannot be stopped at all it's impossible
[47:10] to stop the plan of almighty god
[47:12] i mean the plan of the omnipotent god
[47:15] even though it can't be stopped that
[47:17] does not mean satan ain't going to try
[47:19] and that does not mean satan's not going
[47:21] to be battling
[47:22] that does not mean satan won't be
[47:24] fighting but it does mean
[47:27] it does mean as hard as he may fight
[47:31] it does mean as hard as he may punch
[47:34] as hard as he may blow there isn't any
[47:37] demon power
[47:38] that can stop the program of god and you
[47:41] may be fighting this evening
[47:43] you may be warned this evening hey
[47:45] remember take courage
[47:46] don't be weary and we'll do it if you're
[47:49] fighting that probably means
[47:51] that you've got something amen if this
[47:53] church wasn't fighting
[47:55] i'd be worried that brother jack wasn't
[47:57] fighting
[47:58] i'd be scared for you brother but
[48:00] because we're in a battle
[48:02] that means that god is on our side and
[48:05] satan would not be fighting us
[48:07] if he got us and the reason he's
[48:09] fighting
[48:10] is because he knows the program of god
[48:13] cannot be stopped
[48:17] he knows it can't be stopped but that
[48:19] ain't stopping him from trying
[48:22] that ain't stopping him from working but
[48:24] it's a good testimony to you
[48:26] ain't meant to know hey if he's fighting
[48:29] against me
[48:29] i must have something if you're not
[48:32] battling tonight you probably don't have
[48:34] nothing the devil's trying to steal
[48:39] hallelujah
[48:42] we've got a vision we've got a purpose
[48:46] among the book of revelation would show
[48:48] how the antichrist spirit
[48:49] will always try and come into the church
[48:52] make it lukewarm we all know the quote
[48:55] make it powerless
[48:56] try and defile it amen satan will always
[49:00] be
[49:00] working against the true church of the
[49:03] living god
[49:04] amen he'll always be trying to take away
[49:07] our purpose
[49:08] because when he takes away your purpose
[49:10] but you'll just sit there
[49:14] you'll just sit there and be a spectator
[49:16] in the service
[49:17] amen satan can rob us of our purpose and
[49:20] make us feel like we don't have any
[49:22] place in being here
[49:23] but he's got you whipped right there
[49:26] amen and he'll always be warring
[49:28] trying to make us feel like we don't
[49:30] have nothing
[49:31] isn't that right i'm the unchangeable
[49:34] god working an unexpected way
[49:36] amen who can stop god thank you buddy
[49:39] amen who can stop god you can't do it
[49:41] you can no more do it than you could
[49:43] easier stop the sun
[49:45] adam but you can't stop god his program
[49:48] will move on
[49:51] amen the program of god will move on let
[49:54] us quote here looking to the unseen
[49:56] amen when a man once catches that
[49:59] invisible
[50:00] the vision of the invisible god and
[50:02] knows that he's always
[50:04] present there is something that
[50:05] stabilizes that man's thinking notice
[50:08] here
[50:08] when the man catches a vision amen of
[50:12] the invisible god
[50:14] it stabilizes the man's thinking his
[50:16] actions
[50:17] and in the time of distress and trouble
[50:20] it'll make him look upward
[50:22] and above the things that are happening
[50:24] around them he says why
[50:26] amen because he's looking at the unseen
[50:29] amen we've called a vision of the unseen
[50:31] god and then we've got a direction of
[50:33] the unseen god
[50:34] while we've been given a purpose from
[50:36] the unseen god and it has stabilized who
[50:39] we are
[50:40] it stabilized our our actions and
[50:42] stabilized our purpose
[50:45] is that right
[50:48] hallelujah amen i think of this story

[1:03:57] purpose and what i would do tonight
[1:03:59] is say god i want to receive a handful
[1:04:02] of purpose
[1:04:03] amen back into my life and god
[1:04:06] amen give me the seal of the hour god

[1:04:16] we need it tonight
[1:04:18] and we need to receive it tonight we
[1:04:20] need the vision we need the purpose
[1:04:26] and this message is a message of purpose
[1:04:31] oh brother
[1:04:35] if he could get in a jawbone and bring
[1:04:38] purpose to a jawbone
[1:04:40] what could he do with his children what
[1:04:43] could he do with his children that would
[1:04:44] fully surrender
[1:04:46] into the hands of god and i say what we
[1:04:49] need is a surrenderance
[1:04:51] i'm going to say god use me in any way
[1:04:54] you can
[1:04:56] use me in the way you see fit amen give
[1:04:59] me back a purpose give me back a drive
[1:05:02] give me back a reason and be in here
[1:05:05] i believe he'll do it
[1:05:08] brother i tell you amen god's got a
[1:05:11] purpose for our life
[1:05:13] god's got a purpose for this church amen
[1:05:16] if it was up to you and me
[1:05:19] i'm going to strike a chord if it was up
[1:05:21] to you and me
[1:05:22] we were to give up a long time ago in
[1:05:25] fact many of you did
[1:05:28] many of you did give up i mean many of
[1:05:31] you said i'm done with
[1:05:32] it but on sunday morning brother there
[1:05:34] was an unseen pool
[1:05:36] aiming to grab you by your or
[1:05:38] your suit coat and junk you back into
[1:05:40] the house of god
[1:05:41] you said why did he do it i mean because
[1:05:43] the choosing of god has ever changed
[1:05:46] the purpose of god has never changed the
[1:05:48] program of god has never changed
[1:05:50] and brother you may give up on god you
[1:05:53] may lose your purpose
[1:05:54] but god has not given up on you and god
[1:05:57] has not lost his purpose on you
[1:05:59] and will never lose his purpose and will
[1:06:02] never lose his program you say but i
[1:06:04] give up
[1:06:05] but he didn't he said but i lost my
[1:06:07] vision
[1:06:08] but he didn't hallelujah
[1:06:13] he'll give it again brother what did you
[1:06:15] do
[1:06:16] when they spoke all e rather they spoke
[1:06:19] all manner of evil against you
[1:06:22] they spoke all manner of evil against
[1:06:24] you but they said all kinds of evil
[1:06:26] things
[1:06:27] you felt like well i might as well just
[1:06:28] get all discouraged and give up and stop
[1:06:31] trying and stop
[1:06:32] fighting and just throw in the tower no
[1:06:34] sir
[1:06:36] no sir we're a people that's received a
[1:06:38] greater vision than that
[1:06:40] but there ain't enough that can stop us
[1:06:43] there ain't enough critics
[1:06:44] there ain't enough naysayers there ain't
[1:06:46] enough power there ain't no principality
[1:06:49] amen in simple words the devil don't
[1:06:51] have enough
[1:06:57] oh brother i'm just getting out of where
[1:06:59] i want to be
[1:07:00] [Laughter]
[1:07:02] hallelujah amen he wouldn't by the way
[1:07:05] i'm in the message here
[1:07:06] the voice of god 63 he would actually
[1:07:08] take this text here
[1:07:10] amen and say no it's a very outstanding
[1:07:12] time we realize that we're speaking from
[1:07:13] the scriptures
[1:07:14] there was no open vision of the days of
[1:07:16] samuel he said now where's there's no
[1:07:18] vision the people perish we must
[1:07:20] have a vision amen visions comes to the
[1:07:23] prophets
[1:07:24] the word of the lord spoken to them he
[1:07:26] said that something like it is today
[1:07:28] i think the church the organization and
[1:07:31] the nominations
[1:07:32] they've been on the field for a long
[1:07:34] time
[1:07:36] they're beginning to get laxed and the
[1:07:39] work of the lord is being left undone
[1:07:43] the word of truth because the church
[1:07:46] itself has become
[1:07:47] dim sided and we need today
[1:07:51] the voice of god to speak among us
[1:07:54] and bring us back he said bring us back
[1:07:58] to why
[1:07:58] bring us back to a purpose amen bring us
[1:08:02] back to our vision
[1:08:03] i mean that's what he's saying there
[1:08:05] we've been on the field for a long time
[1:08:07] we're getting likes the work of the lord
[1:08:09] is being left undone
[1:08:10] amen the church itself is beginning dim
[1:08:12] side we
[1:08:14] need today the voice of god to speak
[1:08:16] among us
[1:08:17] and to bring it back church i say he's
[1:08:20] done it
[1:08:23] amen to thank that the voice of god has
[1:08:25] spoken in this generation
[1:08:28] it spoke purpose back into the church of
[1:08:30] the living god
[1:08:31] it has spoken life back into the church
[1:08:33] but it spoke the
[1:08:34] it spoke the the manifestation of the
[1:08:37] word
[1:08:40] hallelujah i think he'd send his voice
[1:08:43] in this generation
[1:08:44] amen to bring back the vision of the
[1:08:46] church of the living god now
[1:08:48] i think it's very powerful here he says
[1:08:50] the coming of the prophet is a sinus
[1:08:52] overlooked by the people
[1:08:53] every time they overlook it they never
[1:08:55] get it somehow lets those
[1:08:58] that eyes are open those who are elected
[1:09:01] to see it
[1:09:02] they do see it the coming of a prophet
[1:09:05] was a sign
[1:09:07] that god is ready to speak because if
[1:09:10] god ain't ready to speak
[1:09:11] the prophet would not be on the earth
[1:09:13] now remember that he would not be on
[1:09:15] earth unless god was ready to speak
[1:09:17] that's the way he speaks is through
[1:09:20] those channels
[1:09:21] the unchanging god never did do it any
[1:09:23] other way
[1:09:25] this is always god's way of making this
[1:09:28] voice known unto the people
[1:09:30] he sends his prophet amen he sends his
[1:09:34] prophet with a message of purpose back
[1:09:36] into the church
[1:09:39] amen give us something to fight for
[1:09:41] brother i tell you amen we're in uh
[1:09:43] we're in a generation
[1:09:45] that there's so many people that they've
[1:09:47] lost their meaning of life almost
[1:09:49] they've lost their purpose of life
[1:09:51] amen let's just take our halos off
[1:09:53] tonight we've been there
[1:09:55] i've been there you've been there we
[1:09:57] think god what am i even doing
[1:10:00] anybody ever been there okay got a
[1:10:02] couple
[1:10:03] i don't feel too bad we've all been
[1:10:06] there
[1:10:08] we felt like god i feel like i ain't got
[1:10:10] a reason in being here
[1:10:12] i don't have a purpose in being here no
[1:10:13] longer i feel like i'm not useful
[1:10:16] brother the message of the hour has come
[1:10:20] it said you evangelists that are out
[1:10:21] there with a god called gift
[1:10:24] they asked him a question said brother
[1:10:25] the man should evangelist continue in
[1:10:26] the field he said yes

[1:10:30] gift preach with everything you've got
[1:10:33] amen preach with every ounce of strength
[1:10:36] in you and don't stop
[1:10:38] amen until there ain't no more breath
[1:10:39] out of your body
[1:10:42] and even when the breath is out of your
[1:10:43] body you can leave a legacy behind
[1:10:45] that'll still be preaching
[1:10:47] and then because you lived a life amen
[1:10:50] according to the word of god
[1:10:52] hallelujah the voice of god is spoken in
[1:10:56] this
[1:10:57] generation it's brought back purpose and
[1:11:00] trying to find a place to close it's
[1:11:02] it's brought back purpose it's brought
[1:11:04] back our reason and doing what we're
[1:11:05] doing faith this evicted 58.
[1:11:07] he says oh you can't purpose anything of
[1:11:10] god's promise in your heart
[1:11:13] without finding reality to it he said if
[1:11:15] your soul has been tormented by sins and
[1:11:17] doubts ups and downs frustrations
[1:11:19] he said and there's something down in
[1:11:21] you notice here and there's something
[1:11:23] down in you telling you
[1:11:24] that somewhere you can overcome it he
[1:11:27] said why you just flown around from
[1:11:29] church to church place to place
[1:11:31] he said just kneel down he's talking
[1:11:33] about finding purpose again
[1:11:35] he says you can't purpose to find
[1:11:37] anything from god without finding the
[1:11:39] reality
[1:11:40] to it there's something down in there
[1:11:42] telling you there's something more
[1:11:44] you can't overcome that he says why do
[1:11:47] you float around church to church he
[1:11:48] said just kneel down
[1:11:50] until you strike heaven as i said last
[1:11:53] night go beyond the sound barriers
[1:11:56] then you'll have a purpose in life
[1:11:59] you'll have a purpose belonging to the
[1:12:01] church
[1:12:02] you'll have a purpose in being baptized
[1:12:05] you'll have a purpose
[1:12:06] in what you're seeking for
[1:12:10] ain't that powerful there he says to get
[1:12:13] a purpose
[1:12:14] go beyond the sound barrier break past
[1:12:17] that barrier break into the shekinah
[1:12:19] glory break into the presence of god and
[1:12:23] you go beyond that sound barrier he says
[1:12:25] you'll have a purpose in life
[1:12:27] you'll have a purpose and belonging to
[1:12:29] the church
[1:12:33] amen coming to a close
[1:12:38] maybe something's got in your way
[1:12:40] tonight of you fulfilling your purpose
[1:12:41] and
[1:12:43] i believe that god can give purpose back
[1:12:46] you believe that i believe god can
[1:12:49] restore purpose i i know this
[1:12:51] i know this virus has done some damage
[1:12:53] to people spiritually and
[1:12:55] being out of church and things and
[1:12:57] growing cold on god i've seen it a lot
[1:13:00] i'll tell you in just one moment in the
[1:13:01] presence of god brother it can bring
[1:13:04] back the zeal of god
[1:13:07] i think of what brother branham would
[1:13:08] say he said one man and in the presence
[1:13:10] of god did more from moses
[1:13:12] in 70 years of schooling i'm persuaded
[1:13:16] what we need
[1:13:17] tonight is to be in the presence of god
[1:13:20] and receive a purpose and say god
[1:13:23] i want to know something i'm fighting
[1:13:25] for i want to have a purpose in doing
[1:13:28] what i'm doing i want to feel like
[1:13:29] i want to feel like i've got a true
[1:13:31] leadership and a true direction
[1:13:32] i believe he can give it tonight i mean
[1:13:35] maybe satan's robbed you of your zeal
[1:13:36] your prayer life your purpose
[1:13:39] but maybe he's robbed your victory or
[1:13:40] your shout used to being on fire of god
[1:13:43] full of purpose in your life and now
[1:13:45] you've grown cold
[1:13:47] i believe he can do it again
[1:13:53] musicians can come amen the prophet
[1:13:57] would say that
[1:13:58] jesus was willing to get rid of anything
[1:14:02] that would separate him from the
[1:14:05] fellowship between him and the father
[1:14:08] amen the earthly ministry of christ he
[1:14:10] was he was willing to get rid of
[1:14:12] anything
[1:14:13] that wasn't necessary in his life that
[1:14:15] would be hindering
[1:14:17] him and the fellowship with the father i
[1:14:19] i think that sometimes we let
[1:14:21] some little things get in the way
[1:14:24] i mean we let some little things get in
[1:14:25] the way between us and our walk with god
[1:14:27] and
[1:14:28] we've lost our purpose and something's
[1:14:30] got between you and god and
[1:14:32] i wonder tonight as we bow our heads if
[1:14:38] it should humble our spirits father
[1:14:43] maybe there's someone in here tonight
[1:14:44] god and
[1:14:46] they've lost their purpose
[1:14:50] or they've lost their zeal and serving
[1:14:52] you
[1:14:54] they've lost the joy that they once had
[1:14:56] god they used to be a happy christian
[1:14:58] excited to come to the house of god but
[1:15:00] we nearly have to beg them now
[1:15:04] god and maybe you're dealing with that
[1:15:05] hard and
[1:15:08] god i wonder if there'd be anyone in
[1:15:09] there that would say god that's me
[1:15:13] if you just like to stand to your feet
[1:15:14] this evening
[1:15:16] and say god i want you to rekindle my
[1:15:18] zeal

[1:15:25] god i want you to give me back what i
[1:15:27] had and
[1:15:30] put the fire back on the altar
[1:15:33] put the zeal back on the altar if you
[1:15:36] like to raise your hand to him
[1:15:38] and say god i want it tonight amen hands
