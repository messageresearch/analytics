[0:13] lord
[0:15] amen to those that are here and those
[0:17] online

[0:22] slight glitch in um
[0:24] getting everything turned on
[0:27] um but we we are here
[0:30] hey man and we're gonna go on
[0:33] uh
[0:40] amen so
[0:42] so i don't be before you too long
[0:45] let us go before the lord is in prayer
[0:48] amen most gracious heavenly father lord
[0:50] we
[0:52] come before you this evening o lord god
[0:55] thanking your father god for
[0:57] your saving grace o father god your
[0:59] healing power lord god
[1:01] revelation of father god that you
[1:04] have bestowed upon us o lord god we
[1:06] thank you lord god for
[1:08] uh all that you have given us we realize
[1:10] that no
[1:11] good gift all good gifts come from you o
[1:14] lord god and we're come up father lord
[1:16] we ask you lord to just
[1:18] open up our understanding
[1:20] where we ask your father god to
[1:23] uh may your spirit flow lord god and
[1:28] to our revelation into our hearts so
[1:30] father god to become closer to you
[1:33] lord by the opening of your word lord we
[1:35] yield all of our faculties to you o
[1:37] father in jesus name we pray amen
[1:41] amen um
[1:43] if you open up in your bible i guess
[1:46] we'll start here and take a reading
[1:51] amen from hebrews the 11th
[1:56] chapter
[1:59] the third verse
[2:03] and we'll also take a reading from
[2:06] the same uh book of hebrews
[2:09] the same chapter 11th chapter and we'll
[2:11] read also from the
[2:13] fifth verse so we'll read straight
[2:14] through
[2:16] amen
[2:20] mental
[2:34] amen
[2:39] and we see here
[2:42] that hebrews 11
[2:44] amen says
[2:46] that through faith we understand
[2:50] that the worlds were framed
[2:53] by the word of god
[2:55] so that things which are seen
[2:58] were not made
[3:00] of things
[3:02] which do appear
[3:04] if we can go on down there to the fifth
[3:07] verse
[3:08] it says by faith enoch was translated
[3:13] that he should not see death
[3:16] and was not found because god had
[3:20] translated him
[3:22] for before his translation
[3:26] he had this testimony that he pleased
[3:29] god
[3:30] amen let me the lord add a blessing to
[3:32] the reading of his word
[3:34] amen uh this evening i'd like to take a
[3:38] a little lesson
[3:41] if we will on uh
[3:43] portals
[3:45] into other worlds
[3:48] portals into other worlds
[3:50] we see here
[3:52] amen that uh uh uh
[3:55] that it was brought out here in hebrews
[3:57] the 13th chapter
[3:59] amen it says here that the worlds plural
[4:03] were framed by god now
[4:05] by by by us
[4:07] uh in in in in
[4:12] carnal i would say or in in educational
[4:15] or just our our physical
[4:18] uh what we see we we tend to
[4:21] uh
[4:22] um
[4:23] because we live in this dimension we
[4:25] live in this world we tend to base
[4:29] everything
[4:30] on what we can
[4:33] see taste here smell
[4:36] and
[4:37] one of the old sayings that was just uh
[4:40] um i can only believe what i see
[4:44] you know uh but there is a world that is
[4:48] more real
[4:50] than this world
[4:52] that your eyes can see
[4:55] as we as we live we try to open up our
[4:58] understanding
[5:00] amen uh by the baptism of the holy ghost
[5:03] so that we may be able to see
[5:06] into
[5:07] the other worlds
[5:09] amen we we realized that we
[5:12] uh
[5:14] uh we live here
[5:17] amen but we are
[5:19] oftentimes influenced
[5:23] by of those other those other worlds
[5:27] amen
[5:28] um we see here
[5:30] amen the bible says here in
[5:32] in hebrews the 11th
[5:35] and the seventh verse by faith noah
[5:39] being warned
[5:40] of god of things not seen as of yet
[5:45] that he moved with fear to prepare
[5:49] an art
[5:50] to save
[5:52] to the saving of his house
[5:56] by the which he condemned the world and
[5:59] became
[6:00] heir of righteousness
[6:02] which is by faith
[6:04] so we see there and dressed right there
[6:06] in the no in the in the in in noah's ark
[6:09] the art was a portal
[6:12] into another world
[6:14] those that entered into the ark was
[6:17] translated a man from anteluvian world
[6:21] into a
[6:22] post-anti-deluvian world amen and see
[6:26] the the it says in ii peter that the
[6:29] entrance amen must be ministered unto
[6:32] you amen so they were ministered to a
[6:35] man by the prophet noah and man he was
[6:39] obedient and moved with taste to build
[6:42] an ark because at that time that was the
[6:44] provided way amen to be translated into
[6:49] this world
[6:50] many times we we we we we we we we think
[6:54] and and most people when they think of
[6:57] uh other worlds are being translated
[6:59] they sort of kind of go into a a thing
[7:02] of thinking as a of a geodra
[7:04] geographical location
[7:07] a place that is
[7:09] higher than ours or or many light years
[7:12] light years away we see uh just recently
[7:15] they launched a a hubble telescope amen
[7:19] so that they can be be able to look
[7:22] beyond amen in galaxies
[7:25] what are they looking for
[7:27] what are they looking for the world that
[7:29] they're looking for is right beside them
[7:32] it's just in another dimension
[7:36] but we see that these things are going
[7:38] on we see uh uh uh mr elon musk and
[7:43] and the other fellow there is a thirst
[7:46] right now upon the people amen to to
[7:50] search for another world
[7:52] amen there is a thirst right now in
[7:54] people to become
[7:56] astronauts amen but brother branham
[7:59] described that you
[8:02] are the original astronauts
[8:05] but there is a hunger and a thirst among
[8:08] the world right now to try and be
[8:11] translated into another world
[8:14] when you understand that they they build
[8:17] machineries and and different things to
[8:20] take them to a geographical location
[8:23] that is many miles and light years above
[8:26] amen but they don't realize that if they
[8:29] would just dig into the word and submit
[8:32] themselves to the holy spirit the
[8:34] translation is not a geographical one
[8:37] but a spiritual one
[8:40] to be translated into another world amen
[8:45] by the baptism of the holy ghost through
[8:47] a prophet
[8:49] amen because see it was the anointing
[8:52] that was on noah amen and through the
[8:55] the the word the preaching of noah that
[8:58] his family was able to enter into that
[9:00] portal to be translated into
[9:03] that other world
[9:05] thank god we've had a prophet in this
[9:07] hour
[9:08] amen because in the message chosen of a
[9:11] bride brother branham described it like
[9:14] this he said he said
[9:16] a prophet
[9:17] amen you can't anoint a man to be a
[9:20] prophet
[9:21] he has to be born that way amen he is
[9:25] hand picked by god amen to do a job
[9:30] he's hand-picked because he has certain
[9:33] abilities that god gave him to do what
[9:36] to be a seer to be able to look into
[9:40] other worlds
[9:41] the prophet of god explained it this way
[9:43] he said it's like if we were at a
[9:46] ballpark amen and and we we we that we
[9:49] didn't have money to get into the game
[9:51] to see the game so we're outside on the
[9:55] fence and we couldn't but there is a
[9:57] knot hole in the fence
[10:00] so brother one brother may be just tall
[10:02] enough amen to see into the fence now he
[10:06] didn't give himself that height
[10:09] he didn't just wake up one morning and
[10:11] say i want to be tall
[10:13] no he was it was something that god gave
[10:16] him but put into his dna before he was
[10:20] born that he would be a certain height
[10:23] amen that he can look into that hole and
[10:25] see
[10:28] what's going on on the field
[10:30] so they wanted to see the game they
[10:32] wanted to see what was going on so
[10:34] everybody else because
[10:38] they believed the word of the one that
[10:40] was looking into the eye looking into
[10:42] the hole
[10:43] he they had to believe everything that
[10:46] he was saying
[10:47] okay i'm looking into the hole and i see
[10:49] the batter i see these uniforms there's
[10:51] a black uniform and there's a white
[10:53] uniform there's two teams there's so
[10:55] many people on each team there's an
[10:57] empire and there's this and there's that
[10:59] and one is coming up the back and he's
[11:01] telling he's describing everything
[11:04] but they had to believe and trusted the
[11:06] word and by them believing and trusting
[11:10] in the word of the seer they became
[11:13] division to be translated into the game
[11:18] even though they didn't have money to
[11:20] get in
[11:23] but they were on the outside
[11:25] in another world
[11:27] they were not in the atmosphere of the
[11:29] game because they wasn't inside the
[11:31] stadium
[11:32] they were on the outside amen but there
[11:35] was a prophet amen that had the ability
[11:38] to see
[11:39] because he was ordained to be able to
[11:42] have the stature a man to look through
[11:45] the hole and their job was to believe
[11:49] only believe
[11:51] amen and by them believing the word for
[11:55] that hour they were able to be
[11:57] translated into the game
[12:00] from the outside
[12:03] being on one side or into another world
[12:06] amen they were able to cross over and
[12:09] enter into the atmosphere of the game
[12:13] amen and that's much like we are today
[12:16] amen we live we know that we have five
[12:18] dimensions
[12:20] amen
[12:22] hey man uh uh uh
[12:26] we have the dimension
[12:27] the first dimension which is our first
[12:30] three dimensions which is light
[12:33] matter and time
[12:35] amen these this is the the dimension
[12:38] amen that we live in
[12:41] the dimension that that that that that
[12:43] we're
[12:44] that we we our senses amen are are
[12:47] designed to to to to to live in this
[12:50] world thank you my brother i would
[12:52] everything i we our sight hearing smell
[12:55] taste see i mean identifies with this
[12:58] world
[12:59] so this world
[13:00] what we see is easily amen believable
[13:05] because we see it with our eyes
[13:08] amen
[13:09] but i want you to understand
[13:11] amen that there is a a a fifth dimension
[13:15] amen which is which is described as the
[13:18] underworld it is the region of the lost
[13:22] it is the region of demonic spirits and
[13:24] hell itself
[13:26] amen
[13:27] and then there's another two dimensions
[13:29] above that which is six and the seventh
[13:32] dimension which is the region of the
[13:33] blessed amen the region of of of god and
[13:38] the angels
[13:40] in the sixth and the seventh dimension
[13:42] amen so we're living here in the middle
[13:46] of these dimensions
[13:48] amen and we can be influenced i wanna i
[13:51] wanna i wanna uh uh uh kind of explain
[13:54] it
[13:56] amen
[13:57] it's just like
[13:59] it's just like a
[14:00] baby amen when uh
[14:04] a woman and a man
[14:07] amen
[14:08] decides to come
[14:09] together
[14:11] by holy matrimony
[14:14] amen it's it's lawful
[14:16] amen for them
[14:18] at that time to bring forth
[14:21] a child
[14:23] but before then that child
[14:27] was already there
[14:29] but in another dimension
[14:32] amen
[14:33] that child amen already existed
[14:38] in another world
[14:40] amen
[14:42] but by uh uh the great ordination of god
[14:46] brought these two together amen and by
[14:49] the predestination that child amen began
[14:52] to come forth
[14:54] amen so it moved from a world from a
[14:57] salt amen from a dimension amen a
[15:00] heavenly dimension amen and it moved
[15:03] into the uh
[15:04] another world and moved into the world
[15:07] of ambionic fluid of the mother
[15:12] however that child is is is developing
[15:16] and moved into that world to be
[15:18] developed to do what is being developed
[15:21] and being nourished so that it can
[15:23] survive in this world
[15:26] but however that child is still while
[15:29] it's in the amniotic fluid and in the
[15:32] world amen of that mother it is being
[15:35] influenced
[15:37] by this world
[15:40] many times they say you should sing to
[15:42] your baby while it's in the womb
[15:45] they say the stress of the mother
[15:47] affects the child
[15:48] amen they say what the the things the
[15:51] mother does and and the atmosphere and
[15:53] things affects the development of the
[15:56] child
[15:58] amen so that child
[16:00] even though it's not in this world or in
[16:02] this in this dimension it is effected
[16:07] by this world
[16:09] amen
[16:10] and there is a portal amen that after
[16:14] development after a certain development
[16:16] that that child must go through the
[16:18] birth canal amen to come into this world
[16:23] amen
[16:24] and and and we see it once it's born
[16:27] into this world
[16:29] it comes into this world and begin
[16:33] to rule and guide me began to develop
[16:36] the more translation begin
[16:39] looks and then realizes who its mother
[16:42] is and father is and are beginning to
[16:45] get acclimated with its environment and
[16:48] begin to know how it becomes acclimated
[16:51] amen to this world
[16:54] but we begin to become acclimated with
[16:56] this world amen i want you to understand
[17:00] amen and that child develops and
[17:03] everything like that and
[17:05] but now i want you to understand that
[17:07] now that it is in this world
[17:12] it has the opportunity to be influenced
[17:17] again by another world
[17:20] and that's the point that i'm trying to
[17:22] drive home i have many quotes and many
[17:24] scriptures and different things that i
[17:26] can read to back up you know a lot of
[17:29] what i'm saying but i want you to
[17:31] understand
[17:33] i look at the story of joseph and his
[17:35] brothers
[17:37] joseph uh was a special child
[17:41] he he
[17:42] he had gifts amen that his brother
[17:45] didn't have
[17:47] and and and and they they were jealous
[17:49] of him and and they took him
[17:52] amen and and and and there listen now
[17:55] their goal was to kill him
[18:00] amen
[18:01] they were going to take him and they
[18:03] were going to kill
[18:05] him
[18:07] dead
[18:08] now his brothers were being influenced
[18:10] from another dimension
[18:13] they were being influenced through
[18:15] jealousy
[18:17] and hate from another dimension to try
[18:21] and stop the plan of god
[18:24] amen
[18:25] but what happened is amen they decided a
[18:29] man a man to to to put him in a pit
[18:34] but along came a reuben
[18:37] who said i just can't let him go out
[18:39] like that
[18:41] i can't let him go out like that
[18:43] came and took him amen out of the pit
[18:46] and sold him into slavery see even in
[18:49] the situation where he was his brothers
[18:52] were being influenced and god had a plan
[18:55] for joseph that even the influence of
[18:57] the underworld could not stop the plan
[18:59] of god
[19:02] could not stop the plan of god and i say
[19:04] today that even though you we may see
[19:07] the influence of the underworld on some
[19:10] of our children or or different people
[19:13] our loved ones and
[19:15] and and our associates who we may
[19:17] associate it with amen if they're in the
[19:20] plan of god there's nothing that the
[19:22] devil can do his plan will go forward
[19:25] you see it come because god uh
[19:29] his plan is his purpose
[19:31] amen was his protection
[19:35] amen even though he was being influenced
[19:38] that his brothers were being influenced
[19:40] from another world amen it what it did
[19:44] was it worked right into the hand of god
[19:47] so see see god has always used amen
[19:52] satan to bring forth his will without
[19:54] him even knowing it
[19:56] amen
[19:58] i'm reminded you know when when when he
[20:00] led captivity captain see those those
[20:03] those old soldiers amen that died in the
[20:06] will of the lord amen they went into a
[20:09] holding place called paradise which is
[20:11] called the region of the bless
[20:14] amen or the region i'm sorry the region
[20:16] of the lost
[20:17] amen but he had to go down amen and lead
[20:21] them out amen but what he had to do
[20:24] first he had to cause a man of spirits
[20:28] from the underworld amen to blind amen
[20:32] the the israelites to crucify him
[20:37] amen
[20:38] they were anointed with spirits from
[20:41] below
[20:42] amen to do exactly what they did but god
[20:46] allowed it why so that pe the sacrifice
[20:50] had to be sacrificed they made in order
[20:53] to have a way to go into the region of
[20:56] the bless
[20:57] because sin we were cut off and there
[20:59] was a chasm there amen so he allowed
[21:02] satan amen to to to do what he had to do
[21:07] amen not knowing and understanding that
[21:10] he was working right into the will of
[21:12] god all the time
[21:17] so we see that jesus
[21:19] died on the cross
[21:21] amen
[21:23] went down into the regions
[21:25] of of the of the fifth dimension
[21:29] amen he didn't stop there he went on
[21:31] down
[21:32] amen into the regions of the demons
[21:35] and went all the way down into the
[21:37] region of hell and took the keys
[21:40] amen and set the captives free
[21:43] amen we see that those lower dimensions
[21:45] the fifth dimension uh he abides there
[21:48] but he don't even own his own kingdom
[21:51] he took the keys to death hell and the
[21:55] grave he ain't even got keys to his own
[21:57] house
[21:59] amen
[22:00] but what i want you to see my brothers
[22:02] and sisters
[22:04] is that many times many times
[22:08] we may be disappointed
[22:14] sometime in actions
[22:17] we may
[22:19] look at things
[22:21] from one standpoint
[22:22] [Music]
[22:24] i i i before i go any further i i would
[22:27] want you to know
[22:29] amen that
[22:31] uh second corinthians
[22:33] amen uh the fourth chapter in the 18th
[22:37] verse
[22:38] says while we look not at things which
[22:43] are seen
[22:45] but the things which are not seen
[22:50] for the things which are seen
[22:54] are temporal
[22:56] but the things which are not seen
[23:00] are eternal or eternal
[23:03] so what am i saying here we we we look
[23:06] at amen
[23:08] this
[23:09] dimension that we're living in
[23:12] amen uh of light matter and time
[23:16] amen this
[23:18] this dimension amen this temple
[23:21] it's temporary
[23:23] it is not eternal
[23:26] so
[23:27] and the influences amen that we see
[23:31] that are coming up from hell
[23:33] and causing
[23:35] people to be influenced to do things
[23:38] that might upset us
[23:40] causing people
[23:42] to do things
[23:44] that might be troubling
[23:46] i
[23:47] assure you and i want you to see to
[23:52] begin
[23:54] to look not at the things that they're
[23:58] doing
[23:59] to look not
[24:01] at your brother and your sister
[24:05] as in joseph's situation not at your
[24:08] family as look at this and what they did
[24:12] to me
[24:14] the influence came
[24:16] from another dimension
[24:19] many times that fourth dimension is the
[24:22] is the highway
[24:24] it's the highway by which it's it these
[24:26] things come from and it is the
[24:28] the i call this
[24:31] the channel of communication
[24:34] just as the entrance
[24:36] amen to
[24:37] uh the dimension above must be must be

[25:02] the information
[25:03] super highway
[25:05] via television and things of that nature
[25:09] amen these this is the avenue in which
[25:13] these these portals have been opened
[25:15] into to bring them into this dimension
[25:19] amen recently uh uh they
[25:22] uh had a uh a concert or so appeared and
[25:26] i'm sure many people heard about it
[25:28] this this fellow uh
[25:31] what scott travis or somebody and uh uh
[25:34] uh
[25:36] so many people lost their lives
[25:39] because they opened up portals into
[25:42] another world
[25:44] amen our uh uh people people came to
[25:48] this to this to this concert and entered
[25:51] into uh this atmosphere and there were
[25:55] certain spirits that were released there
[25:57] that caused people to lose their lives
[26:02] in one place call it a satanic feast
[26:07] through and even if you see the the the
[26:10] the video i happen to see it on youtube
[26:12] or somewhere and then even it was like a
[26:16] a portal
[26:18] and by which these spirits uh uh was
[26:21] translated into this into this world
[26:24] amen but i thank god that we have
[26:26] another portal
[26:28] amen it's a spiritual portal amen that
[26:31] we receive i
[26:32] commit by by by
[26:35] revelation that will transform us into
[26:38] another world now let me go on
[26:42] we
[26:43] amen as christians
[26:46] amen we
[26:47] uh uh
[26:49] we have the
[26:51] opportunity
[26:53] we have the right
[26:55] we have the uh responsibility
[26:59] amen that even though we live amen and
[27:02] we
[27:03] among like matter of time in this
[27:05] dimension that
[27:06] through the baptism of the holy spirit
[27:09] and through the preaching of the word of
[27:10] the hour that we don't have to live in
[27:13] this world we can live above this world
[27:18] amen
[27:19] by the holy spirit we can live just a
[27:21] little bit higher why where we don't
[27:24] look at the world the things that are
[27:26] seen
[27:28] but we look at the things that are
[27:30] unseen
[27:32] we live we literally
[27:34] live in a place see that's where
[27:37] that's where our complete rest come in
[27:40] that's where the complete rest come in
[27:42] because even though this is happening
[27:44] over here we're not looking at what's
[27:46] happening over here we're looking at
[27:48] what's causing this over here okay we
[27:51] see that this is not a flesh and blood
[27:54] warfare this is not a flesh and blood
[27:57] battle amen that this is a spiritual
[27:59] battle and we fight it with spiritual
[28:02] things
[28:04] see we don't get caught up in oh well
[28:08] such and such did this to me and such as
[28:10] hut looked at me funny and this person
[28:13] uh wasn't kind to me and this thing we
[28:17] begin when we see things like that begin
[28:19] to come into our heart and things like
[28:21] that we realize that these are
[28:23] influences from another world
[28:28] amen and we would see these things and
[28:31] what we do we have compassion
[28:34] for our brother and sister because we
[28:36] realize if these things are true and
[28:37] this person did this and this person did
[28:39] that and this person did better and that
[28:41] lord they're being influenced
[28:43] that person is under attack from another
[28:45] world
[28:47] spirits from and what we do we go to the
[28:50] father as intercessions on their behalf
[28:53] why because you're not living in this
[28:55] world you're living above this world and
[28:57] the things that you see you don't look
[28:58] at things like everybody else see you
[29:00] look at things different because your
[29:02] mind has been elevated
[29:06] through the preaching of the gospel
[29:08] amen that your eyes of your
[29:10] understanding has been open that you can
[29:12] live this is what happened to enoch
[29:17] by the eyes of his understanding and by
[29:19] his closeness with god he walked with
[29:21] god and just like he you move by the
[29:23] baptism of the holy ghost from one
[29:25] dimension amen you move into an elevated
[29:28] dimension within that dimension but
[29:31] you're right at the door of being
[29:33] translated
[29:37] right at the door of being translated
[29:39] because your mind your thinking your
[29:42] eyes everything is already there
[29:46] only thing you left is your body
[29:50] you live in another dimension
[29:53] i don't look at what's going on around i
[29:55] don't look at the balls i don't look at
[29:57] the money i don't look at these things
[29:59] ah god i'm looking in heavenly
[30:03] i'm looking beyond this
[30:05] this is temporal
[30:07] this is not real
[30:09] although it's real
[30:12] but it's the where i'm living at is more
[30:14] real
[30:17] and i know that this will pass away
[30:20] i know that everything here is being
[30:22] influenced from either beneath or below
[30:25] below or above
[30:30] so i don't get trapped into this
[30:33] many people
[30:34] are in the under
[30:37] open themselves up
[30:40] to demons from below
[30:43] because they don't believe
[30:46] the prophet that's looking through the
[30:48] eye of the nighthold and telling them
[30:50] what's going on
[30:53] so what happened
[30:55] depression sitting
[30:57] malice
[31:00] envy
[31:02] strife why
[31:06] we know what these things are
[31:09] you know the devil is so sneaky and so
[31:12] conniving that he'll do something oh now
[31:16] listen to this he will cause your child
[31:21] anoint your child with the demonic
[31:24] spirit for one reason
[31:26] to bring you down
[31:29] to break to to weaken you and see he's
[31:32] good at what he does
[31:33] he'll systematically do this he'll he'll
[31:37] first he'll bring something from your
[31:39] child or say something wayward to you
[31:41] and then somebody else will say
[31:43] something wayward to you and then you'll
[31:45] run into somebody who cut you off in
[31:48] traffic what is he doing he's weakening
[31:50] you and weakening you and weakening you
[31:53] and weakening you
[31:55] until all of a sudden you just cuss
[32:06] but that's how he does
[32:09] get you so you just constantly
[32:11] constantly constantly ah
[32:15] using everything that he can
[32:18] to get you to that point
[32:20] why
[32:21] he's trying to get you
[32:26] many times
[32:28] the devil used
[32:31] a wayward situation
[32:39] sometime a
[32:41] not filled with the holy spirit
[32:43] [Music]
[32:45] he may
[32:47] do things unseemly
[32:50] and
[32:52] sneak out
[32:53] and begin to be influenced
[32:56] amen
[32:58] by the fashions of this world on other
[33:00] women
[33:03] but let me tell you something
[33:09] his whole
[33:11] goal
[33:13] if he has the mind of that man
[33:15] who would look
[33:18] he has the mind of that woman to cause
[33:21] her to dress in such a way
[33:25] who is he really after
[33:28] he's after that wife
[33:31] he is after that wife but he traveled
[33:34] through these avenues
[33:36] and he'll bring down that woman to make
[33:38] her dress a certain way he'll bring down
[33:40] that man to make him lust after that
[33:42] woman just to get to that wife
[33:45] why because now she's going to pour that
[33:47] spirit into those children
[33:50] i can destroy the whole family
[33:56] but at some point
[33:58] at some point
[34:00] if that man
[34:02] would have looked at that woman that was
[34:03] dressing that way
[34:05] and not saw the woman
[34:07] but see the spirit
[34:09] that's motivating her
[34:11] and say i have to attack the spirit
[34:14] and go down on his knees
[34:16] and say lord anoint my eyes
[34:19] help me o father god
[34:21] he put the enemy to a flight
[34:24] turn his head
[34:26] if he can recognize that there is a
[34:29] spirit from the pits of hell a man that
[34:32] has caused her to dress that way he
[34:34] caused her to dress that way a man to
[34:37] influence you
[34:39] a man to get you if he can get you he
[34:42] can get your wife if he can get the wife
[34:44] he can get the children and for
[34:46] generations and generations and
[34:49] generations
[34:56] portals
[34:57] into other worlds
[35:00] i want us to understand
[35:03] that these things are temporal we have
[35:04] to get to a point
[35:06] in our thinking and in our mind and in
[35:08] our understanding that what we see
[35:15] is not real
[35:18] but it's what we don't see
[35:20] is where it really lies
[35:24] we influence one way or the other
[35:28] amen
[35:29] but we have to get to a point
[35:32] through a portal
[35:34] through a portal
[35:36] into another world
[35:38] which is a heavenly world
[35:41] the same way that baby
[35:43] must come through that portal
[35:46] amen
[35:47] it's
[35:48] water blood
[35:51] then life
[35:52] the same way
[35:54] the christian must come through
[35:57] be baptized
[35:59] through sanctification
[36:01] baptism sanctification and then the holy
[36:04] ghost
[36:05] amen to take it to live
[36:07] amen and did not no no no no no no just
[36:10] like that child you have to be developed
[36:13] that child don't come out and come into
[36:15] this world and perfect
[36:18] many times that child tried to walk and
[36:20] he'll stumble and fall
[36:22] but
[36:23] apparently okay get back up try it again
[36:26] i think i saw a little something with a
[36:27] fella back there was standing up
[36:29] christmas morning one morning or
[36:30] something
[36:31] amen i was sharing with brother simba i
[36:33] can still remember the first time
[36:35] my son walked
[36:37] my wife and i was at a convention church
[36:39] convention we just had a wonderful
[36:41] church service and we came back up to
[36:43] our hotel room and we sat him down on
[36:46] the floor and he's crawling and he had
[36:48] by that time learned how to pull himself
[36:49] up and all of a sudden he pulled himself
[36:52] up and he took a few steps i don't think
[36:54] we went to bed until late that night
[36:56] because we were so excited that he took
[36:57] steps
[36:59] i can still almost remember what we were
[37:01] wearing
[37:03] it was it was it's just a wonderful time
[37:07] but he's developed now to where he can
[37:09] walk work and take care of himself and
[37:12] things of that nature but that's good in
[37:14] this dimension
[37:16] but we still have to
[37:18] develop
[37:19] i still need development
[37:22] you never stop
[37:24] developing
[37:25] amen why because we're trying to go into
[37:28] another world
[37:29] we're trying to our
[37:31] our faculties our thinking and
[37:33] everything that within us to to be
[37:36] translated
[37:38] amen into another world
[37:41] amen that we're in this world but we're
[37:43] not of this world
[37:45] our mind and the way we do things people
[37:47] are amazed

[39:09] education
[39:10] i don't rely everything on education i
[39:13] rely on my god
[39:18] she began to tell me that she believed
[39:20] in parallel worlds and different things
[39:22] of that nature i say well i tell you
[39:24] what if you believe in that
[39:27] you you just keep on and just cause it's
[39:29] the real it's certainly real
[39:33] certainly real
[39:35] hey man so going on here hey man talking
[39:38] about portals i just want to nail this
[39:40] down
[39:41] let's see here i don't know where
[39:43] my time is
[39:46] pardon me
[39:50] amen
[39:55] oh did it go off already
[39:58] well
[39:59] let me just
[40:00] a few quotes
[40:02] i'm sorry a few quotes brother branham
[40:05] um
[40:06] often referred to this
[40:09] amen um one of the things here i have he
[40:13] often talked about this in a song one of
[40:15] the songs says but there is a land
[40:18] beyond the river
[40:20] that they call that sweet forever
[40:24] and we only reach that shore
[40:28] by a faith decree
[40:30] one by one we gain that portal
[40:34] there to dwell
[40:35] with the immortals someday they'll ring
[40:39] those golden bells for you
[40:41] and for me
[40:43] you see uh uh
[40:45] uh
[40:47] i'd like to just just
[40:48] a portal
[40:50] amen amen uh
[40:57] amen
[40:58] so we experienced
[41:00] by the experience of the prophet and by
[41:03] the teaching of the message
[41:05] we've allowed us to glimpse into the
[41:08] other world of science
[41:11] looking at the moon through a telescope
[41:14] but the message of this day
[41:17] it is not just viewing a viewing window
[41:21] that we can look through
[41:23] to let us see into the world
[41:26] but it has advanced us into
[41:29] that world
[41:30] so we're going it's it's it's it's i was
[41:33] just sharing with my wife
[41:34] it's much more a man
[41:37] of us being able to look into that world
[41:39] science
[41:41] and technology
[41:43] has moved us to a place
[41:48] that we can we can we can we can see in
[41:52] real time
[41:54] through other dimensions we can be
[41:56] teleported in real time
[41:59] through an image
[42:03] our cell phones we have camera view or
[42:06] where we no longer just can just hold
[42:07] the phone to our ear but we can look at
[42:09] the person
[42:11] and what is actually happening someone
[42:13] in another
[42:15] state country or wherever a man can be
[42:18] looking at their phone and you can
[42:21] literally be seeing what they're in real
[42:24] time
[42:26] so what's happening is that the image
[42:28] man that that is picked up by the camera
[42:30] of the phone
[42:32] is being teleported it is going into
[42:35] another world
[42:36] a world that you cannot see
[42:38] it is a
[42:39] information
[42:40] superhighway
[42:41] through the fourth dimension
[42:43] through digital technology and being
[42:45] transposed to your phone in another
[42:48] place
[42:49] you can see it amen but it's just not
[42:52] coming out at you yet
[42:55] but see
[42:56] that's what christ did
[42:58] the same
[42:59] technology
[43:01] but he was able to take it a little
[43:02] further
[43:03] and be real
[43:06] touch me
[43:08] feel my hands
[43:11] but they've got a little bit of it
[43:13] through science
[43:15] amen
[43:16] but we'll take it once we
[43:19] get that glorified body
[43:21] amen and all to another whole level
[43:25] amen but what am i i i'll leave you with
[43:28] this i'll leave you with this
[43:30] the gist of it my brothers and sisters

[43:35] different points
[43:37] that i could bring out on this subject
[43:40] amen
[43:41] is to
[43:43] the things our
[43:45] our battle
[43:47] is not in front of us

[44:13] be in
[44:16] insulted or offended you in any way
[44:22] our battle
[44:23] is against the demonic spirits
[44:26] and you can't fight demonic spirits
[44:30] with carnal weapons
[44:32] and keep yourself guarded
[44:35] that those
[44:37] malice
[44:39] hate
[44:40] envy
[44:42] keep yourself guarded that those spirits
[44:45] don't affect you

[44:54] dimension to affect us
[44:57] but we're through that he's using that
[45:00] to
