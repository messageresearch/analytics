[54:09] I mentioned on yesterday that uh brother
[54:12] Mike I have watched him for years and uh
[54:16] brother Mike when he uh when the Lord
[54:19] just really got a hold of his life he
[54:21] stepped into just being the musician for
[54:22] the church and uh you know that was a
[54:25] time in the church had gone through
[54:26] transition they needed a new position to
[54:28] kind of Step Up and brother Mike came
[54:29] right in and he was so faithful uh just
[54:32] keeping the music going and then from
[54:34] there he transitioned to being a song
[54:35] leader and he was a I mean a wonderful

[54:40] good atmosphere and uh and then uh as uh
[54:44] time would have it he started
[54:46] ministering so uh when I just looked at

[56:22] all right all right uh turn with me to
[56:25] Luke chapter four
[56:27] and man Luke chapter four we have been
[56:30] uh in our journey here and I I I forgot
[56:34] to mention thank you for the specials
[56:36] that went forth this morning really
[56:37] really appreciate uh that wonderful
[56:40] anointing on that in the song Service as
[56:42] well thank you brother Solomon for
[56:44] leading us
[56:45] uh Luke chapter four I am I've been
[56:48] working through this uh passage of
[56:51] scriptures and and I I thought that I
[56:54] might come to an end today I'm I don't
[56:56] know uh how that would go it I think
[56:59] it's going to depend on y'all amen uh if
[57:03] uh uh if y'all pull me off these notes
[57:06] we won't we won't end today but if y'all
[57:09] keep me on the notes then we'll just
[57:12] keep going as long as the Lord uh would
[57:14] allow but let's just take our scripture
[57:17] anyway and just uh read from Luke 4
[57:20] verse 16. it says and he came to
[57:23] Nazareth
[57:24] where he had been brought up and as his
[57:28] custom was
[57:30] uh he went into the synagogue on the
[57:33] Sabbath day and stood up for to read and
[57:37] there was delivered unto him the book of
[57:40] the prophet isaiahs and when he had
[57:42] opened the book he found the place where
[57:44] it was written uh the spirit of the Lord
[57:47] is upon me because he hath anointed me
[57:50] to preach the gospel to the poor he has
[57:54] sent me to heal the brokenhearted to
[57:56] preach Deliverance to the captives and
[57:57] recovering a sight to the blind to say
[58:00] that Liberty had them at a bruise now we
[58:02] we know that he is referring back to a
[58:05] prophecy that Isaiah wrote and uh in the
[58:10] book of Isaiah 61 and I mentioned to you
[58:13] all as we were going through this series
[58:15] when you look in the Old Testament the
[58:18] name Jesus is not found in the Old
[58:23] Testament
[58:24] Hallelujah so it takes a revelation to
[58:28] understand
[58:29] that uh as Jesus is reading this he is
[58:33] the Fulfillment of what he's reading
[58:37] come on
[58:39] verse 19 says to preach the acceptable
[58:42] year the Lord and he closed the book
[58:44] and he gave it again to the minister
[58:47] and sat down and I I want you to always
[58:50] remember the prophet told us this was
[58:53] the greatest
[58:55] anointing that was ever on anybody is
[58:59] when Jesus read the scripture
[59:03] my God close the book
[59:07] and spoke in tongues
[59:11] no no jumping no shouting he sat down
[59:16] and that was the greatest anointing ever
[59:18] on anybody
[59:19] look at this the reason it was so great
[59:21] is because he knew who he was in
[59:22] Scripture
[59:25] oh come on somebody and the eyes of all
[59:28] them that were in the synagogue were
[59:31] fastened on him and he began to say unto
[59:35] them
[59:36] um
[59:36] this day
[59:38] is this scripture fulfilled in your ears
[59:43] and all bear him witnessed and wandered
[59:46] at the gracious Words which proceeded
[59:48] out of his mouth and they said is not
[59:50] this Joseph's son
[59:53] and he said unto them ye will surely say
[59:55] unto me this proverb physician heal
[59:57] thyself whatsoever We Have Heard done in
[59:59] Capernaum do also here in thy country
[1:00:03] and he said verily I say unto you no
[1:00:05] Prophet is accepted in his own country
[1:00:10] it's uh repeating itself again amen but
[1:00:14] I tell you of a truth many widows are in
[1:00:18] Israel in the days of Elias when the
[1:00:20] heaven was shut up three years and six
[1:00:22] months when Great Famine was throughout
[1:00:24] all the land but unto none of them was
[1:00:26] Elias sent save Sarepta a city of sidon
[1:00:30] into a woman that was a widow and many
[1:00:33] lepers were in Israel in a time of
[1:00:34] elysius or Elisha the prophet and none
[1:00:38] of them was cleansed Naaman the Syrian
[1:00:41] and all the in the synagogue when they
[1:00:45] heard these things
[1:00:48] were feel
[1:00:50] with Wrath
[1:00:52] ain't it amazing you can go to church
[1:00:55] and leave
[1:00:58] mad
[1:01:00] brother Branham told us that you leave
[1:01:03] one or two ways a better Christian or
[1:01:07] worse
[1:01:08] let's pray father we thank you for the
[1:01:10] reading of the word
[1:01:12] we trusted the Holy Spirit would now
[1:01:15] come and reveal to us the things that we
[1:01:19] have need of
[1:01:20] for this hour
[1:01:22] we trust that you will take control over
[1:01:25] this portion of the service as you have
[1:01:28] already demonstrated that you're here in
[1:01:31] the worship
[1:01:33] through the the song leading and father
[1:01:36] the specials and just the musicians Lord
[1:01:39] just a real wonderful wonderful
[1:01:41] atmospheres easy for us to to preach in
[1:01:44] the atmosphere like this so we asked God
[1:01:47] that you would take control of every
[1:01:48] thought not just the thoughts that I
[1:01:50] present but the thoughts that are
[1:01:51] received take control of it father and
[1:01:54] get all the glory in Jesus name we pray
[1:01:57] amen amen you can be seated
[1:02:00] We are continuing our journey
[1:02:03] with
[1:02:05] God is in his man
[1:02:09] God is in his man
[1:02:13] um we started this by uh bringing out a
[1:02:18] number of things and if you all had a
[1:02:19] chance to hear the tape on uh Friday
[1:02:22] night uh you would have heard brother
[1:02:24] Brandon dealing with these same subjects
[1:02:26] uh that that that I have been talking
[1:02:29] about and I was I was just so blessed
[1:02:31] like wow we right in there right uh so
[1:02:35] uh just a just a blessing but brother
[1:02:37] Branham you know said he wanted to talk
[1:02:39] about Gardner's people God and his son
[1:02:42] uh God in his Universe you know God in
[1:02:45] his word uh you know we we have gone
[1:02:47] through all of that God and God in
[1:02:49] nature and I mean if you're looking for
[1:02:51] God you'll find them anywhere and
[1:02:53] everywhere if you're truly looking for
[1:02:55] God all right but I wanted to also just
[1:02:58] bring God is in his man amen uh uh as we
[1:03:02] just kind of uh work our way through
[1:03:04] this and let me just start with just a
[1:03:06] few quotes here that we'll read and uh
[1:03:09] first one is coming out of the sermon
[1:03:10] Moses
[1:03:12] uh brother Brandon preaches this message
[1:03:14] in Houston Texas and uh he makes a
[1:03:18] statement here in this sermon Moses it
[1:03:21] says and when he became the age of 40
[1:03:25] years God called him for his purpose
[1:03:30] and he thought surely that the people of
[1:03:35] Israel would understand what he was sent
[1:03:37] for
[1:03:38] but the people misunderstood Moses amen
[1:03:43] and let me just not uh leave it there
[1:03:46] because there's a misunderstanding today
[1:03:49] and uh the people misunderstand who
[1:03:53] brother Branham is
[1:03:55] let me just let me just just just just
[1:03:57] hit the nail on the head the people
[1:04:00] misunderstand who brother Branham is and
[1:04:03] I know sometimes he's not presented the
[1:04:05] right way to people uh but but we need
[1:04:08] to understand just as God sent Moses as
[1:04:11] a prophet God has sent brother Branham
[1:04:13] as a prophet amen so here it says but
[1:04:16] the people misunderstood Moses now get
[1:04:18] this close friends the hardest thing
[1:04:20] that God has ever had to deal with his
[1:04:24] people is to get one mortal to believe
[1:04:28] another
[1:04:30] that's the hardest thing is it's for
[1:04:32] somebody to believe God is using this
[1:04:34] individual
[1:04:35] hallelujah amen that's the hardest thing
[1:04:38] God has ever done uh ever has done to
[1:04:41] get one mortal to believe well they
[1:04:44] believe Jesus would have been the son
[1:04:46] they couldn't believe he was the son of
[1:04:48] God they believed God but he said uh him
[1:04:52] being a man makes himself equal with God
[1:04:54] how could he a poor peasant how could he
[1:04:58] be a man born in a manger a background
[1:05:01] like he had for from a poor family
[1:05:04] raised up one garment on him now not
[1:05:07] brother bran I'm giving you all this
[1:05:09] description you can imagine when he's
[1:05:11] when Jesus is standing there reading the
[1:05:13] scripture amen and they look and say now
[1:05:15] it's not this Joseph's son I mean and
[1:05:18] not only are they not they're thinking
[1:05:20] it's not this Joseph something thinking
[1:05:21] this he got one garment he's from a poor
[1:05:25] family amen uh he he lived the way he
[1:05:28] did not even a place to lay his head how
[1:05:30] could this man say that the scripture is
[1:05:32] being fulfilled by him
[1:05:34] it's hard it's God it's difficult for
[1:05:37] God to get one more to believe another
[1:05:41] look at this look at this he goes on to
[1:05:43] say that he says live the way he did
[1:05:44] even not even a place to lay his head
[1:05:47] foxes has danced the birds of the air
[1:05:49] has Nest but the son of man uh how could
[1:05:52] that man be the Son of God how could it
[1:05:54] be what he claimed to be but he was
[1:05:57] wasn't he he was he was
[1:06:00] you know I was um just just you know
[1:06:04] coming through this because God was in
[1:06:06] the man Christ Jesus reconciling the
[1:06:09] world to himself the Bible tells us that
[1:06:11] and uh and unfortunately people
[1:06:13] misunderstood who Jesus was in his day
[1:06:15] they still misunderstand Jesus today
[1:06:19] glory to God you know uh I I've heard
[1:06:22] people say that you know what I'm just
[1:06:23] going to preach Jesus
[1:06:25] I'm not gonna preach this message but
[1:06:27] I'm a preach Jesus and my question is
[1:06:30] which Jesus are you preaching
[1:06:34] which Jesus because Paul actually says
[1:06:36] it in the script it says they they they
[1:06:38] preach another Jesus so which Jesus are
[1:06:41] you preaching you got to understand
[1:06:43] something yes there was a Jesus that
[1:06:46] died and rose again some 2000 years ago
[1:06:48] and and he redeemed us back to God
[1:06:51] through his blood that that is that's
[1:06:53] the same Jesus that is walking through
[1:06:56] the seven golden candlesticks
[1:06:58] so so where's Jesus are you preaching
[1:07:00] are you stopping at 2 000 years ago uh
[1:07:03] are you able to come forward and see
[1:07:04] what he's done in this day
[1:07:08] come on somebody
[1:07:10] hallelujah hallelujah you know I was
[1:07:13] um this whole thought came to me and I
[1:07:16] thought it'd just be what just one
[1:07:17] sermon but I was I was sitting in the
[1:07:20] courtroom months ago
[1:07:22] and as I was sitting there in the
[1:07:24] courtroom
[1:07:26] um you know just just supporting someone
[1:07:28] a man uh I I just began to observe some
[1:07:32] things and I realized how serious this
[1:07:35] was uh you know this this person is
[1:07:37] being accused of this and and and and
[1:07:39] their fate is in the hands of a judge A
[1:07:45] man also in the hands of a jewelry uh
[1:07:49] about 12 people that's been selected to
[1:07:51] make a decision as to whether you're
[1:07:52] guilty or you're innocent right and uh
[1:07:55] and and I looked at that and I said well
[1:07:57] my goodness your your life could change
[1:08:00] based on the decision of one of these
[1:08:02] people here in this courtroom and uh and
[1:08:04] then on top of that I realized that you
[1:08:06] had you know a one person defending you
[1:08:09] amen and then you had multiple people
[1:08:11] accusing you right and as you as you
[1:08:14] said into a situation like that you know
[1:08:16] like man and the way that they would
[1:08:18] present their arguments to accuse you
[1:08:20] they went they would have people leaving
[1:08:22] that courtroom and their mind like oh my
[1:08:24] goodness this this case right here I
[1:08:27] didn't know all of that and like oh this
[1:08:29] comes I don't know how this gonna work
[1:08:30] out they would confuse you like that
[1:08:33] hallelujah hallelujah you know and as I
[1:08:36] said then I began to go through the
[1:08:37] process I begin to think there is a
[1:08:40] higher Court than this
[1:08:44] there's a much higher Court than this
[1:08:46] and and if you ever have to come before
[1:08:48] God in his court you gotta understand
[1:08:51] what we have in this Earthly system amen
[1:08:53] it's uh it's symbolic of what we have in
[1:08:56] the Heavenly the unfortunate thing there
[1:08:58] won't be 12 people sitting there judging
[1:09:00] you and making a decision God has the
[1:09:03] final word in his courts
[1:09:06] hallelujah hallelujah amen you want to
[1:09:09] make sure you're standing on his side
[1:09:11] and the only way you can get on his side
[1:09:13] is accepting what he did at the cross
[1:09:17] I thought about a man of scripture a man
[1:09:21] that kind of goes with that Revelation
[1:09:22] 21 and 8. I want to just bring this in
[1:09:26] before we go further Revelation 21 and
[1:09:28] 8. uh it says um
[1:09:32] amen but the fearful
[1:09:34] glory to God and unbelieving
[1:09:38] and the Abominable Revelation 21-8 and
[1:09:41] the Abominable and murders and
[1:09:44] whoremongers and Sorcerers and idolaters
[1:09:46] and all liars to have their pardon
[1:09:49] liquid which burned with fire and
[1:09:51] brimstone which is the second death now
[1:09:53] you know I wanted to just kind of stop
[1:09:55] there Amen on that on that word the
[1:09:57] fearful and unbelieving
[1:10:00] I'm believing in what
[1:10:03] you know see the let me just take my
[1:10:06] time here because in in a denomination
[1:10:09] of church they would read that scripture
[1:10:10] and say if you don't believe in Jesus
[1:10:13] you'll end up in in hell
[1:10:15] right Hallelujah but I want to take it a
[1:10:17] little further than that if you don't
[1:10:19] believe in the reveal word for your day
[1:10:24] I'm believing in what I'm believing in
[1:10:27] the revealed word for your day
[1:10:30] good God Almighty amen that's dangerous
[1:10:34] Crown to be on
[1:10:36] when God promises something in the
[1:10:38] scripture and then God manifestes that
[1:10:41] in the scripture and then you choose to
[1:10:43] disbelieve that you are on dangerous
[1:10:46] crowns
[1:10:49] but the fearful and the unbelieving and
[1:10:51] the Abominable and murderers and
[1:10:55] whoremongers
[1:10:56] amen people committing uh fornication
[1:10:59] can't get control over that spirit that
[1:11:02] that's that'll lead you to hell
[1:11:04] amen and Sorcerers and idolators
[1:11:07] anything you put before God is idolatry
[1:11:10] sometimes you put your family before God
[1:11:13] you put your carbs in your in your jobs
[1:11:15] and your careers before God that is
[1:11:18] idolatry
[1:11:20] all right amen he says idolators and all
[1:11:24] liars
[1:11:25] hello somebody
[1:11:27] I I that that one right there uh from
[1:11:29] the youngest to the oldest all liars
[1:11:32] ain't no such thing as no white lie and
[1:11:35] black lie
[1:11:36] Allah is a lie and then you choose to be
[1:11:40] a liar
[1:11:41] you know what your end result is
[1:11:44] you know Christians even lie
[1:11:46] lie on their taxes
[1:11:52] Liars will end up in the Lake of Fire
[1:11:56] all right amen all liars should have
[1:11:59] their part in the lake which burned with
[1:12:00] fire and brimstone which is the second
[1:12:02] death
[1:12:05] my warning Amen to people that hear this
[1:12:09] sermon
[1:12:10] um don't fail to see what God is doing
[1:12:13] in your day I I brought that scripture
[1:12:15] to you the last time in the book of Acts
[1:12:17] our worker work in your day and though
[1:12:19] it would told you you still wouldn't
[1:12:21] believe
[1:12:22] right I'll work a working good day you
[1:12:23] want to know what God is doing today all
[1:12:26] right let's keep going hearing the
[1:12:28] message faith is the substance
[1:12:30] God is in his man
[1:12:32] God is in his man
[1:12:34] all right faith is a substance he says
[1:12:36] and when Moses came to the age of
[1:12:39] maturity he went out and seen two
[1:12:42] Egyptians mistreating a Hebrew and he
[1:12:45] slew the Egyptians and buried them and
[1:12:47] the next day when he met the Hebrews
[1:12:50] driving among one another while they
[1:12:52] said will you kill us as you did the
[1:12:54] Egyptian now look be quiet people Moses
[1:12:58] the very deliverer God's gift to the
[1:13:02] people they did not understand him amen
[1:13:06] you see what I mean uh they did not
[1:13:09] understand Moses and Moses thought
[1:13:12] surely that they would understand that
[1:13:15] he was their gift to deliver them look
[1:13:18] at this but they did not understand
[1:13:22] and now friends don't get me wrong may I
[1:13:25] say this was reverence in my heart
[1:13:26] knowing that I am eternity I am an
[1:13:30] eternity-bound person that'll stand
[1:13:32] before judgment someday
[1:13:34] thousands of people are missing their
[1:13:39] gift
[1:13:41] can I say that again
[1:13:43] thousands of people are missing their
[1:13:47] gifts see they can't understand it and
[1:13:50] they'll look and say oh he's just a man
[1:13:53] oh my God he's talking about his
[1:13:55] ministry now oh he's just a man that's
[1:13:58] true was it God or Moses that delivered
[1:14:01] the people
[1:14:03] if you read the scripture you know the
[1:14:05] Lord did that thing
[1:14:06] all right was it God or Moses that
[1:14:09] delivered the people it was God in Moses
[1:14:14] see he says they cry for the deliverer
[1:14:17] and when God sent to deliver to them
[1:14:19] they failed to see because it was by a
[1:14:21] man but it wasn't a man it was God in
[1:14:27] the man
[1:14:29] like that
[1:14:30] see if we can catch God and and and and
[1:14:33] and and and Moses we can catch God in
[1:14:36] his Prophet yesterday a brother made a
[1:14:38] statement
[1:14:39] and uh and I was just blessed by you
[1:14:41] know a couple statements uh one was
[1:14:44] saying you know there are certain things
[1:14:45] that brother Brandon taught that we
[1:14:47] might not find in the scripture
[1:14:49] and if we went to a denomination person
[1:14:51] we and we shared that with them they
[1:14:53] they might not be able to accept it
[1:14:54] because it's not in the scripture so
[1:14:56] when the brothers actually give us an
[1:14:58] example of what you what you're talking
[1:14:59] about there say well uh brother Brandon
[1:15:02] said that David had 500 wives give me
[1:15:05] the scripture on that
[1:15:06] I say brother you got a good point there
[1:15:09] I don't think I read that one yet in the
[1:15:11] scripture I say but here's ears here's
[1:15:13] my response to it any person even a
[1:15:16] denomination are y'all y'all stay with
[1:15:18] me now because it's gonna be good it's
[1:15:19] gonna be good here's my response to it
[1:15:21] if you believe Genesis
[1:15:26] if you believe the story in Genesis and
[1:15:30] what happened in the Garden of Eden you
[1:15:33] had to believe a prophet
[1:15:37] you had to believe what a prophet said
[1:15:39] the prophet Moses wrote what happened in
[1:15:44] Genesis and he was not there
[1:15:52] amen you say you going back to the pot
[1:15:57] if you believe Genesis you have to
[1:16:00] believe a prophet
[1:16:02] all the first five books of the Bible
[1:16:04] was written by Moses he was nowhere to
[1:16:06] be found how did Moses know what
[1:16:08] happened in the garden
[1:16:10] and you believe it
[1:16:14] amen come on somebody if we believe what
[1:16:17] Moses wrote there if I can believe Moses
[1:16:20] why can't I believe God sent a prophet
[1:16:23] in this day and told us that David had
[1:16:26] 500 wives
[1:16:28] it's the same God
[1:16:30] using his gifts it's God in the man
[1:16:36] the brother uh
[1:16:39] my God you know we as we were just kind
[1:16:41] of sharing you know uh you know it'll
[1:16:45] come back to me it's a thought that just
[1:16:46] that that brother said that just blessed
[1:16:48] my heart and it'll come back to me amen
[1:16:51] I I I I didn't write it down so uh
[1:16:54] that's what happened when you get over
[1:16:55] 50. uh
[1:16:58] it'll come back to me let's just let's
[1:17:00] just just stay with this God is in his
[1:17:02] man God God is in his man God is God and
[1:17:05] His man we're not following Brother
[1:17:07] Branham just to say we're following
[1:17:08] brother Brandon we see God in the
[1:17:11] ministry of this man
[1:17:16] brother random said they miss their
[1:17:18] their gift
[1:17:20] they thousands are missing their gift
[1:17:22] that's what he said and I want to say in
[1:17:24] the days of Noah they missed their gift
[1:17:27] in the the days of Jesus they missed
[1:17:31] their gift
[1:17:32] amen Paul actually tells us this how
[1:17:36] they missed a gift in the days of Jesus
[1:17:38] here here Jesus coming as a I mean the
[1:17:41] greatest delivery of all and they missed
[1:17:43] it they misunderstood it people are
[1:17:45] missing it today but Paul says it here
[1:17:47] in Acts 13 let's just read a man a few
[1:17:50] verses here on acts 13
[1:17:52] verse 35 uh Paul is telling us how they
[1:17:55] missed the gift don't don't miss it
[1:17:58] don't miss it in this day don't miss it
[1:18:00] don't miss what God is doing in your day
[1:18:02] what God has done hallelujah we gathered
[1:18:05] here we Fellowship around a man a reveal
[1:18:08] word for this day God sent us a prophet
[1:18:11] and he gave us he gave us the truth of
[1:18:13] the scripture hallelujah amen so look
[1:18:16] look acts 13 verse 35 says wherefore
[1:18:19] saith he uh wherefore he saith also in
[1:18:22] another Psalm Thou shalt not suffer
[1:18:25] thine Holy One to see corruption but
[1:18:28] David after he had served his own
[1:18:29] Generation by the will of God fell on
[1:18:31] asleep and was laid unto his father's
[1:18:34] and saw corruption but he whom God
[1:18:37] raised again saw no corruption but be it
[1:18:41] known uh unto you therefore men and
[1:18:43] brother that through this man is
[1:18:47] preached unto you the forgiveness of sin
[1:18:49] so Paul is in church trying to work with
[1:18:51] them some more they've already rejected
[1:18:53] them they've already put them on the
[1:18:54] cross and they still go on to church
[1:18:57] yes sir
[1:18:58] after rejecting the word they still in
[1:19:01] church
[1:19:03] Faithfully serving the lord at least
[1:19:05] they think they are it's the same thing
[1:19:07] today right and here they're still in
[1:19:10] church and Paul is coming right back
[1:19:12] amen with the same gospel trying to get
[1:19:14] them to see something
[1:19:15] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah says
[1:19:18] being known unto you therefore men and
[1:19:20] Brethren that through this man is
[1:19:22] preaching to you the Forgiveness of sins
[1:19:24] and by him all that believe are
[1:19:26] Justified from all things from which ye
[1:19:29] cannot be justified by the law of Moses
[1:19:32] it says beware therefore lest that come
[1:19:35] upon you which is spoken of in the
[1:19:37] prophets behold ye despise us and wander
[1:19:40] and perish for our work a work in your
[1:19:43] days a work which ye shall and no wise
[1:19:45] believe though a man declaring unto you
[1:19:48] look at it he says and when the Jews
[1:19:49] were gone out of synagogue the Gentiles
[1:19:52] were sought that these words might be
[1:19:53] preached to them the next Sabbath I said
[1:19:55] it before I'll say it again for everyone
[1:19:57] that's rejecting it God got somebody
[1:19:59] else that's going to receive it
[1:20:02] so which side you're gonna be on
[1:20:05] glory to God everyone that want to
[1:20:07] reject it God got somebody to take your
[1:20:09] place
[1:20:11] hallelujah
[1:20:12] amen amen in the verse 43 now when the
[1:20:16] congregation was broken up
[1:20:17] many of the Jews in religious processed
[1:20:20] followed Paul and Barnabas who's
[1:20:22] speaking to them persuaded them to
[1:20:23] continue in the grace of God and the
[1:20:25] next Sabbath day came almost a whole
[1:20:27] city together to heal the word of God
[1:20:29] but when the Jews saw the multitudes
[1:20:31] they were still With Envy upset because
[1:20:34] people came to church
[1:20:36] fill with envy and speak against those
[1:20:39] things which are spoken by Paul
[1:20:41] contradicting and blasphemy watch this
[1:20:44] then Paul and Barnabas wax bold
[1:20:47] and said it was necessary that the word
[1:20:50] of God should first have been spoken to
[1:20:51] you but seeing you put it from you and
[1:20:54] judge yourselves I'm worthy of
[1:20:55] everlasting life Lo we turn to the
[1:21:00] Gentiles now now this is when the gospel
[1:21:02] was actually released to us to be able
[1:21:04] to receive at this moment in church
[1:21:06] history but we are living in a time
[1:21:09] where now the gospel is turning from the
[1:21:12] Gentiles and going back to the Jews and
[1:21:16] we find the same type of rejection of
[1:21:18] the word of God this day as it was in
[1:21:21] that day
[1:21:22] man
[1:21:24] I want to say you know there's somebody
[1:21:26] that's going to receive it
[1:21:27] when we look in the the the the the the
[1:21:30] Pharisees and Sadducees they had a
[1:21:33] problem accepting it and even though you
[1:21:36] know they were rejecting there was at
[1:21:37] least one that wanted to receive it
[1:21:39] we don't even know her name
[1:21:41] we just know her condition
[1:21:43] and we know where she went at certain
[1:21:45] times a day because she couldn't go with
[1:21:48] everybody else her condition would not
[1:21:50] allow her to go to the well amen with
[1:21:52] all the other virgins that were coming
[1:21:54] her lifestyle was a little different
[1:21:57] come on somebody amen all we know all we
[1:22:00] know her her title is called the woman
[1:22:03] at the well can you imagine yourself
[1:22:06] getting to heaven and this lady walking
[1:22:08] up to you say I was the woman
[1:22:11] at the well I thank God for her story
[1:22:15] because she had something on the inside
[1:22:17] of her could identify with the Messiah
[1:22:22] when everybody else can see if this lady
[1:22:24] could
[1:22:28] all right about a a man and from that
[1:22:30] time I just I just love it I
[1:22:33] love this I love this look at look at
[1:22:36] look at this and and
[1:22:37] and uh
[1:22:39] and from that time it says
[1:22:41] so he was only 30 or 32 years old and a
[1:22:44] young beautiful woman come up one day to
[1:22:46] the well where he was sitting tired and
[1:22:49] he said to her woman bring me a drink
[1:22:51] she said it's not customary for you to
[1:22:54] ask me such a thing as that I'm a
[1:22:57] Samaritan you're a Jew segregation he
[1:23:00] said but if you knew who you were
[1:23:02] talking to what was that woman doing she
[1:23:04] was meeting
[1:23:06] God where was God in Jesus she was
[1:23:11] meaning God she met a man but it wasn't
[1:23:15] a man that she was meeting it was God in
[1:23:20] the man she was meeting see God is in
[1:23:24] this man it was God in the man she was
[1:23:26] meeting god brother Branham said God let
[1:23:29] that soak in
[1:23:31] the scripture said you've entertained
[1:23:33] angels not knowing what you were doing
[1:23:35] unaware it same as Abraham entertain
[1:23:38] angels and immedially after the angel
[1:23:40] left and had performed a miracle before
[1:23:42] him he called the man God Elohim
[1:23:45] the almighty God sitting there eating
[1:23:48] steak sandwiches drinking milk from the
[1:23:49] cow eating cakes and he was almighty God
[1:23:51] the woman little did she know look what
[1:23:54] it done for Abraham then it changed him
[1:23:56] and Sarah from the old man and old woman
[1:23:58] for a hundred years back to young young
[1:24:00] man and young woman uh that brought
[1:24:02] forth Isaac they met God they that's
[1:24:05] what the that's what dumbed the
[1:24:07] difference it says this immoral woman
[1:24:09] she met Jesus and she spoke to him watch
[1:24:13] how he made himself known he said woman
[1:24:15] go get your husband and come here now
[1:24:17] watch how he made himself known this is
[1:24:19] so important so important as we as we
[1:24:21] get deep into the sermon we gotta we're
[1:24:23] gonna I hope we can connect all these
[1:24:25] dots for you but this is important this
[1:24:27] is the Messiah sign
[1:24:31] this is how we know Messiah is a
[1:24:33] Monsters come on Church I'ma say that
[1:24:35] again the way he handles this woman
[1:24:38] is the sign of the Messiah
[1:24:41] so when we see amen those same things
[1:24:44] happening glory to God Amen in brother
[1:24:48] Brandon's Ministry then we know it's the
[1:24:50] same Jesus
[1:24:52] now it just came back to me
[1:24:54] it just came back to me the thing I said
[1:24:56] got away from me where am I just uh let
[1:25:00] me just leave me right there uh one of
[1:25:03] the brothers that shared who says there
[1:25:04] was a Brother start going around say you
[1:25:06] know the the story in Genesis he was a
[1:25:09] believer in the message he said you know
[1:25:10] the story in Genesis
[1:25:12] um
[1:25:13] it can't be true
[1:25:15] he said no I can't be true and he says
[1:25:17] uh the reason being how would Moses be
[1:25:20] able to write that how would Moses know
[1:25:22] what happened in the Garden of Eden how
[1:25:23] would Moses this and how Moses it says
[1:25:25] he wasn't even there it can't be true
[1:25:27] it's just a fiction story or something
[1:25:29] that they made up so uh the brother
[1:25:31] responds to that's why you gotta you
[1:25:33] can't approach this message from your
[1:25:35] intellect
[1:25:38] you need revelation
[1:25:40] pray for Revelation Revelation is
[1:25:43] something totally different from
[1:25:44] intellectual understanding Hallelujah
[1:25:46] and and see intellectual understanding
[1:25:48] uh if somebody can show you that one
[1:25:51] plus one equal two and then they come in
[1:25:54] and throw some other equation on you'll
[1:25:56] be all all confused in your intellect
[1:25:58] right but but when it comes to
[1:26:00] Revelation nobody can take that from you
[1:26:03] right and and so what brother say he's
[1:26:05] saying he said wow that that does make
[1:26:06] it you know I mean how what Moses wasn't
[1:26:09] that so how did he know God have to show
[1:26:10] them these things and it's and either
[1:26:12] you have to believe that God showed him
[1:26:13] or God didn't show him it was God and
[1:26:14] His man was a brother brother
[1:26:16] responsible since you believe in the
[1:26:17] message saying how was it that brother
[1:26:20] Branham was able to go to City after
[1:26:22] City and tell people their names and the
[1:26:25] addresses
[1:26:29] was that brother Branham doing that or
[1:26:32] was that God well the same God that can
[1:26:35] show a prophet your address
[1:26:39] is the same God that can show Moses what
[1:26:43] happened in the Garden of Eden
[1:26:45] the God we serve
[1:26:50] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah we know
[1:26:52] we stand when it comes to this all right
[1:26:54] let me keep reading now amen look at
[1:26:57] this it says they're more women when she
[1:26:58] met Jesus
[1:27:00] and she spoke to him watch how he made
[1:27:02] himself known he said woman go get your
[1:27:05] husband and come here she said I don't I
[1:27:08] do not have any husband
[1:27:10] first of all she was being truthful
[1:27:13] she wasn't a liar because Liars got to
[1:27:15] have their part in the Lake of Fire she
[1:27:17] wasn't trying to hide nothing from him I
[1:27:19] don't have a husband
[1:27:22] amen he said you said well and from that
[1:27:25] time she was changed Oh What A
[1:27:26] Difference that Jesus when she met him
[1:27:29] there looked like a man and I can
[1:27:32] imagine seeing those big pretty eyes
[1:27:34] tears coming out of them she said sir I
[1:27:37] perceive that you are a prophet but who
[1:27:40] are you Jesus said I am he that speaks
[1:27:42] to you right and from that time from
[1:27:45] that time she had a message to tell the
[1:27:47] world come see a man who told me the
[1:27:50] things I've done the Messiah is on the
[1:27:53] earth she stirred her City a few hours
[1:27:56] before that the city would have laughed
[1:27:59] at her she couldn't even come to the
[1:28:00] well with the rest of the women what
[1:28:02] happened what made the men listen to her
[1:28:04] if you've ever been in the orient they
[1:28:06] wouldn't listen to a woman like that
[1:28:08] some Oriental brother was trying to tell
[1:28:09] me said the woman wasn't a prostitute
[1:28:11] because the men wouldn't have listened
[1:28:13] to I said but brother you fail to see
[1:28:15] she met Christ
[1:28:17] that's what made the difference
[1:28:22] that lady was able to wreck she didn't
[1:28:24] miss the Messiah in her day she didn't
[1:28:27] miss the revealed word in her day she
[1:28:30] caught it glory to God we better catch
[1:28:32] it for our day
[1:28:39] I've had
[1:28:41] people say to me
[1:28:43] that brother Branham is not in the
[1:28:46] scripture
[1:28:47] and this is why it's hard for them to
[1:28:49] believe this message because this he's
[1:28:51] not in the scripture I said
[1:28:53] and I you know I I let people talk and
[1:28:56] express their hearts and everything but
[1:28:58] when you cross the line of
[1:29:01] truth
[1:29:03] we have a problem
[1:29:05] and and I'm gonna just take five
[1:29:08] scriptures today so this is a sermon
[1:29:11] that if somebody tell you that brother
[1:29:13] Brandon was not in scripture I'm going
[1:29:14] to give you five scriptures today not
[1:29:17] that you can prove to people he was in
[1:29:19] the scripture
[1:29:20] Hallelujah I told you earlier the name
[1:29:25] Jesus is not found in the Old Testament
[1:29:27] so how do we know that Jesus was the
[1:29:31] Fulfillment of the things prophesied in
[1:29:33] the Old Testament it's because of the
[1:29:34] works that he manifested
[1:29:38] if you don't believe me
[1:29:40] believe the works
[1:29:41] I'm just I'm gonna just give you five
[1:29:43] scriptures but I'm gonna tell you this
[1:29:44] there are more than these five that
[1:29:48] actually prophesy about brother
[1:29:50] branham's Ministry it does not have his
[1:29:52] name but it does have his ministry
[1:29:55] come on somebody let's start with let's
[1:29:58] start with Malachi four five and six the
[1:30:01] very last scripture in the Old Testament
[1:30:04] we believe this message because it was
[1:30:07] found in Scripture
[1:30:09] Malachi 4 5 and 6. behold
[1:30:13] who is this I will send you who is the I
[1:30:17] who is the I
[1:30:18] the I is God I will send you Elijah the
[1:30:24] prophet before the coming of the great
[1:30:26] and Dreadful day of the Lord now a lot
[1:30:28] of people actually say that this was
[1:30:30] with John the Baptist uh was on Earth
[1:30:32] that was the coming of the great and
[1:30:33] drafted the Lord said really
[1:30:35] Jesus died on the cross was a dreadful
[1:30:39] day no that was a day that brought
[1:30:40] Mancan mankind back in fellowship with
[1:30:43] God that was not a dreadful day that was
[1:30:45] not a judgment day sin was judged
[1:30:49] but mankind wasn't judged on that day
[1:30:51] that was not the great and Dreadful day
[1:30:52] of the Lord the grand Japanese coming
[1:30:54] and it's a future work but before that
[1:30:57] happens God promises to send Elijah
[1:31:00] look at this verse verse verse 6.
[1:31:04] and he shall turn the heart to the
[1:31:06] fathers to the children now if you go
[1:31:07] back and read the scripture you'll find
[1:31:08] that John the Baptist already fulfilled
[1:31:09] that part
[1:31:11] and we know John the Baptist did that
[1:31:12] amen the Bible says he did it amen but
[1:31:15] it also says and the heart that's a
[1:31:17] that's a conjunction that's a second
[1:31:19] ministry that's in the scripture in the
[1:31:21] heart of the children to their fathers
[1:31:22] lest I come and spite the Earth with a
[1:31:24] curse so there's a Ministry coming to
[1:31:25] turn our hearts back to the faith of the
[1:31:27] fathers what is that to turn our hearts
[1:31:29] back to the word of God
[1:31:34] that was brother Brandon's Ministry to
[1:31:35] turn our hearts we're not here to exalt
[1:31:37] brother Brandon we're here to thank God
[1:31:38] that he turned our hearts he did exactly
[1:31:40] what the scripture said now we fought we
[1:31:42] fall in love with Jesus all over again
[1:31:44] through the word
[1:31:46] let me give you another Revelation 10 7.
[1:31:49] last last scripture in the Old Testament
[1:31:51] the last book of the New Testament
[1:31:53] Revelation 10 7 God promises that this
[1:31:55] ministry will come behold but in the
[1:31:57] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[1:32:00] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[1:32:02] of God to be finished as he have
[1:32:04] declared to Servants of prophets amen uh
[1:32:07] uh uh somebody
[1:32:09] you know I I like to just say like this
[1:32:12] uh there won't be any further Revelation
[1:32:15] than what the prophet has already said
[1:32:17] there are no other Ministries coming
[1:32:18] there is no eighth Angel there's no
[1:32:20] ninth Angel there's no tenth Angel
[1:32:21] there's only a seventh angel and the
[1:32:23] seventh angel that was spoken of in
[1:32:26] Revelation 10.
[1:32:28] is the same seventh angel that's spoken
[1:32:31] of in Revelation 3 14.
[1:32:35] let's read that
[1:32:37] Revelation 3 14 and unto the angel of
[1:32:42] the Church of the laodiceans right these
[1:32:45] things saith the amen the faithful and
[1:32:48] the true witness the beginning of the
[1:32:50] creation of God God speaking of brother
[1:32:52] branham's Ministry in these verses
[1:32:55] remember I've just told you that the uh
[1:32:58] Paul said we turn to the Gentiles you
[1:33:00] know who the first messenger was to the
[1:33:01] Gentiles
[1:33:03] Paul
[1:33:04] there were seven Messengers Jesus had
[1:33:06] him in his hand in the Book of
[1:33:08] Revelation say they had seven stars in
[1:33:09] his hand Jesus had all these messages in
[1:33:11] his hand he gave them specific
[1:33:13] Ministries in order to get to keep the
[1:33:15] people in line with the word the first
[1:33:17] one was Paul the last one
[1:33:19] William Marion Branham
[1:33:22] spoken up here in Revelation 10 spoken
[1:33:26] of in Revelation 3. let's also look at
[1:33:28] revelation 22.
[1:33:31] verse 16 and 17. I'm I'm just using five
[1:33:34] but there's so many more of them it's a
[1:33:36] lot more than this revelation 22 16-17
[1:33:38] look at this I jesus who did this
[1:33:44] I Jesus have set my angel to testify
[1:33:48] unto you these things in the churches I
[1:33:50] am the root and offspring of David and
[1:33:52] the bride and Morningstar you say you're
[1:33:54] preaching Jesus you preaching Jesus
[1:33:56] which Jesus you preaching
[1:34:01] which Jesus you preaching
[1:34:06] Hallelujah and the spirit
[1:34:08] and the bride say come and let him that
[1:34:11] here say come and let him that is The
[1:34:13] Thirst come and whosoever will let him
[1:34:15] take the Water of Life
[1:34:17] freely
[1:34:19] I got one more scripture I want to read
[1:34:21] that speaks of his ministry it speaks of
[1:34:23] brother branham's Ministry amen it's
[1:34:25] spoken of in scripture that's why I
[1:34:27] believe the message I don't believe it
[1:34:29] because my mama told me I don't believe
[1:34:32] it because you know somebody else told
[1:34:34] me I believe because when I read the
[1:34:36] scripture for myself I could see how all
[1:34:39] this was flowing right there in the
[1:34:41] Scripture it was promise now his name
[1:34:43] just like Jesus name was not in the Old
[1:34:46] Testament you won't find William
[1:34:48] brantley's name in the New Testament but
[1:34:50] you'll find his ministry
[1:34:55] Saint Luke 17 26-30
[1:35:01] and as it was in the days of Noah
[1:35:05] so shall it be also in the days of the
[1:35:08] son of man and you know you got to
[1:35:09] understand this you know what what's
[1:35:11] going on in the days of no watch what
[1:35:13] the Bible says they did eat that's just
[1:35:15] excessive eating that's that's uh
[1:35:17] smorgasbords everywhere and and and
[1:35:19] Golden Corrals everywhere
[1:35:22] hello somebody
[1:35:24] a Chinese buffets
[1:35:28] that's what that is they did eat and
[1:35:30] some of y'all enjoy going there pay one
[1:35:32] price and get as much food as you and
[1:35:34] they have to kick you out the restaurant
[1:35:37] you eat too much
[1:35:39] you have to leave but this is this is
[1:35:42] what the problem is Right amen says they
[1:35:44] didn't eat they drink they married wise
[1:35:46] what this is they they get married they
[1:35:47] get divorced they get married they get
[1:35:49] divorced they get married they get
[1:35:49] divorced that's what Mary wives is
[1:35:53] hello and then let's go to the next one
[1:35:55] they were given in marriage you want to
[1:35:58] know what that is that means they live
[1:36:00] together or what we used to call
[1:36:03] second
[1:36:05] they shocking they mean they living
[1:36:07] together and not married but still
[1:36:10] practicing as if they were married
[1:36:13] we got more of that today than we ever
[1:36:15] had
[1:36:16] these are signs of the time let me go a
[1:36:19] little further say they were they were
[1:36:20] giving a marriage until the day that
[1:36:22] Noah entered into the ark and the flood
[1:36:24] came and destroyed them all let's keep
[1:36:25] going
[1:36:26] because here's the problem look at
[1:36:28] likewise
[1:36:29] also as it was in the days of lot they
[1:36:33] did eat they drink they bought they sold
[1:36:36] they planted they built it
[1:36:38] but the same day that lot went out of
[1:36:40] Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from
[1:36:42] heaven and destroyed them all now let's
[1:36:43] go back because in the days of lot it
[1:36:45] was homosexuality that was a problem and
[1:36:47] that's why God destroyed because of the
[1:36:49] homosexual agenda that was in the Earth
[1:36:51] at that time he destroyed a city but
[1:36:53] here's the problem in our day we're
[1:36:55] gonna have marriage and divorce problems
[1:36:57] as well as homosexuality of those issues
[1:37:00] lesbianism all of that at the same time
[1:37:04] fighting Spears everywhere

[1:37:39] you shouldn't even be talking to him
[1:37:43] you know he ain't got no job you
[1:37:45] shouldn't even be talking to him he's
[1:37:47] not ready to be no husband
[1:37:49] but you get your emotions all worked up
[1:37:51] like you're gonna create a husband
[1:37:54] now you can't do that you gotta let God
[1:37:56] send you a husband you young men got to
[1:37:59] be the same way don't be don't be just

[1:38:14] come on
[1:38:16] right I mean look at just some of the
[1:38:17] simple things can they can they take
[1:38:19] care of a house
[1:38:22] is he borrowing money from you to pay
[1:38:25] his bills
[1:38:27] brother
[1:38:30] every week he broke
[1:38:33] how he gonna take care of you
[1:38:37] and see what happened we get into these
[1:38:39] bad relationships
[1:38:42] ain't prayed about nothing we get into
[1:38:44] these bad relations then our hearts get
[1:38:46] broken
[1:38:47] and now as a young lady another young
[1:38:49] lady slipping up to talk to you as your
[1:38:51] friend
[1:38:52] yeah my heart been broken too and yeah
[1:38:54] yeah I know and that's why I do this

[1:39:18] announced from this pulpit
[1:39:31] the same day that lot went out of Sodom
[1:39:33] and Rain fire and brimstone from heaven
[1:39:35] and destroyed them all even thus
[1:39:39] shall it be in the day when the son of
[1:39:41] man is revealed this is a scripture
[1:39:46] that's telling us when these things are
[1:39:49] in the Earth
[1:39:50] God's going to have a prophet in the
[1:39:52] land
[1:39:53] to deal with some of these things that
[1:39:54] are in the earth now here God's already
[1:39:57] sent his Prophet now uh uh uh

[1:40:09] you young people may not may not realize
[1:40:12] this but it's only recent very recent
[1:40:16] that we were given June as gay pride
[1:40:20] month when I was a little boy that was
[1:40:22] not
[1:40:23] we didn't have no gay pride month
[1:40:26] but now they gave a whole month to it
[1:40:28] and trying to trying to equate it to
[1:40:31] Black History Month
[1:40:34] no it's not connected in any way shape
[1:40:37] form or fashion
[1:40:39] right but but here they they they they
[1:40:42] they in every business you go to got the
[1:40:45] rainbow flag uh all over the place and
[1:40:48] look let me tell you understand
[1:40:49] something the rainbow does not belong

[1:41:07] to God and where he promised in the Book
[1:41:10] of Genesis that he would not destroy the
[1:41:14] Earth with water
[1:41:17] that that that's that's a believer's
[1:41:19] sign
[1:41:20] let's believe a sign but I can tell you
[1:41:22] right now this destruction will come
[1:41:25] just like it came to Sodom Gomorrah
[1:41:28] destruction will come all liars

[1:41:35] Lake of Fire that's what the Bible

[1:41:41] but you know there was another sign that
[1:41:43] happened in the days of Abraham and lot
[1:41:47] and the other sign
[1:41:49] which was the sign of the Messiah
[1:41:54] the sign of Messiah is being able to
[1:41:56] reveal the secrets of the heart
[1:42:00] when Jesus met the woman at the well she
[1:42:03] said we knew we know when Messiah comes

[1:43:27] call Abraham her Lord can me and my Lord
[1:43:30] have pledge again and I have a son she
[1:43:33] laughed within herself
[1:43:37] God
[1:43:39] with his back to the tent
[1:43:44] why is Sarah laughing
[1:43:47] hello
[1:43:49] why is Sarah laughing
[1:43:51] [Music]
[1:43:55] yes you were laughing you you not only
[1:43:59] were you laughing but you said this
[1:44:02] who heard it
[1:44:03] Abraham didn't even hear it
[1:44:08] Abraham didn't even hear and Abraham
[1:44:10] probably sitting there with his mouth
[1:44:11] I'm like oh who is this and I'm that
[1:44:13] that I'm entertaining
[1:44:15] this is God In the Flesh God knew her
[1:44:18] thoughts God knew everything about her
[1:44:24] now in the scripture says it was in the
[1:44:27] days of lots so shall it be
[1:44:29] in the coming of the son of man so
[1:44:31] therefore if that happened in the days
[1:44:33] of lot where God could reveal to Abraham
[1:44:35] the secrets the sign of Messiah then
[1:44:38] that same thing would have to be
[1:44:39] manifested
[1:44:41] in this day
[1:44:46] can we read
[1:44:48] bombing Gilead
[1:44:57] you know as I I think about the service
[1:45:00] you know some of this is just refreshing
[1:45:02] for many of us
[1:45:04] but you know what there's so much ain't
[1:45:06] never
[1:45:08] ever heard this in our life
[1:45:11] and it'll be the thing that settles them
[1:45:13] our young people that that ain't that I
[1:45:16] mean they just kind of coming up we just
[1:45:17] assume
[1:45:19] you know our young people need to be
[1:45:20] grounded and established in the word
[1:45:22] because people gotta attack them why you
[1:45:24] believe what you believe
[1:45:25] because my mama said it no you guys know
[1:45:28] I saw it in the Bible I read it my
[1:45:30] pastor read it I saw it in the Bible
[1:45:31] where God promised to send brother
[1:45:34] Branham and I believe what the Bible say
[1:45:37] let's pick this up out of Barnum and
[1:45:39] Gilead
[1:45:41] all right
[1:45:43] over on this side there's a a colored
[1:45:46] woman with a hand up now don't get
[1:45:48] offended by that language
[1:45:50] don't get offended that's the the terms
[1:45:52] that they use back in those days and it
[1:45:54] was very acceptable nowadays people just
[1:45:56] get mad
[1:45:58] don't allow the devil to get you off
[1:46:00] into that this is not uh this is this
[1:46:02] ain't about a a white prophet and black
[1:46:04] people this ain't about nothing like
[1:46:06] that
[1:46:06] it's about God and a man
[1:46:10] I see God in a man
[1:46:14] and I'm not worshiping that man I'm
[1:46:16] worshiping God
[1:46:18] because even the man
[1:46:20] told John there's another scripture
[1:46:22] there's another scripture right there
[1:46:23] the man told John in in Revelation
[1:46:27] worship God
[1:46:29] you know that angel that John was
[1:46:31] talking to
[1:46:32] you want to know who the angel was that
[1:46:34] John was talking to because the angel
[1:46:35] said I am of the fellow servants the
[1:46:38] prophets
[1:46:41] you want to know who that angel was he
[1:46:42] was an angel he was a prophet from the
[1:46:45] future
[1:46:46] see we can see God in the past but a
[1:46:48] prophet from the future when John saw
[1:46:51] him on the Isle of practice he was
[1:46:52] talking to a prophet from the future
[1:46:58] and the prophet had a name the prophet
[1:47:00] from the future had a name his name was
[1:47:03] William Marion Branham found right there
[1:47:06] in the scripture
[1:47:07] talking to John revealing the Book of
[1:47:10] Revelation
[1:47:11] [Music]
[1:47:13] okay all right
[1:47:15] yeah
[1:47:17] I teach on it every Wednesday
[1:47:19] I know it's a prophet that revealed it
[1:47:21] who revealed the seals
[1:47:24] who revealed the Thunders
[1:47:27] it was brother Brandon his ministry that
[1:47:29] did it and not only just did it God used
[1:47:31] a supernatural Cloud to vindicate that
[1:47:33] he was with this

[1:49:55] why would we disbelieve that
[1:49:57] look let me go a little further
[1:50:00] now
[1:50:02] I turn my back
[1:50:04] the prophet
[1:50:06] is is is there before these people in
[1:50:09] Long Beach California and as he's
[1:50:12] praying in the prayer line say now I've
[1:50:13] turned my back now most people might
[1:50:15] think this is for show but it's not for

[1:50:21] manifest himself the same way he did in
[1:50:24] Abraham's day Abraham and lots day
[1:50:27] it was the same God and it was a Simon
[1:50:30] Messiah then it's a sign of Messiah and
[1:50:33] Jesus day when he met the woman at the
[1:50:34] well it was the sign of messiah in 1961.
[1:50:40] now I turn my back
[1:50:44] you pray

[1:50:59] she's sitting in this direction
[1:51:02] She's suffering with bursitis
[1:51:05] stand up

[1:51:48] The Same Spirit would be here how many
[1:51:50] knows that that was the sign of the
[1:51:52] Messiah when Jesus was on the earth
[1:51:54] Harmony knows he promised it to the
[1:51:57] elect Church in the last day well here
[1:51:59] it is now you see new converts after
[1:52:02] 2000 years it's never happened in 2000
[1:52:05] years because the evening lights are
[1:52:06] shining the Bible said there would come
[1:52:09] a day that wouldn't wouldn't be neither
[1:52:11] day nor night but in the evening uh time
[1:52:13] it would be light there he is now what
[1:52:16] kind of light would it be the same Sun
[1:52:18] that Rose in the East sets in the west
[1:52:20] is that right the same I mean the
[1:52:21] evening lights has come you believe that
[1:52:23] so when brother Branham is standing
[1:52:25] there before these people look this one
[1:52:27] just no one meeting that this happened I
[1:52:29] only just brought you one quote if you
[1:52:31] search the message you'll find brother
[1:52:32] Branham turn this back many times
[1:52:35] many different cities to try to get the
[1:52:37] people to see
[1:52:40] that the same God that was speaking to
[1:52:43] Abraham and reveal the secrets in
[1:52:44] Abraham's day was the same God that was
[1:52:46] in Jesus and revealed the secrets of the
[1:52:48] woman at the well was the same God that
[1:52:50] was in this ministry
[1:52:53] if you don't if you don't believe me
[1:52:55] believe me for the works
[1:53:00] I'm uh I'm coming home
[1:53:04] I'm coming home I I just I just love the
[1:53:06] word of God
[1:53:11] um
[1:53:12] I want to say that the same pillar fire
[1:53:14] that led the children out Israel through
[1:53:15] the Wilderness is the same pillar fire
[1:53:17] that spoke that Paul spoke to the road
[1:53:19] to Damascus
[1:53:20] it's also the same pillow fight that was
[1:53:22] captured on the picture and hang in the
[1:53:24] Library of Congress
[1:53:26] uh when brother Branham standing there
[1:53:27] defending the gospel in uh in Texas and
[1:53:30] they took a picture in Houston Texas
[1:53:32] they took a picture in that pill of fire
[1:53:34] uh showed up on the picture only
[1:53:36] supernatural being ever recorded
[1:53:39] own picture
[1:53:41] and and and and and
[1:53:43] I don't know if I got the quote here but
[1:53:45] brother Brandon will make a statement
[1:53:47] like this
[1:53:49] when that pillar fire was taken above
[1:53:51] his uh I believe it was over his
[1:53:53] shoulder over his one was over the
[1:53:55] shoulder one was over his head
[1:53:56] right and when that pillar fire was
[1:53:58] taken over his head he'd say it wasn't
[1:54:00] me
[1:54:01] I was just standing there
[1:54:06] and I want you to notice something the
[1:54:08] pillifier the position of it I don't
[1:54:10] know oh that's the cloud that the pillar
[1:54:13] fire is uh over his head which shows
[1:54:17] that brother Brandon is under the
[1:54:19] headship
[1:54:21] of Christ
[1:54:30] I got a quote here out of the maniac of
[1:54:32] guedera let me let me read this
[1:54:40] says here some time ago you all noticed
[1:54:42] that they had the picture set was taken
[1:54:45] by someone of Jesus holding his arms out
[1:54:47] and two planes coming over you seeing
[1:54:49] that in the paper but the man admitted
[1:54:52] it he painted the picture
[1:54:56] he painted the picture it wasn't so you
[1:54:58] see and he admitted it and it was in the
[1:55:01] Reader's Digest that it wasn't so but
[1:55:04] this picture here
[1:55:06] not because dear Christian uh
[1:55:09] uh it's it's not me I just happen to be
[1:55:13] standing there that was all but that is
[1:55:16] the picture of a supernatural being and
[1:55:19] to my opinion if you notice it's the
[1:55:21] pillar fire go back in my books for even
[1:55:23] years before this was testified look
[1:55:27] back there at the time after after time
[1:55:29] after time it appeared looking a little
[1:55:31] bit little book the first one I've
[1:55:33] written called Jesus Christ the same
[1:55:35] yesterday today and forever how the big
[1:55:37] newspapers of Louisville Kentucky and
[1:55:39] and also a Mystic like a p a Mystic like
[1:55:42] appears over a local Baptist Minister
[1:55:44] while baptizing when he stood down there
[1:55:48] and told me right before at least 10 000
[1:55:50] people that this thing was coming to
[1:55:52] pass that your ministry
[1:55:56] will be as John the Baptist was sent
[1:55:59] forth as a forerunner of the first
[1:56:01] coming of Christ your ministry will
[1:56:04] bring forth will be will it be the
[1:56:06] bringing forth of the second coming
[1:56:09] of Christ
[1:56:11] brother brannon's Ministry was uh was
[1:56:13] identified by almighty God with a
[1:56:15] supernatural being telling him while he
[1:56:17] was baptizing people in the name of the
[1:56:19] Lord Jesus Christ baptized in the 17th
[1:56:21] people the 17th person came in to be
[1:56:23] baptized and here comes the the angel
[1:56:25] Lord come now say as John the Baptist
[1:56:27] foreign the first coming
[1:56:29] of Jesus your ministry and he also said
[1:56:33] you your ministry will forerun the
[1:56:36] second coming of the Lord Jesus I know
[1:56:38] we right where we need to be
[1:56:42] if we want to be ready for the second
[1:56:43] coming Lord we better be listening
[1:56:46] to what's in this message
[1:56:49] I'm going a little further I'm almost
[1:56:51] there
[1:56:56] yeah I think I can read these
[1:56:59] and um and we'll be we'll be done let me
[1:57:02] go to uh Revelation chapter four
[1:57:05] Oh Glory to God
[1:57:08] God is in his man
[1:57:11] God is in his man
[1:57:14] amen amen amen and and I just you know
[1:57:17] I've always asked people if you're going
[1:57:19] to tell me that brother Brandon was not
[1:57:21] the Fulfillment of Malachi 4. now you
[1:57:23] you saw it you read it God's gonna send
[1:57:25] Elijah y'all going to send me Elijah the
[1:57:27] prophet you read it
[1:57:29] and if brother Branham is not the
[1:57:30] Fulfillment of that Elijah that was sent
[1:57:32] just tell me who is
[1:57:35] that way I can stop wasting my time and
[1:57:38] I can get behind that 110 percent who is
[1:57:41] this Elijah that God promised and
[1:57:45] actually according to the scripture God
[1:57:46] promised to use the spirit of Elijah
[1:57:48] five times he used it in Elijah they use
[1:57:52] it in Elisha because he got a double
[1:57:53] portion of Elijah's spirit and then he
[1:57:56] used it and John the Baptist ministry
[1:57:59] and then he also plan to use it one more
[1:58:01] time before the Dreadful day of the Lord
[1:58:03] and that was in brother branham's
[1:58:04] Ministry and the last time God used it
[1:58:07] he is a he is one of the two witnesses
[1:58:09] of Revelation 11 that preaches to the
[1:58:11] Jews
[1:58:12] I'm telling Elijah is actually on his
[1:58:14] way back
[1:58:16] he coming to priesthood a Jews
[1:58:19] you know brother Branham tried to go to
[1:58:21] Israel
[1:58:23] he tried he had a ticket to go to Israel
[1:58:26] and he was on his way he said he said
[1:58:28] the Jews are looking for the sign of the
[1:58:30] Messiah they're looking for brother
[1:58:32] Brandon we know if you go that they'll
[1:58:33] stop believing in Christ he said he said
[1:58:35] he saved you if you go they'll believe
[1:58:37] and brother Brandon had a six and he
[1:58:39] said what a setup he said I got to go
[1:58:41] got his ticket he on his way and with a
[1:58:44] plane getting ready to to I mean on the
[1:58:46] tarmac there get ready to take off God
[1:58:48] said come here let me talk to you I
[1:58:51] don't want you to go to Israel
[1:58:53] can you imagine that
[1:58:56] there are certain places the prophet
[1:58:57] couldn't go Israel was one of them don't
[1:59:00] let don't touch your feet in Israel
[1:59:04] now there's a reason there's many
[1:59:06] reasons for that do you know if brother
[1:59:08] Branham had gone to Israel
[1:59:11] there's a couple things that we can look
[1:59:12] at here had it gone God would have
[1:59:14] manifest himself through that prophet
[1:59:17] just like God manifests himself through
[1:59:19] Moses when he struck The Rock
[1:59:23] but it would have broke all the
[1:59:24] scriptures and see sometimes the
[1:59:27] scripture binds you
[1:59:30] you can't do nothing outside of this
[1:59:32] word
[1:59:34] the brother random say God I said no no
[1:59:35] I don't want you to
[1:59:40] give us but not even born at that time
[1:59:43] we would have never had a chance
[1:59:46] so can I tell you like this God
[1:59:48] restrained the prophet from going to
[1:59:51] Israel because he loves you
[1:59:59] in the scripture that would have been
[2:00:00] broken because it was not his ministry
[2:00:02] to go to Israel it's Elijah himself
[2:00:06] Elijah has been preserved
[2:00:09] to go to Israel God preserved Moses and
[2:00:12] God preserved Elijah
[2:00:14] Elijah was caught up in a whirlwind
[2:00:17] a tears of fire came and took him out of
[2:00:20] here he's been preserved and he's coming
[2:00:22] back but his spirits
[2:00:24] was going from man to man to man because
[2:00:27] God loved it that much he enjoyed that
[2:00:29] Spirits he used it five times
[2:00:36] whoa in my Baptist Church
[2:00:39] they never told me
[2:00:42] that the spirit Elijah came five times
[2:00:46] never I didn't know that till I come to
[2:00:48] this message
[2:00:50] and I can see it right there in the
[2:00:51] scripture let me let me keep reading
[2:00:57] watch are you ready
[2:00:59] he says listen keep this keep this now
[2:01:01] just remember to let you know and in
[2:01:03] other words that he give him some advice
[2:01:05] Gene you can hold his tape and just tell
[2:01:07] him don't don't let this tape get out
[2:01:09] I'm glad the tape got out
[2:01:13] listen now I don't have to hold it here
[2:01:15] that's all right I mean just keep the
[2:01:17] tape permit this permit this to the
[2:01:20] church and we part of the church the
[2:01:23] church is the called out
[2:01:25] right notice this now that you might
[2:01:28] know that the color of the light that's
[2:01:30] what that's with the with the Lord the
[2:01:32] that and the Lord's light that follows
[2:01:34] the Lord and is of the Lord is Amber
[2:01:37] yellowish green
[2:01:38] that's the same color of the light
[2:01:40] that's with us today as the scientist
[2:01:42] has took its picture yellowish green
[2:01:46] Amber when a little boy and I seen it
[2:01:48] for my first time you remember uh the
[2:01:51] old timers uh here I always told you
[2:01:53] before the actual picture was taken it
[2:01:55] was yellowish green which is Amber now
[2:01:57] to let you know that the spirit of the
[2:02:00] Lord he said when he seen it from the
[2:02:02] Lords of the living creature that stood

[2:02:45] church in this last days look at this
[2:02:46] there you are
[2:02:48] not me
[2:02:50] I was just standing there but it was a
[2:02:53] picture that was taken
[2:02:57] I want you to look at that and see
[2:02:58] brother random is saying when I'm gonna
[2:03:00] come back when he was standing there
[2:03:01] defending the gospel actually it was uh
[2:03:04] uh Dr Bess that wanted to have a debate
[2:03:08] you know over the scripture and and
[2:03:10] brother Bosworth 80 something years ago
[2:03:13] say can I take him up on the debate
[2:03:15] brother Brandon said just whatever you
[2:03:16] do just don't argue with them don't fuss
[2:03:18] with him don't argue with him he said
[2:03:20] brother Brandon I promise you I won't
[2:03:21] argue with him say but I just got to
[2:03:23] take this man up on this debate okay I
[2:03:26] give you permission brother Brandon went
[2:03:28] and set in the in the balcony of the
[2:03:31] church brother Bosworth went to the
[2:03:33] pulpit with his Bible
[2:03:35] and the doctor the best was just going
[2:03:37] on and you know uh this is wrong and
[2:03:40] that's wrong and that's wrong and that's
[2:03:41] wrong and uh and and and and and uh Dr I
[2:03:44] mean brother Boswell said I just got one
[2:03:46] question Dr best just just one question
[2:03:48] if you just answer this one question
[2:03:49] that's all so you ain't got to have a
[2:03:51] lot of questions just one just one just
[2:03:54] one and uh and and when he says uh
[2:03:58] um
[2:03:59] the seven compound names of Jehovah
[2:04:03] Jehovah Jireh Jehovah Rapha Jehovah
[2:04:06] tiskanu Jehovah shalom Jehovah Nissi you
[2:04:11] know these seven Jehovah right uh these
[2:04:15] seven compound names does that apply to
[2:04:18] Jesus
[2:04:20] remember his name not found in the Old
[2:04:22] Testament
[2:04:24] but his characteristics are so found
[2:04:26] there
[2:04:28] does that
[2:04:30] app say I ain't got time to answer
[2:04:32] questions like this so the debate is
[2:04:34] over
[2:04:35] because had he said of the plot of Jesus
[2:04:37] did he he would have to know that Jesus
[2:04:38] Christ was the same yesterday today damn
[2:04:40] family
[2:04:41] and he was standing there taking
[2:04:42] pictures say I got my fist underneath
[2:04:44] this PR this preacher's nose take the
[2:04:46] picture he hired the man to take
[2:04:48] pictures
[2:04:50] say Well since we're done
[2:04:53] if brother Brandon want to come and
[2:04:55] close out the audience he's certainly
[2:04:56] welcome to do that but this debate is
[2:04:57] over with
[2:04:59] brother random comes down
[2:05:01] out of the the balcony and he walks down
[2:05:05] and now brother Brandon's description is
[2:05:07] that there were thousands of angels
[2:05:10] that's his description
[2:05:12] and and most people brother brother I
[2:05:14] remember George brother George Smith his
[2:05:16] son-in-law telling us to say it really
[2:05:18] won thousands of people that was there
[2:05:19] so how could it be thousands of angels
[2:05:20] He said well see he's looking in a
[2:05:22] different dimension
[2:05:25] thousands of angels walking with him as
[2:05:27] he's going down there
[2:05:29] and As you stood up down and say well
[2:05:30] you know this brother is just like me he
[2:05:33] got a father and a mother just like me
[2:05:35] so y'all you know just bear with him
[2:05:36] he's just standing on what he believed
[2:05:39] why why are they taking pictures the the
[2:05:41] guy the best intelligent take pictures
[2:05:43] that Dr Benson but the man just stand up
[2:05:45] taking pictures of brother Branham
[2:05:48] took all the pictures went back to his
[2:05:50] room after the night was over and tried
[2:05:52] to process all the pictures
[2:05:55] every picture
[2:05:58] blank professional photographer not an
[2:06:02] amateur like me but a professor for time
[2:06:04] every one of them was blank only one
[2:06:07] picture
[2:06:09] was developed
[2:06:11] and this was a picture with the pillow
[2:06:13] fire over the top of the prophet's head
[2:06:17] God
[2:06:19] was in his man vindicating his prophet
[2:06:24] now I don't know the story of Dr best
[2:06:27] after all of that but if he didn't
[2:06:29] believe after all that then he fit the
[2:06:31] same scripture as these Pharisees and
[2:06:33] Sadducees
[2:06:35] no matter what work was done
[2:06:37] they still wouldn't believe
[2:06:39] but for me I'm like the woman at the
[2:06:41] well
[2:06:42] this got to be the silent Messiah
[2:06:46] let me finish reading
[2:06:50] not me
[2:06:52] I was just standing there but it was a
[2:06:54] it was a picture that was taken I want
[2:06:57] you to look at that just exactly what
[2:06:59] Ezekiel Saw same colors the same way and
[2:07:02] acted the same way and fleshed the same
[2:07:04] way of the living creatures what is it
[2:07:06] the living creatures represented
[2:07:08] represent the Living Church uh the
[2:07:10] church that's a living by the power and
[2:07:12] the resurrection of Christ them same
[2:07:14] Amber colors has coveted it with a
[2:07:16] covenant from the law and upward from
[2:07:18] the uh from the lowest downward there's
[2:07:20] no more guessing
[2:07:22] science has took the picture look at the
[2:07:25] colors just look at the colors of of
[2:07:28] fire in there see the rainbow look at
[2:07:30] the yellowish Emerald color now on this
[2:07:33] camera it was just a straight photograph
[2:07:35] photo a photographer's camera on this
[2:07:38] camera was colored pictures uh Kodak
[2:07:41] chrome color look at the amber color in
[2:07:43] there if I could get it get it over a
[2:07:46] light somewhere where you could see in
[2:07:48] the back can you see like unto a rainbow
[2:07:50] look at the streets coming back and
[2:07:52] forth like a rainbow everyone a
[2:07:54] different color we're going to get into
[2:07:56] that in a few minutes what are these
[2:07:58] what are these what are those colors and
[2:07:59] what do they reflect oh that just makes
[2:08:02] my poor heart jump for joy and to know
[2:08:04] that in this day that we're living in
[2:08:07] that Christ when all other ground is
[2:08:09] sinking Sands all other ground I think
[2:08:11] why can't I tell that why can I make
[2:08:14] that world make the world see it the
[2:08:17] world wasn't meant to see it the world
[2:08:20] won't see it they never will see it but
[2:08:24] the church
[2:08:25] is receiving the mightiest shaking it
[2:08:31] ever had
[2:08:33] how we thank God for this I got one more
[2:08:36] quote that I want to finish here with
[2:08:37] you all I see are y'all trying to get
[2:08:40] that picture for everybody
[2:08:41] um if you get it fine if not just a
[2:08:44] quick Google search or find it
[2:08:46] um pillow fire over brother branham's
[2:08:48] head just look for that
[2:08:50] um
[2:08:51] this last quote that out that I read for
[2:08:53] you and they'll show you the the um
[2:08:56] uh it's God vindicating this Prophet
[2:08:59] y'all God did it with the cloud God did
[2:09:01] it with the pillow fight of his head it
[2:09:03] was God in the man it wasn't the man
[2:09:05] himself it was God and the man God
[2:09:07] Vindicated it and look I don't think God
[2:09:10] would be wasting his time
[2:09:12] vindicating a man like that if he was
[2:09:15] going to give him wrong Doctrine
[2:09:18] why would God vindicate it if the
[2:09:21] doctrine is wrong
[2:09:22] why would God do that I mean you need to
[2:09:25] explain that to me why would God put his
[2:09:27] stamp of approval on somebody's got
[2:09:29] wrong Doctrine
[2:09:32] God don't do confusing things like that
[2:09:35] now the only person confused is you
[2:09:38] but God ain't come God God knew exactly
[2:09:40] what he's doing when he been the case of
[2:09:42] man's Ministry it's God in the man
[2:09:45] here's my last quote the anointed ones
[2:09:49] at the end time
[2:09:51] the anointed ones at the end time here
[2:09:54] it is
[2:09:55] I want you to know this is sure
[2:10:00] and you that listen to this tape you
[2:10:03] might have thought today that I was
[2:10:05] trying to say that about myself
[2:10:09] being that I was packing this message
[2:10:12] I have no more to do with it than
[2:10:16] nothing
[2:10:18] look at what the prophet saying anointed
[2:10:19] ones at the end time he says no more
[2:10:21] than just a voice
[2:10:24] and my voice even against my better
[2:10:27] judgment
[2:10:29] I wanted to be a Trapper
[2:10:32] it says but but but it's the will of my
[2:10:34] father that I declare to do and am
[2:10:37] determined to do I wasn't the one that
[2:10:40] appeared down on the river
[2:10:43] I was only standing there when he
[2:10:47] appeared
[2:10:48] I'm not the one that performs these
[2:10:52] things and foretells these things that
[2:10:55] happens as perfect as they are it's not
[2:10:57] brother Branham doing that it's God in
[2:10:59] the man
[2:11:00] I'm only I'm only one that's near when
[2:11:05] he does it
[2:11:07] I was only a voice that he used to say
[2:11:10] it it wasn't what I knew it's what I
[2:11:14] just surrendered myself to that he spoke
[2:11:17] through it isn't me it wasn't the
[2:11:21] seventh angel oh no it was a
[2:11:25] manifestation of the son of man
[2:11:29] it wasn't the angel his message it was
[2:11:32] the it was the mystery that God unfolded
[2:11:34] it's not a man it's God
[2:11:38] the angel was not
[2:11:40] the son of man
[2:11:42] he was a messenger
[2:11:44] from
[2:11:46] the son of man
[2:11:49] the son of man is
[2:11:52] Christ
[2:11:54] he's the one
[2:11:56] that your feet know
[2:11:58] when I'm so don't I know people
[2:12:00] misunderstand I'm I'm quoting why are
[2:12:03] you always quoting brother Branham
[2:12:05] you misunderstand why I'm doing that I'm
[2:12:07] doing that because I'm trying to keep us
[2:12:09] in line with the word you go to other
[2:12:11] churches they're just coming up with all
[2:12:13] kind of thoughts and ideas let's go back
[2:12:15] to what a prophet said
[2:12:17] amen do you realize when I quote Paul
[2:12:21] I'm quoting
[2:12:22] what a prophet said do you also
[2:12:25] understand when I quote Moses
[2:12:27] I'm quoting
[2:12:29] what a prophet said when Jesus quoted
[2:12:32] Isaiah
[2:12:35] and they got mad in church
[2:12:38] he was quoting
[2:12:40] what a prophet said
[2:12:42] I'm doing the exact same thing I'm
[2:12:45] quoting what a prophet said I'm not
[2:12:47] exalting the prophet don't get mad at me
[2:12:50] don't misunderstand what I'm trying to
[2:12:52] do
[2:12:56] I need you to understand something when
[2:12:58] I'm when I'm when I'm reading you these
[2:13:00] quotes
[2:13:01] you're not feeding
[2:13:04] on a man
[2:13:14] you're feeding
[2:13:21] you're not feeding on a man a man's
[2:13:24] words will fail
[2:13:26] but you're feeding
[2:13:28] on the unfailing
[2:13:31] body word
[2:13:35] of the son of man and who is the son of
[2:13:37] man the son of man when you use the term
[2:13:40] the son of man you're talking about
[2:13:43] Jesus Christ what brother Brandon was is
[2:13:46] hey son of man revealing
[2:13:54] revealing the son of man
[2:13:58] if you haven't fed fully on every word
[2:14:01] to give yourself strength
[2:14:03] to Fly Above All these denominations
[2:14:06] because that's the only way you're going
[2:14:07] to get above us by having a revelation
[2:14:09] to Fly Above All these denominations and
[2:14:11] things of the world
[2:14:13] will you at this time do it
[2:14:16] while we pray
[2:14:20] God
[2:14:22] was in
[2:14:25] his man
[2:14:27] I believe that church
[2:14:30] and I receive what his man had to say
[2:14:35] let's pray
[2:14:40] thank you Jesus
[2:14:45] we see it
[2:14:49] when we say we see it it means we
[2:14:51] understand it
[2:14:53] it's revealed to us
[2:14:56] as I heard a minister say
[2:14:58] recently
[2:15:01] father no matter how much we preach
[2:15:05] no matter how much we teach
[2:15:08] no how no matter how many scriptures we
[2:15:10] read and how many quotes we read
[2:15:14] you alone reserve the right
[2:15:18] to bring revelation
[2:15:21] you told Peter that Flesh and Blood have
[2:15:24] not revealed these things to you but my
[2:15:26] Father in Heaven has revealed it
[2:15:31] father my prayer is that
[2:15:34] Lord as a group of Believers and we
[2:15:37] would understand
[2:15:39] and even an understanding that it would
[2:15:41] raise an excitement
[2:15:43] it will raise a level of joy
[2:15:47] to be able to hear the word presented in
[2:15:49] this manner
[2:15:51] Lord that it will become clear to us
[2:15:53] what you have called us to it as as you
[2:15:56] just even showed me it was your grace
[2:15:58] that allowed the prophet not to go to
[2:16:01] Israel
[2:16:02] you were thinking about us you knew that
[2:16:05] we would be gathered here today and had
[2:16:07] he gone to Israel had they believed it
[2:16:09] would have been all over for the
[2:16:10] Gentiles
[2:16:12] but you stopped him
[2:16:14] because you loved us so much
[2:16:16] help us now to fall in love with you and
[2:16:18] to fall in love with your word
[2:16:20] to become with this one with this word
[2:16:23] to receive it
[2:16:25] with all of our hearts
[2:16:27] may we not be deceived
[2:16:29] but with the enemies trying to do in
[2:16:31] this hour and Lord if there's one
[2:16:33] that maybe have walked away from this
[2:16:36] truth and they hear this word
[2:16:39] may they be like The Prodigal Son
[2:16:43] God made it come back from uh eating
[2:16:46] that uh denomination of meals and eating
[2:16:49] in pig pens and Lord whatever it is that
[2:16:52] they're out there they know they're in
[2:16:53] their father's house it's it's much
[2:16:55] better food than that
[2:16:57] so may they come Lord forth and father
[2:16:59] may we be like the the father of the
[2:17:02] prodigal son ready to receive them with
[2:17:04] open arms and not be like the brother
[2:17:07] who refused to go into the celebration
[2:17:10] because of what his brother had done
[2:17:12] it's the spirit in the land it's the
[2:17:15] devil in the land that's trying to
[2:17:16] confuse the people so we bind that
[2:17:18] Spirit right now in the name of Jesus
[2:17:21] and Lord May Revelation flow fresh from
[2:17:25] the Throne of God to our hearts of the
[2:17:27] people that they will recognize you by
[2:17:29] scripture

[2:22:55] realize how blessed we are
[2:22:58] Pastor just gave us five scriptures
[2:23:01] about our prophet
[2:23:03] but you know there's a book
[2:23:06] the bride's book The Book of Revelation
[2:23:09] when you read Revelation chapter one the
[2:23:12] first message brother Brown remember
[2:23:13] preached was a deity of Jesus Christ
[2:23:18] chapter two and three who do you know
[2:23:21] that priesthood Church ages
[2:23:24] preach telling you about the book of
[2:23:26] redemption who preached the seals
[2:23:29] the Feast of the trumpets who told you
[2:23:31] who mystery Babylon was who told you
