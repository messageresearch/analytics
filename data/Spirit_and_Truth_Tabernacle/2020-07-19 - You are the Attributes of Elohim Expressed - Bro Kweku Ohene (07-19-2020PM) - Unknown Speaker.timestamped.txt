[38:13] seated
[38:17] to our amen thank you thank you my
[38:19] pleasure sisters for what you do for us
[38:21] amen that is the ministry of angelic
[38:25] i think we've got three basic types of
[38:26] angels we've got the archangels who are
[38:29] the warriors who fight our battles for
[38:30] us
[38:31] we've got the seraphims who bring their
[38:33] presence of the lord their sweetness and
[38:35] their son's inspiration
[38:36] and we've got their caribbeans who bring
[38:38] their word onto us
[38:40] so the lord we thank the lord for
[38:41] anointing our sisters and our brothers
[38:43] who can play instrument strung the
[38:45] guitar play all distance you know
[38:48] and create the atmosphere and in the
[38:50] heal in even the songs there's healing
[38:52] amen
[38:53] and we know in the time of david and
[38:54] saul when saul was
[38:56] afflicted with demons david would go and
[38:58] strong and
[38:59] i mean play the guitar whatever and then
[39:02] the holy ghost
[39:03] through the anointing of the songs will
[39:05] go into the body of a
[39:06] soul and hit his sickness and ailment so
[39:09] the lord used the ministry they are part
[39:11] of the ministry
[39:12] and we than the lord for our brothers
[39:13] and sisters who have sacrificed
[39:15] themselves and the talent for the glory
[39:17] of god god bless you for the songs
[39:19] because i cannot do this i don't have a
[39:22] clue how to do this
[39:24] it's not my calling so the lord the body
[39:27] of christ is mainly one body
[39:28] but many members you know to fulfill
[39:30] every need in the body of christ
[39:32] and the lord bless our brothers and
[39:33] sisters those who sing those who play
[39:35] guitar those who list songs and
[39:37] everything that they do
[39:38] their lord bless them the lord bless our
[39:39] brothers and sisters on the internet
[39:41] world the lord be with them and
[39:43] the lord give you your portion as we
[39:45] minister the word of the lord amen
[39:46] amen glory be to the lord we want to
[39:49] continue uh
[39:51] further on what we preached last week
[39:54] since some of us were not
[39:55] here present we know because of covet
[39:58] our services are divided into two
[39:59] morning
[40:00] and afternoon right but the lord is good
[40:02] sometimes he makes a way for us to we
[40:04] thank the lord for the internet we get
[40:05] everything
[40:06] but sometimes it's not like being here
[40:07] in in in distance so we want to just
[40:09] caption that
[40:10] today's title is going to be uh the
[40:13] eterna
[40:14] you are the attribute of elohim express
[40:18] or you are the expression of elohim's
[40:20] eternal attribute
[40:22] amen we want to lift god from history to
[40:24] the present tense
[40:26] we can talk about what the lord did for
[40:28] abraham all day long
[40:30] but then if the lord is not doing what i
[40:31] need for me then it's just a history
[40:34] we can talk about what the lord did for
[40:35] hannah some four thousand five thousand
[40:38] whatever years ago
[40:39] but then if you come to that need and
[40:41] the lord doesn't do the same for you
[40:43] then it's god yesterday it's not god of
[40:45] today
[40:46] we can talk about what the lord is going
[40:48] to do in the future their glory is going
[40:50] to
[40:50] open in the on earth and in the sixth
[40:53] dimension
[40:53] but if the lord doesn't do what we need
[40:56] today it doesn't give the food that we
[40:57] need today
[40:58] the healing that we need today
[41:00] deliverance of our loved ones
[41:01] if we cannot he'll covet 19 if we cannot
[41:05] take away cancers and tumors
[41:07] if he cannot do all this as far as then
[41:08] he's just a god of history
[41:10] and maybe he's going to be some god in
[41:12] in the future but it's not a present
[41:13] tense god
[41:15] but no that's not what our lord is amen
[41:17] he's the same hebrews 13
[41:19] 8 jesus christ the same yesterday today
[41:23] and tomorrow and forevermore amen his
[41:26] power doesn't diminish
[41:28] he doesn't run out of power out of
[41:30] healing virtues
[41:32] and our virtues they are in you and i to
[41:34] express them
[41:35] amen glory hallelujah last week we
[41:38] talked about we ministered on as you
[41:41] said the attributes
[41:43] seven attributes of jehovah but then we
[41:45] put it as
[41:46] elohim eternal attributes we talk about
[41:49] geovajira he being the the the provider
[41:53] he provide for every situation doesn't
[41:55] matter how
[41:56] needy and how big the problems are
[41:58] sometimes we made the problems like
[42:00] mountains and like the sky when we let
[42:04] the human mind
[42:04] detect to what you see the human mind
[42:07] can magnify your problems
[42:09] so wide it will rain from here both
[42:12] hills mountains and go way into the sky
[42:16] so you are just a teeny ant behind the
[42:18] problem there's nothing that you can do
[42:20] amen if you do that we're going to be
[42:22] like the 10 spice that's what they did
[42:24] they look at
[42:25] all mine we went to them to the place
[42:26] yes the land was flown without
[42:28] kenani but we were just like
[42:30] grasshoppers before the giants
[42:32] and so they became magnified the problem
[42:34] and that's what the devil don't look at
[42:35] the devil as
[42:36] somebody far away from you the devil
[42:38] will preach on your mind
[42:40] he even operated on the man of jesus
[42:42] christ when he was here in flesh the
[42:44] bible said that
[42:45] satan came to him right do you think he
[42:46] came with some monkey like a tail and
[42:48] came to waxy steel and
[42:49] said hey jesus tried to turn turn the
[42:52] stone into bread no
[42:53] he was working on his mind he was
[42:55] working on his human spirit
[42:57] that you have got the power you fasted
[42:59] 40 days and 49.
[43:00] and look at the way you are walking so
[43:02] about to fall down why don't you turn
[43:03] this
[43:04] stone into bread and that wasn't what it
[43:07] was meant for
[43:08] that wasn't the word for the day yes you
[43:10] had the power but the power is governed
[43:12] by the world
[43:13] so jesus didn't do it amen then he went
[43:15] back it didn't mean he went back
[43:17] he just began to express back again that
[43:19] he you've got all the power in the
[43:21] universe why don't you throw yourself on
[43:22] the ground
[43:23] and the angels will carry you up yeah he
[43:25] didn't oblige to that
[43:27] and he began to tempt him he was working
[43:29] on his mind so sometimes the devil will
[43:31] not use somebody to tempt you
[43:32] but your own mind that your problem is
[43:35] so way big
[43:36] is beyond you is beyond the universe
[43:38] there's nothing that anybody
[43:40] can do for you and you are just a little
[43:42] tiny
[43:43] insect behind a problem and you lose
[43:45] soup and you begin to go down and
[43:47] under and under but then when you begin
[43:49] to see yourself that is not your might
[43:51] it's not your human mind it's not your
[43:53] power it's not your resources
[43:56] it's not your healing virtues but it's
[43:58] jesus christ in you
[44:00] amen it's jesus christ in you
[44:02] manifesting those virtues
[44:04] then you just say hey i'm a human being
[44:06] i'm only five foot eight five foot
[44:07] eleven
[44:08] i'm only four foot six foot i can't be
[44:10] any longer than that
[44:12] but there's somebody who can be longer
[44:14] than that who can be taller than that
[44:15] he's jesus christ let's transfer the
[44:17] battle to that person
[44:19] and the lord jesus christ in your heart
[44:20] in my brother's side in your sister's
[44:22] heart
[44:22] take up the situation and diminish the
[44:24] situation
[44:25] amen let's look at david david was a
[44:29] just a little skinny little boy and he
[44:31] said he was going to fight goliath
[44:33] why do you even think about that david
[44:35] is a hallucination
[44:37] what is wrong with you yeah even saul
[44:39] who is the tallest of other people in
[44:41] israel
[44:41] he couldn't even go before goliath and
[44:43] you a little tiny little skinny boy
[44:45] you want to go and fight goliath yeah
[44:47] but david was looking beyond
[44:49] himself he was looking to the lord of
[44:51] hosts
[44:52] yahweh jehovah so when the battle became
[44:55] the battle they all
[44:56] gave their ways i'm going to do this to
[44:58] you
[44:59] goliath was kissing david in the name of
[45:02] his idols
[45:03] and david also kissed him in the name of
[45:04] his god and so when the battle was set
[45:07] i mean a peace became a real battle
[45:09] david just put himself out of the way
[45:12] and he let the lord take place he
[45:14] transferred he's learned how to transfer
[45:16] the battle to the lord
[45:18] on the desert on his knees in prayer
[45:20] when he saw the
[45:22] bear he didn't kill the bear with his
[45:24] strength but he let jeopard come into
[45:26] the situation
[45:27] that nothing can take my life nothing
[45:30] can take my sheep
[45:32] from from my hands my daddy gave me 100
[45:34] sheep to take them to the field yeah
[45:36] and my daddy's expressed expectant henry
[45:38] shibako
[45:39] he's not a person 99 so you this bird
[45:42] you are not going to take this
[45:43] from me in the name of the lord
[45:45] jesus christ i take a hold of you rape
[45:47] his mind
[45:48] with the strength of the almighty and
[45:50] brought it as a trophy to his father
[45:51] that
[45:52] i killed this bear another time a lion
[45:55] appeared out of the blue
[45:56] and looked looking around and then he
[45:58] said look this doesn't scare me
[46:01] right i've seen this before i've seen a
[46:04] bear
[46:05] you lying is going to be the same thing
[46:06] it's not my strength the lord of hosts
[46:08] the
[46:08] jova jarrah anointed him giovanni the
[46:11] protector
[46:12] anointed man you took the lion and
[46:14] ripped the lion apart
[46:16] the same lord is here and all we need to
[46:18] do is to transfer the battle
[46:20] onto the lord because the battle is not
[46:23] your battle
[46:24] the covet battle is not my battle but
[46:26] the battle is unto the lord amen
[46:28] and when we learn to transfer to that
[46:30] hey the lord has given us sheep
[46:31] the sheep could be our loved ones that's
[46:33] right we you are the one who is covering
[46:35] them with your talking
[46:36] amen we are covering our loved ones who
[46:37] haven't come to maturity
[46:39] spiritually with your token because the
[46:41] lord has anointed you for that ministry
[46:43] that's right and so you
[46:44] take yourself out of the way and say
[46:46] lord even my loved one hasn't been seen
[46:48] the lord yet
[46:49] and it's not the time for him to be
[46:50] taken out of this world i put my token
[46:52] upon him
[46:53] i put my holy ghost upon him holy ghost
[46:55] to me go to go to work
[46:57] take care of my loved ones and you just
[46:59] commit and believe the lord
[47:00] and you see the lord doing the work that
[47:02] you're supposed to do amen
[47:04] glory be to the lord amen the lord is
[47:07] good
[47:07] amen so those attributes we put java
[47:10] jarrah as a provider which is gold
[47:12] we gave a scripture genesis 22 14. now
[47:16] this is an attribute that we're going to
[47:17] dwell upon
[47:18] jova rapha the healer amen if there's a
[47:21] time we need healing
[47:22] of our people of our land the whole
[47:24] planet it is today
[47:26] and that is red because what we are
[47:28] seeing now people dying
[47:30] life being lost the red blood of jesus
[47:33] christ has already taken care of that
[47:35] amen if the people of the world can if
[47:37] the politicians
[47:38] can come together and just humble
[47:41] themselves
[47:42] that we are not here by our own
[47:43] political powers right even those
[47:45] politicians the lord put them in power
[47:47] for a purpose and if they can ascribe to
[47:49] the lord
[47:50] that lord take care of our nations our
[47:53] scientists cannot help anymore
[47:54] our medicines are not helping we don't
[47:56] have a vaccine lord give us ever sin
[47:58] the lord will give it to them amen i
[48:00] will come back today to the rapha
[48:03] there's a lot of scriptures we use
[48:04] exodus 15 26
[48:06] psalm 147 3 he said he he let the broken
[48:10] in heart
[48:11] and bind up their wounds amen if there's
[48:14] anyone whose heart is broken
[48:15] the lord heals you and binds up your
[48:17] wound
[48:22] that is red brown the lord doesn't need
[48:24] to save the skies
[48:25] the lord doesn't need to save the angels
[48:27] he doesn't need to save theophanies
[48:29] the lord needs to save the earth which
[48:31] you and i are part of
[48:32] amen the red is a human being we've got
[48:35] red blood in us the crimson blood
[48:37] that the lord need to save us from the
[48:38] old breath and transition us to the new
[48:41] breath
[48:41] to be whiter than the snow the brown is
[48:44] the earth because this earth is what we
[48:45] are going to dwell upon
[48:47] we are not going nowhere the prophet
[48:48] said that when you go to heaven you're
[48:50] not going to fly away
[48:51] to another planet you're just going to
[48:53] be right here
[48:54] in another dimension faster than that
[48:57] when you leave this
[48:57] blood behind blood system that flesh
[48:59] behind there's another being in you by
[49:01] the holy ghost
[49:02] by the uh decree of the lord by christ
[49:04] the theophany the celestial body
[49:07] that doesn't it's not limited to this
[49:08] war i cannot go
[49:10] beyond this wall but there's another
[49:11] person who can go beyond this wall
[49:14] and see outside what is going outside
[49:16] he's the celestial body
[49:17] amen and when we drop this flesh we
[49:20] still gonna be right here on earth
[49:22] not in this flesh that can be broken
[49:24] down by the true flesh
[49:26] the bones and the flesh that is the few
[49:27] funny body that you wear before the
[49:29] foundation of the world
[49:30] you're going to transfer your experience
[49:32] that you gathered here into that
[49:34] theophany and keep expressing christ all
[49:37] throughout
[49:38] eternity which is beyond there's nothing
[49:40] like ending to eternity
[49:42] amen eternity means a tenor and the
[49:44] prophet used a
[49:45] circle right to describe it you just
[49:48] keep going and going and manifesting
[49:50] when you finish this
[49:51] circle you break into another circle as
[49:53] we are seen on earth
[49:54] the lord is moving in in circles and in
[49:56] cycles now
[49:58] one cycle manifests on earth then he
[50:00] breaks another circle
[50:01] was it last year a couple years ago we
[50:03] had
[50:05] hurricanes all over the place there's
[50:07] this hurricane maria hurricane this
[50:09] hurricane that hurricane that
[50:11] there was a time you see earthquakes on
[50:12] the earth there's this earthquake
[50:14] moving here in africa in asia in europe
[50:17] in north america in south america
[50:19] now it's a universal disease called
[50:21] coronavirus
[50:22] the crowning crowning of satan's
[50:25] ministry
[50:26] and as the disease is crowning isaiah
[50:28] chapter 16 verse 1
[50:30] teaches us maybe let's read it amen i
[50:33] haven't read scriptures but you are the
[50:34] scripture expressed
[50:35] let's read that scripture that's not my
[50:37] scripture but i felt like to read it
[50:39] praise be to god
[50:42] isaiah 60 verse 1
[50:48] our lord is good
[50:53] okay isaac is still running he said
[50:56] 16 isaiah chapter 6 verse 1 arise
[50:59] shine for thy light is come and the
[51:02] glory of the lord is risen upon thee
[51:04] for behold the darkness shall cover the
[51:06] earth and gross darkness the people but
[51:09] the lord shall arise upon you
[51:11] upon thee and his glory shall be seen
[51:13] upon thee amen
[51:15] darkness is covering the earth as we see
[51:17] this chronovirus
[51:18] all over the earth but at the same time
[51:22] not after not before but at the same
[51:24] time
[51:25] the glory of the lord is arising or is
[51:28] it raising
[51:28] you to shine where you are amen
[51:32] so the power of god is in you not that
[51:34] in the future
[51:35] in eternity when you drop this flesh you
[51:37] don't need healing
[51:38] healing is beyond you that's right it's
[51:40] just like god taking you from the ocean
[51:43] and then you want to go and eat seaweed
[51:46] you've gone beyond seaweed when you're
[51:48] in the ocean that's the other food you
[51:50] can afford
[51:51] the fish they can afford the sharks they
[51:53] can go to grocery and buy uh
[51:55] things that will be processed in the
[51:56] grocery right they can't get those
[51:58] fries so when you're on the ocean you
[52:01] make use of what is in the ocean
[52:03] when you're on earth we make use of what
[52:04] you have on earth on the other side you
[52:06] go way beyond healing
[52:08] the body doesn't get sick you cannot
[52:09] even cry so what are you going to need
[52:11] healing for
[52:12] right you cannot die none of your loved
[52:14] ones can die so you don't need healing
[52:16] on the other side of eternity but on
[52:18] this side of eternity
[52:19] that is when you need healing that's why
[52:21] the lord has put those attributes
[52:23] in you and i to manifest the healing
[52:25] when you fall sick
[52:26] or when our loved ones for sick or when
[52:28] the world forsake amen
[52:30] so the same time that coronavirus is
[52:31] going on let's not
[52:33] make it overwhelming that god we don't
[52:35] have a christ
[52:36] in us to solve the problem amen we're
[52:38] going to find out that is not we are not
[52:40] the first person to encounter pandemic
[52:42] and this or the prophet there was
[52:43] pandemic and even the prophet he prayed
[52:46] for a vasin because he knows that not
[52:48] everybody can receive divine healing

[52:53] people and that god put us under
[52:54] different measures
[52:56] some people they are level that is no
[52:57] they can't receive it they are not built
[52:59] for that but the sovereign lord being so
[53:01] kind and loving
[53:02] he made a way for scientists he broke
[53:04] his laboratory for them to break through
[53:06] the lab
[53:07] and then find inventions and discoveries

[53:10] this when the addison this these
[53:12] molecules can destroy
[53:14] gems it can kill this virus it can cure
[53:16] cancer it can do this it can do this
[53:18] it's the lord who does all the healing
[53:20] he's not a scientist
[53:22] amen one member in the room we're
[53:24] discussing this
[53:25] and he was already in my ceremony
[53:26] already that's right true
[53:28] you really my someone you must be a
[53:31] prophet
[53:34] you saw what i was going to minister how
[53:35] the prophet even prayed in this time
[53:37] i think in 1960 there was not treatment
[53:40] for cancer
[53:40] so one is that we stand a lot for sex
[53:42] vaccine and all these vaccines
[53:44] and inoculation and we pray that the
[53:46] lord will give us
[53:47] a remedy for cancer as well now we've
[53:49] got a lot of remedies for cancer
[53:51] chemotherapy radiation
[53:52] and what have you so that you take off
[53:54] everybody because the lord doesn't leave
[53:56] anybody out
[53:57] even those who don't recognize him and
[53:59] they don't love him they hate him
[54:01] he still feed them he clothes them he
[54:03] gives them air
[54:04] he put blood in them he takes care of
[54:06] them even those who reject him outright
[54:09] those who don't want to receive his word
[54:10] his love is so overwhelming
[54:12] amen is so uh infinite
[54:15] yes it doesn't it's it's it's not
[54:17] limited
[54:18] it's not limited to those who love him
[54:20] alone it's beyond it's divine love
[54:23] it's unlimited love those who curse him
[54:26] those who crucify him
[54:27] he forgives them and still love them
[54:29] amen and that attribute is
[54:30] you and i so the lord sometimes allows
[54:32] situation that people that
[54:34] are dear to you they will curse you they
[54:37] will sass you
[54:38] they'll reject you they'll persecute you
[54:40] they'll hit you
[54:41] they'll throw i mean put you down
[54:43] they'll do whatever they will do
[54:44] but you can come out of it your heart
[54:47] and pray for them
[54:48] and love them because you are a daughter
[54:50] of elohim
[54:51] you are expression of the attribute of
[54:53] elohim you are elohim
[54:55] manifested on earth amen if people will
[54:57] see elohim they have to see it in you
[54:59] because they don't see it in you people
[55:01] think there's no god why
[55:03] if there's god why are people suffering
[55:05] why there's no corona why are they
[55:06] scrooner virus
[55:07] because they are using their intellect

[55:12] who manufacture this heart i've never
[55:14] seen my heart before

[55:17] before but you can feel this heart
[55:19] that is pumping and i mean circulating
[55:21] blood in your body
[55:22] you might not see god physically with
[55:24] your eyes but if you can look
[55:26] down you can hear his voice everywhere
[55:28] you can see him in creation
[55:30] you don't even need to read the bible to
[55:31] see the lord you see him all around
[55:34] you you see him in his people amen the
[55:36] lord he is good

[1:05:15] him so shall i see it be six
[1:05:17] and he believed in the lord so what the
[1:05:19] lord told him he swallowed it that's
[1:05:21] and he counted it to him for
[1:05:23] righteousness
[1:05:24] and he said unto him i am the lord that
[1:05:27] brought thee out of
[1:05:28] heir of the childish to give thee this
[1:05:30] land to inherit it
[1:05:31] and he said lord god where whereby shall
[1:05:34] i know that asha heritage
[1:05:36] night and he said unto him take me an
[1:05:38] effort of three
[1:05:39] years old and i want you to know the
[1:05:41] number three

[1:05:48] and a young pigeon
[1:05:49] and he took and he took unto him all
[1:05:52] this and he divided them in the midst
[1:05:54] and laid each piece one against another
[1:05:56] but the burst
[1:05:57] divided he not and when the fowls came
[1:06:00] down upon the carcasses
[1:06:01] abram drove them away and when the sun
[1:06:04] was gone
[1:06:04] was going down a deep sleep fell upon
[1:06:07] abram and lo
[1:06:08] a horror of great darkness fell upon him
[1:06:10] and he said unto abraham no
[1:06:12] of surety that thy seed shall be
[1:06:15] stranger in a land that is not theirs
[1:06:17] and shall save them and they shall
[1:06:19] afflict them for 400 years
[1:06:21] and also that nation whom the whom they
[1:06:22] shall save will i judge
[1:06:24] and after afterward shall they come up
[1:06:26] with great
[1:06:27] substance amen and thou shalt go
[1:06:31] to thy fathers in peace thou shalt be
[1:06:33] buried in a good old age
[1:06:35] amen shall we take our seed glory
[1:06:38] hallelujah to the lord
[1:06:40] that is abraham now abraham was called
[1:06:42] abram
[1:06:43] before then he inherited a promise
[1:06:44] called abraham abraham means father of
[1:06:47] nations
[1:06:49] amen god has added attribute manifest
[1:06:51] those attributes in the life of
[1:06:52] abraham and i want us to look at the
[1:06:54] word like i said today we're going to go
[1:06:56] a little further beyond the seven
[1:06:57] attributes
[1:06:58] and look at the word in hebrew that we
[1:07:01] use all the time the word
[1:07:03] a-m-e-n what is it amen
[1:07:06] right the root hebrew word is a man
[1:07:09] a-m-a-n
[1:07:10] a man and we want us to see certain
[1:07:12] meanings of amen
[1:07:15] glory hallelujah to you to the name of
[1:07:17] the lord
[1:07:18] the word amen has got
[1:07:21] three if you break it down it's got
[1:07:22] three parts it comes from
[1:07:25] a-m-a-m-a-n which is hebrew word for
[1:07:27] amen
[1:07:28] a man and that word means surely
[1:07:32] sure truly so be it
[1:07:35] as we know in english truthful
[1:07:39] that is a man then the the other word is
[1:07:44] e-m-u-n-a-h
[1:07:46] the faithful god emunah is the faithful
[1:07:48] god and when you break it down in the
[1:07:49] hebrew word
[1:07:52] sorry the next one yeah the emunah is
[1:07:54] faithful god if you break it down
[1:07:56] it means firmness security fidelity
[1:07:59] establish trustworthiness amen
[1:08:03] you are leaning on a gospel you are
[1:08:05] believing the gospel
[1:08:06] that gospel is for sure it's stable is
[1:08:09] the word of the lord is ye
[1:08:10] and amen it is stable it is
[1:08:13] it's fiddle it's not something that is
[1:08:14] infidel it's not something that is not
[1:08:16] truth it is worth worthy of believing it
[1:08:19] it's established it's something that is
[1:08:20] already established in the heaven
[1:08:22] forever o lord thy where they settle in
[1:08:25] heaven
[1:08:26] forever oh lord that where they settle
[1:08:29] in you
[1:08:29] amen the word is settled in you because
[1:08:32] you are heaven
[1:08:33] so emunah is feminist security of the
[1:08:36] word
[1:08:36] of the word of the lord just like
[1:08:38] abraham and the third is
[1:08:40] meth m-m-e-t-m-e

[1:08:49] that is stability certainty truth
[1:08:52] and faithfulness so the word amen has
[1:08:55] got
[1:08:55] this three breakdown that the word of
[1:08:58] the lord is amen
[1:08:59] is ye is stable is certain
[1:09:03] is trustworthy is is worth putting all
[1:09:06] your hopes on it
[1:09:07] because it doesn't fill you you can go
[1:09:09] to sleep on the word of the lord amen
[1:09:10] amen you can have peace in the word of
[1:09:13] the lord amen
[1:09:14] people don't have peace that's right
[1:09:16] people don't have what you have
[1:09:18] somebody was telling me in texas and
[1:09:20] they don't have uh people from amarillo
[1:09:22] they don't have a
[1:09:23] and uh forgotten the places they don't
[1:09:25] have the facilities the hospitals that
[1:09:27] can
[1:09:28] um cure or whatever not cure treat a
[1:09:30] chronic virus
[1:09:32] so they drive people from all the way
[1:09:34] from like 10 hours to san antonio texas
[1:09:36] and just only go there to die oh man
[1:09:40] before they get there they're ready they
[1:09:42] call it vegetable they go there
[1:09:44] before they get hospital because the
[1:09:46] beds are they don't have even enough
[1:09:47] verse
[1:09:48] but then if you have java jarrah in you
[1:09:51] yes you can be affiliated with corona
[1:09:53] but you can stand on your feet and tell
[1:09:56] that demon
[1:09:57] enter the spirit of death don't you see
[1:09:59] the mark on me
[1:10:01] don't you see who i am don't you know
[1:10:03] that i'm not one of your victims
[1:10:04] don't you sing that i am elohim
[1:10:06] incarnated on earth don't you see that
[1:10:08] elohim is living in me
[1:10:09] don't you see them i'm the word of god
[1:10:11] expressed on earth
[1:10:12] you don't have any jurisdiction over
[1:10:14] this property amen this is what the lord
[1:10:16] has what
[1:10:17] lauded for himself i'm consecrated unto
[1:10:19] the lord
[1:10:20] i am the aiming of the lord and you
[1:10:22] don't have any power over me
[1:10:24] you speak that demon you speak whether
[1:10:26] it's coronav
[1:10:27] covet 19 whether it's cancer tumor
[1:10:30] just limit whatever situation that
[1:10:32] authority that attribute
[1:10:34] is you amen and when you voice this out
[1:10:37] it becomes yeah and amen because you are
[1:10:39] a dimension
[1:10:40] just like david so was take soul as a so
[1:10:44] no soul
[1:10:44] take goliath as a kona virus and take
[1:10:47] david
[1:10:48] as the healer as the healing there's
[1:10:51] this giant standing
[1:10:52] before david the children of israel
[1:10:54] everybody's run away
[1:10:55] but david knew who he was that he wasn't
[1:10:58] by himself
[1:10:59] no he wasn't just an 18 year old old
[1:11:02] chap
[1:11:02] he was what christ in manifestation he
[1:11:05] was a prophet
[1:11:06] a priest and a king the lord anointed
[1:11:08] him to be that
[1:11:09] amen and so he let that attribute out he
[1:11:12] transferred the battle to the
[1:11:13] he who lives in him to his royalty to
[1:11:15] the deity
[1:11:16] to jehovah to keno amen to jovah sharma
[1:11:20] the very present tense in the time of
[1:11:21] help and david test the situation
[1:11:24] in the name of the lord and he didn't
[1:11:26] have to battle just one stone
[1:11:28] j-e-s-u-e j-e-s-u-s diver
[1:11:32] where g jehovah yahweh yahshua
[1:11:35] he picked it jesus christ and just swung
[1:11:38] it by faith and it went all the way
[1:11:40] meaning through and with all the gulat
[1:11:43] was a
[1:11:44] was a giant right i don't know i can't
[1:11:46] imagine probably i can't reach it to his
[1:11:48] level
[1:11:48] right he did it there was a little tiny
[1:11:50] spot which wasn't covered
[1:11:52] that was the spot that the stone around
[1:11:54] there hit him amen
[1:11:56] the spot that the world cannot cover
[1:11:58] they can't cover prayer
[1:12:00] they don't believe in prayer they think
[1:12:02] prayer is fanatics they think the word
[1:12:03] is fanatics
[1:12:04] but when you go on your knees to pray
[1:12:07] that is a
[1:12:08] place that is not covered you might not
[1:12:10] need prayers now
[1:12:11] you and your family are good but when
[1:12:13] you go in that place that is not covered
[1:12:16] and you take that stone just one stone
[1:12:18] of prayer faith
[1:12:19] and you see even you pray and put the
[1:12:21] stamp of god
[1:12:22] among amen
[1:12:26] on it is trustworthy amen heaven said
[1:12:29] hey
[1:12:30] my son troy has prayed my daughter
[1:12:33] rebecca has prayed
[1:12:34] my son gary has prayed my all my sons
[1:12:37] and daughters are praying
[1:12:38] and the lord began to do something you
[1:12:40] know what for they are sick yes
[1:12:42] i'm healing the earth for they are sick
[1:12:44] i'm driving i'm calling a
[1:12:46] wormwood back take your hands from the
[1:12:48] earth
[1:12:49] i'm calling a satan demon of a
[1:12:52] killing demon of corona get away from
[1:12:55] the earth
[1:12:56] and things begin to change when you know
[1:12:58] our position amen
[1:12:59] glory hallelujah to the lord the lord he
[1:13:03] is good blessed be the name of the lord
[1:13:05] let's go a little bit into the prophet
[1:13:07] situation because we are reading
[1:13:11] let's look into abraham before we go to
[1:13:13] abraham abraham
[1:13:15] before we go to brahman amen abraham had
[1:13:18] a need
[1:13:19] his need was not wasn't co corner virus
[1:13:22] but he wanted a child
[1:13:23] yeah and it was childless but the lord
[1:13:25] does things in steps
[1:13:26] right sometimes he can do everything at
[1:13:28] once and give it to you
[1:13:30] sometimes you bring it one step the next
[1:13:32] step
[1:13:33] right and the next step before you bring
[1:13:35] the finality
[1:13:36] amen you might not see the finality
[1:13:38] might bring you you want a bible
[1:13:39] you might not give a bible i'll give a
[1:13:41] bible cover thank god for the bible
[1:13:43] cover
[1:13:44] god will not give you a bible cover
[1:13:45] without giving you a bible right so
[1:13:46] you've got you've got a bible cover
[1:13:48] you better swap go dancing around hey
[1:13:50] i've got my bible where's the bible
[1:13:52] it's in the cover i can't see it i can
[1:13:54] see it
[1:13:55] amen so you have got faith you move by
[1:13:58] faith
[1:13:58] just be happy advertise testify i've got
[1:14:02] my bible
[1:14:03] but that was the bible i don't see the
[1:14:04] bible in your cover yes the bible is
[1:14:05] right there the lord has put it there
[1:14:07] you see when the lord wants you to see
[1:14:08] it amen amen so the lord
[1:14:10] called abraham to be a father of nation
[1:14:12] and this man
[1:14:13] went to childless for many many years
[1:14:16] and the lord
[1:14:16] gave him a servant at least got a
[1:14:19] servant to inherit him
[1:14:20] that's right but that wasn't the
[1:14:21] satisfaction that's right he wanted his
[1:14:23] own son
[1:14:24] so he prayed and the lord gave him who
[1:14:26] his wife helped him to get to ishmael
[1:14:29] so he moved into a first pool festival
[1:14:32] is what the seven eliezer
[1:14:34] second pool is his own son his uh
[1:14:36] ishmael was his
[1:14:37] blood son he's coming from his own loins
[1:14:40] but it wasn't coming from the woman that
[1:14:42] the lord allotted
[1:14:43] it was a permissible of the lord yeah
[1:14:45] the lord bless it for him
[1:14:46] that this will make you a little happy
[1:14:48] so abraham take ishmael
[1:14:49] shabram was happy yeah until a certain
[1:14:53] point
[1:14:53] abraham knew that ishmael was going to
[1:14:55] be his son yeah even he said lord
[1:14:57] bless ishmael he's my son it's my from
[1:14:59] my own loins blessing the listener no
[1:15:01] that son has to come from between you
[1:15:03] and sarah
[1:15:04] right amen so as long as not between you
[1:15:07] and sarah
[1:15:08] yes i'll bless ishmael from hagar he's
[1:15:10] going to be a great man he's going to
[1:15:12] conquer nations and israel is the
[1:15:13] conquered nations you know
[1:15:15] if you know ishmael middle east israel
[1:15:18] and israel are still fighting now
[1:15:20] they are they are rich they've got all
[1:15:21] the oils they've got money they've got
[1:15:23] they can
[1:15:24] sponsor uh what they call it a sponsor
[1:15:27] al-qaeda
[1:15:28] sponsor evil terrorists in the world
[1:15:30] they've got money they've got
[1:15:31] religion they are conquering everywhere
[1:15:32] their religion is conquering every on
[1:15:34] their planet every nation you go
[1:15:36] ishmael is there israel is a great
[1:15:37] nation but ishmael is not the one that i
[1:15:39] spoke about
[1:15:40] amen the one i spoke about is going
[1:15:42] about isaac
[1:15:44] and finally the third pool came in isaac
[1:15:47] came in
[1:15:48] when he's already hundred and his wife's
[1:15:50] i was 90
[1:15:52] from when they married from maybe in
[1:15:53] their 20s young men
[1:15:55] young women now they are already old men
[1:15:57] and old men when it was impossible
[1:16:00] completely impossible that is when the
[1:16:02] lord sent
[1:16:03] the promisson to father abraham amen
[1:16:06] and abraham believed the lord that's why
[1:16:08] i said it was if you read a greek
[1:16:10] version said it was credited to him
[1:16:13] if you read in english english he said
[1:16:14] it was accounted or something like that
[1:16:17] but the hebrew said it was accredited to
[1:16:19] him is to his credit
[1:16:20] that he was faithful the lord found him
[1:16:23] faithful believing
[1:16:24] the lord with all his heart that's right
[1:16:26] despite his condition despite his
[1:16:27] problems and his mistakes
[1:16:29] he still believed that he was faithful
[1:16:31] unto the lord or
[1:16:32] he counted the lord as being faithful
[1:16:34] amen so the lord put him through
[1:16:36] three pools the first pool of uh eliezer
[1:16:39] that was her servant secretary was a son
[1:16:42] but that was not a promising
[1:16:43] the third pool was isaac amen then the
[1:16:46] lord himself had a hidden pool
[1:16:48] that abram didn't even know about
[1:16:50] because when we building a house
[1:16:51] we don't build a house in a triangle if
[1:16:53] you look at this building it's got four
[1:16:54] corners one corner here
[1:16:57] this corner right third corner and
[1:16:59] fourth corner
[1:17:00] so the lord used eliezer he used ishmael
[1:17:03] he used isaac but there was a fourth son
[1:17:06] amen
[1:17:06] that was the lord jesus christ the son
[1:17:08] of the royal city of abraham
[1:17:10] now made the building complete amen all
[1:17:13] these three sons were human beings they
[1:17:14] were earthly
[1:17:15] but the first son is the jesus christ
[1:17:17] himself he was a royal
[1:17:19] seed of abraham the lord jesus christ
[1:17:22] amen
[1:17:23] and the lord fulfilled all of them so
[1:17:25] there's nothing that the lord didn't do
[1:17:27] everyone at one time
[1:17:28] he gave him a servant at least we've got
[1:17:30] somebody to inherit you
[1:17:31] he gave him ishmael and he was happy
[1:17:34] abraham wouldn't have bothered
[1:17:36] to have isaac he as a human being was
[1:17:39] satisfied with the ishmael
[1:17:40] but the lord wasn't satisfied with the
[1:17:42] ishmael
[1:17:43] sarah who brought who helped bring
[1:17:45] ishmael out was so dis satisfied with
[1:17:47] ishmael
[1:17:48] when ishmael and mum were mocking her so
[1:17:51] now they have to what the lord satisfy
[1:17:52] abraham and
[1:17:53] sarah with isaac but then the lord has
[1:17:55] to satisfy
[1:17:56] himself and abraham and sarah with
[1:17:59] perfection
[1:18:00] four is a number of deliverance three is
[1:18:02] perfection
[1:18:04] one is uh omnipotent all alone two
[1:18:07] is number of multiplication by by the
[1:18:09] lord three is perfection four is the
[1:18:10] number of deliverance so the lord has to
[1:18:12] bring
[1:18:12] deliverance among the royal seat of
[1:18:14] abraham amen
[1:18:16] because isaac cannot deliver you an eye
[1:18:19] but the rest of abraham jesus christ
[1:18:20] is a tenor he's god himself amen
[1:18:24] praise be to god the lord he is good i
[1:18:26] want us to read something
[1:18:28] from the quotes of the prophet
[1:18:31] blessed be the name of the lord and
[1:18:33] let's see how we can intercede for our
[1:18:35] nations for our family for ourselves
[1:18:40] that the lord will heal our land that we
[1:18:43] pray
[1:18:44] that there will be a vast sin for the
[1:18:46] people of the world amen
[1:18:47] you might not need a bar sin but there's
[1:18:50] somebody who needs a mercy
[1:18:51] so the lord will throw the land and take
[1:18:53] discover that way let's read

[1:19:51] messy to them
[1:19:52] but it brings forth new life i'm so glad
[1:19:54] paragraph 45
[1:19:56] you know there was a time when there
[1:19:57] were there wasn't any toxin
[1:19:59] on earth for smallpox in other words
[1:20:01] like there was no vaccination

[1:23:11] cancer then that's right
[1:23:12] praying constantly that the god will
[1:23:14] give us something for cancer
[1:23:16] for poor suffering people anything can
[1:23:19] can do anything can do to help i'm for
[1:23:21] it yes sir i'm 100
[1:23:23] for it and if you are christian people
[1:23:25] would you pray more
[1:23:26] for certain as that we will be better
[1:23:28] off the whole country would
[1:23:30] yes great men they give their lives just
[1:23:33] trying to fight back
[1:23:34] at those things that crippled children
[1:23:36] and everything certainly
[1:23:37] in other words people scientists were
[1:23:39] researching because people were born
[1:23:41] crippled and there was nothing they
[1:23:42] could do for them
[1:23:43] people with their children a lot of
[1:23:45] diseases in those times that's why they
[1:23:47] gave back to a lot of large family
[1:23:49] if you listen give it to sister children
[1:23:51] and five survive all alive
[1:23:53] praise god if you get ten and two or
[1:23:55] five survive
[1:23:56] praise god those time they marry very
[1:23:58] early 14 16 because
[1:23:59] people died just like that there wasn't
[1:24:01] this fascination and distance on earth
[1:24:04] but by the grace of god the prophet's
[1:24:05] time he was praying for more
[1:24:07] and now his prayer has brought cancer
[1:24:09] vaccine because they pretty didn't have
[1:24:11] cancer
[1:24:11] chemotherapy and radiation and all those
[1:24:14] uh
[1:24:15] not cancer vaccine but on all those
[1:24:16] camera cancer remedies that we have now
[1:24:18] but through that they've got it now now
[1:24:20] we've got chronovirus
[1:24:22] that the scientists don't have the vase
[1:24:23] in so it's you and i our duty to pray
[1:24:26] that they break through because not
[1:24:27] everybody can receive divine healing
[1:24:29] like you can do
[1:24:30] not everybody has got elohim in him not
[1:24:33] everybody has got
[1:24:34] holy ghost in him nobody not everybody
[1:24:36] has got even a representative in him
[1:24:38] but yes on earth we all need blessing
[1:24:41] amen
[1:24:42] on earth you are not a farmer but yes so
[1:24:44] you eat every day
[1:24:45] we don't know where the food is coming
[1:24:47] from somebody farm
[1:24:49] they their hands are carlos you know
[1:24:52] they do planting they do hoeing
[1:24:54] and they wake up and do things we don't
[1:24:55] know what goes on in that world
[1:24:57] but then we god has blessed us to have
[1:24:59] grocery uh what farmers market wherever
[1:25:01] you go and buy your corn buy or
[1:25:03] whatever you buy and come and prepare
[1:25:05] your food that's a blessing so the lord
[1:25:07] has put you on earth you and i on earth
[1:25:09] to pray even for certain that there
[1:25:11] could be a breakthrough so that
[1:25:13] we are not happy when people are dying
[1:25:15] it doesn't matter what are they your
[1:25:16] family or they are your country
[1:25:18] they are human beings amen amen the
[1:25:20] devil cannot create one
[1:25:21] one human being you cannot create one
[1:25:23] iota of cell in your body
[1:25:25] he's not a creator he's only can pervert
[1:25:27] and destroy
[1:25:28] but jesus christ came to give life and
[1:25:30] give it abundantly
[1:25:32] amen so your prayers you might not see
[1:25:34] it today
[1:25:35] but your prayers can change situation
[1:25:37] let me give example when i was in texas
[1:25:40] i think it was a bush time probably
[1:25:42] before bush or something early obama's
[1:25:43] time
[1:25:44] the price of gasoline was so high i
[1:25:46] don't know here it was almost
[1:25:48] i think four dollars and something per
[1:25:50] gallon
[1:25:51] it was like so this is too much because
[1:25:54] you get your paycheck and a lot of them
[1:25:55] go to
[1:25:56] gas especially when you have to drive
[1:25:57] like an hour or 30 minutes to work
[1:25:59] so when there was a gas station and
[1:26:01] something came out i had that god can
[1:26:02] hear everything
[1:26:03] it doesn't have to be sickness and i
[1:26:05] pray lord let the price of gas come down
[1:26:08] amen i just prayed in my heart or
[1:26:10] whatever it began became a prayer topic
[1:26:11] for me for some time
[1:26:13] and i left it probably within a year or
[1:26:16] more or less the prices begin to america
[1:26:20] begin to draw oil and the prices in the
[1:26:22] middle east they
[1:26:23] kind of have the price their prices came
[1:26:25] down because now
[1:26:26] the whole world is drilling unlike fest
[1:26:28] america had an oil but they wanted to
[1:26:30] con
[1:26:30] reserve it for whatever but now they
[1:26:32] begin to draw they call it baby draw
[1:26:34] when obama came
[1:26:35] drew baby drill and clinton and coal so
[1:26:37] we will begin to draw
[1:26:39] so now the price is not wasn't detected
[1:26:41] only by the mother east
[1:26:42] who was sponsoring terrorism the price
[1:26:44] came i remember i bought a
[1:26:46] gas price for less than a dollar 96 cent
[1:26:50] and i was a disney this wedding is for
[1:26:51] food it didn't matter how long it took
[1:26:54] it didn't matter the politics and listen
[1:26:56] but my i can't say for myself
[1:26:58] because i go and buy gas price for
[1:27:00] almost four dollars or
[1:27:01] a little more than four dollars but now
[1:27:03] it's less than two dollars
[1:27:05] somewhere good gas station less than a
[1:27:07] dollar you can fill your tank with about
[1:27:09] twenty dollars or less it's the grace of
[1:27:12] the lord
[1:27:13] so the lord has put you in if you only
[1:27:14] can believe
[1:27:16] all things are possible if you only will
[1:27:18] let yourself go don't think about it
[1:27:19] speak it and believe it
[1:27:21] pray it and the lord will let it come to
[1:27:23] pass amen
[1:27:25] so we are not troubled there could be a
[1:27:26] vaccine tomorrow there could be a
[1:27:28] vaseline next year
[1:27:29] to help suffer mankind so you and i our
[1:27:31] prayer can go help that
[1:27:33] amen we might not be the one developing
[1:27:35] the vast sin we might not be the
[1:27:36] scientist
[1:27:37] but your prayer can give a breakthrough
[1:27:39] the lord will listen to my daughters are
[1:27:41] praying in west palm beach
[1:27:42] my sons and daughters are praying let me
[1:27:44] give vase in a breakthrough
[1:27:46] it doesn't matter where it's coming from
[1:27:47] amen and it's chronovirus we contain
[1:27:50] so that we can also be expressed
[1:27:52] ourselves more better than we
[1:27:53] than we are now amen glory be to the
[1:27:56] lord
[1:27:57] praise god so there's nothing there's
[1:27:59] something in you divine attribute of
[1:28:01] christ in you
[1:28:02] that surpasses everything that is way
[1:28:05] beyond
[1:28:06] your problems amen if you can god will
[1:28:09] help us to specialize in yielding being
[1:28:10] sensitive to the lord
[1:28:12] and yielding to the lord sometimes your
[1:28:14] mind can
[1:28:16] battle you with troubles your mind can
[1:28:18] tell you
[1:28:19] you can't do this this is limited you
[1:28:22] can't go this way this problem is not
[1:28:23] going to be solved
[1:28:24] this sickness everyone that gets
[1:28:26] sickness died in my family my
[1:28:28] grandfather died of cancer my
[1:28:29] great-grandfather died of cancer
[1:28:30] this one out of tumor and here i am oh
[1:28:33] here my family member is diagnosed
[1:28:34] he's the one going next but if you can
[1:28:38] all the children you can tell your mind
[1:28:40] to shut up
[1:28:42] right tell the man to shut up like let
[1:28:44] me use that phrase for example
[1:28:46] the anima that chatter in the phrase is
[1:28:48] what is the squirrel
[1:28:49] coco is chatting everywhere as if he's
[1:28:52] the king of the forest
[1:28:53] meanwhile the lion who is the king of
[1:28:55] the forest will be just
[1:28:57] be somewhere quiet but when the lion
[1:28:59] steps in
[1:29:00] when it's time for the lion to eat and
[1:29:01] he steps up from his from his
[1:29:03] uh i won't say hiding place but from his
[1:29:05] from his little
[1:29:06] uh habitat where he lives and he give a
[1:29:09] yell
[1:29:10] womb even the ant the elephant
[1:29:14] the butterfly all of them know that the
[1:29:16] king
[1:29:17] has arrived everybody shut up
[1:29:20] the squirrel who's been chattering shut
[1:29:23] up he doesn't just have to go into the
[1:29:25] you know they have burrows in the in the
[1:29:29] trees
[1:29:29] he goes deep into the barrel and when
[1:29:31] hide the kid is here i don't want no
[1:29:33] trouble
[1:29:34] the same thing doesn't matter the
[1:29:35] problem if you
[1:29:37] the king of christ queen jesus christ in
[1:29:39] jesus christ
[1:29:40] the holy ghost in you if you can believe
[1:29:42] that christ in you
[1:29:44] and you pray and speak the word don't
[1:29:46] worry about how
[1:29:47] when you might not have to do nothing to
[1:29:49] do with it yours is just a prayers
[1:29:52] yours is just the word the rest could be
[1:29:54] the politicians the worlds could be the
[1:29:56] city
[1:29:56] it could be the nation it could be
[1:29:57] whoever it could be the doctors
[1:30:00] your word will push them to do what
[1:30:01] needs to be done amen
[1:30:04] amen your prayers will push them to line
[1:30:07] things for you
[1:30:08] the way you want it you might not you
[1:30:10] might not even have to vote to frankly i
[1:30:11] don't vote
[1:30:12] because if i don't have a candidate i
[1:30:13] won't vote right but i don't whoever god
[1:30:15] needs to put it there to fulfill the
[1:30:17] purpose of god
[1:30:18] god will put him there i don't have to
[1:30:20] fight about who's going to be in office
[1:30:22] it's not my problem whoever wants to be
[1:30:24] there whether they make the whole
[1:30:25] country gay
[1:30:26] it doesn't matter it doesn't matter they
[1:30:29] will fulfill the word of the lord
[1:30:31] you don't have to do nothing to do with
[1:30:32] it you believe the word and whoever god
[1:30:34] put it there
[1:30:35] go to fulfill his word amen let me read
[1:30:38] you something here
[1:30:39] brown talk about in his time amen
[1:30:42] he talked about kennedy
[1:30:45] there was a problem and kennedy sent a
[1:30:48] military to
[1:30:49] the south and let's see how even god
[1:30:52] used politicians for the word of god
[1:30:53] hebrew series
[1:30:55] hebrews series chapter 1 57-0821
[1:30:59] hebrews paragraph
[1:31:02] 119 is that i see where our president mr
[1:31:05] kennedy
[1:31:06] tom i believe his name is kennedy that
[1:31:09] sent down
[1:31:09] sent down for this so many offices down
[1:31:12] for this segregational war
[1:31:14] he sent down 400 and something down in
[1:31:17] the south
[1:31:18] to stop the segregation award and when
[1:31:20] he ended up
[1:31:21] at his four course they could send no
[1:31:24] more
[1:31:25] he had exactly 666
[1:31:28] it was in times magazine oh if people
[1:31:30] was
[1:31:31] only spiritual could wake up and see
[1:31:33] what it is 666
[1:31:35] exactly what they had that's them that
[1:31:38] is in this month's
[1:31:39] time kennedy send people to the south
[1:31:42] to stop a segregation award and when he
[1:31:44] finished sending
[1:31:45] the military he had sent six six six
[1:31:48] people
[1:31:49] and kennedy was the first catholic
[1:31:51] president of the united states
[1:31:53] so even the politicians god is using
[1:31:54] them to fulfill the word of god it might
[1:31:56] not be the positivity you are fulfilling
[1:31:57] but god put them there amen so you don't
[1:32:01] have to worry about politicians
[1:32:02] you don't have to worry about black
[1:32:04] lives matter and wildlife matter
[1:32:06] right ours is what jesus christ matters
[1:32:09] amen
[1:32:09] christ for all nations amen christ for
[1:32:12] everybody whether blue green yellow
[1:32:14] white
[1:32:14] cream everybody is a creator of god
[1:32:17] creature of god amen
[1:32:18] we are one people amen where we live is
[1:32:21] what would give us our colors
[1:32:22] but we are one and same human humankind
[1:32:25] amen
[1:32:26] so the lord is using anybody to fulfill
[1:32:28] his word everybody and anybody
[1:32:30] but you as god as you are especially the
[1:32:32] exaggeration of the lord
[1:32:34] the lord has made you in a special way
[1:32:36] to fulfill a part of the world not
[1:32:37] everybody can fulfill
[1:32:39] and that's why we have to what wake up
[1:32:41] to our ministry
[1:32:42] now what is going on in earth right now
[1:32:45] is nothing strange it has happened over
[1:32:48] an hour before
[1:32:49] god allows uh things to happen to
[1:32:51] fulfill his work because he's moving
[1:32:53] this earth
[1:32:54] this has restart now it's not the way
[1:32:57] way it was before uh before the time of
[1:32:58] noah
[1:32:59] before the time of nowhere they don't
[1:33:01] they don't have long day and short night
[1:33:03] they don't have to adjust their watches
[1:33:05] they didn't even have watches then
[1:33:07] watches were developed by the swiss
[1:33:09] invented by the streets
[1:33:10] swiss people but now the sun light or
[1:33:13] the earth
[1:33:14] equally so we don't have like now it's a
[1:33:19] 134 here if you go to england it's
[1:33:22] four hours different so 5 34 somewhere
[1:33:25] or five hours
[1:33:26] difference you go to africa africa it's
[1:33:27] about four hours you go to china
[1:33:30] they're already monday philippines some
[1:33:33] are already monday
[1:33:34] because they're in the east the sun
[1:33:35] begins there before we see the sun
[1:33:38] but the lord allowed it in the time of
[1:33:39] noah the earth was shifted
[1:33:41] who shifted the earth one wood a wood
[1:33:44] worm there's an angel
[1:33:45] who controlled the waters and he's the
[1:33:47] one the lord sent on earth
[1:33:49] to shift the earth to bring the rain
[1:33:51] because in the time of noah before noah
[1:33:53] there was nothing like
[1:33:54] rain there was no cloud in the
[1:33:56] atmosphere you can't
[1:33:58] they didn't have this bible we read they
[1:34:00] read their bible from the zodiac they
[1:34:01] could see the sun
[1:34:02] and the movement of the sun tells them
[1:34:04] what the lord is doing on earth
[1:34:06] the moon the stars but then the lord
[1:34:08] wanted to bring more attribute
[1:34:10] clouds because he committed clouds so
[1:34:12] the lord formed clouds
[1:34:13] in the time of noah and the earth was
[1:34:16] before the water the other waters were
[1:34:17] around the earth
[1:34:19] we didn't have like six and seven
[1:34:20] continents we have now so now we have
[1:34:22] got the earth has been divided into
[1:34:24] seven
[1:34:24] to tell the seven church ages that was
[1:34:26] going to come
[1:34:27] they were all part of the word of the
[1:34:29] lord god was fulfilling the seven
[1:34:30] churches now we have gone through the
[1:34:31] seven churches
[1:34:33] beyond we are in the eighth day or back
[1:34:34] to tennessee when the seven churches are
[1:34:36] over
[1:34:37] christ is here right now dealing with
[1:34:39] his wife dealing with his people you and
[1:34:41] i
[1:34:41] amen so now god wants to go back to the
[1:34:44] beginning
[1:34:45] where there was no uh the way he made
[1:34:47] the earth in the beginning
[1:34:49] so all this going on uh hurricanes
[1:34:52] uh when he spoke remember 63 when
[1:34:56] the seas were open the lord told abram
[1:34:58] to pick up a rock right
[1:34:59] and say throw it in the air and he said
[1:35:01] earthquake will hit
[1:35:02] alaska the angel of the lord is the one
[1:35:04] that caused the earthquake
[1:35:06] and there has been a cascade of
[1:35:07] earthquake tornadoes
[1:35:09] movement shifting the earth to bring the
[1:35:11] earth back to where it used to be
[1:35:13] the way the lord wanted it to be because
[1:35:15] he's for keep on fulfilling his word
[1:35:18] so there's nothing strange about corona
[1:35:20] and the
[1:35:21] hurricanes and the earthquake the lord
[1:35:23] knows it all amen
[1:35:25] he's the one who's sitting on the throne
[1:35:26] and i want us to read something about
[1:35:28] what the lord taught about um the angel
[1:35:30] that moves the water

[1:38:19] from this side comes another angel his
[1:38:22] wormwood the one who has control over
[1:38:24] the water saying master
[1:38:26] have you looked down in babylon why
[1:38:29] you give me the jurisdiction over the
[1:38:31] unto the anti-deliverance distraction i
[1:38:33] broke up the
[1:38:34] springs of the deep and rain the waters
[1:38:36] out of the heaven
[1:38:37] i washed the earth off let me go down
[1:38:39] there this morning i'll wash babylon of
[1:38:41] the face of the earth
[1:38:43] i believe he could have done it
[1:38:45] eighty-four i can hear him say
[1:38:47] woodward you've been a good angel you've
[1:38:49] done
[1:38:50] you've done just what i told you in
[1:38:52] anti-delivery and distraction
[1:38:54] you cleared the earth and saved noah but
[1:38:57] i can't let you go
[1:38:58] so i want you to take turns over this he
[1:39:00] cleared the earth he didn't only destroy
[1:39:02] right but you saved noah yeah the same
[1:39:06] engine that brought the flood
[1:39:07] in nowhere's time he's the one that was
[1:39:09] protecting no one
[1:39:11] noah and his people could have what
[1:39:14] could have perished
[1:39:14] amen because it wasn't if you read the
[1:39:17] story it was it was
[1:39:18] flood it's not just a little flood right
[1:39:21] on the face of the earth
[1:39:23] right the lord was destroying that's a
[1:39:25] destroying angel
[1:39:27] and noah with the act that they built
[1:39:30] how
[1:39:30] could have the eye could have stood but
[1:39:33] it was in the same
[1:39:34] uh wormwood standing there protecting
[1:39:37] the ark
[1:39:38] that no demon can touch abraham and his
[1:39:41] group
[1:39:42] because abraham and his group are
[1:39:43] specially designated designation of the
[1:39:45] lord
[1:39:46] they are the word of god made flesh for
[1:39:48] that hour and abraham and noah
[1:39:50] received the word of the lord and his
[1:39:52] household and they believe the word
[1:39:54] and they're receiving their word they
[1:39:56] have become part of god
[1:39:58] and god cannot destroy himself and be
[1:40:00] god you can't take your arms off just
[1:40:02] stick
[1:40:02] take a knife cutting yourself up and it
[1:40:04] still be rather quick no you destroy
[1:40:06] yourself you're gone right so
[1:40:08] god cannot destroy you that's good and
[1:40:10] still be god
[1:40:11] he cannot destroy you and still be god
[1:40:14] because you are
[1:40:14] part of your designation of him amen
[1:40:18] so regardless of what is going on
[1:40:19] there's an angel of the lord protecting
[1:40:21] iran said that
[1:40:22] um there's going to be a prophecy about
[1:40:24] this he said there's going to be
[1:40:25] diseases that the doctors cannot
[1:40:27] do nothing about it they wouldn't have
[1:40:29] disease they won't have uh
[1:40:31] cure for it but those is that for those
[1:40:34] who don't have the baptism of the holy
[1:40:35] ghost
[1:40:36] they'll be swept but those who have got
[1:40:39] a baptism
[1:40:40] which is the seal of the lord they'll be
[1:40:42] spared
[1:40:43] they'll be protected because you are the
[1:40:45] remnant of the lord
[1:40:47] so the holy ghost that you receive the
[1:40:48] message i received that people mock you
[1:40:50] you suffered for it
[1:40:51] you lost your job you lost different
[1:40:53] things you lost your popularity
[1:40:55] that message is what is keeping you now
[1:40:57] and that message is what
[1:40:58] you are putting over your loved ones
[1:41:00] amen
[1:41:01] just like i said abraham wasn't selfish
[1:41:04] when the lord came and he was going to
[1:41:05] destroy sodom
[1:41:06] abraham didn't watch god oh yeah my my
[1:41:08] cousin a lot my nephew lord was
[1:41:10] stubborn he didn't listen to me he
[1:41:12] didn't believe my word yeah go go get
[1:41:14] him
[1:41:14] go destroy him right he didn't do like
[1:41:16] that that's not the spirit of christ
[1:41:18] yeah he doesn't like me you know he took
[1:41:20] the big that was my promise i need to
[1:41:22] the promise for himself and his family
[1:41:24] yeah here they go let them perish
[1:41:26] abraham stood in their way abraham said
[1:41:28] it's not worthy for a man to talk to god
[1:41:29] i want to ask you
[1:41:30] one question he said lord if you find 50
[1:41:32] before i go to the strategy he said no
[1:41:34] there's a lot it's not i'm for a man to
[1:41:37] talk to god face to face
[1:41:38] i mean some head off but let me ask one
[1:41:41] more if you find 40 begin to bargain
[1:41:43] with god like
[1:41:44] you know what there might be 50 people
[1:41:46] lord spare them and he bargained to
[1:41:47] about five or ten
[1:41:49] there wasn't not even enough five people
[1:41:52] who were
[1:41:52] righteous who were doing the word of the
[1:41:54] lord beside lord and the lost the lord
[1:41:56] said you know what i'll spell out
[1:41:58] your your nephew for you so he sent to
[1:42:00] angels
[1:42:01] and they went and what they spent pull
[1:42:03] out out
[1:42:04] before they burn the city and before
[1:42:06] anything could touch the earth
[1:42:08] you will not be here in the earth amen
[1:42:11] before something will
[1:42:12] touch down here the lord will protect
[1:42:14] you from here
[1:42:15] because jovanisi his job rapha he heals
[1:42:18] your sickness you are
[1:42:19] you are the expression of god and that's
[1:42:20] what the lord wanted us to know just
[1:42:21] like abraham everyone was mourning and
[1:42:23] yelling lord
[1:42:24] i have no child because he hasn't come
[1:42:25] to know that the harm
[1:42:27] has not been added to his name he
[1:42:29] believed god though he trusted god but
[1:42:31] he was looking at himself that i've
[1:42:32] passed beyond age and
[1:42:34] the person that i was hurting is my
[1:42:36] slave born in my house
[1:42:37] but the lord said no abraham not a slave
[1:42:40] but i will bring the promise to pass
[1:42:43] amen
[1:42:44] you are not going to go with the wind
[1:42:46] you are not going to go with the world
[1:42:48] you are not going to perish with the
[1:42:49] world the lord has protected you the
[1:42:51] lord has designated an
[1:42:52] angel one mood is here there is an anger
[1:42:54] of the lord the lord jesus christ
[1:42:55] himself is here on
[1:42:56] earth he's living in you he's in the
[1:42:58] atmosphere he's all around you
[1:42:59] to protect you and your loved ones amen
[1:43:02] and all that we need to do is believe
[1:43:03] him
[1:43:04] and the more you believe in you even
[1:43:05] think about your protection you now go
[1:43:07] beyond you abraham went beyond him
[1:43:09] and begin to what bargain for a lot
[1:43:11] begin to think about lord we can you the
[1:43:13] world will despise you
[1:43:14] people will despise you people that are
[1:43:16] dear to you will
[1:43:18] mock you they will call you names they
[1:43:20] will make you better they will walk down
[1:43:22] upon you they will destroy they'll call

[1:43:30] should be happy and rejoice
[1:43:31] that's right that you've been chosen of
[1:43:33] the lord you're not chosen by a man
[1:43:35] no you're not chasing by your family
[1:43:37] it's not your dad with you but the lord
[1:43:38] himself chose you
[1:43:40] the pastor didn't come and beg you like
[1:43:42] oh please come and follow my church

[1:43:53] shopping for you i'll give you a gift
[1:43:54] card

[1:43:59] brought you here and you have a purpose
[1:44:02] for you spending your time to sit here
[1:44:05] to hear from your pastor to hear from
[1:44:06] the ministers
[1:44:07] to pray to dress to portray christ
[1:44:10] yes you are doing it there's somebody so
[1:44:12] when there's chaos you can
[1:44:13] go to your bed and sleep because shalom
[1:44:16] is you are shalom
[1:44:17] amen you are the eternal truth of the
[1:44:20] lord
[1:44:20] there's nothing that can take your life
[1:44:23] if the lord finishes the lord hasn't
[1:44:25] finished with you
[1:44:26] when the lord is finishing you'll be
[1:44:27] singing sons of zion and you break into
[1:44:29] the atmosphere
[1:44:30] you are a pillar of fire and the more we
[1:44:32] get to know who we are the more we can
[1:44:34] express the attributes
[1:44:35] amen until abraham got to know who he
[1:44:37] was yes he has praised the lord
[1:44:39] but he was limited but when the lord
[1:44:41] came to admit abraham i'm going to make
[1:44:42] you maybe you don't know that you are
[1:44:44] part of me
[1:44:45] i'm adding harm to you i'm letting you
[1:44:48] know that
[1:44:48] you are just like i was elohim all by
[1:44:51] myself
[1:44:52] and you were all in me not expressed on
[1:44:54] earth until i began to create adam
[1:44:56] i'm going to create more of you
[1:44:59] something that will come from you
[1:45:01] not a servant that was born in your
[1:45:02] house not a servant but your own son
[1:45:05] coming from your loins
[1:45:06] will be the one who inherits you and
[1:45:09] everyone was surprised
[1:45:10] how come i'm already 19 my wife is go
[1:45:12] way beyond menopause
[1:45:14] but he believed the lord as we read from
[1:45:15] the bible and as long as the lord said
[1:45:17] it
[1:45:18] he put an aim into it a man to it
[1:45:21] immunity to it that is ye and amen amen
[1:45:24] it's established that's right
[1:45:25] there's nothing that is going to change
[1:45:26] the man of god so he went with it
[1:45:28] and the rest was not abram's problem the
[1:45:30] lord took care of everything
[1:45:32] amen and whatever the lord has promised
[1:45:34] you in your heart whatever you are
[1:45:36] expecting from the lord
[1:45:37] put before the lord it doesn't matter
[1:45:39] the conditions around you or in you
[1:45:41] your situ your human situation is the
[1:45:44] word of the lord and as you believe it
[1:45:46] you profess it it's already fulfilled
[1:45:48] amen
[1:45:49] the battle is over i don't have to fight
[1:45:50] your battle transfer to the
[1:45:52] be like david be like abraham believe it
[1:45:55] and the word will manifest himself in
[1:45:56] you
[1:45:57] praise be to the lord glory be to the
[1:46:00] lord
[1:46:01] there's nothing that is impossible with
[1:46:03] the lord with the lord
[1:46:05] the lord saves and he saves completely
[1:46:08] he's adonai his elohim
[1:46:12] is that i am that i am sometime when i i
[1:46:14] read the bible
[1:46:15] and look at those attributes i am when
[1:46:17] moses came to him
[1:46:19] and said he called moses he said go and
[1:46:21] rescue my people and say lord if i go
[1:46:23] and
[1:46:23] ask me what is your name saturday i am
[1:46:26] that i am i am who i am amen
[1:46:30] there's only one person who can say that
[1:46:32] that's right it's a king
[1:46:33] that's right just a president so who i
[1:46:36] tell the president
[1:46:38] if you don't know if the president
[1:46:39] united states you know
[1:46:41] donald trump so he said the president
[1:46:44] there's only one president in the united
[1:46:46] states
[1:46:47] if you go outside you have another
[1:46:48] president right but when you come to the
[1:46:50] universe there's only one
[1:46:51] christ that's right there's only one
[1:46:53] elohim
[1:46:55] there's only one i am there's only one
[1:46:57] person who can say i
[1:46:58] am that i am amen and if i am missing
[1:47:01] you

[1:47:04] amen glory don't fear nothing amen
[1:47:08] don't be don't be afraid yes we do
[1:47:10] everything but don't let fear grip you
[1:47:12] glory that is not your portion amen you
[1:47:15] can speak your the word it doesn't
[1:47:17] matter
[1:47:17] and the disease will take go away amen
[1:47:20] you can pray and the holy ghost will
[1:47:23] command the angel
[1:47:24] that such and such a person pray my
[1:47:27] daughter pray for this person
[1:47:28] go get him at the hospital take your
[1:47:30] hands off him and the person will come
[1:47:32] back home
[1:47:33] amen you can pray somebody in some
[1:47:35] somewhere
[1:47:36] not even here in west palm beach the
[1:47:38] lord can use your prayer
[1:47:40] because your prayer is not limited to
[1:47:41] the room it's not limited to you your
[1:47:43] flesh
[1:47:44] it's not limited to your strength your
[1:47:46] prayer is the prayer of the word of
[1:47:47] elohim
[1:47:48] i am that i am and when you pray and
[1:47:51] speak the word of i am
[1:47:53] take creative power there are four four
[1:47:55] elements
[1:47:56] that elohim uses amen he uses the water
[1:48:00] look at where the hurricanes come from
[1:48:01] we talk about warm wood he controls the
[1:48:03] water
[1:48:04] if the lord wants to send hurricane for
[1:48:06] some reason
[1:48:07] he just can't create hurricane on
[1:48:08] whatever ocean atlantic ocean
[1:48:11] you might not see the angel but before
[1:48:12] realized there was a hurricane and most
[1:48:14] of the time it's coming from africa
[1:48:16] right some attributed to so many things
[1:48:18] i don't know but it's coming from
[1:48:20] somewhere
[1:48:20] pacific ocean and goes somewhere else
[1:48:22] where they're having a
[1:48:24] uh southern uh i think that was i
[1:48:27] forgotten at the time by the year
[1:48:28] when they were in louisiana they were
[1:48:30] having a gay
[1:48:31] festival they called it southern uh
[1:48:35] forgot to wait for it but we haven't
[1:48:36] given this festival hurricane katrina
[1:48:39] went and swept human beings as if it was
[1:48:42] sweeping ants
[1:48:44] sudden cut against whatever i forgot to
[1:48:46] wait but when the lord wants to do
[1:48:47] something they can just call one wood
[1:48:50] just a snap of a finger a woman will go
[1:48:52] and take and create the hurricane
[1:48:54] uses the water to swing reduce create a
[1:48:56] hurricane
[1:48:57] and take off situation the way he wanted
[1:49:00] if you want to use fire
[1:49:01] fire does not necessarily bush fire we
[1:49:03] have bushfires in california different
[1:49:05] places
[1:49:05] but fire is the war when there's war in
[1:49:08] battles
[1:49:08] that is a fire the lord can set up an
[1:49:11] angel
[1:49:12] the devil the devil is the anointed
[1:49:14] politicians and they
[1:49:15] go into war blow you and i blow you they
[1:49:17] do their war if there's
[1:49:19] water if there's air like we have krona
[1:49:21] it's in the air you don't see it
[1:49:22] physically
[1:49:23] but then it's the air in the atmosphere
[1:49:25] the same only goes the same holy ghost
[1:49:27] has got angel
[1:49:28] of the lord here who can say stop and
[1:49:30] the corona will stop
[1:49:32] right at once there was a thin second
[1:49:34] world war
[1:49:36] they didn't sign a treat treaty the law
[1:49:39] sent an
[1:49:39] angel to stop the war that was stopping
[1:49:41] uh the
[1:49:42] 11th month which is november the 11th
[1:49:45] hour
[1:49:46] the 11th day the 11 minutes the 11th
[1:49:48] second
[1:49:49] to ocean in the 11th hour libra workers
[1:49:52] the lord has an angels here
[1:49:54] you might not see them flying around you
[1:49:56] want to see them in your room
[1:49:57] but it's the angel of the lord you have
[1:49:59] a guardian a personal guardian angel
[1:50:01] each one of you as a son of god as the
[1:50:03] daughter of god
[1:50:04] that's why the lord wants you to be holy
[1:50:06] unto the lord because when you do
[1:50:07] certain things you keep away the angel
[1:50:09] the angels
[1:50:11] hate evil they hate wickedness they hate
[1:50:13] sin
[1:50:14] so as long as you let god take over your
[1:50:17] flesh take over your mind
[1:50:18] take over your heart and let the world
[1:50:21] go away
[1:50:22] the lord has come control and nothing
[1:50:23] can touch you amen
[1:50:25] you might be working the most dangerous
[1:50:27] place the people who are holding guns
[1:50:28] will salute you hello
[1:50:30] hello sis because they could see that
[1:50:32] you you can't be the attacker they are
[1:50:34] even afraid
[1:50:35] there was a time john wesley was going
[1:50:36] to preach on horses
[1:50:38] and he didn't have a vehicle so someone
[1:50:40] wanted to kill wesley
[1:50:42] and he went with his gun or whatever
[1:50:44] hiding under a bridge where
[1:50:45] wesley was i mean galloping his horse
[1:50:47] right and when
[1:50:49] wesley didn't know anything about
[1:50:50] somebody trying wanted to kill him he
[1:50:51] didn't
[1:50:52] know he was singing his songs and
[1:50:53] rejoicing and going to do his work
[1:50:55] and when the person wanted to kill
[1:50:57] wesley when he so wesley he saw a fire
[1:50:59] around him and he was like overwhelmed
[1:51:03] he saw a ball of fire around wesley
[1:51:06] and he surrendered to wesley that i
[1:51:08] wanted to do this and lose it to you
[1:51:10] but i saw you at the you are the holy
[1:51:12] one you are the one of the holy one
[1:51:14] he wouldn't touch wesley until the lord
[1:51:16] finished with wesley and he died at
[1:51:17] eight something eight
[1:51:19] years of age so there's nothing that can
[1:51:21] touch you
[1:51:22] unless you do something you obey god as
[1:51:24] a child of god
[1:51:25] the only thing that can take your life
