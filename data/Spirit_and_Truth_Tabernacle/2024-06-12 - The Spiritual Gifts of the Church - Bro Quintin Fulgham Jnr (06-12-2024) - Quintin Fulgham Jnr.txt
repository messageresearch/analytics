Christ to pull oh Lord God so that you can come down and speak to them oh Lord a Word of Deliverance oh lord lord we give you all the praise and the glory from the beginning of the service to the end in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen amen so God bless you all uh we're going to get right into the message um so the message that the lord gave me was the spiritual gifts of the church um and so with this whole theme of restoration that we got we've got going on this year um I was kind of I I believe I felt a little bit inspiration from the one brother that came by and preached and talked about the speaking in tongues and interpretation uh those being some of the gifts being restored back and so I kind of wanted to kind of maybe possibly lay a foundation and talk on a little bit more on maybe a couple of the gifts as well so we're going to start our scripture reading from Corinthians well 1 Corinthians um chapter 12 uh verses uh 1 through two and I'll wait for everyone to get there and it reads now concerning spiritual gifts Brethren I would not have you ignorant ye know that ye were Gentiles carried away unto these dumb Idols even as ye were L and uh you may uh take your seats so I I I like this Bible verse here um because it shows that there has to be some kind of knowledge uh or knowhow in these spiritual gifts uh uh once we've uh um because the thing about it is the gifts are already in the church and each and every single one of you is a gift from God which means God has designed you and created you your personalities your characteristics the way you act the way you uh think about things God has created every single one of you as a gift so you are the actual uh uh gift right and so God then wants us to uh become knowledgeable about how to operate these gifts uh uh now that they're in the church because we're in the season of restoration and I liked how it says the word restoration because it means that you know your loved ones are gifts too right so just because they're out in the world or they may not be in church they're still God's gifts right and uh everything that God owns he has to restore back uh and I remember I was talking to brother Smiley one time and he said that um it's the gifts that can actually get you in trouble right gifts can actually uh uh uh take you out of the church uh if they're not operated properly right so um and continuing on with this theme uh so is the and uh the important thing about uh gifts and their purpose is it's always to benefit the church right it's it's the one thing that you have to get in your heart is that when God gives you a gift it's never for yourself it's to help somebody else right somebody else is dependent upon your gift or or the talent that God has G you to help them in a real need that they have so before you get into the gifts and various things the first thing you the first thing you need brother Joy was talking about is love right that's the first thing that we need and I believe that spirit and Truth has been grown in love just based off of these past uh sermons so we're understanding that it's love that keeps the thing binded together right and you can never get enough of love because love endures a lot of situations so you might be able to handle you know you might have may have had the love to handle one person in their Spirit but when someone else comes around with a different Spirit or a different challenge you know like how do you react so I like those moments where God where we where we start to grow in a little bit of love and then God throws something in our path to say well do you think you got enough love right so you can never have enough of it something we should always be striving for and when you and when you have real love a real Godly love the gifts are so easy right gifts become uh uh an easy thing to do it's not something you have to chase right but love will bring and you'll see the natural flow of God just manifesting them in our lives and and and again it's to benefit all of us right so if we're not being benefited by gifts in the church something is wrong right so we're going to read uh Corinthians 12 uh 4- 11 just to get a kind of foundation on this uh it says now there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit and there are diverse differences of administrations but the same Lord and there are diversities of operations but it's the same God which worketh all in all and that and that that statement right there as we're going to come back to that and it says but the manifestations of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all so it's benefit everybody in the church for to one is given by the spirit of spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by The Same Spirit to another Faith by The Same Spirit to another the gifts of healing by The Same Spirit to another the working of Miracles to another prophecy to another Discerning of spirits to another diverse kinds of tongues to another interpretation of tongues but all these worketh that one in the selfs Same Spirit dividing to every man severly as he will so the purpose of these gifts which every one of us has a a different gift so that means there might be something you have that I do not have and the reason why God puts that in place is because you have to humble yourself right it can be hard for people to Humble themselves and come to you and that's why we kind of live in a world today where everybody wants to know everything and be self-sufficient but it just doesn't work right uh back in the day you know it wasn't you never really left your family like nowadays you know people when they get old enough they get 18 years old they'll move across the country they'll move across the world but back then you know it was you were a family unit and you depended upon each other to help each other out you knew that your parents are getting old right and you couldn't take care of them while you living in Tokyo right like your parents needed you there um while they were going through their Old Stage so these different gifts uh um God gives them different to us so that we can all depend on upon each other and the problem is when man gets in the way of the gifts one it can create jealousy because when someone sees that you have something that they don't have well then they become envious but that wasn't the uh that wasn't the true purpose of why God made us all different it was actually to create more love like hey you got something that I don't have that can make me better I need you for this right it was the purpose of it was to create love and an appreciation that every single body in the church is important right so before we get into the uh gifts uh it's important for us to lay down a a foundation right um into catch the important uh sayings in the word so we're going back to the verse where it says but it's but it's it is the same God which worketh all in all uh and the reason I like that is because it applies an emphasis on Godly operation for structure and Order of the gifts right we don't want just we don't want the gifts just running all over the place uh with no purpose or with their own purpose right because then we can't be blessed right and um you know know if you look in the human body everything is structured and organized uh in order for you to be able to get up and do whatever you want you know if you you know I think Barn if you have like arthritis you know you're not your body is not working like it's supposed to but normally you know you would have your your bones will have joints and you'll have fluid in there so that you can move freely without any pain and stuff like that so your body is structured and organized in order to be able to allow you to be free and it's something you don't really think about so your body is not competing with each other your body parts aren't competing with each other everyone's working together so that you can get up move and uh and enjoy the day right so the the pastor mentioned something that was very very uh key thing and that was the way of how song specials go right uh uh uh the order for we have song specials so for example and just to kind of provide emphasis on this thing uh let's say for example brother Solomon was to uh you know he has two people scheduled to sing songs right and the first person comes out and I mean they're just saturated the anointings coming down and it just kind of changes the changes the atmosphere people are being blessed people are being delivered all right and he might keep that special kind of going on and just bring the pastor and bring the pastor or whoever the minister is out just because God is now kind of putting control of the service right and you know uh but the problem with that is that person that was supposed to sing next might get upset because maybe they really wanted to sing you see what I'm saying and the prophet uh talked about um the thing about gifts he said uh gifts always want to be used all right gifts always uh want to be used so we're going to uh turn to this quote uh in question and answers uh 54 0515 and it's paragraph 338 through 340 and I will read uh what the prophet said about this uh I'll just start reading and it says well that's the way it is about speaking in tongues Let It Come orderly just as the spirit will give it you can speak with tongues now you say well brother brandom I can't help it right the uh that's the the their gift of speaking in tongues is coming he said oh yes you can Paul said you could he said if there be one of you among you who speaks with tongues and there's interpreter let him hold his peace no matter how much it wants it wants to speak that's the gift he's talking about in the person hold your peace that's a gift brother I pray God will let me have a Revival here some of these days so we can get into them things for you you see where you can see it's a gift and that gift wants to operate all the time so it's not your fault if you if you if you have a gift and you like I really want to sing it's not your fault for that right God just made you that way as a singer right see but you've got to have the wisdom of the Holy Spirit to know when and how to operate that gift and that's the other part that a lot of Pentecostals don't understand is the operation and the Order of the gift because they just they kind of just kind of go all over the place so and you'll kind of notice it with people that you know people that have a gift of singing you'll notice it because they sing everywhere like I I I work with this one girl and she's a singer and I mean she just sings almost all the time and it's just it's just that gift that she has inside of her where she wants to she wants to sing right uh you know you'll have people that are ministers or preachers you know you'll be you'll be y'all will be out hanging out and then uh you'll see a sunrise you be like man I really love that sunrise and they just they just got to go deep with it like well you know there's nothing like the rising of the sun you know Matthew so and so in your mind you're like look I was just trying to enjoy this sunrise right but that gift inside of that man you know it wants to operate and be used and say something and he and and he he really can't help it right so we have to distinguish that we have to uh understand in our minds that just because it's a gift uh and being used doesn't equate to it being a blessing uh and that's where a lot of people get things wrong just because your gift is being used doesn't mean that it's someone someone is actually being blessed they may be blessed on the flesh but we're trying to get things that go inside of the Soul because that really anchors people into Christ and so uh you can think about it how um back in the day uh you know cuz a lot of times people get dogs and pets and you know everyone loves cute dogs and pets and things like that but dogs were bred for a certain purpose uh back in the day to get some kind of work done right and you'll know that um with hurting dogs or Shepherd dogs a lot of people love German Shepherds and they have this trait that is inside of them where they like to Hur people so you'll see that if you have like a little uh Shepherd dog or a little puppy it has it hasn't seen no cattle or no sheep or anything like that but it'll start nipping at people's ankles right and if you got a toddler it'll start nipping at the toddler's ankles and it's trying to hurt that child because that's what its purpose was and you have to be careful about that because that behavior be can become a negative where then it'll start biting it can cause harm so it's it's doing what it's trying to do because that's what it was bred for but you have to uh make sure that there's some guidance in there so that it doesn't become you know a negative thing right so and gifts that are not properly operated can be uh uh become destructive uh uh and a lot of people don't see that you know so for example which we'll get into later on in the message if I'm able to it's uh the gift of wisdom right wisdom is a gift uh and when not used it can cause a lot of harm uh to people so when you see a lot of people in the world getting into student loans and different kind of loans and they're getting sold on these things is because the people selling the loans got a lot of wisdom and they're trying to sell you something and in your eyes it looks like a green feel it looks like a green pasture that you're hey I'm getting all this money to be able to go to school but you don't see the other side of it right so that wisdom blinded you it's the same wisdom in the beginning when Eve when the serpent came to Eve and said hey hey you take this fruit you're going to be just like God you're going to see all these things and she saw the silver line and she saw the green pasture but what she didn't see was the destruction behind it so that wisdom blinded her right that wisdom is something that uh blinded her and Jesus Christ himself actually used wisdom to blind as well when he told the people unless you drink of my blood and eat of My Flesh you have no part in me right now that wisdom blinded for good right because what it did was it got rid of unbelief it got people it got rid of people that weren't really for God right and that's a good purpose of wisdom right versus a purpose of wisdom that comes into the church and starts uh talking strange doctrines and that can end up dividing a church and I know a lot of you have probably already seen it I've experienced in my life where people will come into the church uh every one is oh we love the Lord we love the Lord but then when it starts coming down to different doctrinal principles uh and things that are a little bit off the off the word you'll see that there's actually a buildup in the Church of people that believe that and all of a sudden the church separates right so that's why uh wisdom has to be used uh in a Godly way uh um if you have that gift of wisdom right um so there's always um and this is to and this is to emphasize um um the god The Godly operations of gifts because there's always two things there's always two ways to do things God way God's way and your way right God's way and your way right so um now the church is is Sovereign in itself and the church can uh uh decide how it wants to operate based off of things like you know how long your song Services some Churches song service is 2 hours preaching is 30 minutes now I mean that's how they operate right some people have uh two services on Sunday two services on Saturday right uh and that's how and that's uh uh the way that they operate what time the church start what time what time the church starts and what time it ends it's the sovereignty to choose how they want to operate those things but God can change things up anytime uh and that's the most important part is that you're sensitive to the spirit and how it's operating instead of just how you normally do things from a day-to-day basis right right so that's why you can't just focus on gifts right but you have to focus on God how do you want things to be done right because we have to we have and like I said before we have to realize this is that every single one of us has to bury this down inside of our hearts all the gifts in the church are for you it's not for operation it's not just to it's not to put on a show it's not to uh show that someone is a great singer or someone is a great preacher teacher or whatever it's for you to be able to get something from God with you dealing what you're going through and dealing with something in life right now that is the purpose of the gifts right so you know um when I say that God changes the program or the operation of the gifts it's God changing it but it's your faith that does it right it's your faith that comes down and causes a shift in the way that things are done in order for God to speak to you uh I remember one time sister birs had said that you know she had came up here and she was going to sing a special she said you know I had a special in my mind but God kind of uh told me to come and sing this song What what that was is somebody in church was pulling on God for a specific word and God said hey I want you to sing this song because it's going to touch their heart right so God pulled down on that gift and changed the complete operation of where it was going right um and so um and and it happens in preaching you know if you have a need on your heart right now you know it's uh uh and you need to hear a word from the Lord you can pray in your heart right now and say Lord I need I need the preacher I need you to say something to the preacher that's going to confirm something or help me out in this situation and God would just change the notes God to change the direction of the preaching God to change my ideas God to say no no no no no I need you to start saying about this thing because somebody needs a word right so it's not me up here just trying to uh uh preach a message or talk wisdom or knowledge or all these things I'm trying to help you guys out you guys have needs but you have to pull and God and you can only do it by faith right it has to be by faith it's one of the things it's one of the things that God has uh instituted and we're going to actually get into that uh uh uh a little bit here because the prophet was actually corrected by God in the way that he was operating the healing services so um because they had a system there with uh with these things called prayer cards where you put your name down in the prayer card and they'll randomly call your name up there and then you could go up there before the prophet tell him what you needed and then he would pray for you right but you know how man gets when they get into these systems and you don't know exactly who exactly was getting the prayer cards how often they were getting the prayer cards and so it could be kind of shady and uh it could probably get kind of shady and so God got on brother him and told him that's not the way that it's supposed to be done right because the gift of healing was the prophet right and the prayer cards was a way of man trying to operate within that gift right and God said that the program operates by faith right that's why the prophet you'll hear in the messages the prophet will turn into the audience and be like hey you lady up there that's praying in the balcony uh with the stomach issue God heard you go out here healed right that's the way how it operates uh God will change the service got to change uh uh um the program got to change the mindset of people in order to get a word uh for you right and the prophet taught us that you don't need a a prayer card all you need is Faith so that's kind of the foundational uh uh um um uh the foundations of gifts is that one it's always God's program we're always trying to do what we can do to help the Lord but sometimes uh when someone really really gets down there in Faith uh and it's no different than the woman with the blood issue uh when Jesus was passing through the through the crowd he had a program they they all had a program they all had a destination that we that they were going but this one lady by faith touched Christ and he said well who touched me and we know that it was a touch to Faith and she was able to stop the direction and program of where they were going in order to get something for her situation right so that's the foundational thing first is um understanding that one uh God operates the gifts God operates every single gifts it's not you trying to do anything but it's Lord how do you want to use this gift through me right and then the other thing to remember is that it's the church the gifts are all for you the gifts every single gift is for you in order to help you in your time of need so we're going to start our journey with the gifts um 're we're probably not going to get to all of them um but we're going to start with um corinthians: 128 to get our first talk about our first gift 128 yep and I'll just start reading it and it says 4 to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by The Same Spirit right um now I went on line to look up what these definitions of were and we're kind of going through this journey because I want you to be able to see if you can identify yourself in the scriptures to know what gifts that you have because I know we've we've talked about how brother uh brother Wesco has a gift of faith everybody knows brother Wesco has a gift of faith and we appreciate that but we want a gift of faith within spirit and Truth Tabernacle so that if I'm going through something because I I mean I don't know how much how big my faith is but if some if one of you has a gift of faith and I need a increase in salary on my job I want to be able to go to you or contact you and say hey can you pray for me so I can get an increase in my salary I want to be I want to be able to humble myself like hey I've been praying and been trying this and trying this and that but I know you have a real gift of faith and I want to come to you and use this thing right that's how it should be we want to be able to identify ourselves but first we have to know what the gifts are and you have to be able to see yourself in that and know how uh to operate it right so with our first Gifts of wisdom and knowledge I looked online line for the definition of wisdom and I found this one that I really really liked and it says that U wisdom allows people to judge what is right true or lasting and I like that key like that last word lasting because it means it's something that is not shaky it's something that's going to be steady right so you know you have a lot of people that may be into Investments and stuff like that and those ones that like to make quick decisions and shortcuts for like the quick profits they don't have a lot of wisdom right A wise person would say no no no no no this is a safe investment this is a safe uh uh place to put your money in because then by the time you get to this age you know you'll actually have a a lot of money invested so it's a lasting decision these W these people with words of wisdom uh or the gift of wisdom are able to give you stuff that will help you to last uh your choosing of a wife or a husband you know they'll say hey hey you want someone that gots the Holy Ghost because that's going to help uh keep your relationship lasting uh uh Through the Ages and through the ups and downs because there's a lot of people that have gotten I wouldn't say words of wisdom but advice or worldly advice on who to marry and marriages have struggled right it did not last because it wasn't a word of wisdom right and I like the definition because it's scriptural and it's really really simple Le uh because when you talk about judging things that are right and true uh the first person that comes to mind is King Solomon right King Solomon we know is one of the wisest people in the Bible and when you talk about King Solomon you have to also talk about the Book of Proverbs right so the gift of wisdom in the church is there for is there to help people make right decisions so uh and just to kind of give an example A lot of people a lot of young ones looking for job opportunities looking where they want to go to school you may not have the gift of wisdom to make that choice and so you have to come to someone in the church and say hey hey hey I'm thinking about going to this school or I'm thinking about taking this career path and someone that has a gift of wisdom if they see that it's a career that could pull you away from God they know that that decision is not a lasting decision they'll say no I wouldn't advise you on that one right I wouldn't advise you to take that career or if they know that the city where your college is is full of sin and could pull you away from God you're like no I don't think you should probably go to that school right and it's not them trying to and and the thing about it you have to understand the gifts are not people but it's Christ in the People speaking to you trying to help you so it's not the individual and a lot of times a lot of times that gets tough because of personalities but Jesus made a comment to kind of erase that thing he said if you can't believe me believe in the words that I tell you he knew that people would struggle with people's personality and I and actually um as as kind of like a a a little testimony to say or experience that I had with my mom cuz my mom has a personality right she's very very like she's a like a bull you know with her decisions and her personality is very kind of like you know she's uh uh I wouldn't say critical but she's always given advice even though you may not want to hear it right I'm trying to be careful because I know if she wants to listen to this I love you I I love [Music] you but she can be very critical in love I know she's doing it out of love and one time I was trying to I was doing some studying because I like to do research on my computer and stuff like that and I was doing some study and I'm all and I said and my mom's like what are you spending your time doing I said well I'm just trying to study you know I'm just trying to you know get a good job so I can save up and this and this and that and all these things she said but yeah but like when do you read your Bible and I I was like wow like you know how you want to be like you want to be know it all but on the inside you know they're telling the truth right and that's how and that's what Jesus meant by that if you can't believe the person at least believe the words they're saying because the words will stay with you have all you want have every issue you are against the person and how they're telling it to you because people have you know extreme personalities where they seem like they're very very pushy with their advice and things like that but if the word is from God that's what sticks on the inside and that what that's what made me realize like you know what she was like you know you don't want to be worshiping that stuff and that kind of hit me in my heart like you know what that's true I need to kind of I need to make a change here right so and that is and that is actually wisdom right that's actually wisdom that she gave me so the gifts in the church are to help people it's not to hurt you or nothing like that it's just sometimes people have different personalities and it can come across as um offensive or you know or just kind of like you all up in my business kind of a feeling but you have to kind of get past that and know that if it's a word from God now because some people got personalities and they don't got no wisdom and they just trying to be bossy they just trying to control you and you just got to you know set that aside but if it is a word from God take the word forget you know forget about the person take the word right so the next uh gift uh uh that uh the Bible talks about is knowledge right and I really couldn't find a definition for this thing because every definition that I was looking for it was like a worldly knowledge where you kind of like you go out you read you gain experiences but that's not the knowledge that God is talking about only thing that I could find that um that we'll kind of type this later is the knowledge or understanding of God and how God does things um in in a particular season and I like that definition because uh uh there's a requirement for some kind of Revelation that you get from God so knowledge is not something that you're going to do that that you're doing to go and get uh it's something that God gives you right God and uh uh God gives you this knowledge or reveals or opens the word uh to you because I did my research online and the Bible says that uh it said well not the Bible but the Genesis world record says the Bible still holds the first place for the most books ever sold uh and I believe it's like there's like five billion books um copies that are sold uh so if just reading your Bible was all that was required uh um and there was no gift of knowledge there should be a lot more people filled with the Holy Spirit but it's not we can tell uh uh based off of uh the way that the world is going right so the Gifts of knowledge in the church are individuals that God has designed and reveals the word to them they're able to look at a Bible verse and say oh wow you may look at a Bible verse and get like this much but when someone that has a gift of knowledge in the church reads a Bible verse it's way way way way more deeper right and you're able to perceive more light U from them so we just want to kind of get an example of that and we're going to turn to acts uh chapter 8 and read verses 29-31 uh and it reads here it says then the spirit said unto Phillip and I like this because this is the spirit which is Jesus Christ talking to philli telling him to go and do something right he says go near and join thyself to this Chariot and Philip ran thither to him and heard him read the prophet isias and said understandest thou what thou readest and he said how can I accept except some man should guide me so this unic didn't know right this unic didn't have any kind of knowledge of what he was reading so God then used uh Phillip who has the gift of knowledge to be able to come and help someone understand what they're reading and that is one of and that's one of the reasons why a lot of people can fall away from the message because you know you may not have the gift of knowledge you may not have the gift of wisdom and you have to depend on somebody else to reveal that to you because if you try to understand it yourself you won't be able to God didn't make you to be able to see that and then all a sudden you trick yourself up it's hard for you to believe then you fall away from the message or you just fall away completely from God because you didn't understand it but this unic had a different spirit and he said how can I accept some man should guide me so you have to be humble enough to know that I don't know everything I may not have all the knowledge I may not have all the understanding and I need someone to come and and show and break the bread Revelation so that I can understand these things right and uh that is the that is the gift of knowledge and Proverbs we're going to read Proverbs 99-1 because this kind of sums up what we've been kind of talking to like I said if you want wisdom uh uh uh Proverbs is the book to go to and Proverbs n in Proverbs 9 reads give instruction to a wise man and he will be yet wiser teach a just man and he will increase in learning right so give instruction instruction and wisdom are liken to uh together because uh uh um wisdom gives instruction for you right then it says teach a just man and he will increase in learning knowledge knowledge helps you to increase what you know and it says the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of the Holy is understanding right so that's just kind of uh to iterate off of that and then and the uh we're going to turn to the uh we're going to be closing soon but we're going to turn to the message uh question and answers 54 uh 0516 paragraph 28 through through 31 uh to kind of just show um how these gifts of wisdom and knowledge and understanding how it's something that comes from God and I just start reading while she uh pulls it up so it says we're going to read the middle of it it says this is a greater portion of the Holy Spirit and then when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost that is the completion of the Holy Ghost taking up its Abode in you to manifest gifts speaking with tongues interpretation of tongues Gifts of power wisdom knowledge understanding the man said last night said where did you get your education for these things well said I've come out of great seminars and we've never had such as that ever taught in a seminar that I ever heard I said it didn't come from Seminary I said I'm poor with a seventh grade education 10 15 years ago I couldn't hardly write my own name and I cannot do much better today but it comes through inspiration see I said then watch it um he said why he said you never watch where you're going in the Bible you just grab the thing and run all through the Bible and said it just comes uh right all together right um so this is what the prophet is because we know the prophet had a gift of knowledge and wisdom and here's the prophet solidifying that it's something that God gives you that is in the church and you could spend I mean you can spend years reading your Bible you could go to Seminary School you could uh um I know some people try to read the Bible um from the beginning to the end verse by verse by verse by verse but that does not give you knowledge and wisdom right going to someone that has knowledge and wisdom that God has gifted uh will give you those things right um now there is a difference between wisdom and knowledge and just because you have a gift of wisdom doesn't mean that you have the gift of knowledge and vice versa um and the key thing about these two things because you have to watch for watch for these things in the church which is why our foundation was it has to be God operating these things it has to be God showing you uh what to say uh and what to think uh the key things is that the key thing in this uh um this whole thing is that the gifts are given by the spirit and they should be operated by the spirit and when they operate by the spirit they're going to work together so we're going to turn to acts 191 1 through six to kind of see example of how these gifts will operate together and it reads and it came to pass that while Apollos was at Corinth Paul having passed through the upper Coast came to Ephesus and finding certain disciples he said unto them have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe and they said unto him we have not so much as heard whether there be any holy ghosts so they didn't know now they they had wisdom because they were disciples right in order for you to be a disciple you got to have wisdom because a disciple is someone that receives instruction right so they had wisdom they have some knowledge too but in this Bible verse we see that they don't know anything about the Holy Ghost right and he said unto them unto what then were you baptized and they said unto and they said unto John's baptism then said Paul John verely baptized with a baptism of repentance saying unto the people that there should believe on him which should come after him that is on Christ Jesus the B and the Bible says when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so they all they received Knowledge from Paul that they did not have right uh and this is all just to emphasize that um and this is the only two that we're going to get to today but a lot of people in the church have gifts of Faith uh people uh the Bible says there are Gifts of healing uh and it's plural Gifts of healing because some of you can sing I know Sister sh sung a song one time and somebody was healed from that uh gifts on the instrument can heal people uh a lot of you have a a Word of Faith to someone that can heal somebody you know a lot of you are prayer warriors I remember when I first became a Christian and I heard about people praying all night I was like man I'm going to go do this got in my closet and like after five minutes I was like you know what I'mma leave that to whoever can do it cuz I don't I was like man what do I say but some people just have that gift where they just know how to pray and keep praying and keep praying to break through it's a gift it's just the way God made them and we need people like that to pray for people in the church uh you know there are Gifts of prophecies you know some people will say prophetic word to you out of inspiration uh another another um something from that is the uh dreams dreams are a prophecy right Joseph had dreams and someone could have a dream about your situation right and so all these things are inside the church and they're they're in each and every every single one of us and so what we need to learn to do is to one yield ourselves to God to show us you know what purpose do we have here right cuz I could be dealing with something and if you're a dreamer and you you can have a dream to help me out I want the dream right and it just goes to show also that um you know the the streaming right I and I and there's nothing wrong with streaming right cuz you know you have a lot of people that go on the stream if you're in a situation on vacation or there's some kind of you know emergency and you have to stream there's nothing wrong with that right but we need the gifts inside of the church not watching on the stream right if I could you know if I could just wake up and just tell my arms and legs to like disconnect and go to work for me and I'm just going to sit up in bed right I mean it's not possible right God wants the full body God wants his full body God wants his gifts God wants all all all of all of all of what he designed inside you he wants that inside of the church because a lot of times you know and that's why I remember one time we was with the youth and we were all talking together and they were talking about this one girl that kind of had left the message and stuff like that and they were saying oh yeah so and so left and all this and this and that and in my heart you know I'm thinking like well no what can we do to get her back cuz what you don't know if if that's a gift to God God that means they could have an answer to your problem and while they're out there in the world God's trying to use that because you have to understand that God has gifts that God God has individuals that he can only use those individuals for a specific job so while the people in Nineveh were living in sin and all that stuff and Jonah was now backsliding right their time of Deliverance was delayed because Jonah was not in his position all right so we want to pray for the ones that are backsliding we want to pray for the ones that are lost because they may have a word for what you need right now but right now they're in a place where they're backslid and they're in a position where they can't be in the presence of the Lord in order for that gift to be released and for you to receive uh your healing or any Deliverance that you need right so we're going to end this in the uh end this in a word of prayer Lord Jesus Christ we come before you oh Lord God we thank you oh Lord God for the gifts that you've given us oh Lord God lord we know that we can't operate these gifts on our own oh Lord God and they just they just want to go wild and be used whenever they can oh Lord God but we know that you're a God of order oh Lord Jesus when you came down and you designed the garden oh Lord God you made the Sun and the Moon you made the animals you made the plants and it was all order to it Lord Jesus Christ because there's no blessing in chaos oh Lord God there's no blessing in and selfishness oh Lord Jesus Christ so Lord we want to ask you to come into our lives as we're going through this year of restoration oh Lord God and we see that you're already restoring things oh Lord God and that means ultimately you're going to restore the gifts to the church oh Lord Jesus Christ Lord we know that you're going to give us a building oh Lord Jesus Christ which is going to invite more people oh Lord God but Lord we want to make sure oh Lord God that as the people come oh Lord this isn't a place just for a a a gift party oh Lord no we want to make sure everything is operating so that people are blessed oh Lord Jesus Christ people are struggling oh Lord God people need healing in their bodies oh Lord God and you have a specific individual out there that can touch that need oh Lord God lord it may not be through the preaching oh Lord it may not it may not be a um through a prayer it may be in the song service oh Lord God it may be through a brother just calling up another brother asking how they're doing oh Lord Jesus Christ oh Lord there's so many ways that you can bring healing that you can bring comfort that you can bring Deliverance oh Lord God and we want to be available for that Lord Jesus Christ oh Lord we ask that you help us as we go through the week oh Lord God bless those that are afflicted in harm oh Lord we ask it in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen [Applause] create in me a clean heart oh God and renew a right Spirit within me create in me a clean heart oh oh God and renew our right Spirit Within [Music] Me Oh cast me not away from thy presence oh Lord take not thine Holy Spirit from me restore unto me the joy of my salvation and renew a right Spirit

uh uh uh God may want us uh that gift of wisdom he was talking about that's why you know a lot of times I'm how old am I 55 or 56 I get confused you know once you get once you gets past 50 you kind of stop counting a little bit somewhere around in there and I still seek counsel but we have young folks that refuse to seat counsel when you're making the most important decisions of your life even to this day I seek counsel I seek counsel and and I pray amen and then I wait for confirmation see cuz the Bible say out of the MTH 2 or3 let everything be established so sometime I I I I I'll go to my pastor and I and I'll get his advice and I okay I heard what the pastor say I'm praying on that thing and a guest Minister may come and hit that thing say oh thank you Lord and then you know what somebody I don't even know may not even be saved May come back come right back around and confirm that thing I say thank you Lord Jesus see he has a way of speaking to you he has a way of speaking to you where you know and he'll take away all the doubt it'll come so different it come so odd what you this ain't nobody but God so now you can go forward in that thing amen with a confidence and say this is what the lord has laid on my heart to do amen always seeking counsel always seeking see because what we want we don't want our will but we want the will of the Lord sometimes you know things are happen and and uh uh uh might lose this job thank you Lord thank you Lord it might be for a reason you know I'm always on if I'm if I'm blessed to be in a certain place on a job I'm always looking
