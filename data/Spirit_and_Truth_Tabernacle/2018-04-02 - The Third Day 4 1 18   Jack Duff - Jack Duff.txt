the Lord from being in this place no better place to be than here in the presence of the Lord a man I'm going to a man just go right into the word on the Lord thank y'all musicians appreciate you all on today a man just appreciate the Lord Jesus this wonderful Easter weekend Lord and Savior for his great sacrifice man he did their Calvary the Lord did that thing we're so grateful and then for him praise the Lord you all would just turn with me amen in your Bibles to Luke 24 so good to see everybody in the house of Lord amen that's more than Luke 24 Luke 24 and I'll just read a man first twelve verses here this scripture speaks of the resurrection and we we just want to try to talk a little bit about that on today certainly it's a common thing for people to talk about the resurrection on Easter and sometimes I'm not a traditionalist but sometimes I like to try to you know do the best I can to get into the channel a man because I know folk come to church they want to get it Easter sermon but you can never talk enough about what our Lord did a man I mean if we came every Sunday and heard that it to be an to be glorious a man so we certainly thank him for that but let's let's read here in Luke 24 it says now upon the first day of the week very early in the morning that came unto the sepulchre bringing the spices which they had prepared and certain others with them and they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre and they entered in and found not the body of the Lord Jesus that that scripture means a little bit more to me because I saw I went inside and he's not there and I'm grateful for that since they the internet and found not the body of the Lord Jesus and it came to pass as they were much perplexed thereabout behold two men stood by them in shining garments a man loved the scripture that proves that angels were men some of them were men some also had wings a cherubim Seraphim and all that but says then as they were afraid and and bowed down their faces to the earth they said unto them why seek ye the living among the dead he is not here but it's risen remember how he's speakin to you when he was yet in Galilee sing the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and the third day rise again and they remembered his words return from the sepulchre and told all these things unto the eleven and to all the rest and it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and and other women that were with them which told these things unto the Apostles and their words seemed to them as idle tales and they believed them not then arose Peter and ran unto the sepulchre and stooping down he beheld the linen linen clothes lay by themselves and departed wandering and himself at that which was come to pass the Lord a blessing to the reading of his word let's just bow and a brief word of Prayer God we are grateful for Calvary we realized that had it not been for this great event we wouldn't be where we are today so we were grateful that we have the opportunity to stop and just reflect on what occurred there and as we would just enter into the word of the Lord we pray that the Holy Spirit would just help us to Lord just to capture this the essence of this and may we God just feel your spirit thank you for every person that's come into the house of Lord maybe there are others that would continue to come in as they come got me to stall here in a very very special way but you get all the glory all the honor and all the praise we take every spirit that is against the Spirit of God underneath the control of the Holy Ghost sin Jesus name we pray man you can be seated a man in the presence of the Lord a man we want to just take for our title today the third day a man the third day praise the Lord a man if you just just join me on this journey amen most of y'all that uh that for me with Christianity and you already know what happened on the third day you already know what happened and but it's a story that we can never get enough a man it's the greatest story that has ever been told and it still impacted lives as people a man of what occurred that third day I want to start by reading out of a sermon it is the rising of the Sun a man and let's just start here as the first light was ever given and the earth was God's spoken word a man the first light that ever struck the earth was God's spoken word he said let there be light and there was light that turned darkness into light and in order to bring forth a creation of joy and life upon the earth then the Spirit of God as it moved with love and compassion at that great day the first day of the dawn of creation upon the earth the Sun rose and swept across it's raised and dried up the waters from the earth and made an atmosphere above and and for its first time it was to bring joy and life to the earth by a seed that was a great hour now we're gonna go further in this a man and when God was there at creation there in Genesis 1 they're very certain days unknown the second day of the third day a couple other days he would do something and then he would say that it was good right he make the comment you see him say it was good but I noticed as I went back and just began to read something on the sixth day when he made man I didn't see him say it was good and I wonder why God would not say on the day that man was created now there's a there's a couple reasons that you know I could I could give you a man 1 I would say to you that he didn't have to say it was good because man was made in His image right but another reason I could say that he didn't say it was good because he knew it was just getting started hallelujah there were some things get ready to happen a man and the things that were getting ready to happen are the things that created a need for a third day alright I hope y'all stay with me amen let's let's keep reading here alright and he says see here the the first the first day of the dawn of creation upon the earth the Sun rose has swept across it's raised and dried up the waters from the earth and made an atmosphere above and for its first time it was to bring joy and life to the earth by a sea that was a great hour but oh it was nothing it wasn't nothing that sunrise like the sunrise on that Easter morning this time with the Sun leaping into the skies it brought forth a greater sunrise than ever because it came greater news with this sunrise than it did with the sunrise at the beginning hallelujah and let me tell you something you haven't really experienced a sunrise until you've had the s o n arrives in your life glory to God say this sunrise brought a news that he is risen he is quicken from the dead as he promised he's risen from the dead the first time the Sun rose in Genesis it was bringing a message that there will be life upon the earth mortal life but this time when the Sun rose there was a dual Sun rising another sunrise in s o n rising it was not only s un rising it was the s o n had risen to bring eternal life to all God's promised seed that by foreknowledge he had seen laying upon the earth it says no more could the Botany life life live back there at the beginning without the S UN to bring it to life no more then today when the sons of God is upon the earth it takes the S o in light to bring them to life amen to eternal life and and that's what we're praying and hoping for that God would allow the Esso and light to shine today amen because Easter is not a tradition a man Easter goes beyond that a man Easter is something that we all should experience personally hallelujah we talked about on Friday night having your personal Calvary but I mean you also need to have your personal resurrection glory to God amen that's that's what Easter is all about he says so so when when sons of God was upon the earth that takes the S Oh in light to bring them to eternal life his chosen ones that he knew before the foundation of the world he had chosen them in himself before the foundation of world and on Easter morning then in this dirt somewhere laid our bodies at that time for we are the dust of your earth and in heaven there was a book of memory and his attributes was in was in him knowing that because this son of God raised he would also raise to life every son that was foreordained to this great time he knew it would be and what what a more glorious sunrise that was than it was at the beginning at time when it first dawn now he goes he goes on into some other statements but we'll leave it right there a man we are looking for what we grateful for the first son Amen that rose to bring mortal life unto the earth but a man it was the Easter sunrise the third day that brought amen the son of God out of the grave and that is what gives us eternal life amen that's that's the greatest life that you could ever have and we found out on where I'm Friday night a man that sons of God a man have the ability to impart that eternal life a man I trust today that somebody will receive an impartation of eternal life we we don't want to just approach this out of tradition we're trying to give you something a man something that transcends the life that you're living right now a man something that gives you hope even after you leave this life a man we want to impart eternal life and we can give it to you through the gospel the good news of the gospel can give you eternal life if you could believe it and receive it hallelujah alright let me go on to a another quote here I'm going to go to Hebrews chapter 4 praise the Lord just bear with me on today a man now he says now now watch Lord he says now watch that was the third rest now and and and what he's referring to here is that in in Hebrews chapter 4 there were three rests that were were offered that God gave the first rest was where God rested on the seventh day after he had done all his creation and everything on the seventh day the Bible say that God arrested the second rest was when he gave Israel their Ten Commandments one of the commandments was to honor the Sabbath day and to keep it holy right they were supposed to rest a man on the Sabbath day I know we don't do that anymore a man but you know it used to be time businesses was closed on on that day you know and everything but it was a we rested praise the Lord we honored that particular day but but here you know that the third rest was the rest that we would find a man in Christ all right and you know we were we were we were invited that if we were we were and we were heavy laden then we were supposed to come and bring our burdens to the Lord and say that's where we would find rest a man you can't go to the car I mean the psychiatrist and fine rest you go to complain about your problems are they talking about the problems and you find that are you two psychiatrists I've a dystonic a psychiatrist right say say say you can't find rest in another person you can only find rest you can only find rest in the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah the woman at the well was trying to find rest and she was going from man to me she could not find rest that way she can only find rest when she came in contact with the Lord Jesus Christ amen listen so uh and we're invited you know as believers to labor to enter into his rest amen the rest that only Christ can give so now as we as we read this as now watch that was that was a third rest he give the first God received it from work second Israel received it in the law third the church received it as part of God three is the number of life that's a statement I want you all to catch three is the number of life how many knows that says every time you see three it's life notice when God created the earth on the third day was life how many knows that the third day there came life on the third day of creation he also says the Trinity the Father was above the people in a pillar of fire the son was a man who talked to the people and got them ready the Holy Ghost was the third step which was the Holy Ghost God in the people life right so he says the rest of God the rest of Israel the rest of the church the Sabbath keepers so he says three is life now I wanted to just kind of focus on that a man just a little bit because maybe let me just read one more quote here out of the deity of Jesus Christ we're going to kind of get into that three just a little bit so three is life three is life it says now Jesus comes three times he came the first time to redeem his church he comes the second time to receive his church and if I could just be honest with you that's the time we live in him right now hey man it's good to look back to what happened 2,000 years ago but we also better keep our eyes on what's happening right now hey man so amen everybody celebrate Easter and they're going back 2,000 years ago but they they fail to recognize what God is doing now he came the first time to redeem a man his church right but he he comes the second time to receive his church and if I get this if he came the first time you ought to you ought to be assured that he's coming the second time right he comes the third time with his church everything in the Bible travels in Trinities threes but all in one Christ remember the first time to redeem his church the second time to receive Church the third time with this church as king and queen Amen let's just go a little further I'll stop there on that statement so we're talking three three is life 3 when we look here at this this three there were three rests eight men spoken of in the Hebrews forward we just mentioned about God rested on the seventh day Israel resting on this also I mean God resting at the time of creation on the seventh day Israel honoring the seventh day of the week a man as a Sabbath rest and Christ himself became a rest for us every weary soul had the opportunity to enter into Christ and receive rest amen another three was the coming of Christ to redeem his church to receive his church in the third time is with his church glory to God and in Jesus ministry there was three raisings of the date a man he rose gyruss his daughter he rolls the son of the widow of nain and he also brought to life Lazarus there was three raisins of the day amen also when we when we talk about our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ operates in three offices Amen father Amen God above us amen the Sun God with us amen but the Holy Ghost is God in us amen and and the other thing that that separates a man Christianity from any other religion is also done in three and that we speak up today's the death the burial and the resurrection of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen but the Prophet told us that amen Genesis kind of speaks of this and I want to just kind of read that if we can I'm going to go to Genesis 1 and verse 9 through 13 here let's just read that it says three is the number of life now let's look at this this is the third day of creation and it says this and God said let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place and let the dry land appear and it was so he says then God called the dry land earth and the gathering together the waters called he seas and God saw that it was good and God said let the earth bring forth grass now this is where life is kind of entering in the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so now what when you when you look at that the seed been in itself this was already a mat or tree right a man it's already bearing okay so so here God God says up God said let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after skon whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so and the earth brought forth grass the herb and herb yielding seed after his calm and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after Scott and God saw that it was good and the evening and the morning were the third day now here we see that life when the Prophet actually told us that life a man three is the number of life so here on the third day this is our first a man sign of life that's happening on earth now this happens before the S UN is created and before the moon is created that did not come until the fourth day hallelujah Amen I mean I won't go into all of that but the first time when God said let there be light that was the s o n light that was being created but the S you in like they're not coming to the fourth day but God had put these things in place life had begun on the third day because three is life three is life now I was looking at something here you know there was a statement that the prophet made I won't read this I'll just tell you where it is but you don't have to pull this up he says he was talking about Elizabeth a man and her giving birth to the law to John the Baptist you know and when Mary came to just just sing greetings a man to Elizabeth he went when she came Elizabeth was at a place where she had a baby a man she was pregnant with John but the baby was was not moving she thought the baby was dead and the probably made a statement saying he says now anyone knows that that's altogether out of the ordinary because two or three months and life is filled in two or three months life this felt but this had been six months with no sign of life now that baby was dead six months with no life a man and she said she was worried about it now six months there was no life hallelujah hey man I want to tell you that some of us been going a lot longer than six months with no life a man you you might be living and breathing and all those other things but you don't really start living until you know Jesus Christ right but but here it was six months and and when you and we got this you know we're talking about these three today because when you got six months you got two threes just three times two is six right three plus three is six right so you got two threes here and here here in the six months when I went when Mary approaches Elizabethton and she begins to say well you know I'm also pregnant too it's an angel came down and told me that I was gonna be her son and I should call his name Jesus now you know as soon as she spoke the word Jesus a baby that had been dead for six months received life and I wish it was the same if I could just say Jesus and see people receive life Oh hallelujah somebody right but you know you know it's the three represents three three years life three is life so you know another thing that I found as he was just kind of talking about that you know it says usually it says two or three months life is felt I say two or three months life especially let me go back and look at this a little bit a little bit deeper and I began to just kind of study that when a lady becomes pregnant you know she goes through three trimesters she goes through three trimesters in her pregnancy before she brings forth life right amen and now not only you know not only does she go through three trimesters amen but when she if it's a natural birth then she goes through three stages of labor so it's three trimesters and then three stages of labor once you get there come on somebody right see the early labor to the three centimeters dilated is the longest and the toughest phase hallelujah see maybe when he went to the cross there was the toughest phase but on the third day brother everybody's crying turn to smile the third day brought nice see in in three stages of labor if it's a natural birth early labor the three centimeters dilated is the longest in the toughest phase and then the second phase is from three centimeters to seven centimeters dilated a man that's the second phase of the stage of labor all right but the last stage a man of labor is wish it when the woman goes from seven centimeters to fully dilated a man which is a ten centimeters now I'm gonna tell you when she get there you better make sure if you want to see the baby boy you better be there then because once she hit ten centimeters things begin to change in the room I can hear somebody in the end in the mother's ears and say stop not before she get that each other now be careful don't do this because she's trying to get rid of this she trying to let this go she tried I mean am i there yet and they temp don't push now don't push because you might hurt something I don't do that just wait you got I mean the process has started it may seem a little difficult but God is working sometimes she's in that stage for hours but we suggest the fully darling if they not push now push hallelujah amen and the church is fully darling it's time to push you know I pushed me push means pray until something happens come on church push push push [Music] she's about to bring forth life and I believe that the church spiritually today is about to bring forth life we've been praying we've been waiting we've been fasting we looking for life somebody to have an encounter with Jesus Christ Oh Easter just won't be one day a year but Easter becomes your life this 3 a man we're staying with this 3 hallelujah because 3 a man is the number of life and I just kind of went through the scriptures and I found a number of threes all over the place and I couldn't bring them all so I just brought some and found out that and I don't know why it took three days for Mary and Joseph to find Jesus but for some reason he was they had long they'd gone and they left him for three days and oftentimes we leave the Lord come on we walk away and we leave him and we go through a certain time period sometimes it's three days sometimes it's three years sometimes it's three months amen but we go through maybe something happened and we go through and we leave the Lord but I'm gonna tell you if you leave them you know where to find them ain't no sense in going looking nowhere else you gonna find him right where you left him so the quicker you can get back there the quicker you can get some life you know Jesus first miracle that he ever performed was turning the water into wine and the good thing that I found here scriptures that that occurred on the third day because it said there in John 2 and 1 it says the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee and the mother of Jesus was there can we just go ahead and read that John two and one and a man let's just just this look at this hallelujah I said and the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee and and the mother of Jesus was there go on to verse 2 and both Jesus was called and his disciples to the marriage and when they wanted wine the mother jesus saith unto him they have no wine now you know evidently Mary had seen Jesus do a couple of things you know and she wouldn't just go to him like that right she will just run up to him like that if if something he Emmy he hadn't done something before I don't know what he did around the house I have no idea what this household would have been like maybe maybe maybe one day mama I mean maybe one day daddy don't have enough money to bring no no food home come on somebody and Marius may be baking the last cake and I and she like what I don't know what we don't do tomorrow Joseph I have no idea what's going to happen in this house tomorrow these kids need to eat and and Joseph we going through right now and all of a sudden Jesus say sit down mama sit down sit down sit down I mean everybody sit down we got this thing under control and they sit down and he say a prayer before you know it depletes our fool maybe maybe things like that happened in the house so she had confidence that if Jesus is that the party if Jesus is involved then everything will be all right look at it look at it see the reason things ain't no right cuz you ain't got Jesus involved yet that's why you keep struggling you ain't got Jesus involved yet when you get him involved that problem will be over he can settle it all right now come on it says he says and Jesus said unto her now now now notice the scripture Jesus a woman what have I to do with the man hours not yet come I remember said that he lost they lost him in three days and they found right where they left him well you know when they got back to him they made us marry me to come and say your father and I have been looking for you and Jesus had to correct his own mama because he Mary was not his mother she was the incubator that God selected or elected to bring forth amongst his own self but God don't have no mama God don't have no daddy God is God right so so he had he had that he had to put a stretch they say now did not you know I'd be about my father's business at 12 years old he was correcting her oh my god don't get it twisted we're gonna go through this thing but you're not who you you know who you claiming to be in front of these people now if you go back and read the scripture you see that later on here to say that he was just he was he began to be obedient you know to everything that there was acting to do and say hey that he grew in I got it I can't I can't read all this young Luke - y'all go find it in Luke - Luke 2 verse 45 and on from there y'all find it but he grew he grew in wisdom grew in knowledge grew in strength and I'm like Jesus growing yeah he should have did that's what the Bible say I'm staying here with John - ok but here here so so first four said Jesus said in her woman what have I to do with thee my towers not yet come he had to call a woman because she was not his mother right his mother says aren't unto the server now you can imagine how did that how did her how does John write this do I write that I mean I know he was but she she carried him but you know how he write his mother his mother said unto the service whatsoever he saith unto you doing and there was set there six waterpots of stone divided that you got three all right there 3 times 2 is 6 3 plus 3 6 here we go some more threes so there was set there six waterpots of stone after the manner of purifying of the Jews containing two or three firkins apiece jesus said to him the water pots with water and they filled him up to the brim and he said unto them draw out now and bearing to the governor of the feast and they bear it and when the rule of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine and knew not whence it was but the service which drew the water knew the governor of the feast called the bridegroom and said unto him every man at the beginning does set forth good drink I mean good wine and when men have well drunk then that which is worse but thou has kept the good wine until now this beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee and manifested forth his glory and his disciples believed on him so his first miracle happened on the third day where he turned water into wine and when he turned water into wine he completely bypassed the process of how wine was supposed to be developed compete completely bypassed the process hallelujah God has a way of just went when he told the disciples to me to bring the fish that they caught and he made fish on the bank he bypassed the process of catching fish scale and fish and cooking fish bypassed the process and some things in your life got gonna bypass the process to get you right where he wants you to be oh yeah he can bypass a process bless it be his holy name all that happened on the third day can we go a little further I was looking at esta 4 and 16 zester was in a situation where she was called to be the queen after Vashti had denied king hasser is some things she was denied she was rejected a sheep sheep that she denied him then she got rejected they got a new queen and Esther was that Queen and they're coming time esta got a little secure there in the kingdom she was so happy to be the new queen and Wow before she before she went in her uncle Mordecai told her now don't tell them that you Jewish don't don't don't don't say anything about it just let him go right on but there come a time where you have to reveal it and they got to a spot where they put out a word that because the more to kind of stand because more I mean they wanted to kill all the Jews because of one man Mordecai stand because he would not bow to Haman Haman come up with a law that we're gonna kill all these Jews we're gonna get rid of them all and I ain't so so Mordecai went until he got word I said not now it's time for you to step up and tell them who you are now it's time to declare you know who you are because we're gonna lose our lives if you don't go in before the king and say something right so now here and I exit I mean and and what were esther said to him right now I can't go before the king because if I go before the king and he does not bid me to come with his golden scepter then I'm gonna die so here in Esther 4:16 s just finally convinced say I got to do something for my people I got to reveal something to the king so and that's the full 16 she say go and gather all I'll gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan and fast ye for me everybody had to be involved in the fast this was what we call a global fast where everybody got involved if you wanted your life spared then you got involved in this fast go gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan and fast she for me and neither eat nor drink three days looking night or day I also and my maintance will fast likewise and so will I go in unto the king which is not according to the law if I perish I perish but all this happened after three days with three day fast now now you know I'm gonna let you go and read the rest of that you go to the next chapter you find some things that it was after three days of fasting that Esther put on her royal apparel she got her best dress and said she stood this was after the fasting right she stood and went with winning the inner court of the king's house and she knew that anybody coming into that Kings Court not being called it was a sure death but she got dressed her best she wanted to make sure the King noticed her baby recognized that now if you're gonna kill me you gonna kill me at my best you're gonna take me out you're gonna take me out of my best a man you remember this dress you bought for me right I mean I can imagine is - did that right and she she winning she did stood there gracefully right just waiting just to see what would happen but all this happened after a three-day fast hallelujah so when she stood there amen all of a sudden the king took the golden scepter and he stretched it forth towards Esther and that meant that her life would be spared and she would not die because three Ripper is for life right so so so God spared not only her life but God also spared that lock the lives of all the Jews because of that that occurred because three was the number of life in lighted by fast the Daniel fast Daniel one time was praying about something he couldn't get an answer and it took 21 days for Daniel to get his answer 21 days is how many threes seven threes right and here God would give Daniel his visitation after his fasts and and again 21 days represents seven threes guess what church we are also under expectation for a visitation and I'm expecting God to visit us today he's already started he's already started but you know what I know there's some things on this cross and some things on the cross that's been there for four years and every time God responds and answers one of those requests we take it down off the cross I'm believing that today gonna be that day glory to God hey man let me let me give you another one Joshua 1 and 11 Joshua 1 and 11 now you go back and read Joshua it's a very very powerful book a very encouraging book a man especially chapter 1 after you told Joshua Moses my servant is dead but now you got to rise up and you got to take the people into the Promised Land and say that's that's your responsibility take him into the land and then divide the land amongst him he had a greater responsibility than Moses did right but here here here Joshua a man did something amongst the people in Joshua 1:11 he says pass through the hosts it says and command the people saying prepare you vittles for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan Jordan represented a death amen you're going to pass over this Jordan to go in and to possess the land which the Lord your God give you to possess it now they were supposed to get this in three days now just line up Joshua three for me verse one don't don't pull it up yet but just line it up I just want to say this here here they are a man at a place where they have been wandering in the wilderness for forty years but here Joshua rises up a man by faith and he says within three days we're going into the place that God has promised us amen no longer wandering but we're actually getting ready to go in and possess this land that God told us that we're supposed to have forty years ago a man now here's what I want to say I believe there comes a time where the promise that God has given you has to become a manifestation it has to move from promise to being a manifestation no longer you just quoting it but now you got to live it hallelujah amen Abraham had a promise of a baby for 25 years but one day when Isaac was born it became a manifestation listen Noah had a promise that it would rain for 120 years but one day amen the promise was manifested in North life the children of Israel Warner for 40 years in the wilderness after leaving Egypt but one day the Amen God gave them the promise of entering into the promised land see the wilderness was not the promise it was simply part of the process but God promised the land flowing milk and honey and that's when Josh was stood up and said within three days this promise going to be made manifest now here in Joshua 3 verse 1 through 5 look at what happens here and if I'm not mistaken when they decided to go into the Promised Land it was the month of April if I'm not mistaken the month of April it was a really bad time because the waters were overflowing and I'm gonna tell you something you might be in a situation where problems are just overflowing situation and circumstance and all kind of things that are happening you just don't know what to do about this is the time when your promise is about to be be made manifest you've been believing God for your family receive him Joshua 3 verse 1 through 5 look at this and Joshua rose early in the morning and they removed from shittim and came to Jordan he and all the children of Israel and lodged there before they passed over and it came to pass after three days that the officers went through the hosts a man and they commanded the people saying when he see the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God and the priests the Levites bearing it then ye shall remove from your place and go after it yet there shall be space between you and it about two thousand cubits by measure come not near into it that you may know the way by which he must go for ye have not passed this way heretofore and Joshua said unto the people sanctify yourselves for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among you somebody should have said a man today I'm under expectation I mean I'm looking I'm you know see this thing moved from just being a promise right let's move to a manifestation time and and we've been holding on for certain things in church i'ma tell you if there was ever time for you to get desperate about what God promised you that time is right now that time is right now if you've been holding on for family members you ought to be pushing praying until something happens don't let go until something happens glory to God you want to change it change it on your knees glory to God hallelujah a man church did this is a time for us to receive what God has promised us I got another scripture that I want to read to you here because this is another thing about a three a man that was in the scripture and I just love how the Holy Spirit just kind of put these things they don't go into the to the promised land so after three days here Esther doesn't go before the King until after three days of fasting right I mean all these threes are just sitting there Scripture I got some more for you I got some worse it's coming but but when you start looking at this it was all speaking of Calvary that third day hallelujah amen now I want you to just kind of catch this with me don't let it go overhead I'm going to a book that you probably haven't read in a long time hosea chapter 6 and I'm gonna start reading from verse 1 and 2 hosea the reason i make the statement that this is a time where we ought to be more desperate than we've ever been because god made israel a promise and that promise is coming into manifestation now right before our very eyes and notice what he says here in hosea 6 verse 1 and 2 says come and let us return unto the Lord for he hath torn and he will heal us he has smitten and he will bind us up after two days will he revive us in the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight because the third day brings life right so in the third day Israel is going to receive life so ever since they rejected Christ and put him on the cross that gave opportunity to us Gentiles but there's a promise in scripture that in the third day they will receive life stay with me Hosea 14 and verse four through five now as we as we're getting that I want I want to just I want to I want to ask a question here to the Lord put in my heart what if this was our last Easter celebration before Jesus returned the second time what if this was the last one right and and and and if it's not the last one I need to put this in your spirit one day you will go to church for your last Easter service how are you how would you approach it if you knew this was your last Easter service oh it's too traditional it's just way too traditional but how would you approach it if you knew one day it was going to be the last then I just read to you a promise in Scripture that is turning from the Gentiles going back to the Jews well look at this in Hosea 14 verse 4 and 5 this is what he when he promises the Jews he says I will heal their backsliding I will love them freely for my angers turned away from him it says I will be as do unto Israel he shall grow as the lily and cast forth his roots as Lebanon now I'm just beginning to think about that so if this if it's possible that we could enter into our last Easter that one day we're gonna hear our final Easter sermon and I'm not talk about because you you die no living people gonna hear they last Easter sermon glory to God right and Saints because there's a rapture that's ahead of us now if he promised to heal the backsliding of Israel and we know that this is a season where he's turning amen back to the Jews we realized that that is the hour that we're living in he said now I just thought to myself before God can heal Israel's backsliding if this is the end time then God got to heal my loved ones backsliding and he promised it to Israel and I'm gonna write that same promise for my own loved ones if he's gonna heal their backslider before he calls Israel he has to call us out so I'm expecting him to heal my loved ones backslide he told me the promise is unto me my children those that are far off as many as the lord my god shall call so i'm holding them to his promise can i just read to y'all just a little bit here out of recognizing your day in its message amen and then i'll slip on down to a few more threes recognizing your day in its message it says oh how thankful how no wonder we are so grateful i feel that we're not grateful enough for the things that god is making known to us naked and the vision said showed me she was naked and didn't know it and blinded as Israel was blinded so that the Gentiles could come in now the Gentiles are blinded so the bride can be taken out and Israel can receive the Feast of the trumpets just perfectly he says after two days he will revive us or give us a revival bringing us together the Jews speaking on these trumpets now he says and we shall live in his sight or have eternal life see we'll be in his sight the Bible said here in Hosea it says we shall live in his sight life have life in his sight that's his own life eternal life have life in his sight she that lives in pleasure is dead while she lives see so we promised that Israel again would have life in his sight she's been dead to the facts and to the Pentecostal feast note now notice carefully then after two days now that didn't mean to 24-hour days coz that I said that happened way back yonder many hundreds of years ago see it meant two days with the Lord after two thousand years now you know how long it's been since that time it's been 2700 years since that cousin hosea here in BC 780 Amen 1964 see it's been something over 2700 years ago he said after two days in the third day he will revive us again and give us life in his sight there's your trumpets coming in that's the hour that we're living in the day that we're living now they have been scattered blinded gathered and far and far into the third day you see it they were scattered from Palestine throughout the world they were blinded to reject the Messiah and now they have been gathered in their homeland ready for the trumpets to recognize the atonement now when we talk about the trumpets there was a promise inscription and and and threatened alone and said the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout our came to the Trump of God the dead in Christ shall rise first now that's a scripture that pertains to the rapture but the same Trump that is calling the bride out is the same Trump that's calling Israel back watch that that shows you how close we are now we just keep reading here amen in this he says that's the Bible said no yes and the Bible said when they receive it and find him with the nail scars after the church is taken they say where did you get these scars he said in the house of my friends and and he said they would separate each family and with cry and weep for days like a family that lost their only son remember the pieces of the trumpet was to do that to weep mourn for the kill sacrifice they had rejected it Israel is going to receive that amen but before they receive it the Gentiles must get out of the way that's why I'm telling you it meant one day you gonna enter into your final and last Easter service glory to God don't don't let it be traditional a man have a relationship with the Lord Jesus because it's time to get out of here he goes on and say they're there in their land they were scattered blinded and now gather and it was all under that sixth seal there are seven trumpets sound it together them together the sixth trumpet the seventh is that great trumpet and as we had last Sunday the sixth trumpet sounded under the sixth seal amen just like our sixth seal open everything at the same time only there's all sounded at once where we've been 2,000 years in the Pentecostal feast now it goes on this is the last paragraph I want to get to you now 2,700 years since that time he said in the third day we'll be gathered again after two days in the third day we'll be gathered again and receive life in his sight see three is life right so here here they'll be gathered in the third day they'll receive life in a sight in a sight do you see the promise the hour perfectly wrote on the wall we see where we are living now in the homeland waiting for the feast of the trumpets the recognizing of the atonement and to wait for the coming to mourn for their rejection or the first time that they rejected it they're in the homeland for that waiting everything is positioned in place as a minister of the gospel I can't see one thing left but the going of the bride and the bride has to be taken away before they can recognize what's happened they were bound scatter I mean they were scattered blinded and now gathered what left the bride-to-be taken out of the way waiting for the going of the bride so the prophets of revelation 11 can call them to the Feast of Trumpets to make them to recognize what they have done this is a promised scripture that God sitteth on the init within three days on the third day he was gonna call Israel back now you all some of y'all are already aware this others may not be so let me just kind of mention it last December amen president Trump did something that no other president had done before him and a lot of them had made the promise but they never did it and and no matter you know what your feelings are regarding President Trump can I just Lord help me you know no matter what your feelings are because they you know they bring up a lot of stuff about the man and some of it is really true but no matter what your feelings are that man did something that nobody else had done that man decided he say we moving our embassy from Tel Aviv and we're gonna put it in Jerusalem because we are standing with Israel to identify Jerusalem as their capital city that was a very significant move according to Bible history that's a very significant move and we were the first country to do that right everybody else was a little afraid because they knew that there was a lot of a lot of tension there a man with the Muslims and everything else but he said I don't and he said he said it's always been that way and it always will be it's always been Jerusalem and he ain't take it back no matter what threats came the man let us stay just like he wrote it but at that significant y'all right those are significant things that are happening this year a man represents seventy years that Israel is a nation you know since they regained their their their their independence and everything this year represents seventy years that they did that all it is significant signs letting us know that we are closer to the coming of the Lord than we ever been start looking at it as a past tense event because there's another event on the horizon and that is the second coming of the Lord Jesus one day we're going to experience our last East hallelujah amen get your Easter eggs won't mean nothing in and what that got to do at East anyway who went looking for eggs when Jesus rose and and they had no things no money egg back then but now you know you got kids running around looking for the money egg come on come on church they ain't got nothing to do it no Easter no bunny rabbit nothing none of that got nothing to do with my Lord and Savior rising Amen I'm not giving Easter to a bunny I refuse can we go and look at another three Genesis 22 verse two says now take and he said now he said take now thy son not only son Isaac whom thou lovest and get them to the land of Moriah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell the earth now he was supposed to go to Moriah and for those of you that don't know Moriah happens to be Jerusalem and let's just go on a little further say Abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son and laid the wood for the burnt offering and rose up and went unto the place of which God had told him verse 4 says then o the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off I wonder why I ever ahem can see this place on the first day I wonder why Abraham couldn't see the place on the second day maybe he was getting a little discouraged that he couldn't find this place where God wanted him to go and offer his son Isaac but on the third day Abraham saw the place where far off now-now-now Jessica love brother Moriah was Jerusalem but the mountain that Abraham was trolled to on the third day was the exact mountain where Jesus Christ gave His life but Abraham found the mountain on the third day why would God allow him to find it on the third day because he knew that on the third day at that same Mountain life would change for everybody you said I won't read it all but it's in a message my Redeemer liveth brother branham said that was a fourth sight of the resurrection when Abraham saw that mountain on the third day he saw the place afar off where he was supposed to offer and when he went up there you remember the story he went up Danny offered he was offering his son Isaac beginning access dad said daddy I see the wood and Isaac is the one care in the wood Isaac is carrying the wood up the mountain said daddy I see the wood I feel the wood I feel he said but daddy where is the sacrifice and Abraham gives these great words he says the Lord will provide himself not for himself but the Lord will provide himself a sacrifice and he was even it was again speaking of the resurrection because Abraham bound Isaac there only on that altar and my he went to take that knife and and and and Isaac was willing to lay himself down on that altar right and and Abraham had the faith that if God gave me this boy he already done reason from the dead because my wife was not able to have to have have children but by by God giving me this for if he take him from it God gonna raise him up again he had that kind of faith he said took that knife of humor to come down on Isaac he heard the voice Lord call twice out of heaven Abraham Abraham stay your hand and when he stayed his hand saying I looked behind you there was a ram caught in the bush a ram is not supposed to live on the mountain like that there was no water up there for them to live offer but here the RAM that was in the bush God created the RAM and put it there notice around being a male lamb representing the Lord Jesus Christ the same mountain that Abraham offered Isaac was the same mountain and I don't notice that the RAM took Isaac's place on that mountain somebody took your place and he saw this place on the third day you see Easter is what separates Christianity from any other religion Easter is where Jesus proved what he spoke there are some things that Jesus spoke and I just want to I want to I want to just hit this if I can I want John 2:19 glory to God these are things that he promised while he was here on the earth go Rick glory and East is where is where he proved these things he spoke this out of his own mouth John 2:19 says jesus answered and said to him destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up then said the Jews for in six years was this temple in building and wilt thou rear it up in three days but he spake of the temple of his body hallelujah when he was speaking to tell him in three days I raise it up he's talking about his own body also here in mark 8 verse 31 Amen this is after he has this conversation with the disciples about who do men say I am after he had that conversation dinner he began to talk to them about his death glory to God in mark 8 31 it says and he began to teach them that the Son of man must suffer many things and be rejected of the elders and the chief priests and scribes and be killed and after three days rise again he also says this in Matthew 12 Oh glory to God verse 40 and 40 of verse 40 and 41 he says this for his Jonas or Jonah was three days and three nights in the whales belly so shall the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth the men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with his general with this generation and shall condemn it because they repented at the preaching of Jonas of Jonah and the whole are greater than Jonah is here now there was a statement that that the Prophet made again I won't take all the time to read it but he says now I'll read just making a way this is how to make it away he says it's about about that statement on Jonah it says that's the reason Jonah had the faith he did he went he had seaweeds wrapped around his neck standing in vomit in the belly of the well way down in the deep of the ocean on a stormy sea he said they're lying Vanity's but once more will I look to your holy temple God God did something he made a way of escape for Jonah what he did nobody knows that's God's own secret but no matter whether it was impossible God can alter circumstances oh I don't know what you're going through it may seem impossible to you this morning but God can alter circumstances he can make the impossible become a probable and not only probable they can make it a reality when when man take out at his word accept the provided way that God provided for the man since God did something he might have put a oxygen tent down there I don't know what he did in the belly of that whale but he kept Jonah in there for three days and nights as a type that Christ would lay without oxygen in the belly of the earth and on the third day he will come out again was a type he made a way of escape he always will I'll tell you what he kept he kept Jonah live somehow for three days in the belly of a whale and so glad that on the third day our Lord and Savior that went into that ground a man on Good Friday went into the heart of the earth and you know there was a lot of things happen why he was there you know it just didn't stop when he went into the heart of earth he actually went on down into hell and he preached to the souls that were imprisoned that dinners the Word of God a man for their day he went there and then he also went into paradise and he loosed some Saints from there I mean there was a lot happening within them three days but finally on that third day on that third day he rose from the grave and he's still alive today he is he's the one that was dead a man but he is alive forevermore he's living and he's alive forevermore no I mean this is this is this is our Lord that's why we celebrate Easter I'm so glad that I serve a risen Savior as I make my way back over here to Luke 24 you see it under you got to understand as they were as they were on their way to Emmaus you know what had happened they had they got a little discouraged we were reading there a man in the scripture and and you know they had actually heard because you know here they are the women have gone down to the tomb and they were going bearing their spices but you know when they got there they saw the stone was rolled away and as the stone was rolled away they heard the two angels speak to them and say you know hey the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified on the third day rise again they remembered his words it said it's that set now I said why are you looking for the living among the dead he's not here but he is risen so here that these women they went running back to the disciples to tell them what they had seen and the disciples had a problem receiving this the Bible said they looked at as idle tales a man it's just a story that's been told but when Peter got up and ran down there and and and told them I mean he actually saw it saw it himself he began to ponder on what had happened here what what there's somebody coming still his body weight what happened where is Jesus we're here you know they're all in a discouraged state and these two brothers one by the name of clear puss and a man and his friend they're on the way to Emmaus and they're a little discouraged because you know they had different thoughts about Jesus they were thinking that he was going to come and establish the natural kingdom here on the earth they were tired of what the Romans were doing they were looking for change and they're expecting Jesus to make the change the problem is they missed a change because he did make a change but here you know that they're dead there look concerned and they will discourage and you know and because of their discouragement discouragement leads you to do things that you normally wouldn't do right but discouragement Carles them to kind of leave where they were and they begin to head back to me and I but the good thing is as they were on the way to Emmaus the good thing they did is they begin to talk about Jesus hallelujah and if you get discouraged just begin to talk about the Lord and and what I want to also encourage him to do sometimes think about what he's already done and begin to talk about the things that he's already done because if he's already done it then he can do it again so they begin to talk about the Lord and you know and while they were talking about Jesus you know they happen to walk by a certain bush and uh and before you nor the man jumps from around the bush and he says what's all talking about and they say you know are you strange in these parts you haven't heard what happens say you know know what what's happened and in and he say they say we talk about Jesus of Nazareth he was a man I mean well approved of God and and we expected certain things from this man but we just it's hard to believe that he's dead it's hard to believe that that he lost his life to weight and he lost his life I mean this was a man that did so much he could he could heal the sick he could give the blind that there that the blinded eyes sight he can raise the dead this man I mean he did a number of things how can he die the way he died and when he died he didn't say nothing he was there in front of Pilate he had an opportunity to say somebody didn't say nothing he said we just can't we came to understand so so you know the Prophet tells us that these men were on their way back to their old denominational Church the church they got kicked out of 90 on the way back but as Jesus just began to talk to him he began to you know beginning some questions and say now oh let me pick this up here let me pick this up this is I'm in Luke 24 verse 19 hallelujah and said unto them what things and they said unto Him concerning Jesus of Nazareth which which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people and look look he says it and and and how the chief priests and our rulers delivering him to be condemned to death and have crucified Him it says but we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel and beside all this today is the the third day since these things were done now here they are on the third day talking to Jesus and not recognizing that it was Jesus and now if you go on and you reading that you'll find out that Jesus as he just begin to keep talking to him it kept talking to him he finally got to a point which it called him safe fools and slow of heart and the reason that they were fools of slow heart because they failed to believe everything the prophets had said concerning the Lord Jesus and they say he say and he just began to walk them through Scripture say now then the Bible say this and then the scripture say this and then the scriptures say that he said say but the problem was when the prophet s saying it was just too unusual it was too phenomenal it was something that they had never heard before so how could this man raised from the dead how could he I mean how could he say things like destroy this temple our razor I've never seen anybody do anything like that right he said they'd say this was all this was absolutely impossible but there they were talking to him on the third day the six-hour sermon that they heard this day and and as he was opening Scripture and just breaking you know the word and that's why I tell you I've been telling this on harping on this if you're gonna understand crashing you have to understand it from the Word of God you got to read your Bible if you want to know what he what he has done and what he is doing right now your Bible because that's where he promised it but here on the third day they're just they're just still moping alone they don't heard a six-hour sermon and Jesus just breaking scripture after Scripture down just just take it them right through everything this happened didn't that happen and then didn't they do this to him and the Bible said this and didn't they do that to Jesus and they just they just be going on amen that's the number of the truth but they finally get to the end of the day and they get to their their destination and they do something there you know and the destination say say Jesus was acting as if he's going to keep walking but they said no no no no no no don't go any further and where you all come in with us in 12 here tonight all he was waiting for was the invitation and I'm gonna tell you something a man you might be going through a lot of stuff and you're like but what Jesus is waiting for is an invitation for you to allow him to come in when you allowed him to come in he'll change your situation God can change any circumstance Oh any circumstance even if you were even if you had a if the judges pronounced the sentence on you to go go to go down for some time God can change it don't limit my God he's just waiting on the invitation and don't tell me what he can't do he can do it he can't the only thing he can't do his spell he was waiting on the invitation I mean these brothers finally invited Jesus in and they've been walking with him all day talking to him all day and when they finally invited him in there I lived on that third day of the resurrection they began to start eating and they began to break bread and they say you know man all that word you've been talking about we know you can pray why don't you pray over the meal and Jesus begin to pray over the meal and the Bible says that he broke bread and see there was nobody that could break brans the way geez broke bread see these brothers have seen the five thousand each they seen four thousand eat after Jesus broke bread right so so so just two of them he broke bread the same way he had done amongst the five thousand and amongst the four thousand and as soon as he broke bread the Bible City eyes came open no longer a man wasn't a man a discouragement but they had incidents in life something had happened to these boys that here the Sun was down it took them all day to get to the city but before you knew it they got like foot it and they took off running to go back into Jerusalem to tell them that the Lord was risen and when you come in contact with the Lord Jesus Christ and he does something for you in a no longer be a story in a no longer be a tradition but it becomes your life and you want to tell everybody that he is risen and all of that happened on the third day a lot of things happen on the third day they say sometimes three is a it's a charm and where people get that three is a charm from is because they look at these things in scripture of all these trees that happened on the third day what the Lord did on the third day on the third day so much as promised about this third day when God initiative initially established the third day and he put vegetation everything he said it was good it was the only day that he said it was good twice you know because he said it was good twice on that day you know what a Jewish tradition is that they try to get married on the third day they don't wait to weekend they want to get married on the third day so if I mean for them traditional I mean Sabbath would be Saturday for them so they looking for Sunday Monday Tuesday Tuesday a lot of weddings happen in Jerusalem or Israel because it's a third day miss that time when God said it was good twice and why would God established that way back in the beginning it was good on the third day he said it twice because he knew he would rise on the third day that's when life began on the third day and resurrection eternal life began for mankind on the third day I don't know what there you own but you better get to the third day and you better get there fast cuz we ain't got much time happy used to everybody god bless you let's have a word of Prayer father we're grateful for your living we're grateful for your your dying but we're even more grateful for your resurrection the scripture tells us that if there were no resurrection then B we would be without hope you know because of that third day because of the the grandness of it death has lost its sting the grave has lost its victory think of loved ones that have set next to us here and the church listen to the gospel we go to church with them and all grow up in church together and share together there come a time where you call a loved one's home but God the peace that we have is that our loved ones died in you and in dying in you we know that they'll rise again to the newness of life the question now belongs to us are we ready got to have our own personal calories to die to ourselves to dr. I foster dr. our ideas to die to our ways and allow you to come alive inside of us Lord my prayers today let somebody experience a true third day a resurrection where you can look upon them and say oh yes it is good the same way you did there at the beginning reminded of your prophet talking about the young lady that went to the altar once and she wanted to pray she has some things she was dealing with addictions that she was battling and she prayed and and she cried some tears and she did all of that but then she got right back up from y'all she said okay I'm ready to go and profit looked at and say oh no sister you ain't got it yet you ain't got it yet no no no that's not it you haven't you have not reached God yet and she got back on her knee that she kept praying and Lord finally something happened to her in that prayer meeting that he could he could say oh now you got it and and he knew that no matter what storms that she faced from that day forward she'd be okay God some of us need that type of experience with you we've tried to do things and it hasn't worked out but it's only because we have not come to a place of complete surrender my prayer is that somebody would take this moment this time to invite you in as clearpass and his friend did they they took time to invite you in and once you've got behind closed doors God you did something that only they could recognize Lord Jesus we know you're living we want to experience you once more we want to experience your life we want to experience your peace we want to experience your hope and you're the only one that can offer it to us so deal with our hearts card even now let it be a true Easter in every heart it's in the mighty name of Lord Jesus that we pray amen praise the Lord [Music] thank you Jesus glory to his
