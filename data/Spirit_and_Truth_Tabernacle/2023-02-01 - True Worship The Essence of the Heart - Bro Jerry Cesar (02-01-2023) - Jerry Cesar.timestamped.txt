[12:26] uh whether you do it in the evening in
[12:29] the morning just just make sure you're

[12:39] that's real real good so also remember
[12:42] the church corporate fast is going to be
[12:44] happening February 26 through March 18th
[12:48] amen the church corporate fast and like
[12:50] I said uh everybody might do something
[12:53] different we're not trying to limit what
[12:55] you do last year when I actually did the
[12:58] fast uh there were times I had to change
[13:00] my fast based on what was going on in my
[13:03] life so some days I would do uh fast
[13:06] till three o'clock you know some days it
[13:07] might be something else but I just I
[13:09] just changed it you know as as I had to
[13:12] adjust of different things so feel free
[13:14] to do that this is not bondage in any
[13:16] way this is freedom but we just want
[13:19] everybody to be involved amen that's why
[13:21] we call it a church corporate fast so
[13:23] February 26th through March 18th and I
[13:26] believe uh our giving is the same
[13:28] through cash app sale and uh if you have
[13:31] to use PayPal we discourage it because
[13:33] of the fees but uh uh uh Excel and
[13:37] PayPal the email address is giving at

[15:33] those that are watching online I greet
[15:35] you in the name of Jesus Christ
[15:38] we won't take much time we'll turn into
[15:40] our scripture
[15:42] I want you to open your Bible with me to
[15:45] the Book of John
[15:56] I'm sorry Matthew The Book of Matthew
[16:04] I was blessed by that song brother Jack
[16:06] uh I want to see him too
[16:09] and I hope that's your desire tonight
[16:12] praise the Lord
[16:14] so Matthew chapter 15 is where we want
[16:17] to go to we're going to read the first
[16:19] nine verses
[16:22] just say Amen when you're there yeah
[16:26] now it reads then came to Jesus scribes
[16:31] and Pharisees
[16:33] which were of Jerusalem
[16:36] saying why do thy disciples transgress
[16:39] the tradition of the elders
[16:41] for they wash not their hands when they
[16:43] eat bread
[16:44] but he answered and said unto them
[16:46] why do ye also transgress the
[16:49] Commandment of God by your tradition
[16:51] for God commanded saying honor thy
[16:54] father and mother
[16:56] and he curseth he that curseth father or
[16:59] mother let him die the death but ye say
[17:02] whosoever shall say to his father or his
[17:04] mother it is a gift by whatsoever thou
[17:07] mightest be profited by me
[17:10] and honor not his father or his mother
[17:12] he shall be free
[17:14] thus ye have made the Commandment of God
[17:17] of none effect by your tradition ye
[17:20] Hypocrites well did Isaiah's prophesy of
[17:24] you saying this people draweth nigh unto
[17:27] me with their mouth and honoreth me with
[17:30] their lips but their heart is far from
[17:32] me but in vain do they worship me
[17:35] teaching for the doctrines the
[17:37] Commandments of God the Commandments of
[17:40] men
[17:41] may the Lord add a blessing to his
[17:43] reading
[17:44] let us bow on the word of Prayer
[17:47] Heavenly Father
[17:50] Lord we thank you in this hour
[17:52] that you have allotted us this time
[17:55] this time that you've ordained
[17:57] predestinated that we should be here
[18:01] to hear you speak to us Lord
[18:03] father God you know every need of every
[18:06] heart that is in his place Lord
[18:08] and father we come here in an
[18:10] expectation because we know you have a
[18:13] word for us
[18:14] Lord God I pray that you would meet
[18:16] every need and that you would have your
[18:18] way that you take control of every
[18:21] spirit that is in this place and have
[18:23] your way thy Lord in the name of Jesus
[18:25] Christ we pray amen amen may have your
[18:29] seats
[18:34] again it is a privilege to be here
[18:35] before you
[18:38] I wanted to take as a title tonight true
[18:41] worship
[18:42] the essence of the heart
[18:45] now you see the Jesus was having this
[18:48] conversation with the disciples
[18:52] and the verse I want to focus on this Mo
[18:54] this afternoon
[18:56] and Jesus told them that this people
[18:59] drive nigh unto me with their mouth
[19:02] and honoreth me with their lips
[19:04] but their heart is far from me
[19:06] but in vain do they worship me teaching
[19:09] for Doctrine the Commandments of men
[19:13] now I think worship is a very essential
[19:16] part of our life
[19:18] as you see the title there the essence
[19:20] of the heart
[19:22] now if you
[19:24] if you if you look at the word essence
[19:29] it is the intrinsic nature or
[19:32] indispensable quality of something
[19:35] especially something abstract that
[19:38] determines its character
[19:40] that'll be the third slide
[19:42] now
[19:44] it's important that you realize that
[19:46] worship is the essence of the believer's
[19:49] heart in this hour
[19:52] that word is indispensable I like
[19:54] because it means absolutely necessary
[19:57] worship is absolutely necessary for the
[20:00] believer today
[20:03] now I don't want to get ahead of myself
[20:04] but I did have seven key statements I
[20:07] wanted to read
[20:09] all right I got that from my pastor
[20:13] now the first statement here says
[20:16] just take my word if you believe me burn
[20:20] every bridge of the world behind you
[20:23] the second statement says and you watch
[20:27] you follow God's direction there's only
[20:29] one key to each door that's right and no
[20:34] other key no matter how much it looks
[20:36] like God has no skeleton key just got
[20:39] one key
[20:41] God has a provided way this evening
[20:44] and no other key will work
[20:46] he is the door he is the key
[20:50] next statement says God has two laws
[20:53] the two laws one of them is disobedient
[20:56] to the word and die and the other one is
[20:59] obedience to the word and live
[21:02] if you want life this evening amen you
[21:05] must be obedient to the word
[21:07] the SEC the the next statement says it
[21:10] must not be your choice but it must be
[21:13] of his choice
[21:15] yeah
[21:15] next statement says every little jot
[21:18] everything you must be faithful in it's
[21:21] always the little fox that spoils the
[21:23] vine sometimes it's not the big things
[21:25] you do it's the little things you leave
[21:27] undone I think that's very important
[21:31] because you can do more damage by not
[21:34] doing what God has called you to do
[21:37] when you are obedient to the word of God
[21:39] you allow God to have preeminence in
[21:41] your life
[21:43] the next statement says you have you've
[21:45] got to get in that right place
[21:47] before he will receive your sacrifice
[21:51] see you've got to come into it
[21:54] then the last one says here the right
[21:56] kind of unadulterated faith in that word
[21:59] will bring that seed to its life
[22:03] praise the Lord
[22:05] I want to read something the prophet
[22:07] says here
[22:09] and a message show us the father and it
[22:11] suffice
[22:14] he says there's something in the human
[22:15] heart that calls out of for worship
[22:18] somewhere no man is on Earth without
[22:22] worship he worships something now
[22:25] worship is not all we desire there is a
[22:28] provided way of worship did you know
[22:30] that see there's a way to Worship in a
[22:33] way in a right way to worship and the
[22:35] wrong way to worship I'm not trying to
[22:37] tell you which way to worship but I'm
[22:39] telling you there is a way that you have
[22:42] to approach God and if you do not come
[22:45] that provided way you certainly cannot
[22:47] come to God
[22:49] you see there's a lot of in our society
[22:52] today we we we find that man wants to
[22:55] bend the rules men wants to find these
[22:59] different outlets and avenues to to to
[23:01] worship God right but what happens is
[23:05] God has one provided way and one of the
[23:08] definitions of that word essence that I
[23:10] I want to go back and read There is it
[23:13] says one that possesses or exhibits a
[23:16] quality in abundance as if in its
[23:19] concentrated form you see your worship
[23:22] is not to be diluted your worship is not
[23:25] to be hybrid your worships to be pure
[23:28] true according to the word of God
[23:31] and it says equality in abundance when
[23:35] you are a possessor of the word of God
[23:37] you have an abundance amen
[23:40] amen now there's a lot of things true
[23:42] worship is when we see the conversation
[23:45] Jesus was having with the the Pharisees
[23:48] we we can see that they were worshiping
[23:50] the wrong way
[23:52] right we don't have to see we don't have
[23:55] to have an intelligent mind to realize
[23:57] they were worshiping the wrong way right
[24:00] their transgression of of men made them
[24:04] to transgress the Commandment of God and
[24:07] when you're sold out for God you will
[24:09] transgress your family you will
[24:11] transgress the traditions of your own
[24:13] life you have to be sold out man now one
[24:18] thing that worship is
[24:20] if you go to the next slide or maybe the
[24:23] next two slides but true worship is
[24:26] obedient
[24:28] true worship is obedient
[24:30] now the first time that I found the word
[24:33] worship mentioned in the Bible is it was
[24:35] associated with obedience
[24:37] now worship we know is also associated
[24:40] with an offering of sacrifice
[24:43] the first time I saw the word Worship in
[24:45] the word was associated with obedience
[24:47] if we go to Genesis 22
[24:50] we find that God
[24:53] has approached Abraham after he's given
[24:56] Abraham a promise he's told Abraham this
[25:00] promise that I've given you I want you
[25:02] to go and take it and offer it as a
[25:05] sacrifice now if we can go there
[25:09] we'll read a few verses
[25:16] thank you brother
[25:18] Genesis 22
[25:21] and it reads and it came to pass after
[25:24] these things that God did tempt Abraham
[25:26] and said unto him Abraham and he said
[25:29] behold here I am
[25:31] and he said take now thy son thine only
[25:34] son Isaac whom thou love is and get thee
[25:37] into the land of Moriah and offer him
[25:39] therefore a burnt offering upon one of
[25:42] the mountains upon one of the mountains
[25:44] which I will tell thee of and Abraham
[25:46] rose up early in the morning and he
[25:49] saddled his ass and took two of his
[25:51] young men and with him and Isaac his son
[25:55] enclaved to the wood for the burnt
[25:57] offering and rolls up and went into the
[26:01] place which God had told him Abraham is
[26:04] operating in obedience
[26:06] now the next verse verse 4 then on the
[26:10] third day Abraham lifted his eyes and
[26:12] saw the place so far off
[26:14] and Abraham said unto his young man
[26:16] abide ye here with the ass and I in the
[26:20] light will go Yonder and worship and
[26:23] come again and I thought that was
[26:25] striking to me because Abraham never
[26:27] said I ain't allowed we'll go and offer
[26:30] upon offering he said I and the lad will
[26:33] go in worship Yonder see Abraham knew
[26:36] what he possessed and he knew the God he
[26:39] worshiped his his purpose in his heart
[26:43] was to go worship His purpose in his
[26:46] heart was to accomplish the purpose of
[26:48] God in his life
[26:50] now
[26:51] Abraham's obedience to the word overrode
[26:55] his son being sacrificed and I think
[26:57] that's that's very key because when
[27:00] Abraham was getting ready to slay his
[27:02] son God had a perfect Ram in the bush
[27:05] whether that Ram come from well God
[27:08] already predestinated that Ram to be
[27:11] there
[27:12] Glory true worship is obedience to the
[27:14] word amen amen now another thing that
[27:16] worship is worship is diligent
[27:20] worship is diligent if we look at the
[27:23] the story of Job we can see how God had
[27:27] such a confidence in job Joel was there
[27:30] and Satan comes and and God comes and
[27:33] confronts Satan Satan says well you have
[27:36] a hedge of protection around him that's
[27:38] why he's worshiping you that's why he's
[27:40] he's he's he's he's here with you
[27:42] but you see God knew the end and he knew
[27:46] all that was going to happen God told
[27:48] him go ahead I'll I'll loose him to you
[27:51] that's right you you can have him for a
[27:53] season
[27:54] now I like this because after all that
[27:56] Joe went through after all that job lost
[27:59] the Bible says
[28:01] in verse 20 the first chapter of job he
[28:04] says then job arose and rent his mantle
[28:08] and saved his beard and shaved his head
[28:10] and fell down upon the ground and
[28:13] worshiped and said naked came out of my
[28:16] mother's womb and naked shall I return
[28:19] and dither and the lord gave and the
[28:21] Lord has taken away blessed be the name
[28:23] of the Lord and all this Joe said not
[28:26] nor charged God foolishly
[28:30] Joel worshiped
[28:32] job had Worship in him he worshiped in
[28:37] every circumstance
[28:39] the worshiper today is diligent
[28:42] worship is diligent right
[28:44] Proverbs 13 4 says the soul of the
[28:47] Slugger desireth and hath nothing but
[28:49] the soul of the diligence shall be made
[28:51] fat
[28:53] Hebrews 11 verse 6 says but without
[28:56] faith it is impossible to please him for
[28:59] he that cometh to God must believe that
[29:01] he is that he is a rewarder of them that
[29:03] diligently seek him
[29:05] I encourage you Saints be diligent in
[29:08] the midst of such a way circumstances
[29:10] that are not favorable be diligent
[29:12] because God will provide a way of Escape
[29:17] another thing that true worship is true
[29:21] worship is present tense
[29:23] and forfeits your rights
[29:26] true worship is present tense a present
[29:29] tense worship will bring a present tense
[29:30] God on the scene every time
[29:33] now you want to you want to know
[29:36] and when you need something from God is
[29:39] when you're desperate for it
[29:41] right when a man comes before God in
[29:43] complete desperation God is obligated to
[29:46] move
[29:47] and I believe that I've experienced that
[29:50] God will move on your behalf when you
[29:53] have the right attitude God will move on
[29:56] your behalf when you are expecting God
[29:59] to move amen true worship forfeits your
[30:03] rights to his amen
[30:06] another example we can see here of true
[30:09] worship being present tense
[30:11] we go to John chapter 11 verse 20.
[30:16] and I love this story here
[30:18] because I can only imagine what it was
[30:20] like
[30:22] verse 20 it reads it says then Martha as
[30:26] soon as she heard that Jesus was coming
[30:29] went and met him but Mary sat still in
[30:32] the house
[30:33] then said Martha unto Jesus
[30:36] Lord
[30:37] if thou has been here my brother had not
[30:40] died
[30:41] but I know that even now
[30:44] whatsoever thou will ask of God God will
[30:47] give it thee you know brother Branham
[30:50] says when she made this statement
[30:53] she still didn't get in line yet
[30:56] she there was still something that she
[30:58] didn't catch yet when she made that
[31:00] statement and I thought it was
[31:02] astonishing
[31:03] because that statement paved the way
[31:06] for the supernatural
[31:09] now
[31:10] verse 23 says Jesus saith unto her thy
[31:14] brother shall rise again
[31:16] Martha said unto him I know that he will
[31:18] rise again in the resurrection at the
[31:20] last day Jesus said unto her I am the
[31:24] resurrection and the life he that
[31:26] believeth in me though he were dead yet
[31:29] shall he live and he whosoever liveth in
[31:32] me whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[31:34] shall never die believeth without this
[31:37] verse 27
[31:40] and this is where she caught the vision
[31:43] she said unto him yea Lord I believe
[31:45] that thou art the Christ the son of God
[31:48] which should come into the world and
[31:51] when she has said so she went her way
[31:53] and called Mary her sister secretly
[31:55] saying the master has come and call is
[31:58] for thee as soon as she heard that she
[32:01] was a rose quickly came unto him
[32:03] now true worship is present tense
[32:07] amen we know the story
[32:09] God Jesus Christ
[32:12] Rose Lazareth from the dead he could
[32:14] have called
[32:16] anyone by name the saying goes if he
[32:19] just said rise the whole grave would
[32:20] have Rose but he had to call Lazarus by
[32:23] name he knew Lazarus by name before the
[32:26] foundation of the Earth
[32:28] and he was able to
[32:32] he was able to respond to the need of
[32:36] that day
[32:37] now
[32:39] brother Branham says here in the message
[32:41] God's only provided place of worship he
[32:43] says now actually she had that right
[32:46] like you say about your short hair I'm
[32:48] an American citizen I can wear shorts do
[32:51] anything I want to do it's not illegal
[32:53] that's your rights but it's a sheep's
[32:55] right it's but the Sheep always forfeits
[32:58] his rights
[33:00] you if you are a lamb you ain't got
[33:03] nothing but wool he forfeits that all
[33:06] right that's his God's given rights but
[33:09] he forfeits it I have a right to join
[33:12] any denomination that's exactly right
[33:14] but you forfeit that right she forfeited
[33:18] all she had rights suing recognize the
[33:21] word of God manifested right before her
[33:24] he said I am the resurrection into life
[33:26] he that believeth in me though he were
[33:28] dead yet shall he live whosoever liveth
[33:31] in me liveth and believeth in me shall
[33:33] never die believeth thou this see there
[33:36] was one more little she hadn't come
[33:39] in line with
[33:40] yea Lord believe I believe that thou art
[33:43] the Christ the son of the Living God
[33:45] oh brother everything was ready to spark
[33:48] off then
[33:49] where have you laid him
[33:51] and you know what took place see you've
[33:55] got to get in the right place before God
[33:57] will receive your sacrifice
[34:00] you have to get in the right place
[34:02] before God will receive your sacrifice
[34:06] and I believe the atmosphere is what
[34:09] still breaks the Yoke today
[34:11] I still believe that God's anointing can
[34:15] Prevail over every situation
[34:17] now God's provided his place of worship
[34:20] is his chosen place of worship he's
[34:23] chosen a specific place and only one
[34:26] place to worship one place to put his
[34:28] name that's the only place of worship
[34:31] that has not changed now the the
[34:34] Pharisees and the in the scribes of
[34:37] those days they they try to go by their
[34:40] Traditions you see they were preaching a
[34:43] message that was out of season they were
[34:45] preaching a message that was past due
[34:48] but you know what makes it so what makes
[34:53] what we have today everything to us is
[34:57] that it's by revelation
[34:59] what makes what we have today everything
[35:01] to us is that we have the word for our
[35:04] day God has placed in us the gene seed
[35:07] to say Amen
[35:11] amen now
[35:13] as I move forward
[35:17] we go to Deuteronomy chapter 16.
[35:20] verse 2 it says Thou shalt therefore
[35:22] sacrifice the Passover unto the Lord thy
[35:25] God of the flock and the herd in the
[35:28] place which the Lord shall choose to
[35:31] place his name there
[35:33] that's where God has placed his name the
[35:37] place that he hath chosen now you can
[35:40] sacrifice in any altar you can sacrifice
[35:44] in any place in any church but God has
[35:46] chosen a specific place to put his name
[35:49] and a place to worship
[35:52] the prophet says here
[35:54] then the father put his own name which
[35:57] is Jesus in the son
[36:00] and he's the way he's the door he's the
[36:02] house he's where God chose to put his
[36:06] name God never put his name in me he
[36:09] never put hit in a church he never put
[36:11] it in a Methodist or Baptist or Catholic
[36:13] but he put it in Christ the anointed
[36:16] Emmanuel and the name is the word
[36:19] because he is the word amen what is he
[36:22] then the word interpreted is the
[36:25] manifestation of the name of God no
[36:29] wonder flesh and blood has not revealed
[36:31] this to you but my Father which is in
[36:33] heaven has revealed it to you who I am
[36:36] and Upon This Rock I'll build my place
[36:39] of worship and the gates of hell can't
[36:42] shake it down see when you are in God's
[36:44] provided place of worship
[36:47] no situation no trial is ever too big in
[36:51] the midst of your trial you can worship
[36:53] in the midst of your blessings you can
[36:55] worship
[36:57] in the midst of your ups and downs you
[36:59] can worship and I believe the true
[37:02] worshiper though the enemy may try what
[37:05] he will but God will always be pleased
[37:08] with the true worship
[37:11] brother Branham says here in paragraph
[37:12] 33 of the same message it says my action
[37:16] and the Vindication of God's word in my
[37:19] life shows whether I'm a Child of God or
[37:22] not now there's God's only place see it
[37:25] the only place that God will receive
[37:27] your sacrifice I don't know I don't care
[37:30] how sincere you are is in Christ and
[37:33] remember you say well I believe I come
[37:36] into remember the Bible says well the
[37:39] Bible whosoever believeth in Jesus
[37:40] Christ is the Son of God is saved shall
[37:43] be saved it says that but remember it
[37:47] also is written no man can call Jesus to
[37:50] Christ but by the Holy Ghost
[37:52] see you might say he is but he isn't
[37:55] until the Holy Ghost itself which gives
[37:58] life to the word proves it by
[38:00] Vindication that you are the Son of God
[38:03] that's the scripture that's the place I
[38:06] chose to put my name you shall not
[38:09] worship in any other gate but in the
[38:11] gate I put my name in then will I
[38:14] receive you unto my to my family
[38:19] God has to be
[38:23] your place of worship Christ is your
[38:28] provided place of worship the place he
[38:30] split his name
[38:32] now brother Brenham in this semester
[38:34] said the the son takes the name of the
[38:36] father
[38:37] but the bride also takes the name of the
[38:40] husband
[38:41] and you see as the Bride of Jesus Christ
[38:43] you bear the name of Jesus Christ that
[38:46] makes you the sacrifice the difference
[38:49] between your sacrifice and the
[38:51] unbeliever sacrifice is that your
[38:53] sacrifice turns into life
[38:56] you are the Living Sacrifice today you
[38:59] see our pastor been reading that present
[39:02] yourself as a as a Living Sacrifice
[39:05] daily
[39:07] Glory true worship also brings
[39:11] perfection
[39:13] true worship brings perfection
[39:16] obedience to God's word
[39:19] Christ was able to override
[39:22] all the place of sin in your life
[39:25] through obedience in God's word Christ
[39:27] had to come to a place where he fully
[39:30] surrendered where he fully obeyed what
[39:33] God's purpose was for him in his life
[39:36] now true worship I have here is God's
[39:39] desire embedded in you it's not your
[39:42] desires but it's God's desires living
[39:44] through you
[39:45] and I believe that worship is not
[39:48] something you give but something you
[39:50] live
[39:51] you live and worship every day
[39:54] you don't live and you you don't pick
[39:57] and choose when to live in worship the
[39:59] the True Believer wakes up in worship
[40:01] the True Believer goes to sleep in
[40:03] worship the True Believer closes his
[40:06] eyes and that do everything in worship
[40:08] that's true worshiper
[40:11] the true worshiper doesn't look back at
[40:13] what happened or what is going to happen
[40:16] but what is the true worship of this day
[40:21] now if we go to Hebrews chapter 10 verse
[40:24] 11.
[40:26] it says
[40:28] and every priest standard daily
[40:31] ministering and offering oftentimes the
[40:33] sacrifices which can never take away sin
[40:37] but this man after he had offered one
[40:40] sacrifice for sin after he had offered
[40:44] one sacrifices for sin forever sat down
[40:47] on the right hand of God from henceforth
[40:50] expecting till his enemies be made his
[40:53] footstool for by one offering he hath
[40:56] perfected forever them that are
[40:58] Sanctified and I think that's very
[41:00] important
[41:02] because
[41:03] God
[41:05] didn't need anything from us to make him
[41:07] better
[41:08] but we needed his sacrifice
[41:12] to make us perfect
[41:14] I was having the conversation a few
[41:16] weeks ago with
[41:18] a Jehovah's witness that came to my home
[41:20] and I was in the middle of work
[41:24] and they came they had a few questions
[41:26] they were looking to witness to me and
[41:28] and and and there was no doubt that
[41:31] there was a beautiful atmosphere
[41:34] it was me and two other young men
[41:36] and you know after well they want young
[41:39] men they're a lot older than me but it
[41:41] felt like I knew a lot more than they
[41:43] did
[41:44] but after we finish our conversation
[41:47] maybe it was almost an hour long and I
[41:50] thought I was gonna get in I thought I
[41:51] was gonna get in trouble about my job
[41:52] they're going to ask for me but
[41:54] we got into the word in such a way where
[41:58] they begin to pull and I began to just
[42:01] tell them what the word says
[42:03] the gentleman walked away he says young
[42:05] man I've never seen uh someone with as
[42:09] passionate as you are about the word
[42:11] and that says well I thank God for it
[42:14] and he says you know I've never felt
[42:17] like I had to feel different about John
[42:19] 3 16.
[42:21] that God sent his only son and he told
[42:24] me that you know that scripture still
[42:25] means everything to me today because God
[42:29] would send his only son to die for me
[42:32] and I know he believed that literally
[42:36] but I told him you know it means more to
[42:38] me
[42:39] because God didn't just send anybody but
[42:42] he came and took my place
[42:45] and I believe
[42:47] God has come and took our place today
[42:50] you see when we are in true worship we
[42:53] can identify with the same sacrifice
[42:56] God dwelling in US
[42:58] and we in him
[43:02] amen now I have here when you have so
[43:05] much of the world in your life it numbs
[43:08] your heart towards worship
[43:10] now what is it that we have to get rid
[43:13] of unpack
[43:15] like the word says
[43:17] now again when the word when the world
[43:21] is so when you're surrounded by the
[43:23] world it numbs your heart towards
[43:25] worship
[43:26] our attitude towards worship is is what
[43:29] makes the difference
[43:31] well you used to get from worshiping you
[43:33] don't get anymore but the worst but the
[43:36] more you worship the more of God he
[43:38] pours into you
[43:40] the more of God himself he pours into
[43:42] you
[43:44] now the word says
[43:47] as a man thinketh in his heart so is he
[43:50] see your heart is the nature of of of
[43:53] your worship how much of a surrendered
[43:56] heart you have towards God towards his
[43:59] word
[44:00] and in closing I have this
[44:04] the enemy
[44:08] the enemy may try to get you out of
[44:11] worship
[44:12] but he can never get true worship out of
[44:15] a real believer
[44:17] he may try to get you out of worship but
[44:20] he'll never get you worship out of you
[44:22] if you believe his word if you are
[44:25] grounded in this word then you'll
[44:28] realize you are born to Worship You Are
[44:30] Born to praise God
[44:32] and we know um I couldn't speak of
[44:34] worship without reading this verse says
[44:37] book The Hour cometh and now is when the
[44:40] true worshipers shall worship the father
[44:42] in spirit and in truth for the father
[44:45] seeketh such to worship Him
[44:48] God is a spirit and they that worship
[44:50] Him must worship Him in spirit and in
[44:53] truth
[44:54] and as I close here
[44:57] I would like to say that when Jesus was
[45:00] having this conversation
[45:02] with the with with the woman at the well
[45:05] there
[45:07] she tried to make
[45:09] worship a tradition
[45:10] he said our fathers worshiped in this
[45:13] mountain
[45:14] our fathers Worship in this mountain so
[45:17] she was following a tradition
[45:20] but Jesus by being there and and
[45:23] Discerning her heart
[45:26] she got to a place
[45:28] now we could read it together here
[45:32] now it says this is John
[45:35] 4 19 it says Jesus said unto her woman
[45:39] believe he believe me the hour cometh we
[45:42] need shall neither
[45:44] in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem
[45:47] worship the father
[45:49] ye worship ye know not what
[45:53] we know what we worship for salvation is
[45:56] of the Jews
[45:57] but the hour cometh and now is when the
[46:00] true worshiper shall worship the father
[46:02] in spirit and in truth for the father
[46:05] seeketh such to worship him God is a
[46:07] spirit and they that worship Him must
[46:10] worship Him in spirit and in truth
[46:13] the woman saith unto him I know that
[46:15] Messiah cometh which is called Christ
[46:19] when he has come he will tell us all
[46:22] things Jesus said unto her I that speak
[46:25] unto thee am he
[46:27] present tense
[46:30] Jesus Christ was revealing to her
[46:33] that true worship was present tense that
[46:37] she had to believe her the word not for
[46:40] her father's day
[46:41] not for her grandfather's day but the
[46:44] word for her day
[46:45] she had to believe the word for her day
[46:47] and by operating in true worship It
[46:51] produced something out of her that was
[46:54] uncharacteristic
[46:55] and her began to flow the Fountain of
[46:58] Life and her began to flow the desire to
[47:03] want to others uh uh tell others about
[47:06] the word
[47:07] and her with all these things it goes to
[47:10] save and as the disciples came and
[47:12] Marvel that they were that he talked to
[47:14] the woman yet no man said what seek is
[47:17] thou why talk is without with her the
[47:19] woman then left her water pot
[47:22] you forgot what she came there for
[47:24] and went her way into the City and said
[47:26] unto the man come see a man which told
[47:29] me all things that ever I did it's not
[47:32] this to Christ she went from saying that
[47:35] are are you the prophet to are you the
[47:39] Christ
[47:40] now it allowed her to be separated from
[47:44] her Traditions she went from tradition
