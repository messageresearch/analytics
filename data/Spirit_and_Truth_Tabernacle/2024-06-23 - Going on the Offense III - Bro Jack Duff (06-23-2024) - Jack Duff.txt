I need to do here uh this morning and uh let me uh first just kind of get my my bearings together uh I I want to thank the Lord you know Sister Eric and I were away for a couple weeks there traveling throughout uh Canada had backtack meetings uh over two weekends three services in each Church um and uh we started in Saskatoon then um in between the three Services we decided to go to uh Alberta which is Calgary area and uh while we were there waiting for Wednesday night service we got a chance to to slip up to um a place called Canmore which is roughly um 10 miles or so 10 15 miles from from B uh Canada and while we're there just getting a chance to it's a a complete change of scenery uh it's the Rocky Mountain mountains in Canada with snow all on top of the mountain and uh we just had a time just to relax for a couple days and you know we thank the Lord for that uh needed that because man the the uh each Church pulls differently and uh you know just trying to find the mind of God I had certain sermons that I wanted to take I say okay you we'll use this we'll use that we'll use this and uh and as I get there kind of like the Lord would change you know some of those things and uh uh but God knew what each Church needed and uh and we're grateful that he he uh spoke to the people amen and uh in his own special way so uh it was good to be there but it's even better to be back home amen so we thank the Lord for bringing us back safely and and also the meetings there in St Augustine happened this weekend and uh grateful some of the Saints was able to make it up there uh uh and uh be a part of the services representing our church so I want to thank you all uh for you know your support and also asking that we support the combined meeting on next weekend there in uh bton Beach just all the churches kind of coming together and we just ask that you please come out and support uh that service I think it'll be a real real blessing amen uh to to the Saints just just just this is what we used to do before Co and I'm just glad we get a chance to do it all over again and yes it is a sacrifice when you do things like that but I tell you what there is always a blessing in pressing amen so amen just let's let's do all we can to support the services all right I um I also wanted to uh take time this morning um brother Jerry and sister Melissa wanted to dedicate uh their baby uh to the Lord so we want to uh dedicate brother Elijah amen this morning to the Lord I just want to read um a scripture amen before we would have them come this is out of the uh Luke 18 amen verse 15 uh Luke 18 and verse1 15 praise the Lord amen the Bible says and they brought unto him also infants that he would touch them but when his disciples saw it they rebuked them but Jesus called unto him and said suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of God uh verily I say unto you so shall not receive the uh receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein and as a a church we certainly believe in dedicating uh the babies we don't baptize infants amen we we only dedicate them as the Lord Jesus did I know in some other churches they believe once a child has come been baptized and they got a automatic ticket to Heaven that that ain't that ain't but the Bible say uh these children have to come to a spot where they recognize that Christ died for their sins and uh it's the it's the parents responsibility to train them up and raise them up and introduce them to the Lord Jesus keep them in an environment amen where they can get to know Jesus uh for themselves uh brother random said in the message Paradox it says we we bring them and dedicate them any Mothers any church any Creed any color anything else we dedicate all little children to the Lord Jesus Christ amen so I'm going to ask that brother uh Jerry and sister Melissa if you would come uh at this time amen we will uh dedicate brother Elijah and I want to read uh two scriptures uh over him amen the first one is coming out of um uh Psalm 78 it's okay I'm I'm I'mma get it just one of my brothers just one but just take that stand and just raise it up for me I'd appreciate it amen um Psalm 78 verse1 says give ear uh oh my people to my law incline your ears to the words of my mouth I will open my mouth in a parable I will utter dark sayings of old uh which we have heard and known and our fathers have told us thank you uh we will not hide them we will not hide them from their children showing to the generation to come the Praises of the Lord and his strength and his wonderful works that he have done for he established a testimony in Jacob and appointed a law in Israel which he commanded our fathers that they should make them known to their children uh that the generation to come might know them even the children which should be born uh who should arise and declare them to their children that they might set their hope in God and not forget the works of God but keep his Commandments and also um Jeremiah uh 1 verse 4 and 5 uh we read this amen I believe I read this for his brother Jeremiah and I we we're going to read it for Elijah um verse four says then the word of the Lord came unto me saying before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctify thee and I ordained thee a prophet unto the Nations amen let's pray over Elijah amen just go right [Music] here the [Music] little okay [Music] praise the Lord let's just bow our heads father we come in the name of Jesus we thank you for brother Elijah lamb Cesar father the parents that you've given them this wonderful baby and father now they bring the child back to you on this day to be dedicated to you for your glory for your honor father I pray that you would bless this young man that you would keep your hands on his life Lord uh from the day of birth to the day he leaves I just trust oh God that you would watch over him and Lord whatever you might have for him God that you would use them for your glory father we ask that you would bless the family that you would Supply every need that they have God in order to raise this child father in such a way and Lord today we give him back to you as you have given him to them Lord we dedicate him for your glory in Jesus name we pray amen amen I know I don't have the touch like Mama Elijah but it's all right anyhow God bless you we'll take a picture God bless [Music] bring them in bring then from the fields of sin oh bring them in oh bring them in bring the little ones to Jesus sing it again oh bring them in oh bring oh bring the little ones to Jesus oh bring them in oh bring them in bring the little ones to Jesus [Music] praise the Lord I I saw um brother Jerry's uh kids God bless you all good to see you all Amen in service on the day also I needed to just quickly say I I do appreciate um the um the services I saw all the services you know when I'm away it's I I I make sure I go back and if I can't catch it live I go back and see uh all the services and appreciate uh brother Smiley with the year Jubilee amen that he ministered to uh the church a couple weeks ago just a wonderful wonderful thought connecting right with the the theme of restoration and uh I I and and and um uh I need to say this uh there was some things brother Smiley was saying he probably don't even realize what he was saying um and some of the things he was saying was so spot on to a situation that people would think that I talked to brother Smiley uh about it before he preached but I need to let everybody know I a didn't say nothing the brother Smiley God know how to speak to his people amen God know how to speak to this people so uh I was just sitting there looking at the service and said Lord look at this look at this look at this and uh I'm just I know God God was in that so sometime you know people when it get that close and get that direct they oh brother Jack said something brother Jack didn't say nothing brother Jack didn't say nothing God said something amen and and God was just dealing with a situation so I hope people can receive from the Lord amen as it has been uh spoken and then uh brother jingao came on last week and my this church was just fire all over the church uh dealing with uh shame amen he just uh did a wonderful job amen and preaching that sermon and and it was just good to see amen the church just rejoicing around the word and uh in between uh the services brother um uh Quinton Jr got started on a little thought regarding uh the gifts in the church and um you know from my perspect perspective I know sometime when a when a minister step into an area like that uh people get a little uncomfortable but from my perspective uh if it's in the Bible it can be preached right and uh and then the other thing is is that uh brother Quinton has just stepped right into a channel uh because as we go through this next step of the um the restoration y'all know we going to talk about the gifts yeah we got we GNA come and preach that right because the gifts are a part of the restoration Lord and mercy Jesus I just got a quote all the way from uh Durban South Africa this morning brother just sent me a quote and he said he was you know I'll I'll paraphrase it um there was a man in the Bible told uh I think they were fighting against the Syrian Army and he said you know go out and just strike the strike something like you know multiple times and um and the man went and only Struck it three times and they told him said you should have struck it more than that because you would have wiped out the Army now you're only going to have three battles against them he said but you should have struck more than that and then brother Brandon comes behind and say we need the the church ain't striking enough so we got to strike till the gifts come back we got to strike till healing comes back we got to keep striking until God moves in our midst right so I don't want to strike short I want to see everything that God promised amen manifested right here praise the Lord church so so Brothers Quinton just stepped into that and start talking about the gifts and and I just love the way the Lord is just using them um you know in that and I I mean I we had them come back on on this Wednesday night and share some more but uh we uh he he he what he done stepped into his a series you done steing into a series so you know when I see that I got to make room for him to be able to kind of get it all out amen we all got to make room we you got to recognize how God is moving it's ain't about no man no man at all this is about God manifesting himself in the midst of his people so I I just watched that and and one of the things that I appreciate you know because you know um some of the the younger brothers that are preaching we certainly put them in training we give them certain things to kind of do it this way do it that way do it this way uh watch your time all that we do all of that right and um and and I knew you know you got nine spiritual gifts so he stepped out the first time like how you going to get through all nine of them he can't he couldn't do it unless he rushed it through and if he rushed it through then the message is really not getting home right so so so he come and he just did two of them and then he stepped back and say I'll just wait and he didn't know when his next time was going to be but I'll just wait until the Lord releases me to come back and Sh so you you got you got to release next Wednesday right back give us two more right and uh and I just love the way the the way he's handling that I I like that so I mean I appreciate you know all all the brothers each one as brother Smiley say each one is made differently and and and and for me I appreciate all the differences I'm going say it like this if all of us were the same then 99% of us would not be [Music] needed so we thank God for our differences amen I appreciate the differences in all the ministers here so that was just that was just a blessing to my heart I I like seeing a church feed on the word of God amen amen praise the Lord all right musicians thank y'all I appreciate y'all so much amen amen amen yeah we going to we going to get this base piped into the system we're going to get a stand for it we going we going to be ready brother Josiah we're going to take care of you brother thank God for you God bless you amen pre appreciate appreciate uh all that the Lord is doing amen amen amen all right let's stand and just read uh a quick scripture and then uh we'll move in our thought uh for today I'm trusting that I'll be able to bring this thought to an end we've been talking about going on the offense and um and so there are some things that I had left here hanging and and trust that we'll be able to kind of bring closure uh to it uh here in Matthew 11 and uh verse um you know we we I I'll read 11 and 12 we we we talked about this last time but I I won't go too much deeper in that but um the Bible said verily I say unto you among them that are born of women there not risen a greater than John the Baptist not withstanding he that is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he and from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force amen let's pray uh father we thank you Lord Jesus for uh the ability to read the word but we trust that the Holy Ghost with now uh just help us Lord to see what it is that you're trying to say to us in this hour thank you for the saints that have gathered thank you for those that are online many Lord that are away um um for various events ask that you just be with them and strengthen them and protect them while they're away from us bring them back home safely Lord as our prayer and I trust God that you would just continue to pour out your spirit amen in our midst thank you for what you've been doing uh in these past few weeks here in the church and Lord we know that there's more where that come from and uh we just believe that you are just uh constantly elevating elevating taking us deeper and higher Lord in the things of God so uh we look forward to what you have in store even on today God it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you you can be seated praise the Lord um so we you know just we we talked briefly about this in in the scripture and this is uh to me um prophetic Insight is uh one of the greatest things that God has given us uh when you can un you know realize that the Bible itself was written by prophets uh the very first five books of the Bible written by Moses and and Moses wasn't in the Garden of Eden Moses amen uh was not back there in Abraham's day and and uh you know and and and all the various things that happened through the Book of Genesis you know Moses wasn't Moses wasn't there um you know and uh so in order for you uh to believe the Genesis account you have to look at it through a prophetic lens praise the Lord amen and um you know and and if God could show Moses these things you know like that in in in the book of of Genesis now we you know we have to follow that same pattern all the way through scripture and uh when we start looking at various things even here in the New Testament you know this this statement that is made that uh from the days I'm sorry uh verily I said to you among them that are born of women there have not risen a greater than John the Baptist right when we see that and then I brought to you a little quote the last time where prophetic Insight say said until now right there hasn't risen one greater than John the Baptist until now and not that he's greater but the ministry is the same because the ministry that introduces the first coming of Jesus Amen is the same as the ministry that introduces the second coming of Jesus and each Ministry is equally important Hallelujah right so you know and um uh you know just little things like that when you're reading the scripture prophetic Insight helps you see something more than what the average individual is reading amen so we we thank the Lord for this uh as we you know just kind of look at look at this we've been talking about this going on the offense and and there's a number of things that we'll come back into here in a second uh but my my my thought even from the very first sermon this year you know to get back in step and uh the inspiration of I will restore sayeth the Lord um you know that um we used a statement in that in that sermon that you know we felt that this was a year that we had to switch positions and we need to get from a defensive mode and go into a offensive mode amen stop we not running from the devil and he just saying boo to us now we go to offense and we say boo back to the devil yes sir we're not jumping and running from him amen but we run towards that devil amen we put pressure on the devil rather than the devil putting pressure on us and like like brother Solomon brought that scripture you know I think it's Ezekiel Isaiah is this the man that created all this fear one day we're going to realize how small this itty bitty devil is glory to God Amen and we've been you going you going to be disappointed with yourself that you let a little fell like that control you how I mean well I better not say that cuz you know but I wouldn't want some just some little little itty bitty like like Elijah controlling all my decisions you know what I mean no that don't make no sense he don't know what I know and ain't been through the things I've been through so why I'm going to let something like this control me and sometimes we don't let the devil just just Rob us of of of of blessings Rob us of things so so it's time for us to go on the offense right and and and when going on the offense I want to just make make this clear in every sport no matter what the sport is when a team is on the offense the objective is to drive right now um the the the in football we're trying to you got to get you know every 10 yards you get a new set of downs right so my objective is to drive and at least get 10 more yards every time I come out on the field every time the offense is there my objective is to go forward to get 10 more yards and eventually if I keep getting 10 yards and they haven't stopped me I'm going to score a touchdown glory to God right amen and and the higher your score then the the the better the the uh the better uh I mean it's you got a great opportunity of winning right so so it's always amen a drive even in in basketball it's it's a drive amen they they they say man don't settle for jump shots come on y'all some sometime the devil wants you shooting jump shots but no I ain't sellling for jump shots you know the the probability of me making it from the outside amen is less than if I drove the ball to the basket and shot a layup EXA right praise God and actually when you really in basketball when you want to take out some righteous indignation amen it's not with a three-pointer amen it's a drive to the basket and you and I don't know if you've ever seen when they when they when when when when when a boy get a real good dunk yes sir it I mean the dunk causes a certain uh a response it's it's a greater response than a three-pointer does hallelujah it's all about the dve amen even in in volleyball amen when they want to spike the ball amen it's all about the drive they they stand up to a certain wh make sure you can't play that the drive is [Music] important glory glory glory and and I'm a golfer now I don't play basketball as much as I used to I felt like bringing my golf clubs here just to show you by demonstration but if you ever seen a set of golf clubs if you ever seen a set of golf clubs the biggest Club in the bag it goes the furthest distance and it's the only shot that you get that you can put it on a tee raise it above the ground and actually take a swing at it you use a driver it's something something about [Music] driving I want to read a quote out of God's provided way brother Brandon preaches this right here in West Palm Beach in 1953 and he uh and he makes a a statement here and I got I actually got two quotes uh from West Palm that I want to read here as we open this up this is out of a this is a prayer that he's praying he says Lord Lord I pray that in the name of Jesus Christ my God that the Holy Ghost will drive back see it's something about the drive sir that the Holy Ghost will drive back every gloomy Spirit see see see see we when you when you're switching positions and moving from a defensive position to an offens a position you know you can tell when a person's under a gloomy Spirit everything they say is negative right everything they say they are underneath the gloomy Spirit but we're what we're praying is that the Holy Ghost my God will drive back every gloomy Spirit every doubting Spirit oh Hallelujah and may the witness of Jesus Christ which is now present to prove that he's the same yesterday today and forever Break Down The Walls of the devil of doubting see that that's defense you you when you're doubting you on defense but when you're on offense your faith has increased right Break Down The Walls of the devil of this devil of doubting ungodly spirit that would move around over here and and and make every person be healed he says oh thou devil I charge thee by the Son of God Jesus Christ of Nazareth that you turn these people loose amen come out of them every person may be praying some sitting there with arthritis the woman sitting there bow with the power of the devil that woman sitting there losing her mind by menopause every one of you are absolutely healed right now in the name of Jesus Christ if you'll accept it and rise to your feet claim your god-given Victory this is the time to shout Glory I believe that amen I'm tired of marks around the walls but this is the time to shout and the walls of Jericho as it was the enemy that's keeping you out will fall to the ground and every Power of the devil will be broken in Jesus Christ name amen I say Amen to that here's another one out of the message the resurrection brother Brandon preaches it in um uh uh in West Palm Beach it says this amen and in the name of Jesus Christ the son of God May the Holy Ghost drive back every Power of the devil and may each person be filled with God's presence in Jesus Christ's name I like these words where he's saying using using drive because that's where we're that's where we're moving May the devil be driven back and you know what it's going to take the word to drive the devil back amen amen all right here's another one in the message identification now I want to just kind of thank you my brother uh I want you to just kind of see something here um as we as I read this quote you know brother brandom is again is in a prayer line and uh my my my my my my he's going to make a statement here that just blessed my heart and and and and and I just feel again when we're moving into offensive uh thought process amen then we step into the same type of authority let me read it for you let me read it here we go in the message identification it says this here is a lady just as I said that it says it Disturbed her she is sitting right back here she is suffering with ar arthritis her name is Miss Thomasson now I know I'm just reading that I know I'm just reading that and it's very common to you um for you know us to read these quotes and just just nothing but I need you to understand that a prophet is going into a City tulir California he lives in uh Jeffersonville Indiana but he goes here to a meeting and and God begins to show him not only what the lady is suffering with but he also gives this lady this is your name right this this is your your name is this right I mean um anybody that think they can get before the people and do that be our Be Our Guest right I mean this is truly a prophetic Ministry could go anywhere in the world and the Holy Ghost would show him the names of the people and their conditions see we not just following a message just to be following God Vindicated this message amen amen oh my look at it it says uh your name is Miss Thomasson she won't know yes I'm a stranger to you I never seen you in my life but that's who you are my God it says do you believe me to be a servant lady do you believe what I said is true and comes from God you are suffering with arthritis that's your husband sitting there by you he is suffering too he he has something wrong in his veins it's called heart of the artery so done told the lady what her problem is told her what her name is told her who her husband was right and then say what the husband's issues is right so so he go he says a hearten of the artist that's right he has something wrong with his feet also my God people here ain't never seen me for only the Holy Ghost could do things like this so you got some something wrong with his feet also that is right and and then you're trying to quit drinking Lord my God you won't you want to do it you're an alcoholic but you're trying to quit drinking do you believe me to be his servant now he notices that the person is trying to quit drinking it says will you accept me as God's servant Hallelujah then hello I deliver you from that Jesus hallelujah hallelujah now you talk about going on the off the prophet notices that this person is struggling in this area they're trying to do the best they can but they can't come to it and he says then I deliver you from that in the name of Jesus Christ now no no I'm I'm just here to say if the prophet could go on offense like this come on the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word now now I don't know about you if you want to allow to devil just to keep running rough shard in your family's life you can do that but you can also rise up and go in office and tell them then I deliver you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that power lies in the bride yes sir amen we're not the prophet not coming back to demonstrate that that is inside of us right now but we got to recognize what is what is what is inside of us let me let me just finish reading this I'm going to just say something says do you believe sir give your heart to Christ see the ministers uh see the ministers about baptism and the thing is over for you just believe that's it you know recently um my daughter was sharing a testimony with me and uh I'm going to read a scripture you know just to kind of help you on that in in a second but my daughter sharing a testimony with me she said um she was at work and her her boss was just coming in he was just just all out of sorts there's all out of sorts and and and um you know usually when they get out of sorts like this they just you know just avoid this guy get out of his way just just leave him alone just you know whatever but but she just kind of sat there and and then the Lord revealed something to her and uh as she got quiet before the L Lord showed her say you know what he's out of sorts because he don't have any customers he got customers in the in the in the office but uh he needs specific customers for his type his his side of the business and he don't have any so he's a little frustrated he's worried and he don't know how this how these things going to happen so she so she said um she said the Holy Spirit uh just begin to minister that to her and and when when the Holy Ghost said that to her you know there was another thought that came amen and now if y'all if y'all message Believers y'all already know what the next thought was huh that's the thought and that's the thought came to her you can give him customers because brother bradam said if your brother needed rain y'all y'all must have forgot that quote if your brother needed rain you could give your brother rain so I give you customers that's going on the offense right that is not just sitting back and just letting the devil just run rough if this man don't get business then it's going to shut down his business it's going to impact my paycheck so I I realize what your need is and without you even asking I give it to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen and maybe one day when he see all the customers overflowing in the office he'll be what happened here right there's a daughter of God working here actually two daughters of God working here right but but but but but but we got to recognize we we have the ability oh church I I hope this ain't going over our heads but we have the ability to change circumstances and situations and we do that with what comes out of our mouth that's why we got to drive back a gloomy [Music] Spirit Hallelujah so if you have a problem with uh that let's read John 20 verse 22- 23 amen John 20 through uh uh uh verse 22 and 23 look here it says and when he had said this he breathe on them and saith unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost and then the next verse says whosoever sends ye remit they are remitted unto them and whoever whosoever sins ye retain they are retained so a Son of God got a lot of power a daughter of God got a lot of power but it's untapped yes sir come on but we getting ready to step into this by going on the offense we stepping into everything God got for us amen all right let me uh move forward here this this this scripture back in Matthew 11:12 from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffered violence and the violence taken by force I mentioned to you the theologians amen are not in harmony uh on the definition of that scripture they they just there theologians are just really really uh uh they're all over the place with with what they think it means and um you know I looked at it from the Greek Lexicon because you know the the first the kingdom of heaven suffered violence and then it say the violence the violent take it by force it kind of seem a little uh confusing but when you look at it from the Greek uh lexicon the suffering violence is amen it's is to inflict force on to apply Force I mean you you think about uh John the Baptist they appli by force amen they they call um I mean the the the the the daughter-in-law I'm I'm sorry the the stepdaughter comes and dance before Herod and uh he offers half of his kingdom and and then the man had his head taken from him but now he had to go through that because John made a statement before he went through he says I must decrease so that he can increase so John had to go off the scene Hallelujah there's some things that have to happen y'all understand we we can't complain about everything some things have to happen glory to God so so rather than complaining sometimes we need to just start thanking God for what's happening and he gives you strength to endure whatever it is that you're facing that's the truth brother amen right but but they use Force they they apply Force to inflict violence on that's that's what suffering violence is and and also um when it say the violent take it by force that means the strong uhuh oh my God Amen the the forceful the strong amen we going to take it by force we we going to endure this thing we not going to give up we not going to quit we going to break through in this right the the the the strong they take it by force now I also brought to you the emphatic diaglot of that uh that same scripture says in from the days of John the immersive till now the Kingdom of Heaven has been forcibly aell and the violence seiz it and when that that word forcibly aell means that it's been strongly criticized the Kingdom of Heaven has been strongly criticized we are going through that right now strongly criticized this message that we believe is strongly criticized but it's going to take some strong folk it's going it's going to take some I mean some and and I'm going just put this way it's going to take people with a revelation to be able to stand against everything that they're they're trying to inflict upon us and and and I I I I came to this conclusion about Revelation either you have it or you don't thank God for that we got it thank God we got it here you know I was meditating on this scripture even though the theologians can't seem to agree on what it means I start meditating and I was looking amen at a couple examples of people who suffered violence or opposition but they fought back they took it by force act 4 let's look at this Acts 4: 29 through 31 amen acts 4: 29-31 it says this now the disciples are are going through amen a tremendous trial man they been they they just being uh attacked because of their their their they standing with Christianity standing with Christ and and here you know they they are they've been told Don't Preach no more in the name of Jesus now you know we we really in the same spot today you you can't pray in public in the name of Jesus I mean they they let you say father Son and Holy Ghost but as soon as you put Jesus on it they got a problem with that I mean there's an attack on the name of Jesus we got to fight to hold to the name of Jesus because there's power in the name of Jesus right Deliverance is in the name of Jesus but but but here you know they're they're being attacked because they're preaching in the name of the Lord and it says and now Lord behold their threatenings and Grant unto thy servants that with all bonness my God my God my God we want to be strong in this hour that that with all boldness they may speak Thy word glory to God by stretching forth thine hand to heal and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy Child Jesus the Bible say and when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and they spake the word of God with boldness amen they were they were the Violent were taking it by force glory to God doing everything in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen here we find amen also in scripture glory to God I want to just bring a couple uh examples in but when when when you know the violent taking them by force was strong they they they have to you know they have to stand up amen they got to be strong and and and the way that they're attacking this thing they they my God they got to be forceful strong amen I thought about David amen and and David was uh constantly under attack Hallelujah not only under attack there was a a scripture that we read and amen I I don't have it in front of me right here but uh I think it might be 1st Samuel 22 U there's a scripture that I read but but but there was um the the Bible makes a statement that uh God had brought David rest with his enemies and with Saul now now now now and and I don't have it in front of me if it if it if you see that in 1 Samuel 221 just just throw it up there for me but uh but it said that um that that God had given him victory over all his enemies and with Saul and I like that because the the Lord just kind of you know me and my wife got the talking about it after I had read it you know there in Canada and uh what what happened was that um when the scriptures say and with Saul that means Saul was not David's enemy Glory no no no his enemies were the Philistines but Saul was his brother that's right brother glory to God but but but here's the thing is that sometimes we go through trials within the church and sometimes those trials are greater but we got to understand that when we're going through a trial in the church that our brother and our sister is not our enemy glory glory glory glory amen no no our enemy is the devil but these are our brothers and sisters and it's okay that we might amen we might differ sometimes we might disagree sometimes but we're not enemies one to another don't ever let the devil make you think that one of your brothers your own brother your own sister that's not your enemy amen amen amen W amen no don't let the devil get you to think something like that am right amen but but but but God had given him Victory and and David you know many times went through various things but uh I remember one time where David was uh was just waiting in a particular battle and God told him say now don't go up in this battle you know don't don't don't go up I want you to wait until you hear the rustle in the malbear tree before you move forward in the battle and and sometimes you got to learn how to just wait on the Lord but once David heard the rustle and the mberry tree it was no longer defense mode now it was offense amen somebody going to hear a Russell in the mberry tree amen you going to hear God moving that means god already went before you no longer do you have to set on defense it's time to move in an offensive position yes amen when they when when when when when Caleb was there and you know they going through the Wilderness and they've been wandering that Wilderness for multiple years and uh finally they get to a spot amen where Cale said you know I'm I'm tired of just going from Mountain to Mountain and and doing this no no no no no I Moses made me a promise Oh Glory Glory Glory Moses made me a promise and that promise is not come Amen to pass yet so since it hasn't come to pass yet I I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm laying claims on what God has promised me he say today give me this mountain I'm not taking another Mountain I I want Mount heam that's what Moses promised me he say I'm going up I don't care how many Devils up on top of is to try to stop me how many Giants up there if God made me a promise through the mouth of Moses then I'm going to take this mountain and Mo and Kaleb moved from a position of Defense amen into a position of offense when he said give me this mountain amen Joshua spoke amen uh to the son in Joshua chapter 10 that was a offensive move now I want to I want I want you to understand something an offensive move happens when you open up your mouth and begin to speak yes sir amen yes sir you know a Son of God and a daughter of God Amen has that type of power in them where they can speak and their words are B acted by almighty God Heaven backs up what you say glory to God so Joshua spoke to the son in Amen in Joshua chapter 10 and and and I like to say this was an offense of move to open your mouth and speak as always an offensive move glory to God Moses spoke and God honored it the prophet spoke to a storm and God honored it right amen he was in a defensive position when brother Brandon was running from the Colorado Storm Hallelujah he's running trying to find safety and he said I you know I I got to get out of here before I get stuck up here and he's running and then the holy spirit said no turn around and go back into the storm now now now now now now when he does that he's moving from a defensive position and now moving into offensive position by walking back into the storm don't know why he going by going by faith and then hear the spirit of the Lord tell them say now speak to this storm oh Hallelujah can I can I just mention this if the prophet can speak to one on you you you all you I mean the the there's been a great storm in your life for for years but now it's time for you to speak to that storm yes sir ohoo I Feel Jesus in here amen I'm speaking to my situation I'm speaking to my circumstance I'm speaking it by faith amen I'm going in an offensive position and I'm going to watch God do what God say he going to do amen God honored it when brother Brandon spoke to the storm he was in a defensive position as he ran from the storm but he moved into an offens offensive position when he spoke to the storm in the Battle of I I want to just kind of bring this this is found in Joshua 7 and and Joshua 8 there is a um um I I I I I I want to just kind of take my time on this one just a little bit in the Battle of I and and and I call it I uh but it's AI is a is a spell spelling of it AI but I I just pronounce it as I now Josh was told by God that they no man would be able to stand before them in battle I mean no matter who what battle they went brother brandom say they they didn't even need a Red Cross because God was with them right and they were not supposed to lose any anybody in in uh in battle as they went out to fight I now the children of Israel went up and they searched out the land and say you know it's really not that many inhabitants and I just give us 3,000 men we'll go up here and wipe this out now it's it's something about how they got a lot of confidence or even overconfident when they came up against I oh my now you know uh because I I don't think it's by chance that we also have a a new battle today with I AI we got a battle with artificial intelligence oh hallelujah amen there there there's a spirit here and you know and and what what uh you know the children of Israel you know they got overconfident when they come against IE now now I want to say I think people today may be getting a little overconfident you know let me just kind of talk about this just for a little bit right you know but but but uh you know yesterday while I was up there in uh St Augustine and and and and coming back home there was a sister first first brother brother Brooks that made a statement that he was preparing a sermon on this on this AI he he like Lord just give me something on this AI because I know there's something here it why would it be in the Bible as Ai and then today it's a major technology you know uh and I'mma just try to I'mma say this in in in in a in a balanced way if I can AI is here to stay true there's nothing you can do to stop it that's right if you got a phone you dealing with AI when you pick up your phone and say Hey Google yeah here here's the problem with it when you say hey Google and and Google gives you an answer you take whatever Google say as the answer now when it come to spiritual things you can't trust AI you guys to still go back to your Bible and pick up your Bible to see what the Bible says not what Google says Hey Alexa all of that is AI and and here's the other thing that I I come to real realiz about this is that I can just be having a basic conversation in my house I mean I'm just talking about just random things in my house and when I pick up my phone my phone trying to give me [Music] data did you have a question about this are you thinking about this I mean how does this phone know what what else are they listening to hello I mean they say that this is an invasion of privacy what else are they listening to when when your phone can operate like that and then you get your whole house operating you I mean we got hey turn on my lights and hey do this and hey I mean it's just doing everything hey crank my car come on AI glory to God driving the car for you and and then they got all them Teslas out there praise God Amen I think they they got frozen or something like that the techn was all messed up cars everywhere just just just I mean my can't go nowhere we get to dependent on this we get to really dependent on it the sister was telling me after brother brother um uh uh Isaiah made the the comment there you know he said Lord I'm looking for a sermon on this because I know there's something here for for this this technology to be here and then we see this in the Bible as well there's something here and he said he said he said Lord so so just say uh you know I was I I'll never forget their name cuz they got a little grandson and uh I say I said I said your name uh Preston said no no no my name is person and the grandson come to me says I'm a person too I said I got you now brother no problem brother and sister person I I remember that from now on but they were telling me she say she works in the school system and she has to do detention and uh they have to write down why some of the kids are coming into detention and um and and they come to find out that kids are in the school taking tests through AI which basically means they cheating come on now you know back in the day if you had uh you know you had a very smart friend especially in college what they would do is get their friend to go to the class to take the test for them and and and and now a professor going to know that ain't you there taking that test oh Hallelujah can I I mean can I tell on myself back in my day we didn't have this AI stuff but but back in my day I remember there was a project that they needed in class and I did not want to do the project it was it was putting this together and putting that together I don't want to do none of that so you know it just so happened that there was a uh a project that a kid did and they they had got a raid on it and then threw it in the trash I said well look at this what a blessing I'm being set up by the devil so I went into the garbage got the project got the garbage went to class and turned it in like boy this a go ahead and get a grade on this the teacher went all through the grade and then called my house and say uh you know to talk to said said Jack submitt this project but it wasn't his and told my parents and they said Jack you did this um somebody had threw it away and and I I I submitted it and uh so the teacher teacher said uh teacher said you want to know how I know it's not Jack because I'm the one graded it and I put the grade on the bottom of it he didn't see that he thought it was on the top but it was on the bottom and and he didn't realize I already graded this this this is not his work I'm busted nothing I can do see look let me just tell you something whether I whether it was cheating back in my day it was wrong amen and for the young people trying to use AI for a test today that is wrong praise the Lord amen uh it should not replace your you trying to learn and what they trying to teach you so that you can learn right don't let AI do that but but but people using this AI Tech technology for a lot of wrong things and and like I say it's here to stay it's not going to change I don't mind asking Google for directions sometimes I get lost out there sometimes Google don't even know where they going it's the truth in high you you better know the roads yourself the GPS will drop you off in the middle of a field somewhere man we was there in Canada and I'm like uh I don't see no no buildings nowhere around it's just a big corn field say brother you say the church out here in the GPS done LED you to a a bridge that's broken and I'm like hey hey hey no glory to God but but you can't trust it like that you it's going to take the Holy Ghost to be able to lead you if you always constantly going to Ai and never going to God you'll never be led by the spirit we got to watch this sir sometime it's so easy here here here here you know when the children of Israel were facing Ai and say oh this ain't nothing you know we we only got ain't that many people there they got overconfident and they went out to face and then here in this battle where they was overconfident they lost 36 men now now when they lost these 36 men uh I want us to just kind of get something here brother Brandon makes a statement oh my my my my I want to read this from the message adoption part one brother Brandon makes a statement when they they lost these 36 men they didn't have to they didn't have to and and church there are certain things that that we done lost but we don't have to lose it I'm going just say that again it's certain things we done lost but we didn't have to lose it sometimes it's the way that we handle situations it was a way that we we we you know I would just say just a lack of wisdom it's the truth in high amen a lack of maturity amen we lost some situation there's certain people that don't go to church no more because of the way that we handled it oh y'all ain't going to say Amen but it's the truth in the high people people out there just wandering in darkness it's it's all because of us until we willing to die to ourselves let I'm going just put it this until you willing to die to I uhhuh praise God you won't see a resurrection of those things amen but I has to die I'mma say it again I I I has to die glory to God amen amen we it let me let me also put it this way we got too much I in stuff right it's not about you sir it's about Christ right but but it's too much I I I I I we got to get rid of that come on right amen I mean even in this day we got the iPhone iPad I I I I I it's all about I but I has to die yes sir amen look at this now watch this brother brandom says why did they die why why did why did Joshua Le lose these 36 men why did they die innocent men he says because one man stepped out of the line this is why we got to get back in Step what because one man one man and you know if you ever read the scripture in this in in in Joshua 78 you'll see that the scripture says that Israel partook of the cursed things not Israel it was one man in Israel that did that now now now the problem is is that that one man doing it he actually identified the whole group oh Lord Jesus your your actions your reactions your your behavior your misbehavior it affects all of us I want to make that very clear right I mean uh you you you your your mis whatever you decide I'mma just do this no no no that affect all of us you go out there and you steal something you get caught and now you all over the news that affect they want to know what church you go to you done lost your temper you done kill somebody they want to know what church you go to right that affect all of us and now they got me on the news that do they go to your church H see you got to get control of yourself the the the the words you allow to come out of your mouth they that affect all of us it affect your family yes sir right any decision that you make that affect all of us sir we we connected amen praise God right so so we got to understand that though we can't just go out there this just my life no it's not it's all of our life sir man we we we we we like siese twins we connected everything we do you just can't go out there and do whatever you want to do sir you you impact me praise the Lord because one man stepped out of the line you see the reason this needs to be taught this church lining up lining up with the word of God lining up with God lining up with each [Music] other right we got to line up with each other amen walking perfectly upright soberly before all man fearing God because one man stole a garment and done something that he should not done it took the life of 16 men now we know the scripture said 36 men amen I think it was 16 maybe more and he's right it was 36 amen don't don't get hung up on the message because he misquoted amen he said I think it could be more yeah you're right it's 36 that's the Bible he said I believe it was 16 men that was dead it says Joshua called said there's something wrong God made the promise and something's wrong when we bring the sick up before us and they fail to be healed we need to call a solemn fast calling assembly something's wrong somewhere God made the promise God's got to stick to the promise and he will do it so here once they you know they they went through and they start going tribe by tribe and house by house and they found out that achen had stolen amen this this Babylonian garment as well as amen this gold wedge he was not they were not supposed to take anything Amen in that first battle but achen had stole these things hid it in his tent and thought that nobody would ever notice it but God knew he was hiding that sir Babylonian garment that's some worldly garment what event what event praise God you think he could come to the banquet with a Babylonian garment hello somebody and people not know where he got it from right brother what is that you wearing sister what is that you wearing what is that you got on sis where you get that from hello somebody glory to God that don't look like nothing a Christian would wear and I don't know where all all of a sudden I I mean we don't redefine what Holiness look like no that ain't holy sis cut up to here and cut up to there no praise the Lord that's too tight come on somebody brother that's too tight no what you in here with a muscle shirt on for bro that ain't nothing that a Christian would wear am man sis cover up your arms hallelujah amen all these things and and and no no no no like like brother uh uh Reggie say don't be showing your twins is the truth any High you going to need to put another piece up there that's too low am hello somebody Babylonian garments as Christians we don't dress like that but here you know they they they say say now where achan what's going what's going on here well I I did take a gold wedge which mean he stole the tithe that's actually what that meant he stole the tithe if you go back and look at the scripture uh God said don't take anything but actually on the next battle God said y'all can have everything but the tithe was the first thing that belonged to God he stole the [Music] tithe all right amen amen amen hallelujah I mean his name just re pain aching aching Joshua called the fast until they discovered the problem they could stand before the enemies until they took away the cursed things and aching when he finally confessed uh his family even got stoned to death that's that's the sad part your sin can impact others in your family here they finally come up with a uh uh they're in defense mode and when they when they finally you know in defense mode they done lost 36 men so they running for their life they don't even know what to do and this supposed to been a group that they should have took out easily now now they running for their life and but when God finally had you know he told Joshua get up stop praying ain't no sense of you praying to me aan did this you find out what need to be done and you get rid of that sin out of the camp and they got rid of aen and his family and now God gives them a new strategy and they go out to battle glory to God and when they go to battle against I uh God said now y'all going to go out like y'all normally did the first time and then here come the Army come rushing down out of eye to come after them to to attack say oh we going to get them again they ran from us the first time we going to have them on the run again but Joshua had set an ambush that once they leave amen I I want y'all to go in and set the place on fire glory to God and uh and when y'all set the place on fire we'll see all the smoke and everything and and and then y'all come out of the city and we'll have this group surrounded glory to God so a uh Joshua said now the sign going to be when I point back the spear and they took off running and like they did the first time went up the eye they took off running and the Ambush was sitting there waiting on the sign and when they got the sign Joshua turned and pointed the spear glory to God say the fire start falling all over the place they set the whole city on fire and then they come out of there rushing and they have everybody in eye surrounded brother I tell you what it's time to set up a strategy we got to get rid of I amen and and here's the thing we got to go on the offense even against our own selves all right let me uh I want to I want to bring another little quote here amen uh this is going to come out of the message persevering brother uh and and I'm I'mma set this up because uh brother brandom tells us a little story about David and Goliath and I happened to be listening to this tape this week when I heard I said man I got to I got to inject this um David before he faced Goliath David had already fought a bear and he already fought a lion and look David was not on the defense when that bear came in and took one of his his his father's sheep David got up and went after that bear yes sir I mean the the the the bear already had the Sheep In His Hands and David didn't care nothing about that bear having a sheep and I'm coming to get the Sheep the the lion got it in the jaw I don't care nothing about you having it in the jaw I'm coming to get my daddy's sheep and David went after went after the bear and after the lion and got it back David went from a defensive position to an offensive position see I'm going tell you something what the devil got it got to mean more to you than it means to the devil I'mma say that again what the devil got got and he's taken from you got to mean more to you than it means to the devil if it means more to you then you'll go get it amen my child mean m to me my grandchildren mean Mor I'm coming after the devil to get what belong to me here in the message perseverance brother Brandon makes a statement here and it says um one day a bear came in and got one of his sheep and the Sheep meant a lot to him the Sheep meant a lot to him because he had learned to love that sheep and he loved it and so when the bear come in and got one David's heart began to burn when he heard that little sheep cry my God and God had sent him to watch those sheep and so when the bear caught the little lamb and it started crying David all at once remembered that the that the god that made the mountain was his God so he puts a rock in his little slingshot and went after this big Grizzly and it struck the grizzly and down he went now I'm going tell you something I don't know too many Grizzlies that GNA fall because a man hit it with a rock all I can tell you is there Rock their rock is not like our rock this was a different type of rock that David was throwing it says uh and a little slingshot went after the big Grizzly and it struck the grizzly and down he went then when he come back he was happy because he won the victory it says and then a bigger trial come in a lion Which is far more Fierce than the bear would be and he is more gang and and if I had time brother R say if I had time I'd like to break those animals down and show you the great Parable in there I say I wish the prophet would have had time I break those animals down and show you the great Parable in there and the lion come in and grab one and run off so if God could give him victory over the bear he could sure give him victory over the lion look at this one now watch this oh if God who can give me victory over myself it's time for I to die if God can give me victory over myself oh we ain't Lord we need we need to work right there you need to get victory over you exactly right you can tell when a person ain't got victory over their self they constantly making excuses as to why this and why that no no no no no no no you got to be able to own some things the reason this happen because of me like they used to sing the song it's me it's me it's me oh lord it's not it's not my brother not my sister it's me I I need to die and sometime God allows to go through things to try to show us what's really inside of us amen y'all ain't going to talk but I I'mma talk anyway man there's a level of arrogance oh my that's inside of us that can't nobody get out but God we arrogant Hallelujah now and and and you know one of the big problems that I had when I was coming up my mama had to work work work work keep working keep working keep working and people still tell me I still got the problem today I'mma just be honest I'm be open and honest my mama said my mama said you just want to apologize for nothing this happened that happened I uh ain't me they should have did this and they should have did that a ain't me it's them arrogance and brother bradam actually told us now he said don't ever let an arrogant Spirit come on you we got to be quicker to apologize about things look I'm sorry even if I didn't do wrong I I if if if if you felt I did wrong if you felt if you if I made you feel a certain I want to apologize and when you giv apology you can't put butts on the end of it I'm sorry but if you a if you wouldn't have done that it would have never happened like no you that that's not an apology oh I'm preaching here today I know I am you you can't apologize like that not not you know brother I made you feel a certain way I'm sorry sorry sister I made you feel a certain way I'm sorry and I I pray that God would show me that how to conduct myself so I never make you feel that way again you my brother you my sister you my husband you my wife you my children that's right yes sir amen see dying to yourself is not easy that's right amen amen amen but the Bible say except the cornal wheat go in the ground and die you know what happened if it don't die y'all know the Bible it abides alone but if it can go on the ground and die not just die y'all know y know y'all it's got to rot when it rots say now it can bring forth more fruit amen yes sir but first we got to be willing to die got to be willing to apologize got to be willing to say I'm sorry got to be got to be willing to say I was wrong it's always two sides to a story sir actually I heard it's three sides it's your side they side and God's side I know I'm preaching if God who can give me victory over myself a man can surely give me victory over the disease that that's trying to take me from him that God can now look at how brother Brandon talk about a bear and a lion and and and he said I just wish God would let me break down those animals and then it talk about this give me Victory myself the the devil got you in a bare hug it's true the devil squeezing the life out of you but if God can give you Victory oh y'all Ain y'all a't y'all a reading the same quote that I'm reading if God cannot just give you victory over your your your your neighbor let let let me show them where they wrong help me to show them where they're wrong father help me Jesus I mean give me doern so I can really get right in there and show them you did this and you did that and if you wouldn't have did this and if you wouldn't have did that we would be over here help me to show them Lord know that ain't what the quote saying the quote saying oh Lord God give me victory over myself sir Lord God what did I do that contributed to all this what what what did I say that contributed to all this what is this Lord help help me to to to conquer me that's it God I'm wrong oh Lord amen God give me victory over myself yes amen can surely give me victory over the disease that's trying to take me from him the the god that can save me and make me something that I'm not when I'm not a Christian can make me make a Christian out of me by believing his word this this is so important that we overcome us it's time for I to die I thought about this amen when I looked at uh this this the the the the the violent take it by force another little army that was just uh my God they were so they were so small but they were strong now I want to say something here and I'm I'm I'mma close this Army of Gideon they were uh they were first great in numbers they had about uh you know God first God you know comes to him with a prophet and says hey Gideon you a mighty man of Valor now Gideon when you look at him scripture he did not look like no Mighty Man of Valor he looked very weak right but he say you know you're a mighty man of Valor and it says um you know it says I'm going to use you Gideon and y'all G y'all G to break loose from the enemy I'mma use you he's like well you know if uh if God is with us then where is all his miracles he had a good question say where are all his miracles say get I'm going to show you I'm going to show you a few things I'm going to show you some Miracles now one of the Miracles that Gideon uh saw is that he went out there and he put a fleece before the Lord and he said now Lord if you with me let let all the Earth be wet and then this fleece be dry then I know that you're with me went out there the next morning all the Earth was W the fleece was dry I said no that could have been a chance that could have just been a chance I don't know all right I'm coming back out here now this time let all the Earth be dry and the fleece be wet it's like come out the next morning fleece was wet everything else dry sitting down look okay so get and I still know you got a problem believing I know you got a problem believing so I want you to do me a favor I want you to go down into the enemy's Camp I'mma say something here and I want you to hear what they saying about you down there in the enemy's camp and Gideon goes down there and takes one of his soldiers with him and they go down there and they they happen to just stumble upon a couple enemies talking and one guy talking to his friend he say I had a dream I had a dream and I saw this happen I saw this happen I saw this happen in the enemy's Camp I want y'all to catch this now I had a dream and and this happened and happen and and and and while he's telling the dream his buddy Rises up and say oh that I know the interpretation that that's swore to Gideon Gideon getting ready to come down here and defeat us all now here there's a thing that I want to say in the enemy's Camp the gifts were in operation I'mma say that again in the enemy's Camp they had dreams and interpret ations of Dreams in the enemy's camp and you going to tell me that we can't have it in this Camp if the enemy benefiting from that I mean that just imagine man say man that that's that's Gideon coming out we don't know what to do I me these guys probably ready to run for their life because they knew they was defeated it was already revealed to them sir what was getting ready to happen when and Gideon heard that he took so much courage man let's go on back down here we're going to run this God God going show the enemy already know we coming to defeat him you can imagine them telling that testimony all around the camp you can the people's hearts was they they were already defeated before they even started the battle their own gift defeated [Music] them I don't know if we got that one Church get and go back all all encourage yes sir oh we going to take him out and he had 32,000 soldiers and God say uh Gideon you know uh your army a little bit too big your army a little bit too big he says I want you to break down this Army say anybody that got any fear any fear send them back home next to 22,00 th men leave just like that that much fear in the Army 22,000 just walked away and and I wonder if God was to ask that question in this room how how many really want to go on the offense are how many just so afraid of the devil that they don't want no none of this battle and get up and leave here comes uh and and and so then then God say you got 10,000 left okay and Gideon I just need to tell you something your arm is still too big now you know I got some saying that they they ain't afraid but they this your arm is still a little bit too big he says now we're going to test this and I want you to just take them down to the water and let them drink some water and we're going the ones that get down and brother brand say they prostrated their face on the ground and they they was drinking water just prostrating on the ground like they was worshiping Idols that's what brother brand said prophetic Insight gives us this he said like they were just worshiping Idols this is what it looked like they were just worshiping idols and he says uh he says put them to one side he says but the other ones that get down and lap like dogs and when a dog when he laps he sticks his head in the water but he always looking you know so when they get down there and they got their head they always looking they always on guard right he said now when you get them that that pick it up like that put them to another side he say had 9,700 lapping like dogs I mean lap lapping like uh prostrate and then the other one over here lapping 300 over here he says now Gideon what I need you to do is take the 300 and go in the office yes sir Hallelujah and I I just these numbers right here just bless my heart um it was 135,000 midianites that was getting ready to come against 32,000 Israelites the odds with that were 4 to one that mean I got to take out four of them and to to one one soldier got to take out four of them in order to win now when God say send the scare cats home it went to 10,000 Israelites versus 135,000 and that mean I got to take out 13.5 to my one now God done put me to another test I'm down to 300 and I got 135,000 minites that I'm going to face my odds are 450 to one almost seem impossible but with God's math one can chase a th000 and two will put 10,000 to flight and brother Solomon did the math he said just add another zero and if if three of us would get together we' take out a 100,000 and if four of us would get together 1 million now the math ain't math and I can't I can't count the rest of it but I know when we all stand together we'll defeat [Music] Devils there in Gideon's AR me uh God defeated the enemy after you know he um he he developed a plan he heard the dream and interpretation the dream getting said let's go down here and we G to split the Army up and you know 100 over here 100 over here 100 and said y'all just y'all just start banging on pots and pants and and just say the the sword of the lord always put God first the sword of the Lord and of Gideon sir see they they knew that Gideon was coming into that area the the they they knew by the interpretation of dream Gideon was coming so when he said the swore the Lord and of Gideon these guys knew they was finished 135,000 was only fighting 300 because Gideon was willing to go on the offense and let me just put it this way I don't care what your obstacle is if you're willing to take a step of faith and go on the offense I guarantee you will be [Applause] victorious if it's a job go on the offense if it's a car go on the offense if it's a healing go on the offense if it's your family restored go on the offense yes sir now some of that going on the offense might be you overcoming yourself it might start there but when you can move into that position you'll watch God begin to do things that you never thought that he could do God bless you Church praise the Lord amen let's have a word of prayer father we thank you for your word we thank you for this truth Lord as the the prophet uh made the statement Lord if we could just uh get victory over oursel the god that gave us the ability to get Victory o over ourself will also give us the ability to get victory over everything else father we uh we trust that this that that you Lord God would just help us to see what it is that you needed to see so Joshua they came against IE they lost 36 men because of the way things were handled by achen but oh God if we could just see father Lord that it was always your will for them to overcome I it's always your will but they had to take care of certain things before they could do it father it's the same thing with us God we got to overcome ourselves before we see victory in any other area in our life we have to overcome ourselves this offensive move sometimes is for us to die so help us Lord to Lord just hear the voice of the spirit amen speaking to us in our situations and circumstances we trust oh God that um Lord this this little series that you gave us we want to move from this defensive position father now to offensive position we've allowed the devil to run rough shot for a long time but oh God we're rising up as Sons and Daughters of God to claim our inheritance to claim our position and I trust oh God that it won't just be a a message Father that just kind of goes in one ear and out the other but Lord let it become manifestation Lord in our lives for we need it Lord now more than ever ever before God we need it father we give you all the glory we give you all all the honor we give you all the praise as you alone deserve it it's in Jesus name that we pray amen amen praise the Lord [Applause] [Music] amen amen um I wanted to just uh leave you with this this quote out of the series we would see Jesus the prophet makes a statement says brother's Footprints is possession ministering brother don't be afraid to put Footprints where God has told you to go amen it's possession he told Joshua everywhere The Souls of your feet set that's yours we got to move out Footprints his possession says everywhere The Souls of your feet set that's yours amen we don't back up I like that we don't back up we take what God Said and that's the truth no matter what the opposition is how great it seems and how difficult it seems if God said so it's yours when he gave it to Joshua he never said I'll take all the hav the Philistines and give it to you no that's not what God Said right it says um uh Joshua had to fight for every inch of ground but God was with him and every inch of ground you'll cover brother to make Footprints you'll fight your way through but take the sword of the spirit brother and move right on because Footprints is possession so church I hope you're ready to fight amen I hope you're ready to fight and I'm telling you you will possess amen what you're fighting for may the Lord bless you I'll turn the service back over to brother Solomon amen at this time God bless you will you stand with me say I'm going to see a victory yes I'm going to see a victory for The Battle Belongs
