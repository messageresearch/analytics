[5:16] thank you once again bless the words
[5:18] that will be that will be spoken and
[5:19] touch every heart in the precious name
[5:21] of Jesus Christ
[5:23] amen amen so um in this first you you
[5:28] you may all be seated
[5:30] in this first verse that we have here in
[5:32] ecclesiastics uh the verse one here it
[5:35] says to everything there is a season and
[5:36] a time to every purpose under the heaven
[5:39] and it's very very important to remember
[5:41] that word that statement of of under the
[5:44] heaven all right so as we go into the
[5:47] message God's appointed time uh God has
[5:51] a time for everything God has everything
[5:54] planned out and the beautiful thing
[5:56] about this is he's already set the dates
[5:59] and the times before anything has ever
[6:02] happened right so we're just fitting in
[6:04] to whatever Vision that he had uh so
[6:07] that's where we can find our confidence
[6:09] for whatever we're going through because
[6:11] he's already solved the problem right
[6:14] he's already came up with a resolution
[6:16] we're just here just to hear it and to
[6:18] receive it right so in order to talk
[6:21] about God's appointed time we have to
[6:23] look at some natural phenomena so um one
[6:28] of the most beautiful things that you'll
[6:29] ever see in this earth is uh is sunlight
[6:32] right and it's something that no matter
[6:35] what country you live in no matter what
[6:36] race you are no matter what whether
[6:39] you're a Christian a a Believer not a
[6:41] Believer or no matter your um a
[6:44] denomination that you belong to it's
[6:46] something that we all love and enjoy
[6:48] it's something that we all have a a a
[6:51] common ground on right and we love to
[6:53] all see when the Sun rises like the
[6:55] rising of the sun people love to see the
[6:57] rising of the Sun and when you look at a
[6:59] lot of nature uh when when the Sun rises
[7:03] everything else Also Rises with uh uh um
[7:07] with with the Sun as it goes so
[7:09] regardless if you're black or white
[7:10] regardless if you're in the denom
[7:13] denomination regardless if you believe
[7:15] God or you don't we all love to rise
[7:17] when the Sun rises it's something that's
[7:19] very natural to us right as human beings
[7:22] um because science has found out that we
[7:25] have a biological clock that is inside
[7:28] of us that it's sets a rhythm to when
[7:30] the Sun rises up and it helps us to wake
[7:34] up right it helps us to wake up because
[7:36] we weren't made to live during the night
[7:38] time right we weren't made to live in
[7:40] the dark you know um I and I know that
[7:43] some people may say they work at night
[7:45] but I I actually have a um an experience
[7:48] with this because I used to be a night
[7:49] auditor for comfort and hotels I think
[7:52] back in 2011 and I did that job for
[7:55] maybe 3 or 4 years and we had to do we
[7:58] had I had a shift that was called the
[8:00] graveyard shift and that was from 11:00
[8:02] p.m. I did that from 11:00 p.m. all the
[8:05] way to 7:00 a.m. so I had to do my
[8:07] sleeping during the daytime and then I
[8:09] had to try to stay up at night um uh
[8:12] stay up at night and so it was it was
[8:16] tough trying to get sleep during the day
[8:20] like it's nothing like sleeping at night
[8:23] right and it's nothing like being up
[8:24] during the daytime uh and I remember I
[8:27] would go in my closet you have no window
[8:29] and it be pitch black and I put the
[8:31] little put a little cloth under the door
[8:33] to block out all the light and it' be
[8:34] pitch black dark in there but it is
[8:37] nothing like just sleeping at night and
[8:39] then waking up to a sunrise that feels
[8:41] natural right and and so science has has
[8:46] found out these things is that your body
[8:48] actually produces a chemical called
[8:50] melatonin when it's dark outside and
[8:53] what that does is it's your body's way
[8:55] of trying to get you to relax and get
[8:57] you drowsy so that you can sleep so it's
[9:00] it's it's God's design of trying to help
[9:02] you uh uh live uh uh according to the
[9:06] laws of this land right um and and no
[9:09] one wants to start their day at 12: at
[9:12] midnight or or 1 p.m. or 2 p.m. you'll
[9:15] never hear anybody say they want to
[9:17] start their day uh at midnight no people
[9:19] want to start their day at the rising of
[9:21] the Sun and and it's no matter your
[9:24] denomination whether you believe God or
[9:26] you don't believe God you want to rise
[9:28] when the Sun rises
[9:30] right so in order to experience the
[9:34] rising of the sun uh there's a couple of
[9:37] uh things you have to factor in one is
[9:38] going to be your time zone whatever time
[9:41] zone that you're in that'll be that'll
[9:43] that it it it'll show you uh uh exactly
[9:46] when you'll experience a sunrise so with
[9:48] all the saints in London right now they
[9:50] have a different time zone that we're in
[9:52] and they'll experience Sunshine
[9:54] different when we than we'll experience
[9:56] sunshine and uh and an important thing
[9:58] about that is they have to their bodies
[10:00] are working right now to help them to
[10:02] adjust to that change right because the
[10:05] body still seeking to see the sun
[10:07] regardless of where you are in the world
[10:10] this body wants to rise when the Sun
[10:12] rises right it is something so natural
[10:15] to us that we don't have to think about
[10:16] it our body just goes to work at it
[10:19] right and it's important to type these
[10:20] things from natural to the spiritual
[10:23] right and so another uh another factor
[10:25] that you have to think about is uh the
[10:27] season changes right so um in the fall
[10:31] time uh in the fall and winter time the
[10:33] Sun will rise at different times and
[10:35] even in the springtime the sun will rise
[10:37] and fall at uh at different times right
[10:40] and it's important to realize because I
[10:44] and I've and I've I studied about this
[10:46] uh I'm going to tell you a story about
[10:48] uh this this astronomer that kind of had
[10:50] this uh debate with the Roman Catholic
[10:53] Church uh I think it was in the 1600s
[10:55] but it's important to realize that in
[10:58] the right rising of the sun cuz we say
[11:01] rising the the sun rises and the sun
[11:03] sets and it's true from our viewpoint
[11:06] but we have to realize that in actuality
[11:10] the sun is just setting there regardless
[11:13] if it's dark regardless if it's uh uh uh
[11:15] whatever time uh uh day it is regardless
[11:17] wherever you are in the world the sun is
[11:20] always setting there but it's the Earth
[11:22] that's constantly going through
[11:24] different changes right and so the
[11:26] Catholic Church actually in the 1600
[11:29] they had a doctrine that they tried to
[11:31] base off the Bible that said the Earth
[11:34] is in the center of the universe and the
[11:36] Sun is revolving around the earth and uh
[11:39] they tried and they tried to back it
[11:41] with the scripture which we'll we'll
[11:43] we'll see that is not true right um uh
[11:47] Ju Just just alone in Ecclesiastes that
[11:49] first verse when it says in a time and
[11:51] person a time and purpose under the
[11:53] heavens it's under the heavens where a
[11:55] lot of changes go through and a lot of
[11:57] changes happen and stuff like that that
[11:59] but when you get above the heavens and
[12:02] it comes to God he's just there in his
[12:04] word there's no frustration there's no
[12:07] worry there's no argument there's no
[12:09] debate it's just the word and that's and
[12:11] that's exactly how the Sun is the sun is
[12:13] just sitting right there in the center
[12:15] of the center of the universe and it's
[12:17] just shining it's job is just to shine
[12:19] it's the Earth that goes through the
[12:21] different changes so the Catholic Church
[12:23] tried to get people to believe that it
[12:26] was the Sun moving around the Earth and
[12:28] the Earth was one that was set and still
[12:30] and then and so there was this uh
[12:32] astronomer named Galileo and of course
[12:35] they didn't have as many technological
[12:37] advances that we have today to kind of
[12:39] see these things but he but based off
[12:41] the research he had and what he saw he
[12:44] said well no uhuh I I believe that it's
[12:48] the Earth is the one that's revolving
[12:50] around the sun and the Catholic Church
[12:52] got upset with him because he was a
[12:54] Catholic as well and by him saying that
[12:56] it would have gone against the Catholic
[12:58] Doctrine so then they set a trial for
[13:00] him and they accused him of you know
[13:03] going against the doctrine or whatever
[13:04] and they put him in on house arrest come
[13:06] to find out later on down through
[13:08] history as we begin to get more advanced
[13:10] with science they found out that the sun
[13:13] is in the center of the universe and the
[13:15] Earth is revolving around and the Pope
[13:18] in 19 I believe it was 1992 had to give
[13:21] an apology to this man that they had put
[13:23] in jail 300 years ago to say that no we
[13:26] had it wrong right we had itong wrong
[13:30] right and the reason why I'm talking
[13:32] about the sun in this kind of aspect is
[13:34] like I said before the word of God is
[13:36] likened to sunlight and that it always
[13:39] stays the same it's something you can
[13:41] trust no matter how no matter what
[13:44] you're going through in life no matter
[13:45] how where you're at in the universe
[13:47] because the sun doesn't move but the
[13:49] Earth does move and the Earth does move
[13:51] in different points of the universe and
[13:52] no matter where you're at in one point
[13:54] of the of the universe the sun is
[13:56] sitting there remaining the same with
[13:58] the Sun light just blazing through and
[14:01] even when we and and it's not the Sun
[14:04] that gets storms right storms don't
[14:07] happen on on the sun hurricanes don't
[14:09] happen on the sun uh uh earthquakes and
[14:12] all those things don't happen to the Sun
[14:13] so that's what happens in the earth the
[14:15] earth is what gets storms and the Earth
[14:17] can get to a point where it's so cloudy
[14:19] to where you can't see any sea any
[14:21] sunlight but that does not mean that the
[14:23] sun is still not shining right it
[14:25] doesn't matter how how how much the uh
[14:27] the thunderstorm is going on you can
[14:29] really hear you can hear the you can see
[14:31] the lightning you can hear the thunder
[14:33] very very loud right you can see and
[14:35] you're from if you're from Florida you
[14:37] y'all know about hurricanes and
[14:38] hurricanes is are no joke right and uh
[14:42] uh but regardless of all the destruction
[14:44] that's going on you know people if you
[14:46] go to the Midwest of the US you'll see
[14:49] people in tornadoes and just devastating
[14:51] tornadoes but regardless of all that's
[14:54] going on the sun is still shining right
[14:57] and it's very very important to remember
[14:59] remember that um I actually had an
[15:01] experience and I don't know if it
[15:02] happens down here in Florida but one
[15:04] time I was in the uh I was on the
[15:06] military based with my dad in the
[15:07] commissary which is just a grocery store
[15:10] back when we were in uh Virginia and one
[15:13] and all of a sudden we were shopping
[15:15] going down the aisle and all a sudden
[15:16] the Earth just shook and just started
[15:18] shaking and I was so scared in that
[15:21] moment stuff was flying off of the
[15:23] shelves and I in that moment I realized
[15:27] that there is no
[15:29] Foundation right when you're in when
[15:31] you're in an earthquake and you're
[15:33] feeling that Earth just shake Beneath
[15:34] Your Feet you realize you ain't standing
[15:37] really on nothing right but regardless
[15:40] of what was going on the sun was still
[15:43] shining right it didn't stop the Sun
[15:46] from shining right so we have to get
[15:48] that thinking out of our our we have to
[15:50] get that thinking out of our head that
[15:52] when things are going on uh all of a
[15:54] sudden the sun is no longer there no
[15:57] it's always there it's always been in
[15:59] there right and and you have to you have
[16:01] to realize that when you're going
[16:04] through a situation and it's it's it's
[16:07] it's important to recognize that Christ
[16:09] is the head right because Christ is not
[16:12] in a position where he is where he goes
[16:15] through storms now that he's seated in
[16:17] Heavenly places he doesn't deal with
[16:19] those kind of things all he has is
[16:21] directions and what you should do and
[16:23] where you should go and how to handle
[16:25] the situation because when you're going
[16:27] through a situation and you're trying to
[16:29] reason your way out the problem with us
[16:32] and what makes us different is that we
[16:34] have emotions that come with it when we
[16:37] get in trouble you know we not so when
[16:39] we get into a trouble situation you know
[16:41] we feel sad we feel discouraged right we
[16:44] feel flustrated we feel angry and so you
[16:47] can't reason when you're in that state
[16:50] because in your mind you're trying to
[16:52] figure out a way to get out of this
[16:54] thing but you're also trying to manage
[16:55] these emotions that you're dealing with
[16:57] so now you're split in between two
[16:59] places and what you need is another
[17:02] voice right you need another voice and a
[17:05] clear voice from somebody that is not in
[17:07] the same position as you that can give
[17:09] you a word that you can rest on right
[17:12] something that you can rest on and and
[17:15] I'm here to tell you that uh uh you're
[17:17] going to go through a lot of hard things
[17:19] in life the Earth was God made it that
[17:23] way and and so a lot of times people
[17:24] wonder about you know why do I got to
[17:26] pay bills why do I got to pay taxes why
[17:28] do I got to go why do I have to go to
[17:29] work and ecclesiastic says there's a
[17:32] time and a season for everything so
[17:34] you're not it's it's never going to be
[17:36] good 100% you're only fooling yourself
[17:40] right and so and and this this this
[17:43] Bible verse wasn't it wasn't put into
[17:45] the Bible to make you afraid but it was
[17:47] there it was put it was put in the Bible
[17:49] it was put there to get you to realize
[17:51] that you have help while you're going
[17:53] through right and you don't have to
[17:54] figure out everything yourself and
[17:56] there's somebody that you can call on to
[17:58] when you're going through these things
[18:00] right there's somebody that knows when
[18:02] these appointments are going to happen
[18:04] and he can come down and step into your
[18:06] situation right it's also to let you
[18:08] know uh just how not in control you are
[18:12] when I was in that earthquake it made me
[18:14] realize I can't run I was like I can't
[18:17] you you can't run nowhere when that
[18:18] Earth is shaking and things is crashing
[18:21] all around you you have no control you
[18:23] can't run you can't jump you just got to
[18:25] sit there and hope for the best right
[18:27] and that's kind of
[18:30] life is right uh
[18:33] so um so no matter the situation the son
[18:36] will always arrive at the pointed time
[18:38] because in the beginning God spoke that
[18:41] the Sun would rise and the sun would set
[18:43] and the sun has obeyed the voice of God
[18:45] ever since day one right and just
[18:47] because you don't see anything doesn't
[18:49] mean that the sun is not there right so
[18:52] getting into appointments now um because
[18:57] you know when the sun arises is it
[18:59] signifies a time when things need to get
[19:01] done or when things begin to happen
[19:03] right and so I've never
[19:06] seen a human being or I've never heard
[19:09] of someone waking up in the middle of
[19:11] the night going outside and Yelling to
[19:13] the Sky for the sun to rise sooner I
[19:16] don't think I've ever seen anyone do
[19:17] that right I don't think I've ever seen
[19:19] someone get up in the middle of the
[19:20] night and yell to the sky son why are
[19:22] you taking so long to come right no we
[19:26] know the sun will rise right because we
[19:29] saw it rise yesterday we saw it Rose the
[19:31] day before and we saw it raise the day
[19:34] before and we saw it raise the day
[19:36] before and no matter what we're going
[19:38] through in life because like I said
[19:39] everyone goes through troubles nobody is
[19:41] exempt from ecclesiastics 3 right
[19:44] everyone's going to go through troubles
[19:46] but even people in the world that don't
[19:48] have God they even they know that the
[19:51] day will still be that there will still
[19:53] come another day all right to try again
[19:56] all right to or to see that Sunrise so
[19:58] we know for a fact that the sun is going
[20:00] to keep Rising right there's an innate
[20:02] belief inside of us to just trust the
[20:05] process and that's very very very
[20:07] important to trust the trust the process
[20:09] because every help that you get every
[20:12] single help that you receive in life is
[20:13] going to be an appointment God always
[20:16] makes an appointment with man for
[20:18] everything in life uh uh and it's always
[20:21] in his timing right so um and uh and
[20:25] also you know cuz when I explained about
[20:29] the seasons changing as well you know
[20:31] how you have the uh I think it's fall
[20:33] back the daylight savings where you fall
[20:35] back spring you spring forward and you
[20:38] lose an hour you might complain for a
[20:40] little while but after a while it's like
[20:43] hey back to business right it's back to
[20:46] business you trust the process
[20:49] right uh um and and also a key thing for
[20:54] resting uh uh a key thing for resting is
[20:57] is is a part that we play play the
[20:59] reason why you want to rest at night
[21:01] while the sun is not there is because
[21:03] what are you doing you're resting and
[21:04] knowing that the sun will rise again and
[21:07] you will wake again right and that's a
[21:09] key thing to remember in all things in
[21:11] life uh uh even uh uh I think one time
[21:14] the prophet even said even when you're
[21:16] on your death bed you can expect Christ
[21:19] to be there you have to have some kind
[21:20] of faith and some kind of hope that when
[21:22] you're sitting there and you're changing
[21:24] through those Realms and you're
[21:26] experiencing that death process that
[21:28] Christ is going to rise in that
[21:30] situation to take you home right so uh
[21:33] uh the night reminds us to rest and rest
[21:37] in what rest in knowing the process that
[21:39] the sun will rise again right so when
[21:44] God makes an appointment right uh he
[21:47] keeps all of them right he keeps all his
[21:49] appointment and he keeps all his
[21:50] appointments on time uh I'm going to
[21:52] turn to Genesis um I know they they
[21:55] don't have this up but I just we're
[21:57] going to turn to genesis8 18 and read
[22:00] verses 9 through 10 we're going to read
[22:01] a couple verses here
[22:04] um y so turn to Genesis
[22:09] 18 and it says here and they say and
[22:12] they said unto him where is Sarah thy
[22:15] wife and he said behold in the tent and
[22:19] he said I will certainly return unto
[22:21] thee according to the time of life and
[22:23] lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and
[22:26] Sarah heard it in the tent door which
[22:28] was behind him so God knew that they had
[22:31] this issue of having a kid and so here
[22:34] is God coming down and here's God
[22:36] setting the appointment now I want you
[22:38] to it's important to realize God sets
[22:41] your appointments you don't set your
[22:43] appointments when you set your
[22:45] appointment it's going to get very very
[22:47] frustrating right because things won't
[22:49] move in the way that you expect them to
[22:51] but when God comes and sets an
[22:53] appointment right he just gives you his
[22:56] promise or his word that he's going to
[22:58] do something right so we're going to
[22:59] turn to Genesis uh 2 uh
[23:03] 21 and we're going to read from verses
[23:08] uh 1-
[23:13] two and it reads and the Lord visited
[23:17] Sarah as he had said and the Lord did
[23:20] unto Sarah as he had spoken for Sarah
[23:24] conceived and bear Abraham a son in his
[23:26] old age at the set time oh which God had
[23:29] spoken to him I want you to realize that
[23:33] God kept his word god kept his
[23:36] appointment and notice it didn't it
[23:38] didn't say anything about it didn't say
[23:40] anything about how Sarah and Abraham
[23:42] felt about it God just said I was going
[23:44] to do what I said I was going to do
[23:46] right so it's important to receive a
[23:48] word from the Lord because there's a lot
[23:51] of stuff that's going to happen in
[23:52] between right but you but you have to
[23:55] have you have to have confidence that no
[23:57] matter what that word is still there
[24:00] you're going to experience a lot of
[24:01] things in life that are are that are
[24:03] going to try to bring you down and it's
[24:06] important to have a head it's important
[24:08] to have somebody with a clear voice
[24:10] right with a clear word so that when
[24:12] you're going through a situation and you
[24:14] feel like nothing's going to happen you
[24:16] have to go back to the word that says
[24:18] hold on a second God said this was going
[24:20] to happen and I want you to realize that
[24:23] Isaac was already there right Isaac was
[24:27] already there so it wasn't something
[24:29] that they had to do it's just something
[24:31] that they had to believe for right it's
[24:35] predestination right it's a
[24:37] predestinated path where God says if
[24:39] something will be there it will be there
[24:42] and you just trust in it no matter what
[24:44] you're going through because you're
[24:45] going to get frustrated there's going to
[24:47] be frustrations there's going to be
[24:48] times where you feel like giving up you
[24:50] know uh uh it's not easy to have faith
[24:53] it's not easy to try to have faith in
[24:55] your own time of wanting things to
[24:57] happen right it's going to get you
[24:59] frustrated but when you can go back to
[25:01] God and bring and uh uh and and God
[25:03] loves it God loves it when you challenge
[25:05] him with his own word when you go back
[25:07] to God and bring him his word and say
[25:09] Lord you promis this thing right Lord
[25:12] you promis this thing you set this thing
[25:15] all right you showed this thing to me in
[25:17] your word and if God has revealed
[25:19] something to you he has to do it all
[25:21] right and you can remind them every
[25:23] single Sunrise because the sun is a the
[25:26] sun is is is an exact EX example of his
[25:29] word just remaining no matter what is
[25:31] going on right so when we make
[25:35] appointments in the natural sense what
[25:38] we do is you know let's say let's say if
[25:41] you're uh let's say your garage is is
[25:43] broken or something like that you'll
[25:44] call someone they'll make an appraisal
[25:46] and they'll say hey yeah this situation
[25:49] we can fix this thing and then when they
[25:51] set an appointment they'll give you a uh
[25:53] uh they'll give you they'll tell you
[25:55] what they're going to do we're going to
[25:56] resolve so and so issue and they also
[25:59] give you a date and time of when they're
[26:01] going to do it right but God works a
[26:04] little different than how man does when
[26:06] he schedules his appointments right so I
[26:08] can see if we can dramatize this
[26:10] situation of Abraham uh God coming to
[26:13] Abraham I can see God in heaven uh take
[26:16] out some planner let's say if he had a
[26:18] cabinet file next to his throne he took
[26:20] out some planner and he said Abraham
[26:23] you're going to have a son right I'm
[26:24] going to meet you at the time of life
[26:25] and you're going to have the son right
[26:27] God told told him what was going to
[26:29] happen but never told him when it would
[26:31] happen right but when we make
[26:34] appointments we like to know the time we
[26:36] like to know the date we like to know
[26:38] the time we like to know the location we
[26:41] like to know all the specifics and that
[26:44] helps build us confidence and we have to
[26:47] be careful when we're going to God now
[26:49] with appointments because you can't come
[26:50] with that same level of faith and the
[26:52] same level of confidence because a lot
[26:54] of times God doesn't tell you when it's
[26:55] going to happen true God want tell you
[26:58] when it's going to happen he'll promise
[27:00] something but he'll never tell you when
[27:01] it's going to happen he'll never tell
[27:03] you what you have to go through right so
[27:06] so they knew when the appointment was
[27:08] but God never told him it's going to
[27:09] happen now sometimes he may tell you
[27:11] sometimes he won't but there's a reason
[27:12] why he doesn't like to say things right
[27:16] uh uh sometimes he likes to wait because
[27:19] one of the things about God that a lot
[27:20] of people don't realize is God is a
[27:23] tester right God loves to test God loves
[27:27] to test
[27:29] everything right uh uh uh I can it it's
[27:32] just it's just one it's just one of his
[27:33] attributes that we probably don't praise
[27:35] enough you know we love him as a blesser
[27:38] we love him as a Healer you know we love
[27:40] him as all of these uh joyous things but
[27:42] God likes to test you God likes to put
[27:45] you through fire God likes to try you
[27:47] out just to God likes to stretch you out
[27:50] to see how much can you bear I want to
[27:52] see how much I can get out of you right
[27:55] he's kind of like a a uh one of those um
[27:58] I and I remember those shows where you
[27:59] see those people that like uh those rich
[28:01] people where they're very very concerned
[28:03] I mean they got this wealth of knowledge
[28:05] and they're very very concerned about
[28:07] just one penny of it right and God I
[28:09] feel kind God's kind of the same way
[28:11] where he wants to he wants he wants to
[28:13] test every single aspect of your life
[28:16] every single part of you he wants to
[28:17] make sure that that thing is solid right
[28:20] so God loves to test and test and test
[28:23] and test uh and and Peter actually said
[28:26] that our trials and tribulations are
[28:29] actually more precious than gold so we
[28:31] tend to look at uh uh the earth and the
[28:34] worldly things uh uh in the things of
[28:36] the world but Peter is coming here and
[28:38] saying that when you're going through a
[28:39] trial when you recognize that you're
[28:42] going through a trial or a tribulation
[28:44] it's counted joy and we kind of tend to
[28:47] take the opposite view where we think oh
[28:50] man things is going hard but you see God
[28:54] likes to test that faith in what you
[28:56] believe in the word and God says no I
[28:58] said it's Joy right I said it's Joy what
[29:01] are you looking sad for what are you
[29:02] looking down for right he's trying to
[29:04] test that Faith to see do you really
[29:06] believe the word amen right do you
[29:09] really believe the word right so when
[29:13] God uh um when God doesn't give you a
[29:16] time of the appointment when it's going
[29:18] to happen he's looking for something
[29:20] else right he's looking for something
[29:22] else to happen uh uh out of that
[29:24] situation right so when we make
[29:27] appointments like I said we just want to
[29:28] get the thing done we just like okay set
[29:31] time here it is we just want to get it
[29:33] done right um but God likes to see our
[29:36] reactions God likes to see our reactions
[29:39] when we're waiting uh uh one to see do
[29:42] you really believe him right two to make
[29:45] sure that uh uh that uh your desire is a
[29:48] real good desire to have right right in
[29:51] uh uh in that waiting period so there's
[29:54] a uh there's a story in the Bible of um
[29:57] of Hannah and so uh sister Hannah she
[30:00] was um the Bible says that the Lord
[30:04] struck her womb so that she couldn't
[30:06] have kids so it's not that she it's not
[30:10] that uh uh it was something that she did
[30:13] herself God caused this Affliction to
[30:15] come upon her and the Bible says that
[30:18] she went through years and years and
[30:20] years and years dealing with this thing
[30:22] the Bible says she couldn't eat her
[30:24] husband had came to her and said why
[30:25] aren't you eating uh the Bible says that
[30:27] her was fail so she's at she's at a time
[30:31] where she wants a child just like
[30:33] Abraham uh uh did uh uh and so she wants
[30:37] an appointment with God God's the one
[30:39] that shut up her womb and now he's and
[30:40] now it it seems like he's not saying
[30:43] nothing now right but just like the sun
[30:47] right the word is still there doesn't
[30:49] matter how down you are it doesn't
[30:51] matter how much continent you've lost or
[30:54] or or enjoyment of life that you lost
[30:56] the word is still there right and so in
[30:59] that time that Hannah was going through
[31:02] what she was going through it I believe
[31:04] it caused her to reflect about the
[31:06] desires that she had until one point she
[31:09] came to the Altar and we know the story
[31:12] how she began to cry and the Bible says
[31:15] that this prayer uh uh she was uh she
[31:19] was praying inside of her heart but what
[31:21] she was saying on the outside just
[31:23] looked crazy God wants authentic prayers
[31:26] God wants an authentic talk God wants
[31:29] something when you come to God he wants
[31:31] you to be authentic 100% authentic he
[31:34] wants every deep part of your heart in
[31:36] order for him to respond back and so now
[31:39] she's in a position where she can talk
[31:41] to God without anything blocking and she
[31:44] says and she ask God for the right thing
[31:46] she says Lord give me a child uh uh um
[31:50] and I will give him to you I'll give him
[31:53] back to you and God's like you ask for
[31:56] the right thing right you ask for the
[31:58] right thing and then of course you know
[32:00] the the story how God had given her a um
[32:03] a a prophet right so the Prophet The
[32:07] Prophet was already there right so in
[32:10] her crying and in her countenance down
[32:12] in her not eating nothing her son was
[32:14] already there God just needed her to say
[32:17] the right words in order to release him
[32:19] amen right and she had no selfish
[32:21] motives behind that and when she spoke
[32:24] the right words she said all right now
[32:25] he can come amen and we can go to
[32:28] another story if we uh turn to the uh if
[32:31] you go to the New Testament uh uh uh of
[32:33] the sis of the of the woman that um she
[32:36] had a a child that was uh vexed by a
[32:39] devil I believe it
[32:41] says and she came to God because she
[32:44] knew that Jesus Christ could change her
[32:46] situation around and she had come to him
[32:49] uh uh uh looking for him to uh uh uh
[32:52] touch a situation and spoke to him and
[32:54] he didn't say a word back right now see
[32:57] God wants to like I said God is always a
[33:00] tester and I believe that uh the word of
[33:03] God said Jesus Christ it said Jesus uh
[33:06] uh Jesus Christ said he does nothing
[33:08] unless the father shows him first so I
[33:10] believe he knew exactly how the
[33:12] situation was going to happen and he had
[33:14] to act according to the vision right
[33:16] just to see the fruit come from this
[33:18] lady right and so he did he he didn't
[33:21] say anything to her he didn't say not
[33:23] not one word to her and I want you to
[33:26] realize that can look like a a a a
[33:30] cloudy situation right but this sister
[33:32] knew that no matter what I'm going
[33:34] through the sun is still shining right
[33:38] the sun is still there no matter what
[33:40] I'm going through no matter how hard it
[33:41] looks her disciples even uh told her hey
[33:45] this woman is coming to you man just
[33:47] just just take her off and uh he made
[33:50] the comment that you know I only come to
[33:51] the house of children I've only come to
[33:53] the uh uh to the Israelites during that
[33:55] time and the Bible says she didn't turn
[33:57] away she still worshiped so I want you I
[34:00] want to let you know that even when
[34:01] you're going through a troubling time
[34:04] you still have to worship now you have
[34:06] to understand that when she was sitting
[34:08] there this was her talking face to face
[34:11] with God just as we see each other face
[34:13] to face this man Jesus Christ God and
[34:16] flesh said nothing to her so can you
[34:19] imagine being in that situation if you
[34:22] were coming to brother Jack asking him
[34:23] to help you with a situation and brother
[34:25] Jack didn't say nothing to you right and
[34:28] then brother Troy came up and said hey
[34:29] hey we we need you to get out of here
[34:31] right or some of the other brother said
[34:32] hey hey we need to get out how would you
[34:34] react in that situation right and then
[34:37] he makes the comment you know I only
[34:39] come to the house of I only come to the
[34:41] house of Jose I'm not sent to these guys
[34:43] and then it says she still worshiped
[34:45] right because she still believed in that
[34:48] son being there regardless of her
[34:50] situation and then like I said God loves
[34:53] to test God just loves to test and test
[34:55] and test and test if you can get that
[34:58] concept planted in your heart you'll be
[35:01] successful in life you'll be successful
[35:03] with God in life when you understand his
[35:06] expectations it makes life a lot more
[35:09] easier uh uh to go through and so then
[35:12] he comes to the point where he says you
[35:14] know it's not meat for me to give the
[35:15] children's bread to a dog right and it's
[35:19] it's another level of a test that he
[35:22] just Slams on her so she came to him he
[35:25] didn't say anything she still came to
[35:28] him he still didn't respond to him still
[35:31] worshiped him still was praising him in
[35:33] his car going to work you know how we
[35:35] all praise him praise him on Sunday and
[35:37] then he comes and says I don't give it's
[35:39] not meat for me to give the children's
[35:40] bread to a dog you know but in her heart
[35:44] right and and just as in our bodies we
[35:47] have this natural this innate belief in
[35:50] us to know that no matter what the Sun
[35:52] what the clouds look like what the night
[35:54] looks like the sun is still going to
[35:56] rise she had something in the spiritual
[35:58] level saying hold on a second no no no
[36:00] no no I still believe the Sun is going
[36:02] to rise on my situation right and she
[36:04] agreed with the word even in her
[36:06] situation and God said you said the
[36:09] right exact thing now I can touch you
[36:12] now I can bless her situation so you see
[36:14] God loves to test and God loves to test
[36:17] and test and test and test right just so
[36:20] we can say the right things is not to
[36:23] hurt us right because if it um you have
[36:26] to realize that a lot of people go
[36:28] through life and they pray and God
[36:30] doesn't answer not one prayer God
[36:32] doesn't speak to them not one God even
[36:34] said himself uh uh when he was on Earth
[36:37] that when he gave Parables it was to
[36:39] blind people right so you have to
[36:41] understand that God some God doesn't
[36:43] speak to some people but for us when he
[36:46] speaks to us he speaks to us through
[36:48] test so that we meet the word test and
[36:51] say the right thing right and be appear
[36:54] worthy before him right so he wants to
[36:58] see our reactions while we're going
[37:00] through the appointment right uh because
[37:04] um you know what because here's the
[37:08] thing about it when you've received
[37:10] something when you received an
[37:11] appointment from God or you've received
[37:13] something from God do you know what God
[37:15] does after that he tests you
[37:18] again
[37:20] right he test you again after youve
[37:22] prayed for and after you receive what
[37:25] you've gotten he just throws on another
[37:27] test right and the test that you go
[37:31] through this time is greater than the
[37:33] one you went through before all right
[37:36] it's levels to these things right it's
[37:38] always levels to these things and the
[37:40] test before the test after you've come
[37:42] through another one will always be
[37:44] greater uh than the one that you uh that
[37:46] you uh faced before right so um and
[37:50] that's how you know we we look at
[37:52] Abraham who received the promised son
[37:55] right and uh he had his appointment he
[37:58] had to wait 25 years in order to receive
[38:01] his son and the Bible says he ain't get
[38:04] nothing but stronger and stronger and
[38:05] stronger and stronger right now in
[38:07] Genesis
[38:09] 22 uh and we're going to read through uh
[38:12] I'm I'll just read through verse one and
[38:13] two while you turn it says and it came
[38:16] to pass after these things that God did
[38:19] tempt Abraham now I I believe that tempt
[38:22] is I don't I believe that tempt mean he
[38:24] was trying to test Abraham right he was
[38:27] trying test Abraham and it's a weird
[38:29] thing
[38:30] because Abraham just spent 25 years
[38:34] showing he believe
[38:36] God that should have been enough for God
[38:39] but there's always a there's always
[38:42] another level of Faith there's always a
[38:44] deeper experience that you can have with
[38:46] God and maybe even Abraham thought that
[38:49] 25 years was just enough that he went
[38:52] through in order to get his son right
[38:55] and it says that God did tempt Abraham
[38:57] and said unto him Abraham and he said
[38:59] behold here I am and verse two he says
[39:02] and he said take thy son and just see
[39:05] how look at how God says this thing take
[39:08] thy son thy only son whom thou lovest
[39:13] can you imagine after you've waited 25
[39:16] years for God to give you something and
[39:18] he did it in such a miraculous um such a
[39:21] miraculous way and you've and I believe
[39:24] uh uh he was a he was a boy now right so
[39:27] AB Abraham spent birthdays he spent uh
[39:30] they they uh they work together they
[39:32] travel together they had so many
[39:34] experience uh God knew that he loved
[39:37] them right and then and then just this
[39:39] one morning the spirit just wakes him up
[39:42] and says hey take thy son thy only son
[39:45] thy only son Isaac whom thou lovest and
[39:47] give thee into the land of Mariah offer
[39:50] him there for burnt offering upon one of
[39:53] the mountains which I tell of thee can
[39:56] you imagine how Abraham now feels all
[39:59] right can you imagine what he's the
[40:03] thoughts that are going through his head
[40:04] cuz he's still obeyed God right he still
[40:07] obeyed God but he had this innate belief
[40:10] within the spiritual realm that says I
[40:11] know the sun can rise again and the
[40:14] prophet said that Abraham was able to go
[40:17] out with that request because he knew
[40:19] that if God gave him the son he could
[40:21] cause him to rise again right but he
[40:25] wanted but but God but God wanted to get
[40:28] something out of Abraham because when
[40:30] they came up to the mountain and Abraham
[40:31] was ready to sacrifice his only son God
[40:34] sent the angel down and said hold on a
[40:35] second now I know you love me you see
[40:38] God's always looking to see inside of
[40:41] our hearts a deeper walk we can get with
[40:44] him see it's not our job to decide when
[40:47] we're ready it's not our job to decide
[40:49] our appointments you know when you're
[40:51] going through a trial you're like okay
[40:53] Lord I've been going through this for 2
[40:54] months now I think it's ready now oh no
[40:57] no no no no no no no God sees something
[41:02] that you don't see right God sees a
[41:05] deeper walk with him a deeper love for
[41:07] him and he's trying to get investment on
[41:10] that right he's trying to prove that his
[41:12] word is true all right um the waiting
[41:17] also what it does uh there's another
[41:19] piece of this thing is the waiting is
[41:21] not just to try you as well but it's
[41:24] also to show the faithfulness of God of
[41:27] his word to you and that it has nothing
[41:30] to do with you right the rising of the
[41:33] sun has nothing to do uh uh with us it's
[41:36] not our job to go out in space and hop
[41:39] on a spaceship and go out in space and
[41:41] you know uh try to uh cowboy tie the Sun
[41:45] and pull it up right it's not our job to
[41:47] do that it's our job just to trust that
[41:49] hey when the Sun rises it'll rise in the
[41:52] time that it's supposed to do and when
[41:53] it rises I'm going get up and
[41:55] something's going to happen right right
[41:57] so it's it's uh uh God also wants to
[42:00] show his faithfulness to you because a
[42:02] couple of things happened when Abraham
[42:04] had promised his uh son to Isaac one
[42:08] Abraham laughed at it right and then uh
[42:12] uh further down the road uh I believe
[42:15] that um and brother Jack has actually
[42:17] preached about this thing um brother
[42:20] Jack said that you know when um Abraham
[42:23] and uh Sarah God had changed their
[42:25] bodies back to Young they were still old
[42:27] but it gave them a body change it came
[42:29] before The King and Abraham lied to the
[42:32] king saying oh no no no just just tell
[42:34] him that you're my uh tell him that
[42:35] you're my sister because he going to
[42:37] kill me because I know he wants to marry
[42:38] you right and uh Abraham should have had
[42:42] faith that hold on a second I have a kid
[42:44] coming out of you so this situation has
[42:47] got to turn around I don't know what's
[42:49] going to happen I can't just give you up
[42:50] like that right and then also it came to
[42:53] the time where Sarah um also um tried to
[42:58] uh uh Sarah tried to set a a premature
[43:02] appointment right and giving Hagar a
[43:05] believe the manservant to Abraham that
[43:06] says okay Abraham you just go with her
[43:08] and then produce a son that'll be our
[43:10] son so she tried to uh uh um make the
[43:14] appointment to stop the appointment at a
[43:16] premature date right and all of this is
[43:19] just to show our type and how that the
[43:22] sun just sets still it's us that moves
[43:25] around and turns
[43:27] night and day and storming and up and
[43:30] down and frustrated and you know oh man
[43:33] I don't want to serve God I don't want I
[43:35] I don't believe God no more no I just
[43:37] want to walk off and do this thing or or
[43:39] God you ain't working fast enough maybe
[43:40] I need to do this thing it's to show
[43:42] that that's us kind of going around but
[43:44] the word like the sun is just setting in
[43:47] the middle just shining just as much as
[43:50] the truth right and in order to
[43:52] experience faithfulness you got to be
[43:56] unfaithful there has to be a there has
[43:58] well it's not a purposely being
[44:00] unfaithful but there's a weakness in you
[44:03] that has to be that that gets exploited
[44:06] because when we're Unfaithful it's our
[44:09] own choice you got to realize that God
[44:11] ain't causing you to be unfaithful no
[44:14] when God the spirit came into the body
[44:16] Jesus Christ he kept the word he went
[44:18] exactly through what uh me and you and I
[44:21] went through he went through sickness he
[44:22] went through heartache he went through
[44:24] portrayal he went through tough times he
[44:27] went through confusion and he always
[44:29] kept the word every single uh second
[44:31] every single Temptation the Bible says
[44:33] he was Secure so he could help those
[44:34] that are secur showing that he is worthy
[44:37] to be ahead which is someone to make
[44:40] decisions he was worthy to be someone to
[44:42] make decisions right and to show and
[44:46] it's also to show that uh uh the
[44:48] faithfulness of his word because I like
[44:50] how it said in uh uh um in
[44:53] Genesis um give me one second while I
[44:56] turn to it
[44:57] uh in Genesis 21 and and the Lord has
[45:01] said when the Lord had visited Sarah he
[45:02] said the Lord said to Sarah he said um
[45:05] and the Lord visited Sarah as he had
[45:06] said he said he was going to visit Sarah
[45:09] no matter through what Sarah did cuz one
[45:12] she laughed right she when God spoke the
[45:14] word she laughed right there and God
[45:17] could have took her out but because she
[45:19] was tied to a head someone that believed
[45:22] God was like I can't touch you without
[45:24] touching that and that is our privilege
[45:27] in Christ am you have to realize that
[45:30] God can't do nothing to us now you got
[45:32] to be careful don't don't just go out
[45:34] there doing whatever you want to do now
[45:36] right because you going to pay for it
[45:38] but God can't touch us without touching
[45:40] Christ you have to realize that God
[45:42] cannot touch you without first touching
[45:44] Christ right so it says and the Lord
[45:47] visited Sarah as he said and the Lord
[45:48] did unto Sarah as he had spoken so this
[45:51] is something that he said he would do
[45:53] even though she laughed even though she
[45:55] tried to bring about a son
[45:58] uh another son which that son that she
[45:59] brought about called so many issues for
[46:02] them in the future and to the point that
[46:04] they're still dealing with those issues
[46:07] right to this day with ishmail and his
[46:09] children right it's the same exact
[46:11] decision that Eve did the that one
[46:13] decision that Eve made affected Humanity
[46:16] for so long and that one decision that
[46:18] Sarah made has still affected Humanity
[46:20] right now right it says for for Sarah
[46:24] conceived and bear Abraham a son in his
[46:26] old age at the set time of which God had
[46:29] spoken to him right at the set time at
[46:32] which God had spoken to him God had a
[46:35] time in his mind when he wanted this
[46:37] thing to happen right and when Sarah
[46:39] tried to rush that process it didn't
[46:41] change the time right and a lot of times
[46:45] you know when we go through our troubles
[46:47] when we go through our our our battles
[46:50] and we feel that our faith is shaken
[46:51] sometime you know uh it sickness when
[46:54] you're really really sick and I'm
[46:57] talking about really really really
[46:58] really sick it will try your faith um
[47:02] it's a faith isn't something that is a
[47:04] um uh um uh an expression or an emotion
[47:09] they say faith is a sword it's something
[47:11] you fight with right it's not something
[47:13] that you're you're using to uh be happy
[47:15] all the time it's something you're using
[47:17] to slice things away to stand on the
[47:19] word of God I remember one time I had
[47:22] caught the stomach bug and it put me on
[47:24] my back for some days and I'm telling
[47:27] you right now and and in your mind you
[47:30] know God can heal you right then and
[47:31] there right and so it's tough to think
[47:34] about these things while you're sitting
[47:36] there and you're struggling and you're
[47:37] and you're going through and it's like
[47:38] Lord I know you're here and you can do
[47:40] something about it and then and and and
[47:43] I believe it's in those moments is well
[47:45] what do you think about it what do you
[47:46] still think about me right and it's
[47:48] those moments that God is trying to test
[47:51] because God loves to receive worship
[47:54] when you're really really really going
[47:55] through things I believe that's when God
[47:57] really really really is uh uh uh gets
[48:00] gets gets Glory out of uh uh out of
[48:03] worship when you're really struggling
[48:06] right you know what God can do you know
[48:08] what he's done in your life you know how
[48:10] fast he can act but you're going through
[48:12] a trial right and you're still having to
[48:15] worship him you're still having to uh uh
[48:16] uh um give him praise right so um when
[48:20] you're wanting to receive something from
[48:22] God the first thing that you have to
[48:24] realize is if God has said something
[48:27] it's already done that has to be the
[48:30] Genesis that has to be the uh uh that
[48:32] has to be your foundation that has to be
[48:34] everything that you hold dear to one
[48:36] that God has said it it's already done
[48:39] right it's already there uh uh no uh you
[48:42] don't need to figure out how to get to
[48:44] it you don't need to figure out how to
[48:45] uh uh how it's going to happen you don't
[48:47] need to uh you don't need to trust in
[48:49] feelings and what your feelings saying
[48:51] all those things no God said this thing
[48:53] is going to happen and it's going to
[48:54] happen what do you want to get the holy
[48:56] SP whether you want healing whether you
[48:58] want Deliverance whether you want a job
[49:00] or anything if you have Wayward kids um
[49:03] you can't look at what happens in
[49:05] between because just like that situation
[49:08] when God came to Sarah and promised
[49:10] Sarah that she would receive the son a
[49:12] lot of stuff happened in between a lot
[49:15] of stuff happened in between that wasn't
[49:17] uh uh NE necessarily uh giving God the
[49:20] glory with Abraham lying and uh Sarah
[49:23] kind of uh Sarah doubting the word of
[49:25] God and La you can't look at what
[49:27] happens in between because a lot of
[49:28] times when we ask God for something and
[49:31] then we're expecting it to happen we're
[49:33] thinking about nothing is going to
[49:35] happen in between we're not really
[49:36] thinking about what can happen in
[49:37] between right but you have to realize
[49:40] that when you pray for that wayward
[49:43] child it could get worse and the prophet
[49:46] even said that he said sometimes when
[49:49] you prayed for and God gives you the
[49:51] word things get
[49:53] worse true things get worse
[49:57] things get worse and that's opposite to
[49:59] how we think when things should happen
[50:02] so for example that with that situation
[50:04] with the garage when he says hey I'm
[50:06] going to fix the garage you're expecting
[50:08] this thing to go by with no problems and
[50:10] no issues and just it's going to work
[50:12] again but the prophet says that when you
[50:15] get prayed for and God says you're
[50:16] healed or promis you to something things
[50:18] can get a lot worse and it's in those
[50:21] moments that we have to always look back
[50:25] at what he said right and it's and it's
[50:27] a beautiful thing that we can we can
[50:30] look at the sun uh uh uh as an example
[50:33] and you know we can think about Job um
[50:36] you know when job was going through his
[50:38] situation right when job was going
[50:40] through his trial um and he was a um
[50:46] friends forsake friends didn't believe
[50:48] him uh uh wife forsook him right no more
[50:52] resources um I I and he had and he had
[50:56] the stars as a Bible I wonder if he ever
[50:59] took a look at the rising of the Sun the
[51:01] rising and the setting of the sun right
[51:03] but the thing about uh uh the rising and
[51:05] the setting of the sun is you have to
[51:07] wait for the sun to rise to shine on you
[51:10] God has to give you the Revelation that
[51:12] something's going to happen right it
[51:14] can't be somebody else give you the
[51:15] revelation God has to give you your own
[51:18] personal revelation and when Jo caught
[51:21] that Revelation that my redeemer liveth
[51:23] there was nothing that could take him
[51:26] out of that trial there's nothing that
[51:28] could shake him out of that trial when
[51:30] God revealed to him personally you're
[51:32] going to come out of this thing job said
[51:34] I know for a fact my redeemer liveth
[51:38] right right so you can claim hold you
[51:40] can lay hold of those claims and I want
[51:43] you to realize that while you're going
[51:45] through the testing while you're going
[51:46] through the trials while you're going
[51:47] through the waiting God's trying to
[51:49] build something else up inside of you
[51:51] God is trying to build Roots because a
[51:54] lot of times you know we want something
[51:56] we want a blessing right but it's
[51:59] there's more levels to God the world
[52:02] just wants things they want riches they
[52:03] want money they want good jobs they want
[52:05] families but there's more to stuff that
[52:08] we don't see as uh uh as uh uh as men uh
[52:12] living in the earth God doesn't want you
[52:14] just to have a blessing he wants you to
[52:16] be able to keep a blessing all right and
[52:19] that's another part of the equation that
[52:20] people don't realize is that when you
[52:23] receive something can you keep it and
[52:27] can you still be the same you when you
[52:29] receive it right oh people want to be
[52:33] healed but what are you going to do
[52:34] after you get healed am right while
[52:37] you're sitting there uh crying on the on
[52:40] a bed of Affliction I mean you're in
[52:41] pain I mean you're you're you're really
[52:43] really going through and you're saying
[52:45] God touch me and God says if I touch you
[52:47] what you going to do after this if
[52:48] you're just going to go back into the
[52:50] world you know you treat God like some
[52:52] kind of entertainment or something like
[52:54] that where he just heals you you just go
[52:55] do what you want
[52:57] right so um when you're going through a
[52:59] situation when you're waiting God is
[53:01] building Roots inside of you so that
[53:04] when you've gotten what you've received
[53:06] you can keep it right so you know in the
[53:08] waiting for a church you know there are
[53:10] a lot of problems that come with having
[53:12] a big
[53:13] church there's a lot of problems that we
[53:16] don't see and we can't conceive about we
[53:18] don't know what to uh what what what's
[53:21] going to come with it because if let's
[53:23] say God blesses us with a 200 member
[53:25] church or 300 member church right what
[53:28] comes with that that's right right it's
[53:30] not just coming to church and sitting
[53:32] down and just hearing a message and uh
[53:35] seeing this seeing uh uh same seeing the
[53:38] same fa that we always seen no it's more
[53:40] levels to this thing cuz now you're
[53:43] attracting different kind of spirits and
[53:45] all that kind of stuff and God in you're
[53:47] waiting God wants to root you down so
[53:49] that when you come to that thing you
[53:51] ain't changing right things don't change
[53:54] you're still spirit and truth right
[53:56] you're still telling the truth of the
[53:58] spirit of God right so God wants to
[54:02] build those roots down inside you so
[54:04] that when you get that job or that
[54:06] promotion right because when you get a
[54:08] promotion there's a lot of stuff that
[54:09] comes with it I want to tell you I want
[54:11] to tell you right now that job God gave
[54:14] job a double blessing and it was a
[54:16] beautiful blessing but I guarantee you
[54:18] it came with more troubles and the only
[54:21] reason I can say that is because
[54:23] ecclesiastics said there's a time and
[54:24] season for everything as long as we're
[54:27] on this wor and as long as God gives you
[54:29] something you going to have ups and
[54:30] downs when Sarah and uh um Sarah and um
[54:34] Abraham received Isaac Isaac made Isaac
[54:37] got on their nerves
[54:39] sometimes
[54:41] right hey you know you're going to go
[54:43] through some and when God gives you a
[54:45] job you're going to go through some when
[54:47] God gives you a promotion to get more
[54:48] money you're you're going to go through
[54:51] things that were even you're going to go
[54:53] through more harder tests than what you
[54:54] had felt before and so what God likes to
[54:57] do is before he gives you something
[54:59] because when God puts his name on to
[55:01] something it's got to be smooth it's got
[55:04] to be firm it's got to be settled it's
[55:07] got to be just like the sun in the
[55:08] middle of the of the uh of the universe
[55:10] not moving but just shining all the time
[55:13] right when he puts his name on something
[55:15] so he's got to root you first before
[55:18] giving you the blessing and so in the
[55:20] waiting in the trying times and in the
[55:23] tribulation God's trying to mold you to
[55:26] be worthy to hold this blessing or else
[55:28] we'd all be like the prodal son the
[55:30] prodical son uh uh which is an example
[55:32] God has given us the prodical son had a
[55:35] blessing with no
[55:36] roots and when he took that b and when
[55:38] he took that blessing and left his
[55:40] father's house he squandered it right
[55:44] next thing you know he's inside of a pig
[55:45] pin right eating brother Jack he's a uh
[55:50] with pork and Jews didn't even believe
[55:52] in pigs they thought that they were
[55:54] Unholy things and now he's in the midst
[55:55] of this pig
[55:57] right uh uh in a situation that was
[55:59] opposite of what he came from right
[56:02] because he had a blessing but he didn't
[56:04] have roots with it right and God's a
[56:06] good father and when God because a lot
[56:08] of times you know you'll see people on
[56:10] social media you'll see a lot of kids
[56:12] that have wealthy parents and they'll
[56:13] you know give them nice cards and
[56:15] they'll give them nice things but they
[56:16] don't really understand what it took to
[56:19] get that stuff and to keep those things
[56:21] and so they look at it as if it's
[56:23] something uh of little value because
[56:26] there was no work that they had to put
[56:28] in to receive it God is the exact
[56:30] opposite right and and and that's why
[56:33] cuz a lot of times when God said I'll
[56:35] when God told the Israelites I'll send
[56:38] you a king right Jesus Christ was that
[56:41] King Jesus Christ was that deliverer but
[56:44] he was born in a manger God wanted to
[56:47] make sure that before he gave Christ
[56:49] that seat in heaven that he had roots to
[56:51] go with that blessing so God Christ was
[56:53] born in a major right he rose up as a k
[56:56] he rose up he was a kid he was a
[56:57] carpenter he did humble work he was
[56:59] tried he was tempted he was tested right
[57:02] even on the day when he went walked
[57:03] through calary they spit on him and uh
[57:06] uh they whipped him and uh the prophet
[57:08] says he didn't say nothing back he
[57:11] didn't say nothing back and he had all
[57:13] power in his hands to turn the situation
[57:15] around but he didn't say nothing back
[57:17] because he knew that Roots were being
[57:20] built below him so that when God raised
[57:22] him up into the position of King and all
[57:25] power in his hand he can trust his
[57:28] judgments and when God wants to put you
[57:30] into a situation you know bless us with
[57:32] a bigger Church bless us with a job he
[57:34] wants to be able to trust the judgments
[57:36] we make when stuff happens and you have
[57:38] to realize that judgments uh judgments
[57:42] don't happen when things are always good
[57:44] judgment happens when emotions are
[57:46] flying high all right and can try to
[57:48] shake you and try to move you but when
[57:50] you've been tried and fired when you've
[57:52] been staying with the word you've been
[57:54] rooted down when something comes across
[57:56] cross you you can say no no no no no
[57:57] we're staying with the word right we're
[58:00] staying with the word whether 150 people
[58:02] leave our church or not and we're just
[58:04] in a big building with us what we had
[58:06] before we're going to stay with the
[58:09] word right we're going to stay with the
[58:12] word you know we get our healing right
[58:14] and uh God heals our body we've been
[58:16] stressing we've been growing and some
[58:17] people you know deal with uh uh
[58:19] diabeties and all these things you know
[58:22] Lord if you heal me even after you heal
[58:24] me I'm going to stay with the word I'm
[58:25] going to going to stay serving you I'm
[58:27] not going to use this time where I was
[58:30] once in pain to just go back to just
[58:32] living in the world no I'm going to come
[58:34] and serve you I'm going to come to your
[58:36] house when Hannah made that prayer and
[58:38] said Lord when if you give me this kid
[58:40] I'm going to raise him to serve you
[58:43] right God said you said the exact thing
[58:45] that I wanted to hear and gave her a son
[58:47] that did a mighty work right so God is
[58:50] looking to make Roots inside of us so
[58:53] that when we get that promotion and that
[58:55] next step that next level in our life
[58:58] it's it glorifies him because God is a
[59:01] God that uh people don't
[59:02] realize God is a God that doesn't always
[59:05] want to just kind of control you around
[59:07] and just move you around and force you
[59:08] around God wants to trust you God wants
[59:11] to say hey man if I just walk push you
[59:13] out that way I trust you're going to
[59:15] make the right choices and if I just
[59:17] send you off this way I trust that
[59:18] you're going to make the right choices
[59:20] the prophet one time he was he was going
[59:22] to heal somebody he said I'm waiting on
[59:24] what the Lord's going to say and angel
[59:26] came back said I'm looking to see what
[59:27] you going to do right so God wants to
[59:30] build that confidence in us that he can
[59:32] just send us right off and we'll make
[59:34] the right choices but we first have to
[59:36] be rooted in him and in closing um it's
[59:41] it's it's it's the love of God that does
[59:44] this for us because the whole theme of
[59:45] this year has been restoration and when
[59:49] God created Adam in the beginning of the
[59:51] garden he trusted him he didn't have to
[59:54] put Adam through trials you have to
[59:56] realized that Adam wasn't born by sexual
[59:58] means that we are born which is a
[1:00:00] weakness which is something that God had
[1:00:02] to purify us from but Adam was a direct
[1:00:04] spoken word of God and God had
[1:00:07] confidence in Adam to make the right
[1:00:09] choices even when he fell he still made
[1:00:13] the good choice of deciding not to put
[1:00:15] his wife away and that was a type of
[1:00:17] Christ of taking on Eve sin and Christ
[1:00:20] taking on our sin he still made a good
[1:00:23] choice right and God is looking for us
[1:00:26] that when he elevates us to the next
[1:00:28] level no matter the pressures of life no
[1:00:30] matter what uh um no matter what the
[1:00:33] next level brings the the uh the
[1:00:35] stresses the uh because it's these these
[1:00:39] stresses in life are serious you have
[1:00:41] people living on the street that don't
[1:00:43] even know who they are strung out on
[1:00:46] drugs right and I'm I'm here to tell you
[1:00:49] they were once just like
[1:00:51] you they were once just like you they
[1:00:53] once had a right mind they once knew
[1:00:56] knew left from right they once knew how
[1:00:57] to get a job they once knew how to
[1:00:59] function in society they once had a
[1:01:01] father a mother a sister but somewhere
[1:01:04] along the way the stresses and the toils
[1:01:06] of life just put them down into a
[1:01:08] position to now they're a prodal son
[1:01:10] don't even know who they are don't even
[1:01:12] know where they came from and living
[1:01:14] like that day after day after day after
[1:01:16] day after day no God wants us to be
[1:01:18] strengthened God wants us to be rooted
[1:01:21] so even if we were to be in a position
[1:01:23] where we were like that we'd still be
[1:01:24] giving him glory we'd still know our
[1:01:26] identity we'd still be giving him praise
[1:01:29] right and that builds Roots right so
[1:01:32] we're going to say a prayer a closing
[1:01:35] prayer Lord Jesus we thank you for your
[1:01:37] word oh Lord God Lord God we know oh
[1:01:41] Lord God that you're the infallible God
[1:01:42] lord there's nothing too hard for you oh
[1:01:45] Lord God lord we know Lord God that you
[1:01:47] can come on the scene oh Lord God and
[1:01:49] change things around in a second oh Lord
[1:01:51] God we know oh Lord God that that power
[1:01:54] belongs to you and you only
[1:01:56] but Lord sometimes you want us to wait
[1:01:59] Lord sometimes you want us just to set
[1:02:01] still Lord God and go through the trials
[1:02:03] and the and and the tribulations oh Lord
[1:02:05] God so it'll purify us oh Lord God it'll
[1:02:08] make us worthy in your sight oh Lord God
[1:02:10] so that when you take us up to the next
[1:02:13] level oh Lord Jesus Christ we're we're
[1:02:15] pleasing to you oh Lord God the
[1:02:17] decisions we make we're pleasing to you
[1:02:19] because it'll there'll be situations
[1:02:21] where you know if we get that promotion
[1:02:23] you know somewhere else high up will
[1:02:25] want us to come compromise on the job oh
[1:02:27] Lord God and if we haven't been rooted
[1:02:29] in you Lord we would fall oh Lord Jesus
[1:02:31] Christ but Lord you're trying to get out
[1:02:33] all that unbelief and the doubt oh Lord
[1:02:35] Jesus Christ so that when we get to the
[1:02:37] next level oh Lord God if it comes
[1:02:39] between your word and the word we choose
[1:02:42] your word and not the world oh Lord
[1:02:44] Jesus Christ to please you oh Lord God
[1:02:46] to make sure everything that we're doing
[1:02:48] in our life is pleasing unto you oh Lord
[1:02:50] God Lord we thank you for the word oh
[1:02:52] Lord God lord many are out there with
[1:02:54] different situations oh Lord God lord
[1:02:57] you never promise that you'd give us the
[1:02:59] time or when it would be over oh Lord
[1:03:01] but you promise that you'd always be
[1:03:02] with us oh Lord so Lord I pray over them
[1:03:04] oh Lord Jesus Christ Let Your Presence
[1:03:07] be known to them oh Lord God Let Your
[1:03:09] Presence always be knowing oh Lord God
[1:03:11] that you're with them and that you're
[1:03:12] going through the trial with them oh
[1:03:14] Lord God let that be the the at the
[1:03:16] center of their souls oh Lord God to
[1:03:18] know you're with them oh Lord God and
[1:03:20] that's enough oh Lord Jesus Christ Lord
[1:03:23] we we bless this meeting oh Lord God we
[1:03:25] pray pray for the saints that are um in
[1:03:27] London oh Lord God May the services be
[1:03:29] fruitful oh Lord God and you bring them
[1:03:31] back safely Lord and we ask this in the
[1:03:33] precious name of Jesus Christ
[1:03:36] [Applause]
[1:03:47] amen amen amen praise the
[1:03:51] Lord such a wonderful edifying message
[1:03:55] amen I just found it just so I don't
[1:03:57] know if he planned it that way but you
[1:04:00] know the prophet preached a message
[1:04:02] rising of the sun and it was an Easter
[1:04:05] message amen so we're just getting our
[1:04:07] Easter getting ready for Easter brother
[1:04:10] Quin just preaching there about the
[1:04:12] rising of the Sun and uh the different
[1:04:15] changes and the dark times that you go
[1:04:17] through in your life you know and the
[1:04:19] prophet was talking about there and that
[1:04:20] message that very Mage is the rising of
[1:04:22] the Sun that uh the first time that the
[1:04:25] Sun
[1:04:26] rose up on the earth amen it was uh uh
[1:04:30] uh there in Genesis when he said let
[1:04:32] there be light amen he didn't know we
[1:04:35] didn't know how long we were seeds
[1:04:37] laying there in the in the ground in
[1:04:39] that dark place he said it was a gloomy
[1:04:41] time amen laying there in darkness but
[1:04:44] it was the rising of the Sun that woke
[1:04:47] us up and quickened us into into life
[1:04:50] amen uh just see how uh like he was
[1:04:54] saying some of us work at night
[1:04:56] some of us got to go to work
[1:04:59] tonight amen but I thank God that
[1:05:03] my maybe my body has to go to work at
[1:05:06] night but it's a deeper Revelation amen
[1:05:09] that it's the rising of the sun and the
[1:05:11] revelation of this hour amen that has
[1:05:13] woken me out of the darkness amen and
[1:05:16] quickened me to a a life of immortality
[1:05:19] amen beyond the mortality that we see
[1:05:22] amen that has taken us to another place
[1:05:24] of Revelation amen taking us out of the
[1:05:26] Dark Places of the world Amen and giving
[1:05:28] us that Faith amen that no matter what
[1:05:31] we go through we understand and we
[1:05:33] realize amen that God is still in
[1:05:35] control amen that the trials uh uh that
[1:05:38] we go through are just there to make us
[1:05:40] stronger amen and one of the most
[1:05:42] profound things he said he talked about
[1:05:44] how uh uh it's preparing us for the next
[1:05:47] level amen the trials and the
[1:05:50] tribulations some of the things that
[1:05:51] we're going through just to prepare us
[1:05:53] for the next level I had been saying for

[1:12:26] about anything else other than hey how
[1:12:27] you doing have a blessed day that's it
[1:12:30] but I just I just want to share that
[1:12:31] testimony God bless
[1:12:35] yall
[1:12:38] amen you know when our pth we never know
[1:12:41] why the Lord has Us in certain places
[1:12:45] you know uh so I just you know me
[1:12:48] personally I just try to be a light
[1:12:49] wherever I go and I always keep that in
[1:12:52] mind that I'm here uh uh maybe there's a
[1:12:56] reason for me to be here maybe somebody
[1:12:59] you know um may need to
[1:13:02] know more a longing more of more of God
[1:13:08] Amen and you know we we here uh uh we
[1:13:13] have the
[1:13:14] more you know um there's many
[1:13:19] denominations you know and people alleg
[1:13:22] some may say well you just just believe
[1:13:25] and others will tell you will uh uh uh
[1:13:28] confess your sins and and all of that is
[1:13:31] true but where do you go from there amen
[1:13:35] they just say well come I'm going tell
[1:13:37] you to come up to the church and uh uh
[1:13:40] right-handed Fellowship shake the uh uh
[1:13:42] the pastor's hand and and you got it
[1:13:45] somehow you come up and some believe
[1:13:47] being saved is just joining the
[1:13:51] church but where do you go from there
[1:13:56] what what next what's after this and
[1:14:01] people are at that place that stalemate
[1:14:03] looking for more looking for more of God
[1:14:07] and to be quite honest with you it's
[1:14:09] only those in the message that can give
[1:14:11] that guidance and that truth that there
[1:14:13] is more that there is more so we we are
[1:14:17] certainly a a very special people on the
[1:14:20] Earth many don't realize it I don't
[1:14:23] force the message down nobody throat I
