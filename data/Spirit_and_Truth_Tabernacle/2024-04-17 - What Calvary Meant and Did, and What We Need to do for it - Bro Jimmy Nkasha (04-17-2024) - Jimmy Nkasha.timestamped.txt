[16:58] sistern birthday so we had a good time
[17:01] together amen good to see you uh sisters
[17:05] amen uh we're going to read from the
[17:07] book of Matthew
[17:11] 27 I'm trying to combine things uh the
[17:16] the the message I want to preach is is
[17:18] like three things in one so let's see
[17:23] what it
[17:27] does hey
[17:29] things sometimes go wrong sister Hannah
[17:31] you have to do what you do what you do
[17:34] my laptop is refusing to open Matthew 27
[17:37] uh uh let's go B basically to paragraph
[17:42] uh uh um verse 50 I think uh cuz cuz
[17:47] it's refusing to open but uh we we'll
[17:49] get it
[17:51] opened it's a devil fighting how can a
[17:54] laptop refuse to
[17:57] open okay
[18:00] Matthew 27 let's look at verse 50 what
[18:03] does it say and Jesus when he had cried
[18:07] again with a loud voice yielded up The
[18:10] Ghost and behold the veil of the temple
[18:12] was rained in Twain from top to bottom
[18:15] and the Earth did quake and the Rocks
[18:18] rent and the graves were opened and many
[18:21] bodies of the Saints which slept arose
[18:25] and came out of the Grave after his
[18:27] resurrection and went into the holy city
[18:30] and appeared unto many now when the
[18:32] Centurion and they that were with him
[18:35] watching Jesus saw the earthquake and
[18:38] those things that were done they feared
[18:41] greatly saying truly this was the son of
[18:44] God Amen uh while we standing let us
[18:48] also read uh uh Romans
[18:54] 12 verse one so I'm I'm going to combine
[18:57] things because I only have today so I
[18:59] have to be very fast you'll bear with me
[19:02] I have to be to be
[19:06] cruising cuz for for for uh bra Jin
[19:10] we'll do three series of the same things
[19:12] so I'll compact them now uh uh sorry I
[19:17] was reading Corinthians it's Romans 12
[19:19] yes I beseech you Brethren by the
[19:23] mercies of God that you present your
[19:25] bodies as a Living Sacrifice holy
[19:28] acceptable unto God which is your
[19:31] reasonable service amen we may be seated
[19:34] while I
[19:35] pray Heavenly Father we've read the
[19:39] scriptures may you help us in the little
[19:41] time that we have to break the bread of
[19:44] life that it will help us to be better
[19:47] in the name of Jesus Christ we pray
[19:51] amen oh this thing is still
[19:55] misbehaving okay then I have to switch
[19:57] it off then switch it on
[20:00] okay
[20:01] so when I came into us we were launching
[20:08] our 45 days of uh Covenant prayer of
[20:15] dedication
[20:17] so uh this year I was telling them at
[20:20] brain this year in our church we started
[20:24] Covenant programs I think the theme of
[20:26] the year we put it we said we're going
[20:28] to call it making achievements through
[20:33] Covenant
[20:34] prayers yeah so um I learned to I
[20:38] learned that these prayers that we pray
[20:41] sometimes today you pray tomorrow you
[20:43] don't all right they they they're not
[20:46] very
[20:47] effective uh the scripture says uh in uh
[20:51] Hebrews I think 11 verse 6 it says uh
[20:55] they that come to God must know that he
[20:57] is and a rewarder of them that
[21:02] diligently seek
[21:04] him where we fail usually is we do seek
[21:07] him but we don't seek Him
[21:10] diligently so so when you make covenant
[21:13] programs you find that it automatically
[21:16] makes you diligent yes for example look
[21:19] at Daniel I think it's chapter 10 the
[21:22] Bible says he he he started praying and
[21:26] uh uh G him himself to pray for 21 uh
[21:30] for three full weeks he actually says
[21:33] three full weeks there's a word full
[21:36] there every day of those three three
[21:38] weeks every day he was praying amen so
[21:42] you find he made a covenant he made a
[21:45] plan he he made uh uh an agreement with
[21:49] God and himself so automatically he had
[21:52] to honor his part and as long as he
[21:54] honors his part God will also honor his
[21:57] part sometimes the scripture also says
[21:59] when two people agree as touching
[22:01] anything here on Earth it shall be done
[22:03] in heaven so you can agree to say me and
[22:06] my husband we're going to pray three
[22:08] days we'll fast for the pastor for the
[22:10] anointing for the church you will see
[22:13] more Effectiveness in such kind of
[22:15] prayers amen so I just thought of
[22:17] sharing this with you the day we we
[22:19] started our prayer that's Wednesday when
[22:21] I just landed in US my first night in us
[22:24] we started we were launching our 45 days
[22:27] of Prayer
[22:29] dedication of ourselves and uh before
[22:32] that from January to beginning April we
[22:35] had 90 days of uh repentance every
[22:39] household should have picked one hour
[22:41] from uh uh uh 8 9 p.m. or uh no no no no
[22:46] what was that yeah 8:00 p.m. to 6: a.m.
[22:49] the following day each household should
[22:51] pick one hour to pray and then we we
[22:53] were praying
[22:55] repentance worship warfare prayer
[22:58] request
[22:59] every 1 hour every day for 90 days so
[23:03] after that uh so we even created a group
[23:06] which we're going prayer relay so when
[23:08] you finish when you start you post TK
[23:11] start starting in in the group and when
[23:14] you finish you say done another one says
[23:16] starting another one says done all the
[23:19] way up to the morning amen I believe uh
[23:22] such kind of prayers as the bride of
[23:24] Christ will achieve more Glory so let's
[23:28] consider that that night when we we did
[23:31] when I did that the first night when we
[23:33] were launching the the prayer dedication
[23:36] in that night I had a dream I dreamed an
[23:39] angel appeared to me in the dream and I
[23:43] was asking him questions uh and and one
[23:46] of the things that I asked him was what
[23:47] am I supposed to do I was trying to do
[23:50] something then he told me don't do that
[23:52] that's not your area your job is to
[23:54] encourage the children of God Amen so
[23:59] I'm here to encourage you uh in the
[24:02] faith so that you are EMB bettered amen
[24:05] praise God Amen uh and I'm seeing the
[24:08] grace of God that way uh sometimes when
[24:11] you are so much in prayer God is close
[24:13] you can hear God speak uh I usually hear
[24:16] testimonies from Sister Hannah she would
[24:18] tell me maybe I've been praying for a
[24:19] week and the Lord spoke this to me
[24:22] sometimes you would want God to speak to
[24:24] you but you're not in a state to hear
[24:26] God speaking you're so far away amen
[24:29] praise God Amen okay let's go to our
[24:31] subject my subject since it's a combined
[24:35] so it will be longer uh I'm getting the
[24:37] inspiration from that message that day
[24:40] on Calvary but um we'll make the title
[24:45] like this what Calvary meant and
[24:49] did and what we need to do for it amen
[24:53] what Calvary meant and did and what we
[24:58] have to do for it so there are three
[25:01] things there the prophet in the message
[25:03] that day on Calvary talks about three
[25:05] aspects he says what it meant what it
[25:10] did and what are you going to do for it
[25:13] amen right praise God Amen so let us
[25:16] read Isaiah uh chapter 6 it's still part
[25:20] of the
[25:22] story and then I load all the bullets uh
[25:26] we shoot a bit and uh we reach check
[25:28] some quotes and shoot a bit
[25:31] amen Isaiah
[25:33] chapter 6 in the year that King oah died
[25:37] I saw also the Lord sitting upon a
[25:40] throne high and lifted up and the trains
[25:43] filled the temple above it stood the
[25:47] seraphim each one had six wings with
[25:49] Twain he covered his face with Twain he
[25:53] covered his feet with Twain he did
[25:55] fly one Cried unto another say
[25:58] holy holy holy is a lot of host the
[26:01] whole earth is full of his glory and the
[26:04] P of a door moved at the voice of him
[26:06] that cried and the house was filled with
[26:08] smoke then said I what is me for I'm
[26:12] undone because I'm a man of unclean lips
[26:15] and I dwell in the midst of people of
[26:17] unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the
[26:19] king the Lord of hosts then flew one of
[26:22] the seraphim unto me having a live coal
[26:25] in his hand which he took taken from the
[26:27] altar
[26:28] uh with the tongues from off the Altar
[26:31] and he laid it upon my mouth and said
[26:33] Lord this has touched thy lips and thine
[26:37] iniquity is taken away and thy sin
[26:40] purged amen did we read Romans chapter
[26:44] 12:1 oh okay so we can start shooting
[26:47] now so um uh some of the things that I
[26:52] want to say in the quotes but uh due to
[26:54] time some of them I'll just say them
[26:56] amen so uh when when Man was created God
[27:01] created man to stay in the presence of

[28:07] back in the presence of God they will
[28:10] talk it over and the relationship will
[28:13] come back again but there was no way to
[28:16] go back to the presence of God but we
[28:18] thank God for that day on Calvary praise

[28:35] away he was almost running away he he
[28:38] said Lord if it be thy will let this cup
[28:41] pass but he says oh not my will because
[28:45] he saw you he saw me he said if I run
[28:48] away that one will all be lost remember

[37:09] don't just enter anyhow when you enter

[37:22] walking around the ark he will go holy
[37:26] holy get
[37:28] holy holy K holy holy K Hallelujah the
[37:33] bells will be ringing then they'll know
[37:35] that he's alive when it's quiet then

[37:40] come in the house of God the Bible says
[37:44] the the cimes were shouting one to
[37:47] another they were saying holy holy holy
[37:50] that's what we are doing right now I'm

[53:43] God
[53:45] yes it
[53:47] says uh that's um 58107
[53:58] paragraph 12 I think or let's begin uh
[54:02] yeah paragraph 12 manifest themselves
[54:05] through the believer when the Holy
[54:06] Spirit comes in to take up the gift I
[54:10] believe that the scripture teaches that
[54:12] gifts and callings are without
[54:14] repentance that when we are born in this
[54:18] world mhm we are sent here for one
[54:23] purpose hallelujah how many were born in
[54:26] this world right how many were born in
[54:29] this world you you never was born you
[54:32] just
[54:36] dropped she didn't raise her hand so so
[54:39] so when you are born in this world bring
[54:41] back that quote when you're born in this
[54:43] world you are
[54:46] sent oh so that issue of saying William
[54:49] Branham a man sent from God so that
[54:54] William Bram will Fast alone he will
[54:56] seek the face of God alone for me it's
[54:59] just to sit and enjoy my rice and enjoy
[55:03] my Shima that's what we eat in Zambia
[55:06] it's a thick a thick porridge me I enjoy
[55:09] this it's everyone of us now we are part
[55:13] of it so this is a boy sent from
[55:17] God hallelujah this is a sister sent
[55:21] from
[55:23] God uhuh so when we all know that we are
[55:27] sent then we now know that we have a
[55:30] job Hallelujah let's read it further it
[55:35] says
[55:39] um sent by one
[55:41] purpose uh and and that that
[55:44] is that is of
[55:47] myself no no no no no what I want to do
[55:51] I want to work hard I want to buy that
[55:53] car and then I want to you everything is
[55:55] about you about you about you it it says
[55:59] hallelujah that is of
[56:03] god you came here for a purpose and that
[56:07] purpose is of God Amen your job is to
[56:11] find out Lord what do you want me to do
[56:15] praise God Amen Hallelujah you have a
[56:18] job my brother you have a job my sister
[56:21] you have to present so each time you
[56:23] don't present yourself your job is
[56:27] is is is not being
[56:29] done praise God Amen it it says that
[56:34] before we become adults before we we are
[56:37] even become adults while we are yet
[56:39] children the gifts that we have of God
[56:42] is in us then and only the filling of
[56:47] the Holy Spirit puts these gifts into
[56:49] operation so if it's not
[56:52] operating maybe the issue is the Holy
[56:55] Ghost amen that's why we are in the
[56:58] house of God you have to receive the
[57:00] Holy Ghost come on receive the Holy
[57:03] Ghost I like
[57:05] that there we can go receive the Holy
[57:08] Ghost I would preach that a thousand
[57:10] times receive the Holy Ghost receive the
[57:13] Holy Ghost receive the ah come on praise
[57:16] God Amen my my my the spirit puts the
[57:20] gifts into operation but we have them in
[57:23] the beginning such as teachers so it's
[57:26] just the preachers Apostles oh okay it's
[57:29] just brother Jack and Prophets oh
[57:31] brother Brenham he adds and and the
[57:33] gifts of tongues uh you have a job to
[57:38] speak in tongues and the nine spiritual
[57:40] gifts according to Corinthians 12 you
[57:43] know what's in Corinthians 12
[57:45] Corinthians 12 says do I have a few
[57:48] minutes let's read Corinthians 12
[57:52] mhm Corinthians 12 says
[57:58] now concerning spiritual gifts Brethren
[58:00] I would not have you ignorant Paul
[58:04] doesn't want people to be ignorant but
[58:06] there's too much ignorance about gifts
[58:09] in the
[58:10] message that's the truth why should
[58:13] people remain ignorant Paul says I don't
[58:17] want you to be ignorant concerning
[58:20] spiritual gifts that's right am there's
[58:24] some uh crooked Ness that has happened
[58:27] some some uh robbery that has happened
[58:31] such that the message land has been
[58:34] robbed of the knowledge of the gifts
[58:38] through some teaching I don't know which
[58:41] crook taught things says no we don't
[58:44] need the gifts we don't need these
[58:46] things why why why would you say that no
[58:50] you know they are for Pentecostals you
[58:51] know Mark 16 says this sign shall follow
[58:53] them that believe in my name they shall
[58:55] cast out they speak with new tongues you
[58:56] know these tongues tongues things they
[58:58] are for Pentecostals show me which
[59:00] Pentecostal wrote Mark 16 was it written
[59:03] by Assemblies of God or or Church of God
[59:07] it was the Lord Jesus who spoke those
[59:09] words and for your information he died
[59:12] speaking in tongues praise God Amen
[59:15] Hallelujah praise God Amen Hallelujah
[59:19] put a tape of Bram Tabernacle you hear
[59:22] someone speaking tongues someone
[59:24] interprets what where has that gone in
[59:27] the message churches you find message
[59:29] churches from January to December from
[59:32] uh uh for 10 years no one has ever
[59:34] spoken in tongues in the church and the
[59:36] people are comfortable we are in the
[59:38] message which
[59:40] message praise God not not that of
[59:43] William Bram not that of Malachi 4 it is
[59:47] another kind but the message that I know
[59:50] in Bram Tabernacle people used to speak
[59:52] in tongues people used to interpret
[59:54] tongues people used to operate you know
[59:57] bham Tabernacle was a church in the days
[59:59] when braam was around and brother
[1:00:00] Neville when braam is not around people
[1:00:03] would still come to church and brother
[1:00:05] Neville would prophesy on them that's
[1:00:07] right but what have we done we've thrown
[1:00:10] that away until when we come to church a
[1:00:13] person says I want to know the will of
[1:00:14] God over this matter what is God saying
[1:00:17] brother it's all in the
[1:00:19] tapes which
[1:00:21] tape show me that tape
[1:00:24] quickly where I can find something that
[1:00:26] is going to tell me what I have to do
[1:00:28] praise God Amen
[1:00:31] Hallelujah Hallelujah my my my my where
[1:00:34] was I we were reading a quote let's go
[1:00:37] back to the
[1:00:39] quote let's go back to the
[1:00:41] quote so he
[1:00:43] says
[1:00:45] um according to Corinthians 12 we
[1:00:48] started reading Corinthians 12 did we
[1:00:50] okay so we talked about the ignorance
[1:00:52] and let's go don't don't take that away
[1:00:54] I'm coming back there you know that you
[1:00:56] were Gentiles carried away unto these
[1:00:59] damn Idols even as you were led oh Paul
[1:01:02] is saying don't be ignorant of the gifts
[1:01:04] because it is possible for you Gentiles
[1:01:08] to become ignorant of the gifts because
[1:01:10] your old religion of Idols your Idols
[1:01:13] were not talking back to you so when you
[1:01:15] come to church you will just do your
[1:01:18] songs your kneeling down and maybe seven
[1:01:21] times you finish your whole program the
[1:01:23] thing you call your God will never talk
[1:01:25] to you and if you're in another town it
[1:01:27] will never walk to where you are but
[1:01:29] Paul is saying no no no this is not the
[1:01:32] way it is in Christianity if you're
[1:01:34] going to come with that mentality I call
[1:01:36] it idolatry in Christianity where you
[1:01:39] don't expect your God to come but the
[1:01:42] God we worship is not an idol he is
[1:01:45] alive he rose again he rose again he's
[1:01:49] able to come in this service and open
[1:01:51] your eyes and you can see the pillar of
[1:01:54] fire right here praise got a man and
[1:01:57] he's able to anoint someone he's able to
[1:02:00] anoint someone and they'll speak in
[1:02:02] tongues and we interpret tongues and we
[1:02:04] are going to hear right now what heaven
[1:02:07] is saying
[1:02:09] hallelujah praise God Amen Hallelujah he
[1:02:13] says we believe that these gifts are in
[1:02:16] operation today and they should be in
[1:02:21] every local church
[1:02:24] hallelujah praise God amen hallelujah we
[1:02:28] need to preach the message again in this
[1:02:31] in this world I think I need to go
[1:02:33] around the whole world reminding them
[1:02:35] this Hallelujah every local church but
[1:02:39] what do we see in the message preachers
[1:02:41] are beating the gifts preachers are
[1:02:43] stopping the prophecies there's a
[1:02:45] scripture which says quench not the
[1:02:49] spirit despise not prophecy is that
[1:02:53] Bible the Bible people are guilty at the
[1:02:57] end of The Journey people will answer
[1:03:00] for stopping the gifts praise God Amen I
[1:03:04] like it when I say that because many of
[1:03:07] you are thinking of the preachers who
[1:03:08] are stopping the gifts are the ones who
[1:03:10] answer but do you know that you yourself
[1:03:12] can stop your own gift praise God Amen
[1:03:15] Hallelujah the spirit of the Lord comes
[1:03:18] upon you and you feel the electricity
[1:03:20] and you say I don't want this I don't
[1:03:23] want this and you hold it and you quench
[1:03:26] the spirit but the Bible says quench not
[1:03:29] the spirit
[1:03:32] Hallelujah come
[1:03:33] on praise God amen
[1:03:37] hallelujah amen hallelujah no this is a
[1:03:41] message church if I speak in tongues
[1:03:42] here one preacher says when you speak in
[1:03:44] tongues here and there's no interpreter
[1:03:47] you I'll tell the deacons to take you
[1:03:48] out because those are demons that's a
[1:03:51] lie that's not what the Bible says Paul
[1:03:54] says if you speak in Tong
[1:03:56] when we are together it needs an
[1:03:59] interpretation what if when I'm alone oh
[1:04:02] brother I'll be changing gears gear one
[1:04:04] R gear two
[1:04:07] Roo praise God Amen I'll speak them
[1:04:13] amen yes praise God hallelujah yes but
[1:04:18] when we come together he says when you
[1:04:21] speak in tongues let the speaker
[1:04:24] interpret or pray that they interpret if
[1:04:27] there's no interpreter let the speaker
[1:04:30] keep silent he didn't say they stop they
[1:04:33] speak to themselves and God so you just
[1:04:35] reduce your volume you go from Roo
[1:04:40] to praise God Amen that's what the Bible
[1:04:43] says and and for your information for
[1:04:46] you to know that there's no
[1:04:47] interpretation how are you going to know
[1:04:50] you have to speak the first time so the
[1:04:52] first time is allowed Hallelujah
[1:04:56] praise God Amen so you can speak the
[1:04:58] first time and if there's no interpreter
[1:05:01] when they come the second time you just
[1:05:03] reduce the volume you go on my sister
[1:05:05] you go on my brother because that's what
[1:05:08] the Bible says hallelujah hallelujah
[1:05:12] praise God Amen they should be in every
[1:05:15] local church you should be worried me I
[1:05:18] tell people you come to church brother

[1:05:52] the day of Pentecost when the day of P
[1:05:55] cost was fully calm they were all
[1:05:59] assembled in one place and suddenly

[1:06:04] rushing Mighty Wind and it filled the
[1:06:06] whole house where they were sitting and
[1:06:08] there appeared tongues of fire upon each
[1:06:10] one of them and they were all filled
[1:06:14] with the Holy Ghost and they began to

[1:11:50] are spreading sin on the people the
[1:11:53] sacrifice must be holy the sacrifice
[1:11:55] must be holy say Lord forgive my sins

[1:17:27] moment I know for certain that the Holy
[1:17:30] Spirit spoke to us here
[1:17:32] tonight man and I know the spirit of God
[1:17:35] was pleased with what the minister had
[1:17:37] to
[1:17:38] share and um it just always an
[1:17:41] encouragement to me when God sends a
[1:17:43] minister just to kind of walk right into
[1:17:45] the same channel that the church has
[1:17:47] already been dealing with and um you
[1:17:51] know I mentioned to you
[1:17:53] all um the um our theme you know for
[1:17:57] this year was um get back in step and
[1:18:02] and uh the underlying inspiration behind
[1:18:05] that was I will restore sayeth the Lord
[1:18:08] and I and I mentioned to you all that um
[1:18:12] the gifts in the church were a part of
[1:18:17] the
[1:18:17] restoration and uh this is one church
[1:18:20] that actually believes in the gifts in
[1:18:22] the church I just love the the way the
[1:18:25] Lord use our precious brother uh Jimmy
[1:18:28] now he said something tonight that gave
[1:18:32] life to those that have gifts when we go
[1:18:36] back and we read the scripture and it
[1:18:38] says now one would speak in
[1:18:41] tongues and now before you quench the
[1:18:45] spirit you have to allow the tongue to
[1:18:47] go forth and if nobody is there to
[1:18:51] interpret then when the Holy Spirit
[1:18:52] comes back upon you you just turn it
[1:18:55] back down but we have been hindered in
[1:18:59] our walk by not understanding the
[1:19:02] scripture right but but when the Holy
[1:19:05] Spirit comes you don't know if you would
[1:19:07] just release and it's not you don't let
[1:19:09] it get it out of order but when when you
[1:19:11] release it you don't know if somebody's
[1:19:13] there that has the gift to interpret how
[1:19:16] many times have I heard that you know
[1:19:19] somebody was ready to speak in tongues
[1:19:20] and then say well I had I had to I I I
[1:19:23] was ready to give an interpretation but
[1:19:24] I just I just held it you quenching the
[1:19:28] spirit don't do that don't do that we
[1:19:31] this was restored this end time message
[1:19:35] brought it all back and we don't leave
[1:19:38] this with the Pentecost they do it
[1:19:40] because they don't know what they doing
[1:19:42] my God but here we know exactly what
[1:19:44] we're standing on and this was what God
[1:19:47] brought back into the church I'm so glad
[1:19:50] God sent a brother all the way from
[1:19:52] zomia Amen to to share that with us
[1:19:55] tonight how
[1:19:57] lifegiving how we should be freed in our
[1:20:01] spirit amen because the devil has bound
[1:20:03] us up for so many years but I tell you
[1:20:05] what now it's been loose by the end time
[1:20:10] message the holy brother brandom say the
[1:20:12] Holy Ghost have been bound by
[1:20:13] denominational Rivers for thousands of
[1:20:15] years but now it's been Loos by the end
[1:20:18] time
[1:20:18] message my God my God I'm looking for
[1:20:21] God to do some great things in here
[1:20:24] looking for God to do and I I I I I just
[1:20:27] felt tonight was a release amen that was
[1:20:30] that was nothing but the Holy Ghost to
[1:20:31] come and bring that to us like that
[1:20:33] nothing but the Holy Ghost oh my my my
[1:20:36] my my my my my my hallelujah hallelujah
[1:20:41] amen we not going to have to uh make it
[1:20:43] happen it's just going to happen cuz the
[1:20:46] ones that have the gifts they they feel
[1:20:47] it all the time often time they feel it
[1:20:49] they feel it you know especially when uh
[1:20:52] the preachers Minister the word if
[1:20:54] there's an altar call that's going forth
[1:20:55] we know we don't do things like that but
[1:20:58] there was always order to when things
[1:21:01] were done and uh we going to we're just
[1:21:03] going to step back into the order that's
[1:21:05] what getting back in step is all about
[1:21:07] you know get back into the step and get
[1:21:09] back into the order of what God the way
[1:21:10] God's wanted but no no preaching against

[1:21:17] amen amen thank you thank you our
[1:21:21] precious brother thank you for for for
[1:21:23] just com

[1:21:55] side and and and and and and and see
[1:21:58] when you realize that as a Believer uh
[1:22:01] he was writing the scripture because in
[1:22:03] uh uh that Psalm 34 I believe says the
[1:22:07] angel of the Lord encampeth round about
[1:22:10] them that fear Him and deliver them from
[1:22:13] all their troubles and brother random
[1:22:15] told us not everybody have an angel the
[1:22:17] only ones that have an angel are those
[1:22:20] that fear
[1:22:22] Him Glory to God so if if you fear God
[1:22:25] there's an Angel going with you wherever
[1:22:27] you go there's an angel right there and
[1:22:30] he's there for your service whatever you

[1:22:58] Calvary we yield ourselves and we allow

[1:31:20] blessed to be able to hear God you just
[1:31:24] speak to our hearts the way that you
[1:31:25] spoke to us father I just believe uh
[1:31:30] spiritually people were set free by the
[1:31:33] word that was spoken The Clarity on the
[1:31:36] word Lord we we needed to hear something
[1:31:39] like this we knew that uh that the gifts
[1:31:43] were restored it was part of the
[1:31:46] restoration process brother brandom said
[1:31:48] there were there were four death
[1:31:51] Messengers that took life out
[1:31:54] but in that brid tree there was four
[1:31:56] life Messengers that brought it back in
[1:31:59] and one of those life Messengers
[1:32:01] restored the gifts of the Spirit it came
[1:32:05] back through what happened at auzu
[1:32:07] street but God they they just they went
[1:32:09] off into denomination and they that's
[1:32:11] why the spirit was quenched but yet you
[1:32:14] brought a restoration back into the body
[1:32:17] of Christ and Lord we all we need to do
[1:32:19] is just align it properly according to
[1:32:22] the word then you're free to do exactly
[1:32:25] what you want to do in our midst so
[1:32:27] thank you for allowing your servant to
[1:32:28] come and Lord to speak so much to our
[1:32:30] hearts this is uh we realize what what
[1:32:33] Calvary has done for us but now what do
[1:32:36] we need to do for Calvary and that's
[1:32:39] simply yielding ourselves and allowing
[1:32:41] you to carry on your ministry through
[1:32:45] your bride so father we just we just we
[1:32:48] just pray Lord that you would help us
[1:32:49] Lord to meditate on as we heard tonight
[1:32:51] let the we know the scripture promis us
[1:32:54] that the Angels would encamp us but Lord
[1:32:55] let us go with the angel and let us Lord
[1:32:58] just begin to uh Lord just take our
[1:33:01] claims on the things that you've
[1:33:03] promised us father allow the angel of
[1:33:05] the Lord to go to work on our behalf We
[1:33:09] Trust oh God that you would uh continue
[1:33:13] to get Glory and Honor out of all that
