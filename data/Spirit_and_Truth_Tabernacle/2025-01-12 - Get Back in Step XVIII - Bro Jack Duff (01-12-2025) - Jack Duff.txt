love Jesus amen he's the only thing worth loving praise God Amen we thank god um we will um um you know I'm I'm going just do something a little different y'all know that I'm preaching from Joel um to and um uh but let's just read the scripture that we close with on last week and that's Revelation 10 and um we'll just read from there I was had an opportunity to talk with the a dear relative of mine this week and he's instrumental to my even um being here in the pull pit just an experience that I had at his house and uh some years ago before I accepted my call to Ministry and um but he was just you know he I remember him just telling me how him and his wife would go to sunos high school he was Ren in the school and and he would uh um set the school up and sometimes when he set up it' just be him and his wife there uh and he would preach like the house was full and uh you know he was just telling me about his journey and things like that just really really brought a lot of encouragement to me but he uh he was telling me says uh Jack i' be i' be listening to the sermon uh cuz I can't go out to service he's going through something in his body say so I I I I tune in to uh different Services the online uh service service and it says I just need you to know that I'm I'm I'm I'm looking I'm listening and I'm learning hallu praise the Lord and I say well my God and I realize how uh important what we're doing uh to is to so many it's not just us that come here but there are people that are watching online that that need uh you know what what what what what is happening here and for one area that the devil to fight in is in the technology and we just got to bind that devil in the name of Jesus and just pray that God would give us wisdom on how to navigate uh the technology to make sure we have the right Tools in place to ensure a uh um you know just a smooth smooth uh experience amen because people people need it people people need it amen praise God so let's read this this uh we read this last week in closing and uh we we'll just pick it up here but you know our theme is get back in step and uh this is one of the verses that help us get back in Step it's right here you know in the Bible but verse one says and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud my God my God my God and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillows of fire this is n none other than the Lord Jesus Christ himself in this scripture amen and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot up uh on the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion Roth and when he when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and uh when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write so now John heard what the Thunder said and John was about to write it amen but he was uh he heard a voice says and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not so John knew it John heard it John knew it John understood it John was about to write it and he was told don't write it okay and and then verse 5 says and the angel went SAW stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that are that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the Sea and the uh uh and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer amen so this is uh this is end time and a lot of time people ask you know I was asking the question what is it that we believe what do you call this and I tell them it's called The End Time message right because this happens at the end time and and I'm here to tell you that like I read to y'all last week uh the mystery is actually history amen this not something that we're looking forward to this scripture has already been fulfilled and it was fulfilled in the ministry of of William Mariam brandom praise God and verse 7 says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound uh he says the mystery of God shall be finish as he have declared to his servants the prophets and i' like to just quickly read amen Revelation 3 because we read Revelation 10:7 in the days of the voice of the seventh angel will who um uh I guess uh what seventh angel are is the scripture referring to the answer is found in Revelation 3 and4 which simply says amen and unto the angel of the Church of the leod Deans write these things saith the amen yeah that's the the the soul Let It Be Hallelujah the amen the faithful and through witness the beginning of the creation of God there is so much I can just take off right there and because when you know people read these things and they don't see nothing I see everything beginning of the creation of God Amen and and and in in in so so so many ways uh and brother brandom addressed is you know all of this in the church age book uh but but when we when we want to know who Revelation 10:7 is referring to is the same person in Revelation 3:14 amen so if you find out who Revelation 3:14 is then you know who Revelation 10:7 is amen and if you want to know who any of those is go to Revelation 101 he will tell you who these is hallelujah all right let's pray father we thank you oh God for uh the privilege that we have to be able to come and um just enjoy the presence of God uh we have been blessed by the worship service and blessed by the specials that have gone forth and now Lord is the word that must come forth and uh God we we not only take control over every Spirit here in the house of the Lord but we take control father over the atmosph spere that might be trying to hinder the technology and Lord we ask that you would just uh make it Lord where things run smooth and that the people that are on the other end can hear without any distraction as we know the devil is trying to fight those Souls he's trying to fight the truth from coming to the people they get distracted they get upset they get frustrated then they turn to another Channel Lord we we we bind that devil right now in the name of Jesus and Lord let your word go forth un Ender we ask Lord that you take complete control over every thought that will be presented and every thought that would be received God we commit it now into your hands in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you you can be seated glory to God um so much Amen in our journey here of get back and step and um I'm I sometimes I have to find where to get in and where to get out uh because I know I can't preach it all in one service I couldn't even preach it all in one year uh so I'm just doing everything I can amen just to continue this journey and here's the other thing that I that I I realized um after having that conversation this this week um where we may take things for granted that you know oh I know that oh I know that I know that there's a lot of people have no idea what we talking about lots lots so we have to take our time you know and make sure that people are getting understanding uh you know of this truth it's it's important the only reason we are still here on this Earth is because we have not found the last seed and the last seed might be coming through the string right we we don't we don't know so so it's it's imperative amen that we we uh we just kind of go through a few things and and I think as we're going through we'll we'll be blessed amen we'll be blessed but I want to start with a a quote amen out of the sermon the super sign I was listening to this uh throughout the week and um you know and it just it just blessed my heart um you know one of the things I shared with the brothers this week was that there was a brother Brandon made a statement in that message that uh we got people that go to church religiously you know week to week basis some are what we call Sunday only Christians amen summer Wednesday night and Sunday morning Christians amen right uh some you know are uh uh what we call CEOs Christmas and Easter only glory to God but they are Christians amen and um but uh but but he was saying he he says you know often times what we're seeing today is that people just have just enough to get them to go to church on a regular basis but they they not really uh willing or looking to go deeper in the things of God hello somebody and uh and it says uh you know what what happens is that they um uh they have eyes to see and what what he means by that is that they have eyes to see and understand um uh I'm going to use this term when we preach Jesus Hallelujah because there's a lot of people that would tell you all you need to do is preach Jesus well if you really understood scripture what I just read at Revelation 10 was Jesus and I am preaching Jesus right but but but but when they when when you hear people say preach Jesus what they're talking about is the five uh the the the five the the two loaves of bread and five fish or five loaves of bread and two fish or whatever it was but the just Loaves and bread they want the miracles of Jesus but they don't want the word of Jesus but but when we preach Jesus we going to preach the miracles of Jesus and we're going to preach the prophecy of Jesus we going to preach the word of Jesus we going to preach all of that that that's Jesus amen Jesus is found from Genesis to Revelation and that's what we preaching right here we preaching Jesus Hall amen but but it's very important for us to understand you know uh just the depths of the word of God right right uh Jesus himself gave prophecy and we need to be able to look into those prophecies that Jesus was speaking about how is this being manifested right it's not just we're not here just for for fish and and and and bread because the Bible tells that man should not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of my mouth we're not just here for miracles amen we're here for the word of God come on somebody amen we're here for the word of God so so I'm going to kind of you know he he says he says what what it is that people just religious enough to be able to go to church but really not get deep and say what it is the scriptures being fulfilled in their life they have eyes to see but they cannot see see right Hallelujah they can't see the deeper things of the word of God sir all right let's here in that message super signning makes a comment says watch these geese over here in Texas where many of them go I've seen the time uh that we have to stop the car on the road they are not bothered about nobody they're thinking about going uh they got a revival going on the geese right he said they got a revival going on all of them together you never heard such a noise he says it's worse than the Pentecostals when they when they get together he talk about geese now he's looking at God in nature Hallelujah you can if you study nature sometimes you'll find how God operates how God moves and and and we're we're getting ready to kind of step into something here and and I might I might be ahead of myself but I might as well said if I repeat myself it'll be good because that mean the message amen will get home sometimes you got to repeat yourself to ensure that the message get home but he said what happens is that amen there's a cold spell that will hit up in Canada and when that cold spell hits in Canada it is a sign to the geese that is time to leave Canada yes sir oh hallelujah amen and he says uh one of those geese say never ever led the pack before all right glory to God but this geese was born with a certain amount of inspiration and God put it inside that one geese not all the other geese now but this one geese would catch the inspiration that it's time to go south and all he had to do is just feel a little bit of cold weather and when he when he feels the cold weather he know now wait a minute this ain't this this ain't the right temperature this ain't the right place for geese will'll freeze out here if we don't do something about it we will die right here if we don't do something about it and and God has orchestrated and has ordain that there's a place that the geese can go are y'all going to preach with me today but they have to be led by inspiration of where amen of just I mean and just get up and and act go and as the holy spirit will leave them down south they never been to Texas before but he know there's a Texas out there somewhere Hallelujah somebody I'm talking about geese but I want you to type this to the church maybe you're sitting in a condition where things are drying up amen you see death is all around a cold breeze has come in but there's a place where you can go Hallelujah just like God provided for the keys God has provided for his people there is a place that you can [Applause] Goen Jesus geese would would would would would would feel I mean one would just feel led like we know we got to get out of this condition we can't stay here yes sir I'm dying I'm drying up I'm dying and look and if the geese want to live the geese got to [Applause] leave I'm talking to some geese if the geese want to live then the geese got to leave amen hello somebody glory to God if them geese amen don't leave Canada then they they'll stay there and die but the geese got to have some get up and go the GE got the geese got to be willing to step out on faith I ain't never been this way before things are changing for me but that geese knows that God has sent a sign with the cold weather and I must go south I can't stay here no more I must go south one of the Gees would would feel inspired and brother brandom say he would go the honk honk and when they would hear the other geese would hear the honk honk they say it's something about what that fell is saying and then there' be other geese that would rise up and they say honk honk and they say no no that ain't the right honk but this guy right here got the right honk and he say honk honk and he get them wings of flapping and he take off going south and all the other geese get right in line sir and they follow that LE they follow that God never been led by him before but because of his sound come on because of what he preaching praise God because of the inspiration they realize say something about the swn the Holy Ghost is in this amen hallelujah take off going south to safety oh God and when it get a little hot in the South they take off and go back up north but you got to be as a geese if you want to live you got to be willing to move hallelujah hallelujah let me read sign oh my [Music] God it says it's worse than the Pentecostals when they get together see what is it it's the laws of nature see they every year they get together they swarm and away they go when when them Ducks leave in the geese Le Texas summer is on the road that's right he says um and when the when when when they leave Northern British Columbia went to is on the way yeah hear them geese going over screaming the way they do going south I can listen at them and cry says because I see God hallelujah I see God and that that I mean that's what me I I just want to see God hallah Amen I I I'm typing something here and I hope you can read between the lines but you know but but but but but it it it it take God to do things for people amen it when you stand on what God has done what God has reveal to you what God has showed you then nobody can stand against that and and oh my I believe the scripture say if if God before me but but it take God spirit and truth then then just just start just to start no it was God guiding God did this and and when he did it I didn't know none of y'all would be here but look at what God did God prepared a place for such a time as this God did that yes he did amen oh my God am he said he because I see God guiding them what is it guides them through the pathless air when he when he's nothing but a dumb brute what is it that does it when I hear him going down screaming that leader out there kind of taking uh his way maybe he's never uh winged his way to Louisiana before my God but he'll get there you want to know why he'll get there because God is guiding him he got the perfect GPS system God's protective system a God's predestinated system amen look at this he said he'll get there don't you worry he's got something in him that tells him where to go Hallelujah right I'm I'm reading the message he is taking his flight he is leading the herd the whole swarm of them is coming they may never been here before but he knows right exactly where The Rice patties has has got the rice because he's got something that leads him it's a nature it says then the spring when it's nice and warm down down down here through the winter he'll go right straight back again why it's nature displaying itself it's the laws of God Amen stay with me as we keep reading here the prophet when he when he's saying things like that he's trying to set the people up for something glory to God glor glory to God are set up for a blessing amen his signs always for runs his events just as that does what was the sign when it get cold go south when it get hot go north that's the sign oh my the sign we know that we need to leave here but how do we get out of here oh my everybody can feel the change in weather all the Gees feeling let me just break this down even for the church the church where everybody know that there's a Rapture awaiting us everybody know that we in the end times but how do we get out of here we need amen a Gees amen that's able to lead us out of these conditions and I'm here to tell you God sent us a prophet and that Prophet has been able to lead us out of these conditions man we on our way somewhere amen any day now any day now am a body change could happen any day now that's why you want to be living right you want to be living right I mean 24

everything he done gave us everything to to to to take our attention off of God sometime the only attention God get is these two or three hours on a Sunday morning that's all God get and think about all the hours that's wasted throughout the week yes amen right think about all the hours that's Wast I mean and and see back in the day they didn't have all this technology to to mess them up the way we messed up they the Bible was satisfying to them they would get around read that Bible that man this is this is life to us now it it take everything to read the Bible it take everything for people to just pick up their Bible and bring it to church Bible got dust on it it's a shame before God well I got my Bible on my phone are you a little ashamed of carrying your Bible to church I just want to

you dressed like you're going maybe they might say I wish I could go with you sometime they don't know whether they going to church or to a club hello somebody glory to God all right let's let's keep reading I'm I'm I'm I'm coming here it says when you see these geese going see the bugs coming on see the leaves falling off see it's the it's the continuity of nature blending in God's law of nature Blends in and he for runs his events it always has been it never has failed and it never will fail he says if we just follow the continuity of God's word we will never fail either if we'll take if we'll not take the modern trend of the day and try to inject something else into it but just follow the continuity of it for this age watch what takes place we'll go straight home to which is heaven we'll go straight home to one of these days always does that and never fails so he says now watch these signs yes sign is when it gets cold leave the North and go south when it gets hot it's time to leave the South and go back North this is what the geese follow the signs that God has placed in nature the laws of nature the the Four Seasons and they follow those signs Hallelujah if geese are are are are are smart enough to follow these signs what about the people of God we got to recognize when signs are occurring around us amen glory to God we got to recognize when signs are happening you know the scripture even speaks of like you know there'll be signs in the in the in the heavens you know and in the earth we see all these kind of I mean you know Lord and please if I forget to do this we need to do it the people out in California uh just the fires are just out of control and and I mean when you you when you imagine I heard that they they got fires I think four fires that's almost about to connect and then they don't even have water to be able to put the fires out you talk about uh a major problem that's a major problem people um I mean and it just start from who knows where it start from even during the winter right I mean just so so sometimes we look around we see things happening all around us judgment settling in right judgment settling in but but but but as we see these things we are we the scripture tell us look up for our Redemption is drawn n the the the time of the coming of the Lord is at hand and there are signs that happen to show us that his coming is near amen oh my and I can just say not just near but his coming is here we living in the coming of the Lord right now amen Amen Let me let me let me keep reading here's a statement that I think is very important we watching signs there's one big sign that the prophet says is H says prophets are the chief sign come on now so when God sends a prophet on the earth that is a chief sign that's a huge sign that's a big thing that God just did that you need to keep your eyes on prophets are a are the chief sign he says God's chief sign is a prophet says I'm going to speak a few minutes about that they are uh they are his word made manifest for that age now now uh you you we looking at that but what I'm what I'm what I'm trying to get you to see is when I read to you these scriptures I read Revelation 10:7 I read Revelation 3:14 I read Malachi 4:5 and six I I read these things those scriptures amen when that Prophet shows up he is the manifestation of those scriptures when John the Baptist showed up he was the manifestation of Malachi 3 Hallelujah right hello somebody when Jesus Christ came on the earth and was born of a virgin he was the manifestation of Genesis 3:15 the woman's seed amen and then Isaiah said that a virgin shall conceive Jesus became the manifestation of what Isaiah prophesied about it can you imagine Isaiah being in church my Lord amen and raising up and saying thus sayith the Lord I feel [Music] inspired what is it Prophet what is it what is it that you see a virgin shall conceive prophet of God now Prophet we done we done heard some of your prophecies but now this one right here is just a little bit too farfetched did you hear what you just said a virgin shall conceive now there was some that probably looked at the prophet Isaiah and say ain't no way this man done lost it I'm sorry God has left them it's it's this is just impossible that that is that has never happened before never will happen we and and they probably didn't they didn't know that right there in the scripture he was only saying what what what was already prophesied God himself prophesied in Genesis 3:15 he was connecting to that prophecy Hallelujah but they probably didn't put it all together and then now there are some that probably believe and they start not testifying I'm that virgin I'm that virgin I'm the one that's been but God said no no no you ain't the one God was waiting years and years and years and years before this virgin would actually come on the earth my God and all the conditions that happened with that virgin that was on the earth y'all got the you go back you studied the story Mary Mary Mary lost her father at a young age she was raised in a single family home by her by her mother you can imagine the mama trying to keep all the all the buzzards off of Mary right right hello somebody MH I mean just trying to no you can't go out with your cousin you can't go to this house and you can't do that you got to stay here with me and her and Mary just going back and forth but Mary not even knowing why her mama had to be that way right yes sir oh God right but but here Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary subjects herself to a mother and then one day here comes this this brother that has an interest in Mary now his situation he's already been married and he got kids right hello and he want Mary to be this his his next wife but he's well off he can take care of he can do all these things whatever I mean I guess well off for that day but you know he can take care of him we we we have this kind of life but but here he comes he wants to court Mary oh Lord have mercy but Mary gets Mary Mary brother Brandon say Mary and Joseph just having a little bible study reading the book of Isaiah Hallelujah and and they they come across the scripture a virgin shall conceive and Mary said what you think the scripture mean by that uh Joseph say I'm not really sure but that's what the Bible say so we say Amen to it yes so so Mary go home and and and she's thinking about the scripture and see this is what happen when you thinking about the word he'll draw near if you think about him he'll draw nigh to you glory to God you draw nigh to him he'll draw nigh to you and here here come here come the angel gab said blessed art thou Mary you're you're you're you're highly favored and and say say she like what kind of salutation this say Mary Don't Fear don't fear I come from the presence of the Lord and I got something to tell you said you going to have a child it's going to be a son you're going to call him Jesus and and and she like wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute now you know I don't know no man that that my testimony I a't been I ain't been going from manto man I'm I'm I've been keeping myself waiting the marry J just say say I know what you've been doing but God has called you to be the manifestation of his word am how shall these things be seeing that I know not a man and here come Mar Mary he said he say the Holy Ghost will overshadow you and and caus for this to be manifested in you she never even heard anything about the Holy Ghost all this was new language to Mary but you know rather than Mary sit there and start uh H uh trying to figure it all out Mary said one thing that created the change she said be it unto me according to Thy word Amen brother random said that's when the pregnancy happened right there as soon as she said amen to the word of God amen but when Mary came she was a manifestation of that word when when we see these scriptures that I'm sharing with you and I got more than I'm going share when you see uh a prophet comeing see he's the chief sign and he is the manifestation of that word and this is why I always ask people if brother Brandon was not the manifestation of it all you got to do is just tell me who it was that's all you need to do is tell me who was the manifestation of these scriptures that I'm sharing with you amen we need need to know right we need to know because that's a chief sign right before the second coming of the Lord yes sir amen let me keep reading prophets are the chief sign God's chief sign is a prophet now I'm going to speak few minutes about that they are his word made manifest for that age and that's the reason the prophet is always God's chief sign he has never sent a judgment upon the Earth without first sending a prophet yes Noah day no judgment before he he he sent a prophet I'm going to give you another one there was no judgment of Sodom Gora until God came to speak to his Prophet right right who was his prophet Abraham and if you don't believe it read Genesis 20 and7 it says he is my Prophet Hallelujah so Before Destruction could strike Sodom and gomorra God had to go to Abraham and before the rain fell in Noah's day God went to Noah glory to God Amen right before before the the darkness and everything fell uh in Egypt God went to Moses this is God's pattern amen so if he's the same which he is the same yesterday today and forever he would do the same thing today we better find the chief sign yes sir yes Lord Hallelujah glory and keep our eyes on that all right look at it now he says they are his word made manifest for that age and that's uh the reason a prophet is always God's chief sign he has never sent a judgment upon the Earth without first the prophet just see and search the scriptures a prophet is the chief sign of God to his people that he sent this person this certain person like Noah like Moses and Elijah and the prophets he sent them to manifest the word for that age Amen to give his people a warning just the same as he sends a cold spell upon the Ducks see how he just flipped it all the way back around just the same as he sends a cold spell upon the Ducks to run them from the north to the South continuity in nature continuity in the word he never fails to do it if he takes cold weather to run them down next year it takes cold weather to run them down if it takes hot weather to run them back the next year it takes hot weather to run them back it never changes God uses these signs Amen in nature in order for his geese to be protected and I'm telling God is more concerned about his people who are Made In His Image amen he's more more concerned about them than just the geese that's right Hallelujah he's concerned about the geese but he's more concerned about his people that's made his image it's up to us to follow the chief sign amen all right amen amen let me uh let me move amen a little further one one more quote here and then I want to just hit the scripture this is from the anointed ones at the end time praise God ano the anointed ones at the end time now I'm I'm giving you the title but I told you in the title there's a message and and what he what he's trying to tell you is that there will be some anointed people in this end time it'll look so much like the real close it'll be so close and and and it seem like man they got they got this going on they got that going on they got this I mean look at where they worshiping look at these big buildings they got it's going I mean it's going to look so good to people so enticing but it's going to be absolutely wrong come on now absolutely wrong I mean one one one one I told you recently fellow asked me so what you what what's your thoughts about the church today it ain't what my thoughts are I ain't got no thoughts but I can tell you what the Bible says you know what the Bible say about the church today they're going to be uh it says that they going to be uh um Rich increase with Goods going to say they have need of nothing and not know that they are wretched they miserable they poor they blind they naked and and and and they don't even know that's the condition and then and then and then and then say now what what what Jesus thinks of them is that that they they in that condition wretched poor Mis I mean miserable poor blind and naked and uh and then he says the other thing that that that's going to happen with the church in this day that and it's the only only age where it's happens Jesus Christ the one that they say they worshiping the one that they say they praising he's going to be on the outside of his church knocking trying to get back into the church because he's been kicked out of the church how did he get kicked out of his church they forsook his word and the same people that say they preaching Jesus actually kick Jesus [Music] out think about it now I mean look look look look this happened history is repeating itself because in in in in the Old Testament um when they would come to the they bring they sacrifice to the to the uh to the to the uh to the church to The Altar and everything and to the temple they bring they sacrifice and they offering all these allst and then you know they had the the the the outer Court they had the inner Court they had the holies of holies and when Jesus died on the cross that holies of holies was actually torn in two and brother Brad said here they they're inside the temple looking at the very God right the very God that they rejected they looking at him on the cross inside the temple worshiping but they had rejected him Lord he was on the outside sir amen right and it's the same thing repeat he's on the outside of the church knocking trying to get back in yes sir and the people actually think he's on the inside because they feel a little anointed wow oh my the anointing the anointing can hurt you the anointing if you don't handle it right right yeah can cause you to miss the promised land you know under the anointing Moses struck a rock twice and got results right right with the anointing he struck a rock got results water came out the rock even though God didn't even tell him to do that he struck it twice and water came out amen amen that's how powerful the anointing is that if you if you do it you do you might get results Hallelujah you'll get results but here's the here's the problem if it's not according to the word of God you'll miss out on the promised land that's why Moses missed the promise then he had an anointing but he just did something that God told him not to do hello somebody we need to be careful about all these things let me let me the anointed ones at the end time let me read this real quick it says notice compare them together now when you get home notice Matthew 24:24 Jesus speaking and then it says Paul 2 Timothy 3:8 many others now and now compare that and uh and then put another scripture St Luke 17:30 Malachi 4 now he said compare them he says as Janice and jambre with stood Moses the anointed word for the hour Moses was the anointed word for the hour it says so will these men so can can I just can I just just let you all in on something I'm going have to let you in on something it is it is prophetic it is biblical for people to come against the message brother yes sir it's prophetic and it is biblical for people to withstand the message yes sir it's going to be a side to stand on you choose it's always been a side to stand on you choose which side but is biblical for them to withstand as as Janice and jam breze withstood Moses come on man the anointed word of the hour so will these men sir yes sir and look at what brother said not man men and you tell me we ain't living in that time that's a sign but I'm looking for the chief sign amen amen all right so will so so so so so as J as Janice and Jer withstood Moses the anointed word of the hour so will these men not not men men anointed ones they will resist the truth he says in the very day that the son of man is revealed Revelation 10 1-7 read it when you get home the seventh Angels message opening up the seals remember I told you the the Thunders amen we were we were taught that the Thunders were the virtues no that's not what the prophet said right where the Prophet said he said he says these Mysteries are contained in the seven seeds that mean all of those seals were the Thunders every time a seal was revealed a thunder was released a thunder was made known amen yes sir it just that's what brother bradam told us that's what we stand with yes sir praise God now look he says this he says um the seventh Angel's message opening up the seals what is it not the angel is the son of man now this is important right here this is these important statements not the angel is the son of man but the messenger is revealing the son of man sometimes people think that when we quote brother brandom all the time and and they got to understand this it's it's if I didn't quote it it would be plagiarism like like this was mine that that you know you you need to come to me and get this I'm telling you the source that I got this from is free is accessible to you as well and all I'm doing is just quoting what a prophet said in order to keep the church in line now he does not take the place of Jes the question was asked the question was asked do y'all see brother Brandon as Jesus on the same level as Jesus the answer is no he was a star in the hand of Jesus but if you want to know where we see brother Bram he's like a messenger like Paul right like Moses Moses wasn't wasn't taking the place of Jesus and and Paul wasn't taking the place of Jesus but yet they were used by him they had very unique Ministries and brother brandom had a very unique Ministry for this time that's all it was and let me tell y'all something else I I was thinking about this after I left here last Sunday I might as well say this right now CU I say we got to keep our head above the fanaticism and let me don't don't lose my place but let me say this I've had the opportunity to go to brother's brother brandom's grave multiple times I've gone multiple times and uh and one time I went um you all you all seen the video that's that's out there on social media whatever it was where somebody went to the grave and they they have a little rope there roped off and if you see a rope right what the Rope means right don't go across that's what it means don't cross the just stay right here don't go across the Rope but somebody on the video decide I'm going to go across the rope and then I'm going to just lean up against the grave and take a picture and they leaned up against the grave and out out out from the the pyramid grave that they have there uh here comes a dove flying right out of the Grave you can see it right there on the video and I mean they saw they kind of jump did it take that to tell you not to go across the Rope the Rope should have told you don't go across but even the supernatural there is grave right there's so many things I could say but I'm trying to I'm going try to get away because I know we have we we have to keep our head above the fanaticism I was there at the grave I was there at the grave and and I remember the Holy Spirit uh specifically speaking to me and I'm like I told youall before God don't talk as much as people say he talk but I I have some instances in my life where I know I've heard the voice of God speak directly to me and this was one of them where he where I heard the voice of the Lord say um now he says don't you lift my Prophet too high m he says don't you drop him too low all right right MH the Holy Spirit told me that don't you lift him too high and don't you push him too low so you want to know what I'm trying to do that's that see see the name of the church is spirit Spirit and truth yeah we welcome the spirit we we believe that yeah but we got to have truth you got to have a balance on this and see if we didn't have a balance then the message would be no good to us let me go a little further that chair you sitting in right now got four feet on it if one of them feet was missing just one one foot missing the chair no good you would not sit in that chair if somebody gave to your one foot missing like wait a minute what you you trying to hurt me and that's what people have done in this message they've hurt others amen because they got a few things missing amen but what we're trying to do is keep it all right there amen hallelujah somebody let me let me let me let me finish reading I'm I'm I'm I'm doing the best I can I'm running out of time amen I'm glad I got another year I I'm really in overflow mode I'm in overflow mode amen here he says not the angel is the son of man but the messenger is revealing the son of man can you get it separated now yeah that that's where it seems to be so hard for you you see not the son of man himself and we going to read Revelation I mean uh uh St Luke 17 in a little bit cuz that's what he just referred to let's look at some of these prophecies from Jesus we not just going to church to talk about fish and and and and and and bread right we there's more to this word than just fish and bread now that's part of it he wants to be your provider if you need fish and bread he'll give it to you but you know after he gave him fish and bread he was trying to break the really break the word with him that's but they they were so caught up on just the natural foot I'm trying to do more than that if if you can get what I got for you you'll be able to pray for your own bread and it'll break and it just keep applying itself because you you done contacted the source you you'll be able to figure out how to do this on your own without me even being present oh he told us if your brother needed rain on you can give your brother rain your sister needs something you can give it to them we know that kind of power but we got to get the word first yes sir let me let me let me keep reading can you get it separated now and I'm this is followup to last week really you know if you if you're catching me because I was telling you how there just a lot of stuff going on out there in our message is fanaticism I'm I'm going to be the first one tell you you going to find if you go trying to search this message on Google and who is brother brandom and who you go try to do it that way I can tell you the information you will find will be from Fanatics not from people that's that's actually right here you cuz we don't we don't even post stuff all we post is our services online right and you got to be following us to see that but we we we not we're not taking it and then sharing it with everybody hello somebody right we're not taking our sermons and sharing you need to see this you need we not doing that none of us do that here unless unless you're doing it with your family members right but but we we we don't have to promote it like that hello somebody if you see it you see it and somebody else share with you praise God but but we and and and but I know people check this sermon out right here no we don't we don't need to do that right you you don't never hear me calling nobody telling them brother I preach this you need to go back and listen to my sermon I have never done that amen maybe somebody asked what youve been preaching I well brother we've been in a series get back and step that I tell you that now if you want to go back and watch the videos they there for you to watch but if not it's okay look I can't keep up with all the preachers so I don't even try Lord have mercy I'm all out here now God and if your post is two pages long three or four pages long don't tag me I am not reading all that I ain't reading it I I see one paragraph I'm done you got three four five you got a whole book you done wrote no I ain't reading none of that I got 66 books right here that I read praise the Lord I'm just I'm just being honest with you I'm not reading all that I don't have time for it glory to God and the way that these algorithms work if they see you interested in this person then they're going to start giving you other people that got the same Spirit on them cuz it's a spirit that make people do that and it's not the holy spirit amen amen amen let me just keep reading can you get it separated now uh that's where it seems to be so hard for you see not the son of man himself but the seventh angel the seventh messenger is revealing to the public the son of man which is Christ all right it says because it's left the shook he can't organize it it's the grain itself again and it says and in the in that day Janice and jambre will withstand anointed ones make believer and unbelievers the church formal and the [Music] Pentecostals Lord this is so powerful the make Believers and the unbelievers this is J Janice Jamber is going to be able to kind of get them I heard brother Dennis McBride preaching yesterday uh it's many people that have an intellectual Faith but not a real spiritual Faith he said intellectual faith will not get you a healing he says there was people coming into the prayer line you know brother Brandon we got faith we got faith we got faith we got faith we believe God gonna do we believe and they just doing all this talking while they walking through the prayer line brother Brandon said I knew just because they said it I knew they didn't have faith and brother Dennis began to bring out say you want to know what what faith would do is what it really looked like it looked like the woman with the issue of blood that woman had no promise she had no example in scripture uh of what she was thinking about doing but she said if I could just Touch the Hem of His Garment then I know I will be made whole he don't have to say a word to me he ain't got to talk to me but if I I done went through this for 12 years but if I could just touch to him of His Garment and that woman begin to push this person to the side and push that person to the side and and all she did she reached something and she all them robes pass by she said but if I get him I'm done yeah yeah amen hallelujah Hallelujah turn to walk away her faith said that that's all I need he ain't got to say a word I know I got mine sir and as she turn to walk away Jesus stop yes sir amen say who touched me right right amen amen Peter Peter didn't understand this kind of Faith that's right that's right Peter say See Jesus look now we trying to follow you and everything but you can't be making statements like this in the public who touch you all these people touching you right Peter you don't even understand yet no you don't understand yet but one day Peter you're going to understand what I just said who touched me and Jesus just scanning the crowd yeah go yeah she sitting there and out of all them people he say you know you've been whole M and and and and as he just sitting there encouraging her it's like you know I I ain't really know what to tell you but I just knew that if if I could just touch the him of your garment I didn't know what was going to happen but he say virtue just left me because somebody touched me that was genuine faith when you a have no promise at all but yet you put your faith on the line that God going to do something for you genuine Faith am Hallelujah he he went on to share some other quotes how this this this one one lady in the s service one lady come talk about she had faith and she come on a c with crutches he said you got faith sis you got faith throw them crutches down and walk on out of here in the name of Jesus she said throw the crutches down sister I got to pray for some other people but since you couldn't draw your CES down you will have that condition the rest of your life my God and then a few few more people come another lady come up with some crutches sister you got faith throw them crushes down and and rise and be healed that lady threw her crutches down and walked out of their Hill see we we going Beyond intellectual Faith but we talking about something that's really down on the the inside that cause you to believe for the miraculous amen Amen Let me let me come on come on help me Jesus help me Jesus all right see that that's where it seems to be so hard for you see not the son of man himself but the seventh angel the seventh messenger is revealing to the public the son of man because it's left the shuck he can't organize it it's the grain itself again and in the days of Janice and jambre uh and in that day Janice and jam will withstand anointed ones make Believers and unbelievers the church for and the Pentecost will stand up against the True Grain but let them alone their Folly will be made manifest as theirs was see you understand now Revelation 10 said in the days of the sounding of the seventh angel now remember seventh Leia Church age that's why I read yeah Revelation 10:7 and Revelation 3:14 the prophet just tied those two together for us right it says Revelation 10 said in the days of the sounding of the seventh angel now remember the seventh Le Church age the sounding of that angel when that church age is done denominated and become a church age when it's done in its Pentecostal organization when the messenger to that what was each messenger what was Martin Luther a rebuke to the Catholic amen what was Wesley a rebuke to the Lutheran an to them lutherans what was the Pentecost a rebuke to them others so Pentecost was a rebuke to uh the lutherans as well as to the W the wesling which are the methodists John Wesley was not the founder of the Methodist Church John Wesley was the messenger during that age but it was the people that came after John Wesley that started the Methodist Church organization right right yes sir amen and so so so so every time God sends a man on the scene with a message John Wesley was a star in the hand of Jesus just like Paul come on somebody and just like William brand only thing about John Wesley Martin Luther all these guys were stars in the hands of very very unique Ministries that God gave them only only difference with Luther and Wesley is that they were not prophets they were reformers Hallelujah but a prophet comes on the scene and this end time as a chief sign to be able to kind of help us get back in line with the word this what the whole get back in Step we've gotten out of step with the word and now God's trying to get us back in step that's not just for you all sitting here in the church that's for people that's online that's watching and they they realize wait a minute this is much much greater much deeper and God saw all of all of christiandom God saw every denomination God saw every organization God knew all of that would happen and anytime you start talking to people about denomination they'll be first one that God ain't in that I know God ain't in that but yet they in it what God's trying to do is to say I got you got to have geese mentality you got to be ready that when it get cold go south and if get hot go north but you got to be willing to move amen CU if you're not willing to move if you get stuck you get lost amen and then you also got to know which which leader to follow yes sir am amen you got to know that amen right because there one them geese one time they got one leader he just got he just jumped up I'm I'm I'm going to lead this year but God ain't put it in him to lead and he took off and he went rather than going to Texas he took the geese all the way across the water to to London and when they got to London they were just dying yeah falling apart dying like what and then people start studying how did these geese get here we don't even have geese in London not like this how did they get here one leader decid to take them on the wrong Journey he didn't have what it took that's why you got to know what and look that's in the message what I just told you you'll find it in the message brother brandom said it search it you'll find it by that that them Gees ended up in London you better know who's leading you right you better know you better know it's the Holy Ghost that's leading you amen hallelujah amen look I I can tell you right now just everybody in here got a testimony as to how they came here and your testimony is not brother Jack called me up on the phone yeah and brother Jack just begin to encourage me and and he was just telling me and and uh and and and and just through the words that brother Jack said that's why I came let me tell you brother Jack can get you in right then somebody else can talk you out but if the Holy Ghost puts you in then can't nobody pull you out amen I ain't got nowhere amen but yet we going to try to finish up this all right amen it says here where where where did I Shu more shuck is graen um where am I what was this what was each me okay all right thank you what was each messenger what was Martin Luther rebuke to the Catholic what was the Wesley a rebuke to them Lutheran what was the Pentecost a rebuke to them others and when he talk what was Pentecost he's talking about ausa Street okay that's not the original Pentecost back in uh the book of Acts but this is ausa Street it says a rebuke to the mothers where has the life gone now where has the life gone

saying I'm I'm trying to get to uh St Luke 17 mhm but but when I when I get there we got to really talk about it we have to have to and and I and I'm going tell if y'all want to have just like a little family devotion this week and just you know talk about the word of God pull up St Luke 17 and just begin to read it and then begin to talk about it discuss it how this pertains to where we are right now this is a prophecy of Jesus so when I'm I'm telling you I am preaching Jesus amen Amen Let me let me read this and I'm going read I'm going just read the scripture but I I will talk about it later okay but here [Music] um um where was where has the life gone now away from an organization Lord this is this let me go back let me go what was each messenger now when we talk about each messenger let me make that clear Revelation 1 2 and 3 are talking about the messengers unto the messenger of Ephesus yes unto the messenger of Smyrna th uh I miss one of them pergamos um Sardis uh Philadelphia leod deia God sent a messenger to each AE and to the the age of Philadelphia the messenger happened to be John Wesley to the age of Sardis the messenger happened to be Martin Luther and even in the history books you see that there was something special about these men's Ministries they even history called that and brother Brandon was able to put it all together no these were these were the stars according to Revelation one these were the seven stars that were in the hands of Jesus each star was a man that had a message the very first star with the first message his name happened to be Paul how we know he was special how do we know he was special because he wrote 2/3 of the New Testament and and and and Paul was a Paul was something else now remember I told you we had to keep our head above the fanaticism you know what Paul said about fanaticism in his day he said if a angel I'm going try to I'm going try to make y'all get this one Paul said if a angel from heaven yes come and preach something different than this that's right let an angel be a curse now you mean a man going to rise up from the earth and say things different than what the prophet said my Lord I say the same thing Paul say let him be a curse amen we got to stay with this word above anything else all right don't matter who the man is right if the man is saying something different than what was written in the scripture especially by by Paul if you saying something different than what Paul said yes let it be a curse amen you know Lord I'm you know the the prophet I told y'all he went to the other side yes sir and while he was there on the other side there was bring he he saw all these people yeah he saw his he saw his dog saw his horse he saw his first wife he saw his daughter that died and his daughter walked up to him said God bless Bess you my precious brother his wife walked up God bless you my precious brother gave him a big old hug and he's like my what is going on here everybody God bless you my precious brother God he like and he asked the angel said are these all Brams no no no no no these not Brams but these are your converts see the lady walked up she's about 80 years old but didn't look 80 in heaven she was like about 21 she walked up gave him a h said God bless you my PR brother and said he said you want to know why that lady smiling so much because you led her to Christ when she was in her 80s my everybody's so happy see brother brandom coming through and and and and as he as he as he as he as he's um you know just walking he's like I want to see Jesus I want to see Jesus angel angel said well you know what you can't see him right now but one day he'll come to you and he'll judge you for the things that you preached on Earth that's right he says is Paul here yeah so yeah Paul is here well Paul have to be judged yeah Paul going to have to be judged and then brother brandom said in heaven will I preach am the same thing that Paul preached and then he heard a great sound the sound of many Waters he heard a great sound say we are resting on that I'm so crazy I am crazy I'm let y'all know I'm crazy my faith tells me I was one of them that said I'm resting on that and the reason I know that cuz when I came to earth when this came and found me I could agree with it my spirit man said amen hallelujah amen never been this way before never flew to Louisiana before but there's something about this yeah let me follow this lead geese the Holy Ghost leading a prophet to take us to safety amen thank God ooo Lord I ain't got time let me read this can I just at least finish the [Music] paragraph where I don't even know where I'm at right now I'm I'm so far out here the very day when this okay all right all right notice no what was the Pentecostal rebuke to the mothers where has the life gone now away from Organization no more shuck it's it's a grain what is it a rebuke to the Pentecost SE to fulfill [Music] Lord just the the words there just mean so much to me to fill the scripture this hour I'm I'mma come back but we have to understand there were scriptures pertaining to this day the coming of the Lord is just one scripture right how is the Lord coming it's a shout it's a voice it's a trump what is a shout what is the voice what is the Trump now I'm going to shock you if you've never heard this before the shout is this very message that I am preaching to you am amen yes yes [Music] yeah voice you got to be able to hear Beyond brother Jack's voice right yes you got to be able to hear Beyond me saying brother brandom say it you got to be able to hear beyond that because Jesus said my sheep hear my voice and a stranger they won't follow amen so the same voice that call Lazarus out is the same voice that I heard sister Bernice said he brought me out then she said he brought me in you can hear a message in the song if you just listening I mean where' she get that from she got a revelation he brought me out but he also brought me in brought me into what brought me into this messag amen amen amen amen the voice the voice of God has been calling through this message calling to his people to come back to his word then it said the Trump you know the same Trump that calls us out is the same Trump that calls Israel back in right right let me just put it this way this message that has been given to us to get us ready to leave is the same message that's going back to Israel how do we know yeah cuz there are two witnesses according to Revelation 11 now you you people have been fighting for years on who these two witnesses are I got to leave they fighting for years but the fight is over amen amen I remember me and brother fin talking to an uncle of mine he had been taught that one was Moses and one was Enoch I think or something like that and and people have been preaching that Moses and Enoch the two witnesses and and and churches have been divided over it but when God sends a prophet a chief sign he gives us the understanding how we know who the two witnesses are and the fight is over once you catch the revelation of how to know he said the Revelation was look at their Ministries when you look at Revelation I'm sorry uh Revelation 11 and you look at the ministry of Moses and the ministry of Elijah that tells you who the two witnesses are their Ministries are right there in the scripture even though their names aren't their Ministries are so now you can put the the pieces together the puzzle that's why we thank God for a prophet and that's why we have to tell you remind you what a the prophet said you don't just take off running with your own thoughts amen amen we got too many preachers going to the pull pit with their own thoughts brother your thoughts ain't Vindicated sir but the prophets are and God is the one that Vindicated them so tell us what he said tell us just what he said God bless you church I got to stop there for the day come back to that quote that that's that's what happens with the anointing I'm telling you telling you the anointing just help you see things that you you just didn't see and I don't want to be in that class that I got eyes to see but I don't see no I want to see everything God got for me and I'm going to walk to the fullness of my ability uh with this word amen let's pray father we thank you for the word of the Lord we thank you for the truth we thank you that you've given us eyes to see and an ear to hear what the spirit is saying lord it's so important so important to have an eye and an ear thank you God that I'm not going on my mama's ear and on my dad his ear but you giv me an ear that I can hear father not my pastor's ear the deacons ear the song leaders ear or Lord anybody else but you gave me an ear you gave me an eye God I thank you that you you had enough Grace uh for me Lord and sometime we take these things for granted we've been Gathering underneath the the message this enti message for years and the word that has been just given to us year after year week after week sometime we take these things for granted but Lord I know there are others that have never heard this before in their life like the geese they never flown South before but they know it's something about that message it's something about that honk and Lord when they realize there's something there they they they they begin to position themselves Lord to get ready for the flight I pray that people would position themselves to get ready for the greatest flight that will ever happen and that is the rapture of the church God any day now we'll be going home how we started the service Lord and just you just been all over this service even today God have we just watched just the way that you've done things we can we can feel your
