warriors out there my friend jen needs all the prayers you send her for for her newborn lilith lilith is currently fighting in picu right now and needs the lord's healing touch in her latest update jen said that the mri didn't show the results that they were hoping for they have had a tough couple of days making some hard decisions just trusting and believing the lord will touch and heal lilith and i'm asking everyone to join in that faith and the scripture that sister suzanne posted here was for where two or three are gathered together in my name there am i in the midst of them so we want to remember this request in prayer you can just imagine some other you had a little child like that that was in picu and just what it would mean to you and we just want to pray with a man just uh feeling a man and just believing that god would move on the scene for little lilith amen let's pray father we come before your presence and uh this request has come in there from sister suzanne and as a a friend that has just given birth to a child and god the child is in a situation where the doctors are just not giving it good reports and uh they just know lord that they need you to move on the scene you're the one that gave breath to this baby so lord we're accident you were intervened you would move god you we we know we serve a god that can go beyond the doctor's capabilities we thank you for all that they do lord but when it goes beyond amen them then we have we have an anchor we have an assurance we have a god that we can call on the scene so we ask that you would move by your spirit amen on this need even right now we send the word right there to georgia where they are and then between the baby amen the patient and the condition we place the blood of the lord jesus for you were wounded for lilith's transgressions you were bruised for lilith's iniquities the chastisement of little speech is upon you god and with your stripes we declare live heal in the name of jesus we pray amen amen amen praise the lord amen amen just get your bibles with me and we'll turn to a scripture amen on uh today so good to see everybody in the house of the lord and and uh our echo brother solomon's sentiments hope you all had a wonderful thanksgiving amen just so good good to be here um um i know it's something else i was supposed to announce and i it just slipped my mind uh i do want to thank the lord for brother aaron being here with us amen on today god bless you brother aaron good to have you amen praise the lord um so let's we're going back to uh this this scripture out of luke 4 and verse 16 through 21 we would like to read amen god is good appreciate the specials amen that was sung this morning and my uh when sister rebecca got it from playing i heard uh sister dassa just pick it up and just just carry it on i said well praise the lord it's just a dancer the lord is really anointing her amen and we we thank god thank god for her really thank god for uh certainly appreciate brother solomon and the song leading as well uh here in luke chapter four amen verse 16 says and he came to nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him they began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfill in your ears amen the lord had a blessing to reading of his word can we just breathe a word of prayer over um the sermon today and i'll let you uh have your seats here in a second father we thank you for the ability to be able to read the word follow reacts that the holy spirit would come now and make the word relevant to where we are that god that we'd be able to apply what we hear uh that we would walk a little closer to you that you god would just get glory and honor out of our lives uh forgive us for every sin and shortcoming be on our phone and see our needs in jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you can be seated amen um we want to continue amen our journey uh with this thought aired in spirit amen aired in spirit um i um i just kind of gave you a a a little definition a man on last week on this word air is simply means to be mistaken or to be incorrect um to make a mistake amen that's that's all it means and uh everybody in here um has erred at some point in time in your life amen there's uh we all make mistakes we all can be incorrect amen and and uh you know it's good just to admit when you made a mistake that's that's all god asked you to do you know just realize i made a mistake god and i need you and forgive me lord i'm sorry god amen and when you're apologizing to god you're you're not apologizing amen with the intention to leave and go do the same thing all over again amen when you realize you're wrong then you correct that wrong and and continue to do right amen from that that that point forward but to air is just to make a mistake to be incorrect uh uh on something so uh i wanted to just start us off with a little thought here from the sermon abraham's covenant confirmed amen just going to use this particular quote abraham's covenant confirmed brother branham makes this statement he says one more thing i want to get to the church amen and i said some of you sitting here lord jesus last night when the anointing struck me says i could feel them little flares in there i've been trying to think of it i jotted it down here so i wouldn't forget it i caught that last night that you think well i did do and uh i did so and so many times i find people won't even come in the prayer line and won't even take their number when they're called they're afraid that will be called up certain things so what he's saying here is that people have a prayer card uh in their hand you know it's difficult to get a prayer card you know it's a lot of people want to be prayed for and here you can be sitting there with a prayer card in your hand you have the opportunity to go before and and and and be prayed for by god's prophet just imagine that a a prayer that we know god hears god god gives visions to uh this man and i mean just so much anointing that people can feel the angel of the lord as they're walking through the prayer line and here you have an opportunity to go a man into the presence of the lord and have your condition dealt with but because you got something in your spirit you actually won't get up and go in the prayer line hallelujah bro brother branham is picking up something you know he's saying i want to deal with this you know because you know you don't you don't realize it but but sometimes amen the devil will play tricks on your spirit man amen the devil will play tricks amen and and get you all kind of what we call discombobulated in your spirit right and if you're not careful you don't if you don't know how to just kind of fight the devil with the word you you know you you have you thinking you never was saved you never was a christian you always been a fake you always been a phony you got to be able to tell the devil you're a lawyer i know i've been washed by the blood now i might make mistakes not willingly now i may make mistakes but i'm still saved hallelujah i'm still a christian amen and then give the devil a real mind battle after at the accused gave him a real mind battle be i mean like brother branham gave my mama say even if i died and the lord told me that i was gonna have to go to hell you know i'm still gonna serve him like this on this earth i'ma still go to church i'm gonna still worship i'm gonna still praise i'm gonna still do everything i can because this life better than any other life that the devil can offer me [Music] hallelujah so he says uh they're afraid that uh they will be called up certain things so they're thinking about things they mine i did this i did that i did then they're afraid that might be called out so they withdraw they don't go up into the prayer line hallelujah they won't go to the altar so now i used to blast that right out now look at this what the brandon said brother brandon said i used to blast that right out now somebody coming through the prayer line and they got a condition amen he said he used to blast it out now watch he says you all know that and not lest i'm actually led to do it i don't do that no more unless i'm led to do it i don't do that no more he just don't blast the situation out because see when a person's heir and they spirit you got to be able to try to help him look at this look at what he say now you will make your mistakes you say brother random no matter what i've what i'd ever do i'd never be worthy that's right you'll never be worthy he says but look you say brother branham at one time i didn't believe this message that's right i guess many of you didn't i wouldn't have done it i guess myself i couldn't have done it unless god revealed it to me oh glory to god unless god reveals to me says it's a revelation the whole church is built on revelation without the revelation you'll never see it you're blind amen jesus the church is built on revelation uh he says that the bible said i believe matthew 12 i believe it was it was uh where he said though jesus had done so many miracles before them yet they could not believe because isaiah said they got eyes and can't see ears and can't hear and and really holy people the very cream of holiness so holiness is not all he says holy living's not all faith is the main thing now he goes on and he keeps making a statement and this is just really something that blesses my heart says now listen church i want to drop this in there in here because i believe the holy spirit told me to do it you may be sitting there which some of you are i know you are he can detect he can discern right it says i know you are disagreeing with me right now now i can call your name if you want me to we talk about a real prophet i can call your name if you want me to so i know that but i also can see farther than that hallelujah that you're going to believe it one of these days [Applause] some point in time you gonna come to believe this so i have to watch my actions i have to watch what i say i have to watch how i respond to you cause some point in time that you're airing your spirit you're gonna come to an understanding oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah it takes a lot not to say something sometimes it takes a lot to keep your mouth closed sometimes right brother diggs you know he he got it from this church and he go around the world talk about he got this new ministry this new ministry that god gave him amen we all need to practice in this new ministry what is this new mastery shut your mouth glory hallelujah hey you don't know what it feels sometimes as a pastor you see things you just be wanting to just say everything but then you just you just can't sometimes god just won't let you do it just won't let you do it hallelujah glory to god look at what brother branham said says i can he says uh uh i can call your name if you want me to so i know that but also can see further than that that you're going to believe it one of these days so i'm just going to put this in so you understand so i can give you a little spot of grace i want to put this in so you'll understand and i can give you a little spot of grace oh that's powerful amen i'm giving you grace by not saying something amen hallelujah i i can give you a little spot of grace here when it ain't going to be too long till you're going to change your mind i i i hope but we'll hold on to this you know i uh the more and more people out here walking away from this word and it just it just really bothers my spirit people you knew that believe and there's some of them out there they still believe oh lord they just they don't know how to come back pride is what stops people from coming back now don't add to it with your actions don't add to it just love the people amen keep reaching out to them somehow just love them amen and look you're not there to try to you know change their mind and no no just love them just love them i'ma tell you one thing that i have noticed is that those that are staying with it they're able to still uh demonstrate love but typically when they walk away they actually don't want nothing to do with you you know why because light always shows up darkness praise the lord hey but i i i mean like brother branham said i can see somewhere down the line you're gonna come to this you're gonna understand this hallelujah you're gonna see it somewhere down the line i got the same kind of faith a true son of god and a true daughter of god they will come to it because they can't be lost that's a promise from almighty god no matter what you hear no matter what you see no matter what you experience god's word overrides all of that hallelujah you have erred in your spirit but you're coming to an understanding glory to god amen how you get there that ain't my that ain't that ain't me i don't make the way god do that amen look at what he said here he says uh amen um my says it says uh a little grace here a little spot of grace here when it ain't gonna be too long till you're gonna change your mind some of you some of you won't now which one are you leaning to i'm gonna take the one some of you will i'm putting my family in that some of you will hey man some of you won't but remember when sarah first heard that man where she is the type of the church when she heard that seeing that sign take place to abraham she actually laughed about it in her heart now i love the way he just brought that that type in sarah laughed and y'all might have some stairs in your life that's laughing but when you go to hebrews 11 11 sarah had faith and her name was written in the in in in the in the hall of fame of faith right hallelujah somewhere down the line something clicked and sarah something changed himself now the bible never recorded when it happened but we know for her to get faith to believe god not just depending on abraham's faith oh i like that brother and sister i'm not just standing on mama's faith and i'm not just standing on body's faith i'm not standing on pastors fake but i got my own faith my own experience with god [Music] something clicked somewhere down the line with sarah and she came to her own faith and that's why you know she believed that she can conceive even at an old age at first she laughed at the promise but at some point in time she came to believe it some might be laughing at this message but somewhere down the line they're going to come to believe it all right all right all right she actually laughed about in her heart and she disbelieved and doubted it ever being so is that right at that time god would have rubbed her name off is that right he couldn't he couldn't because she's part of abraham and the prophets say they're one woo what a promise what a promise bro i i i have had you know different ones and i'm a oh i'm gonna keep reading in this let me go to this next paragraph i i had different ones um have approached me about just some of my loved ones and they just man they just they just put my almost put my family in hell like there was no hope at all i said look you don't understand you're just dealing with a spirit that's all you and and when you're dealing with a spirit you can't use natural means to try to overcome a spirit but natural meanings have a argument all the time no that ain't gonna that ain't gonna hurt that ain't gonna help nobody that's only gonna hurt people that actually cause them to do more damage in on the inside right but but you're not going to take a promise from me if god gave me this i'm going to say what his words say no matter what your feelings are [Music] [Applause] right right so so but but but i've seen it like no no no no lord lord knows it's the truth people don't realize when you're dealing with a spirit you got to use love brother brother brother brother brother brother branham you know had this this little brother come to him say my wife got spirits and he actually he called them by name one named jeff one named seth and one named this he knew this he knew the names of the spirits he said they got this and they got that and you know she be picking at me when i go to church and you know she oh i thought you know you did issues with them holy rollers again and she'd just be going on and said i just get tired experience so i jumped up one time brother branham and i laid hands on him come out of her in the name of jesus i call them spirits out say they never came out he said that's cause you're using the wrong method if you want the spirits to come out you're gonna have to show some love to her you know you know brother branham you know used it both sides because for a wife that's trying to win a husband he have to she have to show love brother branham to give him advice try to cook his favorite pie kind of try to do this and try to do that and and watch how that spirit just come on out of your husband he's saying say what your what your wife like to do try to find out what she like to do and do that for her and before you know it the lady was delivered right but you got to use love you're using the wrong tactics that's why they're still in bondage you're using the wrong tactic use some love love love and i'ma tell you it's hard sometime to use that kind of love but the love that is seen you is the love that was in god for god so love the world that he gave praise god he gave his life on the cross that's the type of love that is inside of us [Applause] he says if you've if you've really not been excited not worked up in emotion not got some church creed but really received the holy ghost you're a part you're really a part of christ oh my and a little and still a little skeptic in your mind you will not sh oh i love this god will not shove you off from that because he can't you're part of christ you know i've even heard people say some people don't went cross the line you know what they say some of them went crosstalk and they can't get back now i don't know which i don't know where your line is but i don't i don't only god knows who can go across the line who came rather from what i read in scripture there was a there was a king amen in the scripture that that was responsible for throwing the prophet isaiah in half you talk about somebody across the line that man should have crossed you saw the prophet in half but later on the man repented and god forgave him of his sins so i don't know where the line is that people draw to say you cross the line maybe when they hurt your feelings they cross the line well that ain't the way it worked you know it's god that establishes the line what we do is keep preaching the gospel throwing out a net trying to grab somebody i don't want to see nobody lost [Applause] look at this it says you're really part of christ a little a little still a little skeptic in your mind god will not show you god will not shove you off from that because he can't you're part of christ he will bring you to the truth amen if you uh you might you you might have spoken tongues danced in the spirit and then all these things there that don't mean you got the holy ghost oh my that's a million miles from it jesus never did say now remember i believe that when you receive the fullness of the holy ghost you speak in tongues right but jesus never did there's no scripture in the bible says that the evidence of the holy ghost i want you to produce it if it is there's no such scriptures that scriptures that jesus said by their fruit you shall know them and the fruit of the spirit is not speaking in tongues amen that's a gift of the holy ghost hallelujah after the holy ghost has come that's one of the gifts that goes with him preaching speaking in tongues interpretation talks all those things are gifts of the holy ghost but what we want to see is the manifestations of the fruits of the spirit amen how would they know that we're christians by our love now i was saying this on last week and i just wanted to kind of go into a little deeper here i'm uh we're triumph beings we're made up of body uh spirit and soul and our body is controlled by five senses what we see what we taste what we feel what we smell what we hear that's what controls or dominates the body amen you get different reactions from your body based on what you see hallelujah what you taste can also generate a certain reaction from the body amen what you feel hey man you hit your your your your your finger with a hammer your body will the rest of your body feel it too and it will it will show a man what you what you smell generates certain responses and what you hear also generate certain things all right but uh uh i'ma go to your spirit amen uh that's controlled by things inside amen these are inner things and it's five senses there to your spirit it's your conscience it's your imagination it's your memory it's your affections and it's your reasoning amen and then this last part of your being the soul is controlled by either doubt or faith right only two two two two things there to control you the doubt of faith uh since we're talking about airing in the spirit let's look at the spirit part amen remember it's your conscience your imaginations your memory affections and reasoning now your conscience is what we call a inner feeling right amen or a inner voice right uh viewed as acting as a guide to the rightness or wrongness of one's behavior amen you have a conscience that's either tells you that's right or conscious said now you know you're wrong now some of us we know we're wrong and we're going to do it anyway and here's the other part that that that that just gets me you know you're wrong go do it anyway and then pray and ask god to forgive you you just want to say really come on now you you know you're wrong don't get don't keep going wrong if you know you're wrong stop somewhere make the thing right but everybody got a conscience let's say you're wrong now you're wrong you're wrong you're wrong now what happens like like this one man said he told brother branham and said that council's got like four points on it he said every time you do something wrong the importance just turn they just turn and so you can feel it on the inside and there's a certain feeling that just come over you it's it's hard to explain it but everybody doesn't had it it just you learn and you feel it and if something you say make that thing right but some say no don't you make that right you're going to get in more trouble right i mean but you just feel that thing turning and then eventually it just stopped turning and you don't you don't work yourself to a little situation where you don't feel the conscious anymore now you can lie and even believe your own lies [Music] right amen but that's what happened when you ignore that conscience hallelujah so so brother branham say uh you know conscience is one of those things that control the spirit the other thing is imaginations amen and what the imagination is it's the process of producing mental images your imagination actually produces a mental image you know now just i remember uh brother brother gatson came to preach for us some years ago and he was talking about how he would drive down a certain street and because of one experience one time he was driving down the street and he he hit a deer you know late at night coming across the street he hit a deer and uh and because he had that experience every time he drove that street he always thought i'm gonna hit another deer he preached fear the deer or something like that and he he just i said i'ma just i'ma just i'ma hit another deer and before you know it he get to the same spot every time with a new car he hit another deer and he didn't realize it but his imagination was producing producing the deer do you know your fears can produce certain things i believe the bible say the things that we most feared have come upon us right our imagination produced it that's why you need to think on things that are lovely think of things that are pure think of things that have good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things your imagination can affect the way that you act this other one is it's memory memory amen is the faculty by which the mind stores and remembers information the memory is the factory by which the mind stores and remembers information now you know sometimes you got to be careful with your memory now you you know you you're going to remember some things but there's some things you want to ask god to just kind of take from your memory hallelujah you you got us lord lord deliver me from that thought right there holly you don't want the devil keep taking you back in your memories that's why i'm very uh uh uh cautious about you know i if it's if it's me i'm just talking about me y'all can do whatever y'all want to do but it's me if god delivered me from a certain position in life and maybe i had pictures of what i used to be back there and then rather than show people what god has done you show god you show people what what what you used to be no don't give them a picture what you used to be tear those pictures up destroy those pictures because that was not the real you the real you is this holy sanctified person hallelujah amen and sometimes we think well i'ma just kind of show people where god brought me from are you really showing them who have you witnessed to with that picture right amen so so so memory amen is this faculty which demands stores and remembers information the affections is fondness love liking tenderness warmth devotion endearment care caring attachment friendship warm feelings now i had to bring that warm feelings at the end because all of us want these fuzzy feelings everybody's looking for warm feelings when they're involved in certain situations they're looking for a warm feeling your warm feelings could actually be the wrong feelings hallelujah somebody amen yo yo yo warm feeling that you feeling amen might not be the right thing it might not be according to the word of god amen i saw him and i had warm feelings but he ain't saved he ain't a christian he he ain't ain't thinking about knowing the lord and you talk about you got one feeling something the devil is trying to trick your feelings same thing with the young man well i think i can win her to the lord that that never have you out there so far you know you're trying to figure out how you got there because you was trying to win somebody so let them already be one to the lord before you mess with them but i just felt some warm feelings it's the devil tricking you amen amen that's affections right so so here in this this last one is reasoning the action of thinking about something in a logical sensible way right and uh and what we find from brother brandon tell us reasoning is god's biggest enemy right don't think about things from a logical sensible way when when you know when the children of israel were asked to go and march around the walls of jericho that was logical that was not logical it wasn't sensible at all but but when they did things in obedience they sought a supernatural miracle-working power of god so don't depend on your reasoning hallelujah glory to god these things can actually affect your spirit your conscience your imaginations your memory your affections your reasoning these are things that can affect your spirit now uh let me see here there's another little statement that i want to make here oh my let's go back to isaiah 29 oh yes lord isaiah 29 i read this this is where our thought kind of comes from amen out of this particular passage of scripture isaiah 29 and i'm reading at verse 22 it says therefore thus saith the lord who redeemed abraham concerning the house of jacob jacob shall not not now be ashamed neither shall his face now wax pale but when he seeth his children i love this when he sees his children the work of mine hands in the midst of him glory i just put myself in this right amen but when he sees his children the work of mine has in the midst of him they shall sanctify my name and shall sanctify the holy one of jacob and shall fear the god of israel look at this they also that aired in spirit that meant somebody was going to make a mistake but they also that heir in spirit shall come to understanding amen and they that murmured shall learn doctrine what a promise from god right and here you know i just want to uh uh just just another definition here i'm using um the strong concordance on this one uh to air is to wander uh to go astray also means to stagger right it can mean to wand about physically amen it's the wandering of the mind hallelujah as soon as you start going to a website to start reading certain information your mind has already begun to wonder glory to god and let me tell you something when you start feeding on it and you keep going back and you keep going back there's something else taking place on the inside that you don't even realize when you start entertaining people letting people come to your house to talk to you about what they believe hallelujah uh if they got if they got so much to say have them meet you with your pastor oh i i can just tell you right now i know many people that are erred in the spirit hallelujah because you know oftentimes when we when we say to say i've been studying it for two years that's the key word right there when you say that studying for two years that let me know you started you started out wrong you never got your pastor involved until you already made your decision [Music] oh i can go further with that you know one time in jeremiah's day they told him saying jeremiah go pray for us they brought it to the pastor they brought it to jeremiah he you know he's a passage go pray for us we want to know the will of god as to what we should do about this is what we should do about that jeremiah said okay now i'm gonna give you the will of god but y'all wait don't make no decision till i get back took him 10 days to hear from god god don't speak the way people say he speak people say they pray and then in two minutes they got an answer god don't speak that fast sometimes you gotta wait it out here jerry jeremiah went 10 days 10 days later jared come back jeremiah come back say now this is what the lord told me y'all don't do this don't do that don't do this and god gonna bless you they say uh jeremiah we thank you speaking from the devil so you know you know that didn't come from the lord that came from that's your flesh that's your feelings jeremiah that's the way we feel about and we're going to go do what we want to do jeremiah see you know what before i even pray y'all have already dissembled in your hearts so really the praying about it was just a a formality and this is what's happened in church you know oh lord have mercy my my wife told me something i'm getting ready to bring it out i wasn't thinking about bringing it out here dude but i i think it's gonna fit right here it's gonna fit right here it's gonna fit i one thing about this somebody was talking to my wife and and they had a friend that said um they met a man they want to live with this man christian going to church every sunday so no i you know i met this guy out of nowhere say i want to go i'm going to live with him so you know they didn't tell nobody what they was doing they waited waited and then finally went to the friend said you know what i want to let you know i met this guy and you know and i'm living with him so you living with him she said but i prayed about it she said you prayed about it say what you trying to tell me is that you prayed and god said this word for you not to do that but since you prayed god changed your mind just for you no see you had already decembered in your heart as to what you was gonna do hallelujah glory to god so just don't use the formal words i prayed about it that's just the formality we talked about did you sincerely pray and not only did you pray did you hear from god because you ain't heard from god maybe maybe this might be a mistake can i go a little further aries to wander go astray stagger uh misleads mentally and morally air is to mislead mentally and morally it's the wandering of the mind and when the scripture talks about they they murmur means that they they whispered now whispering's what take place you know nobody else don't hear it you just kind of telling me between one of you you and another person but but god hear your whispers god hear your murmuring god hear your complaining god hear all of that and you don't realize you know hallelujah to the lamb of god you know you don't realize sometimes something might be sad to try to help prevent you from making some mistakes all right i mean murmuring is backbiting glory to god that's what murmuring and everything is now i want to i want to just bring in a little little thought here because you know we can wander we can stray away we can do things like that here this message testimony testimony look at this now oh help us lord all right here the prophet says this i understand this is a somebody in the prayer line says i understand yes tomb is that right now now you believe let's bow our heads it says our heavenly father be merciful to this poor woman grant lord that she may be healed of this tumor and i ask you to be merciful granted that that that uh that here she's to have it removed maybe to die in the operation but thou art here father to remove it for her take all this from her help her now to be healed in the name of thy son jesus amen now here the prophet pray says it just don't leave now he prayed now he know not not even cancer supposed to stand before his prayer so he said it just don't leave just a moment it didn't leave her see you see it running on my hand like that satan in the name of the lord jesus come out from that from the woman it seems to hold everybody just keep your hands bound i want to talk to you now look at me do you live far not very far there's something the tomb is making an act some way but there's something causing it to keep it from leaving you believe me to be a person that's to work hard in life says that's that's what it is you you know that you know what you know that's right sister and now now what happened in between these these two sentences here brother branham revealed to this lady now he didn't call it out loud see remember i read the quote they say he don't do that no more only when the spirit lead them now when the spirit let him one time he had told some people saying now don't come up here with your sin don't come up here if you got city life don't come up here don't do that don't do don't come to the spread line with cindy like so this one lady you know she went up there and she had sent her life she she was prayed for and and brother brown i'm saying now um sister um um the reason you can't get heal is because you cheated on your husband you need to go make that right he called it out loud in front of everybody and the husband got upset he said no she didn't he got up out of his seat walked up to the prayer line like he was somebody you did what brother brown said i told you don't come up here if you ain't repented from your sin sir you just did the same thing to your wife both of them exposed just like that mac just gonna make things right and go back home so sometimes you had to get you know he had to do it that way but for the most part he'd just speak to you privately now that's what he's just done with this woman spoke to her probably now watching this you know that's right sister but you've had a desire to do that recently more than ever in the last two or three weeks you have you've been praying about that asking god if he take you back isn't that right one time you tried to commit suicide isn't that right that's right but now you've gotten away this thing's come to bring you back to the lord isn't that true i'm not reading your mind but i'm seeing a vision i want y'all to catch that sometimes things will be allowed to come into a person's life to bring them back to the lord i know quickly we want to just pray we don't want to see nobody suffer but before you pray just ask god lord are you using this are you using this in order to bring this person back to where they need to be glory to god amen it sounds cruel but sometimes that's the only way god can get your attention amen it's the truth anyhow that's sometimes that's the only way god can get you to stop and listen is when disasters strike you that's when desperation kicks in that's when you start realizing there's a god hallelujah you know some some one guy was telling me not not to say that as a joke but you know he said he didn't believe in god he didn't believe in god he believed in god at all and um and so he got into a situation where they say now he was out there hurting some cows they had to put put a rope around his finger saying that don't put that rope around your finger and try to pull that clap that cow that cow will take your fingers off he said oh i'm strong i i don't need to listen none of that he put that rope around the finger and that cow took off and he yelled oh god they looked at him say hey i thought you believe in god see i'm gonna tell you there's times there's times and situations that occur in life i don't care what people are doing i don't care what they say god got a way of allowing certain things to come into their life where they come back to the knowledge of truth and understanding so don't be so quick now i'm gonna pray this off no just just wait just wait just wait just wait hallelujah let's keep going it says this one time you try to commit suicide isn't it right that's right but now you got in the way this thing come to bring you back to the lord isn't that true i'm not reading your mind but i but i'm seeing a vision is that the truth will you promise then that you'll return to god and will serve him all your life and live will you will you promise it all right bow your head our heavenly father our beloved sister standing here who's who's once knew you and wandered away and now the secret scene of her life is revealed to her the thing that's caused her to wander away air air wander right the thing that's caused her to wander away and now down through that channel of time sometimes i'm gonna tell you when people air in spirit you've got to try to dig down and figure out what's caused them to wander i'm gonna tell you oftentimes because people been hurt internally this is why oh let me just finish reading this but this is why jesus come to you know to to uh uh bring deliverance to the captive it's an internal work that he has to do on the inside of you can i let me just keep reading this watch this it says uh says uh uh uh you you uh who who wants who's once knew you and wandered away and now the secret sin of life is revealed to her the thing that's caused her to wander away and now down through that channel of time days passed by you've come and revealed it to her lord lord i love this lord she's coming back i'm saying that i'm speaking it right now lord she's coming back lord he's coming back lord they're coming back will your receiver tonight right here at the platform a command commemoration and of the hour thank you father thank you god bless you sister your sins are forgiven your body is healed now go and sin no more it says all right sometimes you might wonder why those things are what does this the lady guess you can hear from here here uh you you could hear from here what she done when she was a little girl and the and and and then when she once knew god and wanted away from god and how it's about two weeks ago how she wanted to ask god try to get tried to pray and get back she never even come back to the full realization of christ till just now it would not leave her until first that was revealed to her and told to her then it left her and the tumor died and went away i just loved the way that worked here satan thought he had one under captivity but see once the revelation came forth then she was really free hallelujah then it left him and and the two men died and went away friends the almighty is here in his person jesus picked up isaiah and let's turn isaiah 61 this is what he picked up to read it was handed to him he turned in and isaiah and he found this and he picked it up isaiah 61. now we'll see a few different things here than with them than we see in luke 4 but nonetheless when jesus picked it up that day he was the scripture was being fulfilled here in isaiah 61 it says the spirit of the lord god is upon me isaiah prophesying because the lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek now um and then jesus didn't use those same words in in luke 4. but i i want to just kind of break this down it's preaching good tidings to the meek and what meek is defined is mild in temper and mild in manners it also means to be submissive so so so so so uh in order to bring a man to preach good tidings unto the meek somebody's gonna have to submit themselves to the authority of almighty god hallelujah amen this did this word meek means to be submissive hallelujah now now be careful you know uh uh we all got to learn how to submit to god amen and even even in our marriages amen there's still a level of submission that has to happen there too wives have to submit themselves unto their husbands hallelujah amen it's the truth anyhow church right but but when we get out of place that's how we start airing in spirit here look at what he said now the spirit of lord god is upon me because the lord has anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen you are heady and hearty and amen can't nobody tell you nothing god ain't got no word for you but if you can be meek and submissive have lamb like nature hallelujah you can get lamb like nature then god can speak to you we we we live in a in a day in time where everybody knows something everybody know i mean the young people know more than old people now you know ain't never been a day like this hallelujah ain't never been a day like i mean god called it young for one reason they strong and have overcome the wicked way but it called it all because they know the way their wisdom speaks [Music] you ain't gonna tell me hallelujah to the lamb of god doctor just coming out of school dr doctor just coming out of school and you have to go through a surgery but you got a doctor that's been practicing for 30 years and he's done this surgery many times but you got one just coming out never did the surgery before just got out of school standing next to the one that's been doing it for years which one you gonna choose daca maybe you can watch may you can observe i appreciate you doing all the study but i'm sorry this is my life and you go pick yourself a pastor that just got started and can i take you to the book of judges can i take you there because in the book of judges you know the bible say every man did was write his own eyes and that's what we had again today but also in the book of judges there was a a a woman that had a son that had an anointing in his life and she raised up that son to be her pastor following false gods led off into false religion and everything else and they almost got the family whacked out following them false gods airing in spirit all right all right i'm in the bible now let me keep on reading because the lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meat look you can't raise your own pasta you can't do that i'm gonna just tell you that right now jezebel tried to do that she had 450 of them but elijah was the pastor and god proved it when he answered by fire who the pastor that day was [Music] oh glory to god i told y'all this is the supreme power and control you talk about you talk about an anointing this is one of the most annoying sermons you've ever gone here all right let me keep going amen preach good tidings unto the meek the submissive ones he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim proclaim liberty glory to god to the captives oh i love this i love this proclaim liberty to the captives you know as i was just kind of uh pondering that how do we do this you know uh you hate to see people in bondage as a pastor as a minister i hate to see people in bondage but you know uh i was just thinking on you know on this statement brother branham told us that he was in a dream and in a dream he saw some people in bondage and and and some of the people said now brother branham we're good people and uh and we don't want to be in a condition like this he says i knew some of them they was real good people and and i knew they didn't want to be in a position like that and say he said while he was in the dream say the lord jesus came to him in the form of a light he says i'm expecting you to deliver the people hallelujah he said lord how can i deliver and say the bars that they're locked in are just too big for me i'm not strong enough to be able to pull these things to loose i'm not i'm not i'm not big enough to be able to get this job done god how can you put the responsibility on me god didn't come back and give him no more ideas not in his vision but brother adam says so i said amen i might not have the ability to pull amen this way but i can release some things out of my mouth that would bring amen deliverance to the captives he said so i said house of hell give way to the name of the lord jesus christ hallelujah says all the birds begin to break because he spoke the right word at the right time that's why we that's why the lord give us sermons like this we're looking to speak the right word at the right time to see god's people go free just looking at a little something there you know we look at i had a quote here and i'm not going to read it because it just it might be a little bit too much time but but uh uh brother branham said when god was ready to bring electricity to the earth he sent a man by the name of benjamin franklin and he gave him a man a desire to want to capture electricity and he said he said now there's something in the lightning most of us run from lightning but benjamin franklin had something to him say i'm running to the lightning and it took himself a like kite out there and he took a jaw something in it and he put it up in the air and he was just every time lightning strike he trying to follow it and then he finally got a little strike come down the string into the jaw and when he saw what happened to john he started yelling and screaming i got it i got it all he had was something strike his job but he knew was something more to it but that story when thomas edison read it he said now there's got to be more than what benjamin franklin got he's he got something in the job but we can't do nothing with it what he got in a job he says got to be more to this so thomas edison grabbed himself a cup of coffee he got himself some some sandwiches and he started just eating and drinking and eating and putting this wire with that wire and putting this wire with that wire and putting this wire with that wire hallelujah i hope you're with me i'm trying to put this quote with that scripture put this here and put that there i'm trying to do everything i can because there's got to be something to bring deliverance to the people thomas says and stay with it until he finally got the right wires all across going going in the right direction he got a good flow of electricity and now we can enjoy the lights and the ac and all this because thomas edison would not quit and i'm gonna tell you the truth i'm looking forward to enjoying all my loved ones i hey man this that's what the bible say that's what the bible say i'm looking forward to enjoying all my loved ones glory i ain't going to let nobody take the promise from me amen i read it but when he sees his children amen the work of god's hands in the midst of him when i see that glory to god i'm god i'm all right now hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah your prayer got to be answered at some point in time oh glory to god amen house of hell give way to the name of the lord jesus christ i get tired of seeing people bound i mean if that was just just running rough shot in some folk life how how did you get there you know i'm gonna tell you one of the reasons that we get to where we got because we don't we we don't realize how how powerful satan is you got to respect it don't think you just get out there and just do whatever you want to do you'll be you'll be messed up before you and the devil got one job steal kill destroy you got to run for your life don't just and don't keep playing with the devil i think i can just do this much no that that too much is too i mean that much is too much all right stay with me here the scripture says this the spirit of the lord god is upon me because the lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings into the meek it sent me to bind up the broken heart to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound look at this uh to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord and the day of vengeance of our god to comfort all that more now now now uh when jesus a man took the book from uh the minister and closed it all he did he stopped at the part where it says to proclaim except for you of the lord he stop right there and say this day the scripture's fulfilled and the reason he stopped there because the day of vengeance of our god was a future day that was a future day hallelujah glory to god amen but i love this look at what else he says it says to comfort all that mourn to appoint unto them that mourn in zion amen to give unto them beautiful ashes oh god we need this the oil of joy amen for mourning the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness amen that they might be called the trees of righteousness the planting of the lord that he might be glorified see i love i love this he wanted to comfort those that mourn this again this is internal things that are happening you know people mourn internally it shows itself externally but they and what they're going through that grief is something that's happening on inside god has to heal the inside amen oh hallelujah do you realize these are things that cause cancer in people but god has to heal the inside and let me tell them god can do some healing if you can stop your talking watch what you say i'm going to go a little further he's going to give conquer those that mourn give beautiful ashes to all of joyful mourning a garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness now um i want to give you just a couple more quotes here that woman had unconfessed sin in her life and it caused her to wonder cause her to air some people have that some people have that and it caused them to air amen in their spirit unconfessed sin can do that but i want to tell you that sin in the beginning caused adam and eve to wander away from the presence of god look at this out of the message fellowship listen to this quote when adam and eve separated themselves from god by sin separated them they become a wanderer see air air air means to wander they become a wanderer then no fellowship wandering about and weakening down now that's that's the key as you're wandering you're getting weaker and weaker and not even realize it spiritually weak right hallelujah you know there used to be a time you had a you had a a a no a holy conviction no i ain't doing that but then as you keep wandering you get weekend week and next thing you start getting involved in stuff that you never thought you'd get involved with right what's the matter with man today sin has separated man from that type of fellowship today we wonder how we're going to do this and we wonder how we're going to do that jesus said that he then seek after such things how we what we shall eat and how we should be clothed and and what we would do with this uh that or the other after all those things he says the gentiles and the unbelievers seek but your heavenly father knows what you have need of even before you ask him what a carefree condition now says why i got a little old brown-eyed girl down there while she jump off the fence down or anything she don't care as long as i'm standing there she says daddy pick me up she's just carefree i thought oh god if i could just be like that just carefree a few days ago brother joseph encouraged me a lot watch this statement i've seen a lot of stuff rising up in the churches that should not be oh well i i i just seen where i had to go out and stop it all myself it's what the prophet said you know i see all this stuff rising church i'm going to be the one to get i'm going to put a stop to this see even when i'm coming when we're coming to the pulpit we can't come with an agenda i told y'all this sermon i had since 2019 i have to wait on god to give me the release when they preach certain things amen look he said he says um uh um i was gonna cut out it says uh i just seen where i had to go out and stop it all myself i was gonna go out and say this can't be like this and this can't be like that can't do it because you're going to spoil god's program you're getting stuff in here that shouldn't be in all this and i knew it was wrong scripturally wrong and i'm supposed to stand here oh i began to find myself getting a little kind of off the line getting bitter i stopped out yonder on that and began to pray even a preacher got to pray got the guard in spirit you don't understand how ministers got the guard and spirit you know brother brother branham even had to guard himself against his own son one time billy paul was just joking too much and he joked and said something about his daddy hair piece or something like that he was just joking and and brother brother had to get up and walk away and uh and and like daddy i'm sorry i said son it's okay i mean me you joke like that say but you offended the angel that time you offended the angel you ain't offend me you're offended the angel of god that's why you got to be so careful church look look at this it says you're getting stuff in here that shouldn't be and all this and i knew it was wrong scripture wrong and i'm supposed to stand here oh i began to find myself getting a little account off the line getting bitter i stopped out yonder on that and began to pray and joseph come down said he said look i just read the history of martin luther and the question was that they didn't wonder about martin luther able to protest the catholic church and get by with it but what the wander was with martin luther is all of the fanaticism that followed it he raised up out of all of it that's the main thing then i heard that christ said what is that to thee follow thou me this bless me this bless me rather than you know when you see somebody aaron spirit it's very easy to just start picking on but here the question that comes to come when you see somebody in spirit you ought to just show love and pray for what is that to thee what is that to thee follow thou me right don't don't don't don't don't get into an argument and and all this no what is that to thee they they they god's clay and he makes a vessel of honor and this that's god's claim what is that to thee what you need to do is just follow thou me amen amen what is that to thee follow thou me i'll take care of the rest of it that's not my job to do it it's god's job to do it but my what my job is just stay with this word that he's given me oh blessed be his holy name he told me those that are aired in spirit they're going to come to an understanding and those that murmur they shall learn doctrine so what is that to me follow thou follow thou me what is that to thee follow thou me i'll take care of the rest of it you just go ahead and follow me that's your job that's the way it is then get then get back to carefree again oh hallelujah church when we're just doing what god called us to do we can get back to carefree again i can i can be like like he was talking about his daughter just want to just jump and she see her daddy standing there i ain't got no problem jumping into the arms of my daddy i know daddy gonna catch me i know daddy gonna keep me from getting hurt i know daddy gonna do it she had a carefree attitude when she was playing god wants to have a carefree attitude when we're worshiping stop worrying about whether they're going to come or not they already here but you just worship god and you just love them you serve them the way that he's called you to serve him what is that to thee stop complaining stop crying what is that to thee follow thou me we don't pick it we don't pick our tests and we don't pick our trials we just say lord i thank you let me give you one more quote and i'm probably going to bring it bring it home here oh i i did want to say this before i get there my oh yes i got to see this when we talk about being heir in the spirit i think the prodigal son is a a person that we can look at in scripture that aired in the spirit but pride is one of the things that caused this prodigal son to wander away from his position and the bible says this in proverbs 16 verse 17 through 19 the bible says this the highway of the upright is to depart from evil he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul look at verse 18 pride goeth before destruction and in holy spirit before fall so you got to stay meek you got to stay submissive see a holy spirit goes before a holy spirit you can't tell him what to do is the truth anyhow amen don't have a holy spirit when it comes to the things of god amen pride goeth before destruction and our heart is spirit before fall better it is to be of a humble spirit and with the lowly than to divide the spoil with the proud hallelujah now uh when i i looked at this this just a little definition when you say pride goes before a fall this proverb uh that we just read it says if you're too conceited or self-important something will happen to make you look foolish if you are too conceited or self-important something will happen to make you look foolish we got to have a the right spirit let me read without money without price and then the last quote that i want to read is coming out of mother's day without money without price uh this this prodigal son i believe had a hearty spirit he had air and spirit and something did happen to him that caused him a man to look foolish when when he was out eating the slop with the pigs and uh realized when he was in that condition that run out of money he realized when he's in that condition that my daddy my daddy's servants live better in a way i'm living out here let me just go home and be a servant and when it came back with that attitude glory to god when it came to an attitude then he could be raised to his position but his heart had to be right he had to come back submissive look at this the prodigal son enclosed and i might say this when we waste when he wasted all his living the father's living with riotous living and when he was returning home he was laying in a pigpen and he comes to himself and he said how many higher servants my father's got that is enough to spare and here i am dying for won't what if he tried to say wonder if i've got some money i could pay dad back what i spent right spent spent and running with but he know the nature of his father and said i will arise and go to my father oh look at this look at this watch this statement the father never said wait a minute son are you bringing my money back no no no he never charged them for his sins oh they come in i'ma have something to say to him i'm a hat this is the scene i'm a hat no no no no no no somebody else in their spirit don't you charge them for their sins don't charge them stand there like the daddy you don't owe me nothing but to love me no he never charged him for his sins he was glad that he was coming back he was glad that he come to himself because he was his son he was he was his own child he was glad he was on his road home now he didn't endorse his sin but he was glad when he come to himself and said i have sinned before my god and before my father i will rise and go to him and when he saw him far off he ran to him and kissed him and he said kill the fatted calf without money bring the best rope without money bring the ring without money put it upon his finger let us eat and drink and be merry but this my son was lost and is now found he was dead he's alive again let us be happy about it church i don't know how this gonna happen but all i know is god told me they also that aired in spirit shall come to understanding and they that murmured shall own doctrine how that's gonna happen that's not up to me to figure out but i know what god said in his word you can make a mistake but you can come back let me finish with this quote out of mother's day oh i love this then as we see him and we will not be as we are now we'll know how to love him more we'll stay we'll not stand back with a little fear because we'll be like him well he will be more of a relative to us than he is now we'll understand him better because we're so far away in the mortal bodies then we'll have a body like his glorious body we'll know how to worship him and when we see what the presence of his being has done to us changed us the old back young all the deformed straightened out oh we'll understand then why his power healed us the questions that's been in our mind how can he do it what would this somehow mysteriously they'll all fade away the knots that's been tied in the back of our minds will it be this how could it be somehow another majestic fingers will just untangle unravel those knots and it'll fade into one big crown of love then we shall see him then we shall be like him then we shall worship him then we shall see mother as god wants her mother would not be complete there without her family because the greatest time of all her life is to see her children around the table and all of them healthy and happy and to see her pour the coffee and whatever she does and fix his supper and her and dad sat down well that's the happiest time in mama's life now there's something about this because mamas used to get to the point when kids were growing up and especially we would we would eat my eat eat them out of house at home we ate so much me and my brother but uh but you know they get tired all that cooking but when they when them kids leave home something kick in with mama and she want to know what this one like and what that one like she's going to make sure everybody got exactly what they want when you come to the table i want you to sit down and enjoy yourself don't be so quick to leave just just sit right here the happiest time in mama's life to see her kitties all at home now don't miss this don't be missing that day let the great chain of your family be hooked together linked by link let every spoke in the wheel be in the wheel and then when we sit down with our families and groups across the canopies of eternity and now look look at what he just says when we sit down with our families i ain't going to let nobody take my family [Music] if they air their spirit that's all it is they just in spirit they're gonna come to an understanding but i'm like i'm looking to sit down on the other side with my family then he put it this way in groups that means we all included him my family your family we all linking together sit down on the other a man sit down with other with our families and groups across the canopies of eternity what a day that will be then we'll understand it was him who promised this in revelations 1 where it said that a sharp to it sword went out of his mouth he was called the word of god and it was the it was it was from that same lips that said i am he that is alive that was dead and i'm alive forever from those same lips in saint john 6 30 it says that i will lose nothing but i'll raise it up again at the last days was him that made the promise those same precious he's the one who saves us who heals us who redeemed us and and who will raise us up at the last day look at it if you are that little link little weak link that that has separated this great family reunion at that day may the god of heaven this morning oh we got we got families separated because of this word we got it that way we realized that but i told you like ben franklin and and thomas edison they they kept trying to they got something you know what as ministers we're going to keep trying till we get something that penetrates the heart to get people in their place with god if you're the little weak link that has separated this great family unit that day may the god of heaven this morning not next week not next year this morning somehow in a mysterious way unravel those little knots that's tied in your mind that's your spirit and reveal to you the love that he has for you and may you come sweetly submissively humbly meek man you come sweetly to serve him this thing about doing it for mama this ain't about doing it for daddy this ain't about doing it for pastor it's about doing it for you i believe i believe that god is here that's what he came to do is to recover sight of the blind and there we read it earlier uh in luke four and let me just give you these these things that he said that he would do and i believe he's doing this he's anointed to preach the gospel to the poor that's those that are poor in spirit is sent to heal the brokenhearted preach deliverance to the captives recovering of sight to the blind set at liberty those that are bruised and they preach the acceptable year of the lord which is the year of jubilee i thank god and i declare by faith this is a year jubilee amen they also that aired in spirit succumb to understanding and they that murmured shall learn doctrine the lord had a blessing to his word as we've heard it today let's just pray man father your word is real and we're grateful for the promises that you give us we can hold to your unchanging hand remain faithful god even when things are going against us don't seem right don't look right don't feel right all five senses are speaking one thing and then even those inner senses and the spirit starts speaking something else but god down on the inside inside there's a soul controlled by doubt or faith we choose to believe the word of the lord and every promise that you've gave us satan we say that you're a liar and there's nothing you can do to stop god's word from being fulfilled so we read the testimony of the lady that was standing to be prayed for and just seemed like the devil would not leave by satan staying it allowed us to get more of what was there we realized lord that when it was revealed to her about lord what she did as a as a young kid and how she walked away and wondered from the presence of god but on that day she made a declaration that she was coming home god let this be a day of declaration for somebody that i'm coming home maybe a a a conversation that they have with you maybe they admit lord yes i've erred in spirit i've heir but you gave me a promise god that i would come to understanding let majestic fingers even move now in our minds of god and unravel the knots that have been tied [Music] god we don't know how you do it but we know that you will do it [Music] we commit ourselves to you commit our situations
