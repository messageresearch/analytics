[1:13:44] sure we've got time if you know on I

[1:14:59] observe the month of I did and keep the
[1:15:04] Passover unto the Lord thy God for in
[1:15:08] the love of a bit the LORD thy God
[1:15:10] brought thee forth out of Egypt by nine
[1:15:14] that's how therefore sacrifice the
[1:15:18] Passover ensue the Lord God of the
[1:15:21] flocks and I've heard watch this in the
[1:15:24] place which the Lord shall choose to
[1:15:27] place his name then you can receive just
[1:15:34] the thought that it kind of come on bit
[1:15:36] yesterday be crucial before but it just
[1:15:38] sit there know
[1:15:39] yesterday this really came strong only
[1:15:41] so this is what we're going to do this
[1:15:42] morning all right
[1:15:43] or preach a message this morning I want
[1:15:45] toilet the police for God's name the
[1:15:50] police for God's name I just for a
[1:15:52] minute I want to do a foundation because
[1:15:53] I you know I don't believe that there's
[1:15:55] any word of Scripture that is written
[1:15:58] just to be written all right I don't
[1:16:01] think that it was written by chance but
[1:16:03] I believe that every word of God is for
[1:16:06] a reason I believe every word the
[1:16:08] brother Branham said it's for reading
[1:16:10] another thing we didn't say this when I
[1:16:12] found this message
[1:16:14] the search was over all I remember when
[1:16:17] I found this message there was no more
[1:16:19] looking I'm not looking for another
[1:16:21] message I'm not looking for another
[1:16:23] project I got what I needed I got what I
[1:16:26] want everything I have full rapture give
[1:16:31] me and within this book one of the word
[1:16:35] enough the times wider he say observe
[1:16:41] the month of so the month of Abib is the
[1:16:48] first month but how much of a bit is the
[1:16:53] fourth month all right you see what I'm

[1:45:33] on a few ground rules that he was doing
[1:45:35] he said but let me tell you one of the
[1:45:38] biggest reasons I am we're on that and
[1:45:40] why our company is worth that he said my
[1:45:44] assistant is the best in the company
[1:45:50] online and he was saying before the vice
[1:45:53] president the president all these people
[1:45:55] in the company and he said my assistant
[1:45:58] and this morning I was going through
[1:46:51] some things and I came here and the Lord
[1:46:56] gave me a message
[1:46:57] this is last year in October I went home
[1:47:02] and I preached it and see every every
[1:47:07] person in this church is important
[1:47:08] whether you think you are like I said
[1:47:11] I'm slowing down just to get really from
[1:47:14] him
[1:47:15] you're important whether you feel if not
[1:47:17] I preached this message at home
[1:47:21] and I call though Jackie told him about
[1:47:23] it when we got through my pastor said to
[1:47:26] the book didn't he said now once again I
[1:47:28] was young sorry talk about me okay
[1:47:29] but my pastor was the book that he said
[1:47:32] I've never heard anything like that
[1:47:34] before he said that his maturity he said
[1:47:39] that men could speak to that bad has
[1:47:41] built this church so I called rojak I
[1:47:45] said well Jack I got to tell you this
[1:47:46] I'm going to give you some credit I said
[1:47:50] I preached the message at home I put and
[1:47:51] people are still to this day coming up
[1:47:53] through their telephone that message and
[1:47:58] I called Oh Jack I said I got the
[1:48:00] inspiration set in your office and until
[1:48:03] you have it then you want to preach a
[1:48:07] note it was just a load
[1:48:24] [Music]
[1:48:33] [Music]
[1:48:37] okay she loves me back be still and know
[1:49:16] that I am God yeah you know when you
[1:49:19] take that word you searched me but I
[1:49:22] know I do a little bit like this when
[1:49:26] you break it down
[1:49:29] but at Scripture we just take that word
[1:49:32] and it says this piece of your beating
[1:49:35] you in your place for you to be in that
[1:50:03] [Applause]
[1:50:10] [Applause]
[1:50:38] [Music]
[1:50:55] [Applause]
[1:51:21] [Applause]
[1:51:31] [Applause]
[1:51:53] this course many an array about the
[1:51:56] Spirit of God they are the sons of God
[1:52:00] where you have not received the spirit
[1:52:02] again a bondage again to fear but he
[1:52:07] have received the spirit of adoption
[1:52:08] whereby we cry oh man I never even heard
[1:52:21] that songs when we started out the old
[1:52:36] so the spirit itself bears witness
[1:52:39] without fear that we are the children of
[1:52:41] God and if children then heirs heirs of
[1:52:44] God and joint-heirs with Christ you sent
[1:52:47] me that we certain reveal that we may
[1:52:48] also be glorified together what I
[1:52:51] recommend the sufferings will just read
[1:52:52] the time I was going to be compared with
[1:52:54] the glory which shall be revealed in us
[1:52:57] and we're sufferance is misfortune
[1:53:00] calamity the afflictions listen to this
[1:53:04] that Christians don't brood for the same
[1:53:07] cause which Christ feared he said why am
[1:53:13] I going through this affliction the same
[1:53:15] reason he did why they spitting in my
[1:53:18] face the same reason they didn't email
[1:53:20] why am I being crucified on the job
[1:53:22] crucified it's true everything around me
[1:53:27] for Giovanni because he was who survived
[1:53:30] will bring a resurrection in your
[1:53:33] personal life the sufferings of this
[1:53:38] present time are not worthy to be
[1:53:41] compared with the glory and that we're
[1:53:44] glory says it means the kingly Majesty
[1:53:46] of the Messiah God most around you has a
[1:53:53] king and you should worry about with a
[1:53:56] hemophiliac Rahman you still wonder if

[2:10:54] let me handle it more when he wins dick
[2:10:59] Malaya

[2:11:06] that's the one this will be pleased we
[2:11:15] look too much at this we see this fall
[2:11:19] we see this failure God's looking at you
[2:11:21] and saying you are Prince well who is a
[2:11:26] prince a child of the king I'm gonna try
[2:11:32] one of their relations for ones that now
[2:11:35] I say that that error as long as he is a
[2:11:38] child differeth nothing from a servant
[2:11:41] don't meet the Lord of all understand
[2:11:46] when you just in that stage of challenge
[2:11:50] you are still Lord of all let's come on
[2:11:56] to work with us yeah somebody raise your
[2:11:59] hand it feels like you uh you're the
[2:12:02] weakest Christian in the church
[2:12:05] everybody any goodness the one who
[2:12:13] raised your hand alright your Lord Baal
[2:12:20] [Music]
[2:12:22] you wanna word this one you go to the
[2:12:25] bar I said I feel I feel we took me
[2:12:30] alone I feel about you
[2:12:32] our Lord o all power is within you see
[2:12:43] here's the thing there's no authority
[2:12:44] there because of the child but
[2:12:48] everything is yours but is under tutors
[2:12:53] and governors until the time appointed
[2:12:55] of the Father even so we when we were
[2:12:59] children were in bondage under the
[2:13:01] elements of the world that was this guy
[2:13:04] this guy was bound
[2:13:18] you know some made of a woman made under
[2:14:19] the law to redeem them that were under
[2:14:22] the law
[2:14:23] now that was Jesus lady was Jesus again
[2:14:28] there goes the bullet sometimes 1963 he
[2:14:31] put a little man in the photo see
[2:14:33] anything clear time was full run out and
[2:14:37] was little man back there ever again for
[2:14:40] what the law written through the halting
[2:14:45] other a real word and because ye are
[2:14:51] sons God hath set forth the spirit of
[2:14:56] his son into your hearts cry well
[2:15:07] somebody say ah I am no more no more
[2:15:12] I'm certain this ain't work you ain't
[2:15:18] coming to church and it being work you
[2:15:20] and chemicals
[2:15:59] [Music]
[2:16:42] he said when you knock apart the blood
[2:16:45] and what if Jesus Christ were dead God's
[2:16:48] chosen place of worship
[2:16:49] he said safety live only in the place of
[2:16:52] his choosing in the Lamb and in the name
[2:16:55] of the Lamb no it was a Maryland man he
[2:16:57] got a fair amount of church see when his
[2:17:00] name not her name what was he going to
[2:17:03] meet the people with under was now in
[2:17:05] her name but in his name the way
[2:17:09] rejecting this message is rejecting your
[2:17:12] sacrifice rejecting your land but he
[2:17:18] said that the provided place of worship
[2:17:21] was in Jesus and yeah I don't know if
[2:17:25] y'all placing it back here but not in re
[2:17:27] right now we're facing where they say no
[2:17:29] more suppose Jesus he goes to the Father
[2:17:34] forgive me for dime not to use but
[2:17:36] that's I thought really Ukraine was like
[2:17:47] so appalled leads down the trial right
[2:17:50] hold up her dog I know where it goes but
[2:17:57] when Jesus come to his adoption he
[2:18:00] looked at him and he said when you see
[2:18:02] me you've seen the father
[2:18:09] it was when she just come to the place
[2:18:12] of adoption the only body on earth that
[2:18:18] God was dwelling in
[2:18:20] was that woman so when that man was the
[2:18:24] only living representation of the Spirit
[2:18:27] he said when you see me you've seen the
[2:18:31] father
[2:18:31] alright gonna move I thought y'all kind
[2:18:34] of with over the time so when a man
[2:18:41] marries a woman he places his name upon
[2:18:46] that woman so if I was to say when
[2:18:52] you've seen me you've seen my day all
[2:18:57] right
