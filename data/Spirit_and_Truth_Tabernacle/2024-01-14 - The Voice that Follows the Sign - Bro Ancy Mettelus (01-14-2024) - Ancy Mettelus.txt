Amen to make it through this this season amen amen God is good as brother Felix was saying yesterday just pray that through death somebody would receive life amen and and that's that's that's uh you know um for me I I look at it as an opportunity just to kind of share Christ uh with those that are just not thinking about uh they got to leave this place one day and uh and and and yesterday the question was asked um in in the eulogy you know uh what has life taught you there's a man the doctors told him that he had cancer stage four and he was dying and in his late 60s and his brother asked him said what has life taught you what lessons have you learned and he said what lessons have I learned I don't nothing I I I don't know what you're talking about so you ain't learned nothing and All These Years of Living what have you learned and he says I I I couldn't tell you he said well I learned I learned something I learned that after you leave here you going somewhere else and you need to be prepared for where you getting ready to go to and uh and if you're not prepared I'm here to help you get prepared you see so I think it's always an opportunity to talk to people uh when you're going through things like this get them closer to Christ amen it's very very important that to get close to Christ we need to be ready because we never know when our day is coming amen but we thank God for all things praise the Lord praise the Lord so keep all these families Amen in your prayers uh uh during during this season amen appreciate the special from Sister Shonda as well amen God bless you uh this morning we have uh brother ancy is going to come and and Minister for us and it came you know I guess it was last year pretty close to last year but he came and it was a blessing to us um uh T there with brother Jean Amen in in uh in bton beach and uh at bride of Christ Tabernacle it's so good to have him his family amen with us his wife the children praise the Lord amen uh his his son oldest son brother Henderson will be doing the interpreting for us Amen on today and then um you know brother Henderson recently got married amen him and sister MC Jenny amen uh decided to spend life together and uh praise the Lord amen and um I simply wanted to take this opportunity because I don't get too many opportunities like this but uh we we had the privilege of going to uh their wedding Amen brother Henderson and sister MC Jenny and uh as we were sitting there uh in the sanctuary and and waiting for her to come down the aisle my wife noticed her dress and uh my wife said uh that's that's the way to do it that's the way to do it uh just uh a beautiful dress holy dress nice and holy I want to just put emphasis on that because it's unfortunate that and I'mma put these quotes up like this Holy Ghost filled people get Unholy on the day of their wedding I don't know why that happened and it shouldn't happen and parents don't let you you you be out there shopping with them don't don't let them get Unholy on the day of they wedding it's an embarrassment for the pastor to have to stand there and marry people like that hello they don't wear makeup never but on wedding day they feel like they can put on makeup this showing that showing you don't dress like that that's Unholy but not sister MC Jenny we said praise godj we were we were rejoicing in our seats when we saw her walk down out and I'mma tell you amen I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm making it public if you need somebody to help you pick out a dress called sister MC Jenny praise the lord we were blessed cuz you don't you don't get a chance to say that too often and and I'm going tell you it's your testimony is on Full display on your wedding day you can say whatever you want to say that you got this and you got that but what you come out with show what you really got they say what's in you going to come out and it come out on your wedding day praise the Lord amen you got to be guessing is what can't like no pictures and nothing well you y'all know I got mad yeah we know but my God Amen hello somebody not sister MC Jenny I'm telling I'm going set up a business for sister MC Jenny I was blessed to see her dress blessed to see the dress all right all right but we thank the Lord I just I had to take time and just publicly say that from from my heart and my my wife's heart we appreciate brother Henderson and sister MC Jen that was that was a blessing that was a real blessing amen I mean the the rain came on that day they had a beautiful beautiful beautiful little venue set up for everybody and that rain just come and try to destroy it but it can't destroy the marriage amen and and and we just thank God but I but what I saw I was blessed by and I'll always remember it amen I thank God for it so amen we're going to get out the way we're going to let uh brother ancy come and he's going to minister in his own special way uh today we look forward to hearing what God has to say to us let's stand to our feet amen let's sing a course to this song as he amen prepares to come once was but now I'm found oh was blind but now I see come on sing it Amazing Grace I want amen amen amen amen may the Lord Jesus Christ richly bless bless you amen I say happy Rapture this morning we are already in the Rapture the Rapture has three phases the first phase is manifested that means we've already begun amen amen I want to remind you this morning a man did not call you the Lord Jesus Christ himself the god that created the heavens and the Earth he's the one who called you let yourself go in his hand amen he said let him Lead You may the Lord bless you you may have a seat amen we say Happy New Year in the Lord we say Happy New Year in the Lord because the world will never get better it'll get worse and worse but if you are in Christ you will have a good year amen amen amen why is that because the the bride's vehicle has no reverse it can only go forward we don't look at ourselves but we look to the Lord Jesus Christ the size of the God that he have called you trust in him I'm happy to see everyone who's here our precious brother Jackie we appreciate he's open up his Pulpit for us we take that very seriously because the bride in general is the bride of Christ am but in each local church brother Jackie here is the is the spiritual husband the leader that is why I never understand how a minister the husband let you in says you can come forward and you come and create chaos you cannot come and create chaos so we thank the Lord every minister in this message we are a unic we watch over the king's bride amen every true Minister we watch over the king's bride that's why I tell the Beloved at Boon the greatest gift you can give us is when you live what we preach that's the greatest gift all the ministers want to see that that's why this morning morning pray for me the subject that the Lord has placed upon my heart sometimes I want to lean towards a teaching of it sometimes I want to preach it sometimes it makes me a little uncomfortable because there are certain ministers God can give you more than one gift amen that's right but the fullness is in Jesus Christ but it can happen God can give you more than one gift but there's one that always shows more amen so may the Lord richly bless you I greet you in the highest name the mightiest name the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in that name I greet you we know time is moving forward let us stand we'll read together we thank the Lord last time I came here now we have an extra one you know what I mean brother Jackie spoke of it sister M amen it's as if brother Jackie was there the next Sunday after I made the commentary to the church I appreciated the Simplicity and the humility that they had and there's one thing that I said it's as if in the weddings of the message churches the people tell God let me try being a pagan but just for the day I'm not leaving you behind completely but just give me a few today is my day I have to show out I'll get back I'll get back to you it should not be so it should not be so the word says let those who sanctify themselves be Sanctified more that means it's what's inside that will reflect outside amen amen gory amen no we won't give the devil an inch when you give him an inch the devil doesn't overtake you that quickly he T he starts with the little inch and little by little until he completely takes you over in this message the seals have been broken you know what the seals mean is unmasking the devil the devil is unmasked we know what the devil is now we can serve God even better that is the goal of the seals to give the bride rapturing Faith that's why the message is here amen may the Lord richly bless you let's read let's read in Exodus praise God Exodus chapter 4 verse 1-8 Exodus 4 verse 1-8 and Moses answered and said but behold they will not believe me nor hearken unto my voice for they will say the Lord have not appeared unto thee and the Lord said unto him what is that in thine hand right he said a rod he said cast it on the ground and he cast it on the ground and it became a serpent and Moses fled from it and the Lord said unto Moses put forth thine hand take it by the tail and he put forth his hand and caught it and it became a rod in his hand that they may believe that the Lord God of their fathers and God of Abraham and God of Isaac and the god of Jacob has appeared onto thee and the Lord said further more unto him put now thine hand into thy bosom and he put it his hand in his bosom and he took it out behold his hand was leprous as snow and he said put thine hand into thy bosom again he put it into his bosom again and plucked it out of his bosom and behold it was turned again into his other flesh it shall come to pass that that they will not believe thee neither hearken to the voice of the first sign they will believe the voice of the latter sign amen amen may the Lord God add blessing to the reading of his word we ask brother Jackie could lead us in a short prayer amen praise the Lord father we come in the name of Jesus we thank you for the word that has been read to our hearts today but we know it takes the Holy Spirit to make the word live so use your servant brother ansy father even right now hiding behind the Cross May father you give him Spirit spoken words from Heaven to speak to our ears today and our hearts it's in Jesus name we pray amen amenah thank you brother thank you brother Jackie amen bless you you may be seated I want to tell you this morning that God he has a way to operate he has a way that he operates and he has never changed because he is God he cannot change you and I we can change you and I I can promise something to you and I'm unable to respect it but that's not the god that we serve the god which we serve serve he is mighty he he didn't get stronger over time from eternity from eternity that's why this morning we can trust in him because he's proven it to us when he says something will be done he does it nonetheless but we must be vigilant when the Lord calls you just forsake yourself into his hands and do not try to wrestle with him let yourself go and you will see his goodness you will see how Mighty he is amen if we could title this what we're going to talk speak on the voice that follows the signs and as a subtitle what kind of believer are you that is a subtitle amen amen are you with me brother brandom says the sign always attracts a crowd God through the sign signs the signs are to capture your attention to let you know that God is here that's what the signs are for that's why it's difficult to convert a Muslim you can't show up to them and tell them accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior you see the example Billy Graham went somewhere and they challenged him because many Muslims read the Bible many read the Bible they say this man you speak of the word says those who believe in him these are the signs that shall follow them brother Bram says I don't know if you ever read it he said Billy Graham is guilty the reason is the gift was there Billy Graham and brother Bram they were contemporaries they lived in the same age in fact but the brandom says Billy gram when he saw the supernatural manifest through brother bram's Ministry he said he must go to Sodom and tell them that time is here that means God gives the gifts to the church Billy Graham should have called them God gave the gift that's right some have the gift of healing God never call anyone to be worthless no no God doesn't call anyone to be worthless if you're here in the church if you believe you will be sealed with the Holy Ghost and once you are sealed with the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost will lead you to what you ought to do don't just sit you cannot just sit no you must work for the Lord sir believe the word you can't show up to these Muslim countries and say accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your Savi no you need to show them Jesus Christ so that Jesus is not in the grave you must show them this morning speak of a Jesus in history we speak of Jesus Christ the Christ that was crucified that still heals that still saves that still delivers amen amen that is the Jesus we speak of that is manifested in this end time in the form of the spoken word amen amen that's the form he has right now amen amen the voice that follows the signs Glory the signs are just a part of the message right right what did John see John being a type of the Bride he says swallow the whole book he didn't say true he said swallow if you choose something you'll taste it if it's bitter you'll spit it out he said swallow it if it's a truth just swallow it do not reason with the word God didn't even ask you to understand he said believe he said believe I spent a few days at school method there's something called the scientific method that means a problem is presented so you need a solution so you start to collect data they start to observe and then then they do trials for example a vaccine until they accept it God doesn't work that way God says believe the word that's all he says later on he will reveal to you why if God says it if it's a truth from the Lord this morning your job is believe it we are completely different from science amen that's why in Eden the devil disarmed Eve he gave her a PhD from then men have been guessing they left God behind they're guessing through science until science proves that Jesus Christ he's the answer Jesus Christ is the only answer Corona virus it proved that there is only one hope for this world that is the Lord Jesus Christ it was always Jesus it will continue to be Jesus nothing else it's a medication that's the medication the world is rejecting right now that's why this morning I present you Doctor Jesus amen he's the one he's the one answer to every problem that can deliver you this morning no matter what condition you find yourself in Jesus can set you free Jesus can heal you amen amen no matter what stage you are in sin no matter what stage you are in your sickness the Lord Jesus Christ drct Jesus look to him take the prescription what is the prescription by his stripes we were healed that's all it is by his stripes we were healed amen amen amen amen the voice that follows the signs let's go back to Exodus 4 verse 30 we can start in verse 29 Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the Elders of the children of is Israel and Aaron spake all the words which the Lord had spoken unto Moses did the signs in the sight of the people continue verse 31 and the people believed when they heard the Lord had visited the children of Israel and that he looked upon their Affliction and then they bowed their heads and worshiped so what do you see here Moses met the angel he gave Moses a mission Moses had a calling that was true but he got ahead of himself and he started he tried to start his ministry a bit too early you may have a calling you get ahead of yourself and you fail wait on the Lord there is a time for all things that is why a minister growing up you need to grow up through an assembly you must have a church you must persevere somewhere you must learn order you must learn to accept exhortation otherwise you will go through every assembly and only cause chaos and you won't even be aware of it you need to have an assem that raised you you you have a calling but you must wait that God himself he gives you the time to start and you start at that time Moses got ahead of himself that's why he ran away from the people so now if God sending him back to the people he need to have something different he needs a sign to manifest in front of the people so that then the people verse 31 what does it say and they believed when they heard that the Lord has visited the children of Israel and that he looked upon their Affliction amen they bowed their heads and worshiped the people believed what did they believe in here what did they believe in they believed in the sign but that's not all God wanted that's not where God wanted to stop God wants to move forward take them all the way he calls you there's somewhere he takes you from and there's somewhere he's taking you he's trying to take you somewhere God knowing this very well this is the sign did this same group of people it says here in verse 4 verse 31 it says the people believed the people believed right there's something Apostle Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15 I believe verse one let's read it you'll see where I'm going preaching is to take the people somewhere and land somewhere else you don't just come and say words preaching after the Beloved leave the service something must set in there's a lesson that must set in don't just speak words it's led by the Holy Ghost take the people from somewhere and bring them somewhere else closer to the Lord that is the goal of every teaching and every preaching the people they believed and they bowed and worshiped let's look at the exhortation Exodus 23 Exodus 23:20 and then we'll go back to First Corinthians Exodus 23:20 behold I send an angel before thee to keep thee in thy way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared you see I send the angel before you to protect you in your way this morning did you call yourself God calls you you know what brother says even if you were to get sick until the Lord is done with you even if the doctor gave up on you your cancer is past the limits until God is done the devil the devil cannot take you before your time I want to tell you to trust in God a man did not call you don't look at your own weaknesses don't look at your own faults God chose you and he chose you on purpose he chose you the word says those he chose he predestinated predestin predestinated to do what is right yes Hallelujah but you must eat you must believe the word and take God at his word he exorts them here the message has protection only if you believe it only if you live it the message has protection he says bring to bring thee into the place which I have prepared the word says when I come Jesus Christ says this will I find faith on the earth will I find faith that means you'll be tested upon every word that you hear and every word that you sing you'll be tested on it that's why the brandom says every Son of God must be tested and tried that's why God is not going to catapult you into heaven no no you got to go through the path you got to walk through the path and you must pay the price there's a price to pay yes yes there's a price to pay he says if one would follow me let him take up his cross that's why this morning your first husband you need to die to him and then let God work with you the world was your first husband you can't love God and still love the world your first husband your first nature it needs to die right even God Israel was his first bride he didn't violate his own word he took the form of a man and he died after he got up he chose a different bride you see because once he died he fulfilled the law that means he couldn't be living when he came he told the disciples go only to the to the Sheep of Israel he wasn't he hadn't died yet because he came to his own bride but then his bride crucified him the Jews crucified him with with their own Bible in their hands They Crucified him he says well I died now I have the right to choose a different wife amen amen the word says He chose among the Nations a new people that carries his name that is why we inherit all things in Jesus Christ amen amen a Sanctified life that is your inheritance the holy spirit that is your inheritance a life that is consecrated that is your inheritance healing is your inheritance we inherit all things in Jesus Christ that is why also you if you want to serve the Lord you need to die to yourself the old husband must die that's right amen amen to bring thee into the place which I have prepared verse 21 21 this is the exhortation the warning beware of him and obey his voice what what must they obey the voice not the signs they believe the signs they saw the supernatural and they still died in the wilderness why they believe the signs but with believing in the signs they still died why you need to listen to The Voice you need to listen to The Voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him but if thou shal indeed obey his voice and do all that I shall speak then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies and an adversary unto thine adversaries he says here he promised to destroy multiple Nations he will destroy the other nations and he will give others in Israel's place that's why it says in Isaiah 43 he says why do you live Israel because I have given others in your place why are you living this morning Jesus took your place that's why you still have breath because you should have went to the cross from your birth from the crib you are guilty of his blood yes am born condemned even a child a child has never seen a lie spoken but nonetheless we always say this a parent always has another child that is called I don't know SF who did this I don't know I don't know call the other one who did this don't know I don't know that's why this morning both adults and children we all must be born again amen all must be born again amen you see what he says he says verse 24 Thou shalt not bow down to their gods nor serve them nor do after their works but Thou shalt utterly overthrow them and quite break down their images verse 25 and you shall serve the Lord your God he shall bless thy bread let me tell you something any father of a home you don't have to wait on your child to say they're hungry to know you have to feed them that is your responsibility as a father that is your responsibility the responsibility of a father God promised them this this is what he's promising them he will bless their bread and the water you must listen to The Voice not only will he bless their bread and their water what does man need you need to eat you need health right I would say these are the two most essential things and he promised it to them right here the Bible tells you that even the shoes on their feet was not worn out even their clothing was not worn out at night God through the cloud projected he through the cloud he gave them light in the night so that they don't live in darkness he gave them electricity he gave them light in the daytime the blazing sun and there was a cloud that covered them God owed them protection because he called them he will take care of them he will take care of you the problem is when Jesus Christ said when I return will I find Faith don't tell me you believe this message and you work three jobs and you don't spare a day to come and worship and you say you believe you say you believe you have no time to worship no time to read your Bible but you say you trust in God when I shall return will I find faith on the earth that's what he says let me tell you this morning the word says it is impossible without faith to please the Lord all things that we do we must do it by faith we're Saved By Faith we're healed by faith all that we do we do it by faith you want a job you take it by faith isn't that right you need you want to M get married may your faith provide you your spouse a husband or a wife Facebook it's not on Facebook you got to publicize your body I'm single I'm single I'm looking for a boy and I need a boy or I'm looking for a girl or I need a girl you have no faith Rebecca was at home and her faith brought Isaac to her will he find faith on the earth everything you do is done by Faith by faith means I trust in the Lord on his word I trust in God through his word amen verse 25 I Will Bless thy bread and thy water and listen to this and I will take sickness away where you see the promises he's making didn't Jesus make you the same promises but what's the problem when I return will I find faith on the earth faith on the earth who can believe these words who can believe in what the Lord is saying in the end time I will take sickness away from the midst of thee there shall nothing cast their young nor be Barren in thy land you want children may my faith give me children my faith will give me children I remember there was a brother in my assembly that I grew up in in Haiti he spent many years not having children seven eight years after marriage every time he eats he put a little a little table a little chair next to the table he said what he wanted he said I want a son he said my son will be called Joseph he said little Joseph come and eat with Daddy he spent years doing that his wife had a child a son he called him Joseph now Joseph is eating with daddy that is the problem for us Christians today they don't really believe that is the problem they don't believe see Peter Peter spent all day fishing in one spot Jesus came he said Master where you're telling me to cast The Net that's the same spot I've been doing it all day okay all right but on Thy word but on Thy Word on Thy word I will cast The Net in the same spot sir on Thy word Glory beloved it's very easy take God at his word and you will be blessed for it you see the exaltations they receive what was this this there were the signs but when they got to the part of the voice let's look at what the prophet says the voice is let's look and see we have some quotes we're going to go a little bit quicker in this message called the token March 8th 1964 we'll lay a foundation and then we'll move forward we'll read a few of these quotes paragraph 72 see there was a message just before the taking out out of the church there always has to be same now everything spiritual spiritual happening is a sign from God do you believe that congregation says amen like the message there is a sign and then the message follows the sign the sign is not the message but the message follows the sign I see many preachers in my experience that shook all the kingdom of hell that had gifts of healing that preach under anointing and then later on they then Deni the message I've seen brothers and sisters sing in the Spirit Worship in the spirit and then later on when the voice starts to speak they deny the message so that brought me back I said let me look in the old Covenant let's let's see what happening the people believe the sign and we read that but they all died once the voice started to speak they didn't believe but it's the voice it's the word of God that's what was going to get them to the other side you see let's look at what he says here every spiritual happening is a sign from God do you believe that like the message there is a sign then the message follows the sign God bless you Sister Esther yes God told Moses if they won't believe the voice of the first sign that's what we just read maybe they'll believe the voice of the second sign what is God looking for he's trying to capture their attention so that he can speak to them he's trying to get your ATT the signs are just to capture your attention the PS are an attraction and brother brandom says this and the message possessing the gates of your enemy paragraph 69 he says I'm waiting for something better higher that's not just discernment he says I'm waiting on something I know it's coming I'm waiting on it you see that's why if you look there's nowhere in the Bible that seven angels visited the Earth all at once only in our generation that brought forth a message you had the two pools one angel came when the seven Angels came down to bring forth to reveal and bring the message it took seven angels that's never happened before that's the message you have right now seven angels visited the earth when they took brother brandham something came into his hands he says this is the sword not the sword of the king King not the sword of a king the sword of the king that is the spoken word that will give the bride rapturing Faith that'll give the bride what rapturing faith yes now when you see the signs going on and no message behind it just the same old theology you see what does it say if if the sign is going on and there's no message behind it just the same old Theology and on down what does that mean that's just denominations what is it just another denomination you'll understand the evidence of the Holy Spirit but makes it very clear is when you can believe the message for your day not even love believing right a brother let me tell you something do not be deceived don't let the devil deceive you sanctification is very close to the baptism of the Holy Spirit just because you live a Sanctified life does not mean that you you've made it because sanctification is very deceiving you can see a brother making mistakes but in his heart he truly believed the message 100% that's why theand says the evidence of the holy spirit is not the fruits of the spirit the evidence of the Holy Spirit I have the quote here let me see if I can find it don't have a message I don't have a message but I believe the message the message comes from God if I come here I have a responsibility of telling you the truth the reason being brother M says I'd rather you be angry with me today but be happy with me when we get to the other side on the other side and you don't have to call me a deceiver when you come here when you come here you're not here to hear what you want to hear you're here to hear God speaking through the servants that were chosen the foundation of the world said the fivefold ministry were there before the foundation of the world which is different the nine gifts of the Spirit that can have because of your consecration because of a certain spiritual atmosphere but a five-fold Ministry but Brom says they were preordination before the foundation of the world but the brandom calls them the army of God the five-fold ministry I won't have time to read that part he calls them the army of God they watch over the enemy they watch from the enemy God will place ministers here place a pastor here to watch over your soul the the duty that we have is to put the devil out he'll come he'll show up he'll be here but the one thing you must have the spoken word so that when he's here he can be paralyzed and he's unable to operate who would have told you that Judas would be in the Church of Christ see in every Church brother brandom says there is three types of Believers three types of Believers don't forget what I'm showing you what kind of believer are you let me make it clear the whole group left Egypt I was going to read the quote I know I have it here but the ROM says the evidence of the holy spirit that someone has the Holy Spirit when they're able to believe without a without any doubt the message for their day that's why a sister was Disturbed she was saying do I have the Holy Ghost or do I not but the BAM says he called her by her name sister so and so you know he's the prophet he discerned her he SE that it was bothering her do I have it or don't I say sister you have it do you believe the message for your day amen that is the evidence that you are sealed with the Holy Spirit let's look and see let's go to Exodus 12 we're going to move a little quicker Exodus 12 verse 37 the subtitle is what kind of believer are you and the children of Israel journeyed from Ramses to suth about 600,000 on foot that were men besides children and a mixed multitude went up also with them and flocks and herds and even every and even very much cattle okay here around 600,000 but the M says once you count the children and the women how much were they two million but there's a group here they went into the Exodus but they weren't called by God and it says here verse 38 called them a mix group mude that's what it says a mixed multitude they were baptized like because they went through the Red Sea like everyone else they were baptized they were baptized the word says they baptized in the name of their Liberator which is Moses Moses they were baptized and kept moving forward you'll see this group is the first group to start to complain start to murmur and then they infected the children of Israel they got infected this these are not true believers there were unbelievers that were baptized but they're sitting in Moses Church they're the first one to start the complaining they start the revolting sitting in the assembly did God call them no no but they say they believe they were baptized they went through the Red Sea they even ate the Mana they even ate the Mana they were being benefiting from all the protection when the sun when God became the cloud they're protected from the Sun at night they had the pillar of Fire they benefited from all the blessings but there were unbelievers in the church they didn't believe but now kept moving forward the children of Israel got infected they also started to take part of the complaining and then they started to rise up against Moses against the orders the the Commandments that Moses was giving to the people let's go to numbers 11 numbers 11 verse 4 verse four and the mixed multitude that was among them f austing they started it they started it and you see later on and the children of Israel wept again and they started to revolt so now the reason this is the worst thing that that you can do doubt the power of God th the word of God they saw the Miracles they saw the Lord deliver them so if you're hungry just go back to God speak to God brother brandham says when they got before the Red Sea they didn't even have they didn't even have to pray you pray when you don't know God's will the word came out God said he's going to take you Egypt and lead you to Canaan so that means so any obstacle in between you and Canaan he said why do you cry speak you must speak because you already know God's will so if you get in front of an obstacle that obstacle shouldn't be there just speak speak we you already know the will I said you're going to Canaan so anything in between you and Canaan whether it's a sea whether it's other nations whether it's problems whether it's hunger just trust in me you already know God's will the word says it is not the will of God that any should be sick but the sickness can come because of sin or maybe you didn't do anything if you're sick you check your life and you're good just know you're being tested if you're sick and it's not because of your own sin you're living a Christian Life just know you're being tested and exercise your faith exercise your faith because on the other side those who will go to the Rapture you must have a testimony not a single person will be raptured with no testimony if you didn't know that I'm letting you know today no one will be raptured without having a testimony because only Overcomers will go that means I was in a battle it could be a battle against a sickness and possessing the gates of your enemy it can be a battle against a sickness or a battle against my own personality when you ask the Lord for patience you ask him for more tests if you ask God for temperance it's a more test why is it that when the test come you all you do is complain why do you complain he says you say you want to like the statue of a perfect man he's not going to catapult you into heaven Overcomers you must overcome sin overcome sickness overcome vices in every age if you read up Revelations the end of each chapter to them who overcome to he who overcome in every age all the church ages in Revelations to he who overcomes that's the end so I'm telling you you must overcome Leia that's why God gives you the anointing of an eagle not just any eag a flying eagle not just any ego ego in the air that's the anointing you have amen you see here now you'll see that even the 70 that receive the spirit of Moses and also prophesied they all died too 70 ministers they all died too when it come to the point where they have to go explore the land they chose 10 10 ministers only two actually believe the message only two believe the message what was the message Canaan whatever what I see with my eyes in Canaan God already spoke God said this is ours and he gives us the land he gives us the country so what more do we need to believe are you believing the Giants or are you believing God Giants that your eyes see that's the problem today we have to see it no trust in God take God at his word when I shall return will I find faith on the earth because the rapture you must have faith Enoch had Faith that's what it says a man of like nature born of a woman just like us and then he had believed his Rapture so much in his generation there were many things happening in the generation of Enoch mixed marriages many things on the earth going on you see and he overcame everything if you tell me you have faith you must overcome sin until I can see you overcome sin overcome the world overcome the vices of the flesh then because we're saved by faith if we're saved by faith we must live the life of someone who is saved live the life of someone who's saved so you see here they set out they saw the land they even came with evidence of what was said of the land what God Said is true the land exists we have evidence of its existence and they still didn't believe God they still didn't believe when they came then they went to the assembly to preach 10 ministers bringing 10 reports they disturb the people they taught the people something contrary and then an uprising came they up they tried to uprise against Moses to the point two other ministers they said be still be still let's read it let's read it Exodus numbers numbers 14 yes okay does MH numbers 14 the unbelievers is people the mixed crowd the unbelievers they came in with the with the children of Israel and then the make Believers is those 10 among the 10 people that Moses chose they believed a separate message and they were teaching the people a separate message and the people lost their faith and they didn't make it million two out of two million million two out of two million that must mean something to us today I don't know how much time we got to get to the New Testament we're going to go fast two out of two million that's how many believe the message Mo Moses believed it Moses didn't make it not because he didn't believe because he didn't listen to the voice of God his anger issues but how many made it two out of two million that left unbelievers was among them there were make Believers among them because they saw the signs they believed at some point they believed in God that's why Paul told Timothy he says watch over yourself and watch over your teachings because when you do that you save yourself and you save those listen to your teachings Paul said that to Timothy there's a quote that I didn't read I'll read that one let's read this quickly brother bradam explains you what the voice is scriptural signs of the time April 10th 1964 yes we're going to finish I'm trying to put it together I'm trying to close because I want you to learn something this morning paragraph 23 say for instance his denominational voice followed a certain sign God never sent that we've had denominations all these years it's got to be something different when I hear a preacher say I stay with the Bible I put brandom to the side I'm GNA stick with the Bible you always had the Bible you always had the Bible said all these years you had your denominations but now something must be different glory to God it's got to be thus said the lord it's as if when they say this brother brandham doesn't preach the Bible beloved beloved did it say to know if someone's a prophet you got to find it on Google as Siri his brother Prophet his brother Bram the prophet is that what he said I go even further even the Bible even the Bible even the Bible will not say such and such is the prophet let me give you an example the adulterous woman the ill Fame woman when Jesus Jesus started to speak with her she stopped She said Lord I perceive I perceive did she Google it did she read it in her Bible no no God reveals himself to his people that's why you're sitting here let's thank God for the revelation Revelation is worth more than gold Revelation is worth more than silver Jesus told Peter blessed are thou Peter not because Peter won the lottery Christians shouldn't be playing the lottery anyway you need to have faith the lottery is not going to solve your problems you need to have faith everything you need take it by faith he said blessed are thou Peter because Flesh and Blood did not reveal this to you you see did Peter read it in a book to know who the person in front of him was Jehovah on the earth did he read that in his Bible you see today if you read what people say brother brandom on YouTube or I don't know where and that's what's going to make you accept it or not you're just confusing yourself Revelation is personal when you when you have a revelation you don't waste your time revelation will help us know God's will what pleases the Lord by faith Abel offered an offering that was more excellent a more excellent sacrifice we're not guessing we are people with Revelation people who don't have a revelation they waste time you don't see what can does he was tired he climbed every tree in the garden to pick out every single every single fruit uh mango Apple because he doesn't know which one the Lord wants if he if God doesn't like this mango he'll take this avocado if he doesn't like this avocado he'll take this coconut people don't serve God this way you serve God by faith what is Faith it is a revelation a personal revelation that's what faith is what you see to finish it's got to be thus said the Lord in the scripture God got to promise it by the word then a sign is to attract the people's attention to it the sign is to attract the attention and then the voice follows the sign that's the doctrine what's the voice the doctrine the doctrine will make you lost it will also save some I will take one example in the Old Testament let's go to Deuteronomy 7 Deuteronomy 7 starting in verse two we can start in verse one to save time we'll start in verse two this is one of the things the voice started to say which is the doctrine do not go into mixed marriages mix unions the day that they did it tens of thousands died that very day they failed to listen to The Voice Moses already told them if they have unions with these other nations you see they will die and they didn't just do it that easily that simply it was from a minister bam he taught them this you see God said this God does not like mixture that's why make sure it's your faith that gets you a husband or that gets you a wife through the word when you go to the New Testament as I finish Jesus started healing with a healing campaign isn't that right and a great multitude is following Jesus in John 6 let's look at that John John 6 can I get five more minutes a great multitude follow Jesus through his healing campaign I'll quote it for you I won't read it brother Bram says he says the people always want to accept the sign and then reject the voice voice of the sign the voice of the sign March 21st 1964 paragraph 206 you can read it yourself he says once the signs come you become you become popular right mtit a multitude followed Christ because they're seeing the signs healing where were all those people when they crucified Christ not a single person took a stand for him thousands of people where were they and then they got hungry Jesus multiplied the bread and the fish Supernatural in the manifestation that's still not the voice they continue to follow him in fact they even wanted to make him King they say man if this man takes herod's place we'll never go hungry again that means in regards to eating that's taken care of why are you here this morning what brought you here this morning you must come with the right intentions the right motive when you come into the house of the Lord to worship that me your motive is to want to look like him that's the only reason you should leave home that's why when they preach they say a word you say that's for the neighbor because you know what the neighbor did and you say amen that's that's not a good amen a true amen is when God speaks to your case when God speaks to your case and you know you're guilty and then and you have enough strength to say Amen that mean you prophesy on yourself you prophesy on yourself that means you say Amen Lord yes this is me I'm in this condition I don't like to forgive I have bitterness in my heart and it shouldn't be that way I am a Son of God I want to be the I want to be this way so I say Amen to it one good day you will look for that demon it'll be nowhere to be found you'll be delivered because you prophesied on yourself you see the adulterous woman she rejoiced she said behold I found a man that told me all that I've done when you come to church if God doesn't speak to you and what you've done you were not blessed that day you did not have a good service for me if I go to church God don't speak to me that was not a good service the service is good when God speaks on my case maybe it was good for you God spoke to your case for it to be good for me you got to speak to my case am amen that's how it ought to be you must be you must have the right motive amen amen I don't come to church because only I can get healed there no no what if God doesn't heal you do I you abandon him then no no even if he doesn't heal me I'll say devil I'll say devil I love the Lord I'll continue to serve him even if I'm hungry I pray like the three Hebrew boys they told the king even if he doesn't come for us we still won't bow because the word says I only bow before almighty God he is the only one worthy to be worship that's the only one I worship that's the only one I elevate that's the only when I sing to because he's my Creator he created me for that and I will not worship the devil Christians must have conviction you must have conviction you can't serve god without conviction you must show God you believe and you believe it 100% no matter what and no matter what situation I am am on the road with God by myself friends forsake you your husband forsakes you your wife forsakes you I will still keep moving I will still serve the Lord amen the voice said Don't Stop The Voice told lot don't look back the wife want to look back her business brother BR says you know the reason why Lot's wife perished because because she doubted she doubted when lot told her an angel visited me the wife didn't believe in him that's why keep moving nothing nothing nothing nothing should not separate us from the love of God amen amen should it be hunger should it be persecution whatever it may be is it because they slander your name brother Bram says if you're a Christian and no one never says a bad thing about you he says go to the Altar and ask if you're one of them go ask yourself ask God if you're one of them because everyone who would live for God is subject to persecution that's why after I read the quote after I read the quote where brother says it is what is in your hand the message that he preached he the message's title is what is in your hand paragraph 51 I believe if you serve God and no one ever says a bad word about you no one ever persecutes you go to the altar and ask the Lord am I one of yours after I read that quote I don't smell nothing I don't taste nothing you want to talk talk but as long as I know in my heart I am right with the Lord keep talking I don't smell it I don't taste it I will move forward in the word amen amen may the Lord richly bless you Before I Let You Go this group Jesus puts them through tests he says if one doesn't eat my flesh and drink my blood see another another 70 number 70 chosen disciples 70 + 12 if you take 70 and you divide it by 82 he had 12 and he had another 70 that's 82 disciples not even 20% of the church stayed after that message after one preaching did Jesus say I'm sorry let me explain what I meant let me take it back I want to keep the church together that's not what he did Brother Bram says the devil counts his the devil we God weighs his what is God doing right now he's weighing his Christian he weighs each person he's looking he just wants one person that can take him at his word and depend on him and someone he can use that's all he wants he doesn't need a group they all left he had 12 left if you wanted to get married in that church if you would have took one of those 70 ministers that would have been a mixed marriage because they don't believe for real 70 left you want to get married let's say you would have chose out of the 12 you chose Judas that's still a mixed marriage in the church in the message there's always three types of Believers three types of Believers I'll read a verse where Peter makes one commentary then I'll let you go after that preaching they all left John 6 verse 67 forgive me I took a bit of time John 6 verse 67 Jesus said unto the 12 after the 70 left will you go also go away this morning I want to remind you Jesus only wants Believers he's looking for a Believer someone who can believe him at his word and depend on him completely and forsake theirself in his hands that's all he's looking for 12 left 80% of of the church left this what he says here then listen to what Peter says Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom shall we go did Peter understand what Jesus said either no no but there is one thing that Peter realized if I leave Jesus I die it's over that's the Revelation that he had the one in front of him the person in front of him that is the one with eternal life let me tell you this morning there is no Life Baptist Pentecostals Catholic even if you say a message Church there is life in Jesus Christ even if you sit here you can sit here and only have a religious spirit no when you're here it's good to be here but while you're here you must meet the man Jesus Christ meet the man Jesus Christ he says he says we in verse 69 We Believe listen we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ when a Jew they know when they say the Son of God the Messiah the Christ the only thing they knew is that that was a promise from God that he would come himself in the flesh so that's why when they accuse you they say you said you are the Son of God so you said you're the Son of God that may that means you're saying that you are equal to God they knew that God would be the Messiah himself and Peter had that Revelation he says this man in front of me right now if I leave him I will die that's right that is a True Believer that's all God is looking for someone who can believe no matter the circumstance that's why faith it will jump over anything evil someone would do to you because you're looking for something this morning weigh the Rapture and weigh your pride and make a choice between the two may Jesus Christ richly bless you may the Lord deliver you from all vices from all demons sicknesses of the soul and sicknesses of the Flesh in Jesus Christ name we condemn them we condemn them all in Jesus name and be free in Jesus name keep believing the voice of God for this hour keep believing the voice of God for this hour don't just watch the signs believe the message with all the doctrine may Jesus Christ richly bless you glory we thank the Lord for the word of the Lord on today amen and um I know that brother ansy was a little uh concerned about how much time he would take today uh but sometime God gives you a word that you have to deliver uh to the people and you cannot worry about the time and uh I wanted to say that if um if you leave here today and uh you were concerned about the amount of time that uh our brother took and you begin to complain about that that put you in the group of the mixed multitude because they're the ones that complained and uh you know recently I had a chance to you know we listened to a tape um few Friday nights ago the first Friday the month and um brother Brandon made a statement on the tape he said every Revival produces twins amen and um and now uh on that tape he said the way that you can identify the twin is that they approach things from an intellectual perspective and uh and then as I was following that thought through some other sermons he said another uh way that you look at the Revival producing Twins or the twin spirits that come out of it the mixed multitude is also one of those twin spirits that comes out of a re of Revival so they have the same word that you have they have the same prophit that you have but yet when it comes to The Showdown they don't have everything that you have and it's very important that you uh you know you just hear what the Lord was really trying to say to us on today no matter no matter what I'm I'm sorry now I don't care who they are I don't care how close they are to me there's not one person on this Earth that's worth me losing my Soul amen not not one not mama daddy wife children nobody worth me losing my soul this is a one onone relationship with Jesus praise the Lord and you know as I was you know I was just so much was said here today I just appreciate brother an I re I really do I I I I'm very very grateful I'm very grateful and and and I'm glad that uh he could come here and and just preach his heart um we we believe the message that God sent us we believe the prophet that God sent us and I know that sometimes you when you you go into a church and you know and and and some get offended because we say that and we're not trying to offend it we not this not an alternative to denomination that's not what this is you know we're not just uh I used to be Baptist I used to be pentec cing I'm the message no that's not it what happened is that a restoration took place in me I told y'all last week I am the restoration a restoration took place in me and how did that happen because God said that he was going to send Elijah to turn restore the hearts of the children to their fathers and when that happened in me I became the restoration when it happened in you you became the restoration you became the very word that God promised right so so so you know we're we're not we're not ashamed this and I'm happy that the brother could come and just just lay his heart out because sometimes you know we we we I know churches that they say well we got new people so we don't quote the prophet no when are they going to ever hear about it I mean who going to tell them if if we don't tell them who going to tell them they coming to a message Church somebody got to let them know something God has done something in this hour hallelujah amen same way God did something in Moses day God has done something in this day we got to know what we're following and why we're holding on to everything that we got amen yeah that's that's why we dressed the way we dress that's why we look the way we look you look at the church world today my I mean people ask you uh you invite them to your church first thing I want to ask are you uh traditional or uh are you you contemporary and what they asking can I can I come dress a different way that's what they I just quickly we are traditional Bible Bible traditional that's that's who we are you're going to feel very comfortable if you come traditional ain't no ain't no ain't

ancy God bless you God bless you he had reached out to me some time ago and said brother I just had something in my heart I just wanted to share with the church and and I was uh I said well certainly we'll try to see if we can find a time and a slot to you know to get you get you in and and and I just believe the timing of God was just right you know just just to bring him you know at this time and and and I trust I trust that we all leave here that God spoke to us and we able to take the service for ourselves and and and I'm I'm I one really good one that I'm taking with me if you know you in God's will if you already know it's the will of God don't even pray about it no more open up your mouth I'mma tell I'm going tell you what that does I'm going tell you what that does that takes you

bless you God bless you God bless you well let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer amen and we'll prepare to dismiss you on today amen father we are grateful for the word of the Lord that has come to our hearts the voice that follows the signs and Lord we can look at this message that you have given us and we can see various signs Lord uh that that happened even the supernatural that would that happened but but there was a voice there was a a word spoke that we have to follow that word and God that was the thing that restored our hearts that turned our hearts back to the faith of the fathers you promis these things in scripture we're not just following something just to follow it even we look at uh the the great Army that was sent amongst us the Palmer worm the cankerworm the Locust and the caterpillar caterpillar Lord you said that you would send those uh uh uh insects amen into the midst and and the prophet was able to go in and dissect what happened spiritually so we can understand the scripture it's not just something amen random that's being spoken but something happened in the church throughout the years and and God uh you promised that when these things would occur you would restore so we thank you Father that we are a living manifestation of the restoration of the word of God that's what this message is all about it's not amen anything less it's just following the word and that's the proof that the Holy Ghost amen is present in our life that we're able to follow the word because the Bible says that when he the Holy Ghost comes he will lead us and guide us into all truth hallelujah if we can't receive truth then we can't say that we receive the Holy Ghost so Lord we thank you Father that we were able to accept truth and and Lord just Rejoice over that has been given to us I pray that you would continue to bless brother ancy Lord his ministry amen his family we thank you for him sacrificing and coming Lord just to speak this word to our hearts and I believe you had everyone here amen that needed to be here those that heard it online I pray to be strength amen and and and and Lord vitamin to the soul oh God that they would they would
