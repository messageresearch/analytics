hey man turn around so somebody won't be long [Music] praise the Lord hey man hey man praise the Lord thank you Jesus you could be seated man and the presence of the Lord certainly a blessing to be in the house of God I see my friend dawn hey man is that the house god bless you so good to have him a man well it's its first sunny and I've made a promise to you all since we started our Building Fund project that I typically give you updates on the first Sunday so I want to just take time to do that a man just give you a quick update before we a man with prepare to go into the word of the Lord a man those specials that I heard I want to say thank God for I appreciate they meant each and every one of them [Music] I finally got sisterly as I see so that's good a man's good good they have a rough you're singing this song it's so good to see Tim a man in the house the Lord as well appreciated me a man but so I just want to quickly just give you a brief update on now some things here on our progress and and the thing that I can say is that we have making progress a man and I'm grateful for that I'm very very thankful to the Lord that he allows us to be able to make progress and so I just want to give a brief update I have something here that [Music] help me read these numbers a lot easier [Music] so just really really quick what we what we pledged at the beginning of the year we took a vote and you know we were grateful that God has given us this place to worship but our focus a man is to be able to own our own place that that that's that's that's the the gold we pay a lot of money and rent a lot of money and rent per month amen to be able to come here and and rather than give it to somebody else you know we ought to own it ourselves so that's that's really what our our prayer and amen what our focus is so we pledged that the at the beginning of the year a hundred and five thousand dollars I'm sorry that place but we our goal was set at one hundred and five thousand dollars is what we need to raise over the next three years a hundred and five thousand each year and now we receive pledges we have a little forum out there that you can fill out if you want to be a part of the pledge and we receive pledges of fifty thousand three hundred twenty-five dollars which is a blessing and the other thing I want to say about that is as of last month that number actually rose okay so that number rose as far as people getting on board and saying that hey I want to help do this right so that number went from one place to another place all in one month so I'm grateful for that and we also a man wanted to let everybody know that as of as of today we have received on our pledges fifteen thousand one hundred sixteen dollars and four cents so we thank God for that let's give God praise for that praise the Lord amen and the other thing is at the beginning of the year I mentioned to you all that read and I thank God since the beginning a year it stage where it is so whether what that transfer means is that we had to take money from our building fund to help cover our monthly expenses here the church and and that's something that we never want to do because that really does not allow us to get to where we're trying to go if we keep pulling money from where we're saving and trying to cover expenses so and all of us not to do that amen what we ask everyone to do a man is if we had 37 people that would contribute $100 towards the offering every month every month and I know summertime it gets tough but I want you to remember your commitment to the Lord put God first 37 people give $100 a month an offering we will never see that rain again a man so and now thus far we've been able to do that and I want to just encourage us continue to do that that's just offering now the Bible tells us to pay time and offering all right so so you know we have and then we have what we call special offer which is for building funds but these are the three ways of giving are the three levels of giving according to scripture tithing offering and then you know special offerings like this so we're asking a man that 37 people just give $100 a month and offering and we'll never see any more range never see any more in a man glory to God so since we had to take $400 a transfer at the beginning of the year it makes our net profit or what we've saved thus far fourteen thousand seven hundred sixteen dollars and four cent so we're grateful we're very very grateful we are making progress it's not going down it's actually going up and God is good amen all the time so this is uh this is the our golden waves a brother Jack why do you do that the Bible say write the vision make it play and then he'll run that reason so that's why I do that I'm just doing with the Bible told me to do a bank god bless you can take that down a man we appreciate you let's give the Lord a hand of praise for his goodness towards us say ma'am musicians thank y'all so much I appreciate y'all hey man I appreciate charlie we're very very grateful for what the Lord a man is doing in our myths a man I'm gonna just love Jesus really regardless of what you're going through do you still love him a man he's still worried it to be priest a man so good to see brother Jeff Amen underthink god bless you and man my media glory to God I I won't take too much of your time but we'll be back tonight and also I forgot I mean 50 million at 5:30 we forgot to mention about Sunday school we are now conducting Sunday School here in the sanctuary we have the overflow area for the adult class and we also have the nursery area for our children's class so we will you know continue our Sunday school as well as communion the way that we'll be doing things going forward the sisters will continue to use this overflow area for the feet washing washing her feet and then the brother is gonna actually use over here in the nursery area for the washing their feet so we're gonna continue a man that is well and until God does otherwise a man but we are great for him I want to thank y'all for the big eat last week a man it turned out real nice a lot of food and I shall enjoyed it and and all the special little notes amen to me and my wife the cake and everything that was that was a pleasant surprise a man a pleasure surprise you know I'm a little different when it comes to a man celebrating my anniversary even though I thought that was a you know 25 years a man force Astaire gonna have to put up with me that's a lot she deserved to be celebrated for 25 years so I'm glad that y'all wrote a little note or something thank you for putting up with Pastor a man for 25 years but but we're certainly grateful for that and I just want to say thank you everything I'm one that reads every note and oftentimes you never know sometimes I might go back to it because pastor need encouragement to a man he often gives encouragement for the needs encouragement and man so I'm very thankful so everyone that participated made that what it was thank you thank you so much we really really a man appreciate it praise the Lord all right I am going to read a scripture here a man forests on today and we will just turn our thoughts towards the word of the Lord and I tell you what yeah let's just turn in our Bibles here to mark chapter 7 so man mark chapter 7 amen and if you can stand while we read the Word of God I asked that we we certainly do that mark chapter 7 praise the Lord mark chapter seven and I'm gonna start reading your verse 25 to says this for certain woman whose young daughter had an unclean spirit heard of him and came and fell at his feet the woman was a the woman was a Greek Sarah Phoenician violation and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter but jesus said in a herd let the children first be feel for it is not meet to take the children's bread and to cast it unto the dogs and she answered in 7 a.m. yes Lord and you notice that this the colon there yes Lord just yeah stop right yes Lord no she just got called a dog but yes Lord and notice after the colon it says yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs and and he said unto her for this same right for this scene because you said the right thing goes our way the devil is going out of our daughter oh lord help us God and when she was when she was come to a house she found the devil going out and her door to lay the fun the bed can we pray father we are grateful for the privilege that we have to read the word of the Lord but it takes the Holy Ghost to bring and bring clarity to the things that we're reading we prayed it - it just anoint a man this portion of the service as you have anointed a man everything else we appreciate being in your presence and even at this moment we take every spirit that is against the Spirit of God underneath the control of the Holy Spirit and God our hearts as we just scan the congregation our hearts go out to those Amen that are not in our midst today and you know whatever the reason is so we send a man this prayer after them God in between the words and in between our hearts God our thoughts are understood by you and you know exactly what we're asking for you know exactly we were praying for I remember a lot was asking for 50 and 40 and 30 and got all the way down to 10 but you gave him what he didn't ask for you gave him his family a man he'd never asked for a lot he just asked the axe for 10 in the city but you gave him lot to come out so God you know exactly what we're asking for and we pray that you would grant that this morning we bind the hands of the enemy that is at work and the lives of the people Satan loose God's people and let them go and the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you can be seated amen so we are just just just looking at this scripture this woman a man approaches the Lord Jesus she really doesn't have a right to approach him because at this time a man Jesus is actually coming to the Jews right this his ministry a man is coming to the Jews the Bible says it came to his own and his own received him not but he was coming to the Jews so so when Jesus used this terminology like you know it's not meat right it's not right for us to take the children's bread and when he's talk : that the children's bread he's talking about the Jews and it's been this particular instance a man but uh but it's casted unto the dogs now we realized that the Israelites rejected Christ we realized that and the Bible tells us that they were made blind intentionally a man so that we Gentiles would have an opportunity to see so since we are in the in the in the season or in the through to seven churches we've been given us this privilege to be able to see who Christ is then we can also take this scripture personally ourselves we are the children and healing is our bread hallelujah if healing is our bread then we don't have to accept being sick right if healing is our bread then you know we don't have to accept whatever the doctor says right because healing is something that you're supposed to be partaking of healing is something that that God has orchestrated this is one of the attributes that God had inside of him that he wanted to release to his people but he needed the right situation the right circumstance in order to be able to express the attribute of healing to his people a man so so we can take this personally as well but when we look at it a man from this angle today that this just woman be a menace our Phoenicians Jesus told us that it was it was not meet to take the children's bread and to cast it unto the dogs what uh what a statement for a later that's coming out of desperation a later that means his attention a later that is concerned about her daughter Amen a later that's really it men in dire straits and when she finally gets to the only person that can actually help her out he tells her it's not good for me to give bread to dogs what a statement to be good to be made and you know and and and and you know when we look at this lady she should actually speak to all of us because I don't think there's too many of us in here that would have been able to take words like that from Jesus right I mean we wouldn't have been able to continue the conversation I think we would have walked away with our heads down and and maybe we would start I mean we would have posted some things on on the internet right on social media we would have you know I went to Jesus and he said this about me we would have put all that out there right but but but not huh Amen this lady when she heard this these birds from Jesus she says yes Lord not just that just gets me yes Lord yeah yes sir I mean you might have called me a dog but you know you're still my lord you might have said this but you still my look you might allowed me to go through this but you're still my god Amen I don't care what I'm going through you a still king of my life right amen did this lady had the right attitude right and I am and you know which but I can just kind of see a man just in my own mind with that with that with that : being there that maybe she paused a little bit yes Lord and then she thought about what she was going to say and the next words are you know yet the dogs under the table and the children under the table eat of the children's crops and verse 29 when we looked at it notice what Jesus says he says and he said unto her for this saying go thy way the devil is going out in that daughter and let's let's place the sticker day he never prayed for the little girl he never prayed for he never even said anything amen I mean from his words I mean from his mouth he never formed any words about this young lady never but he told her mama for what you said mama bit because of what you said oh my god I want I want you to you know and then the title today is say the right thing say the right thing he said because the way you said it not let me let me let me take a little further not just what you said but who you said it to what you say and who you said it to if you told your daughter took me home so I want to encourage the church this morning say the right thing then you have to watch what you see because your words have power your words can change the circumstance your words can change the situation do you realize it was the Word of God then allowing us to even come to this earth the radius right now God's word changed nothing and made something out of it your your words have power and notice this is this is what she said when she said it and who she said it to that actually created a man of changed enough situation Jesus didn't have to say anything all he had to do was actually a man get her to recognize the faith that was already inside of her glory to God all I'll be here with you trying to get a few already got it go your way right go go go your way and sin be cut because of what you said say the devil is gone out of your vote based on what you said that she's trying to get Jesus to say it but Jesus ain't no based on what you said the devil just left Oh God lord help me to say the right thing I want to you know the word words and where is the powerful you know you this not the first time this happened a man over in the book of Matthew and you know also Luke 2 tells the same story but you all remember Amen the story of the Centurion and the Centurion he had a situation where he had a servant that was home that was sick and and and and and and you know this man said look I mean this he say he said I'm not worthy to go present myself before the Lord Jesus you know and and I don't want to approach me that wait so he sent some other Israelites right to go and approach Jesus they say just maybe you know maybe he'll do a favor you know and and and let him know this not for me right I'm not coming for myself but but but I gotta serve him and this service he sees he does been he treat me good right so so um I you know just on my behalf would you approach Jesus and try to get a met just a little favor so so the Bible says that he you know he was on his way Jesus was incident to Capernaum and and when Jesus was there in Capernaum this man comes and you know and see now when I read scripture and I think about being in Cooper do you know it means something to me now right I can just see this man sin in his are his little group to Jesus and and and Jesus stepping up stand up say okay I'll come and go with them and I've come to the man's house but when you read this the story of Centurion a man in an EM mark I'm I'm sorry Matthew and one in Luke it kind of it kind of presents it in two different ways so I'm kind of using both stories as I presented to you today but as as as they are approaching a in the house the Centurion leaves the house set sail all a lot the reason that I didn't even come because I don't even feel worthy for you to come underneath my room it says but uh but but I understand a couple things he say I'm a man of authority I say go and he go and I say come and he come I realized that whatever I say it's gonna be just exactly how I say it this man had even had a revelation of his position right and Jesus when he heard this man he said he said now i'm not got your indigo he gonna go with when i tell him to come he gonna come if he don't come it's gonna be some trouble if he don't go it's gonna be some trouble right so not only not only do i understand my place but these fellows around the understand their place they understand who's speaking to them come on somebody they understand what I'm trying to say right and it hang up seeing too many times i'ma say it once go come I got anger yeah I'm not gonna use a paragraph I'm not gonna use a sentence one word it cause this from the move and it calls that with the movie say I understand that I understand authority he's saying I also understand that you got power over every devil you say so if you would just speak the word then my servant will be made hope write some stuff so here Jesus looked at him in and you know and and when Jesus heard he was gonna a student and the Bible say that Jesus say yeah I haven't found this kind of faith in Israel I never seen nobody would just kind of faith so they may go find it just the same way you act you said it's supposed to be go find your servant come be made whole based on what you just say it Church I want you to I want to encourage you say the right thing now you know you can't even get godly get God to move if you ain't saying the right thing he's the high priests of your confession right and if you're not confessing the right thing you ain't gonna get nothing if you confess negative you get negative you confess positive you're gonna get positive all right let's not let me just go back to a couple of quotes that I read on Wednesday night a man will go forward from there hallelujah this is not only ours come thank you Jesus amen the Prophet says now the right mental attitude all you along here do you understand what I mean when I say the right mental attitude that that's in Tyrian had the right mental attitude the supination woman had the right mental attitude right listen say say say the right mental attitude your right mental attitude towards God's divine promise will bring any promise to parents now maybe you don't believe that you say well my faith is weak look at that say when my faith is weak he says I wouldn't confess it see that that's the thing even if your faith is weak don't ever let the devil here you see it's one thing to think it but don't say it right because when you say it you're actually saying the whole thing like my singing right thing Church listen you say he said well my faith is weak I wouldn't confession see don't let the devil know that my God my God my God don't let the devil know that always say I've got good faith I believe God with all my heart she don't testify nothing of the devil I love this when you accept him as your healer don't ever act like you're sick or crippled anymore right believe that your he'll take them at its word and that our that is all over old opt-in and novel you see as long as you take out it's worth in the word will produce what it promised to do is that right and I have faith believe him with all your heart glory to God let me go on I got another one here and as I was with Moses glory to God he says let him a man let him that's reach say I am strong and that that's that's what the Bible says in Joelle 310 it says you let that we Sam stone it says let let him last week say I am strong Steve just see in your heart that I am now strong amen I am now strong you know I let me just a quick testimony here and I'm a I'm a testified before it happens Amen I'm a testify before it happens we've been we've been going through to school this week and you know just trying to get things out and all of that and get it to different places you know and and and my summoning boxes of books ain't they ain't liked they're not light and I'm trying to pick these boxes up and I got him up by God's grace amen but boys soon as I got him up I started feeling a little something you know and and I say I say no that that was a life they know that that was a liar and and and I begin to think of a quote that the proper share says if you if you're at the at the stove and you're cooking and all of sudden some of the grease pop out on you rather there's like oh I just got burned he said act like it didn't happen and just keep moving on so soon as I thought that things I know in the name of Jesus I just kept walking right I will not stop to consider the pain I'm not waiting for pain I'm waiting for healing glory to God Church hey man I just began to fix it no this is the and I'm testifying before cuz you write a never said no you wait till you stop moving around you wait till you lay down you waits in it now anyway donut better healing right I'm not gonna say the wrong thing I'm a sailor right hang in there by His stripes I am already healed he was wounded for my transgressions bruised for my iniquities the chastisement of my peace is upon him and with His stripes I'm already healed that's what we got a safe Church a man you know and I'm just telling you gotta say the right thing right glory to God glory to God glory to God a man what you say changes the situation what you say I'm sick oh I'm getting worse it's getting worse but eventually it'll get better well I don't want to even go through the worse I just want to go from I want to go straight to data all right let me keep going uh hallelujah since I let the weak say I'm strong see just in your heart the CC just said in your heart that I am now strong I have now accepted Jesus as my healer and never have any negative testimony anymore right so so after you confess that you can't you can't see anything negative after that anymore right amen so now we're having a negative testimony anymore just believe it and what's just attacked me first they were saying all right there it is I don't know I don't know I can't explain it I don't understand it but I just believe it right so just believe it God is under obligation or Jesus Christ is sitting at the right hand of the Father to accept you for he's setting there the high priest of your confession to make good before the Father anything that he died for right that you're confessing that he's done there you are now divine healing cannot be any plainer than that is to the weakest you do it and remember God's Word will defeat Satan anywhere any place any time and any condition [Music] whatever your condition is this morning it can be defeated and notice what it takes to defeat the devil God's Word we talked about it last week right all you you don't need a superpower right you you've got the greatest superpower you can have you get the word all you have to do is stand on the promise of God's God you sing I don't know I and oftentimes you don't have to be afraid let me tell you if you don't have to be afraid to remind God of what he said actually he likes to hear that you know I don't know if you've ever experienced this before but maybe to one of your loved ones you make a promise that you don't purchase something right and in time slip by and you ain't got that yet but they remember and they have a way of coming back and saying you know could I get this now no no no no you can't get that you can't get that but you see and when they remind you of of what you see there's something that kicks on the inside right were you like look I gotta come through because they remember I don't want to be up gonna be found Elijah right I don't want this child to think that I'm alive so I gotta come through somehow you begin to just think of ways that you can get this thing done if you were like that what you think your God is like when you remind him of what he said he will not be made a liar all right let me go on with one more here says and this is out of who was God since when the inspiration of the Holy Spirit is here to inspire you remember God will make your body come into your confession hello somebody when the inspiration a man of the Holy Spirit is here to inspire you remember God will make your body come into your confession if you say you're drunker and want a drink don't worry you'll still one right if you say you're a sinner and want to sin you'll be right into it right if you say you're a Christian and believe it all alone God will bring it your your testimony will bring you right into it if you believe in healing and believe that God has healed you confess it and God will make your body obey your confession for he's the high priest of your confession I mean you know III find it quite amazing let me finish reading this I used to high priest of our confession Center at the right hand of the Father now with his own blood to make intercession for any confession about anything that he died for him and eat and he died to rid sin and sickness as a result of sin he was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes were healed remember that half think don't waiver stands on it you know Church you know in this hour there are different ways that the devil's attacking and as believers we got to know what our place is right we got to know you know the power of our words we have to understand that sometimes we make things worse on ourselves by what we say right amen but you know I've noticed that you know sometimes I've sat back and I watch me but I know they're going through I know they need prayer I know it but the other thing I've noticed that they too proud to ask for too proud we do you have a condition that you're going to the doctor about we having a prayer line service we're trying to elevate people's faith come to the prayer line service and watch what God do we got we got testimony what God is already there I mean here we got people in this church that's been healed of cancer other folks get cancer and will not actual prayer but I'm not now and it's one thing you know to know that I'm that God did it in brother branham's meetings that that's wonderful you can hear the tapes and all these other things you can read the books but that same God is still living right and he's right in your church they believe in healing all you gotta do is come to us provide a way and watch what God dude ain't no way if I knew God heals somebody might in my church if it's a guy here's somebody in my church of cancer and the doctor diagnosed me y'all pray for me I mean I know y'all Prince working here somebody somebody called me this morning say look I want to call the church and have them pray that I got confidence in these are people outside that don't even come to church got helping us in in the church you go to but but the people sitting in the chairs don't have confidence that something wrong with that hallelujah see this woman here in Scripture she knew where to go she knew exactly where to go and it's like look I got a I got a door that's vetch with a devil and this thing ain't right so I got an evil spirit and I need her to be free from it she know exactly who to get in contact with because if she knew who could get the job done it was nothing but the Lord Jesus but notice when she got there it was based on what she said not based on what Jesus said but it's based on what what she said can we can we just look at another scripture here amen hold glory to God let's look at this out of Matthew 17 Matthew 17 hallelujah thank you Jesus say the right thing hey man Matthew 17 and picking up here verse 14 look at it says and when they were come to the multitude there came to him a certain man kneeling down to him and saying lord have mercy on my son for he is a lunatic and sore vexed for all times he falleth into the fire and oft into the water and I brought him to my disciples and they could not cure him then jesus answered and said o faithless and perverse generation how long shall I be with you how long shall I suffer you bring him hither to me jesus knew what he could do with it and this man knew what Jesus could do with it and Jesus rebuked the devil and he departed out of him and the child was cured from that very hour it goes on to say this then came to the cyclist of Jesus apart when they got separated from everybody then came two cyclists of Jesus apart and said why could not we cast him out verse 20 says and Jesus said unto them because of your unbelief oh my god now you know now we're gonna you know later on in the scripture you'll see them talking about faster than praying but the first issue that stopped this from happening is because of their unbelief right because of your unbelief of bearly I said to you if you have faith as a grain of a mustard seed ye shall say unto this mountain hallelujah amen if you if you should say to this mountain Amen remove him see I'm the place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you like we have faith if you have faith as a grain of a mustard seed can you see that now can you see that can you see that you sitting pretty close to me you still can't see them come here first thing can you see you still can't see open up your hand can you see that's the size of a must-have see right there and now he couldn't see it but when I gave it to me knew he had it and once he got it then he knew I can see it because it's in my hand now right it's in my hand not now while I had it he just didn't I can't see that I can't see nothing but once I put it in his hand oh yeah I see that what God trying to just put some stuff in your hands keep it keep it and put it on this scripture in your Bible all you need is faith the size of a mustard seed this lady didn't even realize the faith that she had inside of her Jesus had the cavalettis think I'm gonna sit because you're saying the right things you can have what you said you all remember the story of Hattie right you remember the story had it right had it right a man had given a little offering for the building fund $20 that was a lot of money back then had it right gave $20 towards the building fund and the prophets say you know what I can't let that lady give that money that's just way too much money fun to give I'm going back down there to give this money back to her and as he was on his way the Holy Spirit saw say no no no no I did not stop the woman that gave her two pennies and put it in the Treasury I didn't stop her so don't stop handy right now why why why did the Holy Spirit stop him from from from doing that because the Holy Spirit knew that he had another blessing for Hattie right so so if you go if you go back and you give her that money you gonna hinder Hattie writes blessed right he didn't tell he didn't tell him everything right he said but just don't give the money back to just go down and you know just visit her have fellowship whatever so they sit around and they fellowshipping around the world and they talk in him and brother Branham begin to share some testimonies and one of the testimony share it was about the the squirrels that were created out of nothing he spoke them into existence amen uh here he you know he just sitting out there hunting and and the Holy Spirit's say do you believe that a man if you say to the mountain be thou removed Casa de see you don't doubt me heart you believe you can have what you say so yeah I believe that's it what you what's you out here for I'm hunting what you having fun Martin for squirrels how many you want three where you want a man like what what kind of voice is just talking to me right he say okay I'm gonna make this thing do something so impossible that it just it can't it can't be nothing but God make it come from this way here come from that way shot the squirrel he say when he got it picked it up he said he thought he was in a vision but when he picked up the squirrel he realized visions don't bleed this ain't a vision this is reality right so he said where do you want a second one shot I mean 71 what the second second will to do shot the second one winning got it right where you want a third one when it shot that ones and they couldn't find this one right but but God still challenging that you might not find it but it's gonna be like you see right and they went through a whole scenario he went back to the camp talked to a couple brothers and a man and when he got there talking to the brothers when the brothers prayed a prayer he said lord if brother Branham telling the truth brother I'm telling truth you know brother Branham got a mine battle weenie sometimes sometimes you can get encouraged by some by this prayer and sometimes you can get discouraged by somebody's prayer so when you heard your mother say yeah come I never heard nothing like this brother Randall but he if he tell her troop level find the squirrel went back out there he's like Lord why would the brother say something like that in his prayer that was that was intentional God put that there intentionally to see if you were still gonna believe I want you to catch this to see if you were still gonna believe what you said are you gonna believe what that brother said are you gonna believe with what what you say cuz shooter one that gotta say the right thing it ain't got nothing to do with what they say it's what you say I want you to hear that prayer now I want you I want to see if you really believe what you say then I say now you go back out there now they say Lord he's president think I'm a false prophet I'm a fine I want to tell them the testimony for them to do that and said mom do you still believe what you say stay with the same scripture do you believe that what you if you say to the mountain be thou cast MC don't doubt in your heart that you can have what you say well say where it's gonna be you said it went in there stuck his hands up under some leaves or something like that and that squirrel was sitting right there based on what the Prophet said he's sharing these testimonies in the household with Hattie right Hattie right sitting there and she heard and all these other people sitting in the same house but had it right it something struck up and and and and and and the reason is trucker because brother branham brought it all back to scripture said he said the same God that provided a ram for Abraham put him up on the top of the mountain where Rams don't don't live right say the same God that provided a ram for Abraham is the same God that provided squirrels for me and had it right all she said was that's nothing but the truth and do you realize because of what she said right God was pleased with what she singing and when God got pleased he total preface a now don't give her $20 back but now tell her whatever she asks for she can have her right now in this presence hallelujah Church and just like she didn't say whatever you actually you can have right now or my first problem say you say he says she said well what's gonna actually say look I can't take with actual but what I can taste that whatever you actually you can have had it right if I could put it this way she had a : and she had to think about what she was going to say Oh glory thank God you need to think about what you say she had to think about what she was Stanzler he say she say he say look your mama and daddy's sick little elderly want you acts you know you can actually heal us there you got a sister's been on the wheelchair for years we pray for her many times but right now I guarantee that girl gonna get up out that wheelchair if you actually she looked around and she had they say you pull you need money once you X for a million dollars you'll get it right now she looked at all those things and did she's looking in that same room two little boys sitting there my god laughing and snickering and and and and and and and and and and I'm concerned about the things of God and when she looked at them two boys she said no no no no no I don't need money I don't need my parents heal my sister's just fine she she got found peace with her situation cuz son must need to find peace with where we are right and until you found peace with where you are you ain't gonna go no further than where you are right you got it you gotta find peace in the midst of your storm all right but she found peace if she like she even gonna be just fine I mean Edith already you know the way the way to either bleak like look by the time I get to the other side I'm gonna get my new body so I'm good with it right here I I it's okay I keep I keep willing to my wheelchair see what the greatest thing I can ask for the salvation of these two boys say I'd like the salvation my two boys and underneath that anointed because she said that God saved her boys right there they went from laughing and giggling and snickering and you know how she got that through an offering through it all free that's how she got it right so so so you know it was if she said the right thing and by saying the right thing she received problems can I go a little further with this there's a little testimony believe that that said the right thing and I want to read about her if I can't oh my hold on one second I can't read that just yet I can't read it just yet images of Christ giving images of Christ this is something to build your faith today if I can images of Christ so it's just like his been said about a woman that maybe when she's married if she's so anxious to embrace her first little baby that she doesn't hardly know she and the heart can't can wait but her anticipation is though but behind that there is a fear if it doesn't quickly show up that she will not have this baby right so she's anxious to have it right and if it doesn't happen fast enough dishes begin to fear that she won't be able to have babies right listen say then that drives her further away all the time listen now there's a remedy there's a remedy to this there's a remedy that they do in these days and it's worked in all ages if that woman sees or believes that she's not going to give birth to this baby if she would just go out and adopt a baby right then the first thing you know she will have one of her own listen now that's proven correct 9 out of 10 times because that strain of wondering oh maybe I won't have it but that takes that little satisfaction there and and it's maybe God's Way of getting her in condition and then she would have our own baby because that scare and anticipation will finally leave her the thing that's stopping her is the anticipation and of scare now notice this he says and I love this I call this the adopt a baby faith right if you're going through something like that you adopt a baby and watch what God do to you right you said that's the same way about people who want to get healed if they can just have one little visible evidence like your ID you when he said Gihon zi stick crowd about the size of man hands Elijah says I hear this town of an abundance of rain he saw the evidence that's why many times I tell people go on start praising the Lord see because that is the adopted baby you don't see it yet but you're praising God for it anyway right that's the adoptive baby things right so start praising lordship because that is the adopter bathing because it's in her intellectual it's in its in their in their intellectual unit it comes into their soul that they're healed then the faith makes it right you got to know what you're doing you got to have confidence in what you're doing Lord I'll tell you what we need to practice some of that see it'll be like you say church it'll be like you say now this uh this woman that I want to just I want to hit and maybe I'll catch the ending of this this poet I won't read the whole thing I'm going to make the valley full of ditches and I'm gonna go to just put it at paragraph II - 5 but don't pull it up yet I want to just set it up that this woman that I want to talk to you about her name is Miss Webber and Miss Webber was dying with tuberculosis and you know she was you know whatever was there was some real real serious situation it was even so bad that brother Branham was told by the Holy Spirit said go tell her husband get ready because he gonna be left with these kids he gonna be without his wife and they're gonna be with the kids and he got have to raise the kids on his own so just get ready for it right get prepared for it and so brother Branham went and told mr. Webber what the Holy Spirit told him now that's that's a serious visitation when the Prophet come to tell you now this man I pray for so many people to get healed now he come tell you your wife gonna die so get ready wait a minute now can't you pray for case you do can't you change this like no no get ready she's going to die told the daughter get ready your mama gonna die now you have you have a couple things that you can do right you can you can sit there a man and you can um you can you can you can actually get ready you know start preparing for you know for what what he's actually telling you or you know you can just you can you know you can start praying and maybe God will change his mind right I mean there's a lot of things that you can do amen when you get into a situation like that but but this man he knew that you know God God speak this prophet in something like that i'ma just you know alright that's just just what its gonna be she gonna die and that's gonna be that let me I read something to you about this lady though hallelujah I'm gonna go to paragraph C forum that athlete older lady I told her husband she gonna die say after two days after two days or three days there was some ladies from the government Depot here where she worked come in and said grace Miss Webber said if I could said if I could only have brother brother bill to pray for me once more now she knows she get ready to die but if I could just have a pray for me once more she said I seen when my cousin opal was healed with that cancer and the doctor just give her till morning to live and her daughter's a nurse also right so she's going back in the mind reminded of somebody else being healed I know what God has done but done in the past so she said said the girl come girls from out at the government where she worked with her said there ain't nothing to that guy that's what they saying about brother branham right there ain't nothing to that guy he is nothing but a hypocrite said that's that's all that's all that religion is it's just a bunch of fake fanaticism and so Miss River miss Weber said look I'm dying and I know that but I but I just won't stay steal for that see this when I'm taught some battles come to you and when they come to you you got to stand up you have to have your feet shop with the preparation of the gospel of peace now look at this the battle came to miss Weber she said she said not now look I'm dying and I know that but I just won't stand still for that before she died she's gonna let the devil know whose side she goes I like this I like this right she said I know better than that she said I live right here around this city around that man all the time I seen him from a child grown up she said I'm no sit said you can call it fake if you want to she said but I seen it just so much it seen God heal the people she said and I know the man's life but I know it's the truth now look at this and it happened to be the angel the Lord heard that Oh glory see it's all about what you're saying it's not it's not just what you see here Church what you're standing at home the angel the Lord heard what she was saying now look at this it happened to be that the angel the Lord heard that and that very night setting on the side of my chair in the room after I got up and went and got a drink of water about three o'clock in the morning and standing on the chair I seen him come walking through the door he said tomorrow Sunday said that they are going to pick miss Weber up and bring her down she'll be sitting on the right hand side far back in the tabernacle said I heard her and tell her I heard her what she said and tell her left saith the Lord she'll live and not die now Miss Webber wanted brother Branham to pray for Jeff like this lady wanted Jesus to pray for her daughter hallelujah brother Brandon a chance to pray for her because she was healed by what she say all right let's go so there you are you can go down and see if you like to been about seven years ago all right see his presence was there when she was what when she was taken up for what was right see his presence was there he found her so he come and told me what she had said what she said to these women and he had respect to her because she had respect unto what was representing God she had right and the he had respect her look if you respect God God I respect you Oh God right he had respect to her because she had respect unto what was representing God so God would do the same thing to you not to respect to me but respect to respect to him to Christ the one who died for your healing if you just give her specks to him and his word God will do the work for you a man that is right Church miss Weber said the right thing and it pleased God it brought it healing a man to her because she said the right thing we gonna leave here there's gonna be different trials that come into our life but in the midst of those trials you still got to say the right thing no matter what the devil bring don't don't don't change your testimony based on your trial don't do that he's still just saying God you know he got to be God in the good times and he also got to be God in the bad times and that's why that's why I David David did say I will bless the Lord in the good times he even say how I bless the Lord at bad times no he said I will bless the Lord at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth my soul shall make her posted below the humble sir here that 11b and be glad with me and then he kept on talking he say o magnify the Lord with me and let us let we're not we're not gonna talk about our problems without gonna talk about our situation we're not gonna let a negative confession come out of our mouth let us exalt his name together and you know what else he say the Lord heard me see I passed out exalted even play to him the Lord hired me and he delivered me from all my fears but is based on what you say so sailor my pain Church [Applause] [Music] st. a right thing say things that please God say things that are bring the angel on the sink say things that make God happy grace is dying Greece is on the death bed she say I'm dying and I know I'm dying ain't got but a few minutes left but before I leave let me just tell you how hang on stand for that you call them a fanatic but I don't seem God dude oh good government even if God don't heal me [Applause] even if I don't get a healing before I die I want you to know what my eyes have seen and I'll testify that God is already healed so I know he said God had shoes this ministry and I know what God has done and because she respected God God risk did her say the right thing say the right thing say the right thing Church I can't I can only encourage you to say the right thing my God my God my God my God my God all glory glory glory this woman we pick up over here in Matthew 15 the same letter later we read about in mark 7 all glory thank you Jesus verse 21 then Jesus went thence and departed and to the coasts of Tyre and Sidon behold a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts and cried unto him saying have mercy on me O Lord I'm son of David my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil but he asked her not a word ignored her and his disciples came in from Saul but besought him saying sent her away for she crieth after us so if I can get his attention I'm gonna get your attention since y'all hang it around him but he answered and said I am NOT sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel being came she and worshipped him saying lord help me but he answered and said it is not meet to take the children's bread and to cast it to dogs and she said truth Lord another : yet the dogs either the crumbs which fall from the master's table then jesus said unto her look at what he said a woman great is thy faith C be it unto thee even as thou wilt and her daughter's made hold from that very hour C great is your faith what it is this was what we would consider mustard seed faith it was a pure faith and the reason Jesus told me how faith the size of mustard seed or like a mustard seed the reason that he would say is because a mustard seed can't be mixed with anything else right so so your faith ain't gotta be big it can be just as small as that little seed that I just gave really near mine but when it's pure like that then it'll bring any promise to pass this last little thing I want to share the Prophet was going to this young girl's house to pray for her Eid she was uh you know she was she heard testimonies about him praying for others they had been healed and so on and so forth and she's like you know I know God can do it for me I know God can do it you know and we and we say those things but we don't really believe it our faith is like God can do it for you but I'm not sure he can do it for me but God don't want us to have that kind of faith you're gonna have faith has got to be I know God will do it for me right so so so this young lady she was daring she's like yeah I've seen this in a scene ends like she's just all excited the brother branham say sister you have faith just say yeah I got I got so you sure you got faith yes I got faith okay Acts everybody leader room and they got into the room by herself it's just you said you have faith right yes this is okay look at the ceiling there there is a they call it a bracelet or string he say that's Fingaz hang in there he says now you got faith make the string move oh she's old no that's spiritualism you say I thought you would say that sister it's just no that's that's not spiritualism that's not spiritualism that that's faith he said he said magicians use it all the time that's not a break glasses in all kind of stuff they use it faith they use it in the wrong way but it's faith that's doing it and if she said she said she said well you know if it's faith that's doing it can you make it move it say yeah I can you say just just turn your head just a little bit just no we just you know and just you know just watch don't watch me watch them and whatever he did that like that that that string began to move and then stop that girl looked at that she said brother branham what is this you know she said sister that's faith he said she said she said no I'm you know I'm not sure about this brother man say he said I know that's why I actually did you have faith because faith will do that if you say well prove that to me the Bible said Jesus said if you say to the mountain be thou removed be thou cast into the sea and don't doubt in your heart you can have what you say that's what Jesus said instead I applied that same faith to that string and that's why I moved just say did the devil move that string no did God move that string no who moved the string he said I did what see my faith move the string my faith deity and when you have faith your faith can do the exact same thing just say oh my so let me just finish this by reading a portion of this quote my god I mean I'm in faith as a substance and I'm at paragraph II - 43 I'm gonna read this quote that I'm gonna read a scripture and I'm gonna do something for y'all this morning this is a faith as a substance he says and I said one day Jesus passed by a tree and you wanted to find some fruit on it and there was no fruit on it he put a curse on it and and the tree begins to wilt and when they passed by at noon the tree was wilted down Peter and marked have said how quick the tree was wilted he said if you would say in your heart for this tree to be plucked up in cast into the sea and dumped and walked down him it would obey you did he say it and I said he said if you say to this mountain be removed and don't down don't doubt it not in your heart by and by it would come to pass did he say it sure he did I said I know your unbelieving pastor trying to justify his unbelief said that was a mountain of sin I went to school myself and he was kneeling by Mount of Olives it was Mount of Olives if you say in your heart for it for it to be moved and don't doubt it I said now how much more faith and he said if you're not faithless I mustardseed i said now the faith the size of mustard seed would move that mountain how much more smaller faith would you have to have just to move the bracelet it goes on you see what I mean I've often wondered why he said mustard seed I might drop this thought mustard seed is the smallest among all seed that's right but there is is it nothing will mix with mustard seed it's all mustard you can't mix it with AK with kale or nothing and make it grow it's all mustard if you've got that much faith all faiths not mixed up with something else asked what you will it will be given to you but it can't be wavering it's gotta be genuine mustard if you know what I'm speaking of alright and I said how much more would it take why she said looking here I want to ask you something she said did God move that or did the devil move that I said neither one moved that she said then how did how did it move I said I moved it she said well you're 15 feet are better away from it I said no that's my faith that moved it see if you ask anything and don't doubt it see what I mean this woman you know eventually got heal but he had to prove to her that this is what faith actually does right and and and if we would just just approach God with the right or the right mental attitude towards enemies of divine promises guess what church we don't see it come to pass I need you to open up your Bibles I got two places that I want to read from first Luke 17 that's gonna be shorter than Matthew Matthew 17 I think that I might be let me just make sure here yes Luke 17 verse 5 and 6 it says this apostle said unto the Lord increase our faith and Lord said that they had faith as a grain of a mustard seed you might say into the sick of mine tree be thou plucked up by the root and be thou planted in the sea and it should obey you let's go back over to Matthew 17 and while you got Luke 17 if you want to put a little whoa maybe a place marker in your Bible but I want to do something for y'all today I got some mustard seed that I want to give you and I want you to take one seed maybe put it in Luke and another one put it in Matthew and just hold on to it and when you when you when you read that scripture think about that little seed that you gather your Bible because that's all God asking you to do is have this type of this type of faith and you'll see mountains moving Matthew 17 we started reading it a little earlier I got the verse 20 and Jesus said in them because again believe for verily I say unto you that if you have faith as a grain of a mustard seed ye shall stand to this mountain remove hence to yonder place in the shell remove and nothing shall be impossible nothing shall be impossible unto you howbeit this Karen goeth not out but by prayer and fasting are we've Church that practices prayer are we search that practices Basti well we should expect this type of power on a prayin I was there in Jericho standing that foot of Mount temptation looking a man to see how Jesus had overcome that's just imagining just imagine man Jesus was up there on top of this mountain devil presenting these trials to him but yet he overcomes by saying it is written it is written it is written I said man heathen using super power God helped me just take it you weren't great just just to confess what your words say and to be satisfied to find peace with what the word sins right and and as I was sitting there there was a little shop and we walked inside a little shopping and when the brothers say brother Jack you know what it is say no what is that he say that's must've seed I say that muster see let me get me some of that you know as I'm taking it back to the church and the number of years ago I come to the church I had some mustard seed that we got from brother Perry green and we were out there in Arizona he gave us some that he got from Israel and we gave it to the church and just kind of poured inside everybody's Bibles and I said you know some of y'all and man weren't here at that time to get that so I got some for you this time amen and others you might have a new Bible like me right so you don't have your old Bible with the muscle see there so with your new Bible you want some us to see but I want to tell you something you don't it's not just a muster seat that's just a reminder of the faith that you need all it needs to be is faith like they must have seen and you'll move mountains anybody believe that praise the Lord let's pray let's pray let's pray father God we would move by you were removed by Lord your promises and father we just acts that as we would Lord just kind of turn our attention father to just a little thing that you laid in my heart as we were there as we would their dog as we were there in Israel and looking at this mustard seed my my thoughts Lord just came upon the congregation and God at this moment I don't know what people face and I don't know every situation I don't know every circumstance but I do know that you told us in your word that if we had faith the size of mustard seed and we could see mountains move I also know that your prophet told us that the Word of God would defeat the devil any place any time any condition so God whatever the conditions might be I pray that they would take a hold of this and as they would just be reminded when they see just these couple of seeds Lord and their Bibles that they would be reminded that all they need is faith the size of this mustard seed or or like this month muster see where it cannot be mixed with anything let them have that pure unadulterated faith and they'll see mountains move Oh God we're giving you praise in advance for the things that you're gonna do on our behalf it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen there was one other little quote that I wanted to read to you all praise the Lord this is as as the eagle stirreth up her nests let me just read this and I'm gonna have you just get your Bibles ready and we're gonna put some mustard seed in there for you today the Prophet says you'd have to come with the right kind of an approach to God if you come selfish if you come in any other approach but the right mental attitude towards God or any divine gifts you'll never receive any benefits from it you've got to come with your surrender all to God look at the south initial woman when she was told by Jesus is not right for me to take the children's bread and the feed you dumps what would you have said if he that called you a dog you just said I'll join the next church but not her she knew who she was talking to she said Lord that's right you're so right in that but the dogs is willing to eat the scraps of the master's table that guy that was in that's what he's waiting for you to do humble yourself into such a place no matter how God sends it to you if you're healed instantly if you heal by degrees if you're put off like Abraham was twenty-five years waiting for the promise but instead of getting weak and weaker he got stronger up all the time giving praise to God just so that you know that God promised it and you accept it for yourself it's got to come to pass amen I believe that so you all line up have y'all wanna line up I got some mustard seed that I brought back for you on all you have just opened your Bible wanna place it on that scripture a man it's yours a man to keep be reminded be reminded when you open up your Bible this must have seen this all God asking you to do is have the mustard seed faith a man which cannot be mixed and you'll see mountains move in your life praise the Lord all those that wolf some just come
