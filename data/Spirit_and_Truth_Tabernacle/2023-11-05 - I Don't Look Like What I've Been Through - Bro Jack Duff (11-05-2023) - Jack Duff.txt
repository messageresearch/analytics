house of the Lord you can be seated just for a few minutes amen man you can be uh certainly uh good to be back home amen [Applause] we we we we had a a wonderful time in Australia as I was telling some of the Saints um I don't know what happens to me but the older I get the less I want to take trips like that because of the distance in travel uh roughly 30 hours um to to get there and and it just it um it wears and tears Amen on your body Play the song all the way all the way I'm going all the way you know that just all right there you go thank you sister amen it's good to see her in her place amen praise God but we were um you know it's just a challenge to the body and um and uh when my wife is not going with me I don't like to go and stay too long I just like to go and come on back home you know just be with her and the rest of the family uh but uh but we were able to go and and you know when you when I got there um and just start hearing the the stories of the people uh realizing that Australia is a a country where brother Brandon was denied a visa to enter the country and you can just imagine a first thought I had is who was the person that said no to the prophet and I don't know if they realize what they had done but uh a whole nation is impacted by uh somebody denying a Visa and uh you know so most of the churches there are made up of people that have come from uh other nations uh they come out of Philippines they've come out of um um Ghana they've come out of Zimbabwe uh they've come out of um the Samoan Islands New Zealand and these people are the ones that make up uh the churches there in Australia and uh so you know you you go into a situation like that and you realize made a statement I said you know they might have stopped the messenger but they couldn't stop the message and uh so it was good to kind of go in and be able to fellowship with some of the Believers amen uh just you know with um with where they were and just just had wonderful wonderful services and I was just listening to brother Solomon just say you know it's a pleasure for him to be there to introduce me to the the platform there you know and uh but and and I was just sitting back and just really you know my buttons popping off seeing brother Solomon up their lead and worship and uh the thought comes is see when we're faithful when we're faithful uh to what God has called us to do here in West Palm Beach then it's God that puts us in other places it's not us putting ourself there but we just remain faithful and we let God do what God does amen and he does all things well amen so we we were happy to just take our portion of what we do here and and and and I was listening to the song service this morning say boy y'all not just this morning last week y'all folk know how to have church y'all make people want to be in church like man I don't want to miss nothing you know but uh but you know brother brother Smiley just my God I said woooo H had to make sure y'all was ready you know y'all ain't ready take off again I said boy that's all right I was I I said that I and then you know they called for the special sister Abby came up and did her special and and I'm thanking well praise the Lord and then sister Bice my Lord it was it was beyond midnight when service is happening here they they've already stepped into the next day they're already into Monday it's midnight roughly right now and uh so I wasn't able to listen to the service live but uh I heard just a portion and I was just laying there in my bed listening and and my just made me want to get up and uh cut a step he you know just just uh somewhere between here and there and uh you know I preached that sermon over in uh over in Australia and I've never had the people respond uh like that uh I mean saints were just coming up and they shake the preacher's hand when they if they hear something good they walk up and shake your hand and I'm like well praise the Lord say I touch and agree with that you know that's what I'm touching and agreeing with that and and I said well my God and just it was it was something I hadn't experienced before but uh I I just and you know I just love when people receive the word you know it just means so much to you that the word cuz you know if the word don't make you move the word don't make you shout ain't nothing else going to make you shout right I mean it's it's one thing to let the music do it but when the word does it I'm going tell you something to go a little deeper the anchor gets a a greater hole when when the word pulls a shout out you right so uh but we were just we were just so elated Amen to be there but before we took that trip um you all as a church did something so special for sister Eric and I and I did not get a chance to formally just thank you all for uh your your just your kindness showed to me and sister Erica just your love that was expressed to us you you blessed us Amen in so many ways I had uh beautiful cards beautiful words I had gifts I had you know uh monetary uh love offering friends and I mean I I I just I had it all and uh I just want to say on behalf of my wife and myself we really thank you all so much for just taking the time to appreciate us we we really really thank you for that it it meant so much it meant so much praise the Lord amen you know uh there was a a story one time where brother brandom had a um a man that came to him and he said bless God uh I wouldn't want nobody doing that for me praise God bless God brother I mean you shouldn't be doing accepting things like that and uh brother brandom just looked at the brother say it's just one thing different between between you and I all right I mean I appreciate what the people doing when they do something nice for me I appreciate it you know and he said not me bless God I I don't do it for that I do it for for the cause of Christ he said there's only one difference between you and I that the difference is that you lying and I'm telling the truth you lying you you appreciate when people appreciate you right so uh so I I thank the Lord amen for spirit and Truth Tabernacle I I'm grateful um um you know I I left with a few things in my heart but I was able to kind of you know put those things underneath and just just persevere and as soon as I got back home uh even more more things you know hit me so you all I mean I was there at the hospital with brother Troy and um and and the family uh as my beev took her last breath and uh you know so I'm just getting off the plane going straight to the hospital pretty much the next day and you know but there to be with the family and and uh we thank the Lord that we have the opportunity to be there and um you know and then on yesterday we buried my aunt uh my my uncle's wife we buried her and and I'm I'm on my way to the um um uh the service and uh my sister calls me about 30 minutes before Serv say okay they need you to do a opening scripture I'm sorry opening prayer and just to sing a few congregational songs I said okay no problem I got it I got it got it no problem and I walk through the door and my cousin say no you you moderating the program I say y'all ain't called me and told me nothing and but you you have to just throw that off and get on up there and do what God called you to do right but uh but yesterday you know so we just we just kind of had you know all these things shifting and I had uh my mind going in a particular direction for the sermon and uh and I said well Lord we'll we'll we'll do this we'll do that and then I you know get wrapped up with the family and then I I get home late and you know all these other things and I say well okay Lord you're going to have to help me today you're going to have to help me today so I found this sermon that I had in my archive that I never preached before amen but it was in my archive and y'all just pray for me CU I want to try to preach it today amen the the sermon is titled I don't look like what I've been through amen amen praise the Lord so we say praise the Lord amen and and we will we will stand to our feet good to see our Deacon Amen brother Troy God bless you God bless you amen and and I wanted to also say this um last Sunday I knew he was weighted down you know with some of the things that he was facing but uh it means so much to me uh to see him persevere through everything he's going through personally uh you know and he persevered and brought the word of God uh to the people of God Amen on last week it meant so much to me brother Jerry appreciate you standing and and and and delivering the word brother Quenton I I appreciate you standing and delivering the word amen uh we thank God for the gifts that he's given to this body amen the Lord bless you I'm going to read one scripture thank you musicians appreciate you all so much amen uh I want to read just one verse amen Psalm 34 and verse 19 19 praise the Lord my grandson is here in the house today too I'm good it's good to have Elias amen amen amen amen um uh Psalm 34 and verse are we are grateful for the privilege we have to come and read the word we thank you for uh taking us away and bringing us back safely we thank you for the anointing that is in the building uh we ask that you would help us Lord to Lord just get ourselves out of the way uh that you would hide us behind the cross that we might not not be seen but may Christ uh be on display today Father get the glory out of our gathering uh May the spirit of the Lord take control over this portion of the service we've felt you through the song service and the worship and the specials Lord we appreciate our sisters Lord for just being ready and yielded and and Lord just hearing your voice and presenting to the people the song that you placed in their hearts so we thank you for that God today it all adds to the anointing so father we ask that you Lord Jesus would now just take control over every spirit that is against your spirit and father be glorified in this portion of our worship in jesus' name we pray amen you can be seated praise the Lord so again our title is I don't look like what I've been through amen um I want to just start by reading a couple quotes here the first one is coming out of the sermon I know amen I I know I told you sometimes if you would just listen to the title of what the prophet is preaching there is a sermon simply in the title before he even gets to the context the the title says I know I'm not hoping it's not a maybe am I wondering whether God going to come through or not no no that's not the that's not my position positioned position is I I know God going to make a way I I know God going to open up a door I I know I know that if God Did It Before I know he will do it again I know he's the same yesterday the day and forever I know I I know the devil is a liar I I know if he healed Me Before He'll heal me again I know know I don't look like what I've been through I I know I know the God that I serve right so so so so you know sometimes just listen to just just the title and you can get a little word I think brother Quinton this morning's praying said Lord all we need is just a word from you amen the the Centurion said just speak the word only just just give me just one word I don't need a paragraph I I don't need the whole message just give me one word out of it amen I have strength for the journey it says this in the message I know know he says sometimes we have more troubles when we become a Christian than we did when we were Sinners can you believe that you thought this was going to be a picnic when you came to God no more trouble Hallelujah I it's going to be more trouble than you ever seen before because the Bible promis you many are the afflictions right of the children got many you got to have many afflictions but it didn't stop that put a comment put a uh let me what some other uh form of um uh I can't even see it here uh I think it was a comma no no no no it's a it's a colon right it put a colon there and and and Theon says there's a little bit more to this yeah many are the afflictions but oh I love this church but the Lord deliver them out of some of them most of them no that ain't what David said he's say the Lord going to deliver you out of all of them whatever you are facing right now God is going to deliver you I know that yes I know that I'm not it's not a hope it's not a maybe I know God going to make a way [Applause] somehow yes sir glory to God Amen here he says that sometimes we have more troubles when we become a Christian than we did when we were Sinners of course the prophet says it's written many is the afflictions of the righteous but God not only that strange feelings you going to have many of them many afflictions and many strange feelings strange things that would be beyond our understanding come on somebody but it's always done for our good hallu we just can't understand it because if we did then it would not be Faith to us glory to God Amen he would go uh we would go with an understanding but we do it and we have it and we believe by faith is work then it's going to work some good thing for us if we could grasp that today on this morning if we could grasp that all of our troubles and there is none of us immune from them right but if we and if we can realize that those things are for our good I think Paul says all things work together for our good amen because because we love God and we're called according to his purpose didn't mean it's going to feel good but it's going to work together for our good all right all right all right let's go into this next one out of Shalom am man the message Shalom there again another uh uh uh sermon in the title Shalom mean so so I I'm speaking that over you this morning whatever you're facing on peace sir settle your spirit except God's peace Hallelujah glory to God I don't care how great the storm is in your life amen God wants to give you peace in the midst of your storm amen amen here in the message Shalom he says this many people ask why they ask somebody asked me why must these things happen Glory why did this happen to me why did I start and this happened glory to God and I had this trouble here and this upset me here and I lost this here sometimes I ask why why when I was just a young Minister and first started out did God take my wife right out from under me take my baby right from beneath me right beneath my heart now one of I'm going to tell you one of the things about brother brandom especially with his baby been taken from him when she died amen uh brother Brandon said when went to see her she had cross eyes yeah and uh and when he looked at her with those cross eyes it caused the prophet to have a certain feeling for other little children amen when he see him come through the prayer line with Crosse eyes and when when when we reach that sermon somewhere between here and there the one boy had he was crossy on that side of the platform but when he got to the other side he was no longer crossy and brother brandham never prayed for the boy that's right amen it was just a feeling that he had amen and and just just just whatever that he had gave him power over the cross side without even praying for him am yes sir Hallelujah I was telling him the testimony how brother digs received his eyesight in okobe come on at Golden Corral Hallelujah brother brother smil say if you want it brother if you want something to eat you got you better get up and go get it yourself and without prayer come on Amen it was the faith that rose up to say I am going to go get my food his eyes popped open he started eating he start driving and he been traveling the world ever since but we see what God did for brother DS right here in our state we seen it happen with our own eyes Hallelujah see so you know here's the thing we we we uh uh uh you know brother brandom had this uh you know just I said like this because of what he went through it gave him a certain sympathy amen or empathy for others and what you are going through gives you an empathy for other people I'm going say something here that that that I I I feel is necessary it's bad it's really bad that uh sometimes people don't know how to handle information and what make it bad is that sometimes s there's somebody that can help you they actually want to share their story with you but they worri how you going to handle the information how you what you going to do with this information oh sometime you get a little information and you feel like that justify you to do something the the information is not to justify you the information is to try to set you free come on somebody glory to God Amen but but sometime people have to reserve what they going to say because they watching how you going to handle it if I share this with you you going to be sharing this with everybody else oh well sister so and so told me I didn't I didn't tell you that for you to go telling everybody else I told you that to help you how is that going to help them come on somebody praise the Lord so so so it's a shame that we can't even just be ourselves with one another amen amen all right let me keep reading it says um God take my uh my heart why did he do that I I didn't know I I do now it says I just held my hand in his and kept trus him he knows every Junction he knows the Rhythm when it must take place he knows what it takes to mold you glory to God Amen he knows what kind of material he's going to use see the back side of the desert sometimes where God mows righteous men into sages and Prophets see that's where men are beat out men are beat out in the word when they got all kind of creed and stuff in them let them come to the word and God beats it right out of them MOS it right into the great Symphony of his word and then they see the word word moving on I I like that I like that uh you know people will see the word moving on I can tell you that right now uh I i' I've seen it I'm going to keep reading this quote but I've seen it just happen where people you know you leave for a season amen and uh you know whatever the devil's done to try to trip somebody up but it happens we all get tripped up along the way sometime but uh but but but what happens that if the church is moving according to the word you're going to find the church doing the same thing when you come back and find your place cuz the church is moving according to the word hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen he goes and says God knows when the rhythm of it has got to change he knows how the Rhythm goes I don't know how it goes but he knows he knows how it goes I don't but I look at here and I say well it's just coming many are the afflictions of the righteous but God deliver him out of them all God has moved through history with the rhythm of the promise of his word and each age in the same Rhythm making his word that's how God moved down through history from all the way from Genesis to Revelation he has moved through history with his word that's right with the rhythm of the power of the Holy Spirit vindicating his word to the elected remember he's never been able to touch the touch outside the church it's only the elected now I there's a there's a there's a there that's a powerful statement and I want to go back and just pick up this scripture out of Psalms 34 just for a little bit because there are certain things that's only to the elected now let's let's start at verse one I just want to read a couple verses from verse one uh and then we'll move forward here in Psalms 34 it says this Hallelujah I Will Bless The Lord at all times that that that don't mean when I'm feeling great come on only when I feel good only when I'm on the mountain top am I going to give God praise no no no no no when you in the valley low bless the Lord praise God yes sir amen hallelujah your bills behind praise him actually while you praise him your bill might get caught [Applause] up Lord you got to have a determination I Will Bless The Lord at all times then David says his praise look at this shall [Music] continually be in my mouth I ain't going to stop and complain I'm going to just keep giving God praise many of the afflictions are the Righteous but the Lord deliver them all I don't know I don't know how I'm going to come through but God you going to make a way I know you will father I Praise You Lord I I give you glory not for what you will do but what you already done you proved it to me before I know you'll do it again hey you can stop and look at yourself you know he's brought you out before I don't look like what I've gone through and after this trial I still won't look like what I've gone through Hallelujah [Applause] somebody his praise shall continually be in my mouth my soul shall make a boast in the Lord The Humble shall hear thereof and be glad I love David's writings oh anybody come to church this morning to do this oh magnify the Lord with me and let us exalt his name together I sought the Lord and he heard me and delivered me from all my fears they looked unto him and were light and their faces were not ashamed this poor man cried and the Lord heard him and saved him out of all his troubles now watch this verse the angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear Him and deliver them now I'm going to get a little deeper into this in um in our Bible study in a few weeks but I want to just drop this off when brother brandom just said this quote and he says it's never been able to touch outside the church it's only the elected this is important because in this verse amen you know how people always talk about uh uh uh everybody got a guardian angel uhuh according to this verse not everybody amen not everybody got a a guarden angel you you want to know who got the guarden angel read the scripture the angel of the Lord Guardian Angel encampeth round about them that fear him so you got to have some fear for God sir you got to be elected you got to be pred at in order to have a guardien angel you got to have all of that hallah glory to God Amen he said it goes on to say that fear Him and and deliver them so it's only the angel are only encamp those that fear God oh yes yes yes it's the truth verse eight says oh taste and see that the Lord is good blessed is the man that trusteth in him let's move on from there here in Luke 21:19 the Bible also says in your patience possess ye your souls in your patience possess ye your souls now I was just kind of looking at a few statements there in statute of a perfect man and brother brandom made a statement about patience says God tries your patience God tries it right and and uh and and he said that's that's right God trying and he used the example of Noah how he was patiently waiting on God after 120 years waiting for the rain to come and preaching for all this time and finally gets inside the boat and the and the and and the um uh uh the animals come from all over the place and they come into the boat and and then God seals the door and while he's inside the boat when God tries his patience his wife comes to Noah the wife comes to no say are you sure God told you to do this now wait a minute dear didn't you see the animals like I saw the animals didn't you see God close the door like I saw God close the door why would you question whether this was with God or not I don't I don't care how long we've been waiting on this rain to come just stay inside the boat yes sir man that's another that's another sermon that I have in my heart amen Miracles that happen in the boat but you got to be in the boat in order to experience a miracle that's another sermon for another day but but but here you know Noah I mean Noah's wife is is coming and when when Noah's wife come that is God trying Noah's patience glory to God brother brandom uh made another statement in that same sermon statue of perent says when you done exactly what he said do and it seemed like it went wrong still be patient stand still and be patient when you done everything you thought the Lord told you to do and it seemed like it went wrong all you can do is stand still be patient oh that speaks to me this morning I know we had everything lined up for this church I know God Amen gave some approvals and did some things here but I'm at a spot where all I can do is just stand still and be patient come on somebody Hallelujah so we we we we want to go through the life of Paul here really quick amen and some things that he went through he had to stand still and just be patient Paul didn't look like what he had gone through all right right uh acts 14 and 19 verse 19 and 20 in Acts 14 it says this and there came thether certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium who persuaded the people and having stoned Paul Drew him out of the city supposing he had been dead my God how be it as the disciples stood amen round about him he rose up up glory to God and came into the City and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derby now here a man looks like he was dead they drug him out and figured this man just going to die right here you know and uh I mean it's it's done we not going to hear the voice of Paul no more but here while the disciples are standing around Paul Paul Rises up it now it didn't say that they lay hands on Paul and and he rose up no some kind of way Paul just stood up and and and a man that just kind of stood to his feet after being stoned didn't look like what he just went through see God know how to protect you in the midst of whatever it is that you're facing God know how to give you a better testimony as you go through the thing right not just go to the thing but you got to go through the thing amen amen you get a better testimony when you go through it hallelujah hallelujah Paul amen was uh brother Bram say Paul had patience he was patient so let say look what Paul had to do talk about patience right and uh acts 23:11 uh he was told something glory to God he says uh the Bible says in the night following the Lord stood by him and said be of good cheer Paul for as thou has testified to me in Jerusalem so must thou be witness also at Rome now I just find the words very striking that God would you know see this man just been stoned this man just been went went through this this man went I mean all kind of things Paul he done been in prison he I mean all kind of stuff the man going through but the Lord would come and say be of good cheer oh my my my my my I know you might be going through some stuff this morning but the God God is speaking the same thing to you be of good cheer sir amen sir Hallelujah can I put it this way have the right attitude why you going through what's the right attitude an attitude of gratitude come on in and praise God in the midst of everything you're going through my money funny praise God my husband or my wife acting up praise God my children gone crazy praise God many are the afflictions of the righteous and he's are Affliction Satan I I agree these are a lot of afflictions but the Lord will deliver me out of them all [Music] Sir Paul is uh told by God he's going to Bear witness of him also at Rome and uh just you know we can read the next verse there I think uh uh um acts 23 and and 12 what is the next the next verse uh gives us just a little something that Paul is going through it says and when it was day certain of the Jews banded together and bound themselves under a curse saying that they would neither eat e nor drink till they had killed Paul now here the angel of the Lord said you're going to Rome but there's a group of people that have banded together we won't we going to fast until Paul is dead I I can just tell you right now if the angel of Lord say he going to Rome your fasting ain't going to stop Paul from going to Rome your agreement to kill Paul will not stop Paul from getting to Rome I don't care who is coming to agreement to try to stop you from receiving what God has for you hey I got news this morning it just won't [Music] [Applause] work Fred Amon said it just won't work come on somebody it won't work glory glory glory glory amen but Paul amen is told by the angel of the Lord that he is going to Rome even though now these Jews abandoned and say they're going to kill him that couldn't stop Paul from making it to Rome if we were to go on and read in Acts 24 uh he was taken to a leader by the name of Felix and Felix prolonged Paul's judgment for two years and hope that Paul would give him money to buy his freedom my God trying to bride Paul glory to God uh but Paul waited right there in the prison knowing that he was still going to Rome this is two years later acts 25 uh Paul stood before fesus who had replaced Felix and appealed to stand before Caesar because he remembered the prophecy that he was to Bear witness in Rome hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen also we find in in Scripture that Paul stood before King Agrippa and he began to give his personal testimony of how he was converted I love amen I love the way Paul did this because as he was giv his personal testimony AG gria say you almost persuade me to become a Christian now I want you to understand Paul was a man that wrote two-thirds of the New Testament and Paul never used Mysteries to try to persuade amen uh king of grippa Paul used his personal testimony of what God had done in his life Hallelujah all people need to hear is your personal testimony what God has done yes sir yes sir oh I I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm here to tell you I'm here to tell you I I mean when I talk when I think about this subject amen I don't look like what I've been through amen I I think about my brother-in-law brother Smiley you know he gives his personal testimony to us uh you know he tells us how God delivered him from a life of drugs and when he told y'all the last time how he took me down into that that area he I thought I was somebody amen but when I went with him into that area right here in my city when I went down there I realized I was no nobody amen but he tells us his testimony where God brought him from and he can walk back down into an area like that and them guys knew something that changed and Willie smileing hallelujah hallelujah but when he tells them what God brought him from and what God did for him holl come on somebody look I don't need to explain to you the mysteries of what brother brandom said here and what brother brandom said there I'm telling you when I came in contact with the message my personal testimony is that I have never been the same again there has been no relapse there has been no going back and when you look at me today I don't look like what I've been through you would never know that was old me until I told you the story sometime people just need to know the personal testimony the the reason our brothers holding to this message because they had a real experience with God try this and try that pray get down and pray get down and pray and say thank you Jesus thank you Jesus thank you Jesus thank you Jesus thank you Jesus than just say it as fast as you can say the thank you Jesus and was nothing there I go right back and do the same thing I was doing that's right after the thank you Jesus yes sir met one brother who told him when the pastor come here pray with you and you know you you you you know this thing going to be over okay Pastor said get down on your knees uh okay pray a simple prayer get up get up what about the thank you Jesus thank you Jesus thank you Jesus thank you Jesus no no no get up you don't need none of that right now just get up start walking in what God has done for you Hallelujah went back out there and start just working on the building come on didn't feel nothing that's what brother Troy was talking about about the Holy Ghost without sensation didn't feel nothing didn't hear nothing didn't see nothing but I [Applause] [Music] know I know something happened to me I can put my steak down way back then in that office on T Avenue something happened in me and I've never been the [Music] [Applause] same look don't so so we don't have talk about the Mysteries let's talk about how my life was changed that's that's this what Paul was doing just giving his personal testimony look I was I was on the road to Damascus and as I was on the road to Damascus I mean I I'm just riding along I'm going down there to kill some Christians these so-called Christians I didn't know I become one of them but I'm on my way to kill him so and you know and I had l I to go down there and kill we were going to take care of some business but there was a great light that shined from Heaven knocked me off my high horse and I I mean the sun is shot in the middle of the day but this light was greater than the sun knock me off of my horse it was other people there witnessing it it said and when they knock me down you know I I begin to talk to it I didn't know what to do so I said who art thou Lord right I didn't know the talk to it and it would talk back to me but it spoke back to me it said I am Jesus the one you persecuting well where was Jesus if this was Jesus that was being persecuted where was Jesus Jesus was in his people yes sir oh Hallelujah if you're going through persecution this morning they're not persecuting you they're persecuting the god in inside of you you ought to Rejoice to know that they see Christ inside of you Hallelujah amul Paul Paul said this is my testimony uhuh gria say you know man you almost persuade me to become a Christian I I I I I I wish I wish I could but Paul went through these things knowing that he had a promise from God that he was going to still make it to Rome you going to Bear witness of me in Rome and and and and I love the the first part before he tell that be of good cheer catch that one be of good cheer now I got a I got a end result I know your end result but in the midst of it don't be complaining now don't be crying don't be doing any that be of good cheer sir have an attitude of gratitude I Will Bless The Lord at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth my soul shall make a boast in the Lord The Humble shall hear there of and be glad and find a neighbor magnify the Lord with me let us exalt his name together hallelujah hallelujah church but Paul is going through these things and amen and and and we find uh uh in in Acts 27 before he makes it to Rome he got hit with a tempestuous wind the Bible called the Bible named the storm eurocin this was a hurricane now it's one thing to get here with a hurricane and your on land and you got your windows all boarded up and and all these other things it's one thing to get struck by a hurricane on land but when you are in the ocean come on and you at you at the uh you you at the mercy of the water right you in the middle of an ocean and a hurricane comes true and still God tell you be of good cheer in the midst of a hurricane on the ocean now that that that's a different story but yet Paul has a amen a confidence that I know I'm going to make it to Rome no matter what hits me out here on this seat I don't know how I'm going get to Rome but I'mma make it to Rome if God got to bring a wh like he did Jonah I am way to roll while Paul was on the ship yly and H him Paul was encouraged by the angel of Lord to you know just don't worry you're going to make it through this and he says and everyone that's on the ship I've given you they was threatening to kill all the soldiers and and some of them was trying to get out the ship get on the little small ships to try to go Paul said no no no no don't do don't do that you better stay on the boat he says everybody that's on this ship God going to give them to me uhhuh and so y'all don't worry about it God got we got this thing under control and everybody got a piece at least the the the soldiers got a piece because Paul was on the boat right and Paul was the one with the promise that he's going to Rome so Paul has to amen the ship becomes Shipwrecked through the you know through through what we read in the scripture and and I like I love the pl the the the little piece there because uh Paul told him say now I know a shipwreck and y'all that can swim swim on up to the shore so but if you can't swim grab a hold of some of the floating woods and see brother wco first sermon that he ever preached is you can make it on broken pieces so if you can't swim just grab one of the broken pieces of the ship and just swim on up you might not have strip to make those Strokes yourself but grab a hold of the boats and you can make it on broken pieces Hallelujah Paul gets there to the island he don't went through shipwreck done swimmed up to the to the land and now he's Building A Fire come on somebody and while he's building a fire just trying to get warm sticks his hand out and get bit by a serpent you talking about a man that's going through all kind stuff a man that had to be patient with God a man that had to be of good cheer when he got bit Paul remembered the promise hey come on somebody Fage couldn't take me out AG gria couldn't take me out come on fix can take me out and this snake bik no chance you know what Paul did it's the same thing all of us need to do y'all going to make me Shout y'all going to make me shout hallelujah y'all going to make me shout in here you need to practice that right now Shake It Off shake it off it can't bother you it can't trouble you shake it off shake off your trial shake off your trouble glory to [Applause] God hallelujah remember the prophet say when you've done everything exactly the way he said do it and it seemed like it went wrong stand still be [Music] patient Paul didn't talk to the snake Paul didn't rebuke the snake took the Venom from the snake amen because he was under promise the angel of the Lord told him you are going to Rome and there's nothing that can stop you from making it to Rong amen that's why he had the confidence just to shake it off and and the people sitting around like oh this man I know he done did something now he might have made it through that storm but this he won't make it through this right when they when Paul shook it off next thing you know they went to get all they sick so this man right here this is a God that's come down to the Earth they didn't realize God was in this man amen that was on the earth and when they went and got they went and got went got a sick brought all the sick there to Paul and man pray for them cuz man you got you got something look look they would have never known who Paul was had he not gone through what he Dida right amen he was just a normal guy a prisoner right not a prisoner to uh Felix and and Festus but a prisoner to Jesus Christ yes sir come on somebody I want to tell you something when you're facing your cider you're still in the perfect will of [Music] godall Hallelujah sir don't let the devil try to trick you when you are in the midst of eurocon yes sir and see down here in Florida they name the storms every storm get a name tropical storms get a name but no matter what and sometime these storms just come out of nowhere you ain't even got time to prepare you still in the perfect will of God he'll make a way some some way and I know that amen amen thank you Lord here in this message God called man brother brandom makes a statement it says God has to get a man away from the things of the world so he can get him quiet can I just can I amen just uh this is important don't when when when you know even when you're going through a trial don't don't be so figy right right and talking and no be quiet be still be be very still see the devil want you talking so much much that you actually miss God that's right you know and and Elijah heard a still Small Voice right and God comeing very he comes quietly and and you got to be quiet to be able to hear him sometimes just too much noise going on and you got to get away somewhere quiet where you can really hear the voice of God hello somebody not just the voice of some brother some sister you need to hear the voice of God not even just the voice of the pastor you need to truly hear the voice of God again amen and then when you sit down and talk with the pastor most likely you get a confirmation that you heard the voice of God cuz if Pastor saying something different uh-uh somebody ain't speaking right here and especially the pastor give you the Bible Hallelujah so when God speaking he got to always take you back to his word and you just got to wait on it sometime you got to be patient and wait God is not a microwave God the Bible say in patience do you possess your souls so you got to learn how to just wait in patience sometime it might take a year it might take two years if you're like Abraham it'll take 25 years now let me let me ask you question while Abraham was waiting what was he doing he was continually amen he he was giving God praise continually while he was waiting he was praising yes while you're waiting I'm giving you advice I'm G don't well Lord I've been waiting on you for how I don't know how long you ain't said nothing yeah you ain't going to get nothing with that attitude that's sir y'all we got to stop putting God on our level no he is God he's the one in control we're not in control he's the one that's in control he the one that made it all so we don't put them on our level you ain't did this you ain't now every time you make make a decision while you waiting that's against the decision that God wants you to do you just going to have to wait a little bit longer some of y'all didn't experience that but you learn how to just wait on the Lord be patient stand still get quiet where am I 44 God has to get a man away from the things of the world so he can get him quiet so he can talk to God no sometime you I'm going tell you sometime in prayer you want to know one of the most sweetest times in prayer is when you stop stop just to listen I mean sit there don't move to you hear something to hear God speak to you just stop and listen not talking all the time listen amen he can get him get him quiet so he can listen to God that still Small Voice then once in contact with God he becomes Fearless then notice that he don't care what anyone says he's been in the presence of God he knows God in the power of his resurrection praise the Lord amen um there's different ones that we can look at in scripture and after the trial I mean they faced tremendous trials but after God brought them through quickly you can say man that guy don't look like what he went through Daniel was one of those people I mean Lions then brother you inside I mean the Lions ain't been fed for days not one lion lions many of them ain't been fed for days no meat this man comes in as fresh meat fresh meat and somehow the Lions decide to go on a fast how does this happen but before he went in the the the king told say Daniel don't worry yes sir a unbelie Bel right right well actually they secret Believers but this man said don't worry Daniel you're God sir amen I I tried to set you free I tried to deliver you I tried to change the law Daniel but I couldn't but your God will deliver you Daniel and I can just imagine Daniel looking at the king and saying y'all going to help me preach tonight I know he going to deliver me I don't know how but I know he going to bring me out goes on in that Lions then with peace and and and and and and and and by him going in God sent an angel which was a pillar of fire inside the Lion's Den the lions are afraid of the fire so it kept the lions at Bay and lion I mean here the Lions laying there and D just laying there praying and and thanking God I'm sure he got a good sleep that night early the sunrise the king running down to am man this cave like and just screaming Daniel name Daniel D like oh shaking himself from sleep yes sir uh uhh uh King what you need Daniel you okay oh yeah yeah I'm good I'm good it's it's all good Dam you mean the Lions the Lions didn't do nothing the Lord sent his angel in here and and and God took care of everything I'm I'm good get him out of there get him out of there right now brought Daniel out and boy when they looked at Dan man you don't look like you don't look nothing like what you just been through and they knew the lions were hungry so them same fellas that was scheming them same fellas that was plotting so you got to be careful as you building Gallows for your neighbor you might hang from them Gallows yourself come on somebody so he say say we say all them fell that came up with this thing against Daniel take them and their families and throw them in the Lion's Den now the lion see if they would ate one man they wouldn't have been able to have a smokers board God brought Daniel through that he didn't look like what he went through am here in a message uh Redemption Inc completeness in Joy Redemption and completeness in Joy

out of them all God brings you right up facing with it so he can show you his power and his goodness oh I love it let me just keep reading here in this he says like I heard the story of the Shepherd in Jerusalem who had broke his sheep's leg they said why you you Cru Shepherd why did you break the Sheep's leg said well she didn't act like she loved me so I thought I'd just break her leg so I could I have to give her some special attention and then she loved me from then on sometimes God has to lay you on your back with a sickness that the doctor says you're going to die God give you God could give you a little special treatment so you'll love him a little more that's right some through the waters some through the flood some through deep trials but all through the blood Jesus leads his church you know another person in in Scripture that we could look at amen there there there there's a few of them um we know about the Hebrew boys when you know all three of them being thrown in a fire and uh and as they're going through this tremendous trial and again it's not going to the trial but it's going through the trial it wouldn't mean that much to us if they would have told us they almost got burned no no no no no no what meant a lot to like say what they got thrown in the fire and then the scripture records that as the as as as as Nebuchadnezzar got his strongest men right to throw them bind them and throw them in fire the strong men died right but the Hebrew boys was walking through the fire how somehow they we threw them in tied up but now they've been loosed and and and can I you know they was in the fire hands up I mean just they weren't in there complaining they were they were in the fire rejoicing amen and even even even even uh the king like now wait a minute I'm looking at this how many guys did we throw in the fire I I know I can count at least to to to three or four I ain't that but I I'm I I mean I I know I can count that far we threw three in who's the fourth one and he look like the Son of God how did the king of I mean the Nebuchadnezzar even know what the Son of God look like but he looked like the Son of God hallelujah sometime and and and and I want I'm sure that the Hebrew boys saw him in there too but if they didn't see him sometime other people can see that there's somebody with you that you don't even see [Applause] yourself they they can see your strength and they want to it's not it's not even humanly possible to have the strength that you got it's not even humanly possible to have the resolve that you got and that's why you can look people in their eye I don't look like what I've been through and I don't look like what I'm going through he promised never to leave you nor forsake you that's that's his promise them Hebrew boys sitting there just rejoicing like I don't know what and here's the thing when they come out the fire you couldn't smell smoke on them Lord they clothes didn't look burned feet didn't look I mean and I mean like what the testimony probably went all around the provinces sir these boys made it through the fire not just not just the fire we heated it seven times harder than it had ever been yeah but these boys don't look like what we just sent them through what something about when God is with you in the midst of whatever you're going through he gives you he gives you Grace to be able to withstand it I think about John John was put on the aisle of patmas uh I mean he this man just punished for all kind of things but before he went to the AIS of patmas they thought this this religion that this fell got we we we we we got to get rid of this man they took John and got a big old pot of grease and it's actually more than a pot cuz I can't fit no man in no pot but big old boiler what cauldron Okay Cauldron thank you dear uh big old cauldron stuck them and just had it boiling and just grease just boiling pop pop pop you can the grease just pop some of y'all have been popped by Grease just just a little bit of you cooking and you just get hit by the grease and and now I'm going tell you something there's a secret to that when you're cooking you get hit by Grease if you would just do this like Paul it won't create no problems but you oh go to the hospital right now you're going to have all kind of problems that's the truth brother but brother brandom said he said just just shake it off like that you get you just shake it off he he taught us that and as Believers we got to come to that place just just shake it off sh anything that that you I'm I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing cooking for my family Satan I ain't going to let you put that scar on me shake that thing off as a Believer you can do that that's the [Applause] trth John I mean and those that have experienced it you know now John is not just getting popped by one little thing on his arm John is being thrown into the boiling grease not just thrown into it left there for 24 hours now they thought this man would be you know there's there nothing left of John we got rid of John but they come back and John is still joh like y'all got any on fire this fire ain't doing nothing here y'all got Mo what what what else can y'all do this ain't got nothing on me and they said this man's a witch no he not a witch he's a Son of God say this man be witch to Greece no no no no no you just threw a son of God in Greece and God ain't finished with his life can I tell y'all something the devil can't do nothing to you until God is finished John come out that grease look at them people I know I don't look like yeah amen amen what I just been through then they take him and isolate him on patmas amongst the snakes and everything else and while he's over there on patmas get caught up in the spirit on the Lord's day and writes the entire Book of Revelations I I got some things I can say that John John John John was a man that walked with the Lord Jesus but why that John gets so mixed up that in Revelation 19 and 22 John bowed down before the angel that was showing him what was in the Book of Revelation he walk with Jesus how could John get that confused right I'm I'm just I'm just saying these things now if John who wrote the Bible can be that confused and you going to sit here and tell me God didn't send a prophet what John Saw made John want to worship that's right and the prophet had to tell him now I know I know it's a prophet because he say he say don't don't worship me John like that because I'm of your fellow servants the prophets right that's what the Bible and John John John he said said no no no no no don't do that John don't worship me worship God Amen come on somebody and we had a prophet in this day that would not receive worship from any man he wanted to come off the field because the people would doing those things so we got a pro no I'm going say it like this we don't just have a prophet we have the same Prophet that John was trying to worship that's the truth am amen he was just a future prophet in John's day God is not just a god of the past God is a god of present tense and God of future tense so the angel that John was trying to worship is the same angel that revealed all the Book of Revelations to us oh glory amen we might as well just let the people know the truth yes sir than all right I'm going on John come out that boiling grease with a testimony I don't look like what I just went through and and see it's not me I can let me just put it up it's not me that gives me that preserves that look this ain't nothing but the grace of God right here in the message of seven Church agents brother brandom says um John his Destiny was met like this was caught and boiled in a vat of grease for 24 hours of hot boiling grease and without any harm coming to him and they put him on the owl as commonly believed as a witch he Bewitched the grease so it wouldn't burn him it said of course it was the power of God he says uh you can't boil the Holy Spirit out of a man well so they tried to boil it out of him but God wouldn't permit it and he had a work for him to do and until God was finished with his man there's nothing in the world can bother him that's all says now John being old that they are told by uh historians that he was brought to the church to preach and he was so old the only thing he would say was little children love one another I tell you that's a very good thing to preach on little children love one another as I get older in the ministry now about in my 21st year I think all the time as I go along that this the more I think of the Lord Jesus the more I begin to find out that love is love that covers the whole thing the love of God shed abroad in our heart by the holy spirit amen amen all right uh I got a couple more things that I want to just share and I'm going to um depart you know I was thinking on um thinking on brother brother Leon and brother Leighton was dead for seven minutes in um at at Raptor and Faith Tabernacle we had meetings and brother Leon dropped dead right there in the middle of services they prayed for him brother Billy Paul was there at those meetings amen uh they prayed for him and the Lord restored brother Leon back to life and we saw brother Leon come from the back room with no pulse back into the service of the Lord with his hands lifted and and we've gone back and forth to uh brother Nathan's Church brother Lon up there leading prayer request or whatever and we look at the man he don't look like what he went through Lazarus he don't look like what he went through even our lord Jesus was in the grave for 3 Days come on somebody and and and and what they told us that see the reason he had to come up before the 72 hours is that because they say the nose begin to sink in and uh all these things begin to happen to the body the body's just breaking down breaking down breaking down breaking down but even that process of breaking down had to come to a halt because there was there was a word spoken that within three days that he would rise again and my god when Jesus got up from the grave the disciples can look at him the the the the the the the leaders of the city all of them can look at man you don't look like what you just went through the only thing he brought back to show that what he went through was some nail scars in his hands and in his feet they knew they had killed him but it didn't look like what he went through and if he can if if if he could keep himself if he can keep Lazarus he can show keep [Applause] you and it's not a if I know let me read this last quote out of possessing the enemy's Gates says was Moses after being also in the line of this Royal seed the seed of of Abraham that he was sent down into Egypt to deliver the children of Israel and God had given him signs and wonders to perform and to Smite the Earth to bring forth frogs and fleas and darkness and hell and rain and fire and had done all these Miracles yet when he had them out when he led them out by the hand of Jehovah there come a time when he met the gate between him and the Promised Land there was a Red Sea a bar across the way they were hemmed in by Pharaoh's armies Army mountains and deserts and the Red Sea but Moses stepped forward and possessed the Gate of his enemy and crossed the Red Sea drot and he was walking on a dusty road can you imagine that the sea is a dusty road ye shall possess the Gate of the enemy God said so and that settles it he says a few years later when the Trials come and the church got All Shook Up as it's so easy for a Congregation of people to do when something just don't seem to happen the way that it's supposed to be God makes it that way look at this God brings tensions into the church God does it we blame on the devil no God bring tension into the church for every son that comes to God must be tried and proven and tested he lets sickness strike you he lets diseases come on you to test you and to prove you to show the world that you're truly the Seed of Abraham he permits it by his own will he permits disasters he permits friends to turn against you he permits all these things and turns the devil loose to tempt you and he will do all but take your life he could throw you on a bed of Affliction he could turn your neighbors against you he could turn the church against you he can do most anything and it's God's will for him to do it we are taught that it is more precious then go let's read these two last scriptures your trial is more preci prous than go 1 Peter 1:7 and then 1 Peter 4 these two last scriptures 1 Peter 1:7 says this the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth that it be tried with fire it might be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ 1 Peter chapter 4: 12 and 133 Oh Glory to God let me encourage you beloved oh yeah think it not strange concerning the fiery trial here it is which is future tense to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you you got some advice here some practical application but Rejoice Paul was told be of good cheer I tell you be of good cheer and rejoice in as much as ye are partakers of Christ sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed ye may be glad also with exceeding Joy Church you don't look like what you've been through God bless you God
