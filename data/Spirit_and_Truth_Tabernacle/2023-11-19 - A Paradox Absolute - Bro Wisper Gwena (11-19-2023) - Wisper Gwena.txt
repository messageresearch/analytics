just bow our heads for a word of prayer Mighty and eternal heavenly father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ father we come before your presence Lord father with this little addition that you've added to the family Lord how I'm reminded of the time when your Prophet took his own grandson and Lord brought him for dedication how he was also reminded lord of the days of Jacob when he had to take his grandchildren and he put a blessing upon them a blessing that lasted Lord as the prophet says for many a years father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Lord I hold in my hand little baby Ariana anashe Lord father God Almighty being brought into the house of the Lord father the parents admitting oh God that they cannot take care of this child they are only Earthly stewards Lord but father you are the true heavenly father father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we're taking this little baby father far from the wordss of sin far from the evils of this world father we are placing this child under the blood of Jesus Christ May the blood of Jesus Christ protect this child from hence forth oh God lord we dedicate Le to Ariana Lord father before your throne great Jehovah to ask that if there is a tomorrow Lord may she grow to become a Piller Lord father Lord God Almighty true Christian oh god father we are taught in the Bible of a Phillip who had four daughters Lord who all

the way and never get you to sing one song I'll in trouble with the [Music] church so we're going to do what God allows us to do amen how many are under expectation amen shall we stand for the reading of the word [Music] amen praise the Lord wonderful that's great thank you sir in the Book of Joshua Joshua chapter 4 starting from verse one and it came to pass when all the people wake clean pasted over Jordan that the Lord spake unto Joshua saying take you 12 men out of the people out of every tribe a man and command ye them saying take your hands out of the midst of Jordan out of the place where the priest fits stood fir 12 Stones and he shall carry them over with you and leave them in the lodging place where you shall Lodge this night then Joshua called the 12 men whom he had prepared of the children of Israel out of every tribe a man and Joshua said unto them pass over before the Ark of the Lord your God into the midst of Jordan and take ye up every man of us Stone upon his shoulder and according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel that this may be a sign among you that when your children ask their fathers in time to come saying what mean ye by these stones then he shall answer them that the Waters of Jordan were cut off before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord when it passed over Jordan the Waters of Jordan were cut off and the stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel forever amen then another portion of scripture The Book of John chapter 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything mad that was mad and then in verse 14 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt amongst us verse 10 and he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not may God Ed his Blessing to the reading of his word we may be seated as we just bow our heads for a word of prayer Mighty and eternal heavenly father father we are so grateful for the opportunity to come into your house for the opportunity to read your word for the opportunity to Fellowship around the same father but we realize that as men we cannot handle the word Lord father this takes you and you alone Lord I therefore confess my inabilities Lord and I ask you great Jehovah that you can step in at this time father we pray that you can have your own way we pray that you can take over the service from hence forth Lord I pray that you can be Lord father the speaker in the he may we all sit together in them Heavenly places in Christ Jesus father we are surrendering all things from hence forth even into thy hands increase Lord as we all decrease in Jesus Christ's namej amen amen praise the Lord God bless you allow me to just take off my jacket praise the Lord L how many are under expectation am the prophet says you get according to what you expect Hallelujah hey God bless you Brother Joseph good to see you sir how you doing praise the Lord he is a real blessing this young man amen and good to see brother Johnson together with a wife amen we the're regulars now of London right praise the Lord amen by God's grace I I want to take a title and the title that I want to speak on is a paradox absolute right amen the Lord was um you know just leading me to this and uh you know as a preacher you preach all the time and you wonder so what am I going to preach um now that I have to preach here right and uh you just don't know which way to go yes sir and um I um was just trying to find the direction of the Lord and I knew as well that I had to bring a baby dedication uh and then something kind of like excited me um when I looked at um you know the prophet dedicating his um grandson how many know what seron that was was in it was in the seron Paradox so I said okay so I think I'm on the right track I'd already been looking at a paradox so by God's grace I I want to look at this title a paradox absolute right uh a bit of a strange title but I hope that it will make sense as as we are going along the way now we know that when the prophet preached um he actually preached on these two words um something has disappeared right uh he preached on on these two words a paradox um it was um a seron in its own right and then he preached on an absolute again it was a seron in its own right and um I'm taking this two words and I'm coming up with this title and it is a paradox absolute amen now it looks as if I'm just taking two words here that the prophet preached on and I'm coming up with something uh you know that maybe just taking two semmons but I want to say that there's actually a meaning to this amen there's actually a meaning to that title when we look at it is a paradox absolute amen how do you mean Preacher Man that there is a meaning to it when the prophet preached these two messages he actually started by giving a definition of those two words and we know he went right back to the dictionary and that's where he picked um the the definitions of these two words the prophet of God says in the message absolute he says according to Webster's Dictionary says it's perfect in itself Unlimited in power primarily an ultimate right that's an absolute so it's an ultimate amen amen then he took the definition of a paradox and the definition of a paradox according to uh the dictionary he says in the Webster dictionary it says that a paradox means something that's incredible but true that is a paradox something that's almost completely out of Reason couldn't be so but yet it is that's a paradox I like that bit couldn't be so right but yet it is I really like that part glory amen because it it tells us then what a paradox really is it looks like it can be so but yet it is amen amen now bringing these two words together a paradox absolute amen an absolute is something that is an ultimate a paradox is something that couldn't be so but yet it is so I'm talking about an absolute an ultimate that looks like it couldn't be so but yet it is hallelujah so it's a paradox absolute looks like it can be an absolute but yet it is are you with me yes amen and for a subject I want to be looking at from an absolute to a paradox making an absolute Hallelujah that's why it looks like it couldn't be so but yet it is all right amen praise the Lord amen now we' have already read amen what the definition of these words are amen and we understand that an absolute is something that is perfect in itself something Unlimited in power primarily in Ultimate but the prophet then also gave us further definitions of this and he says in the message absolute and absolute it's used many times it's the last word it's the amen you hear people say absolutely the that's it that's the last thing it's ultimate it's unlimited sorry that takes from here on there's nothing else in its way it's the Supreme hallelujah it's an ultimate and an ultimate is whenn primarily in Ultimate because you have reached the end Glory it's the amen that's Allelujah that's an absolute amen and the prophet of God then says and therefore I think that everybody should have an ultimate yes sir and every great achievement that's ever been achieved there's been an absolute behind it no matter what it was is had an absolute behind it and every person in order to achieve something has to First have the absolute all right I like that right and that's the final wine back through this that back through the other till you come to that absolute or that I that amen or that ultimate watch this every person that has ever achieved something first they've had to have an absolute amen and the prophet says everybody must have an ultimate Hallelujah then he goes on and he says you got something you have to tie to in other words It's the final tying post to every achievement it's somewhere it might wind through many different things till it gets to the typos but there is the amen to all of it there must be such a thing you cannot go through life without having one that's right that's right amen that's right or do me a favor and tell your neighbor you cannot go through life without having an absolute amen hallelujah it's impossible to go through life without having an absolute amen something that is supreme something that is in Ultimate something that overrules your thinking something that overrules your feeling something that overrules your entire perceptions Hallelujah and your entire perspectives something that overuse it that's an absolute yes it is where the arguments end can you say Amen that when there are difference in opinions when there are difference in perceptions when you come to an absolute the absolute should silence everything should bring a finality to whatever the argument is that's an ultimate and the prophet of God then tells us but God's absolute is his word he gives it and heavens and earth will pass away but it shall never pass away and the prophet says I like that and I like that too God's word is he absolute can you say amen amen God's word why does it become an absolute because it is unchanging Glory everything else in life can change amen but when we come to an absolute It's the final right we have come to the end there is no more change right amen so God's word is an absolute it is the tying post it is the unending amen the final of everything we have come to the amen hallelujah are you with me yes sir that becomes a Time post praise be to God now then when you have the word of God as your tying post as your final as your absolute then you can go through life why can you go through life because life is very fluid life is always Changing Times change environments change the way we think changes the way we look at things changes and as these things change we also change amen you change I change change depends on what side of the bed I wake up on if you wake up on the wrong side of the bed you're completely going south isn't it because you are a changing being you need something that doesn't change that when you wake up on the wrong side of the bed there is something that brings you on the right path and that becomes the absolute Oh Glory to God hallu hallelujah can you say amen amen so you need that absolute that you can tie yourself to that when life begins to change around you you have something that anchors you and the word of God the prophet tells us that it's an absolute amen and when you take that word as your absolute then you are tied to something that is not changing even if you have differences you can come to the absolute of the word and you can resolve your differences on the word but in order to use the word of God as an absolute it means the part is that are involved they all have to have the same absolute amen is that right because unless you believe in the same absolute you can never resolve your issues is that right that's why the Bible says in the book of amamos can two walk together except they be agreed so before two start to walk together there's got to be an agreement on an absolute that when my perceptions go this way and your perception go that way we can be brought to a Reconciliation by an absolute can two walk together unless there is an absolute am amen is that right Church the Bible also tells us in the book of 2 Corinthians chapter 6 it says be not unequally yed together with unbelievers why is the Bible teaching us this because they then is no absolute right brother you you don't have something that is in that is in common and you can never have a Reconciliation when there are arguments that come along the way and this principle applies right through life it applies in marriage that you can't have two people getting married amen unless they have the same absolute you got to have the same absolute Because unless you have the same absolute marriage is not an easy walk amen you difference in opinions you have one mind that is thinking another way another mind that is thinking another way but when you have an absolute praise be to God you can be brought together to something Hallelujah that can reconcile you that's why the prophet of God says and no believer should ever marry an unbeliever under no circumstances is that right Church why because then you will have the same absolute and it's important to have that same absolute otherwise how are you going to reconcile that marriage how are you going to go through that marriage we need an absolute in every marriage we need an absolute in every church we need an absolute in every home whatever the situation is you need to come to that ultimate where you can say here we rest our case Oh Glory to God am now not only must the word become an absolute in times of conflict but the word must become an absolute in every aspects of our lives are you with me when you have the word is an absolute in every aspect of your life then it does not matter what is changing in your life Oh Glory to God because you have something that is tying you something that is unchanging circumstances change environments change but the word remains unmovable Hallelujah your life situations are ever changing but the word remains unmovable life throws some negatives to you and when life throws some negatives I'm so glad that when you have the word as your absolute the word remains a positive that when life throws a negative at you there is still a positive that is anchored deep within your soul where you can say it does not matter what is going on it does not matter what is changing there but I got something that is positive Hall that when negative news comes your way you have a positive of the word hallelujah you have a different opinion Oh Glory to God in the highest then it does not matter what you have for what you don't have because when you have the word the word is a creative absolute H then what you don't have does not matter Hallelujah why because you can bring it to a creative absolute and that creative absolute it can produce a phoenix something coming out of nothing that when there is nothing Hallelujah the word can produce something I'm reminded of brother Tony zabel he was a deacon in brother branham's church then the went for I think it was the second set of squirel that he went hunting then when he went hunting and you know he killed the fourth squirel and the prophet of God says it kind of like felt it fell in a stamp how many know that c it fell in a stamp and the prophet says he went to look for that squirrel and he couldn't find it but he had spoken the squirrel into existence so when he came back to Camp amen then he started telling the people of the testimony of how God has created this squirrel then he said he couldn't find that other one then brother Ton's Bell when he was now praying he was asked to close in prayer for the night so the people could go and sleep then brother Tony zel started to pray and brother Tony said Lord we pray that when tomorrow brother Branham goes back into the hood that he finds that squirel that we might know that he's saying the truth and that really bothered the prophet and the prophet started getting concerned to say so what this really means is if I don't get the squir brother ton Isel is going to believe I was lying and I'm a prophet of God now found to be lying before the people and it really bothered the prophet and the prophet was so wound in that whole thing but God wanted to teach the prophet a lesson then is the prophet was so wound in that whole thing then God started to speak to him and the prophet then says and something say to me if it isn't there or if it is in there what makes the difference are you forgetting this church God is saying to the prophet whether you find the squirrel there or you don't find the squirrel there what difference does it make it doesn't make a difference and the prophet said I said he wouldn't believe me he prayed and said if we find the squirrel you will know that our brother has told us the truth and that anointing came amen and the great anointing come and it says just say the squir will be there and you will get him what was God teaching the prophet that the circumstances they don't matter whether it is there or is not there it does not matter what matters is the absolute inside of you is an absolute so speak the word just say it will be there and when you get there you will find it there oh come on Church of the Living God your circumstances don't matter what matters is the absolute that is in you if there is an absolute in you then you speak the word and that word is what is going to change circumstances can you say Amen somebody can you say Amen somebody oh let me say your situation is not got the final say s Hallelujah you have the final say s what happens in life does not have the final say so because it's not an absolute the absolute is the word of the Living God so you got to wait for the word when the word speaks the word is the final say so I'm beginning to feel religious right now glory to God in the highest Hallelujah the absolute is what made us Church what the doctor says does not matter what the doctor tells you does not matter he might tell you a whole long story but I'm here to tell you that does not matter what matters is what the absolute says the absolute says by his stripes you are healed so the doctor's testimony is of no consequence come on somebody say Amen somebody hallelujah what the boss at work says it does not matter because the boss does not have an absolute you can change the mind of the boss and we can change it in church you can change decisions that have been made somewhere else because what they say is not an absolute What God Says is what is in absolute can you say Amen somebody can you say Amen praise be to God in the highest everything else can change is that right sickness can change in fact you once were not sick that's right Hallelujah you once never used to have sugar diabetes you once never used to have blood pressure but it came somewhere along the way so something changed and by the same token I want to say it can also change back to a healing again it does not matter what the devil is trying to throw your away What God Says is what matters say Amen somebody glory to God in the highest when the absolute speaks it is what matters and the prophet of God tells us oh you know sometime when you take an absolute an absolute will lead you to a paradox oh how many are looking for a paradox something unbelievable something that looks like it is not so when you take the word the word will lead you to an absolute are you with me church that's right yes a paradox is something that's real but can be explained it's an absolute when you take the word the word will lead you to a paradox what is the prophet telling us here that what in absolute does in absolute POS the situation Hallelujah and it brings it to the environment of the absolute it does not matter what the situation was but it's got to comply with the environment of the absolute an absolute will panit the situation it will change the situation it will Forge the situation until it complies with the absolute I don't even care what you're going through right now but I got good news for you that the absolute of the word will turn your situation it will force your situation it will change your circumstances are you with me but if there is a sick body God pulls that sick body and brings it to the environment of the word and in the environment of the word there is no Sickness by his stripes you are healed if you are poor then the Bible says he raises the poor Out of the Dust of the earth so the word Bo you from your poverty and places you into the environment of the word and then in the environment of the word the word then says change your confession let the weak say let the poor say that's the word environment and as you begin to confess that it changes your circumstances if God causes your body to obey your confession oh say Amen someone glory to God in the highest so the absolute is what matters and God's word is the absolute and an absolute is something amen that is the anchor but a paradox is something that looks like it can be so but yet it is and the prophet also tells us a paradox is something that seems incredible but it's true therefore a paradox would be the same as a miracle are you with me he says a paradox is a miracle something that cannot be explained all right all right it could not be explained how that a quiro that was not in existence when the prophet spoke and he says let there be a squero existed are you with me now it means you're dwelling in a world of no difference that no matter what happens in your life just say it will be there and it will be there oh church I wish we can believe the word J I wish we can come to a place where we know how to take the the absolute until it produces a paradox in our lives Abraham one time he took that absolute all right God say to Father Abraham go and sacrifice your only son Abraham said yes Lord I know how to take an absolute he went to mount Mariah with his son going ready to go and sacrifice that boy sir and the prophet of God says he knew amen that if God had given him is almost from the dead the same God was able to raise him from the dead so he says if I kill him God can resurrect him so Abraham took his only son he raised up the knife ready to slay his own son taking the absolute but no sooner than he had now stretched his hand then God's voice came and he says Abraham Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah I see now that you believe me turn around and when he turned around then he saw a ram that was caught in a ticket that's right where did the r come from when he took the absolute It produced a paradox so when you take an absolute it leads you to a paradox is that right I read shadra mesek and abedo Shadrach mik and abedo they took the absolute of the word and when they took the absolute of the word they said oh King we are not careful to answer you in this but our God who we serve is able to deliver us the king had said who is able to deliver you from my hands he says we are not careful to answer you in this but our God who we serve is more than able oh Church you got to know what your God is able to do you got to know that he's able to take you out of every situation they said yes our God is able they took him amen as an absolute they said oh King you are not an absolute right he said I've heated the furnace seven times who is it that can take you out of my they said oh King you are not an absolute there's one that rules above all things when they were thrown in the fire they took that absolute and the absolute produced a Paradox and what was that Paradox a forth man in the fire Hallelujah is that right Church yes sir David when he looked at Goliad amen everyone was afraid of that golad but David says God you told me to be circumcised I'm in Israel circumcised on the eighth day and this Philistine is an uncircumcised Philistine and he went and he looked at him and he said you come to me with a spear and a sword but I come to you in the name of the Lord God of host who you have defied he said today golad your head is coming off he was taking an absolute he was not looking at the size of Goliath so was looking at the size of golad and he thought golad was an absolute but David says uhuh the absolute is the word all right yes sir God has already spoken about this and I'm taking the absolute of the word is the righteous whenever an absolute is taken it leads us to a paradox but let me move on as I come to my title amen amen I said my title is a paradox absolute all right and I said my subject is from a par from an absolute to a paradox producing an absolute now we've already seen that when you take an absolute it leads you to a paradox is that right yes now the prophet of God says oh you know sometime when you take an absolute an absolute will lead you to a paradox now when you go through the message in absolute this becomes quite clear and I know many years ago I preached on this just taking it from there when you take an absolute an absolute will lead you to a paradox is that right yes and we've done run through the scripture so we can have a loop right there that when you take an absolute an absolute will lead you to a paradox brother are you with me sir right right and that's quite clear when you read the message yes sir but I wonder how many of you have also picked the other part that the prophet of God pro brought I had never heard it myself until one of the days when I was listening to the message yes sir the prophet of God says in the message and absolute he says it's a paradox certainly do you believe in a paradox and that Paradox if it's according to the word of God it can be your absolute hello wow amen so the prophet says when you take an absolute it will lead you to a paradox but now he's turning around and he's saying that Paradox if it's according to the word of God it can become your absolute [Music] hallelujah oh glory to God oh Hallelujah and when I heard that that struck me real good brother Jack I said my thank God for the prophet Hallelujah in other words what the prophet of God is telling us here is that we can look back amen my when you take an absolute it leads you to a paradox but that paradox if it's according to the word of God it can become your absolute so it can Loop us right back oh that's deep Saints hallelujah how does this work out Preacher Man let's get into the word now the Bible says in the Book of Joshua which is the scripture that we read and the Lord said unto Joshua this day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel that they may know that as I was with Moses so I will be with you yes sir yes sir let me just say right here that there comes an hour when God says I will begin to magnify you you might have gone through life and life has treated you bad you might have gone through life and life has not elevated you but there comes an hour where God says from today I'll begin to magnify you oh let me just prophesy right in here and say from today somebody's lying God is going to begin to magnify it I don't know who can say Amen to it who can say that is my [Applause] portion Hallelujah but God says to Joshua how am I going to magnify you he says to Joshua the way I'm going to magnify you is I'm going to let you take the word so you take the ark and thou shalt command the priest that bear the Ark of the Covenant right saying when you come to the brink of the water of Jordan you shall stand still in Jordan right is that right right so the way God is going to magnify is by you taking an absolute because the ark is representing the word isn't it so you take the word Joshua get the priest to go with the word into the water so put the word ahead of you and as you put the word ahead of you the word will produce a paradox and the Paradox is what is going to magnify you yes sir hallelujah oh glory to God so right here I can as well say when God is about to magnify you he causes a paradox to come in your life and the Paradox is what magnifies you when people have said where is his God where is your God but when God answers with the power when God answers with a paradox when God shows that I am with you that par will begin to magnify you oh glory to God God send some paradoxes into the Church of the Living God that the people might know that there is a God in spirit and Truth Tabernacle we need the power of God uh to show us that there is a God that moves around us uh when the Paradox happens the Paradox magnifies you can you say Amen oh can we believe that the season of magnification is here today can we believe that the season of paradoxes is here today or you can have it if you believe it you can accept it and say yes I believe it and God will bring it your way Hallelujah so when they took the absolute they went over Jordan and they started to cross over Jordan they stepped into the water and the Waters of Jordan they parted that's right so the Ark produced a paradox right is that right right so taking the absolute it led them to a paradox but the scripture does not stop there then the scripture goes on and it says in Joshua chapter 1 and it came to pass when all the people were clean pasted over Jordan that the Lord spake unto Joshua saying take you 12 men out of the people out of every tribe and command ye them saying take your hands out of the midst of Jordan out of the place where the priest fit stood fam 12 Stones and you shall carry them over with you and leave them in the lodging place where you shall Lodge this night so God says to Joshua Now command that you get C out of every tribe let them get 12 Stones from the midst of the Jordan in other words whilst the Paradox is in session whilst the Waters of Jordan have departed whilst the people are standing on dry ground now you command these leaders of these tribes to go into the River Jordan let them pick up some Stones now these are not just Stones because he says Peck them on your shoulder the strongest part of a man so these were real big borders is that right so God says command them let them go into the midst of the River Jordan and let them take the stones and let them carry them to the place where you shall lodge tonight but why are they doing this verse number six that this may be a sign among you that when your children ask their fathers in the time to come saying what mean ye by these stores then you shall answer them that the Waters of Jordan were cut off before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord when it passed over Jordan the Waters of Jordan were cut off and these Stones shall be a memorial for a memorial and to the children of Israel forever now let me just explain the Saints so Joshua is commanded you take 12 Stones out of there you took the word and you let the the absolute lead the way and the absolute produced a paradox now whilst the Paradox is in ination now you take stones from the Paradox because a few moments after that the Paradox is going to close River Jordan shall flood again but when it floods you have had evidence Oh Glory to God that you passed on dry ground now you keep that evidence and you take that praise be to God and go ah and put it in the camp where you are now going to stay overnight why are you doing it then God says that it might be for a memorial that when your children shall ask you you can say to them we walked over dry ground across the river Jordan praise be to God in the high so what was God saying God was saying right when the Paradox is in session now you take these stones and bring them into the camp let your children ask you in the future bring them back to these stones and say son you look at these Stones Oh Glory to God these Stones they were not here before they came from the midst of the River Jordan when we pass through the River Jordan so the god that parted the River Jordan is a living God because by this evidence I can tell you that we passed over the river Jordan and as they begin to tell them about those stones Hallelujah the stones Hallelujah will begin to raise the faith in the children so the stones will begin to preach a message even unto the children uh the Bible says faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word but now Faith is coming by looking so in other words when you're looking at the stones the stones are going to preach a silent message and the silent message is the god that ped the River Jordan he's a living God then you can say where is the god of Joshua where is the god that ped the River Jordan so the stones will become preachers Hallelujah they will preach a message it can be done they will preach a message River Jordan is crossable they will preach a message Hallelujah so yes you parted the River Jordan It produced an absolute but that absolute now it must become a manifested absolute this was an absolute word but the absolute word then changes to become a manifested absolute Hallelujah and I like it when we come to a manifested absolute because now we are not talking Theory we are now talking evidence to say God said but this is that which the Lord God spoke about Oh Glory to God this here is that that God spoke about Oh Glory to God in the highest this is now a manifested attribute a manifested absolute rather that was the word the word told us to go through the River Jordan but this year is the evidence that the word came to pass yes oh brother when you come to this is that that is the highest form of the word of God can you say Amen because in the Bible the book in the book of Acts chapter 2 the Bible tells us of the story of Joel that Peter is courting it says Joel said and it shall come to pass in the last days sayth the Lord I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams but in ex chapter 2: 16 Peter said this is that this was prophesy here but what you are looking at now oh glory to God this is that oh Hallelujah in other words the word has become flesh the word has materialized the word has manifested itself glory to God in the highest so the word church is got to come to a place where it becomes the manifested word are you with me and when it becomes a manifested word that becomes your absolute amen amen amen so now we can go back to our Loop we have an absolute it leads you to a paradox but the Paradox takes you back and the the Paradox takes you back to becom an absolute and we can run this pattern right through the Bible amen because we can look at even the children of Israel sir God had given a prophecy in the Book of Genesis that the Seed of Abraham shall so Jour in a strength land for 400 years and God says after 400 years I will come down and I will deliver them amen so we had the word then hallelujah and that word gave a promise this children of Israel will be in Egypt for 400 years but after 400 years I'll deliver them with a mighty hand is the word prophesying is that right is the absolute that is spoken yes sir is that right but when the hour of the Deliverance came then what did God do then God comes in Exodus chapter number three praise the Lord and he meets Moses by a bing Bush yes and he says I've heard the crowning of my people and I've come down to deliver them now you go and take them out of the land of Egypt so Moses sees now a paradox right is that right yes sir but what was that Paradox it was in the form of a Benning Bush all right is that right yes sir because the promise produced a paradox and the Paradox was God stepping down from Glory coming upon Mount HB Hallelujah in a burning bush glory and he saw a bush that was burning but the Bush was not getting consumed a paradox right brother and he says there is a paradox here let me stop and see the Paradox is that right and when he stopped to see the Paradox then out of the Paradox came a voice yes sir so the Paradox changes to become a word all right oh glory to God the voice came out of the Paradox and when the voice came out of the Paradox the Paradox became a word can you say amen I have seen the Affliction of my people and I've come down to deliver them the word coming out of the pillar of fire the Paradox that Moses was looking at Hallelujah Glory then the prophet of God says Moses hidden absolute when he met that burning bush that was an absolute to him right so what became the absolute the burning bush right right amen not the word but the burning bush so the burning bush became an absolute Hallelujah so the word had given a promise the promise produced a paradox but the Paradox which was in a burning bush it became an absolute to Moses and the prophet says that became an absolute that's right not only did it become an absolute in the burning bush but the very same God then spoke to Moses and he says I'm giving you this as a token right you shall come back onto this mountain and you shall save me on this mountain it became a token unto Moses the absolute Hallelujah it became Hal the Paradox became an absolute to lead Moses back to it so it looks right back is that right let me let me give you another example how do does God Speak To His prophets he speaks to His prophets through Visions is that right Numbers chapter 12 and he said hear now my words if there be a prophet among you I the Lord will make myself known unto him in a vision and will speak unto him in a dream is that right amen so God when he has his word his word amen it becomes a vision and the vision itself leads to a paradox right is that right so when the prophet sees a vision which is the word of God that Vision becomes a paradox when it becomes manifested is that right amen right that's why you find a man a prophet is able to talk about what is going to happen in the future and is's able to go back to what happened in the past and produces a paradox right in front of you why he's catching a vision which is the word of God and is producing a paradox by the power of that Vision true and that's why why amen the prophet of God hallelujah he could stand on those Visions yes sir but now I want to say when Visions amen have happened so many times until they repeat and repeat until you know that these Visions come from God that's right then the Visions will become an absolute Oh Glory to godj and that's what happened with the prophet isn't it he got to a place where he knew that if God gives him a vision that Vision will God speaking it was the same as in absolute that's why when the prophet saw the vision of that Silver Tip grizzly bear come on as he was going towards where the other people were he said before we get to that place we are going to kill a silver tip grizzly bear and the prophet of God says in that land there was nothing that was higher than about that height right everything was less than a feet amen amen glory less than a foot tall everything and they could see right all the way across to where brother biscow and them were and this man that was walking with the prophet he started to speak to brother Branham and he said brother Branham did you say before we get to that place from here where we can see everything we are going to kill a silver tip grizzly bear and brother Bram said I say so because the vision say so and the man says but I can see nothing here brother Bram we can see where they are we can see where we are and there is no Silver Tip here and brother Bram turned to that brother and he says brother are you doubting the word all right come on come on glory to God what was the prophet basing his faith on that the vision was in absolute if there is no Silver Tip there the vision is able to create one and the vision can place him right there that's right amen and he says before we get there we are going to kill one yes sir and they started walking by and he says brother branam we we only just about so many meters away from there now you say there's going to be a silver te he says hey are you doubting it Hallelujah and no sooner than the prophet has say that then he says what is [Applause] that out of nowhere stood a silver tip grizzly bear and the prophet shot it and he killed it where did it come from taking in absolute producing a paradox glory to God in the highest the prophet of God tells us of another story of a sister that was called sister nma right all right she had a girl that had gone mental amen and she wanted brother Bram to come and pray for this child then brother Bram the doctor would not allow brother Bram to come in and pray for this girl but brother Brenham ended up you know getting to be like a friend and they said a friend is coming in to see this girl and the doctor then allowed it because he wouldn't allow the prophet to come in so he walked in as a friend and as he was praying for this girl then a vision broke and the prophet announced that a vision is just broke no sooner than the prophet announced that that sister Nom grabbed the Prophet by the legs and sister Noma screamed it has never failed amen as far as she was concerned it was done yes just by the vision and the prophet of God says now what was it that little lady used that Vision as an absolute an ultimate so it gets to a place where the vision can become your absolute is that right church so we bring it back to the loop Hallelujah the vision now becomes an absolute Hallelujah give God a end of Praise somebody Hallelujah but let me come to the greatest Absolut Hallelujah the greatest Paradox that we find written in the pages of the Bible my Bible says in the Book of John chapter one in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God what was in the beginning the absolute right the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made what is the Bible telling us that that absolute amen was the source of all creation everything that was created it came out of that absolute is that right church so we are starting from the word and we're starting from the word and we are moving from that word which is an absolute and that absolute then becomes a creative absolute and that creative absolute then it starts creating a world is that right now when something comes out of nothing then stands a paradox because when God said let there be glory to God when there was nothing then there was something that is an absolute amen creating a paradox so the word hallelujah is the scripture says all things were made by him without him was not anything made that was made so the word is the source of all creation is that right so in the beginning amen we heard the absolute which was the logos praise be to God and that absolute that was the logos amen was the creative absolute and out of it he said let there be and there was a creation and the creation was a paradox because it came out of nothing is that right yes sir but that was not the greatest Paradox amen the greatest Paradox was when that very word became flesh because the Bible then says in John 1:4 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt amongst us that's it that's it amen am he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not church that is a paradox how the god of creation how the god that created all can step into his own creation yes sir let me give you an example there is a guy that made that computer right computers can do very powerful things these days yes sir especially with artificial intelligence and everything they can do a whole lot of things these days but I give you to understand the guy that made that computer is not inside of that computer he's above and beyond that computer he cannot be in that computer because to make that computer he has to be outside of that computer but think about it that the guy that makes the computer computer changes himself to become a chip all right and he becomes part of the computer moving the elements inside of the computer and then he says and he became part of the computer and he was a chip in the computer right all things were made by him all right and yet they did not realize that he was part of [Applause] them the god of creation oh my yes he created all things but he stepped down from his glory to become part of the creation and we did not know him what a paradox that was so the greatest Paradox that ever existed Hallelujah it is when God became flesh when the word was made flesh when the god of creation became a creation and stepped into his own creation what a paradox that was yes sir amen but when that Paradox was now in flesh then as he was walking in the sins of Galilee think about it Church the god of Heaven Come On The God Who created the sins come on he's walking on top of the sints Oh Glory to God right he stepped down from his glory to become part of that creation but one day as he's walking on those SS then he opens his mouth and he says a s went out to S yeah Oh Glory to God that Paradox is changing form to become the words because when he begins to speak what is proceeding out of his mouth is no longer the Paradox but it is now the absolute all right all right amen unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part in me that became the word of the Living God the Paradox spoke and the Paradox changed to become the Absolut so we can Loop it back and we can say that Paradox he became the word and the word became our absolute now we can read back the prophet and the prophet says the word of God is our absolute give God a end of Praise right [Applause] there so we look back from a paradox to an absolute but that's not how the story ends right oh glory to God because when he was walking here praise be to God then one day in John chapter 16 he says nevertheless I tell you it is expedient for you that I go away for if I go not away the comforter will not come unto you Hallelujah so the absolute spoke and he says yeah it is needful that I go away because if I don't I will not come back unto you so now now we have a promise what is the promise that the comfort is going to come inside you and I oh glory to God that God who is an absolute is going to step back and come in your flesh and in my flesh why that Colossians chapter 1:27 might be fulfilled to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory Christ in you the hope of glory this is the promise of the absolute stepping down from Glory coming inside the Flesh of an individual the same one that said let there be coming inside of your flesh and my flesh the very God Of Heaven not another that's it are you hearing me to say are you hearing me church not another but the very same God the god of creation stepping down from Glory stepping into your flesh stepping into my flesh changing us to become paradoxes Christ in you the hope of glory Christ in you your converter to become a paradox and the prophet of God says for instance I believe that every Born Again member of the body of Christ is a paradox in themselves amen because something happened to you that Chang your whole being anyone could look at that and know what a paradox is is a miracle unless that happens you cannot be a Christian there must be a paradox for you to become a Christian so when you become a Christian when you are converted you have become a paradox oh let me say I'm looking at paradoxes Hallelujah do I have some Born Again Believers here lift up your hands if you're born again then I want to say you are a paradox you are a miracle Hallelujah you looking for miracles you are looking at Miracles right now you're looking out where is a miracle I a miracle you are a miracle because if you are a son of God then you are a miracle and let me tell you once a miracle always a miracle Miracles will always come to you you will attract Miracles because your name is Miracle your second nature is Miracle miracles happen by you all the time that's who you are praise be to God in the highest so Miracles are not going to happen somewhere else Miracles will happen in the bride Miracles will happen in those that have been born again can you say amen amen so we take the word of God and as we take the word of God the word comes to the bride and what happens when the word comes to the bride it produces a paradox the bride becomes a paradox are you with me this afternoon you are God's Paradox when God is inside of you you are a performer of Miracles yes oh glory to God Miracles follow you Hallelujah therefore let me say healing is yours let me say restoration is yours let me say salvation is yours let me say your heart's desire is yours oh it's already inside of you it's going to come from somewhere it's already in you even as I'm speaking right now it's already resident in you it's not going to come from Glory it's already inside of you believer th this when mother egole came down Mama igle did not come to convert that little iglet to become an egole Mama egole came to awaken the little iglet he says you are not a chicken you are an eagle and he says me the way I look he says look carefully the way you look you don't look like the world you are different from the world there is a power inside of you that can rise above the storms I don't know who I'm speaking to this afternoon but you are not a chicken you are bound for the highs you are bound for the skies you are bound above the storms you can rise High even this very afternoon uh you can rise above your situation uh can you say amen amen you are a paradox therefore expect paradoxes to happen in your life I don't know who said what to you but I'm saying forget that listen to what God is saying to you God is about to change your life God is going to change your circumstances God is going to bring you to what he wants you to be God is going to change you to what he wants you to come to give God a hand of praise and somebody says how is it going to happen I don't know but I can only say paradoxically he's going to do it by a paradox unbelievable but yet it is so looks like it can be but yet it will be so oh give God a hand of Praise oh I love the word of the Living God Amen then the Bible says how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into Old truth now watch what is happening here when the spirit of truth that makes you a paradox when it comes in you he will guide you into all truth what is truth I am the way the truth and the life what is truth sanctify them through the truth Thy word is the truth yes sir yes sir what is the truth the truth is the word so when the absolute amen becomes a paradox in you you then the Paradox in you leads you into truth so now inside of you comes a truth yes sir Oh Glory to God when we eat the words we are being converted yes sir from being paradoxes to being absolutes Hallelujah are you hearing me church when you eat the word you have already become a paradox by the Holy Ghost but now are eating the word why are you eating the word to become the word and when you become the word what is the word is an absolute so when the bride is the word then the bride becomes an absolute looks like it can be but yet it is so I'm looking at an absolute now the Church of the Living God the Bride of Jesus Christ it can be an absolute looks like it can be but yet is s Hallelujah that's why it's a paradox absolute because it looks like it can be but yet it is so oh glory to God oh glory to God I'm looking at now living absolute why do I say so because I hear the prophet of God say in Christ The Mystery of God he says notice being personally identified by the original headship we have the answer to the devil's question amen how can we be an answer to the devil's question unless we have the word amen unless we become the word the only answer to the devil is the word when the devil came to the Lord Jesus Christ how did he defeat him it is written it is written it is written how can you become an answer to the devil when you speak it is written when you become the word then you are an answer to the devil's question oh I have a question for you can this word leave again yes it can inside of you and I can paradoxes happen again yes they can inside the Church of the Living God can the sick still get healed yes they are getting healed can someone receive the Holy Ghost yes they can still receive the Holy Ghost can Miracle still happen yes they are happening every day every hour among the Church of the Living God the bride has become a paradox glory and from the Paradox they are the answer to the devil's question Oh Glory to God in the highest and when you become the answer to the devil's question now you can finish the work amen Christ in you the hope of glory Christ in you that makes you a paradox and you become the word and when you become the word then you can speak to situations now Romans chapter 8 can be fulfilled the manifestation of the sons of God now Mark 11:23 can be fulfilled if you say to this mountain be thou removed it is not you that is saying it but it is Christ in you the hope of glory Christ in you oh come on Church of the Living God how many says yes I've got Christ inside of me and when you have Christ inside of you that's the H of Glory Christ in you that speaks the word Let There Be and they shall be I'm going to give you 5 Seconds to speak what you will whatever it is that has been your desire you can open your mouth and let that word that is inside of you speak out your heart's desire speak out the salvation of your children speak out the salvation of your parents uh speak out the healing of your body speak out the restoration that you need in your own life uh speak out whatever it is that you need uh come on somebody glory to God in the highest hallelujah hallelujah as we are getting ready to close now let somebody move from a paradox to an absolute let somebody move from whatever situation to becoming an absolute hallelujah oh praise be to God whatever it is God can bring it your way whatever it is church God Can Make It Happen even this afternoon let me say to you Church of the Living God when God gives you a paradox God wants you to capture that moment I'm getting ready to close when God gives you a paradox God wants you to capture that moment why does God want you to capture that moment because evil days can come yes and when evil days come the devil will tell you God is not with you the devil will tell you God has already left you you were never a daughter of God anyhow but brother if you capture the moment of a paradox it's like those stones you can go back to them and say where is the God of this miracle where is the God of this situation so God wants you to capture those moments are you with me the Bible tells me of Jacob when he was called to go to partner Aram Amen to go look for a wife he passed through a place that was called L is that right yes sir when he got to that place he slept at that place and he took a rock for a for a pillow and as he slept on that rock then he saw a lad that was connected to Heaven Angels ascending and descending from that lad and then Abra sorry Jacob said surely this is the Gate of Heaven and when he woke up then what did he do he took that same stone that was a pillow and he turned into a pillar right yeah and he set it up there and he poured oil on it he has captured the moment he has a memorial for the moment then he goes up for many years to the place of Laban and after many years then he comes back he meets God AEL yes then God leads him back amen he stays in another place for a while but I believe it's in EX in in in in Genesis chter 35 then the Bible says God spoke to Jacob and he says arise and go to battle that place where I met you where you put up that pillar for a stone arise and go back to that place go to that moment that you captured go to that place where you knew that God is a reality go to that place where you knew that the miracle working God is a living God I want to say to you to somebody here have you ever had a miracle how many have ever had a miracle in their lives I want you to capture that moment when the devil Rises up in your life take him back there and say Satan who is it Hallelujah if you have a photo go take your photo if you wrote it in a diary go pick up your diary and say Satan let's read my diary who is it that came here who is it that was in this situation who is it that came in this situation who is it that came in my child when I prayed on that day who is it that came in that church when the preacher preached that sermon who is it that spoke to my heart brother as you carry on like that Satan will flee away from you resist the devil and he will flee away from you can you say Amen so God wants those paradoxes to become your absolute so I'll ask again how many have ever had a miracle if you have ever had a miracle that can become your absolute the god of that Miracle can be the god of another situation the god of that Miracle he can produce himself here again if God gave you the Holy Ghost he can give you again if God once healed you he can heal you again if God wants redeemed you he can redeem you again if God wants restor the situation he can restore again so let there be a paradox let there be a paradox how many have ever believed in a paradox the god of a miracle can wake it again the devil is a liar whatever he stole from you we giving it back to you even this very afternoon yes God can deliver yes God can restore yes God can redeem yes God can heal give God a hand of Praise somebody God bless you Florida God bless you church you can receive it if you want it you can start to thank him right now as you stand to your feet give him some Glory give him some praise and as you thank him let your blessings come your way thank him for healing you thank him for redeeming you thank him for giving you your heart's desire and as you thank him let him re the blessings upon your life God bless you until we meet again the Lord be with you brother Jack God bless you Church oh Hallelujah Glory Hallelujah Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah hallah GL hallu Hallelujah come on give him glory Church come on and worship Him Hallelujah Glory Hallelujah than you Lord thank you Jesus thank you Lord amen amen amen amen I hope you received your miracle today yes Lord my God my God my God Amen how we thank the Lord for the word amen on today amen we end up in an endless cycle you see we we receive a Word of Promise amen that word is our absolute and it leads us to our Paradox and then from our Paradox we go right back to the word again and it's just an endless cycle of Miracle after Miracle after Miracle after Miracle amen what what we saw today there's no defeat in that at all amen it's victory after Victory after Victory after Victory after Victory no matter what we're going through in our life we just go from Victory to Victory to Victory to Victory to we leave this place one day Lord hallelujah to the Lamb of God Amen amen I was just just watching as the Lord was just using our brother to take us right through the whole cycle and and and you know really and sometimes it's hard for us to believe this but the greatest amen um uh Paradox is what God has done in your life amen we were born in sin we were we were we we were shaped in iniquity come into the world speaking lies but what God has done in our life is a great paradox Paradox is so great and I just like it I mean he he started how uh with that testimony of um brother Tony that asked the the question well he prayed in his prayer if brother brandom after all the Miracles that he saw if he's telling the truth then let him find it brother Brandon was under the under pressure what do I do the brother they not going to believe me if it don't find God said what is that to you what if it's here or there you just speak it amen and as brother brother whisper just winding everything up you you realize that uh we have that same power in us as the bride no matter what our condition is we have the power to speak how can you say that brother Jack because the very last chapter of the Bible the spirit and the bride say that means they have the power to speak the spirit and the bride s come brother what a power has been released inside of USU the final voice to the final age will be the Bride of Jesus Christ it it's time to stop believing Every Lie the devil

songwriters and I don't remember the person that wrote that song but you know um only Believers can tap into a realm like that where it's not just a song but it becomes a manifested absolute right um you know and they people see different scriptures they might get inspired by but when it becomes manifested when it comes amen uh made real in your life right then it's then it's reality and and only the Believers can take a song like that and really understand the full meaning amen I'm going I'm I'm going to get what I spoke sir I'm I'm going to have it and and and and it's it's a you you you actually with you being the absolute you have a absolute faith that there is nothing the devil can do to stop you from getting what God has promised you that's the ain't nothing the devil can do ain't nothing a doctor can say [Music] right we we we we we went last night to pray for a a sister and when we went to the house you know we we we looked at our our sister and and um you know just the enemy

scriptures over her and and we we prayed over her and you know just felt the real anointing just kind of come into the room and and uh you know even we just remember the scripture that even Abraham when he was against hope the Bible says he still believed in Hope amen and uh you know that means Abraham had an absolute right and and as Believers that's what we got to have sometime no matter what we're going through an Absolut is what the word of God tells us and I was just quoting over her you know just scriptures and I said your husband reached out to us and and wanted us to you know to to he he didn't and he didn't say come he just said pray for my my my wife well what that meant to me please come by and pray that's what I interpreted and he told his wife he he say he say anytime I call they come this is genuine Christianity right here and uh and we went in just with the brothers and you know and I said you know the scripture just tells us we all we got to do is come um you know and lay hands on the sick we anoint you with oil in the name of the Lord and his name name is Jesus Christ we anoint you in the name of the Lord and and the Bible say the prayer of faith will save the sick and the Lord will raise up the God didn't say what the condition had to be he he didn't put stipulations in the contract right amen he just say just just just just you pray for him and let the prayer of faith say pray over the sick say and the Lord will raise them up I said that's what God promised us we're going to do exactly what God told us to do and after I finish praying looked around I said oh my I said you know it's it's four of us that come I didn't catch that before but I said four is the number of Deliverance and say there was a fourth man that jumped into the fire I I said
